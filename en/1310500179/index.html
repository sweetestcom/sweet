    <p>The following is a conversation with Yannis Papas, a comedian who cohosted the podcast</p>
<p>History Hyenas that I came across when I was researching the Battle of Crete from WWII.</p>
<p>He and his cohost were hilarious in their rants about history and about life.</p>
<p>The chemistry they have is probably the best of any cohosted comedy podcast or even podcast</p>
<p>in general that I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>As of a few weeks ago, unfortunately, History Hyenas is no more, at least for now, because</p>
<p>all good things must come to an end.</p>
<p>But Yannis hosts a new podcast called Long Days with Yannis Papas, plus he has a comedy</p>
<p>special on YouTube for free.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, WineAxis, Blinkist, Magic Spoon, and Indeed.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that some of you have noticed that I have not spoken with too</p>
<p>many computer scientists, physicists, biologists, or engineers recently.</p>
<p>The reason has to do mostly with the risk aversion of many of these folks in the time</p>
<p>of COVID, especially as they get closer to taking the vaccine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tested several times a week and still some people are just more willing than others</p>
<p>to have an in person conversation in these times.</p>
<p>I only do these podcasts in person because I look for the possibility of a genuine human</p>
<p>connection.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to sacrifice a lot for that.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s silly, but I look for the magic that Charles Bukowski writes about in his</p>
<p>poem Nirvana.</p>
<p>The magic that is somehow in the air on those rare occasions when two people meet, talk,</p>
<p>and you notice that while on the surface you may be worlds apart, you&rsquo;re still somehow</p>
<p>woven from the same fabric.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that with many guests, Jim Keller comes to mind, but many others as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an AI person, machine learning, robotics, computer science is my passion.</p>
<p>Trust me, I can&rsquo;t wait to be having more technical conversations again, but I will</p>
<p>also continue to mix in comedians, musicians, historians, and of course, wise all seeing</p>
<p>sages like Giannis Papas and Tim Dillon, just to keep it, as Tim likes to say, fun.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Giannis Papas.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve cohosted, until recently, an amazing history comedy podcast called The History</p>
<p>Hyenas.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a bit of a student of history?</p>
<p>Yeah, an F student of history.</p>
<p>F student.</p>
<p>Okay, I thought it was more like a D minus.</p>
<p>D minus, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Still got to repeat the grade if you get all D minuses.</p>
<p>I actually had a.67 GPA average my freshman year and I had to do it again.</p>
<p>This podcast is going to be the spectrum of human intelligence.</p>
<p>It runs the gamut from there to here.</p>
<p>So this is going to set the low bar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m barely sliding into human, I&rsquo;m closer to chimp.</p>
<p>And I bring that up that you&rsquo;re also friends with the great, the powerful Tim Dillon.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about power and the corrupting effects of power.</p>
<p>Sometimes I look at Tim Dillon as he grows in power.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought you meant in size.</p>
<p>Well, size, I think they&rsquo;re correlated.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I saw him, I&rsquo;ve been in Austin a couple of days, I saw him once, we had eight meals in</p>
<p>one day.</p>
<p>Eight meals.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I feel like I&rsquo;ve been here longer than I have just because of the meals with Dillon.</p>
<p>Kid likes biscuits and barbecue.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s more like, see, I was imagining Putin or somebody like that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s more like the North Korean dictator.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>They get along great, those two.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, Tim Dillon and King Jong Un would be like, they could make like a buddy cop</p>
<p>movie.</p>
<p>They would get along like Lethal Weapon.</p>
<p>That would be a good pitch movie.</p>
<p>Great podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That would be a great podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So much to talk about.</p>
<p>So many similar ideas about the world.</p>
<p>So what do you think the world would look like if Tim Dillon was given absolute power?</p>
<p>He seems like a person that&rsquo;s an interesting study of the corrupting effects of power.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to give him power.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want, I don&rsquo;t even want him wearing a suit.</p>
<p>Like I want a guy who&rsquo;s as thoughtful and educated as you wearing a suit.</p>
<p>Like cause you know, suits corrupt you.</p>
<p>You put that suit on, you start feeling that power.</p>
<p>You start.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even want Tim Dillon in a suit.</p>
<p>Power would, he would kill people.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d get rid of anything that he deemed.</p>
<p>I mean, if you made a lobster roll and it wasn&rsquo;t up to Tim Dillon&rsquo;s standard, he would</p>
<p>have you executed.</p>
<p>The entire restaurant staff is just gone.</p>
<p>He would have people below his food standard execute.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be programs, not of people who are political dissidents, but of people who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>meet his food standard.</p>
<p>His cuisine standard is high and he&rsquo;s usually right.</p>
<p>Do you think power does corrupt people?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like one of the reasons we mentioned offline Joe Rogan, he&rsquo;s been an inspiration to me</p>
<p>cause he gets, he gets, if you get power, just more famous and famous and yes, probably</p>
<p>a bit of power in terms of influence and he&rsquo;s still pretty much the same guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s going to be true for everybody.</p>
<p>Do you ever think, ask yourself that question?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a rare breed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like a benign king.</p>
<p>Most people I meet who are like really powerful are like douchebags and that&rsquo;s how they got</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, psychopaths have the advantage because they don&rsquo;t have feelings and Joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a rare example.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a powerhouse of will and he, I do think about that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think I should be stopped right now.</p>
<p>Just stop me right now because yeah, power for me, I would, when people get power, they</p>
<p>indulge.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t change anyone.</p>
<p>It just reveals your darkest, you know, people aren&rsquo;t supposed to have anything they want.</p>
<p>You got to be able to struggle for everything.</p>
<p>So I would have a harem, I&rsquo;d be like a Roman dictator.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like a Roman emperor.</p>
<p>I mean, people called them emperors.</p>
<p>They were dictators.</p>
<p>The most effective leaders are dictators.</p>
<p>I hope we get back to that.</p>
<p>Democracy hasn&rsquo;t worked.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready for a secession of Caesars and I want to start with AOC.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Dictators get the job done.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>At a certain point you got, that&rsquo;s why social workers can only get you so far.</p>
<p>You need action.</p>
<p>I was a social worker for five years and all you do is ask about medications and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>solve anything.</p>
<p>I do ask myself of that, like, cause I&rsquo;m more in the tech space of constructing systems</p>
<p>that prevent me from being corrupt.</p>
<p>Cause right now I&rsquo;m all about love and all about those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But I wonder, you said like, it just reveals the darkness.</p>
<p>The problem is we might not be aware of our own darkness.</p>
<p>I have the same feeling about money actually.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been avoiding thinking about money, like basically constructing my moral system, my</p>
<p>moral compass around money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the moment I feel a little too happy about the idea of owning some cool shiny thing,</p>
<p>I started to think, okay, I&rsquo;m not going to own that shiny thing cause I&rsquo;m afraid of the</p>
<p>slippery slope of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You ever think about that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The thing about the capitalist system is it puts sort of a profit motive above beauty.</p>
<p>And you notice when you see certain cities, especially in the old days where like buildings</p>
<p>used to be beautiful and now they&rsquo;re just like boxes, they throw a kid up and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>for all profit margin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the illusion of permanence that, you know, it&rsquo;s like, oh, let me get as much money</p>
<p>as I can.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, my dad used to say, you know, everyone, it&rsquo;s a cliche, but you can&rsquo;t take it with</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s comical to me that we&rsquo;re here trying to get this infinite</p>
<p>amount.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like Sisyphus, we&rsquo;re all trying to climb this hill, but I mean, the rock&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to fall on us.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a healthy outlook.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My dad always used to say before he passed, you know, he would say, you can&rsquo;t, you have</p>
<p>to survive not only physically, but you have to survive emotionally.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people forget about the emotional part of a survival.</p>
<p>You have to survive emotionally and humor and, and, and understanding reality in its</p>
<p>objective context helps with that.</p>
<p>Accepting reality as this ephemeral thing that you&rsquo;re really just a part of, but not</p>
<p>as significant as your ego wants you to believe is a, is a start.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good foundation for surviving emotionally.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mean?</p>
<p>Surviving emotionally?</p>
<p>Like what, what&rsquo;s an ideal life look like while you&rsquo;re thriving?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t take things too seriously.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, because they&rsquo;re ephemeral.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not permanent.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s permanent.</p>
<p>Your bank account&rsquo;s not permanent.</p>
<p>Your abilities aren&rsquo;t permanent.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s permanent.</p>
<p>Your abilities aren&rsquo;t permanent.</p>
<p>Your memory&rsquo;s not permanent.</p>
<p>Your, your, your dick getting hard is not permanent.</p>
<p>Can I curse on this or is this go out to, yeah, you can curse to your heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, gender&rsquo;s not even permanent anymore.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m gonna, I&rsquo;m gonna change maybe and live my second half as another gender</p>
<p>just to have, I&rsquo;m bored with this gender.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like nothing is permanent.</p>
<p>And so accepting that emotionally is a good start to being more flexible.</p>
<p>You gotta be flexible.</p>
<p>Like my dad used to say, anything too stiff snaps.</p>
<p>You gotta, you know, it&rsquo;s a cliche and people have said it a bunch of different ways, but</p>
<p>Bruce Lee&rsquo;s right, man.</p>
<p>Be water.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Bukowski has this quote about love, that love is a fog that fades with the first light of</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s a romantic, that guy.</p>
<p>But that even love is a thing that just doesn&rsquo;t last very long.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Um, you know, some people would disagree with that.</p>
<p>Maybe it morphs, like, like, like water, it changes, right?</p>
<p>It might not be, it might not be this, cause he&rsquo;s mostly just, uh, loved like prostitutes,</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>The best kind of love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No demand.</p>
<p>No, uh, responsibilities.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a financial transaction.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, ephemeral as ever.</p>
<p>You mentioned your dad.</p>
<p>He passed away, uh, two, uh, a year and a half ago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What did you learn from him?</p>
<p>I love my dad.</p>
<p>My dad, I would say my dad was my, my hero.</p>
<p>He was just, uh, my dad really embodied those values and I think, um, for better or worse,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s made me who I am.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, he, uh, my dad was, was a painter, he was a lawyer, he was, uh, he was, uh, you</p>
<p>know, a Lieutenant in the military.</p>
<p>New Yorker.</p>
<p>Born and bred Brooklyn.</p>
<p>His dad, his dad, you know, uh, surprise owned a diner.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s sort of the Greek passport.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the immigration passport for Greeks into America.</p>
<p>And, um, yeah, my dad played football.</p>
<p>He just, my dad did what he wanted.</p>
<p>He lived as he wanted at all costs and I think I got that from him for better or worse.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hurt me in my pursuits.</p>
<p>Uh, if you consider money and fame, uh, to be paramount, you know, I, I&rsquo;ve always done</p>
<p>what I wanted and if I stopped wanting to do it, I just stopped doing it.</p>
<p>I think I got that from my dad.</p>
<p>So maybe for better or worse, that&rsquo;s what I learned from him.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a real currency, you know, feeling like you&rsquo;re in love with what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing it, maybe perhaps that&rsquo;s worth more than money.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You miss him?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Every day.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m happy that, uh, he, he got 91 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare.</p>
<p>I mean, he smoked for 60 years.</p>
<p>Talk about like a guy who was an outlier and he smoked like 60 years, like packs.</p>
<p>I mean, and he didn&rsquo;t die from that.</p>
<p>He died.</p>
<p>He had a prostate cancer, which is the way men should go.</p>
<p>Your dick should give out.</p>
<p>It should start from the dick.</p>
<p>I mean, we focus so much of our life on the dick that that&rsquo;s the way that&rsquo;s a successful</p>
<p>life and that&rsquo;s why every man eventually gets prostate cancer because that is the universe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>way of saying like the thing you focused on the most is you put the most energy into is</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s spent and it&rsquo;s going to, your, your rotting is going to start there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a successful life and it just spread all over his body and he slowly died.</p>
<p>I was with him when he died and that meant a lot to me because me and my brother weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>talking at the time cause we&rsquo;re Greeks, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re talking again, but that&rsquo;s how it is.</p>
<p>You got a few brothers, right?</p>
<p>I got two brothers, but I wanted to make sure I was with him when he died and I got lucky</p>
<p>and I was in the room with him when he died.</p>
<p>You were in the room with your brother and you weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No, my brother wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>We were kind of doing shifts.</p>
<p>I was, I was there.</p>
<p>I spent the night, the dad, my, the night my dad died, he died in the early in the morning</p>
<p>and I heard the death rattle last breath and it was just, I think it was, uh, I, he knew</p>
<p>I was there and, uh, I think that just probably meant something to him and I&rsquo;m just glad I</p>
<p>was there.</p>
<p>Does that make you sad that, uh, life is ephemeral, like you said, that, that you die?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think about your own death?</p>
<p>You meditate on that?</p>
<p>I think it, I think the actual, if there is a point to life, it&rsquo;s to, um, hopefully not</p>
<p>fear death, to accept reality.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I think so much goes awry in the human condition when we lose touch with reality.</p>
<p>Every, uh, political system that&rsquo;s led to mass murder and everything, I think because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because the, the tenants of those political philosophies ended up being utopian.</p>
<p>They were detached from reality, detached from nature.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s very important to accept and acknowledge your own mortality.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the foundation for what makes a good person, a moral person, um, a contributing</p>
<p>member of society because it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>True things should be the foundation of all things.</p>
<p>If, if, if what you believe is based on illusion, you&rsquo;re going to end up doing destruction.</p>
<p>Whether that destruction is on a scale of one to 10, you are going to be destructive</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fantasy.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>See, the thing is the truth is about, I don&rsquo;t think you can ever reach truth.</p>
<p>Truth is about like constantly digging and to push back on your idea that you should</p>
<p>accept death.</p>
<p>I think the more honest response to death, so the least honest is to run away from it,</p>
<p>create illusions that help you imagine that there&rsquo;s not a death.</p>
<p>Uh, the next is to accept it, but the real honest one is to fear it because I, I, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m with, uh, Ernest Becker is a philosopher, uh, wrote a book called Denial of Death.</p>
<p>He says that the, like much of the human condition is based in the fear of mortality.</p>
<p>That we like, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the creative force of the human energy.</p>
<p>Like Freud said, do you want to sleep with your mother?</p>
<p>He said, no, that&rsquo;s not what motivates you.</p>
<p>Maybe his mom wasn&rsquo;t hot though.</p>
<p>I mean, or he wasn&rsquo;t Greek because apparently at a poll, we found that we found that all</p>
<p>things good and bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Thanks for that.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know if his mom was a looker or not.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d have to Google it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look up on Google images.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I think the honest, as he says, the thing that we run away from is that there&rsquo;s a terror.</p>
<p>He calls it like terror.</p>
<p>Uh, there&rsquo;s something called terror management theory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some philosophers after him followed on that we&rsquo;re basically trying to run away</p>
<p>from this fear and acceptance is actually creating an illusion for yourself.</p>
<p>Like you can actually accept something as terrifying as this.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s more with the stoics, the stoic constantly meditate on their death.</p>
<p>I mean, they, what does that mean?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s, you know, acceptance of death isn&rsquo;t a thing you do like on a Monday</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re done is a thing you constantly have to meditate on, like reminding yourself</p>
<p>like this ride is over.</p>
<p>It could be over today.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re, if you think about every single day, it gives you an appreciation</p>
<p>of Woody Allen movies, at least it gives you appreciation of basically everything, including</p>
<p>Woody Allen movies, which shows you how deep your appreciation for life could be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually haven&rsquo;t been following much about what Woody Allen&rsquo;s, but apparently he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been a troublemaker through most of his life.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, he&rsquo;s caused a little bit of strife.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s left a little, uh, yeah, he&rsquo;s left a little confusion in his wake for sure.</p>
<p>But I mean, you know, that&rsquo;s another one separate the art from the artist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got, I mean, the guys will go down in history as the greatest he&rsquo;s made, I mean,</p>
<p>maybe a year and they&rsquo;re all, you can always find something good about each movie, like</p>
<p>the dialogue or whatever.</p>
<p>Um, I love what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, but the only thing I would say to push back a little bit since we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>playing a little table tennis here is, um, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a choice to fear death.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more of an, it seems more instinctual.</p>
<p>It seems like something that nature wants you to do because I&rsquo;ve been in positions where</p>
<p>I thought I was going to die.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been shot and I had those moments and then nature also, uh, you know, kicks</p>
<p>in an instinct, which is acceptance where you kind of, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s a chemical</p>
<p>release or whatever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you know, we&rsquo;re all, we&rsquo;re robots basically.</p>
<p>So some sort of chemical is released that protects you, but there is an acceptance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much, uh, of it was a conscious choice, probably very little.</p>
<p>Um, and that&rsquo;s the point I&rsquo;m making is it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s instinctual.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really have a choice in fearing death.</p>
<p>Otherwise there would be no progression.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t all life seems to want to survive, uh, not by choice, but by instinct.</p>
<p>So he, he argues that the fear is not the instinctual of, it&rsquo;s not the animalistic stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that makes us special is the, what humans are able to do is to have</p>
<p>a knowledge that we&rsquo;re going to die one day.</p>
<p>Animals don&rsquo;t have that animals.</p>
<p>Fear is instinctual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, Holy shit, what&rsquo;s that sound over there?</p>
<p>He says, we&rsquo;re actually able to contemplate the fact that this ride ends and that that</p>
<p>kind of cognitive construct is difficult for us to deal with.</p>
<p>Like what the hell does that mean?</p>
<p>Like just to, just to think about, it&rsquo;s going to be over at a certain point, it&rsquo;s just over</p>
<p>lights out.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s very difficult to kind of load that into whatever this like little brain we got.</p>
<p>Like, what does that actually mean?</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what gives everything meaning.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because if everything lasted forever, if, uh, if this went on ad infinitum, there would</p>
<p>be no meaning to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, Hey, if I don&rsquo;t see you tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll see in a million years, there would be</p>
<p>no meaning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be no urgency.</p>
<p>There would be no feelings.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be no, uh, nothing of magnitude or superficiality.</p>
<p>It would all just be this kind of, it would be torture.</p>
<p>It would actually, that would actually be torture to be here forever.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m already sick of this place and I&rsquo;m just in my forties.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of everything.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people, when they talk about mortality, they consider, they consider</p>
<p>mortality appealing because you get a chance to do basically all these things you might</p>
<p>not get a chance to do otherwise, like all the kinds of travel broadly, explore, read</p>
<p>every book, explore every idea, do every hobby, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>The idea I was talking to mentioned, uh, the reality of being immortal would be more likely,</p>
<p>I like this idea, more likely would be you just sitting there doing nothing because,</p>
<p>and putting off all that travel and exploration to later because you&rsquo;ll always have time.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;re going to have, what actual immortality would look like for a bunch of</p>
<p>humans is people sitting there doing nothing.</p>
<p>It would be like a Greek caffineer just sitting around drinking coffee.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a lazy man&rsquo;s paradise.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so interesting because that, that&rsquo;s, that rings true to me for what humans are</p>
<p>like is we&rsquo;ll basically just put off all those exciting adventures and just be lazy, become</p>
<p>lazier and lazier and lazier because you&rsquo;ll always have a chance to do all the exciting</p>
<p>things and we&rsquo;ll just get, we&rsquo;ll basically become Tim Dillon.</p>
<p>We just sit there and have a podcast and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>He works hard.</p>
<p>Um, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that sounds actually like heaven, dude.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s speaking to my heart really.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m at heart, I&rsquo;m a very lazy person.</p>
<p>I always try to find ways to lie down.</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m sitting, I&rsquo;ll figure out a way to kind of contort myself to later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting thing to like in, yeah.</p>
<p>If you can always push something off, yeah, that, I like that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s heaven.</p>
<p>And um,</p>
<p>See, we just changed your mind.</p>
<p>You kind of like the immortality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I kind of like it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ll be no thirsts.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You can always put it off.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to bang this girl.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, ah, put it off.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m thinking about Muslim heaven and they may be offering the best deal.</p>
<p>I mean, if it was an expo and they had a booth, I may go with them because they offer, they</p>
<p>offer 62 or 72, but then I&rsquo;d get sick of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want to, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I always wondered like, are you given the 62 virgins or you choose, can you create them</p>
<p>like an avatar, like a video game, or are you just given?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the number, why it&rsquo;s important to have that high number.</p>
<p>First of all, I think it&rsquo;s a mistranslation about the virgins, but outside of that, outside</p>
<p>of that, I feel like the conversation is really important.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they ever specify like what kind of books these girls read.</p>
<p>Like what are they, what are they into?</p>
<p>Like the quality of the conversation, I think if you&rsquo;re talking about eternity, the quality</p>
<p>of the intellect and the conversation and the personalities is way more important.</p>
<p>And the Greeks have an ancient, ancient expression, pat metronaros stone, which my mother always</p>
<p>used to say, which is everything in moderation, nothing in excess.</p>
<p>So trying to always get the status quo and uh, yeah, that many women, eventually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the magic Johnson effect, Isaiah Thomas effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too much and you&rsquo;re going to end up, you&rsquo;re going to end up banging a dude</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get sick of it cause it&rsquo;s too much and there&rsquo;s going to be a eunuch</p>
<p>that finds its way into your harem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been proven throughout history, every empire, when you have all that power.</p>
<p>And again, this goes back to power corrupting.</p>
<p>If you have, if there&rsquo;s no struggle, there&rsquo;s no meaning, there&rsquo;s the value is from the</p>
<p>journey, the, the working hard to struggle.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s just given to you because you&rsquo;re a Sultan or you&rsquo;re Alexander the Great or</p>
<p>whatever, you&rsquo;re going to get bored and you&rsquo;re going to bang a dude.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, I think that&rsquo;s a scientific axiom actually.</p>
<p>Eventually you&rsquo;ll get bored and bang a dude.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think it won&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll go to animals, you go to robot.</p>
<p>I mean, eventually it all ends up in robots and then the robots rebel and then the humans</p>
<p>will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>If, if we&rsquo;re speaking truth, you said the value of life, one of the highest ideals is</p>
<p>to seek truth.</p>
<p>I think if we&rsquo;re being honest.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a quick question?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If you, if you live in a small, I come from small islands, right?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a stereotype that that&rsquo;s where they bang animals.</p>
<p>But if you come from a very small community, you know, an island or something, and you</p>
<p>have the choice of banging a family member or an animal, which one is worse on the moral</p>
<p>scale?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re technically not related to the animal.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>This is interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, these are human constructs, these ideas, but yet for me personally, taboo would</p>
<p>be more taboo to, uh, to, to have sex with a family member.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, animal.</p>
<p>I mean, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to know where you stand on that.</p>
<p>I think if viewers, you know, if they didn&rsquo;t have, they didn&rsquo;t know they had that question.</p>
<p>I just, they just learned a little bit about you.</p>
<p>And now I know.</p>
<p>I look forward to the internet clipping that out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there, there is, listen, uh, in some, outside of, outside of that, I do think about</p>
<p>that a lot.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous, uh, about morality connected to animals in terms of</p>
<p>all the, the, the factory farming and so on.</p>
<p>It seems like that&rsquo;s one of the things we&rsquo;ll look, cause I love meat, but I kind of feel</p>
<p>bad about it and, and bad in a way where I think if we look like a hundred years from</p>
<p>now, we&rsquo;ll look back at this time as like one of the great like tortures and injustices</p>
<p>that we humans have committed.</p>
<p>And I mean, all that has to do with the sex with the animal has to do with consent and</p>
<p>about the experience of suffering of animals.</p>
<p>The reason I think about that personally a lot, cause I think about robotics, I think</p>
<p>about creating artificial consciousnesses, uh, or artificial like beings that have some</p>
<p>elements of the human nature.</p>
<p>And then you start to think like, well, what does it mean to suffer?</p>
<p>What does it mean for entity to exist such that it deserves rights?</p>
<p>This is something that the founding fathers were thinking about, like, you know, all men</p>
<p>are created equal.</p>
<p>What does it, which, who is included in the men who, who&rsquo;s not in that, in that sentence</p>
<p>and our animals included in that are robots.</p>
<p>I honestly think that there will be a civil rights movement for robots in the future.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is that the Turing test, the way you try to, is that what they call it where you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to see if AI can think like a human or whatever, or feel like a human?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a, the Turing test closely defined as more about talk like a human.</p>
<p>So you can, you can imagine systems that are able to, you can have a conversation like</p>
<p>this and I would be a robot for example, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I would do in a, in society.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean I deserve rights or that doesn&rsquo;t mean I would be conscious.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that I would be able to suffer and to experience pleasure and dream and all</p>
<p>those kinds of human things.</p>
<p>The question isn&rsquo;t whether you&rsquo;re able to talk, which is passed in the Turing test.</p>
<p>The question is whether you&rsquo;re able to feel, to be, I mean, I go back to suffering.</p>
<p>The thing that the, that our documents protect us against is suffering.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t want humans to suffer.</p>
<p>And if a robot can suffer, that discussion starts being about like, well, shouldn&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>protect them?</p>
<p>Currently we don&rsquo;t protect animals.</p>
<p>We protect that dog.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s laws.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actual legislation that protects dogs for torture places.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>Dogs is something I don&rsquo;t think people really understand enough about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my obsessions.</p>
<p>So they, they, my dad always used to say those, he goes, those things are, those things are</p>
<p>basically human.</p>
<p>And I mean, they dream, they have anxiety.</p>
<p>And what people often overlook about dogs is without dogs, we wouldn&rsquo;t be here.</p>
<p>We would not have ever evolved from hunter gatherer to agrarian to, you know, civilization.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t have cities.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t have anything.</p>
<p>I mean, they are our partner in survival and they are a magical animal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no animal that was, it was like destiny almost.</p>
<p>I mean, a malleable animal, there&rsquo;s no animal that&rsquo;s that malleable that in a few generations</p>
<p>you can tailor to a specific job that you need.</p>
<p>And without that animal, without dogs doing that animal, protecting our crops from, from,</p>
<p>you know scavengers and stuff like that, you know, the list goes on.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t be here.</p>
<p>So we, that&rsquo;s an often overlooked fact that human evolution was not done in a vacuum just</p>
<p>with humans.</p>
<p>Without dogs, we would have never evolved.</p>
<p>I mean, we weren&rsquo;t the apex predator for most of our existence.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t even the apex predator.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re getting eaten by hyenas, which is my favorite animal and you know, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of an injustice to, I mean, I&rsquo;m kind of mad at dogs.</p>
<p>We deserve to get eaten by hyenas, but without dogs, we wouldn&rsquo;t be here and dogs, dogs deserve</p>
<p>the protection.</p>
<p>So do horses.</p>
<p>They fucking lugged us around for thousands of years and now these fucking German psychopaths</p>
<p>are eating them or whatever.</p>
<p>We should not eat horse meat just on like, be a good dude, man.</p>
<p>These things lugged us around for generations, they&rsquo;re beautiful, you know, ride them or</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it rubs me the wrong way that we eat horses.</p>
<p>Yeah, the horses one is interesting and one of my favorite books is Animal Farm by Orwell</p>
<p>and the horses don&rsquo;t get a good ending in that, I kind of, my spirit animal I suppose</p>
<p>is the horse from Animal Farm, Boxer, where he says, I will work harder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his motto.</p>
<p>I work really hard at stupid things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically what I, I just hit my head against the wall for no reason whatsoever.</p>
<p>But that probably fulfills, you have a big brain, you were probably born with a big brain</p>
<p>that kind of fulfills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s killing neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exercise for you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think some animals deserve to be eaten though?</p>
<p>Kind of like.</p>
<p>Hyenas.</p>
<p>Come on, dude.</p>
<p>I mean, you gotta respect the hyena.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s look, first of all, let me just comment on the dog thing.</p>
<p>There is like conferences on dog cognition from a perspective of people that study psychology,</p>
<p>cognitive science, neuroscience, dogs are fascinating.</p>
<p>The way they move their eyes, they&rsquo;re able to, they&rsquo;re the only other animal besides</p>
<p>humans, they&rsquo;re able to communicate with their eyes.</p>
<p>They can look at a thing and look back at you and look back at the thing to communicate</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all like through our eyes, communicate that we&rsquo;re collaborating.</p>
<p>So every other animal uses their eyes to actually look at things.</p>
<p>The dogs use it to like communicate with you, with us humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other elements of dogs that are amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, if it wasn&rsquo;t for them, they&rsquo;re the ones, they were our first alarm system</p>
<p>for predators.</p>
<p>They would defend us.</p>
<p>I mean, the Basenji is one of the most ancient dogs.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re tiny, but they&rsquo;re fearless and they would chase off lions.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;d be packs of them and they chase off lions and protect the tribes.</p>
<p>I even get tingles like thinking about dogs because I have a dog, I love my dog.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about when you&rsquo;re walking with your dog off leash in the woods, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something about it that&rsquo;s like, that tugs at that millions of years of evolution, like</p>
<p>that gut, you know, it&rsquo;s like, I had a Finnish friend of mine, he&rsquo;s a comic, Tommy Valamies</p>
<p>once told me, he was like, he was like, the gut, he&rsquo;s like, I believe in it.</p>
<p>Like that gut, you know, when you have that feeling, he&rsquo;s like, always trust that because</p>
<p>that is million, those are all your ancestors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the survival instinct of all your ancestors at the beginning of time, you know, telling</p>
<p>you like, Hey, something&rsquo;s off here, something&rsquo;s, you know, so don&rsquo;t get in the car with Ted</p>
<p>Bundy is what I&rsquo;m saying, ladies, how fucking stupid, who, how can you fall for that?</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s got a fucking sling on, don&rsquo;t get in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Follow the gut.</p>
<p>My question to you, are psychopaths essentially robots?</p>
<p>So first of all, let&rsquo;s not, you&rsquo;re using the word robot in a derogatory way that I, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>triggered by.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I feel offended.</p>
<p>You should be because you know what, people are always scared of robots, but I actually,</p>
<p>I have, I&rsquo;ve made the sort of, uh, I, I&rsquo;ve made it to say, Hey, I&rsquo;ve, I thought about</p>
<p>it and like robot, robots have been nothing but helpful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the people we should be scared of.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;re kind of missing the most destructive thing is us because it&rsquo;s, but robots are helpful.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a fucking robot.</p>
<p>You know, I went on hotel tonight, I&rsquo;m already booked up, you know, I got my, I can change</p>
<p>my flight if, if this barbecue with Rogan goes 16 hours, which whatever Rogan wants</p>
<p>to do, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>If he wants to kick me in the chest, I&rsquo;ll let him kick me in the chest, whatever.</p>
<p>Robots are helpful.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, tanks and autonomous weapons systems don&rsquo;t kill people.</p>
<p>People kill people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The NRA is about to collect that for you.</p>
<p>Uh, a lot of love for dogs.</p>
<p>I appreciate it very much.</p>
<p>And at the same time, you have the other thing that people seem to have love for, which is</p>
<p>cats.</p>
<p>And on the flip side of everything you&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;m trying to understand what have cats</p>
<p>ever done for human civilization?</p>
<p>They keep rodents away.</p>
<p>The domesticated cat is very important.</p>
<p>Keeps the rodents away.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they were domesticated for.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re psychopathic killers who ended up killing, uh, innocent, um, neighborhood</p>
<p>chipmunks and, and birds, uh, they really affect the, uh, the balance of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>But if you have love for cats too, not as much as dogs, I mean, dogs are, like you said,</p>
<p>they look at humans.</p>
<p>I actually read an article that some people were theorizing they&rsquo;re smarter than chimps</p>
<p>because of the way they can work with humans.</p>
<p>And there was one border collie that spoke like 300 words, like a quarter, like a lang,</p>
<p>almost part of the language.</p>
<p>And their nose is like a mat.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like magic, dude.</p>
<p>If you can smell in my ass to what I had for breakfast from miles away, that&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>
<p>I mean, in some ways that their nose, if you were to put it on a scale, maybe their nose</p>
<p>is more intelligent than our brain for what it does.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, I mean, dude, they can smell you from miles away.</p>
<p>You ever see a dog just like sniffing, catching?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s smelling like, I don&rsquo;t remember the, the, the date on it, but it&rsquo;s like, they</p>
<p>have like millions of receptors or something where we only, you know, thank God we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have their nose.</p>
<p>That would be, that would make sex weird, be a little too intense.</p>
<p>I think you mentioned when you were talking about Woody Allen separating the, the art</p>
<p>from the artist.</p>
<p>So that brings to mind Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>How about that transition?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>But if you look at just powerful leaders throughout history, Stalin, Hitler, but even modern ones</p>
<p>like Putin, and we&rsquo;re talking about power.</p>
<p>How do you explain them?</p>
<p>You said that power reveals, not corrupts, but do you think there&rsquo;s some element to which</p>
<p>power corrupted Hitler, power corrupted Stalin after he gained power?</p>
<p>And the same with Putin.</p>
<p>When Putin gained power in 2000, do you think the amount of power that he was in possession</p>
<p>with for many years, do you think that corrupted him?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re joking about dictators get the job done.</p>
<p>There is some sense in certain countries where a dictator is the only thing that can stabilize</p>
<p>a nation.</p>
<p>The counter argument to that for democracies is like, yeah, but that&rsquo;s a short term solution</p>
<p>for a long term problem.</p>
<p>So you want to embrace chaos with democracy.</p>
<p>That might be violent.</p>
<p>There might be a lot of just constant changing of leadership.</p>
<p>There might be a lot of corruption in the short term, but if you stay strong with the</p>
<p>ideals of democracy, then you&rsquo;ll be ultimately create something that as beautiful and stable</p>
<p>as the United States.</p>
<p>The sad thing is, is I don&rsquo;t know if history tells that story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I said, you look at Greece, you look at Rome, democracy kind of failed.</p>
<p>The majority of Rome, the most successful empire that we&rsquo;ve had, was a dictatorship</p>
<p>for most of its run.</p>
<p>But I do believe in a republic, which is sort of a limited democracy.</p>
<p>I do believe in what we have here.</p>
<p>I believe in common law.</p>
<p>I believe in individual rights.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think you said it.</p>
<p>Nobody could have said it better.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a short term solution.</p>
<p>You look at Saddam Hussein, he kind of, when we took him out, then there was a lot of infighting</p>
<p>that happened that he was kind of keeping at bay because he was a strong man, dictator.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s an interesting one, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>From my understanding, I&rsquo;m sure people will correct me, but when Saddam Hussein first</p>
<p>came to power, he was, he&rsquo;s quite progressive.</p>
<p>So like the, as far as I understand, the signs of an evil dictator weren&rsquo;t exactly there.</p>
<p>So again, there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know if power revealed or power corrupted.</p>
<p>Or that could have been the initial subterfuge to kind of get everybody, you know, Hitler</p>
<p>also is a champion of the people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s built some new roads.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s with psychopaths too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s interesting to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if power corrupts psychopaths.</p>
<p>And now that we know that we can do these CAT scans and brain scans, we know that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>born that way.</p>
<p>Power definitely corrupts people who have the capacity to feel and for empathy.</p>
<p>Power I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think power corrupts people who were born psychopathic with that condition or sociopaths</p>
<p>who had, who, you know, who were closer to psychopath and then had some traumatic life.</p>
<p>You know, I just think, you know, the best way to get away with whatever nefarious thing</p>
<p>you want to do to feel, I guess the only thing psychopaths can feel is that excitement, is</p>
<p>to pretend to be the opposite of what you are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, that&rsquo;s what killers do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the worst people, look at Bill Cosby.</p>
<p>I mean, he was, what better way to hide, you know, it&rsquo;s like what wokeness is now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m such a great person and then you&rsquo;re like, are you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great, the best way to hide is to pretend to be the opposite of what you are.</p>
<p>Just like Ted Bundy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just an innocent, helpful guy.</p>
<p>And then boom, next thing you know, you&rsquo;re getting your tit bit off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really well said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually kind of funny because I talk about love a lot.</p>
<p>And I think the people that kind of look at me with squinty eyes, they wonder like how</p>
<p>many bodies are in that closet, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something about the duality of like, we&rsquo;re so skeptical as a culture.</p>
<p>Like if somebody is just like, seems to be kind of, sort of, I don&rsquo;t know, positive and</p>
<p>all that kind of, you know, how do I put it?</p>
<p>Just simple, simple minded in the positivity they express.</p>
<p>They think like, okay, there&rsquo;s some demons in there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Especially if you&rsquo;re a New Yorker, we don&rsquo;t trust any, the nicer you are, the more skeptical</p>
<p>we are.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve struggled with that down here.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, nah, dude, just, I wanted to show you the best tacos, man.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, did you really, what do you want?</p>
<p>Because in New York, it&rsquo;s like, if anyone&rsquo;s nice to you, they want something.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, the pro side to that is it makes you very street smart.</p>
<p>The downside to that is it makes you way too cynical.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve definitely experienced that here in Texas, but people are super, super nice.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, do all this cool shit for you and you wonder, what&rsquo;s the angle?</p>
<p>What are we doing here?</p>
<p>You mentioned hyenas as your favorite animal.</p>
<p>I forgot to ask you, what the hell were you thinking?</p>
<p>Why is a hyena is your favorite animal?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating animal.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the whole animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Like why is it, where do you put, so you like dogs, love my favorite, your favorite is dogs,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re kind of outside the animal kingdom because you&rsquo;re thinking about wolves.</p>
<p>So the animal kingdom is in nature.</p>
<p>Dogs escaped nature.</p>
<p>They kind of did.</p>
<p>Uh, together with humans, like in a collaborative way, exactly.</p>
<p>So within nature, within the animal kingdom, what, who&rsquo;s, uh, why not lions?</p>
<p>Because lions are predictable.</p>
<p>Lions are just, you know, they&rsquo;re regal and kind of, they bore me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the hot chick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we get it.</p>
<p>You were born the best.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I like a scrappy, by any means necessary, intelligent and cunning.</p>
<p>But aren&rsquo;t they dishonest?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I like them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re dishonest.</p>
<p>They employ chicanery.</p>
<p>They, uh, they&rsquo;re, and that&rsquo;s just a sign of how intelligent they are and how self reliant</p>
<p>they are and how brutal they are.</p>
<p>Um, they&rsquo;re brutally honest in how much they lie, you know, because it&rsquo;s just, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to get the job done.</p>
<p>You know, lions are just like, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re too gifted.</p>
<p>Everyone hates the fucking, you know, if I went to school with you, I&rsquo;d be like, of course,</p>
<p>Lex knows the fucking answer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Lex was born smarter than me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, and you&rsquo;d probably hate me because I was the kid always seeking attention and</p>
<p>making people, it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s not interesting.</p>
<p>The guy that claws his way to the top and those are hyenas.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also fascinating just by, uh, merely who they are.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re not related to any other animal.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more closely related to cats than they are dogs, even though they look like</p>
<p>a dog.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, but they&rsquo;re very, like very tangentially related even to cats.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re their own kind of thing, which is kind of mysterious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they fully figured out and uh, they, the pseudo penis thing is the, is the,</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>Can you explain the pseudo penis?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the, it&rsquo;s a matriarchal society by the way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the unique in and of itself that this, we&rsquo;re talking about an apex predator</p>
<p>that is a matriarchal, much like, uh, you know, the praying mantis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare though.</p>
<p>And they are fucking brutal and vicious and the women are bigger and they let their cubs</p>
<p>fight, a lot of fratricide and they do that because they&rsquo;re like, Hey, you&rsquo;re weaker.</p>
<p>I let your brother kill you.</p>
<p>And uh, the women have penises, the women have pseudo penises that they give birth out</p>
<p>of and the birth is violent, but they, they roll around with just huge pieces.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re glue guns are just fucking swinging, you know, and the women are just run the show</p>
<p>and uh, it&rsquo;s just cool that they have these pseudo penises.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost romantic the way you describe it.</p>
<p>They have the strongest bite force.</p>
<p>They they pulverize bone.</p>
<p>Like when they eat an animal, the animal&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no bones.</p>
<p>They eat everything.</p>
<p>They can pulverize their bite is so powerful.</p>
<p>They pulverize bone and eat it.</p>
<p>So if they consume an animal, it, the animal was there and then the animal&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no nothing for the vultures there to, uh, to, to, to grab.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to revisit the hyenas because my experience with the heinous was from, uh,</p>
<p>first of all, history is your show, uh, has rebranded them for me, but, uh, the lion king,</p>
<p>which is, uh, a cartoon, I guess, that, uh, I get emotional at every time I, I hope that</p>
<p>probably a father issues, every guy probably just, you just have feelings.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a good guy.</p>
<p>I mean, everyone has feelings.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That one gets everybody.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I get, I get every father son movie, like blow with Johnny Depp, uh, and, uh, really</p>
<p>Yoda.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good movie.</p>
<p>And whenever there&rsquo;s like, um, like the disappointment in the father that his son has become like</p>
<p>this incredibly successful drug lord that then ends up with nothing in, in, in prison,</p>
<p>uh, just the sadness of them communicating through letters, man, it gets me every time,</p>
<p>but, but, you know, uh, there, the hyenas are not presented that well in that, um,</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re usually portrayed as like, uh, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really sad that they&rsquo;re portrayed that way as lions.</p>
<p>Like lions aren&rsquo;t dicks.</p>
<p>Lions are dicks.</p>
<p>They, the, the, the, the alpha lions will kill the cubs of another rival.</p>
<p>They do all types of dick shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, um, yeah, it&rsquo;s, uh, the hyenas are more interesting.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ll just roll in like a hyena will like, like you said, the lie, you know, cause</p>
<p>when you watch the Serengeti, you know, animals will hang out with each other.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like by water.</p>
<p>So one hyena will just kind of roll in and pretend like it&rsquo;s not hungry and then bang.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll use any means necessary to take an animal down.</p>
<p>Like lions will just use brute strength.</p>
<p>Hyenas use cunning and you can even go on the internet and find, uh, memes of this where</p>
<p>hyenas will grab the big animal by the balls and just like, we&rsquo;ll sneak up behind it and</p>
<p>bite its balls.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll watch an animal 10 size, 10 times the size of the hyena just slowly go down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brutal, but it&rsquo;s fucking hilarious.</p>
<p>So I, I think that&rsquo;s, uh, I don&rsquo;t know if you follow the channel, um, nature&rsquo;s metal</p>
<p>that, that one weighs heavy on me.</p>
<p>Um, with the hyenas on the balls, I it&rsquo;s tough to, to intellectualize it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to think that the entirety of life on earth has this history of, uh, predators</p>
<p>being violent, just like just the murder that we come from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>I, it, uh, just like when we&rsquo;re talking about meditating on death, I actually, I keep following</p>
<p>and unfollowing that Instagram channel because like sometimes it&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t continue with the day after like seeing the brutality, the honest</p>
<p>brutality of that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to make sense of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to acknowledge, I think, cause that it&rsquo;s real and we do come from that.</p>
<p>We are, we evolve from that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>We still do that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just hidden from it.</p>
<p>You know, when you go to the supermarket and get your slab of meat, you know, you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>disconnected from where that meat came from.</p>
<p>It came from that and often that&rsquo;s uglier to watch than because there&rsquo;s some honesty,</p>
<p>you know, the, the, the, the nature channels only show, uh, that&rsquo;s why we have so much</p>
<p>sympathy with the prey.</p>
<p>And this is where I think the same thing with mafia movies, they don&rsquo;t show what the mafia</p>
<p>really does.</p>
<p>They glorify the good parts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I like state of grace cause it&rsquo;s really just shaking down old people and fucking</p>
<p>being dicks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not driving nice cars and being like, you know, so, and, and animal channels do</p>
<p>the same thing.</p>
<p>They only show when the cheetah gets it because that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the exciting part.</p>
<p>But what most people don&rsquo;t know is that those predators strike out almost always a majority</p>
<p>of the time, the prey wins.</p>
<p>And so if you saw that and put it in context, you might not hate it as much when the predator</p>
<p>actually gets the little fawn or whatever, because it&rsquo;s so many fawns got away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to capture your prey.</p>
<p>And you know, we, we don&rsquo;t have the, the, the, they no, no documentary is going to sit</p>
<p>around and show you the 99 times the cheetah didn&rsquo;t catch.</p>
<p>Thank you for this perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s murder is difficult.</p>
<p>So like this is the, they never talk about for people who murder how difficult that is</p>
<p>like to trap somebody, to convince them to come back to your place, give it some respect,</p>
<p>put some respect on Ted Bundy&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to convince somebody to get in your Volkswagen Beagle and, and the cleanup.</p>
<p>And then you have to kind of plan ahead because you want to keep doing the murder, mass murder.</p>
<p>You gotta learn how to saw them up, put them in duffel bags, bury, you gotta learn to dig,</p>
<p>you gotta learn how to hide.</p>
<p>You gotta learn to lie.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a lot that goes into it that we need to put a little respect on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you have to figure out which tools work the best for the sawing and all those kinds</p>
<p>of things.</p>
<p>Um, um, so thank you for the perspective.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was hoping we would bring to this table.</p>
<p>So you, um, uh, you got a little bit Greek in you.</p>
<p>Uh, one of the episodes on, on a history hyenas, you talked about the battle of Crete where</p>
<p>the Greeks, your people in, uh, uh, in 19, I guess 41 and the early stages of the world</p>
<p>war II, there&rsquo;s one of the most epic battles of the war.</p>
<p>Uh, in fact, in 1941 in a speech made at the Reichstag, Hitler paid tribute to the bravery</p>
<p>of the Greek saying, it must be said, uh, for the sake of historical truth that amongst</p>
<p>all our opponents, only the Greeks fought with the endless courage and defiance of death.</p>
<p>So okay.</p>
<p>What do you make of this battle?</p>
<p>What do you make of the spirit of the Greek people?</p>
<p>This is one of the closest things to me because my mother was actually on the island of Crete</p>
<p>during this, the first aerial invasion in history.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So this is a very significant battle.</p>
<p>Um, first time there was an invasion from the sky, um, and, uh, my mother was a little</p>
<p>girl and she lived through four years of a Nazi occupation there.</p>
<p>So my mother was a human rights lawyer and everything, but she just always hated Germans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just what it is.</p>
<p>She hated Germans and she never got over it.</p>
<p>So the most progressive, open minded woman just could not get over this.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s a monumental battle that a lot of historians in retrospect have now looked back</p>
<p>on and said, because the Nazis, first off, you got to take it back to when Hitler instructed</p>
<p>Mussolini.</p>
<p>Cause let&rsquo;s be honest, Mussolini was Hitler&rsquo;s bitch.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It was like, if it, well, you know, if it was fantasy island, Hitler was the fucking</p>
<p>and the, and Mussolini was boss, the plane.</p>
<p>Mussolini ever say no to Hitler or even maybe it&rsquo;s always like, yes, yes, yes, we will do</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And, uh, it&rsquo;s like, yeah, it takes, you have to take Greece.</p>
<p>And so, um, yeah, so Italy being much bigger than Greece, Greece is a tiny country, nine,</p>
<p>10 million.</p>
<p>So Italy invaded Greece, um, you know, um, and Aukey day&rsquo;s a big, it&rsquo;s a big holiday</p>
<p>for Greeks.</p>
<p>And this speaks to the spirit Greeks in fight until we have a common enemy and then we unite,</p>
<p>you see it throughout history, Sparta and Athens, you see it in Greek families where</p>
<p>the brothers will fight.</p>
<p>But then as soon as we have a common enemy, we unite and maybe it&rsquo;s an overactive brain.</p>
<p>We think too much, our traditions, philosophy, and we overthink things and we fight with</p>
<p>each other and take things personally, we&rsquo;re ultra passionate.</p>
<p>But when Italy said, Hey, we&rsquo;re going to move troops through, you know, uh, a Greek said</p>
<p>Aukey, which means no, and that was, um, and then Italy attacked and, uh, we beat the shit</p>
<p>out of them.</p>
<p>A much bigger country, much, uh, more well equipped country.</p>
<p>Greece beat the shit of them, kicked them back into Albania, actually not only repelled</p>
<p>them, actually like conquered some ground in Albania, pushed them back.</p>
<p>And then Hitler was like, fuck, you know, I was planning my March to Russia, uh, but</p>
<p>I have to go down because he basically said to Mussolini, like, you know, you&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>bitch slapped.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I got to do this myself because you&rsquo;re such a fucking bitch.</p>
<p>So then the Nazis invaded Greece.</p>
<p>Obviously they took the mainland with fight and shot out.</p>
<p>The Greeks never give credit to the British and New Zealand and Australian troops that</p>
<p>were there.</p>
<p>You know, they were a large part of this, the majority of it, but the Greeks fight dude,</p>
<p>civilians.</p>
<p>I mean, they fought, you know, the Ottomans were there 400 years.</p>
<p>You go to Greece.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s no evidence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s virtually no evidence of them ever being there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Greek spirit.</p>
<p>Kick them out and we kicked out hummus too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like their culture&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>Cause Greeks are, uh, it&rsquo;s philoptimo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called philoptimo.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a real thing.</p>
<p>Philoptimo is a, it&rsquo;s very little translate.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t translate it, but it&rsquo;s kind of like honor, loyalty, friendship, uh, altruism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s, you can&rsquo;t define it, but Greeks know it and we&rsquo;re taught it from our, from</p>
<p>our, uh, families.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vibe, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Greek cultural thing and we&rsquo;re an old culture and philoptimo is what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>philoptimo.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, um, it&rsquo;s love, it&rsquo;s passion and it comes out and it comes out.</p>
<p>And so, um, so Hitler had to postpone his invasion of, um, of, uh, Russia went down</p>
<p>the island of Crete took 10 days to conquer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an island to put that in perspective, the country of France fell in three or four</p>
<p>days.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even remember cause they fucking just rolled over.</p>
<p>So what is it?</p>
<p>What does a couple of hours matter when you&rsquo;re that much of a fucking pussy?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What is a couple out in 12 hour fucking three or four days, the island of Crete took the</p>
<p>Germans 10 days to conquer.</p>
<p>And because of that, and because of the Greek resistance, Hitler had to postpone his invasion</p>
<p>of Russia to winter.</p>
<p>And of course that was, you know, that was his downfall just as it was Napoleon&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>a never dude, never try to invade Russia.</p>
<p>They got millions of people to throw at death.</p>
<p>Every time you read about Russians in history books, like, and a million died.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, you just guys throw millions of people at the problem and don&rsquo;t fuck with</p>
<p>that Russian winter and don&rsquo;t fuck with Russian people, dude, they&rsquo;re tough.</p>
<p>People in New York know that you don&rsquo;t go to fucking sheep set bay and start talking</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll end up in a fucking car trunk and they&rsquo;ll brutally murder you.</p>
<p>I do not fuck with Russians.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of people, a lot of historians argue that</p>
<p>that battle was because of the Russian winter because of delaying the Russian invasion,</p>
<p>but also psychologically delaying the invasion.</p>
<p>It was the first time, I think it was the first time the Germans failed, not, or didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>succeed like they wanted to early in the war, which is a little like psychologically the</p>
<p>impact of that I think is immeasurable.</p>
<p>And also a lot of people argue from a military strategy perspective that the, just like you</p>
<p>said, it was an aerial attack and that Hitler didn&rsquo;t think that the, that kind of attack</p>
<p>would then be useful for the rest of the war.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a really part where, whereas it might&rsquo;ve been very useful.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s really interesting how these little battles can steer the directions of</p>
<p>war.</p>
<p>Of course, me growing up in the Soviet Union, we didn&rsquo;t hear much about this battle.</p>
<p>Just like you said, millions of Soviets died.</p>
<p>All those people in history that you read about dying, those are all civilians, but</p>
<p>I mean, not all, but a very large number of them are civilians and their stories, obviously</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the rooted, the literature, the poetry, the music, just the way people talk, the way</p>
<p>they drink vodka, the way they love, the way they hate, the way they fear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all like rooted in World War II and World War I.</p>
<p>And so, but we never kind of think about Europe and we certainly, growing up, didn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about their role in the United States.</p>
<p>All this, there&rsquo;s plenty of stories of heroism in the Soviet Union, enough to, enough for</p>
<p>many lifetimes.</p>
<p>So, but it was fascinating to read from a Greek perspective, cause I, you know, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have many Greek friends, I hope you didn&rsquo;t change that.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of a love affair of your people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But likewise, the Americans don&rsquo;t hear about the Soviet contribution to the end of World</p>
<p>War II because obviously we became, you know, enemies after that because of the two systems.</p>
<p>But yeah, without the Russians, World War II wouldn&rsquo;t have been won either.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The stories are written by the victors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I, just looking at the, at history, you wonder what&rsquo;s missing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s missing that I know for a fact, cause my dad told, my dad told me</p>
<p>combat&rsquo;s hell and he would tell me the reality of what it&rsquo;s really like.</p>
<p>Guys pissing themselves, calling for their mother, the fog of war, obviously, fratricide</p>
<p>happens all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pandemonium.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s skill involved, but I mean, there&rsquo;s no, like it&rsquo;s a lot of it is just</p>
<p>luck.</p>
<p>My dad said, he, my dad won three, he got, you know, medals, braille, purple hearts,</p>
<p>all that shit.</p>
<p>And he said, the reason was, is cause you can&rsquo;t, he always said, this is another thing.</p>
<p>He told me, you can&rsquo;t pin a medal on a dead guy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, those are the guys who deserve it, but you can&rsquo;t pin a medal.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do the pomp and, and I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing is that it is written by the victors</p>
<p>and all these leaders, they say we&rsquo;re in the front.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not in the front.</p>
<p>Whenever the history books say he led his troops into battle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, did he really, did he, so then how did he live?</p>
<p>Cause they put like kids in the front, you know, it&rsquo;s like nobody limps back from the</p>
<p>front with like a injury, you know, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s army PR, you know, whenever you read,</p>
<p>you know, 27 soldiers died, 14 were injured.</p>
<p>The word injured is PR.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like injured.</p>
<p>Was he, did he sprain his ankle?</p>
<p>Did he need, did he get carried off the court or, you know, he was maimed.</p>
<p>I mean, he was like, his leg was blown off, you know, it&rsquo;s like, so, uh, I think that,</p>
<p>you know, Alexander the Great was just kind of in the back on his horse and just kind</p>
<p>of, he had his eunuch blow him a few times and he was like, is it bad up there?</p>
<p>And then like after that he was like, okay, my scribe, give me my scribe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>When you write this down, can you put me in the front?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I was just making me a big hero and I was in there and then he, you know, he just</p>
<p>blew his, you know, he had sex with his eunuch and rode off into the sunset because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just no way you survive in the front, especially warfare back then.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like brutal.</p>
<p>Then again, you have like, uh, Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>The sense I got that he was a little bit up on the front, at least the first.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or is that also, is he a little bit Alexander the Great?</p>
<p>Give me my scribe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all lore.</p>
<p>I mean, you ever play the game of telephone?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, you know, there&rsquo;s no video cameras back then.</p>
<p>So shit just get, turns into myth, you know, and, uh, there&rsquo;s no way he was in the front.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way he wouldn&rsquo;t have lived.</p>
<p>You know, he was probably good on horseback cause those, those dudes were good on horseback.</p>
<p>But it was like game of Thrones back then.</p>
<p>You had all these different people and they kind of, yeah, the, the, the Mongols were</p>
<p>wild dude.</p>
<p>They are actually said like, um, they started like they were more adaptable to the horse</p>
<p>because they were so good on horseback that kids started to be born like kind of bow legged</p>
<p>like to fit the horse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wild.</p>
<p>And they would stretch their heads and shit like that.</p>
<p>They wrap them and stretch their heads.</p>
<p>So they find like Mongol skulls and they look like cone heads and they were brutal and vicious</p>
<p>and they would maraud and rape and all the fun stuff that, you know, when, you know,</p>
<p>when you visit other places back then, there&rsquo;s no tchotchke stops and souvenir shops.</p>
<p>What you do is you take women and those are the tokens, you know, you burn a few huts</p>
<p>different.</p>
<p>Tourism was different back then.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another difficult thing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about nature and predators to think about the long stretch of history</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re just murder and we made so much progress, I guess, in the past couple of centuries.</p>
<p>The United States is a shining example of that.</p>
<p>But do you think also that it&rsquo;s that effect that we were, a lot of good things had to</p>
<p>happen too or else we wouldn&rsquo;t be here.</p>
<p>So do we just focus, isn&rsquo;t it like a car crash effect that like we&rsquo;re, you know, the rubber</p>
<p>neck that everyone pulls over to see a car crash, are we just only focusing on the negative</p>
<p>things of history because they&rsquo;re just more exciting to us?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just not, it&rsquo;s boring to be like, yeah, and then there was a bunch of villagers</p>
<p>and they ate every day and danced and loved.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wonder, I wonder how different those people were, you know, like they might&rsquo;ve had the</p>
<p>same exact loves and fears and like they perhaps had the same kind of brilliant ideas in their</p>
<p>head, if not more brilliant.</p>
<p>And we kind of think about like this moment in history is like the most special moment.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re doing the coolest shit that we&rsquo;re doing the most amazing building and most amazing</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>But maybe they were building amazing things in their different way with like less technological,</p>
<p>but in the space of ideas, in the space of just all the different, the camaraderie and</p>
<p>the space of like concepts, mathematics, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, Greece, you look at the architecture, it still stands up.</p>
<p>I mean, all the government, but it&rsquo;s still arguably, I mean, as far as objective beauty,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to argue that Greco Roman, it&rsquo;s just something about it with the, with the</p>
<p>columns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t know, even Ayn Rand would probably appreciate it.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t, no, no, no.</p>
<p>So in your history, hyenas that unfortunately has come to an end, we&rsquo;re talking about empires</p>
<p>coming to an end, all empires fall.</p>
<p>That one, it may rise again.</p>
<p>Empires might rise again.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>I, I&rsquo;m obviously a fan, so I hope it does rise again, but you&rsquo;ve seemed to develop your</p>
<p>own language.</p>
<p>Can you, you know, it&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>What is, what is that?</p>
<p>What the hell, is this some kind of medical condition or can you, can you explain like</p>
<p>the linguistic essentials that catch us up to the linguistic essentials that people need</p>
<p>to know to understand the way you speak?</p>
<p>You know, Leopold and Loeb, you know the story of those two, they murdered that kid and they</p>
<p>had this weird relationship.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s an interesting thing to Google, Leopold and Loeb, these two guys who ended</p>
<p>up murdering a kid because they developed their own language with each other and this</p>
<p>own reality and this weird thing and they wanted to know what it&rsquo;s like to murder a</p>
<p>kid and they murder a kid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a famous story in American lore and history or whatever, famous case.</p>
<p>But this phenomenon, yeah, me and Chris got together.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t as dark as Leopold and Loeb, we didn&rsquo;t murder a kid, but we murdered a podcast.</p>
<p>Or at least stabbed it a few times.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, it was something in the organic chemistry of me and Chris that I think we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>both end up appreciating even probably more than we do now that it&rsquo;s mysterious.</p>
<p>I got to be honest with you, it&rsquo;s, it was a thing that it wasn&rsquo;t conscious, wasn&rsquo;t intentional.</p>
<p>It was something that happened in the music of our energies that just went.</p>
<p>Like when you hear someone sing or when a jazz band hits a rhythm or even when I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>stage and I just catch a rhythm, it&rsquo;s like, dude, I didn&rsquo;t make a choice there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it, but it comes from somewhere else and I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beyond my comprehension.</p>
<p>But with Chris, there was this magical chemistry that, you know, I have chemistry with a lot</p>
<p>of people and it can be funny and I feel zero chemistry here.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit more intelligent than what me and Chris did.</p>
<p>But you know, me and Chris, I think we connected on the funny bone.</p>
<p>Like I, he, I found him so funny and we found the same things funny.</p>
<p>And from that, these organic expressions came from some part of our brains that was created</p>
<p>from this chemistry.</p>
<p>And yeah, we just developed this language and this cult following and people were really</p>
<p>upset when we ended.</p>
<p>But it was the right thing to end because like all things that end, it was kind of done</p>
<p>a few episodes even before we finished.</p>
<p>And I think we pulled the plug before it started rolling downhill, like all, you know, like</p>
<p>all great flings, you know, there&rsquo;s your long relation, long marriages are boring and comfortable.</p>
<p>The one you really like fucking always ends abruptly and sadly and, but you always look</p>
<p>back and you jerk off to it.</p>
<p>And so you guys made love and we made, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it was like a hot fling with me and him and it was intense and we burned</p>
<p>the candle at both ends.</p>
<p>And it was, I think that podcast was meant to be three years and maybe people will go</p>
<p>back and appreciate it and listen to it over and over again.</p>
<p>And I think the new things we do, people will love, I&rsquo;m doing long days now, that podcast</p>
<p>and people seem to enjoy it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying the long days on YouTube.</p>
<p>I just found myself just like staring at you ranting for, same with Tim Dillon, I really</p>
<p>enjoyed the, whatever those rants are, the genius of just one thing after the other.</p>
<p>But definitely the chemistry, almost as a study, I remember the reason I first started</p>
<p>listening to it, I was trying to get a perspective on certain historical moments.</p>
<p>Like it was interesting.</p>
<p>I tuned in to learn history.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I came for the history and like stayed for the chaos and the crack open and clean out.</p>
<p>And yeah, this, it was almost, I listened to Rogan like this sometimes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll relisten to an episode to try to understand why was this so fun to listen to?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like trying to analyze humor or something like that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s nice from a conversational perspective, like why was this so easy to listen to?</p>
<p>And with History of Hyenas, like why is the chemistry so good?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Cause there&rsquo;s not many podcasts like, I don&rsquo;t know any with the chemistry like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of sad that the fling with a prostitute in Vegas has to end, you know?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what makes it special.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Bukowski thing with the fog.</p>
<p>The British Office, one of my favorite shows was that it ended very quick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a couple of seasons or something like that.</p>
<p>And that was tragic, but that took guts to just end it.</p>
<p>Given all the money you could have made, given all the, you just end it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes it truly special.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you, man, I&rsquo;ll just emphasize it.</p>
<p>Cause I marvel at it too.</p>
<p>Cause as a guy who tries to always figure out what the causes of things, I gotta be</p>
<p>honest, man.</p>
<p>Looking back on that, even with retrospective wisdom, you know, that 2020 hindsight, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been done a couple of months now, it&rsquo;s something that I can&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that I don&rsquo;t know how you quantify it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you describe it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s musical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really kind of rhythmic.</p>
<p>Maybe like a Netflix show about history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the future with the two of you.</p>
<p>You guys will meet like the way you meet with a fling like a decade from now at a diner</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re both way fatter and uglier and then you just reminisce over some cigarettes</p>
<p>and coffee.</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely a classic podcast that people can go back and appreciate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fast paced and it was unique.</p>
<p>What was it like to research for, I mean, it was really scholarly, the depth of research</p>
<p>that you performed.</p>
<p>It sometimes felt like you almost read an entire Wikipedia article beforehand.</p>
<p>Or like.</p>
<p>Exactly true.</p>
<p>We were, we were one fan, we attracted such funny people to that podcast and the fans</p>
<p>were so funny and one fan called us nicknamed as Wikipedia sluts.</p>
<p>And so it just stuck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We just would read Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I would do a lot more research than Chris.</p>
<p>And so I would actually, you know, once in a while he&rsquo;d get into it too.</p>
<p>But for very interesting episodes, I got some subject matter would just pull me in.</p>
<p>Like Bernie Madoff, just to think of one that was recent, it was one of our last ones.</p>
<p>And I think one of our better episodes and I&rsquo;m glad that it kind of ended after that</p>
<p>because it was rare to, I think we started to slip a little bit.</p>
<p>I got fascinated and I got, I did a lot of research for Bernie Madoff, but usually, yeah,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d pull up Wikipedia and we&rsquo;d have fun.</p>
<p>We were sort of the antithesis of Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>I mean, you went to Dan Carlin for accuracy and thoughtfulness and you went to us for,</p>
<p>it was a hang with history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why history hyenas was such an appropriate name because it was, it was a little bit of</p>
<p>history.</p>
<p>Some, some episodes were more hyena, more wild and a little history and some were a</p>
<p>little more dense, like the battle of Crete and less hyena.</p>
<p>So you were, you were always going to get both, you&rsquo;re either going to get a majority</p>
<p>of one or the other.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Dan Carlin is the lion, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you guys, predictably good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, what, what are your thoughts about, I mean, he&rsquo;s a storyteller too.</p>
<p>He gets a lot of criticism for the, from the historians, quote unquote.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he likes to knock.</p>
<p>He keeps saying he&rsquo;s not a historian, but what&rsquo;s your, what are your thoughts about</p>
<p>the hardcore history with Dan Carlin?</p>
<p>Like, was he an inspiration to the podcast you were doing or, or like an account, like</p>
<p>a, almost like a reverse psychology inspiration where you wanted to do some kind of opposing</p>
<p>type of podcast in history or was history always just like a, a launching pad to just</p>
<p>talk shit about human nature?</p>
<p>More of the latter.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t even aware of his podcast when we started.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so we, it was just very organic, again, like the chemistry, me and Chris became very</p>
<p>good friends.</p>
<p>We started the podcast.</p>
<p>First we did a web series called Bay Ridge Boys, which has its sort of little cult following.</p>
<p>We did like five episodes and ended it.</p>
<p>And then we did the podcast and hi, hyenas were my favorite animal and I talk about them</p>
<p>passionately and I told Chris about them and then he started appreciating them and we both</p>
<p>love history.</p>
<p>I majored in history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things I love.</p>
<p>I go to museums all the time.</p>
<p>I go to his, I do history tours, so does he.</p>
<p>And so it was just sort of a natural, let&rsquo;s do a history podcast and it gave us something</p>
<p>to talk about each episode to sort of lean our, you know, hang our hats on and, and riff</p>
<p>off of.</p>
<p>So it had nothing to do with dance.</p>
<p>What I think about dance, I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I think even if he&rsquo;s inaccurate in the opinions of the historical community, it starts conversations,</p>
<p>which is good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this thing where people go, oh, it&rsquo;s dangerous rhetoric.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, rhetoric only becomes dangerous when education fails.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on in America is education has failed.</p>
<p>So if you call someone online dangerous, it&rsquo;s not him that&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fucking stupid people that&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the fault of this country.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t listen to Aristotle.</p>
<p>The future of a civilization depends on public education and we failed.</p>
<p>Education has failed.</p>
<p>Kids are, kids are not interested in shit.</p>
<p>And so in some sense, those dance podcasts and podcasts can be incredibly educational.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s a, the storytelling that pulls you in ultimately leads to you internalizing</p>
<p>these stories and like remembering them and thinking through them and all those kinds</p>
<p>of things that is much more powerful than you book on history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>I think often it inspires you to go learn more.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I know we did that.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I, people would go, Hey, I went and learned about this because they</p>
<p>knew with us, there was no pretense, which was great that we had no standard.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, nobody came to us for historical accuracy, but I was kind of turned on by the</p>
<p>fact that it inspired people to go learn about this stuff or to at least know like Battle</p>
<p>of Crete, like you said, a very underappreciated battle.</p>
<p>Even Winston Churchill said from here on, we will no longer say that Greeks fight like</p>
<p>heroes, but heroes fight like Greeks.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a monumental battle and you know, not talked about enough.</p>
<p>And I, our podcast would inspire people to go actually learn more, to go listen to Dan</p>
<p>Carlin or to go pick up a book or to do research on their own.</p>
<p>And so I think podcasts, Dan Carlin&rsquo;s obviously much more accurate than us, but it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>that people are going to podcasts like yours and to learn shit.</p>
<p>Joe was, is really like the progenitor of that.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, having intellectuals on and getting the public interested with this</p>
<p>new medium in, in people who are intelligent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Cause you know, what the mainstream press pushes out is horseshit, gorgeous horseshit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a beautiful veneer, but no substance.</p>
<p>And so this, this is a nice pushback.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The authenticity of Joe&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m through, I started listening from the very beginning, you know, doing my in</p>
<p>grad school, you know, like a technical person and he just pulled me in.</p>
<p>And made me curious to learn about all kinds of things and use my own critical reasoning</p>
<p>skills on some of the bullshit guests he&rsquo;s had and some of the most inspiring guests</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had.</p>
<p>And so I teach you to think, can you, I don&rsquo;t know much about Bernie Madoff as a small tangent.</p>
<p>Can you, can you tell me who the hell is Bernie Madoff?</p>
<p>Oh, Bernie Madoff is the GOAT.</p>
<p>The greatest thief of all time, dude.</p>
<p>Hedge fund guy, ran a hedge fund and pulled, stole the most money in the history of America.</p>
<p>I mean a con artist and he does, people obviously he&rsquo;s become, he&rsquo;s a household name because</p>
<p>of the magnitude of his crime, but you got to appreciate, again, you got to appreciate</p>
<p>what went into this and how long he was able to pull it off by tricking the smartest and</p>
<p>richest people in the world and a brilliant scam.</p>
<p>The con man, con man is short for confidence man.</p>
<p>And it came from, yeah, a con man, basically they exude confidence and they trick people</p>
<p>by playing on their ego and blind spots.</p>
<p>And the word comes from a guy, I can&rsquo;t remember where, but what he used to do, I can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>the guy&rsquo;s name, whatever, you can Google it, con man.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>The first con man that is on record, what he would do, he would go to very rich people</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d be very well dressed, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d go, I bet you, you don&rsquo;t have the confidence to give me your watch.</p>
<p>And he would play on the egos of these very powerful and rich people and they would give</p>
<p>them the watch for some reason, some sort of reverse psychology bullshit.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d take the watch and he would just steal it because basically saying like, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the confidence to give me the watch because you don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;m going to give it back.</p>
<p>And he would just take it.</p>
<p>So Bernie Madoff was a very sophisticated con man.</p>
<p>And again, we were talking about people pretending to be the opposite of what they are.</p>
<p>And he hid his thievery in how available he was to his clients, how he would show up at</p>
<p>every bar mitzvah, every birthday, he was always available for their phone calls.</p>
<p>And he played on their egos.</p>
<p>He made it so people wanted to invest in him, like they were competing.</p>
<p>He made it very exclusive.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t just take anyone.</p>
<p>And there was a method behind that madness because he wanted the whales that wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>notice that he had this pyramid scheme going.</p>
<p>And so what he would do is he would just rob from the richer and he just kept, it was like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d pay back the richer with the guy who was a little, and it was a pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>And he was able to do it for so long and steal so much money.</p>
<p>And he would win people over with the scheme because with that scheme, he was the only</p>
<p>guy who could provide, who could guarantee like a 1% return even during times of recession.</p>
<p>And because he was such a good con man, he hijacked people&rsquo;s reasoning with his charm.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what con artists do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what psychopaths do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so fucking charming.</p>
<p>They get you in that Volkswagen Beetle.</p>
<p>Because if they use their reasoning for one second, they&rsquo;d go, hey, nobody can provide</p>
<p>1% returns during recessions.</p>
<p>How the fuck is this guy doing it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you how he&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s stealing from another guy to pay you.</p>
<p>You fucking idiot.</p>
<p>So charisma is essential to that.</p>
<p>Maybe you can help explain something to me, something I have been affected by.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting way too loud for your listeners, there&rsquo;s going to be comments like, tell this</p>
<p>guy to calm down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m Greek, I&rsquo;m positive.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Something that I have been thinking about and have encountered indirectly is Jeffrey</p>
<p>Epstein.</p>
<p>And I have a sense because of MIT, because of all the other people that have been touched,</p>
<p>the wrong term, by Jeffrey Epstein in the sense that literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>And it always felt to me like there&rsquo;s not a deep conspiracy, I don&rsquo;t know, but it felt</p>
<p>to me like it&rsquo;s not some deeply rooted conspiracy where like Eric Weinstein thinks that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some probability that Jeffrey Epstein is a front for like an intelligence agency, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Israeli or the CIA, I don&rsquo;t know, but is a front for something much, much bigger.</p>
<p>And then I always thought that he&rsquo;s just, maybe you can correct me, but more of the</p>
<p>Bernie Madoff variety, where he&rsquo;s just a charismatic guy who maybe is psychopathic in some sense,</p>
<p>so you know, also a pedophile, but just charismatic and is able to convince people of that 1%</p>
<p>of any idea that in the case of scientists is able to convince these people that their</p>
<p>ideas matter.</p>
<p>So one thing scientists don&rsquo;t really, you know, despite what people say, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>they care about money as much as people think.</p>
<p>I mean, people are ridiculous when they think that, yeah, that&rsquo;s why people get into science</p>
<p>for the money.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>The personalities that get into science are obsessed with minutia and they do the scientific</p>
<p>method.</p>
<p>You know how boring that is?</p>
<p>Like you have to have a love for it in order to do it.</p>
<p>But the thing, what drives you is for your ideas to be then heard.</p>
<p>Like when a rich guy comes over, probably super charismatic, is going to tell you that</p>
<p>your ideas, especially for some of these outsiders at MIT, at Harvard, at Caltech, all these</p>
<p>like sort of big science, like physics, biology, artificial intelligence, computing fields,</p>
<p>to hear somebody say that your ideas are brilliant and ideas matter, it&rsquo;s pretty powerful, especially</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve been an outsider.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s talked to a bunch of people who had outsider ideas.</p>
<p>You know, the big negative for me of modern academia is that most people, actually like</p>
<p>most communities, most people think the same and there&rsquo;s just these brilliant outsiders</p>
<p>and the outsiders are just derided.</p>
<p>And so when you have Jeffrey Epstein, like a hyena, sorry, sorry, sorry, going on the</p>
<p>outside and picking off these brilliant minds that are the outsiders, he can use charisma</p>
<p>to convince them to collaborate with him, to take his funding and then thereby he builds</p>
<p>a reputation, like slowly accumulates these people that actually results in a network</p>
<p>of like some of those brilliant people in the world, you know, and then pulls in people</p>
<p>like Bill Gates and I don&rsquo;t know, political figures.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that one person can do that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, look at Hitler, charisma is blinding.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what Kahneman, speaking of Bernie Madoff, that&rsquo;s one of their major tools</p>
<p>is flattery, glib, superficial charm.</p>
<p>It creates those blind spots.</p>
<p>People want to hear how great they are.</p>
<p>They want to be flattered.</p>
<p>It takes your defenses down, plays to our ego, how much we&rsquo;re all just pieces of garbage</p>
<p>and want to hear how great we are.</p>
<p>We want that love from our mother and our father.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Freudian and they know because they&rsquo;re not burdened with that need, they&rsquo;re not burdened</p>
<p>with that empathy or emotions and they just see things very calculatively.</p>
<p>They play, they know that we&rsquo;re prey in their game and they use that against us and that</p>
<p>is why someone who is not that intelligent, like Hitler, can probably convince a lot more</p>
<p>intelligent people, you know, and that&rsquo;s why we can&rsquo;t give Tim Dillon power because then,</p>
<p>you know, he already stands on a stage.</p>
<p>I mean, if we let that guy, I mean, he will just take over a country and everyone who</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t cook well will be eliminated.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>I wonder why he keeps complimenting me when we&rsquo;re in private.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Be careful.</p>
<p>He looks at me just, I like your suit.</p>
<p>I like the cut of your jib.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>You gotta be careful of that kid.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Hitler.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s crazy to think about&hellip;</p>
<p>Clip that, please.</p>
<p>Internet.</p>
<p>I mean, Quentin Tarantino said it to Pat, I mean, in his script, personality goes a long</p>
<p>way, dude.</p>
<p>I mean, personality can usurp common sense and reason of the smartest people.</p>
<p>These absolute smartest people can be hypnotized.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like a sexy woman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can just, you can be tricked because we have such a blind spot for, you</p>
<p>know, for flattery.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a BBC documentary on, I think it&rsquo;s called something like Charisma, Hitler&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Charisma or something like that.</p>
<p>It was quite, I mean, that one focused more about the power of the speeches.</p>
<p>But I wonder if most of the success or the rise of Hitler and the Third Reich had to</p>
<p>do with the charisma of Hitler when he&rsquo;s alone in a room with somebody, with the generals,</p>
<p>just one on one.</p>
<p>Like, I wonder if that&rsquo;s the essential element of just being able to just look into a person&rsquo;s</p>
<p>eyes, like flatter them or whatever is needed to earn their trust and then convince them</p>
<p>of anything you want.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the one piece of history we don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We do know that the kid crushed.</p>
<p>I mean, he was a headliner.</p>
<p>He got up there and his hair would flop.</p>
<p>I mean, he crushed it.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s certain elements about nationalism and pride that are really powerful.</p>
<p>Like a lot of us humans, I think, long for that, for the feeling of belonging.</p>
<p>And when some charismatic leader makes us feel like we belong to a group, the amount</p>
<p>of evil we can do to other humans because of that, it&rsquo;s endless.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to look and nobody wants to do the work to be better or look at where they</p>
<p>messed up.</p>
<p>Why does it always have to be the Jews that escape?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, get over it, guys.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like they killed Jesus.</p>
<p>You get over it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long time ago.</p>
<p>I mean, move on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jewish.</p>
<p>I understand because we do run the central banks.</p>
<p>And the weather.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget about the weather.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a funny one that people created.</p>
<p>Like, who gives a shit?</p>
<p>What is the weather?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the importance of the weather?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>The Jews made it rain outside.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>You got to fuck.</p>
<p>You know, they made it snow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You get a day off.</p>
<p>Thank the Jews.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, there&rsquo;s certain conspiracies that make me like flat earth.</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the motive?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the motivation for lying that the earth is round?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the conspiracy?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What does anyone get out of that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is exactly the profit?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the strategy?</p>
<p>Do you have any, from a historical perspective or just a human perspective, conspiracy theories</p>
<p>you connect with?</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re not necessarily conspiratorial?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily conspiratorial.</p>
<p>Nobody cares that much.</p>
<p>But then, you know, what happens is you find out this one or this two, and you start questioning</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>And you start questioning everything, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, the Vietnam War started, that was a lie.</p>
<p>That was a false flag.</p>
<p>And then next thing you know, everything&rsquo;s a false flag.</p>
<p>There are some strange things on 9 11.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some strange things from a scientific perspective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no scientist, but it&rsquo;s like, you know, yeah, three steel framed skyscrapers falling</p>
<p>on the same day in the same way.</p>
<p>A lot of people say, oh, they were hit by planes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, but that&rsquo;s not why they fell.</p>
<p>They fell because of fires and usually, not usually, all the time, except for three times.</p>
<p>And there was buildings that have burned for longer than that.</p>
<p>And there might be good explanations, but the lack of transparency, it&rsquo;s like, I feel</p>
<p>like government.</p>
<p>And building seven&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I mean, the way it kind of died, just a neat, just a neat, the physical, I mean, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a scientist.</p>
<p>Is that, well, I don&rsquo;t, I, is there resistance from the steel and free fall, not all scientists</p>
<p>know everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a computer guy.</p>
<p>Cause I had some questions I wanted to ask you about my biology, but yeah, so exactly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand biology.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the melting point of steel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;m just the common sense human that looks at government and institutions</p>
<p>when they try to communicate.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain human element where you can sense that there&rsquo;s dishonesty going</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>And dishonesty might not be deeply rooted in a conspiracy theory and something malevolent.</p>
<p>It might just be rooted more likely to me in a basic fear of losing your job.</p>
<p>So when you have a bunch of people that are afraid of losing their job, you know, and</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t want to like the origins of the virus, whether it came from a lab or not,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s a pretty, I know a lot of biologists behind a closed doors that, that</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s very likely it was leaked from the lab.</p>
<p>But like, they don&rsquo;t want to talk about it because there&rsquo;s not good evidence either way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly you&rsquo;re just using common sense.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re waiting for good evidence to come out in either direction.</p>
<p>But just like nobody in positions of institutional, like centralized power wants to just honestly</p>
<p>say, we don&rsquo;t know, or on the point of masks or all those kinds of things to say, you know,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the best evidence we have.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not sure we&rsquo;re trying to figure that out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re desperately trying to figure that out or just like honesty, especially in the modern</p>
<p>day, that&rsquo;s the hope I have for the 21st centuries.</p>
<p>People seem to detect bullshit much, much better because of the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Internet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we seem to&hellip;</p>
<p>But they also believe crazy shit too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no Yang without a Yang, I guess.</p>
<p>But I think the conspiracy theories arise only when the people in positions of power</p>
<p>and government institutions are full of shit.</p>
<p>Like the air will be taken out of the conspiracy theories if the people in elected power would</p>
<p>be much more honest.</p>
<p>Like just like real.</p>
<p>Yeah, people like Andrew Yang, whatever you think about him, just more honest.</p>
<p>He just like says whatever the hell comes to mind.</p>
<p>By the way, he&rsquo;s running for New York mayor.</p>
<p>Mayor, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have opinions?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s no good.</p>
<p>I like Andrew Yang and it&rsquo;s no good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be honest with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a lifelong New Yorker.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a New Yorker.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re a New Yorker, so nothing&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Well, something is good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest about New York.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very socially liberal place.</p>
<p>It is the head of the snake.</p>
<p>New York is the country.</p>
<p>If New York, when New York&rsquo;s not doing good, country&rsquo;s not doing good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most important city, DC, New York.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really Rome.</p>
<p>Be honest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, maybe I&rsquo;m biased.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We just, New Yorkers, we walk around everywhere and we go, this is just like New York, but</p>
<p>not New York.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, but New York needs, and I&rsquo;m a guy who leans left.</p>
<p>You know, I just, I lean left and that&rsquo;s just what it is.</p>
<p>A dictator?</p>
<p>Is that where you&rsquo;re going?</p>
<p>No, we need.</p>
<p>Are we going back to Stalin again?</p>
<p>We need, it&rsquo;s a money town.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be, come on, man.</p>
<p>I mean, New York is a money town.</p>
<p>And Wall Street, and then when AOC and her cronies at the local level rejected that Amazon</p>
<p>thing, you&rsquo;re going like, what do you think makes cities?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to create jobs in the 21st century?</p>
<p>What do we need?</p>
<p>More nail salons?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>More pizza places?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re living in the tech revolution and you know, whatever your opinions are</p>
<p>about Jeff Bezos, that&rsquo;s the world, tech.</p>
<p>And they want you to come here.</p>
<p>Of course you give them tax breaks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why companies go anywhere.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s so fucking utopian and that progressive wing is so utopian and that always ends in</p>
<p>disaster because it&rsquo;s not rooted in reality.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t accept the reality that people are self interested.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re going to do this 14%, 15% tax hike on people making a million dollars more.</p>
<p>In New York City, a million dollars is not that much.</p>
<p>So people are going to flee New York.</p>
<p>The tax base is going to flee.</p>
<p>New York&rsquo;s going to fall to shit like it did before.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying it basically needs a more capitalist front, like capitalistic type of</p>
<p>thinker.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Bloomberg, Giuliani when he was still sane and his hair wasn&rsquo;t melting off his face.</p>
<p>Prosecutor.</p>
<p>You need a tough, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happened to that guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s lost it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to watch.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to watch him be just like, uh, Trump&rsquo;s lackey.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, boy, whatever you want, boss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say whatever you want, boss.</p>
<p>But New York is a money town that needs a money guy and sort of more of a Republican.</p>
<p>I have to say on the local level, as more of a guy who leans left, I&rsquo;ll just be honest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough city that needs a tough mayor, not some guy who&rsquo;s going like, I understand</p>
<p>we all need free money.</p>
<p>You know, Andrew Yang I think is right in the big picture because all the real jobs</p>
<p>are somewhere else.</p>
<p>You look at those Asian cities, you go like, oh, that&rsquo;s what our cities used to look like</p>
<p>at the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>You know, there was like, there was jobs and people were making things here.</p>
<p>Now you look at those cities in Asia and you&rsquo;re going like, wow.</p>
<p>And then you go to Detroit and you&rsquo;re like, yeah, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>You go to Cleveland, you go, we were done.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t actually, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>The reason I really like Andrew Yang is I&rsquo;ve learned a lot every time he talks, like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not his opinions.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just giving a lot of data, like information, which I just start a podcast.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t run for mayor.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>He already has a podcast.</p>
<p>I think Yang speaks.</p>
<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Who does it?</p>
<p>Who does it now?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way we communicate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even talk to people unless it&rsquo;s on a podcast.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Listen, man, I&rsquo;m a, I&rsquo;m not going to criticize that because there is something like I talked</p>
<p>to my dad on a podcast for four hours and I&rsquo;m not sure I would ever talk to him in the</p>
<p>way we talked without the podcast.</p>
<p>What does he do?</p>
<p>Uh, physicist.</p>
<p>Oh shit.</p>
<p>But like, yeah, it&rsquo;s a episode 100.</p>
<p>And you know, I, uh, the, the way I recorded that podcast is I tried to put my ego aside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really tough to talk to your dad, especially because you&rsquo;re giving him</p>
<p>a platform.</p>
<p>Uh, especially, so at that time there&rsquo;s already a bit of a platform for this podcast.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this, as a son, you think like, oh, here it goes with this bullshit again.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the natural son thought you have.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I wanted to, the way I thought about it is in 20 years when I look</p>
<p>back, like I want to do a conversation where I&rsquo;m happy with it, you know?</p>
<p>So I want to make him shine.</p>
<p>But I also called him out on like, why were you so distant, like, like all of that kind</p>
<p>of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to do, but it was really important to do.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to do it without a, without a microphone.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Listen, how often do we sit there and just focus our attention and just look at the other</p>
<p>person?</p>
<p>I, I don&rsquo;t know, man.</p>
<p>This is not even recording right now.</p>
<p>I just invited you over.</p>
<p>Just so we could actually, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The podcast does make, like I listen, I&rsquo;ve been listening to every word you&rsquo;ve been saying.</p>
<p>And if we weren&rsquo;t doing a podcast, I might be looking at my phone or being self conscious</p>
<p>about something else or nervous or anxious, especially with people close to you.</p>
<p>I mean, that was, I recommend that actually for people to talk to their family on a podcast</p>
<p>or like a fake or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>It made me realize that there&rsquo;s a clear distinction between the conversations we usually have</p>
<p>with humans and those we have when a podcast is being recorded.</p>
<p>What the fuck were we talking on before that?</p>
<p>I knew you were going to lose your train of thought on that one because that&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a motion behind that one.</p>
<p>A podcast with dad is going to take, that&rsquo;s going to take you to a place that took you</p>
<p>to a place.</p>
<p>It took you outside of interviewer.</p>
<p>New York.</p>
<p>It went to a place.</p>
<p>New York and Yang.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In New York and Yang.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what really surprised me about, I like the psychoanalysis that you just threw in</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I knew that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That took you to a place.</p>
<p>So Andrew Yang mentioned.</p>
<p>Do you respect me now, dad?</p>
<p>MIT, is it enough?</p>
<p>Fucking million people listening to this.</p>
<p>I got 14 Rogans.</p>
<p>Is it enough, dad?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m creating robots.</p>
<p>Is it enough for you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never enough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what drives you probably.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably what drives me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what gives meaning to life is it&rsquo;s never enough.</p>
<p>And I hope to pass that on to my kids one day.</p>
<p>That nothing&rsquo;s ever enough.</p>
<p>Whether they&rsquo;re robot or human, right?</p>
<p>Your kids.</p>
<p>Most likely.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>Robot.</p>
<p>You might call one of your robot.</p>
<p>Do you love your robot?</p>
<p>Are you starting to love your&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it going to be like that Pygmalion thing?</p>
<p>You create them and then they kill you.</p>
<p>But even while they&rsquo;re killing you, you got a tear.</p>
<p>The tear.</p>
<p>A slow one.</p>
<p>One tear.</p>
<p>And just.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why are you doing this Frankenstein?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>But I loved you.</p>
<p>Those would be the last words out of my mouth.</p>
<p>I just want to mention something on the, that it costs $400,000.</p>
<p>Over $400,000 per year to support one person in prison in New York.</p>
<p>Like when I heard that number, it was really confusing to me.</p>
<p>Like that it costs that much, 400K per person.</p>
<p>And it was really refreshing to hear a politician describe a particular problem with data.</p>
<p>That this is this prison industrial complex, whatever the hell it is.</p>
<p>And whether the solution, it&rsquo;s unclear what the solution is.</p>
<p>I think he has solutions, but just the honesty of presenting that information was refreshing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure a capitalistic person would solve that.</p>
<p>Those kinds of problems he might make worse.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of capitalism.</p>
<p>I think the free market is the way we make progress in this world, but it seems to go</p>
<p>wrong in certain directions.</p>
<p>Like the military industrial complex, the prison industrial complex, anything that ends</p>
<p>with industrial complex.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if all of the problems, you&rsquo;re basically saying, let&rsquo;s put New York&rsquo;s problems</p>
<p>aside.</p>
<p>We need to have New York shine first to do what it does best.</p>
<p>Essentially.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then we will fix them, well, and then we can focus on the problems.</p>
<p>But if you just say like, here&rsquo;s a problem, here&rsquo;s a problem, here&rsquo;s a problem, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>make sure we have the safety net that protects us against all of these kinds of problems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to, that&rsquo;s going to kill the city, the spirit of the city that is in</p>
<p>your biased opinion, the Rome of the world.</p>
<p>That said, a lot of people are fleeing New York.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why I say it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality of the situation is, you know, I&rsquo;m all for the public good, but yeah,</p>
<p>there needs to be a back to that Greek expression, pan metroniris, and I also think the free</p>
<p>market is responsible for progress.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the most natural thing, the thing that&rsquo;s most aligned with human nature, which</p>
<p>is self interest.</p>
<p>And which I&rsquo;m not to the extent that Ayn Rand would, but I do believe people are mostly</p>
<p>self interested, especially with one gun to the head, morals are out the window, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about survival.</p>
<p>So, you know, create a system that respects that and acknowledges that, but socialism</p>
<p>works very well, at least right now, as a check as to temper the excesses of capitalism</p>
<p>and in certain scenarios is the more appropriate system, you know, in a vacuum.</p>
<p>So one being prisons or, you know, you know, governance, you know, parks.</p>
<p>Maybe even, well, and this is a difficult one, but in healthcare, healthcare, it&rsquo;s unclear</p>
<p>what to write.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of debates there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Doctors want boats.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I guess you&rsquo;re voting for AOC you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not voting for AOC, but I do, it&rsquo;s just a tough one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough one.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the Hippocratic Oath, it&rsquo;s like, how do you turn people away, man?</p>
<p>How do you do that to people?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a tough thing to reconcile helping people, curing people with the marketplace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I can understand why that one&rsquo;s so tough.</p>
<p>And then you got hypochondriacs, of course, who drain the system, you know, like people</p>
<p>who are having anxiety, like me who had COVID and called 14, you know, I called 14 ambulances.</p>
<p>So and then of course we&rsquo;re fat and the free market made us fat because it played the marketing</p>
<p>made us want all this junk food and that&rsquo;s a burden on the healthcare system.</p>
<p>So we got to do something about that.</p>
<p>We got to get creative.</p>
<p>We need new thinkers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be one of them.</p>
<p>When you go to a fast food restaurant, you stand on a scale.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re over a certain thing, you can&rsquo;t be served.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for the healthcare system.</p>
<p>You know, you just handed a salad and say, sorry, this burger is illegal for right now.</p>
<p>If you achieve these certain BMI goals, then you can, you can have this burger, but right</p>
<p>now you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the state&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>To regulate our freedoms.</p>
<p>No slurpees.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m with you to go along.</p>
<p>I think the salads are too expensive.</p>
<p>They should be subsidized.</p>
<p>If you, if you go to like a fast food joint, the burger is always going to be cheaper than</p>
<p>the salad.</p>
<p>And this does not make sense.</p>
<p>We should run on this platform.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be your vice president or ban burgers for, for people of a certain weight and make</p>
<p>salads cheap.</p>
<p>Three day work weeks.</p>
<p>Why has that not happened yet?</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Where are you going with this one?</p>
<p>Dude, good for the economy.</p>
<p>Stimulates the economy, right?</p>
<p>More shifts, creates more jobs, more people spending because they have more leisure time,</p>
<p>boosts the leisure economy, you know?</p>
<p>Why are we still doing the five day work week that, that was, that was tempered from the</p>
<p>seven day work week.</p>
<p>That was, so the seven, it used to be seven day work week, it used to be like, and people</p>
<p>who are just these libertarians, it&rsquo;s like, come on dude, what, what is this fresh, are</p>
<p>we freshmen in college?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to, we&rsquo;re going to talk about Ayn Rand next.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s talk about reality.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And human nature.</p>
<p>People are fucking greedy.</p>
<p>They lie.</p>
<p>They, you know, there&rsquo;s no end to up, which is one of my favorite expressions.</p>
<p>No end to up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no end to up.</p>
<p>Can we dissect that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>From a Randian perspective.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no end to up, which is, uh, you just keep going.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never enough.</p>
<p>Oh, never enough.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s never enough.</p>
<p>No end to up.</p>
<p>No end to up more.</p>
<p>And you know, you have to reconcile your fact that you&rsquo;re going to die.</p>
<p>So like this no end up thing is that balance is, is just as valuable as progress.</p>
<p>So we have to reconcile those two things and put them on a seesaw and figure out how to</p>
<p>get two people who have the equal weight to keep it like that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the goal.</p>
<p>And it constantly vacillates, uh, according to the time you sometimes you need a little</p>
<p>more socialism.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need a little more capitalism.</p>
<p>You gotta, you gotta, you gotta fly the plane, man.</p>
<p>You gotta fly the plane, dude.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your, um, looking back at history, is there a moment, time period in history,</p>
<p>a person in history that&rsquo;s most fascinating to you?</p>
<p>You mentioned Bernie Madoff, maybe second to Bernie Madoff.</p>
<p>Is there in a battle of Crete, is there something that you&rsquo;ve always been curious about?</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s something you haven&rsquo;t actually researched that well yet, just something that</p>
<p>pulled at your curiosity that, uh, instructed the way you think about the world.</p>
<p>An individual or an event or an event, individual, uh, you know, yeah.</p>
<p>Moment in history or a person in history.</p>
<p>Um, there&rsquo;s a few, but, uh, you know, queen Elizabeth, uh, the Elizabethan era, you know,</p>
<p>the sun never sets in the British empire, very successful empire, uh, what an absolute</p>
<p>success story that is, is for a leader and a woman, um, can you tell a little bit about</p>
<p>her story?</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t know much about the British empire.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She had a good run.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like 70 years, you know, as a Shakespeare, they, you know, the, oh, I guess</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the word, Pax Romana, the, the, uh, the period of Rome that it was at peace and</p>
<p>they flourished like a couple of emperors like Trajan or some good ones.</p>
<p>And I think he was part of the Pax Romana that sort of just a peace and a comfortable</p>
<p>flourishing time and England, uh, had sort of that in their empire under her successful</p>
<p>reign.</p>
<p>She murdered her cousin.</p>
<p>She, you know, the movies, there&rsquo;s, uh, you know, um, Kate Blanchett plays her and, and</p>
<p>does so.</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t win the Oscar because fucking Gwyneth Paltrow put a, put a British accent</p>
<p>on in Shakespeare in love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tragedy.</p>
<p>Why do I know this?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m not a full man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a comedian, which means I do skits and I perform, um, and I, uh, Kate Blanchett&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible actress at great movies.</p>
<p>She was just so, and here&rsquo;s the thing, she, she never got married.</p>
<p>She was, she was so, um, astute at public relations and, and, and, and imagine how strong</p>
<p>you got to be as a woman to lead the greatest empire maybe known to man at the time and</p>
<p>to do so, so successfully.</p>
<p>How Machiavellian you have to be, how idealist you have to be, how much of a good marketer</p>
<p>you have to be.</p>
<p>Propaganda machine was on point.</p>
<p>She was married to England.</p>
<p>She was adored the way she adorned herself.</p>
<p>You walked in, you&rsquo;re like, holy men, God just walked in here.</p>
<p>And of course she got fucked.</p>
<p>I mean, who doesn&rsquo;t fuck?</p>
<p>We all fuck.</p>
<p>Even robots one day will fuck.</p>
<p>But she was, she, she did that propaganda thing and historians aren&rsquo;t, uh, haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t decided this, but I believe she fucked.</p>
<p>And I believe she did that as a tool of propaganda.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m married to England.</p>
<p>So you, oh, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re directly referring to like using sex as a way to manipulate people.</p>
<p>Well, she, her, she was known as like the, the Virgin queen.</p>
<p>And uh, and her thing was like, I&rsquo;m married to England.</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t be distracted by man or woman, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>She never had any kids, nothing.</p>
<p>I think she did that as a tool of manipulation, which you need.</p>
<p>Rulers need to, you know, Obama made you feel good and then he went and bombed, carpet bombed</p>
<p>everywhere.</p>
<p>You need to feel good about your guy, no matter how evil they are.</p>
<p>And she was fucking a dictator.</p>
<p>But when you look back at her, everyone&rsquo;s like, oh my God, she was so great.</p>
<p>The horror and the shit that she had to do, she didn&rsquo;t put that in the history books,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what probably was part of what made her successful.</p>
<p>And um, she&rsquo;s a fascinating character to, to ponder because she was so successful and,</p>
<p>and England flourished so much.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just fascinating to me because she was the great Virgin queen.</p>
<p>And can you think of, there&rsquo;s no other woman who was that, I mean, Angela Merkel, I mean,</p>
<p>come on.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s nobody who comes close and defeating the Spanish Armada, I think that</p>
<p>happened under her.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m no professional, but I mean, the, the woman crushed.</p>
<p>And uh,</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s more effective to lead by love, which just sounds like what she did</p>
<p>from the PR perspective or by fear?</p>
<p>Where do you, where do you land on that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Um, I&rsquo;m not, we got to ask Joe.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, this is interesting cause I think leading in the 21st century in whatever ways</p>
<p>is different.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to lead by fear.</p>
<p>I mean, um, that&rsquo;s why I find Putin fascinating and like really fascinating.</p>
<p>Like is he a relic of another era or is he something that will still be necessary in</p>
<p>the coming decades for certain nations?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a relic from another era.</p>
<p>I think his background, I think he is who you think he is because his background was</p>
<p>in espionage.</p>
<p>His background was in subterfuge and espionage.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve said the word subterfuge maybe 10 times now, but he, uh, like big words,</p>
<p>intellectuals.</p>
<p>I just sitting here with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my, it&rsquo;s time to flex.</p>
<p>Um, but he, um, he&rsquo;s very good at that, right?</p>
<p>Like, uh, controlling people with psychology and even if you look at the way he sort of</p>
<p>used the internet and, um, has sort of been, you know, gotten in to the citizens of other</p>
<p>countries opinions and it&rsquo;s very KGB.</p>
<p>He also looks great without a shirt on a pony on a horse on a horse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I thought he would choose a pony cause a pony smaller makes him would, uh, would you, would</p>
<p>you put queen Elizabeth as the greatest leader of all time?</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you look at Elizabeth as a woman and you look at, uh, you look at the, the length of</p>
<p>the reign, I think it&rsquo;s like 70 something years or something like that, that she reigned</p>
<p>success man, success.</p>
<p>She used the church, she used public psychology, Shakespeare, the greatest playwright of all</p>
<p>time, uh, under her reign, you know, people were going to plays and, and, uh, it was a,</p>
<p>it was a success front and she was marauding everywhere else marauding and culling resources</p>
<p>for the empire and just say a absolute successful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even, uh, a token of her success.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t consider her a dictator.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a dictator, you know, she was queen.</p>
<p>I, this is my thing I love about the feudal system that these fucking countries still</p>
<p>have feudal systems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re celebrating a horrible thing, divine right of Kings oppression, Kings were dictators</p>
<p>and now they have fucking ceremonial.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we have a ceremonial Fuhrer?</p>
<p>What is in German?</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t do any of the bad stuff.</p>
<p>He just rolls around and does, I mean, it&rsquo;s like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no difference between a Hitler and a fucking King.</p>
<p>They did the same horrible shit.</p>
<p>Why not a fucking ceremonial conqueror, Alexander the Great walks in, rapes a little bit, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for ceremony.</p>
<p>He represents the country.</p>
<p>Macedonia is Greek.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see that, uh, some you&rsquo;re starting to see a bit of that in Russia was</p>
<p>Stalin, actually the celebration of a, of a man that helped win the great patriotic war.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So like you, you&rsquo;re already starting to see that it&rsquo;s very possible in history books,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be seen as maybe like a Genghis Khan type of character and you forget the millions</p>
<p>that he tortured.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re one of the most successful and brilliant people the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re the good person to ask, uh, for advice.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of young people that look up to you, uh, God bless their souls</p>
<p>and hearts.</p>
<p>Made the right choice.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person?</p>
<p>Maybe to yourself, to a young version of yourself, you know, and just how to live a successful,</p>
<p>a good life.</p>
<p>Be doggedly you.</p>
<p>I think the magic happens when you are stubbornly doggedly you and you meet other people who</p>
<p>are doing the same and, um, the real magic of life, the real true currency in this ephemeral</p>
<p>life is sort of the communication that happens between people.</p>
<p>Uh, that&rsquo;s the real currency, friendships, love, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s cliche, but it&rsquo;s a, I think</p>
<p>the meaning of life is to experience, to experience love.</p>
<p>And, uh, I think, uh, people often mistake, maybe it&rsquo;s because of Hollywood films and</p>
<p>things like that, that love is a feeling, but it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s an action.</p>
<p>So, uh, that took me a while to learn and I think that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve made decisions since</p>
<p>that I think have been good for me and healthy for me.</p>
<p>Love is an action.</p>
<p>People can say things, you can feel things, um, that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re necessarily</p>
<p>real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all chemical reactions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, um, tied to our immaturity and, uh, psychological issues and, uh, survival,</p>
<p>but action when some, when you do things, when you act out of love and you, the, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>Is there, uh, times when you were younger where you were kind of dishonest with who</p>
<p>you are to yourself in terms of like, what, what kind of things did you have to do to,</p>
<p>to shake yourself up and be like, okay, I thought, um, I thought I&rsquo;m going to be a scientist,</p>
<p>but instead I realized I&rsquo;m going to do this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My parents were funny.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My, my comedy is a hard, hard thing to explain to, uh, you know, an immigrant mother who</p>
<p>came here and under Nazi occupied Crete and became a human rights lawyer and lawyer.</p>
<p>And, uh, my brother&rsquo;s a lawyer and my father was a lawyer, you know, clawed his way up.</p>
<p>His dad was a, was a, um, so your disappointment, um, the black sheep.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My brother went to Oxford Georgetown law at Brown, you know, has a master&rsquo;s in pot, you</p>
<p>know, law degrees.</p>
<p>My mother has followed up for law degrees, uh, you know, uh, she was on the human rights</p>
<p>commission in New York up for a judgeship under Dinkins, um, wrote a, you know, um,</p>
<p>she was the editor of Unitar.</p>
<p>She wrote a seminal piece on the human rights of children for the United Nations.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, yeah, it was a comedian.</p>
<p>I was always a fuck up.</p>
<p>And, uh, the thing that I was best at, the only thing I was ever decent at was just like</p>
<p>making people laugh.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where that comes from, but, uh, was there ever a question or did, was there</p>
<p>a moment where you decided this is what I&rsquo;m going to do?</p>
<p>There was a moment after I graduated college.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was just thinking about all types of stuff that other people imposed on me.</p>
<p>And, um, I was honest with myself and once I figured out it was an actual career path,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t even aware back then the internet wasn&rsquo;t huge, you know, late 99, 2000 it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>big yet.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t, I thought Robin Williams was just like an actor.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know there was comedy clubs and all.</p>
<p>So once I learned that I was just like, I tried it.</p>
<p>I suffer from massive anxiety.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I did comedy, my arms went numb.</p>
<p>I started having a massive panic attack.</p>
<p>I have my first set.</p>
<p>I can show it to you.</p>
<p>I suggest I just come video.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m video.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And the reason why I kept saying thank you is because I forgot my old jokes.</p>
<p>I was so scared.</p>
<p>And then they laughed because of the amount of times I said thank you.</p>
<p>And then once they laughed, I was, I remembered the whole thing and I did the five minutes</p>
<p>and I remember getting off.</p>
<p>And for a person who never felt like he had a place anywhere, nothing ever felt right.</p>
<p>That felt like, okay, I found it.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m supposed to do.</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<p>It was the only time in my life I felt that I haven&rsquo;t felt that sense.</p>
<p>Never felt it before.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the only thing I can do.</p>
<p>And yeah, I had that, you know, it&rsquo;s funny cause there&rsquo;s a similar experience like immigrant</p>
<p>family and the world tells you to do certain things and you think that&rsquo;s right, but, but</p>
<p>then you put yourself in situations by luck probably where it&rsquo;s like, oh, this, this,</p>
<p>this feels right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what this means, but this feels right.</p>
<p>I think the biggest moment like that for me was, I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it exactly,</p>
<p>but when I met Spot, the robot, the legged robot, it was like five years ago, it felt</p>
<p>like this, the depth of fascinating ideas that are yet to be explored with this thing.</p>
<p>This felt like a journey.</p>
<p>It was like a door that opened and I was like, I don&rsquo;t want to be a professor.</p>
<p>At that point I realized I don&rsquo;t want to do sort of a generic stuff.</p>
<p>I want to do something crazy.</p>
<p>I want to do something big.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason I stepped away from MIT.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason I have this burning desire to do a startup.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason I came to Austin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the hell it all means, but you just kind of follow that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>That sounds like you&rsquo;re following what&rsquo;s doggedly you.</p>
<p>And also I think I just to, just to piggyback off it, I think that means no matter what</p>
<p>it is, because I think our, the American dream is sold like, Hey, if you&rsquo;re not Beyonce or</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not famous, you&rsquo;re not worth it.</p>
<p>I hate that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I love so much about certain countries like Sweden, it&rsquo;s like where everyone</p>
<p>has healthcare and stuff like that because everyone&rsquo;s a little is valued more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like whatever, if you want to be a doorman, do it like it&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>Prince was not happy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, just because you&rsquo;re rich or famous, you&rsquo;re still the same guy with your possessions</p>
<p>are a lot little, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I have met some doormen.</p>
<p>I have met some tax cappers that I lie to you not are more fascinating.</p>
<p>I have comedians are horrible people, so I want to get away from all of them.</p>
<p>I have very few friends, Paul Verzi, Tim Dillon, who are comedians because they&rsquo;re awful, awful</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>Some of the people who you know the most, who are the most famous are not who they say</p>
<p>they are.</p>
<p>Usually that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re putting on that public facade because they&rsquo;re fucking sociopaths and they&rsquo;re horrible</p>
<p>people and some of the most beautiful people I&rsquo;ve met and the most interesting people I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>met have regular jobs.</p>
<p>There is no shame in any fucking job.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t all have to be rappers with like rims.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a weird thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Fame is a drug and yeah, comedians, I agree with you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some part of me that knows that there&rsquo;ll be a moment in my life when I&rsquo;m standing there</p>
<p>with like a sword or a knife in my stomach and looking at Tim Dillon&rsquo;s smiling face saying</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t have trusted me, you stupid fuck.</p>
<p>So on that note, Yannis, I&rsquo;ve been a huge fan of yours.</p>
<p>I love what you&rsquo;re doing with Long Days Now, your new podcast, and I obviously love all</p>
<p>the stuff you&rsquo;ve done before with History of Hyenas, the chemistry you have with yourself</p>
<p>is also fun to watch.</p>
<p>So man, I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor that you come down here.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>It means so much to me to hear you say that.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of yours and having me on has been amazing and just thank you, man.</p>

<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
