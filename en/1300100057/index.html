    <p>the joe rogan experience</p>
<p>double rainbow</p>
<p>yes and a kind of hello</p>
<p>if you fly no i go</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up bitches</p>
<p>my friend jason tebow&rsquo;s all up in this</p>
<p>bitch what&rsquo;s up everybody</p>
<p>said what&rsquo;s up bitches</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll take your bitch i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be redundant with my bitches</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen i retired the word faggot</p>
<p>from my vernacular</p>
<p>sorry to hear that i gave it up</p>
<p>i gave it up in</p>
<p>light of this most recent controversy</p>
<p>where i call this guy faggot not meaning anything</p>
<p>derogatory towards</p>
<p>homosexuals but</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>the thought behind saying something like that as well</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s important is not the words on a</p>
<p>magic word it&rsquo;s your intent</p>
<p>and that should be important but when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a word that confuses a lot of</p>
<p>people and pisses people off and that&rsquo;s not your intent</p>
<p>then really racially and</p>
<p>logically you have</p>
<p>to kind of accept that you have an ineffective word</p>
<p>that word&rsquo;s not that good that word</p>
<p>means too many different</p>
<p>things it means</p>
<p>to some people it means you hate gay people</p>
<p>and that is the</p>
<p>furthest possible</p>
<p>thing from the</p>
<p>truth i have</p>
<p>absolutely zero problem</p>
<p>with gay people i have no problem with it i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>wrong with it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve met a ton of cool gay people</p>
<p>and i grew up</p>
<p>in san francisco when i was a little kid from</p>
<p>ages 7 to 11</p>
<p>i was constantly</p>
<p>around gay people my next door neighbors were</p>
<p>these gay guys that my aunt used to go over and</p>
<p>smoke weed with this</p>
<p>big gay fucking</p>
<p>scary muscular</p>
<p>black guy with a shaved head</p>
<p>and his weird</p>
<p>white friend and</p>
<p>these dudes</p>
<p>would blaze out with my aunt they</p>
<p>would all get high and naked</p>
<p>what years with you</p>
<p>this is shit it was a long time ago</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m old as fuck</p>
<p>um i guess i was</p>
<p>seven between age</p>
<p>seven to eleven we</p>
<p>lived there so that was like</p>
<p>somewhere in the nineteen</p>
<p>seventies right</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>right when the vietnam war was ending it was like</p>
<p>super hippie time in san francisco and that&rsquo;s where we</p>
<p>lived and we were just constantly around gay people</p>
<p>and i remember when i was a kid i was like</p>
<p>i guess i was like</p>
<p>11 12 when we</p>
<p>moved from san francisco to florida</p>
<p>and it was a totally different ball game</p>
<p>you could not get</p>
<p>culturally more of a 180</p>
<p>from san francisco</p>
<p>which is like the most open minded</p>
<p>place on earth</p>
<p>especially in the 1970s</p>
<p>too yeah to living in gainesville</p>
<p>florida with alligators and shit and rednecks</p>
<p>right and there&rsquo;s this cuban</p>
<p>dude i i hung out with this kid his name was</p>
<p>candy and he was a boy and his name was</p>
<p>candy his name was candy yeah</p>
<p>candido yeah</p>
<p>candy sweet</p>
<p>candy i think</p>
<p>candy oliver</p>
<p>i think that was his last name</p>
<p>and his dad was like</p>
<p>super homophobic</p>
<p>and his dad was reading the</p>
<p>paper and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going can you fucking believe this shit</p>
<p>like throws a</p>
<p>paper down a</p>
<p>table i&rsquo;ll never forget this</p>
<p>i was like wow what is</p>
<p>going on like i had just been</p>
<p>aware of war</p>
<p>and that war</p>
<p>ended i was like real cognizant</p>
<p>that there was some fucked up shit</p>
<p>going on in the world</p>
<p>like you know i had you when you were like seven or</p>
<p>eight and someone</p>
<p>tries to sit down</p>
<p>and explain to you war</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some people like why are</p>
<p>these people protesting i remember asking</p>
<p>my stepfather</p>
<p>and he had to</p>
<p>break this whole</p>
<p>thing down to me that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a conflict</p>
<p>going on and</p>
<p>these people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna have to go over there and kill people</p>
<p>and i was like whoa what</p>
<p>like we go over</p>
<p>they take you and they make you go somewhere</p>
<p>and kill people</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even have to agree</p>
<p>war is unfathomable that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the children not just unfathomable but the idea of the</p>
<p>draft and being forced into doing that</p>
<p>slavery it&rsquo;s nothing but</p>
<p>slavery for a military</p>
<p>industrial complex i mean that&rsquo;s really what it is</p>
<p>so i was freaked out about</p>
<p>everything back then i was just</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>i was very unstable</p>
<p>for a young kid</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a kid you don&rsquo;t even like to be told to</p>
<p>clean your room that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the that&rsquo;s but let</p>
<p>alone being told so</p>
<p>anyway so this guy</p>
<p>freaks out i can&rsquo;t fucking believe this shit he</p>
<p>throws the thing down i&rsquo;m like fuck we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to war</p>
<p>again we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to war this is what i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>and he goes</p>
<p>these fucking fags want to get married</p>
<p>and i remember going what</p>
<p>no way i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>clearly i&rsquo;ve heard that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think that i thought it was</p>
<p>clearly a mistake</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way because i didn&rsquo;t know any</p>
<p>adults like this when i</p>
<p>lived in san francisco like i said my neighbors were</p>
<p>these weird gay guys and my dad&rsquo;s friends were all</p>
<p>architects and computer programmers they were all</p>
<p>really pretty</p>
<p>smart people so i&rsquo;d never</p>
<p>heard anybody that gave a fuck</p>
<p>about some people</p>
<p>people getting</p>
<p>married that they don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>but this guy was like really serious</p>
<p>about it and it was</p>
<p>a really important</p>
<p>moment for me as like an eleven year old</p>
<p>cause i realized there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>levels of adults</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s some people that are just</p>
<p>adults but they</p>
<p>think like children they</p>
<p>are completely</p>
<p>ignorant totally and even though they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>adults even though they have kids of</p>
<p>their own they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still idiots</p>
<p>i remember that being a big important moment</p>
<p>and that moment was because this guy was</p>
<p>homophobic and i thought that was the most</p>
<p>ridiculous thing ever</p>
<p>so by me conveying</p>
<p>any homophobic</p>
<p>you know any</p>
<p>any not intent but</p>
<p>people receiving that and getting that message that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>homophobic cause i call somebody a faggot</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that with straight guys but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that the reality</p>
<p>is if it&rsquo;s making that many people pissed off and upset</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s making them</p>
<p>think that you care</p>
<p>about their</p>
<p>sexual preference</p>
<p>i at a point</p>
<p>in time i was like why am i attached this fucking word</p>
<p>like am i just stubborn</p>
<p>like what i mean it&rsquo;s fun to say it</p>
<p>is fun to say but why is it fun to say it&rsquo;s fun to say</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re not really supposed to say it</p>
<p>same reason fig newtons</p>
<p>are nice to say it just</p>
<p>sounds good</p>
<p>right faggot yeah but</p>
<p>i just decided</p>
<p>from all this that it was an ineffective word</p>
<p>and then i didn&rsquo;t want to be hurting anybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>feelings for no reason at all i&rsquo;m hurting absolutely</p>
<p>wrong people&rsquo;s feelings like i don&rsquo;t care at all</p>
<p>about the fact that they&rsquo;re gay and if that hurts</p>
<p>their feelings if it&rsquo;s just this one word</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s enough who gives a shit</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t it something just more</p>
<p>about somebody</p>
<p>just being way too sensitive yes it is like it is</p>
<p>like sensitive straight</p>
<p>people and sensitive gay people i</p>
<p>know a lot of gay</p>
<p>people you say the faggot in</p>
<p>front of them</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t give a shit oh yeah</p>
<p>absolutely and i for sure and true but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re saying don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>swear at all</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t call people cunts or douchebags or what any</p>
<p>other word that means exactly the same</p>
<p>thing you know you call some guy a faggot like</p>
<p>these guys being a faggot</p>
<p>what do you mean he&rsquo;s being a douchebag</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really the</p>
<p>exact same intent yeah but if somebody&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>negative thing</p>
<p>going on somebody</p>
<p>says lard ass in</p>
<p>front of me or fat so i won&rsquo;t get a but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>descriptive</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s descriptive yeah</p>
<p>so is faggots but it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s confused</p>
<p>it has an ambivalent</p>
<p>sort of meaning now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people it</p>
<p>could mean pussy it</p>
<p>could mean you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too confusing</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>louis ck has a</p>
<p>great bit about it</p>
<p>where he kind of defends his use of it and</p>
<p>every comic friend i know says it and ari</p>
<p>and joey when they</p>
<p>got me my birthday cake for my 40th birthday it says</p>
<p>happy birthday faggot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on my birthday</p>
<p>cake cause we call each</p>
<p>other faggots all the time it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know like someone</p>
<p>brian might call me and go</p>
<p>hello faggot</p>
<p>just out of nowhere that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>the better one</p>
<p>that i usually they say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>when we talk</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like fun you know it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re children</p>
<p>everyone in our</p>
<p>group one of the</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>binds us all together is we&rsquo;re all very juvenile</p>
<p>you know joey is the oldest one and he</p>
<p>might be the youngest one you know i call my</p>
<p>flashlight a faggot</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>for obvious</p>
<p>reasons faggot</p>
<p>flashlight from</p>
<p>flashlight com</p>

<p>stupid like</p>
<p>sniffing some fucking coyote shit i</p>

<p>right you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a lot of dog so</p>
<p>dog but it&rsquo;s too good for</p>
<p>confusing a word</p>
<p>you know i just decided it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>worth it is it been a big deal like</p>
<p>i mean have you been getting a lot of</p>
<p>bad stuff from just</p>
<p>well most people support me on it it&rsquo;s a strange</p>
<p>thing to because</p>
<p>some people support me</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll support you like fuck all</p>
<p>those fucking fags they can&rsquo;t fucking deal with it</p>
<p>you know keep that shit out of our face</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>wrong kind of</p>
<p>support you</p>
<p>know yeah you&rsquo;re not helping me on my side dude</p>

<p>go suck cocks we want to suck cock from guys who like</p>
<p>their cock sock</p>
<p>go get some who gives a shit</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>if that was you if all of a sudden all</p>
<p>these gay people were telling you you had to be gay</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>or just complaining</p>
<p>about the type of</p>
<p>chicks that i was</p>
<p>sleeping with</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a problem and the whole the</p>
<p>homophobia is a real problem it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>exact thing as any douchiness</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just racism or</p>
<p>sexism or guys who want to roofie</p>
<p>chicks and fucking</p>
<p>you know and rape them</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re sleeping</p>
<p>oh yeah it&rsquo;s all the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s groups that hate</p>
<p>other groups</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just fucking and it&rsquo;s such a new it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s old like homosexuality</p>
<p>super old and like</p>
<p>you know very similar to you like i grew up in a very</p>
<p>liberal environment</p>
<p>my mother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lesbian i was raised by</p>
<p>lesbians growing up she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>saying what&rsquo;s that like let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s do</p>
<p>about that so but it&rsquo;s like mom&rsquo;s a faggot</p>
<p>i know i know</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t listen mom</p>
<p>but you know very similar to you like</p>
<p>you know i grew up in like the chicago area but in like</p>
<p>you know early</p>
<p>eighties like</p>
<p>lesbians in the midwest were</p>
<p>slightly less rare than</p>
<p>leprechauns as far as you know you you</p>
<p>would know it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>as out as it is now it wasn&rsquo;t socially acceptable you</p>
<p>pretty much had to keep it</p>
<p>under tight wraps</p>
<p>or live in san francisco or chicago or really open area</p>
<p>you left that area in chicago</p>
<p>was pretty man</p>
<p>goes tricky no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>the line in the sands pretty</p>
<p>clear but you</p>
<p>could be more out then i mean the gay</p>
<p>pride parade in chicago&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>second biggest one to san francisco i</p>
<p>think of what i</p>
<p>think of liberal cities i just</p>
<p>think of new york and now and</p>
<p>san francisco</p>
<p>i mean i guess la yeah</p>
<p>right la is pretty open but i mean</p>
<p>as far as the</p>
<p>whole midwest goes that&rsquo;s it you know it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>saint louis anything else i mean chicago&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>stuck in the</p>
<p>midwest that&rsquo;s your only hope of any sort of like</p>
<p>liberal upbringing or</p>
<p>you know not being bombarded but</p>
<p>so then when i went to college i went to</p>
<p>school in the midwest</p>
<p>like southern indiana central indiana and i actually</p>
<p>would meet people i met a guy who was like</p>
<p>i never saw a real live</p>
<p>black person till i</p>
<p>wrestled one in high</p>
<p>school ha ha</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s a direct</p>
<p>quote from this guy lonnie</p>
<p>belvo and i was just shit dude and i was just like get</p>
<p>that you net</p>

<p>black person</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s some sort of like animals that are</p>
<p>like you know some</p>

<p>you imagine how intimidating that must have been like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>black guy now he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna try to</p>
<p>you know take my back and shit you know i mean</p>
<p>like the first his</p>
<p>first meeting with a</p>
<p>black guy any</p>
<p>black person in his life was on a</p>
<p>wrestling match and he&rsquo;s probably used to</p>
<p>those slow ass</p>
<p>white athletes</p>

<p>gotta get a petri dish and</p>
<p>scrape some cells off of this dude it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>after the match he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably just like it was very nice meeting your kind</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s like do you guys remember your</p>
<p>first black person</p>
<p>my what do you guys remember your first</p>
<p>black person that you had sex with you</p>

<p>my you know high</p>
<p>school graduating</p>
<p>class is like half</p>
<p>black half white like but it was no big deal</p>
<p>to me whatsoever but like growing as a kid like i</p>
<p>never really even</p>
<p>understood racism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing that i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand until i</p>
<p>moved to florida and my mom</p>
<p>my mom and i actually got in an argument</p>
<p>about it cause my mom was</p>
<p>she was a good</p>
<p>person but when she raised me she was very young</p>
<p>you know she was</p>
<p>twenty when</p>
<p>she had me me too so she didn&rsquo;t know shit she was a</p>
<p>dingbat a kid she was just a kid she</p>
<p>was a kid a kid</p>
<p>yeah so like she assumed i knew everything</p>
<p>right like i</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know how people had as you did for her i did</p>
<p>not know how that people had sex and i did know how big</p>
<p>babies were born</p>
<p>until i was seven</p>
<p>she never told me shit</p>
<p>and then she goes you know</p>
<p>and i go i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i go i don&rsquo;t know tell me tell me what it is you</p>
<p>literally have</p>
<p>to make fun of it</p>
<p>i go i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna make fun of it tell me how people make</p>
<p>i had no fucking idea</p>
<p>and my mom i was in the car i remember this very</p>
<p>clearly 1970</p>
<p>barracuda i&rsquo;m sitting in the back seat with my sister</p>
<p>and i go just tell me so she tells me</p>
<p>she goes the man</p>
<p>sticks his penis in the</p>
<p>woman&rsquo;s vagina</p>
<p>i start fucking laughing</p>
<p>and she reaches back and hits me in the head for</p>
<p>laughing just like i knew it</p>
<p>i knew you were</p>
<p>i knew you&rsquo;re just trying to make fun of it</p>
<p>i go i didn&rsquo;t know i didn&rsquo;t know what it meant it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>legitimate question that was</p>
<p>one time that happened and the</p>
<p>other time it happened</p>
<p>was we were in florida</p>
<p>cause some kid kept talking</p>
<p>about niggers</p>
<p>there was some kid in my</p>
<p>school that just kept talking</p>
<p>about niggers</p>
<p>like man we got problems here</p>
<p>these niggers are</p>
<p>moving in and</p>
<p>i was like what the fuck is this guy talking</p>
<p>about and i just</p>
<p>moved there so i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna ask questions you know i was</p>
<p>a shy eleven year old from san francisco all the</p>
<p>sudden i&rsquo;m around alligators and shit</p>
<p>right you know and so i asked</p>
<p>my mom i said what is a nigger</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like will you stop doing that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make me talk</p>
<p>about things i don&rsquo;t want to talk about</p>
<p>and i go i&rsquo;m telling you i don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>and she goes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bad word for</p>
<p>black people</p>
<p>and i was like whoa</p>
<p>right hold on like this dude is</p>
<p>claiming there&rsquo;s some war</p>
<p>going on between</p>
<p>white people and</p>
<p>black people in his mind there</p>
<p>are is that really</p>
<p>going down out here like i was so</p>
<p>shocked that the environment</p>
<p>was so radically different</p>
<p>you know san francisco to florida was fucking</p>
<p>crazy had to be god damn</p>
<p>especially like</p>
<p>early eighties late</p>
<p>seventies oh</p>
<p>my god everybody</p>
<p>was so dumb</p>
<p>everybody was so dumb they were giving out</p>
<p>bibles in school</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>strike one one kid</p>
<p>who would like be like all</p>
<p>super over enthusiastic</p>
<p>whenever anybody brought up religion because</p>
<p>he wanted to let everybody know that he loves the lord</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;re like i</p>
<p>guess like 11</p>
<p>and so they give</p>
<p>they give it a stack of</p>
<p>bibles and i take this</p>
<p>bible i&rsquo;m like what am i doing with this shit</p>
<p>i already had been through catholic</p>
<p>school i went</p>
<p>to catholic</p>
<p>school for first grade</p>
<p>and i had this</p>
<p>horrible just</p>
<p>nasty evil nun</p>
<p>who just ruined my</p>
<p>whole idea of</p>
<p>what religion was all about</p>
<p>so they were handing</p>
<p>these books i was like this is just ridiculous</p>
<p>killer shit like what the fuck are you doing here</p>
<p>right and this is one dude he goes</p>
<p>i likes reading the</p>
<p>bible oh i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>happy i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even wait to get home yeah i likes reading the bible</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>thinking what if me and this dude were</p>
<p>the only two people on the planet this is my thought</p>
<p>at eleven years old looking at this kid screaming</p>
<p>holding it up in the air he was holding the bible</p>
<p>above his head</p>
<p>while i was yelling this</p>
<p>i was thinking what if it was just me and this dummy</p>
<p>and then we were the only people on</p>
<p>earth what i wanna live</p>
<p>well would i</p>
<p>wanna live if there&rsquo;s the only guy i get to talk to</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i thought of at eleven wow</p>
<p>probably not i likes reading the bible</p>
<p>never forget that dude&rsquo;s voice</p>
<p>i just want</p>
<p>to pull him aside and go dude just come on man the kids</p>
<p>think about this the kids in</p>
<p>my neighborhood they used to call this</p>
<p>thing where they would</p>
<p>knock on the door and run they</p>
<p>would used to call it nigger knocking</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>that was nigger</p>
<p>so one of my</p>
<p>times i was like in</p>

<p>up yeah so me and my friends like to go nigger knocking</p>
<p>under your interests of</p>
<p>things you like to do</p>
<p>oh no you did not</p>
<p>and i remember that i</p>

<p>and oh my god my</p>

<p>yeah i mean we&rsquo;re all worried</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on afghanistan</p>
<p>shit if those fucking some of</p>
<p>those people that are</p>
<p>those somali pirates</p>
<p>if they figured out how to get</p>
<p>planes and start flying to other</p>
<p>places or just nuclear</p>
<p>well they get</p>
<p>their hands on a nuclear bomb</p>
<p>one nuclear bomb the somali</p>
<p>pirates that situation is</p>
<p>crazy they attacked a us</p>
<p>warship this week</p>
<p>did you hear</p>
<p>about that yeah i did how</p>
<p>looked are they</p>
<p>they went after a goddamn us warship</p>
<p>and they were in a raft</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s like they shot like rockets</p>
<p>the fucking you</p>
<p>they jacked everybody they arrested them and took</p>
<p>all their shit and</p>
<p>went after the</p>
<p>mothership and</p>
<p>sunk dad like</p>
<p>bitch they had a flex on people they sunk all</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>and chase down there&rsquo;s some other guys</p>
<p>apparently they couldn&rsquo;t find them they took off</p>
<p>that goes to show you how goddamn big the</p>
<p>ocean is if the us</p>
<p>coast guard</p>
<p>or the us navy rather can&rsquo;t find you</p>
<p>they got warships and they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t find you goddamn how big is this fucking ocean</p>
<p>but yeah these</p>
<p>crazy assholes</p>
<p>they fired on</p>
<p>these fucking people in a warship</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s i mean that&rsquo;s it happens a lot though</p>
<p>not just you</p>
<p>people you got to be</p>
<p>worried about</p>
<p>people that are desperate</p>
<p>so desperate they don&rsquo;t care if they</p>
<p>die they don&rsquo;t care you know how that all get started</p>
<p>they call themselves the people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coast guard of somalia</p>
<p>or the volunteer</p>
<p>coast guard of somalia</p>
<p>and what happened was the european</p>
<p>companies were dumping a lot of</p>
<p>toxic shit in the ocean</p>
<p>off the coast</p>
<p>near where they lived</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>just overfishing the fuck out of it</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re taking all these fish</p>
<p>dumping all the shit in the</p>
<p>water and then dumping all the shit in the</p>
<p>water now it kills all the fish</p>
<p>the water becomes</p>
<p>polluted they can&rsquo;t make a living</p>
<p>and so they first</p>
<p>started kidnapping</p>
<p>these boats that were dumping shit</p>
<p>and what they were doing was taking these guys</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>bringing them and holding them for ransom because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>money they can&rsquo;t fish anymore</p>
<p>but then once</p>
<p>they got used to doing that and getting ransom money</p>
<p>they said let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>start jacking people</p>
<p>so then they</p>
<p>turned into</p>
<p>the somali pirates</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a big business and they&rsquo;re making millions of dollars</p>
<p>and they get</p>
<p>millions of dollars</p>
<p>every year and no</p>
<p>one knows exactly what to do with it and it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>right near them they go</p>
<p>hundreds and hundreds of</p>
<p>miles out into the ocean</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s an impossible</p>
<p>thing to police</p>
<p>dude and they are loxters</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ready to die</p>
<p>yeah i mean that&rsquo;s fuck</p>
<p>they like the gangsters of the sea</p>
<p>literally dude</p>
<p>everybody around them has been dying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing they made it this long</p>
<p>the pressure of making this long wondering when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna die is probably staggering</p>
<p>cause everything they&rsquo;re around</p>
<p>is like people getting shot in the head and people</p>
<p>dying and them</p>
<p>shooting people and</p>
<p>12 year olds with fucking machine guns</p>
<p>gunning down people just for a</p>
<p>laugh i mean that&rsquo;s africa all day</p>
<p>all day all day so</p>
<p>these crazy</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>are out in rafts trying to take down a us warship</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ballsy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the barking chihuahua and like a dog park like</p>
<p>trying to take up a</p>
<p>right but i</p>
<p>mean look think</p>
<p>about this man</p>
<p>and nothing like that is</p>
<p>going down in afghanistan</p>
<p>no i mean we need to fucking concentrate on the really</p>
<p>crazy places</p>
<p>mexico and africa and korea</p>
<p>korea too yeah</p>
<p>we got a warship that&rsquo;s heading to korea</p>
<p>right now yeah we just need to</p>
<p>clear that whole country down</p>
<p>south korea is awesome</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>yeah how dare you</p>
<p>koreans are up in arms right now</p>
<p>literally i grew up</p>
<p>literally in</p>
<p>constantly around</p>
<p>koreans yeah me too doing taekwondo i used to have to</p>
<p>teach class in korean</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>how to say it i just knew how to say some of the moves</p>
<p>and how to count i</p>
<p>could count to like ten in korean right</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how to do it anymore it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>hannah door</p>
<p>set net does</p>
<p>yours you&rsquo;ll go you do i don&rsquo;t remember how to do it</p>
<p>right though</p>
<p>i might be saying it all wrong</p>
<p>yeah you earned like</p>
<p>martial arts a long time</p>
<p>like korean someone</p>
<p>else taekwondo</p>
<p>taekwondo and then what you</p>
<p>i just wanted to go to korea</p>
<p>i always wanted to go in and compete there you just</p>
<p>enamored with martial</p>
<p>arts like when you were a kid that&rsquo;s yeah well i</p>
<p>became obsessed with taekwondo when i was in high</p>
<p>school right</p>
<p>cause it was the</p>
<p>first thing i ever was i ever got good at</p>
<p>it was like for me it&rsquo;s like my</p>
<p>whole life we</p>
<p>moved around a lot i didn&rsquo;t have friends</p>
<p>that i didn&rsquo;t have friends for any long period of time</p>
<p>cause we just kept moving so by the time i was in high</p>
<p>school i had no one</p>
<p>who was a friend</p>
<p>i just constantly had</p>
<p>moved so i was</p>
<p>super insecure</p>
<p>and i needed something to make me feel</p>
<p>worthwhile so i</p>
<p>started doing taekwondo and i got obsessed with it</p>
<p>plus i was small</p>
<p>too and i didn&rsquo;t like the idea of people</p>
<p>picking on me and fucking with me</p>
<p>so i wanted to be able to beat the shit out of people</p>
<p>right the only way to do that is you</p>
<p>gotta learn some karate</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like in the</p>
<p>movies man right</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>get some chuck norris love in my life and</p>
<p>kind of fucking figure out how to</p>
<p>fight this is bullshit i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>tired of being scared</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s funny that like once you</p>
<p>start doing that that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>generally the last</p>
<p>thing you want to do is</p>
<p>right yeah the</p>
<p>nicest people</p>
<p>i know are fighters or</p>
<p>people who train</p>
<p>cause they don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not insecure</p>
<p>about men are always</p>
<p>sizing each</p>
<p>other up and wondering what</p>
<p>would happen if we fought man i mean that guy just</p>
<p>fucking kick his ass</p>
<p>right i realize</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying that they don&rsquo;t even know what they</p>
<p>would do do you have a plan what are you</p>
<p>gonna do you gonna</p>
<p>hit him he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna run away you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna knock him out with the</p>
<p>first punch</p>
<p>like what if he fucking</p>
<p>dodges your</p>
<p>punch and comes back with a</p>
<p>counter and then</p>
<p>shoots for a double are you</p>
<p>ready for that</p>
<p>you have your spa</p>
<p>your spa ready</p>
<p>are you really</p>
<p>ready to fight</p>
<p>do you really even know what that means right no</p>
<p>most guys no</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>chest puffy</p>
<p>and talking all this shit it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>peacock feathers shit hoping to</p>
<p>talk people down</p>
<p>but people who</p>
<p>train and actually</p>
<p>fight they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to do that they don&rsquo;t want to do that it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>mentality the</p>
<p>human animal</p>
<p>is designed for conflict that is just a fact</p>
<p>we have hardware</p>
<p>from thousands of thousands of years ago</p>
<p>where you had to</p>
<p>fight off intruders and you had to kill your own</p>
<p>food and that&rsquo;s a fact and the hardware that we have</p>
<p>today despite the fact that our life</p>
<p>is not like that anymore and</p>
<p>we have this complicated society that provides us with</p>
<p>supermarkets and traffic and</p>
<p>all this other</p>
<p>thing these</p>
<p>other things we</p>
<p>have to deal with the bottom line is that our body is</p>
<p>still the same fucking body</p>
<p>that has the same reward</p>
<p>system set up so it has all these</p>
<p>ghost needs</p>
<p>needs to crush</p>
<p>things needs</p>
<p>to kill that&rsquo;s like a satisfaction needs to breathe</p>
<p>these are rewards that you get</p>
<p>from killing animals when you kill an animal and eat it</p>
<p>this primal reward</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s designed to keep you</p>
<p>alive it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>similar to the same reward that you get when you fuck</p>
<p>and you have kids it feels good to fuck</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a reward</p>
<p>system set up to make sure you fuck</p>
<p>right you know i mean it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>survival of the species yeah</p>
<p>we have this old ass hardware man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no app for that</p>
<p>exactly and you</p>
<p>a lot of people have tension because they don&rsquo;t train</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t do martial arts because they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go and hit a</p>
<p>punching bag</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t mean you</p>
<p>wanna hurt people</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you</p>
<p>wanna be it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a release of that&rsquo;s the same reason like a</p>
<p>lot of like</p>
<p>pedophilia is</p>
<p>and rapist they all have that like pent up</p>
<p>sexual energy</p>
<p>they have like old shit they don&rsquo;t actually can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even you shouldn&rsquo;t even think</p>
<p>about martial</p>
<p>arts in terms of hurting people when you&rsquo;re doing it in</p>
<p>training you&rsquo;re just playing a game</p>
<p>and the game it does hurt</p>
<p>you know but it&rsquo;s a game the</p>
<p>game is you&rsquo;re trying to hit that person they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to hit you you try to get out of the way encounter</p>
<p>give out more</p>
<p>give out more punishment than you take</p>
<p>figure out a strategy that can</p>
<p>get past them figure out what they&rsquo;re doing and getting</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s what it is it&rsquo;s a game of</p>
<p>using the human body</p>
<p>in physical contact</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a satisfying game and</p>
<p>it does wonders for your psyche</p>
<p>it does wonders for your</p>
<p>confidence yeah it does wonders for your relaxation</p>
<p>whenever i get upset</p>
<p>about something</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll freak out</p>
<p>about things</p>
<p>i go man i probably</p>
<p>should have worked out before with that</p>
<p>like this whole</p>
<p>thing the other day</p>

<p>that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>tired from working</p>
<p>out there that&rsquo;s a little bit of a too</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>used to say in taekwondo the taekwondo guys are always</p>

<p>shit kevin flynn</p>
<p>kevin flynn was the host boston comedian and he</p>
<p>stood this thing called</p>
<p>joe biden night</p>
<p>because back in nineteen eighty</p>
<p>eight a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize this because joe</p>
<p>biden is our current</p>
<p>vice president</p>
<p>but joe biden ran for president</p>
<p>and when he ran for president they</p>
<p>found out that he had plagiarized like a</p>
<p>ton of his fucking speeches</p>
<p>from kennedy</p>

<p>he was repeating</p>
<p>shit nobody knows any of his</p>

<p>at some new theater</p>
<p>thing that they got</p>
<p>going on at</p>
<p>mandalay bank bad</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be fun as fuck</p>
<p>trying to think of</p>
<p>other shit we</p>
<p>could do i was</p>
<p>gonna bring a dj i was</p>
<p>gonna bring a dj on</p>
<p>stage because i</p>
<p>heard that russell</p>
<p>peters does that it&rsquo;s kind of fun</p>
<p>i was like maybe that</p>
<p>would be fun at the end of the</p>
<p>night have like a fucking cool dj but</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to do anything like that you have to</p>
<p>clear the place out</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>think of what else</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a new year show we got to</p>
<p>think of something that makes it more interesting</p>
<p>instead of just a show you know</p>
<p>videos right</p>
<p>maybe yeah how</p>
<p>about how about i come on</p>
<p>stage and fuck a flashlight</p>
<p>or or or how</p>
<p>about doing a</p>
<p>live just fucking through his head to</p>
<p>the ring hey</p>
<p>or do a live just</p>
<p>put it out there</p>
<p>do a live party oh that&rsquo;s a good idea um yeah</p>
<p>maybe but the problem is uh</p>
<p>vegas is so fucking</p>
<p>short attention span</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really the</p>
<p>place to do a podcast</p>
<p>on a because if</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all on</p>
<p>stage just shoot</p>
<p>the shit about</p>
<p>things there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be people yelling it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be weird i mean we maybe</p>
<p>could do that let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get mc chris mc chris but see what i&rsquo;m saying is if we</p>
<p>maybe did that then it</p>
<p>would be hard to get up and do</p>
<p>stand up right</p>
<p>it would be hard</p>
<p>just go up and go and just</p>
<p>start doing your act</p>
<p>afterwards it</p>
<p>would be weird</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d like okay don&rsquo;t change it pay it yeah</p>
<p>fucking yeah it&rsquo;d be like all of a</p>
<p>sudden i&rsquo;m in fucking performance mode</p>
<p>i know is this hey you ever notice</p>
<p>what about mc chris</p>
<p>what about him i wonder if he would he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your type of</p>
<p>music he&rsquo;s a fun</p>
<p>party i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure he is</p>
<p>if i wanted that like if i wanted</p>
<p>music though</p>
<p>i want some</p>
<p>rock and roll</p>
<p>i want some</p>
<p>crazy band i</p>
<p>would like those</p>
<p>those fucking</p>
<p>those seventies guys</p>
<p>steel panther</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d love them to do it but they&rsquo;ve i&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>their own gig</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure they do</p>
<p>those guys they</p>
<p>killed it those are</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>killing for a long time that&rsquo;s a fun i</p>
<p>think they have a</p>
<p>television show in development now do they yeah i</p>
<p>think i heard that isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>crazy that that just came back like with the thunder</p>
<p>right it used to</p>
<p>be like being you know like someone who was into that</p>
<p>music was embarrassing</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s like dude</p>
<p>everything does that though</p>
<p>everything does that</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t know if it used to</p>
<p>happen that way</p>
<p>i think this is a fairly new phenomenon</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna wait till the word faggot</p>
<p>comes back in i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna hold on to it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not coming back</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s getting softer as people get</p>
<p>as life gets easier and easier</p>
<p>people come up with more</p>
<p>things to be</p>
<p>upset about</p>
<p>i mean if life is very very hard you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>waste your time on bullshit you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>bullshit if you&rsquo;ve got a lot of shit</p>
<p>going on in your life</p>
<p>but when life gets easy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s easy to get food and it&rsquo;s easy to get fat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to be lazy and it&rsquo;s easy to do</p>
<p>a job that you don&rsquo;t really like and</p>
<p>waste your time away</p>
<p>then you start looking for</p>
<p>things to get mad at</p>
<p>then you start</p>
<p>going i don&rsquo;t like your tone</p>
<p>well and also like if i can</p>
<p>bitch about you</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re doing it takes the</p>
<p>light off of anything that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fucking doing of course</p>
<p>pointing fingers you know yeah yeah yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a piece of shit</p>
<p>i can make you look</p>
<p>bad you have no idea how bad i look yeah that&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>thing when you if you have a disagreement with someone</p>
<p>and you say hey man like why are you</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing this this is kind of fucking me up</p>
<p>yeah but you always fucking</p>
<p>do this with that</p>
<p>right this what&rsquo;s up with that</p>
<p>and you know we&rsquo;re not even talking</p>
<p>about that we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about you right now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s textbook</p>
<p>yeah why you</p>
<p>going immediately to jumping</p>
<p>pointing the finger at me trying to even the score</p>
<p>now if you don&rsquo;t want to talk you don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about you want</p>
<p>to obviously it&rsquo;s your fucking podcast but</p>
<p>so what what</p>
<p>like prompted you</p>
<p>to just you know passively</p>
<p>just be like shut up faggot</p>
<p>or whatever the fuck</p>
<p>i just like what</p>
<p>was the detail</p>
<p>no douchebags like that all the time with this guy</p>
<p>yeah yeah what happened what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole i already</p>
<p>sort of talked</p>
<p>about it it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>this is what it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s about negative</p>
<p>mixed martial arts reporters</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few of</p>
<p>these guys that are trying to do this sort of jim rome</p>
<p>thing where they&rsquo;re trying to like insult guys and say</p>
<p>the most insulting shit possible that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>their whole</p>
<p>stick right</p>
<p>the problem is you&rsquo;re dealing with someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s putting</p>
<p>their emotions</p>
<p>their physical health</p>
<p>their future</p>
<p>and possibly the quality of their</p>
<p>thinking on the line</p>
<p>every time they</p>
<p>step into that cave there&rsquo;s nothing more and</p>
<p>these guys who are reporting on it are making a living</p>
<p>off of these guys taking</p>
<p>these chances and performing</p>
<p>right and you must respect that</p>
<p>in my world i</p>
<p>think that is one of the most important</p>
<p>things it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that someone</p>
<p>who is very vulnerable</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem like they are</p>
<p>cause it is destroyers and</p>
<p>these killers</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very vulnerable</p>
<p>place to be</p>
<p>and you know to be shitty</p>
<p>and and to be douchey to</p>
<p>these guys and to do it anonymously</p>
<p>just and do it as a person who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about martial arts</p>
<p>and this is my problem i i hate that shit it</p>
<p>drives me nuts</p>
<p>and this guy</p>
<p>is like the</p>
<p>worst guy ever at it he&rsquo;s like his</p>
<p>whole all of his</p>
<p>stuff he writes is like negative</p>
<p>all of it is insulting it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>perez hilton of</p>
<p>ufc exactly right and</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s doing it just</p>
<p>like his stick</p>
<p>well he picked on me</p>
<p>and he picked on me</p>
<p>about something</p>
<p>he said that i was incorrect</p>
<p>about a technique</p>
<p>which i was correct about</p>
<p>so i just decided you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>tired of this guy&rsquo;s bullshit</p>
<p>so i just attack him</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>right so i just</p>
<p>you know i called my faggot</p>
<p>which probably negated</p>
<p>in a lot of people&rsquo;s eyes all the positive</p>
<p>things right yeah</p>
<p>like oh he&rsquo;s a home but dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how i felt</p>
<p>you know i mean that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying i</p>
<p>mean you know</p>
<p>and look you know and people like what you</p>
<p>hate that guy like i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t hate anybody i just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want him to behave that way i don&rsquo;t know him and</p>
<p>might not he</p>
<p>might not be anything like that</p>
<p>that thomas</p>
<p>rios guy might be a nice guy that</p>
<p>might be just what he&rsquo;s trying to do you know</p>
<p>i have no idea i don&rsquo;t hate him but i hate that</p>
<p>form of journalism</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a terrible</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong it&rsquo;s unfair</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s putting out all this negative energy</p>
<p>for no reason yeah sensationalism yeah and i have</p>
<p>no problem with people critiquing people&rsquo;s technique</p>
<p>like if you say</p>
<p>you know say if you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about a particular</p>
<p>fighter well he</p>
<p>never really developed outside of the one</p>
<p>dimensional</p>
<p>wrestling type</p>
<p>fighter he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never really developed to</p>
<p>stand up he just likes to take guys down and be</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s just a fact</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a fact right but</p>
<p>this is not what this guy&rsquo;s doing it&rsquo;s like insulting</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s saying really shitty</p>
<p>nasty things</p>
<p>about people</p>
<p>and then when they lose</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll tweet them</p>
<p>and say see i told you</p>
<p>he was that guy is just waiting to get his back</p>
<p>taken out of</p>
<p>ralph&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>heavyweights matt mitreon</p>
<p>and joey beltron</p>
<p>two cool motherfuckers too by the way</p>
<p>joey beltron is the shit</p>
<p>that guy is a cool dude he&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>really really nice guy and he&rsquo;s a dj in his spare time</p>
<p>just like bar</p>
<p>mitzvahs and shit</p>
<p>right okay my man&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>grinding all</p>
<p>right and this guy&rsquo;s just talking</p>
<p>about how he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get fucked up and how he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t belong in the ring with his</p>
<p>other guys just</p>
<p>in the way he said it was</p>
<p>super douchey</p>
<p>so joey beltron responds and even how he responds to it</p>
<p>is like yeah</p>
<p>thanks a lot that&rsquo;s a lot of help or something</p>
<p>along those lines</p>
<p>right just kind of and then</p>
<p>after he loses this dude sends a</p>
<p>tweet out that was something like</p>
<p>you know apology accepted</p>
<p>because i was</p>
<p>right you got your ass kicked it&rsquo;s like man you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>fucking with a vulnerable person man for no and also a</p>
<p>vulnerable person that can kick your</p>
<p>fucking ass yeah and it&rsquo;s like i said there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with critiquing</p>
<p>their their technique</p>
<p>or critiquing even</p>
<p>their character</p>
<p>their behavior if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>after acting in a certain way and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>acting douchey or something like that there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with being honest</p>
<p>but when you just start</p>
<p>everything is just attacking and negative</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no joy and praise like what are you even</p>
<p>watching this shit for</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re not it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even seem like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>enjoying it</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s just trying to make a name for i mean it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great analogy</p>
<p>set of jim rome because you remember when jim rome got</p>
<p>famous yes for doing that was when</p>
<p>he was with with</p>
<p>jim everett was a</p>
<p>quarterback of the rams yeah and he had him on the show</p>
<p>and he kept calling him chris yes</p>
<p>for like his</p>
<p>radio show and</p>
<p>jim came onto the show pissed off</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like you know i&rsquo;m here to set this record</p>
<p>straight you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna quit doing that</p>
<p>he did it right in</p>
<p>front of him yeah he&rsquo;s like whatever chris</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like say it again and</p>
<p>he waited for like three</p>
<p>seconds and then he goes chris</p>
<p>and he real</p>
<p>and fucking ever it flips the</p>
<p>table over on him and like jump on</p>
<p>and dude he was</p>
<p>famous ever</p>
<p>since then yeah</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s just waiting for somebody to</p>
<p>fucking throw one</p>
<p>punch at him</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s all in the news</p>
<p>first of all you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>compare jim rome to an internet blogger</p>
<p>yeah but you know i&rsquo;m saying though but that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best thing that can happen</p>
<p>to this fucking asshole well it&rsquo;s not i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this thing</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re trying to just get attention</p>
<p>right only by just negative shit you know it&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s no joy for it there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>and it can work for some guys</p>
<p>like it work for rome i mean it can work for some guys</p>
<p>right but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you know it&rsquo;s fucking shitty man it&rsquo;s shitty</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a big difference between a guy losing a</p>
<p>basketball game</p>
<p>which sucks</p>
<p>and a guy getting his ass kicked</p>
<p>okay i guarantee you</p>
<p>nobody has felt</p>
<p>worse than brock</p>
<p>lesnar after kane</p>
<p>velasquez beat the fuck out of him</p>
<p>probably no one that&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>lived that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about is i mean outside of losing a</p>
<p>loved one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about as bad as you can feel</p>
<p>right physically</p>
<p>and physically</p>
<p>and emotionally probably more so</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s as bad as being</p>
<p>fired from a job you love</p>
<p>i mean he just got the fuck</p>
<p>beat out of him and humiliated</p>
<p>by a guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smaller than him and he&rsquo;s this big</p>
<p>giant fucking goliath of a man</p>
<p>and a heavy favor</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>heavy favor like</p>
<p>three to one or something yeah</p>
<p>you gotta respect that man you know</p>
<p>you gotta appreciate the fact this guy took this</p>
<p>crazy fucking chance and yeah he did it for money</p>
<p>and yeah you know this is what he</p>
<p>chose to do for a living that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely true but</p>
<p>no one feels that bad if they lose a</p>
<p>basketball game</p>
<p>you wanna shit on</p>
<p>basketball players</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a different</p>
<p>thing man right totally</p>
<p>even then you know you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing that critique</p>
<p>their character critique</p>
<p>their technique critique critique</p>
<p>their ability to perform that&rsquo;s all well and good</p>
<p>but we start just insulting people and just</p>
<p>wanting them to feel like shit you know with</p>
<p>your commentary</p>
<p>totally being</p>
<p>inconsiderate</p>
<p>of this person&rsquo;s feelings right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like everybody knows that guy which</p>
<p>by the way i&rsquo;ve all been we&rsquo;ve all been guilty as</p>
<p>comics of doing</p>
<p>out of someone i&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve made fun of someone</p>
<p>yeah sure but i mean you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little bit different i mean you can it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about people i&rsquo;ve met</p>
<p>some mean shit i&rsquo;ve said some mean shit in the past</p>
<p>about people in the sake of comedy that i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t say now</p>
<p>right i think i just think</p>
<p>about it different now you mean in</p>
<p>stand up you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t say it now are you yeah</p>
<p>like now i look at it i go</p>
<p>what do i give a fuck</p>
<p>about if that guy&rsquo;s doing this</p>
<p>i feel like</p>
<p>a lot of that is like growth in your own like</p>
<p>act and as an artist and</p>
<p>stuff early on you</p>
<p>start you know that&rsquo;s something you probably do</p>
<p>earlier than</p>
<p>later when you</p>
<p>know when you</p>
<p>start getting better at</p>
<p>stand up and you</p>
<p>start getting better at</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s also you just consider why am i</p>
<p>why am i upset at this guy you know</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s just a joke</p>
<p>or what a cheap joke</p>
<p>or cheap i never answered a</p>
<p>lot of jokes</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>some you know</p>
<p>what was it</p>
<p>like the hugh hefner</p>
<p>joke i wouldn&rsquo;t do that one if i had a chance to do it</p>
<p>today really</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>funny joke you&rsquo;re not really playing him i</p>
<p>would do it</p>

<p>character of him i</p>
<p>would do it differently</p>
<p>um i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but i would i would not</p>
<p>not do the anna</p>
<p>nicole smith one that one she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get a pass</p>

<p>there&rsquo;s few people that</p>
<p>turn it down yeah</p>
<p>when you start fucking</p>
<p>right a billionaire</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m okay an old billion an old billionaire</p>

<p>money though whatever happened that</p>
<p>she kind of died before that all got worked out well</p>
<p>yeah i think the law i</p>
<p>think she died i</p>
<p>think she overdosed before when all</p>
<p>those litigation like her family was like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna sue you to the end of time this is</p>
<p>gonna shoulder bro</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re that rich</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s texas</p>
<p>money right that</p>
<p>texas well i mean texas</p>
<p>sassens you can yeah indirectly</p>
<p>i mean even if they didn&rsquo;t indirectly they probably</p>
<p>drove her to fucking</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re like let&rsquo;s just keep this in the</p>
<p>court till she kills herself</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying i mean she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>right she&rsquo;s that type anyway i mean</p>
<p>obviously it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>weird that her son died too</p>
<p>i found that weird</p>
<p>whoa what if they</p>
<p>what if you find out this is like some</p>
<p>crazy conspiracy</p>
<p>it probably is</p>
<p>i believe that more than</p>
<p>tower seven we</p>
<p>should call alex</p>
<p>jones up right now</p>
<p>yeah right we</p>
<p>should call up alex jones</p>
<p>right now what the fuck</p>
<p>is that your alex</p>
<p>jones impression</p>
<p>oh no that was your ideas</p>
<p>oh god haha</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like joey diaz</p>
<p>tourette&rsquo;s over here when is that video coming out</p>
<p>the one i&rsquo;m doing now yeah</p>
<p>is that the one where he was on the</p>
<p>radio show yes just lost it greatest</p>
<p>things ever happened i&rsquo;m editing</p>
<p>apart right now that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>funny that has to do with censoring words</p>
<p>where we went to a radio station and they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t let joe say the word retard</p>
<p>which we thought was but he</p>
<p>could say everything else but no</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say everything else but retards</p>
<p>a new one that you can say</p>
<p>wow they call it</p>
<p>people call it the r word now</p>
<p>yeah oh the r word</p>
<p>yes so the i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>serious i&rsquo;ve gotten tweets</p>
<p>well saget replace the the f word replace the</p>
<p>n word and now the r words replacing the f word yeah</p>
<p>yeah what like i said something</p>
<p>about myspace</p>
<p>that i went back</p>
<p>and looked at my myspace page</p>
<p>and i felt like it was an abandoned</p>
<p>child that i left in a retarded forest</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>wrote right and</p>
<p>people starts raining down on you</p>
<p>i got a bunch of</p>
<p>tweets like i can&rsquo;t believe you used the r word</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not kidding</p>
<p>man i&rsquo;m not kidding it&rsquo;s the fucking r word</p>
<p>like when i was a kid</p>
<p>they said that in the</p>
<p>the r word yeah when i was can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>you use the r word</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what my mom used to say to me if i did something</p>
<p>wrong don&rsquo;t be a retard</p>
<p>is it right</p>
<p>is there gay homosexuals</p>
<p>what what you mean retarded</p>
<p>homosexuals like</p>
<p>like retarded faggots</p>
<p>dude you said</p>
<p>gay homosexuals</p>
<p>i mean i mean</p>
<p>i mean handicapped</p>
<p>homosexuals</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re too high</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>right now yeah</p>
<p>right fucked up that there&rsquo;s god</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gotta be</p>
<p>handicapped gay people yeah</p>
<p>there are you</p>
<p>think of course</p>
<p>well maybe yeah i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>guarantee it makes</p>
<p>sense what a</p>
<p>shit roll the</p>
<p>dice that is yeah i just wonder if it works that right</p>
<p>just seems like that</p>
<p>would be something that you</p>
<p>would have to be a hundred percent</p>
<p>to know that you&rsquo;re gay or hmm</p>
<p>you know i wonder if it&rsquo;s there such i got a</p>
<p>definition of queer</p>
<p>some fella on the</p>
<p>underground told me what</p>
<p>queer is cause you know one of the acronyms of lesbian</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like lbg</p>
<p>t q q stands for queer</p>
<p>and queer means</p>
<p>not particularly attracted to anything</p>
<p>attracted to whatever</p>
<p>like sometimes it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>a guy bisexual</p>
<p>yeah well how is that</p>
<p>different than bisexual</p>
<p>right how is that different than bisexual no that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing right it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>ignorant gacy thing</p>
<p>this is just showing you what a</p>
<p>bunch of fucking pussies we are</p>
<p>that somebody let them put that in</p>
<p>if someone said well this isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bisexual is this enough</p>
<p>do we have enough letters no no no</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not represented</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m queer</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not decisive not gay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not bisexual meanwhile most offensive gay</p>
<p>voice ever there it is</p>
<p>right right right</p>
<p>here it is yeah</p>
<p>this is my gay</p>
<p>voice from now on</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna do a gay</p>
<p>voice like a businessman</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my gay</p>
<p>voice right now</p>
<p>you should do like that</p>
<p>do japanese</p>
<p>businessman don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>representative</p>
<p>mind type is clear</p>
<p>i like it in the butt right yeah</p>
<p>no not always</p>
<p>he likes it wherever he likes it sometimes</p>
<p>in my mouth sometimes up my ass</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s just someone just</p>
<p>pushing it that&rsquo;s what that is that&rsquo;s pushing it</p>
<p>right you can&rsquo;t tell me that&rsquo;s different than bisexual</p>
<p>do people just</p>
<p>wanna label</p>
<p>people have to</p>
<p>label you like what&rsquo;s your deal</p>
<p>how could you call</p>
<p>queer how is that different than bisexual</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no argument if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>definition if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>definition of it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no difference i&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>basically by the way just off some dude on a message</p>
<p>board yeah he</p>
<p>might be not the most reliable of</p>
<p>himself but there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about it man i&rsquo;m like i think that</p>
<p>might be correct man</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it just</p>
<p>sounded so cause like</p>
<p>growing up i always</p>
<p>thought and you know this is just i mean i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where this came from in my head but growing up for me</p>
<p>queer was always just like you&rsquo;re just not</p>
<p>quite straight</p>
<p>i mean you&rsquo;re not totally</p>
<p>gay but you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>definitely not i</p>
<p>grew up queer</p>
<p>in boston was</p>
<p>was this another version of faggot</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah this game</p>
<p>is queer this</p>
<p>game is queer</p>
<p>and there was no our</p>
<p>queer at mma</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no rs in the</p>
<p>mma bloggers</p>
<p>queer it was never like</p>
<p>look at these</p>
<p>queers over here like if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of gay guys that</p>
<p>would sound odd</p>
<p>if there was a</p>
<p>bunch of gay guys</p>
<p>it would be like</p>
<p>you know a lot of guys</p>
<p>would say faggots</p>
<p>a lot of guys</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>queers or fags</p>
<p>faggots wasn&rsquo;t big for me growing up</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t a big word</p>
<p>queer was but faggots was kind of more like</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a college</p>
<p>yeah well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>momo&rsquo;s was a big one too</p>
<p>almost got that but</p>
<p>even that was like the same thing</p>
<p>it really is</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s really no argument that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like a desensitizing sort of an attitude</p>
<p>to use all these different gay</p>
<p>slurs is really no argument</p>
<p>but why are they so fun to use</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s annoying you know why it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause the way you said</p>
<p>earlier it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re growing up as a kid it&rsquo;s just fuck</p>
<p>you forbidden</p>
<p>be saying it yeah</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s taboo</p>
<p>so then it becomes</p>
<p>a part of your</p>
<p>vernacular it becomes a part of your vernacular so</p>
<p>as an adult it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>ingrained in you to be like</p>
<p>throw it out there because it has that</p>
<p>edge to it it&rsquo;s got an</p>
<p>extra notch</p>
<p>yeah extra notch that fuck</p>
<p>like cut has an</p>
<p>extra knots that&rsquo;s why i like</p>
<p>using love it</p>
<p>one of my favorite words yep you dumb</p>
<p>yeah bro that&rsquo;s a call</p>
<p>bottom of the barrel dude</p>
<p>you call somebody a dumb cunt at the look is</p>
<p>great though</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>that they shut her up</p>
<p>say unfollow</p>
<p>i cannot believe you used such derogatory</p>
<p>language towards women</p>
<p>meanwhile i was talking</p>
<p>about a dude</p>
<p>right i was</p>
<p>talking about</p>
<p>a dude and i had</p>
<p>people unfollow me because i used the word cunt</p>
<p>but i use the word cunt at</p>
<p>least once a week just to weed out the bitches</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s on my twitter</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>cunt get out of there get get</p>
<p>because people assume</p>
<p>that most people</p>
<p>twitter if they&rsquo;re in the public eye</p>
<p>is not going to really represent how they actually talk</p>
<p>most people</p>
<p>to give you some</p>
<p>like when was the last time ashton kutcher said</p>
<p>cunt in his twitter yeah you know what i mean i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>you hang out with ashton kutcher</p>
<p>and you have a couple</p>
<p>drinks and smoke a joint with them he just</p>
<p>sent that yeah of</p>
<p>course yeah you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna talk about this dumb cunt</p>
<p>right something mean</p>
<p>right everybody does man all the queers</p>
<p>he probably says</p>
<p>queer a lot it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>these queer cunts</p>
<p>but i think the</p>
<p>women that get</p>
<p>upset at that</p>
<p>women get upset at</p>
<p>using the word cunt those</p>
<p>are extra cunting</p>
<p>those women</p>
<p>are brutal that&rsquo;s who i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about they&rsquo;re brutal</p>
<p>they must be brutal</p>
<p>yeah give me a</p>
<p>chick that likes</p>
<p>to be called a cunt in a sack and now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>set for life one</p>
<p>particular chick you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about a particular</p>
<p>chick you can&rsquo;t call a</p>
<p>particular one a cunt</p>
<p>that degrades the entire</p>
<p>population of</p>
<p>humans with vaginas really</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like me being</p>
<p>upset if you call some guy a douchebag or call some guy</p>
<p>right a dick</p>
<p>you know what guy would</p>
<p>stand up and go i can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re talking that way</p>
<p>about men about all dudes</p>
<p>no guy would</p>
<p>know nobody nobody it&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>how dare you talk</p>
<p>about men like that that weak ass</p>
<p>thing that some people will say to you</p>
<p>like uh oh you hate</p>
<p>women you know</p>
<p>brian post saying that i</p>
<p>had this argument too i mean not argument rather i love</p>
<p>brian had this</p>
<p>discussion and he was having an argument</p>
<p>with some female comic</p>
<p>and he goes</p>
<p>and as soon as the argument got ugly she goes</p>
<p>i think you hate women</p>
<p>and he goes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really funny</p>
<p>because everyone that&rsquo;s ever said that to me i hate</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s hilarious well i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s just a weapon</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weak</p>
<p>a very specific</p>
<p>woman uses that weapon it&rsquo;s a political correct weapon</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when i&rsquo;ve been backed into a corner i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>throw that out there just because it&rsquo;s so tab</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like oh no i don&rsquo;t want you to think that</p>
<p>about me no</p>
<p>i hate your type of</p>
<p>woman that&rsquo;s what i hate it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bitch thing to say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a weak ass</p>
<p>you know like a fake</p>
<p>magic spell</p>
<p>you hate women</p>
<p>right oh is</p>
<p>that what it is</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>annoying like</p>
<p>all women are you exactly</p>
<p>right everyone</p>
<p>is the same</p>
<p>every single fucking</p>
<p>woman on the</p>
<p>planet is exactly the same there&rsquo;s no variation</p>
<p>i have hate for all of you just</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>annoying yeah</p>
<p>exactly that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so weak and they just try oh that&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing as what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with this</p>
<p>this whole like faggot</p>
<p>comment no i disagree really</p>
<p>why i disagree well</p>
<p>first of all all the by i hate</p>
<p>women all they&rsquo;re trying to do is put you on your heel</p>
<p>right trying to make you feel like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong with you they called you on it you hate</p>
<p>women of course you do and they like</p>
<p>stick with it</p>
<p>right you don&rsquo;t even know i know i don&rsquo;t hate</p>
<p>women i hate you no no no i&rsquo;m sure i can tell</p>
<p>you hate women i</p>
<p>see what you&rsquo;re doing you hate women</p>
<p>that you hate</p>
<p>women thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s them being weak that&rsquo;s all that is that&rsquo;s them</p>
<p>trying to look for some reason why you&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>some reason why you&rsquo;re bad some</p>
<p>giant blanket</p>
<p>statement to label you</p>
<p>but someone&rsquo;s saying faggot i mean that</p>
<p>legitimately is a slur</p>
<p>for homosexuals</p>
<p>right i suggest</p>
<p>you know even if you don&rsquo;t use it that way and i</p>
<p>would use it that way and even if</p>
<p>brian calls me i&rsquo;m like what&rsquo;s up faggot</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like how dare you</p>
<p>are we gonna go eat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we talk</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a slur at all by then but right</p>
<p>the term of</p>
<p>endearment it&rsquo;s actually the opposite</p>
<p>right yeah exactly</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too many meanings too confusing to some people</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s totally different than you hate women</p>
<p>someone saying that is just that&rsquo;s just the ultimate</p>
<p>stupid trump card</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i called it</p>
<p>i called it you hate women like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so dumb</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like no no dude ever says that fucking</p>

<p>yard kind of shit you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>for real like</p>
<p>i knew a dude when i was</p>
<p>thirteen i was thirteen i was fourteen i was fourteen</p>
<p>he was a gay hustler</p>
<p>he was a friend of a friend of mine&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and they would like they</p>
<p>would do drugs together this guy had like a real coke</p>
<p>thing and i</p>
<p>think this guy</p>
<p>got him the stuff and</p>
<p>and we were all hanging out one</p>
<p>night i was like what is that guy do</p>
<p>he was like a little</p>
<p>older than us he was like</p>
<p>seventeen right</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>makes money</p>
<p>just doing a lot of shit that he shouldn&rsquo;t be doing</p>
<p>this is my friend</p>
<p>jimmy who used to talk like in code like</p>
<p>that he was like real blue collar construction guy yeah</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s very vague</p>
<p>so eventually i</p>
<p>found out this guy was like</p>
<p>he used to but he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do it anymore</p>
<p>apparently he&rsquo;s done with it</p>
<p>he was like a gay hustler</p>
<p>what exactly is a gay hustler dude a gay</p>
<p>hustler&rsquo;s like you go out with rich dudes and suck</p>
<p>their dicks</p>
<p>right and give you</p>
<p>money right</p>
<p>and you hang out with them</p>
<p>you know you hang out with them like for the night and</p>
<p>you make it look like you</p>
<p>party and you&rsquo;re like a</p>
<p>party boy and you go from one</p>
<p>place to another and that&rsquo;s how you make your living</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what this dude was doing</p>
<p>and he wasn&rsquo;t gay</p>
<p>apparently just yeah i got a problem with drugs back</p>
<p>then he fucked up</p>
<p>sucking a lot of dick this was the strangest fucking</p>
<p>thing you know i was like i</p>
<p>guess i was fifteen at the time</p>
<p>i might even been sixteen now i think</p>
<p>about now as boston</p>
<p>as when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>driving yeah</p>
<p>so he might have been a bit</p>
<p>older now that i think</p>
<p>about it because i</p>
<p>think i was</p>
<p>driving at the time so i must have been sixteen</p>
<p>but it was that some eye opening shit</p>
<p>right there when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like god damn</p>
<p>yeah man what a so</p>
<p>you get to see a lot of shitty choices</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>about growing up you get to see a lot of shitty choices</p>
<p>like i talked</p>
<p>about this in the podcast that</p>
<p>i never did coke because my friend</p>
<p>jimmy his cousin was selling it</p>
<p>his cousin never left the attic him and his girlfriend</p>
<p>just had an</p>
<p>apartment in the attic</p>
<p>boarded up windows</p>
<p>and fucking hid from the world</p>
<p>and he lost like 15</p>
<p>pounds and they just look pale as fuck</p>
<p>they always looked like death</p>
<p>and i was like this dude</p>
<p>is like disappearing to this drug like this is nuts</p>

<p>where your teeth</p>
<p>start falling out you know what i mean like heroin</p>
<p>crack coke it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>grind i draw the line</p>
<p>where your teeth</p>
<p>start falling out and i mean if</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bad when like you see somebody they just don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>teeth they don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>have you ever like have you ever</p>
<p>slept next to somebody that just ground</p>

<p>i know very deeply</p>
<p>thought i think a lot</p>

<p>about space and</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>scientific discoveries and you</p>
<p>know and then</p>
<p>you know what is life and what is this all</p>

<p>about all that stuff</p>
<p>but when it comes to</p>
<p>laughing like</p>
<p>silly laughter</p>
<p>i like my shit dumb</p>
<p>i like a lot of shit dumb</p>
<p>i like some</p>
<p>clever i like</p>
<p>clever thrown in there with it</p>

<p>stuff i love that like</p>
<p>really well</p>
<p>crafted piece that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird and strange and then mix it in with some just</p>
<p>silly ass dick jokes yeah</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>i mean just like</p>
<p>eight premises in my act were a dude</p>
<p>somehow another ones that blow some kind</p>

<p>right i&rsquo;m just a</p>
<p>child i&rsquo;m a fucking so juvenile</p>
<p>comes to my</p>
<p>sense of humor yeah</p>
<p>right and i</p>
<p>think everybody is i mean everybody has like</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>learn to laugh it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>weird hiccup</p>
<p>that only like humans the</p>
<p>human animal has</p>
<p>from being surprised it really is it works a lot like</p>
<p>magic like magic you suspend disbelief</p>
<p>and like when you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>stand up or even just joke telling it&rsquo;s like people</p>
<p>think they know</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>right their</p>
<p>brains constantly trying to be</p>
<p>ahead of you</p>
<p>and when you flip it on them</p>
<p>it creates this</p>
<p>weird hiccup</p>
<p>that the only</p>
<p>human you know</p>
<p>what i mean yeah so it&rsquo;s very old i mean it&rsquo;s old</p>
<p>you know you can</p>
<p>scare babies when you</p>
<p>scare babies at that</p>
<p>age they hit a certain age when</p>
<p>laughter becomes</p>
<p>you know in</p>
<p>their in their life</p>
<p>and when you like you can</p>
<p>startle a baby and they&rsquo;ll actually</p>
<p>laugh that&rsquo;s only one type of</p>
<p>laughter like joey</p>
<p>diaz you know exactly what&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny there&rsquo;s no tricks</p>
<p>right you know i&rsquo;m saying he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right like no but that he&rsquo;s not and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>grandma please but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bump get it</p>
<p>you thought it was</p>
<p>gonna be a no but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>my grandma right</p>
<p>cocksuckers i</p>
<p>tricked you</p>
<p>again yeah no that&rsquo;s exactly i&rsquo;m totally</p>
<p>agreeing with you</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just like there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about that other kind of</p>
<p>laughter where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re laughing at it just because it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>funny the way</p>
<p>that the person is just a cartoon he&rsquo;s so cartoony</p>
<p>yeah i love</p>
<p>listening to him talk there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of different ways for</p>
<p>things to be</p>
<p>funny or reasons why</p>
<p>things are funny</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>thing is find the most</p>
<p>find the most</p>
<p>things like ironic</p>
<p>things are funny like</p>
<p>movies unintentional comedies</p>
<p>like grizzly man we were talking</p>
<p>about that before the show</p>
<p>how funny grizzly man is</p>
<p>how funny r kelly is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really funny</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a different kind of funny</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like oh my</p>
<p>god he&rsquo;s serious it&rsquo;s like i can&rsquo;t believe yeah exactly</p>
<p>right right i mean there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of different kinds of</p>
<p>funny but that&rsquo;s the key if you want to be a</p>
<p>happy person</p>
<p>have as many of</p>
<p>those in the mix as possible this is</p>
<p>the problem one of the big problems i have with all</p>
<p>these alternative</p>
<p>comedy guys there&rsquo;s a lot of guys that</p>
<p>they become like sort of comedy</p>
<p>snobs yeah can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stand it and</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing is and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re upset of anybody talks</p>
<p>about sex like</p>
<p>i know this one guy who got</p>
<p>upset at a friend of ours because he talks</p>
<p>about sex a lot</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re better than that like why are you resorting to</p>
<p>cheap jokes like</p>
<p>man this guy is a</p>
<p>sexual deviant this is what he thinks</p>
<p>about all the time</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t he just talk</p>
<p>about sex you know</p>
<p>what do you care it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>allow certain</p>
<p>things to be</p>
<p>funny because they feel like it&rsquo;s beneath them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s such a subjective</p>
<p>thing like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny that you mentioned i was talking</p>
<p>about this earlier with</p>
<p>might even be the same person we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about right here</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s such a subjective</p>
<p>thing like you there&rsquo;s always all</p>
<p>these comedy con</p>
<p>san francisco comedy competition and shit it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>how can you be</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>judge clever guy</p>
<p>like joey diaz will</p>
<p>never win one of</p>
<p>those yeah but it yeah i don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>absolutely yeah it&rsquo;s like how do you</p>
<p>judge something that is so opinion</p>
<p>based like everybody</p>
<p>know you might find this</p>
<p>funny or that funnier and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and that alternative comedy</p>
<p>scene where they are so judgmental</p>
<p>and you know and that&rsquo;s such a it&rsquo;s a country</p>
<p>defense it is a defense mechanism like a lot of</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re you know</p>
<p>ostracized by</p>
<p>clubs or they can&rsquo;t get into the regular clubs regular</p>
<p>scene and they</p>
<p>develop this</p>
<p>clicky little circuit</p>
<p>right where they just look down on everybody</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>i was there for</p>
<p>the beginning of that alternative conference i remember</p>
<p>very well well no no no i bet you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because i was there in cambridge massachusetts at the</p>
<p>catch rising</p>
<p>start i really</p>
<p>started it was really i they meant out here is really</p>
<p>david cross</p>
<p>david cross</p>
<p>started it all off</p>
<p>but what he was doing is very different than what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on now what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on now is a lot of people are really</p>
<p>basically doing</p>
<p>standard stand up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>stand up where they don&rsquo;t exert a lot of energy</p>
<p>right and they try to be like a certain</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to have a certain amount of you know</p>
<p>clever words tossed into</p>
<p>their comedy yeah</p>
<p>they try to</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>try to have really well written</p>
<p>stuff they try to impress you</p>
<p>know comedy right</p>
<p>geeks with like</p>
<p>people who like</p>
<p>absolutely what</p>
<p>cross was doing he did a lot of</p>
<p>weird shit man he was taking a lot of chances</p>
<p>like some of</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t work but i always appreciated that he</p>
<p>was doing it was always really interesting to me like</p>
<p>i remember one time i went to</p>
<p>catch and i was waiting on</p>
<p>stage and he was</p>
<p>doing this crazy</p>
<p>thing when i walked in the room</p>
<p>where he was</p>
<p>just had an exercise</p>
<p>video not an</p>
<p>video rather an</p>
<p>audio tape that was telling him how to stretch out</p>
<p>right and he was like doing it and commenting like</p>
<p>wow it really does feel like it&rsquo;s stretching me out</p>
<p>right it was so strange well it&rsquo;s very that they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what to do they didn&rsquo;t know whether they should</p>
<p>laugh didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know whether they should</p>
<p>very like coffee man</p>
<p>it was but he was like</p>
<p>really committed to it and</p>
<p>the way he was</p>
<p>behaving was like the</p>
<p>crowd should be</p>
<p>like on the same wavelength as</p>
<p>him like wow</p>
<p>this is really stretching me out</p>
<p>like it was like this</p>
<p>weird sort of performance art</p>
<p>thing that he was doing right</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t really work that good but i remember</p>
<p>thinking like wow this guy&rsquo;s like doing some</p>
<p>interesting shit it makes you think like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing like kind of cut and dry</p>
<p>like standard</p>
<p>stand up like</p>
<p>right maybe</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m doing is not as interesting as what this</p>
<p>right it makes you see</p>
<p>how broad the actual spectrum</p>
<p>is of what you can get away with what you can say</p>
<p>how you can make anything</p>
<p>funny versus like</p>
<p>right and he was fucking around he was</p>
<p>experimenting but that was</p>
<p>that was in my opinion that&rsquo;s real true alternative</p>
<p>stand up he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>trying a bunch of different</p>
<p>things he was doing that was just one example</p>
<p>but he was very creative he did a lot of different</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>right but what</p>
<p>i see a lot of people calling alternative</p>
<p>stand up is like</p>
<p>stand up comedy that you</p>
<p>would expect from</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s into alternative music</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve decided to</p>
<p>love the same</p>
<p>clothes sure</p>
<p>into comedy</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>do we wear this outfit and now you&rsquo;re a comedian</p>
<p>right and do what you</p>
<p>think you know</p>
<p>those guys would</p>
<p>appreciate they were too hip for the</p>
<p>room but that&rsquo;s exactly what it has</p>
<p>become it&rsquo;s not saying that&rsquo;s what it is and you know</p>
<p>cause i think originally</p>
<p>started this sort of like a</p>
<p>like a counter culture</p>
<p>thing to the</p>
<p>stand up comedy boom</p>
<p>of the 80s and</p>
<p>even early 90s and then</p>
<p>you got this like spin off</p>
<p>thing with like</p>
<p>cross and odenkirk and all</p>
<p>those kind of guys</p>
<p>which were kind of doing the</p>
<p>counter the</p>
<p>stuff you couldn&rsquo;t get away with with doing clubs</p>
<p>which is not such</p>
<p>shiny materials longer premises talking about shit</p>
<p>even more political</p>
<p>clouds we are smart</p>
<p>yeah sure and</p>
<p>you know big in san francisco like you know austin</p>
<p>places like that yeah and</p>
<p>and what happens is it just got</p>
<p>watered down</p>
<p>you got all</p>
<p>these people they&rsquo;re like i</p>
<p>wanna be like that</p>
<p>so they just it</p>
<p>became a cookie cutter situation you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>right you know what i mean and now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting really true alternative comedians</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting fans of true alternative</p>
<p>comics doing</p>
<p>like material</p>
<p>you know and i</p>
<p>think i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>caused sort of a um</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>cause more like a push back to like</p>
<p>you know traditional if there is a lot</p>
<p>of them are</p>
<p>doing traditional</p>
<p>stand up exactly that&rsquo;s what i mean because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>stand up they&rsquo;re just doing premises they</p>
<p>think an alternative guy</p>
<p>or gal it&rsquo;s like if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pillow</p>
<p>fight all the</p>
<p>feathers are out of that pillow you know i mean a</p>
<p>bunch of people just</p>
<p>swing in empty pillowcases it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna you know it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re putting on an act</p>
<p>totally that&rsquo;s the act yeah and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just because that</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an oversaturated</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an oversaturated</p>
<p>style but there is a good argument though for having a</p>
<p>place where</p>
<p>that kind of comedy</p>
<p>gets a chance to grow i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a necessity</p>
<p>experimental comedy i totally</p>
<p>agree call it alternative is like a good move yeah</p>
<p>to figure out</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s got to be some</p>
<p>the real problem with our whole</p>
<p>thing is that comedy is just like one</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like no one just goes</p>
<p>to see music</p>
<p>you know like what kind of</p>
<p>music is this is it rock and roll</p>
<p>is it country</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what</p>
<p>we deal with is like symphony</p>
<p>and rock and roll are all lumped in</p>
<p>together as one</p>
<p>thing right and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what gets on before you really makes a big difference</p>
<p>if joe diaz goes on before you and just</p>
<p>starts talking about</p>
<p>you know pulling turds out of some girl&rsquo;s butthole yeah</p>
<p>stuffing his</p>
<p>getting two</p>
<p>points on his weight</p>
<p>watches for</p>
<p>a girl&rsquo;s ass</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m eating her ass</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m licking a</p>
<p>monkey from behind i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sticking my nose in her asshole i&rsquo;m doing the pigeon</p>
<p>right because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a chicken</p>
<p>but what the fuck</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s doing that and then you</p>
<p>wanna go do that stretching</p>
<p>video people are</p>
<p>gonna throw</p>
<p>glasses at you</p>
<p>absolutely you can&rsquo;t do the two of them on the same</p>
<p>stage it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s some people that</p>
<p>might not wanna see</p>
<p>that weird thing</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;re not into like overtly</p>
<p>ridiculously</p>
<p>sexual juvenile material and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a taste issue</p>
<p>right and that&rsquo;s why saying it&rsquo;s the same reason</p>
<p>like these comedy competition</p>
<p>things are bullshit</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>how can you you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like such a fucking opinion</p>
<p>based thing</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>and what do i like and it&rsquo;s your own personal</p>
<p>taste so who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s the winner</p>
<p>right there joey</p>
<p>you know what i mean it&rsquo;s like whoever</p>
<p>music&rsquo;s the same way though i mean if you really think</p>
<p>about it people who</p>
<p>judge like rolling</p>
<p>stone they say the cd&rsquo;s like five stars when</p>
<p>you know to</p>
<p>another person that cd is the best fucking cd in the</p>
<p>whole entire yeah</p>
<p>what you know what you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have is like you know the rolling</p>
<p>stones having to</p>
<p>you know schlep all</p>
<p>their gear up to seattle to just like you know</p>
<p>compete against</p>
<p>every other new band for</p>
<p>to be able to put on</p>
<p>their resume i won the</p>
<p>seattle band</p>
<p>competition or whatever if you&rsquo;re yeah</p>
<p>for a comic though that</p>
<p>does mean something that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying it really</p>
<p>does i mean you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>at a club and it says on the marquee</p>
<p>you know jason</p>
<p>t ball winner of the</p>
<p>seattle comedy competition</p>
<p>yeah i know a lot of</p>
<p>good people i mean</p>
<p>that was very like it really helped when a</p>
<p>magical one the san francisco comedy competition did it</p>
<p>launched him into a lot i mean you</p>
<p>very good friend of mine i was good</p>
<p>buddy of yours</p>
<p>you know that was very you know that launch</p>
<p>you know because it gets it matters to industry</p>
<p>i worked with al</p>
<p>magico we worked together at the old cobs</p>
<p>the old cobs was this tiny</p>
<p>room it was like</p>
<p>150 seats it was awesome yeah san francisco&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great the old</p>
<p>cobs was the shit</p>
<p>dude it was like one of the</p>
<p>smaller rooms in the country</p>
<p>and it was so good there was a bigger</p>
<p>place that i was working at and i&rsquo;d rather work at the</p>
<p>small place it was like so cool but then</p>
<p>somehow or another it caught on fire or some shit and</p>
<p>they moved out</p>
<p>something happened</p>
<p>they moved out and they moved to</p>
<p>they might just</p>
<p>moved out i</p>
<p>might have made up the fire part or the fire part</p>
<p>might have happened</p>
<p>after them it</p>
<p>might have been</p>
<p>the new company that took over because it became the</p>
<p>green room afterwards right</p>
<p>but then they opened up cobs the new cobs which is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way better because more people can get to see it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a way bigger</p>
<p>crowd but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have that like personal</p>
<p>kind of like you know there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about being in a room with like 200 people</p>
<p>you know like when you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>or at the comedy</p>
<p>store and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>packed it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>maybe 190 or something was a</p>
<p>seat something like that yeah something like that</p>
<p>less than 200</p>
<p>that shit is magic man</p>
<p>when you get a tight packed</p>
<p>group of people like that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a low ceiling and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>dark room everybody&rsquo;s in there and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like so</p>
<p>rounded the</p>
<p>best is like when you&rsquo;re doing do you remember</p>
<p>how dublins used to be</p>
<p>did you ever</p>
<p>used to do that gig</p>
<p>it was okay but dublin&rsquo;s had that bar</p>
<p>where always</p>
<p>people would be talking yeah but i mean</p>
<p>where it was just like</p>
<p>a wall of people around you that was the best i just</p>
<p>loved doing dublin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah there was a lot of arguments at dublin&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>stealing material</p>
<p>about i remember a lot of that</p>
<p>i remember like</p>
<p>get the fuck away from here</p>
<p>a lot of people didn&rsquo;t like working there</p>
<p>that place got closed down for</p>
<p>noise ordinance reasons</p>
<p>really yeah that&rsquo;s why all the people all the houses</p>
<p>right up in the hill</p>

<p>close that and they</p>
<p>went up having to sell it or something wow now i don&rsquo;t</p>

<p>this shit up</p>
<p>right right</p>

<p>this fucking</p>
<p>clubs are only good</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>ecstasy in those clubs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s at because you can&rsquo;t hear you</p>
<p>see you just</p>
<p>yeah those places are</p>
<p>built for drugs it wasn&rsquo;t bad because we were</p>
<p>super baked</p>
<p>right we were</p>
<p>super duper</p>
<p>right and you&rsquo;re all together like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re with</p>
<p>all your buddies you&rsquo;re not just like like the</p>
<p>worst on the club like that is like you and your buddy</p>
<p>go to a joint like that</p>
<p>trying to pick up on</p>
<p>chicks or whatever just</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>dude it was</p>
<p>it was a nightmare</p>
<p>when i was like you know in my twenties or</p>
<p>early thirties i</p>
<p>thought of doing it now like fuck that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>that off that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where that culture of of man hating comes from</p>
<p>it comes to men</p>
<p>trying and trying and trying to get</p>
<p>women eating shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also trying to get</p>
<p>women and failing</p>
<p>and trying and failing and then developing a resentment</p>
<p>like my friend used to call girls lesbians</p>
<p>he was really just an unattractive dude</p>
<p>and you know he</p>
<p>really had a hard time getting girls</p>
<p>and so he was constantly getting this negative feeling</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>so he developed this</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even get to</p>
<p>see your personality</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s even getting to know anybody you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even talk to each</p>
<p>other it&rsquo;s purely like lust animal</p>
<p>noise and moving</p>
<p>to vibrations</p>
<p>and then alcohol for shitty decision making</p>
<p>right and then</p>
<p>grinding against your dick so your dick</p>
<p>starts getting hard now</p>
<p>all your thinking&rsquo;s out the way</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s purely caveman</p>
<p>monkey shit</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>it turns into like just your dna just</p>
<p>starts acting up it&rsquo;s the dumbest shit ever</p>
<p>did you see that shit that they closed</p>
<p>down at lax they closed down one of the terminals last</p>
<p>night for like a few</p>
<p>hours because this woman</p>
<p>start like fell down on the ground and had to call the</p>
<p>ambulances and</p>
<p>stuff and like</p>
<p>she ate a pot cookie</p>
<p>and she really she</p>
<p>blacked out</p>
<p>yeah she blacked out or did something or god</p>
<p>she accidentally</p>
<p>ate one or no</p>
<p>no she did eat one</p>
<p>and then these rookies are</p>
<p>gonna fuck it up for everybody man</p>
<p>so they love</p>
<p>that up in the media too</p>
<p>because of this busiest</p>
<p>you know busiest</p>
<p>travel day ever though imagine being</p>
<p>waiting in line to go on your</p>
<p>plane that some</p>
<p>chick couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>handle a pot cookie is that really true yeah</p>
<p>it was on the other</p>
<p>do you have a news</p>
<p>story son is on</p>
<p>on mbc four</p>
<p>or los angeles</p>
<p>i have a bit that&rsquo;s a true bit that i&rsquo;m working on</p>
<p>right now that i just what</p>
<p>is it recently</p>
<p>about i took a pot cookie</p>
<p>and i got on a</p>
<p>plane but the</p>
<p>plane was delayed</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re headed to london</p>
<p>right i was sitting in the the</p>
<p>lobby of the</p>
<p>plane in the waiting area what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>called what is that called time at</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re actually on the plane</p>
<p>waiting to get on the</p>
<p>plane oh the gate</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>sitting at the</p>
<p>gate sitting at the gate and cnn is on</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m so baked i&rsquo;m so paranoid</p>
<p>freaked out</p>
<p>thinking about my mortality</p>
<p>thinking about what will the</p>
<p>earth ever explore</p>
<p>what happens if a meteor comes</p>
<p>would they tell us</p>
<p>looking at fucking</p>
<p>ufos over typical joe rogan</p>
<p>thoughts right</p>
<p>but but super</p>
<p>super super big</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>point where i&rsquo;m like whoa i am way too high to be</p>
<p>sitting by myself in in the airport waiting to get to</p>

<p>by the time we got on the</p>
<p>plane he told me</p>
<p>that at the moment we</p>
<p>first got on the</p>
<p>plane before it took off</p>
<p>he was seriously considering</p>
<p>running up to them and asking them to let him off the</p>
<p>plane he goes i had to keep it together</p>

<p>the fact that he went back to it so</p>

<p>yeah that&rsquo;s the best part</p>
<p>and somebody</p>
<p>comes in he&rsquo;s like hey take it easy i made all</p>
<p>those edibles man</p>
<p>take it easy on that like you know</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat don&rsquo;t eat too he&rsquo;s like if i was you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d only eat a half of a cookie</p>
<p>i already killed a cookie</p>
<p>and like i&rsquo;m one bite into my</p>
<p>second cookie</p>
<p>stoned as fuck off of a fucking joint</p>
<p>and i had that feeling you know that feeling</p>
<p>where you can feel like the adrenaline like the</p>
<p>blood rush out of your face like oh i&rsquo;m fine it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a terrible feeling</p>
<p>dude i looked</p>
<p>asian for my set</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m literally just like did you guys</p>
<p>talk when you&rsquo;re up there</p>
<p>yeah and i you know what i just because of the</p>
<p>crowd itself like i just went with fucking</p>
<p>i told the story</p>
<p>you know what i mean and it went</p>
<p>over really good i&rsquo;m like the only way out of this the</p>
<p>only weed show</p>
<p>though exactly</p>
<p>dude the only way out of this and i just kept</p>
<p>referencing you know i</p>
<p>actually went actually really good because i told the</p>
<p>whole story</p>
<p>you know then</p>
<p>then the dude coming in and telling me how the fucking</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t eat half of one of those</p>
<p>and as soon as i&rsquo;m like i</p>
<p>ate one of the cookies</p>
<p>everyone in the</p>
<p>crowds like oh shit</p>
<p>i had some of the most</p>
<p>disconnected sets in my life</p>
<p>doing those howard der</p>
<p>dover shows yeah</p>
<p>because everybody</p>
<p>would be there with weed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>will be cookies and it&rsquo;s the most corn</p>
<p>and dude i it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the popcorn oh the yeah pop</p>
<p>pop pop ice</p>
<p>cream pop ice</p>
<p>cream embarrass</p>
<p>a too much pop popcorn and yeah</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>frightened for his life yeah</p>
<p>i lied i love</p>
<p>paris i think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i think paris is hilarious he is very hilarious</p>
<p>that shit&rsquo;s very dangerous the popcorn yeah</p>
<p>that stuff is</p>
<p>strong there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>worth being</p>
<p>too high and that&rsquo;s what i was saying</p>
<p>about edibles that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re dangerous because like</p>
<p>dude smoking a joint smoking a bong anything like that</p>
<p>i can you know what i mean i ritualistically i</p>
<p>can kind of control my intake</p>
<p>but i gotta tell you man some of my best</p>
<p>learning experiences</p>
<p>where we get real</p>
<p>introspective and</p>
<p>break shit down almost</p>
<p>all that shit has come from me eating pot yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tripping from</p>
<p>edibles are more so than smoking it you mean you are</p>
<p>tripping it is</p>
<p>right look when when i go into</p>
<p>the tank i prefer to eat pot before i go in the tank</p>
<p>because it makes it more</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>the eating pot when you</p>
<p>close your eyes if you have like a real heavy dose</p>
<p>if you eat like</p>
<p>a big cookie or something i&rsquo;ve done this so many</p>
<p>times on planes</p>
<p>when you close your eyes and you have</p>
<p>these mad visions</p>
<p>like really nutty it&rsquo;s always like</p>
<p>like the that&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>love that cartoon like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always very</p>
<p>colorful and moving</p>
<p>and constantly</p>
<p>changing it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>very psychedelic</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a totally</p>
<p>different ride</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally different put in pot yeah it&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>than smoking and everybody that eats that shit</p>
<p>is just like oh i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna a big</p>
<p>no dude this</p>
<p>is a fucking buckle your seatbelt kind of</p>
<p>shit a lot of times</p>
<p>gonna change your life</p>
<p>homie yeah this is a</p>
<p>you know turn the tv off and yeah yeah this is</p>
<p>kick it by yourself</p>
<p>in a dark room in</p>
<p>right silent darkness</p>
<p>right trying to figure out your life totally different</p>
<p>freaking out you you are</p>
<p>gonna be freaking out about</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;ve ever done ever i&rsquo;m like fuck what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with me</p>
<p>right fuck i</p>
<p>gotta get my shit together hey</p>
<p>dude how do i</p>
<p>still work at my job</p>
<p>you know what i mean that&rsquo;s always people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>first one that&rsquo;s the gate into there is</p>
<p>i hate my job and then it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>tom segura and i went to detroit i gave him an</p>
<p>edible right before we got on the</p>
<p>plane no and</p>
<p>he broke his</p>
<p>whole life down on the flight for our</p>
<p>flight he landed</p>
<p>goes dude i just figured out a lot of shit</p>
<p>about my life</p>
<p>really you know i&rsquo;ve done that so many times</p>
<p>eddie bravo&rsquo;s done that so many times did he</p>
<p>do it in your</p>
<p>ear or did he do it to himself oh and mentioned it</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>told me right</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>so dude i really went through some shit on that flight</p>
<p>of course the next day though is</p>
<p>i i&rsquo;ve really</p>
<p>broke it down on my</p>
<p>unicorn in my past life you know like like he probably</p>
<p>shit oh brian</p>
<p>what i mean like does he believe in that</p>
<p>breaking down now</p>
<p>would be interesting to</p>
<p>talk now no</p>
<p>i was think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy shit no it was</p>
<p>really objective what he was saying it was just talking</p>
<p>about his diet in his</p>
<p>work ethic and a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>things it was really like</p>
<p>it was obviously</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>were bothering him that he hadn&rsquo;t been addressing</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s some drugs that make it bad</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s drugs that actually like you know pot all</p>
<p>those different ones have a functionality</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the ones that make it bad for</p>
<p>everything it&rsquo;s like the rotten</p>
<p>apple it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>ever ever i guarantee it</p>
<p>smoked a joint and robbed a bank</p>
<p>or done any bullshit</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>i would be the</p>
<p>first thing i</p>
<p>did before i rob</p>
<p>the bank got</p>
<p>being high gangsters</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m saying not from fucking well i</p>
<p>think calling all putting all drugs</p>
<p>under the name</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s affect your mind</p>
<p>under the name drugs</p>
<p>is just as ridiculous</p>
<p>as one guy getting in an argument with one</p>
<p>chick and that guy saying well he hates all</p>
<p>women right</p>
<p>right i got</p>
<p>you you know i&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s totally bro struggling</p>
<p>are they vary in their</p>
<p>effects so much</p>
<p>the spectrum is so broad</p>
<p>from you know i mean</p>
<p>everything is considered</p>
<p>like when you go</p>
<p>to saudi arabia or if you go to dubai</p>
<p>you know i know</p>
<p>people that were arrested for having melatonin</p>
<p>how about that</p>
<p>melatonin which is a</p>
<p>naturally occurring substance that helps you</p>
<p>sleep right natural</p>
<p>supplement that you buy at the store</p>
<p>people get arrested in dubai</p>
<p>if you have fucking melatonin</p>
<p>can you make it into another drug it&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>those like no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nothing it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>fucking no i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s related</p>
<p>to a lot of</p>
<p>psychedelic compounds</p>
<p>chemically but it&rsquo;s not i mean all it does is help you</p>
<p>sleep and you get arrested</p>
<p>for that shit man it&rsquo;s illegal you can&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>that is such a mild and innocuous</p>
<p>drug or or psychoactive herb i mean whatever you</p>
<p>think i mean</p>
<p>if it calms you down i</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s got to be considered something</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s got to be</p>
<p>psychoactive but i mean it&rsquo;s one hundred i mean i</p>
<p>guess i&rsquo;m time of the united</p>
<p>states one hundred</p>
<p>percent legal you get that shit it between</p>
<p>counter the variation between that though and</p>
<p>oxycontin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right through the roof</p>

<p>things in the same category and they shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>

<p>broad spectrum of</p>
<p>human behavior</p>
<p>and when people are douchey to you</p>
<p>it just lets you know that</p>
<p>those douchey people are out there and</p>
<p>then you become immune to them it&rsquo;s like getting bit</p>
<p>by rattlesnakes a</p>
<p>bunch of times</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>right you know after a</p>
<p>while you can get bit by them and nothing happens</p>

<p>wanna listen to this richard dawkins</p>
<p>yes and this what is well anyway</p>
<p>segue came back</p>
<p>i you know i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like reading hate mail it&rsquo;s like i know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying like i don&rsquo;t need to hear it i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need it it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing if there&rsquo;s a criticism of someone&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>reasonable and</p>
<p>rational and they have something to say like you can</p>
<p>learn from them</p>
<p>because you only</p>
<p>learn so much from people doing douchey</p>
<p>shit so i don&rsquo;t invite it like you can invite it like</p>
<p>i remember man</p>
<p>steely used to have a</p>
<p>thing on his</p>
<p>website he had</p>
<p>love mail and hate mail</p>
<p>you could get send him hate mail</p>
<p>but it was so overwhelmed that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>scale i&rsquo;d like to see how that tipping of that scale</p>
<p>and he got beaten down by</p>
<p>the fucking sat</p>
<p>nami of shit man</p>
<p>shut the site down and yeah and so</p>
<p>he had abandoned that shed he had abandoned</p>
<p>all ideas of that but</p>
<p>the idea is that you don&rsquo;t want to give someone</p>
<p>the green light</p>
<p>to go and be a douche</p>
<p>oh yeah no there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many people</p>
<p>that are on the fence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>right right that&rsquo;s what kind of sucks</p>
<p>about editing heckler</p>
<p>videos when we</p>
<p>do a lot of heckler</p>
<p>videos and then</p>
<p>is that it opens pandora&rsquo;s box</p>
<p>because they want a</p>
<p>video made for them and said me</p>
<p>joe had like maybe</p>
<p>ten more heckler videos</p>
<p>since the last one that we</p>
<p>could have done but then we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just not do that just just drunk</p>
<p>idiots just people looking for</p>
<p>their attention</p>
<p>i love that one</p>
<p>video that you guys had when</p>
<p>it was out to the comedy</p>

<p>doing 3d games right yeah</p>
<p>call of duty</p>
<p>3d games and 3d laptops now they have 3d laptops yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s stupid to me</p>
<p>is it yeah i</p>
<p>mean laptops are for portable use so what are you</p>
<p>gonna be taking your</p>
<p>3d games to the airport and stuff</p>
<p>yeah dude some people who</p>
<p>travel they</p>
<p>travel with</p>
<p>those fucking alienware</p>
<p>things dudes were really hardcore</p>
<p>i ran to some chick the</p>
<p>other day at the coffee shop she had one of those</p>
<p>alienware things</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s alienware</p>
<p>alienware is like a company</p>
<p>that makes gaming computers they make tie</p>
<p>and pcs like</p>
<p>serious graphics</p>
<p>cards yeah for</p>
<p>the people that</p>
<p>never see the sun</p>
<p>yeah and this fucking gaming computer this chick</p>
<p>had was like old school</p>
<p>thick it was like</p>
<p>phone book thick</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>fuck had a crank on the side of it yeah and her</p>
<p>power thing the</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>cable you know the</p>
<p>brick what is that called</p>
<p>the brick that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>part of the</p>
<p>power cable</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>brick part the brick</p>
<p>is that what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>good guess you</p>
<p>know her brick was</p>
<p>like i have a mac</p>
<p>laptop hers was</p>
<p>at least four</p>
<p>if not five times bigger than mine it was</p>
<p>giant but i bet she has 20 usb</p>
<p>ports where</p>
<p>mines are only rocking</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>annoying that&rsquo;s one good</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>those big ass laptops they have</p>
<p>everything you want you know it has blu ray they have</p>
<p>everything there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>things you can&rsquo;t get if you have</p>
<p>a mac like if you have blu ray discs you can&rsquo;t play it</p>
<p>right they just don&rsquo;t play i</p>
<p>understand that though but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stupid i think if it&rsquo;s available it</p>
<p>should be an option i think it</p>
<p>should be an option for anybody selling computers</p>
<p>if you have that shit it&rsquo;s a big part of your homes and</p>
<p>especially your</p>
<p>claim to be the best i mean max</p>
<p>for the most part</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m a mac guy</p>
<p>i understand that</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to accept that sony came up with the</p>
<p>standard you know and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some ego shit yeah yeah</p>
<p>right blu rays are popular as fuck well</p>
<p>i think stop being cunts yeah well i</p>
<p>think the whole</p>
<p>point is that we&rsquo;re moving to just straight digital</p>
<p>media like this is</p>
<p>gonna be a quick</p>
<p>run for this blu ray</p>
<p>and especially when</p>
<p>apple is the number one selling how</p>
<p>quick it&rsquo;s been a few years</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in technological terms yes</p>
<p>a lifetime but that&rsquo;s like stabbing</p>
<p>apple in the back because instead of getting if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a blu ray player you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna use blu rays on your laptop so instead you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be using itunes and downloading</p>
<p>kick ass for</p>
<p>three dollars off itunes you</p>
<p>know and so yeah but what what if you don&rsquo;t have a home</p>
<p>stereo that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or a home theater</p>
<p>system that&rsquo;s connected to a computer yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that&rsquo;s i thought</p>
<p>you probably</p>
<p>already dvd then because i mean the resolution for your</p>
<p>screen doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway</p>
<p>but it does if you have</p>
<p>blu ray if you have a blu ray and you have a big screen</p>
<p>no no i&rsquo;m saying it for your laptop</p>
<p>if you know okay</p>
<p>but what i&rsquo;m saying is that if a dude has a blu ray</p>
<p>and he has a blu ray</p>
<p>dvd player and he</p>
<p>watches it on his big</p>
<p>screen and he buys a blu ray disc</p>
<p>and he wants to</p>
<p>watch the rest</p>
<p>of it on his flight to fucking new jersey</p>
<p>you should be able to</p>
<p>stick that shit</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s why a lot of them</p>
<p>come with like a digital</p>
<p>yeah the version of</p>
<p>you get the blu ray</p>
<p>a lot of them don&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>would say at</p>
<p>least half of them yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>they used to all have it right</p>
<p>is i i actually was</p>
<p>under the impression that they</p>
<p>they used to not and now there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>amazon even for that</p>
<p>exact reason that you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about is that</p>
<p>people are being like that sucks because i can only</p>
<p>watch it on my one fucking</p>
<p>tv in my basement i can&rsquo;t watch it</p>
<p>and amazon just</p>
<p>started this</p>
<p>thing where it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>buy the movie from amazon and you</p>
<p>could immediately</p>
<p>watch it on</p>
<p>on your computer</p>
<p>oh really yeah oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kinda it is i do</p>
<p>agree with you though it is a pit stop eventually all</p>
<p>media will be just coming through the air it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>short pit stop</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what apples i</p>
<p>guess looking at it as it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to add 100</p>
<p>to your laptop is it</p>
<p>worth it for something that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to take out in like two years probably</p>
<p>three years probably 3d games</p>
<p>on your fucking laptop</p>
<p>you just technology now is i mean just like look at</p>
<p>this fucking room for the you know what i mean like how</p>
<p>phones and you can&rsquo;t get blu ray players</p>
<p>ten years ago</p>
<p>imagine an iphone if i</p>
<p>would have told you</p>
<p>about an iphone ten years ago you</p>
<p>might get the fuck out</p>
<p>of here you</p>
<p>know exactly you&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>crazy yeah right you can do all that on when you</p>
<p>first cell phone</p>
<p>um i got my</p>
<p>first cell phone</p>
<p>and i wanna say ninety fourish</p>
<p>ninety three ish</p>
<p>early nineties</p>
<p>i had a car</p>
<p>phone way back in nineteen eighty</p>
<p>eight you had that big ass one with it was actually</p>
<p>box connected to the car yeah</p>
<p>go anywhere with it but it&rsquo;s the same thing sure</p>
<p>and then i had</p>
<p>a real phone i didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>until i moved to new york</p>
<p>or to la rather so i was like probably the same like 94</p>
<p>right yeah big ass</p>
<p>brick it was a</p>
<p>motorola flip</p>
<p>things what were</p>
<p>those things called</p>
<p>the really bitching</p>
<p>motorola ones startex</p>
<p>remember that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about the one you&rsquo;re not the one that had like the</p>
<p>briefcase when you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about like a real fucking</p>
<p>that one oh yeah it was a</p>
<p>motorola yeah</p>
<p>yeah sure we</p>
<p>call it start</p>
<p>text yeah it had the bottom that</p>
<p>flipped out but it&rsquo;s only just for your</p>
<p>voice it didn&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>else on there yeah yeah</p>
<p>those motorola motors</p>
<p>they mean you</p>
<p>had their cord</p>
<p>you could pull out</p>
<p>and it would push in i remember</p>
<p>that antennas a lot of dude</p>
<p>antennas you have to put them on your car for shit</p>
<p>yeah what is</p>
<p>going on with this</p>
<p>apple antenna</p>
<p>brian have they figured that thing out</p>
<p>where you if you hold the</p>
<p>phone a certain way you don&rsquo;t get any signal</p>
<p>is that all bullshit</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it bothers anyone</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve heard that it was</p>
<p>bullshit and i</p>
<p>heard that it wasn&rsquo;t also heard</p>
<p>that it was</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on one side that if you&rsquo;re left handed</p>
<p>it covers it yeah oh so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death to lefties yeah so and i&rsquo;m left handed with</p>
<p>these no cases</p>
<p>you know imagine</p>
<p>if you were left handed you grew up back when people</p>
<p>would burn people for being left handed</p>
<p>yeah i am actually left handed and there</p>
<p>were times where people</p>
<p>they would correct people</p>
<p>yeah they didn&rsquo;t correct them they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust them they wanted to kill them yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re witches</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re left handed</p>
<p>dude that just goes to show you people</p>
<p>are dumb as fucking always have been and they&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>any group to be a part of people</p>
<p>feared people being different people</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s always the case</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always the</p>
<p>case that&rsquo;s what racism</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s sexy</p>
<p>you know sexism</p>
<p>and all this</p>
<p>homophobia it&rsquo;s just like man that guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not like me let&rsquo;s kill him anybody with me who&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little of that but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>fearing what they&rsquo;re afraid of seeing in themselves</p>
<p>absolutely one hundred</p>
<p>yeah totally totally totally i</p>
<p>think ninety percent of people that are gay bashing</p>
<p>probably just</p>
<p>fighting off some internal</p>
<p>need to suck some cock</p>
<p>or the fear</p>
<p>of even if it&rsquo;s before is more upstream than that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re afraid</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s contagious and it</p>
<p>might get on them</p>
<p>you know what i mean it&rsquo;s like man if he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gay what&rsquo;s next me get me the fuck it&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>discussion you have with people when you talk</p>
<p>about gay being a choice or not being a choice</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>thought on it because i actually actually i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i think you both</p>
<p>i think it is</p>
<p>absolutely both</p>
<p>yeah you know i</p>
<p>think i think</p>
<p>people that are born with it and people that</p>
<p>choose to do it</p>
<p>you know there was a</p>
<p>roman study that</p>
<p>started roman</p>
<p>not roman back in</p>
<p>roman times but rome in rome</p>
<p>did a study</p>
<p>where they could</p>
<p>included that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that homosexuality comes from</p>
<p>a variation of the x chromosome</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s inherited from over</p>
<p>sexual women</p>
<p>and that over sexual</p>
<p>women that it may actually be some sort of a variation</p>
<p>that was designed to make sure that they get pregnant</p>
<p>and ensure their survival back in</p>
<p>tough times so</p>
<p>they had to be</p>
<p>really slutty</p>
<p>and not just really slutty but slutty with a</p>
<p>bunch of different men</p>
<p>and what they</p>
<p>found out is that</p>
<p>women who are</p>
<p>promiscuous</p>
<p>are much more likely</p>
<p>in this study</p>
<p>at least to produce homosexual children</p>
<p>and that when they looked at homosexual children</p>
<p>a statistical</p>
<p>majority like you</p>
<p>could look at it on</p>
<p>paper and go wow this is</p>
<p>these women have</p>
<p>in their horse</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking fascinating</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting it makes</p>
<p>sense i mean absolutely</p>
<p>makes a lot</p>
<p>of sense why women</p>
<p>wanna fuck men</p>
<p>on a lot of why some girls are just</p>
<p>freaks there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some girls that just will fuck everybody yeah</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like that from the jump</p>
<p>yeah there was a girl that i</p>
<p>dated when i was in high</p>
<p>school and this</p>
<p>bitch will fuck anyone</p>
<p>anyone she fucked everyone</p>
<p>she was crazy yeah yeah i</p>
<p>think you didn&rsquo;t have bits</p>
<p>about it yeah i know you did that sex</p>
<p>show that i</p>
<p>did with ari</p>
<p>that yeah yeah yeah totally true</p>
<p>story that yeah i came home this</p>
<p>chick was so</p>
<p>crazy i came home one day there was this</p>
<p>other dude that my</p>
<p>sister used to hang out with</p>
<p>and that was i was like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not wasn&rsquo;t sure if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still dating anymore as one of</p>
<p>those things we</p>
<p>get in arguments</p>
<p>we never were really</p>
<p>going steady</p>
<p>now this is we do</p>
<p>you lost your virginity to no</p>
<p>okay okay this is</p>
<p>later different one okay</p>
<p>and so this girl was so</p>
<p>crazy that she was</p>
<p>getting fingered in the</p>
<p>front seat of a car in</p>
<p>front of my house</p>

<p>why don&rsquo;t you play that shit play that yeah</p>
<p>yeah this is</p>
<p>this is richard dawkins</p>
<p>sitting in front of a fire</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s reading hate mail</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the name on the twitter or the youtube video</p>
<p>uh richard dawkins reads</p>
<p>hate mail okay hate</p>
<p>emails and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sitting in front</p>
<p>of a fire with his feet propped up on his laptop with a</p>
<p>big smile on his face and he&rsquo;s reading this shit</p>
<p>and all these fucking</p>
<p>knuckleheads</p>
<p>richard dawkins is a very</p>
<p>famous atheist</p>
<p>and intellectual you</p>
<p>will not believe in the</p>
<p>existence of god but you believe in aliens</p>
<p>but the very</p>
<p>existence of</p>
<p>your animosity hatred and mockery towards him</p>
<p>proves your hypocrasy</p>
<p>i suggest that</p>
<p>you find the longest crowbar you can find</p>
<p>pull your head out of your behind</p>
<p>if there is no order in evolution</p>
<p>how are you born with your head on your shoulders</p>
<p>they get it</p>
<p>no i meant to get it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so smart in your own eyes you can&rsquo;t comprehend</p>
<p>simple bible passages</p>
<p>and misconstrue them for your own bullshit dog like</p>
<p>i read your book about the bible it is totally succedes</p>
<p>propaganda your theory sucks</p>
<p>you are not as wise as you</p>
<p>think you are</p>
<p>you hypocrites</p>
<p>want to condemn anybody for making mistakes</p>
<p>or believing different from your bullshit retard</p>
<p>atheism dogma</p>
<p>bookings books are fucking stupid bullshit</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s a shot the fire</p>
<p>then what is the point of your life pointless</p>
<p>when you die that&rsquo;s it game over how pointless is that</p>
<p>i really feel sorry for you all</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not too late to turn to god</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people listening going yeah from</p>
<p>god to you frank</p>
<p>this is what god says about you you are a fool</p>
<p>you are a fool that&rsquo;s four words and i</p>
<p>also like how they speak for god</p>
<p>from somebody called am kota</p>
<p>no i defy any of my co religionists to tell me</p>
<p>they do not</p>
<p>laugh at the idea of dawkins burning in hell</p>
<p>i always love that you suck</p>
<p>go burn in hell</p>
<p>satan will enjoy torturing you</p>
<p>what happened mum didn&rsquo;t pay enough attention to you</p>
<p>so you decided to rebel</p>
<p>i hope for your own sake you see your</p>
<p>grave mistake and repent</p>
<p>god dwells among us</p>
<p>every day you are the spawn of evil</p>
<p>christian living for god</p>
<p>so funny i hope</p>
<p>you die slowly and you fucking burn in hell</p>
<p>you damn blasphemy</p>
<p>right now you are rotting on the inside</p>
<p>but you must know</p>
<p>that there is indeed a god</p>
<p>a great god</p>
<p>and he will</p>
<p>forgive you if you regret from your fucking behavior</p>
<p>you should realize</p>
<p>that your entire life has been a delusion</p>
<p>and that right now</p>
<p>your destiny is all fucked up</p>
<p>our god is a loving god</p>
<p>but if you keep peddling this kind of filth</p>
<p>then i pity you when jesus returns</p>
<p>i hate your fucking guts</p>
<p>sincerely haha you fucking dumbass</p>

<p>me it&rsquo;s guys like that that get</p>
<p>get their lives threatened i mean those</p>
<p>well you know you</p>
<p>could be a marked man if he was</p>
<p>talking about</p>
<p>islam he&rsquo;d probably already be dead yeah those were</p>
<p>i mean religious</p>
<p>fanatics are the scariest fucking people in the</p>
<p>world to me</p>
<p>poor fuck by the way if you&rsquo;re listening to this</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a religious fanatic my name&rsquo;s ari shafir</p>
<p>yeah and my</p>
<p>phone number is</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you do it</p>
<p>remember when we used to give out his</p>
<p>phone number on stage</p>
<p>yeah duncan</p>
<p>actually had it</p>
<p>on websites and</p>
<p>everything like that</p>
<p>yeah we would say after show and if you enjoyed</p>
<p>our his his phone number is right blah blah blah blah</p>
<p>he would write that down</p>
<p>his phone be ringing all night</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t that happen</p>
<p>yeah oh yeah totally who did that on stage with a</p>
<p>duncan i thought was it duncan yeah</p>
<p>sounds like duncan</p>
<p>right up duncan right in his wheelhouse</p>
<p>duncan is so fucking crazy</p>
<p>does he used to play</p>
<p>like elaborate they used to</p>
<p>break into each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house like duncan piston and piston and glass broken</p>
<p>when they were neighbors duncan broke into ari&rsquo;s place</p>
<p>and pissed in a glass and put it in his refrigerator</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i opens</p>
<p>his refrigerator and he&rsquo;s like what the you know what</p>
<p>i mean they</p>
<p>just steal each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s mail</p>
<p>they used to do all kinds of terrible shit to each</p>
<p>other that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>um before we</p>
<p>leave there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing that i want to talk</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s pretty fucking</p>
<p>crazy and i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;d get into this</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re in a weird shit</p>
<p>this is physics</p>
<p>brian god damn it</p>
<p>physicists from the</p>
<p>university of bonn</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where that is</p>
<p>have developed germany is it</p>
<p>yes it is germany</p>
<p>thank you very much</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve developed a</p>
<p>completely new source of light</p>
<p>a so called</p>
<p>bose einstein condensate consisting of photons</p>
<p>until recently now whatever the fuck this means</p>
<p>experts had thought that this was impossible</p>
<p>and this method</p>
<p>may potentially be suitable for designing novel</p>
<p>light sources resembling</p>
<p>lasers that will work in the x ray</p>
<p>range among</p>
<p>other applications they</p>
<p>might allow</p>
<p>building more</p>
<p>powerful computer</p>
<p>chips and these scientists are reporting</p>
<p>their discovery</p>
<p>and the upcoming</p>
<p>issue of the</p>
<p>journal nature</p>
<p>so these motherfuckers have figured out a new form of</p>
<p>light a new source of light</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna run out of discovers</p>
<p>oh no i don&rsquo;t never</p>
<p>until they find</p>
<p>the one that just kills</p>
<p>all of mankind that&rsquo;s the only way that ends there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lighter is there what you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s it is there it means like how many</p>
<p>layers does this fucking onion have</p>
<p>is there a core</p>
<p>do they keep</p>
<p>inventing shit i think the</p>
<p>core is time</p>
<p>travel or the core is</p>
<p>once it all becomes interlinked and once you know</p>
<p>i think the core of it is just like an</p>
<p>understanding of the universe</p>
<p>like and how it relates to itself that time</p>
<p>travel theme comes up here on the show a lot</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had a lot of us that are</p>
<p>you know the idea of it look</p>
<p>the idea of sending a</p>
<p>picture through the air to you or i</p>
<p>if we had to come up with it on our own</p>
<p>how to do that it</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way but no</p>
<p>way could happen i</p>
<p>could do it</p>
<p>right now but</p>
<p>you have no idea how it fucking happened but</p>
<p>someone did figure it all out some</p>
<p>group of people that got to the</p>
<p>point where it happened</p>
<p>now if we as a unit of</p>
<p>three if we were designed</p>
<p>or we were told to go out and make</p>
<p>a new way to send</p>
<p>video through the air so that it hits another</p>
<p>box something of</p>
<p>it involves</p>
<p>soup cans and strings</p>
<p>impossible we</p>
<p>could live a hundred lives do we</p>
<p>never even come</p>
<p>close no but yet somehow or another</p>
<p>people were able to put it all together and do that</p>
<p>that to me says</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no end it&rsquo;s just everybody puts a piece in</p>
<p>this guy makes the</p>
<p>wheel and that guy makes the axle this</p>
<p>guy makes the</p>
<p>steering wheel</p>
<p>and maybe he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>other than the</p>
<p>steering wheels but he knows how to make that</p>
<p>steering wheel and he puts it all together</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one big</p>
<p>giant fucking ant hill designed to</p>
<p>create yes the</p>
<p>building blocks of</p>
<p>evolution i mean it really is the contestants of what</p>
<p>evolution really is is</p>
<p>those miniscule</p>
<p>steps where something opens up another box and</p>
<p>another layer of the onion like that and that</p>
<p>they have to all act as</p>
<p>individuals but together</p>
<p>as a unit that&rsquo;s the key to getting anything done</p>
<p>anybody that does something like say a guy like</p>
<p>you know stephen</p>
<p>hawking&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>particle physicist</p>
<p>like michio kaku or something like that they</p>
<p>they dedicate</p>
<p>their entire life to concentrating on</p>
<p>know particle theory</p>
<p>and concentrating on the cosmos and country</p>
<p>outside like there</p>
<p>that is their spot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>thing they do and what they</p>
<p>from the things they discover we get more of an</p>
<p>understanding</p>
<p>about stuff</p>
<p>and then some guy will come up with some new fucking</p>
<p>thing that ties into that sure man</p>
<p>and i mean they pass it on that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>those guys are professors</p>
<p>they pass the baton</p>
<p>to the next</p>
<p>class of people don&rsquo;t like to</p>
<p>build upon what he did we&rsquo;re all acting together sure</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all we just can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>it we just can&rsquo;t see it but we&rsquo;re all acting together</p>
<p>and time machines</p>
<p>yeah i think i mean i</p>
<p>think time i</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna get too far i mean i know we&rsquo;re almost</p>
<p>wrapping up so you just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little late in the show to</p>
<p>start a time</p>
<p>traveling fucking conversation</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had him</p>
<p>a hundred times yeah i heard</p>
<p>lockhart&rsquo;s a big he&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>dad yeah well you know that&rsquo;s one of the cool</p>
<p>things about</p>
<p>knowing a lot of</p>
<p>comics and knowing</p>
<p>a lot of dudes that hang out at the comedy</p>
<p>store a lot of</p>
<p>comics have a lot of goddamn time</p>
<p>and they sit around and</p>
<p>think about and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re generally</p>
<p>smart people like the better the</p>
<p>comics like</p>
<p>you know are smart</p>
<p>thinkers they&rsquo;re you know</p>
<p>deep thinkers</p>
<p>open to fucking new ideas a concert consider</p>
<p>things anything but closed</p>
<p>minded are good comedians yeah</p>
<p>and you know what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the most important</p>
<p>things if you want to have a fun life</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>gotta surround yourself with</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>that are asking questions too and honest ones</p>
<p>so that when the when you know like</p>
<p>like here&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>perfect example</p>
<p>me and my buddy</p>
