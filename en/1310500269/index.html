    <p>I get so passionate about it.</p>
<p>I get so angry, you know?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a saying like,</p>
<p>oh, can you beat him in a hook?</p>
<p>Can you beat, man?</p>
<p>Win, win, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Just win and don&rsquo;t talk to me about anything else.</p>
<p>You believe the match is finished.</p>
<p>And I wonder if that gets in the head of the other person.</p>
<p>See this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Quit.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Devon Larratt,</p>
<p>considered by many to be one of the greatest</p>
<p>arm wrestlers in history.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>

<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Devon Larratt.</p>
<p>You are considered to be one of the greatest</p>
<p>arm wrestlers in history,</p>
<p>plus are one of the most charismatic</p>
<p>and fun people to watch in arm wrestling.</p>
<p>But let me first start with a ridiculous,</p>
<p>the controversial opinion.</p>
<p>I actually really enjoy Over the Top,</p>
<p>the movie with Sylvester Stallone,</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s a trucker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a father son movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, like a bunch of sports</p>
<p>have the definitive movie.</p>
<p>Boxing has Rocky, maybe folk style.</p>
<p>Collegiate wrestling has Vision Quest.</p>
<p>What else is there?</p>
<p>Billiards has Color of Money.</p>
<p>This is the sort of movie for arm wrestling.</p>
<p>So what did Over the Top get right?</p>
<p>What did it get wrong about arm wrestling?</p>
<p>That was actually based off of a real story.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Over the Top movie,</p>
<p>I mean, to a certain degree,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually real life.</p>
<p>Like that tournament, Over the Top, was real.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was literally named Over the Top.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>There was a trucker division,</p>
<p>and the guy actually won a truck for real.</p>
<p>His name&rsquo;s John Brzenk.</p>
<p>You know who that is, right?</p>
<p>So the actual Over the Top tournament,</p>
<p>the trucker division, was won by John.</p>
<p>Who is John Brzenk?</p>
<p>He is, a lot of people talk about him as like a legend</p>
<p>and one of, if not the greatest,</p>
<p>arm wrestlers of all time.</p>
<p>John Brzenk is every arm wrestler&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>to a certain degree, all of us.</p>
<p>The entire sport looks up to him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible what he&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>I mean, at 18, he won Over the Top.</p>
<p>At 57, he just competed with me a couple months ago.</p>
<p>Still at the world level.</p>
<p>18, that&rsquo;s 40 years of being at the top of the sport.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s hailed as the greatest of all time</p>
<p>in the sport of arm wrestling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;s beaten some monsters.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, when you talk about like the evolution of the sport,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s responsible for so much of it.</p>
<p>Like when you talk about, like a lot of times</p>
<p>when you go back like 20 years, 30 years,</p>
<p>a lot of us looked at arm wrestling, I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, as something you could kind of do.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the first guy who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if you want to get better at arm wrestling,</p>
<p>you got to arm wrestle.</p>
<p>And it seems so simple, but you know,</p>
<p>he answered so many questions that all of us had</p>
<p>about techniques in the sport, back in a pre video internet.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been everybody&rsquo;s target for like 40 years.</p>
<p>So in terms of strength, there&rsquo;s a power in terms of skill.</p>
<p>What did he teach the sport of arm wrestling?</p>
<p>So if you look, how did the sport change</p>
<p>from 80s, 90s to the aughts?</p>
<p>You were at the top of the world for many years.</p>
<p>Many argue you&rsquo;re still at the very top of the world.</p>
<p>But like you were very dominant, both left and right hand</p>
<p>in, I don&rsquo;t know, 2008 to 2013, something like that.</p>
<p>So how did that sport evolve to today?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard for me to comment, you know, prior to,</p>
<p>you know, when I came to the sport was kind of mid nineties.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been arm wrestling my whole life,</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t really involved in the sport to a major degree</p>
<p>until probably, you know, mid nineties.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll say that before the mid nineties,</p>
<p>it was really hard to get good at arm wrestling.</p>
<p>Very difficult.</p>
<p>Everybody was doing it wrong, really.</p>
<p>Like it was really rare to find people</p>
<p>who were technically good arm wrestlers.</p>
<p>It was very underground.</p>
<p>You know, when I got into sport,</p>
<p>it was a flyer that came in the mail.</p>
<p>You had to know somebody who knew you.</p>
<p>You had to know somebody who knew somebody</p>
<p>who knew somebody, and then you go to a club</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t do anything with these people.</p>
<p>And they knew how to arm wrestle.</p>
<p>They did, but real masters were rare.</p>
<p>And you know, then internet helped everybody.</p>
<p>Communication, the transfer of knowledge</p>
<p>became so much faster.</p>
<p>People became technically, you know, invested.</p>
<p>People started to train, sharing ideas.</p>
<p>By, I&rsquo;d say, 2000 and,</p>
<p>well, probably around the turn of the millennia,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that professional leagues started to slowly pick up.</p>
<p>More organized, bigger productions.</p>
<p>Started to attract more athletes.</p>
<p>More people took it seriously.</p>
<p>By 2010, I&rsquo;d say there was another jump.</p>
<p>More serious leagues, a little bit more money.</p>
<p>By 2015, more major media.</p>
<p>Like, people were investing a lot of money.</p>
<p>Like, you know, millionaires, billionaires type of people</p>
<p>were organizing events, setting up leagues.</p>
<p>And yeah, I mean, the past five years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just blown up.</p>
<p>The techniques, I mean, if I was to go back</p>
<p>to when I started, you know, what took me</p>
<p>10 or 15 years to learn?</p>
<p>I mean, new guys are showing up</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got it down in like a year.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the thing about it, the development of the sport,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s, like I was telling you off mic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a battle of one versus one.</p>
<p>And then that can turn into battle of nations,</p>
<p>which, you know, there is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Canada, there&rsquo;s the United States,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all the Eastern Europe, Russia, Georgia,</p>
<p>all of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes some of the greatest sports</p>
<p>in Olympics great, like weightlifting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a battle of nations, not just a battle of individuals.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like these two humans</p>
<p>represent the two nations.</p>
<p>And I see that very much,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about your matches coming up,</p>
<p>but there is that battle between North America</p>
<p>and that other part of the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, North America is very prized.</p>
<p>You know, the North American champion</p>
<p>is always highly sought after</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re typically the most famous.</p>
<p>Even still when, you know, quite arguably,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always somebody in Eastern Europe</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s just monstrous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s typically the North American athlete</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s more recognized.</p>
<p>By the way. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have a cup here with some maple syrup.</p>
<p>Cheers, Lex. Cheers.</p>
<p>We should probably show,</p>
<p>you just downed that whole thing.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I&rsquo;m gonna sip it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna sip it, you know?</p>
<p>But by all means.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really good, right? That is delicious.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>That is. Canadian maple syrup.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a perfect July day from Canada in a bottle, yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re on a total tangent.</p>
<p>You are known for appreciating food</p>
<p>in all kinds of ways,</p>
<p>but one of the things you&rsquo;re known for is pancakes.</p>
<p>That is, yeah, that&rsquo;s gone to a crazy place in the sport,</p>
<p>but yeah, like.</p>
<p>Where did that originate?</p>
<p>So, where that originated.</p>
<p>When it went from like your actual love for pancakes</p>
<p>to the meme.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think what happened was.</p>
<p>So I had a match with Michael Todd, big match.</p>
<p>Michael, great champion.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s another guy who&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s never gonna get off the horse.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s, Jesus.</p>
<p>His elbow is a complete disaster.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most loved and hated guys</p>
<p>in the sport right now.</p>
<p>Is it because of the King&rsquo;s move?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, the King&rsquo;s move brings him a lot of hate.</p>
<p>Not from me, not from a lot of people,</p>
<p>but a lot of observers have a big problem</p>
<p>with the King&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with being a little bit controversial?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>You know, I get so passionate about it.</p>
<p>I get so angry, you know?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s this saying like,</p>
<p>oh, can you beat him in a hook?</p>
<p>Can you beat, man?</p>
<p>Win, win.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all that matters.</p>
<p>Just win and don&rsquo;t talk to me about anything else.</p>
<p>If you can win with style, win with style,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t talk to me about anything but winning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the priority.</p>
<p>So you had this match with Michael Todd.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I was in a terrible place.</p>
<p>I guess it was, I get so screwed up with the years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2022 now, right?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s 2030.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think it is actually 2030.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re way ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So when was this?</p>
<p>This was like a decade ago or no?</p>
<p>No, this is like a year and a bit ago.</p>
<p>Oh, this is very recent.</p>
<p>Very recent, yeah.</p>
<p>So I got really sick.</p>
<p>Is that the match?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the match, right?</p>
<p>Awesome match.</p>
<p>So this match is for the Legacy Hammer.</p>
<p>So we invented this thing called the Legacy Hammer</p>
<p>and Michael took it from me in, I think, 2018.</p>
<p>And then COVID shut everything down</p>
<p>and Michael went overseas to try and set up,</p>
<p>because at that time, Michael was a North American champion.</p>
<p>He beat me and he went to Dubai</p>
<p>and he organized this great big match with LeVon.</p>
<p>And the whole thing fell apart.</p>
<p>Organizers, leagues, wouldn&rsquo;t let it happen,</p>
<p>but there was still an ability</p>
<p>to have a match of significance happen.</p>
<p>So Michael&rsquo;s like, who do you want?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, let&rsquo;s give Devin a rematch.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, yes.</p>
<p>And I was really sick at the time.</p>
<p>I had DVT, I had pulmonary embolism.</p>
<p>I was mentally in a terrible place</p>
<p>and I got offered the match</p>
<p>and I just totally turned my life around.</p>
<p>And I committed really hard.</p>
<p>What happened in this match, by the way?</p>
<p>Oh, I just totally destroyed him.</p>
<p>I just beat the piss out of him.</p>
<p>Michael&rsquo;s a good friend of mine, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of camaraderie</p>
<p>when you guys talked afterwards, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But we fight like brothers,</p>
<p>so we let each other really fight hard against each other.</p>
<p>But so I was, I knew, I mean,</p>
<p>strength and mass, they go hand in hand.</p>
<p>And I committed to just getting as big</p>
<p>and as strong as I could.</p>
<p>And literally, I was eating pancakes every day.</p>
<p>Bacon, pancakes, every sloppy bit</p>
<p>of garbage food I could eat.</p>
<p>I was trying to eat healthy also,</p>
<p>but if there was garbage food, I&rsquo;d eat it.</p>
<p>What do you mean, bacon and pancakes isn&rsquo;t healthy?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But people should go watch, there&rsquo;s a video</p>
<p>where you make the Canadian meal of bacon</p>
<p>with some bacon cooking tips, water, that was interesting.</p>
<p>And then obviously pancakes and maple syrup</p>
<p>all over the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re making me very hungry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve caused more diabetes than,</p>
<p>probably gonna get in trouble karmically</p>
<p>for making the world obese.</p>
<p>You should probably write a book, The Pancake Diet.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I will do that one day.</p>
<p>So you said mass and strength go hand in hand,</p>
<p>just at a big level about arm wrestling,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s more important?</p>
<p>Strength, power, endurance, skills, strategy,</p>
<p>or mental toughness, how do these components</p>
<p>all come into play in arm wrestling?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all important.</p>
<p>You can use everything and you can adjust your strategy</p>
<p>based off of the tools that you have.</p>
<p>I would say if I could pick ever just one thing</p>
<p>to have more of, I would say that it would be strength.</p>
<p>Gained while fighting.</p>
<p>While actually arm wrestling, so not off the table.</p>
<p>No, no, no, so you get stronger from arm wrestling.</p>
<p>How do you get stronger from arm wrestling?</p>
<p>In jiu jitsu and grappling, you can get good</p>
<p>by training with people much technically worse than you.</p>
<p>So with white belts and blue belts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually beneficial because you get to work stuff out.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t say it develops that intensity</p>
<p>and power required to go against people at your level.</p>
<p>So how do you balance that?</p>
<p>Is it okay to go against people</p>
<p>that are much weaker than you?</p>
<p>Or do you really have to go against people</p>
<p>at the same level?</p>
<p>I think that a blended strategy is probably the best.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say kind of a rule is whatever you do,</p>
<p>you get better at, right?</p>
<p>So you wanna be kind of as precise as possible.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna get hurt.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just about investment.</p>
<p>And the answer&rsquo;s not always the same.</p>
<p>Things are gonna change.</p>
<p>I am currently a big believer in what I call</p>
<p>tower building, right?</p>
<p>So you have to do a lot of volume to build a great tower.</p>
<p>You need to have a ton, a ton of volume.</p>
<p>So when you look at how to best build volume,</p>
<p>you want to do workouts that aren&rsquo;t particularly challenging</p>
<p>to make you feel good and do them so that</p>
<p>when you add them all together, you get the biggest number.</p>
<p>So many easy workouts a day that are specific as possible,</p>
<p>in my opinion, is the best way to lay the foundation</p>
<p>for an extreme peak.</p>
<p>And precision, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no more precise way to get strong</p>
<p>at arm wrestling than arm wrestle.</p>
<p>So how often can you arm wrestle?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your training regimen?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about this as the climb.</p>
<p>What is the training process to get great at arm wrestling?</p>
<p>Well, again, it&rsquo;s gonna depend on what level you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>The answer at the beginning might not be the same.</p>
<p>For me, a guy who&rsquo;s been doing it almost 30 years,</p>
<p>I have to harvest.</p>
<p>I have to harvest energy from clubs.</p>
<p>I call it cosmic punch.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>You were here in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>You are in Austin, Texas, but you were at the,</p>
<p>what was it called?</p>
<p>The water tank.</p>
<p>And you had an awesome crowd.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>I get to watch.</p>
<p>I got to interact with a lot of those guys.</p>
<p>Yes, just amazing community, amazing human beings.</p>
<p>I got to talk to Dmitry in Russian and in English.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an engineer.</p>
<p>His wife is an engineer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a brilliant dude, but also one of the toughest,</p>
<p>I guess, guys you faced there.</p>
<p>But you faced, I don&rsquo;t know how many people.</p>
<p>It must&rsquo;ve been hundreds of matches.</p>
<p>So the bar was full.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that for me is a perfect training scenario.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if I go in and just kind of be,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a lightning rod,</p>
<p>and I just absorb everything that I can get from people,</p>
<p>all their effort, that&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky because I&rsquo;m in a place that I can handle it.</p>
<p>If I was losing or failing, this would not be optimal.</p>
<p>But because I&rsquo;m strong enough,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing it long enough that I can kind of absorb it</p>
<p>without damaging me, this is perfect.</p>
<p>This is perfect.</p>
<p>I typically, when I&rsquo;m training up for a very serious match,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try and do that three or four times a week.</p>
<p>And then the days in between,</p>
<p>I will just do blood flow rehab, blood flow rehab.</p>
<p>I will never hit a PR, a record.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never do it anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I used to.</p>
<p>A lot of things change, and that&rsquo;s why I say</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to do it.</p>
<p>This is currently a system that&rsquo;s working very well for me.</p>
<p>So when you say PR, you&rsquo;re not aggressively chasing a peak.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just building and building and building.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My only peak that I care about is for this cycle,</p>
<p>the 25th of June.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my only PR.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the 25th of June.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about Levan Siginashvili, the Georgian Hulk.</p>
<p>Question number one, is it possible to beat him?</p>
<p>He is widely acknowledged as the most powerful person</p>
<p>in arm wrestling today.</p>
<p>Is he beatable?</p>
<p>And if so, how?</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s beatable.</p>
<p>Levan is incredible.</p>
<p>He is what this modern peak of arm wrestling represents.</p>
<p>So for people who are just listening,</p>
<p>we also have an overlay of a video</p>
<p>of Levan going against Vitaliy Levin,</p>
<p>another top three person in the world, perhaps,</p>
<p>in arm wrestling.</p>
<p>And Levan&rsquo;s the guy on the right, just big.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And the aggression, I mean, actually,</p>
<p>sort of underneath it all, he seems to be a teddy bear,</p>
<p>but when he turns it on, it&rsquo;s raw power.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the full package.</p>
<p>Levan is, he represents the pinnacle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Dennis in the background.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I wanna be back in there.</p>
<p>Levan has a lot of bases covered.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, I mean, he&rsquo;s curling 300 pounds with one arm.</p>
<p>I mean, the strength that he shows for arm wrestling</p>
<p>is so far ahead of the field.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very, very strong.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s absolutely possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely possible.</p>
<p>The one thing that I&rsquo;m confident about,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s two things.</p>
<p>The two things I&rsquo;m confident about</p>
<p>is that I have more experience than he does.</p>
<p>And experience counts for a lot.</p>
<p>The other thing is my ability to breathe and recover.</p>
<p>So if ever there&rsquo;s an opportunity for the tide to turn,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, I think, where you&rsquo;ll never get it back.</p>
<p>So I think if I can somehow find a hole in his game,</p>
<p>then, yeah.</p>
<p>So you want to hold off the initial assault of power</p>
<p>and then worm out and to find the hole.</p>
<p>And then, how much of that is mental?</p>
<p>How much of it is just the physical ability to do</p>
<p>for your muscles to have the endurance to hold off?</p>
<p>I like to make the sport bigger.</p>
<p>And a lot of things that most arm wrestlers</p>
<p>believe the sport is,</p>
<p>I always try and push those boundaries.</p>
<p>So there is definitely a mental aspect to it</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re faced with something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when things like experience comes in.</p>
<p>He can become surprised.</p>
<p>Where what&rsquo;s a surprise for him is routine for me.</p>
<p>So my adjustments will be more precise, more accurate.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s how I get in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I get in.</p>
<p>Yeah, I play a dirty game.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>So some of it, how important is confidence</p>
<p>in the progression of the match?</p>
<p>Is there ups and downs of confidence?</p>
<p>Like, holy shit, I actually have a chance to win this.</p>
<p>Holy shit, I&rsquo;m winning this, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some of my favorite moments.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if those are fake or not</p>
<p>in terms of your expressions,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s fake until you make it.</p>
<p>But whenever you shake your head or whatever,</p>
<p>you make it apparent that you believe the match is finished.</p>
<p>And I wonder if that gets in the head of the other person.</p>
<p>When you start to actually,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re doing things,</p>
<p>like precise, detailed things with your hands</p>
<p>to also indicate that you believe they&rsquo;re fake.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re finished.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re facially just.</p>
<p>See this? Yeah.</p>
<p>Quit.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s right, because it&rsquo;s facing the other.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s ultimately what the battle is about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>You might as well give up.</p>
<p>Commitment is so important in anything that you do, right?</p>
<p>Like, I always kind of try and bring things</p>
<p>to a level of commitment that&rsquo;s uncommon.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a lot of reasons why I do well,</p>
<p>is because I just get so committed in the whole process.</p>
<p>And by the time that I actually show up to fight,</p>
<p>I sometimes just wish that they would kill me.</p>
<p>I wish that they would,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how far I want to go.</p>
<p>People talk about like, how committed are you to the match?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re committed to the match and you lose,</p>
<p>you should be hurt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often unhappy when I lose a match</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have an injury.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, damn, what the fuck?</p>
<p>I shoulda.</p>
<p>I feel like I didn&rsquo;t commit, you know?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know Dan Gable as the wrestler.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, he was on.</p>
<p>He was on the podcast? Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>He talked about his whole career.</p>
<p>He dreamed of working so hard that he can&rsquo;t get off the mat.</p>
<p>By himself.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s disappointed ultimately at the end of his career</p>
<p>because he was always able to get off the mat</p>
<p>on his own accord.</p>
<p>So he wants to, yeah, leave it all on the mat</p>
<p>just from exhaustion.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what commitment looks like.</p>
<p>What is this process, what is this climb</p>
<p>for probably the toughest match of your career?</p>
<p>I would say the most epic match in arm wrestling history.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really building up.</p>
<p>You are, as you said, North America.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I mean, I think by accounts of many</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the greatest arm wrestlers ever.</p>
<p>He is one of the scariest arm wrestlers ever.</p>
<p>And so this match, by the way, where&rsquo;s it happening?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be in Dubai. In Dubai.</p>
<p>June, so what does the climb look like?</p>
<p>The climb for me, what I have to change in my life always,</p>
<p>people talk about being a professional.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved the sport.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve loved it like crazy, but to me,</p>
<p>the path is about simplicity and removal of distractions.</p>
<p>I do better and better the more I get rid of everything,</p>
<p>nothing else, so that my life is just the goal,</p>
<p>just the target and everything else is off the table.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I need to get to, where there&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing between me and him.</p>
<p>And every single day you&rsquo;re putting in the volume.</p>
<p>Every day, all day.</p>
<p>Now you said you worked out.</p>
<p>So yesterday you did hundreds of arm wrestling matches.</p>
<p>And then today you said in the morning you still worked out.</p>
<p>So what was that workout?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re mixing up stuff where you&rsquo;re doing weights also?</p>
<p>This morning, I try to really focus</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s administratively easy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big part of me, everything I do.</p>
<p>So I just travel with bands.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got bands with me and it&rsquo;s rehabilitative in nature.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really focusing on blood flow,</p>
<p>feeling good, doing proper movements,</p>
<p>but yeah, it&rsquo;s just a band workout in the hotel room.</p>
<p>What does a band workout look like?</p>
<p>So are you doing the arm wrestling movement?</p>
<p>Oh, you see that?</p>
<p>See what you did there?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>You want to bring him in.</p>
<p>Yeah, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up into your center.</p>
<p>You think what can you control out here?</p>
<p>No, you bring everything close.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about pinning.</p>
<p>Pinning happens once it&rsquo;s close to you.</p>
<p>Pinning is, people always think about pinning.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think about pinning.</p>
<p>How much of the body is a part of this, too?</p>
<p>Like the core, the torso,</p>
<p>because it feels like there&rsquo;s that almost like</p>
<p>Mike Tyson punch power, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Does it come from the hips, too, and the legs?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely the whole body.</p>
<p>Like everything is working.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re connected to the table at times,</p>
<p>as far as your base.</p>
<p>Sometimes your base is your feet,</p>
<p>but a lot of times you can base off the table.</p>
<p>So you can base off your hips, but I&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>no arm wrestler cares about doing squats.</p>
<p>No arm wrestler is doing planks.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about the forearm and the actions of the hand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the limiting factor.</p>
<p>You look at a guy like Oleg Zakh.</p>
<p>Okay, do you know this guy?</p>
<p>Oleg Zakh.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Marvelous.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a total hell boy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s my inspiration to what I call pumpkin training.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s pumpkin training?</p>
<p>Probably we&rsquo;ll get into that,</p>
<p>but I only train my right arm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Yeah, with homework.</p>
<p>But back to full body, it is full body.</p>
<p>My good friend Matt Mask, when he arm wrestled me,</p>
<p>he actually blew his internal abductor in his leg.</p>
<p>So yeah, people walk away from tournament.</p>
<p>Their calves can be sore sometimes.</p>
<p>You know, it happens.</p>
<p>But no, oh, there he is right there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oleg, he is a real life hell boy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like 170 pounds there.</p>
<p>Look at his arm.</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s totally crazy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s you doing left right there.</p>
<p>So by the way, Levan, you&rsquo;re going right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So can you say more about the mental side?</p>
<p>Are you visualizing what it takes to beat him?</p>
<p>Are you trying to get in his head?</p>
<p>All of these things.</p>
<p>So do you think it&rsquo;s possible to get in his head?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely strategies that you can do</p>
<p>depending on who it is you&rsquo;re facing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very good to know who it is you&rsquo;re fighting</p>
<p>and choose the correct strategy mentally.</p>
<p>But I always follow a process</p>
<p>when it comes to my mental preparation.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m far away from an event,</p>
<p>I just always build up my opponent,</p>
<p>build them, I build them, I respect them.</p>
<p>To a point where I almost start to fear them</p>
<p>and start to believe that they&rsquo;ll beat me.</p>
<p>And this is a very vital part of my preparation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I am right now with Levan.</p>
<p>I just build them up into this thing that scares me.</p>
<p>And it forces me to be responsible,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to lose, I want to win.</p>
<p>So the greater my opponent,</p>
<p>the greater I can build their worth in my mind,</p>
<p>the more motivation it gives me.</p>
<p>Then there comes a point when it changes.</p>
<p>And then I start to degrade them.</p>
<p>And yeah, that&rsquo;s when it normally starts to get fun.</p>
<p>And normally by the time I face them,</p>
<p>I just try and completely dominate</p>
<p>from every interaction from start to finish.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>When in the actual moment of the match,</p>
<p>like in the moments leading up to it,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the feeling?</p>
<p>Is it fear, is it confidence, anxiety?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going through your mind?</p>
<p>I love to fight, I love it, I always have.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s every day where you have the distractions of life,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s really living in the moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s whatever you love to do,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you can really be free.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m free when I&rsquo;m fighting.</p>
<p>So you put me in a good fight, and I just love it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think about the past,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about the future,</p>
<p>I just think about killing that dude in front of me,</p>
<p>and I enjoy that.</p>
<p>And just being intensely in the moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Just right there, just fighting as hard as I can.</p>
<p>Do you study the opponent?</p>
<p>Have you, for this particular match,</p>
<p>do you study videos of LeVon?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read everything.</p>
<p>I get opinions from other people.</p>
<p>I watch very closely, yeah.</p>
<p>What do you make of his evolution?</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s grown in size,</p>
<p>but also you&rsquo;ve talked about his</p>
<p>evolution technically as well.</p>
<p>Then studying him.</p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re in the build your opponent</p>
<p>to be terrifying stage, what makes him great?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very impressive.</p>
<p>The greatest thing about him is his strength.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that sets him apart from everyone.</p>
<p>His strength, specialized strength.</p>
<p>Exact strength for arm wrestling.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s unmatched.</p>
<p>Can we just linger on that word strength?</p>
<p>What does strength mean?</p>
<p>What does it feel like?</p>
<p>Are we talking about bicep, shoulder?</p>
<p>Are we talking about whatever controls the wrist?</p>
<p>Is it the, how does strength manifest?</p>
<p>When I touch your hand, when we grab arms,</p>
<p>I feel like fuck, that&rsquo;s strong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s control, right?</p>
<p>What is that feeling?</p>
<p>Where does that come from in arm wrestling?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re at the top of the world,</p>
<p>where does that come from?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s chains.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s chains of strength.</p>
<p>And in arm wrestling, this is like technical strength.</p>
<p>And we use these technical chains to fight each other.</p>
<p>The chains that I&rsquo;ll talk about is,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll talk, remember how we talked about the post,</p>
<p>this upwards drive, this ability to close this angle?</p>
<p>This is a chain.</p>
<p>It can be used, it&rsquo;s a technical attack.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also an attack that can be built with training.</p>
<p>Just the ability to just drive upwards.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a chain where you cup, right?</p>
<p>Cup your wrist in.</p>
<p>Cup your wrist in and the anchor and the chain</p>
<p>brings you right to your heart, right to your center.</p>
<p>This chain, and this can be done at any time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pronation chain,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s to turn your thumb over, right?</p>
<p>Turn your thumb over and you attack</p>
<p>the person&rsquo;s cupping chain.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a huge number of muscles</p>
<p>involved in each of those chains.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I say it&rsquo;s a chain, right?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re movements, and these movements</p>
<p>you can develop in the gym or through practice.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t mean, so it&rsquo;s easy to sort of</p>
<p>interpret strength to mean how much you curl, essentially.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you mean the chain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all has to do with the.</p>
<p>Right, and that&rsquo;s, I mean, people talk is it a bicep?</p>
<p>I mean, yes, there&rsquo;s bicep for sure involved,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll always be inaccurate if I try and tell you</p>
<p>what muscles are the, so I prefer to explain it</p>
<p>in a movement and then everything that&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>to do that movement, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and Levan&rsquo;s movements for arm wrestling</p>
<p>are incredibly impressive.</p>
<p>What do you attribute to, how much of that is genetics?</p>
<p>How much of it is some training thing he&rsquo;s doing?</p>
<p>I think that Levan is very special in terms</p>
<p>of his genetics, like not everybody can be Levan.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not many Levans out there.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;ve encountered in the bias that I always see,</p>
<p>like when people talk about people like Levan,</p>
<p>they discount the other side so very quickly.</p>
<p>And the thing is Levan rarely has to show the other side</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s so far ahead.</p>
<p>You talk about the technical application of the sport,</p>
<p>he so rarely needs to show it, but he&rsquo;s clearly incredible.</p>
<p>If you watch his progression, he came up</p>
<p>having very difficult technical struggles to overcome.</p>
<p>Georgia is a great country for arm wrestling.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s this guy, Gennady Kvikvinia,</p>
<p>who no one would ever say is not technical.</p>
<p>And you know, it took him years to defeat him</p>
<p>to a point where now it&rsquo;s not even a discussion.</p>
<p>Yeah, you talk about the progression,</p>
<p>they had a lot of battles together over the years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to see the tides turn.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and once they&rsquo;ve turned,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like completely, completely different level.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, he&rsquo;s got strength, he&rsquo;s got technique.</p>
<p>Some people will argue that his technique is flawed.</p>
<p>At times, they&rsquo;ve shown matches where</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t shown the best technique, but he&rsquo;s still won.</p>
<p>And I think sometimes he just plays with people.</p>
<p>You know, like there&rsquo;s a famous match that he had with,</p>
<p>they call him the Bruce Lee of arm wrestling,</p>
<p>a guy called Angurbaev, Kurtagali Angurbaev.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, they had a match in the top eight, great match.</p>
<p>Kurtagali is like 220 pound guy from Kazakhstan,</p>
<p>brilliant technician, but power wise,</p>
<p>you know, not in the same world.</p>
<p>And Kurtagali did well, even though he lost six nothing,</p>
<p>he still did well, but in my opinion, Levan didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Levan was like grabbing him low and just like, whatever.</p>
<p>Like, I will show him things that he&rsquo;s not seen before.</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>And he hasn&rsquo;t competed often in this rule set,</p>
<p>which will be a challenge for him.</p>
<p>But yeah, what can I say?</p>
<p>Like Levan, he&rsquo;s Everest.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you are seen by basically everybody</p>
<p>as the big, big underdog.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also, even in the Eastern,</p>
<p>even, I mean, I talk to Russians a lot.</p>
<p>You know that moment in Rocky</p>
<p>when they start cheering for Rocky?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of the, they love you, they want you to win.</p>
<p>And just, you know, it&rsquo;s not even,</p>
<p>just the battle itself is inspiring.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like the culmination in your career</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, you know, you&rsquo;re at the top for a long time,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s almost like it should be over for you,</p>
<p>but no, you&rsquo;re returning.</p>
<p>It is like this big moment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The big climb.</p>
<p>I will be the pointy end of the spear for North America.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ah, beautiful.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s, thanks for bringing that match up.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about just the match against Dennis,</p>
<p>your left hand match.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also terrifying and seen as one of the strongest,</p>
<p>probably one of, if not the strongest</p>
<p>left hand arm wrestler.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to be said there.</p>
<p>Maybe you could talk about this match at a high level.</p>
<p>Why did you take on this match?</p>
<p>Why did you do the left hand versus the right hand?</p>
<p>What, can you tell the story?</p>
<p>Okay, Dennis the Plankoff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much about this match.</p>
<p>I love Dennis.</p>
<p>Russian guy.</p>
<p>Yeah, Russian guy.</p>
<p>Russian, I used to call him Dennis Chernobyl.</p>
<p>Ah, what a monster.</p>
<p>He kind of led, I&rsquo;d say, this new era of arm wrestling,</p>
<p>where the super heavyweight strength level</p>
<p>has just gone through the roof.</p>
<p>I wanted the match for such a long time.</p>
<p>We tried to get the match.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t get it organized.</p>
<p>This is back in like 2008 to 2012.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t get the match, couldn&rsquo;t get the match.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been more of a one on one puller.</p>
<p>He was doing the tournament format.</p>
<p>I was ranked number one in the world,</p>
<p>and towards the end, it kind of was very undecided.</p>
<p>I ended up getting surgery.</p>
<p>I ended up abandoning the super heavyweight division.</p>
<p>I went down to the 225s for a few years.</p>
<p>WAL failed, temporarily.</p>
<p>So the 225 pound division was scrapped.</p>
<p>And I said, okay, I&rsquo;m going to go for the big crown once again.</p>
<p>And I started to go after super heavyweights.</p>
<p>The 2018 season was right hand.</p>
<p>I started to enter negotiations to have the match with him.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d been chasing the match for 10 years.</p>
<p>They wanted to do a left hand.</p>
<p>I wanted to do a right hand.</p>
<p>I just wanted to do the match.</p>
<p>I wanted to do the match with Dennis.</p>
<p>I wanted to meet Dennis.</p>
<p>So people should know that you were,</p>
<p>the right hand has always been your strongest.</p>
<p>It has been, I mean, I had surgery in 2016.</p>
<p>I hate to make excuses.</p>
<p>I hate to do it.</p>
<p>Dennis was better than me that day, even on my best day.</p>
<p>If you had gone back my entire career,</p>
<p>at no single day do I beat Dennis De Plankhoff in 2018.</p>
<p>I would like to think that I could maybe do it now.</p>
<p>But at that point, there would have been no version</p>
<p>that could have beat him.</p>
<p>Left or right?</p>
<p>Right hand?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m curious about the right, but left hand.</p>
<p>So is the world.</p>
<p>Well, it might still happen.</p>
<p>It might.</p>
<p>But Dennis completely destroyed me.</p>
<p>And I learned a lot from it.</p>
<p>I think before the Dennis match, I think I was, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what words to use.</p>
<p>Maybe I felt like my thinking was a little bit elitist.</p>
<p>And I really learned a lot.</p>
<p>I was really humbled that day by how far, and how professional,</p>
<p>and how prepared Dennis was, and how seriously he</p>
<p>took the sport.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mental, a slightly terrifying calmness</p>
<p>to him, which only comes with extreme preparation, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>His level of dedication was extremely inspiring to me.</p>
<p>I used to do a job where it was serious enough</p>
<p>that the price could be death.</p>
<p>And I arm wrestled throughout that entire period.</p>
<p>And I always kind of looked at the cost of doing an activity,</p>
<p>being death, limited to soldiering.</p>
<p>And I kind of changed my mind a lot after that match.</p>
<p>I realized that anything that you&rsquo;re in love with,</p>
<p>once you get far enough down the road,</p>
<p>and professional enough at it, it&rsquo;s going to kill you.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what you&rsquo;re doing, if you&rsquo;re crazy enough</p>
<p>about anything, it&rsquo;s probably going to take your life</p>
<p>from you in some way.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean you rush towards death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just your level of investment and level of risk</p>
<p>can have some catastrophic effects.</p>
<p>Bukowski, Charles Bukowski, I think</p>
<p>has the quote, do what you love and let it kill you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I understood that Dennis&rsquo;s level of professionalism</p>
<p>far exceeded mine in what we were doing at the time.</p>
<p>And I realized that I was no longer employed.</p>
<p>I was now in the world of professional arm wrestling.</p>
<p>And I realized that what was I doing?</p>
<p>How serious was I?</p>
<p>So Dennis is an incredible guy.</p>
<p>Is there moments in that match, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>humility there, too, from him.</p>
<p>That was a fascinating sort of, it</p>
<p>seemed like you realized that you just hit a wall</p>
<p>and you were not ready enough for it.</p>
<p>It was incredible.</p>
<p>There was so many things that I remember about the Dennis</p>
<p>match.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember seeing videos of somebody</p>
<p>and then meeting them in person, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I remember in the weigh ins, sorry, not the weigh ins,</p>
<p>the standoff that we did before the match.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at him, I&rsquo;m close.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at his arms.</p>
<p>And his bicep, it looked like an ass.</p>
<p>It was like a freaking glute muscle.</p>
<p>Like his entire structure was so sinewy and just so strong.</p>
<p>I was like, wow, he&rsquo;s physically so impressive.</p>
<p>And I remember when I arm wrestled him at a certain time,</p>
<p>he allowed me to kind of set my position.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really tell because it happens very quickly.</p>
<p>But he let me set my position, which</p>
<p>means I kind of got my locks in, where you can kind of really</p>
<p>do a great hold.</p>
<p>And he just ripped through me.</p>
<p>So you were able to get this great position.</p>
<p>So it was tore right through me.</p>
<p>And the first time I ever thought</p>
<p>that I had torn something.</p>
<p>I thought, after the match, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>geez, did he rip my chest right in half?</p>
<p>What, did it?</p>
<p>No, I think it was 100%.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I didn&rsquo;t actually.</p>
<p>Nothing went purple or anything.</p>
<p>But yeah, the strength gap was very significant with Dennis.</p>
<p>Could he, what would it take to beat him on that day?</p>
<p>It would take me just being a little bit stronger and more</p>
<p>healthy, yeah.</p>
<p>My left was not as healthy as it should be.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a full rounded technical arsenal.</p>
<p>It takes a time after surgery.</p>
<p>It really does.</p>
<p>You can be good, but after a surgery, like what I had,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably looking at three or four years</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;re starting to hit technical proficiency</p>
<p>the way you should be.</p>
<p>And yeah, just a bit stronger.</p>
<p>How do you interpret the calmness on his face?</p>
<p>Well, what is that about?</p>
<p>Is he actually that calm or is he just trained?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Russian thing, I think.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I see a lot of Russians like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so stoic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m such a fan of Russia.</p>
<p>I really want to go to Moscow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying it forever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never been?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>I want to go.</p>
<p>I want to just go and live there for a month and just train.</p>
<p>Moscow has got such a crazy arm wrestling scene.</p>
<p>From what I understand, they just have so many clubs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many strong athletes.</p>
<p>Just go and just lightning rod.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you considered doing something of that sort?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Rocky IV again.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And lead up to June.</p>
<p>I would certainly consider it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got only one trip planned at the moment.</p>
<p>Administration is very important.</p>
<p>What do you mean by administration?</p>
<p>Like managing your time?</p>
<p>Management.</p>
<p>Yeah, the management has to be very efficient.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m a tourist, when I&rsquo;m a visitor,</p>
<p>a little bit of that goes down.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m at my home and things are familiar,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a really great grasp on my time.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s in place.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>If I could magically transport Moscow into my hometown</p>
<p>and just go out and visit them, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very difficult when you&rsquo;re traveling.</p>
<p>You have to figure out what you&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>how are you getting the food, all the socializing.</p>
<p>Plus, you&rsquo;re more and more a celebrity,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a social interaction, which</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how draining that could be on you</p>
<p>outside of the arm wrestling table.</p>
<p>So you have to manage all of that,</p>
<p>because ultimately, you have to focus on the fight ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of my strength comes from just</p>
<p>being in a familiar place, doing my routine.</p>
<p>I love to travel.</p>
<p>I love to get out there and meet people and new experiences.</p>
<p>But when I just want to really prepare for a big match,</p>
<p>yeah, home is where I get strong.</p>
<p>So that loss against Dennis was one</p>
<p>of the few losses in your career.</p>
<p>How did that feel in the moments after, in the days after,</p>
<p>in the months after, in the years after?</p>
<p>How has it changed you as an arm wrestler as a human being?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s tough to lose.</p>
<p>Still haunt you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I actually was really happy to lose to Dennis,</p>
<p>because sometimes when you lose a match,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of matches that I&rsquo;ve lost where they upset me,</p>
<p>because I know I made a mistake.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make a mistake with Dennis.</p>
<p>He was just way better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing I could have done that day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really at peace with it.</p>
<p>Dennis, to me, was just a big inspiration.</p>
<p>I think that me arm wrestling Dennis left handed that day</p>
<p>just let me touch probably one of the strongest</p>
<p>human beings on the arm wrestling table</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ever lived, left handed.</p>
<p>So knowing that&rsquo;s possible is almost like inspiration to you</p>
<p>that I can be at that level, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Seeing what Dennis did, just trying</p>
<p>to absorb a little bit of his knowledge planted seeds in me.</p>
<p>When I look at my career, it&rsquo;s a bit like the stock market.</p>
<p>But for sure, I&rsquo;m trending upwards.</p>
<p>And since really kind of wrapping my mind</p>
<p>around some of the Russian philosophies,</p>
<p>they really changed my training systems.</p>
<p>There were some base philosophies</p>
<p>that they talked to me about over there</p>
<p>that massively impacted my training.</p>
<p>Is it possible to convert some of those philosophies</p>
<p>into words?</p>
<p>Can you describe some of the ideas they taught you?</p>
<p>Never smile.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Man, it takes a while to break the ice</p>
<p>with a lot of these guys.</p>
<p>Well, once you do, that&rsquo;s the deepest bonds you can form.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>I think that I was raised under, I believe it&rsquo;s a flawed.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not flawed, because it has its value as well.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s best if you understand both philosophies.</p>
<p>I think a North American thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just so ingrained in our fitness society is no pain, no gain.</p>
<p>And just pushing, and sweating, and going harder,</p>
<p>and fighting through, and grit, and tough.</p>
<p>And then you talk to the Russians,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, yeah, never fail.</p>
<p>You never fail.</p>
<p>Never go to failure.</p>
<p>Always feel good.</p>
<p>It should always feel good.</p>
<p>And those two philosophies express themselves</p>
<p>very differently.</p>
<p>And if you want to get strong, yeah, don&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<p>So they also are believers of volume.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of strategies,</p>
<p>but volume is a massive principle.</p>
<p>And volume is very hard to achieve</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re believing in no pain, no gain.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really go together.</p>
<p>No pain, no gain, more injuries.</p>
<p>So is there parallels?</p>
<p>Because in wrestling, some of the greatest wrestlers</p>
<p>of all time are Russian.</p>
<p>And they were big, Dan Gable talks about it,</p>
<p>they were big on play.</p>
<p>Like, lighter wrestling is probably,</p>
<p>ultimately, actually, it boils down to</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you achieve higher volume.</p>
<p>Like, over the stretch of years,</p>
<p>the way to reduce injury.</p>
<p>I mean, in wrestling also, technique</p>
<p>might have greater value than it does in arm wrestling.</p>
<p>Obviously, technique is extremely important</p>
<p>in arm wrestling.</p>
<p>But power can defeat technique, it seems like.</p>
<p>In wrestling, you can get away.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways you can really do sneak attacks,</p>
<p>sort of use leverage on those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s even more incentive to do play</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But do you see the parallels between the two worlds,</p>
<p>wrestling and arm wrestling?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Well, you saw what I did the other night, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m playing on the table for hours, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my number one training thing that I do,</p>
<p>is I go on the table for hours and I play.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you did, Sergey, can you pull up that video?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on Devin&rsquo;s channel, the water tank one.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s like 180p.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, the wifi in there was so bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great, I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, maybe, I don&rsquo;t know if it was fish eye,</p>
<p>but it had a fish eye feel, it was crowded.</p>
<p>I mean, so much camaraderie, it was amazing.</p>
<p>But maybe just a brief mention of Dimitri,</p>
<p>the Russian guy.</p>
<p>What, in that play, what are some memorable things here?</p>
<p>Like, when you go against a bunch of different people,</p>
<p>a bunch of strangers, what are all the differences</p>
<p>and how do you grow from them, how do you learn from them?</p>
<p>Well, everybody&rsquo;s a bit different.</p>
<p>So, I love to go to new clubs,</p>
<p>because the energy&rsquo;s always high.</p>
<p>Like, the first time you go to a club,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s trying to kill you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so they&rsquo;re gonna.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s excitement and there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>and so you feed off of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do, you can, if you&rsquo;re able to be strong enough</p>
<p>to absorb it without injury, it&rsquo;s awesome, it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re giving you everything they can.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s very specific, right?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m gonna get way stronger at arm wrestling.</p>
<p>And what I try and do, when I go to these places,</p>
<p>is I make an assumption, I make an assumption</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m the best guy there.</p>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;ll arm wrestle in a way that kind of protects them,</p>
<p>because the more I can protect them</p>
<p>and kind of keep them kind of in a good position,</p>
<p>they can actually give me more, right?</p>
<p>So, I kind of give them little pieces</p>
<p>that I think will put them in a place</p>
<p>that they can really give me more.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>And then, when I see somebody like Dimitri,</p>
<p>I pull that in a little bit, right?</p>
<p>So, okay, so I know Dimitri&rsquo;s the number one guy in Texas.</p>
<p>Lots of respect to the guy.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t give him all the pieces</p>
<p>until I really kind of gauge where he&rsquo;s at,</p>
<p>because I certainly, in training, don&rsquo;t wanna fail.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that, I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>When you fail in arm wrestling,</p>
<p>imagine it&rsquo;s just bad technique.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying, and bad technique,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get hurt, yeah.</p>
<p>So, you always want to be in a strong position here.</p>
<p>What about, how does endurance come into play here?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s video of you strapping up with Dimitri.</p>
<p>How do you, I mean, you went for like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>two hours?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was long.</p>
<p>So, this first run of the video, I think,</p>
<p>was a little over an hour, and then I took a break,</p>
<p>and I probably did another 45 minutes or so, but.</p>
<p>I mean, do you, how can, are you okay</p>
<p>with the endurance aspect of this?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s probably, like, when you talk</p>
<p>to the arm wrestling world, that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m best known for, is my endurance.</p>
<p>So, this helps build that.</p>
<p>It does, but that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing it to get strong.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is one of the best ways to get strong,</p>
<p>especially far away from a tournament,</p>
<p>or any kind of an event.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna do this, you know, even a month,</p>
<p>or even six weeks, or even, maybe even eight weeks</p>
<p>before a big event.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want to already be kind of shrinking my volume,</p>
<p>but far away from an event, yeah, as much volume</p>
<p>as your body can handle, and you&rsquo;ll feel it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll feel it.</p>
<p>Like, I felt it at times, like, you know,</p>
<p>after the hour mark, I&rsquo;m like, okay,</p>
<p>I can feel my blood sugar kind of diminishing.</p>
<p>I can feel, like, the blood that&rsquo;s going to my muscles</p>
<p>is kinda like, it&rsquo;s not really pushing more good stuff in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m starting to break down, and you don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>Quick pause.</p>
<p>Bathroom break?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good, I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>I kinda need one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll maybe get a sweater, it&rsquo;s a bit.</p>
<p>Is it cold?</p>
<p>Does that matter?</p>
<p>Does that care for kind of continuity?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I can make it warmer.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I&rsquo;ll just put a sweater on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And I still love the idea of you going to Russia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And training there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also making a trip out to Russia.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, when?</p>
<p>For different reasons.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s hard with the current conflict,</p>
<p>the tensions there, but I&rsquo;m hoping before your match,</p>
<p>actually, so May, for a couple of interviews</p>
<p>with a couple of folks, some of which people know.</p>
<p>Maybe I could ask you about,</p>
<p>to comment on some matches that stand out to you</p>
<p>in your career.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Is there something, is there a particular,</p>
<p>I have a bunch that I really enjoy,</p>
<p>but is there something that stands out to you as memorable?</p>
<p>We talked about sort of a defining loss, perhaps,</p>
<p>to Dennis.</p>
<p>Then you faced Michael Todd, like you mentioned,</p>
<p>John Brzenk, you faced Matt.</p>
<p>Is there something that stands out to you</p>
<p>that technically or psychologically</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve learned a lot from?</p>
<p>I feel like I try and learn something from every match,</p>
<p>but there is a very special match to me</p>
<p>that to this day, I can&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>Very weird phenomenon.</p>
<p>So, I think it was 2005 was my first combat tour overseas.</p>
<p>So, it was a active tour.</p>
<p>Among other things, I got shot during that tour,</p>
<p>we got blown, long tour, rough tour.</p>
<p>And I trained the whole time through</p>
<p>knowing that at the end of this,</p>
<p>I was gonna have a big match.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s a champion, a guy called Ron Bath.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s kind of, if there was no John Brzenk,</p>
<p>there would be Ron Bath.</p>
<p>Okay, so, extremely decorated,</p>
<p>unbelievable arm wrestler from the United States.</p>
<p>And this is kind of when I was just</p>
<p>kind of coming up in the sport still.</p>
<p>I was fairly well established,</p>
<p>I was definitely the best guy in Canada.</p>
<p>And I had been for a few years,</p>
<p>but I hadn&rsquo;t really expanded internationally too much.</p>
<p>So, I had a one on one match with Ron Bath</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the one.</p>
<p>Yeah, extremely hard fought battle.</p>
<p>Was three one, I think, three one,</p>
<p>but every match was really close</p>
<p>and he won the first one.</p>
<p>And I had to kind of dig my way out of the trenches</p>
<p>and ended up coming back and winning.</p>
<p>But it was a match that was probably,</p>
<p>it was probably one of my closest matches ever.</p>
<p>And it was.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s frustration on you.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What was going through your mind here with these?</p>
<p>Was it, first of all, going in,</p>
<p>did you think you could beat him?</p>
<p>What was the level of confidence?</p>
<p>I always think I can win, like I always do.</p>
<p>But, you know, a lot of respect to the guy.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, I always think I can do it.</p>
<p>So how did, what lessons did you take away from it?</p>
<p>Why is it so meaningful to you?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s what happened afterwards.</p>
<p>So, I had some kind of a release afterwards.</p>
<p>And that was the strange thing to me.</p>
<p>So, match ended and I felt like,</p>
<p>so relaxed afterwards, so calm, so, so, you know, satisfied.</p>
<p>Because it was one of those matches</p>
<p>that kind of takes everything from you, but you win it.</p>
<p>And I was relaxing in the chair</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never had this sensation before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had it afterwards,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like the center of my backbone just exploded.</p>
<p>And it was like, it&rsquo;s so weird, right?</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m not really spiritual that much or religious even,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like a fire just ripped through me</p>
<p>and it only lasted an instant.</p>
<p>Just exploded through my whole body,</p>
<p>out the top, through my feet.</p>
<p>And then it was gone, that was it.</p>
<p>Weirdest thing I&rsquo;ve ever felt in my entire life.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it was as a result of,</p>
<p>yeah, but it was as a result of what happened in the match</p>
<p>and leading up to it, I had some kind of a release.</p>
<p>To what it does, it almost,</p>
<p>how did you interpret it psychologically?</p>
<p>Was it like some kind of, I mean,</p>
<p>not to be spiritual or whatever,</p>
<p>but some kind of superpower that was like,</p>
<p>like a lingering feeling like, holy shit, I, you know.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t explain it.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t really tried hard enough to try to.</p>
<p>But something changed.</p>
<p>Something happened there, yeah.</p>
<p>Something happened to me.</p>
<p>I was sore for about three or four months afterwards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it smoked out my entire body.</p>
<p>Yeah, that whole summer I was kind of sore.</p>
<p>And yeah, and then after that,</p>
<p>like two or three years later,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I won the world championships.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, all the matches are,</p>
<p>you know, you get something from people, like, you know,</p>
<p>you study them, you take something from them.</p>
<p>People have an invisible crown and he had one.</p>
<p>And I think I took it from him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe that was the feeling of wearing the crown.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>What about all the trash talk?</p>
<p>How much of that did you learn?</p>
<p>Does that come naturally to you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the most charismatic, fun.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s always like respect behind it.</p>
<p>I would say to me, and I&rsquo;m a fan of a lot of sports,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the greatest trash talkers in all of sports</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever seen because you&rsquo;re able to talk shit,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so much love and respect behind it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just masterful.</p>
<p>But you also get into people&rsquo;s heads in the moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful to watch</p>
<p>because it really gets to some people.</p>
<p>So where does that come from?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful weapon, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Your voice is a powerful, powerful weapon.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s underutilized by so many athletes</p>
<p>because they think that it&rsquo;s not sportsmanlike</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But the truth is, I mean, you can be a weak person,</p>
<p>but with your voice, you can influence</p>
<p>and change any number of things.</p>
<p>And the same thing happens in a fight between two people.</p>
<p>If you can just be a never ending, you know,</p>
<p>flow of negative encouragement to someone</p>
<p>or, you know, suggestion, anything can happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tool.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re fighting a person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just fighting them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fighting everyone who&rsquo;s watching.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fighting the crowd, the referees.</p>
<p>And, you know, to get in the most ideal positions,</p>
<p>situations, you need to use your voice, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s, for people who haven&rsquo;t seen,</p>
<p>I definitely recommend you watch</p>
<p>a bunch of arm wrestling matches</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a crowd really gets into it.</p>
<p>And it feels like there&rsquo;s a really intimate connection</p>
<p>with the crowd.</p>
<p>I suppose because the crowd is allowed</p>
<p>to be very close to you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>I want the crowd like right up on me.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>So sometimes, oh yeah.</p>
<p>So who are you, whenever you talk to somebody,</p>
<p>you literally pick somebody from the crowd?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I&rsquo;ll fucking, like I&rsquo;ll start fucking off</p>
<p>his fans and like, yeah, like I&rsquo;ll start talking</p>
<p>to their wives or whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, there&rsquo;s Jody.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s pretty dangerous to listen to also.</p>
<p>But yeah, one of his buddies, Mike Solares,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s, you know, really good arm wrestler,</p>
<p>was cheering for him, so I started to go after him.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Smiling the whole time.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fun, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fan, it&rsquo;s fun to listen to,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also, what&rsquo;s fun is how much it actually affects</p>
<p>some of the people you&rsquo;re facing.</p>
<p>They get frustrated.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to see.</p>
<p>Well, you have to fight, right?</p>
<p>Like a lot of people think things will be given to them.</p>
<p>And the thing that, you know, I&rsquo;ve always believed</p>
<p>from the time I was very young,</p>
<p>like I was convinced that our inevitable death</p>
<p>was gonna come from aliens, right?</p>
<p>Like some super aggressive, super violent species</p>
<p>was gonna come and smoke us all, you know?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m not like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, but as soon as one person is,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re forced to have to accept it as reality, right?</p>
<p>So I like to fight for every single thing.</p>
<p>I like to try and be more and more aggressive.</p>
<p>And if someone matches me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I can use my endurance.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t, then I have the tactical advantage.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of my balance point.</p>
<p>And then, by the way, you also yell at the ref.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, the games, there&rsquo;s like levels to this game,</p>
<p>but you know, the feeling sometimes</p>
<p>when people get frustrated is like,</p>
<p>okay, this person&rsquo;s cheating,</p>
<p>or like you&rsquo;re trying to get a good grip</p>
<p>before it goes.</p>
<p>And I think some of the frustration</p>
<p>in combination with the trash talk is,</p>
<p>well, this person is cheating,</p>
<p>but everybody is like kind of trying to cheat,</p>
<p>get an edge within the rules.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I try and just ramp it, ramp it, ramp it.</p>
<p>But you know, everybody&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned how to play the game</p>
<p>based off of the tools that I have physically.</p>
<p>And for me, this works because, you know,</p>
<p>my genetic makeup is more of a persistence hunter, right?</p>
<p>So like, I need to extend things,</p>
<p>and that works well for me.</p>
<p>You know, if I was more explosive,</p>
<p>I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have the same strategies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, for people who are watching,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wearing a No Limits hoodie,</p>
<p>which is one of your nicknames.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wash this thing too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my bacterial shield to the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>So you mentioned Jody.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s often in your corner</p>
<p>and does perhaps more trash talking than even you.</p>
<p>So I mean, if we could step away,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s an incredible human being.</p>
<p>As sort of as a fan, it&rsquo;s fun to watch the two of you,</p>
<p>both when you&rsquo;re arm wrestling and just as people.</p>
<p>I just see so much, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>kindness and love radiating from the two of you</p>
<p>whenever you&rsquo;re trash talking</p>
<p>or talking about just random things</p>
<p>or just talking about life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a beautiful thing to watch.</p>
<p>And thank you for sharing that with the world.</p>
<p>But maybe can you, she paid me to ask you this,</p>
<p>but what are the things you love about Jody,</p>
<p>your wife, Jody Laird?</p>
<p>What are the ways she&rsquo;s affected your life?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jody and I go way back, right?</p>
<p>We were in high school together.</p>
<p>The thing that I admire most in people is bravery.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s the most admirable quality.</p>
<p>And Jody always has inspired me</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s such a fighter.</p>
<p>If she believes that something&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>she does not back down.</p>
<p>She will not.</p>
<p>And not to say that she can&rsquo;t change her mind</p>
<p>because she can, but while she is convicted,</p>
<p>she will not stop fighting.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s pulled me out of the fire repeatedly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve lived through so many things.</p>
<p>Very lucky.</p>
<p>How has she made you a better arm wrestler?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s fed me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I could see your videos of your house</p>
<p>basically coming apart when she&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, without Jody, I&rsquo;m on the street living in a tent</p>
<p>and yeah, eating dog food.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Bravery.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about love?</p>
<p>How has love made you stronger?</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re gonna make Devin uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Yeah, love is difficult to accept.</p>
<p>Love is one of those things that,</p>
<p>a lot of times, you don&rsquo;t feel worthy of it.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s hard sometimes to accept someone&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>And someone who really loves you,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll love you even when you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And here you go, you&rsquo;re gonna make me cry, Alex.</p>
<p>Yeah, Jody and I have been through so much.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s shown me how she supported me</p>
<p>just repeatedly, repeatedly.</p>
<p>Some of that is loyalty and patience and perseverance</p>
<p>and all those things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like when love really shows itself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like sticking through together for years</p>
<p>even when you&rsquo;re through the shitty times.</p>
<p>Love and faith are powerful forces in this universe.</p>
<p>Without them, we can descend into darkness very quickly.</p>
<p>As a world, even between people.</p>
<p>When love and faith is destroyed, then we fall apart.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been graced by the love that Jody&rsquo;s given me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s allowed me to continue to build.</p>
<p>When you have love between people, then you build together.</p>
<p>I love my family, I love Canada,</p>
<p>I love the arm wrestling community.</p>
<p>I have a love for what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve</p>
<p>as a human species, you know?</p>
<p>And when that falls apart, we don&rsquo;t have much.</p>
<p>Yeah, just with my boy there, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You also mentioned you once had a job</p>
<p>where your death was a real possibility.</p>
<p>So you were in the Canadian Special Forces.</p>
<p>What did you take away from that experience,</p>
<p>that time in your life?</p>
<p>It was such a great life.</p>
<p>Really, really loved it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I never wanted to leave.</p>
<p>I never thought I would leave.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d be there my whole life.</p>
<p>A real honor to get to serve.</p>
<p>What did you get to do?</p>
<p>What was the things you loved craftsmanship wise,</p>
<p>like fun things you get to do, learn and challenge yourself?</p>
<p>And you mentioned sort of honor in terms of the serving part.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, my favorite thing about serving in the Special Forces</p>
<p>was for sure the people that I worked with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the first thing I could say, you know,</p>
<p>I never, I always felt like totally comfortable</p>
<p>and putting my life in the other guy&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>I was so happy to be in a place where I felt I could follow.</p>
<p>Like didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Like I knew that the people ahead of me were incredible.</p>
<p>I knew the people beside me were incredible.</p>
<p>So just having that faith in your team, it&rsquo;s very special.</p>
<p>And to know that they&rsquo;re there for a reason</p>
<p>that has nothing to do with money, you know,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what kind of brings everybody together</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re there for a higher purpose.</p>
<p>And in terms of being an adrenaline junkie,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing like it.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s nothing like, you know,</p>
<p>going out at night and fighting.</p>
<p>And when I say fighting, like my whole life I wanted to fight.</p>
<p>And to me, there&rsquo;s a lot of, and look at,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this in the past</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s been a personal failure of mine</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve said things like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the highest level that you can do.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe that to be true anymore.</p>
<p>But at the time, I thought it was the best way</p>
<p>I could express my drives that I had, you know,</p>
<p>to be a fighter.</p>
<p>So your sense in the past and maybe in part now</p>
<p>is that sort of fighting is when humans get a chance</p>
<p>to express themselves deeply, like that mix of the bravery,</p>
<p>the integrity, the, whatever that is that makes us human,</p>
<p>that human spirit can really shine.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe that anymore.</p>
<p>I believe that you can do that in any field,</p>
<p>in any discipline, you know, if you go hard enough,</p>
<p>it all kind of starts to feel the same.</p>
<p>But at the time, that, you know,</p>
<p>expression to me was really, really awesome.</p>
<p>I loved close quarter battle.</p>
<p>That was my favorite thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the whole reason I was there.</p>
<p>Can you describe close quarter battle?</p>
<p>Close quarter battle is team fighting.</p>
<p>So, and it can look a lot of different ways,</p>
<p>but basically it&rsquo;s ground troops doing something</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s ground troops doing some kind of a mission.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the orchestrated movement that is the skill.</p>
<p>The orchestrated movement and the drills done quickly</p>
<p>and accurately, it&rsquo;s very difficult to do.</p>
<p>With communication?</p>
<p>With communication.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s basically cooperating together,</p>
<p>communicating, there&rsquo;s some strategy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some adapting to the changing environment.</p>
<p>And the more the team works together,</p>
<p>the less communication there is.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an amazing thing to do,</p>
<p>to be part of a machine, well, machine,</p>
<p>a team of people who can fight together like that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re really designed to do it.</p>
<p>Like, as good as we can fight as individuals,</p>
<p>the thing that makes us really good</p>
<p>is our ability to fight as a team.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of the things that makes us really human</p>
<p>is that collective intelligence, that social aspect.</p>
<p>And fighting is the highest of stakes.</p>
<p>So that social interaction under the highest of stakes</p>
<p>is, really does bring out something that&rsquo;s deeply human.</p>
<p>I mean, war in general brings out something deeply human.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, obvious to say that it&rsquo;s tragic</p>
<p>that it results in so much loss of life and well being.</p>
<p>Let me, if it&rsquo;s okay, for a brief moment</p>
<p>to take us back to arm wrestling.</p>
<p>We did this offline, we talked about,</p>
<p>you gave me some advice about arm wrestling.</p>
<p>But maybe do a high level overview</p>
<p>of the different styles and strategies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>We talked about the importance of strength and power.</p>
<p>But is there offensive, defensive styles?</p>
<p>Is there, we mentioned King&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>What would you classify your style as?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice for people that don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe even zoom back out.</p>
<p>So arm wrestling is a sport where two people have to,</p>
<p>when we talk about strictly the sport,</p>
<p>put their elbow on a particular pad,</p>
<p>means they have to keep that elbow on that pad.</p>
<p>And they win when the back of one of their hands</p>
<p>crosses some kind of, or basically touches the table.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And when you actually lock up, you do so,</p>
<p>depending on the organization, without straps,</p>
<p>meaning there&rsquo;s just you, agree, it&rsquo;s like mutual agreement</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to clasp your hands in a way that&rsquo;s fair</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a referee that helps ensure that it&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>But of course there&rsquo;s these little games going on.</p>
<p>And then when you actually go all out with this battle,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s no straps, you can slip out.</p>
<p>So often you&rsquo;ll put the straps, which means you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like marriage, you&rsquo;re committed for,</p>
<p>like somebody will have to lose essentially.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no pulling out.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of the battle within that.</p>
<p>What are the different styles that you can speak to</p>
<p>that people that don&rsquo;t know arm wrestling could understand?</p>
<p>Yeah, we can start to kind of just dance</p>
<p>around the subject a bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s a lot of different types.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s specialists and there&rsquo;s kind of blenders</p>
<p>and people who are very versatile.</p>
<p>A lot of guys win world championships on one singular move.</p>
<p>They get just extremely crisp at say a hook or a top roll.</p>
<p>And their style is very kind of focused.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see it with a lot of athletes,</p>
<p>like kind of a talk about guy who&rsquo;s very active,</p>
<p>a guy called Jerry Cataret.</p>
<p>As soon as you think Jerry Cataret,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a very unique style.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a flop wrist press.</p>
<p>So most of his technique is built around this one system.</p>
<p>Flop wrist means what it sounds like.</p>
<p>Your wrist is flopped, so it looks like you&rsquo;re losing.</p>
<p>So he is pushing from a losing position.</p>
<p>No, he will be offensive.</p>
<p>So he will be in a press, so offensively,</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;ll give his hand away</p>
<p>so that he can get his shoulder behind it properly.</p>
<p>So he doesn&rsquo;t, wow.</p>
<p>So you can press, press means push.</p>
<p>Push, yeah, without having that hook position.</p>
<p>Which is what most people are always looking for.</p>
<p>And Jerry&rsquo;s looking for it as well.</p>
<p>And then, so example, there&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another specialist, Matt Mask.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a top roller, right?</p>
<p>Basically, that&rsquo;s his great move is a top roll.</p>
<p>And his other weapons aren&rsquo;t nearly as powerful.</p>
<p>Just incredible top roll.</p>
<p>And then you have a lot of athletes that are more blended.</p>
<p>They have a lot of good options.</p>
<p>I think that I probably fall more into that category.</p>
<p>You have people who are more speed guys, okay?</p>
<p>So they try and do very little, I call it attrition, right?</p>
<p>So a lot of people are very willing to trade energy, right?</p>
<p>Because they have faith that their gas tank</p>
<p>or their pool eventually will tire the other person out.</p>
<p>So anytime there&rsquo;s a trade, they&rsquo;ll trade.</p>
<p>Whereas a guy like Travis Bajan,</p>
<p>he was very, very well known</p>
<p>as being extremely explosive, right?</p>
<p>But if the match stops, typically he&rsquo;s gonna lose.</p>
<p>All right, so based off of your genetics, your hands,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to skin it.</p>
<p>So I think you said something like you&rsquo;re a 22nd guy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m a 22nd guy.</p>
<p>So what are the seconds we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>So a lot of the power people,</p>
<p>they want to win in the first maybe five seconds,</p>
<p>like just that first push, that first press.</p>
<p>Absolutely, right to the pad, yeah.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re trying to hold off that attack.</p>
<p>Yeah, if I beat you in a second,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not in the same world, yeah.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;m with my peer group,</p>
<p>I will typically win 20 seconds and beyond.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a typical win for me when I&rsquo;m with a peer.</p>
<p>Whereas other guys, when they&rsquo;re with their peers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll win in a second, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they do it, that&rsquo;s the way they&rsquo;re built,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way they train.</p>
<p>Yeah, most guys at a higher level at all</p>
<p>starts to kind of, it starts to get more and more difficult</p>
<p>to be a specialist at the high level now.</p>
<p>Some people just have little holes in their games.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare to get someone who can really do all the moves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare.</p>
<p>Where would you put Levan?</p>
<p>I would not say he&rsquo;s a specialist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say his top roll is his strongest move.</p>
<p>Top roll?</p>
<p>Top roll is his strongest move, yeah.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing about the specialist</p>
<p>versus the blender, there&rsquo;s a counter, right?</p>
<p>Every move has a move that theoretically</p>
<p>should be the right choice.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a single move guy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a guy out there who&rsquo;ll get you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;ll be very difficult for you to beat that guy.</p>
<p>But when you come to a tournament,</p>
<p>typically specialists do much better</p>
<p>in tournament scenarios because their singular move</p>
<p>can get them through a tournament</p>
<p>very quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Whereas you get a blender in a tournament,</p>
<p>they typically will have longer and more difficult matches.</p>
<p>And by, oh, right, yeah.</p>
<p>But in supermatch format, typically blenders do better.</p>
<p>So we offline also talked about arm sumo</p>
<p>or freedom arm wrestling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you wanna call it.</p>
<p>Oh, I love freedom.</p>
<p>Well, exactly, North American way.</p>
<p>So this is this idea, and I watched a few videos,</p>
<p>and it looks fun, is basically removing the restriction</p>
<p>of having to keep your elbow on the pad</p>
<p>and just being able to arm wrestle over the whole table.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve mentioned that the criticism that gets</p>
<p>is it might be injury prone or something like that.</p>
<p>So can you describe this arm sumo, freedom arm wrestling</p>
<p>idea?</p>
<p>When you come to freedom arm wrestling,</p>
<p>basically it removes the limitation</p>
<p>of a standard arm wrestling table.</p>
<p>So basically every single thing</p>
<p>is a freedom arm wrestling table.</p>
<p>Some are better than others.</p>
<p>So looking for that nice table where we can kind of</p>
<p>stand apart from each other and we&rsquo;re anatomically</p>
<p>in a fairly safe position.</p>
<p>And the rules in freedom, the way you win,</p>
<p>is the knuckles must either touch the tabletop</p>
<p>or you hold it off the edge for a three count.</p>
<p>So this is the main way to win.</p>
<p>Yes, you can foul, like if you lift your elbow up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still a foul, but you have the entire playing surface.</p>
<p>So your elbow&rsquo;s no longer limited to your seven by seven</p>
<p>or seven by nine pad, so you can move it all over the table.</p>
<p>You can move your body around the table a bit too.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a big table, your body</p>
<p>could largely be on the table.</p>
<p>Yeah, so basically it&rsquo;s like adjusting your ring size.</p>
<p>So arm wrestling, you&rsquo;re fighting in a phone booth, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re fighting in a field, you&rsquo;re fighting just bigger.</p>
<p>So it just makes the sport bigger.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is Japan.</p>
<p>But even on a small table, even in a slightly larger</p>
<p>phone booth, you can get a lot more fun and variety.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting to watch.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I think it makes the sport bigger.</p>
<p>I actually believe that it&rsquo;s the future of the sport.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>Because it makes it more accessible.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t need the equipment.</p>
<p>You can do it at a bar, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, less equipment requirements.</p>
<p>Most kids start freedom.</p>
<p>Like most kids arm wrestle on school desks.</p>
<p>And like if you see a guy on the street, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>whatever, you can arm wrestle anywhere.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to bring your table around with you.</p>
<p>If we talked about the elite level,</p>
<p>if somebody was interested in starting in arm wrestling</p>
<p>or going from just like, you go to the gym,</p>
<p>you kind of lift, you&rsquo;ve arm wrestled a few times,</p>
<p>trying to get better at it, trying to learn.</p>
<p>How would you advise getting better to where you can</p>
<p>beat your closest buddies?</p>
<p>That first step.</p>
<p>First step, I&rsquo;d say find people.</p>
<p>Find people.</p>
<p>Find good people.</p>
<p>Volume.</p>
<p>Well, get with a club.</p>
<p>Get with people who know what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>who can mentor you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>I realized there&rsquo;s a club in Austin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s in a lot of places.</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>We got this app called Armbet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is a app that helps you find other people there.</p>
<p>Yeah, very easy.</p>
<p>But I mean, they&rsquo;re all over social networks.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of widespread now.</p>
<p>But yeah, find people.</p>
<p>Find people and it&rsquo;s just much easier to learn</p>
<p>with another person and you&rsquo;ll get stronger that way.</p>
<p>But I mean, do the lifts.</p>
<p>I mean, if you go to the gym, just start doing the lifts.</p>
<p>And right away, those will technically prepare you.</p>
<p>What are the lifts?</p>
<p>Can we describe what the first one is?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;d say if you wanna just keep it</p>
<p>very, very simple, let&rsquo;s just talk about three.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much more than three.</p>
<p>But when you talk about energy allocation,</p>
<p>these three lifts, in my opinion,</p>
<p>should be like 90% of your investment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very big, these three lifts.</p>
<p>And the exact percentages, you can argue about it,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll start off with the cupping of the wrist.</p>
<p>Just this, it&rsquo;s a simple thing.</p>
<p>And do it with a cable.</p>
<p>You can get a thicker diameter, so it kind of</p>
<p>is more out on your fingers where an armrest</p>
<p>is gonna attack you.</p>
<p>Because any good armrest is gonna attack your fingers.</p>
<p>So like open hand.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, for health, yes, you could.</p>
<p>But if you wanna be really specific,</p>
<p>you train exactly the way you would at a table.</p>
<p>In the position that you actually start that match.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then you&rsquo;re just doing this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yes, to your center.</p>
<p>One of the big misconceptions in armwrestling</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re aiming for that pin pad.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The center.</p>
<p>The chest up here.</p>
<p>Bring it close to you.</p>
<p>Make it come close to you, right?</p>
<p>You see like whenever I do my exercises,</p>
<p>the vector is always pulling straight towards me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so just cupping close to you.</p>
<p>The most dangerous thing that a person can do to me</p>
<p>on an armwrestling match is just pull me away from my body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a terrible thing for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that cupping, that&rsquo;s a massive part of the sport.</p>
<p>So now when you think what does the cup do</p>
<p>to the other person, if I cup, they get turned over.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So this has to get really strong.</p>
<p>This pronation.</p>
<p>So to fight that rolling.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s through the thumb.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, so you put, got it, you put on the thumb</p>
<p>and you put this motion.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So those two things, those two things together,</p>
<p>this cupping and rolling, this is what&rsquo;s gonna make</p>
<p>the person&rsquo;s hand bend back, and once the person&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>is bent back, just their whole game gets cut to pieces.</p>
<p>They have very little good options.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all like nasty stuff.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, so those two things, that&rsquo;s a huge part</p>
<p>of your investment.</p>
<p>Rise.</p>
<p>Always be climbing.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, those three simple things, that&rsquo;s what I would tell</p>
<p>anybody to spend most of their time on if you wanna</p>
<p>become an art wrestler.</p>
<p>So bands would be good for this?</p>
<p>Bands are great because they&rsquo;re easy to transport.</p>
<p>The only problem I have with bands is like if you like</p>
<p>to measure, you know, and if you like to be precise,</p>
<p>bands just aren&rsquo;t that precise.</p>
<p>Right, so to have growth.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just, I mean, it&rsquo;s just like, you know, you know exactly</p>
<p>what you need, the prescription is kind of, a band</p>
<p>is kind of like, and a lot of people, myself included,</p>
<p>I like to know exactly my outputs, so weights.</p>
<p>So would it be like cables?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Cables are nice.</p>
<p>Bands are great, too.</p>
<p>I mix the two.</p>
<p>Bands are when I kind of don&rsquo;t need to, they&rsquo;re more</p>
<p>like easy for me.</p>
<p>When I train bands, bands are dangerous</p>
<p>because the acceleration is so high on them.</p>
<p>Like when you screw up with band training,</p>
<p>the acceleration is way faster than gravity, right?</p>
<p>So if you do something bad, it can make it go</p>
<p>really much worse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that you didn&rsquo;t mention bicep curls or.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a chain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a chain.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re, I mean, the idea if you focus on these three,</p>
<p>the other stuff catches up, like it&rsquo;s all involved.</p>
<p>This whole thing is involved.</p>
<p>So if you have an ax, right, the blade of the ax,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s these things, right?</p>
<p>Like you need the pointy end of all your attacks</p>
<p>to be awesome, right?</p>
<p>If you have a super sharp ax, you could have</p>
<p>a shitty handle.</p>
<p>Yeah, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so focus on that, the tip of the ax.</p>
<p>Yeah, the tip of the ax is so important, right?</p>
<p>Like if I have an awesome bicep and I can&rsquo;t quite use it,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it good for, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think a lot of the motions with the wrist</p>
<p>that you mentioned are, just thinking about jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>especially in the gi, there&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so much importance to this,</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t often work it explicitly.</p>
<p>So many of the chokes require ability to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like exactly like arm wrestling.</p>
<p>Very close.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re weak here, what&rsquo;s that called,</p>
<p>flop wrist, and you&rsquo;re strong with the cup, yeah.</p>
<p>And so just getting the, whatever that&rsquo;s involved,</p>
<p>the muscle, the turning, the pressure,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where also the choke comes.</p>
<p>That little, the thing that makes you win in arm wrestling</p>
<p>is also the thing that finishes the person</p>
<p>when you have them grabbed.</p>
<p>The strength is very similar.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating, actually.</p>
<p>Of course, like you said, if you wanna be very good,</p>
<p>you should be doing the very specific exact motion.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if I was gonna do jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like working out with the gi.</p>
<p>Yeah, the problem is, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to construct the exact,</p>
<p>so you have to actually go with people,</p>
<p>and then they don&rsquo;t like being choked on, right?</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s hard to, I&rsquo;m actually a big,</p>
<p>we have these kinds of debates all the time,</p>
<p>is, you know, I&rsquo;m a big believer in drilling.</p>
<p>I love doing something thousands of times.</p>
<p>Like John Donahoe is somebody I mentioned to you about</p>
<p>who, the jiu jitsu folks here,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re less believers in drilling.</p>
<p>They see the value of almost like the mind</p>
<p>of going live and exploring ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that play.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to do the thing a thousand times.</p>
<p>You just need to always be thinking about</p>
<p>the little details that make you better,</p>
<p>and then in action practicing,</p>
<p>like developing the strength, the power,</p>
<p>the explosive of the agility in action.</p>
<p>So actually rolling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, you know, I agree with this,</p>
<p>but I just believe in volume more.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can accomplish it through volume.</p>
<p>You can play a lot.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the, if you really wanna get it good</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re talking about, I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why a lot of these folks are training</p>
<p>three times a day.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing, you know, they&rsquo;re putting in the hours,</p>
<p>eight hours, nine hours, just.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s tough, oh my God.</p>
<p>Well, so there are a lot of them are not going hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just being on the mat.</p>
<p>Some of it is just sitting there talking through ideas,</p>
<p>watching others or teaching, explaining stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not just physical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mental too, because you&rsquo;re keeping in your mind.</p>
<p>And some of the greatest, they talk about the wrestlers</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked with, the fighters, at the top of their career,</p>
<p>they basically, George St. Pierre is like this,</p>
<p>another fellow Canadian, is like,</p>
<p>has stick figures in his head that he can&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like in there, because if you train enough hours,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s just gonna be in your head</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all going to be playing around in your head.</p>
<p>And some little detail over time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like computing or something like that.</p>
<p>And that ends up having a result</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re not physically doing anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always in there.</p>
<p>I do have to return to diet real quick.</p>
<p>I know we talk about pancakes.</p>
<p>Let me, quite seriously, you are one of the,</p>
<p>I mean, strongest athletes in the world for your sport.</p>
<p>So you have to get big, you have to get powerful,</p>
<p>you have to get strong.</p>
<p>What is the right diet for you for that?</p>
<p>Like, what do you eat?</p>
<p>How often do you eat, yeah, from the highest detail</p>
<p>to the smallest, or the things that make you happy</p>
<p>and feel good?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve experimented with every diet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it all, I&rsquo;ve been a vegan, I&rsquo;ve done raw,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve eaten only meat, I&rsquo;ve eaten balanced,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve eaten like a bodybuilder, you know, you name it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve probably tried it, I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s as important in the sport of arm wrestling</p>
<p>as it is perhaps in other sports.</p>
<p>I believe that, I mean, just to be very basic,</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re eating enough food,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably gonna be okay.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just calories.</p>
<p>I mean, really, I mean, not to overcomplicate it,</p>
<p>but I mean, that&rsquo;s where the conversation starts</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re eating enough food.</p>
<p>And it can come in any number of ways,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as important</p>
<p>as a lot of other people do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly irresponsible in a lot,</p>
<p>but the thing is, back to like, volume, right?</p>
<p>Like, you need to, like, if you wanna be</p>
<p>a super heavyweight, it&rsquo;s very different</p>
<p>than if you wanna be a weight category guy.</p>
<p>If you wanna be a weight category guy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that you need to be more responsible,</p>
<p>make better choices.</p>
<p>If you wanna be a super heavyweight, everything.</p>
<p>Just so we&rsquo;re watching a delicious looking omelet,</p>
<p>so eggs, bacon, syrup, so you don&rsquo;t care, carbs.</p>
<p>So in all the things you try, so I mostly eat meat now.</p>
<p>And I landed on that, there&rsquo;s several things,</p>
<p>obviously I&rsquo;m not, but I do a lot of sport.</p>
<p>And I was very surprised how my particular,</p>
<p>very specific body could perform better with only meat.</p>
<p>Why better?</p>
<p>The sports I do, the mind matters.</p>
<p>And so for some reason, my mind&rsquo;s just clear.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think, because it feels unhealthy.</p>
<p>It just makes me feel really good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would recommend it to anybody else.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting that that journey of just exploring</p>
<p>can take you to figure out something about your own self.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things that I heard about</p>
<p>nutrition was, I heard there was a.</p>
<p>Actually, Doritos, I forgot about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I&rsquo;m an idiot.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;d say over the last couple of years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really gone into carbs a lot and high glycemic carbs.</p>
<p>And just to, I feel like it&rsquo;s one of the best things</p>
<p>you can do if you&rsquo;re working out really hard.</p>
<p>Just add carbs, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But, oh, where was I?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve added, syrup is so delicious it&rsquo;s distracting.</p>
<p>No, so you&rsquo;ve added the high glycemic carbs into the mix.</p>
<p>So those help, but that&rsquo;s for mass building.</p>
<p>Right, so there was a study that I heard about</p>
<p>by somebody who was trying to identify heart attacks.</p>
<p>They did this great big study.</p>
<p>And at the end of it, I mean, didn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>what the people ate, the most important thing</p>
<p>was how they felt about the food that they were eating.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you believe in the food,</p>
<p>if you believe that it&rsquo;s gonna do good things for you,</p>
<p>if you allocate it the right way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna have a positive impact.</p>
<p>And I try and do that no matter what it is.</p>
<p>Like I have my foods that I think do certain things.</p>
<p>And so, you know, for me, I know that,</p>
<p>actually, I mean, I learned about corn fed pumps</p>
<p>when I was overseas.</p>
<p>I realized that I never used to eat crap, really didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I ate super clean all the time.</p>
<p>And when I was faced with imminent death more,</p>
<p>I would be like, okay, I&rsquo;m going out tonight,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s have a couple ice cream bars.</p>
<p>You know, like whatever.</p>
<p>And what I realized is if I eat like an entire bag of chips</p>
<p>or like, you know, a bunch of chocolate bars,</p>
<p>and then I go and have a workout,</p>
<p>my workout will be incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be incredible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about easily processed carbohydrates</p>
<p>that will continue to quickly get into your blood</p>
<p>as fast as you can burn it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about that</p>
<p>that will give you incredible blood flow, yeah.</p>
<p>And also your mind plugging in, enjoying that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then believing it works,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how it makes it work better.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel that way.</p>
<p>I think this is really not,</p>
<p>this has been frustrating to me</p>
<p>about the health culture in the United States</p>
<p>in the studies that are done.</p>
<p>You know, you look at like the importance of sleep,</p>
<p>the importance of X diet, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I wish incorporated into that would be</p>
<p>your mental relationship with all of these things.</p>
<p>So for example, people that tell me,</p>
<p>well, your sleep schedule is insane.</p>
<p>Yes, perhaps.</p>
<p>But also, it&rsquo;s insane because I&rsquo;m doing what I love</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t see it as a problem.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really important to understand.</p>
<p>If you sleeping crazy hours</p>
<p>is not affecting your stress</p>
<p>and is actually making you happy</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re drawing some kind of source of happiness</p>
<p>and pleasure and satisfaction,</p>
<p>like being awake when others aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Mike Tyson thing or something,</p>
<p>like training when you&rsquo;ve convinced yourself</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s sleeping and therefore</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re somehow training much better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s powerful even if you look statistically</p>
<p>six hours may be worse than eight hours</p>
<p>or four hours may be worse than six hours.</p>
<p>So the mind is a powerful thing.</p>
<p>Super powerful.</p>
<p>But if you want to be a super heavyweight.</p>
<p>Eat.</p>
<p>You got to eat like stupid amounts all the time, yeah.</p>
<p>You have to test your digestive system.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite meal by the way?</p>
<p>Just if you had to, you know, your last meal.</p>
<p>I am, I do, oh geez, I like so much food, it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d say the food that I rely on a lot</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m getting ready to compete is sushi.</p>
<p>Just because it normally comes in</p>
<p>an all you can eat format, you know.</p>
<p>So I love to go and just binge all you can eat buffets.</p>
<p>Sushi is just super convenient.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If I was a sushi all you can eat buffet place</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be terrified when I saw you.</p>
<p>Have you had barbecue at Texas?</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it, I love it, yeah.</p>
<p>So you, just a small tangent on this.</p>
<p>You faced The Mountain for Bjornsson.</p>
<p>Well first of all you arm wrestled him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to ask, so this is The Mountain</p>
<p>from the Game of Thrones, a strong man,</p>
<p>one of the strongest people in the world,</p>
<p>for a time the strongest person in the world.</p>
<p>What was it like, I know sort of you guys</p>
<p>maybe weren&rsquo;t going 1,000%, but what&rsquo;s it like?</p>
<p>Well he probably wasn&rsquo;t going 1,000%.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But like what, it&rsquo;s interesting to think</p>
<p>what does that strength feel like?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a specialized strength in another sport.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What did it feel like?</p>
<p>What, how strong was he, what are some kind</p>
<p>of deep insights you&rsquo;ve drawn from that battle?</p>
<p>I feel like if we were to go back 1,000 years</p>
<p>and if you give him armor and a two handed sword</p>
<p>he will just rip across the landscape.</p>
<p>And no one will stop him.</p>
<p>So this is the boxing match you came to,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a video of them arm wrestling.</p>
<p>Yeah, what a titan though, what a titan.</p>
<p>A guy like that, tall, strong, fit, disciplined.</p>
<p>I mean he is quite a warrior.</p>
<p>419 pounds?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, he&rsquo;s incredibly impressive.</p>
<p>I really like Hap Thor and I like Eddie Hall too.</p>
<p>And I was just so, I&rsquo;m just so caught up with the drama.</p>
<p>Okay, so Eddie Hall and Hap Thor Bjornsson,</p>
<p>two of the strongest legendary strongmen that we have.</p>
<p>And they were the coolest, they were the top</p>
<p>when strongman was really super cool.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know all the details,</p>
<p>but they legit hit each other.</p>
<p>Like legit.</p>
<p>So I think it kind of stems, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like I say, I&rsquo;m not right there with them,</p>
<p>but Eddie won the World&rsquo;s Strongest Man event</p>
<p>or something one year and the thing is,</p>
<p>one of those victories where Hap Thor</p>
<p>was not accepting of his defeat.</p>
<p>Okay, and there was a little bit of back and forth.</p>
<p>And basically from what I understand,</p>
<p>they were gonna fight the knight</p>
<p>of the World&rsquo;s Strongest Man.</p>
<p>And they kind of got pulled apart</p>
<p>and this heat between them got translated</p>
<p>into a potential boxing match.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very real fight.</p>
<p>So you have the two strongest dudes on the planet</p>
<p>are gonna fight each other.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been like, you know,</p>
<p>because arm wrestling and strongman,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of similar communities.</p>
<p>Who do you got?</p>
<p>If you were giving me financial advice</p>
<p>in the middle of the fight.</p>
<p>I am so bad, I always call it wrong.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very different.</p>
<p>I see Hap Thor as being, you know, more.</p>
<p>Eddie Hall slimming down, is that what you mean as well?</p>
<p>I see Hap Thor as a bit more regimented,</p>
<p>but I see Eddie Hall as like way more barbaric</p>
<p>and like, I think he&rsquo;s a little bit more athletic,</p>
<p>but Hap Thor is bigger and, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve chosen slightly different paths</p>
<p>to prepare for the match.</p>
<p>But what happened was like, they were about to fight</p>
<p>and Eddie Hall blew his bicep.</p>
<p>So me, I was getting ready for Levan in December.</p>
<p>We were supposed to arm wrestle in December,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s got his movie.</p>
<p>And so I was like, okay, I can kind of get away</p>
<p>from the sport just a little bit, broaden my base.</p>
<p>That happened and I was like, ah, an opportunity.</p>
<p>You stepped in.</p>
<p>An opportunity to fight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ll do it, so.</p>
<p>How much training, you trained a little bit,</p>
<p>so can you tell about your own decision to do that?</p>
<p>What was the training like?</p>
<p>What was the experience like?</p>
<p>Oh, it was so much fun.</p>
<p>It was so much fun.</p>
<p>So basically, I made a funny video</p>
<p>and I sent it to the organizers of Core Sports</p>
<p>that I would do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they got a thousand people who wanted to do it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like, listen, I&rsquo;m an old man.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gimped up like everywhere</p>
<p>outside the arm wrestling lanes.</p>
<p>I said, but I will 100%.</p>
<p>Like if you let me fight them, I&rsquo;ll give it my all.</p>
<p>And whatever, they didn&rsquo;t get back to me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, yeah, whatever, okay.</p>
<p>So then they call me on a Friday,</p>
<p>like five weeks before the event,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, hey, Devin, were you serious?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, shit.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yes, I was serious.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, okay, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s down to you and like two other people</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get back to you in a day or two,</p>
<p>but you would do it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>So they got back to me on Sunday, like,</p>
<p>so right away I&rsquo;m like skipping rope.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, and I&rsquo;m so, I only arm wrestle legs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I do.</p>
<p>So what was your, you did some striking training.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I went to this guy that he was awesome,</p>
<p>Zach, Ben Bushida there, that was it from TriStar.</p>
<p>Do you know for us the hobby and that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And yes, people in the comments,</p>
<p>I will interview him on this podcast and people can.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s brilliant, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an incredible guy.</p>
<p>So right away, like I had no idea</p>
<p>about the fight community across Canada really.</p>
<p>And I got like by the fifth message</p>
<p>that said you must train with Feras.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, called him up.</p>
<p>He was incredible right away.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, you can come and we&rsquo;ll just work with you.</p>
<p>So I got, I got the call, I called him on like Monday</p>
<p>at two oclock by like seven oclock.</p>
<p>I had my things packed and I went to Montreal</p>
<p>and I spent four weeks in the fighter dorms.</p>
<p>Just humbling yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, every day, just getting punched in the face,</p>
<p>you know, over and over going for runs with all,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re all like Olympians and pro fighters</p>
<p>living in the dorms, super cool dudes.</p>
<p>They were so good to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a good video of you and Feras just talking.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t remember which stage this was,</p>
<p>but basically, but you were already beginning</p>
<p>to get humbled.</p>
<p>Oh man, I knew.</p>
<p>I mean, I knew what I was getting into.</p>
<p>Like I knew it was, I knew it was gonna be a losing battle,</p>
<p>but I felt like the opportunity to fight Thor,</p>
<p>like how cool is that?</p>
<p>Like I had to say, I had to do it.</p>
<p>I loved the process and I learned a lot from doing it.</p>
<p>Like the dorms, I wanna do something like that</p>
<p>with arm wrestling.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re big enough now that we can have these</p>
<p>kind of, you know, dorms, frat houses,</p>
<p>whatever you wanna call it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the dorm like?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically staying there, food&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So you mentioned, what was the word you used?</p>
<p>Administration.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So it removes all of that.</p>
<p>Makes it so simple.</p>
<p>You can just focus.</p>
<p>You know, the gym is here, you live here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, that your life becomes simple.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a guy named Jimmy Pedro here in America.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a famous coach, has a place up in Boston.</p>
<p>He has kind of a dorm like that too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that becomes essential when the community is small,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re trying to do epic things like win an Olympic gold.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you have to really put the people together</p>
<p>in these kind of minimalist conditions</p>
<p>where they just focus on the training,</p>
<p>focus, focus, focus.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t enough time.</p>
<p>I mean, I trained for about three or four weeks,</p>
<p>but I loved the journey and&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, what are some of the fun things you enjoy?</p>
<p>So you did mostly striking, did you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess it was&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, it was boxing.</p>
<p>It was straight up boxing.</p>
<p>Boxing, yeah.</p>
<p>What are some things that were transferable?</p>
<p>What are some cool things you learned from that?</p>
<p>So from the world of armwrestling,</p>
<p>have you taken anything back?</p>
<p>Like some training regimens, ideas about training,</p>
<p>even movements?</p>
<p>Because for us it&rsquo;s a unique mind as well for training.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve gone very far down the path of armwrestling.</p>
<p>Boxing and armwrestling are very different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very different sports.</p>
<p>The physicality required is very different.</p>
<p>The mentality, I mean, it&rsquo;s fighting.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s another form of fighting, which is cool.</p>
<p>The big things that I took back from it,</p>
<p>the things that I loved about it was I had to run again.</p>
<p>So really work on endurance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was going for runs with guys in the dorms</p>
<p>and they would just destroy me.</p>
<p>Just like it was so bad.</p>
<p>How did you feel in the actual boxing</p>
<p>in terms of endurance?</p>
<p>Were you able to?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just torture.</p>
<p>It was terrible.</p>
<p>And the thing is it was so crazy for me</p>
<p>because I really was good once upon a time.</p>
<p>I really was.</p>
<p>Like physically, I had incredible full body endurance.</p>
<p>But being so specialized, I realized how much I had slipped.</p>
<p>And yeah, it was fun to try and regain it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s affected my body composition.</p>
<p>I think since that training, I&rsquo;ve become much more lean.</p>
<p>I think it was a very healthy thing for me to do.</p>
<p>Like health wise, I always think that when you&rsquo;re far away</p>
<p>from competition, it&rsquo;s really good to kind of spread out.</p>
<p>Really good.</p>
<p>So I think that in that way.</p>
<p>Also for your mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, just like, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s something about clearing your,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve talked about this is like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically taking steps back</p>
<p>before you take steps forward.</p>
<p>I forget how you call it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the wave.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, under, you know, you have to go under.</p>
<p>You got to.</p>
<p>You know, if you want to go above the line,</p>
<p>you have to spend some time beneath it.</p>
<p>And yeah, I was definitely beneath the line</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But Mountain, I mean, like the interesting thing was</p>
<p>as incredible as he is, you know, like what a monster.</p>
<p>And I think if you had had him training in boxing,</p>
<p>you know, for a long time and like from his youth,</p>
<p>I think you, you know, the guy could be world champion,</p>
<p>but you know, to be so specialized and then to switch,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also like I know from just fighting guys in the gym</p>
<p>in TriStar, some of those guys were way scarier, for real.</p>
<p>Like as scary as Thor is, like there&rsquo;s guys</p>
<p>in that TriStar gym that don&rsquo;t look like anything</p>
<p>that would murder me much worse, much worse.</p>
<p>Yeah, but also, you know, that&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between being in the gym and under the lights too.</p>
<p>I mean, GSB is an example, George St. Pierre is an example,</p>
<p>somebody that maybe doesn&rsquo;t look terrifying.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at a TriStar.</p>
<p>Yep, he trains at TriStar, but he&rsquo;s quite,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s super nice, super humble,</p>
<p>but is terrifying when he&rsquo;s fighting.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s dominating people.</p>
<p>You mentioned death and your Canadian special forces</p>
<p>and in general, thinking about mortality.</p>
<p>Do you think about your death?</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you contemplate the end, that this thing,</p>
<p>that this ride ends?</p>
<p>All the time, yeah.</p>
<p>From, I&rsquo;ve thought about death from a young age.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I hate it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t wanna die.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely don&rsquo;t wanna die.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s times when I can rid myself of it, yeah.</p>
<p>But for sure, I mean, I&rsquo;m not happy that death is inevitable</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not happy that potentially it&rsquo;s inevitable</p>
<p>for all of us, but it does, I like to fight against it.</p>
<p>Does it, if you could be immortal, would you choose to?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my only wish.</p>
<p>Oh, see, but here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, but the point is to have that wish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the all you can eat buffet at sushi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, that sushi&rsquo;s more delicious if you have a limit.</p>
<p>Do you have a, oh.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think I get sick of stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very simple.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think I would get tired of it.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, if someone would pose it to you,</p>
<p>do you wanna live forever?</p>
<p>You would choose no?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would choose no.</p>
<p>Choose no.</p>
<p>Well, my answer&rsquo;s probably yes.</p>
<p>Like, no, I would, it&rsquo;s more like the snooze button.</p>
<p>Do you wanna, do you, do you want?</p>
<p>Well, you could go to sleep.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very difficult in the moment to go to sleep,</p>
<p>but if I&rsquo;m allowed to live forever,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to delay all the crazy,</p>
<p>like all the ambitious goals, all the,</p>
<p>because, oh, there&rsquo;s always time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine, but there is tomorrow, then.</p>
<p>But there is tomorrow, but see,</p>
<p>I think that takes away from the richness of,</p>
<p>like, the richness of the lived experience</p>
<p>of just each moment.</p>
<p>I think the richness of each moment</p>
<p>comes from saying, like, I could die tonight.</p>
<p>Like, that, it tastes delicious because you&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid if you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid all of that goes away,</p>
<p>all of that magic goes away if you can live forever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you, every time I have a near death experience</p>
<p>or think I&rsquo;m gonna die,</p>
<p>I definitely live better afterwards, yeah.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s always been that way.</p>
<p>But yeah, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the Stoics, you know,</p>
<p>they really preach contemplating your mortality often.</p>
<p>It kind of reminds you.</p>
<p>This whole thing could just end any moment</p>
<p>and it makes you really appreciate.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Certainly improving the quality of life is important.</p>
<p>But part of me thinks that immortality</p>
<p>is not as fun as we would like to imagine.</p>
<p>Do you think that maybe you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>in what you&rsquo;re building potentially is immortal?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I definitely think about with robots.</p>
<p>If they were to have a humanlike experience</p>
<p>and be able to interact with humans</p>
<p>in a deep, meaningful way,</p>
<p>I think they too have to be mortal</p>
<p>in some fundamental way that means mortal.</p>
<p>Like, their ride has to end as well.</p>
<p>Because they won&rsquo;t be able to interact with humans deeply</p>
<p>unless that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>Like, to have fear, to have love,</p>
<p>the ability to suffer, the ability to miss somebody,</p>
<p>I think scarcity is important.</p>
<p>You have to be able to truly lose somebody.</p>
<p>You have to be, to fear things,</p>
<p>you have to truly have the risk of destroying yourself.</p>
<p>And to have a sense of what it means to be a self,</p>
<p>you have to be able to lose it.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re immortal, you&rsquo;re just going to be,</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re going to be like a toaster,</p>
<p>an intelligent toaster that just serves.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s such a negative perspective on it.</p>
<p>And then mortality?</p>
<p>Yeah, just think, well, now you just,</p>
<p>you can get all those things done that you want to do.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re right, I hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, potentially, you could invest even harder</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like, wow, I&rsquo;m actually going to be able</p>
<p>to get all this stuff done.</p>
<p>I think about this a lot, I hope you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>but I fear that the drive to create,</p>
<p>I can even do more, all of that dissipates,</p>
<p>disappears if you have all the time in the world.</p>
<p>I just know how lazy I am.</p>
<p>And if I have all the time in the world,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to sit there and just watch</p>
<p>the stupidest YouTube videos for the rest of all eternity.</p>
<p>Now, eternity&rsquo;s a long time.</p>
<p>Eat Doritos and Cheetos and just get fatter and fatter.</p>
<p>I can get in shape later, there&rsquo;s always time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a long period of contemplation.</p>
<p>Yeah, so for the first 1,000 years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be the Dorito period of the Lex life.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could be like Jabba the Hutt for 1,000 years.</p>
<p>You mentioned aliens, very important topic.</p>
<p>Do you actually think about this</p>
<p>has been an increased interest,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s been increased UFO sightings and encounters,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, the US government at least</p>
<p>releasing data, releasing videos of pilots,</p>
<p>pilot observations, and from airplanes of UFOs.</p>
<p>Do you think about this kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Because you mentioned in the following context,</p>
<p>you mentioned like us humans will get our shit together</p>
<p>when the aliens eventually come.</p>
<p>What do you make of all the sightings?</p>
<p>Is that something you think about?</p>
<p>I thought about it a lot when I was younger,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve just, I made my conclusions,</p>
<p>and yeah, I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s a possibility</p>
<p>that there aren&rsquo;t aliens.</p>
<p>I would think that it would be impossible</p>
<p>for there not to be aliens.</p>
<p>I feel like this is pretty good real estate,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;d probably want it,</p>
<p>but we already might be, well, I don&rsquo;t even think might.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s probably quite likely</p>
<p>that we are to some degree aliens.</p>
<p>I mean, all life is probably to some degree alien.</p>
<p>I like the real estate, so the resources,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Whatever this ant colony of living organisms</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve created, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting to study.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that the alien civilizations</p>
<p>that are going to reach us or have reached us</p>
<p>are far more intelligent,</p>
<p>just orders of magnitude more intelligent than us,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s going to be very difficult both ways, actually,</p>
<p>for us to understand them and for them</p>
<p>to dumb themselves down enough to understand us.</p>
<p>Yeah, probably.</p>
<p>So they might even just miss our existence altogether</p>
<p>just because I tend to believe,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you think,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not that special</p>
<p>in terms of all the life forms in the universe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of cool stuff out there.</p>
<p>Has to be, has to be.</p>
<p>But to us, we&rsquo;re special.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s all that matters, right?</p>
<p>Even the human species is the most special to us humans.</p>
<p>There could be much more special species here on Earth</p>
<p>they were just totally oblivious to,</p>
<p>like trees on a scale of thousands of years.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re onto something.</p>
<p>Lex, you know,</p>
<p>I think that so much of what makes a person special</p>
<p>is what they pass on, your kids.</p>
<p>But I think that you are quite special</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re part of this thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s potentially giving birth to the next thing.</p>
<p>The robots.</p>
<p>I should say, the funny thing is,</p>
<p>while talking to Devon during this podcast,</p>
<p>I had a doorbell ring, had to go downstairs,</p>
<p>and there was a big box,</p>
<p>medicine box with a new legged robot.</p>
<p>So the hilarity of you saying that is,</p>
<p>because that robot is actually going to likely be</p>
<p>the main robot that I show to the world in the coming months</p>
<p>because that has the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the highest compute level in that robot.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been playing a lot with legged robots,</p>
<p>the four legs, so like a dog.</p>
<p>I like all the robots,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about when a robot has legs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s able to communicate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s able to connect with humans in some kind of deep way,</p>
<p>in the way a dog can, just show affection.</p>
<p>Something about like, step, step, step, step,</p>
<p>and then the robot realizes you&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>and then it steps and then notices you</p>
<p>in the way the dog does and raises its head.</p>
<p>It makes me feel noticed and heard</p>
<p>in the same way I do when a dog notices me.</p>
<p>That excitement, that stupid excitement of like,</p>
<p>yes, fellow living organism.</p>
<p>And what excites me about legged robots</p>
<p>is that holy shit, it&rsquo;s possible to engineer this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to create that feeling,</p>
<p>and I wonder where that can go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of negative possible trajectories,</p>
<p>but I have a sense that there&rsquo;s positive ones too.</p>
<p>Adding more love to the world.</p>
<p>You think that they&rsquo;ll take us with them?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so because I,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s this fear of robots</p>
<p>that they become super intelligent</p>
<p>and run away from us humans,</p>
<p>and basically become so intelligent</p>
<p>and then they almost just not giving a damn will destroy us.</p>
<p>But I think in order for robots to become intelligent,</p>
<p>they have to integrate themselves with society.</p>
<p>So they, by the very nature of how they become intelligent,</p>
<p>have to bring us along.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;ll be this separate thing.</p>
<p>They have to, like, we&rsquo;ll have robots in the home.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ll be interacting with us.</p>
<p>You have human kids, and you have a bunch of robots.</p>
<p>You have robot friends.</p>
<p>You have human friends,</p>
<p>and the robots make your human to human relationships</p>
<p>much more meaningful and richer.</p>
<p>They bring more love to the world, but it&rsquo;s integrated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;ll be developing smarter and smarter</p>
<p>as, like, sentient beings by themselves.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very difficult to do.</p>
<p>You have to be doing that together with humans,</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;ll come for the ride.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s technical things, like,</p>
<p>we might merge, like, cyborgs more and more.</p>
<p>Well, we already saw our cyborgs, right?</p>
<p>With the phones and so on, but more and more.</p>
<p>So with Elon and Neuralink, deeper integration of robots</p>
<p>and AI into, like, increasing the bandwidth</p>
<p>at which they can communicate.</p>
<p>So if we do implants in the brain,</p>
<p>I think, again, a lot of people are really nervous</p>
<p>about this, as am I, but I think there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of trajectories that are positive there.</p>
<p>That, to me, is exciting, and also,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to stop this development,</p>
<p>so we should steer it.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>For good.</p>
<p>Did you, I mean, you must have watched</p>
<p>the movie Terminator, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, I love Terminator.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s probably my favorite movie of all time.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s the big fear, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s the conclusion with Terminator?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t ultimately humanity wins?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re at, like, Terminator 8 now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s interesting, actually,</p>
<p>I was gonna bring this up as you were talking about it,</p>
<p>but China and the United States actually don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where Canada is on this, but they both have agreed</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not going to put limits</p>
<p>on autonomous weapon system development.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to.</p>
<p>So, because China said we&rsquo;re not going to,</p>
<p>and now US officially announced that we&rsquo;re not, we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s like, you never could, right?</p>
<p>As soon as it exists and it&rsquo;s better, people will use it.</p>
<p>Well, but you, there&rsquo;s been a global ban on bioweapons.</p>
<p>So, you were able to come to an agreement there</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not going to use biological weapons in war.</p>
<p>So, it was, a lot of people are really upset</p>
<p>that in the case of AI driven weapons,</p>
<p>the world said, nope, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And so, now you have this potential</p>
<p>for greater and greater automation in drones,</p>
<p>for example, in picking bombing locations.</p>
<p>And so, the area at which they attack.</p>
<p>And so, you get, some of that stuff that you mentioned</p>
<p>that drew you to the military is that teamwork</p>
<p>between humans, that decision making.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s strategy, but built into that team</p>
<p>is a deep humanity.</p>
<p>Like, even when there&rsquo;s an enemy, there&rsquo;s lines</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re aware of, of what is ethical, what is not,</p>
<p>what is just and what is not.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so easy for a machine to miss all of that,</p>
<p>plow through it and do deeply inhumane acts,</p>
<p>commit atrocities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that worries a lot of people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because, yeah, an AI based war is just, it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>Especially with cyber security, which is becoming</p>
<p>more and more of an issue, which is hacking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sort of people that look a lot like me</p>
<p>being the warriors of the future.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is meaning people behind a keyboard</p>
<p>versus the traditional warriors.</p>
<p>Probably inevitable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And terrifying.</p>
<p>It is, it is.</p>
<p>But I think if you believe that it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly gonna happen.</p>
<p>Like, at some point, it&rsquo;s just when, right?</p>
<p>When does it happen?</p>
<p>So that, I mean, to me, I&rsquo;m ultimately optimistic</p>
<p>about the future.</p>
<p>And to me, I&rsquo;m excited about the world with AI.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m even excited about the metaverse</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things, living more and more</p>
<p>in the digital space, in the virtual reality.</p>
<p>I think, so it&rsquo;s a part of me that grew up</p>
<p>in the noninternet world, noncomputer world.</p>
<p>It says, oh, kids these days with their video games.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s part of me that&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>But I think technology at its best</p>
<p>can bring out the best of humanity.</p>
<p>And so I think virtual reality, all of these things,</p>
<p>over time, we&rsquo;ll figure out how to fix it</p>
<p>to bring out the humanity.</p>
<p>Social networks, the first generation social networks,</p>
<p>now Facebook, Twitter, and so on,</p>
<p>they have so many problems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re bringing out the worst in people.</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;re learning from that.</p>
<p>And I think the next generation of social networks</p>
<p>will be better and better and better.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m optimistic.</p>
<p>But of course, one reason we may have not seen aliens yet,</p>
<p>obviously, like in a way that&rsquo;s obvious,</p>
<p>is because once you get clever and smart</p>
<p>and have all this cool technology, you destroy yourself.</p>
<p>And we sure as humans are pretty close to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, there might be that limit</p>
<p>that is hard to get right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping we get all our aggression between nations</p>
<p>out through arm wrestling competition.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Just all of that life.</p>
<p>Oh my God, wouldn&rsquo;t that be great</p>
<p>if it was that simple, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you know if there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>over the top type movie to be made?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, there&rsquo;s always stuff in the works.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a, there&rsquo;s a tournament called</p>
<p>Over the Top in Australia that&rsquo;s a couple months away.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re doing an all the over the top scene.</p>
<p>But there are arm wrestling movies</p>
<p>that are being made right now.</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s a documentary that&rsquo;s filming me</p>
<p>for this whole Levan thing.</p>
<p>But yeah, we&rsquo;re probably due for another big one, yeah.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also, just with your YouTube channel,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a lot for the sport.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really cool to see.</p>
<p>Just being genuine, but just being like,</p>
<p>looking not like you&rsquo;re looking today, but just like.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Just a beard.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, normally a mess.</p>
<p>Just like sleepy.</p>
<p>You know, and just putting yourself out there</p>
<p>completely as you are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>The best thing about the sport</p>
<p>is it brings people together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the community, the folks I got to interact with,</p>
<p>just so awesome, so excited, so full of kindness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely gonna find the club here</p>
<p>and start working on my arm wrestling game.</p>
<p>Devin, this is such a huge honor</p>
<p>that you would spend your valuable time.</p>
<p>You would come down to Austin.</p>
<p>You would hang out with me and do this conversation.</p>
<p>Super cool to talk to you, Lex, yeah.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, in case people,</p>
<p>you know, people I&rsquo;m sure will tell me.</p>
<p>So I hang out with Joe Rogan all the time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a friend.</p>
<p>I told him that he should talk to Devin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going through some stuff currently, you know.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure, I hope the conversation</p>
<p>between you, Devin, and Joe happens eventually.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, that would be epic as well,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a, yeah, he loves fighting.</p>
<p>He loves fighting, he loves wrestling, he loves strength.</p>
<p>And I think all of those are, like,</p>
<p>so perfectly encapsulated in the sport of arm wrestling.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thanks so much, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Devin Larratt.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Miyamoto Musashi.</p>
<p>The only reason a warrior is alive is to fight.</p>
<p>And the only reason a warrior fights is to win.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
