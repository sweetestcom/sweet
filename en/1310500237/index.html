    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Carl Hart,</p>
<p>department chair and professor of psychology</p>
<p>at Columbia University.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author of several books on the topic of drugs,</p>
<p>including his most recent, called Drug Use for Grownups,</p>
<p>that challenges us to, quote,</p>
<p>use empirical evidence to guide public policy</p>
<p>even if it makes us uncomfortable.</p>
<p>His research on drugs, including hard drugs,</p>
<p>like heroin and cocaine, challenges much of what we think</p>
<p>we know about drugs and their role in society.</p>
<p>His main thesis is that drug addiction</p>
<p>has less to do with the drugs themselves</p>
<p>and more to do with cooccurring psychiatric disorders,</p>
<p>such as depression and schizophrenia,</p>
<p>and socioeconomic factors, such as unemployment,</p>
<p>underemployment, and resource deprivation</p>
<p>within the community.</p>
<p>In addition, he believes that we should legalize all drugs</p>
<p>so that if people choose to use them,</p>
<p>they could do so responsibly and openly</p>
<p>and get help if needed in a controlled, safe environment.</p>
<p>His ideas are controversial,</p>
<p>but are fundamentally grounded in empirical data</p>
<p>and rigorous scientific studies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if his conclusions are right,</p>
<p>but they are at least worth thinking about.</p>
<p>So I ask that you consider these ideas with an open mind</p>
<p>and as always, make sure you exercise</p>
<p>your critical thinking skills in making decisions</p>
<p>about substances you put in your body.</p>
<p>You are a free thinking being,</p>
<p>the main character, if you will,</p>
<p>the hero in a story that&rsquo;s being written by you.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day,</p>
<p>you are responsible for the choices you make.</p>
<p>So choose wisely.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Carl Hart.</p>
<p>I think it is bold and powerful to admit</p>
<p>to using in your private life</p>
<p>the drugs that you study in your research,</p>
<p>including heroin and cocaine.</p>
<p>So let me ask, what is the experience of taking heroin like?</p>
<p>What happens to the body?</p>
<p>What happens to the mind when you take it?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I take MDMA, cannabis,</p>
<p>and all the rest of these drugs too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried those drugs.</p>
<p>The experience in the body and the mind,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what people wanna know</p>
<p>in that regard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying, what is the experience</p>
<p>of having an orgasm in the body and the mind?</p>
<p>Or some other sort of event that you really enjoy.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really know what people&hellip;</p>
<p>Is that what poetry is for,</p>
<p>for describing these kinds of experiences?</p>
<p>I mean, I guess, given MDMA, given psilocybin,</p>
<p>in the full context of that,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s more useful to say,</p>
<p>what are the differences in experiences</p>
<p>that your mind goes through?</p>
<p>Like chemically, biologically.</p>
<p>So like keeping it strictly to sort of the biology of it</p>
<p>versus the full environmental human experience.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, this is a mistake that people make all the time.</p>
<p>They try to act as if biology</p>
<p>is the only determinant of drug effects.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just not how it works.</p>
<p>You need the environment.</p>
<p>You need the cage, as they say.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the cage,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get the full extent of the effects.</p>
<p>And so like you can take MDMA and have an awful time.</p>
<p>You can have a time in which you get paranoid and so forth.</p>
<p>And then you can take that drug under the right conditions</p>
<p>and it just be like one of the best moments you&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>It certainly enhanced a number of my relationships.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve also had some times with MDMA</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t been so lovely.</p>
<p>When the people who you are hanging out with,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know them, you&rsquo;re distrustful</p>
<p>and all of those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to put context in it.</p>
<p>Now we can talk about drugs at a biochemical level,</p>
<p>at a biological level.</p>
<p>And we kind of do that in this country</p>
<p>with this fascination with neuroscience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an inappropriate kind of fascination</p>
<p>in the way we talk about it.</p>
<p>So we can talk about opioids</p>
<p>and then we can talk about endogenous opioid system</p>
<p>in the brain.</p>
<p>We can talk about dopamine</p>
<p>and other sort of monoamine transmitters</p>
<p>and what opioids are doing to them.</p>
<p>And we can do the same thing with MDMA.</p>
<p>And we won&rsquo;t be any closer to understanding</p>
<p>the sort of experience that is induced by these drugs.</p>
<p>Certainly the experience that we all seek.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>So getting a positive experience</p>
<p>or getting a negative experience</p>
<p>is strongly defined by the environment.</p>
<p>Strongly dependent upon it.</p>
<p>But the environment is a very,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a short word that can describe a lot of things.</p>
<p>So would you say the environment is important</p>
<p>or the people where you are currently in your life?</p>
<p>Or is it also dependent on the full trajectory</p>
<p>of your psychology of your life experiences</p>
<p>of your parents or the people you came up with</p>
<p>of the trauma you&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>of the hopes and dreams that were crushed</p>
<p>or not or the opposite or the success levels</p>
<p>or all those things.</p>
<p>Like what are the interesting sort of landscape</p>
<p>of experiences that contribute to how you actually feel</p>
<p>when you take a drug?</p>
<p>Right on.</p>
<p>So all of those things are important.</p>
<p>But you know, like if someone had trauma in childhood</p>
<p>and they did the work and they dealt with it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not so important in this case.</p>
<p>But if they didn&rsquo;t deal with it</p>
<p>and that trauma is being triggered in that event</p>
<p>in that moment, then it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just take somebody like me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 54 years old.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be 55 this month actually.</p>
<p>And you know, I&rsquo;ve done a lot of work</p>
<p>in terms of figuring out who I am</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m comfortable with myself.</p>
<p>And I know how to set limits for whatever it is I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>And so I know I need to work out.</p>
<p>I know I need to eat well.</p>
<p>I know I need to sleep well.</p>
<p>I know I need to be in an environment</p>
<p>with people within my trust.</p>
<p>And then if all of those things are met,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s likely to be a good time.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>But if I haven&rsquo;t slept, if I haven&rsquo;t worked out,</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t feel good, it won&rsquo;t be a good time.</p>
<p>But I try and be responsible</p>
<p>and take care of my eating habits, sleeping habits,</p>
<p>make sure my responsibilities are taken care of.</p>
<p>And so when I&rsquo;m in that moment, I just enjoy that moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking about a bill that I didn&rsquo;t pay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking about, oh, I forgot to do this for my kid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking about that</p>
<p>because all of those things are taken care of.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not taken care of, it will impact the experience</p>
<p>and it may negatively impact the experience.</p>
<p>Well, that is the counterintuitive,</p>
<p>even controversial finding from your recent book.</p>
<p>So we should kind of, I know it seems obvious to you,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of people hearing this</p>
<p>would think it&rsquo;s quite non obvious.</p>
<p>So in your new book, Drug Use for Grownups,</p>
<p>you write for the finding section.</p>
<p>I discovered that the predominant effects produced</p>
<p>by the drugs discussed in this book are positive.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter whether the drug in question was cannabis,</p>
<p>cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, or psilocybin.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, consumers expressed feeling more altruistic,</p>
<p>empathetic, euphoric, focused, grateful, and tranquil.</p>
<p>They also experienced enhanced social interactions,</p>
<p>a great sense of purpose and meaning,</p>
<p>and increased sexual intimacy and performance.</p>
<p>This constellation of findings</p>
<p>challenged my original beliefs about drugs and their effects.</p>
<p>I had been indoctrinated to be biased</p>
<p>toward the negative effects of drug use.</p>
<p>But over the past two plus decades,</p>
<p>I had gained a deeper, more nuanced understanding.</p>
<p>These words are very counterintuitive to a lot of people.</p>
<p>I think like you also mentioned in the book and elsewhere,</p>
<p>people have come around to maybe psilocybin</p>
<p>being one such drug, maybe cannabis being one such drug,</p>
<p>but you also mentioned other drugs</p>
<p>like cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine.</p>
<p>Can you just linger on this point?</p>
<p>How do we get the positive effects of those drugs</p>
<p>and why in the media,</p>
<p>and the general conception we have of these drugs</p>
<p>is that they were going to make a bad life worse</p>
<p>or ruin a good life?</p>
<p>Well, so your first question was,</p>
<p>how do we harness the positive effects?</p>
<p>How do we increase the likelihood</p>
<p>of getting the positive effects?</p>
<p>Again, like I said,</p>
<p>we wanna make sure that people are responsible</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve handled their responsibilities,</p>
<p>make sure they eat well, sleep well, exercise,</p>
<p>all of those sorts of things play an important role.</p>
<p>And also if they know exactly what they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re not paranoid about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something contaminated in some adulterant in my drug.</p>
<p>So you wanna make sure you know exactly what you have.</p>
<p>Once you satisfy those kinds of things,</p>
<p>you understand the dose and potency,</p>
<p>you understand all of those things</p>
<p>to decrease any sort of anxiety you might have</p>
<p>about the substance itself, it increases the likelihood</p>
<p>that you will have a better time.</p>
<p>So anxiety is a big one, you need to remove the anxiety.</p>
<p>Anxiety is critical, it&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>Many of the negative effects that we see with drugs</p>
<p>have to do with anxiety</p>
<p>and not necessarily anxiety because a drug induced it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the anxiety that the situation induced a lot of times.</p>
<p>And then you ask like,</p>
<p>well, why does this sound counterintuitive?</p>
<p>Why does the media report differently?</p>
<p>Well, because there&rsquo;s money in reporting</p>
<p>the negative effects almost exclusively.</p>
<p>Think about writing a newspaper article.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really easy to get the population all ginned up</p>
<p>about something like an opioid crisis, overdoses,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even have to tell people</p>
<p>how to keep people safe if you&rsquo;re talking about overdose.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to say why people are dying</p>
<p>from overdoses.</p>
<p>Like overdoses in our country happen largely</p>
<p>because people get contaminated drugs,</p>
<p>because people are combining sedatives</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know that this enhances</p>
<p>the respiratory depressing effects of drugs.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But when you read these newspaper articles,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t say this.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t say how to keep people safe.</p>
<p>All they do is frighten the population.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s money in that.</p>
<p>And then we think about people who write TV shows,</p>
<p>the people who write movies.</p>
<p>Most of the stuff written about drugs is just bullshit.</p>
<p>I think about, I love going to watch comedians</p>
<p>and the comedians when they talk about drugs,</p>
<p>again, most of the things that they say about drugs</p>
<p>is bullshit.</p>
<p>I mean, you can say the stupidest things about drugs</p>
<p>and be believed.</p>
<p>You can write a movie and you don&rsquo;t even have</p>
<p>to develop your characters.</p>
<p>If you throw drugs into the mix, you say,</p>
<p>oh, he&rsquo;s a drug dealer.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to say anything</p>
<p>about that person&rsquo;s background</p>
<p>or about that person being developed as a character</p>
<p>because the population think they know.</p>
<p>And the writer is lazy</p>
<p>and does not do any sort of development.</p>
<p>Just think about any more.</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s think about the Sopranos, for example.</p>
<p>They have a new program coming out.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about them for a second.</p>
<p>The Sopranos is a show in which the lead character,</p>
<p>Tony, kills people for a living.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he does, right?</p>
<p>This character actually made a sympathetic for him</p>
<p>when he is besmirching and denigrating his nephew,</p>
<p>Christopher, for using a drug.</p>
<p>And we feel sympathy for Tony, the character,</p>
<p>who just killed somebody, who is a horrible person,</p>
<p>but being a drug user is a worse person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the show wants us to believe.</p>
<p>Tony&rsquo;s a racist, murderer, all of these things,</p>
<p>but we feel sympathy for him.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t feel sympathy for anyone who uses drugs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some crazy shit.</p>
<p>I mean, and the American public buys into it.</p>
<p>That is, that&rsquo;s wild to me,</p>
<p>and that we all bought into this crap.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we do in damn near everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in film, on television.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s wrong with you people?</p>
<p>So why aren&rsquo;t there not more stories</p>
<p>of grownups using drugs?</p>
<p>The full spectrum of drugs that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p>So we talked offline about Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s somebody who started smoking weed later in life,</p>
<p>which is an interesting story.</p>
<p>Like when he&rsquo;s already very successful</p>
<p>and he has a very interesting way</p>
<p>of describing his experience with weed,</p>
<p>that it was like enhancing just productivity.</p>
<p>It actually, I think he says,</p>
<p>like it increases anxiety a little bit</p>
<p>in a way that was productive, like paranoia, not anxiety.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an interesting story of an adult</p>
<p>talking about the use of weed for productivity purposes.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t get those stories very often.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I think fear.</p>
<p>People are afraid that they will be belittled, dismissed,</p>
<p>all of these things, that&rsquo;s a drug addict</p>
<p>or some negative thing, but cannabis is lightweight.</p>
<p>Come on, you can admit cannabis these days.</p>
<p>And the fact that I don&rsquo;t know when Joe started,</p>
<p>but if he did start later in life, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>I mean, you are mature, developed,</p>
<p>you have developed some responsibility skills,</p>
<p>all of these kinds of things.</p>
<p>This is a good thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want people to engage in any kind of behaviors</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re young and immature</p>
<p>that might put them in harm&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>And so we want people to be developed at least.</p>
<p>I mean, whether it&rsquo;s being in a relationship with a partner</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s driving an automobile,</p>
<p>all of these things that can be potentially harmful,</p>
<p>but extremely beneficial</p>
<p>if you are responsible enough to handle them.</p>
<p>You want people to be mature, so that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>So how are you supposed to, like somebody like me,</p>
<p>somebody like Joe, how are you supposed to understand</p>
<p>what the dangers are, what the negative effects are?</p>
<p>So you said automobile, relationships.</p>
<p>I think I have a reasonably, it&rsquo;s crappy,</p>
<p>but reasonable understanding of all the troubles</p>
<p>I can get with in relationships and what things to avoid.</p>
<p>Same thing with driving a car.</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the dark in terms of what are the things</p>
<p>to be careful about, what to avoid with drug use</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about the heavy drugs.</p>
<p>Have you ever drank alcohol?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s drug use.</p>
<p>I know, I drank a lot.</p>
<p>But I understand that because culturally I came up,</p>
<p>I was taught a lot of like, this is what you don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>and this is what you do.</p>
<p>This is when you drink a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, you see the effects, you see the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of negative examples,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s positive examples of social stimulant.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s examples of great artists using alcohol</p>
<p>to sort of, I don&rsquo;t know, to help be the catalyst</p>
<p>for that magic moment, for all of that.</p>
<p>I have some examples now, especially in America,</p>
<p>the same with weed, more and more you&rsquo;re starting</p>
<p>to get a lot of stories of psychedelics of different kinds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s psilocybin where you have mushrooms</p>
<p>or even MDMA used sort of positively.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of like negative stories from the past</p>
<p>about acid, about LSD being used,</p>
<p>ultimately for productive ends,</p>
<p>but it destroyed the person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of how the story goes.</p>
<p>It was like a trade off.</p>
<p>You take, it&rsquo;s like, what is it?</p>
<p>Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil to learn guitar.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a trade off.</p>
<p>You can take the drug, you&rsquo;re gonna create some good stuff,</p>
<p>but you have to pay for it.</p>
<p>Those are the stories.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some bullshit we tell children, come on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>These fairy tales, these cautionary tales</p>
<p>that we tell people, we have to grow up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the book is about, drug use for grownups.</p>
<p>We tell people, Pinocchio, if you lie, your nose grow.</p>
<p>Who believes that?</p>
<p>Who believes that there are fairy tales?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s exactly what these stories are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the same vein as those kind of stories,</p>
<p>as Pinocchio.</p>
<p>Like you said, when you were learning about alcohol,</p>
<p>you were told what to do, what not to do, so forth.</p>
<p>The same can be true with MDMA, with cocaine, with heroin.</p>
<p>The same is true, because there are some times</p>
<p>when there are some potential dangers that you should avoid.</p>
<p>And I wrote about some of them,</p>
<p>certainly in my work, just throughout all of my writings.</p>
<p>I talk about those kinds of things</p>
<p>and other people talk about these things.</p>
<p>The problem is, is that we&rsquo;re getting our education</p>
<p>from bullshit sources, from people who believe</p>
<p>in this kind of Pinocchio thing.</p>
<p>And it just does not fit with the evidence.</p>
<p>And the evidence we all publish in the scientific literature,</p>
<p>all these things that I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there in the literature.</p>
<p>I mean, at a place like Columbia,</p>
<p>we give these drugs thousands of doses every year.</p>
<p>Do you think we would be doing this?</p>
<p>And we do this with research grants</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funded by the public, taxpayers dollars.</p>
<p>Do you think we would be allowed to do this</p>
<p>if these drugs were so dangerous?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just nonsense.</p>
<p>I mean, and the drugs we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>they are all approved for medical use</p>
<p>somewhere in the world.</p>
<p>And the studies you conduct are basically</p>
<p>asking what kinds of questions.</p>
<p>So you take the full range of drugs you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>from marijuana to psilocybin to MDMA to cocaine and heroin.</p>
<p>What is the study looking at?</p>
<p>Like what the actual experience with the positive</p>
<p>and negative effects of the experience on the drug are</p>
<p>in the control conditions.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we did these kinds of experiments with alcohol,</p>
<p>nicotine, all these drugs in order to have</p>
<p>an empirical database to tell people</p>
<p>exactly what these drugs do and what they don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>The conditions under which the drugs</p>
<p>will produce positive effects,</p>
<p>the conditions under which the drugs were more likely</p>
<p>to produce negative effects.</p>
<p>All of this information is important for society to know.</p>
<p>And we do know, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re collecting the data.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re collecting the data to help us with treatment</p>
<p>if someone is having problems with these data.</p>
<p>Hopefully we&rsquo;ll understand more about how to help them</p>
<p>deal with their problems based on some of the research</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So what kind of negative effects are we looking out for?</p>
<p>Like what are the properties of drugs</p>
<p>we should be careful about?</p>
<p>Is it addictive properties?</p>
<p>How addictive it is, how destructive or painful,</p>
<p>whatever the withdrawal processes,</p>
<p>what kind of things are we looking out for?</p>
<p>Yeah, those are certain kind of questions</p>
<p>we certainly have asked because like something like</p>
<p>crack cocaine versus alcohol or heroin</p>
<p>when it comes to withdrawal of physical dependence.</p>
<p>Like cocaine has a very limited sort of withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to see.</p>
<p>Same is true with methamphetamine.</p>
<p>But with heroin, you certainly can see a withdrawal syndrome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unpleasant, but with alcohol that withdrawal</p>
<p>can actually kill you.</p>
<p>So heroin is unpleasant and not lovely,</p>
<p>but with alcohol withdrawal, that&rsquo;s the one,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most dangerous.</p>
<p>I mean, all of these kind of questions</p>
<p>we wanna know answers to.</p>
<p>And so when we think about heroin or some other drugs</p>
<p>and you say like, what kind of negative effects?</p>
<p>Negative effects, we don&rsquo;t talk about much in the society.</p>
<p>The main thing that really concerns me</p>
<p>about like heroin use really is constipation.</p>
<p>So if people are using heroin on a regular basis</p>
<p>and then they have a sort of slowing of their gut modality,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re likely to increase constipation and that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>I mean, for your general health,</p>
<p>but we never talk about that in this society.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably the most important thing</p>
<p>aside from the fact that people get contaminated street drugs</p>
<p>and that sort of stuff and increase the likelihood</p>
<p>of maybe dying from some contaminant</p>
<p>or people who are inexperienced</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re mixing heroin with other sedatives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not good, but the constipation is a huge one.</p>
<p>And then other sort of drugs, negative effects</p>
<p>like the amphetamines, all of the amphetamines,</p>
<p>they disrupt sleep, food intake,</p>
<p>all of these things are so critical</p>
<p>for sustaining human life, but we never talk about that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not as sexy as this nonsense</p>
<p>that people write about like addiction.</p>
<p>Addiction has almost nothing to do</p>
<p>with the drugs themselves.</p>
<p>And I make that comment because the vast majority of users</p>
<p>for any drug never become addicted.</p>
<p>And so if the vast majority of users don&rsquo;t become addicted,</p>
<p>then you have to move beyond the drug</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about the phenomenon interest</p>
<p>in this case, addiction.</p>
<p>And so when we think about addiction,</p>
<p>it has much more to do with our psychosocial environment</p>
<p>than the drug itself, but that&rsquo;s not sexy.</p>
<p>So addiction is even the property of the environment,</p>
<p>not a property, a result of the environment.</p>
<p>It certainly can be.</p>
<p>There are people who are suffering</p>
<p>from cooccurring mental illness like depression, anxiety.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s within the person, of course,</p>
<p>and that increases the likelihood for addiction.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not so much the environment,</p>
<p>but there are people who, for example,</p>
<p>they have chronic unrealistic expectations heaped on them.</p>
<p>And those people are more likely</p>
<p>to have some problems with drugs.</p>
<p>There are people who are just immature,</p>
<p>not having developed responsibility skills.</p>
<p>They are likely to have some problems</p>
<p>if they engage in some of these behaviors.</p>
<p>There are people who lost their jobs, COVID,</p>
<p>factories went away, a wide range of things.</p>
<p>And those people used to have standing in their community.</p>
<p>Now they have none.</p>
<p>Those people might be susceptible</p>
<p>to having a drug related problem if they indulge.</p>
<p>All of these kinds of issues are far more important</p>
<p>than the drug itself.</p>
<p>And so they could seek escape in a particular drug.</p>
<p>I mean, there is a biochemical thing</p>
<p>to each of these drugs,</p>
<p>and some pull you in harder than others</p>
<p>when you need the escape, right?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re not doing well in life.</p>
<p>What evidence you have for that bullshit?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, because there is none.</p>
<p>There is absolutely none.</p>
<p>I mean, people say stuff like that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s precisely the problem.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m operating from limited personal evidence.</p>
<p>Well, this is a problem though,</p>
<p>but we have a scientific database.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need personal evidence for this.</p>
<p>We have, in my book, I try to go through some of the science</p>
<p>so people could understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you have a math problem,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want people saying,</p>
<p>well, you know, I feel like this.</p>
<p>Fuck what you feel.</p>
<p>What does the data say?</p>
<p>So one of the problems with the data,</p>
<p>so one data is there&rsquo;s the studies that you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>this is excellent research work,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some of the drugs that are illegal.</p>
<p>Yes. And some are legal.</p>
<p>So you have just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unfortunate that some of the drugs are illegal</p>
<p>or whatever you believe,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not enough of a data set of public</p>
<p>and the open use.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like you got in the wild data set.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be nice to do, you know, thousands of people</p>
<p>and see from all the different kinds of environments</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff to get an understanding.</p>
<p>I think we have a substantial database,</p>
<p>but people just ignore it.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>That said, let me ask you the question of legalization.</p>
<p>So should, in your view, all drugs be legalized?</p>
<p>The drugs that people seek</p>
<p>certainly should be legally regulated</p>
<p>and available to adults.</p>
<p>So when I say the drugs people seek,</p>
<p>like cannabis, MDMA, cocaine, heroin,</p>
<p>those drugs certainly should be available.</p>
<p>And some of the psychedelics that people seek.</p>
<p>Now, the thing about it is that some people think that,</p>
<p>oh, it will be a free fall.</p>
<p>These drugs are available to everyone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>I mean, there will be age requirements</p>
<p>and maybe other requirements,</p>
<p>but they should be available.</p>
<p>And we should also do like what we do with alcohol.</p>
<p>We can put enough alcohol in a bottle to kill you,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So we regulate it such that the amount that&rsquo;s in the bottle</p>
<p>enhances the safety and minimizes the potential harms.</p>
<p>We can do the same thing with these other drugs.</p>
<p>And we can also say, okay,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t be selling intravenous preparations</p>
<p>of any of these drugs.</p>
<p>The drugs that the routes of administration will be oral</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know, let&rsquo;s say intranasal.</p>
<p>Again, routes of administration,</p>
<p>the dose that you have in each unit,</p>
<p>all can minimize harm based on how you do these things.</p>
<p>And we can do that.</p>
<p>We have the technology, we have the knowhow.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually making me think</p>
<p>about alcohol a little bit.</p>
<p>So if I were, say the drugs become legalized</p>
<p>in the way you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>and me, Lex, wanted to, as an adult,</p>
<p>explore some of these drugs,</p>
<p>what are some procedures do you think</p>
<p>for sort of safe, positive exploration of those drugs?</p>
<p>The reason I say I&rsquo;m thinking about alcohol</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>besides not putting enough alcohol in a bottle to kill you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone ever gave me specific instructions.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of word of mouth</p>
<p>and examples of people doing the wrong thing.</p>
<p>You kind of get it through osmosis that way.</p>
<p>Is that basically what we would do,</p>
<p>this kind of free exploration of use?</p>
<p>No, we have to change our education about these things.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s just take a drug like cocaine.</p>
<p>Cocaine&rsquo;s a stimulant.</p>
<p>You want to make sure people understand</p>
<p>that they shouldn&rsquo;t be taking cocaine near bedtime.</p>
<p>You know, they need to get a certain amount of hours of sleep</p>
<p>and they need to get up in the morning.</p>
<p>Cocaine probably isn&rsquo;t a drug for you at night.</p>
<p>Certainly not.</p>
<p>Certainly not amphetamines at night for most people.</p>
<p>And also, if you want to make sure that you,</p>
<p>they need to understand that cocaine</p>
<p>can also disrupt your food intake.</p>
<p>Not as much as the amphetamines,</p>
<p>but all of these kinds of things people need to know</p>
<p>so they can have proper nutrition</p>
<p>and they can time their drug use</p>
<p>around these other important functions</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the same human life.</p>
<p>So we have to make sure that we educate people.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just throw people in a while.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>I gotta tell you, I mean, for me,</p>
<p>and even given your book and for people listening to this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still tough to hear that the thing</p>
<p>we should be concerned about with cocaine</p>
<p>is the same as with caffeine.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take it before bed.</p>
<p>And the thing we should be concerned with heroin</p>
<p>is constipation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But the questions I keep wanting to ask you,</p>
<p>I should be asking the same things of alcohol,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re not doing well psychologically</p>
<p>in the ways you describe,</p>
<p>when the environment is not right,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some aspect in which saying that drugs</p>
<p>can be used responsibly and effectively</p>
<p>and mostly positive can give those folks a pass</p>
<p>to use it instead of working on themselves</p>
<p>and fixing their environment first.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, what do you want me to say to that?</p>
<p>I mean, they have access to alcohol,</p>
<p>they have access to the&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, we live in this country called the United States</p>
<p>where our Declaration of Independence says</p>
<p>that we are free to live like we wanna live</p>
<p>so long as we don&rsquo;t disrupt other people</p>
<p>from doing the same.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s remarkable to me</p>
<p>how we try to control the behaviors of other people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just remarkable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s partially what your book is about.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not just about drugs, it&rsquo;s about freedom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bigger issue that we can&rsquo;t get to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this issue of freedom</p>
<p>and freedom comes with a tremendous amount</p>
<p>of responsibility.</p>
<p>I am responsible for my neighbors, my brothers.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t impede their freedoms.</p>
<p>Like some people think that their freedom</p>
<p>supersedes everybody else&rsquo;s freedoms.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to remind people in this book.</p>
<p>I am responsible to you as a citizen</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>And I tried to make that point in the book</p>
<p>and people have conveniently ignored things like that.</p>
<p>Do you think the war on drugs</p>
<p>has done more positive or negative for the world?</p>
<p>Depends on which world you live in.</p>
<p>The war on drugs has been hugely beneficial</p>
<p>to law enforcement, to the media,</p>
<p>to people who make bullshit TV shows.</p>
<p>The Sopranos, The Wire, all of those shows,</p>
<p>they benefit from this kind of nonsense.</p>
<p>Who else have benefited?</p>
<p>People who provide treatment,</p>
<p>many of them benefit from the war on drugs.</p>
<p>The folks who do urine testing for drugs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve all benefited.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making mad money.</p>
<p>People who run prisons,</p>
<p>the phone companies who charge the prisoners,</p>
<p>the people who run the hotels that are around the prisons</p>
<p>where people&rsquo;s family have to come and stay,</p>
<p>the restaurants, they are making out like bandits.</p>
<p>But many of us are getting screwed as a society.</p>
<p>In general, we&rsquo;re getting screwed,</p>
<p>but there are people who are just benefiting handsomely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it continues.</p>
<p>Politicians benefit.</p>
<p>I mean, whether you&rsquo;re Democrat or Republican,</p>
<p>you have the same stance on drugs anyway,</p>
<p>so they all benefit from this.</p>
<p>So many questions I want to ask you,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re challenging a lot of beliefs</p>
<p>that people have about drugs, about society in general.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s difficult for me to ask the right questions here.</p>
<p>If you were with a sort of a snap of a finger,</p>
<p>change the world, what from a policy perspective would you,</p>
<p>and from just a, I don&rsquo;t know, human to human perspective,</p>
<p>what would you like to see in the United States of America</p>
<p>in terms of if that fixes some of the problems</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re discussing here?</p>
<p>First of all, we wouldn&rsquo;t be arresting anybody</p>
<p>for drugs anymore.</p>
<p>That would go away.</p>
<p>The folks who are in prison for drugs, that would go away.</p>
<p>Their records would be expunged, that would just go away.</p>
<p>And then we work on a system to make sure</p>
<p>that responsible adults can legally obtain these substances</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have a corresponding educational system</p>
<p>to teach people how to do this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I would start initially.</p>
<p>Yeah, the arresting for drug use</p>
<p>or anything drug related is absurd,</p>
<p>especially in the context of hard destructive alcohol</p>
<p>and tobacco.</p>
<p>Alcohol can be destructive to some people,</p>
<p>but alcohol also is a hugely beneficial drug.</p>
<p>To be honest, which I couldn&rsquo;t have gotten through</p>
<p>many of the sort of receptions and functions</p>
<p>I had to go through as the chair of the department</p>
<p>without alcohol.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have a line I really liked.</p>
<p>The vast amount of predictably favorable drug effects</p>
<p>intrigued me, so much so that I expanded my own drug use</p>
<p>to take advantage of the wide array</p>
<p>of beneficial outcome specific drugs can offer.</p>
<p>The part that entertained me was this.</p>
<p>To put this in personal terms,</p>
<p>my position as department chairman from 2016 to 2019</p>
<p>was far more detrimental to my health</p>
<p>than my drug use ever was.</p>
<p>I mean, there is a standard we&rsquo;re treating drugs,</p>
<p>certain kinds of drugs that&rsquo;s completely different</p>
<p>than the standard we&rsquo;re treating everything else</p>
<p>in our lives.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s almost difficult to snap out of it</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m listening to you and reading your work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why is everybody living this idea that certain drugs</p>
<p>are so horribly destructive and others are not?</p>
<p>And we just kind of fix that idea.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this narrative,</p>
<p>I hate to be so cynical to think that there is just</p>
<p>like a system that just propagates narratives.</p>
<p>I always kind of think that truth wins out.</p>
<p>Truth is the best narrative.</p>
<p>I believe that too.</p>
<p>Obviously, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m out here and putting,</p>
<p>subjecting myself to this sort of criticism and so forth,</p>
<p>but because I believe that truth ultimately wins out,</p>
<p>but I might be wrong,</p>
<p>but I have to live my life like it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Otherwise, then I have no hope, then why be here?</p>
<p>Well, kind of, if you can steal man</p>
<p>or at least show respect to a criticism,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;m sure received quite a bit of criticism</p>
<p>for your work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard quite a bit of BS criticisms,</p>
<p>sort of ignorant stuff that don&rsquo;t actually pay attention</p>
<p>to your work, but is there some serious,</p>
<p>like is there some pushback that makes you think twice?</p>
<p>People say like, I&rsquo;m presenting a too rosy picture of drugs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna do that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want people to think that I&rsquo;m not aware of the</p>
<p>potential negative effects of any activity,</p>
<p>including drug use.</p>
<p>And so I do acknowledge that there are potential harms</p>
<p>associated with drugs.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that in the book,</p>
<p>but the fact remains the beneficial effects far outweigh</p>
<p>the potential harmful effects.</p>
<p>And we have technology information to help people</p>
<p>to minimize the likelihood of negative effects.</p>
<p>But this sort of approach that we have where we say</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only exclusively presenting the harmful effects</p>
<p>and that should make people, keep people safe.</p>
<p>I just have a problem with that.</p>
<p>But I certainly, I take the point that people say</p>
<p>there are negative effects.</p>
<p>Absolutely, I absolutely agree.</p>
<p>What do you, if I can just talk about specific drugs,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between opioids and benzos,</p>
<p>for example, specifically, I mean,</p>
<p>these are drugs that you often read about</p>
<p>being misused at scale.</p>
<p>I mean, the misuse is the problem, right?</p>
<p>No matter what the drug is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually what you&rsquo;re pushing for is education</p>
<p>and it should be legal and should be good.</p>
<p>So people should know what&rsquo;s the difference in proper use,</p>
<p>positive use and misuse.</p>
<p>I mean, one public figure who has been going through this</p>
<p>is Jordan Peterson, he&rsquo;s been public about his struggle</p>
<p>of getting off benzos, the withdrawal he&rsquo;s going through.</p>
<p>I mean, what are your thoughts about the misuse of benzos</p>
<p>or opioids and so on, the epidemic that people talk about?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know Jordan&rsquo;s specific case,</p>
<p>but certainly with benzodiazepines in general,</p>
<p>we talked about withdrawal earlier.</p>
<p>When I said that with alcohol withdrawal, you can die.</p>
<p>So benzos and alcohol, they&rsquo;re closely related.</p>
<p>So benzo withdrawal too can kill you just like alcohol.</p>
<p>So when we think about the effects</p>
<p>that benzodiazepines produce,</p>
<p>think about the effects that alcohol produce,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re comparable or similar.</p>
<p>And so I know that it&rsquo;s a difficult one to wean yourself off</p>
<p>if you develop the dependence,</p>
<p>but we have protocols for that and I hope he&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting you say we have protocols for that,</p>
<p>but from my understanding was that</p>
<p>like the protocols aren&rsquo;t standardized.</p>
<p>It feels like a lot of doctors aren&rsquo;t as helpful</p>
<p>as they could be in this process.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a bit of a mess.</p>
<p>Certainly with withdrawal,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more standardized than anything.</p>
<p>So like if someone is going through alcohol withdrawal,</p>
<p>there is a standard protocol that most physicians</p>
<p>in this business, they follow.</p>
<p>The same is true with a benzo withdrawal.</p>
<p>But the thing where it gets murky</p>
<p>is when they&rsquo;re treating addiction itself.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re thinking about the substance use disorder</p>
<p>in the DSM, not just withdrawal, but the entire addiction,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you have this sort of a divergence</p>
<p>or diversity in terms of approaches.</p>
<p>And many of those approaches are rubbish.</p>
<p>Can you just elaborate like technically</p>
<p>what the term addiction means that you&rsquo;re referring to?</p>
<p>When I use the term addiction,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual</p>
<p>of the American Psychiatric Association,</p>
<p>number five now, the DSM five.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s never been wrong, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely, that point is well taken.</p>
<p>And your point is that their definition</p>
<p>of substance use disorder, that&rsquo;s addiction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>But that definition continues to evolve.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>They still are working it out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting new information from scientific studies</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s supposed to be incorporated into the DSM,</p>
<p>but there are some problems with the DSM.</p>
<p>Like for example, they also have this sort of once an addict,</p>
<p>always an addict thing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no evidence to support that, but it&rsquo;s evolving.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the definition that people in science</p>
<p>and medicine use.</p>
<p>And so we all know we&rsquo;re talking about the same language</p>
<p>when we call someone a substance use disorder patient</p>
<p>or someone who meets criteria for addiction.</p>
<p>We all are speaking the same language.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not saying that simply because this person</p>
<p>use heroin, they are an addict.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>You have to meet these criteria where you have disruptions</p>
<p>in your psychosocial functioning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>And two, you, the person are distressed</p>
<p>by these disruptions.</p>
<p>So people have to meet those two basic criteria</p>
<p>before we say they are addicted.</p>
<p>So once an addict, always an addict, this idea.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve, I mean, some of it is always mapped</p>
<p>to the person, all right.</p>
<p>But just the people I&rsquo;ve interacted with</p>
<p>who have struggled with alcohol addiction,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the proper term is.</p>
<p>It seems like with Alcohol Anonymous,</p>
<p>the process of putting that addiction behind you</p>
<p>is a very, very long process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprisingly long to me.</p>
<p>That almost seems like a whole life.</p>
<p>Like, he&rsquo;s not always an addict, but it takes decades.</p>
<p>It seems like, what is that?</p>
<p>What, can you maybe just, from your understanding</p>
<p>as a scientist, from your understanding as a human</p>
<p>who studies human nature, why does it take so long</p>
<p>to treat, to deal with that addiction?</p>
<p>Well, you cited Alcohol Anonymous, right?</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think of Alcohol Anonymous</p>
<p>as like a treatment that I would send any relative to,</p>
<p>like for a drug related problem.</p>
<p>I think Alcohol Anonymous AA is really good</p>
<p>for social interactions, making sure people</p>
<p>have a social group and they have peers.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>We all need that social interaction.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think they know much about drugs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s like saying, well, you know,</p>
<p>my uncle broke his knee and he has this support group</p>
<p>and they said this, and then we follow that.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>But in our society, judges even sentence people</p>
<p>to go to AA.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the kind of thing that has been allowed to happen</p>
<p>in this society because we think of drugs</p>
<p>as this moral failing or drug addiction</p>
<p>as this moral failing.</p>
<p>And any idiot can provide treatment</p>
<p>and no disrespect to AA because I think what they do</p>
<p>is a lot more than what some people do</p>
<p>because at least they have this social,</p>
<p>these social interactions, you have a social group.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s better than what a lot of these other idiots</p>
<p>out here do.</p>
<p>Well, and that social support group unrelated to the drug,</p>
<p>it helps cure some of the environment issues</p>
<p>you might be in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>So we kind of coupled the drug to the environment,</p>
<p>but the reality is, as you argue,</p>
<p>most of the problems come from the environment.</p>
<p>Certainly with people who are experiencing</p>
<p>drug related problem with most of the people,</p>
<p>not all, but most.</p>
<p>There are differences like that psychedelics</p>
<p>and like psilocybin has versus alcohol.</p>
<p>I personally think I&rsquo;ve enjoyed both experiences</p>
<p>in different ways.</p>
<p>Is it possible or are we getting into the realm of poetry</p>
<p>to describe the benefits, like how it alters the mind,</p>
<p>how the different drugs alter the mind</p>
<p>and the places it can take you</p>
<p>that produce a positive experience?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s very real.</p>
<p>Like some drugs take people in places that other drugs can</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very real.</p>
<p>I have friends, some of them you know,</p>
<p>they, for example, say that they&rsquo;ve never had an experience</p>
<p>like the one they had with ayahuasca</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve done a number of sort of things,</p>
<p>but they did the ayahuasca in a setting with a shaman</p>
<p>and this group and they felt like they actually began</p>
<p>to heal or solve some problems</p>
<p>that they were trying to solve for some years.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great, that&rsquo;s great for them.</p>
<p>And nothing else does it for them like that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>All I argue is that if that kind of thing happens for you</p>
<p>with ayahuasca, with psilocybin,</p>
<p>with some other psychedelic,</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t it possible that heroin does that for someone</p>
<p>or cocaine does that for someone else</p>
<p>or MDMA does it for someone, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting to imagine like a shaman for heroin.</p>
<p>Like why not?</p>
<p>Or cocaine, you said creating an environment for yourself,</p>
<p>for use of these different substances</p>
<p>and that environment has a very strong impact</p>
<p>on the actual experience that you have.</p>
<p>But I mean, so cocaine is an upper and then.</p>
<p>Yeah, the way we define drugs like uppers and downers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really kind of inappropriate way</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a quick way.</p>
<p>So we certainly say cocaine is an upper or stimulant.</p>
<p>But it depends on the activity of the person</p>
<p>before they take the drug.</p>
<p>Say like if you&rsquo;re like really active</p>
<p>before taking a drug like cocaine,</p>
<p>it might actually calm you.</p>
<p>So it all depends on the activity of the person</p>
<p>before they take the drug.</p>
<p>I remember, I don&rsquo;t know if you know Matthew Johnson is.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>He did all these studies on,</p>
<p>or I remember just reading a paper,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to talk with him much about it,</p>
<p>but it was about condom use and cocaine.</p>
<p>And then like the doses</p>
<p>and whether people are more or less likely.</p>
<p>Like the unsafe thing there is the using or not using,</p>
<p>or not using, I guess, condoms during sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I just, I love that these drugs</p>
<p>that have connotation probably because of Hollywood,</p>
<p>negative connotations are actually being studied by science.</p>
<p>And then the actual impact they have,</p>
<p>and what are the negative effects.</p>
<p>Again, in those studies often,</p>
<p>the positive effects are difficult to quantify, I think.</p>
<p>Maybe I guess you can from self report and so on.</p>
<p>Positive effects are not difficult to quantify.</p>
<p>You ask people about their euphoria,</p>
<p>you can see how well people are getting along.</p>
<p>Like in our studies that we have people sometimes in groups</p>
<p>and you see how well they get along</p>
<p>on the various drug conditions or placebo conditions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s not that difficult.</p>
<p>And then you can see these amazing studies</p>
<p>with like Rick Doblin, like the looking at MDMA</p>
<p>and combined with therapy,</p>
<p>like how you can overcome certain PTSD things</p>
<p>or depression and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I had to ask you, cause you mentioned The Wire.</p>
<p>Do you think The Wire, you think movies like Trainspotting,</p>
<p>do you think they&rsquo;re ultimately destroying?</p>
<p>Cause okay.</p>
<p>Yes, they celebrate murder, right?</p>
<p>The Godfather a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But another one, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like these racist ass motherfuckers</p>
<p>and they also are killing people,</p>
<p>but yet they say, we don&rsquo;t do drugs.</p>
<p>What kind of shit is that?</p>
<p>I mean, people who are doing drugs, psilocybin or whatever.</p>
<p>The thing is we&rsquo;re trying to be better people</p>
<p>and trying to make our society better</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re killing people</p>
<p>and you are denigrating people for using drugs.</p>
<p>Are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p>And we let them get away with that as a society.</p>
<p>Do you see those movies?</p>
<p>I apologize if I&rsquo;m not sufficiently informed.</p>
<p>You see them as denigrating drugs?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I mean, The Godfather.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good example.</p>
<p>The Godfather, The Sopranos is all about that.</p>
<p>I mean, Christopher is using heroin in The Sopranos</p>
<p>and they have an intervention in one season</p>
<p>and they are denigrating him.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>You just cut somebody&rsquo;s head off.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they&rsquo;re, to be fair,</p>
<p>they were denigrating, I think, all drugs.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re drinking alcohol in the butterbeam.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Come on, I mean, first of all, they&rsquo;re killing people.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any space, none,</p>
<p>to denigrate somebody who&rsquo;s just trying</p>
<p>to alter their consciousness.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>And not bothering anyone else.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of other mob movies</p>
<p>that Scarface celebrates the murder and the drugs equally.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it celebrates all of the, not just drugs or so on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extreme.</p>
<p>All of those movies, you know,</p>
<p>I loved all those movies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Miami, I loved Scarface.</p>
<p>I even liked The Sopranos that I started looking</p>
<p>at that shit with a critical eye and see what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>But Scarface is dependent upon the American viewer</p>
<p>having a certain view of people who deal in drugs.</p>
<p>And that view is that these people are animals, basically.</p>
<p>And in the end, the animal kills himself</p>
<p>with too much cocaine and he was high.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they show.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s leveraging, it&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>into not the better angels of our nature.</p>
<p>The question.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take away these great movies from me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s true, you have to think about them critically</p>
<p>in the context.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>I like these movies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a matter of taking away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of making the writers be more honest</p>
<p>to the reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really true.</p>
<p>And the writers, the people, the culture, all of it.</p>
<p>I mean, they write these things.</p>
<p>I just think about some hip hop artists.</p>
<p>They say like, this is real.</p>
<p>This is my experience and so forth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how these movie writers,</p>
<p>they write this bullshit and then say, well, this is real.</p>
<p>Anyway, I get so upset talking about it</p>
<p>because I know the harm it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>And I know those kinds of movies are the reason</p>
<p>that we have this war on drugs.</p>
<p>And all of these people are going to jail</p>
<p>because of those kinds of movies.</p>
<p>In the epilogue of your book, you quote James Baldwin.</p>
<p>You cannot know what you will discover on the journey,</p>
<p>what you will do with what you find</p>
<p>or what you find will do to you.</p>
<p>So let me ask, how has drug use or the study of drugs</p>
<p>changed you as a human being?</p>
<p>It has helped me think about other people&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>So how we&rsquo;re all connected, like going to Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know much about the situation</p>
<p>with the troubles and what those people went through.</p>
<p>And so I see people there.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland, by the way, is all white.</p>
<p>And you see those people there suffering</p>
<p>for the same reasons that people in Appalachia</p>
<p>are suffering for.</p>
<p>Neglected by politicians who told them lies about drugs</p>
<p>and not dealing with the real problems,</p>
<p>like West Virginia, for example.</p>
<p>Their water&rsquo;s polluted, the factories have gone away,</p>
<p>people are desperate and they&rsquo;re blaming drugs.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>So the politicians don&rsquo;t have to bring back the jobs.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have to really make sure</p>
<p>they have clean drinking water, things of that nature.</p>
<p>And so those people are connected</p>
<p>to the people in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re connected to the people in Brownsville.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re connected to the people in other places</p>
<p>in the United States for the same reason.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re connected to the people in Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p>
<p>Same thing, people are catching hell for the same reason</p>
<p>in the Philippines for the same reason.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I feel so strongly about this thing</p>
<p>because I know there are people getting paid</p>
<p>and their paycheck is predicated on subjugating</p>
<p>and the suffering of those other people.</p>
<p>So when we hear about the destructive effects of drugs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s essentially a scapegoat for the failures of leaders</p>
<p>and politicians to help alleviate the suffering</p>
<p>of people in those communities.</p>
<p>Absolutely, it&rsquo;s so easy to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna rid your community of drugs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put more cops on the street.</p>
<p>If you want a problem not to be solved,</p>
<p>just give it to the military or the cops.</p>
<p>You had a tough childhood growing up in Miami, like you said.</p>
<p>What memory stands out in particular that was formative</p>
<p>and helping make you the man you are?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so hard to say, my grandmother was really important.</p>
<p>So maybe just her trying to make sure that I think critically,</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s the biggest one.</p>
<p>So you moved in with your parents split?</p>
<p>Six, seven, yeah.</p>
<p>What have you learned about life from her?</p>
<p>Be self sufficient, be critical and keep your eyes open</p>
<p>and watch out for the okie doke.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what this whole drug thing is about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the okie doke, people, it really boils down</p>
<p>to just simple thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all similar in that we&rsquo;re all just trying</p>
<p>to live our life, trying to take care of our kids.</p>
<p>We want the best for our kids, all of us.</p>
<p>But yet somehow we&rsquo;ve been made to believe</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re different in that way.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, we&rsquo;re all the same.</p>
<p>So when people are seeking to feel pleasure, to feel better,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we celebrate that?</p>
<p>Instead, we denigrate people for that.</p>
<p>I mean, if I feel better, I&rsquo;m more likely to treat you well.</p>
<p>I got to say still, though, you&rsquo;re going against the grain</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re at Columbia, it takes a lot of guts</p>
<p>to sort of speak out about these ideas so boldly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to ask this question.</p>
<p>Where do you find the guts?</p>
<p>What, because it&rsquo;s also perhaps inspirational to others</p>
<p>in different disciplines that are sort of taking</p>
<p>on the conventional wisdom of the day.</p>
<p>And challenging it, what does it take to do that?</p>
<p>What advice would you give to others like you kind</p>
<p>of a little bit afraid to do so?</p>
<p>Once you know, you cannot not know, as they say.</p>
<p>And so I have to look in the mirror.</p>
<p>And then looking in the mirror, I have to face myself.</p>
<p>Have I lived honestly?</p>
<p>And if I can&rsquo;t face myself, then what am I doing here?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s how I see it.</p>
<p>One of the things that people don&rsquo;t really talk about</p>
<p>with drugs and people who die from some drug related death.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a whole lot</p>
<p>over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some of these drugs can take you to a place</p>
<p>where you feel so optimistic and positive about humans,</p>
<p>our fellow humans.</p>
<p>And you want to do your best to contribute.</p>
<p>And because you know the possibilities</p>
<p>of what we can be as a society.</p>
<p>And then you come up with resistance and you, like you say,</p>
<p>there are a lot, there&rsquo;s a lot of resistance</p>
<p>and people just have a hard time.</p>
<p>And so if you know humans can be better</p>
<p>and they refuse to be better, why be here</p>
<p>as someone who knows that we can do this better?</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t want to do it the way we&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>So you kind of see drugs as mechanisms</p>
<p>for potentially elevating the human spirit,</p>
<p>sort of making people feel better.</p>
<p>So you want to communicate that message.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that plus the fact that drugs are used as scapegoat</p>
<p>to not alleviate the suffering of certain communities.</p>
<p>So those two things come together.</p>
<p>One of the sort of main points of the book too</p>
<p>was to try and get people to understand the possibilities</p>
<p>that we could have if we embraced certain drug use.</p>
<p>If we allowed adults to do this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Relationships can be better.</p>
<p>A wide range of beneficial effects.</p>
<p>People would be, or can learn to be more magnanimous.</p>
<p>All of these pro social things that we say we value.</p>
<p>In your previous book, High Price,</p>
<p>you talk about rap and DJing, chapter five.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a nice picture of you DJing from 1983.</p>
<p>So let me ask who in your view,</p>
<p>this is the toughest question of this interview,</p>
<p>is the greatest hip hop artist of all time?</p>
<p>Maybe give some candidates.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Who is the greatest hip hop artist?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m qualified to make that bag</p>
<p>because I have to go back to like Gil Scott Heron.</p>
<p>Like people think of him as one of the fathers of hip hop.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my all time favorite.</p>
<p>People like Chuck D from Public Enemy.</p>
<p>Some of the things that they were doing,</p>
<p>I was really digging, but even though I was digging</p>
<p>like Public Enemy, but even they got it wrong on drugs.</p>
<p>Even Gil Scott Heron got it wrong on drugs.</p>
<p>But they were doing so much other good stuff.</p>
<p>It helped me to develop as a person.</p>
<p>And so I think like my son is a hip hop artist now.</p>
<p>I think those folks who are in the game now,</p>
<p>they are a lot more qualified to talk about who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the greatest hip hop artist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not qualified.</p>
<p>The evolution, I mean, have you tracked the evolution</p>
<p>from sort of the 90s with Wu Tang and Tupac and Biggie</p>
<p>and then to what we have today?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just been a crazy amount of progress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like almost difficult to track.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I really love what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I like what they accept the part where they get over 40</p>
<p>and they become fucking cops on TV.</p>
<p>I mean, other than that, I dig what&rsquo;s that about.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t understand that, but that&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>Again, this sort of glorification of cops,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dangerous for a society.</p>
<p>And those cats who do that kind of thing,</p>
<p>I have a problem with that.</p>
<p>Is it all sort of to push back a little bit?</p>
<p>Because I come from the Soviet Union</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a huge amount of corruption.</p>
<p>And when I see what&rsquo;s going on with cops in this country,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of proper criticism you can apply,</p>
<p>but like relative to other places,</p>
<p>this is, well, on so many ways, this country is incredible.</p>
<p>Is your criticism towards cops</p>
<p>or towards what cops are asked to do?</p>
<p>Yeah, towards what cops are asked to do.</p>
<p>Cops provide the shield for politicians and those in power.</p>
<p>Absolutely, because I was in the military,</p>
<p>I spent four years in the military</p>
<p>and I did what I was told to do.</p>
<p>And I was ignorant and thought I was doing the right thing.</p>
<p>And I did what I was told to do.</p>
<p>And so just like these guys are doing what they&rsquo;re told to do.</p>
<p>But no, my real beef is with the power structure,</p>
<p>the folks who are telling them what to do.</p>
<p>And also the folks who go play cops on television.</p>
<p>That imagery, that sort of glorifying cops,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem in a democracy.</p>
<p>Yeah, all sides of the glorification</p>
<p>of the drug war is a problem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If I can just linger on a little longer</p>
<p>in terms of the effects of drugs,</p>
<p>on the positive like mind expanding components of it,</p>
<p>what have mind altering drugs teach you</p>
<p>about the human mind?</p>
<p>Sort of from a neuroscience, not even like a biochemical,</p>
<p>but just like the human mind is amazing, right?</p>
<p>The places it can go.</p>
<p>Like, are there some insights you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>from studying drugs about the mind?</p>
<p>Yeah, can I start from a neurochemical perspective first</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll go larger?</p>
<p>Just from a neurochemical perspective.</p>
<p>I mean, everything I know about the brain,</p>
<p>I learned through drugs because of my interest in drugs.</p>
<p>So I learned a lot about dopamine neurons</p>
<p>in certain regions of the brain, about neuro epinephrine</p>
<p>neurons and a wide range of other sort of neural transmission</p>
<p>happened because of drugs.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a really valuable tool, lessons for me.</p>
<p>But then when we think that we move out a bit</p>
<p>and we think more globally,</p>
<p>what have I learned in terms of the mind from drugs?</p>
<p>I have really learned how to be more forgiving of people</p>
<p>and myself and tolerant, more tolerant of people</p>
<p>and certainly learned a lot more about empathy</p>
<p>as a result of drug use.</p>
<p>And like I said earlier, I&rsquo;m learning what we can be</p>
<p>as a species and it&rsquo;s quite incredible,</p>
<p>but because of drugs.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a certain property of drugs in different ways.</p>
<p>They take you out of your body,</p>
<p>like they help you evaluate yourself</p>
<p>from like a third person perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like you have a consciousness in here</p>
<p>and you get to step outside of it a little bit.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of what meditation does too.</p>
<p>All of these processes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what a hell of a good workout does too.</p>
<p>It makes you evaluate yourself and then somehow</p>
<p>that allows you to be forgiving to yourself</p>
<p>and forgiving to others, sort of empathize.</p>
<p>It trains that part of your brain.</p>
<p>So stepping outside of yourself,</p>
<p>not taking yourself too seriously, that process.</p>
<p>And different drugs do that in different ways.</p>
<p>Obviously, I don&rsquo;t know from personal experience</p>
<p>on some of them, but I&rsquo;m now curious,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unfortunate that the Hollywood and different stories</p>
<p>we have demonize certain drugs and sort of basically,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, make it difficult for people like me</p>
<p>to explore those ideas, but then I&rsquo;m really thankful</p>
<p>for people like you who are pushing the science forward</p>
<p>and are unafraid to talk about this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m really fascinated with consciousness</p>
<p>on the engineering side.</p>
<p>I really want to build robots that have elements</p>
<p>of intelligence, emotion, even consciousness.</p>
<p>And for that, we need to understand it in ourselves</p>
<p>and drugs is all the different kinds of drugs.</p>
<p>If you safely seems like an incredible tool</p>
<p>to understand ourselves.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re limiting ourselves from certain drugs</p>
<p>because of certain political games that are being played,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>And people know this, a lot of middle to upper class</p>
<p>people know this, the illicit drug trade business</p>
<p>is a multi million dollar industry,</p>
<p>multi billion dollar industry that could not be supported</p>
<p>by people who are poor.</p>
<p>And that has to be supported by a lot of customers.</p>
<p>And a lot of people around the world know this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in the closet and in the book,</p>
<p>I call for them to get out of the closet.</p>
<p>So we can start being more honest</p>
<p>and we can take the pressure off of those people</p>
<p>who are not as privileged.</p>
<p>Like I said, you&rsquo;re brave, you&rsquo;re bold.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you for some advice.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person today?</p>
<p>High school, maybe undergrad, college,</p>
<p>thinking about their career,</p>
<p>thinking about how to live a life they can be proud of.</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever career they choose,</p>
<p>just make sure that they dedicate themselves to it</p>
<p>and be the best at what they do first.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you have to do first.</p>
<p>Like people see me advocating for this position.</p>
<p>30 years of science is in these opinions, this view.</p>
<p>And trust me, I would be dismissed</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t know my shit, if I was not.</p>
<p>Yeah, you did the work, you proved yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re legit by the people in the eyes of the people</p>
<p>who know.</p>
<p>Absolutely, so that&rsquo;s the main thing</p>
<p>that I would encourage people to do,</p>
<p>really know your craft.</p>
<p>If you know your craft,</p>
<p>and then maybe you will be a service</p>
<p>to your fellow citizens.</p>
<p>There are so many people out here faking the funk</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know their craft</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not a service to the people</p>
<p>that they claim to serve.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>And when you have a fair number of people</p>
<p>like that in positions of power,</p>
<p>your society is going to crumble.</p>
<p>What about the scientific path?</p>
<p>You recommend people get a PhD?</p>
<p>Not necessarily, like my own children,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend that.</p>
<p>So science can, certainly my science</p>
<p>can be a very petty sort of space to be in.</p>
<p>But it was the only sort of path that I had.</p>
<p>And so I had to do it.</p>
<p>But no, I would really encourage people</p>
<p>to just do something that they enjoy</p>
<p>and something that makes them happy.</p>
<p>Because the greater number of happy people in our society,</p>
<p>the better off we all are.</p>
<p>All right, since you mentioned happiness,</p>
<p>gotta ask you about the pursuit of happiness</p>
<p>and the ridiculous question about meaning.</p>
<p>Do you think this life has meaning?</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I certainly hope it has meaning.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m certainly trying to live my life</p>
<p>like it has meaning.</p>
<p>You know, I really love my life now.</p>
<p>I just got back from Geneva.</p>
<p>I spent the summer abroad in Europe</p>
<p>and trying to be in a more civilized place</p>
<p>where you can enjoy yourself as a responsible adult.</p>
<p>And then it allowed me to decompress</p>
<p>and then come back here.</p>
<p>The thing about coming back here</p>
<p>is that you have to be ready to fight.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna fight anymore.</p>
<p>I just wanna be able to help a society and people.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll have to keep a place in Europe</p>
<p>to go and decompress and then come back</p>
<p>to be able to tolerate the situation.</p>
<p>So life for me has a lot of meaning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying life.</p>
<p>And this is like the greatest,</p>
<p>the best part of my life ever right now at this moment.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the joy,</p>
<p>but you also enjoy the fight a little bit or?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t really, I&rsquo;m tired of that.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, why?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to help people to see how they can be happy</p>
<p>and then people are fighting me on that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be happy.</p>
<p>I wanna be ignorant.</p>
<p>Leave me alone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people are saying.</p>
<p>Well, so what is the source of joy for you</p>
<p>when you decompress?</p>
<p>MDMA is a source, you know,</p>
<p>and a place where you don&rsquo;t have to worry about laws,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like Europe.</p>
<p>You can feel really free.</p>
<p>Yeah, heroin can even be a nice space</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m in my own head,</p>
<p>but with others, MDMA is great.</p>
<p>So, but good friends, good food.</p>
<p>The usual.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Family, love.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Carl, you&rsquo;re an incredible human being.</p>
<p>You really make me think.</p>
<p>Everyone who listens to this,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m really glad you exist.</p>
<p>I know you say you don&rsquo;t like the fight,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m really glad you&rsquo;re fighting the fight</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna help a lot of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna help, at the very least,</p>
<p>help a lot of people think</p>
<p>and challenge the conventions of the day</p>
<p>and maybe challenge them to find joy.</p>
<p>I really appreciate you spending your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>This was an awesome conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me, man.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Carl Hart.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Frank Zappa.</p>
<p>A drug is not bad.</p>
<p>A drug is a chemical compound.</p>
<p>The problem comes in when people who take drugs</p>
<p>treat them like a license to behave like an asshole.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
