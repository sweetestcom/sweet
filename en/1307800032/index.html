<p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 30, The Celtic Legacy.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to explore the impact of the Celtic languages on modern English,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to look at the ultimate fate of the native Britons when they encountered</p>
<p>the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>Now this may seem like a straightforward topic, but actually it&rsquo;s a topic that&rsquo;s perplexed</p>
<p>historians for centuries.</p>
<p>The true legacy of the Celts in Anglo-Saxon England is still the subject of much debate.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll try to put the pieces together for you as best I can to determine how much modern</p>
<p>English owes to those original Celtic Britons.</p>
<p>Now last time, we looked at the actual evidence from the period of the Anglo-Saxon invasion</p>
<p>to try to determine what happened between the years 410 and 600.</p>
<p>That two-century period marks the time during which the Anglo-Saxons conquered much of the</p>
<p>area we know today as England.</p>
<p>And based upon that evidence and the accounts of later writers, a very general view emerged.</p>
<p>And that view was that an Anglo-Saxon onslaught began sometime around the year 450, give or</p>
<p>take a few years.</p>
<p>And over the next few decades, the Anglo-Saxons conquered much of the region of Eastern Britain.</p>
<p>And in the process, the native Romano-Britons and Celtic Britons were either killed or displaced.</p>
<p>The result was the complete Anglo-Saxon dominance and control over Eastern Britain.</p>
<p>And then the Anglo-Saxons began to move westward, expanding their territory.</p>
<p>But sometime around the year 500, the native Britons began to piece together some significant</p>
<p>victories in these border regions.</p>
<p>Around that time, they won a decisive victory at a place called Mons Bodonicus in Latin</p>
<p>or Mount Baden or Baden Hill in later English.</p>
<p>And that victory basically stemmed the tide of the Anglo-Saxon invasion.</p>
<p>For a while, there was a period of relative peace between the Britons and the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>But sometime around the year 550, another onslaught began and the Anglo-Saxons began</p>
<p>a new campaign into Western Britain.</p>
<p>And that meant a new round of killing and displacement occurred.</p>
<p>Now most of the native Celtic-speaking Britons who survived fled to the west to Cornwall</p>
<p>and Wales and north into modern Scotland or even south across the Channel into Brittany</p>
<p>in northern Gaul.</p>
<p>And the net result of all of this was a large portion of central and southern Britain under</p>
<p>the control of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>And along the way, the native Celtic-speaking Britons were effectively wiped out from these</p>
<p>regions.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the traditional view of events during this period.</p>
<p>So why did these historians assume that the native Celts had been completely displaced</p>
<p>from these regions?</p>
<p>Well it was based in part on the descriptions of people like Gildas.</p>
<p>He described how many of the native Britons had been killed by the invaders and how most</p>
<p>of those who survived had fled to the west or across the seas.</p>
<p>And he noted that most of the towns and cities had been devastated and abandoned.</p>
<p>So we have a contemporary account which was very compelling.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no evidence that Gildas actually traveled into the regions which had been conquered</p>
<p>by the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>And even he noted that he was writing several decades after those initial battles had occurred.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that he wasn&rsquo;t really writing a proper history.</p>
<p>He was writing a sermon about how bad the Anglo-Saxons were and how much of a mistake</p>
<p>it had been to invite the men to begin with.</p>
<p>Now we know that some of his early history was wrong, especially his account of the construction</p>
<p>of Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall.</p>
<p>So for much of his history he was basing his accounts on the descriptions of others.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible that these accounts were exaggerated.</p>
<p>Or that he exaggerated his account in order to emphasize his point.</p>
<p>But beyond the writings of Gildas, some of the best evidence that the Celts had been</p>
<p>wiped out was the fact that there are so few Celtic words in English.</p>
<p>As a general rule, when two groups of people encounter each other, and they each speak</p>
<p>different languages, there&rsquo;s a significant amount of borrowing between the languages.</p>
<p>Over time, one language may die out, but the surviving language usually retains a large</p>
<p>number of words from the other language.</p>
<p>And it may even borrow some grammar from the other language.</p>
<p>So theoretically, English should have a heavy Celtic influence.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons conquered a Celtic-speaking people on a Celtic-speaking island.</p>
<p>And Celtic languages have continued to exist next door on the island to this day.</p>
<p>So where is all that Celtic influence that we should expect to see?</p>
<p>Well, the traditional view is that it&rsquo;s not really there.</p>
<p>According to that view, the Anglo-Saxons only borrowed a handful of Celtic words.</p>
<p>Depending on who you ask, maybe a dozen, maybe a couple of dozen, but very few no</p>
<p>matter how you count them.</p>
<p>Now compare this to Latin, as it slowly replaced the Celtic languages in Gaul.</p>
<p>Of course, the Latin spoken in Gaul eventually evolved into French.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s estimated that there are over 500 Celtic words in modern French.</p>
<p>But again, the Anglo-Saxons in Britain only borrowed a dozen or so.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try to identify those Celtic words in English.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s begin by noting that the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons, the original Germanic</p>
<p>tribes, they encountered Celtic-speaking tribes on the continent.</p>
<p>And back in episode 17, we looked at some of those Celtic words which were acquired</p>
<p>by the Germanic tribes very early on, long before the Anglo-Saxons headed to Britain.</p>
<p>And that included words like breaches and ben, b-i-n.</p>
<p>We also have the word rich from the Celtic word rics, meaning king or ruler or powerful.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come across that word several times, and we&rsquo;ll see it again a little later in this episode.</p>
<p>So the Anglo-Saxons had a few Celtic words in their vocabulary when they first arrived</p>
<p>in Britain.</p>
<p>And then, once they were in Britain, they picked up a few more words.</p>
<p>A few of those words existed in Old English, but have long since disappeared.</p>
<p>For example, the Old English word bonnock meant a bit or small piece of something.</p>
<p>It came from an almost identical word in the Celtic languages, which meant a small cake.</p>
<p>And the Old English word brock meant badger, and it too was borrowed from the Celts.</p>
<p>And the Old English word done meant a dull, greyish-brown color.</p>
<p>It also was borrowed from the Celts, but all of those words have long since disappeared</p>
<p>from English.</p>
<p>Another possible borrowing from the Celtic languages was the word brat, as in, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be a little brat.</p>
<p>This etymology is disputed, but the Celtic languages had a word brat, which meant a cloak.</p>
<p>And according to some etymologies, it later came to mean a makeshift or ragged garment,</p>
<p>and then came to be associated with beggars, and later came to mean a beggar&rsquo;s child,</p>
<p>and then even later it referred to an annoying child.</p>
<p>So if this etymology is correct, the word brat can be traced back to the native Celtic-speaking</p>
<p>Britons.</p>
<p>But most of the Celtic words which were borrowed by the original Anglo-Saxons, and which still</p>
<p>exist in modern English, were terms related to the geography of the region.</p>
<p>As the Anglo-Saxons settled in, they borrowed local words for certain places and geographical</p>
<p>features.</p>
<p>So, for example, the word crag meant rock, and can still be found in English.</p>
<p>The word tor meant hill or mound or rock, and that word still exists in English, mainly</p>
<p>in certain parts of England.</p>
<p>Interestingly, that word tor was probably borrowed from the Romans during the earlier</p>
<p>period of Roman rule.</p>
<p>Now Latin had the word turris, which meant high structure, and that Latin word ultimately</p>
<p>gave us the English word tower.</p>
<p>So Celtic tor and English tower are cognate if that etymology is correct.</p>
<p>Some other Celtic words for locations or geological features can still be found buried within</p>
<p>other words.</p>
<p>For example, the Celtic word lin or lindo meant lake, and the Romans combined that word</p>
<p>lindo with the Latin word colonia meaning colony.</p>
<p>The result was the name Lincoln, the name of a town, which is the ultimate origin of</p>
<p>the surname Lincoln.</p>
<p>The Celtic word cum meant a valley, and that word still exists in a handful of place names</p>
<p>that end in com, either c-o-m-b or c-o-m-b-e.</p>
<p>And the Celtic word for river was avon, and that word appears in a variety of river names</p>
<p>in Britain.</p>
<p>And a lot of other modern place names derive from Celtic names, names like London, Devon,</p>
<p>Dover, Kent, York, Carlisle, Lancaster, Cornwall, Cumberland, and also the river Thames, which</p>
<p>meant dark river in Celtic.</p>
<p>So the fact that we have a lot of place names borrowed into English isn&rsquo;t really surprising.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons tended to use existing words for place names.</p>
<p>And when Europeans settled in North America, they did basically the same thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have so many place names in the United States that are derived from Native</p>
<p>American names.</p>
<p>But while English borrowed Celtic words for certain place names, it didn&rsquo;t borrow Celtic</p>
<p>words into the basic vocabulary of English.</p>
<p>And except for a few more place names, there don&rsquo;t appear to be any other Celtic words</p>
<p>in the original vocabulary of Old English during the first few centuries after the Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>arrived in Britain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the traditional view has been that the native Celtic-speaking populations</p>
<p>were generally wiped out by the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>The Germanic tribes arrived, they picked up a few Celtic words for the names of places</p>
<p>around them, and that was about it.</p>
<p>The Celts were then killed or driven out, and no more Celtic words entered the vocabulary</p>
<p>of Old English.</p>
<p>Well, that traditional view has been challenged in recent years.</p>
<p>The modern view is a bit more complicated, and there are still as many questions as there</p>
<p>are answers.</p>
<p>As scholars have poured over the evidence from this period, the 5th and 6th centuries,</p>
<p>they increasingly believe that the relationship between the native Celtic-speaking Britons</p>
<p>and the Anglo-Saxon invaders was far more complicated.</p>
<p>And what happened varied from one region to the next.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s examine the evidence, and let&rsquo;s try to piece together what happened to the</p>
<p>native Celtic-speaking Britons.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with some of the archaeological research.</p>
<p>Now through the years, archaeologists have uncovered many Anglo-Saxon settlements.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also uncovered a lot of cemeteries, and this research is important for two reasons.</p>
<p>It provides obvious archaeological evidence, but with respect to the bones that have been</p>
<p>studied within some of those graves, it also reveals some genetic evidence.</p>
<p>Now the archaeological evidence provides mixed results, depending on the region where</p>
<p>the settlements were located.</p>
<p>Within those settlements, researchers have found pottery and jewelry, and other items</p>
<p>which are distinct from those associated with Roman Britain before the Anglo-Saxon invasion.</p>
<p>And those newer artifacts tend to match the types used in the North Sea region on the</p>
<p>continent.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is that researchers don&rsquo;t generally find a sharp contrast between</p>
<p>the earlier Roman and Celtic objects and the later Anglo-Saxon objects.</p>
<p>In other words, we don&rsquo;t go from Roman and Celtic objects one day, and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden a clean break, and we just have Anglo-Saxon objects the next day.</p>
<p>But we would expect to see that type of clean break if the Romano-Britons were wiped out.</p>
<p>But instead, the evidence tends to show a more gradual introduction of Anglo-Saxon objects</p>
<p>mixed in with older objects.</p>
<p>But what about those cemeteries?</p>
<p>Well, we would expect to see mass graves of dead Romano-Britons if something akin to a</p>
<p>genocide had occurred.</p>
<p>But those have never been discovered.</p>
<p>And within the graves that have been discovered, the bones that have been analyzed also reveal</p>
<p>a much more complex result.</p>
<p>Within many of the supposedly Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, the bone evidence isn&rsquo;t always</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon.</p>
<p>Isotope analysis of teeth found in those cemeteries has revealed that some of the corpses were</p>
<p>indeed immigrants from northern Europe, but others were local people, not Germanic invaders.</p>
<p>Now many researchers thought that modern DNA evidence would finally provide us with some</p>
<p>definitive answers to these questions.</p>
<p>If the native Britons had been wiped out by the Anglo-Saxon invaders from northern Germany</p>
<p>and Denmark, then DNA evidence on these ancient bones should confirm that.</p>
<p>And in fact, since people didn&rsquo;t tend to move around very much during the Middle Ages,</p>
<p>many researchers believe that there should still be noticeable differences in the DNA</p>
<p>of people in England and the DNA of people in other parts of Britain.</p>
<p>But the DNA research has also yielded mixed results.</p>
<p>One of the first DNA studies was conducted back in 2002, and it actually appeared to</p>
<p>confirm some of these traditional assumptions.</p>
<p>This 2002 study used Y-chromosome DNA samples from men living in central England, Wales,</p>
<p>Norway, and modern Frisia or Friesland.</p>
<p>And this study concluded that DNA evidence was consistent between the various English</p>
<p>towns, and also consistent between the English towns and the Frisian towns.</p>
<p>But there were very distinct differences between the English Frisian groups and the</p>
<p>Welsh groups, and the Norwegian groups were very different as well.</p>
<p>So this particular study concluded that there had been a substantial migration of people</p>
<p>from the Germanic regions of northern Europe to southern and central Britain, enough to</p>
<p>affect well over half of the gene pool of England.</p>
<p>Now again, this was what a lot of people expected to find.</p>
<p>But several more studies have been conducted in the years since 2002, and none of them</p>
<p>really confirmed the results of that first study.</p>
<p>A 2003 study used a lot more samples and a much larger sampling area.</p>
<p>It concluded that there were some genetic differences noticeable between the populations</p>
<p>of England and Wales, but the differences were minor.</p>
<p>And while there was some evidence of Germanic invasions in England, the evidence suggested</p>
<p>a much smaller invasion.</p>
<p>And it also suggested that Viking influence on the overall DNA was just as great if not</p>
<p>greater than the Anglo-Saxon influence.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that this study didn&rsquo;t match the traditional view of the Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>conquest at all.</p>
<p>Now a 2005 study used mitochondrial DNA as well as Y-chromosome DNA, so that meant that</p>
<p>it included females as well as males.</p>
<p>It also used modern DNA as well as DNA from bones found in ancient burial sites.</p>
<p>And this study also failed to establish connections between English DNA samples and the samples</p>
<p>from northern Germany.</p>
<p>And in 2006, an Oxford genetics professor named Brian Sykes published a book called</p>
<p>Blood of the Isles.</p>
<p>He also looked at mitochondrial DNA as well as Y-chromosome DNA.</p>
<p>He found that the overall genetic makeup of the entire British Isles was basically</p>
<p>the same.</p>
<p>That there were no significant differences between the populations of England and Wales.</p>
<p>Nor was there any significant differences between those people and the people of Scotland</p>
<p>and Ireland.</p>
<p>He even concluded that the genetic evidence suggests a massive migration shortly after</p>
<p>the last Ice Age ended around 10,000 BC and that most of the original DNA came from the</p>
<p>modern Basque region in northern Spain.</p>
<p>Remember that the Basque language is one of the few non-Indo-European languages in Europe.</p>
<p>Now Sykes also concluded that as Britain was invaded by various peoples over the centuries</p>
<p>speaking many new languages like the original Celts and the Romans and the Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>and the Vikings, none of them had a significant impact on the overall DNA of the British Isles.</p>
<p>The languages may have changed and the power may have shifted among the different groups</p>
<p>but the overall genetic makeup remained basically the same.</p>
<p>And this implied that the overall number of invaders was always very small.</p>
<p>And specifically with respect to the Anglo-Saxons, Sykes concluded that their contribution to</p>
<p>the overall genetic pool was less than 20% even in the heart of the original Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>regions in eastern Britain.</p>
<p>Now Sykes&rsquo; study was basically confirmed by a separate book released by the British</p>
<p>doctor and geneticist Stephen Oppenheimer.</p>
<p>He released his book, The Origins of the British, the same year as Sykes&rsquo; book and he basically</p>
<p>took the same view as Sykes.</p>
<p>And just to show you how all this research leads to conflicting results, in 2011 a study</p>
<p>suggested that British DNA was the primary result of an even earlier migration by early</p>
<p>hunter-gatherers from the Middle East.</p>
<p>But then the very next year, 2012, another study refuted those findings.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is that the DNA research has yet to reveal a definitive answer as to</p>
<p>whether the native Britons were wiped out by the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>But the vast majority of the DNA studies suggest that the overall DNA of the British Isles</p>
<p>is much more alike than it is different.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t provide any clear evidence of a geographical divide between the Celtic</p>
<p>regions and the English regions.</p>
<p>So all of that research has tended to chip away at that traditional view of the Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>conquest.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve looked at the archaeological evidence and the DNA evidence.</p>
<p>But what about the linguistic evidence?</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve already seen, the Anglo-Saxons adopted very few words from the native Celtic-speaking</p>
<p>Britons.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the native Britons were vanquished.</p>
<p>They could have still been there, just in the background, relegated to second class</p>
<p>or lower status, and pushed to the fringes of Anglo-Saxon society.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons could have rejected Celtic words and Celtic culture except where they</p>
<p>needed it to survive.</p>
<p>They might have borrowed words for towns and rivers and other locations.</p>
<p>Those were basic landmarks.</p>
<p>But when it came to the actual language itself, Celtic influences were rejected.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try to put all the pieces together and see if we can make some sense out of this</p>
<p>linguistic mystery.</p>
<p>And as we do that, a more complex picture starts to emerge.</p>
<p>It appears that the Anglo-Saxon invasion or uprising began in the eastern part of Britain.</p>
<p>We know that from both the written accounts and the archaeological record.</p>
<p>By the year 500, the Anglo-Saxons had conquered and occupied most of the eastern one-third</p>
<p>of Britain.</p>
<p>The western one-third was still occupied by native Celtic-speaking Britons.</p>
<p>And the middle one-third was a transitional region.</p>
<p>Another piece of evidence which confirms this settlement pattern is the names of the</p>
<p>various towns and cities throughout Britain.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which the Anglo-Saxons identified a particular place was with the</p>
<p>ending &ldquo;-ing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The suffix &ldquo;-ing&rdquo;, and its related suffix &ldquo;-ling&rdquo;, meant of or from.</p>
<p>And it was used to indicate that someone or something originated from a particular place.</p>
<p>If you enjoy science fiction movies, you probably are familiar with the term earthling.</p>
<p>It refers to the people from planet Earth.</p>
<p>What you might not know, though, is that the word earthling is an Anglo-Saxon word from</p>
<p>Old English.</p>
<p>Now its context has changed through the years.</p>
<p>It originally meant a ploughman or someone who lived on the land and worked the earth</p>
<p>or the soil.</p>
<p>The modern use of the term as an inhabitant of the planet Earth originated in the 16th</p>
<p>century.</p>
<p>And its one of the few words which still exist in modern English with that original Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>suffix to indicate the place where someone was from.</p>
<p>By the way, certain people in Scandinavia sailed up and down rivers and creeks and small</p>
<p>bays, and those waterways were called veiks.</p>
<p>These people sometimes robbed and plundered.</p>
<p>And since they were from the veiks, they were called veikings, or thanks to the later English</p>
<p>vowel shift, the vikings.</p>
<p>But again, we see that same Germanic-ing ending to indicate where they originated.</p>
<p>Well, the Anglo-Saxons used the same suffixes for place names.</p>
<p>For example, Hastings meant the people of Hesta, or the home of Hesta&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>Hesta may have been an early leader or founder of the settlement.</p>
<p>And Redding meant the people of Reata, or the home of Reata&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>Again, Reata may have been an early leader who founded the settlement.</p>
<p>Sometimes the suffix was combined with tan, T-O-N, which meant a fenced off estate or</p>
<p>enclosure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an early version of the modern English word town.</p>
<p>So ing-tan meant the people from the town of, or estate of someone.</p>
<p>And this gives us town names like Wellington, Donington, and Washington.</p>
<p>In fact, the small town of Washington in northern England meant the estate of the descendants</p>
<p>of Huesa.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know who Huesa was, but we do know that the name of the town is the ultimate</p>
<p>origin of the surname of George Washington.</p>
<p>And that means that it&rsquo;s the origin of Washington, D.C., and Washington State, and the many other</p>
<p>towns and cities named after George Washington in the United States.</p>
<p>Now sometimes the Anglo-Saxons combined the ing ending with ham, H-A-M.</p>
<p>Ham is an early version of the word home, or homestead.</p>
<p>So ing-ham meant the people from the home of someone.</p>
<p>So Birmingham meant home of Bearham&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>And that same ending gives us town names like Buckingham and Nottingham in the same</p>
<p>manner.</p>
<p>Well, all of those towns with that Anglo-Saxon suffix ing, whether it be ing or ing-tan or</p>
<p>ing-ham, they tend to be heavily concentrated in the eastern one-third of Britain, especially</p>
<p>in the southeast.</p>
<p>Now, there are certainly exceptions, but the fact that those endings are so concentrated</p>
<p>in the east indicates very early settlements in those regions by the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>And it also indicates that they didn&rsquo;t use existing Celtic place names.</p>
<p>In fact, they often didn&rsquo;t use existing Celtic towns at all.</p>
<p>They established new settlements with their own Anglo-Saxon names.</p>
<p>In other words, they lived in their own separate enclaves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually very likely that the Saxons largely displaced the native Celts in the</p>
<p>southeast of Britain.</p>
<p>The earliest invasions occurred there, and the total number of Anglo-Saxons was probably</p>
<p>at its greatest in that region.</p>
<p>And the concentration of town names with the ing ending in that region also suggests that</p>
<p>this is where the early Anglo-Saxons settled in the greatest numbers early on.</p>
<p>But as you move westward, the likelihood of a complete displacement of Celts is much lower.</p>
<p>Some of the native Romano-Celtic Britons fled westward to escape the Anglo-Saxons in the</p>
<p>east, and as they moved west, they helped the western Britons fortify their defenses</p>
<p>so that when the Anglo-Saxons began to move westward later on, they likely encountered</p>
<p>more resistance.</p>
<p>And we have some evidence of this process in the writings of Gildas.</p>
<p>He had described the devastation by the Anglo-Saxons early on, but then he mentioned a series of</p>
<p>British victories under a leader named Ambrosius Aurelianus.</p>
<p>And he mentioned that victory at Mount Baden, which halted the Anglo-Saxon advance for several</p>
<p>decades.</p>
<p>And later Britons in the west thought that the leader who defeated the Saxons at Mount</p>
<p>Baden was named Arthur, but we&rsquo;ll explore this connection a little later.</p>
<p>Now with respect to those battles mentioned by Gildas, we don&rsquo;t know where they were fought,</p>
<p>but many historians think those battles occurred in and around this transitional region in</p>
<p>the middle of Britain.</p>
<p>And in this transitional region between the Anglo-Saxon east and the Celtic-speaking west,</p>
<p>we should expect to see evidence of blended communities in which both groups lived in</p>
<p>close proximity to each other.</p>
<p>And if we look closely, we can see some evidence of that.</p>
<p>Once again, town names provide some clues.</p>
<p>In his book, The Etymologicon, Mark Forsyth notes that there are several towns in this</p>
<p>region, the West Midlands and Central Britain, where the town names are a blend of Celtic</p>
<p>and Anglo-Saxon names.</p>
<p>And that suggests that Celtic-speaking Britons were living with or at least in close proximity</p>
<p>to the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at some of those blended town names.</p>
<p>Now a Celtic word for hill was pen.</p>
<p>And that word appears in the name of the town of Pensax in this particular region.</p>
<p>As I said, pen meant hill and sax was a reference to the Saxons.</p>
<p>And it was used to indicate a Saxon settlement.</p>
<p>So this town name combined the Saxon suffix with the Celtic prefix.</p>
<p>Now some linguists and historians believe that this type of combined name indicates</p>
<p>that Saxon settlers were living in close proximity to the native Celtic-speaking people.</p>
<p>And in the process, the Saxons took a Celtic word for hill, which they heard and knew,</p>
<p>and they added it to their own Saxon name.</p>
<p>And the result was Pensax.</p>
<p>By the way, these same two words also form part of the name of a town in southern England</p>
<p>called Sixpenny-Hanley.</p>
<p>The sixpenny part comes from the same two root words as Pensax.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just reversed to create Saxpen.</p>
<p>And then they were further anglicized to become sixpenny.</p>
<p>Now very near the town of Pensax is a village called Minneth Wood.</p>
<p>Minneth was another Celtic word for hill or mountain.</p>
<p>And wood is obviously an English word.</p>
<p>So once again, we see in the name Minneth Wood a blending of a Celtic word and an Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>word.</p>
<p>Another example of this type of blending is the name of a large hill in northern England</p>
<p>called Pendle Hill.</p>
<p>Once again, we have that same Celtic word pen meaning hill.</p>
<p>But the Angles, who were the dominant Germanic tribe in this region, they apparently interpreted</p>
<p>pen as the actual name of the hill.</p>
<p>So they called it Pen Hill, which eventually became Pendle.</p>
<p>By the late Middle Ages, this original meaning was once again lost, and the people started</p>
<p>calling it Pendle Hill, apparently unaware that hill was already part of the name Pendle.</p>
<p>So today, Pendle Hill literally means hill, hill, hill.</p>
<p>But once again, we see Celtic terms blending in with English terms.</p>
<p>As we can see by now, the Celts had a lot of words for hills, and they also had the</p>
<p>word prae, which meant hill, and they had another word, din, which meant the same thing.</p>
<p>Now that word din was part of the original name of London, which was Londinium.</p>
<p>Well that Celtic word was a very old Celtic word, and it was also used by the Celtic-speaking</p>
<p>tribes back on the continent.</p>
<p>And the early Germanic tribes had picked it up along the way as well.</p>
<p>So this was another word which passed from the continental Celts to the early Germanic</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>And that word actually passed into Old English as dune, with the same original meaning, hill</p>
<p>or mountain.</p>
<p>So the Anglo-Saxons brought the word dune with them when they arrived in Britain.</p>
<p>And when the Anglo-Saxons encountered a large hill in the West Midlands of England, they</p>
<p>called it Praedun.</p>
<p>Once again, they combined the Celtic word prae, meaning hill, with the Old English word</p>
<p>dune, meaning hill, and the result was Praedun.</p>
<p>And just as with Pendle Hill, the original meaning was lost through the years, and eventually</p>
<p>people started calling it Praedun Hill.</p>
<p>So again, the literal meaning of the hill&rsquo;s name is hill, hill, hill.</p>
<p>And once again, we see Celtic words mixing with Old English words, implying some degree</p>
<p>of contact between the two groups.</p>
<p>By the way, the Old English pronunciation of dune changed through the years.</p>
<p>It eventually became down in modern English.</p>
<p>As a noun, it still has its original meaning.</p>
<p>In its plural form as hills, we see it in place names like Berkshire Downs, Dorset Downs,</p>
<p>and the Kentucky horse racing track, Churchill Downs.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons used the term of-dune to mean the process of traveling from the top</p>
<p>of a hill to the bottom.</p>
<p>Of-dune was eventually shortened to just dune, and that&rsquo;s the origin of the preposition</p>
<p>down, as in down the hole or down the hatch.</p>
<p>And you may be wondering if there&rsquo;s a connection to the modern English word dune, as in sand</p>
<p>dune.</p>
<p>And the answer is yes, there is a connection, in a roundabout way.</p>
<p>The early French borrowed that same word from the Germanic tribes back on the continent.</p>
<p>And that French version of the word came into English after the Norman conquest as dune,</p>
<p>d-u-n-e, and that&rsquo;s the version which is typically used in the context of a sand dune.</p>
<p>So all of that means that words like down, downs, and dune all come from the same root</p>
<p>as the dun in London.</p>
<p>They all come from a Celtic word meaning hill.</p>
<p>So as we see this type of blending of Celtic and Old English terms, we may have evidence</p>
<p>of Celtic-speaking Britons living in close proximity to the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>In the East, Anglo-Saxon town names dominate, like those ending in ing.</p>
<p>And in the far west, Celtic names dominate.</p>
<p>But we find these blended names in the central regions in between.</p>
<p>So this was likely a transitional region with Celtic speakers and Germanic speakers living</p>
<p>side by side.</p>
<p>And we may have additional evidence of this in the words which the Anglo-Saxons used to</p>
<p>refer to the Celtic Britons.</p>
<p>As we know by now, the Anglo-Saxons were a mixture of West Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But despite whatever tribal differences may have existed between them back on the continent,</p>
<p>when they arrived in Britain, they found themselves surrounded by people who were very different</p>
<p>from themselves.</p>
<p>From the Anglo-Saxon perspective, the native Celts spoke an odd language, they worshipped</p>
<p>strange gods, they had unusual religious practices, and they had different legal traditions and</p>
<p>political structures.</p>
<p>So it appears that an us-versus-them attitude developed very quickly among the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>And they viewed the native Britons as different, and perhaps even a little strange.</p>
<p>And they soon developed a word for those native Celtic-speaking Britons, with their strange</p>
<p>gods and languages and customs.</p>
<p>Ironically, the Anglo-Saxons called them foreigners.</p>
<p>And this is significant for two reasons.</p>
<p>It illustrates how the subtle differences between the various Anglo-Saxon groups began</p>
<p>to disappear very quickly once they were on the ground in Britain and they were mixing</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>But it also illustrates how they perceived the native people who they encountered.</p>
<p>For the Anglo-Saxons, Britain was now Anglo-Saxon land, and those other people who were already</p>
<p>there with their strange culture, well, they were now the foreigners.</p>
<p>The tables had basically been turned.</p>
<p>The Old English word for foreigner was hwela.</p>
<p>And this was what the Anglo-Saxons called the native Celtic-speaking Britons.</p>
<p>They called them hwelas.</p>
<p>And that term later evolved from waelus into welsh.</p>
<p>Early on, that term was applied to the Celtic Britons throughout the island, no matter where</p>
<p>they lived.</p>
<p>But over the centuries, as the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms grew, and the Celtic regions shrank,</p>
<p>the only places where the native Britons held on was in the west and in the far north.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why today, this western region of Britain is known as Wales, and its inhabitants</p>
<p>are the Welsh.</p>
<p>But early on, the term Welsh wasn&rsquo;t associated with any particular region of Britain.</p>
<p>It could refer to the natives regardless of where they lived.</p>
<p>Now if you&rsquo;re familiar with British history and Celtic history, you may be saying, what</p>
<p>about Cornwall?</p>
<p>Many Celtic-speaking Britons held on there as well, and a Celtic language continued to</p>
<p>be spoken there until very recently.</p>
<p>So why wasn&rsquo;t this place also called Wales?</p>
<p>Well, it kinda was.</p>
<p>The wal in Cornwall comes from that same Old English word, waela, which gives us Welsh</p>
<p>and Wales.</p>
<p>The original Celtic tribe that inhabited the region of Cornwall was called the Cornuig.</p>
<p>That was their native Celtic tribal name.</p>
<p>Now the corn part meant horn, and in fact, that root word corn was cognate with the Latin</p>
<p>word cornu, which also meant horn.</p>
<p>And if we go all the way back to Grimslaw, Latin cornu and English horn are cognate thanks</p>
<p>to that sound shift where the k sound became an h sound in the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>So obviously we&rsquo;re looking at a word with very deep Indo-European roots.</p>
<p>And so the corn in the name of the Cornuig tribe meant horn, and the tribal name meant</p>
<p>the people of the horn.</p>
<p>Now if that sounds kinda weird, look at Cornwall on a map.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a peninsula that sticks out into the ocean, and it resembles a horn.</p>
<p>So just like the name of the Angles came from the fact that their homeland looked like a</p>
<p>fish hook, the name of the Cornuig came from the fact that their homeland looked like a</p>
<p>horn.</p>
<p>Well, when the Anglo-Saxons encountered these people, they called the Cornuig the Cornwaelus,</p>
<p>literally the Corn Welsh or Corn Foreigners.</p>
<p>Over time, the name evolved into Cornwall.</p>
<p>So within the modern names Wales and Cornwall, we can still see how the original Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>viewed the native Celts as foreigners.</p>
<p>By the way, as a quick digression, the hazelnut was a very common and popular nut back in</p>
<p>Germania.</p>
<p>But the Romans had introduced a new nut there which was grown in Italy and Gaul.</p>
<p>The Germanic tribes back in Germania called this new imported nut a foreign nut, using</p>
<p>the same word, wæle.</p>
<p>They combined wæle, meaning foreign, and nutu, meaning nut, and this produced the word</p>
<p>walnut.</p>
<p>So Welsh, Wales, Cornwall, and walnut all have the same Germanic root, meaning foreign</p>
<p>or foreigner.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a fan of the movie Braveheart, you&rsquo;ll know that the Scottish leader who</p>
<p>fought the English was William Wallace.</p>
<p>Well, there really was a William Wallace, and ironically, even though the surname Wallace</p>
<p>is a Scottish surname, it originates from the same Germanic root word, meaning foreigner.</p>
<p>Now, you might be inclined to believe that the Anglo-Saxons applied this word meaning</p>
<p>foreigner to the native Britons after several centuries, after the Anglo-Saxons had established</p>
<p>their own kingdoms and they began to concern themselves with outside threats.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be the case.</p>
<p>In fact, it appears that the Anglo-Saxons used the term for the Britons very early on.</p>
<p>In fact, we see evidence of this early use in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the historical</p>
<p>record maintained by the later Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>Now even though the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was written many years later, its account</p>
<p>of this period provides a clear shift in terminology from Britons to Welsh.</p>
<p>The native people are initially referred to as the Britons in the entries up through the</p>
<p>year 456.</p>
<p>But after that date, the terminology shifts to Welsh, and that term is used from that</p>
<p>point on.</p>
<p>However, if the later chroniclers were relying upon old records, and if they were maintaining</p>
<p>that original terminology, then this term Welsh, meaning foreigner, was adopted very</p>
<p>early on.</p>
<p>In fact, based on that evidence, the term Welsh appeared shortly after the initial Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>invasion or uprising around the year 450.</p>
<p>So the Anglo-Saxons called the native Britons Wales, or Welsh, to mean foreigners.</p>
<p>But over time, the meaning expanded, and it eventually was used to mean slave, especially</p>
<p>in southwestern Britain.</p>
<p>And that shift in meaning is picked up from later Old English texts.</p>
<p>And the fact that the term Welsh was being used by Anglo-Saxons to mean a slave or serf</p>
<p>is very important because it implies that the Anglo-Saxons were the masters and the</p>
<p>native Britons were the slaves.</p>
<p>And that means that Britons were still living among the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>And if we go back to the last episode, one of the passages from Gildas stated that some</p>
<p>of the most unfortunate Britons had been taken into slavery by the Saxons rather than being</p>
<p>killed on the spot.</p>
<p>So we have strong evidence that some native Britons remained in the Anglo-Saxon regions</p>
<p>as forced servants.</p>
<p>And we have even more confirmation of this in a set of laws which were issued by the</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon King of Wessex in southwestern Britain in the late 600s.</p>
<p>The king was Enoch, and his laws were some of the first laws issued in the English language.</p>
<p>And those laws made specific provisions for the quote Welsh who were living there.</p>
<p>The Welsh were divided into different categories depending upon whether they were free or unfree,</p>
<p>and depending upon whether they owned land and how much land they owned.</p>
<p>So we know that the Celtic Britons were living under Anglo-Saxon rule in Wessex, but we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how many were there.</p>
<p>The later historian Bede also made reference to the fact that native Britons were living</p>
<p>under the rule of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>He noted that around the time of Enoch&rsquo;s laws, many of the Britons who were the subjects</p>
<p>of the West Saxons began to celebrate the Catholic Easter.</p>
<p>So by referring to these British subjects, we have further confirmation that the native</p>
<p>Britons were living among the West Saxons in Wessex.</p>
<p>Another piece of evidence is the fact that Welsh names were common among the political</p>
<p>and religious leaders of Wessex.</p>
<p>Names like Cadwala, Mull, Cadda, Conbran, Catwal.</p>
<p>And the existence of those names among people in prominent positions in Wessex implies some</p>
<p>degree of intermarriage between Celts and Saxons, and the family names were thereby</p>
<p>passed on.</p>
<p>Interestingly, those names began to disappear after the 8th century, implying that the power</p>
<p>of the Celts faded over time.</p>
<p>Now a few Celtic names also appear in other areas, even in Kent in the east and Northumbria</p>
<p>in the north.</p>
<p>And there may have even been Celtic names in the other regions as well, but early written</p>
<p>records are more lacking in those areas.</p>
<p>By the 10th century, the laws of London sentenced a runaway slave to be stoned, quote, like</p>
<p>a Welsh thief.</p>
<p>And in 11th century Cambridge, the compensation for slaying a Welshman was set at half of</p>
<p>the compensation required for killing an Englishman.</p>
<p>So all of these Anglo-Saxon laws imply that Celts were still living among the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no evidence of the language spoken by those native Britons.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s unlikely that their Celtic language would have died out overnight.</p>
<p>So we can conclude that, at least for a while, Celtic languages were being spoken in the</p>
<p>vicinity of Old English, especially in these western regions.</p>
<p>But that leaves us with that original mystery.</p>
<p>If the Anglo-Saxons were exposed to the Celtic languages, why aren&rsquo;t there more Celtic</p>
<p>influences in English?</p>
<p>Well maybe there are.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re just looking in the wrong places.</p>
<p>In the book Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue, John McWhorter argues that the Celtic influence</p>
<p>is there, maybe not in the vocabulary, but in the grammar.</p>
<p>And he points to two aspects of modern English grammar which can only be found elsewhere</p>
<p>in the Celtic languages.</p>
<p>The first example is the way modern English uses the word do and its variations did and</p>
<p>does.</p>
<p>Of course, we can use do to express emphasis, as in, I do like it, I really do.</p>
<p>And that isn&rsquo;t necessarily unique to English.</p>
<p>But what is unique is the way we use it in so many other contexts.</p>
<p>I mean, it really permeates the English language in a way that&rsquo;s very unusual compared to</p>
<p>other languages.</p>
<p>So whenever we ask questions, there&rsquo;s often a do in there somewhere.</p>
<p>So how do you do that?</p>
<p>Where did you go?</p>
<p>What did he say?</p>
<p>What do you like to eat?</p>
<p>When does she get here?</p>
<p>Did you go outside?</p>
<p>Does it surprise you?</p>
<p>Do you like it?</p>
<p>So there always seems to be a do hanging around.</p>
<p>And when we make negative statements, we routinely stick a do or a did in there somewhere.</p>
<p>Like, I do not like it.</p>
<p>He does not have any.</p>
<p>You do not look well.</p>
<p>It does not work.</p>
<p>She did not see him.</p>
<p>Again, English has this persistent use of do.</p>
<p>But if you really think about it, that do doesn&rsquo;t really do anything in those examples.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn&rsquo;t there in Old English, at least not in the many ways we tend to use</p>
<p>it today.</p>
<p>And in fact, no other languages use do like English does today except, you guessed it,</p>
<p>Celtic languages like Welsh and Cornish.</p>
<p>Those Celtic languages in Britain had this same type of grammatical feature when the</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxons arrived.</p>
<p>And after several centuries, by the period of Middle English, this piece of Celtic grammar</p>
<p>may have spread to English.</p>
<p>And today, it&rsquo;s a very prominent feature of English.</p>
<p>And John McWhorter also points to another aspect of English grammar to show the Celtic</p>
<p>influence.</p>
<p>This other aspect has to do with our basic present tense verbs.</p>
<p>If you were asked to conjugate a basic verb like listen in present tense, you would probably</p>
<p>say I listen, you listen, he, she, it listens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s technically the way to conjugate that verb in English.</p>
<p>But if I asked you what you&rsquo;re doing right now, you wouldn&rsquo;t say, I listen.</p>
<p>You would say, I am listening.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t say, I speak.</p>
<p>I would say, I am speaking.</p>
<p>That basic verb form, like I speak, or I listen, or I read, I sleep, that was the basic verb</p>
<p>form of present tense in Old English.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the basic verb form of present tense in other languages, including other</p>
<p>Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>But in modern English, we rarely use it.</p>
<p>We almost always use the verb phrase, am speaking or am listening.</p>
<p>Now we do sometimes use that basic form of the verb, if you want to indicate that you</p>
<p>do something on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So if I asked you what you do whenever you find out there&rsquo;s a new episode of the podcast,</p>
<p>you might say, I listen.</p>
<p>And if you ask Paul McCartney what he does for a living, he might say, I sing, or I play</p>
<p>guitar, or I write songs.</p>
<p>So we do use that basic form of the verb in present tense.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been relegated to this limited situation, where we&rsquo;re indicating that something</p>
<p>happens on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the default form in modern English is that longer, more complicated verb phrase,</p>
<p>am singing, am playing, or am writing.</p>
<p>Again, this ing verb phrase wasn&rsquo;t used that way as the default form in Old English.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not used that way in other Indo-European languages, with one exception.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s the Celtic languages.</p>
<p>The Celtic languages in Britain had this same type of present tense conjugation.</p>
<p>So McWhorter argues that this feature of modern English occurred when the Anglo-Saxons encountered</p>
<p>the Celtic-speaking Britons.</p>
<p>That in fact, they did live together, at least in parts of Britain.</p>
<p>And that some of the aspects of the Celtic languages changed English during the period</p>
<p>of Late Old English and Middle English.</p>
<p>So that by the time we get into the Middle English period, this feature of English had</p>
<p>changed.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in exploring this research further, check out John McWhorter&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available as an e-book and also as an audio book.</p>
<p>Now all this research, the genetic research, the archaeological research, and the linguistic</p>
<p>research, it all suggests that the traditional view of the Celtic legacy was wrong.</p>
<p>The Celtic Britons were not completely wiped out in England.</p>
<p>And Old English was not immune from Celtic influences.</p>
<p>Instead, at least in parts of England, there was a blending of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon peoples</p>
<p>and languages and cultures.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, the Anglo-Saxon influences dominated.</p>
<p>There might be a bit more Celtic influence on English than we once thought, but it still</p>
<p>pales in comparison to the influences of Old Norse and Norman French.</p>
<p>And that suggests that the Celts were not fully integrated into the Anglo-Saxon society.</p>
<p>They likely lived at the margins, as slaves and serfs.</p>
<p>And even when they were free, they held a far inferior status in Anglo-Saxon society.</p>
<p>But their influences still came through.</p>
<p>And if we look close enough, we can see those influences.</p>
<p>And those influences sometimes found their way into English culture in strange and roundabout</p>
<p>ways.</p>
<p>In fact, when we think of medieval England, after the Norman conquest, many of us instinctively</p>
<p>think of the legendary figure of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.</p>
<p>Now those legendary stories have become synonymous with medieval Britain, yet these stories didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>originate with the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>They originated with the Celts.</p>
<p>And in fact, they originated as stories of resistance against the Anglo-Saxons during</p>
<p>this early period in the 5th and 6th centuries.</p>
<p>So I want to conclude this episode about the Celtic legacy by exploring how the early</p>
<p>Celtic resistance movement gave rise to the legendary figure of King Arthur, a king of</p>
<p>all of Britain.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Anglo-Saxon invasions, many Celtic Britons had apparently been relegated</p>
<p>to slaves within the new Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.</p>
<p>And the only places where they maintained their independence were on the western fringes</p>
<p>of the island and in the far north and across the sea in Brittany.</p>
<p>But many of these Celtic Britons saw this as a temporary condition.</p>
<p>They imagined that the tide would one day turn and that Britons would once again rise</p>
<p>up and reclaim their island.</p>
<p>But in order for this to happen, the Celtic Britons needed a hero, a hero that would one</p>
<p>day return to fight the Saxons.</p>
<p>And this appears to be the origin of the early legends in Wales and Cornwall and Brittany</p>
<p>about a military leader named Arthur, a leader who had supposedly fought the Saxons and a</p>
<p>leader who would one day return to fight them again.</p>
<p>As we saw in the last episode, the actual written accounts from this period are very</p>
<p>limited and none of the sources from this period actually mention a king or a military</p>
<p>leader named Arthur.</p>
<p>But shortly after this period, written references to Arthur start to pop up throughout the Celtic</p>
<p>regions.</p>
<p>And at least early on, the references suggest that Arthur was an actual person, a real-life</p>
<p>historical figure.</p>
<p>So was there really a Celtic leader named Arthur who fought the Saxons?</p>
<p>Well there have been numerous books written about this subject and I&rsquo;m certainly not</p>
<p>going to provide a definitive answer here, but let&rsquo;s look at the evidence to see how</p>
<p>this mysterious figure emerged.</p>
<p>There seems to be a general agreement among historians that something happened in the</p>
<p>late 5th century and early 6th century which led to the creation of these later stories</p>
<p>and legends.</p>
<p>And we know by now that the only contemporary accounts of events from within Britain during</p>
<p>this period was the Sermon of Gildas.</p>
<p>And Gildas mentioned that the Britons had fought back against the Saxons and they won</p>
<p>that great victory at a place called Mons Bodonagus in Latin or Mount Baden in English.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t say where that battle occurred and he didn&rsquo;t say who the military leader</p>
<p>was who won that battle.</p>
<p>Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t mention the name because he was writing to the people of his day and</p>
<p>they all knew who the leader was.</p>
<p>But based on later writings, it becomes apparent that the Celtic Britons considered this a</p>
<p>monumental victory.</p>
<p>It became legendary in the minds of many Britons because it proved that the Saxons could be</p>
<p>turned back.</p>
<p>And those later sources gave credit for the victory to a leader named Arthur.</p>
<p>In the years after Gildas, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms began to rise again and the Celtic</p>
<p>kingdoms squabbled amongst themselves and they were unable to mount an effective defense.</p>
<p>And they soon lost the remainder of western Britain to the Saxons except for Cornwall</p>
<p>and Wales.</p>
<p>And it was in these regions and in Brittany that the legend of Mount Baden and Arthur</p>
<p>really started to grow.</p>
<p>Just as the Anglo-Saxons completed their conquest in the 7th century, the first historical references</p>
<p>to Arthur appear.</p>
<p>A Welsh poem from the early 7th century called Eegadothan makes reference to a shadowy figure</p>
<p>named Arthur.</p>
<p>And in praising a soldier who&rsquo;d fought bravely against the Saxons, it conditions the praise</p>
<p>by noting that, quote, he was no Arthur.</p>
<p>And a later chronicle of events compiled from a variety of Welsh sources also makes reference</p>
<p>to Arthur.</p>
<p>The chronicle, which is called the Welsh Annals, probably began in the 9th century.</p>
<p>But the first entries date all the way back to the 5th century.</p>
<p>So they were written down at a later date.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know what the original sources were, so we don&rsquo;t know how reliable those</p>
<p>early entries are.</p>
<p>But for the year 518, the Welsh Annals specifically state that a military leader named Arthur</p>
<p>won the Battle of Baden against the Saxons.</p>
<p>Now if this entry is accurate, it&rsquo;s the first reference to Arthur being the victor at Baden.</p>
<p>The Annals also state that Arthur and Medraught were killed at a separate battle in the year</p>
<p>539.</p>
<p>Now many historians believe that Medraught was an early version of Mordred, the traitor</p>
<p>who challenged Arthur&rsquo;s power and who was the primary villain in the later legends.</p>
<p>Again, we can&rsquo;t say with certainty how accurate these references are, but it seems clear that</p>
<p>the legend of Arthur was in place and was growing quickly.</p>
<p>And then we get to the big reference to Arthur, the source that&rsquo;s often cited as the first</p>
<p>real reference to the figure that we would come to know in the later accounts.</p>
<p>And that reference comes to us via a Welsh monk named Ninnius.</p>
<p>In the year 828, he published a history which he called the History of the Britons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating book, but it&rsquo;s a bit of a stretch to call it a history.</p>
<p>It actually mixed folklore with history.</p>
<p>But despite the fact that Ninnius takes a lot of liberties, he does appear to mix in</p>
<p>some actual history with his stories.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s difficult to determine what&rsquo;s history and what&rsquo;s legend.</p>
<p>But the reason why the book is important to the history of Arthur is because it provides</p>
<p>a specific list of Arthur&rsquo;s battles.</p>
<p>The list of battles probably came from a long lost battle song which commemorated certain</p>
<p>British victories.</p>
<p>And Ninnius says that Arthur fought, quote, with the kings of Britain, but he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>identify Arthur himself as a king.</p>
<p>And Ninnius then lists each battle and of the last one he writes, quote, the twelfth</p>
<p>battle was on Mount Badon in which there fell in one day 960 men from one charge by Arthur.</p>
<p>And no one struck them down except Arthur himself.</p>
<p>And in all the wars he emerged as victor, end quote.</p>
<p>So by this point, in the 9th century, Arthur had clearly become associated with that legendary</p>
<p>victory at Mount Badon.</p>
<p>And tales of Arthur and his victory at Badon thrive not only in western Britain but also</p>
<p>in Brittany and northern Gaul.</p>
<p>And in fact, the legend of Arthur may have been greater in Brittany than in Britain itself.</p>
<p>In the 11th century, a monk in Brittany named William wrote about the life of a Breton bishop</p>
<p>and later saint who was one of the many who migrated from southern Britain in the wake</p>
<p>of the Anglo-Saxon invasions.</p>
<p>And in his history, William wrote that the Saxon&rsquo;s pride was, quote, limited for a while</p>
<p>through the great Arthur, king of the Britons, end quote.</p>
<p>He then writes that this same Arthur won many glorious victories in Britain and in Gaul.</p>
<p>Now William&rsquo;s history is notable because it&rsquo;s the first source to describe Arthur as a king</p>
<p>and it says he won victories in Britain and in Gaul.</p>
<p>Now this has led some historians to conclude that William was actually referring to a British</p>
<p>king who was hanging out in Gaul named Riothamus or Riothamus using the Latin pronunciation</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>Now I mentioned Riothamus in the last episode because a bishop in Gaul named Sidonius wrote</p>
<p>a letter to him which referenced the Bretons in northern Gaul and I noted that the later</p>
<p>Frankish historian, Giordanus, called Riothamus the king of the Britons even though he was</p>
<p>fighting in Gaul.</p>
<p>So is there a possible link between this guy Riothamus and the later figure of Arthur?</p>
<p>Well there is an interesting linguistic connection and to understand this connection we have</p>
<p>to consider the name Arthur.</p>
<p>First where did the name Arthur come from?</p>
<p>Well no one knows for sure but it could be a personal name or family name.</p>
<p>There is a Celtic name, Archer, which means bear.</p>
<p>Maybe that was the source of the name.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a Roman family name, Artorius, so maybe that was the source.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also possible that the name Arthur wasn&rsquo;t initially a personal name at all.</p>
<p>It may have been a title.</p>
<p>In fact many prominent people of this period were named after their title and later generations</p>
<p>often mistakenly assumed that the title was a personal name.</p>
<p>So for example, according to later writers, the British king who invited the Saxons into</p>
<p>Britain in the first place was called Vortigern and some later linguists have concluded that</p>
<p>the name Vortigern was really a title which meant overlord.</p>
<p>Well some historians believe that Arthur was also initially a Celtic title.</p>
<p>In the Celtic languages, the word Arthur meant high or supreme and reeks meant king.</p>
<p>In fact we&rsquo;ve come across reeks a lot in this podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cognate with rex meaning king in Latin where it produced later words like royal and</p>
<p>regal.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s cognate with the English word rich and you might also remember from our look</p>
<p>at the Goths that it ultimately produced the reek in Puerto Rico and even the rih in</p>
<p>America.</p>
<p>Well here it is again.</p>
<p>The Celts used their version of the word reeks to mean king as well.</p>
<p>And again the supreme king in the Celtic languages was a combination of the word arthu and reeks</p>
<p>and that produced a new word, Arthri.</p>
<p>Arthri meant the supreme king and it may have been the original title of a prominent</p>
<p>figure who was considered a king of the Britons, either a real person or a legendary figure.</p>
<p>And Arthri may have become Arthur.</p>
<p>So you may be asking what does all that have to do with that guy Rheothamnes who was also</p>
<p>called a king of the Britons.</p>
<p>Well Rheothamnes is also a title not an actual personal name and the title also means supreme</p>
<p>king and in fact it&rsquo;s composed of the same two Celtic words which make up the title Arthri.</p>
<p>And if you have a hard time hearing the connection between Arthri and Rheothamnes, all you have</p>
<p>to do is reverse the two Celtic root words.</p>
<p>High king is arthu plus re producing Arthri.</p>
<p>But when you reverse those two root words you get re plus arthu and that gives you Rhearthu</p>
<p>or thanks to a Latin translation Rheothamnes.</p>
<p>So Arthu and Rheothamnes can both be derived from the same Celtic title meaning high king</p>
<p>or supreme king with the two Celtic root words simply being reversed between the two titles.</p>
<p>And we can combine that linguistic connection with Jordanus who described Rheothamnes as</p>
<p>king of the Britons even though he was in Gaul.</p>
<p>And we can then add in William&rsquo;s history who talks about Arthur and gives Arthur the</p>
<p>same title as Rheothamnes, king of the Britons.</p>
<p>And William specifically notes that Arthur won victories in both Britain and Gaul.</p>
<p>So when we put all those pieces together you can see why some historians have concluded</p>
<p>that this guy Rheothamnes was in fact the original Arthur.</p>
<p>And maybe he was but the reality is that there probably was no single Arthur.</p>
<p>The legendary figure of Arthur was likely a combination of several prominent figures</p>
<p>associated with the Celtic resistance during this period.</p>
<p>And Rheothamnes was likely one of those figures especially in the versions of the stories</p>
<p>told in Brittany.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier the legends surrounding this mysterious figure of Arthur were as popular</p>
<p>in Brittany in northern France as anywhere in Britain itself.</p>
<p>And throughout Brittany during this period it&rsquo;s recorded that people sang songs about</p>
<p>Arthur and his battles against the Saxons.</p>
<p>And by the 11th century the Bretons had become allied with their neighbors, the Normans.</p>
<p>And these were the same Normans who invaded England in 1066 under the leadership of William,</p>
<p>Duke of Normandy.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where the story of Arthur comes full circle.</p>
<p>We always refer to the Norman conquest of the Anglo-Saxons in 1066.</p>
<p>But in actuality about one-third of William&rsquo;s army was actually Breton, not Norman.</p>
<p>In fact the entire left flank of William&rsquo;s army at the Battle of Hastings was Breton.</p>
<p>They were William&rsquo;s allies in northern France and they were descendants of the Bretons who</p>
<p>had fled the Anglo-Saxons several centuries earlier.</p>
<p>And throughout that period in exile in northern France they had developed songs and poems</p>
<p>and stories about the legendary figure of Arthur.</p>
<p>And part of their support of William was based on political alliances and perhaps opportunism.</p>
<p>But for the rank-and-file Breton soldiers it may also have been a matter of vengeance.</p>
<p>As the descendants of Bretons who had fled the Saxon onslaught over five centuries earlier,</p>
<p>they now had their opportunity to return to their ancestral homeland.</p>
<p>To bring the fight back to the Saxons.</p>
<p>And they did so singing the songs of Arthur.</p>
<p>After the Norman conquest, the songs of the Bretons blended with the poems and legends</p>
<p>of the Cornish and the Welsh.</p>
<p>The story of Arthur was now almost fully realized.</p>
<p>In the figure of Arthur the Normans didn&rsquo;t choose a Norman hero or a Saxon hero.</p>
<p>They adopted a Celtic British hero.</p>
<p>And whether it was intentional or not, it was definitely good propaganda.</p>
<p>It helped the Normans to depict the Saxons as treacherous occupiers.</p>
<p>And in the wake of the Norman conquest, the feudal system was introduced into Britain.</p>
<p>And that included a new class of military leaders called knights.</p>
<p>And it included the medieval concept of chivalry.</p>
<p>And we now have the full transition of Arthur.</p>
<p>From a dark age Celtic warrior fighting against the Anglo-Saxons to a medieval British king</p>
<p>surrounded by castles and knights and bound by the medieval code of chivalry.</p>
<p>From here, the Welsh writer Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote his History of the Kings of Britain</p>
<p>in 1138.</p>
<p>And this was the first proper telling of the myth of Arthur.</p>
<p>His history covers the early Anglo-Saxon period from the Roman withdrawal to the Saxon</p>
<p>uprising.</p>
<p>And he tells the story of Arthur as he bravely fought and defeated the Saxons.</p>
<p>In fact, Arthur defeats almost everyone along the way.</p>
<p>He defeats the Picts and the Scots.</p>
<p>And after he marries Guinevere he sails to Iceland and Ireland where he conquers the</p>
<p>peoples in those regions as well.</p>
<p>Then he invades Norway and Denmark and adds them to his empire.</p>
<p>He then turns his attention southward to Gaul.</p>
<p>And as we might expect at this point he conquers Gaul too.</p>
<p>And then he decides it&rsquo;s time to teach Rome a lesson as well.</p>
<p>So he fights and defeats a giant and then he leads his soldiers into battle against</p>
<p>the Romans.</p>
<p>And you guessed it, he beats the Romans too.</p>
<p>And he even decides to cross the Alps and invade Rome itself.</p>
<p>But then he gets the news that Mordred has seized power back in Britain and is living</p>
<p>with Guinevere.</p>
<p>Mordred has formed an alliance with the Saxons and the Picts and the Scots.</p>
<p>So Arthur returns to Britain and he fights several battles against Mordred.</p>
<p>And Mordred is killed but ultimately so is Arthur.</p>
<p>And at death Arthur&rsquo;s body was taken to the Isle of Avalon.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Geoffrey&rsquo;s story in a nutshell.</p>
<p>And Geoffrey&rsquo;s story was expanded by later writers.</p>
<p>But the popularity of Geoffrey&rsquo;s story was so great that almost all the later versions</p>
<p>are roughly based around his original version.</p>
<p>Of course Geoffrey wasn&rsquo;t really an historian.</p>
<p>He only used history as a backdrop to set the scene.</p>
<p>His main focus was on telling a good story.</p>
<p>And perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised that Geoffrey himself was part Welsh and part</p>
<p>Breton.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d grown up with the legend of Arthur on both sides of the Channel.</p>
<p>And he fused those elements together into the first proper telling of the legend of</p>
<p>Arthur.</p>
<p>Now the later French poet Chrétien de Troyes added the characters of Lancelot, Galahad,</p>
<p>and Percival.</p>
<p>And he introduced the quest for the Holy Grail.</p>
<p>And he also invented the name Camelot and said that Arthur&rsquo;s court was located there.</p>
<p>And all these stories ultimately culminated with Sir Thomas Mallory&rsquo;s La Mort d&rsquo;Arthur</p>
<p>in 1485.</p>
<p>And Mallory gives us the final version of the story complete with Merlin and the sword</p>
<p>Excalibur and the affair of Guinevere and Lancelot.</p>
<p>So as we look back at the most legendary of British kings, the once and future king</p>
<p>of all of Britain, we see part of the legacy of the Celts.</p>
<p>I mean they didn&rsquo;t really disappear from Anglo-Saxon England.</p>
<p>They were always there.</p>
<p>We see it in the ancient legends.</p>
<p>We see it in DNA research.</p>
<p>We see it in the place names and old legal codes.</p>
<p>And we even see it in the English language if we look hard enough for it.</p>
<p>So with that, I&rsquo;m going to conclude this episode.</p>
<p>Next time, we&rsquo;ll complete our look at the 5th and 6th centuries by turning our attention</p>
<p>back to continental Europe to see what was happening to the Saxons who remained back</p>
<p>in northern Germany.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll examine the emergence of the modern High German dialects during this period.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll look at the rise of the Frankish kingdom in Gaul.</p>
<p>And with it, we&rsquo;ll look at the surprising number of English words which can be traced</p>
<p>back to the Franks.</p>
<p>So all of that will be in the next episode.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
