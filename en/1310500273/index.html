    <p>The following is a conversation with Lee Cronin,</p>
<p>a chemist from University of Glasgow,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of the most fascinating, brilliant,</p>
<p>out of the box thinking scientists I&rsquo;ve ever spoken to.</p>
<p>This episode was recorded more than two weeks ago,</p>
<p>so the war in Ukraine is not mentioned.</p>
<p>I have been spending a lot of time each day</p>
<p>talking to people in Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>I have family, friends, colleagues,</p>
<p>and loved ones in both countries.</p>
<p>I will try to release a solo episode on this war,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been failing to find the words</p>
<p>that make sense of it for myself and others,</p>
<p>so I may not.</p>
<p>I ask for your understanding no matter which path I take.</p>
<p>Most of my time is spent trying to help</p>
<p>as much as I can privately.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to people who are suffering,</p>
<p>who are angry, afraid.</p>
<p>When I returned to this conversation with Lee,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a beautiful, brilliant, and hilarious human being.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s basically a human manifestation</p>
<p>of the mad scientist Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty.</p>
<p>I thought about quitting this podcast for a time,</p>
<p>but for now at least, I&rsquo;ll keep going.</p>
<p>I love people too much.</p>
<p>You, the listener.</p>
<p>I meet folks on the street or when I run.</p>
<p>You say a few kind words about the podcast</p>
<p>and we talk about life, the small things,</p>
<p>and the big things.</p>
<p>All of it gives me hope.</p>
<p>People are just amazing.</p>
<p>You are amazing.</p>
<p>I ask for your support, wisdom, and patience</p>
<p>as I keep going with this silly little podcast,</p>
<p>including through some difficult conversations</p>
<p>and hopefully many fascinating and fun ones too.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Lee Cronin.</p>
<p>How do you think life originated on Earth</p>
<p>and what insights does that give us about life?</p>
<p>If we go back to the origin of Earth</p>
<p>and you think about maybe 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 billion years ago,</p>
<p>the planet was quite hot.</p>
<p>There was a limited number of minerals.</p>
<p>There was some carbon, some water, and I think</p>
<p>that maybe it&rsquo;s a really simple set of chemistry</p>
<p>that we really don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>So that means you&rsquo;ve got a finite number of elements</p>
<p>that are going to react very simply with one another</p>
<p>and out of that mess comes a cell.</p>
<p>So literally sand turns into cells</p>
<p>and it seems to happen quick.</p>
<p>So what I think I can say with some degree of,</p>
<p>I think not certainty, but curiosity,</p>
<p>genuine curiosity is that life happened fast.</p>
<p>Yeah, so when we say fast,</p>
<p>this is a pretty surprising fact</p>
<p>and maybe you can actually correct me and elaborate,</p>
<p>but it seems like most, like 70 or 80% of the time</p>
<p>that Earth has been around, there&rsquo;s been life on it,</p>
<p>like some very significant percentage.</p>
<p>So when you say fast, like the slow part</p>
<p>is from single cell or from bacteria</p>
<p>to something more complicated, organisms.</p>
<p>It seems like most of the time that Earth has been around,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been single cell or like very basic organisms,</p>
<p>like a couple billion years.</p>
<p>But yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, I recently kind of revisited our history</p>
<p>and saw this and I was just looking at the timeline.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, like how did life just spring up so quickly?</p>
<p>Like really quickly.</p>
<p>That makes me think that it really wanted to.</p>
<p>Like put another way, it&rsquo;s very easy for life to spring.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree, I think it&rsquo;s much more inevitable</p>
<p>and I think I try to kind of, not provoke,</p>
<p>but try and push chemists to think about,</p>
<p>because chemists are central to this problem, right?</p>
<p>Of understanding the origin of life on Earth, at least,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re made of chemistry.</p>
<p>But I wonder if the origin of life on a planet,</p>
<p>or sorry, the emergence of life on the planet is as,</p>
<p>common as the formation of a star.</p>
<p>And if you start framing it in that way,</p>
<p>it allows you to then look at the universe</p>
<p>slightly differently, because,</p>
<p>and we can get into this, I think, in quite some detail,</p>
<p>but I think, to come back to your question,</p>
<p>I have little idea of how life got started,</p>
<p>but I know it was simple.</p>
<p>And I know that the process of selection</p>
<p>had to occur before the, by the end of the day,</p>
<p>the selection had to occur before the biology</p>
<p>was established, so that selection built the framework</p>
<p>from which life kind of grew in complexity</p>
<p>and capability and functionality and autonomy.</p>
<p>And I think these are all really important words</p>
<p>that we can unpack over the next while.</p>
<p>Can you say all the words again?</p>
<p>So you said selection, so natural selection,</p>
<p>the original A, B testing.</p>
<p>And so, and then complexity,</p>
<p>and then the degree of autonomy and sophistication,</p>
<p>because I think that people misunderstand what life is.</p>
<p>Some people say that life is a cell,</p>
<p>and some people that say that life is a virus</p>
<p>or life is an on off switch.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that,</p>
<p>life is the universe developing a memory.</p>
<p>And the laws of physics and the way,</p>
<p>well, there are no laws of physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just memory free stuff, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s only a finite number of ways</p>
<p>you can arrange the fundamental particles to do things.</p>
<p>Life is the universe developing a memory.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like sewing a piece of art slowly,</p>
<p>and then you can look back at it.</p>
<p>So, so there&rsquo;s a stickiness to life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like universe doing stuff.</p>
<p>And when you say memory, it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a stickiness</p>
<p>to a bunch of the stuff that&rsquo;s building together.</p>
<p>So like you can, in a stable way,</p>
<p>like trace back the complexity</p>
<p>and that tells a coherent story.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s, by the way, very poetic and beautiful.</p>
<p>Life is the universe developing a memory.</p>
<p>Okay, and then there&rsquo;s autonomy,</p>
<p>you said complexity we&rsquo;ll talk about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really interesting idea</p>
<p>that selection preceded biology.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think.</p>
<p>So first of all, what is chemistry?</p>
<p>Like does sand still count as chemistry?</p>
<p>Sure, I mean, as a chemist, a card carrying chemist,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m allowed a card, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know what I am most days, actually.</p>
<p>What is a card made of?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the chemical composition of the card?</p>
<p>So what is chemistry?</p>
<p>Well, chemistry is the thing that happens</p>
<p>when you bring electrons together and you form bonds.</p>
<p>So bonds, well, I say to people</p>
<p>when they talk about life elsewhere,</p>
<p>and I just say, well, there&rsquo;s bonds, there&rsquo;s hope,</p>
<p>because bonds allow you to get heterogeneity.</p>
<p>They allow you to record those memories,</p>
<p>or at least on Earth.</p>
<p>You could imagine a Stanislav Lemtri world</p>
<p>where you might have life emerging</p>
<p>or intelligence emerging before life.</p>
<p>That may be something like Solaris or something,</p>
<p>but to get to selection,</p>
<p>if you can form, if atoms can combine and form bonds,</p>
<p>those bonds, those atoms can bond to different elements</p>
<p>and those molecules will have different identities</p>
<p>and interact with each other differently,</p>
<p>and then you can start to have some degree of causation</p>
<p>or interaction and then selection and then existence.</p>
<p>And then you go up the kind of the path of complexity.</p>
<p>And so at least on Earth, as we know it,</p>
<p>there is a sufficient pool of available chemicals</p>
<p>to start searching that combinatorial space of bonds.</p>
<p>So, okay, this is a really interesting question.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s lay it out.</p>
<p>So bonds, almost like cards.</p>
<p>We say there&rsquo;s bonds, there is life,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s intelligence, there&rsquo;s consciousness.</p>
<p>And what you just made me realize is</p>
<p>that those can emerge, let&rsquo;s put bonds aside,</p>
<p>those can emerge in any order.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really brilliant.</p>
<p>So intelligence can come before life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like panpsychists believe that consciousness,</p>
<p>I guess, comes before life and before intelligence.</p>
<p>So consciousness permeates all matter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some kind of fabric of reality.</p>
<p>Okay, so like within this framework,</p>
<p>you can kind of arrange everything,</p>
<p>but you need to have the bonds</p>
<p>that precedes everything else.</p>
<p>Oh, and the other thing is selection.</p>
<p>So like the mechanism of selection, that could proceed.</p>
<p>See, couldn&rsquo;t that proceed bonds too?</p>
<p>Whatever the hell selection is.</p>
<p>So I would say that there is an elegant order to it.</p>
<p>Bonds allow selection, allows the emergence of life,</p>
<p>allows the emergence of multicellularity</p>
<p>and then more information processing,</p>
<p>building state machines all the way up.</p>
<p>However, you could imagine a situation if you had,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, a neutron star or a sun</p>
<p>or what a ferromagnetic loops interacting with one another</p>
<p>and these oscillators building state machines</p>
<p>and these state machines reading something</p>
<p>out in the environment.</p>
<p>Over time, these state machines would be able</p>
<p>to literally record what happened in the past</p>
<p>and sense what&rsquo;s going on in the present</p>
<p>and imagine the future.</p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s ever gonna be</p>
<p>within a human comprehension, that type of life.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t count it out because whenever you say,</p>
<p>I know in science, whenever I say something&rsquo;s impossible,</p>
<p>I then wake up the next day and say,</p>
<p>no, that&rsquo;s actually wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, there are some limits, of course.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see myself traveling fast and light anytime soon,</p>
<p>but&hellip;</p>
<p>Eric Weinstein says that&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>so he will say you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>Sure, but I&rsquo;m an experimentalist as well,</p>
<p>so one of my, I have two superpowers.</p>
<p>My stupidity, and I don&rsquo;t mean that as a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like absolutely completely witless,</p>
<p>but I mean my ability to kind of just start again</p>
<p>and ask the question and then do it with an experiment.</p>
<p>I always wanted to be a theoretician growing up,</p>
<p>but I just didn&rsquo;t have the intellectual capability,</p>
<p>but I was able to think of experiments in my head</p>
<p>I could then do in my lab or when I was a child outside</p>
<p>and then those experiments in my head</p>
<p>and then outside reinforced one another.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a very good way of kind of</p>
<p>grounding the science, right?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a nice way to think about theoreticians</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re just people who run experiments in their head.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s exactly what Einstein did, right?</p>
<p>But you were also capable of doing that in the head,</p>
<p>in your head, inside your head and in the real world</p>
<p>and the connection between the two</p>
<p>is when you first discovered your superpower stupidity.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Yes, there you go.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the second superpower?</p>
<p>Your accent or is that?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I am genuinely curious.</p>
<p>So I have, like everybody, ego problems,</p>
<p>but my curiosity is bigger than my ego.</p>
<p>So as long as that happens, I can cope.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>That is so powerful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just dropping some powerful lines.</p>
<p>So curiosity is bigger than ego.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I have to think about</p>
<p>because you always struggle about the role of ego in life</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s so nice to think about,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think about the size of ego,</p>
<p>the absolute size of ego.</p>
<p>Think about the relative size of ego</p>
<p>to the other horses pulling at you.</p>
<p>If the curiosity one is bigger,</p>
<p>then ego will do just fine and make you fun to talk to.</p>
<p>Anyway, so those are the two superpowers.</p>
<p>How do those connect to natural selection</p>
<p>or selection and bonds and, I forgot already,</p>
<p>life and consciousness?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going back to selection in the universe</p>
<p>and origin of life on Earth.</p>
<p>I mean, selection, I&rsquo;m convinced that selection</p>
<p>is a force in the universe.</p>
<p>Not a fundamental force, but it is a directing force</p>
<p>because existence, although existence appears</p>
<p>to be the default, the existence of what,</p>
<p>why does, and we can get to this later, I think,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s amazing that discrete things exist</p>
<p>and you see this cup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the sexiest cup in the world,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty functional.</p>
<p>This cup, the complexity of this cup</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just in the object.</p>
<p>It is literally the lineage of people making cups</p>
<p>and recognizing that, seeing that in their head,</p>
<p>making an abstraction of a cup,</p>
<p>and then making a different one.</p>
<p>So I wonder how many billions of cups</p>
<p>have come before this one,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the process of selection and existence,</p>
<p>and the only reason the cup is still used</p>
<p>is quite useful.</p>
<p>I like the handle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s convenient, so I don&rsquo;t die.</p>
<p>I keep hydration, and so I think we are missing</p>
<p>something fundamental in the universe about selection,</p>
<p>and I think what biology is is a selection amplifier,</p>
<p>and that this is where autonomy comes in,</p>
<p>and actually I think that how humanity is gonna,</p>
<p>humans and autonomous robots,</p>
<p>or whatever we&rsquo;re gonna call them in the future,</p>
<p>will supercharge that even further.</p>
<p>So selection is happening in the universe,</p>
<p>but if you look in the asteroid belt,</p>
<p>selection, if objects are being kicked in and out</p>
<p>of the asteroid belt, those trajectories are quite complex.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really look at that as productive selection</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not doing anything to improve its function,</p>
<p>but is it?</p>
<p>The asteroid belt has existed for some time,</p>
<p>so there is some selection going on,</p>
<p>but the functionality is somewhat limited.</p>
<p>On Earth, at the formation of Earth,</p>
<p>interaction of chemicals and molecules in the environment</p>
<p>gave selection, and then things could happen,</p>
<p>because you could think about, in chemistry,</p>
<p>we could have an infinite number of reactions happen,</p>
<p>but all the reactions that are allowed to happen</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t happen, why?</p>
<p>Because there are energy barriers.</p>
<p>So there must be some things called catalysts out there,</p>
<p>or there are bits of minerals that,</p>
<p>when two molecules get together in that mineral,</p>
<p>it lowers the energy barrier for the reaction,</p>
<p>and so the reaction is promoted.</p>
<p>So suddenly you get one reaction over another</p>
<p>series of possibilities occurring</p>
<p>that makes a particular molecule,</p>
<p>and this keeps happening in steps,</p>
<p>and before you know it,</p>
<p>almost these waves as discrete reactions work together,</p>
<p>and you start to build a machinery</p>
<p>that is run by existence.</p>
<p>So as you go forward in time,</p>
<p>the fact that the molecules, the bonds are getting,</p>
<p>there are more bonds in a molecule,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more function,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more capability for this molecule</p>
<p>to interact with other molecules, to redirect them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a series of little,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to use this term too much,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost thinking about</p>
<p>the simplest von Neumann constructor,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the simplest molecule</p>
<p>that could build a more complicated molecule</p>
<p>to build a more complicated molecule,</p>
<p>and before you know it,</p>
<p>when that more complicated molecule</p>
<p>can act on the causal chain that&rsquo;s produced itself</p>
<p>and change it,</p>
<p>suddenly you start to get towards some kind of autonomy,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where life, I think, emerges in earnest.</p>
<p>Every single word in the past few paragraphs,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s break those apart,</p>
<p>but who&rsquo;s von Neumann, what&rsquo;s a constructor,</p>
<p>the closing of the loop that you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>the molecule that starts becoming,</p>
<p>I think you said like the smallest von Neumann constructor,</p>
<p>the smallest, the minimal,</p>
<p>so what do all those things mean,</p>
<p>and what is, what are we supposed to imagine</p>
<p>when we think about the smallest von Neumann constructor?</p>
<p>So John von Neumann is a real hero,</p>
<p>actually, not just me, but many people, I think,</p>
<p>computer science and physics.</p>
<p>He was an incredible intellect</p>
<p>who probably solved a lot of the problems</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re working on today</p>
<p>and just forgot to write them down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s John von Neumann or Johnny,</p>
<p>as I think his friends called him,</p>
<p>but I think he was Hungarian, a mathematician,</p>
<p>came to the US,</p>
<p>and basically was involved in the Manhattan Project</p>
<p>in developing computation</p>
<p>and came up with all sorts of ideas,</p>
<p>and I think he was one of the first people</p>
<p>to come up with cellular automata.</p>
<p>And, but he&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know this little fact.</p>
<p>I think so, I think so.</p>
<p>And I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, anyway, if he didn&rsquo;t come up with it,</p>
<p>he probably did come up with it and didn&rsquo;t write it down.</p>
<p>There was a couple of people who did at the same time,</p>
<p>and then Conway obviously took it on,</p>
<p>and then Wolfram loves CAs.</p>
<p>There is his fabric of the universe.</p>
<p>And what I think he imagined was that he wasn&rsquo;t satisfied,</p>
<p>and this may be incorrect recollection,</p>
<p>but a lot of what I say is gonna be kind of</p>
<p>just way out of my&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, Lee, you&rsquo;re just part of the universe</p>
<p>creating its memory, designing&hellip;</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah, rewriting history.</p>
<p>Rewriting history.</p>
<p>Exactly, imperfectly.</p>
<p>So, but what I mean is I think he liked this idea</p>
<p>of thinking about how could a Turing machine</p>
<p>literally build itself without a Turing machine, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like literally how did state machines emerge?</p>
<p>And I think that von Neumann constructors,</p>
<p>he wanted to conceive of a minimal thing,</p>
<p>autonomous, that could build itself.</p>
<p>And what would those rules look like in the world?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what a von Neumann kind of constructor</p>
<p>looked like, like it&rsquo;s a minimal hypothetical object</p>
<p>that could build itself, self replicate.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really fascinated by that</p>
<p>because I think that although it&rsquo;s probably not</p>
<p>exactly what happened, it&rsquo;s a nice model</p>
<p>because as chemists, if we could go back</p>
<p>to the origin of life and think about</p>
<p>what is a minimal machine that can get structured randomly?</p>
<p>So like with no prime mover, with no architect,</p>
<p>it assembles through just existence.</p>
<p>So random stuff bumping in together</p>
<p>and you make this first molecule.</p>
<p>So you have molecule A and molecule A interacts</p>
<p>with another random molecule B and they get together</p>
<p>and they realize by working together</p>
<p>they can make more of themselves,</p>
<p>but then they realize they can mutate</p>
<p>so they can make AB prime.</p>
<p>So AB prime is different to AB</p>
<p>and then AB prime can then act back</p>
<p>where A and B are being created</p>
<p>and slightly nudge that causal chain</p>
<p>and make AB prime more evolvable or learn more.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the closing the loop part.</p>
<p>Closing the loop part, got it.</p>
<p>It feels like the mutation part is not that difficult.</p>
<p>It feels like the difficult part</p>
<p>is just creating a copy of yourself as step one.</p>
<p>That seems like one of the greatest inventions</p>
<p>in the history of the universe is the first molecule</p>
<p>that figured out, holy shit, I can create a copy of myself.</p>
<p>How hard is that?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really, really easy.</p>
<p>Okay, I did not expect that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really, really easy.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s take a step back.</p>
<p>I think replicating molecules are rare,</p>
<p>but if you say, I think I was saying on,</p>
<p>I probably got into trouble on Twitter the other day,</p>
<p>so I was trying to work this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s about more than 18 mils of water in there.</p>
<p>So one mole of water, 6.022 times 10 to the 23 molecules.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about the number of stars in universe, I think,</p>
<p>of the order.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s three universe worth, but between one and.</p>
<p>Somebody corrected you on Twitter?</p>
<p>Yeah, as if, I&rsquo;m always being corrected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great, but there&rsquo;s a lot of molecules in the water.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of, so although it&rsquo;s for you and me,</p>
<p>really hard to conceive of,</p>
<p>if existence is not the default for a long period of time,</p>
<p>because what happens is the molecules get degraded.</p>
<p>So much of the possibilities in the universe</p>
<p>are just broken back into atoms.</p>
<p>So you have this kind of destruction of the molecules</p>
<p>for our chemical reactions.</p>
<p>So you only need one or two molecules</p>
<p>to become good at copying themselves</p>
<p>for them suddenly to then take resources in the pool</p>
<p>and start to grow.</p>
<p>And so then replication actually over time,</p>
<p>when you have bonds, I think is much simpler, much easier.</p>
<p>And I even found this in my lab years ago.</p>
<p>I had one of the reasons I started doing inorganic chemistry</p>
<p>and making rust, making a bit of rust based on</p>
<p>a thing called molybdenum, molybdenum oxide</p>
<p>is this molybdenum oxide, very simple.</p>
<p>But when you add acid to it and some electrons,</p>
<p>they make these molecules you just cannot possibly imagine</p>
<p>would be constructed big, gigantic wheels</p>
<p>of 154 molybdenum atoms in a wheel</p>
<p>or I cost a dodecahedron 132 molybdenum atoms</p>
<p>all in the same pot.</p>
<p>And I realized when I,</p>
<p>and I just finished experiments two years ago,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just published a couple of papers on this,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re actually, there is a random small molecule</p>
<p>with 12 atoms in it that can form randomly,</p>
<p>but it happens to template its own production.</p>
<p>And then by chance, it templates the ring,</p>
<p>just an accident, just like just an absolute accident.</p>
<p>And that ring also helps make the small 12 mer.</p>
<p>And so you have what&rsquo;s called an autocatalytic set</p>
<p>where A makes B and B helps make A and vice versa.</p>
<p>And you then make this loop.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit like these, they all work in synergy</p>
<p>to make this chain of events that grow.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t take a very sophisticated model</p>
<p>to show that if you have these objects are competing</p>
<p>and then collaborating to help one another build,</p>
<p>they just grow out of the mess.</p>
<p>And although they seem improbable,</p>
<p>they are improbable, in fact, impossible in one step.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s multiple steps.</p>
<p>This is when the blind people look</p>
<p>at the blind watchmaker argument</p>
<p>and you talk about how could a watch spontaneously emerge?</p>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lineage of watches and cruder devices</p>
<p>that are bootstrapped onto one another.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s very improbable,</p>
<p>but once you get that little discovery</p>
<p>like with the wheel and fire,</p>
<p>it just explodes because it&rsquo;s so successful, it explodes.</p>
<p>It explodes, it&rsquo;s basically selection.</p>
<p>So this templating mechanism that allows you</p>
<p>to have a little like blueprint for yourself,</p>
<p>how you go through different procedures</p>
<p>is to build copies of yourself.</p>
<p>So in chemistry somehow it&rsquo;s possible to imagine</p>
<p>that that kind of thing is easy to spring up.</p>
<p>In more complex organisms, it feels like a different thing</p>
<p>and much more complicated.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re having like multiple abstractions</p>
<p>of the birds and the bees conversation here,</p>
<p>but with human, I&rsquo;m sorry, with complex organisms,</p>
<p>it feels like difficult to have reproduction to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna get clipped out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make fun of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to develop this idea</p>
<p>of making copies of yourself or no.</p>
<p>Because that seems like a magical idea for life to,</p>
<p>but wow, that feels like very necessary</p>
<p>for what selection is, for what evolution is.</p>
<p>But then if selection precedes all of this,</p>
<p>then maybe these are just like echoes</p>
<p>of the selecting mechanism at different scales.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly it.</p>
<p>So selection is the default in the universe if you want to.</p>
<p>And what happens is that life,</p>
<p>the solution that life has got on earth,</p>
<p>life on earth, biology on earth is unique to earth.</p>
<p>We can talk about that.</p>
<p>And that was really hard fought for,</p>
<p>but that is a solution that works on earth,</p>
<p>the ribosome, the fundamental machine</p>
<p>that is responsible for every cell on earth</p>
<p>of whatever, wherever it is in the kingdom of life.</p>
<p>That is an incredibly complex object,</p>
<p>but it was evolved over time</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t involved in a vacuum.</p>
<p>And I think that once we understand that selection</p>
<p>can occur without the ribosome,</p>
<p>but what the ribosome does,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a phase transition in replication.</p>
<p>And I think that that, and also technology</p>
<p>that is probably much easier to get to than we think.</p>
<p>Why do you put the ribosome as a central part</p>
<p>of living organisms on earth?</p>
<p>It basically is a combination</p>
<p>of two different polymer systems, so RNA and peptides.</p>
<p>So the RNA world, if you like,</p>
<p>gets transmitted and builds proteins</p>
<p>and the proteins are responsible for all the catalysis.</p>
<p>The majority of the catalysis goes on in the cell.</p>
<p>No ribosome, no proteins, no decoding, no evolution.</p>
<p>So ribosome is looking at the action.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t put like the RNA itself as the critical thing,</p>
<p>like information, you put action as the most important thing.</p>
<p>I think the actual molecules</p>
<p>that we have in biology right now are entirely contingent</p>
<p>on the history of life on earth.</p>
<p>There are so many possible solutions.</p>
<p>And this is where chemistry got itself into,</p>
<p>origin of life chemistry gets itself into a bit of a trap.</p>
<p>Yeah, let me interrupt you there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve tweeted, you&rsquo;re gonna get,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna cite your tweets like it&rsquo;s Shakespeare, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprising you haven&rsquo;t gotten canceled on Twitter yet.</p>
<p>Your brilliance once again saves you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>You like to have a little bit of fun on Twitter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve tweeted that quote,</p>
<p>origin of life research is a scam.</p>
<p>So if this is Shakespeare, can we analyze this word?</p>
<p>Why is the origin of life research a scam?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you kind of doing origin of life research?</p>
<p>Okay, it was tongue in cheek, but yeah,</p>
<p>I think, and I meant it as tongue in cheek.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing the origin of life research.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to make artificial life.</p>
<p>And I also want to bound the likelihood</p>
<p>of the origin of life on earth,</p>
<p>but more importantly to find origin of life elsewhere.</p>
<p>But let me directly address the tweet.</p>
<p>There are many, many good chemists out there</p>
<p>doing origin of life research, but I want to nudge them.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re brilliant.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no question the chemistry they are doing,</p>
<p>the motivation is great.</p>
<p>So what I meant by that tweet is saying</p>
<p>that maybe they&rsquo;re making assumptions about saying,</p>
<p>if only I could make this particular type of molecule,</p>
<p>say this RNA molecule or this phosphodiester</p>
<p>or this other molecule,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna somehow unlock the origin of life.</p>
<p>And I think that origin of life has been looking at this</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>And whilst I think it&rsquo;s brilliant to work out</p>
<p>how you can get to those molecules,</p>
<p>I think that chemistry and chemists doing origin of life</p>
<p>could be nudged into doing something even more profound.</p>
<p>And so the argument I&rsquo;m making,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit like right now,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, I don&rsquo;t know, the first Tesla</p>
<p>that makes its way to, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>into a new country in the world.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a country X</p>
<p>that has never had a Tesla before</p>
<p>and they get the Tesla.</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>And they take the Tesla,</p>
<p>and what they do is they take the Tesla apart</p>
<p>and say, we want to find the origin of cars in the universe</p>
<p>and say, okay, how did this form and how did this form?</p>
<p>And they just randomly keep making</p>
<p>till they make the door, they make the wheel,</p>
<p>they make the steering column and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And they say, well, that&rsquo;s the route.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way cars emerged on earth.</p>
<p>But actually we know that there&rsquo;s a causal chain of cars</p>
<p>going right back to Henry Ford and the horse and carriage.</p>
<p>And before that, maybe, you know,</p>
<p>where people were using wheels.</p>
<p>And I think that obsession with the identities</p>
<p>that we see in biology right now</p>
<p>are giving us a false sense of security</p>
<p>about what we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>And I think that origin of life chemistry is in danger</p>
<p>of not making the progress that it deserves</p>
<p>because the chemists are doing this.</p>
<p>The field is exploding right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s amazing people out there, young and old doing this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s deservedly so more money going in.</p>
<p>You know, I used to complain</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more money being spent searching for the Higgs boson</p>
<p>that we know exists than the origin of life.</p>
<p>You know, why is that?</p>
<p>The origin, we understand the origin of life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna actually work out what life is.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna be at a bound,</p>
<p>the likelihood of finding life elsewhere in the universe.</p>
<p>And most important for us,</p>
<p>we are gonna know or have a good idea</p>
<p>of what the future of humanity looks like.</p>
<p>You know, we need to understand</p>
<p>that although we&rsquo;re precious,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not the only life forms in the universe.</p>
<p>Or that&rsquo;s my very strong impression.</p>
<p>I have no data for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just right now a belief.</p>
<p>And I want to turn that belief</p>
<p>into a more than a belief by experimentation.</p>
<p>But coming back to the scam,</p>
<p>the scam is if we just make this RNA,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got this fluke event, we know how that&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make this phosphodiester,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s make ATP or ADP.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got that part nailed.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s now make this other molecule, another molecule.</p>
<p>And how many molecules are gonna be enough?</p>
<p>And then the reason I say this</p>
<p>is when you go back to Craig Venter,</p>
<p>when he invented his life form, Cyndia,</p>
<p>this micro, this minimal plasmid,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a myoplasma, something, I don&rsquo;t know the name of it,</p>
<p>but he made this wonderful cell</p>
<p>and said, I&rsquo;ve invented life.</p>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>He facsimileed the genome from this entity</p>
<p>and made it in the lab, all the DNA,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t make the cell.</p>
<p>He had to take an existing cell</p>
<p>that has a causal chain going all the way back to Luca.</p>
<p>And he showed when he took out the gene,</p>
<p>the genes and put in his genes, synthesized,</p>
<p>the cell could boot up.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s remarkable that he could not make a cell</p>
<p>from scratch.</p>
<p>And even now today, synthetic biologists</p>
<p>cannot make a cell from scratch</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some contingent information embodied</p>
<p>outside the genome in the cell.</p>
<p>And that is just incredible.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots of layers to the scam.</p>
<p>Well, let me then ask the question,</p>
<p>how can we create life in the lab from scratch?</p>
<p>What have been the most promising attempts</p>
<p>at creating life in the lab from scratch?</p>
<p>Has anyone actually been able to do it?</p>
<p>Do you think anyone will be able to do it</p>
<p>in the near future if they haven&rsquo;t already?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that nobody has made life</p>
<p>in the lab from scratch.</p>
<p>Lots of people would argue that they have made progress.</p>
<p>So Craig Venter, I think the synthesis</p>
<p>of a synthetic genome milestone in human achievement.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>Yeah, can we just walk back and say,</p>
<p>what would you say from your perspective,</p>
<p>one of the world experts in exactly this area,</p>
<p>what does it mean to create life from scratch</p>
<p>where if you sit back, whether you do it</p>
<p>or somebody else does it, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>damn, this is, we just created life.</p>
<p>Well, I can tell you what I would expect,</p>
<p>I would like to be able to do,</p>
<p>is to go from sand to cells in my lab and&hellip;</p>
<p>Can you explain what sand is?</p>
<p>Yeah, just inorganic stuff, like basically just,</p>
<p>so sand is just silicon oxide with some other ions in it,</p>
<p>maybe some inorganic carbon, some carbonates,</p>
<p>just basically clearly dead stuff</p>
<p>that you could just grind rocks into sand.</p>
<p>And it would be what, in a kind of vacuum</p>
<p>so they could remove anything else</p>
<p>that could possibly be like a shadow of life</p>
<p>that can assist in the chemical.</p>
<p>You could do that, you could insist and say,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m gonna take, and not just inorganic,</p>
<p>I want some more, I wanna cheat and have some organic,</p>
<p>but I want inorganic organic,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll explain the play on words in a moment.</p>
<p>So I would like to basically put into a world,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a completely synthetic world, if you like,</p>
<p>a closed world, put some inorganic materials</p>
<p>and just literally add some energy in some form,</p>
<p>be it lightning or heat, UV light,</p>
<p>and run this thing in cycles over time</p>
<p>and let it solve the search problem.</p>
<p>So I see the origin of life as a search problem</p>
<p>in chemical space.</p>
<p>And then I would wait, literally wait for a life form</p>
<p>to crawl out of the test tube.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a joke I tell my group.</p>
<p>Literally wait for a very, don&rsquo;t worry,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be very feeble,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna take over the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ways of ethically containing it.</p>
<p>Famous last words.</p>
<p>Indeed, indeed, indeed, but I.</p>
<p>You know this is being recorded, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll make you, it will not make you look good</p>
<p>once it crawls out of the lab</p>
<p>and destroys all of human civilization, but yes.</p>
<p>But there is very good,</p>
<p>there is a very good things you can do to prevent that.</p>
<p>For instance, if you put stuff in your world,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t earth abundant,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say we make life based on molybdenum</p>
<p>and it escapes, it would die immediately</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not enough molybdenum in the environment.</p>
<p>So we can put in, we can do responsible life.</p>
<p>Or as I fantasize with my research group on our away day</p>
<p>that would go in, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually morally if we don&rsquo;t find,</p>
<p>until humanity finds life in the universe,</p>
<p>this is going on a tangent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s our moral obligation to make origin of life bombs,</p>
<p>identify dead planets and bomb them</p>
<p>with our origin of life machines and make them alive.</p>
<p>I think it is our moral obligation to do that.</p>
<p>Some people might argue with me about that,</p>
<p>but I think that we need more life in the universe.</p>
<p>And then we kind of forget we did it</p>
<p>and then come back and then.</p>
<p>So where did you come from?</p>
<p>But coming back to the, what I&rsquo;d expect.</p>
<p>So I just say. Father, are you back?</p>
<p>I think this is once again, a Rick and Morty episode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely all Rick and Morty all the way down.</p>
<p>So we, I imagine we have this pristine experiment</p>
<p>and everything is, you know, sanitized</p>
<p>and we put in inorganic materials</p>
<p>and we have cycles with them,</p>
<p>day, night cycles, up, down, whatever.</p>
<p>And we look for evidence of replication</p>
<p>and evolution over time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the experiment should be.</p>
<p>Now, are there people doing this in the world right now?</p>
<p>There are a couple of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some really good groups doing this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some really interesting scientists</p>
<p>doing this around the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of perhaps too much associated with the scam.</p>
<p>So, and so they&rsquo;re using molecules</p>
<p>that are already, were already invented by biology.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bit of replication built in,</p>
<p>but I still think the work that is doing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing is amazing.</p>
<p>But I would like people to be a bit freer and say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just basically shake a load of sand in a box</p>
<p>and wait for life to come out</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what happened on earth.</p>
<p>And so that we have to understand that.</p>
<p>Now, how would I know I&rsquo;ve been successful?</p>
<p>Well, because I&rsquo;m not obsessing</p>
<p>with what molecules are in life now,</p>
<p>I would wager a vast quantity of money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very rich, so just be a few dollars,</p>
<p>but for me, the solution space will be different.</p>
<p>So the genetic material will be not RNA.</p>
<p>The proteins will not be what we think.</p>
<p>The solutions will be just completely different.</p>
<p>And it might be, and it will be very feeble</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the other thing we should be able to show</p>
<p>fairly robustly that even if I did make</p>
<p>or someone did make a new life form in the lab,</p>
<p>it would be so poor that it&rsquo;s not gonna leap out.</p>
<p>It is the fear about making a lethal life form</p>
<p>in the lab from scratch is similar to us imagining</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna make the terminator</p>
<p>at Boston Dynamics tomorrow.</p>
<p>Simply not, and the problem is</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t communicate that properly.</p>
<p>I know you yourself very, you explain this very well.</p>
<p>There is not the AI catastrophe coming.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very far away from that.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean we should ignore it.</p>
<p>Same with the origin of life catastrophe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not coming anytime soon.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t ignore it, but we shouldn&rsquo;t let that fear</p>
<p>stop us from doing those experiments.</p>
<p>But this is a much, much longer discussion</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of details there.</p>
<p>I would say there is potential for catastrophic events</p>
<p>to happen in much dumber ways.</p>
<p>In AI space, there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to create,</p>
<p>like social networks are creating a kind</p>
<p>of accelerated set of events</p>
<p>that we might not be able to control.</p>
<p>The social network virality in the digital space</p>
<p>can create mass movements of ideas that can then,</p>
<p>if times are tough, create military conflict</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not super intelligent AI.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting at scale application of AI.</p>
<p>If you look at viruses, viruses are pretty dumb,</p>
<p>but at scale, their application is pretty detrimental.</p>
<p>And so origin of life, much like all the kind of virology,</p>
<p>the very contentious word of gain of function research</p>
<p>and virology, sort of like research on viruses,</p>
<p>messing with them genetically,</p>
<p>that can create a lot of problems if not done well.</p>
<p>So we have to be very cautious.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of,</p>
<p>whenever you&rsquo;re ultra cautious about stuff in AI</p>
<p>or in virology and biology,</p>
<p>it borders on cynicism, I would say,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like everything we do is going to turn out</p>
<p>to be destructive and terrible.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to sit here and do nothing.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a possible solution except for the fact</p>
<p>that somebody is going to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s science and technology progresses.</p>
<p>So we have to do it in an ethical way, in a good way,</p>
<p>considering in a transparent way, in an open way,</p>
<p>considering all the possible positive trajectories</p>
<p>that could be taken and making sure as much as possible</p>
<p>that we walk those trajectories.</p>
<p>So yeah, I don&rsquo;t think Terminator is coming,</p>
<p>but a totally unexpected version of Terminator</p>
<p>may be around the corner.</p>
<p>Might be here already.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I agree with that.</p>
<p>And so going back to the origin of life discussion,</p>
<p>I think that in synthetic biology right now,</p>
<p>we have to be very careful about how we edit genomes</p>
<p>and edit synthetic biology to do things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of, that&rsquo;s where things might go wrong</p>
<p>in the same way as Twitter turning ourselves</p>
<p>into kind of strange scale effects.</p>
<p>I would love origin of life research</p>
<p>or artificial life research to get to the point</p>
<p>where we have those worries,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s why I think we&rsquo;re just so far away from that.</p>
<p>We are just, you know, right now,</p>
<p>I think there are two really important angles.</p>
<p>There is the origin of life people,</p>
<p>researchers who are faithfully working on this</p>
<p>and trying to make those molecules,</p>
<p>the scan molecules I talked about.</p>
<p>And then there are people on the creationist side</p>
<p>who are saying, look,</p>
<p>the fact you can&rsquo;t make these molecules</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t make a cell means that evolution isn&rsquo;t true</p>
<p>and all this other stuff.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so, and I find that really frustrating</p>
<p>because actually the origin of life research</p>
<p>is all working in good faith, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;m trying to do</p>
<p>is give origin of life research</p>
<p>a little bit more of an open context.</p>
<p>And one of the things I think is important,</p>
<p>I really want to make a new life form in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I really want to prove that life is a general phenomena,</p>
<p>a bit like gravity in the universe,</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s gonna be really important</p>
<p>for humanity&rsquo;s global psychological state,</p>
<p>meaning going forward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautifully put.</p>
<p>So one, it will help us understand ourselves.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s useful for science,</p>
<p>but two, it gives us a kind of hope,</p>
<p>if not an awe at all the huge amounts</p>
<p>of alien civilizations that are out there.</p>
<p>If you can build life and understand</p>
<p>just how easy it is to build life,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s just as good, if not much better,</p>
<p>than discovering life on another planet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s cheaper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much cheaper and much easier</p>
<p>and probably much more conclusive</p>
<p>because once you&rsquo;re able to create life,</p>
<p>like you said, it&rsquo;s a search problem</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s probably a lot of different ways to do it.</p>
<p>Once you create the, once you find the first solution,</p>
<p>you probably have all the right methodology</p>
<p>for finding all kinds of other solutions.</p>
<p>Yeah, and wouldn&rsquo;t it be great</p>
<p>if we could find a solution?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s probably a bit late for,</p>
<p>I mean, I worry about climate change,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not that worried about climate change,</p>
<p>and I think one day you could think about,</p>
<p>could we engineer a new type of life form</p>
<p>that could basically, and I don&rsquo;t want to do this,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think we should do this necessarily,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good thought experiment</p>
<p>that would perhaps take CO2 out of the atmosphere</p>
<p>or an intermediate life form, so it&rsquo;s not quite alive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like an add on</p>
<p>that we can, with a time dependent add on,</p>
<p>you could give to say cyanobacteria in the ocean</p>
<p>or to maybe to wheat and say, right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just gonna, we&rsquo;re gonna fix a bit more CO2,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna work out how much we need to fix</p>
<p>to basically save the climate,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna use evolutionary principles</p>
<p>to basically get there.</p>
<p>What worries me is that biology has had a few billion years</p>
<p>to find a solution for CO2 fixation,</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t really done, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>the solution isn&rsquo;t brilliant for our needs,</p>
<p>but biology wasn&rsquo;t thinking about our needs.</p>
<p>Biology was thinking about biology&rsquo;s needs,</p>
<p>but I think if we can do, as you say,</p>
<p>make life in the lab, then suddenly we don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to go to everywhere and conclusively prove it.</p>
<p>I think we make life in the lab.</p>
<p>We look at the extent of life in the solar system.</p>
<p>How far did Earth life get?</p>
<p>Probably we&rsquo;re all Martians.</p>
<p>Probably life got going on Mars.</p>
<p>The chemistry on Mars seeded Earth.</p>
<p>That might have been a legitimate way</p>
<p>to kind of truncate the surface.</p>
<p>But in the outer solar system,</p>
<p>we might have completely different life forms</p>
<p>on Enceladus, on Europa, and Titan.</p>
<p>And that would be a cool thing, because.</p>
<p>Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>
<p>Did you just say that you think, in terms of likelihood,</p>
<p>life started on Mars, like statistically speaking,</p>
<p>life started on Mars and seeded Earth?</p>
<p>It could be possible, because life was,</p>
<p>so Mars was habitable for the type of life</p>
<p>that we have right now, type of chemistry before Earth.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that Mars got searching,</p>
<p>doing chemistry, like, and.</p>
<p>It started way before.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so they had a few more replicators</p>
<p>and some other stuff.</p>
<p>And if those replicators got ejected from Mars</p>
<p>and landed on Earth, and Earth was like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to start again.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Thanks for that.</p>
<p>And then it just carried on.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not going, I think we will find evidence</p>
<p>of life on Mars, either life we put there by mistake,</p>
<p>contamination, or actually life,</p>
<p>the earliest remnants of life.</p>
<p>And that would be really exciting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good reason to go there.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s more unlikely,</p>
<p>because the gravitational situation in the solar system,</p>
<p>if we find life in the outer solar system.</p>
<p>Titan and all that, that would be its own thing.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Wow, that would be so cool.</p>
<p>If we go to Mars and we find life that looks</p>
<p>a hell of a lot similar to Earth life,</p>
<p>and then we go to Titan and all those weird moons</p>
<p>with the ices and the volcanoes and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>and then we find there something that looks,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, way weirder.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Some other, some non RNA type of situation.</p>
<p>But we might find almost life,</p>
<p>like in the prebiotic chemical space.</p>
<p>And I think there are four types of exoplanets</p>
<p>we need to look for, right?</p>
<p>Because when JWST goes up and touch wood,</p>
<p>it goes up and everything&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>When we look at a star, well, we know statistically,</p>
<p>most stars have planets around them.</p>
<p>What type of planet are they?</p>
<p>Are they going to be dead?</p>
<p>Are they going to be just a prebiotic origin of life coming?</p>
<p>So are they going to be technological?</p>
<p>So with intelligence on them, and will they have died?</p>
<p>So, you know, had life on them, but gone.</p>
<p>Those are the four states of the boat.</p>
<p>And suddenly, it&rsquo;s a bit like I want to classify planets</p>
<p>the way we classify stars.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think that, in terms of their,</p>
<p>rather than having this, oh, we&rsquo;ve found methane,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s evidence of life.</p>
<p>We found oxygen, that&rsquo;s the evidence of life.</p>
<p>We found whatever molecule marker.</p>
<p>And start to then frame things a little bit more.</p>
<p>As those four states.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which, by the way, you&rsquo;re just saying four,</p>
<p>but there could be, before the dead,</p>
<p>there could be other states</p>
<p>that we humans can even conceive of.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, just prebiotic, almost alive,</p>
<p>got the possibility to come alive.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>But there could be a post technological.</p>
<p>Like, whatever we think of as technology,</p>
<p>that could be a, like, pre conscious,</p>
<p>like, where we all meld into one super intelligent conscious,</p>
<p>or some weird thing that naturally happens over time.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that all bets are on that.</p>
<p>The metaverse.</p>
<p>Yeah, we are.</p>
<p>We join into a virtual metaverse and start creating,</p>
<p>which is kind of an interesting idea,</p>
<p>almost arbitrary number of copies of each other,</p>
<p>much more quickly, so we can mess with different ideas.</p>
<p>Like, I can create a thousand copies of Lex,</p>
<p>like, every possible version of Lex,</p>
<p>and then just see, like,</p>
<p>and then I just have them, like, argue with each other,</p>
<p>and, like, until, like, in the space of ideas</p>
<p>and see who wins out.</p>
<p>How could that possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>But anyway, there&rsquo;s, especially in this digital space</p>
<p>where you could start exploring with AIs mixed in,</p>
<p>you could start engineering arbitrary intelligences,</p>
<p>you can start playing in the space of ideas,</p>
<p>which might move us into a world that looks very different</p>
<p>than a biological world.</p>
<p>Like, our current world, the technology,</p>
<p>is still very much tied to our biology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, we might move past that completely.</p>
<p>Oh, definitely, we definitely will.</p>
<p>We definitely, but that could be another phase then.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Because then you, yeah.</p>
<p>But I did say technological, so I think I agree with you.</p>
<p>I think, so you can have, let&rsquo;s get this right.</p>
<p>So, dead world, no prospect of alive.</p>
<p>Prebiotic world, life emerging.</p>
<p>Living and technological.</p>
<p>And you probably, and the dead one,</p>
<p>you probably won&rsquo;t be able to tell</p>
<p>between the dead never being alive and the dead one,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ve got some artifacts and maybe there&rsquo;s five.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably not more than five.</p>
<p>And I think the technological one could allow,</p>
<p>could have life on it still,</p>
<p>but it might just have exceeded.</p>
<p>Because, you know, one way that life might survive on Earth</p>
<p>is if we can work out how to deal with the coming,</p>
<p>the real climate change that comes when the sun expands.</p>
<p>It might be a way to survive that, you know, but yeah.</p>
<p>I think that we need to start thinking statistically</p>
<p>when it comes to looking for life in the universe.</p>
<p>Let me ask you then, sort of statistically,</p>
<p>how many alien civilizations are out there</p>
<p>in those four phases that you&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>When you look up to the stars</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sipping on some wine</p>
<p>and talking to other people with British accents</p>
<p>about something intelligent and intellectual, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a lot of alien civilizations</p>
<p>looking back at us and wondering the same?</p>
<p>My romantic view of the universe</p>
<p>is really taking loans from my logical self.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is I have no doubt, I have no idea.</p>
<p>But having said that, there is no reason to suppose</p>
<p>that life is as hard as we first thought it was.</p>
<p>And so if we just take Earth as a marker,</p>
<p>and if I think that life is a much more general phenomena</p>
<p>than just our biology,</p>
<p>then I think the universe is full of life.</p>
<p>And the reason for the Fermi paradox</p>
<p>is not that they&rsquo;re not out there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that we can&rsquo;t interact with the other life forms</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so different.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying that they&rsquo;re necessarily like</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t depicted in Arrival or other, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that perhaps</p>
<p>there are very few universal facts in the universe</p>
<p>and maybe our technologies are quite divergent.</p>
<p>And so I think that it&rsquo;s very hard to know</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re gonna interact with alien life.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s a lot of kinds of life that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I guess that was the intuition you provided</p>
<p>that the way biology itself,</p>
<p>but even this particular kinds of biology</p>
<p>that we have on Earth is something that is just one sample</p>
<p>of nearly infinite number of other possible,</p>
<p>complex, autonomous, self replicating type of things</p>
<p>that could be possible.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re almost unable to see</p>
<p>the alternative versions of us, huh?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ll still be able to detect them,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll still be able to interact with them,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll still be able to like which,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s exactly is lost in translation?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we see them?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we talk to them?</p>
<p>Because I too have a sense,</p>
<p>you put it way more poetically,</p>
<p>but it seems both statistically</p>
<p>and sort of romantically,</p>
<p>it feels like the universe should be teeming with life,</p>
<p>like super intelligent life.</p>
<p>And I just, I sit there and the Fermi paradox is very,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s felt very distinctly by me</p>
<p>when I look up at the stars because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same way I feel when I&rsquo;m driving</p>
<p>through New Jersey and listening to Bruce Springsteen</p>
<p>and feel quite sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Lucy Kay talks about pulling off</p>
<p>to the side of the road and just weeping a little bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost like wondering like,</p>
<p>hey, why aren&rsquo;t you talking to us?</p>
<p>It feels lonely, it feels lonely</p>
<p>because it feels like they&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>I think that there are a number of answers to that.</p>
<p>I think the Fermi paradox is perhaps based</p>
<p>on the assumption that if life did emerge in the universe,</p>
<p>it would be similar to our life</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s only one solution.</p>
<p>And I think that what we&rsquo;ve got to start to do</p>
<p>is go out and look for selection detection</p>
<p>rather than an evolution detection,</p>
<p>rather than life detection.</p>
<p>And I think that once we start to do that,</p>
<p>we might start to see really interesting things.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t been doing this for very long</p>
<p>and we are living in an expanding universe</p>
<p>and that makes the problem a little bit harder.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s always leaving distance wise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very optimistic that we will,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t know, there are two movies that came out</p>
<p>within six months of one another,</p>
<p>Ad Astra and Cosmos.</p>
<p>Ad Astra, the very expensive blockbuster</p>
<p>with Brad Pitt in it and saying there is no life</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all, we&rsquo;ve got to,</p>
<p>life on Earth has more pressures than Cosmos,</p>
<p>which is a UK production,</p>
<p>which basically aliens came and visited Earth one day</p>
<p>and they were discovered in the UK, right?</p>
<p>It was quite, it&rsquo;s a fun film.</p>
<p>But I really loved those two films.</p>
<p>And at the same time, those films,</p>
<p>at the time those films were coming out,</p>
<p>I was working on a paper, a life detection paper,</p>
<p>and I found it was so hard to publish this paper</p>
<p>and it was almost as depressed,</p>
<p>I got so depressed trying to get this science out there</p>
<p>that I felt the depression of the film in Ad Astra,</p>
<p>like life, there&rsquo;s no life elsewhere in the universe.</p>
<p>And, but I&rsquo;m incredibly optimistic</p>
<p>that I think we will find life in the universe,</p>
<p>firm evidence of life,</p>
<p>and it will have to start on Earth,</p>
<p>making life on Earth and surprising us.</p>
<p>We have to surprise ourselves</p>
<p>and make non biological life on Earth.</p>
<p>And then people say, well, you made this life on Earth,</p>
<p>therefore it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re part of the causal chain of that.</p>
<p>And that might be true,</p>
<p>but if I can show how I&rsquo;m able to do it</p>
<p>with very little cheating</p>
<p>or very little information inputs,</p>
<p>just creating like a model planet.</p>
<p>Some description and watching it, watching life emerge,</p>
<p>then I think that we will be even to persuade</p>
<p>even the hardest critic that it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Now, with regards to the Fermi paradox,</p>
<p>I think that we might crush that with the JWST.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically, if I recall correctly,</p>
<p>the mirror is about 10 times the size of the Hubble</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna be able to do spectroscopy,</p>
<p>look at colors of exoplanets, I think, not brilliantly,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll be able to start to classify them.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll start to get a real feel</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s going on in the universe on these exoplanets.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s only in the last few decades, I think,</p>
<p>maybe even last decade that we even</p>
<p>came to recognize that exoplanets even are common.</p>
<p>And I think that that gives us a lot of optimism</p>
<p>that life is gonna be out there.</p>
<p>But I think we have to start framing,</p>
<p>we have to start preparing the fact</p>
<p>that biology is only one solution.</p>
<p>I can tell you with confidence that biology on Earth</p>
<p>does not exist anywhere else in the universe.</p>
<p>We are absolutely unique.</p>
<p>Well, okay, I love the confidence,</p>
<p>but where does that confidence come from?</p>
<p>Chemistry, like how many options does chemistry really have?</p>
<p>Many, that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>And the thing is, this is where the origin of life scam</p>
<p>comes in, is that people don&rsquo;t quite count,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t count the numbers.</p>
<p>So if biology as you find on Earth is common everywhere,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s something really weird going on</p>
<p>that basically written in the quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some kind of these bonds must form over these bonds</p>
<p>and this catalyst must form over this catalyst</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re all quite equal.</p>
<p>Life is contingent.</p>
<p>The origin of life on Earth was contingent</p>
<p>upon the chemistry available at the origin of life on Earth.</p>
<p>So that means if we want to find other Earth like worlds,</p>
<p>we look for the same kind of rocky world.</p>
<p>We might look in the same zone as Earth</p>
<p>and we might expect reasonably</p>
<p>to find biological like stuff going on.</p>
<p>That would be a reasonable hypothesis,</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t be the same, it can&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying, I don&rsquo;t believe in magic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t believe in magic.</p>
<p>I believe in statistics and I can do experiments.</p>
<p>And so I won&rsquo;t get the same, exactly the same sequence</p>
<p>of events, I&rsquo;ll get something different.</p>
<p>And so there is TikTok elsewhere in the universe,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the same as our TikTok, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>Which aspect of it is not the same?</p>
<p>Well, I just think, so what is TikTok?</p>
<p>TikTok is a social media where people upload videos, right?</p>
<p>Of silly videos.</p>
<p>So I guess there might be.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s humor, there&rsquo;s attention,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the ability to process,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ability for intelligent organisms</p>
<p>to collaborate on ideas and find human ideas</p>
<p>and play with those ideas, make them viral, memes.</p>
<p>Humor seems to be kind of fundamental</p>
<p>to the human experience.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s a really interesting question</p>
<p>we can ask, is humor a fundamental thing in the universe?</p>
<p>I think maybe it will be, right?</p>
<p>In terms of, you think about in a game theoretic sense,</p>
<p>humor, the emergence of humor serves a role</p>
<p>in our game engine.</p>
<p>And so if selection is fundamental in the universe,</p>
<p>so is humor.</p>
<p>Well, I actually don&rsquo;t know exactly</p>
<p>what role humor serves.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s like, from a chemical perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a catalyst for,</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s for several purposes.</p>
<p>One is the catalyst for spreading ideas on the internet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s modern humor.</p>
<p>But humor is also a good way to deal</p>
<p>with the difficulty of life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of valve, release valve for suffering.</p>
<p>Throughout human history, life has been really hard.</p>
<p>And for the people that I&rsquo;ve known in my life</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve lived through some really difficult things,</p>
<p>humor is part of how they deal with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually dark humor.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what&rsquo;s the more mathematically</p>
<p>general way to formulate what the hell is humor.</p>
<p>What humor does it serve?</p>
<p>But I still, we&rsquo;re kind of joking here,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a counterintuitive idea to me</p>
<p>to think that life elsewhere in the universe</p>
<p>is very different than life on Earth.</p>
<p>And also, like all of each instantiation of life</p>
<p>is likely very different from each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, like maybe there&rsquo;s a few clusters of similar life,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much more likely is what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s a kind of novel thought.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to do with it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that it&rsquo;s more common</p>
<p>to be a weird outcast in the full spectrum of life</p>
<p>than it is to be in some usual cluster.</p>
<p>So every instantiation of a kind of chemistry</p>
<p>that results in complexity that&rsquo;s autonomous</p>
<p>and self replicating however the hell you define life,</p>
<p>that is going to be very different every time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It feels like a selection is a fundamental</p>
<p>kind of directed force in the universe.</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t selection result in a few pockets</p>
<p>of interesting complexities?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, if we ran Earth over again,</p>
<p>over and over and over,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s going to come up with,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not going to be elephants every time?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think that there will be similarities.</p>
<p>And I think we don&rsquo;t know enough</p>
<p>about how selection globally works.</p>
<p>But it might be that the emergence of elephants</p>
<p>was wired into the history of Earth in some way,</p>
<p>like the gravitational force, how evolution was going,</p>
<p>Cambrian explosions, blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>the emergence of mammals.</p>
<p>But I just don&rsquo;t know enough about the contingency,</p>
<p>the variability.</p>
<p>All I do know is you count the number of bits</p>
<p>of information required to make an elephant</p>
<p>and think about the causal chain</p>
<p>that provide the lineage of elephants</p>
<p>going all the way back to Luca,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge scope for divergence.</p>
<p>Yeah, but just like you said, with chemistry and selection,</p>
<p>the things that result in self replicating chemistry</p>
<p>and self replicating organisms,</p>
<p>those are extremely unlikely, as you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>But once they&rsquo;re successful, they multiply.</p>
<p>So it might be a tiny subset of all things</p>
<p>that are possible in the universe, chemically speaking,</p>
<p>it might be a very tiny subset</p>
<p>is actually successful at creating elephants.</p>
<p>Or elephant like or slash human like creatures.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s two different questions here.</p>
<p>The first one, if we were to reset Earth and to start again.</p>
<p>The different phases, sorry to keep interrupting.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, if we restart Earth and start again,</p>
<p>say we could go back to the beginning</p>
<p>and do the experiment or have a number of Earths,</p>
<p>how similar would biology be?</p>
<p>I would say that there would be broad similarities,</p>
<p>but the emergence of mammals is not a given</p>
<p>unless we&rsquo;re gonna throw an asteroid at each planet</p>
<p>at each time and try and faithfully reproduce what happened.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the other thing about</p>
<p>when you go to another Earth like planet elsewhere,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a different ratio, particular elements,</p>
<p>maybe the bombardment at the beginning of the planet</p>
<p>was quicker or longer than Earth.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t have enough information there.</p>
<p>What I do know is that the complexity of the story of life</p>
<p>on Earth gives us lots of scope for variation.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a reasonable</p>
<p>mathematical assumption to think that life on Earth</p>
<p>that happened again would be same as what we have now.</p>
<p>Okay, but you&rsquo;ve also extended that to say</p>
<p>that we might, as an explanation for the Fermi paradox,</p>
<p>that that means we&rsquo;re not able to interact with them.</p>
<p>Or that&rsquo;s an explanation for why we haven&rsquo;t at scale</p>
<p>heard from aliens is they&rsquo;re different than us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only been looking for, say, 70, 80 years.</p>
<p>So I think that the reason we have not found aliens yet</p>
<p>is that we haven&rsquo;t worked out what life is.</p>
<p>No, but the aliens have worked that out, surely.</p>
<p>Statistically speaking, there must be a large number</p>
<p>of aliens that are way ahead of us</p>
<p>on this whole life question.</p>
<p>Unless there&rsquo;s something about this stage</p>
<p>of intellectual evolution that often quickly results</p>
<p>in nuclear war and destroys itself.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something in this process</p>
<p>that eventually, I don&rsquo;t know, crystallizes the complexity</p>
<p>and it stops, either dies or stops developing.</p>
<p>But most likely, they already figured it out.</p>
<p>And why aren&rsquo;t they contacting us?</p>
<p>Is it some grad student somewhere?</p>
<p>Wants to study a new green planet?</p>
<p>Maybe they have.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t have a coherent answer to your question,</p>
<p>other than to say that if there are other aliens out there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re far more advanced,</p>
<p>they might be in contact with each other.</p>
<p>And they might also, we might be at a point</p>
<p>where what I&rsquo;m saying quite critically</p>
<p>is it takes two to talk, right?</p>
<p>So the aliens might be there.</p>
<p>But if we don&rsquo;t have the ability to recognize them</p>
<p>and talk to them, then the aliens aren&rsquo;t going</p>
<p>to want to talk to us.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a critical point</p>
<p>that probably if that&rsquo;s a filter,</p>
<p>there needs to be an ability for one</p>
<p>to communicate with the other.</p>
<p>And we need to know what life is before we do that.</p>
<p>So we haven&rsquo;t qualified to even join the club</p>
<p>to have a talk.</p>
<p>Well, I think they still wanna teach us how to talk, right?</p>
<p>But my worry is that, or I think they would wanna teach us</p>
<p>how to talk like you do when you meet it.</p>
<p>Like when you even meet, I was gonna say child,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a human species.</p>
<p>I mean like ant.</p>
<p>You want to try to communicate with them</p>
<p>through whatever devices you can,</p>
<p>given what an ant is like.</p>
<p>I just, I worry mostly about that humans</p>
<p>are just too close minded or don&rsquo;t have the right tools.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m gonna push back on this quite significantly.</p>
<p>I would say, because we don&rsquo;t understand what life is</p>
<p>and because we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>how life emerged in the universe,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t understand the physics</p>
<p>that gave rise to life yet.</p>
<p>That means our fundamental description,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m way out of my pay grade, even further out.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll say it anyway,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s a fun.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get paid much anyway, as you said earlier.</p>
<p>So I would say that we,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t understand the universe yet,</p>
<p>we do not understand how the universe spat out life.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know what life is.</p>
<p>And I think that until we understand that,</p>
<p>it is gonna limit our ability to even,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t qualify to talk to the aliens.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna say that they might be there,</p>
<p>but we just, I&rsquo;m not gonna say that I believe</p>
<p>in interdimensional aliens being present in this room.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think you&rsquo;re just being self critical,</p>
<p>like we don&rsquo;t qualify.</p>
<p>I think the fact that we don&rsquo;t qualify qualifies us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re interesting in our innocence.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying that because we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>causal chains and the way that information</p>
<p>is propagated in the universe.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t understand what replication is yet.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t understand how life emerged.</p>
<p>I think that we would not recognize aliens.</p>
<p>And if someone doesn&rsquo;t recognize you,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t go and talk to it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go and talk to ants.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go and talk to birds</p>
<p>or maybe some birds you do, right?</p>
<p>Cause you can, there&rsquo;s just enough cognition.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m saying because we don&rsquo;t have enough,</p>
<p>our cognitive abilities are not yet where they need to be.</p>
<p>We probably haven&rsquo;t been communicating with them.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t agree with the dating strategy</p>
<p>of playing hard to get?</p>
<p>Cause us humans, that seems to attract us.</p>
<p>Within a species, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But I think we don&rsquo;t actually have abstraction.</p>
<p>No, actually I think in this talk, in this conversation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve helped me crystallize something</p>
<p>that I think has been troubling me for a long time</p>
<p>with the thermi paradox.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that a reasonable avenue</p>
<p>is to say that you would not go and talk to your cat</p>
<p>about calculus, right?</p>
<p>But I would still pet it.</p>
<p>Sure, but I&rsquo;m not talking about petting a cat.</p>
<p>The analogy is that the aliens are not going to talk to us</p>
<p>because we, and I&rsquo;m using calculus as analogy</p>
<p>for abstraction because we lack the layer,</p>
<p>the fundamental layer of understanding what life is</p>
<p>and what the universe is in our reality</p>
<p>that it would be so counterproductive</p>
<p>interacting with intelligent alien species</p>
<p>that it would cause more angst for human race.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Okay, they gotta be self interested.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll probably, they more care about</p>
<p>is it interesting for them?</p>
<p>Maybe they, I mean, surely there&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>to pet the cat in this analogy</p>
<p>because even if we lack complete understanding,</p>
<p>it must be a very frustrating experience</p>
<p>for other kinds of intelligence to communicate with us.</p>
<p>Still, there must be a way to interact with us.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Like perturb the system in interesting ways</p>
<p>to see what these creatures do.</p>
<p>We might actually find the answer.</p>
<p>I mean, again, out of my pay grade,</p>
<p>in a simulation of the Earth,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a simulation where we allow</p>
<p>an intelligent AI to emerge, right?</p>
<p>And that AI, we then give it the objective</p>
<p>is to be curious, interact with other intelligence</p>
<p>in its universe.</p>
<p>And then we might find the parameters required</p>
<p>for that AI to walk with.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;ll find if the AI will not talk</p>
<p>to other AIs that don&rsquo;t share the ability</p>
<p>to abstract at the level of the AI</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just a cat and are you gonna travel</p>
<p>20 light years to go and pet a cat?</p>
<p>So not because of the inability to do so,</p>
<p>but because of like boredom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more interested, it will start talking to,</p>
<p>it will spend most, it will spend a majority</p>
<p>of its time talking to other AI systems</p>
<p>that can at least somewhat understand</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s much more fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit like, do we know that plants are conscious?</p>
<p>Well, plants are unconscious in the way we typically think,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t talk to them.</p>
<p>They could be, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s a lot of people on Earth</p>
<p>who like gardening.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always going to be a weird.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not talking, they&rsquo;re just gardening.</p>
<p>Okay, well, you&rsquo;re not romantic enough</p>
<p>to see gardening as a way of communication</p>
<p>between humans and plants.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, you&rsquo;ve got me there.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s ways, there&rsquo;s always going to be</p>
<p>the people who are curious.</p>
<p>Jane Goodall who lives with the chimps, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always going to be curious intelligent species</p>
<p>that visit the weird Earth planet and try to interact.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a, yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a super cool idea</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re expressing.</p>
<p>I just kind of have a sense.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a hope that there&rsquo;s always going to be</p>
<p>a desire to interact even with those</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t possibly understand the depth</p>
<p>of what you understand.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m with you, so I want to be as positive as you</p>
<p>that aliens do exist and we will interact with them.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to do is to give you</p>
<p>a reasonable hypothesis why we haven&rsquo;t yet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also something to strive for to be able to do that.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, there is the other view</p>
<p>that the universe is just too big</p>
<p>and life is just too rare.</p>
<p>But I want to come up with an alternative explanation</p>
<p>which I think is reasonable and not being philosophically</p>
<p>and scientifically thought out, which is this,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t actually communicate with the object,</p>
<p>the thing competently, you don&rsquo;t even know it&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s no point yet.</p>
<p>See, I disagree with that, but I&rsquo;m totally aligned</p>
<p>with your hopeful vision, which is like,</p>
<p>we need to understand the origin of life.</p>
<p>It will help us engineer life.</p>
<p>It will help us engineer intelligent life through perhaps</p>
<p>on the computer side through simulation</p>
<p>and explore all the ways that life emerges.</p>
<p>And that will allow us to, I think the fundamental reason</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t see overwhelming amounts of life</p>
<p>is I actually believe aliens,</p>
<p>of course, these are all just kind of open minded beliefs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to know for sure about any of this,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s a lot of alien civilizations</p>
<p>which are actively communicating with us and we&rsquo;re too dumb.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the right tools to see it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>No, but maybe I misinterpreted you,</p>
<p>but I interpreted you to say they kind of tried a few times</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, oh God.</p>
<p>No, no, no, what I&rsquo;m saying is we, so this goes two ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with you.</p>
<p>There could be information out there,</p>
<p>but just put in such a way</p>
<p>that we just don&rsquo;t understand it yet.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So sorry if I didn&rsquo;t make that clear.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not just, I don&rsquo;t think we,</p>
<p>I think we qualify as soon as we can decode their signal.</p>
<p>Right, so when you say qualify, got it, got it.</p>
<p>So you mean, we&rsquo;re just not smart enough,</p>
<p>the word qualify was throwing me off.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not smart enough to do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we just need to get smarter.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of people who believe,</p>
<p>let me get your opinion on this, about UFO sightings.</p>
<p>So sightings of weird phenomena</p>
<p>that, you know, what does UFO mean?</p>
<p>It means it&rsquo;s a flying object</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not identified clearly at the time of sighting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what UFO means.</p>
<p>So it could be a physics phenomena,</p>
<p>it could be ball lightning,</p>
<p>it could be all kinds of fascinating.</p>
<p>I was always fascinated with ball lightning as a,</p>
<p>like the fact that there could be physical phenomena</p>
<p>in this world that are observable by the human eye.</p>
<p>Of course, all physical phenomena generally are fascinating</p>
<p>that really smart people can&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like, wait a minute,</p>
<p>especially if you can replicate it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, wait a minute, how does this happen?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the precursor to giant discoveries</p>
<p>in chemistry and biology and physics and so on.</p>
<p>But it sucks when those events are super rare, right?</p>
<p>Physically, like ball lightning.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>And then of course that phenomena</p>
<p>could have other interpretations</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have to do with the physics of chemistry,</p>
<p>the biology of earth.</p>
<p>It could have to do</p>
<p>with more extraterrestrial explanations</p>
<p>that in large part, thanks to Hollywood and movies</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>captivates the imaginations of millions of people.</p>
<p>But just because it&rsquo;s science fiction</p>
<p>that captivates the imagination of people,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that some of those sightings,</p>
<p>all it takes is one.</p>
<p>One of those sightings is actually a sign</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s extraterrestrial intelligence,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s object that&rsquo;s not of this particular world.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a chance that that&rsquo;s the case?</p>
<p>What do you make, especially the pilot sightings,</p>
<p>what do you make of those?</p>
<p>So I agree with there&rsquo;s a chance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a chance.</p>
<p>Any good scientist would have to,</p>
<p>or observationist would have to,</p>
<p>I want to see if aliens exist come to earth.</p>
<p>What I know about the universe</p>
<p>is I think it&rsquo;s unlikely right now</p>
<p>that there are aliens visiting us, but not impossible.</p>
<p>I think the releases, the dramatization</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been happening politically</p>
<p>saying we&rsquo;re gonna release all this information,</p>
<p>this classified information.</p>
<p>I was kind of disappointed</p>
<p>because it was just very poor material.</p>
<p>And right now, the ability to capture high resolution video,</p>
<p>everybody is carrying around</p>
<p>with them an incredible video device now.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t got more compelling data.</p>
<p>And so that we&rsquo;ve just seeing grainy pictures,</p>
<p>a lot of hearsay, instrument kind of malfunctions</p>
<p>and whatnot.</p>
<p>And so I think on balance, I think it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely,</p>
<p>but I think something really interesting is happening.</p>
<p>And then also during the pandemic, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been locked down.</p>
<p>We all want to have,</p>
<p>we want to, our imaginations are running riot.</p>
<p>And I think that the,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the information out there</p>
<p>has convinced me there are any,</p>
<p>anything interesting on the UFO side.</p>
<p>But what it has made me very interested about</p>
<p>is how humanity is opening up its mind to ponder aliens</p>
<p>and the mystery of our universe.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t want to dissuade people</p>
<p>from having those thoughts and say, you&rsquo;re stupid</p>
<p>and look at that, it&rsquo;s clearly incorrect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>What I would say is that I lack sufficient data,</p>
<p>replicated observations to make me go,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m gonna take this seriously,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m really interested by the fact</p>
<p>that there is this great deal of interest.</p>
<p>And I think that it drives me</p>
<p>to maybe want to make an artificial life form even more</p>
<p>and to help NASA and the Air Force</p>
<p>and whoever go and look for things even more,</p>
<p>because I think humanity wants to know what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this yearning, isn&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I see, I almost,</p>
<p>depending on the day, I sometimes agree with you,</p>
<p>but with the thing you just said,</p>
<p>but one of the disappointing things to me</p>
<p>about the sightings, I still hold the belief</p>
<p>that a nonzero number of them</p>
<p>is an indication of something very interesting.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t side with the people who say</p>
<p>everything can be explained</p>
<p>with sensor artifacts kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with you.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that either.</p>
<p>I would say I just don&rsquo;t have enough data.</p>
<p>But the thing I want to push back on is the statement</p>
<p>that everybody has a high definition camera.</p>
<p>One of the disappointing things to me</p>
<p>about the report that the government released,</p>
<p>but in general, just having worked with government,</p>
<p>having worked with people all over</p>
<p>is how incompetent we are.</p>
<p>Like if you look at the response to the pandemic,</p>
<p>how incompetent we are in the face of great challenges</p>
<p>without great leadership.</p>
<p>How incompetent we are in the face</p>
<p>of the great mysteries before us without great leadership.</p>
<p>And I just think it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>the fact that there&rsquo;s a lot of high definition cameras</p>
<p>is not enough to capture the full richness of weird,</p>
<p>of the mysterious phenomena out there</p>
<p>of which extraterrestrial intelligence visiting Earth</p>
<p>could be one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think everybody having a smartphone</p>
<p>in their pocket is enough.</p>
<p>I think that allows for TikTok videos.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it allows for the capture</p>
<p>of even interesting, relatively rare human events.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not that common.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare to have been the right moment in the right time</p>
<p>to be able to capture the thing.</p>
<p>I agree, I agree.</p>
<p>Let me rephrase what I think on this.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen enough information.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really actively sorted out.</p>
<p>I must admit, but I&rsquo;m with you</p>
<p>and I love the idea of anomaly detection</p>
<p>in chemistry in particular, right?</p>
<p>I want to make anomalies, sorry,</p>
<p>or not necessarily make anomalies.</p>
<p>I want to understand an anomaly.</p>
<p>Let me give you two from chemistry,</p>
<p>which are really quite interesting.</p>
<p>Phlogiston, going way back,</p>
<p>where people said there&rsquo;s this thing called phlogiston.</p>
<p>And for ages, the alchemists got really this kind of,</p>
<p>that fire is the thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>And then we determined that phlogiston</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t what we thought it is.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to physics, the ether.</p>
<p>The ether&rsquo;s a hard one</p>
<p>because I think actually the ether might exist.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think the ether is later.</p>
<p>Can you explain the ether?</p>
<p>So as the vacuum,</p>
<p>so the light traveling through the ether in the vacuum,</p>
<p>there is some thing that we call the ether</p>
<p>that basically mediates the movement of light, say.</p>
<p>And I think that&hellip;</p>
<p>And then the other one is cold fusion,</p>
<p>which is more of a&hellip;</p>
<p>So a few years ago,</p>
<p>people observed that when they did some electrochemistry,</p>
<p>when they were splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen,</p>
<p>that you got more energy out than you put in.</p>
<p>And people got excited</p>
<p>and they thought that this was a nuclear reaction.</p>
<p>And in the end, it was kind of discredited</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t detect neutrons and all this stuff.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m pretty sure&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a chemist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you this on your podcast, but why not?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>electrochemical phenomena</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not completely bottomed out yet,</p>
<p>that there is something there.</p>
<p>However, we lack the technology and the experimental design.</p>
<p>So all I&rsquo;m saying in your response about aliens</p>
<p>is we lack the experimental design</p>
<p>to really capture these anomalies.</p>
<p>And we are encircling the planet</p>
<p>with many more detection systems.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got satellites everywhere.</p>
<p>So there is, I do hope</p>
<p>that we are gonna discover more anomalies.</p>
<p>And remember that the solar system</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just static in space,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s moving through the universe.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just more and more chance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not what with Avi Loeb.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s generating all sorts of kind of a cult,</p>
<p>I would say, with this, but I&rsquo;m not against him.</p>
<p>I think there is a finite chance</p>
<p>if there are aliens in the universe</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna happen upon them</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re moving through the universe.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the nature of the following that Avi Loeb has?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doubling down more and more and more</p>
<p>and say there are aliens,</p>
<p>interdimensional aliens and everything else, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gone from space junk accelerating out of</p>
<p>to interdimensional stuff in a very short space of time.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s obviously bored.</p>
<p>Or he wants to tap into the psyche and understand.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s playfully kind of trying to interact</p>
<p>with society and his peers to say,</p>
<p>stop saying it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>Which I agree with, we shouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>But we should frame it statistically</p>
<p>in the same way we should frame everything</p>
<p>as good scientists, statistically.</p>
<p>Yeah, good scientists.</p>
<p>Recently, the idea of good scientists is,</p>
<p>I take quite skeptically.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of scientists</p>
<p>tell me about what is good science.</p>
<p>That makes me sad.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve been interviewing</p>
<p>what I would consider a lot of really good scientists.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>A lot of great thinkers.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>And most of the people I talk to</p>
<p>are incredible human beings.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a humility that&rsquo;s required.</p>
<p>Science is not, science cannot be dogmatism.</p>
<p>Sure, I agree.</p>
<p>I mean, authority, like a PhD does not give you authority.</p>
<p>A lifelong pursuit of a particular task</p>
<p>does not give you authority.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just as lost in clues as everybody else.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re more curious and more stubborn.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a nice quality to have.</p>
<p>But overall, just using the word science and statistics</p>
<p>can often, as you know, kind of become a catalyst</p>
<p>for dismissing new ideas, out of the box ideas, wild ideas,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, yes and no.</p>
<p>I think that, so I like to,</p>
<p>some people find me extremely annoying in science</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m basically, I&rsquo;m quite rude and disruptive.</p>
<p>Not in a rude, you know,</p>
<p>some up to people and say they&rsquo;re ugly or stupid</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>I just say, you know, you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>Or why do you think this?</p>
<p>And something, a gift I got given by society</p>
<p>when I was very young,</p>
<p>because I was in the learning difficulties class at school</p>
<p>is I was told I was stupid.</p>
<p>And so I know I&rsquo;m stupid,</p>
<p>but I always wanted to be smart, right?</p>
<p>I remember going to school going,</p>
<p>maybe today they&rsquo;re going to tell me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as stupid as I was yesterday.</p>
<p>And I was always disappointed, always.</p>
<p>And so when I went into academia and everyone says,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re wrong, I was like, join the queue.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because it allowed me to walk through the wall.</p>
<p>So I think that people like to always imagine science</p>
<p>as a bit like living in a Japanese house,</p>
<p>the paper walls, and everyone sits in their room.</p>
<p>And I annoy people because I walk straight through the wall.</p>
<p>Not because, why should I be a chemist</p>
<p>and not a mathematician?</p>
<p>Why should I be a mathematician and not a computer scientist?</p>
<p>Because if the problem requires us</p>
<p>to walk through those walls,</p>
<p>but I like walking through the walls.</p>
<p>But as long, then I have to put up,</p>
<p>you know, I have to do good science.</p>
<p>I have to win the people in those rooms</p>
<p>across by good science,</p>
<p>by taking their criticisms and addressing them head on.</p>
<p>And I think we must do that.</p>
<p>And I think that I try and do that in my own way.</p>
<p>And I kind of love walking through the walls.</p>
<p>And it gives me, it&rsquo;s difficult for me personally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite painful,</p>
<p>but it always leads to a deeper understanding</p>
<p>of the people I&rsquo;m with.</p>
<p>In particular, you know, the arguments I have</p>
<p>with all sorts of interesting minds,</p>
<p>because I want to solve the problem,</p>
<p>or I want to understand more about why I exist.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s it really.</p>
<p>And I think we have to not dismiss science</p>
<p>on that basis.</p>
<p>I think we can work with science.</p>
<p>No, science is beautiful,</p>
<p>but humans with egos and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>can sometimes misuse good things,</p>
<p>like social justice,</p>
<p>like all ideas we&rsquo;re all aspire to misuse</p>
<p>these beautiful ideas to manipulate people,</p>
<p>to all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s assholes in every space</p>
<p>and walk of life, including science.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>And those are no good.</p>
<p>But yes, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The scientific method has proven to be quite useful.</p>
<p>That said, for difficult questions,</p>
<p>for difficult explanations for rare phenomena,</p>
<p>you have to walk cautiously.</p>
<p>Because the scientific method,</p>
<p>when you totally don&rsquo;t understand something,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s rare, and you can&rsquo;t replicate it,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t quite apply.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>The challenge is to not dismiss the anomaly</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t replicate it.</p>
<p>I mean, we can talk about this.</p>
<p>This is something I realized</p>
<p>when we were developing assembly theory.</p>
<p>People thinking that the track they&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>is so dogmatic, but there is this thing that they see,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>And it takes a bit of time</p>
<p>and you just have to keep reframing it.</p>
<p>And my approach is to say, well, why can&rsquo;t this be right?</p>
<p>Why must we accept that RNA is the only way into life?</p>
<p>I mean, who said?</p>
<p>Does RNA have a special class of information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s encoded in the universe?</p>
<p>No, of course it doesn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>RNA is not a special molecule</p>
<p>in the space of all the other molecules.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so elegant and simple</p>
<p>and it works so well for the evolutionary process</p>
<p>that we kind of use that as an intuition</p>
<p>to explain that that must be the only way to have life.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But you mentioned assembly theory.</p>
<p>Well, first let me pause, bathroom break, needed?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s take two minutes.</p>
<p>We took a quick break and offline,</p>
<p>you mentioned to me that you have a lab in your home.</p>
<p>And then I said that you&rsquo;re basically Rick</p>
<p>from Rick and Morty,</p>
<p>which is something I&rsquo;ve been thinking</p>
<p>this whole conversation.</p>
<p>And then you say that there&rsquo;s a glowing pickle</p>
<p>that you used something involving cold plasma, I believe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but can you explain</p>
<p>the glowing pickle situation?</p>
<p>And is there many, arbitrarily many versions of you</p>
<p>in alternate dimensions that you&rsquo;re aware of?</p>
<p>I tried to make an electrochemical memory at home</p>
<p>using a pickle and the only way I could get</p>
<p>any traction with it was actually by plugging it</p>
<p>into a very high voltage alternating current</p>
<p>and then putting in a couple of electrodes.</p>
<p>But my kids weren&rsquo;t impressed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not impressed with anything I do,</p>
<p>any experiments I do at home.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s quite funny.</p>
<p>But you connected a pickle to some electrode.</p>
<p>240 volts, yeah, AC.</p>
<p>And then had a couple of electrodes on it.</p>
<p>So what happens is a pickle,</p>
<p>this is a classic thing you do.</p>
<p>I mean, I shouldn&rsquo;t, pranks you do,</p>
<p>you put a pickle into the mains</p>
<p>and just leave it, run away and leave it.</p>
<p>And what happens is it starts to decompose.</p>
<p>It heats up and then explodes</p>
<p>because the water turns to steam</p>
<p>and it just violently explodes.</p>
<p>But I wondered if I could cause the iron,</p>
<p>sodium, potassium ions in the pickle to migrate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d been in a jar, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d been in a brine.</p>
<p>That was, yeah, that was not my best experiment.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve done far better experiments in my lab at home.</p>
<p>At that time it was a failed experiment,</p>
<p>but you never know, it could,</p>
<p>every experiment is a successful experiment</p>
<p>if you stick with it long enough.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I get, I got kicked out of my own lab</p>
<p>by my research team many years ago and for good reason.</p>
<p>I mean, my team is brilliant</p>
<p>and I used to go and just break things.</p>
<p>So what I do do at home</p>
<p>is I have a kind of electronics workshop</p>
<p>and I prototype experiments there.</p>
<p>Then I try and then I try and suggest to my team sometimes,</p>
<p>maybe we can try this thing.</p>
<p>And they would just say, oh,</p>
<p>wow, that&rsquo;s not gonna work because of this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say, aha, but actually I&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s some code and here&rsquo;s some hardware.</p>
<p>Can we have a go?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m doing that less and less now</p>
<p>as I get even more busy, but that&rsquo;s quite fun</p>
<p>because they feel that we&rsquo;re in the experiment together.</p>
<p>You do, in fact, brilliantly, just like Rick</p>
<p>from Rick and Morty, connect up chemistry with computation.</p>
<p>And when we say chemistry,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t mean the simulation of chemistry,</p>
<p>a modeling of chemistry.</p>
<p>We mean chemistry in the physical space</p>
<p>as well as in the digital space, which is fascinating.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that.</p>
<p>But first you mentioned assembly theory.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll stick on theory in these big ideas.</p>
<p>I would say revolutionary ideas,</p>
<p>this intersection between mathematics and philosophy.</p>
<p>What is assembly theory?</p>
<p>And generally speaking, how would we recognize life</p>
<p>if we saw it?</p>
<p>So assembly theory is a theory,</p>
<p>goes back a few years now in my struggle</p>
<p>for maybe almost 10 years</p>
<p>when I was going to origin of life conferences</p>
<p>and artificial life conferences,</p>
<p>where I thought that everybody was dancing</p>
<p>around the problem of what life is and what it does.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you about what assembly theory is</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>So assembly theory literally says if you take an object,</p>
<p>any given object,</p>
<p>and you are able to break the object into parts very gently.</p>
<p>So just maybe let&rsquo;s say take a piece</p>
<p>of very intricate Chinese porcelain</p>
<p>and you tap it just with a hammer or the nail at some point,</p>
<p>and it will fragment into many parts.</p>
<p>And if that object is able to fragment into many,</p>
<p>and you count those parts, the different parts,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re unsymmetrical,</p>
<p>assembly theory says the larger the number of parts,</p>
<p>unsymmetrical parts that object has,</p>
<p>the more likely it is that object has been created</p>
<p>by an evolutionary or information process,</p>
<p>especially if that object is not one off,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got an abundance of them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>So because what I&rsquo;m literally saying about the abundance,</p>
<p>if you have a one off object and you break it into parts</p>
<p>and it has lots of parts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say, well, that could be incredibly intricate</p>
<p>and complex, but it could be just random.</p>
<p>And I was troubled with this for years</p>
<p>because I saw in reality that assembly theory works.</p>
<p>But when I talked to very good</p>
<p>computational complexity computation lists,</p>
<p>algorithmic complexity people,</p>
<p>they said, you haven&rsquo;t really done this properly.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t thought about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is the random problem.</p>
<p>And so I kept working this up</p>
<p>because I invented an assembly theory in chemistry,</p>
<p>first of all, with molecules.</p>
<p>And so the thought experiment was,</p>
<p>how complex does a molecule need to be when I find it</p>
<p>that it couldn&rsquo;t possibly have risen by chance,</p>
<p>probabilistically.</p>
<p>And if I found this molecule,</p>
<p>able to detect it enough quantities in the same object,</p>
<p>like a machine, like a mass spectrometer.</p>
<p>So typically in a mass spectrometer,</p>
<p>you weigh the molecules in electric field.</p>
<p>You probably have to have all the order of 10,000</p>
<p>identical molecules to get a signal.</p>
<p>So 10,000 identical molecules that are complex.</p>
<p>What is the chance of them occurring by chance?</p>
<p>Well, we can do the math.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a molecule like strychnine</p>
<p>or, yeah, so strychnine is a good molecule actually to take</p>
<p>or Viagra is a good molecule.</p>
<p>I made jokes about Viagra because it&rsquo;s a complex molecule.</p>
<p>And one of my friends said, yeah,</p>
<p>if we find Viagra on Mars in detectable quantities,</p>
<p>we know something is up.</p>
<p>And yeah, but anyway, it&rsquo;s a complex molecule.</p>
<p>So what you do is you take this molecule</p>
<p>in the mass spectrometer and you hit it with some electrons</p>
<p>or in electric field and it breaks apart.</p>
<p>And if the larger the number of different parts,</p>
<p>you know when it starts to get refreshed,</p>
<p>my idea was that that molecule could not be created</p>
<p>by chance, probabilistically.</p>
<p>So that was where assembly theory was born</p>
<p>in an experiment, in a mass spec experiment.</p>
<p>And I was thinking about this</p>
<p>because NASA is sending mass spectrometers to Mars,</p>
<p>to Titan, it&rsquo;s gonna send them to Europa.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a nuclear powered mass spectrometer</p>
<p>going to Titan.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the coolest experiment ever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not only sending a drone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna fly around Titan,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be powered by a nuclear slug, a nuclear battery,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna have a mass spectrometer on it.</p>
<p>Is this already launched?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s Dragonfly</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be launched in a few years.</p>
<p>I think it got pushed a year because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s three or four years.</p>
<p>Dragonfly, nuclear Dragonfly is going to fly to Titan</p>
<p>and collect data about the composition</p>
<p>of the various chemicals on Titan.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m trying to convince NASA.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be able to convince</p>
<p>the Dragonfly team that they should apply this approach,</p>
<p>but they will get data.</p>
<p>And depending on how good their mass spectrometer is.</p>
<p>But I had this thought experiment anyway,</p>
<p>and I did this thought experiment.</p>
<p>And for me, it seemed to work.</p>
<p>I turned the thought experiment into an algorithm</p>
<p>in assembly theory.</p>
<p>And I basically, assembly theory, if I take,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just make it generic.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s just take the word abracadabra.</p>
<p>Say, can I, if you find the word,</p>
<p>so if you have a book with lots of words in it</p>
<p>and you find abracadabra one off,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a rap book that&rsquo;s been written by,</p>
<p>in a random way, set of monkeys in a room.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re on typewriters.</p>
<p>And you find one off abracadabra,</p>
<p>no big deal.</p>
<p>But if you find lots of recurrences of abracadabra,</p>
<p>well, that means something weird is going on.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s think about the assembly number of abracadabra.</p>
<p>So abracadabra has a number of letters in it.</p>
<p>You can break it down.</p>
<p>So you just cut the letters up.</p>
<p>But when you actually reassemble abracadabra,</p>
<p>the minimum number of ways of organizing those letters.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have an A, a B, and keep going up.</p>
<p>When you cut abracadabra up into parts,</p>
<p>you can put it together again in seven steps.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>That means if you basically don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowed to reuse things</p>
<p>you make in a chain at the beginning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the memory of the universe,</p>
<p>the process that makes abracadabra.</p>
<p>And because of that causal chain,</p>
<p>you can then get to abracadabra</p>
<p>quicker than the number of letters</p>
<p>for having to specify only in seven.</p>
<p>So if you take that to a molecule</p>
<p>and you cut the molecule up into parts,</p>
<p>and you can, on the causal chain,</p>
<p>and you basically start with the atoms</p>
<p>and then bonds, and then you randomly add on those parts</p>
<p>to make the A, make the B, and keep going all the way up,</p>
<p>I found that literally, assembly theory</p>
<p>allows me to say how compressed a molecule is.</p>
<p>So when there&rsquo;s some information in there.</p>
<p>And I realized assembly theory</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just confined to molecular space.</p>
<p>It can apply to anything.</p>
<p>But let me finish the molecular argument.</p>
<p>So what I did is I had this theory.</p>
<p>I, with one of my students, we wrote an algorithm.</p>
<p>We basically took the 20 million molecules from a database</p>
<p>and we just calculate their assembly number.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the index.</p>
<p>Like basically, if I take a molecule</p>
<p>and I cut it up into bonds,</p>
<p>what is the minimum number of steps I need to take</p>
<p>to reform that molecule from atoms?</p>
<p>So reusability of previously formed things</p>
<p>is somehow a fundamental part of what it is.</p>
<p>Exactly, it&rsquo;s like a memory in the universe, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making lots of leaps here.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s kind of weird.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, right, there&rsquo;s a process</p>
<p>that can form the A and the B and the C, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And then because we&rsquo;ve formed A and B before,</p>
<p>we can use A and B again with no extra cost except one unit.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the kind of what the chain of events.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you think about memory here</p>
<p>when you say the universe,</p>
<p>when you talk about the universe</p>
<p>or life is the universe creating memory.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So we went through chemical space</p>
<p>and we looked at the assembly numbers.</p>
<p>We were able to classify it.</p>
<p>So, okay, let&rsquo;s test it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re able to take a whole bunch of molecules</p>
<p>and assign an assembly index to them, okay?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a function of the number of bonds</p>
<p>in the molecule and how much symmetry.</p>
<p>So literally assembly theory is a measure</p>
<p>of how little symmetry a molecule has.</p>
<p>And so the more asymmetry, the more information,</p>
<p>the more weird it is,</p>
<p>like a Jackson Pollock of some description.</p>
<p>So I then went and did a load of experiments.</p>
<p>And I basically took those molecules,</p>
<p>I cut them up in the mass spec</p>
<p>and measured the number of peaks</p>
<p>without any knowledge of the molecule.</p>
<p>And we found the assembly number,</p>
<p>there was almost not quite a one to one correlation,</p>
<p>but almost because not all bonds are equal.</p>
<p>They have different energies.</p>
<p>I then did this using two other spectroscopic techniques,</p>
<p>NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance,</p>
<p>which uses radio frequency to basically jangle the molecules</p>
<p>and get a signature out.</p>
<p>And I also used infrared.</p>
<p>And infrared and NMR almost gave us a one to one correlation.</p>
<p>So what am I saying?</p>
<p>Saying by taking a molecule</p>
<p>and doing either infrared or NMR or mass spec,</p>
<p>I can work out how many parts there are in that molecule</p>
<p>and then put it on a scale.</p>
<p>And what we did in the next part of the work</p>
<p>is we took molecules randomly from the environment,</p>
<p>from outer space, from all around earth,</p>
<p>from the sea, from Antarctica,</p>
<p>and from fossils and so on.</p>
<p>And even NASA, because they didn&rsquo;t believe us,</p>
<p>blinded some samples.</p>
<p>And we found that all these samples that came from biology</p>
<p>produced molecules that had a very high assembly number</p>
<p>above a threshold of about 15.</p>
<p>So basically all the stuff that came</p>
<p>from an ebiotic origin was low.</p>
<p>There was no complexity there.</p>
<p>So we suddenly realized that on earth at least,</p>
<p>there is a cutoff that natural phenomena</p>
<p>cannot produce molecules</p>
<p>that need more than 15 steps to make them.</p>
<p>So I realized that this is a way to make a scale of life,</p>
<p>a scale of technology as well.</p>
<p>And literally you could just go sniffing for molecules</p>
<p>off earth, on Titan, on Mars.</p>
<p>And when you find a molecule in the mass spectrometer</p>
<p>that gives you more than 15 parts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll know pretty much for sure</p>
<p>that it had to be produced by evolution.</p>
<p>And this allowed me to come up with a general definition</p>
<p>of life based on assembly theory,</p>
<p>to say that if I find an object that has a large number</p>
<p>of parts, say an iPhone or Boeing 747,</p>
<p>or any complex object and I can find it in abundance</p>
<p>and cut it up, I can tell you whether that has been produced</p>
<p>by an informational process or not.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what assembly theory kind of does.</p>
<p>But it goes a bit further.</p>
<p>I then realized that this isn&rsquo;t just about life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about causation.</p>
<p>So actually it tells you about</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a causal structure.</p>
<p>So now I can look at objects in the universe,</p>
<p>say that again, this cup and say, right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna look at how many independent parts it has.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the assembly number.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll then look at the abundance, how many cups?</p>
<p>There are two on this table,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a few more you got stashed away.</p>
<p>So assembly is a function of the complexity of the object</p>
<p>times the number of copy numbers of that object</p>
<p>or a function of the copy number normalized.</p>
<p>So I realized there&rsquo;s a new quantity in the universe.</p>
<p>You have energy, entropy, and assembly.</p>
<p>So assembly, the way we should think about that</p>
<p>is how much reusability there is.</p>
<p>Because reusability is like,</p>
<p>can you play devil&rsquo;s advocate to this?</p>
<p>So could this just be a nice tertiary signal</p>
<p>for living organisms?</p>
<p>Like some kind of distant signal that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>yeah, this is a nice property,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not capturing something fundamental.</p>
<p>Or do you think reusability is something fundamental</p>
<p>to life and complex organisms?</p>
<p>I think reusability is fundamental in the universe,</p>
<p>not just for life and complex organisms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about causation.</p>
<p>So I think assembly tells you if you find objects,</p>
<p>cause you can do this with trajectories as well.</p>
<p>You think about it,</p>
<p>that the fact there are objects in the universe on earth</p>
<p>is weird.</p>
<p>You think about it,</p>
<p>we should just have a combinatorial explosion of stuff.</p>
<p>The fact that not everything exists is really weird.</p>
<p>Now then.</p>
<p>And then as I&rsquo;m looking at two mugs and two water bottles</p>
<p>and the things that exist kind of are similar</p>
<p>and multiply in copies of each other.</p>
<p>So I would say that assembly allows you to do something</p>
<p>that statistical mechanics and people looking at entropy</p>
<p>have got stuck with for a while.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m making, it&rsquo;s pretty bold.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m writing a paper with Sarah Walker</p>
<p>on this at the moment.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re realizing,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to get ahead of ourselves</p>
<p>because I think that there&rsquo;s lots of ways where this is,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a really interesting idea.</p>
<p>It works for molecules and it appears to work</p>
<p>for any objects produced by causation.</p>
<p>Cause you can take a motor car,</p>
<p>you can look at the assembly of the motor car,</p>
<p>look at a book, look at the assembly of the book.</p>
<p>Assembly theory tells you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way of compressing and reusing.</p>
<p>And so when people, I talk to information theorists,</p>
<p>they say, oh, this is just logical depth.</p>
<p>I say, it is like logical depth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s experimentally measurable.</p>
<p>They say, oh, it&rsquo;s a bit like Komogolov complexity.</p>
<p>And so, but it&rsquo;s computable.</p>
<p>And now, okay, it&rsquo;s not infinitely computable,</p>
<p>gets MP hard very quickly, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard problem when you could get,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a computable enough,</p>
<p>you could tractable enough to be able to tell</p>
<p>the difference between a molecule</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been formed by the random background</p>
<p>and by causation.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because until now there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>of measuring complexity objectively.</p>
<p>Complexity has required algorithmic comparisons</p>
<p>and programs and human beings to label things.</p>
<p>Assembly is label free.</p>
<p>Well, not entirely.</p>
<p>We can talk about what that means in a minute.</p>
<p>Okay, my brain has been broken a couple of times here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I explained it really badly.</p>
<p>No, it was very well explained.</p>
<p>It was just fascinating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, my brain is broken into pieces</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to assemble it.</p>
<p>So MP hard.</p>
<p>So when you have a molecule,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to figure out, okay,</p>
<p>if we were to reuse parts of this molecule,</p>
<p>which parts can we reuse as an optimization problem,</p>
<p>and be hard to figure out the minimum amount</p>
<p>of reused components that will create this molecule.</p>
<p>And it becomes difficult when you start</p>
<p>to look at a huge, huge molecules, arbitrarily large.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m also like mapping this.</p>
<p>Can I think about this in complexity generally,</p>
<p>like looking at a cellular automata system</p>
<p>and saying like, what&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>can this be used as a measure of complexity</p>
<p>for like a arbitrarily complicated system?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it can.</p>
<p>It can.</p>
<p>And I think that the question is, and what&rsquo;s the benefit?</p>
<p>Cause there&rsquo;s plenty of, I mean,</p>
<p>in computer science and mathematics and in physics,</p>
<p>people have been really seriously studying complexity</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a really interesting problems</p>
<p>of where we course grade and we lose information.</p>
<p>And all assembly theory does really,</p>
<p>assembly theory just explains weak emergence.</p>
<p>And so what assembly theory says, look,</p>
<p>going from the atoms that interact,</p>
<p>those first replicators that build one another,</p>
<p>assembly at the minimal level just tells you evidence</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s been replication and selection.</p>
<p>And I think the more selected something is,</p>
<p>the higher the assembly.</p>
<p>And so we were able to start to know</p>
<p>how to look for selection in the universe.</p>
<p>If you go to the moon,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing a very high assembly on the moon</p>
<p>except the human artifacts we&rsquo;ve left there.</p>
<p>So again, let&rsquo;s go back to the sandbox.</p>
<p>In assembly theory says,</p>
<p>if all the sand grains could stick together,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the infinite combinatorial explosion</p>
<p>in the universe, that should be the default.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s assemble sand grains together</p>
<p>and do them in every possible way.</p>
<p>So we have a series of minimal operations</p>
<p>that can move the sand together.</p>
<p>But all that doesn&rsquo;t exist either.</p>
<p>Now, because we have specific memory where we say,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re gonna put three sand grains in line</p>
<p>or four and make a cross or a triangle</p>
<p>or something unsymmetrical.</p>
<p>And once we&rsquo;ve made the triangle</p>
<p>and the unsymmetrical thing, we remember that,</p>
<p>we can use it again, cause on that causal chain.</p>
<p>So what assembly theory allows you to do</p>
<p>is go to the actual object that you exist,</p>
<p>you find in space.</p>
<p>And actually the way you get there is by disassembling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disassembly theory works by disassembling objects</p>
<p>you have and understanding the steps to create them.</p>
<p>And it works for molecules beautifully</p>
<p>cause you just break bonds.</p>
<p>But like you said, it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difficult problem to figure out</p>
<p>how to break them apart.</p>
<p>For molecules, it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>If you just keep low enough in molecular weight space,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good enough.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a complete theory.</p>
<p>When we start to think about objects,</p>
<p>we can start to assign,</p>
<p>we can start to think about things at different levels,</p>
<p>different atoms, what you assign as your atom.</p>
<p>So in a molecule, the atom, this is really confusing</p>
<p>cause the word atom, I mean smallest breakable part.</p>
<p>So in a molecule, the atom is the bond</p>
<p>cause you break bonds, not atoms, right?</p>
<p>So in a car, the atom might be, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a small amount of iron or the smallest reusable part,</p>
<p>a rivet, a piece of plastic or something.</p>
<p>So you gotta be really careful.</p>
<p>In a microprocessor, the atoms might be transistors.</p>
<p>And so the amount of assembly that something has</p>
<p>is a function, you have to look at the atom level.</p>
<p>What are your parts?</p>
<p>What are you counting?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things you get to choose.</p>
<p>What is, at what scale is the atom?</p>
<p>What is the minimal thing?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a huge amounts of trade offs</p>
<p>in when you approach a system and try to analyze.</p>
<p>Like if you approach Earth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an alien civilization trying to study Earth,</p>
<p>what is the atom for trying to measure</p>
<p>the complexity of life?</p>
<p>Is it, are humans the atoms?</p>
<p>I would say to start with, you just use molecules.</p>
<p>I can say for sure, if there are molecules</p>
<p>of sufficient complexity on Earth,</p>
<p>then I know that life has made them.</p>
<p>And then go further and show technology.</p>
<p>There are molecules that exist on Earth</p>
<p>that are not possible even by biology.</p>
<p>You needed technology</p>
<p>and you needed microprocessors to get there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>And that there&rsquo;s a correlation between that,</p>
<p>between the coolness of that and assembly number,</p>
<p>whatever the measure.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, what would you call the measure?</p>
<p>Assembly index.</p>
<p>Yeah, assembly index.</p>
<p>So there are three kind of fundamental</p>
<p>kind of labels we have.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the quantity of assembly</p>
<p>and the assembly, so if you have a box,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just have a box of molecules.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna have my box.</p>
<p>We count the number of identical molecules</p>
<p>and then we chop each molecule up</p>
<p>in an individual molecule class</p>
<p>and calculate the assembly number.</p>
<p>So basically you then have a function</p>
<p>that sums over all the molecules for each assembly</p>
<p>and then you divide through.</p>
<p>So you make it divide through</p>
<p>by the number of molecules.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the assembly index for the box?</p>
<p>So that will tell you the amount of assembly in the box.</p>
<p>So basically the assembly equation we come up with</p>
<p>is like basically the sum of e to the power</p>
<p>of the assembly index for molecule i</p>
<p>times the number of copies of the molecule i</p>
<p>and then you normalize.</p>
<p>So you sum them all up and then normalize.</p>
<p>So some boxes are gonna be more assembled than others.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what they tell me.</p>
<p>So if you were to look at me as a box,</p>
<p>so say I&rsquo;m a box, am I assembling my parts?</p>
<p>In terms of like, how do you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s my assembly index?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been gentle.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just, we&rsquo;ll talk about the molecules in you.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just take a pile of sand the same way as you</p>
<p>and I would take you and just cut up all the molecules.</p>
<p>I mean, and look at the number of copies</p>
<p>and assembly number.</p>
<p>So in sand, let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s probably gonna be</p>
<p>nothing more than assembly number of two or three,</p>
<p>but there might be trillions and trillions of sand grains.</p>
<p>In your body, there might be,</p>
<p>the assembly number is gonna be higher,</p>
<p>but there might not be as quite as many copies</p>
<p>because the molecular weight is higher.</p>
<p>So you do wanna average it out.</p>
<p>You can average, you do average it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not defined by the most impressive molecules.</p>
<p>No, no, you&rsquo;re an average in your volume.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we&rsquo;re just working this out,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s really cool is you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>a really high assembly.</p>
<p>The sand will have a very low assembly.</p>
<p>Your causal power is much higher.</p>
<p>You get to make decisions, you&rsquo;re alive, you&rsquo;re aspiring.</p>
<p>Assembly says something about causal power in the universe.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not supposed to exist</p>
<p>because physicists don&rsquo;t accept</p>
<p>that causation exists at the bottom.</p>
<p>So I understand at the chemical level</p>
<p>why the assembly causes causation.</p>
<p>Why is it causation?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s capturing the memory.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Capturing memory, but there&rsquo;s not an action to it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to see how it leads to life.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s what life does.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>What is life versus what does life do?</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s, this is the definition of life.</p>
<p>The only definition we need, right?</p>
<p>The assembly index.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically that life is able to create objects</p>
<p>in abundance that are so complex,</p>
<p>the assembly number is so high,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t possibly be formed in an environment</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s just random interactions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So suddenly you can put life on a scale.</p>
<p>And then life doesn&rsquo;t exist actually in that camp.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just how evolved you are.</p>
<p>And you as an object,</p>
<p>because you have incredible causal power,</p>
<p>you could go and, you can go and, you know,</p>
<p>launch rockets or build cars or create drugs,</p>
<p>or, you know, you can do so many things.</p>
<p>You can build stuff, build more artifacts</p>
<p>that show that you have had causal power.</p>
<p>And that causal power was this kind of a lineage.</p>
<p>And I think that over time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been realizing that physics as a discipline</p>
<p>has a number of problems associated with it.</p>
<p>Me as a chemist, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>that assembly theory, and I&rsquo;m really, you know,</p>
<p>I want to maintain some credibility in the physicists eyes,</p>
<p>but I have to push them because they,</p>
<p>physics is a really good discipline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reduced the number,</p>
<p>physics is about reducing the belief system,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re down to some things in their belief system,</p>
<p>which is kind of really makes me kind of grumpy.</p>
<p>Number one is requiring order</p>
<p>at the beginning of the universe magically.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need that.</p>
<p>The second is the second law.</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t actually need that.</p>
<p>And I&hellip;</p>
<p>This is blasphemous.</p>
<p>Well, in a minute, I&rsquo;ll recover my career in a second.</p>
<p>Although I think the good,</p>
<p>the only good thing about being the regis chair</p>
<p>means I think there has to be an act of parliament to fire me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you can always go to Lee&rsquo;s Twitter and protest.</p>
<p>And I think the third thing is that,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve got, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got the order at the beginning.</p>
<p>Second law.</p>
<p>The second law and the fact that causation is emergent,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And that time is emergent.</p>
<p>John Carroll just turned off this program.</p>
<p>I think he believes that it&rsquo;s emergent.</p>
<p>So causation is not&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s clearly incorrect</p>
<p>because we wouldn&rsquo;t exist otherwise.</p>
<p>So physicists have kind of got confused about time.</p>
<p>Time is a real thing.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, so look,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy with the current description</p>
<p>of the universe as physics give me,</p>
<p>because I can do a lot of stuff, right?</p>
<p>I can go to the moon with Newtonian physics, I think,</p>
<p>and I can understand the orbit of Mercury with relativity.</p>
<p>And so, and I can build transistors</p>
<p>with quantum mechanics, right?</p>
<p>And I can do all this stuff.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying the physics is wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, if we say that time is fundamental,</p>
<p>i.e. time is nonnegotiable, there&rsquo;s a global clock,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to require</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s order been magically made in the past</p>
<p>because that asymmetry is built into the way the universe is.</p>
<p>So if time is fundamental,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve been referring to this kind of</p>
<p>an interesting formulation of that is memory.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So time is hard to like put a finger on,</p>
<p>like what the hell are we talking about?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just the direction,</p>
<p>but memory is a construction,</p>
<p>especially when you have like,</p>
<p>think about these local pockets of complexity,</p>
<p>these nonzero assembly index entities</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being constructed and they remember.</p>
<p>Never forget molecules.</p>
<p>But remember, the thing is I invented assembly theory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you how I invented it.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I mean, the thing is,</p>
<p>I keep making fun of myself to my research group.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only ever had one idea.</p>
<p>I keep exploring that idea over the 40 years or so</p>
<p>since I had the idea.</p>
<p>I used to be a&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, aren&rsquo;t you the idea that the universe had?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very kind of hierarchical.</p>
<p>Anyway, go ahead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very poetic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I think I came up with assembly theory</p>
<p>with the following idea.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I was obsessed about survival kits.</p>
<p>What is the minimum stuff I would need</p>
<p>to basically replicate my reality?</p>
<p>And I love computers and I love technology</p>
<p>or what technology is gonna become.</p>
<p>So I imagined that I would have</p>
<p>basically this really big truck full of stuff.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, can I delete some of that stuff out?</p>
<p>Can I have a blueprint?</p>
<p>And then in the end, I kept making this smaller.</p>
<p>I got to maybe a half a truck and then to a suitcase.</p>
<p>And then I went, okay, well, screw it.</p>
<p>I wanna carry my entire technology in my pocket.</p>
<p>How do I do it?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna launch into Steve Jobs and iPlayer.</p>
<p>I came up with a matchbox survival kit.</p>
<p>In that matchbox survival kit,</p>
<p>I would have the minimum stuff</p>
<p>that would allow me to interact the environment,</p>
<p>to build my shelter, to build a fishing rod,</p>
<p>to build a water purification system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like, so what did I use in my box</p>
<p>to assemble in the environment,</p>
<p>to assemble, to assemble, to assemble?</p>
<p>And I realized I could make a causal chain</p>
<p>in my survival kit.</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s probably why I&rsquo;ve been obsessed</p>
<p>with assembly theory for so long.</p>
<p>And I was just pre configured to find it somewhere.</p>
<p>And when I saw it in molecules,</p>
<p>I realized that the causal structure that we say emerges</p>
<p>and the physics kind of gets really stuck</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re saying that time,</p>
<p>you can go backwards in time.</p>
<p>I mean, how do we let physicists get away</p>
<p>with the notion that we can go back in time</p>
<p>and meet ourselves?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s clearly a very hard thing</p>
<p>to allow, physicists would not let other sciences</p>
<p>get away with that kind of heresy, right?</p>
<p>So why are physicists allowed to get away with it?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So first of all, to push back, to play devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>you are clearly married to the idea of memory.</p>
<p>You see in this, again, from Rick and Morty way,</p>
<p>you see, you have these deep dreams of the universe</p>
<p>that is writing the story through its memories,</p>
<p>through its chemical compounds</p>
<p>that are just building at top of each other.</p>
<p>And then they find useful components they can reuse.</p>
<p>And then the reused components create systems</p>
<p>that themselves are then reused</p>
<p>and all in this way, construct things.</p>
<p>But when you think of that as memory,</p>
<p>it seems like quite sad that you can walk that back.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it feels like that memory,</p>
<p>you can walk in both directions on that memory</p>
<p>in terms of time.</p>
<p>You could walk in both directions,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that that makes any sense</p>
<p>because the problem that I have with time being reversible</p>
<p>is that, I mean, I&rsquo;m just a, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a dumb experimental chemist, right?</p>
<p>So I love burning stuff, burning stuff and building stuff.</p>
<p>But when I think of reversible phenomena,</p>
<p>I imagine in my head,</p>
<p>I have to actually manufacture some time.</p>
<p>I have to borrow time from the universe to do that.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, when anyone says,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s imagine that we can go back in time or reversibility,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t step out of time.</p>
<p>Time is nonnegotiable, it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>No, but see, you&rsquo;re assuming that time is fundamental,</p>
<p>which most of us do when we go day to day,</p>
<p>but it takes a leap of wild imagination</p>
<p>to think that time is emergent.</p>
<p>No, time is not emergent.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is an argument we can have,</p>
<p>but I believe I can come up with an experiment.</p>
<p>An experiment that proves</p>
<p>that time cannot possibly be emergent.</p>
<p>An experiment that shows how assembly theory</p>
<p>kind of is the way that the universe produces selection</p>
<p>and that selection gives rise to life.</p>
<p>And also to say, well, hang on,</p>
<p>we could allow ourselves to have a theory</p>
<p>that requires us to have these statements to be possible.</p>
<p>Like we need to have order in the past,</p>
<p>or we can use the past hypothesis,</p>
<p>which is order in the past, but as well, okay.</p>
<p>And we have to have an arrow of time.</p>
<p>We have to require that entropy increases.</p>
<p>And we have to say, and then we can say, look,</p>
<p>the universe is completely closed and there&rsquo;s no novelty</p>
<p>or that novelty is predetermined.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is very, very important</p>
<p>that time is fundamental, which means,</p>
<p>if you think about it,</p>
<p>the universe becomes more and more novel each step.</p>
<p>It generates there&rsquo;s more states</p>
<p>in the next step than it was before.</p>
<p>So that means bigger search.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is that the universe</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t capable of consciousness at day one,</p>
<p>actually, because it didn&rsquo;t have enough states.</p>
<p>But today the universe is, so it&rsquo;s like how?</p>
<p>All right, all right, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve pissed off the panpsychist too, okay.</p>
<p>No, this is brilliant, sorry.</p>
<p>Part of me is just joking, having fun with this thing,</p>
<p>but because you&rsquo;re saying a lot of brilliant stuff</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to slow it down before my brain explodes.</p>
<p>So, because I want to break apart</p>
<p>some of the fascinating things you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>So novelty, novelty is increasing in the universe</p>
<p>because the number of states is increasing.</p>
<p>What do you mean by states?</p>
<p>So I think the physicists almost got everything right.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t fault them at all.</p>
<p>I just think there&rsquo;s a little bit of dogma.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to play devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy to be entirely wrong on this, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not right on many things at all,</p>
<p>but if I can make less assumptions</p>
<p>about the universe with this,</p>
<p>then potentially that&rsquo;s a more powerful way</p>
<p>of looking at things.</p>
<p>If you think of time as fundamental,</p>
<p>you can make less assumptions overall.</p>
<p>Exactly, if time is fundamental,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to add on a magical second law</p>
<p>because the second law comes out of the fact</p>
<p>the universe is actually, there&rsquo;s more states available.</p>
<p>I mean, we might even be able to do weird things</p>
<p>like dark energy in the universe</p>
<p>might actually just be time, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but then you have to still have to explain</p>
<p>why time is fundamental,</p>
<p>because I can give you one explanation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s simpler than time and say God.</p>
<p>You know, like just because it&rsquo;s simple</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s, okay, you still have to explain God</p>
<p>and you still have to explain time.</p>
<p>Like why is it fundamental?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just say existence is default,</p>
<p>which means time is the default.</p>
<p>So how did you go from the existence</p>
<p>of the time to the default? Well, we exist, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just be very.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re yet to talk about what exist means.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s go all the way back.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very poetic and beautiful</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re weaving into this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this conversation is even about the assembly,</p>
<p>which is fascinating and we&rsquo;ll keep mentioning it</p>
<p>in the index on this idea,</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think is necessarily connected to time.</p>
<p>Oh, I think it is deeply connected.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t explain it yet.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think everything you&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>about assembly theory and assembly index</p>
<p>can still be correct even if time is emergent?</p>
<p>So yeah, right now, assembly theory appears to work.</p>
<p>I appear to be able to measure objects of high assembly</p>
<p>in a mass spectrometer and look at their abundance</p>
<p>and you know, all that&rsquo;s fine, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice, if nothing else, it&rsquo;s a nice way</p>
<p>of looking at how molecules can compress things.</p>
<p>Now, am I saying that a time has to be fundamental,</p>
<p>not emergent for assembly theory to work?</p>
<p>No, I think I&rsquo;m saying that the universe,</p>
<p>it appears that the universe has many different ways</p>
<p>of using time.</p>
<p>You could have three different types of time.</p>
<p>You could just have time that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the way I would think of it,</p>
<p>if you want to hold onto emergent time,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s fine, let&rsquo;s do that for a second.</p>
<p>Hold onto emergent time</p>
<p>and the universe is just doing its thing.</p>
<p>Then assembly time only exists when the universe</p>
<p>starts to write memories through bonds.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just say there&rsquo;s rocks running around,</p>
<p>you know, when the bond happens and selection starts,</p>
<p>suddenly there are, the universe is remembering cause</p>
<p>in the past and those structures will have effects</p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>So suddenly a new type of time emerges at that point,</p>
<p>which has a direction.</p>
<p>And I think Sean Carroll at this point</p>
<p>might even turn the podcast back on and go,</p>
<p>okay, I can deal with that, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just basically trying to condense the conversation,</p>
<p>say, hey, let&rsquo;s just have time fundamental</p>
<p>and see how that screws with people&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re triggering people by saying fundamental.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Well, you just say, like, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Why am I, look, I&rsquo;m walking through the wall.</p>
<p>Why should I grow up in a world where time,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go back in time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t meet myself in the past.</p>
<p>There are no one, there are no aliens coming</p>
<p>from the future, right?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just like.</p>
<p>No, no, no, but that&rsquo;s not, no, no, no, hold on a second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like saying we&rsquo;re talking about biology</p>
<p>or like evolutionary psychology</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re saying, okay, let&rsquo;s just assume</p>
<p>that clothing is fundamental.</p>
<p>People wearing clothes is fundamental.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, no, no, wait a minute.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, like, I think you&rsquo;re gonna get in a lot of trouble</p>
<p>if you assume time is fundamental.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Give me one reason why I&rsquo;m getting into trouble</p>
<p>with time being fundamental.</p>
<p>Because you might not understand</p>
<p>the origins of this memory that might be deeper.</p>
<p>Like this memory, that could be a thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s explaining the construction of these</p>
<p>higher complexities better than just saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a search, it&rsquo;s chemicals doing a search</p>
<p>for reusable structures that they can like</p>
<p>then use as bricks to build a house.</p>
<p>Okay, so I accept that.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go back a second because it&rsquo;s a kind of,</p>
<p>I wanted to drop the time bomb at this part</p>
<p>because I think we can carry on discussing it</p>
<p>for many, many, many, many, many days, many months.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m happy to accept that it might be wrong.</p>
<p>But what I would like to do is imagine a universe</p>
<p>where time is fundamental and time is emergent</p>
<p>and ask, let&rsquo;s just then talk about causation</p>
<p>because physicists require that causation.</p>
<p>So this is where I&rsquo;m gonna go.</p>
<p>Causation emerges and it doesn&rsquo;t exist at the micro scale.</p>
<p>Well, that clearly is wrong</p>
<p>because if causation has to emerge at the macro scale,</p>
<p>life cannot emerge.</p>
<p>So how does life emerge?</p>
<p>Life requires molecules to bump into each other,</p>
<p>produce replicators, those replicators</p>
<p>need to produce polymers.</p>
<p>There needs to be cause and effect at the molecular level.</p>
<p>There needs to be an agardic, non agardic</p>
<p>to an agardic transition at some point.</p>
<p>And those replicators have consequence,</p>
<p>material consequence in the universe.</p>
<p>Physicists just say, oh, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have a bunch of particles in a box.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna think about it in a Newtonian way</p>
<p>and a quantum way and I&rsquo;ll add on an arrow of time</p>
<p>so I can label things</p>
<p>and causation will happen magically later.</p>
<p>Well, how?</p>
<p>Explain causation and they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The only way I can reconcile causation</p>
<p>is having a fundamental time</p>
<p>because this allows me to have a deterministic universe</p>
<p>that creates novelty.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many things to unpack here</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s go back to the point.</p>
<p>You said, can assembly theory work with emergent time?</p>
<p>Sure it can, but it doesn&rsquo;t give me a deep satisfaction</p>
<p>about how causation and assembly gives rise</p>
<p>to these objects that move through time and space.</p>
<p>And again, what am I saying to bring it back?</p>
<p>I can say without fear, take this water bottle</p>
<p>and look at this water bottle</p>
<p>and look at the features on it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s writing, you&rsquo;ve got a load of them.</p>
<p>I know that causal structures gave rise to this.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m not looking at just one water bottle here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at every water bottle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ever been conceived of by humanity.</p>
<p>This here is a special object.</p>
<p>In fact, Leibniz knew this.</p>
<p>Leibniz who was at the same time of Newton,</p>
<p>he kind of got stuck.</p>
<p>I think Leibniz actually invented assembly theory.</p>
<p>He gave soul, the soul that you see in objects</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t the mystical soul, it is assembly.</p>
<p>It is the fact there&rsquo;s been a history of objects related</p>
<p>and without the object in the past,</p>
<p>this object wouldn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>There is a lineage and there is conserved structures,</p>
<p>causal structures have given rise to those.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s just a simpler view</p>
<p>if time is fundamental.</p>
<p>And it shakes the physicist&rsquo;s cage a bit, right?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m gonna say, but I think that.</p>
<p>I just enjoy the fact that physicists are in cages.</p>
<p>I think that, I mean, I would say that, you know,</p>
<p>Lee Smolin, I don&rsquo;t want to speak for Lee.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m talking to Lee about this.</p>
<p>I think Lee also is an agreement</p>
<p>that time has to be fundamental,</p>
<p>but I think he goes further.</p>
<p>You know, even in space,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can go back to the same place in space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Austin a few times now.</p>
<p>This is my, I think third time I&rsquo;ve been to Austin.</p>
<p>Is Austin in the same place?</p>
<p>No, the solar system is moving through space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not back in the same space.</p>
<p>Locally I am.</p>
<p>Every event in the universe is unique.</p>
<p>In space.</p>
<p>And time.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t go back though.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, let&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>rest this conversation, which was beautiful,</p>
<p>with a quote from the Rolling Stones</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t always get what you want,</p>
<p>which is you want time to be fundamental,</p>
<p>but if you try, you&rsquo;ll get what you need,</p>
<p>which is assembly theory.</p>
<p>Okay, let me ask you about,</p>
<p>continue talking about complexity,</p>
<p>and to clarify with this beautiful theory of yours</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re developing,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll continue developing</p>
<p>both in the lab and in theory.</p>
<p>Yeah, it can&rsquo;t be said enough,</p>
<p>just the ideas you&rsquo;re playing with in your head are just,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been talking about are just beautiful.</p>
<p>So if we talk about complexity a little bit more generally,</p>
<p>maybe in an admiring romantic way,</p>
<p>how does complexity emerge from simple rules?</p>
<p>The why, the how.</p>
<p>Okay, the nice algorithm of assembly is there.</p>
<p>I would say that the problem I have right now is,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re right, we can, about time as well.</p>
<p>The problem is I have this hammer called assembly,</p>
<p>and everything I see is a nail.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s just apply it to all sorts of things.</p>
<p>We take the Bernard instability.</p>
<p>The Bernard instability is you have oil,</p>
<p>if you heat up oil, let&rsquo;s say on a frying pan,</p>
<p>when you get convection, you get honeycomb patterns.</p>
<p>Take the formation of snowflakes, right?</p>
<p>Take the emergence of a tropical storm,</p>
<p>or the storm on Jupiter.</p>
<p>When people say, let&rsquo;s talk about complexity in general,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take this collection of objects</p>
<p>that are correlated in some way,</p>
<p>and try and work out how many moving parts there are,</p>
<p>how this got, how this exists.</p>
<p>So what people have been doing for a very long time</p>
<p>is taking complexity and counting what they&rsquo;ve lost,</p>
<p>calculating the entropy.</p>
<p>And the reason why I&rsquo;m pushing very hard on assembly</p>
<p>is entropy tells you how much you&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t tell you the microstates are gone.</p>
<p>But if you embrace the bottom up with assembly,</p>
<p>those states, and you then understand the causal chain</p>
<p>that gives rise to the emergence.</p>
<p>So what I think assembly will help us do</p>
<p>is understand weak emergence at the very least,</p>
<p>and maybe allow us to crack open complexity in a new way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been fascinated with complexity theory</p>
<p>for many years.</p>
<p>I mean, as soon as I could,</p>
<p>I learned of the Mandelbrot set,</p>
<p>and I could just type it up in my computer and run it,</p>
<p>and just show it and see it kind of unfold.</p>
<p>It was just this kind of,</p>
<p>this mathematical reality that existed in front of me,</p>
<p>I just found incredible.</p>
<p>But then I realized that actually we were cheating.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re putting in the boundary conditions all the time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re putting in information.</p>
<p>And so when people talk to me</p>
<p>about the complexity of things,</p>
<p>I say, but relative what, how do you measure them?</p>
<p>So my attempt, my small attempt, naive attempt,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s many greater minds than mine</p>
<p>on the planet right now thinking about this properly.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve had some of them on the podcast, right?</p>
<p>Just absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m wondering if we might be able to reformat</p>
<p>the way we would explore algorithmic complexity</p>
<p>using assembly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the minimum number of constraints we need</p>
<p>in our system for this to unfold?</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s like, if you take some particles</p>
<p>and put them in a box,</p>
<p>at a certain box size, you get quasi crystallinity</p>
<p>coming out, right?</p>
<p>But that quite, that emergence, it&rsquo;s not magic.</p>
<p>It must come from the boundary conditions you put in.</p>
<p>So all I&rsquo;m saying is a lot of the complexity that we see</p>
<p>is a direct read of the constraints we put in,</p>
<p>but we just don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>So as I said earlier to the poor origin of life chemists,</p>
<p>you know, origin of life is a scam.</p>
<p>I would say lots of the complexity calculation theory</p>
<p>is a bit of a scam</p>
<p>because we put the constraints in,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t count them correctly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m wondering if&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re thinking and starting to drop</p>
<p>as assembly theory, assembly index</p>
<p>is a way to count to the constraints.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all it is.</p>
<p>So assembly theory doesn&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t lower any of the importance of complexity theory,</p>
<p>but it allows us to go across domains</p>
<p>and start to compare things,</p>
<p>compare the complexity of a molecule,</p>
<p>of a microprocessor, of the text you&rsquo;ve writing,</p>
<p>of the music you may compose.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve tweeted, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Assembly theory explains why Nietzsche understood</p>
<p>we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve applied assembly theory</p>
<p>to cellular automata in life and chemistry.</p>
<p>What does Nietzsche have to do with assembly theory?</p>
<p>Oh, that gets me into free will and everything.</p>
<p>So let me say that again.</p>
<p>Assembly theory explains why Nietzsche understood</p>
<p>we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom.</p>
<p>Limited freedom, I suppose, is referring to the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s constraints or what is radical freedom?</p>
<p>What is freedom?</p>
<p>So Sartre was like believed in absolute freedom</p>
<p>and that he could do whatever he wanted in his imagination.</p>
<p>And Nietzsche understood that his freedom</p>
<p>was somewhat more limited.</p>
<p>And it kind of takes me back to this computer game</p>
<p>that I played when I was 10.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s called Dragon&rsquo;s Lair.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you know Dragon&rsquo;s Lair?</p>
<p>I think I know Dragon&rsquo;s Lair, yeah.</p>
<p>Dragon&rsquo;s Lair, I knew I was being conned, right?</p>
<p>Dragon&rsquo;s Lair, when you play the game,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re lucky that you grew up</p>
<p>in a basically procedurally generated world.</p>
<p>That was RPG a little bit.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s like, is it turn based play?</p>
<p>Was it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It was a role playing game.</p>
<p>Role playing.</p>
<p>But really good graphics and one of the first laser disks.</p>
<p>And when you actually flick the stick,</p>
<p>you took, it&rsquo;s like it was like a graphical adventure game</p>
<p>with animation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And when I played this game, I really, you know,</p>
<p>you could get through the game in 12 minutes</p>
<p>if you knew what you were doing without making mistakes,</p>
<p>just play the disk, play the disk, play a disk.</p>
<p>So it was just about timing.</p>
<p>And actually it was a complete fraud</p>
<p>because all the animation has been prerecorded on the disk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Black Mirror, the first interactive</p>
<p>where they had all the, you know,</p>
<p>several million kind of permutations of the movie</p>
<p>that you could select on Netflix.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve forgotten the name of it.</p>
<p>So this was exactly that in the laser disk.</p>
<p>So you basically go left, go right, fight the yoga,</p>
<p>slay the dragon.</p>
<p>And when you flick the joystick at the right time,</p>
<p>it just goes to the next animation to play.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really generating it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I played that game and I knew I was being had.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>I see, I see.</p>
<p>So to you, Dragon Lair is the first time you realized</p>
<p>that free will is an illusion.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And why does assembly theory give you hints</p>
<p>about free will, whether it&rsquo;s an illusion or not?</p>
<p>Yeah, so no, so not tightly.</p>
<p>If I do think I have some will and I think I am an agent</p>
<p>and I think I can interact and I can play around</p>
<p>with the model I have of the world</p>
<p>and the cost functions, right?</p>
<p>And I can hack my own cost functions,</p>
<p>which means I have a little bit of free will.</p>
<p>But as much as I want to do stuff in the universe,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I could suddenly say,</p>
<p>I mean, actually this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Cause now I say I could try and do it, right?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m suddenly give up everything</p>
<p>and become a rapper tomorrow, right?</p>
<p>Maybe I could try that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have sufficient agency</p>
<p>to make that necessarily happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a trajectory.</p>
<p>So when in Dragon&rsquo;s Lair,</p>
<p>I know that I have some trajectories that I can play with</p>
<p>where Sartre realized he thought</p>
<p>that he had no assembly, no memory.</p>
<p>He could just leap across and do everything.</p>
<p>And Nietzsche said, okay, I realize I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>full freedom, but I have some freedom.</p>
<p>And the assembly theory basically says that,</p>
<p>it says, if you have these constraints in your past,</p>
<p>they limit what you were able to do in the future,</p>
<p>but you can use them to do amazing things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m a poppy plant and I&rsquo;m creating some opiates.</p>
<p>Opiates are really interesting molecules.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re obviously great for medicine,</p>
<p>cause great problems in society.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s imagine we fast forward a billion years,</p>
<p>what will the opioids look like in a billion years?</p>
<p>Well, we can guess because we can see</p>
<p>how those proteins will evolve</p>
<p>and we can see how the secondary metabolites will change.</p>
<p>But they can&rsquo;t go radical.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t suddenly become, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like a molecule that you find in an OLED in a display.</p>
<p>They will have some,</p>
<p>they will be limited by the causal chain that produced them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m getting at,</p>
<p>saying we are unpredictably predictable</p>
<p>or predictably unpredictable within a constraint</p>
<p>on the trajectory we&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the predictably part</p>
<p>is the constraints of the trajectory</p>
<p>and the unpredictable part is the part</p>
<p>that you still haven&rsquo;t really clarified</p>
<p>the origin of the little bit of freedom.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just arguing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically saying that radical freedom is impossible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really operating in a world of constraints</p>
<p>that are constrained by the memory of the trajectory</p>
<p>of the chemistry that led to who you are.</p>
<p>Okay, but even just a tiny bit of freedom,</p>
<p>even if everything, if everywhere you are in cages,</p>
<p>if you can move around in that cage a little bit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re free.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And so the question is in assembly theory,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re thinking about free will,</p>
<p>where does the little bit of freedom come from?</p>
<p>What is the eye that can decide to be a rapper?</p>
<p>What, why, what is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cute little trick we&rsquo;ve convinced each other of</p>
<p>so we can do fun tricks at parties</p>
<p>or is there something fundamental</p>
<p>that allows us to feel free, to be free?</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s the question that I wanna answer.</p>
<p>I know you wanna answer it and I think it&rsquo;s so profound.</p>
<p>Let me have a go at it.</p>
<p>I would say that I don&rsquo;t take the stance of Sam Harris</p>
<p>because I think Sam Harris, when he said,</p>
<p>the way he says it is almost,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk to him about it.</p>
<p>Sam Harris almost thinks himself out of existence, right?</p>
<p>Because, do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, he has different views</p>
<p>on consciousness versus free will.</p>
<p>I think he saves himself with consciousness.</p>
<p>He thinks himself out of existence with free will.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So I mean, there&rsquo;s no point, right?</p>
<p>So I&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a leaf floating on a river.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that he, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to ask him whether he really believes that</p>
<p>and then we could play some games.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>No, no, I then would say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get him to play a game of cards with me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll work out the conditions on which he says no,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll get him to the conditions he says yes,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll trap him in his logical inconsistency</p>
<p>with that argument.</p>
<p>Because at some point when he loses enough money</p>
<p>or the prospect of losing enough money,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way of basically mapping out a series of&hellip;</p>
<p>So what will is about, let&rsquo;s not call it free will,</p>
<p>but what will is about is to have a series of decisions</p>
<p>equally weighted in front of you.</p>
<p>And those decisions aren&rsquo;t necessarily energy minimization.</p>
<p>Those decisions are a function of the model</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve made in your mind, you&rsquo;re in your simulation.</p>
<p>And the way you&rsquo;ve interacted in reality</p>
<p>and also other interactions you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>with other individuals and happenstance.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s a little bit of delay in time.</p>
<p>So I think what you&rsquo;re able to do is say,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m gonna do the counterfactual.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done all of them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna go this way.</p>
<p>And you probably don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I think free will is actually very complex interaction</p>
<p>between your unconscious and your conscious brain.</p>
<p>And I think the reason why we&rsquo;re arguing about it</p>
<p>is so interesting in that we just,</p>
<p>some people outsource their free will</p>
<p>to their unconscious brain.</p>
<p>And some people try and overthink</p>
<p>the free will and the conscious brain.</p>
<p>I would say that Sam Harris has realized</p>
<p>his conscious brain doesn&rsquo;t have free will,</p>
<p>but his unconscious brain does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my guess, right?</p>
<p>And that he can&rsquo;t have access to the unconscious brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s kind of annoying.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;s going to, through meditation,</p>
<p>come to acceptance with that fact.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just maybe okay.</p>
<p>But I do think that I have the ability to make decisions</p>
<p>and I like my decisions.</p>
<p>In fact, I mean, this is an argument I have</p>
<p>with some people that some days I feel</p>
<p>I have no free will and it&rsquo;s just an illusion.</p>
<p>And this is one, and it makes me more radical,</p>
<p>if you like, you know, that I get to explore</p>
<p>more of the state space.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m going to try and affect the world now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really going to ask the question</p>
<p>that maybe I dare not ask or do the thing I dare not do.</p>
<p>And that allows me to kind of explore more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that if you truly accept</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no free will, that is a kind of radical freedom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, but you&rsquo;re, because the little bit</p>
<p>of the illusion under that framework that you have</p>
<p>that you can make choices, if choice is just an illusion</p>
<p>of psychology, you can do whatever the hell you want.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t, do we?</p>
<p>And I think.</p>
<p>But because you don&rsquo;t truly accept</p>
<p>that you think that there&rsquo;s like, you think there&rsquo;s a choice</p>
<p>which is why you don&rsquo;t just do whatever the hell you want.</p>
<p>Like you feel like there&rsquo;s some responsibility</p>
<p>for making the wrong choice, which is why you don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>But if you truly accept that the choice</p>
<p>has already been made, then you can go,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is the most radical thing.</p>
<p>I mean, but yeah, I don&rsquo;t, I wonder what,</p>
<p>what am I preventing myself from doing</p>
<p>that I would really want to do?</p>
<p>Probably like humor stuff.</p>
<p>Like I would love to, if I could like save a game,</p>
<p>do the thing and then reload it later,</p>
<p>like do undo, it probably would be humor.</p>
<p>Just to do something like super hilarious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s super embarrassing.</p>
<p>And then just go, I mean, it&rsquo;s basically just fun.</p>
<p>I would add more fun to the world.</p>
<p>I mean, I sometimes do that as I&rsquo;ve, you know,</p>
<p>I sometimes I try and mess up my reality in unusual ways</p>
<p>by just doing things because I&rsquo;m bored, but not bored.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not expressing this very well.</p>
<p>I think that this is a really interesting problem</p>
<p>that perhaps the hard sciences don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>that they are responsible for</p>
<p>because the question about how life emerged</p>
<p>and how intelligence emerges and consciousness and free will</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all ultimately boiling down</p>
<p>to some of the same mechanics.</p>
<p>I think, my feeling is that they are the same problem</p>
<p>again and again and again.</p>
<p>The transition from a, you know, a boring world</p>
<p>or a world in which there is no selection.</p>
<p>So I wonder if free will has something to do</p>
<p>with selection and models.</p>
<p>And also the models you&rsquo;re generating in the brain</p>
<p>and also your, the amount of memory,</p>
<p>your working memory have available at any one time</p>
<p>to generate counterfactuals.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So like the decision making process is a kind of selection</p>
<p>and that could be just another,</p>
<p>yet another manifestation of the selection mechanism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pervasive throughout the universe.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s not some kind of fundamental,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s own thing or something like that.</p>
<p>That is just yet another example of selection.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in the universe that&rsquo;s intrinsically open,</p>
<p>you want to do that because you generate novelty.</p>
<p>You mentioned something about,</p>
<p>do cellular automata exist outside the human mind</p>
<p>in our little offline conversation?</p>
<p>Why is that an interesting question?</p>
<p>So cellular automata, complexity,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the relationship between complexity</p>
<p>and the human mind and trees falling in the forest?</p>
<p>Infrastructure, so the CA,</p>
<p>so when John von Neumann and Conway and Feynman</p>
<p>were doing CA, it was doing on paper.</p>
<p>CA is cellular automata.</p>
<p>Just drawing them on paper.</p>
<p>How awesome is that, that they were doing cellular automata</p>
<p>on paper and then they were doing it on a computer</p>
<p>that takes like forever to print out anything and program.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>People are now with the TikTok,</p>
<p>kids these days with the TikTok don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>how amazing it is to just play with cellular automata,</p>
<p>arbitrarily changing the rules as you want,</p>
<p>the initial conditions,</p>
<p>and see the beautiful patterns emerge,</p>
<p>sing with fractals, all of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve just given me a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a TikTok account that&rsquo;s just dedicated</p>
<p>to putting out CA rules and if there isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we should make one.</p>
<p>100% and that will get.</p>
<p>So we have millions of views.</p>
<p>Millions, yes.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;ll get dozens.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just have it running.</p>
<p>So look, I kind of, I love CAs.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>We just have to make one.</p>
<p>I actually, a few years ago,</p>
<p>I made some robots that talk to each other,</p>
<p>chemical robots that played the game of Hex,</p>
<p>invented by John Nash, by doing chemistry.</p>
<p>And they communicated via Twitter,</p>
<p>which were experiments they were doing.</p>
<p>And they had a lookup table of experiments</p>
<p>and robot one said, I&rsquo;m doing experiment 10.</p>
<p>And the other robot, okay, I&rsquo;ll do experiment one then.</p>
<p>And they communicated via Twitter.</p>
<p>Publicly or DMs?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Can you maybe quickly explain what the game of Hex is?</p>
<p>Yes, so it&rsquo;s basically a hexagonal board</p>
<p>and you try and basically you color each element</p>
<p>on the board of each hexagon</p>
<p>and you try and get from one side to the other</p>
<p>and the other one tries to block you.</p>
<p>How are they connected?</p>
<p>So what are the robots?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a chemical.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s go back.</p>
<p>So there are two robots.</p>
<p>Each robot was doing dye chemistry.</p>
<p>So making RGB, red, green, blue, red, green, blue,</p>
<p>red, green, blue.</p>
<p>And they could just choose from experiments</p>
<p>to do red, green, blue.</p>
<p>Initially I said to my group,</p>
<p>we need to make two chemical robots that play chess.</p>
<p>And my group were like, that&rsquo;s too hard.</p>
<p>No, go away.</p>
<p>But anyway, so we had the robot.</p>
<p>By the way, people listening to this should probably know</p>
<p>that Lee Cronin is an amazing group of brilliant people.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s exceptionally well published.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s written a huge number of amazing papers.</p>
<p>Whenever he calls himself stupid</p>
<p>and is a sign of humility,</p>
<p>and I deeply respect that and appreciate it.</p>
<p>So people listening to this should know</p>
<p>this is a world class scientist</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t take himself seriously,</p>
<p>which I really appreciate and love.</p>
<p>Anywho, talking about serious science,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re back to your group rejecting your idea</p>
<p>of chemical robots playing chess via dyes.</p>
<p>So you went to a simpler game of Hex.</p>
<p>Okay, so what else?</p>
<p>The team that did it were brilliant.</p>
<p>I think they still have PTSD from doing it.</p>
<p>Cause I said, this is a workshop.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d often do is I have about 60 people on my team.</p>
<p>And occasionally before lockdown,</p>
<p>I would say, I&rsquo;m a bit bored.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have a workshop on something.</p>
<p>Who wants to come?</p>
<p>And then basically about 20 people turn up to my office</p>
<p>and I say, we&rsquo;re gonna do this mad thing.</p>
<p>And then it would just self organize.</p>
<p>And some of them would be like, no, I&rsquo;m not doing this.</p>
<p>And then you get left with the happy dozen.</p>
<p>And what we did is we built this robot</p>
<p>and doing dye chemistry is really easy.</p>
<p>You can just take two molecules,</p>
<p>react them together and change color.</p>
<p>And what I wanted to do is have a palette</p>
<p>of different molecules.</p>
<p>You can react combinatorially and get different colors.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got two robots.</p>
<p>And I went, wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool</p>
<p>if the robots basically shared</p>
<p>the same list of reactions to do.</p>
<p>And they said, oh, and because of,</p>
<p>then you could do a kind of multi core chemistry.</p>
<p>Like they weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;d have two chemical reactions going on at once</p>
<p>and they could basically outsource the problem.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re sharing the same tape.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So robot one would say, I&rsquo;m gonna do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do experiment one.</p>
<p>And the other robot says, I&rsquo;ll do experiment 100.</p>
<p>And then they could cross it off.</p>
<p>But I wanted to make it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant, by the way.</p>
<p>I wanted to make.</p>
<p>That is genius.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Well, I wanted to make it groovier.</p>
<p>And I said, look, let&rsquo;s have them competing to make,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re playing a game of hex.</p>
<p>And so when the robot does an experiment</p>
<p>and the more blue the dye,</p>
<p>the more it gets the higher chance it gets</p>
<p>to make the move it wants on the hex board.</p>
<p>So if it gets a red color is like,</p>
<p>it gets down weighted in the other robot.</p>
<p>And so what the robots could do is they play,</p>
<p>each player move.</p>
<p>And cause the fitness function or the optimization function</p>
<p>was to make the color blue,</p>
<p>they started to invent reactions</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t, weren&rsquo;t on the list.</p>
<p>And they did this by not cleaning</p>
<p>because we made cleaning optional.</p>
<p>So when one robot realized if it didn&rsquo;t clean its pipes,</p>
<p>it could get blue more quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the other robot realized that.</p>
<p>So it was like getting dirty as well.</p>
<p>And they, they.</p>
<p>Unintended consequences of super intelligence.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>That was the game.</p>
<p>And we.</p>
<p>Communicating through Twitter though.</p>
<p>They were, they were doing it through Twitter</p>
<p>and Twitter bland them a couple of times.</p>
<p>I said, come on, you&rsquo;ve got a couple of robots</p>
<p>doing chemistry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>Stop banning them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But in the end they had, we had to take them off Twitter</p>
<p>and they just communicated via a server.</p>
<p>Cause it was just, there were people saying,</p>
<p>you can still find it.</p>
<p>Cronin lab one and Cronin lab two on Twitter.</p>
<p>And it was like, make move, wait, you know, mix A and B,</p>
<p>wait 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Answer blue, you know.</p>
<p>I really find it super compelling</p>
<p>that you would have a chemical entity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s communicating with the world.</p>
<p>That was one of the things I want to do</p>
<p>with my origin of life reaction, right?</p>
<p>Is basically have a, have a reactor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically just randomly enumerating</p>
<p>for chemical space and have some kind of cycle</p>
<p>and then read out what the molecules reading out</p>
<p>using a mass spectrometer and then convert that to text</p>
<p>and publish it on Twitter and then wait until it says</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m alive.</p>
<p>I reckon that would get, I reckon that,</p>
<p>that Twitter account would get a lot of followers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still trying to convince my group</p>
<p>that we should just make an origin of life Twitter account.</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s going blue and it&rsquo;s like, hello, testing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll share it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I particularly enjoy this idea</p>
<p>of a non human entity communicating with the world</p>
<p>via human designed social network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite a, quite a beautiful idea.</p>
<p>How we were talking about CA&rsquo;s existing</p>
<p>outside the human mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I really admire Stephen Wolfram.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a genius, clearly a genius</p>
<p>and trapped in is actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a problem with being so smart</p>
<p>is you get trapped in your own mind, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve, I tried to actually,</p>
<p>I tried to convince Stephen that assembly theory</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t nonsense.</p>
<p>He was like, no, it&rsquo;s just nonsense.</p>
<p>I was a little bit sad by that.</p>
<p>So nonsense applied,</p>
<p>even if it applied to the simplest construct</p>
<p>of a one dimensional cellular automata, for example.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, actually,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m doing myself a bit too down.</p>
<p>It was just as a theory was coming through</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t really know how to explain it,</p>
<p>but we are going to use assembly theory</p>
<p>and CA&rsquo;s in cellular automata,</p>
<p>but I wanted to,</p>
<p>what I was really curious about is why people marvel.</p>
<p>I mean, you marvel CA&rsquo;s and their complexity.</p>
<p>And I said, well, hang on that complexity is baked in</p>
<p>because if you play the game of life in a CA,</p>
<p>you have to run it on a computer.</p>
<p>You have to have a,</p>
<p>you have to do a number of operations,</p>
<p>put in the boundary conditions.</p>
<p>So is it surprising that you get this structure out?</p>
<p>Is it manufactured by the boundary conditions?</p>
<p>And it is interesting because I think</p>
<p>a cellular automata running them</p>
<p>is teaching me something about</p>
<p>what real numbers are and aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t quite got there yet.</p>
<p>I was playing on the airplane coming over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just realized,</p>
<p>I have no idea what real numbers are really.</p>
<p>And I was like, well,</p>
<p>I do actually have some notion of what real numbers are.</p>
<p>And I think thinking about real numbers as functions</p>
<p>rather than numbers is more appropriate.</p>
<p>And then if you then apply that to CA&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re saying, well, actually,</p>
<p>why am I seeing this complexity in this rule?</p>
<p>Is it, you know, is it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got this deterministic system</p>
<p>and yet you get this incredible structure coming out.</p>
<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t that what you&rsquo;d get with any real number</p>
<p>as you apply it as a function</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to read it out to an arbitrary position?</p>
<p>And I wonder if CA&rsquo;s are just helping me,</p>
<p>well, my misunderstanding of CA&rsquo;s</p>
<p>might be helping me understand them</p>
<p>in terms of real numbers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you think.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the functions,</p>
<p>but the devil&rsquo;s in the function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, which is the function</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s generating your real number.</p>
<p>Like that, it seems like it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>the specific algorithm of that function</p>
<p>because some lead to something super trivial,</p>
<p>some lead to something that&rsquo;s all chaotic</p>
<p>and some lead to things that are just walked</p>
<p>that fine line of complexity and structure.</p>
<p>I think we agree.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take it back a second.</p>
<p>So take the logistic map or something, logistic equation,</p>
<p>where you have this equation,</p>
<p>which is you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s gonna happen at n plus one,</p>
<p>but once you&rsquo;ve done n plus one, you know full time,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t predict it.</p>
<p>For me, CA&rsquo;s and logistic equation feel similar.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s incredibly interesting</p>
<p>and I share your kind of wonder at running a CA,</p>
<p>but also I&rsquo;m saying, well,</p>
<p>what is it about the boundary conditions</p>
<p>and the way I&rsquo;m running that calculation?</p>
<p>So in my group, with my team,</p>
<p>we actually made a chemical CA.</p>
<p>We made Game of Life.</p>
<p>We actually made a physical grid.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to publish this paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been trapped in purgatory for a long time,</p>
<p>but it might be about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You wrote it up as a paper,</p>
<p>how to do a chemical formulation of the Game of Life,</p>
<p>which is played.</p>
<p>We made a chemical computer and little cells.</p>
<p>And I was playing Game of Life.</p>
<p>With the BZ reactions,</p>
<p>each cell would pulse on and off, on and off, on and off.</p>
<p>We have little stirrer bars and we have little gates.</p>
<p>And we actually played Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life in there.</p>
<p>And we got structures in that.</p>
<p>We got structures in that game from the chemistry</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t expect from the actual CA.</p>
<p>So that was kind of cool in that.</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re interacting outside of the cells more.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening is you&rsquo;re getting noise.</p>
<p>So the thing is that you&rsquo;ve got this BZ reaction</p>
<p>that gives on off, on off, on off,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a wake</p>
<p>and those wakes constructively interfere</p>
<p>or in such a non trivial way that&rsquo;s non deterministic.</p>
<p>And the non determinism in the system</p>
<p>gives very rich dynamics.</p>
<p>And I was wondering if I could physically</p>
<p>make a chemical computer with this CA</p>
<p>that gives me something different.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get in a silicon representation of a CA</p>
<p>where all the states are clean.</p>
<p>Cause you don&rsquo;t have the noise trailing</p>
<p>into the next round.</p>
<p>You just have the state.</p>
<p>So the paper in particular,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s just a beautiful idea to use a chemical computer</p>
<p>to construct the cellular automaton,</p>
<p>the famous one of game of life.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also interesting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really interesting scientific question</p>
<p>of whether some kind of random perturbations</p>
<p>or some source of randomness</p>
<p>can have a significant constructive effect</p>
<p>on the complexity of the system.</p>
<p>And indeed, I mean, whether it&rsquo;s random</p>
<p>or just non deterministic</p>
<p>and can we bake in that non determinism at the beginning?</p>
<p>I wonder what is the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think of what is the encoding space.</p>
<p>The encoding space is pretty big.</p>
<p>We have 49 stirrups of 49 cells,</p>
<p>49 chem bits all connected to one another</p>
<p>and like an analog computer,</p>
<p>but being read out discreetly as the BZ reaction.</p>
<p>So just to say the BZ reaction is a chemical oscillator.</p>
<p>And what happened in each cell</p>
<p>is it goes between red and blue.</p>
<p>So two Russians discovered it,</p>
<p>Belouzov and Sapkinsky.</p>
<p>I think Belouzov first proposed it</p>
<p>and everyone said, you&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>It breaks the second law.</p>
<p>And Sapkinsky said, no, it doesn&rsquo;t break the second law.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s consuming a fuel.</p>
<p>And so, and then, and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of chemistry hidden</p>
<p>in the Russian literature actually,</p>
<p>because Russians just wrote it in Russian.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t publish it in English speaking journals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heartbreaking actually.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s sad and it&rsquo;s great that it&rsquo;s there, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not lost.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we will find a way of translating it properly.</p>
<p>Well, the silver lining slash greater sadness</p>
<p>of all of this is there&rsquo;s probably ideas</p>
<p>in English speaking.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s ideas in certain disciplines</p>
<p>that if discovered by other disciplines</p>
<p>would crack open some of the biggest mysteries</p>
<p>in those disciplines.</p>
<p>Like computer science, for example,</p>
<p>is trying to solve problems</p>
<p>like nobody else has ever tried to solve problems.</p>
<p>As if it&rsquo;s not already been all addressed</p>
<p>in cognitive science and psychology,</p>
<p>in mathematics, in physics,</p>
<p>in just whatever you want to, economics even.</p>
<p>But if you look into that literature,</p>
<p>you might be able to discover some beautiful ideas.</p>
<p>Obviously Russian is an interesting case of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a loss in translation,</p>
<p>but you said there&rsquo;s a source of fuel, a source of energy.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So the BZ reaction, you have an acid in there</p>
<p>called malonic acid.</p>
<p>And what happens is it&rsquo;s basically like a battery</p>
<p>that powers it and it loses CO2.</p>
<p>So decarboxylates, it&rsquo;s just a chemical reaction.</p>
<p>What that means we have to do is continuously feed</p>
<p>or we just keep the BZ reaction going</p>
<p>in a long enough time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s reversible in time.</p>
<p>But only like, yeah.</p>
<p>But only like, but it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, the team that did it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really proud of their persistence.</p>
<p>We made a chemical computer and it can solve</p>
<p>little problems.</p>
<p>It can solve traveling salesman problems actually.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>But like I say, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But not any faster than a regular computer.</p>
<p>Is there something you can do?</p>
<p>Maybe, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I think we can come up with a way of solving problems,</p>
<p>also really complex, hard ones,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an analog computer and we can,</p>
<p>it can energy minimize really quickly.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to basically go through every element</p>
<p>in the matrix, like flip it, it just reads out.</p>
<p>So we could actually do Monte Carlo</p>
<p>by just shaking the box.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally a box shaker.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually have to encode the shaking of the box</p>
<p>in a silicon memory and then just shuffle everything around.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you can.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s analog, it&rsquo;s natural.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an organic computer.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I was playing around with this</p>
<p>and I was kind of annoying some of my colleagues</p>
<p>and wondering if we could get to chemical supremacy</p>
<p>like quantum supremacy.</p>
<p>And I kind of calculated how big the grid has to be</p>
<p>so we can actually start to solve problems faster</p>
<p>than a silicon computer.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not willing to state how that is yet</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m probably wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s any top secret thing</p>
<p>is I want, I think I can make a chemical computer</p>
<p>that can solve optimization problems faster</p>
<p>than the silicon computer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re unsure how big that has to be.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, I mean.</p>
<p>It might be a big box, hard to shake.</p>
<p>It might be exactly a big box, hard to shake</p>
<p>and basically a bit sloppy.</p>
<p>Did we answer the question about</p>
<p>do cellular atomic exists outside the mind?</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t, but I would posit that they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I, but I think minds can, well.</p>
<p>So the mind is fundamental.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, why?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, sorry, let&rsquo;s go back.</p>
<p>So as a physical phenomena, do CAs exist</p>
<p>in physical reality, right?</p>
<p>I would say they probably don&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>outside the human mind, but now we&rsquo;ve constructed them.</p>
<p>They exist in computer memories.</p>
<p>They exist in my lab.</p>
<p>They exist on paper.</p>
<p>So they are, they emerge from the human mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just interested in, because Stephen Wolfram likes CAs,</p>
<p>a lot of people like CAs and likes to think of them</p>
<p>as minimal computational elements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, well, do they exist in reality</p>
<p>or are they a representation of a simple machine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just very elegant to implement?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a platonic question, I guess.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s initial conditions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a memory in the system.</p>
<p>There are simple rules that dictate</p>
<p>the evolution of the system.</p>
<p>So what exists?</p>
<p>The idea, the rules, the.</p>
<p>Yeah, people are using CAs as models</p>
<p>for things in reality to say, hey, look,</p>
<p>you can do this thing in a CA.</p>
<p>And my, when I see this, I&rsquo;m saying, oh, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>But what does that tell me about reality?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the CA in space?</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>Well, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mathematical object.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know cellular automata,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s usually a grid, whether it&rsquo;s one dimensional,</p>
<p>two dimensional, or three dimensional.</p>
<p>And it evolves by simple local rules,</p>
<p>like you die or are born if the neighbors are alive or dead.</p>
<p>And it turns out if you have,</p>
<p>with certain kinds of initial conditions</p>
<p>and with certain kinds of very simple rules,</p>
<p>you can create like arbitrarily complex</p>
<p>and beautiful systems.</p>
<p>And to me, whether drugs are involved or not,</p>
<p>I can sit back for hours and enjoy the mystery of it,</p>
<p>how such complexity can emerge as it gives me almost like,</p>
<p>you know, people talk about religious experiences.</p>
<p>It gives me a sense that you get to have a glimpse</p>
<p>at the origin of this whole thing.</p>
<p>Whatever is creating this complexity from such simplicity</p>
<p>is the very thing that brought my mind to life,</p>
<p>this me, the human, our human civilization.</p>
<p>And yes, those constructs are pretty trivial.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part of their magic</p>
<p>is even in this trivial framework,</p>
<p>you could see the emergence,</p>
<p>or especially in this trivial framework,</p>
<p>you could see the emergence of complexity from simplicity.</p>
<p>I guess what Lee, you&rsquo;re saying is that this is not,</p>
<p>you know, this is highly unlike systems</p>
<p>we see in the physical world,</p>
<p>even though they probably carry some of the same magic,</p>
<p>like mechanistically, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m saying that the operating system</p>
<p>that a CA has to exist on is quite complex.</p>
<p>And so I wonder if you&rsquo;re getting the complexity</p>
<p>out of the CA from the boundary conditions</p>
<p>of the operating system, the underlying digital computer.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, those are some strong words against CAs then.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize. Not against.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m in love with CAs as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying they aren&rsquo;t as trivial as people think.</p>
<p>They are incredible.</p>
<p>To get to that richness,</p>
<p>you have to iterate billions of times,</p>
<p>and you need a display, and you need a math coprocessor,</p>
<p>and you need a von Neumann machine</p>
<p>based on a Turing machine</p>
<p>of digital error correction and states.</p>
<p>Wow, to think that for the simplicity of a grid,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically saying a grid is not simple.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It requires incredible complexity to bring a grid to life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Well, then what is simple?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I wanted to say.</p>
<p>I agree with you with the wonder of CAs, I just think.</p>
<p>But remember, we take so much for granted</p>
<p>what the CA is resting on.</p>
<p>Because von Neumann and Feynman weren&rsquo;t showing,</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t seeing these elaborate structures.</p>
<p>They could not get that far.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s the limitation of their mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>The limitation of their pencil.</p>
<p>But I think the question is</p>
<p>whether the essential elements of the cellular automata</p>
<p>is present without all the complexities</p>
<p>required to build a computer.</p>
<p>And my intuition, the reason I find it incredible</p>
<p>is that, yeah, my intuition is yes.</p>
<p>It might look different.</p>
<p>There might not be a grid like structure,</p>
<p>but local interactions operating under simple rules</p>
<p>and resulting in multi hierarchical complex structures</p>
<p>feels like a thing that doesn&rsquo;t require a computer.</p>
<p>I agree, but coming back to von Neumann and Feynman</p>
<p>and Wolfram, their minds, the non trivial minds</p>
<p>to create those architectures and do it</p>
<p>and to put on those state transitions.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really incredibly interesting</p>
<p>that is understanding how the human mind</p>
<p>builds those state transition machines.</p>
<p>I could see how deeply in love</p>
<p>with the idea of memory you are.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like how much of E equals MC squared</p>
<p>is more than an equation.</p>
<p>It has Albert Einstein in it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying you can&rsquo;t just say this is a,</p>
<p>like the equations of physics are a really good</p>
<p>simple capture of a physical phenomenon.</p>
<p>It is also, that equation has the memory of the humans.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re implying this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s a beautiful idea,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m comfortable</p>
<p>with that sort of diminishing the power of that equation.</p>
<p>No, no, it enhances it.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s built on the shoulders, it enhances it.</p>
<p>I think it enhances it, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>that equation is a minimal compressed representation</p>
<p>of reality, right?</p>
<p>We can use machine learning or Max Tegmark&rsquo;s AI Feynman</p>
<p>to find lots of solutions for gravity,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t it wonderful that the laws that we do find</p>
<p>are the maximally compressed representations?</p>
<p>Yeah, but that representation, you can now give it as,</p>
<p>I guess the universe has the memory of Einstein</p>
<p>with that representation.</p>
<p>But then you can now give it as a gift for free.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s low memory.</p>
<p>To other alien civilizations.</p>
<p>Einstein had to go through a lot of pain to get there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s low memory.</p>
<p>So, I say that physics and chemistry and biology</p>
<p>are the same discipline.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just physics, laws in physics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as a law in physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just low memory stuff.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve got low memory stuff,</p>
<p>you can, things reoccur quickly.</p>
<p>As you can get, build in more memory,</p>
<p>you get to chemistry, so things become more contingent.</p>
<p>When you get to biology, more contingent still,</p>
<p>and then technology.</p>
<p>So, the more memory you need,</p>
<p>the more your laws are local.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>And the less memory, the more the laws are universal,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not laws.</p>
<p>They are just low memory states.</p>
<p>We have to talk about a thing you&rsquo;ve kind of mentioned</p>
<p>already a bunch of times,</p>
<p>but doing computation through chemistry,</p>
<p>chemical based computation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen you refer to it as in a sexy title</p>
<p>of Kemputation, Kemputation.</p>
<p>So, what is computation?</p>
<p>What is chemical based computation?</p>
<p>Okay, so Kemputation is a name I gave</p>
<p>to the process of building a state machine</p>
<p>to make any molecule physically in the lab.</p>
<p>And so, as a chemist, chemists make molecules by hand.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re quite hard.</p>
<p>The chemists have a lot of tacit knowledge,</p>
<p>a lot of ambiguity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not possible to go uniformly to the literature</p>
<p>and read a recipe to make a molecule,</p>
<p>and then go and make it in the lab every time.</p>
<p>Some recipes are better than others,</p>
<p>but they all assume some knowledge.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not universal what that is.</p>
<p>Like, so it&rsquo;s carried from human to human.</p>
<p>Some of that implicit knowledge.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying, can we remove the human</p>
<p>from the patient?</p>
<p>Can we like a program?</p>
<p>Okay, well, by the way, what is a state machine?</p>
<p>So a state machine is a, I suppose,</p>
<p>a object either abstract or mechanical</p>
<p>where you can do a unit operation on it</p>
<p>and flick it from one state to another.</p>
<p>So a turnstile would be a good example of a state machine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some kinds of states</p>
<p>and some kind of transitions between states.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very formal in nature</p>
<p>in terms of like it&rsquo;s precise,</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re doing those transitions.</p>
<p>Yes, you can mathematically precisely</p>
<p>describe a state machine.</p>
<p>So, I mean, a very simple Boolean gates</p>
<p>are a very good way of building</p>
<p>kind of logic based state machines.</p>
<p>Obviously a Turing machine,</p>
<p>the concept of a Turing machine</p>
<p>where you have a tape and a read head</p>
<p>and a series of rules in a table</p>
<p>and you would basically look at what&rsquo;s on the tape.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re shifting the tape from left to right,</p>
<p>and if you see a zero or one,</p>
<p>you look in your lookup table and say,</p>
<p>right, I&rsquo;ve seen a zero and a one.</p>
<p>I then do, I then respond to that.</p>
<p>So in the turnstile would be,</p>
<p>is there a human being pushing the turnstile</p>
<p>in direction clockwise?</p>
<p>If yes, I will open, let them go.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s anticlockwise, no.</p>
<p>So yeah, so a state machine has some labels</p>
<p>and a transition diagram.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking to come up with a chemical computer</p>
<p>to form state machines to create molecules,</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s the chicken and the egg?</p>
<p>So computation is not a chemical computer</p>
<p>because we talked a few moments</p>
<p>about actually doing computations with chemicals.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m now saying is I want to use state machines</p>
<p>to transform chemicals.</p>
<p>And so build chemicals programmatically.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I get in trouble saying this.</p>
<p>I said to my group, oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t say it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, but I said, look, we should make the crack bot.</p>
<p>Is it in the crack robot?</p>
<p>The robot that makes crack.</p>
<p>The crack bot?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh, oh, crack bot.</p>
<p>The robot that makes crack,</p>
<p>but maybe we should scrub this from, but.</p>
<p>Or, well, so maybe you can educate me</p>
<p>on breaking bad with like math, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so in breaking bad.</p>
<p>You want to make basically some kind of mix</p>
<p>of ex machina and breaking bad.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>For the record, I don&rsquo;t, but I said.</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I said, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do</p>
<p>once you release the papers.</p>
<p>I shaved my head and I&rsquo;m going to live a life of crime.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>So yeah, let&rsquo;s get back to, so indeed,</p>
<p>it is about making drugs, but importantly,</p>
<p>making important drugs, so let&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>All drugs matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, but let&rsquo;s go back.</p>
<p>So the basic thesis is chemistry is very analog.</p>
<p>There is no state machine.</p>
<p>And I wandered into the, through the paper walls</p>
<p>in the Japanese house a few years ago and said,</p>
<p>okay, hey, organic chemist, why are you doing this analog?</p>
<p>They said, well, chemistry is really hard.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t automate it, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>I said, but is it impossible?</p>
<p>They said, yeah.</p>
<p>And they said, you know, I got the impression</p>
<p>they were saying it&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>And so when people tell me things are magic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, no, no, they can&rsquo;t be magic.</p>
<p>Right, so let&rsquo;s break this down.</p>
<p>And so what I did is I went to my group one day</p>
<p>about eight years ago and said, hey guys,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written this new programming language for you.</p>
<p>And so everything is clear.</p>
<p>And you know, you have to, you&rsquo;re not allowed to</p>
<p>just wander around the lab willy nilly.</p>
<p>You have to pick up things in order,</p>
<p>go to the balance of the right time and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And they looked at me as if I was insane</p>
<p>and basically kicked me out of the lab and said,</p>
<p>no, don&rsquo;t do that, we&rsquo;re not doing that.</p>
<p>And I said, okay.</p>
<p>So I went back the next day and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna find some money so we can make cool robots</p>
<p>do chemical reactions.</p>
<p>And everyone went, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>And so in that process.</p>
<p>The first we tried to convert the humans to become robots</p>
<p>and next you agree you might as well just create the robots.</p>
<p>Yes, but so in that, the formalization process.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what I did is I said, look, chemical,</p>
<p>to make a molecule, you need to do four things abstractly.</p>
<p>I want to make a chemical Turing machine.</p>
<p>Cause a Turing machine, you think about this,</p>
<p>imagine a Turing machine.</p>
<p>Turing machine is the ultimate abstraction of a computation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been shown by Turing and others</p>
<p>that basically a universal Turing machine</p>
<p>should be able to do all computations that you can imagine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wow, why don&rsquo;t I think of a Turing machine</p>
<p>for chemistry?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think of a magic robot that can make any molecule.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about that for a second.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>How do we then implement it?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So what is the abstraction?</p>
<p>So to make any molecule, you have to do a reaction.</p>
<p>So you have to put reagents together, do a reaction</p>
<p>in a flask typically.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re after the reaction,</p>
<p>you have to stop the reactions.</p>
<p>You do what&rsquo;s called a workup.</p>
<p>So whatever, cool it down, add some liquid to it, extract.</p>
<p>So then after you do the workup, you separate.</p>
<p>So you then remove the molecules, separate them all out.</p>
<p>And then the final step is purification.</p>
<p>So reaction, workup, separate, purify.</p>
<p>So this is basically exactly like a Turing machine</p>
<p>where you have your tape, you have your tape head,</p>
<p>you have some rules, and then you run it.</p>
<p>So I thought, cool.</p>
<p>I went to all the chemists and said, look,</p>
<p>chemistry isn&rsquo;t that hard.</p>
<p>Reaction, workup, separation, purification.</p>
<p>Do that in cycles, forever, for any molecule,</p>
<p>all the chemistry, done.</p>
<p>And they said, chemistry is that hard.</p>
<p>I said, but just in principle.</p>
<p>And I got a few very enlightened people to say,</p>
<p>yeah, okay, in principle, but it ain&rsquo;t gonna work.</p>
<p>And this was in about 2013, 2014.</p>
<p>And I found myself going to an architecture conference</p>
<p>almost by accident.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why am I at this random conference</p>
<p>on architecture?</p>
<p>And that was because I published a paper</p>
<p>on inorganic architecture.</p>
<p>And they said, come to architecture conference.</p>
<p>But the inorganic architecture is nano architecture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, and I went, okay.</p>
<p>And then I found these guys at the conference,</p>
<p>3D printing ping pong balls and shapes.</p>
<p>And this is through it.</p>
<p>3D printing was cool.</p>
<p>And I was like, this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Why are you 3D printing ping pong balls?</p>
<p>And I gave them a whole load of abuse</p>
<p>like I normally do when I first meet people,</p>
<p>how to win friends and influence people.</p>
<p>And then I was like, oh my God, you guys are geniuses.</p>
<p>And so I got from, they were a bit confused</p>
<p>because I was calling them idiots</p>
<p>and then call them geniuses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, will you come to my lab</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna build a robot to do chemistry</p>
<p>with a 3D printer.</p>
<p>And I said, oh, that&rsquo;s cool, all right.</p>
<p>So I had them come to the lab</p>
<p>and we started to 3D print test tubes.</p>
<p>So you imagine, you know, 3D print a bottle</p>
<p>and then use the same gantry to basically,</p>
<p>rather than to squirt out a plastic out of a nozzle,</p>
<p>have a little syringe and jet chemicals in.</p>
<p>So we had the 3D printer that could simultaneously</p>
<p>print the test tube and then put chemicals</p>
<p>into the test tube.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>Wow, so it&rsquo;s really end to end.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was like, that would be cool</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve got G code to do it all.</p>
<p>And I was like, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>So I got my group doing this and I developed it a bit</p>
<p>and I realized that we could take those unit operations.</p>
<p>And we built a whole bunch of pumps and valves.</p>
<p>And I realized that I could basically take the literature</p>
<p>and I made the first version of the computer in 2016, 17.</p>
<p>I made some architectural decisions.</p>
<p>So I designed the pumps and valves in my group.</p>
<p>I did all the electronics in my group.</p>
<p>They were brilliant.</p>
<p>I cannot pay tribute to my group enough in doing this.</p>
<p>They were just brilliant.</p>
<p>And there were some poor souls there that said,</p>
<p>Lee, why are you making us design electronics?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, because I don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, so you&rsquo;re making us design stuff</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, it&rsquo;s like, but can we not just buy some?</p>
<p>I said, well, we can, but then I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>how to, you know, what bus they&rsquo;re gonna use</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s serial ports and all this stuff.</p>
<p>I just wanted, and I made, I came up with a decision</p>
<p>to design a bunch of pumps and valves</p>
<p>and use power of the ethernet.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got one cable for power and data,</p>
<p>plug them all in, plug them all into a router</p>
<p>and then I made the state machine.</p>
<p>And there was a couple of cool things I did.</p>
<p>Oh, they did actually.</p>
<p>We got the abstraction.</p>
<p>So reaction, workup, separation, purification.</p>
<p>And then I made the decision to do it in batch.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s in batch.</p>
<p>All chemistry had been digitized before apparently,</p>
<p>and once it&rsquo;s been done, but everyone been doing it in flow</p>
<p>and flow is continuous and there are infinities everywhere</p>
<p>and you have to just, and I realized</p>
<p>that I could actually make a state machine</p>
<p>where I basically put stuff in the reactor,</p>
<p>turn it up from one state to another state,</p>
<p>stop it and just read it out.</p>
<p>And okay, and I was kind of bitching</p>
<p>at electrical engineers saying, you have it easy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to clean out the electrons, you know.</p>
<p>Electrons don&rsquo;t leave a big mess.</p>
<p>They leave some EM waste.</p>
<p>But in my state machine I built in cleaning.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, we do all the operation</p>
<p>and then it cleans the backbone and then can do it again.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no, so what we managed to do</p>
<p>over a couple of years is develop the hardware,</p>
<p>develop the state machine.</p>
<p>And we encoded three molecules.</p>
<p>We did three, the first three, we did nitole,</p>
<p>a sleeping drug, rafinamide, antiseizure and Viagra.</p>
<p>You know, and I could make jokes on the paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard problem, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>And then in the next one, what we did is said, okay,</p>
<p>my poor organic chemist said, look, Lee,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve worked with you this long.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made a robot that looks like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna take our jobs away.</p>
<p>And not just take our jobs away, what we love in the lab,</p>
<p>but now we have to become programmers.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not even good programmers.</p>
<p>We just have to spend ages writing lines of code</p>
<p>that are boring and it&rsquo;s not as elegant.</p>
<p>I went, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So then, but I knew because I had this abstraction</p>
<p>and I knew that there was language,</p>
<p>I could suddenly develop a state machine</p>
<p>that would interpret the language,</p>
<p>which was lossy and ambiguous and populate my abstraction.</p>
<p>So I built a chemical programming language</p>
<p>that is actually gonna be recursively enumerable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a Turing complete language actually,</p>
<p>which is kind of cool, which means it&rsquo;s formally verifiable.</p>
<p>So where we are now is we can now read the literature</p>
<p>using a bit of natural language processing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the best.</p>
<p>There are many other groups have done a better job,</p>
<p>but we can use that language reading</p>
<p>to populate the state machine and basically add, subtract.</p>
<p>We got about a number of primitives that we,</p>
<p>basically program loops that we dovetail together</p>
<p>and we can make any molecule with it.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s the kind of program synthesis.</p>
<p>So you start at like literally,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about like a paper,</p>
<p>like a scientific paper that&rsquo;s being read.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So natural language processing,</p>
<p>extracting some kind of details about chemical reactions</p>
<p>and the chemical molecules and compounds involved.</p>
<p>And then that, in GPT terms,</p>
<p>serves as a prompt for the program synthesis</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of trivial right now.</p>
<p>There you have a bunch of different like for loops</p>
<p>and so on that creates a program in this chemical language</p>
<p>that can then be interpreted by the chemical computer,</p>
<p>the computer.</p>
<p>Yeah, computer, that&rsquo;s the word.</p>
<p>Computer, yeah.</p>
<p>Everything sounds better in your British accent,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, I love it.</p>
<p>So the, into the computer and that&rsquo;s able to then</p>
<p>basically be a 3D printer for these, for molecules.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a 3D printer.</p>
<p>I would call it a universal chemical reaction system</p>
<p>because 3D printing gives the wrong impression, but yeah.</p>
<p>And it purifies.</p>
<p>And the nice thing is that that code now that we call it,</p>
<p>the KyDL code is really interesting because now,</p>
<p>so computation, what is computation?</p>
<p>Computation is what computing is to mathematics, I think.</p>
<p>Computation is the process of taking chemical code</p>
<p>and some input reagents and making the same molecule,</p>
<p>making the molecule reproducibly every time without fail.</p>
<p>What is computation?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the process of using a program</p>
<p>to take some input conditions</p>
<p>and give you an output same every time, right, reliably.</p>
<p>So the problem is, now maybe you can push back</p>
<p>and correct me on this.</p>
<p>So I know biology is messy.</p>
<p>My question is how messy is chemistry?</p>
<p>So the, if we use the analogy of a computer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to make computation in a computer very precise,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s repeatable and makes errors almost never.</p>
<p>If it does the exact same way over and over</p>
<p>and over and over.</p>
<p>What about chemistry?</p>
<p>Is there messiness in the whole thing?</p>
<p>Can that be somehow leveraged?</p>
<p>Can that be controlled?</p>
<p>Can it be that removed,</p>
<p>do we wanna remove it from the system?</p>
<p>Oh, yes and no, right.</p>
<p>Is there messiness?</p>
<p>There is messiness because chemistry is like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing reactions on billions of molecules</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t always work,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve got purification there.</p>
<p>And so what we found is at the beginning,</p>
<p>everyone said it can&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be too messy.</p>
<p>It will just fail.</p>
<p>And I said, but you managed to get chemistry</p>
<p>to work in the lab.</p>
<p>Are you magic?</p>
<p>Are you doing something?</p>
<p>So I would say, now go back to the first ever computer</p>
<p>or the ENIAC, 5 million soldered joints,</p>
<p>400,000 valves that are exploding all the time.</p>
<p>Was that, would you have gone, okay, that&rsquo;s messy.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got the,</p>
<p>have we got the equivalent of the ENIAC in my lab?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got 15 computers in the lab now.</p>
<p>And they, are they unreliable?</p>
<p>Yeah, they fall apart here and there,</p>
<p>but are they getting better really quickly?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are they now able to reliably make more,</p>
<p>are we at the point in the lab</p>
<p>where there are some molecules</p>
<p>we would rather make on the computer</p>
<p>than have a human being make?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ve just done,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve just made a anti influenza molecule</p>
<p>and some antivirals,</p>
<p>six steps on the computer that would take a human being</p>
<p>about one week to make Arbidol of continuous labor.</p>
<p>And all they do now is load up the reagents,</p>
<p>press go button and just go away and drink coffee.</p>
<p>Wow, so this, I mean, and this is, you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>this computer is just the early days.</p>
<p>And so like some of the criticism just have to do</p>
<p>with the early days.</p>
<p>And yes, I would say this,</p>
<p>something like this is quite impossible.</p>
<p>So the fact that you&rsquo;re doing this is incredible.</p>
<p>Not impossible, of course, but extremely difficult.</p>
<p>It did seem really difficult.</p>
<p>And I do keep pinching myself when I go in the lab.</p>
<p>I was like, is it working?</p>
<p>Like, yep.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, you know, it does clog, it does stop.</p>
<p>You got to clean, this is great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, but it&rsquo;s getting more reliable</p>
<p>because I made some, we just made design decisions</p>
<p>and said, we are not going to abandon the abstraction.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>If the von Neumann implementation was abandoned,</p>
<p>I mean, think about what we do to semiconductors</p>
<p>to really constrain them to what we do to silicon</p>
<p>in a fab lab, we take computation for granted.</p>
<p>Silicon is not in its natural state.</p>
<p>We are doping the hell out of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible what they&rsquo;re able to accomplish</p>
<p>and achieve that reliability at the scale they do.</p>
<p>Like you said, that&rsquo;s after Moore&rsquo;s law, what we have now.</p>
<p>And where we, you know, how it started, you know,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>We started at the bottom, now we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>We have only have 20 million molecules.</p>
<p>Well, say 20 million molecules in one database,</p>
<p>maybe a few hundred million</p>
<p>in all the pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>And those few hundred million molecules are responsible</p>
<p>for all the drugs that we&rsquo;ve had in humanity,</p>
<p>except, you know, biologics for the last 50 years.</p>
<p>Now imagine what happens when a drug goes out of print,</p>
<p>goes out of print because there&rsquo;s only a finite number</p>
<p>of manufacturing facilities in the world</p>
<p>that make these drugs.</p>
<p>It goes out of print.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that computer?</p>
<p>This is a printing press, but for chemistry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And not only that, we can protect the KyDL</p>
<p>so we can stop bad actors doing it.</p>
<p>We can encrypt them and we can give people license.</p>
<p>KyDL, that&rsquo;s the name, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>is the name of the programming language?</p>
<p>Yeah, the KyDL is the name of the programming language</p>
<p>and the code we give the chemicals.</p>
<p>So Ky, as in, you know, just for,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually like an XML format,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve now taken it from script</p>
<p>to a fully expressible programming language</p>
<p>so we can do dynamics and there&rsquo;s for loops in there</p>
<p>and conditional statements.</p>
<p>Right, but the structure, it started out as like an XML</p>
<p>type of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And also, the chemist doesn&rsquo;t need to program in KyDL.</p>
<p>They can just go to the software and type in add A to B,</p>
<p>reflux, do what they would normally do,</p>
<p>and it just converts it to KyDL</p>
<p>and they have a linter to check it and error correct.</p>
<p>So how do you, you know, not with ASCII,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s a Greek letter,</p>
<p>how do you go with, how do you spell it</p>
<p>just using the English alphabet?</p>
<p>We just, XDL?</p>
<p>XDL, but all we use, we put in Ky.</p>
<p>And it was named by one of my students</p>
<p>and one of my postdocs many years ago</p>
<p>and I quite liked it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s important, I think,</p>
<p>when the team are contributing to such big ideas,</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s their ideas as well.</p>
<p>I try not to just rename, I didn&rsquo;t call it Cronon</p>
<p>or anything that, cause they keep saying, you know,</p>
<p>is the chemistry, when they&rsquo;re putting stuff</p>
<p>in the computer, one of my students said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re asking now, is it Cronon complete?</p>
<p>And I was like, what does that mean?</p>
<p>I said, well, can we make it on the damn machine?</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, is that a compliment or a majority?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re like, well, it might be both.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you tweeted, quote,</p>
<p>why does chemistry need a universal programming language,</p>
<p>question mark?</p>
<p>For all the reasons you can think of.</p>
<p>Reliability, interoperability, collaboration,</p>
<p>remove ambiguity, lower cost, increase safety,</p>
<p>open up discovery, molecular customization,</p>
<p>and publication of executable chemical code.</p>
<p>Which is fascinating, by the way.</p>
<p>Just publish code.</p>
<p>And can you maybe elaborate a little bit more</p>
<p>about this CHI DL, what does the universal language</p>
<p>of chemistry look like?</p>
<p>A Cronon complete language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Turing complete language, really.</p>
<p>But, so what it has, it has a series of operators in it,</p>
<p>like add, heat, stir.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of unit operations.</p>
<p>And all it is, really, is just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s with chemical engineers,</p>
<p>when I talked about this,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve just rediscovered chemical engineering.</p>
<p>And I said, well, yeah, I know.</p>
<p>I said, well, that&rsquo;s trivial.</p>
<p>I said, well, not really.</p>
<p>Well, yes, it is trivial, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>because not only have we rediscovered chemical engineering,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve made it implementable on the universal hardware</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t cost very much money.</p>
<p>And so the CHI DL has a series of statements.</p>
<p>Like define the reactor.</p>
<p>So defines the reagents.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re all labels, so you assign them.</p>
<p>And what I also implemented at the beginning is,</p>
<p>because I give all the hardware IP address,</p>
<p>you put it on a graph.</p>
<p>And so what it does is like the graph is equivalent</p>
<p>to the processor firmware, the processor code.</p>
<p>So when you take your CHI DL,</p>
<p>and you go to run it on your computer,</p>
<p>you can run it on any compatible hardware</p>
<p>in any configuration, it says, what does your graph look like?</p>
<p>As long as I can solve the problem on the graph</p>
<p>with these unit operations,</p>
<p>and you have the resources available, it can compile.</p>
<p>Chem piles.</p>
<p>Ah ha.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>All right, we can carry on for years.</p>
<p>But it is really, it&rsquo;s chempilation.</p>
<p>Chempilation, yeah.</p>
<p>And what it now does is it says, okay,</p>
<p>the problem we have before is it was possible</p>
<p>to do robotics for chemistry,</p>
<p>but the robots were really expensive.</p>
<p>They were unique.</p>
<p>They were vendor locked.</p>
<p>And what I want to do is to make sure</p>
<p>that every chemist in the world can get access</p>
<p>to machinery like this at virtually no cost,</p>
<p>because it makes it safer.</p>
<p>It makes it more reliable.</p>
<p>And then if you go to the literature</p>
<p>and you find a molecule that could potentially cure cancer,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say the molecule that could potentially</p>
<p>cure cancer takes you three years to repeat,</p>
<p>and maybe a student finishes their PhD in the time</p>
<p>and they never get it back.</p>
<p>So that it&rsquo;s really hard to kind of get all the way</p>
<p>to that molecule, and it limits the ability</p>
<p>of humanity to build on it.</p>
<p>If they just download the code and can execute it,</p>
<p>it turns, I would say the electronic laboratory notebook</p>
<p>in chemistry is a data cemetery,</p>
<p>because no one will ever reproduce it.</p>
<p>For now, the data cemetery is a Jupiter notebook</p>
<p>and you can just execute it.</p>
<p>A notebook and people can play with it,</p>
<p>the access to it.</p>
<p>Reversion it.</p>
<p>Orders of magnitude is increased.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about the, so as with all technologies,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s way more exciting possibilities,</p>
<p>but there are also terrifying possibilities,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about all of them.</p>
<p>But let me just kind of linger on the machine learning</p>
<p>side of this.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re describing programming,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a language, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>about OpenAI Codex, which is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m playing with it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re playing, of course you are.</p>
<p>Yeah, you really are Rick from Rick and Morty.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Okay, except philosophically deep.</p>
<p>I mean, he is, I guess, kind of philosophically deep too.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, GPT, GPT3,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a language model that can do natural language</p>
<p>generation, so you can give it a prompt</p>
<p>and it can complete the rest of it.</p>
<p>But it turns out that that kind of prompt,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just completes the rest of it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s generating like novel sounding text,</p>
<p>and then you can apply that to generation</p>
<p>of other kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>So these kinds of transformer based language models</p>
<p>are really good at forming deep representations</p>
<p>of a particular space, like a medium, like language.</p>
<p>So you can then apply it to specific subset of language</p>
<p>like programming, so you can have it learn</p>
<p>the representation of the Python programming language</p>
<p>and use it to then generate syntactically</p>
<p>and semantically correct programs.</p>
<p>So you can start to make progress on one of the hardest</p>
<p>problems in computer science, which is program synthesis.</p>
<p>How do you write programs that accomplish different tasks?</p>
<p>So what OpenAI Codex does is it to generate</p>
<p>those programs based on a prompt of some kind.</p>
<p>Usually you can do a natural language prompt,</p>
<p>so basically as you do when you program,</p>
<p>you write some comment which serves the basic documentation</p>
<p>of the inputs and the outputs and the function</p>
<p>of the particular set of code and it&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to generate that.</p>
<p>Point being is you can generate programs</p>
<p>using machine learning, using neural networks.</p>
<p>Those programs operate on the boring old computer.</p>
<p>Can you generate programs that operate,</p>
<p>this gotta be a clever version of programs for this,</p>
<p>but can you write programs that operate on a computer?</p>
<p>Yep, there&rsquo;s actually software out there right now</p>
<p>you can go and do it.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s a heuristic, it&rsquo;s rule based,</p>
<p>but we have, what we&rsquo;ve done, inspired by Codex actually,</p>
<p>is over the summer I ran a little workshop.</p>
<p>Some of my groups got this inspired idea</p>
<p>that we should get a load of students</p>
<p>and ask them to manually collect data,</p>
<p>to label chemical procedures into Kydy L.</p>
<p>And we have a cool synth reader.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of people doing this right now,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re doing it without abstraction.</p>
<p>And because we have an abstraction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s implementable in the hardware,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve developed basically a chemical analog of Codex.</p>
<p>When you say, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>when you say abstraction in the hardware, what do you mean?</p>
<p>So right now, a lot of people doing machine learning</p>
<p>and reading chemistry and saying,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;ve got all these operations,</p>
<p>add, shake, whatever, heat.</p>
<p>But because they don&rsquo;t have a uniform,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a couple of groups doing it,</p>
<p>competitors actually, and they&rsquo;re good, very good.</p>
<p>But they can&rsquo;t run that code automatically.</p>
<p>They are losing meaning.</p>
<p>And the really important thing that you have to do</p>
<p>is generate context.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;ve learned to do with our abstraction</p>
<p>is make sure we can pull the context out of the text.</p>
<p>And so can we take a chemical procedure</p>
<p>and read it and generate our executable code?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hardest part about that whole pipeline</p>
<p>from the initial text, interpreting the initial text</p>
<p>of a paper, extracting the meaningful context</p>
<p>and the meaningful chemical information</p>
<p>to then generating the program</p>
<p>to then running that program in the hardware?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hardest part about that pipeline</p>
<p>as we look towards a universal Turing computer?</p>
<p>So the hardest thing with the pipeline</p>
<p>is that the software, the model gets confused</p>
<p>between some meanings, right?</p>
<p>So if, you know, chemists are very good at inventing words</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t broken down.</p>
<p>So I would, the classic word that you would use</p>
<p>for boiling something is called reflux.</p>
<p>So reflux is, you would have a solvent</p>
<p>in a round bottom flask, at reflux it would be boiling,</p>
<p>going up the reflux condenser and coming down.</p>
<p>But that term reflux to reflux could be changed, you know,</p>
<p>to people often make up words, new words,</p>
<p>and then the software can fall over.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;ve been able to do is a bit like in Python</p>
<p>or any programming language is identify</p>
<p>when things aren&rsquo;t matched.</p>
<p>So you present the code and you say, this isn&rsquo;t matched.</p>
<p>You may want to think about this.</p>
<p>And then the user goes and says, oh, I mean reflux</p>
<p>and just ticks a box and collects it.</p>
<p>So what the Codex or the Chemex does in this case</p>
<p>is it just, it suggests the first go</p>
<p>and then the chemist goes in and corrects it.</p>
<p>And I really want the chemist to correct it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not safe, I believe, for it to allow AI</p>
<p>to just read literature and generate code at this stage.</p>
<p>Because now you&rsquo;re having actual, by the way, Chemex,</p>
<p>nice, nice name, so you are unlike, which is fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that we live in a fascinating moment in human history.</p>
<p>But yes, you&rsquo;re literally connecting AI</p>
<p>to some physical and like it&rsquo;s building something</p>
<p>in the physical realm, especially in the space</p>
<p>of chemistry that operates sort of invisibly.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I would say that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really important to understand</p>
<p>those labeling schemes, right?</p>
<p>And one of the things I was never,</p>
<p>I was always worried about the beginning</p>
<p>that the abstraction was gonna fall over.</p>
<p>And the way we did it was just by brute force to start with.</p>
<p>We just kept reading the literature and saying,</p>
<p>is there anything new?</p>
<p>Can we add a new rule in?</p>
<p>And actually our KyDL language expanded, exploded.</p>
<p>There was so many extra things we had to keep adding.</p>
<p>And then I realized the primitives still were maintained</p>
<p>and I could break them down again.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>I mean, there are problems.</p>
<p>There are problems of interpreting any big sentence</p>
<p>and turning it into an actionable code.</p>
<p>And in Codex, it&rsquo;s not without its problems.</p>
<p>You can crash it quite easily, right?</p>
<p>You can generate nonsense.</p>
<p>But boy, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I would love to learn to program now using Codex, right?</p>
<p>Just hacking around, right?</p>
<p>And I wonder if chemists in the future will learn</p>
<p>to do chemistry by just hacking around with the system</p>
<p>and writing different things.</p>
<p>Because the key thing that we&rsquo;re doing with the chemistry</p>
<p>is that where a lot of mathematical chemistry went wrong</p>
<p>is people, and I think Wolfram does this in Mathematica,</p>
<p>he assumes that chemistry is a reaction where atom A</p>
<p>or molecule A reacts with molecule B</p>
<p>to give molecule C.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what chemistry is.</p>
<p>Chemistry is take some molecule,</p>
<p>take a liquid or a solid, mix it up and heat it</p>
<p>and then extract it.</p>
<p>So the programming language is actually with respect</p>
<p>to the process operations.</p>
<p>And if you flick in process space,</p>
<p>not in chemical graph space, you unlock everything</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s only a finite number of processes</p>
<p>you need to do in chemistry.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s reassuring.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re in the middle of it, it&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the be all and the end all.</p>
<p>And there is like I say, errors that can creep in.</p>
<p>One day we might be able to do it without human interaction</p>
<p>and you simulate it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll know enough about the simulation</p>
<p>that the lab won&rsquo;t catch fire.</p>
<p>But there are so many safety issues right now</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve got to really be very careful,</p>
<p>protecting the user, protecting the environment,</p>
<p>protecting misuse.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s lots to discuss</p>
<p>if you want to go down that route</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very, very interesting.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want Novichoks being made</p>
<p>or explosives being made or recreational drugs being made.</p>
<p>But how do you stop a molecular biologist making a drug</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be important for them looking</p>
<p>at their particular assay</p>
<p>on a bad actor trying to make methamphetamine?</p>
<p>I saw how you looked at me when you said bad actor,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m gonna do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get the details of this so I can be first.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, we can protect you from yourself.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true, but that statement gives me hope.</p>
<p>Does this ultimately excite you about the future</p>
<p>or does it terrify you?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, we mentioned that time is fundamental.</p>
<p>It seems like you&rsquo;re at the cutting edge of progress</p>
<p>that will have to happen, that will happen,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no stopping it.</p>
<p>And I, as we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>I see obviously a huge number of exciting possibilities.</p>
<p>So whenever you automate these kinds of things,</p>
<p>just the world opens up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like programming itself and the computer,</p>
<p>regular computer, has created innumerable applications.</p>
<p>It made the world better in so many dimensions.</p>
<p>And it created, of course, a lot of negative things</p>
<p>that we, for some reason, like to focus on</p>
<p>using that very technology to tweet about it.</p>
<p>But I think it made a much better world,</p>
<p>but it created a lot of new dangers.</p>
<p>So maybe you can speak to when you have,</p>
<p>when you kind of stand at the end of the road</p>
<p>for building a really solid, reliable, universal computer.</p>
<p>What are the possibilities that are positive?</p>
<p>What are the possibilities that are negative?</p>
<p>How can we minimize the chance of the negative?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s so many positive things,</p>
<p>from drug discovery, from supply chain stress,</p>
<p>for basically enabling chemists</p>
<p>to basically build more productive in the lab, right?</p>
<p>Where this is, the computer&rsquo;s not gonna replace the chemist.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a Moore&rsquo;s law of molecules, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be so many more molecules we can design,</p>
<p>so many more diseases we can cure.</p>
<p>So chemists in the lab as researchers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s better for science.</p>
<p>So they can build a bunch of,</p>
<p>like they could do science at a much more accelerated pace.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the development of drugs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually like doing the basic understanding</p>
<p>and the science of drugs.</p>
<p>And the personalization, the cost of drugs right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all living longer, we&rsquo;re all having more and more,</p>
<p>we know more about our genomic development,</p>
<p>we know about our predetermination,</p>
<p>and we might be able to,</p>
<p>one dream I&rsquo;ve got is like,</p>
<p>imagine you can work at your genome assistant</p>
<p>tells you you&rsquo;re gonna get cancer in seven years time,</p>
<p>and you have your personal computer</p>
<p>that cooks up the right molecule just for you to cure it,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really positive idea.</p>
<p>The other thing is when drugs,</p>
<p>so right now I think it&rsquo;s absolutely outrageous</p>
<p>that not all of humanity has access to medicine.</p>
<p>And I think the computer</p>
<p>might be able to change that fundamentally</p>
<p>because it will disrupt the way things are manufactured.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s stop thinking about manufacturing</p>
<p>in different factories.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that computers,</p>
<p>clinical grade computers or drug grade computers</p>
<p>will be in facilities all around the world,</p>
<p>and they can make things on demand</p>
<p>as a function of the cost.</p>
<p>Maybe people won&rsquo;t be able to afford</p>
<p>the latest and greatest patent,</p>
<p>but maybe they&rsquo;ll be able to get the next best thing</p>
<p>and will basically democratize,</p>
<p>make available drugs to everybody that they need.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots of really interesting things there.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>I think that now let&rsquo;s take the negative.</p>
<p>Before we do that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s imagine what happened,</p>
<p>go back to a really tragic accident a few years ago,</p>
<p>well not accident,</p>
<p>an act of murder by that pilot on the,</p>
<p>I think it was Eurowings or Swisswings.</p>
<p>But what he did is plane took off,</p>
<p>he waited till his pilot went to the toilet,</p>
<p>he was a co pilot,</p>
<p>he locked the door and then set the autopilot</p>
<p>above the Alps,</p>
<p>he set the altimeter or the descend height to zero.</p>
<p>So the computer just took the plane into the Alps.</p>
<p>Now, I mean, that was such a tragedy</p>
<p>that obviously the guy was mentally ill,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t just a tragedy for him,</p>
<p>it was for all the people on board.</p>
<p>But what if, and I was inspired by this</p>
<p>and my thinking, what can I do to anticipate</p>
<p>problems like this in the computer?</p>
<p>Had the software,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure Boeing and Airbus will be thinking,</p>
<p>oh, maybe I can give the computer</p>
<p>a bit more situational awareness.</p>
<p>So whenever one tries to drop the height of the plane</p>
<p>and it knows it&rsquo;s above the Alps,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just say, oh no, computer says no,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not letting you do that.</p>
<p>Of course, he would have been able to find another way,</p>
<p>maybe fly it until it runs out of fuel or something,</p>
<p>but you know.</p>
<p>Keep anticipating all the large number of trajectories</p>
<p>that can go negative,</p>
<p>all those kinds of running into the Alps</p>
<p>and try to at least make it easy</p>
<p>for the engineers to build systems that are protecting us.</p>
<p>Yeah, and let&rsquo;s just think,</p>
<p>what in the computer world right now with Kydeals,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just not think about what I&rsquo;m doing right now.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m doing right now is it&rsquo;s completely open, right?</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s gonna know Kydeals and be playing with them,</p>
<p>making them more easier and easier and easier.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re gonna start to do,</p>
<p>it makes sense to encrypt the Kydeals in such a way,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you work for a pharmaceutical company</p>
<p>and you have a license to make given molecule,</p>
<p>well, you get issued with a license</p>
<p>by the FDA or your local authority</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll say, right, your license to do it,</p>
<p>here it is, it&rsquo;s encrypted and the Kydeal gets run.</p>
<p>So you have a license for that instance of use, easy to do.</p>
<p>Computer science has already solved the problem.</p>
<p>So the fact that we all trust online banking, right,</p>
<p>the right now, then we can secure it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 100% sure we can secure the computer.</p>
<p>And because of the way we have a many,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the same mapping problem that you,</p>
<p>to actually reverse engineer a Kydeal</p>
<p>will be as hard as reverse engineering the encryption key,</p>
<p>brute force, it will be cheaper</p>
<p>to just actually buy the regulated medicine.</p>
<p>And actually people aren&rsquo;t gonna want to then</p>
<p>make their own fake pharmaceuticals</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll be so cheap to do it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll drop the cost of access to drugs.</p>
<p>Now what will happen?</p>
<p>Recreational drugs.</p>
<p>People will start saying,</p>
<p>well, I want access to recreational drugs.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s gonna be up to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna accelerate that social discussion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in the US and Canada and UK,</p>
<p>everywhere, right?</p>
<p>Because cost goes down, access goes up.</p>
<p>Giving cannabis THC to some people who&rsquo;ve got epilepsy</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t literally, forgive the term, a no brainer</p>
<p>because these poor people go from seizures like every day</p>
<p>to maybe seizures just once every few months.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting idea to try to minimize the chance</p>
<p>that it can get into like the hands of individuals</p>
<p>like terrorists or people that want to do harm.</p>
<p>Now with that kind of thing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting a lot of power in the hands of governments,</p>
<p>in the hands of institutions.</p>
<p>And so then emerge the kind of natural criticism</p>
<p>you might have of governments that can sometimes use these</p>
<p>for ill, use them as weapons of war,</p>
<p>not tools of betterment.</p>
<p>So, and sometimes not just war against other nations,</p>
<p>but war against its own people</p>
<p>as it has been done throughout history.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m thinking, so there&rsquo;s another way of doing it,</p>
<p>a decentralized peer to peer version</p>
<p>where, and what you have to do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying you should adopt a blockchain,</p>
<p>but there is a way of maybe taking Kydeals</p>
<p>and put them in blockchain.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea, let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>the way we&rsquo;re doing it in my lab right now</p>
<p>is we go to the literature,</p>
<p>we take a recipe to make a molecule,</p>
<p>convert that to Kydeal and diligently make it in the robot</p>
<p>and validate it.</p>
<p>We, that, so we, I would call mining proof of work,</p>
<p>proof of synthesis, right?</p>
<p>Proof of the synthesis.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but this is cool because suddenly</p>
<p>when you actually synthesize it,</p>
<p>you can get the analytical data,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a fingerprint in there</p>
<p>of the impurities that get carried across</p>
<p>because you can never make one, something 100% pure.</p>
<p>That fingerprint will allow you to secure your Kydeal.</p>
<p>So what you do is encrypt those two things.</p>
<p>So suddenly you can have people out there mining</p>
<p>and what you could do perhaps is do the type of thing,</p>
<p>we need to basically look at the way that contact tracing</p>
<p>should have been done in COVID</p>
<p>where people are given the information.</p>
<p>So you have just been in contact with someone COVID,</p>
<p>you choose, I&rsquo;m not telling you to stay at home,</p>
<p>you choose, right?</p>
<p>So now if we could imagine a similar thing,</p>
<p>like, you know, you have got access to these chemicals,</p>
<p>they will have these effects,</p>
<p>you choose and publicize it,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s out somewhere, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a policymaker on this.</p>
<p>And what my job here is</p>
<p>to not just make the technology possible,</p>
<p>but to have as open as a discussion as possible</p>
<p>with people to say, hey,</p>
<p>can we stop childhood mortality with this technology?</p>
<p>And do those benefits outweigh the one off</p>
<p>where people might use it for terrorism</p>
<p>or people might use it for recreational drugs?</p>
<p>Chemify, which is the name of the entity</p>
<p>that will make this happen,</p>
<p>I think we have some social responsibilities as an entity</p>
<p>to make sure that we&rsquo;re not enabling people</p>
<p>to manufacture personal drugs, weapons at will.</p>
<p>And what we have to do is have a discussion with society,</p>
<p>with the people that invest in this,</p>
<p>with people that are gonna pay for this,</p>
<p>to say, well, do you wanna live longer?</p>
<p>And do you wanna be healthier?</p>
<p>And are you willing to accept some of the risks?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a discussion to have.</p>
<p>So by the way, when you say personal drugs,</p>
<p>do you mean the illegal ones?</p>
<p>Or do you have a concern of just putting the manufacturer</p>
<p>of any kind of illegal drugs</p>
<p>in the hands of regular people?</p>
<p>Cause they might, like dose matters.</p>
<p>They might take way too much.</p>
<p>I mean, I would say, to be honest,</p>
<p>the chances of computers being,</p>
<p>well, shouldn&rsquo;t always never.</p>
<p>So the fact I can now say this means</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally gonna come true, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine that computers will be</p>
<p>in people&rsquo;s houses anytime soon,</p>
<p>but they might be at the local pharmacy, right?</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve got a drug manufacturing facility</p>
<p>in every town, then you just go</p>
<p>and they give you a prescription.</p>
<p>They do it in such a way, they format it</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t have to take 10 pills every day.</p>
<p>You get one manufactured for you</p>
<p>that has all the materials you need</p>
<p>and the right distribution.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>But you mentioned recreational drugs.</p>
<p>And the reason I mention it,</p>
<p>cause I know people are going to speak up on this.</p>
<p>If the drug is legal, there&rsquo;s to me,</p>
<p>no reason why you can&rsquo;t manufacture it for recreation.</p>
<p>I mean, you can do it right now.</p>
<p>What do you have against fun, Lee?</p>
<p>I have, so I mean, I&rsquo;m a chemistry professor</p>
<p>in a university who&rsquo;s an entrepreneur as well.</p>
<p>I just think I need to be as responsible</p>
<p>as I can in the discussion.</p>
<p>Sure, no, sure, sure.</p>
<p>But I know, so let me be the one that says</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s nothing, cause you have said</p>
<p>recreational drugs and like terrorism in the same sentence.</p>
<p>I think let&rsquo;s make sure we draw a line</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s real dangers to the world</p>
<p>of terrorists of bio warfare.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a little bit of weed.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s up to the society</p>
<p>to tell his governments what it wants,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s acceptable, right?</p>
<p>And if it becomes, let&rsquo;s say that THCs</p>
<p>become heavily acceptable and that you can modify them.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s like blood type.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a particular type of THC</p>
<p>that you tolerate better than I do.</p>
<p>Then why not have a machine that makes the one you like?</p>
<p>And then, and why not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the perfect brownie.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m, we&rsquo;re so far away from that.</p>
<p>I can barely get the thing to work in the lab, right?</p>
<p>And I mean, it&rsquo;s reliability and all this other stuff,</p>
<p>but what I think is gonna happen in the short term,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna turbocharge molecular discovery reliability</p>
<p>and that will change the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s super exciting.</p>
<p>You have a draft of a paper titled</p>
<p>Autonomous Intelligent Exploration,</p>
<p>Discovery and Optimization of Nanomaterials.</p>
<p>So we are talking about</p>
<p>automating engineering of nanomaterials.</p>
<p>How hard is this problem?</p>
<p>And as we continue down this thread of the positives</p>
<p>and the worrisome,</p>
<p>what are the things we should be excited about?</p>
<p>And what are the things we should be terrified about?</p>
<p>And how do we minimize the chance</p>
<p>of the terrifying consequences?</p>
<p>So in this robot, the robot does all the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>So the robot basically is an embodied AI.</p>
<p>I really like AI in a domain specific way.</p>
<p>One of the, as you should say at this point,</p>
<p>there was an attempt in the 60s,</p>
<p>Joshua Leidenberg and some really important people</p>
<p>did this that made an AI to try and guess</p>
<p>if organic molecules and the mass spectrometer</p>
<p>were alien or not.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And they failed because they didn&rsquo;t have assembly theory.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>And when I, and I, and that.</p>
<p>Wait, what does assembly theory</p>
<p>give you about alien versus human life?</p>
<p>Well, no, it just, it tells you about unknown,</p>
<p>the degree of unknowns.</p>
<p>You can fingerprint stuff.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t looking at,</p>
<p>they were trying to basically just look at the corpus</p>
<p>of complex organic molecules.</p>
<p>So when I was a bit down about assembly theory,</p>
<p>cause I couldn&rsquo;t convince referees</p>
<p>and couldn&rsquo;t convince computational people</p>
<p>interested in computational complexity,</p>
<p>I was really quite depressed about it.</p>
<p>And I mean, I&rsquo;ve been working with Sarah Walker&rsquo;s team</p>
<p>and I think she, you know,</p>
<p>I think she also invented an assembly theory somewhere.</p>
<p>We can talk about it later.</p>
<p>When I found the AI not working for the dendrial project,</p>
<p>I suddenly realized I wasn&rsquo;t totally insane.</p>
<p>Coming back to this nano robot.</p>
<p>So what it does is it basically, like a computer,</p>
<p>but now what it does is it squirts a liquid</p>
<p>with gold in it in a test tube</p>
<p>and it adds some reducing agents,</p>
<p>so some electrons to make the gold</p>
<p>turn into a nanoparticle.</p>
<p>Now, when gold becomes a nanoparticle,</p>
<p>it gets a characteristic color, a plasmon.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit like if you look at the sheen</p>
<p>on the gold wedding ring or gold bar or something,</p>
<p>those are the ways that conducting electrons</p>
<p>basically reflect light.</p>
<p>What we did is we randomly squirt the gold,</p>
<p>the gold particle and the reducing agent</p>
<p>and then we measure the UV, we measure the color.</p>
<p>And so what we do is we&rsquo;ve got, the robot has a mind.</p>
<p>So it has a mind where in a simulation,</p>
<p>it randomly generates nanoparticles and the plasmon,</p>
<p>the color that comes out, randomly imagines in its head.</p>
<p>It then with the others,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the imaginary side of the robot.</p>
<p>In the physical side of the robot,</p>
<p>it squirts in the chemicals and looks at the color</p>
<p>and it uses a genetic algorithm</p>
<p>and a map elite actually on it.</p>
<p>And it goes around in cycles and refines</p>
<p>the color to the objective.</p>
<p>Now we use two different points.</p>
<p>We have an exploration and an optimization.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re two different.</p>
<p>So the exploration just says, just do random stuff</p>
<p>and see how many different things you can get.</p>
<p>And when you get different things,</p>
<p>try and optimize and make the peak sharper, sharper, sharper.</p>
<p>And what it does after a number of cycles</p>
<p>is it physically takes a sample</p>
<p>of the optimized nanomaterial,</p>
<p>resets all of the round bottom flasks, cleans them</p>
<p>and puts the seed, physical seed back in.</p>
<p>And then what this robot is able to do</p>
<p>is search a space of 10 to the 23 possible reactions</p>
<p>in just a thousand experiments in three days.</p>
<p>And it makes five generations of nanoparticles</p>
<p>which get nicer and nicer in terms of shape</p>
<p>and color and definition.</p>
<p>And then at the end, it outputs a Kydl code.</p>
<p>That could then be.</p>
<p>Wow, it&rsquo;s doing the search for programs</p>
<p>in the physical space.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s doing a kind of reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, in the physical space.</p>
<p>With the exploration and the optimization.</p>
<p>And that Kydl will work on any computer</p>
<p>or any qualified hardware.</p>
<p>So now that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s now that&rsquo;s a general piece of code</p>
<p>that can replicate somewhat maybe perfectly</p>
<p>what it created.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>But the nanoparticles themselves are done.</p>
<p>The robot has all the thinking.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t try and imply any self replication</p>
<p>or try and get the particles to make themselves.</p>
<p>Although it would be cool to try.</p>
<p>So, well, there you go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, those are famous last words</p>
<p>for the end of human civilization.</p>
<p>Would be cool to try.</p>
<p>So is it possible to create molecules</p>
<p>that start approaching this question</p>
<p>that we started this conversation,</p>
<p>which is the origin of life.</p>
<p>To start to create molecules that have lifelike qualities.</p>
<p>So have the replication, have like complex,</p>
<p>start to create complex organisms.</p>
<p>So we have done this with the oxides.</p>
<p>I talked about earlier with the moxides</p>
<p>and the rings and the bulls.</p>
<p>And the problem is that, well, they do,</p>
<p>they auto catalytically enhance one another.</p>
<p>So they would, I guess you would call it self replication.</p>
<p>But because there&rsquo;s limited function and mutation,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty dumb.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t do very much.</p>
<p>So I think the prospect of us being able to engineer</p>
<p>a nano material life form in the short term,</p>
<p>like I said earlier,</p>
<p>my aim is to do this, of course.</p>
<p>I mean, on one hand, I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;m saying I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>
<p>So which is it, Lee?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I think we can do it,</p>
<p>but only in the robot.</p>
<p>So the causal chain that&rsquo;s gonna allow it is in the robot.</p>
<p>These particles, if they do start to self replicate,</p>
<p>the system&rsquo;s gonna be so fragile</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think anything dangerous will come out.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t treat them</p>
<p>as potentially, I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to scare people</p>
<p>like gain of function.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna produce stuff that comes out.</p>
<p>Our number one kill switch is that we always try</p>
<p>to search a space of objects</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t exist in the environment.</p>
<p>So even if something got out, it just would die immediately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like making a silicon life form or something.</p>
<p>Which is the opposite of oftentimes</p>
<p>gain of function research is focused on</p>
<p>how do you get a dangerous thing</p>
<p>to be closer to something that works with humans?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To have it jump to humans.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the one good mode to operate on</p>
<p>is always try to operate on chemical entities</p>
<p>that are very different than the kind of chemical environment</p>
<p>that humans operate in.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also, I mean, I&rsquo;ll say something dramatic,</p>
<p>which may not be true.</p>
<p>So I should be careful.</p>
<p>If let&rsquo;s say we did discover a new living system</p>
<p>but it was made out of a shadow biosphere</p>
<p>and we just released it in the environment,</p>
<p>who cares?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna use different stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;ll just live.</p>
<p>Just live, yeah.</p>
<p>I found one of my biggest fantasies</p>
<p>is actually is like a planet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically half in the sun,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t rotate, right?</p>
<p>And you have two different origins of life on that planet</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t share the same chemistry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then the only way time they recognize each other</p>
<p>is when they become intelligent, they go,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s that moving?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they co evolve and that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, so one fascinating thing to do</p>
<p>is exactly what you were saying, which is a life bomb,</p>
<p>which is like try to focus on atmospheres</p>
<p>or chemical conditions of other planets</p>
<p>and try within this kind of exploration optimization system</p>
<p>try to discover life forms that can work in those conditions</p>
<p>and then you send those life forms over there</p>
<p>and see what kind of stuff they build up.</p>
<p>Like you can do like a large scale,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a safe physical environment</p>
<p>to do large scale experiments, it&rsquo;s another planet.</p>
<p>Yeah, so look, I&rsquo;m gonna say something quite contentious.</p>
<p>I mean, Elon wants to go to Mars,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s brilliant wants to go to Mars,</p>
<p>but I would counter that and say,</p>
<p>is Elon just obsessed with getting humanity?</p>
<p>Or Earth, or what about just technology?</p>
<p>So if we do technology, so Elon either needs</p>
<p>to take a computer to Mars</p>
<p>because he needs to manufacture drugs on demand,</p>
<p>because zero cost payload and all that stuff is just code.</p>
<p>Or what we do is we actually say, hang on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite hard for humans to survive on Mars.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we write a series of origin of life algorithms</p>
<p>where we embed our culture in it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very Ridley spot Prometheus,</p>
<p>which is a terrible film by the way, but anyway.</p>
<p>And dump it on Mars and just terraform Mars.</p>
<p>And what we do is we evolve life on Mars</p>
<p>that is suited to life on Mars,</p>
<p>rather than brute forcing human life on Mars.</p>
<p>So one of the questions is, what is human culture?</p>
<p>What are the things you encode?</p>
<p>Some of it is knowledge, some of it is information.</p>
<p>But the thing that Elon talks about,</p>
<p>the thing I think about, I think you think about as well</p>
<p>is some of the more unique aspects of what makes us human,</p>
<p>which is our particular kind of consciousness.</p>
<p>So he talks about the flame of human consciousness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the questions is,</p>
<p>can we instill consciousness into other beings?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s a sad thought that whatever this thing</p>
<p>inside our minds, that hopes and dreams and fears</p>
<p>and loves can all die.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think you already know</p>
<p>the answer to that question.</p>
<p>I have a robot lawnmower at home.</p>
<p>My kids call it CC, cool car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a robo mower.</p>
<p>And the way it works, it has an electric field</p>
<p>around the perimeter and it just tell it the area.</p>
<p>And it goes out and goes from its base station,</p>
<p>just mows a bit.</p>
<p>Gets to the perimeter, detects perimeter,</p>
<p>then chooses a random angle, rotates around and goes on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My kids call it cool cutter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a she.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s a she.</p>
<p>They just, when they were like quite young,</p>
<p>they called it, I don&rsquo;t want to be sexist there.</p>
<p>It could be a he, but they liked.</p>
<p>They gendered the lawnmower?</p>
<p>They gendered the lawnmower.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, why not?</p>
<p>But I was thinking this lawnmower,</p>
<p>if you apply integrated information theory to lawnmower,</p>
<p>the lawnmower is conscious.</p>
<p>Now, integrated information theory is,</p>
<p>people say it&rsquo;s a flawed way of measuring consciousness,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it is.</p>
<p>I think assembly theory actually measures consciousness</p>
<p>in the same way.</p>
<p>Consciousness is something that is generated</p>
<p>over a population of objects, of humans.</p>
<p>Consciousness didn&rsquo;t suddenly spring in.</p>
<p>Our consciousness has evolved together, right?</p>
<p>The fact we&rsquo;re here and the robots we leave behind,</p>
<p>they will have some of that.</p>
<p>So we won&rsquo;t lose it all.</p>
<p>Sure, consciousness requires</p>
<p>that we have many models being generated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just one domain specific AI, right?</p>
<p>I think the way to create consciousness,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say unashamedly,</p>
<p>the best way to make a consciousness is in a chemical system</p>
<p>because you just have access to many more states.</p>
<p>And the problem right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re making silicon consciousness</p>
<p>because you just don&rsquo;t have enough states.</p>
<p>So there are more possible states,</p>
<p>or sorry, there are more possible configurations possible</p>
<p>in your brain than there are atoms in the universe.</p>
<p>And you can switch between them.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that on a core I10.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got 10 billion, 12 billion, 14 billion transistors,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t reconfigure them as dynamically.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve shared this intuition a few times already</p>
<p>that the larger number of states</p>
<p>somehow correlates to greater possibility of life,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also possible the constraints are essential here.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, but coming back to the,</p>
<p>you worry that something&rsquo;s lost.</p>
<p>I agree, but I think that we will get to an AGI,</p>
<p>but I wonder if it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t be separate from human,</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t be separate from human consciousness</p>
<p>because the causal chain that produced it came from humans.</p>
<p>So what I kind of try and suggest heavily</p>
<p>to people worry about the existential threat of AI saying,</p>
<p>I mean, you put it much more elegantly earlier,</p>
<p>like we should worry about algorithms on, dumb algorithms</p>
<p>written by human beings on Twitter driving us insane, right?</p>
<p>And doing acting in odd ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think intelligence,</p>
<p>this is what I have been in eloquent</p>
<p>in trying to describe it partially</p>
<p>because I try not to think too deeply through this stuff</p>
<p>because then you become a philosopher.</p>
<p>I still aspire to actually building a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>But my sense is super intelligence leads</p>
<p>to deep integration to human society.</p>
<p>So like intelligence is strongly correlated.</p>
<p>Like intelligence, the way we conceive of intelligence</p>
<p>materializes as a thing that becomes a fun entity</p>
<p>to have at a party and with humans.</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s a mix of wit, intelligence, humor,</p>
<p>like intelligence, like knowledge,</p>
<p>ability to do reasoning and so on,</p>
<p>but also humor, emotional intelligence,</p>
<p>ability to love, to dream, to share those dreams,</p>
<p>to play the game of human civilization,</p>
<p>the push and pull, the whole dance of it,</p>
<p>the whole dance of life.</p>
<p>And I think that kind of super intelligent being</p>
<p>is not the thing that worries me.</p>
<p>I think that ultimately will enrich life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s again, the dumb algorithms,</p>
<p>the dumb algorithms that scale in the hands of people</p>
<p>that are too, don&rsquo;t study history,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t study human psychology and human nature,</p>
<p>just applying too broadly for selfish near term interests.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest danger.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s not a new danger, right?</p>
<p>I now know how I should use Twitter</p>
<p>and how I shouldn&rsquo;t use Twitter, right?</p>
<p>I like to provoke people into thinking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to provoke people into outrage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good thing for humans to do, right?</p>
<p>And I think that when you get people into outrage,</p>
<p>they take sides and taking sides is really bad.</p>
<p>But I think that we&rsquo;re all beginning to see this.</p>
<p>And I think that actually I&rsquo;m very optimistic</p>
<p>about how things will evolve because, you know,</p>
<p>I wonder how much productivity has Twitter</p>
<p>and social media taken out of humanity?</p>
<p>Because how many now, I mean,</p>
<p>so the good thing about Twitter is it gives power,</p>
<p>so it gives voice to minorities, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s good to some degree.</p>
<p>But I wonder how much voice does it give</p>
<p>to all sorts of other problems</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t need this emerge?</p>
<p>By the way, when you say minorities,</p>
<p>I think, or at least if I were to agree with you,</p>
<p>what I would say is minorities broadly defined</p>
<p>in these small groups of people that it magnifies</p>
<p>the concerns of the small versus the big.</p>
<p>That is good to some degree.</p>
<p>But I think, I mean, I have to be careful</p>
<p>because I think I have a very,</p>
<p>I mean, I think that the world isn&rsquo;t that broken, right?</p>
<p>I think the world is pretty cool place.</p>
<p>I think academia is really great.</p>
<p>I think climate change presents</p>
<p>a really interesting problem for humanity</p>
<p>that we will solve.</p>
<p>I like how you said it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty cool problem for civilization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a bunch of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of really, really big problems</p>
<p>that if solved can significantly improve</p>
<p>the quality of life or learn.</p>
<p>That ultimately is what we&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>improve how awesome life is</p>
<p>for the maximum number of people.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that the coming back to consciousness,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the universe is doomed to heat death, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the optimists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I want to kind of nudge you</p>
<p>into thinking that time is fundamental</p>
<p>because if time is fundamental,</p>
<p>then suddenly you don&rsquo;t have to give it back.</p>
<p>The universe just constructs stuff.</p>
<p>And what we see around us in our construction,</p>
<p>I know everyone&rsquo;s worried about how fragile civilization is.</p>
<p>And I mean, look at the fundamentals.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good until the sun expands, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got quite a lot of resource on earth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to be quite cooperative.</p>
<p>Humans are nice to each other</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re not under enormous stress.</p>
<p>But coming back to the consciousness thing,</p>
<p>are we going to send human beings to Mars</p>
<p>or conscious robots to Mars?</p>
<p>Or are we gonna send some hybrid?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question right now.</p>
<p>I guess, you know,</p>
<p>Elon is gonna have a pretty good go at getting there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure whether,</p>
<p>I have my doubts, but I&rsquo;m not qualified.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure people have their doubts that computation works,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve got it working.</p>
<p>And I, you know.</p>
<p>And most of the cool technologies we have today</p>
<p>and take for granted,</p>
<p>like the airplane, a aforementioned airplane,</p>
<p>were things that people doubted.</p>
<p>Like majority of people doubted</p>
<p>before they came to life and they come to life.</p>
<p>And speaking of hybrid AI and humans,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating to think about all the different ways</p>
<p>that hybridization, that merger can happen.</p>
<p>I mean, we have, currently have the smartphone,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s already a hybrid,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s all kinds of ways that hybrid happens.</p>
<p>How we and other technology play together,</p>
<p>like a computer, how that changes</p>
<p>the fabric of human civilization is like wide open.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>If you remove,</p>
<p>if you remove cancer,</p>
<p>if you remove major diseases from humanity,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a bunch of consequences</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not anticipating.</p>
<p>Many of them positive, but many of them negative.</p>
<p>Many of them, most of them, at least I hope,</p>
<p>are weird and wonderful and fun</p>
<p>in ways that are totally unexpected.</p>
<p>And we sitting on a porch with a bottle of Jack Daniels</p>
<p>and a rocker will say,</p>
<p>kids these days don&rsquo;t appreciate</p>
<p>how hard we had it back in the day.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you, speaking of nudging,</p>
<p>you and Joscha Bach nudge each other on Twitter quite a bit</p>
<p>in wonderful intellectual debates.</p>
<p>And of course, for people who don&rsquo;t know Joscha Bach,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s this brilliant guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on the podcast a couple times.</p>
<p>You tweeted, or he tweeted,</p>
<p>Joscha Bach, everyone should follow him as well.</p>
<p>You should definitely follow Mr. Lee Cronin, Dr. Lee Cronin.</p>
<p>He tweeted, dinner with Lee Cronin.</p>
<p>We discussed that while we can translate</p>
<p>every working model of existence into a Turing machine,</p>
<p>the structure of the universe might be given</p>
<p>by weeks of nonexistence in a pattern generated</p>
<p>by all possible automata, which exist by default.</p>
<p>And then he followed on saying face to face is the best.</p>
<p>So the dinner was face to face.</p>
<p>What is Joscha talking about in weeks, quote,</p>
<p>weeks of nonexistence in a pattern generated</p>
<p>by all possible automata, which exist by default.</p>
<p>So automata exist by default, apparently.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s weeks of nonexistence.</p>
<p>What the hell is nonexistence in the universe?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, and also in another conversation,</p>
<p>you tweeted it&rsquo;s state machines all the way down,</p>
<p>which presumably is the origin story of this discussion.</p>
<p>And then Joscha said, again, nudging, nudging,</p>
<p>nudging slash trolling, Joscha said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen the light, welcome friend.</p>
<p>Many foundational physicists effectively believe</p>
<p>in some form of hyper computation.</p>
<p>Lee is coming around to this idea.</p>
<p>And then you said, I think there are notable differences.</p>
<p>First, I think the universe does not have to be a computer.</p>
<p>Second, I want to understand how the universe emerges,</p>
<p>constructors that build computers.</p>
<p>And third is that there is something below church touring.</p>
<p>Okay, what the heck is this dinner conversation about?</p>
<p>Maybe put another way, maybe zooming out a little bit.</p>
<p>Are there interesting agreements or disagreements</p>
<p>between you and Joscha Bach that can elucidate</p>
<p>some of the other topics we&rsquo;ve been talking about?</p>
<p>Yeah, so Jascha has an incredible mind</p>
<p>and he has, he&rsquo;s so well read</p>
<p>and uses language really elegantly.</p>
<p>It bamboozles me at times.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m, so often I&rsquo;m using, I&rsquo;m describing concepts</p>
<p>in a way that I built from the ground up.</p>
<p>And so we misunderstand each other a lot.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s floating in the clouds, is that what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Something like, not quite, but I think,</p>
<p>so this concept of a Turing machine.</p>
<p>So a Turing machine, Turing machines, I would argue,</p>
<p>and I think this is not, the Turing machine,</p>
<p>the universe is not a Turing machine.</p>
<p>Biology is not even a Turing machine, right?</p>
<p>And because Turing machines don&rsquo;t evolve, right?</p>
<p>There is this problem</p>
<p>that people see Turing machines everywhere,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t it interesting the universe gave rise to biology</p>
<p>that gave rise to intelligence,</p>
<p>that gave rise to Alan Turing,</p>
<p>who invented the abstraction of the Turing machine</p>
<p>and allowed us to digitize.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been looking for the mystery</p>
<p>at the origin of life, the origin of intelligence</p>
<p>and the origin of this.</p>
<p>And I, when I discussed with Yasha,</p>
<p>I think Yasha, he was saying, well, the universe,</p>
<p>of course the universe is a Turing machine.</p>
<p>Of course there&rsquo;s a hyper computer there.</p>
<p>And I think we got kind of trapped in our words and terms</p>
<p>because of course it&rsquo;s possible for a Turing machine</p>
<p>or computers to exist in the universe.</p>
<p>We have them.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m trying to understand is</p>
<p>where did the transition of continuous discrete occur?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been, and this is because of my general foolishness</p>
<p>of understanding the continuous.</p>
<p>But I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is</p>
<p>there were constructors before there were abstractors</p>
<p>because how did the universe abstract itself into existence?</p>
<p>And it goes back to earlier saying,</p>
<p>could the universe of intelligence have come first?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a constructor, what&rsquo;s an abstractor?</p>
<p>So the abstractor is the ability of say,</p>
<p>of Alan Turing and G√∂del and Church</p>
<p>to think about the mathematical universe and to label things.</p>
<p>And then from those labels to come up with a set of axioms</p>
<p>with those labels and to basically understand</p>
<p>the universe mathematically and say, okay,</p>
<p>I can label things.</p>
<p>Where did the labeler come from?</p>
<p>Where is the prime labeler?</p>
<p>Even if the universe is not a Turing computer,</p>
<p>does that negate the possibility</p>
<p>that a Turing computer can simulate the universe?</p>
<p>Just because the abstraction was formed at a later time,</p>
<p>does that mean that abstraction,</p>
<p>this is to our cellular automata conversation.</p>
<p>You were taking away some of the magic</p>
<p>from the cellular automata because very intelligent</p>
<p>biological systems came up with that cellular automata.</p>
<p>Well, this is where the existence is the default, right?</p>
<p>Is it, does the fact that we exist</p>
<p>and we can come up with a Turing machine,</p>
<p>does that mean the universe has to be</p>
<p>a Turing machine as well?</p>
<p>But can it be a Turing machine though?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, so the has to be and the can it be.</p>
<p>Can it be?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>if it has to be or not, can it be?</p>
<p>But can the universe have Turing machines in it?</p>
<p>Sure, they exist now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering though, maybe,</p>
<p>and this is where things get really hairy,</p>
<p>is I think the universe maybe in the past</p>
<p>did not have the computational power that it has now.</p>
<p>This is almost like a law of physics kind of,</p>
<p>so the computational power is not,</p>
<p>you can get some free lunch.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the fact that we now,</p>
<p>we sit here in this period in time</p>
<p>and we can imagine all these robots</p>
<p>and all these machines and we built them.</p>
<p>And so we can easily imagine going back in time</p>
<p>that the universe was capable of having them,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it can.</p>
<p>So the universe may have been a lot dumber computationally.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go back to the time discussion,</p>
<p>but I think it has some relationship with it.</p>
<p>The universe is basically smarter now than it used to be</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to continue getting smarter over time</p>
<p>because of novelty, generation,</p>
<p>and the ability to create objects</p>
<p>within objects within objects.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a, perhaps it&rsquo;s grounded in physics,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this intuition of conservation.</p>
<p>Yeah. That stuff is conserved.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;ve always had all,</p>
<p>everything, you&rsquo;re just rearranging books</p>
<p>on the bookshelf through time.</p>
<p>So, okay. But you&rsquo;re saying like</p>
<p>new books are being written.</p>
<p>Which laws do you want to break?</p>
<p>At the origin of the big bang,</p>
<p>you had to break the second law</p>
<p>because we got order for free.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, what I&rsquo;m telling you now</p>
<p>is that the energy isn&rsquo;t conserved in the universe.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s the second law. Okay. I got you.</p>
<p>So because, but not in a mad way.</p>
<p>Okay. So computation potentially is not conserved,</p>
<p>which is a fascinating idea.</p>
<p>Intelligence is not conserved.</p>
<p>Complexity is not conserved.</p>
<p>I suppose that&rsquo;s deeply connected</p>
<p>to time being fundamental.</p>
<p>The natural consequence of that</p>
<p>is if time is fundamental</p>
<p>and the universe is inflating in time, if you like,</p>
<p>then there are one or two conservation laws</p>
<p>that we need to have a look at.</p>
<p>And I wonder if that means the total energy</p>
<p>of the universe is actually increasing over time.</p>
<p>And this may be completely ludicrous,</p>
<p>but we do have all this dark energy.</p>
<p>We have some anomalies, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>dark matter and dark energy.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t add them in,</p>
<p>galaxies, so dark matter, I think doesn&rsquo;t hold.</p>
<p>You need to hold the galaxies together</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some other observational issues.</p>
<p>Could dark energy just be time?</p>
<p>So figuring out what dark energy is</p>
<p>might give us some deep clues</p>
<p>about this, not just time, but the consequences of time.</p>
<p>So it could be that, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s perpetual motions allowed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s free lunch, but I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>if the universe is intrinsically asymmetric</p>
<p>and it appears to be, and it&rsquo;s generating novelty</p>
<p>and it appears to, couldn&rsquo;t that just be mechanistically</p>
<p>how reality works?</p>
<p>And therefore I don&rsquo;t really like this idea that the,</p>
<p>so I want to live in a deterministic universe</p>
<p>that is undetermined, right?</p>
<p>The only way I can do that is if time is fundamental.</p>
<p>Because otherwise it&rsquo;s all the rest of us,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just sleight of hand because the physicists will say,</p>
<p>yes, everything&rsquo;s deterministic.</p>
<p>Newtonian mechanics is deterministic.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics is deterministic.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the Everettian view.</p>
<p>And then basically we can just draw out</p>
<p>this massive universe branching, but it closes again</p>
<p>and we get it all back.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t worry, your feeling of free will is effective.</p>
<p>But what the physicists are actually saying</p>
<p>is the entire future is mapped out.</p>
<p>And that is clearly problematical.</p>
<p>And clearly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not so clear.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just problematic.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, yeah, so it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Because that maybe is just the way it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s problematic to you, a particular creature</p>
<p>along this timeline.</p>
<p>I want to reduce the number of beliefs</p>
<p>I need to understand the universe.</p>
<p>So if time is fundamental, I don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to have magic order at the beginning,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t need a second law.</p>
<p>But you do need the magical belief</p>
<p>that time is fundamental.</p>
<p>Well, I need the observation that I&rsquo;m seeing</p>
<p>to be just how it is all the way down.</p>
<p>But the Earth also looks flat</p>
<p>if you agree with your observation.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t necessarily trust our observation.</p>
<p>I know the Earth isn&rsquo;t flat</p>
<p>because I can send a satellite into space.</p>
<p>No, but now you see, now you&rsquo;re using the tools</p>
<p>of science and the technology of science.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying I&rsquo;m going to do experiments</p>
<p>that start to show.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that it&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>So if you can&rsquo;t, so if I cannot do an experiment</p>
<p>or a thought experiment that will test this assumption,</p>
<p>then the assumption is without merit really in the end.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful ideal you hold yourself to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s given that you think deeply in a philosophical way,</p>
<p>you think about some of these really important issues</p>
<p>and you have theoretical frameworks like assembly theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really nice that you&rsquo;re always grounded</p>
<p>with experiment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I have.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so refreshing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so beautifully refreshing.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;re holding you to the grounded</p>
<p>in an experiment to the harsh truth of reality,</p>
<p>let me ask the big ridiculous question.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>This time is fundamental.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s marching forward.</p>
<p>And along this long timeline come along a bunch</p>
<p>of descendants of apes that have come up</p>
<p>with cellular automata and computers and now computers.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I have so many different answers to this question.</p>
<p>It depends on what day.</p>
<p>I would say that given the way of the conversation</p>
<p>we had today, I&rsquo;d say the meaning,</p>
<p>well, we make our own meaning.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But I think the universe wants to explore</p>
<p>every possible configuration that it&rsquo;s allowed us</p>
<p>to explore.</p>
<p>And this goes back to the kind of question</p>
<p>that you were asking about Yasha and the existence</p>
<p>and non existence of things, right?</p>
<p>So if the universe is a Turing machine is churning</p>
<p>through a lot of states and you think about</p>
<p>combinatorial theory before assembly theory,</p>
<p>so everything is possible.</p>
<p>What Yasha and I were saying is, well,</p>
<p>not everything is possible.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t see the combinatorial explosion.</p>
<p>We see something else.</p>
<p>And what we see is evidence of memory.</p>
<p>So there clearly seems to be some interference</p>
<p>between the combinatorial explosion of things</p>
<p>and what the universe allows.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like this kind of constructive,</p>
<p>destructive interference.</p>
<p>So maybe the universe is not just about,</p>
<p>it is assembling objects in space and time.</p>
<p>And those objects are able to search more space and time.</p>
<p>And the universe is just infinitely creative.</p>
<p>And I guess I&rsquo;m searching for why the universe</p>
<p>is infinitely creative.</p>
<p>It is infinitely creative.</p>
<p>And maybe the meaning is just simply to make</p>
<p>as many objects, create as many things as possible.</p>
<p>And I see a future of the universe that doesn&rsquo;t result</p>
<p>in the heat death of the universe.</p>
<p>The universe is gonna extract every ounce</p>
<p>of creativity it can out of it,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what we see on Earth, right?</p>
<p>And if you think that almost like intelligence</p>
<p>is not conserved, that maybe creativity isn&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>Maybe like it&rsquo;s an infinite well.</p>
<p>So like creativity is ultimately tied to novelty.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re coming up with cool new configurations of things,</p>
<p>and maybe that just can continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>And this human species that was created along the way</p>
<p>is probably just one method,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s able to ask the universe about itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one way to explore creativity.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s other meta levels on top of that.</p>
<p>Like obviously, as a collective intelligence</p>
<p>will create organisms, maybe there&rsquo;ll be organisms</p>
<p>that ask themselves questions about themselves</p>
<p>in a deeper, bigger picture way than we humans do.</p>
<p>First to ask questions about the humans,</p>
<p>and then construct some kind of hybrid systems</p>
<p>that ask themselves about the collective aspect.</p>
<p>Just like some weird stacking</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t even imagine yet.</p>
<p>And that stacking, I mean, I have discussed this stacking</p>
<p>a lot with Sarah Walker, who&rsquo;s a professor of physics</p>
<p>and astrobiology at ASU.</p>
<p>And we argue about how creative the universe is gonna be,</p>
<p>and is it as deterministic as all that?</p>
<p>Because I think she&rsquo;s more of a free will thinker,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m of a less free will thinker,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;re beginning to converge</p>
<p>and understanding that.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s simply a missing understanding.</p>
<p>Right now, we don&rsquo;t understand how the universe,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what rules the universe has</p>
<p>to allow the universe to contemplate itself.</p>
<p>So asking the meaning of it</p>
<p>before we even know what those rules are</p>
<p>is premature, but my guess is that it&rsquo;s not meaningless,</p>
<p>and it isn&rsquo;t just about that.</p>
<p>And there are three levels of meanings.</p>
<p>Obviously, the universe wants us to do stuff.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re interacting with each other,</p>
<p>so we create meaning in our own society</p>
<p>and our own interactions with humanity.</p>
<p>But I do think there is something else going on.</p>
<p>But because reality is so weird,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just scratching at that.</p>
<p>And I think that we have to make the experiments better.</p>
<p>And we have to perhaps join across,</p>
<p>not just for the computation lists.</p>
<p>And what I tried to do with Yashua is meet him halfway,</p>
<p>say, well, what happens if I become a computation list?</p>
<p>What do I gain?</p>
<p>A lot, it turns out,</p>
<p>because I can make Turing machines in the universe.</p>
<p>Because on the one hand, I&rsquo;m making computers</p>
<p>which are state machines inspired by Turing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;m saying they can&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Well, clearly, I can&rsquo;t have my cake and eat it,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s something weird going on there.</p>
<p>So then, did the universe have to make a continuous</p>
<p>to a discrete transition, or is the universe just discrete?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably just discrete.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s just discrete, then there are,</p>
<p>I will then give Yashua his Turing like property</p>
<p>in the universe.</p>
<p>But maybe there&rsquo;s something else below it,</p>
<p>which is the constructor that constructs a Turing machine</p>
<p>that then constructs, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit like you generate a computing system</p>
<p>that then is able to build an abstraction</p>
<p>that then recognizes it can make a generalizable abstraction</p>
<p>because human beings with mathematics</p>
<p>have been able to go on and build physical computers.</p>
<p>If that makes any sense.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the meaning.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, you know, as far as we can,</p>
<p>the meaning will be further elucidated</p>
<p>with further experiments.</p>
<p>Well, you mentioned Sarah.</p>
<p>I think you and Sarah Walker</p>
<p>are just these fascinating human beings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really fortunate to have the opportunity</p>
<p>to be in your presence, to study your work,</p>
<p>to follow along with your work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan.</p>
<p>Like I told you offline,</p>
<p>I hope we get a chance to talk again</p>
<p>with perhaps just the two of us,</p>
<p>but also with Sarah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating dynamic for people who haven&rsquo;t heard.</p>
<p>I suppose on Clubhouse is where I heard you guys talk,</p>
<p>but you have an incredible dynamic.</p>
<p>And I also can&rsquo;t wait to hear you and Yashua talk.</p>
<p>So I think if there&rsquo;s some point in this predetermined</p>
<p>or yet to be determined future where the three of us,</p>
<p>you and Sarah, or the four of us with Yashua</p>
<p>could meet and talk would be a beautiful future.</p>
<p>And I look forward to most futures,</p>
<p>but I look forward to that one in particular.</p>
<p>Lee, thank you so much</p>
<p>for spending your valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a pleasure.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lee Cronin.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from the math scientist, Rick Sanchez</p>
<p>of Rick and Morty fame.</p>
<p>To live is to risk it all.</p>
<p>Otherwise you&rsquo;re just an inert chunk</p>
<p>of randomly assembled molecules</p>
<p>drifting wherever the universe blows you.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
