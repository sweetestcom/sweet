    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a topic that I&rsquo;ve covered before</p>
<p>on this podcast, and many people have heard of dopamine.</p>
<p>Most people know that dopamine is involved in pleasure,</p>
<p>to some extent or another.</p>
<p>And nowadays, people are starting to appreciate</p>
<p>that dopamine is also intimately involved</p>
<p>with motivation, drive, and pursuit.</p>
<p>Well, today, you&rsquo;re going to learn that indeed,</p>
<p>dopamine is responsible for all of those things,</p>
<p>but you are also going to learn that dopamine is critical</p>
<p>for overcoming procrastination,</p>
<p>for ensuring ongoing motivation,</p>
<p>and indeed, for ensuring confidence.</p>
<p>In fact, we are going to talk about the relationship</p>
<p>between dopamine and motivation and confidence</p>
<p>at the level of neurobiological circuitry,</p>
<p>and we are going to cover tools</p>
<p>that will allow you to leverage your dopamine</p>
<p>in order to have a maximum motivation</p>
<p>to overcome sticking points,</p>
<p>which include things like procrastination,</p>
<p>but also by understanding the neural circuits</p>
<p>in the brain and body that release and use dopamine,</p>
<p>but more importantly,</p>
<p>by understanding what are called dopamine dynamics.</p>
<p>That is, what gives rise to big peaks in dopamine</p>
<p>or troughs in dopamine,</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s referred to as our baseline level of dopamine,</p>
<p>which turns out to be our baseline levels of motivation</p>
<p>and feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>By understanding how those things relate to one another,</p>
<p>I assure you that by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will be in a far better position</p>
<p>to understand why you become amotivated,</p>
<p>why you procrastinate,</p>
<p>how to ensure motivation on an ongoing basis,</p>
<p>and even how to leverage effort</p>
<p>and the desire to become motivated</p>
<p>as a way to do just that, to become more motivated.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s discussion is not about psychology,</p>
<p>although I will center around practical everyday examples</p>
<p>and offer many, many tools</p>
<p>that you can implement if you choose.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s discussion is really about pulling apart</p>
<p>these things that we call motivation, reward,</p>
<p>pleasure, procrastination,</p>
<p>and understanding them in terms of their dopamine dynamics.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;ve heard me or others</p>
<p>talk about dopamine before,</p>
<p>or whether or not today is your first exposure</p>
<p>to the topic of dopamine,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s episode is really designed</p>
<p>to give you the biological and practical knowledge</p>
<p>so that you can leverage your dopamine circuitry</p>
<p>and your dopamine levels,</p>
<p>as well as tools to adjust dopamine circuitry and levels</p>
<p>in order to optimize mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.</p>
<p>Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows</p>
<p>that are the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this and other podcasts</p>
<p>about the critical role that sleep plays</p>
<p>in allowing you to be awake and alert</p>
<p>and have a good elevated mood throughout the day.</p>
<p>Sleep is just fundamental to our mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no replacing great sleep.</p>
<p>A key thing we all need in order to get excellent sleep</p>
<p>is to have an ideal sleep environment.</p>
<p>Helix mattresses are designed for your unique sleep needs</p>
<p>in order to ensure</p>
<p>that you get the best possible night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>So if you go to the Helix site</p>
<p>and you take their very brief two or three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>it will ask you questions such as,</p>
<p>do you sleep on your side, your back, or your stomach?</p>
<p>Do you tend to run hot or cold throughout the night?</p>
<p>And they will match you to a mattress</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s specific to your sleep needs.</p>
<p>I matched to the Dusk mattress.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one that works for me.</p>
<p>And since sleeping on the Dusk mattress</p>
<p>now for well over two years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sleeping better than I ever have before.</p>
<p>So if you go to their site, you take the quiz</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Whoop.</p>
<p>Whoop is a fitness wearable device</p>
<p>that tracks your daily activity and sleep,</p>
<p>but also goes beyond that by providing real-time feedback</p>
<p>on how to adjust your physical training and sleep schedule</p>
<p>and other activities throughout your day</p>
<p>in order to optimize your health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with Whoop</p>
<p>on their scientific advisory council</p>
<p>to help advance Whoop&rsquo;s technology and mission</p>
<p>of unlocking human performance,</p>
<p>not just for athletes, but for everybody.</p>
<p>As a Whoop user, I&rsquo;ve experienced the health benefits</p>
<p>of their technology firsthand.</p>
<p>For instance, it tells me, of course,</p>
<p>whether or not I had a good night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>or a poor night&rsquo;s sleep by giving me a sleep score.</p>
<p>It tells me the percentage of rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>to slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>But Whoop also tells me, for instance,</p>
<p>whether or not certain activities during my daytime,</p>
<p>such as naps or training</p>
<p>or training of a certain amount of intensity,</p>
<p>how that&rsquo;s impacting my sleep and vice versa.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Roka.</p>
<p>Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses</p>
<p>that are uniquely tailored to the needs of athletes</p>
<p>and everyday people.</p>
<p>The company was founded by two all-American swimmers</p>
<p>from Stanford, and everything about Roka eyeglasses</p>
<p>and sunglasses were designed with the biology,</p>
<p>the visual system in mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lifetime working on the biology,</p>
<p>the visual system, and I can tell you that</p>
<p>your visual system has to contend</p>
<p>with enormous number of challenges</p>
<p>in order for you to be able to see clearly.</p>
<p>Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed</p>
<p>such that when you go from one environment to the next,</p>
<p>like a brightly lit environment</p>
<p>to a less brightly lit environment,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t notice that transition.</p>
<p>You always see with perfect clarity.</p>
<p>Another terrific thing about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses</p>
<p>is that many of the performance glasses out there</p>
<p>that are designed for sport make people look like cyborgs,</p>
<p>which if you want that, they do have those options,</p>
<p>the cyborg options, as I call them,</p>
<p>but they also have many options where the aesthetic</p>
<p>is more of the sort that you would wear to dinner</p>
<p>or to work or anywhere that you happen to be.</p>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about dopamine.</p>
<p>What is dopamine?</p>
<p>Dopamine is what&rsquo;s called a neuromodulator,</p>
<p>which simply refers to the fact that it&rsquo;s a chemical</p>
<p>that modulates or changes the electrical activity</p>
<p>of other cells.</p>
<p>And the cells I&rsquo;m referring to are neurons.</p>
<p>Neurons are just nerve cells.</p>
<p>So you have a brain and a spinal cord,</p>
<p>and the neurons in your brain and spinal cord</p>
<p>connect to one another,</p>
<p>and they connect to different areas of the body,</p>
<p>including basically every organ of your body.</p>
<p>And every organ of your body communicates back</p>
<p>to your brain and spinal cord</p>
<p>through direct or indirect pathways.</p>
<p>For instance, you have neurons in your gut</p>
<p>that sense what sorts of nutrients you&rsquo;ve eaten or drank,</p>
<p>and then send neural signals, electrical signals,</p>
<p>up to the brain.</p>
<p>And indeed, that whole process</p>
<p>happens to be modulated by dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine as a neuromodulator has the basic property</p>
<p>of either ramping up, increasing,</p>
<p>or decreasing the activity of other neurons.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s done by adjusting things</p>
<p>like electrical potentials and things of that sort</p>
<p>that we really won&rsquo;t go into this episode,</p>
<p>but that I promise to get into in detail</p>
<p>in a future episode if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in the biochemistry and biophysics of neurons</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So we have this neuromodulator, dopamine,</p>
<p>and we know that that neuromodulator</p>
<p>can increase or decrease the activity of other neurons.</p>
<p>So then we have to ask ourselves,</p>
<p>where is dopamine released in the brain and body?</p>
<p>And what specific types of neurons is it impacting?</p>
<p>In other words, what specific types of functions</p>
<p>does dopamine have?</p>
<p>So there are basically five circuits within the brain</p>
<p>that use dopamine as the primary neuromodulator,</p>
<p>and those five circuits engage different</p>
<p>but related functions.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to go through them one by one</p>
<p>relatively quickly,</p>
<p>giving you a little bit of nomenclature</p>
<p>and some sense of what each of those circuits looks like</p>
<p>and what it does.</p>
<p>The first circuit is the so-called nigrostriatal pathway.</p>
<p>So in the back of the brain,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an area called substantia nigra,</p>
<p>so named because the neurons, they&rsquo;re actually very dark.</p>
<p>They actually contain pigment.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be able to see this if I were to slice up a brain,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d see two dark regions in the back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s substantia nigra.</p>
<p>Substantia nigra contains neurons</p>
<p>that are chock-a-block full of dopamine,</p>
<p>but they release that dopamine</p>
<p>in a brain structure called the striatum.</p>
<p>The striatum is involved in a movement,</p>
<p>both the initiation of movements</p>
<p>and the suppression of movements</p>
<p>in so-called go action and no-go, suppress action pathways,</p>
<p>a topic for a future podcast.</p>
<p>The second brain circuit that uses and leverages dopamine</p>
<p>to a great extent is the so-called mesolimbic pathway.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ll also in a moment</p>
<p>hear about the mesocortical pathway.</p>
<p>So today I&rsquo;m going to talk about these</p>
<p>somewhat interchangeably at times,</p>
<p>but where it&rsquo;s important for me</p>
<p>to differentiate between them, I will do that.</p>
<p>Both of these pathways initiate from a set of neurons</p>
<p>in the so-called ventral tegmental area or VTA.</p>
<p>I will use that acronym, VTA.</p>
<p>The VTA functions in close partnership</p>
<p>with a different brain structure</p>
<p>called the nucleus accumbens or NA.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll call it NA today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about VTA, ventral tegmental area,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll talk about nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>For sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>you can lump those together if you want.</p>
<p>Neurons in those areas project a bunch of different places,</p>
<p>but in the mesolimbic pathway,</p>
<p>those neurons are projecting to areas of the brain</p>
<p>like the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which sits right above the roof of your mouth</p>
<p>and is responsible for a lot of basic functions,</p>
<p>things like maintaining your body temperature,</p>
<p>for libido and the pursuit of sex, for hunger,</p>
<p>for the generation of signals to the pituitary gland</p>
<p>that caused the release of hormones</p>
<p>and other things into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>So the connections,</p>
<p>which I sometimes refer to as projections,</p>
<p>from the neurons in the VTA and nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>to the hypothalamus are basically using dopamine</p>
<p>to modulate the output of a lot of different things</p>
<p>that happen in this hypothalamus</p>
<p>that controls a lot of,</p>
<p>we could call them primitive functions,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re really basic functions for survival.</p>
<p>Now, the other pathway out of the VTA</p>
<p>and nucleus accumbens is to the cortex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called mesocortical pathway.</p>
<p>So this is a very different pathway</p>
<p>out of the VTA and nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>than the one I just described a moment ago.</p>
<p>The pathway I&rsquo;m talking about now,</p>
<p>the mesocortical pathway,</p>
<p>projects to the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>which is a structure that many of you have perhaps heard of,</p>
<p>but even if you haven&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s important to know</p>
<p>this is an area that resides right behind your forehead</p>
<p>and that in humans compared to other species</p>
<p>is greatly expanded in terms of its size</p>
<p>and complexity of function.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s involved in everything from planning</p>
<p>and executing of action to making good or bad decisions,</p>
<p>depending on context.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the primary functions of prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is to really understand context,</p>
<p>whether or not, for instance,</p>
<p>you are alone in your room</p>
<p>where certain behaviors are appropriate,</p>
<p>whether or not you are at work</p>
<p>where other behaviors are appropriate.</p>
<p>Understanding what the context is</p>
<p>and therefore what sorts of actions</p>
<p>need to be generated and suppressed.</p>
<p>In fact, a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>and this is a guest whose episode hasn&rsquo;t aired yet,</p>
<p>described this beautifully.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a neurosurgeon.</p>
<p>And he said, the way to think about the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s basically an area of the brain that says shh or no,</p>
<p>not now, to other brain regions in order to suppress action.</p>
<p>And we know this because people that have damage</p>
<p>to the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>often can&rsquo;t suppress their impulses.</p>
<p>And so the pathway from VTA and nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>to the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is absolutely critical for today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>because we are largely going to be discussing</p>
<p>motivation, drive, pursuit, procrastination,</p>
<p>and all sorts of things that have to do</p>
<p>with our feelings about context,</p>
<p>whether or not we want to do something or not,</p>
<p>whether or not we feel we should or we shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>whether or not we feel we failed the last time</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a high probability of success the next time.</p>
<p>Prefrontal cortex does many, many things,</p>
<p>but when thinking about dopamine&rsquo;s role</p>
<p>in the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>that is when thinking about this mesocortical pathway,</p>
<p>we really want to think about how dopamine is activating</p>
<p>or changing our propensity to do certain things</p>
<p>and get us into action</p>
<p>or prevent us from doing certain things and prevent action.</p>
<p>So basically you can think about the mesocortical pathway</p>
<p>as a circuit that really governs all of the major choices</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to make in life</p>
<p>about what to do and what not to do toward your goals</p>
<p>and away from the things that you want to avoid.</p>
<p>Now, the fourth dopamine pathway in the brain</p>
<p>is the so-called tuberoinfundibular pathway.</p>
<p>And this is not one we&rsquo;re going to focus on too much today.</p>
<p>This is a pathway that relates to connections</p>
<p>between the brain and your pituitary gland.</p>
<p>Your pituitary gland being that gland that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>as I mentioned a moment ago,</p>
<p>is also receiving input from the hypothalamus</p>
<p>and is releasing a bunch of hormones into your bloodstream,</p>
<p>things like luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>follicle-stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>things like melanocortin hormone.</p>
<p>These are hormones that are impacting everything</p>
<p>from the function of the ovary in females</p>
<p>to the function of the testes in males.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s governing things like cortisol release under stress,</p>
<p>thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s regulating thyroid hormone release,</p>
<p>and on and on.</p>
<p>Dopamine has a very powerful impact</p>
<p>on the output of the pituitary.</p>
<p>So again, that&rsquo;s probably a topic for a future episode,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important in reviewing</p>
<p>the different brain circuits that use dopamine</p>
<p>as a neuromodulator that I mentioned that one.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a fifth one,</p>
<p>and this fifth one is not often discussed,</p>
<p>and again, won&rsquo;t be the main topic of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>but for thoroughness and for clarity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important that we mention it.</p>
<p>This is the circuit within your retina,</p>
<p>that is the pie crust-like lining of neural tissue</p>
<p>on the back of your eye,</p>
<p>because remember, your eye is actually part of your brain</p>
<p>that got extruded from your brain during development.</p>
<p>You know, those two eyes that you see in the mirror</p>
<p>and that you see in other people</p>
<p>are actually two pieces of central nervous system,</p>
<p>and within the retina,</p>
<p>which is the neural portion of the eye,</p>
<p>within the neural retina,</p>
<p>dopamine is responsible for adapting</p>
<p>to different light conditions</p>
<p>so that you can see clearly both in the evening</p>
<p>and when it gets darker, you can still see a bit,</p>
<p>and in the morning when it&rsquo;s very bright,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really have to make adjustments</p>
<p>to your visual system in order to see clearly.</p>
<p>Your visual system does it for you,</p>
<p>and one of the ways that it does that</p>
<p>is through the neuromodulator dopamine.</p>
<p>So today, we are not going to discuss</p>
<p>the retinal dopamine pathways</p>
<p>or the tuberoinfrandibular dopamine pathways,</p>
<p>and we won&rsquo;t really talk so much</p>
<p>about the nigrostriatal pathway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say one more thing about it,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll leave it alone.</p>
<p>We are going to talk about the mesocortical pathway,</p>
<p>and we might touch on the mesolimbic pathway</p>
<p>a little bit as well.</p>
<p>So today, we&rsquo;re mostly going to talk</p>
<p>about mesocortical circuitry and function</p>
<p>and dopamine within the mesocortical circuit,</p>
<p>and the reason that we&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>is that today&rsquo;s discussion is really about motivation,</p>
<p>procrastination, goal-setting, and pursuit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important to understand</p>
<p>that neither dopamine nor the mesocortical circuit</p>
<p>cares about any specific goal or pursuit.</p>
<p>This is a circuit that uses dopamine</p>
<p>in order to pursue anything.</p>
<p>Now, of course, some people have a greater propensity</p>
<p>to pursue things like work or goals in athletics</p>
<p>or relationships or a combination of those.</p>
<p>Other people, unfortunately, have a greater propensity</p>
<p>to pursue things like drugs of abuse.</p>
<p>What are drugs of abuse?</p>
<p>Drugs of abuse tend to be drugs</p>
<p>that increase levels of dopamine</p>
<p>to the extent that other types of pursuits in life</p>
<p>that are adaptive for us,</p>
<p>like work, relationship, school, et cetera,</p>
<p>become irrelevant.</p>
<p>In fact, the definition of addiction that I use</p>
<p>and that I believe really matches the neurobiology very well</p>
<p>is that addiction is a progressive narrowing</p>
<p>of the things that bring us pleasure.</p>
<p>Healthy functioning of the mesocortical pathway, however,</p>
<p>allows us to toggle or switch back and forth</p>
<p>between different types of pursuits</p>
<p>of all the sorts that I&rsquo;ve mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>So if we can understand how that mesocortical pathway works</p>
<p>just a little bit, in particular,</p>
<p>when dopamine is released and when it&rsquo;s not released,</p>
<p>what dopamine does when it&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>to our sense of motivation and drive,</p>
<p>and if we can understand a little bit</p>
<p>about how our recent dopamine history,</p>
<p>that is whether or not there is dopamine</p>
<p>in our system already,</p>
<p>dictates whether or not we are going to feel motivated</p>
<p>in the next five, 10, 15 minutes, hours, days, and weeks.</p>
<p>That is all very easy to understand.</p>
<p>I promise I&rsquo;ll explain it to you in a simple way,</p>
<p>but I want you to get a circuit into your mind.</p>
<p>I want you to envision that there are these neurons,</p>
<p>little nerve cells in the VTA and nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>Those neurons make dopamine.</p>
<p>They send their projections that we call axons,</p>
<p>which are like little wires,</p>
<p>and they can release dopamine into the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And now you already know,</p>
<p>because you learned it a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>that the prefrontal cortex then can ensure</p>
<p>that certain behaviors take place</p>
<p>and other behaviors do not take place,</p>
<p>that shh or quieting that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>With that in mind,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s now take a look at how dopamine is released,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s keep two things in mind.</p>
<p>There are peaks in dopamine,</p>
<p>that is dopamine is released into the frontal cortex,</p>
<p>where it has these effects of activating</p>
<p>or suppressing action.</p>
<p>And we can think of those as peaks in dopamine.</p>
<p>So if I call it a spike,</p>
<p>that means an increase and then a decrease.</p>
<p>If I call it a peak,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an increase and then a decrease.</p>
<p>There can also be troughs in dopamine.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>We have peaks in dopamine,</p>
<p>and that peak in dopamine can rise up</p>
<p>and then go back to what we call baseline,</p>
<p>or there can be a trough, it can go below baseline.</p>
<p>So the two key things to understand about dopamine</p>
<p>is that we have dopamine peaks</p>
<p>that are triggered by certain behaviors,</p>
<p>certain compounds, drugs, or substances, food, et cetera,</p>
<p>and that we have a dopamine baseline.</p>
<p>Our dopamine baseline is our reservoir of dopamine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how full or empty our dopamine pool is.</p>
<p>And that dopamine pool is the pool of dopamine that we use</p>
<p>in order to create those dopamine peaks.</p>
<p>And when those peaks come down,</p>
<p>sometimes they go back to baseline</p>
<p>and sometimes they go to lower than baseline,</p>
<p>which we call the trough.</p>
<p>If any of this seems confusing,</p>
<p>I want you just to imagine a wave pool.</p>
<p>This is an analogy that was given to me</p>
<p>by one of our podcast guests,</p>
<p>which is Dr. Kyle Gillette, who&rsquo;s an obesity specialist</p>
<p>and works on a number of things</p>
<p>related to endocrine hormone function,</p>
<p>including testosterone, estrogen in both men and women.</p>
<p>You want to check out his episodes on hormone health.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fascinating and actionable.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a tremendous wealth of knowledge.</p>
<p>And he has this analogy for how dopamine works</p>
<p>in our brain and body.</p>
<p>And that analogy is this notion of a wave pool.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever seen a wave pool,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically a concrete pool</p>
<p>and there are waves within it, okay?</p>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>Those waves can be of different heights.</p>
<p>So they can be little ripples.</p>
<p>And we can think of those as little mini peaks</p>
<p>or they can be big waves.</p>
<p>They can be really big crashing waves.</p>
<p>If the height of those waves</p>
<p>and the frequency of those waves is very, very large,</p>
<p>some of that water,</p>
<p>which here I&rsquo;m using as an analogy to dopamine,</p>
<p>can slosh out of the wave pool and the baseline drops.</p>
<p>However, if those peaks are small enough</p>
<p>or they are seldom enough,</p>
<p>well then the baseline,</p>
<p>that is the water level in that pool,</p>
<p>stays more or less constant.</p>
<p>I think this is an excellent analogy</p>
<p>for how dopamine works in the mesocortical pathway</p>
<p>as it relates to motivation and pursuit</p>
<p>and all those sorts of things.</p>
<p>Because we really need to think about</p>
<p>how the peaks and the baseline relate to one another.</p>
<p>And this is very important.</p>
<p>The peaks and the baseline</p>
<p>are not independent of one another.</p>
<p>They relate to one another.</p>
<p>So now you have in your mind a wave pool</p>
<p>and just understand that if you get a great big, huge wave,</p>
<p>maybe one of them will crash out</p>
<p>and some of that water will splash out.</p>
<p>The baseline will go down a little bit.</p>
<p>But if you get big peak after big peak after big peak,</p>
<p>pretty soon you&rsquo;re going to empty that pool.</p>
<p>Whereas if you have smaller waves</p>
<p>or less frequent big waves,</p>
<p>well then the baseline will stay relatively constant.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about dopamine peaks and baselines.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s remember that for every peak,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a trough.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, when you have a wave,</p>
<p>you also have the bottom of the wave.</p>
<p>When you have a mountain,</p>
<p>you have the bottom of the mountain.</p>
<p>When we think about dopamine peaks and dopamine baselines,</p>
<p>we have to include that trough</p>
<p>because that trough,</p>
<p>that is the level of dopamine below baseline,</p>
<p>really dictates whether or not you are going to feel</p>
<p>motivated to pursue something or not.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to give you a visual in your mind.</p>
<p>The visual in your mind is an increase in dopamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s triggered by your desire for something.</p>
<p>And really it could be your desire for anything.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hungry and you&rsquo;re thinking about,</p>
<p>I really want a sandwich.</p>
<p>I really want a, let&rsquo;s think,</p>
<p>what sandwich would I want right now?</p>
<p>A really nice roast beef sandwich on sourdough</p>
<p>with a slice of Swiss, tomatoes, slice of pickle.</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m describing the sandwich that I would want.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re hungry and you&rsquo;re thinking about that,</p>
<p>dopamine starts rising.</p>
<p>This is crucially important to understand.</p>
<p>Dopamine is not just released when we get the reward,</p>
<p>when we get the thing that we&rsquo;re pursuing.</p>
<p>Dopamine is released in anticipation of what we want.</p>
<p>That increase in dopamine is by no happenstance,</p>
<p>no mistake, relates also to our propensity</p>
<p>and desire to move.</p>
<p>Remember earlier I told you there&rsquo;s a separate circuit</p>
<p>of dopamine that triggers movement</p>
<p>and that when it&rsquo;s depleted is causing things</p>
<p>like deficits in movement related to Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or other movement disorders.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not pure coincidence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because desire and the need to move</p>
<p>in order to pursue and reach goals</p>
<p>are one in the same process.</p>
<p>So if I desire a sandwich or I desire a cup of coffee</p>
<p>or I desire some water when I&rsquo;m thirsty,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an increase in dopamine</p>
<p>that we could call a little mini peak in dopamine.</p>
<p>But then here&rsquo;s the key thing.</p>
<p>Very soon after I realized my desire for something,</p>
<p>that peak that was caused by the desire comes down</p>
<p>and drops below baseline, below the level of dopamine</p>
<p>that it was prior to even thinking about the sandwich</p>
<p>or the coffee or the glass of water.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that drop below baseline</p>
<p>that triggers my desire to go out and find that sandwich,</p>
<p>that coffee, that water, or that blank,</p>
<p>insert whatever it is that you happen to desire,</p>
<p>action or substance of any kind or person, et cetera.</p>
<p>So that drop below baseline is fundamental</p>
<p>to the whole process.</p>
<p>And that drop below baseline was triggered</p>
<p>by the preceding peak.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that I desire a sandwich,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an increase in dopamine.</p>
<p>Then very quickly it comes down below baseline</p>
<p>just a little bit.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m in pursuit of the sandwich.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for where I can get that sandwich.</p>
<p>I can order it perhaps to be delivered.</p>
<p>I can go out and find it.</p>
<p>Now is the stage in which I have to think about</p>
<p>what are the different stimuli,</p>
<p>that is the things in my environment</p>
<p>that signal whether or not I&rsquo;m likely</p>
<p>to get that sandwich or not.</p>
<p>And so for instance, if I were to go into my phone</p>
<p>and order food on an app or walk down the street</p>
<p>and see the sign for a deli,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a cue that I&rsquo;m likely to relieve that drop</p>
<p>in dopamine and get not just back to baseline,</p>
<p>but that I&rsquo;ll get a peak in dopamine.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s what happens</p>
<p>if I find that deli, I go into the deli,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re open, they&rsquo;re making the sandwich that I want,</p>
<p>they make my sandwich and great, I get that sandwich.</p>
<p>And that sandwich will have some degree</p>
<p>of inherent reward to it.</p>
<p>Some degree of my liking it or not liking it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the best sandwich I&rsquo;ve ever had,</p>
<p>but all I&rsquo;m doing is comparing my desire for that sandwich</p>
<p>to the sandwich that I actually got and ate.</p>
<p>And chances are it&rsquo;s going to relieve that craving,</p>
<p>meaning it will take that dopamine</p>
<p>that had fallen below baseline, up, up, back to baseline.</p>
<p>And if I like the sandwich,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to indeed increase that dopamine,</p>
<p>again, to another peak.</p>
<p>Now, if I love the sandwich,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s the most delicious thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever tasted in my entire life,</p>
<p>well then I&rsquo;ll get a big peak in dopamine</p>
<p>when I consume that reward.</p>
<p>However, chances are the sandwich is more or less</p>
<p>as I expect it to be, which is pretty good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll eat it and I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>What do I mean by fine?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a concept called reward prediction error.</p>
<p>Reward prediction error says that the dopamine</p>
<p>that it has experienced,</p>
<p>that is that&rsquo;s released from the VTA and nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>is going to be of a certain value.</p>
<p>And that value is going to be compared</p>
<p>to the desire and expectation</p>
<p>of what I thought I was going to get.</p>
<p>So if you take what you actually got</p>
<p>minus what you expected, that&rsquo;s reward prediction error.</p>
<p>So if the sandwich is basically what I expected to get,</p>
<p>fine, dopamine comes down basically</p>
<p>to a baseline level that&rsquo;s pretty standard for me</p>
<p>and is basically the baseline level I had</p>
<p>before I ever thought about the sandwich at all.</p>
<p>If the sandwich completely surprises me</p>
<p>and is completely amazing, just an amazing sandwich,</p>
<p>well then the level of dopamine that I experienced</p>
<p>when I consumed that sandwich is going to be even greater</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be that minus what I expected.</p>
<p>So there it&rsquo;s a bigger reward prediction error</p>
<p>in the direction of higher peak by consuming the sandwich.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&rsquo;s the other possibility</p>
<p>which is the deli&rsquo;s closed</p>
<p>or the sandwich they make me is lousy</p>
<p>or it doesn&rsquo;t taste good</p>
<p>or something happened in the consuming of that sandwich</p>
<p>that just makes it a bad experience.</p>
<p>In which case, if we take that reward experienced</p>
<p>minus reward predicted from the initial craving,</p>
<p>well then it&rsquo;s going to be less than what I expected</p>
<p>and therefore the baseline drops below</p>
<p>where it was prior to even desiring the sandwich.</p>
<p>All of this might seem a little bit complicated</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all very simple.</p>
<p>Desire for things increases dopamine</p>
<p>but then our level of dopamine drops below baseline</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s that drop below baseline</p>
<p>that triggers the motivation</p>
<p>to bring that dopamine level back up</p>
<p>by going and pursuing the thing</p>
<p>that you wanted in the first place.</p>
<p>Of course, as this is happening,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not conscious of your dopamine levels,</p>
<p>you experience this as context dependent craving and pursuit</p>
<p>because remember the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is involved in context setting and craving and pursuit</p>
<p>because it relates to action and movement</p>
<p>which is one of the general features of the dopamine system.</p>
<p>So you can start to see</p>
<p>how this is a beautifully designed system</p>
<p>and you can also see how it&rsquo;s a perfect system</p>
<p>for desire and pursuit of anything, not just sandwiches</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m giving you in this somewhat trivial</p>
<p>but everyday and therefore applicable example.</p>
<p>So just by understanding reward prediction error</p>
<p>and especially by understanding</p>
<p>that a craving triggers a peak in dopamine</p>
<p>that makes you motivated</p>
<p>but then drops your level of dopamine below baseline</p>
<p>which makes you even more motivated,</p>
<p>you are already halfway through the conceptual aspect</p>
<p>of today&rsquo;s podcast because if you can understand that,</p>
<p>you will understand why, for instance,</p>
<p>when you initially want something</p>
<p>or you think you want something,</p>
<p>it puts you into motion but then pretty quickly</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re starting to feel the pain of not having that</p>
<p>and that is also contributing</p>
<p>to your desire to pursue that thing.</p>
<p>This is a subtle effect but if you watch for it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll start to see it or experience it within yourself.</p>
<p>Your craving for things is not just about craving</p>
<p>for those things per se,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also a desire to relieve the pain</p>
<p>of not having those things.</p>
<p>And if you can internalize that</p>
<p>and start to develop an awareness around it,</p>
<p>you will be in an amazing position</p>
<p>to leverage all sorts of aspects of the dopamine system</p>
<p>in order to increase your motivation,</p>
<p>especially when things get really hard</p>
<p>or when you have the propensity to procrastinate</p>
<p>which is something that we&rsquo;ll get into</p>
<p>a little bit later in the podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens now called AG1</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;d like to talk about the dynamics of dopamine release</p>
<p>with a little bit more detail.</p>
<p>And this is something I&rsquo;ve never covered</p>
<p>on any social media post or on any podcast,</p>
<p>either this one or as a guest on other podcasts</p>
<p>because on the face of it,</p>
<p>it might seem a little too detailed,</p>
<p>like why is he telling me all this?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it just enough to know that there are peaks</p>
<p>and troughs and baselines in dopamine?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that if you can understand</p>
<p>what that peak and trough are really about,</p>
<p>in other words, what&rsquo;s really happening</p>
<p>when we zoom in on that peak and trough,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be in an amazing position to overcome procrastination</p>
<p>and essentially pursue any goals in an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very excited to share this information with you</p>
<p>because I do think that it has tremendous actionable power.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m about to describe relates to a number</p>
<p>of different findings that have been made</p>
<p>mostly over the last five to 10 years,</p>
<p>although to be quite direct,</p>
<p>mostly within the last five years.</p>
<p>And it has to do with the fact that the peak and trough</p>
<p>and baseline that I talked about a moment ago</p>
<p>that are associated with craving,</p>
<p>they look like a peak followed by a trough</p>
<p>followed by a return to baseline</p>
<p>and maybe another peak if you get the reward</p>
<p>or a drop below baseline if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t like what you got.</p>
<p>But if we were to zoom in on that peak and the reward,</p>
<p>in other words, to really zoom in on the whole process</p>
<p>and start thinking about the circuitry,</p>
<p>that is the neurons and VTA and nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>and how it relates to the frontal cortex</p>
<p>in a bit more detail,</p>
<p>what we discover is nothing short of amazing.</p>
<p>What we discover is that whenever we&rsquo;re pursuing something,</p>
<p>we are always looking for cues as to whether or not</p>
<p>we are on the right path to achieve that thing.</p>
<p>And we are also setting a mindset</p>
<p>or a context within our brains</p>
<p>as to whether or not we are confident or pessimistic</p>
<p>as to whether or not we&rsquo;re going to achieve that thing.</p>
<p>Now, this is vitally important for anyone out there</p>
<p>who finds it hard to get motivated and stay motivated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also vitally important for anyone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s psychologically minded in any way.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a psychologist,</p>
<p>but psychologically minded in any way</p>
<p>and wonders why is it that some people</p>
<p>are just so motivated</p>
<p>and other people have such trouble with motivation?</p>
<p>Why is it that some people require perfect conditions</p>
<p>in order to achieve things</p>
<p>and other people just seem to manage</p>
<p>to pursue things no matter what?</p>
<p>It also relates to the fact that some of us</p>
<p>are very good at achieving our goals in one context</p>
<p>and not so much in another.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what you need to understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stay with the example of the roast beef sandwich</p>
<p>just because we already have that in mind,</p>
<p>but you can replace roast beef sandwich</p>
<p>with essentially any goal.</p>
<p>The cue that we&rsquo;re going to likely get what we want.</p>
<p>So for instance, the sign that there&rsquo;s a deli on the corner</p>
<p>or that I open my phone and that there&rsquo;s an app</p>
<p>that represents a restaurant</p>
<p>that sells the particular sandwich that I like.</p>
<p>That cue, as I mentioned before, increases dopamine.</p>
<p>You see that and like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>And subconsciously there&rsquo;s already a signal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s initiated by that dopamine</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m on the right path.</p>
<p>Then as I mentioned, dopamine drops below baseline.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s further contributing to my desire</p>
<p>to go pursue that sandwich,</p>
<p>either with my thumbs on my phone through the app</p>
<p>or with my feet and walking to the deli,</p>
<p>standing in line and so forth.</p>
<p>Then, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>there is a peak in dopamine of varying height,</p>
<p>depending on how satisfying I find the reward to be</p>
<p>when I actually get that sandwich, get that goal.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind, there is some time delay</p>
<p>between the cue, the app, the deli, et cetera,</p>
<p>and when I get my sandwich.</p>
<p>That gap is going to be different for different things.</p>
<p>So in pursuing a four-year degree,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be four years if the diploma is your goal.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s an exam you&rsquo;re studying for,</p>
<p>it might be a week long.</p>
<p>And there will be many other signals</p>
<p>in between that initial cue that,</p>
<p>hey, the reward likely lies down this path,</p>
<p>in this textbook, on this dating app, or at that deli.</p>
<p>There are many other cues.</p>
<p>Those cues come in subconsciously</p>
<p>and involve everything from how long the line is</p>
<p>at the deli to whether or not you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>the types of people on a dating app</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d like to see,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re responding to you,</p>
<p>whether or not someone&rsquo;s texting you back or not.</p>
<p>All of those cues are integrated</p>
<p>and adjusting your baseline level of dopamine all the time</p>
<p>as you go to pursue that goal.</p>
<p>So what the dopamine system does</p>
<p>is it doesn&rsquo;t just compare the height of the peak</p>
<p>at the beginning, right?</p>
<p>I desire that to the reward that you got.</p>
<p>We talked about reward prediction error.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of first grade version</p>
<p>of reward prediction error.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also taking into account</p>
<p>all the things that happen in between,</p>
<p>and all of that is serving as a cue for the eventual reward,</p>
<p>and all of that is funneling</p>
<p>into what we call reward prediction error.</p>
<p>In other words, the dopamine system</p>
<p>is very good at subconsciously parsing</p>
<p>what are the things that happen</p>
<p>between wanting and getting,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s part of the learning that dopamine achieves,</p>
<p>and indeed, there are specialized circuits</p>
<p>from the VTA and nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>that are involved in just the learning</p>
<p>of how we achieve or don&rsquo;t achieve</p>
<p>specific types of rewards that we desire.</p>
<p>So this is called reward contingent learning</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s learning the contingencies</p>
<p>of what led up to a reward</p>
<p>or what didn&rsquo;t lead up to a reward.</p>
<p>At the same time and in parallel,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an ongoing release of dopamine in the background,</p>
<p>and that ongoing release of dopamine</p>
<p>that has nothing to do with learning</p>
<p>is really just sort of a propeller</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s driving us in the direction</p>
<p>of whatever it is that we&rsquo;re trying to pursue.</p>
<p>So I realize for some of you,</p>
<p>this might seem like unnecessary</p>
<p>or perhaps even an overwhelming amount of detail,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually quite simple.</p>
<p>Your brain is trying to figure out</p>
<p>what happened prior to getting or not getting a reward,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s comparing what you wanted compared to what you got.</p>
<p>At the same time, the dopamine system</p>
<p>initiates a motivation signal</p>
<p>that takes you through that entire round of pursuit.</p>
<p>And those three things, there&rsquo;s the stimulus,</p>
<p>the desire, the I want that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first thing that leads to that peak.</p>
<p>The peak drops a little bit below baseline</p>
<p>and it triggers motivation.</p>
<p>The motivation is the second thing.</p>
<p>The motivation is dopamine release also,</p>
<p>but from a separate set of neurons within this circuit</p>
<p>driving you forward.</p>
<p>And the entire time that it&rsquo;s driving you forward,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s paying attention to what&rsquo;s there along the way,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t realize it consciously.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the reward itself</p>
<p>or the lack of reward itself.</p>
<p>So those three components, the learning contingency,</p>
<p>which has to do with the stimulus and the reward</p>
<p>and everything that happens in between</p>
<p>and the propeller nature of dopamine,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m referring to it,</p>
<p>those all combine into a total learning</p>
<p>so that after you get the sandwich</p>
<p>or after you finish the exam or after you go out on a date</p>
<p>or after you do anything that you desire to do,</p>
<p>that system that originates in the VTA</p>
<p>and nucleus accumbens and goes up to your cortex,</p>
<p>it learned, it learned many things.</p>
<p>It learned the contingency between stimulus</p>
<p>and desire, motivation,</p>
<p>and whether or not you succeeded or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a scoreboard for how you did</p>
<p>given what just happened.</p>
<p>So actually it&rsquo;s all very simple.</p>
<p>In fact, if you can understand</p>
<p>even just half of what I just said,</p>
<p>you are now in a far better position</p>
<p>to understand everything from addiction</p>
<p>to motivation, to procrastination,</p>
<p>and it will make sense of all the tools</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to talk about next,</p>
<p>which will allow you to overcome procrastination points,</p>
<p>to overcome deficits in motivation,</p>
<p>and indeed to reset your motivation in an ongoing way</p>
<p>so that you can reach your goals.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s take everything that I just told you</p>
<p>and set it aside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still important, but let&rsquo;s just set it aside.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to think about any of those details</p>
<p>or names or anything.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just think about addiction</p>
<p>because in biology and in psychology, frankly,</p>
<p>it really often pays to think about the extremes first</p>
<p>and then work our way towards more typical circumstances.</p>
<p>And with that said,</p>
<p>addiction unfortunately is very common nowadays.</p>
<p>I just heard a statistic, in fact,</p>
<p>that there is an 80, 80% increase</p>
<p>in alcohol use disorder among women in the last 30 years.</p>
<p>I talked a little bit about this</p>
<p>in the episode that I did about alcohol and health.</p>
<p>Again, I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not somebody that is completely against alcohol</p>
<p>for adults, provided they&rsquo;re not alcoholics.</p>
<p>Turns out two drinks a week, probably fine health-wise.</p>
<p>Zero would be better.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re honest, zero is better than any alcohol.</p>
<p>But two drinks a week is probably fine.</p>
<p>Past two drinks, you start running into problems.</p>
<p>And yet many, many people out there, male and female alike,</p>
<p>suffer from alcohol use disorder, also called alcoholism.</p>
<p>The same is also true for things like methamphetamine</p>
<p>or cocaine or other types of substance addictions.</p>
<p>And the same is also true for a lot of behavioral</p>
<p>or what are sometimes called process addictions,</p>
<p>things like sex addiction or video game addiction</p>
<p>or any type of behavior that, frankly,</p>
<p>is leveraging the dopamine system,</p>
<p>but that engages this progressive narrowing</p>
<p>of the things that bring someone pleasure,</p>
<p>such that nothing else is really salient.</p>
<p>Nothing else is really pulling them in</p>
<p>in the way that their video games</p>
<p>or sex or pornography or alcohol,</p>
<p>pick your substance or behavior that you see out there</p>
<p>or hopefully not, but that you might suffer</p>
<p>from an addiction to.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening in addiction?</p>
<p>Well, addiction involves dopamine, among other things.</p>
<p>Often the opioid system, et cetera.</p>
<p>But if we were to think about what&rsquo;s the stimulus</p>
<p>in an addiction and what&rsquo;s the peak in dopamine,</p>
<p>and then what happens after that peak,</p>
<p>it all becomes very clear as to why addiction happens</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s so pernicious.</p>
<p>So for instance, let&rsquo;s take cocaine.</p>
<p>Cocaine causes dramatic increases in dopamine</p>
<p>very, very fast.</p>
<p>So if somebody craves cocaine, what are they craving?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re craving that dopamine peak.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re craving the increased level of alertness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re craving a number of things associated</p>
<p>with the feeling of being under the influence of the drug,</p>
<p>but the stimulus for it simply becomes that line of cocaine</p>
<p>or in the case of crack,</p>
<p>that crack rock that they&rsquo;re going to smoke,</p>
<p>and God forbid, they&rsquo;re mainlining it.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re shooting into a vein.</p>
<p>What happens is they snort, smoke, or inject cocaine</p>
<p>and dopamine levels almost immediately</p>
<p>go up, up, up, up, up, up to a very high peak.</p>
<p>Okay, so the time gap between the stimulus</p>
<p>and the dopamine is very, very short.</p>
<p>So short, in fact,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s really no other contingencies in between</p>
<p>that the mesocortical system has to learn.</p>
<p>In fact, what does the system quote-unquote learn?</p>
<p>It learns cocaine equals massive amounts of dopamine</p>
<p>equals feeling euphoric and energetic, et cetera.</p>
<p>And in doing that, it reinforces the whole circuit</p>
<p>so that that short, we can even say hyper short contingency</p>
<p>is really what the system wants.</p>
<p>So much so that longer contingencies of say,</p>
<p>putting in the hard work of, you know,</p>
<p>generating a fitness program</p>
<p>or a professional program for yourself</p>
<p>or a education program,</p>
<p>which takes not just many days, but many weeks and years.</p>
<p>Well, none of that is going to lead to peaks in dopamine</p>
<p>that are as high as the peak in dopamine</p>
<p>associated with cocaine.</p>
<p>So that tells us something critical.</p>
<p>It is both the duration between desire and effect.</p>
<p>And when I say effect,</p>
<p>I mean the rewarding properties of dopamine</p>
<p>that are experienced, that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>So very short gaps teach the system</p>
<p>to expect and want short gaps.</p>
<p>Makes it very hard to pursue things that take longer.</p>
<p>So when we say it&rsquo;s the short,</p>
<p>or in this case, hyper short distance</p>
<p>or time between the stimulus and the dopamine,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re really talking about,</p>
<p>if we were to plot this out on a board</p>
<p>or on a piece of paper,</p>
<p>is the steepness of the rise of that peak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very steep.</p>
<p>The peak in dopamine is coming up very fast</p>
<p>after the desire.</p>
<p>And in addition to that, and this is very important,</p>
<p>the higher the peak in dopamine</p>
<p>and the faster the rise to that peak,</p>
<p>the further below baseline,</p>
<p>the dopamine drops after the drug wears off.</p>
<p>Okay, so in the case of cocaine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very fast and very large rise in dopamine</p>
<p>followed by a steep drop</p>
<p>and very deep trough in dopamine below baseline.</p>
<p>You say, okay, so there&rsquo;s pleasure,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s lack of pleasure.</p>
<p>Ah, but it&rsquo;s worse than that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just lack of pleasure.</p>
<p>If you recall what we talked about a little bit earlier,</p>
<p>that drop below baseline</p>
<p>triggers the desire and the pursuit for what?</p>
<p>For more.</p>
<p>And so this sets in motion a vicious loop</p>
<p>where people start pursuing peaks in dopamine</p>
<p>that can come very fast without much effort.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the ways</p>
<p>in which addiction starts to take hold.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a simple way to think about this</p>
<p>and to remember if you want to avoid this whole thing,</p>
<p>the first one is obvious, don&rsquo;t do cocaine,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try it, don&rsquo;t use it,</p>
<p>certainly don&rsquo;t get addicted to it.</p>
<p>Those are all sort of one in the same, frankly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know many people that,</p>
<p>despite opinions to the contrary,</p>
<p>that use cocaine recreationally,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t at some point run into</p>
<p>either a financial, psychological, physical,</p>
<p>or some other problem.</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s absolutely critical to keep in mind,</p>
<p>and this was discussed in my colleague,</p>
<p>Dr. Ana Lemke&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>Dopamine Nation, and on this podcast,</p>
<p>excellent book, by the way,</p>
<p>I highly recommend it if you haven&rsquo;t read it already.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating exploration into dopamine</p>
<p>as it relates to addiction,</p>
<p>not just drug addiction, but other types of addiction.</p>
<p>Again, the name of that book is Dopamine Nation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide a link to it in the show note captions.</p>
<p>The other thing that happens</p>
<p>after those big, fast increases in dopamine</p>
<p>caused by things like cocaine</p>
<p>is afterwards, when it quickly drops below baseline,</p>
<p>it takes a much longer time</p>
<p>to get back to the original baseline</p>
<p>than it did prior to using the drug.</p>
<p>And worse still is that the peaks in dopamine</p>
<p>that are created from more consumption of cocaine</p>
<p>leads to progressively lower peaks</p>
<p>and deeper troughs below baseline.</p>
<p>So the whole system is shifting away from pleasure</p>
<p>and more to pain and the desire for pursuit of the drug.</p>
<p>This is a terrible situation,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a terrible situation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just unique to cocaine.</p>
<p>In fact, if we were to look at the averages,</p>
<p>and again, these are averages</p>
<p>of the height of the peaks in dopamine</p>
<p>that are created by different substances</p>
<p>and the rates at which those peaks take place,</p>
<p>because remember, the time to peak</p>
<p>is just as important as how high that peak goes,</p>
<p>we see some pretty interesting numbers.</p>
<p>So for instance, and again,</p>
<p>these are averages based on neuroimaging</p>
<p>combined with what are called PET scans,</p>
<p>positron emission tomography combined with blood draws</p>
<p>and a number of other data</p>
<p>from both animal and human studies.</p>
<p>You find is that at baseline,</p>
<p>just kind of on a background of no drug taking of any kind,</p>
<p>the neurons in the ventrotegmental nucleus accumbens area</p>
<p>are firing at a rate of about three to four per second,</p>
<p>releasing dopamine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s your baseline of dopamine release.</p>
<p>Your forebrain is always seeing a little bit of dopamine</p>
<p>from that system.</p>
<p>If you were then to anticipate food</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re relatively hungry, that would double, okay?</p>
<p>So this probably happened</p>
<p>when you decide to eat lunch today,</p>
<p>if you were hungry prior to eating lunch.</p>
<p>It doubles in the anticipation of the food</p>
<p>and then depending on how much you enjoyed that food,</p>
<p>it might triple or quadruple,</p>
<p>it might be lower than it was during the anticipation</p>
<p>as we talked about before.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an approximate doubling</p>
<p>under conditions of desiring and consuming food.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take nicotine as the next example.</p>
<p>For people that use nicotine, either smoking, vaping,</p>
<p>snuffing, or dipping,</p>
<p>all routes of nicotine administration</p>
<p>that I covered in our episode about nicotine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s about a 150% increase</p>
<p>in the rate of dopamine neuron firing.</p>
<p>Cocaine is going to increase the rate of dopamine output</p>
<p>into the prefrontal cortex by about 1,000%, okay?</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>is a tenfold increase in the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released into the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>as measured by the rates of firing of these dopamine neurons.</p>
<p>Methamphetamine is going to be anywhere from 1,000%,</p>
<p>anywhere up to 10,000%.</p>
<p>It really varies depending on the potency of the drug</p>
<p>and a few other factors.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where perhaps it gets a little more interesting.</p>
<p>Some of you are probably wondering about caffeine</p>
<p>or about sex or about video games.</p>
<p>Now, there the numbers vary tremendously,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really important to understand</p>
<p>that across the board,</p>
<p>not just for caffeine, sex, video games,</p>
<p>but also for nicotine, alcohol,</p>
<p>and other substances and what we call motivated behaviors,</p>
<p>some of which are part of a healthy life</p>
<p>like eating and reproduction,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s age appropriate, context appropriate,</p>
<p>species appropriate, consensual,</p>
<p>well, then we consider it adaptive.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not, well, then consider it maladaptive.</p>
<p>Some people will sit down to play a video game.</p>
<p>They really like video games.</p>
<p>And as they&rsquo;re sitting down,</p>
<p>they will experience a fivefold increase</p>
<p>in the rate of dopamine output</p>
<p>from their nucleus accumbens.</p>
<p>For other people, it&rsquo;s going to be a tenfold increase.</p>
<p>For other people like me</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t like video games very much,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything against them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t dislike them, but it doesn&rsquo;t do much for me.</p>
<p>It might not cause any increase whatsoever.</p>
<p>It might even cause a decrease in dopamine.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of individual variability.</p>
<p>For sex, it turns out to be a range.</p>
<p>So the typical range that&rsquo;s cited in the literature</p>
<p>is anywhere from a four to fivefold increase</p>
<p>in the rate of dopamine neuron firing.</p>
<p>However, there are certain individuals</p>
<p>for which that number is doubled.</p>
<p>Caffeine is a little bit of a special circumstance</p>
<p>because caffeine has the property</p>
<p>of not just causing the release of dopamine,</p>
<p>but increasing the amount of dopamine receptors over time.</p>
<p>And there aren&rsquo;t a lot of excellent measurements</p>
<p>of the amount of dopamine released</p>
<p>as a function of caffeine intake</p>
<p>in different populations of humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly animal studies.</p>
<p>But what we think based on the Gestalt,</p>
<p>based on the overall picture of the literature</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s an approximate doubling</p>
<p>of the dopamine signaling that&rsquo;s coming out</p>
<p>of the VTA nucleus accumbens to prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>when we anticipate and when we drink our coffee.</p>
<p>Again, I really want to be clear</p>
<p>that for all of these things,</p>
<p>these are relative levels and they are distribution.</p>
<p>So if we were to plot them out on paper,</p>
<p>you would see that these are not bar graphs.</p>
<p>These are overlapping curves to some extent.</p>
<p>So some people are going to achieve more dopamine release</p>
<p>or less dopamine release from one behavior or substance.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s very clear that cocaine, methamphetamine,</p>
<p>even heroin for that matter,</p>
<p>are way out on the right-hand side of the curve</p>
<p>causing enormous increases in dopamine very quickly.</p>
<p>And the other things that we described</p>
<p>have again a distribution that is more leftward shifted</p>
<p>on this imaginary plot that I&rsquo;m creating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of individual variability.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s fascinating that dopamine</p>
<p>is the single molecule that&rsquo;s causing the craving</p>
<p>and pursuit and experience of all of these substances</p>
<p>and behaviors.</p>
<p>And the learning of all of that craving pursuit</p>
<p>and actual experience is what predicts whether or not</p>
<p>we will re-engage, reuse that substance or not,</p>
<p>re-engage in a behavior or not,</p>
<p>and how frequently we will do that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s addiction.</p>
<p>But if you understand how the height of those peaks</p>
<p>in dopamine and the rate to reach those peaks</p>
<p>and the troughs that result</p>
<p>and how long the troughs take to get back to baseline,</p>
<p>if you understand or a little or all of that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really in a terrific position</p>
<p>to understand how to leverage the dopamine system</p>
<p>for the pursuit of healthy goals and behaviors.</p>
<p>I should mention one thing about recovery from addiction,</p>
<p>which is that the reset of all that dopamine circuitry</p>
<p>from unhealthy to healthy</p>
<p>often involves, depending on the addiction,</p>
<p>30 days of complete abstinence.</p>
<p>That 30 days of complete abstinence</p>
<p>inevitably involves a lot of pain and discomfort</p>
<p>and craving, anxiety, insomnia, et cetera,</p>
<p>that relates to the big trough in dopamine</p>
<p>that inevitably occurs.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are some addictions</p>
<p>such as severe alcohol addiction,</p>
<p>and in some cases, opiate addiction,</p>
<p>that immediate and sustained abstinence</p>
<p>cannot be used as the tool.</p>
<p>Somebody really needs to work with an addiction specialist,</p>
<p>and sometimes there needs to be a tapering off</p>
<p>of the substance.</p>
<p>For other addictions, it can be, quote-unquote, cold turkey.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there are other addictions,</p>
<p>particular food and sex,</p>
<p>but sometimes even things like video games,</p>
<p>for which the desired outcome</p>
<p>is not necessarily to eliminate the behavior completely,</p>
<p>but to set some constraints around the behavior</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s not occurring to the exclusion</p>
<p>of other pleasureful things in life</p>
<p>and adaptive things in life.</p>
<p>And for that, there is the requirement</p>
<p>for what are called binding behaviors.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get back to binding behaviors later,</p>
<p>but binding behaviors are behaviors</p>
<p>in which people bind their behavior</p>
<p>around a particular substance use</p>
<p>or around a particular behavioral addiction,</p>
<p>like sex, video games, et cetera,</p>
<p>in space and or time.</p>
<p>In space, meaning they might only engage</p>
<p>in those particular behaviors in certain places</p>
<p>and certain times when it&rsquo;s context-appropriate.</p>
<p>There are numerous examples of binding behaviors</p>
<p>in space and time,</p>
<p>and it all has to do with clamping or directing</p>
<p>when the engagement with the dopamine-releasing behavior</p>
<p>is going to occur.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening when people decide to go cold turkey</p>
<p>or they use these binding behaviors?</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s happening is that people are engaging</p>
<p>the specific circuitry within the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>that, as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>are important for context setting.</p>
<p>So in the cases of binding behaviors,</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex is essentially getting trained up</p>
<p>to understand that, okay, certain things like food</p>
<p>or perhaps sex or perhaps video games,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re okay if they are done or consumed</p>
<p>in appropriate amounts or in particular contexts.</p>
<p>That requires the context-setting goal-directed behavior</p>
<p>that the prefrontal cortex is responsible.</p>
<p>Okay, so for the last 10 or 15 minutes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about addiction,</p>
<p>and actually this is not an episode about addiction.</p>
<p>However, if you understand a little bit</p>
<p>about the dopamine dynamics in an addiction,</p>
<p>you can leverage that knowledge</p>
<p>towards healthy, adaptive goal pursuit</p>
<p>and achieving your goals.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s think about that in the context</p>
<p>of what generates dopamine peaks,</p>
<p>what generates desire to pursue goals,</p>
<p>what causes our readout of whether or not</p>
<p>we achieved a goal or not.</p>
<p>In other words, what allows us to learn</p>
<p>how to pursue goals of different kinds,</p>
<p>not just get good at achieving one kind of goal,</p>
<p>but really understand and get really, really good</p>
<p>at setting goals and pursuing goals of different kinds</p>
<p>that are adaptive in different areas of life,</p>
<p>because we all are going to have to pursue goals</p>
<p>in school, work, relationships, fitness, mental health,</p>
<p>and on and on in order to be our best selves, that&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>Well, all of that is possible</p>
<p>using the same basic set of dopamine circuits</p>
<p>and the same basic dynamics of dopamine.</p>
<p>So for instance, if we are going to feel motivated at all,</p>
<p>that is, if we are going to wake up in the morning</p>
<p>or have any period of time during our day</p>
<p>in which we feel like we are capable of pursuing goals,</p>
<p>we are going to have to have a healthy level</p>
<p>of baseline dopamine.</p>
<p>In other words, we are going to have to have enough dopamine</p>
<p>in the wave pool, enough water in the wave pool, that is,</p>
<p>before we can generate any waves or peaks in dopamine,</p>
<p>let alone troughs and the rest.</p>
<p>So how do we achieve a healthy baseline level of dopamine?</p>
<p>Well, there we can really look</p>
<p>to some foundational practices,</p>
<p>practices that perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard about</p>
<p>on this podcast before,</p>
<p>and that to some of you might seem a little mundane,</p>
<p>although some of them are a bit more sophisticated,</p>
<p>maybe even esoteric.</p>
<p>The good news is that we can all control these things,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t require purchasing anything,</p>
<p>but they do require some degree</p>
<p>of regular upkeep and effort.</p>
<p>Those things include what I call the very basics.</p>
<p>Now, the very basics,</p>
<p>put in the context of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>are the things that put water in the wave pool.</p>
<p>Those are going to be getting sufficient amounts</p>
<p>of quality sleep each night,</p>
<p>something that we&rsquo;ve done several episodes on</p>
<p>and have online toolkits for,</p>
<p>so you can see the Master Your Sleep episode,</p>
<p>the Perfect Your Sleep episode,</p>
<p>the Light and Health episode.</p>
<p>If you want to skip all that and just get right to the tools,</p>
<p>we have a sleep toolkit,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s actually called the Toolkit for Sleep</p>
<p>that you can access at hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>completely zero cost.</p>
<p>You just go there and download that toolkit.</p>
<p>Getting sufficient sleep each night</p>
<p>literally restores your dopamine reserves.</p>
<p>It allows dopamine to be present,</p>
<p>and for you to have a level of baseline dopamine</p>
<p>that will allow you to even consider your goals</p>
<p>in any kind of meaningful or reasonable way.</p>
<p>Second, there are practices</p>
<p>that are supported by the scientific literature</p>
<p>to increase your baseline level of dopamine</p>
<p>that are independent of sleep,</p>
<p>but are similar to sleep,</p>
<p>and I like to refer to these as non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>This is not meditation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually very little evidence</p>
<p>that meditation of the traditional kind</p>
<p>of sitting eyes closed, third eye,</p>
<p>focusing on your third eye center,</p>
<p>which is this area behind your forehead,</p>
<p>there is very little evidence</p>
<p>that that increases levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>There is a place for meditation</p>
<p>in the context of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll repeat, meditation itself is a focusing exercise.</p>
<p>It is not known to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>However, non-sleep deep rest, so-called NSDR,</p>
<p>very similar, although different</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s sometimes called yoga nidra,</p>
<p>which is where you lie there,</p>
<p>you do a sort of body scan, some long exhale breathing.</p>
<p>NSDR is very similar.</p>
<p>You can find a link to a zero cost NSDR on YouTube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 10 minute long one.</p>
<p>There are also 20 and 30 minute ones out there,</p>
<p>also on YouTube,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll provide a link to the 10 minute one.</p>
<p>Those have been shown to increase the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>in your dopamine reserves by up to 65%,</p>
<p>which is a remarkable number.</p>
<p>So quality sleep, non-sleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra,</p>
<p>very powerful ways to keep your baseline level of dopamine</p>
<p>at a sufficient level.</p>
<p>In addition to that, nutrition no doubt plays a role</p>
<p>in your baseline level of dopamine</p>
<p>because tyrosine, the amino acid,</p>
<p>is the rate limiting enzyme for the synthesis of dopamine.</p>
<p>Tyrosine is present in varying levels in different foods.</p>
<p>You can look those up online.</p>
<p>You just simply put in a search</p>
<p>for tyrosine levels in different foods,</p>
<p>everything from particular cheeses,</p>
<p>like Parmesan cheese has high levels of tyrosine,</p>
<p>certain meats, certain nuts, certain vegetables.</p>
<p>Without getting into details and specifics,</p>
<p>you can find those there,</p>
<p>but you need proper nutrition</p>
<p>and therefore nutrients, in particular tyrosine,</p>
<p>in order to have sufficient levels of baseline dopamine.</p>
<p>The third thing on the list, and again,</p>
<p>these are things that we come back to almost every episode,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think they can be repeated enough</p>
<p>because these are really things</p>
<p>that we need to focus on every 24 hours.</p>
<p>You might be able to skip a day here or there</p>
<p>if you get sick or you&rsquo;re traveling</p>
<p>or you have some major life event,</p>
<p>but really every 24 hours, we need to re-up our sleep.</p>
<p>We need to re-up our nutrients.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re fasting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re re-upping your nutrients</p>
<p>from stored sources within your body.</p>
<p>The third thing is sunlight, morning sunlight in particular.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done extensive episodes about this.</p>
<p>Check out the episode on lighting your health</p>
<p>if you want all the details,</p>
<p>but you want to try and view sunlight</p>
<p>as early in the day as possible.</p>
<p>Five to 10 minutes on a clear day, minimum.</p>
<p>10 to 20 minutes on a cloudy day, minimum.</p>
<p>20 or 30 minutes on a very overcast day, minimum.</p>
<p>Without sunglasses, don&rsquo;t stare at the sun.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t damage your eyes.</p>
<p>Look off, slightly off from the sun,</p>
<p>but yes, you want to face eastward towards the sun.</p>
<p>And on those cloudy days, that&rsquo;s especially important to do.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, viewing morning sunlight</p>
<p>increases cortisol early in the day,</p>
<p>which is excellent because you want cortisol</p>
<p>elevated early in the day</p>
<p>and you want it lower later in the day.</p>
<p>And because of the relationship</p>
<p>between the cells in your eye that sense sunlight,</p>
<p>specifically morning sunlight,</p>
<p>believe it or not, that happens,</p>
<p>and signal to your hypothalamus</p>
<p>and the relationship between the hypothalamus</p>
<p>and the pituitary and other endocrine organs,</p>
<p>it sets in motion a dopamine-related cascade</p>
<p>in neuromodulators, dopamine,</p>
<p>and hormones that lead to states of well-being,</p>
<p>elevated mood, alertness, et cetera, throughout the day.</p>
<p>It also helps your sleep at night,</p>
<p>but today we&rsquo;re talking about dopamine.</p>
<p>So yes, believe it or not,</p>
<p>that morning sunlight exposure</p>
<p>does increase your levels of dopamine, not just cortisol.</p>
<p>And fourth on the list is going to be movement,</p>
<p>exercise of varying kinds.</p>
<p>It could be resistance training,</p>
<p>it could be cardiovascular training.</p>
<p>That does increase levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;re not talking about achieving peaks in dopamine.</p>
<p>That could be accomplished</p>
<p>through setting a personal record, a PR,</p>
<p>or through sprints or heavy lifts</p>
<p>or learning some new dynamic movement.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>is getting into a regular exercise program</p>
<p>of if not every day, at least five days a week,</p>
<p>a mixture of cardiovascular and resistance exercise.</p>
<p>That we also know is known to elevate</p>
<p>and maintain an elevated level of baseline dopamine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about the euphoria</p>
<p>you feel during or after exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about the baseline level of dopamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s achieved through regular movement</p>
<p>and engaging in movement.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re asking how could that be,</p>
<p>well, you already know the answer.</p>
<p>The circuits in the brain and body that generate movement,</p>
<p>not just goal-seeking, but movement itself,</p>
<p>as I mentioned earlier, that nigrostriatal pathway.</p>
<p>And yes, that circuit is separate</p>
<p>from the VTA nucleus accumbens to cortical circuit,</p>
<p>the mesocortical circuit</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve mainly been focusing on today, but they interact.</p>
<p>And so by engaging in regular movement,</p>
<p>you ensure that you&rsquo;re maintaining elevated levels</p>
<p>of baseline dopamine, which is what you want</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to be able to engage</p>
<p>in any kind of motivated pursuit behavior of any kind.</p>
<p>So those are the fundamentals</p>
<p>that will set the level of baseline dopamine</p>
<p>in your system.</p>
<p>A couple of key points.</p>
<p>Yes, there is variation based on both genetics</p>
<p>and circumstance in baseline levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s going through a particular hard time,</p>
<p>or if somebody inherited a gene</p>
<p>in the dopamine synthesis pathway</p>
<p>that simply affords them higher levels of baseline dopamine,</p>
<p>we likely know these people.</p>
<p>They seem hyper-motivated all the time,</p>
<p>not just based on prior success,</p>
<p>but they just seem to have a lot of energy</p>
<p>and a lot of go drive.</p>
<p>You know, you talk about activation energy.</p>
<p>Some of you may know what that term means.</p>
<p>Others of you won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Having low activation energy is great.</p>
<p>I mean, the amount of energy that it takes</p>
<p>to get into action to pursue adaptive</p>
<p>and meaningful, healthy goals.</p>
<p>Some people just seem to have lower activation energy</p>
<p>and higher levels of dopamine</p>
<p>are probably associated with that.</p>
<p>Some of us have lower levels of baseline dopamine.</p>
<p>Regardless, everyone needs to engage</p>
<p>in the foundational things</p>
<p>that I just mentioned a few moments ago,</p>
<p>every 24 hours, or at least strive to.</p>
<p>There is no escaping that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just take a brief moment</p>
<p>and thank one of our podcast sponsors,</p>
<p>which is InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer</p>
<p>in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that blood work</p>
<p>is the only way that you can monitor the markers,</p>
<p>such as hormone markers, lipids,</p>
<p>metabolic factors, et cetera,</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>One major challenge with blood work, however,</p>
<p>is that most of the time,</p>
<p>it does not come back with any information</p>
<p>about what to do in order to move the values</p>
<p>for hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,</p>
<p>into the ranges that you want.</p>
<p>With InsideTracker, changing those values</p>
<p>becomes very straightforward</p>
<p>because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use</p>
<p>to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,</p>
<p>supplement-based approaches that you can use</p>
<p>in order to move those values</p>
<p>into the ranges that are optimal for you,</p>
<p>your vitality, and your longevity.</p>
<p>InsideTracker now includes a measurement</p>
<p>of apolipoprotein B, so-called ApoB,</p>
<p>in their ultimate plan.</p>
<p>ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>and therefore, there&rsquo;s extreme value</p>
<p>to knowing your ApoB levels.</p>

<p>Now, there are things that can increase</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s baseline level of dopamine further,</p>
<p>and some of those get us into the realm</p>
<p>of supplements and prescription drugs,</p>
<p>but for now, I just want to mention a few of them</p>
<p>that are purely behavioral in nature, are zero cost,</p>
<p>and that have been shown in the research literature</p>
<p>to increase baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>for long periods of time, and this is important</p>
<p>because if any of you are out there listening</p>
<p>to this thing about peaks and troughs and baselines,</p>
<p>you might be asking, well, wait,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between a baseline and a peak, really?</p>
<p>Because if, for instance, you get a big peak,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s a peak in the baseline,</p>
<p>so how do you distinguish between peak and baseline?</p>
<p>And, well, there&rsquo;s a trough,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say that trough lasts an hour.</p>
<p>Is that hour-long trough your baseline,</p>
<p>or where&rsquo;s your set point?</p>
<p>How do you establish your set point,</p>
<p>and more importantly, how do you raise your set point?</p>
<p>Ah, well, if you&rsquo;re not already asking that question,</p>
<p>I just asked it for you.</p>
<p>I define an increase in your baseline level in dopamine</p>
<p>to be anything that increases dopamine</p>
<p>for more than one hour.</p>
<p>You know, when we think about cocaine, amphetamine,</p>
<p>pornography, sex, caffeine, things of that sort,</p>
<p>regardless of how long one engages</p>
<p>in a bout of those behaviors or substances,</p>
<p>the increases in dopamine are going to be</p>
<p>relatively short-lived, on the order of minutes to an hour,</p>
<p>sometimes longer.</p>
<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s how long</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re engaging in the behaviors.</p>
<p>I said that&rsquo;s how long those increases in dopamine</p>
<p>are going to occur, even if you were to continually engage</p>
<p>in those behaviors, and remember,</p>
<p>with continual engagement in a dopamine-spiking behavior,</p>
<p>behavior that increases dopamine peaks,</p>
<p>the height of those peaks, remember,</p>
<p>gets lower and lower and lower,</p>
<p>especially in a short amount of time,</p>
<p>and then drops below baseline.</p>
<p>There are tools and techniques that you can use</p>
<p>to elevate your baseline level of dopamine</p>
<p>for long periods of time, and here, again,</p>
<p>this is done in addition to the basic tools</p>
<p>that I mentioned a few moments ago.</p>
<p>The simplest one for which there are excellent data,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m referring to data published</p>
<p>in the European Journal of Physiology,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a link to this,</p>
<p>is that exposure of your body up to the neck to cold water,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be super cold, by the way,</p>
<p>to cold water has been shown to increase baseline levels</p>
<p>of dopamine and the other so-called catecholamines,</p>
<p>which include norepinephrine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>but for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>dopamine in particular, for not just one,</p>
<p>but at least two and probably as long as four or five hours.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been some additional scientific studies</p>
<p>after the paper I just mentioned,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really remarkable.</p>
<p>You can accomplish this a number of different ways.</p>
<p>You could get into a cold shower in the morning,</p>
<p>and I do recommend doing this in the morning,</p>
<p>and in that case, it&rsquo;s okay to get the water on your head.</p>
<p>In fact, I recommend it.</p>
<p>You could get into an ice bath.</p>
<p>You could get into a cold plunge.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, I&rsquo;m not suggesting this</p>
<p>for sake of increasing metabolism or fat loss.</p>
<p>You know, the whole discussion around deliberate cold</p>
<p>and metabolism and fat loss</p>
<p>has become a little bit controversial,</p>
<p>so we won&rsquo;t go there now,</p>
<p>mostly because we&rsquo;re focused on the clear ability</p>
<p>of deliberate cold exposure to increase dopamine</p>
<p>for long periods of time, AKA your dopamine baseline.</p>
<p>The ways to do this vary depending on the temperature.</p>
<p>So for instance, there are data pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that if you want to get a long-lasting increase</p>
<p>in your baseline dopamine,</p>
<p>you could take a very cold shower or cold plunge</p>
<p>or ice bath for a very brief period of time,</p>
<p>anywhere from 30 seconds to two minutes,</p>
<p>maybe three minutes, but probably 30 seconds to two minutes.</p>
<p>Now, you might ask, what is very cold?</p>
<p>Here, I have to be careful</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to recommend anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to cause anyone to have a heart attack</p>
<p>or going to shock or anything of that sort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to vary by person</p>
<p>depending on your level of cold tolerance.</p>
<p>So what I recommend is if you are going</p>
<p>for the short exposure, long dopamine release approach,</p>
<p>that is 30 seconds to two minutes,</p>
<p>that you start warmer than you think you need to</p>
<p>and then you ease into it over a few days.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re really talking about ranges in temperature</p>
<p>from anywhere from about 37 degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p>to about 55 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Again, be careful, approach it with caution</p>
<p>and ease into it.</p>
<p>I do recommend doing this early in the day.</p>
<p>And I should mention,</p>
<p>not after strength or hypertrophy training</p>
<p>because within the six hours</p>
<p>after strength or hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>this deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>especially immersion up to the neck,</p>
<p>can suppress the strength and hypertrophy adaptation</p>
<p>that the training is designed to accomplish, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one approach.</p>
<p>The other approach that&rsquo;s supported by the literature</p>
<p>to increase baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>for very long periods of time,</p>
<p>in fact, this is the original approach,</p>
<p>is to get into warmer water.</p>
<p>So not warm, but warmer.</p>
<p>So 60 degree Fahrenheit water up to the neck</p>
<p>and to stay there for about 45 to 60 minutes.</p>
<p>The reason I don&rsquo;t think most people will do that</p>
<p>or that most people would prefer</p>
<p>a shorter, colder exposure protocol</p>
<p>is that most people don&rsquo;t have 45 to 60 minutes</p>
<p>each morning to get into water and sit there.</p>
<p>And in that study,</p>
<p>they actually had them sitting in lawn chairs, basically,</p>
<p>in the shallow end of a pool up to their neck</p>
<p>for a full 60 minutes</p>
<p>and then measuring dopamine release and so forth.</p>
<p>So there are a bunch of different ways to do this.</p>
<p>I should emphasize,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to be super precise</p>
<p>about the temperature and even the duration.</p>
<p>What I recommend is find a temperature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uncomfortably cold to you,</p>
<p>meaning that you feel agitated and you want to get out,</p>
<p>but that you&rsquo;re confident you can safely stay in.</p>
<p>And again, I can&rsquo;t give a simple prescriptive to everybody,</p>
<p>but this is known to increase</p>
<p>baseline levels of dopamine significantly.</p>
<p>In fact, double them or more for long periods of time,</p>
<p>meaning hours up to four,</p>
<p>maybe even six hours into the day,</p>
<p>which is one of the reasons</p>
<p>I suggest doing this early in the day.</p>
<p>I happen to get into a cold plunge or take a cold shower</p>
<p>first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>I do go outside and get my sunlight first sometimes.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do the cold first.</p>
<p>It really depends on my circumstances</p>
<p>and how I&rsquo;m feeling that day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it really matters which one you do first,</p>
<p>but you want to try and get both of those in</p>
<p>early in the day,</p>
<p>because you really want the catecholamines</p>
<p>and cortisol elevated early in the day.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>We already talked about exercise.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re doing your exercise early in the day,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason why it couldn&rsquo;t be done</p>
<p>in concert with this deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>I recommend doing the deliberate cold exposure first</p>
<p>for the reasons we talked about a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>And then of course there are compounds,</p>
<p>both prescription and over-the-counter compounds</p>
<p>that can indeed raise your baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>for an hour or more.</p>
<p>And when I say an hour or more,</p>
<p>it really depends on individual variation</p>
<p>in terms of how quickly you metabolize dopamine.</p>
<p>And it depends on individual variation</p>
<p>in how you manage or tolerate different dosages of drugs</p>
<p>and different types of drugs.</p>
<p>So the typical drugs,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m talking about legal prescription drugs</p>
<p>for increasing dopamine are things like Ritalin, Adderall.</p>
<p>Modafinil and armodafinil also tap into this system.</p>
<p>And I did an entire episode about ADHD,</p>
<p>which is the typical context in which you hear</p>
<p>about these prescription drugs.</p>
<p>But assuming it&rsquo;s prescribed by a doctor</p>
<p>for either clinical reasons like ADHD or for other reasons,</p>
<p>all of those compounds do significantly increase</p>
<p>baseline levels of dopamine for many, many hours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely clear.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the major reasons</p>
<p>why those drugs are so effective</p>
<p>in increasing motivation and attention.</p>
<p>Then there are compounds that are sold over the counter,</p>
<p>things like amino acids, such as L-tyrosine itself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very commonly sold and used amino acid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s present in a lot of so-called pre-workout formulas.</p>
<p>I, as many of you know,</p>
<p>am a fan of single ingredient supplements for the most part,</p>
<p>aside from foundational supplements like AG1,</p>
<p>which give you many, many micronutrients kind of all together</p>
<p>because it would be nearly impossible</p>
<p>to consume each of those as individual ingredients</p>
<p>and get the right amounts, et cetera.</p>
<p>But for all other supplements,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in parsing what you need</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s most effective for you</p>
<p>in single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>And the typical ways in which people work</p>
<p>to elevate their baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>with supplements are using either L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>which as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>is the rate limiting enzyme for dopamine,</p>
<p>or by using what&rsquo;s called mucunipurines,</p>
<p>which is actually very similar to L-DOPA,</p>
<p>which is the treatment for Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mucunipurines actually comes from the velvety outside coating</p>
<p>of a certain bean.</p>
<p>I know it sounds really esoteric,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually where it&rsquo;s found in nature,</p>
<p>and is really 99% L-DOPA.</p>
<p>And I confess having tried mucunipurines,</p>
<p>having examined the scientific literature on mucunipurines,</p>
<p>there is some evidence that it can increase dopamine,</p>
<p>especially in that tuber-infrandibular pathway</p>
<p>because it can tap into some of the hormone related functions</p>
<p>of the pituitary.</p>
<p>It does increase alertness and mood.</p>
<p>It might even increase libido, motivation, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the effects of mucunipurines tend to be very much</p>
<p>of the increasing the peak in dopamine,</p>
<p>and then very quickly dropping that peak.</p>
<p>In other words, the peak trough phenomenon,</p>
<p>not for increasing baseline levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s likely different for people with Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who are taking prescription drugs</p>
<p>that are similar to mucunipurines.</p>
<p>So if people have Parkinson&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>oftentimes they are prescribed things like L-DOPA,</p>
<p>which is in the pathway to dopamine synthesis,</p>
<p>or they are prescribed things like bromocriptine,</p>
<p>which will indeed increase dopamine.</p>
<p>And I do realize that some people</p>
<p>use those prescription drugs recreationally,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t recommend.</p>
<p>Those drugs can be used</p>
<p>to increase baseline levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>but more typically they cause peaks in dopamine</p>
<p>and troughs in dopamine,</p>
<p>which is why I do not recommend them.</p>
<p>They are not going to allow you to accomplish what you want</p>
<p>if your goal is more motivation, et cetera.</p>
<p>In fact, they are likely to do the opposite,</p>
<p>give you a big peak in alertness,</p>
<p>and then a crash that can include depressive symptoms</p>
<p>and just not feeling very good.</p>
<p>L-tyrosine, however,</p>
<p>has been examined in the scientific literature</p>
<p>and at reasonably low dosages</p>
<p>has been shown to increase circulating</p>
<p>and available levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>both in the brain and body,</p>
<p>and lead to increased cognitive performance</p>
<p>and in some cases, physical output.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide links to a few of these studies,</p>
<p>but the two that I really parsed most finely</p>
<p>for sake of this episode,</p>
<p>really just focus on taking L-tyrosine</p>
<p>under conditions where your baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>are reduced due to stress</p>
<p>and under conditions where there&rsquo;s no stress</p>
<p>and people are trying to increase</p>
<p>their baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>for sake of improving cognitive function.</p>
<p>The first paper is entitled</p>
<p>Effective Tyrosine on Cognitive Function</p>
<p>and Blood Pressure Under Stress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a link to this in the show note captions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of many papers, really,</p>
<p>dating back to the early nineties,</p>
<p>exploring how relatively high, frankly,</p>
<p>relatively high dosages of L-tyrosine</p>
<p>taken under conditions of stress</p>
<p>allow people to rescue some of their cognitive function</p>
<p>in terms of working memory tasks</p>
<p>and other kinds of cognitive tasks,</p>
<p>visual pursuit tasks, and so on.</p>
<p>The second paper is entitled</p>
<p>Tyrosine Improves Working Memory</p>
<p>in a Multitasking Environment.</p>
<p>And the second paper is perhaps more interesting</p>
<p>because it involves exploring</p>
<p>the use of tyrosine supplementation,</p>
<p>basically taking tyrosine about an hour</p>
<p>before a cognitive task or set of cognitive tasks</p>
<p>that involve a lot of multitasking</p>
<p>and working memory.</p>
<p>Working memory, for those of you that don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>is your ability to maintain small batches of information</p>
<p>in your mind for relatively short periods of time.</p>
<p>So for instance, if I tell you my phone number</p>
<p>or the phone number where I grew up, 493-2931,</p>
<p>if you can remember that,</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;ll remember it for 30 seconds, 60 seconds,</p>
<p>but that you won&rsquo;t remember it tomorrow</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s really no reason to.</p>
<p>A lot of the tasks that we do throughout the day</p>
<p>involve working memory.</p>
<p>And working memory is very subject to interference</p>
<p>from other tasks that we happen to be doing,</p>
<p>like looking at our phone or having a conversation</p>
<p>or trying to navigate through a city.</p>
<p>It involves a lot of attention.</p>
<p>And this study shows that tyrosine improves working memory,</p>
<p>especially in the context of multitasking</p>
<p>and having a lot of conflicting goals.</p>
<p>And they did a number of really nice experiments here.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s a small study, not that many subjects,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one of several papers.</p>
<p>In fact, this is the paper that kind of set in motion</p>
<p>the domino of other papers exploring</p>
<p>the efficacy of L-tyrosine for cognitive performance.</p>
<p>And they looked at working memory tasks, of course,</p>
<p>but also auditory visual tasks,</p>
<p>and they involve some interference of visual cues</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>And they saw some really interesting effects.</p>
<p>Basically, when we need to attend to multiple things</p>
<p>at the same time, L-tyrosine can help us do that,</p>
<p>at least as it relates to memory.</p>
<p>When I say L-tyrosine, what I really mean</p>
<p>is having your baseline levels of dopamine elevated</p>
<p>can really help navigate multitasking environments,</p>
<p>especially as it relates to working memory.</p>
<p>And this is true under conditions of stress</p>
<p>and under conditions of not stressful, okay?</p>
<p>You might say, well, isn&rsquo;t multitasking stressful itself?</p>
<p>Yes, it can be.</p>
<p>But when we talk about under conditions of stress,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about people who are sleep deprived,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about people that are under</p>
<p>other kinds of psychological or physical stress,</p>
<p>L-tyrosine can help in that context as well.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned before, in these studies,</p>
<p>they used very high dosages of L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>so high that actually I don&rsquo;t recommend them.</p>
<p>They did measure stress hormones,</p>
<p>they did measure blood pressure and things of that sort,</p>
<p>but I want to caution you, I do not recommend,</p>
<p>I will say it again, I do not recommend</p>
<p>following the dosages that were used in these two studies</p>
<p>because they are exceedingly high.</p>
<p>They used 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight</p>
<p>of tyrosine one hour prior to these cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>Now, I weigh about 220 pounds,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit lighter than that,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s 100 kilograms approximately.</p>
<p>Translated from this study,</p>
<p>that would mean that had I participated in the study</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t in the placebo group,</p>
<p>but I was in the L-tyrosine group,</p>
<p>I would have been given 10,000 milligrams of L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>which is 10 grams of L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>I do not recommend that.</p>
<p>In fact, there are papers showing that</p>
<p>as little as 500 milligrams,</p>
<p>but perhaps up to one gram, that is 1,000 milligrams,</p>
<p>or 1,500 milligrams, a gram and a half of L-tyrosine</p>
<p>taken 30 to 60 minutes before a cognitive or physical task</p>
<p>can increase baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>for extended periods of time</p>
<p>and thereby improve performance</p>
<p>on those mental or physical tasks.</p>
<p>So if you are somebody who&rsquo;s interested</p>
<p>in trying L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>please know that the increases</p>
<p>in baseline levels of dopamine can be substantial.</p>
<p>They are long lasting,</p>
<p>which qualifies them as baseline increases</p>
<p>as opposed to peaks.</p>
<p>And I would say you should also start</p>
<p>with the lowest possible dose.</p>
<p>So for most people, 250 to 500 milligrams</p>
<p>is going to be a reasonable starting dose</p>
<p>depending on your body weight.</p>
<p>Smaller people start with 250, larger, maybe 500.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on whether or not you&rsquo;re combining it</p>
<p>with caffeine or with any other stimulants.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that, again,</p>
<p>the bigger the peak in dopamine,</p>
<p>the bigger the trough in dopamine afterwards.</p>
<p>So pay attention to whether or not you experience a crash</p>
<p>that same day or the next day.</p>
<p>But chances are if you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>a relatively low level of L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>so anywhere from 250, maybe 500 milligrams</p>
<p>or a thousand milligrams of L-tyrosine</p>
<p>prior to cognitive or physical work</p>
<p>and taken early in the day, by the way,</p>
<p>because this can act as a bit of a stimulant,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to achieve these long lasting increases</p>
<p>in baseline dopamine.</p>
<p>But please also keep in mind</p>
<p>that I always, always suggest</p>
<p>that you engage in the proper behaviors</p>
<p>and you disengage from the improper behaviors</p>
<p>as a first line of offense on any health goal.</p>
<p>So now you know how to set your baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>at the highest possible level.</p>
<p>You, of course, want to guard that baseline level</p>
<p>of dopamine very carefully.</p>
<p>So for instance, you want to avoid any kind of behaviors</p>
<p>or substances that are going to peak</p>
<p>your baseline level of dopamine very high or very sharply.</p>
<p>Or if you do engage in those types of behaviors,</p>
<p>whatever they may be, that you are well aware</p>
<p>that your baseline level of dopamine</p>
<p>will drop far below what it was</p>
<p>after that peak has fallen.</p>
<p>You will be essentially in the quote unquote trough.</p>
<p>If however, you find yourself in that trough,</p>
<p>you now have the knowledge to understand</p>
<p>that that trough will resolve if you wait enough time.</p>
<p>That baseline level of dopamine that you were at</p>
<p>prior to the peak will come back.</p>
<p>You will feel better.</p>
<p>However, most people don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, when they feel that low,</p>
<p>that is they feel kind of amotivated,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit depressed,</p>
<p>maybe a lot amotivated or a lot depressed</p>
<p>following some quote unquote peak experience,</p>
<p>what they end up doing is thinking about</p>
<p>what caused that peak experience</p>
<p>and then go back and try to re-engage in the behavior</p>
<p>and try and regenerate that peak experience.</p>
<p>But you now know that that is a terrible strategy.</p>
<p>In fact, that strategy will only lead to diminished peaks</p>
<p>from the same experience.</p>
<p>It will lead to, in many cases,</p>
<p>pursuing more and more intense experiences</p>
<p>to try and recapitulate, recreate that big peak,</p>
<p>which won&rsquo;t work, or even worse,</p>
<p>people start stacking and combining</p>
<p>different dopamine increasing behaviors</p>
<p>in order to try and obtain something like that initial peak.</p>
<p>When in fact, all they need to do,</p>
<p>all you need to do is simply wait</p>
<p>because the way that the dopamine circuitry is arranged</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not just about pleasure, as you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about motivation, desire, pursuit, and pleasure,</p>
<p>and it also has everything to do with pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>Now, when people hear the word pain,</p>
<p>they often think, oh, pain, okay, so a physical pain</p>
<p>or an intense emotional pain.</p>
<p>But today we&rsquo;re going to talk about pain</p>
<p>a little bit differently.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about the pain associated</p>
<p>with the trough in dopamine that occurs</p>
<p>after a big peak in dopamine</p>
<p>as a period in which pain and effort go hand in hand.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll return to this in a moment,</p>
<p>but I want you to just note that in your mind,</p>
<p>kind of earmark that in your mind,</p>
<p>because what we&rsquo;re about to talk about</p>
<p>is how to leverage that pain and to use effort</p>
<p>as a way to not just get out of the trough more quickly,</p>
<p>but actually to get back to a higher level of baseline</p>
<p>as you exit that trough.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I really want to harp on this one point</p>
<p>that I made a moment ago,</p>
<p>which is that after some big experience,</p>
<p>so it could be a vacation or a night out partying</p>
<p>or the birth of a new child,</p>
<p>all of these are well-known phenomena</p>
<p>that lead to troughs or deficits in dopamine afterwards,</p>
<p>which can cause a sort of postpartum depression.</p>
<p>Postpartum depression is a phrase normally used</p>
<p>to describe literally postpartum,</p>
<p>post-birth of a child depression.</p>
<p>And that has many causes,</p>
<p>not just related to dopamine baselines,</p>
<p>although it does involve dopamine baselines,</p>
<p>but it has hormonal aspects and other aspects as well.</p>
<p>But postpartum depression is also used to describe</p>
<p>any time that our baseline dopamine has gone down</p>
<p>way, way below what it was prior to some recent peak</p>
<p>or exciting, exhilarating win or behavior.</p>
<p>A couple of things that one can do</p>
<p>in order to get out of that trough more quickly.</p>
<p>The first one is simply to wait with the understanding</p>
<p>that you will get out.</p>
<p>I know that sounds overly simplistic</p>
<p>and maybe a little bit brutal,</p>
<p>but I think most people don&rsquo;t realize this.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t realize that the dopamine circuitry</p>
<p>does take time to replenish</p>
<p>and it has everything to do with restoring</p>
<p>both the synthesis of dopamine</p>
<p>as well as what&rsquo;s called the readily releasable pool</p>
<p>of dopamine.</p>
<p>So dopamine is packaged in these little spherical things</p>
<p>that we call vesicles.</p>
<p>Those vesicles are released from the ends of nerves.</p>
<p>So in this case, we&rsquo;re talking about the nerves</p>
<p>that originate again in VTA, a nucleus accumbens</p>
<p>and send their little wires up to the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where dopamine is released.</p>
<p>And that readily releasable pool of dopamine</p>
<p>takes time to replenish.</p>
<p>And that can take several days in order to replenish.</p>
<p>Just knowing that can help you through that process.</p>
<p>And of course, then it raises the question,</p>
<p>is there anything that you can do to accelerate that process?</p>
<p>And indeed there is.</p>
<p>And indeed, this is what I consider,</p>
<p>not just something to get you out of a trench</p>
<p>of kind of lower mood and motivation,</p>
<p>but actually what represents the holy grail of motivation.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to talk about this pain effort process</p>
<p>as a very powerful way to get out of sticking points,</p>
<p>but more importantly, to get into a mode</p>
<p>where effort and reward can actually accelerate</p>
<p>your progress along any path to any goal</p>
<p>and in a way that you can do it repeatedly.</p>
<p>And this is not simply taking mechanisms from biology</p>
<p>and painting names on them.</p>
<p>Rather, this is leveraging mechanisms in biology</p>
<p>that are well-defined in the animal and human literature</p>
<p>that have parallels to the addiction</p>
<p>and addiction recovery literature,</p>
<p>but that have been shown in specific circumstances</p>
<p>to really allow people to engage in motivational pursuits</p>
<p>in a variety of contexts, school, relationships, work,</p>
<p>et cetera, in an ongoing way and in a way</p>
<p>that never depletes their baseline of dopamine</p>
<p>to the point where they have to do a lot of extra work</p>
<p>to get it back.</p>
<p>And in a way that allows them to be really motivated</p>
<p>in a variety of contexts in an adaptive way.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>is regardless of your genetics,</p>
<p>regardless of who your parents are,</p>
<p>which obviously you couldn&rsquo;t select,</p>
<p>being able to leverage your dopamine system</p>
<p>in order to be maximally motivated when you want to be</p>
<p>and indeed to avoid procrastination.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to tell you about a classic experiment</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve described once before on this podcast,</p>
<p>but frankly, this experiment is so crucial,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it can be described enough.</p>
<p>This was an experiment that was done at Stanford</p>
<p>many years ago and involved children,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually been repeated in adults.</p>
<p>The experiment involved observing a classroom</p>
<p>of young children, so these were kids</p>
<p>about kindergarten age, a little bit older,</p>
<p>and observing which activities kids like to do</p>
<p>in their free time.</p>
<p>So their structured time where they had to,</p>
<p>these are little kids, so they play blocks</p>
<p>or they had to sing or they had to write</p>
<p>or do what they could, or I suppose draw,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably not writing significant prose at that age,</p>
<p>but then they had free time where they could do</p>
<p>whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>And what the researchers did was observe the children</p>
<p>who selected by their own choice to draw pictures.</p>
<p>So there were some tables out with crayons and markers</p>
<p>and paper, et cetera, and there were some kids</p>
<p>that would just naturally go to that activity every day</p>
<p>because they liked that activity.</p>
<p>And they measured how much of the free time</p>
<p>these children elected to use their free time drawing,</p>
<p>doing these different art projects.</p>
<p>And then what they did was they started introducing rewards</p>
<p>to these children.</p>
<p>They started putting a gold star,</p>
<p>or in some cases, a silver star on their pieces of artwork</p>
<p>and telling them what a good job they did.</p>
<p>And the kids really liked that.</p>
<p>In fact, who wouldn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not only doing an activity that they like,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also getting a reward for it.</p>
<p>So you can probably see where this is all going.</p>
<p>What they were doing was they were increasing</p>
<p>the amount of dopamine that these children experience.</p>
<p>And again, in parallel experiments done with adults,</p>
<p>if you take adults who enjoy a particular activity,</p>
<p>you let them do activity,</p>
<p>and then you start rewarding them for that activity,</p>
<p>especially when you surprise them with a reward</p>
<p>for an activity they already like,</p>
<p>they report that being a much more pleasurable experience</p>
<p>than had they just done the activity.</p>
<p>Then what they did with these children</p>
<p>and in the experiments with adults, done later on,</p>
<p>was they cease giving them the reward.</p>
<p>And then they observe what percentage of their free time</p>
<p>they spend doing that activity, drawing.</p>
<p>And what they observed was, you guessed it,</p>
<p>a drop in the total amount of time</p>
<p>that the children elected to do this activity</p>
<p>that initially they were doing quite a lot.</p>
<p>In other words, their total satisfaction or desire</p>
<p>or motivation to engage in this activity</p>
<p>dropped below what it was prior to ever receiving a reward.</p>
<p>And again, this has been repeated in a variety of contexts,</p>
<p>in different populations, different cultures,</p>
<p>different countries, men, women, boys, girls,</p>
<p>lots of different backgrounds.</p>
<p>So what this tells us is everything you already know,</p>
<p>which is that reward prediction error</p>
<p>is not just about the desire to do something</p>
<p>and you carrying it out and it being pretty good,</p>
<p>amazing, or not good, okay?</p>
<p>I always like to joke that the nervous system</p>
<p>sort of codes things into three bins.</p>
<p>You can think about this in terms of food</p>
<p>or any type of experience.</p>
<p>It can either be yum, yes, I really like that,</p>
<p>yuck, I really don&rsquo;t like that,</p>
<p>or meh, it&rsquo;s kind of so-so.</p>
<p>What the scenario led to where rewards were received</p>
<p>for an activity that people already like to do</p>
<p>and then removed was that an activity</p>
<p>that at one point was a yum becomes a meh.</p>
<p>And that all reflects a drop in baseline dopamine.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the activity that the children or adults liked</p>
<p>combined with the gold star or the monetary reward</p>
<p>or praise that children and adults seem to like</p>
<p>compounded to create a bigger peak in dopamine</p>
<p>and therefore a bigger trough in dopamine.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re already wondering whether or not</p>
<p>their desire to engage in that activity</p>
<p>eventually came back, it did indeed.</p>
<p>So essentially what I described all matches precisely</p>
<p>with dopamine reward prediction error</p>
<p>and the fact that peaks in dopamine</p>
<p>give rise to subsequent troughs in dopamine</p>
<p>that if one waits long enough,</p>
<p>allow baseline levels of dopamine to return to normal.</p>
<p>And of course, the amplitude of that dopamine peak</p>
<p>has been varied by giving more money or less money</p>
<p>in different scenarios.</p>
<p>Nearly all the different derivations of the experiments</p>
<p>that you could imagine that map onto</p>
<p>the dynamics of dopamine release</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about during this episode</p>
<p>all played out exactly as one would have predicted</p>
<p>based on the neural circuitry and the dynamics of dopamine.</p>
<p>I recommend that you leverage this knowledge</p>
<p>to make sure that any activities that you enjoy to do,</p>
<p>whether or not you enjoy it a little or a lot,</p>
<p>but especially if you enjoy it a lot,</p>
<p>that you guard and protect by making sure</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t start layering in or attaching reward</p>
<p>or other sources of dopamine releasing behaviors</p>
<p>or substances to that specific behavior.</p>
<p>Or if you do, that you don&rsquo;t do it terribly often.</p>
<p>Now, how often is terribly often?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to that in a moment,</p>
<p>but let me give you an example from my life</p>
<p>just as an example, but you will likely have</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll know people that will have different examples.</p>
<p>I love to exercise.</p>
<p>I know to some people, this might seem foreign,</p>
<p>but I love to exercise.</p>
<p>I love to do resistance training.</p>
<p>I love to run.</p>
<p>I am not one of those people</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t like the experience of exercising,</p>
<p>but likes the feeling afterwards, quote unquote.</p>
<p>I hear that a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to exercise,</p>
<p>but I love the way I feel afterwards.</p>
<p>I love physical training</p>
<p>and I love the way I feel afterwards,</p>
<p>but I mostly love the feeling during.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m wired that way.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m somebody</p>
<p>who likes to do hard things across the board.</p>
<p>There are plenty of difficult things in life that I dread</p>
<p>or that I&rsquo;m sort of meh about.</p>
<p>But for me, hard exercise, intense exercise</p>
<p>of a particular kind, resistance training</p>
<p>and running in particular, both give me a yum.</p>
<p>Yes, I love this kind of feeling.</p>
<p>And yes, it persists for me quite a long while afterwards,</p>
<p>both for sake of the way that it changes my neurochemistry,</p>
<p>but also my sense of satisfaction,</p>
<p>but I just simply love it.</p>
<p>Now, years ago, I discovered that if I drink</p>
<p>a cup of black coffee or an Americano or a double espresso</p>
<p>or some yerba mate,</p>
<p>that my workouts can be quite a bit more intense.</p>
<p>I can run further.</p>
<p>And then I also discovered that if I were to take</p>
<p>a pre-workout energy drink,</p>
<p>or I took say 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC</p>
<p>and 500 milligrams of phenolethylamine</p>
<p>and perhaps even 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine</p>
<p>and perhaps did that alongside the caffeine</p>
<p>and the yerba mate, then yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>I really liked those workouts.</p>
<p>I could be like a laser in terms of focus.</p>
<p>I could exert even more effort,</p>
<p>put on some music,</p>
<p>and I could achieve even better performance.</p>
<p>And then I also discovered that I could export</p>
<p>that protocol of caffeine, yerba mate,</p>
<p>and various supplements to my cognitive work.</p>
<p>So when I was studying or writing papers</p>
<p>or writing grants or in the laboratory,</p>
<p>when I was doing experiments with my hands in those days,</p>
<p>when, you know, cutting brain tissue and staining it</p>
<p>and working really long hours.</p>
<p>And I discovered that all of those things,</p>
<p>all of those behaviors compounded with my love of exercise</p>
<p>and my love of doing science</p>
<p>and gave me these big peaks</p>
<p>in what to me felt like even important experiences.</p>
<p>They felt, you know, unlike anything else,</p>
<p>they were just so, so peak in their nature,</p>
<p>which was great.</p>
<p>And it did indeed enhance my performance.</p>
<p>However, while it did not create a dependency</p>
<p>for those different substances,</p>
<p>caffeine, supplements, et cetera,</p>
<p>what I noticed was that in the days</p>
<p>and sometimes weekends afterwards,</p>
<p>even though for much of my career,</p>
<p>I confess I&rsquo;ve worked weekends as well,</p>
<p>but I would notice that I&rsquo;d experienced</p>
<p>a real trough in energy.</p>
<p>I just would not feel that good.</p>
<p>And then if I kept up those behaviors consistently</p>
<p>and I was consistently adding in these other,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call them what they are,</p>
<p>dopamine releasing or stimulating behaviors and substances,</p>
<p>that my enthusiasm for physical training or running</p>
<p>or for doing experiments actually started to diminish.</p>
<p>And this was really discouraging to me at the time</p>
<p>because I started to think, okay, maybe I&rsquo;m burnt out.</p>
<p>Maybe I have adrenal burnout,</p>
<p>which by the way, doesn&rsquo;t exist, folks.</p>
<p>Your adrenals don&rsquo;t burn out.</p>
<p>There is something called adrenal insufficiency syndrome.</p>
<p>You can overstimulate your system</p>
<p>by way of too much adrenaline, epinephrine,</p>
<p>and norepinephrine, but that&rsquo;s a separate thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as adrenal burnout per se,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So I thought, gosh, I&rsquo;m really burnt out</p>
<p>when in fact it&rsquo;s now obvious to me what I was doing.</p>
<p>I was combining too many dopamine releasing</p>
<p>or stimulating behaviors and substances</p>
<p>for things that I already enjoy doing as behaviors,</p>
<p>namely exercise and doing experiments,</p>
<p>anything related to science, actually.</p>
<p>So what this means is not to avoid taking things</p>
<p>or doing things that amplify your amount of dopamine,</p>
<p>but to be very cautious about how often one does that</p>
<p>and how many different dopamine stimulating behaviors</p>
<p>or compounds one stacks,</p>
<p>especially in terms of taking those things</p>
<p>or stacking those things in and around behaviors</p>
<p>that you already really enjoy doing.</p>
<p>I was essentially just creating another version</p>
<p>of the kids in nursery school or first grade</p>
<p>with the gold star experiment.</p>
<p>I was basically just doing the exact same thing.</p>
<p>And when I realized that,</p>
<p>and I changed my relationship to those compounds,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t eliminate them altogether,</p>
<p>but I started realizing, for instance,</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t need to double up on yerba mate</p>
<p>and coffee every workout.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would do one, sometimes I would do the other.</p>
<p>Frankly, I always do one or the other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare that I ever do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>without some caffeine first.</p>
<p>And I do my physical training typically</p>
<p>in the early part of the day, so that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t interfere with my sleep.</p>
<p>I might do a hike without caffeine,</p>
<p>but if I&rsquo;m in a weight trainer, I&rsquo;m going to run.</p>
<p>I tend to drink coffee beforehand or have yerba mate.</p>
<p>Or if I occasionally, meaning about once every third,</p>
<p>sometimes every other,</p>
<p>but usually about every third workout,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>Maybe occasionally, maybe every third or fourth workout.</p>
<p>And these are resistance workouts, mind you, not running.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine</p>
<p>or more typically 500 milligrams of phenolethylamine.</p>
<p>And very, very rarely,</p>
<p>maybe once every two or three months,</p>
<p>I might stack all of those things together</p>
<p>prior to a workout.</p>
<p>But of course, I&rsquo;m always mindful</p>
<p>to also include workouts or runs or bouts of cognitive work.</p>
<p>So that could be grant writing,</p>
<p>prepping for a podcast, et cetera,</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t do anything prior.</p>
<p>Maybe just my caffeine,</p>
<p>because I have a baseline level of caffeine</p>
<p>that I use each day to function like many people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a baseline level of caffeine</p>
<p>that just allows us to function</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re a perpetual user of caffeine.</p>
<p>I talked a lot about this on the episode in caffeine.</p>
<p>But the key here is be cautious.</p>
<p>I would say be very cautious about stacking</p>
<p>and layering in too many dopamine peak-inducing behaviors</p>
<p>all at once on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The key point here is if you are somebody</p>
<p>that can engage in these intrinsically</p>
<p>joyful activities for you,</p>
<p>these activities that you&rsquo;re really motivated to do,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s skiing or playing music</p>
<p>or dancing, et cetera,</p>
<p>without the need to layer in additional dopamine</p>
<p>releasing mechanisms or compounds or activities,</p>
<p>well, then I highly recommend you do that</p>
<p>because then you are essentially making yourself</p>
<p>one of those fortunate few</p>
<p>that does not require additional stimuli</p>
<p>and therefore can hold onto that pleasure,</p>
<p>can hold onto that intrinsic pleasure and motivation</p>
<p>to engage in these behaviors over time,</p>
<p>which frankly, there is no replacement for.</p>
<p>There is no pill or bottle or potion or motivational speech</p>
<p>or podcast or book that can replace intrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>Intrinsic motivation is perhaps the holy grail</p>
<p>of all human endeavors and behaviors</p>
<p>because it encompasses so much of what brought us</p>
<p>to this point in our species evolution</p>
<p>and also what brings each and every one of us</p>
<p>closer and closer to our goals.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s happening with enjoyment,</p>
<p>without the need to layer in additional tools,</p>
<p>well, then you have really tapped into the source.</p>
<p>And when I say the source,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean in any kind of mystical way.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s quite clear by now</p>
<p>that when we hear about chi from Eastern medicine</p>
<p>or we talk about motivation, drive, and pursuit</p>
<p>in Western neurobiological languages</p>
<p>that relates to dopamine,</p>
<p>or we hear about the source,</p>
<p>maybe in my podcast episode</p>
<p>with the one and only Rick Rubin,</p>
<p>incredibly productive music producer,</p>
<p>who has just an unbelievable track record</p>
<p>in terms of creative endeavors,</p>
<p>and he talks about the source,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really talking about the same thing,</p>
<p>which is this set of circuits within us</p>
<p>that allow us to identify what we want</p>
<p>and then lean into effort,</p>
<p>and then to do that in a persistent way</p>
<p>that allows us to reach our goals.</p>
<p>And if we can do that with an intrinsic sense of pleasure,</p>
<p>well, that is nothing short of magic.</p>
<p>But of course, it&rsquo;s not magic, it&rsquo;s science.</p>
<p>And of course, most people are not concerned</p>
<p>about trying to protect the things they already enjoy</p>
<p>in order to make sure that they can continue</p>
<p>to do those things and enjoy them.</p>
<p>Most people are thinking about how they can engage</p>
<p>and pursue things that are less than pleasurable to them,</p>
<p>or how they can continue to engage in motivated behaviors</p>
<p>when the going gets tough,</p>
<p>or, and this is a big one,</p>
<p>I hear this over and over again</p>
<p>as a request to cover on this podcast,</p>
<p>how people can overcome procrastination.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re going to talk about now</p>
<p>is how the dynamics of dopamine release</p>
<p>that you already are aware of,</p>
<p>plus an additional dynamic</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t quite talked about,</p>
<p>can allow you to leverage dopamine</p>
<p>in a way that really will bring you</p>
<p>to the holy grail of motivation and drive,</p>
<p>which is when effort starts to become the reward itself.</p>
<p>In other words, when friction becomes the reward.</p>
<p>I know that sounds crazy to some of you,</p>
<p>but when friction becomes the reward,</p>
<p>you can pass from an idea and a goal,</p>
<p>no matter how daunting,</p>
<p>to successful completion of that goal</p>
<p>while experiencing what essentially</p>
<p>will feel like pleasure the entire time.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean it will be bliss the entire time,</p>
<p>but what is very possible is to leverage the dynamics</p>
<p>of both dopamine peaks and dopamine troughs</p>
<p>in order to not just maintain your baseline level</p>
<p>of dopamine, but to also pull yourself out</p>
<p>of any kind of procrastination</p>
<p>or other kind of overthinking trenches very quickly</p>
<p>and get back into a mode of pursuit.</p>
<p>So how do we make effort the reward?</p>
<p>You may have heard about this in the context</p>
<p>of so-called growth mindset.</p>
<p>Growth mindset is the incredible discovery</p>
<p>and research papers from my colleague, Dr. Carol Dweck</p>
<p>in the psychology department at Stanford.</p>
<p>And there are others such as David Yeager</p>
<p>at the University of Texas, Austin,</p>
<p>who have leveraged the so-called growth mindset</p>
<p>as a tool that young people and adults alike can use</p>
<p>in order to get better at anything.</p>
<p>And the basic contour of growth mindset</p>
<p>is to adopt the mindset that if you can&rsquo;t do something</p>
<p>or if you can&rsquo;t do it well,</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t do it or can&rsquo;t do it well yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that word yet that&rsquo;s really key.</p>
<p>And there are a number of different tools and techniques</p>
<p>that people use to adopt growth mindset,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all starts with that relationship</p>
<p>to not being able to do it yet.</p>
<p>Now, that all sounds pretty straightforward</p>
<p>when you tell yourself,</p>
<p>but when we are in a performance context,</p>
<p>when we expect ourselves to be able to motivate</p>
<p>or when we expect ourselves to be able to perform</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t, that often sets up a downward spiral</p>
<p>of motivation because we are so used to being attached</p>
<p>to the relationship between desire, motivation,</p>
<p>and outcomes, reward prediction error.</p>
<p>We want something, we want that A in class,</p>
<p>or we want to learn how to dance,</p>
<p>or we want to be able to do this physical skill</p>
<p>of another kind, or learn a language,</p>
<p>or get the mate we desire, or make the relationship work,</p>
<p>or make the business work, on and on.</p>
<p>And then we get the outcome that we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>and our confidence, for lack of a better word,</p>
<p>drops over time.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, that leads to situations</p>
<p>where we are not motivated, we are A motivated.</p>
<p>It can even lead to situations</p>
<p>where we are downright depressed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also circumstances where people,</p>
<p>myself included, of course, procrastinate.</p>
<p>We know we should do something,</p>
<p>but somehow we can&rsquo;t get motivated.</p>
<p>We know that if we put in the effort, we&rsquo;ll get there,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t do it either because we don&rsquo;t like the activity</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re just not feeling great.</p>
<p>Now, we could be, quote unquote, not feeling great,</p>
<p>not feeling motivated because our dopamine baseline is low.</p>
<p>And so I absolutely encourage everybody</p>
<p>to take a look at themselves</p>
<p>anytime they&rsquo;re in an A motivated state,</p>
<p>take a look at the landscape of their life,</p>
<p>not just at that moment,</p>
<p>but in the preceding days and weeks.</p>
<p>And ask whether or not you&rsquo;ve been tending</p>
<p>to those foundational things that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>whether or not you are engaging any other of the tools</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier</p>
<p>to see if you can get into a motivated state.</p>
<p>However, if all of those boxes are checked,</p>
<p>you answer, yes, I&rsquo;m doing all those things,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just not motivated,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m just, for whatever reason, I just procrastinating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t want to do it,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not feeling motivated.</p>
<p>Well, then there&rsquo;s a very potent set of tools</p>
<p>that you can leverage to overcome states</p>
<p>of lack of motivation, overcome procrastination,</p>
<p>and indeed can help you deal with things like overthinking</p>
<p>as it relates to procrastination</p>
<p>and lack of motivation as well.</p>
<p>So the way this works is the following.</p>
<p>If you recall, a peak in dopamine</p>
<p>is followed by a trough in dopamine.</p>
<p>That trough in dopamine is experienced as pain</p>
<p>or wanting or craving.</p>
<p>That pain that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>is actually a craving or a wanting,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a craving or wanting for a specific state</p>
<p>that you would like to achieve</p>
<p>that is different than the one that you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>You want to get out of that trough.</p>
<p>And as you recall from earlier in the episode,</p>
<p>that trough is the stimulus</p>
<p>for the ongoing release of dopamine</p>
<p>that provides the propeller,</p>
<p>the motivation to go forward and seek some goal, okay?</p>
<p>So when we are not motivated,</p>
<p>when we are in a so-called amotivated state,</p>
<p>or when we are procrastinating,</p>
<p>or when we just sort of can&rsquo;t seem to get in gear,</p>
<p>the key to getting out of that pain trough</p>
<p>is one of two things.</p>
<p>I already told you earlier, you can just wait.</p>
<p>You can wait till your motivation comes back,</p>
<p>and a lot of people do wait.</p>
<p>In fact, they procrastinate.</p>
<p>They start doing other things that are less painful</p>
<p>than the state that they happen to be in</p>
<p>when they are trying to get into gear to go work out,</p>
<p>because they realize not everyone wants to do that,</p>
<p>or to study, or to have a hard conversation,</p>
<p>whatever it is.</p>
<p>And what do they do?</p>
<p>They start engaging in activities that we,</p>
<p>and indeed they, would not consider pleasurable activities.</p>
<p>They start, for instance, cleaning the house.</p>
<p>So seemingly out of nowhere,</p>
<p>they start engaging in these activities</p>
<p>that normally are not intrinsically pleasurable for them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not highly motivated to do them,</p>
<p>as a replacement for doing the very thing</p>
<p>that they quote-unquote need to do, or ought to do,</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re procrastinating to do.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re essentially doing here</p>
<p>is a mild type of addiction replacement.</p>
<p>In other words, rather than be in the painful state</p>
<p>and wait for it to pass,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing things that give them</p>
<p>some sense of accomplishment,</p>
<p>ostensibly to give them the sense</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re completing things.</p>
<p>And perhaps, and I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not in the psychology</p>
<p>of knowing what other people are thinking,</p>
<p>perhaps in order to generate the momentum,</p>
<p>in order to get engaged enough, or motivated enough</p>
<p>to study, or work out, or whatever activity it is</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re trying to avoid through procrastination.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting about this dynamic is,</p>
<p>first of all, it&rsquo;s extremely common,</p>
<p>and second of all, a lot of people will use this</p>
<p>as a tactic so that they get very close</p>
<p>to the deadline to complete something,</p>
<p>and then they go into a sort of pseudo-panic,</p>
<p>and then use anxiety as a way to leverage</p>
<p>their mental and physical resources to complete that thing.</p>
<p>Now, how do I know the contour of this so well?</p>
<p>How do I understand the inner dynamics of it?</p>
<p>Well, part of that relates to my work as a neurobiologist</p>
<p>and reading the papers that I&rsquo;ll mention to you in a moment,</p>
<p>but it also relates to the fact</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m somebody who waits quite a while,</p>
<p>right up until the sort of last minute possible</p>
<p>to complete something for activities</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t want to do,</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;ve been working on my whole life.</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;m very familiar</p>
<p>with the procrastination process.</p>
<p>So how can we overcome procrastination?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that there are findings</p>
<p>from within the addiction literature</p>
<p>that turn out to be very powerful</p>
<p>towards leveraging our way out of procrastination.</p>
<p>And it has to do with this.</p>
<p>You already know, because I&rsquo;ve told you</p>
<p>probably a dozen times now,</p>
<p>that the depth of the trough after a dopamine peak</p>
<p>is proportional to how high that peak was</p>
<p>and how steep it was, how quickly that peak occurred.</p>
<p>It turns out that not only is the depth of the trough</p>
<p>proportional to that,</p>
<p>but the rate at which you get out of that trough</p>
<p>is proportional to how steep that trough is.</p>
<p>Let me explain this for you</p>
<p>in as clear terms as I possibly can.</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re in an amotivated state.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not feeling motivated, you&rsquo;re procrastinating.</p>
<p>You may think, okay, the thing to do here is something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll clean the house, I&rsquo;ll take care of some bills,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do something, or I&rsquo;ll just wait.</p>
<p>Those approaches, as we talked about before,</p>
<p>generally don&rsquo;t work, or at least don&rsquo;t work quickly,</p>
<p>or they lead you right up to the deadline,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the deadline that forces you</p>
<p>to get something done,</p>
<p>or you just don&rsquo;t get it done</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t succeed in your goal.</p>
<p>That happens a lot as well.</p>
<p>However, if you were to take that state</p>
<p>of being unmotivated, of procrastinating,</p>
<p>and actually do something that&rsquo;s harder</p>
<p>than being in that amotivated state,</p>
<p>in other words, doing something that&rsquo;s more effortful,</p>
<p>even painful, you can rebound yourself</p>
<p>out of that dopamine trough much more quickly.</p>
<p>So what do I mean you want to put yourself in a state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s worse than or harder than the state that you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>or do something, quote unquote, more painful?</p>
<p>And here I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this three times,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to say it for the first time now.</p>
<p>When I say more painful,</p>
<p>I do not mean doing any kind of tissue damaging</p>
<p>or psychologically damaging behavior</p>
<p>or anything of that sort that&rsquo;s going to render you injured</p>
<p>or not well, even in the short term.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m referring to, okay?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just get that one out of the way.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to is the fact that, for instance,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re feeling amotivated,</p>
<p>but you find yourself cleaning the house</p>
<p>as a way to procrastinate,</p>
<p>you can say, well, cleaning the house is harder</p>
<p>than sitting down and doing nothing,</p>
<p>but actually in that moment or in those moments,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the case, or else you wouldn&rsquo;t be doing it.</p>
<p>The reality is that the dopamine system works</p>
<p>according to what feels hard or easy in the moment.</p>
<p>In other words, if you&rsquo;re feeling amotivated,</p>
<p>you need to do something and put yourself into a state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s harder than the state you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re sitting around</p>
<p>feeling amotivated or you find yourself</p>
<p>tending to tasks that are irrelevant to the goal</p>
<p>that you really should be focused on,</p>
<p>you need to put your body and mind</p>
<p>into a state of discomfort quickly.</p>
<p>And the way to do that is to either engage</p>
<p>in some tangential activity,</p>
<p>meaning an activity not related to your goal</p>
<p>that puts your body into a very different state.</p>
<p>So here again, I&rsquo;ll default to the obvious one,</p>
<p>which is something like cold shower or cold immersion,</p>
<p>which not only increases dopamine long-term</p>
<p>or over several hours rather,</p>
<p>but for most people is experienced as pain.</p>
<p>That pain causes a rebound out of that dopamine trough</p>
<p>faster than it would occur</p>
<p>if you had just stayed in that amotivated state</p>
<p>and waited for it to go away</p>
<p>or done something like cleaning up</p>
<p>that for whatever reason</p>
<p>felt like it required less friction.</p>
<p>When I say friction, I mean limbic friction.</p>
<p>Your limbic system is always in this dialogue</p>
<p>with your forebrain and limbic friction goes two ways.</p>
<p>Limbic friction can be you&rsquo;re tired</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to do something.</p>
<p>And so you have to quote unquote motivate to do it,</p>
<p>energize yourself to do it.</p>
<p>Or limbic friction can be that you&rsquo;re nervous and scared</p>
<p>and anxious to do something</p>
<p>and you have to calm yourself</p>
<p>in order to lean forward into action</p>
<p>in order to do that thing despite the anxiety.</p>
<p>I realized this can be a little bit confusing as a concept.</p>
<p>So I want to go into a bit more detail.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that you or somebody else</p>
<p>does not like to exercise.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to exercise</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to get your minimum</p>
<p>of five days per week exercise</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just not motivated to do it.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different techniques to doing this.</p>
<p>Assuming you&rsquo;ve taken care of all the baseline stuff,</p>
<p>all the foundational stuff we talked about earlier</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just not getting in gear</p>
<p>and you find yourself checking your phone</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re tending to some tasks.</p>
<p>Obviously those things are quote unquote easier for you,</p>
<p>meaning they cause less limbic friction</p>
<p>than engaging in exercise.</p>
<p>The typical advice would be just exercise for one minute.</p>
<p>Okay, just get one minute of exercise or five minutes</p>
<p>and then use the successful completion</p>
<p>of that one or five minutes as a milestone</p>
<p>that allows you to then move to the next milestone.</p>
<p>And indeed that approach can work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m describing here</p>
<p>when I say that you&rsquo;re in a state of lack of motivation</p>
<p>or procrastination or both,</p>
<p>and you need to put yourself into a more painful,</p>
<p>not less painful state.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>You push up against that friction</p>
<p>and you exercise for a short while</p>
<p>and then that pops you out of that trough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s possible, but for a lot of people,</p>
<p>even that won&rsquo;t be possible</p>
<p>because they just can&rsquo;t get motivated</p>
<p>or they do that one minute or five minutes</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re just like, okay, I&rsquo;m still in the trough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually feeling that great.</p>
<p>In those circumstances, it makes sense</p>
<p>to do something that&rsquo;s tangential</p>
<p>to the whole path that you&rsquo;re trying to pursue,</p>
<p>this goal that you&rsquo;re trying to pursue.</p>
<p>That is, believe it or not,</p>
<p>much worse than just being a motivated.</p>
<p>And when I say worse, I don&rsquo;t mean picking some task</p>
<p>that normally you don&rsquo;t like to do,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re willing to do.</p>
<p>I mean, literally thinking about what would be worse</p>
<p>than being in this state?</p>
<p>Again, without causing yourself tissue</p>
<p>or psychological damage, what would be worse?</p>
<p>Well, cold water would be worse for many people,</p>
<p>very cold water.</p>
<p>So the key is to figure out something that,</p>
<p>for lack of a better way to put it, really sucks,</p>
<p>really sucks, and yet is safe.</p>
<p>And by doing that, you steepen the trough,</p>
<p>you steepen the slope of the trough,</p>
<p>which we know brings you back</p>
<p>to your baseline level of dopamine more quickly.</p>
<p>Now, for some people that will be deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>through cold shower, ice bath.</p>
<p>And I have to tell you that if you&rsquo;re cringing</p>
<p>as I say this, well then, there you go.</p>
<p>You now have a tool that you know,</p>
<p>you cringe even when you just think about,</p>
<p>and therefore represents a great tool for you.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m procrastinating to do something</p>
<p>I really need to do, should I just simply wait</p>
<p>for that procrastination to evaporate?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Will it eventually evaporate?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Will a deadline eventually surface that will trigger me</p>
<p>into an anxious or activated state that will allow me</p>
<p>to complete what needs to be done?</p>
<p>Maybe, hopefully.</p>
<p>But better would be to get out of that amotivated state,</p>
<p>that state of procrastination quickly.</p>
<p>And to do so, you need to leverage something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>So for instance, I heard a beautiful lecture recently</p>
<p>done by Dr. Ana Lemke at Stanford School of Medicine</p>
<p>discussing dopamine and some of the things in her book</p>
<p>and some newer findings as well.</p>
<p>And somebody in the audience asked her the question,</p>
<p>does meditation increase dopamine?</p>
<p>Now, earlier we talked about how non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>and yoga nidra has been shown in the scientific literature</p>
<p>to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>But I also mentioned earlier that classic forms</p>
<p>of meditation, whether eyes open or eyes closed,</p>
<p>so-called open monitoring or closed monitoring meditation,</p>
<p>sitting there or lying there and focusing,</p>
<p>does not increase dopamine levels per se.</p>
<p>However, for most people, especially people who find it</p>
<p>hard to meditate or who don&rsquo;t do that practice very often,</p>
<p>meditation is effortful.</p>
<p>Getting into meditation and staying in meditation</p>
<p>is effortful.</p>
<p>So if you find yourself in a state of procrastination,</p>
<p>oftentimes a brief five to 10 minute meditation</p>
<p>where you absolutely do not allow yourself to do anything</p>
<p>besides close your eyes, focus on your breath.</p>
<p>And when your mind drifts, get back to your breath</p>
<p>is not only extremely difficult and extremely frustrating,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re a well-practiced meditator,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s often difficult and frustrating,</p>
<p>not just to do, but to get into that practice.</p>
<p>And not just to get into that practice,</p>
<p>but to maintain that practice</p>
<p>for that mere five to 10 minutes,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just not a natural state for us to be in.</p>
<p>We have to force ourselves.</p>
<p>So it is effortful.</p>
<p>In fact, it qualifies as a basically available</p>
<p>almost anywhere, anytime type of effortful activity</p>
<p>that if you dislike it, perhaps even as much</p>
<p>as some people dislike deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>well then, perfect.</p>
<p>You now have an additional tool in your kit</p>
<p>that you can use anytime you are feeling</p>
<p>amotivated and procrastinating.</p>
<p>Now, there are numerous examples I could give.</p>
<p>And hopefully there are numerous examples</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re thinking about.</p>
<p>The key is to have a short list</p>
<p>of about five different effortful,</p>
<p>aka painful activities that you can employ</p>
<p>anytime you&rsquo;re feeling amotivated</p>
<p>or in a state of procrastination.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that the goal is not what you accomplish</p>
<p>inside of that activity.</p>
<p>Although it is important that you actually engage</p>
<p>in that activity.</p>
<p>I actually have to make myself meditate</p>
<p>in that five to 10 minute bout</p>
<p>of effortful or painful activity.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not about achieving an outcome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about forcing your body and mind</p>
<p>into a deeper state of pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>In other words, taking yourself from that trough</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re already in and steepening</p>
<p>and deepening that trough.</p>
<p>Because in steepening and deepening that trough,</p>
<p>we know that the return from that trough</p>
<p>to normal and even elevated levels of baseline dopamine</p>
<p>is going to be faster and more robust.</p>
<p>And in doing that, you will quickly find yourself</p>
<p>back into a motivated state.</p>
<p>Because not only does it teach you</p>
<p>that doing hard things is possible,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of a more of a subjective cognitive learning,</p>
<p>but it actually taps into the very neurochemical system</p>
<p>that allows you to then feel motivated and capable</p>
<p>to pursue the larger goal,</p>
<p>which is the thing you&rsquo;re really concerned about after all.</p>
<p>So as is often the case, perhaps always the case,</p>
<p>on this podcast, we covered a lot of material.</p>
<p>We covered dopamine and what it is.</p>
<p>We talked about the circuitry</p>
<p>and the different kinds of circuitry,</p>
<p>focusing mainly on this mesocortical pathway</p>
<p>that is so vitally important to motivation for any goals.</p>
<p>Talked about the relationship between peaks and troughs</p>
<p>and baselines and the foundational tools</p>
<p>that allow us to set and maintain</p>
<p>a healthy baseline level of dopamine,</p>
<p>as well as ways to protect that baseline level of dopamine.</p>
<p>And we talked about how to get ourselves</p>
<p>out of states of procrastination and amotivation</p>
<p>by not just waiting out those troughs in dopamine,</p>
<p>but actually making those troughs in dopamine steeper</p>
<p>by engaging in things that are effortful</p>
<p>and things that we really don&rsquo;t want to do in those moments,</p>
<p>provided that those things are safe.</p>
<p>We can get out of those dopamine troughs more quickly</p>
<p>and back to our dopamine baseline or even above baseline.</p>
<p>And we talked about what I really view</p>
<p>as the holy grail of motivation,</p>
<p>which is to be able to learn to attach reward</p>
<p>to the effort process itself and to do so</p>
<p>by not just understanding,</p>
<p>but also learning to subjectively recognize</p>
<p>and somatically experience release</p>
<p>of these different stressful chemicals within our body.</p>
<p>I realized this was a lot of information</p>
<p>and yet throughout, I&rsquo;ve tried to highlight tools</p>
<p>that you can use that range from behavioral</p>
<p>to nutritional, supplementation tools, cognitive tools.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that all of these different segments</p>
<p>of the podcast is always our timestamp.</p>
<p>So if you feel the need to go back and listen</p>
<p>to any of these in order to get clearer understanding,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve made that easy to do so.</p>
<p>So simply look for the timestamps in the show note captions.</p>
