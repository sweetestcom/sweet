about the seven ways that you can boost your testosterone these are natural things you can do the first thing is to make sure you do not lower your cholesterol you want to increase your cholesterol do not go on a low fat diet why because cholesterol is the precursor the building blocks that help make testosterone and that&amp;rsquo;s one of the problems too when your doc puts you on statins statins block cholesterol which then end up lowering testosterone and that is one big challenge so i&amp;rsquo;m not telling you not to take your statin all i&amp;rsquo;m saying is that you might want to research it get with your doctor and find out the real reason why your cholesterol might be high and i have some videos on that instead of just treating the symptom let&amp;rsquo;s find out what the actual cause is but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go low on the cholesterol if you want high testosterone let&amp;rsquo;s talk about protein moderate protein a myth is that you need a lot of protein to stimulate your testosterone no you need a moderate amount now what&amp;rsquo;s a moderate amount well i&amp;rsquo;d say about between six to eight ounces per meal now i&amp;rsquo;m talking about the weight of the actual food like a piece of steak or a hamburger or something like that i&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the grams within that because the grams within that is a lot less i do have quite a few videos on protein i&amp;rsquo;ll put some down below if you want more information on that but you just want to avoid too much protein if you consume too much protein you&amp;rsquo;re going to get tired and the reason why you&amp;rsquo;re going to get tired is that your like half of it can easily be turned into glucose so when you turn it into glucose because your body doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily use amino acids as its fuel some but not much it has to be converted into glucose to be used as fuel so that excess amount of insulin that&amp;rsquo;s triggered by the glucose is going to block your testosterone so just do a moderate amount of protein number three you want to go low carbs for the same reason because carbs increase insulin so if we keep our insulin low we can enhance testosterone and other beneficial hormones like growth hormone number four exercise will stimulate testosterone if it&amp;rsquo;s high intensity and oval training or exercise involving the whole body to the point where you&amp;rsquo;re sweating but not over training but the problem is if you&amp;rsquo;re not sleeping you don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that okay because it&amp;rsquo;s going to strain your heart you want to do long walks for a while to lower the cortisol so you can sleep so you can eventually add more exercise to then increase more testosterone now just as a side note and i didn&amp;rsquo;t put this on this chart is that i always recommend when you do low carb it&amp;rsquo;s called keto you also do intermittent fasting intermittent fasting improves growth hormone and wherever growth hormone goes testosterone goes it tends to follow similar pathways and so intermittent fasting is vital to keep your testosterone levels normal because if you&amp;rsquo;re doing snacks and frequent meals you&amp;rsquo;re just going to increase insulin and suppress testosterone that is why a pre-diabetic or someone with insulin resistance or a diabetic normally always has low testosterone and that&amp;rsquo;s going to affect your muscle mass and it&amp;rsquo;s going to affect your libido and your energy number five sleep very very important why because we want to keep our cortisol lower increase cortisol the stress hormone we lower testosterone we also want to keep estrogen on the low side so you want to avoid soy products especially soy protein isolates which is in a lot of diet foods and like the fake meat and things like that and then you want to avoid things that increase estrogen so you want to do organic because pesticides insecticides act like estrogen in the body they&amp;rsquo;re called estrogen mimickers or endocrine disruptors there are certain supplements that can also help you as well the most important one is zinc about 100 milligrams per day this will actually work very well another good one that i recommend is the korean red ginseng this not only improves testosterone but it&amp;rsquo;s going to improve your energy it&amp;rsquo;s going to give you a sense of calmness it&amp;rsquo;ll give you stamina it&amp;rsquo;ll give you vitality it&amp;rsquo;s a really really good herb it&amp;rsquo;s been used for a very long long time with great success l-arginine will increase something called nitric oxide which can increase testosterone it&amp;rsquo;s a good supplement but remember any time you&amp;rsquo;re doing supplements they may not work if your diet isn&amp;rsquo;t corrected and if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what to eat i put a link down below and then we have something called d aspartic acid another really good compound to help increase testosterone last few points if you have a fatty liver and you&amp;rsquo;re looking down you have a gut you have a fatty liver that&amp;rsquo;s going to inhibit your ability to make testosterone so you want to work on removing the fat from your liver by doing a moderate protein low-carb ketogenic diet also if your iron is too high that can suppress your testosterone and it can destroy your liver so i always recommend if you&amp;rsquo;re male not to take iron supplements and even post-menopausal women who are no longer menstruating should be careful too because iron in excess is very harmful to your liver and hormones and it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult for your body to get rid of iron so you want to be careful not to get it in supplements which you might even not be aware of when you read the label it&amp;rsquo;s like wow i&amp;rsquo;ve been taking all this iron no i wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend that and statins i already talked about that point all right there you go seven ways to boost your testosterone hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system

your testosterone these are natural things you can  </p><p>do the first thing is to make sure you do not 
lower your cholesterol you want to increase  </p><p>your cholesterol do not go on a low fat diet why 
because cholesterol is the precursor the building  </p><p>blocks that help make testosterone and that&rsquo;s 
one of the problems too when your doc puts you  </p><p>on statins statins block cholesterol which then 
end up lowering testosterone and that is one big  </p><p>challenge so i&rsquo;m not telling you not to take 
your statin all i&rsquo;m saying is that you might  </p><p>want to research it get with your doctor and find 
out the real reason why your cholesterol might be  </p><p>high and i have some videos on that instead of 
just treating the symptom let&rsquo;s find out what  </p><p>the actual cause is but you don&rsquo;t want to go low 
on the cholesterol if you want high testosterone  </p><p>let&rsquo;s talk about protein moderate protein a myth 
is that you need a lot of protein to stimulate  </p><p>your testosterone no you need a moderate amount 
now what&rsquo;s a moderate amount well i&rsquo;d say about  </p><p>between six to eight ounces per meal now i&rsquo;m 
talking about the weight of the actual food  </p><p>like a piece of steak or a hamburger or something 
like that i&rsquo;m not talking about the grams within  </p><p>that because the grams within that is a lot less 
i do have quite a few videos on protein i&rsquo;ll put  </p><p>some down below if you want more information on 
that but you just want to avoid too much protein  </p><p>if you consume too much protein you&rsquo;re 
going to get tired and the reason why  </p><p>you&rsquo;re going to get tired is that your like 
half of it can easily be turned into glucose  </p><p>so when you turn it into glucose because 
your body doesn&rsquo;t necessarily use amino acids  </p><p>as its fuel some but not much it has to 
be converted into glucose to be used as  </p><p>fuel so that excess amount of insulin that&rsquo;s 
triggered by the glucose is going to block  </p><p>your testosterone so just do a moderate amount of 
protein number three you want to go low carbs for  </p><p>the same reason because carbs increase insulin 
so if we keep our insulin low we can enhance  </p><p>testosterone and other beneficial hormones like 
growth hormone number four exercise will stimulate  </p><p>testosterone if it&rsquo;s high intensity and oval 
training or exercise involving the whole body  </p><p>to the point where you&rsquo;re sweating but not over 
training but the problem is if you&rsquo;re not sleeping  </p><p>you don&rsquo;t want to do that okay because it&rsquo;s 
going to strain your heart you want to do long  </p><p>walks for a while to lower the cortisol so you can 
sleep so you can eventually add more exercise to  </p><p>then increase more testosterone now just as a side 
note and i didn&rsquo;t put this on this chart is that i  </p><p>always recommend when you do low carb it&rsquo;s called 
keto you also do intermittent fasting intermittent  </p><p>fasting improves growth hormone and wherever 
growth hormone goes testosterone goes it tends  </p><p>to follow similar pathways and so intermittent 
fasting is vital to keep your testosterone levels  </p><p>normal because if you&rsquo;re doing snacks and frequent 
meals you&rsquo;re just going to increase insulin and  </p><p>suppress testosterone that is why a pre-diabetic 
or someone with insulin resistance or a diabetic  </p><p>normally always has low testosterone and that&rsquo;s 
going to affect your muscle mass and it&rsquo;s going  </p><p>to affect your libido and your energy number five 
sleep very very important why because we want to  </p><p>keep our cortisol lower increase cortisol 
the stress hormone we lower testosterone we  </p><p>also want to keep estrogen on the low side so you 
want to avoid soy products especially soy protein  </p><p>isolates which is in a lot of diet foods and like 
the fake meat and things like that and then you  </p><p>want to avoid things that increase estrogen 
so you want to do organic because pesticides  </p><p>insecticides act like estrogen in the body they&rsquo;re 
called estrogen mimickers or endocrine disruptors  </p><p>there are certain supplements that can also 
help you as well the most important one is zinc  </p><p>about 100 milligrams per day this will actually 
work very well another good one that i recommend  </p><p>is the korean red ginseng this not only improves 
testosterone but it&rsquo;s going to improve your energy  </p><p>it&rsquo;s going to give you a sense of calmness it&rsquo;ll 
give you stamina it&rsquo;ll give you vitality it&rsquo;s a  </p><p>really really good herb it&rsquo;s been used for a very 
long long time with great success l-arginine will  </p><p>increase something called nitric oxide which 
can increase testosterone it&rsquo;s a good supplement  </p><p>but remember any time you&rsquo;re doing supplements 
they may not work if your diet isn&rsquo;t corrected  </p><p>and if you don&rsquo;t know what to eat i put a link 
down below and then we have something called d  </p><p>aspartic acid another really good compound to 
help increase testosterone last few points if  </p><p>you have a fatty liver and you&rsquo;re looking down you 
have a gut you have a fatty liver that&rsquo;s going to  </p><p>inhibit your ability to make testosterone so you 
want to work on removing the fat from your liver  </p><p>by doing a moderate protein low-carb ketogenic 
diet also if your iron is too high that can  </p><p>suppress your testosterone and it can destroy your 
liver so i always recommend if you&rsquo;re male not to  </p><p>take iron supplements and even post-menopausal 
women who are no longer menstruating should be  </p><p>careful too because iron in excess is very harmful 
to your liver and hormones and it&rsquo;s very difficult  </p><p>for your body to get rid of iron so you want to 
be careful not to get it in supplements which  </p><p>you might even not be aware of when you read the 
label it&rsquo;s like wow i&rsquo;ve been taking all this iron  </p><p>no i wouldn&rsquo;t recommend that and statins i already 
talked about that point all right there you go  </p><p>seven ways to boost your testosterone hey before 
you go real quick i have a course entitled how  </p><p>to bulletproof your immune system it&rsquo;s a free 
course i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why  </p><p>here&rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone

strengthening your immune system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s  </p><p>missing this course will show you how to
