    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>So far in this podcast, we&rsquo;ve looked at the oldest ancestor of English, the ancient</p>
<p>Indo-European language.</p>
<p>And in the last couple of episodes, I looked at some of the words that have been reconstructed</p>
<p>in that language.</p>
<p>Remember that the original Indo-European language was not written down.</p>
<p>It existed long before the alphabet, and there is no evidence of a written form of the original</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>So, pretty much everything we know about that language comes from reconstructed elements</p>
<p>of the language, like the words that we&rsquo;ve looked at previously.</p>
<p>In this episode, I want to look at one other aspect of that original language, the way</p>
<p>in which the Indo-Europeans used those words.</p>
<p>In other words, I want to explore a few aspects of their grammar.</p>
<p>This may not seem as interesting as the words which have come down to us in modern English,</p>
<p>but this original Indo-European grammar is very important to our understanding of how</p>
<p>Old English grammar worked because much of Old English grammar was inherited from this</p>
<p>original language.</p>
<p>One other quick note before we get started.</p>
<p>In the next episode, I&rsquo;m going to try to pinpoint exactly who these original Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>were.</p>
<p>This has been the subject of much debate and controversy for over two centuries.</p>
<p>But a general consensus has emerged over the past few decades.</p>
<p>And this view is based on the accumulation of lots of pieces of evidence, like the words</p>
<p>that these people used.</p>
<p>I mentioned a few of these clues in the earlier episodes of the podcast.</p>
<p>So next time, I&rsquo;ll put all these pieces together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like an episode of CSI.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to try to solve this ancient mystery.</p>
<p>And then, once we&rsquo;ve identified who these people were and where they lived, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to explore how and why they migrated to the various places where the later Indo-European</p>
<p>languages emerged.</p>
<p>After that, I&rsquo;m going to spend an episode or two on the early Indo-European Greeks,</p>
<p>then an episode or two on the early Indo-European Latin speakers, the Romans, and probably one</p>
<p>episode on the early Celts.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll spend a little time talking about the early Germanic tribes from which</p>
<p>the Anglo-Saxons emerged.</p>
<p>And that will conclude our look at Pre-English, what I&rsquo;m calling Volume 1 of the podcast.</p>
<p>And after that, we&rsquo;ll start Volume 2 of the podcast by looking specifically at the</p>
<p>arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in Britain and the development of Old English.</p>
<p>So if you were curious about where we&rsquo;re headed, now you know.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at the grammar of these original Indo-Europeans, or at least a couple of aspects</p>
<p>which relate to the history of English.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a native English speaker and you&rsquo;ve ever tried to learn another European language,</p>
<p>one of the first things you probably discovered, much to your chagrin, was that all nouns are</p>
<p>either masculine or feminine or, in some languages, neutral.</p>
<p>This is the idea that every noun is either a boy or a girl or neither.</p>
<p>This fact tends to drive English speakers crazy because English is somewhat unique among</p>
<p>European languages in that it does not make those distinctions.</p>
<p>A noun is a noun is a noun in English.</p>
<p>But other European languages make this distinction.</p>
<p>And they make it because the original Indo-European language also made the same distinction.</p>
<p>But English abandoned the distinction between masculine and feminine nouns a long time ago.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s explore this a little bit further.</p>
<p>In English, most nouns are preceded by either a or the in a sentence.</p>
<p>These are called articles.</p>
<p>And we use them regardless of whether the noun is singular or plural and without regard</p>
<p>to whether the thing is masculine or feminine.</p>
<p>So in the case of the, we have the girl and the boy.</p>
<p>So no distinction is made for masculine or feminine.</p>
<p>Then we say the girls and the boys.</p>
<p>Again, no distinction for the fact that the nouns are plural.</p>
<p>The the is always the.</p>
<p>But in French, you have to use either le or la or les for masculine singular, feminine</p>
<p>singular or plural.</p>
<p>In Spanish, you have to use either el or la or las or los.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a masculine singular version, a feminine singular version, a masculine plural</p>
<p>version, and a feminine plural version.</p>
<p>And every noun has to be classified in this manner.</p>
<p>So a French house is feminine, la maison.</p>
<p>But a French hat is masculine, le chapeau.</p>
<p>Again, in English, it&rsquo;s just the house and the hat.</p>
<p>The same rule applies for the Article A.</p>
<p>In English, it&rsquo;s always a, a house, a car, a girl or a boy.</p>
<p>In French, it&rsquo;s either un or une.</p>
<p>In Spanish, it&rsquo;s either un or una.</p>
<p>Well, at least French and Spanish only use two versions, masculine and feminine.</p>
<p>Modern German most closely resembles the original Indo-European language in that it has three</p>
<p>genders, masculine, feminine, and neutral or neuter.</p>
<p>So all of this stuff, which tends to drive English speakers crazy, comes directly from</p>
<p>the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>Because the original Indo-European speakers did the same thing.</p>
<p>They made the same distinctions.</p>
<p>The reason why English dropped the distinctions between masculine and feminine has to do with</p>
<p>issues which we&rsquo;ll address in a future episode.</p>
<p>But it was basically a way to simplify the language to facilitate communication between</p>
<p>different speakers in Britain.</p>
<p>But other Indo-European languages have retained these distinctions.</p>
<p>Now even though I used the articles a and the to illustrate the distinctions between</p>
<p>masculine and feminine, the fact is that the original Indo-European language didn&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>articles at all.</p>
<p>There was no a or the before a noun in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>An original Indo-European speaker would say something like, horse is fast, rather than</p>
<p>the horse is fast.</p>
<p>But Indo-European speakers would have put a specific ending on the word horse to indicate</p>
<p>that it was the subject of the sentence.</p>
<p>In fact, these endings were found throughout the language to indicate gender, tense, number,</p>
<p>case, and so on.</p>
<p>And this is probably the most important point that I want to make in this episode.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m introducing a concept that is essential to understanding the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language, and for that matter, essential to understanding Old English, Latin, and most</p>
<p>of the other languages that we&rsquo;ll be discussing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the concept of inflections.</p>
<p>In earlier episodes, I casually mentioned that Latin had a lot of endings.</p>
<p>Endings like the um in kentum, which was eventually dropped in French when the word just became</p>
<p>c-e-n-t, and the i-s in dentis, which was dropped and the word eventually became d-e-n-t,</p>
<p>meaning tooth.</p>
<p>These endings were inflections.</p>
<p>Latin had them, Old English had them, and the ancient Indo-European language had them.</p>
<p>And many modern European languages, like German, still have them, lots of them.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the things that makes the study of German so difficult is the need to</p>
<p>learn and master all of those inflections.</p>
<p>These endings, or inflections, are one of the most important features of Indo-European</p>
<p>grammar.</p>
<p>An inflection is basically a modification of a word to indicate something specific about</p>
<p>the word in a sentence.</p>
<p>For example, to indicate whether the sentence is describing something which is happening</p>
<p>right now, present tense, or something which happened yesterday, past tense, or something</p>
<p>that will happen tomorrow, future tense.</p>
<p>It might also tell you which noun is the subject of the sentence and which is the object.</p>
<p>In other words, which noun is doing the action and which noun is receiving the action.</p>
<p>Now, as I said, all Indo-European languages have some inflections because the original</p>
<p>Indo-European language used lots of them.</p>
<p>And today, some have lots more than others.</p>
<p>Latin has lots of them, and as I said, modern German still has lots of them, as does modern</p>
<p>Russian.</p>
<p>These languages are therefore called highly inflexive languages.</p>
<p>But English is at the other end of the spectrum of European languages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotten rid of most, but not all, of its inflections.</p>
<p>But when we look at certain non-Indo-European languages, like Chinese, for example, they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have any inflections at all.</p>
<p>So Chinese is called a non-inflexive language, or sometimes called an isolating language.</p>
<p>This means that the noun and the verb forms don&rsquo;t change based on number, gender, past</p>
<p>tense, future tense, etc.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it can be written down in characters rather than letters.</p>
<p>Letters allow you to modify the spelling of a word depending on how it&rsquo;s used.</p>
<p>Like the words be and being and been.</p>
<p>In Chinese, the word itself doesn&rsquo;t change, so you can always use the same character.</p>
<p>New words are added to indicate things like past tense and future tense.</p>
<p>And when we add a new word, that&rsquo;s not an inflection.</p>
<p>An inflection occurs when we actually change the word itself to give this information,</p>
<p>usually by adding something to the end, but sometimes changing the middle or some other</p>
<p>part of the word.</p>
<p>So for example, the words am, is, are, was, were, been, being, those are all inflections</p>
<p>of the modern English word be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very old word, so it&rsquo;s retained a lot of its original inflexive versions, albeit</p>
<p>in modified forms.</p>
<p>And words like jump, jumping, and jumped are also inflections because each is a modified</p>
<p>version of that original word jump.</p>
<p>Now the funny thing is, in modern English, we can often express the same idea, or at</p>
<p>least a very similar idea, with either an inflection or without an inflection.</p>
<p>The inflexive version can usually be traced back to Old English, and the non-inflexive</p>
<p>version is typically a later development.</p>
<p>So if we want to express past tense, we can say, the horse jumped the fence.</p>
<p>That uses an inflection.</p>
<p>I modified the word jump by adding an ed at the end to let you know that it happened in</p>
<p>the past.</p>
<p>But I could have said essentially the same thing without an inflection, in other words,</p>
<p>without changing the verb, the word jump, at all.</p>
<p>For example, the horse did jump the fence.</p>
<p>This also expresses past tense, but I didn&rsquo;t change the word jump at all.</p>
<p>Instead, I added a new word, the word did.</p>
<p>So did jump is not inflexive because the word jump stays the same.</p>
<p>But jumped is inflexive because the word is modified by adding an ed at the end.</p>
<p>Of course, in modern English, there is no inflection for future tense.</p>
<p>We can only express future tense without an inflection.</p>
<p>For example, the horse will jump the fence.</p>
<p>Or the horse is going to jump the fence.</p>
<p>I can use ed for past tense, the horse jumped.</p>
<p>And I can use an s for present tense, the horse jumps.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s not an ending for future tense.</p>
<p>I can only express that tense by adding some other words, like the horse will jump or the</p>
<p>horse is going to jump.</p>
<p>But other European languages do have an ending, called an inflection, to express future tense.</p>
<p>So if we think about this in historical terms, English has lost its inflection for future</p>
<p>tense.</p>
<p>And because of that, we&rsquo;ve replaced the inflection with new, non-inflexive ways of</p>
<p>expressing the same idea.</p>
<p>So this is just one example of the many ways in which English has lost many of its inflections.</p>
<p>Now as I&rsquo;ve said, the original Indo-European language had a lot more verb inflections than</p>
<p>modern English.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just focus on present tense for a second.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s do some very simple elementary conjugation.</p>
<p>Sounds like fun, huh?</p>
<p>Well, stick with me.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s conjugate the same basic action verb, jump, in modern English.</p>
<p>In order to do that in what we call the present indicative tense, sounds fancy, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically just present tense, you can conjugate that verb as follows.</p>
<p>I jump.</p>
<p>You jump.</p>
<p>He jumps.</p>
<p>We jump.</p>
<p>You jump.</p>
<p>They jump.</p>
<p>Did you notice a similarity there?</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re all the same, with one exception, the third person singular.</p>
<p>He, she, or it jumps, with an S on the end.</p>
<p>But otherwise, modern English doesn&rsquo;t change the verb to express first person, second person,</p>
<p>third person, plural or singular.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always jump.</p>
<p>I jump.</p>
<p>You jump.</p>
<p>We jump.</p>
<p>You all jump.</p>
<p>And they jump.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always jump.</p>
<p>Again, modern English has simplified verb conjugation because in the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language, and many modern European languages, each of the examples I just gave would have</p>
<p>had a different ending.</p>
<p>And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough to keep track of, in addition to singular and plural, the original</p>
<p>Indo-European language had a completely separate dual sense for actions taken by two things.</p>
<p>This dual sense had altogether separate inflexive endings.</p>
<p>And you think conjugation is difficult in English.</p>
<p>But again, this is how English has actually become more simplified through the years,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s dropped or simplified its inflexive endings.</p>
<p>Now many of these different endings in the original Indo-European language survived into</p>
<p>Old English, and a few even survived into Early Modern English.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re probably familiar with some of those stragglers if you&rsquo;ve ever read Shakespeare</p>
<p>or the King James Bible.</p>
<p>Take a word like the word bear as in to withstand something.</p>
<p>In Early Modern English, it was conjugated I bear, thou bearest, he beareth.</p>
<p>These are probably familiar to you as a form of Older English.</p>
<p>And sometimes we mimic these endings if we want to pretend that we&rsquo;re speaking Shakespearean.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re seeing there are some of these lingering inflections from Old English</p>
<p>which have disappeared over time, like lots of even older inflections.</p>
<p>Now, to emphasize the point, bear, bearest, and beareth, those are all just the present</p>
<p>tense versions.</p>
<p>If you wanted to indicate something happened in the past tense or future tense, you would</p>
<p>have used a completely different set of endings or inflections.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, all of the original Indo-European distinctions of tense and aspect were lost</p>
<p>in the verb in English except present and past tenses, like he walks with an s and he</p>
<p>walked with an ed.</p>
<p>And this much is true throughout all of the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, we can express present tense and past tense with inflections, the</p>
<p>s or the ed.</p>
<p>But no Germanic languages have anything comparable to those of the Latin for future, perfect,</p>
<p>pluperfect, and future-perfect forms.</p>
<p>All of those must be rendered in English and the other Germanic languages in some way other</p>
<p>than a simple, single inflection stuck on the end of the word, like an s or an ed.</p>
<p>In other words, we have to use a verb phrase.</p>
<p>We have to add other words.</p>
<p>So in English, we have to come up with a different form, like I shall jump, I have jumped, I</p>
<p>had jumped, or I shall have jumped.</p>
<p>Another vestige of the original Indo-European language in modern English is the conjugation</p>
<p>of the verb to be, which I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Notice how irregular the forms of the verb are in modern English.</p>
<p>Be, am, is, are, was, were.</p>
<p>This verb is highly irregular because the variations of be have no obvious correlation</p>
<p>to each other.</p>
<p>Unlike sing, sang, sung, or drink, drank, drunk, or even jump, jumps, jumped, the variations</p>
<p>of be don&rsquo;t follow any recognizable pattern.</p>
<p>Be, am, is, are, was, were.</p>
<p>Each version is a completely different word, seemingly unrelated to the next.</p>
<p>But each of these modern English variations of be derived from original Indo-European</p>
<p>roots.</p>
<p>And they were also highly irregular.</p>
<p>So the variations of be that we have in modern English didn&rsquo;t evolve at some later point.</p>
<p>They originated in the original Indo-European language itself.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know why the original Indo-European language had such variable forms for be, but</p>
<p>it may have been an inheritance from an even older language.</p>
<p>Regardless, English, like other European languages, still has lots of variations of this basic</p>
<p>verb.</p>
<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve talked about verbs, and especially how English has simplified verbs and verb</p>
<p>endings by getting rid of a lot of the inflections which Old English and the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language had.</p>
<p>But Indo-European inflections didn&rsquo;t just exist with verbs.</p>
<p>Nouns had them, too.</p>
<p>Inflections were everywhere in the older versions of the language.</p>
<p>So even when you used nouns, there were different versions of the noun depending on how it was</p>
<p>used in the sentence.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at this a little closer.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s start by looking at a situation where English has retained an inflection for</p>
<p>use with nouns.</p>
<p>We sometimes use an inflection to show possession in modern English.</p>
<p>There are actually two ways to show possession in modern English.</p>
<p>One way uses an inflection and one does not.</p>
<p>In other words, one way we modify the noun to show ownership and the other way we use</p>
<p>a phrase.</p>
<p>The way to show possession with an inflection is with an apostrophe s.</p>
<p>For example, Jane&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>We stick the apostrophe s on the end to indicate that the car belongs to Jane.</p>
<p>This inflection goes back to Old English and was one of the most common ways to show ownership</p>
<p>or possession in Old English.</p>
<p>The other way to show possession in modern English is with a phrase, technically a prepositional</p>
<p>phrase with the use of of or of the.</p>
<p>So if I want to indicate a car&rsquo;s price tag, I can say the price of the car.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an inflection.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t change any of the words themselves.</p>
<p>So the car&rsquo;s price is an inflection, but the price of the car is not.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s population, that&rsquo;s an inflection, but the population of the world is not.</p>
<p>The use of apostrophe s dominated in Old English, even though there wasn&rsquo;t actually an apostrophe</p>
<p>at that time.</p>
<p>But during the Middle English period, the use of the of prepositional phrase became</p>
<p>much more common.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s largely because French used the equivalent of of or of the, which is de la or de la.</p>
<p>to show possession.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t use an English inflection like apostrophe s.</p>
<p>So during the period in which French dominated after the Norman Conquest and during the period</p>
<p>of Middle English, the French of the phrase became much more common.</p>
<p>The increased use of of the and the decreased use of apostrophe s is yet another example</p>
<p>of the tendency of English to get rid of inflections.</p>
<p>And today, we can use both, but usually context will dictate the use of one or the other.</p>
<p>For example, we would say Jane&rsquo;s car with the apostrophe s inflection, but we wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really say the car of Jane without the inflection.</p>
<p>But in many cases, we have a choice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more aspect of noun inflections that I want to mention.</p>
<p>In modern English, the noun usually takes a different form when used as a singular noun</p>
<p>or as a plural noun.</p>
<p>So for example, we have one car but two cars with an s on the end.</p>
<p>Or one house or two houses with an es on the end.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s about it for English nouns.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the nouns don&rsquo;t really change in a modern English sentence, whether singular</p>
<p>or plural.</p>
<p>But when we look at the original Indo-European language, things are much more complicated.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European language not only had different noun forms for singular and</p>
<p>plural, but it also had a third tense for duality or a pair of something.</p>
<p>So duality or pairs of things had a special place in Indo-European grammar, and therefore</p>
<p>probably in Indo-European culture.</p>
<p>In addition to number, Indo-European nouns had eight separate cases depending on how</p>
<p>it was used in the sentence.</p>
<p>In other words, depending on what case it was in.</p>
<p>And this is really fascinating and really complicated.</p>
<p>Some of this is still present in modern German.</p>
<p>In English, we generally indicate the subject or object of the sentence by where we place</p>
<p>the word in the sentence.</p>
<p>For example, John sees the policeman.</p>
<p>We know John was the one looking because he came before the verb see.</p>
<p>So John is the subject.</p>
<p>And we know the policeman was the one being seen because he came after the verb.</p>
<p>So he was the object of the sentence.</p>
<p>But what if we reverse the order?</p>
<p>The new sentence is now, The policeman sees John.</p>
<p>These are the exact same words, but in reverse order.</p>
<p>Now we know that the policeman is the one looking because he comes first.</p>
<p>And we know John is the one under surveillance because he comes after the verb.</p>
<p>In modern English, it&rsquo;s all, or at least mostly, about word order.</p>
<p>But in the original Indo-European language, as well as Old English, and to a certain extent</p>
<p>even modern languages like modern German, word order is far less important.</p>
<p>A subject can appear in various places in the sentence.</p>
<p>The same with the object.</p>
<p>The way you tell which one is the subject or the object is which inflection or which</p>
<p>ending it has.</p>
<p>Again, this drives English speakers crazy as they learn German.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a feature inherited directly from the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a somewhat famous quote about this from Mark Twain, who spent some time studying</p>
<p>German and wrote a not very flattering account of the language and the difficulty he had</p>
<p>making any sense out of it.</p>
<p>This particular quote was the following.</p>
<p>The Germans have an inhuman way of cutting up their verbs.</p>
<p>Now a verb has a hard time enough of it in this world when it&rsquo;s all together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s downright inhuman to split it up.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just what those Germans do.</p>
<p>They take part of a verb and put it down here, like a steak, and they take the other part</p>
<p>of it and put it away over yonder, like another steak.</p>
<p>And between those two limits, they just shovel in German.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Well, what Mark Twain is getting at there is the fact that modern German is still highly</p>
<p>inflexible.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really rely on word order like English.</p>
<p>It lets all those little endings or inflections do all the work to tell you which noun is</p>
<p>the subject, the object, etc.</p>
<p>So word order isn&rsquo;t nearly as important as in modern English.</p>
<p>But Old English was much more like modern German in this regard.</p>
<p>This reflects the Germanic origins of English.</p>
<p>And again, this was all inherited from the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see how the original Indo-European language handled this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the original Indo-European word for horse, which I&rsquo;ve used throughout</p>
<p>this episode, and let&rsquo;s look at how the form of that word completely changes depending</p>
<p>on how it was used in a sentence.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European language had eight separate cases, and thus eight separate endings</p>
<p>for the word horse depending on how the word horse was being used.</p>
<p>First, remember from episode 6 that the original Indo-European language had a word for horse</p>
<p>which is actually the original version of the modern English word equine, which English</p>
<p>borrowed from Latin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the root of the word equestrian.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Indo-European root I&rsquo;ll use here.</p>
<p>So if the word horse was the subject of the sentence, like horses ran across the field,</p>
<p>the word for horse was equos, with an &ldquo;-os-&rdquo; ending.</p>
<p>This is called the nominative case.</p>
<p>But if the word horse was being addressed in the sentence, like horses, come here, the</p>
<p>word for horse was eque.</p>
<p>This is called the vocative case.</p>
<p>But if the word horse was the object of the sentence, like I saw horses, the word was</p>
<p>equum, and this was called the accusative case.</p>
<p>But if we wanted to show that the horse owned something, or to show possession by the horse</p>
<p>in the sentence, like the horse&rsquo;s pasture was green, then the word was equosio, and</p>
<p>this is called the genitive case.</p>
<p>If we wanted to show that the horse was the indirect object of the sentence, like give</p>
<p>the horses some food, the word was equoi, and this is called the dative case.</p>
<p>If we wanted to show that the horses were separated from something, like he ran from</p>
<p>the horses, the word would have been equoed, and this is called the oblative case.</p>
<p>If we wanted to talk about the horses in relation to a certain place, like the saddles were</p>
<p>on the horses, the word was equoi, and this is called the locative case.</p>
<p>And lastly, if we wanted to talk about the horses as some means or an instrument to do</p>
<p>something, like she rode the horses to town, the word was equo, and this is called the</p>
<p>instrumental case.</p>
<p>So, as you can see, there were lots of different versions of the word horse depending on exactly</p>
<p>how you were using that word in the sentence.</p>
<p>Equos, equae, equam, equosio, equoi, equod, equoi, equo.</p>
<p>So, you can see how the inflections or endings tell you almost everything you need to know</p>
<p>about the word horse, and therefore the exact location of the word in the sentence is not</p>
<p>as important.</p>
<p>Some of these cases I just looked at also existed in Latin.</p>
<p>For example, in Shakespeare, we see the use of the Latin vocative case when the dying</p>
<p>Caesar exclaims et tu, Brute?</p>
<p>Notice that he didn&rsquo;t say et tu, Brutus, which was his actual name.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because Brute is the vocative case of Brutus.</p>
<p>But having gone through that exercise of the various forms of the word horse in the original</p>
<p>Indo-European language, notice that in each of the examples I read in English, the word</p>
<p>horses didn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>Every time, it was horses.</p>
<p>Horses ran across the field.</p>
<p>Horses come here.</p>
<p>I saw horses.</p>
<p>The horses&rsquo; pasture was green.</p>
<p>But in the original Indo-European language, the noun for horses would have been different</p>
<p>in each sentence, equos, equae, equam, equosio, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, note that English has replaced these inflections with a specific word order.</p>
<p>Objects and objects are no longer distinguished by endings or inflections.</p>
<p>We use word order to do all of the work.</p>
<p>This change actually occurred during the Old English period when invading Vikings and their</p>
<p>Danish relatives settled in a large portion of Britain which became known as the Danelaw.</p>
<p>These Old Norse speakers lived and traded and sometimes married with Anglo-Saxons, who</p>
<p>spoke a different Germanic language with different inflections.</p>
<p>In order to simplify and facilitate communication between these speakers, the inflections were</p>
<p>gradually dropped altogether and a specific word order was adopted to do the work of the</p>
<p>inflections.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at this process in much more detail when we get to the period of Old English.</p>
<p>The basic point here is that English has lost most of its inflections and, as a result,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s become a much simpler and more flexible language.</p>
<p>A single word can now be used in many different contexts.</p>
<p>Take the word love.</p>
<p>It can be used as a noun, a verb, or an adjective, and the form of the word stays the same in</p>
<p>all three instances.</p>
<p>So for example, as a noun, I can say, Love is patient.</p>
<p>Love is a battlefield.</p>
<p>Love is a many-splendored thing.</p>
<p>And as a verb, I can say, I love you.</p>
<p>And as an adjective, I can refer to a love song or a love poem or a love potion.</p>
<p>Notice that no matter how I use it, though, the word love stays the same.</p>
<p>This illustrates the flexibility of words in modern English.</p>
<p>The exact same word can be used in a variety of ways and as different parts of speech without</p>
<p>any modification.</p>
<p>But in Old English and in earlier Indo-European languages, the word love would have been different</p>
<p>in each instance, specifically luva or luvi or luva, respectively.</p>
<p>So there you have it, an introduction to inflections and a general sense of how the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language worked.</p>
<p>This basic knowledge will come in handy as we move forward.</p>
<p>But the next step in our story is to determine who the original Indo-Europeans were and to</p>
<p>figure out how they migrated from their homeland to the various places where specific Indo-European</p>
<p>languages are spoken today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll begin looking at that issue in the next episode, and we&rsquo;ll look at how the</p>
<p>mystery was solved using detective work, sort of like an episode of CSI.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
