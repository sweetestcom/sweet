    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>and gentlemen</p>
<p>very sorry for the late start here but</p>
<p>unfortunately i&rsquo;m the only one that&rsquo;s here</p>
<p>brian and eddie and ari</p>
<p>have not shown up yet brian&rsquo;s not showing up because he</p>
<p>he was eating some yogurt</p>
<p>and he bit down on his</p>
<p>spoon and broke his fucking tooth</p>
<p>which is one of the dumbest fucking</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ve ever heard in my life</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s not gonna be here and</p>
<p>eddie stuck in traffic</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s raining</p>
<p>in la and when it rains in la everybody freaks out</p>
<p>and already</p>
<p>stuck in traffic as well</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>story let me</p>
<p>shut this music</p>
<p>off i got this</p>
<p>the guru from gangstar died yesterday very very sad</p>
<p>one of my favorite rap bands ever</p>
<p>um and dude was like forty three years old makes you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s only a year</p>
<p>older than me that&rsquo;s crazy shit you know</p>
<p>dying of you know cancer and shit</p>
<p>used to be healthy now he&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s life unfortunately but the good</p>
<p>thing is we still got his music</p>
<p>life carries on and maybe</p>
<p>maybe somewhere cool right now right</p>
<p>who the fuck knows right</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>so since i&rsquo;m starting solo let&rsquo;s get</p>
<p>started with a bunch of shit that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>first of all this fucking</p>
<p>strike force thing you know</p>
<p>one of the reasons why</p>
<p>the strike force</p>
<p>thing is so fucked up is because they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really done it that many times</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t done</p>
<p>these big cbs shows that many times and</p>
<p>they made a</p>
<p>bunch of big mistakes and the big brawl that happened</p>
<p>afterwards i mean</p>
<p>first of all everyone was</p>
<p>criticizing mayhem</p>
<p>and everyone</p>
<p>was saying that mayhem fucked up and mayhem</p>
<p>might cause</p>
<p>cbs their deal</p>
<p>all right first of all</p>
<p>mayhem shouldn&rsquo;t have even been</p>
<p>allowed to get into that octagon if that was the ufc</p>
<p>they have security</p>
<p>at the stairs</p>
<p>they have security at the top</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just walk into the octagon</p>
<p>while the fights are</p>
<p>going on it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally not possible</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that many teammates in the octagon as well</p>
<p>when jake shields</p>
<p>after his fight he had like</p>
<p>six or seven of his buddies</p>
<p>in the cage</p>
<p>trainers everybody you can&rsquo;t have that many people</p>
<p>the ufc does not</p>
<p>allow the ufc</p>
<p>i believe you&rsquo;re allowed to have three</p>
<p>and they regulate</p>
<p>it all and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re supposed to do</p>
<p>as far as mayhem</p>
<p>doing something that was inappropriate</p>
<p>well he definitely did something disrespectful you know</p>
<p>jake shields</p>
<p>is in the middle of the biggest victory of his life</p>
<p>just beats dan</p>
<p>fucking henderson and dominates him for four</p>
<p>rounds after you got fucked up for the</p>
<p>first round so</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a huge emotional victory for him</p>
<p>and for his</p>
<p>teammates rather you know this is a gigantic</p>
<p>fight and he pulled it off so</p>
<p>you know emotions were running very high</p>
<p>and mayhem stepped</p>
<p>in and bogarted the attention and that&rsquo;s not cool</p>
<p>but it was a mistake</p>
<p>you know he went in there to try to hype up the</p>
<p>fight the same way they</p>
<p>would do in the</p>
<p>ufc the same way</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>famous george st</p>
<p>pierre i&rsquo;m not impressed with your performance</p>
<p>you know when he went in there when</p>
<p>matt hughes had just won</p>
<p>you know that kind of shit happens</p>
<p>to build up</p>
<p>fights that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>but this wasn&rsquo;t planned</p>
<p>you know strike</p>
<p>force didn&rsquo;t know it was</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>mayhem thought</p>
<p>about it last</p>
<p>minute he just</p>
<p>wanted a you know he was hyped up because he had won</p>
<p>earlier than</p>
<p>night he wanted a rematch with jake shields</p>
<p>so he runs into the octagon</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>they start pushing him out of the way</p>
<p>and then chaos</p>
<p>erupts he should have never</p>
<p>been allowed to get into the octagon and if he</p>
<p>was allowed to get in the cage</p>
<p>they should have had it</p>
<p>regulated it</p>
<p>should have been a situation</p>
<p>where when they</p>
<p>would let jake</p>
<p>shields speak</p>
<p>they ask him all the questions are</p>
<p>going to ask him</p>
<p>totally respectfully</p>
<p>he gets his chance</p>
<p>he gets his moment to say what he has to say</p>
<p>thank his teammates then</p>
<p>after all that&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>then mayhem</p>
<p>comes in if that&rsquo;s what they want if that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fight they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hyping up next</p>
<p>who the fuck knows what</p>
<p>their plans were they</p>
<p>their plans</p>
<p>might not be a mayhem</p>
<p>fight next so it</p>
<p>should have been up to them a</p>
<p>they should have</p>
<p>they should have</p>
<p>regulated the cage</p>
<p>they should</p>
<p>have made sure he didn&rsquo;t get in there as far as like</p>
<p>what the diaz brothers did and you know and</p>
<p>gilbert melendez</p>
<p>those guys are backing up</p>
<p>their buddy</p>
<p>all right those guys are like brothers you know</p>
<p>those guys they&rsquo;re all a</p>
<p>bunch of fucking psychos and</p>
<p>savages their</p>
<p>buddy just wins the</p>
<p>strikeforce a bit away title</p>
<p>some pushing goes on</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re down</p>
<p>to get in there that&rsquo;s just the way they are and</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>the diaz brothers</p>
<p>you know people always criticize them but</p>
<p>i think first of all i</p>
<p>think they make shit way more interesting</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve got someone like</p>
<p>nate and nick diaz that</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t give a fuck like</p>
<p>they really don&rsquo;t give a fuck like they&rsquo;re not just</p>
<p>pretending to</p>
<p>not give a fuck no they really don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>they will fight</p>
<p>in a brawl on cbs</p>
<p>on prime time they don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>they they really</p>
<p>knew what was</p>
<p>going on and they</p>
<p>still stepped in there and did that</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>have them all together like that</p>
<p>and let anybody</p>
<p>in that you want it&rsquo;s like i used to have pit bulls</p>
<p>and when you get a</p>
<p>bunch of pit bulls in the room</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get mad at the pit bulls if they</p>
<p>fight each other</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just what they do</p>
<p>and these guys are professional</p>
<p>mixed martial arts</p>
<p>fighters and</p>
<p>in mixed martial arts</p>
<p>definitely there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>psychological aspect to it that&rsquo;s a huge component</p>
<p>of of of fighting</p>
<p>and whether or not you win or lose and</p>
<p>these guys have this</p>
<p>psychological edge over their</p>
<p>opponents because they&rsquo;re so aggressive</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so down to</p>
<p>fight at any moments</p>
<p>notice they don&rsquo;t give a fuck they&rsquo;re not afraid</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ready to throw down</p>
<p>and because of that that&rsquo;s a significant advantage</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a significant tactic</p>
<p>when it comes to fighting</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna relinquish</p>
<p>that just because they&rsquo;re on national</p>
<p>television so</p>
<p>if someone gets in one of</p>
<p>their boys faces and disrespects them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>fight i mean that&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>so what i blame</p>
<p>is i think mayhem certainly made an</p>
<p>error but you</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>never been allowed</p>
<p>to get into the position to make that</p>
<p>error it was</p>
<p>completely in my opinion on</p>
<p>strike force</p>
<p>or the the committee</p>
<p>or whoever the fuck is supposed to be</p>
<p>watching that cage</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s responsible for that</p>
<p>the ufc takes care of all that shit</p>
<p>i never have to</p>
<p>think about it</p>
<p>but whoever was responsible for that</p>
<p>it was a goddamn disaster so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my opinion</p>
<p>on that and as far</p>
<p>as like the commentary goes and the people were talking</p>
<p>about how bad the commentary is</p>
<p>this is what i</p>
<p>think about that</p>
<p>i like frank shamrock i like frank</p>
<p>frank shamrock as a person</p>
<p>i enjoy him i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t mind his commentary at all</p>
<p>those other two dudes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like my mom said if you don&rsquo;t have not anything</p>
<p>nice to say don&rsquo;t say anything at all so i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna say shit</p>
<p>because i think</p>
<p>those guys need work</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not as easy as it looks and</p>
<p>you got to be a fan of the</p>
<p>sport and i&rsquo;m not sure that</p>
<p>that main guy&rsquo;s a fan of the sport</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to mention his fucking name so</p>
<p>here we are this is the the 420 episode of the podcast</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;ll do is</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll just ramble</p>
<p>until everybody gets here ari and</p>
<p>eddie should be here within</p>
<p>probably 15</p>
<p>to 20 minutes depending on what the traffic looks like</p>
<p>and when they get here</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll jump off so between now and then i&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>take questions</p>
<p>if you see my office here if you notice</p>
<p>things have changed</p>
<p>i got rid of some</p>
<p>shit here move something out</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m gonna put a</p>
<p>green screen behind me so</p>
<p>for the next you</p>
<p>stream podcast</p>
<p>hopefully the next one if not the next one the one</p>
<p>after that i&rsquo;ll be in space</p>
<p>so the way we&rsquo;re gonna have it set up is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have a podcast and then</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna have a green screen i&rsquo;m gonna have</p>
<p>a total space</p>
<p>background and</p>
<p>then i&rsquo;ll have couches and shit like that so</p>
<p>the idea is that it&rsquo;ll look like couches flying through</p>
<p>space and so that should be pretty interesting this</p>
<p>whole thing is you know i</p>
<p>started out this podcast sort of just</p>
<p>kind of as a move and</p>
<p>you know i just thought it&rsquo;d be an interesting thing to</p>
<p>do i&rsquo;d always wanted to do something like that i always</p>
<p>enjoyed radio</p>
<p>but i kind of</p>
<p>never got off my ass to do it and now i&rsquo;ve done it</p>
<p>i think this is like the 12th or the 13th week in a row</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>real consistent and it&rsquo;s been a lot of fun and now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>number eight on the comedy section of itunes</p>
<p>which is crazy because the</p>
<p>audio part of it was just sort of an</p>
<p>afterthought to</p>
<p>throw that up</p>
<p>and the you</p>
<p>stream one is getting plenty of hits and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been fun</p>
<p>a fun way to supplement you know comedy and</p>
<p>speaking of comedy i got</p>
<p>one gig this friday</p>
<p>night and sacramento but it&rsquo;s already sold out</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna be doing a color commentary for</p>
<p>jose aldo versus</p>
<p>uriah faber</p>
<p>the i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re literally not even referring</p>
<p>to it as the wc they&rsquo;re just referring to it as</p>
<p>aldo versus favor</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not exactly sure why that is i</p>
<p>think you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for you know because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because the preliminary is</p>
<p>gonna be on</p>
<p>spike tv a lot</p>
<p>a lot of corporate shit</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on um</p>
<p>i got a bunch of shit to talk about</p>
<p>first of all this fucking</p>
<p>volcano over iceland is nuts</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t noticed that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>my wife had no idea what was going on</p>
<p>because she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to shit except for gossip but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a giant</p>
<p>volcano in iceland that literally is</p>
<p>erupting through</p>
<p>the ice it&rsquo;s pretty badass if you look at some of the</p>
<p>video footage online if you google it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really pretty intense</p>
<p>you seeing like molten lava</p>
<p>squirting up through the ice is really wild and</p>
<p>the volcanic ash</p>
<p>has gotten so bad that they have canceled</p>
<p>all the air flight</p>
<p>over europe</p>
<p>for days and days</p>
<p>oh our spheres here how&rsquo;s it going</p>
<p>oh beautiful</p>
<p>sup brother</p>
<p>alright alright why is jelly for this place out i did</p>
<p>have a seat</p>
<p>alright ladies and gentlemen he&rsquo;s here eddie bravo</p>
<p>should be moments behind i&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s very close</p>
<p>did you even ring the doorbell no</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t i didn&rsquo;t even hear it</p>
<p>not so much on rambling</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>the iceland volcano</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>about all that show yeah no one can fly anywhere yeah</p>
<p>today they just lifted it</p>
<p>but i wouldn&rsquo;t fucking fly lift it fully</p>
<p>yeah they lifted the air band</p>
<p>over europe but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s costing 200 million dollars a day</p>
<p>how nutty is that it&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>good to enroll in</p>
<p>the airline industry</p>
<p>200 murders</p>
<p>of in this country is yeah</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s awfully crazy</p>
<p>200 million dollars a day how about that</p>
<p>how fragile</p>
<p>is this world</p>
<p>and any little</p>
<p>thing can happen and</p>
<p>things close down for a couple days and</p>
<p>these businesses</p>
<p>they run so on the edge</p>
<p>that just a couple days off work and they come</p>
<p>close to being bankrupt</p>
<p>i like that people are like fucking</p>
<p>i heard all</p>
<p>the stories like this volcano now i can&rsquo;t fly home</p>
<p>or like you know we</p>
<p>could have had all life</p>
<p>wiped out too</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just as likely yeah</p>
<p>people have</p>
<p>no idea what volcanoes are all about</p>
<p>volcanoes have reshaped</p>
<p>this earth like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in hawaii</p>
<p>you ever gone to hawaii</p>
<p>you ever gone over the volcano in a helicopter</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fucking coolest thing ever</p>
<p>i went to the big island and we took</p>
<p>a trip on a helicopter and we flew over the volcano</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re flying over this</p>
<p>active volcano</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re watching</p>
<p>the lava bubble up inside you can see the fucking lava</p>
<p>you can see it and you can see it roll into the ocean</p>
<p>like we fly over to</p>
<p>where it rolls in the ocean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s moving four inches</p>
<p>every year closer to japan and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy and there&rsquo;s another island</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another island in the middle of the</p>
<p>ocean that hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite popped up yet</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s on its way it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be the next island in the hawaiian islands</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on its way up it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>building up</p>
<p>that whole area is just one gigantic</p>
<p>as the volcano</p>
<p>stuff comes out</p>
<p>it just dries and it dries</p>
<p>and it becomes</p>
<p>yeah it becomes rock and it</p>
<p>breaks down and it</p>
<p>breaks down and becomes dirt and</p>
<p>plants grow on it</p>
<p>of that kind of dirt yeah</p>
<p>i mean it literally is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what hawaii is it&rsquo;s a volcano</p>
<p>it just came out</p>
<p>of the ground and you know in created islands</p>
<p>but you can see the fucking volcano</p>
<p>and they have all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>photos that you</p>
<p>could buy there and</p>
<p>videos you could</p>
<p>watch there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of towns</p>
<p>that were completely</p>
<p>wiped out on the big island</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ll show you</p>
<p>where the town used to be</p>
<p>the lava just came rolling in like the 50s and just</p>
<p>crushed the entire town</p>
<p>i think it happened in the 80s i</p>
<p>went a few times a rock half</p>
<p>up i didn&rsquo;t see any of that but i&rsquo;m sure there must be</p>
<p>i mean most of the</p>
<p>stuff just gets smushed</p>
<p>i mean the lava comes down it just</p>
<p>literally annihilates</p>
<p>any evidence whatsoever than anything was there right</p>
<p>and what people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize is like that shit has happened so many times</p>
<p>you know this</p>
<p>world has changed</p>
<p>so many times just in you know</p>
<p>the last few million years</p>
<p>the best place to find megalodon</p>
<p>skeletons megalodon</p>
<p>teeth you know what a megalodon is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re these</p>
<p>giant ancient prehistoric</p>
<p>sharks they were like fucking</p>
<p>gigantic way bigger than</p>
<p>great whites</p>
<p>well the best</p>
<p>place to find</p>
<p>their teeth</p>
<p>is in montana</p>
<p>this i used to be</p>
<p>covered used to be the ocean yeah</p>
<p>how fucking that is</p>
<p>after they hung out</p>
<p>the ocean fucking</p>
<p>crazy montana</p>
<p>used to be underwater</p>
<p>you know so many parts of just</p>
<p>just like ten thousand years ago half of</p>
<p>north america was</p>
<p>under a mile high</p>
<p>sheet of ice</p>
<p>just ten thousand years ago</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nothing ten</p>
<p>thousand years is nothing</p>
<p>ten thousand years ago they were</p>
<p>saber tooth</p>
<p>tigers and woolly mammoths did you know that</p>
<p>just 10 000 years ago</p>
<p>fucking saber</p>
<p>tooth tigers</p>
<p>10 000 years isn&rsquo;t shit</p>
<p>like there were people around then</p>
<p>what was the 10 000</p>
<p>years before that it was there</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>10 000 years before that i mean as</p>
<p>far as human</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all who the fuck knows i mean we know that</p>
<p>the big extinction was</p>
<p>65 million years ago</p>
<p>that was the one that hit the yucatan the big</p>
<p>meteor that</p>
<p>wiped out supposedly</p>
<p>wiped out everything except</p>
<p>small mammals and you</p>
<p>know anything</p>
<p>bigger than like</p>
<p>a fucking hamster was</p>
<p>a small mammal</p>
<p>skill why were they</p>
<p>they figured</p>
<p>out a way to burrow on</p>
<p>the ground and hardy rats and shit like that you know</p>
<p>rats are some hardy animals</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>the descendants of anything that survived</p>
<p>65 million years old</p>
<p>tons of rats</p>
<p>yeah well all sorts of mammals</p>
<p>and some birds i mean</p>
<p>dinosaurs are</p>
<p>a direct descendant</p>
<p>of dinosaurs</p>
<p>somehow or another some birds survived but</p>
<p>literally most of the life on the planet was</p>
<p>wiped the fuck out</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>super volcanoes man</p>
<p>super volcanoes have been wiping out</p>
<p>things on this continent for</p>
<p>millions and millions of years</p>
<p>every six to</p>
<p>eight hundred thousand years</p>
<p>yellowstone blows up and</p>
<p>literally wipes out the</p>
<p>whole continent</p>
<p>kills everything</p>
<p>and it restarts</p>
<p>again yeah and there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>2 000 earthquakes in yellowstone national park</p>
<p>since january this year</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s hear this</p>
<p>thing on npr</p>
<p>about earthquakes and how they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>swimming more now</p>
<p>you know yeah is that true there are more</p>
<p>no no exactly the same just happened to hit big cities</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s the same amount</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;re hitting</p>
<p>places where people are yeah and if it happens</p>
<p>i mean if you had a</p>
<p>birthmark in</p>
<p>bakerscale you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get so much damage</p>

<p>sunset and fairfax it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be you know tremendous</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>but it seems like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many of them they&rsquo;re having yeah it does</p>
<p>seem like a</p>
<p>lot is that because of the news like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more access to information down</p>
<p>there before i don&rsquo;t know they were</p>

<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the prior side of life</p>
<p>is that the weirdest fucking</p>
<p>thing in the world is these women that think that being</p>
<p>super skinny like anorexic is hot</p>
<p>that shit is disgusting</p>
<p>some people like it they must</p>
<p>how could the fuck</p>
<p>could any guy like that that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>anti nature</p>
<p>nature you want a woman to have some fat on her ass</p>
<p>you want to have big tits so she can milk the baby</p>
<p>you want to have</p>
<p>fat on her ass so she can survive through the pregnancy</p>
<p>those are all like</p>
<p>these are like</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>yeah but those</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>they are good</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>those things are there the reason</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re attractive</p>
<p>yeah the reason why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>attractive it&rsquo;s i mean</p>
<p>why aren&rsquo;t you just</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s too much that&rsquo;s obese that&rsquo;s unhealthy</p>
<p>but a little bit</p>
<p>of fat is good like a little fat ass i like a fat ass</p>
<p>what else was on</p>
<p>obese just like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not good because they can&rsquo;t move around good</p>
<p>you want athletic</p>
<p>but you want some fat on them that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all nature it&rsquo;s all leftover shit</p>
<p>i mean think</p>
<p>about how easy it is to</p>
<p>trick your system how</p>
<p>about fake tits</p>
<p>we know they&rsquo;re fake we know there&rsquo;s a bag of plastic</p>
<p>underneath your skin but</p>
<p>still it makes you hot</p>
<p>it looks hotter</p>
<p>they poke out and they look</p>
<p>ridiculous like</p>
<p>that that poor</p>
<p>fucking girl what is her name heidi montag</p>
<p>you know who she is really</p>
<p>yeah you know he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t pay attention he&rsquo;s the anti gossip man</p>
<p>but this heidi montag chick</p>
<p>is she&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those celebrities</p>
<p>for just being</p>
<p>a celebrity like you&rsquo;re not exactly sure why she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a celebrity</p>
<p>she just had 10 plastic</p>
<p>surgeries all together</p>
<p>she had her chin done</p>
<p>her tits done she had all this shit so she</p>
<p>look better or worse</p>
<p>some people say she looks better but i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think she looked bad to</p>
<p>begin with she just</p>
<p>had kind of a big chin like sort of like a jay leno</p>
<p>thing going on</p>
<p>but she was pretty</p>
<p>like you like she didn&rsquo;t have to do that like it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make you look better</p>
<p>it just makes you look different</p>
<p>definitely sluggier</p>
<p>she had big</p>
<p>tits to begin with she had</p>
<p>like big fake</p>
<p>tits and she got giant ones</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>ridiculous like they look stupid</p>
<p>i like a solid see</p>
<p>solid sees good right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>crazy crazy big</p>
<p>yeah when you see girls who have it&rsquo;s so funny like la</p>
<p>so fucked up with fake</p>
<p>tits that you see girls got real tits</p>
<p>yeah and they&rsquo;re kind of like sacking shit</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s with those what&rsquo;s wrong with those</p>
<p>meanwhile it&rsquo;s just like that&rsquo;s normal let it go</p>
<p>yeah like go look at fucking videos of africa you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed to have</p>
<p>these missile tits that</p>
<p>stick straight out of your chest that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just not normal i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;ll realize when i go from like a bee to a sea</p>
<p>hang down a little bit</p>
<p>they just look like perky</p>
<p>they just look like they did maybe when</p>
<p>they were 20</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing though how easy it is to trick us</p>
<p>some plastic surgery is good</p>
<p>do we need more of those people</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the right plastic surgery</p>
<p>right you look great</p>
<p>to me more is forty seven years old and she</p>
<p>still looks hot how the fuck is she doing that</p>
<p>i saw that that&rsquo;s incredible the</p>
<p>model with the book there</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m sure but it&rsquo;s like no way not that much</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our in person</p>
<p>she was at ufc maybe two years ago</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>forty seven forty eight</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s hot as fuck dude</p>
<p>still no i&rsquo;m sure the vagina is just dumb</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just dry as fuck</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s no more blood coming out of that thing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no more periods</p>
<p>50 when you hit 50 that&rsquo;s a wrap why on periods</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no more periods that means you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>ovulating means you&rsquo;re not really able to have bird</p>
<p>babies anymore</p>
<p>your body shuts the fuck off</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just shooting loads into a cemetery</p>
<p>and shooting those into a casket</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing in there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a total trick</p>
<p>you might as well be fucking a rubber doll</p>
<p>i mean you&rsquo;re having sex with a person that&rsquo;s all well</p>
<p>and good but as far as like you</p>
<p>shoot a load inside of her it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>total waste of time but at least it&rsquo;s not yeah</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>babies i know you don&rsquo;t want babies i&rsquo;m not saying that</p>
<p>you do but i&rsquo;m saying like for nature though it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i mean the only reason why sex feels good is to</p>
<p>trick you into fucking so that you make people let</p>
<p>me tell you what the jewish mystical</p>
<p>about what happened to your</p>
<p>semen that you wasted no</p>
<p>when you pull out or when you masturbate</p>
<p>your semen is said to have</p>
<p>impregnated</p>
<p>some demon woman</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re like appearing</p>
<p>right here she&rsquo;s fucking you as you masturbate it</p>
<p>so you get her pregnancy</p>
<p>and when you get to heaven</p>
<p>or before you get to heaven it&rsquo;s purgatory level</p>
<p>you have to face all of your kids and they&rsquo;re like why</p>
<p>why couldn&rsquo;t we be born real people</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all like</p>
<p>formed and mangled and you have to answer all of them</p>
<p>oh my god that</p>
<p>might be the</p>
<p>greatest story ever how come i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>heard of it before i don&rsquo;t know how much kamala</p>
<p>do you study</p>
<p>this so this they</p>
<p>taught you this when you were a</p>
<p>child now the people that don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>ari spent a</p>
<p>bunch of years</p>
<p>in his youth as a seriously religious man</p>
<p>like read the torah how many</p>
<p>hours a day</p>
<p>when i was in israel public</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>ten twelve hours a day</p>
<p>reading the torah</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to fire up the volcano for that son</p>
<p>this is great man you really</p>
<p>oh dude i&rsquo;m turning this bitch into a real studio</p>
<p>dude i did a solo it took</p>
<p>me like yeah took me like twelve hours</p>
<p>well i did have people help me get rid of the dust</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen have you ever heard of a volcano</p>
<p>do you know what a volcano is</p>
<p>a volcano is</p>
<p>a vaporizing</p>
<p>device and what</p>
<p>vaporizing is</p>
<p>the big argument about thc</p>
<p>about marijuana in general is that you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke because</p>
<p>smoke is bad for your lungs</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to smoke it</p>
<p>you can eat it</p>
<p>but eating it is very</p>
<p>tricky because you eat it you get too fucked</p>
<p>up because when you eat it it&rsquo;s processed by the liver</p>
<p>and it creates something called 11 hydroxy metabolite</p>
<p>which is four times more psychoactive</p>
<p>than thc and it&rsquo;s really a totally different experience</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s why when people eat</p>
<p>brownies they</p>
<p>freak out that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m sure a lot of you have seen that video</p>
<p>where that dude</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a cop and he calls up</p>
<p>the nine one one</p>
<p>and says that he</p>
<p>thinks he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dying because</p>
<p>because he and his</p>
<p>girlfriend ate some pot</p>
<p>brownies and he said time was moving really slow and</p>
<p>he thinks he&rsquo;s dying</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s because oh</p>
<p>eddie bravos here</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen oh</p>
<p>check out the office</p>
<p>you clean this</p>
<p>motherfucker dude</p>
<p>i got rid of the desk and i&rsquo;m turning to sing into a</p>
<p>studio we&rsquo;re live</p>
<p>right now there&rsquo;s over 2 000 people this is the biggest</p>
<p>crowd we&rsquo;ve ever had anyway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a vaporizers</p>
<p>and vaporizer</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>it blows into this plastic bag and it looks like</p>
<p>like a like a you know</p>
<p>like saran wrap or some shit</p>
<p>and you just get pure thc vapor</p>
<p>and what it does is it heats up the little crystals</p>
<p>on the thc and releases them and it comes out like mist</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>smoke at all so there&rsquo;s no argument anymore there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>negative health</p>
<p>effects that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>documentary</p>
<p>i said smoke out of a vapor</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m gonna have</p>
<p>two dedicated cameras in here and this</p>
<p>is gonna be a green</p>
<p>screen and we&rsquo;re gonna be in space</p>
<p>when i set this up within two weeks</p>
<p>this will all be</p>
<p>green behind us and then when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be like we&rsquo;re flying to the universe on a couch</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be the shit</p>
<p>every episode is a different paris</p>
<p>yeah yeah sometimes</p>
<p>they were in africa</p>
<p>for real so</p>
<p>what we were talking</p>
<p>about we went over volcanoes</p>
<p>we went over i went over</p>
<p>strike force</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you got any opinion on</p>
<p>strike force i said the</p>
<p>whole reason why that brawl took place</p>
<p>is because they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>guard the caves they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do a good job of making sure that nobody got in there</p>
<p>that was well</p>
<p>as soon as i</p>
<p>saw the fight end i was like</p>
<p>i want to go to a spot</p>
<p>the spice done it&rsquo;s over i</p>
<p>never won well</p>
<p>and watch mayhem went in there and talked when jake</p>
<p>shields was</p>
<p>in the cage and said yo jake when do i get the rematch</p>
<p>gilbert melendez</p>
<p>pushed mayhem out of the way</p>
<p>the diaz brothers jumped mayhem jumped him</p>
<p>man pushed oh jumped him it was a brawl</p>
<p>dude it was</p>
<p>kicking him</p>
<p>when he was down there was like four people on him</p>
<p>eric apple took jake</p>
<p>shields and</p>
<p>got him out of there and pushed him over to the</p>
<p>other side so he can get involved in the bra</p>
<p>i mean it was a fucking</p>
<p>bench clearing brawl</p>
<p>that was pretty awesome there was</p>
<p>a great picture</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>picture online</p>
<p>where someone</p>
<p>from the audience captured it on the</p>
<p>phone or something</p>
<p>where jake shields and nick diaz are coming</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like from behind</p>
<p>jake or behind man</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great shot that</p>
<p>was that yeah</p>
<p>yeah mayhem is</p>
<p>standing there and nick diaz is like this and jake</p>
<p>shields is like that and gilbert melendez</p>
<p>is on the other side</p>
<p>look man those fucking dudes they have a lot of</p>
<p>unity and i respect that and you know</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s like oh they&rsquo;re thugs and they&rsquo;re this</p>
<p>mad well you</p>
<p>gotta realize man</p>
<p>these dudes are fucking professional cage</p>
<p>fighters alright</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in there</p>
<p>scrapping with each</p>
<p>other every day</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re down to die for each</p>
<p>other the reputation is hugely important they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna fucking back down they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna have a situation</p>
<p>where they look like a</p>
<p>bitch they&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>allow someone to</p>
<p>think in them</p>
<p>to anybody who</p>
<p>think that their</p>
<p>buddy got disrespected but they didn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>about it that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>so any sort of a situation like that</p>
<p>where a brawl takes</p>
<p>place i&rsquo;m playing fucking</p>
<p>strike force man</p>
<p>i blame strike force for</p>
<p>allowing that to get to that position</p>
<p>allowing those fucking dudes to get into the cage</p>
<p>those were all the</p>
<p>comics for our last</p>
<p>thing really yeah</p>
<p>there was some</p>
<p>definitely people</p>
<p>that have who i&rsquo;m scared of</p>
<p>they asked me to</p>
<p>leave and lit up as far as the</p>
<p>front patio</p>
<p>and el dorado</p>
<p>were scared</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>just call the cops and get them out of here</p>
<p>but they wouldn&rsquo;t do it eventually the</p>
<p>fight broke out</p>
<p>and somebody like are you let&rsquo;s go to the</p>
<p>front i saw the</p>
<p>fight and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to get involved in this i don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>stabbed for someone else</p>
<p>that you see already</p>

<p>gus johnson said</p>
<p>somebody no this hasn&rsquo;t been confirmed</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m just gonna say it because i hope it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>gus johnson who&rsquo;s the guy who&rsquo;s the the</p>
<p>black dude who does the commentary</p>
<p>strike force</p>
<p>made a bunch of errors called like arm bars</p>
<p>come or i saw that i was like yeah this see this</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen see the fog in that that&rsquo;s missed</p>
<p>well anyway this reporter called them up and asked him</p>
<p>about it i think</p>
<p>mike russell i believe</p>
<p>was his name</p>
<p>and he said</p>
<p>listen dog i know the difference between our bar comola</p>
<p>kimora i train</p>
<p>he said if you want to come</p>
<p>down and roll with me i&rsquo;ll show you the difference like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like challenging guys to roll with him like he</p>
<p>trains like</p>
<p>gus johnson on the internet yes</p>
<p>people do with mike russell</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s too far away we can pull this</p>
<p>but if we put close to the problem as</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s three of us here</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t read it we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>read it yeah we don&rsquo;t have to read it we get just talk</p>
<p>we got to pay attention to</p>
<p>the audience</p>
<p>yeah but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pay attention to the audience and keep a conversation</p>
<p>going at the same time sometimes</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s not really harsh in your lungs at all</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like a mist you know be great if like</p>
<p>if the da busted in right now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all legal</p>
<p>we have prescription yeah we&rsquo;re legal i&rsquo;m sick</p>
<p>insomnia bitch</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>crank this back up and i&rsquo;ll fill the bag up</p>
<p>again oh no we go one more time son i</p>
<p>think seriously</p>
<p>though seriously because this is the 420 episode</p>
<p>we should be allowed to have like</p>
<p>order pizza</p>
<p>and like have</p>
<p>food and shit</p>
<p>during the show</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s four twenty we&rsquo;re getting high</p>
<p>like snacking on shit</p>
<p>yeah but that</p>
<p>fucks up with the that fucks up the conversation no you</p>
<p>never had a</p>
<p>great conversation and eating</p>
<p>pizza but yeah but people are</p>
<p>watching this</p>
<p>conversation this conversations like a show</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about how i&rsquo;m hungry</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m starving</p>
<p>i was gonna go to the</p>
<p>fast food joint but</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you just go walk into my</p>
<p>kitchen and just go scrounge around</p>
<p>we got a show to do son but we need to</p>
<p>order pizza we&rsquo;ll order</p>
<p>pizza later</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll order some pizza later</p>
<p>the idea will be the</p>
<p>pizza comes right before we kill this thing okay</p>
<p>how dare you motherfuckers so well</p>
<p>i was telling us something hilarious</p>
<p>listen to this shit stop</p>
<p>it off we need to be focusing on the show son</p>
<p>i was telling us that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an ancient jewish whatever the fuck it is</p>
<p>jewish mythical thought</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a when you wait see</p>
<p>the wait see</p>
<p>uh huh so um</p>
<p>they say when you pull out and you</p>
<p>masturbate you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not really masturbating you&rsquo;re fucking a</p>
<p>demon woman</p>
<p>with nothing just like a</p>
<p>ghost and when you go to heaven</p>
<p>when you go to a</p>
<p>the afterlife you face all your kids that</p>
<p>would have been born in the real life</p>
<p>instead of born this</p>
<p>demon woman well</p>
<p>like like this like why</p>
<p>why did you</p>
<p>pull out we want to be born real little boys</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t wait to die there&rsquo;s gonna be all my kids</p>
<p>i thought i didn&rsquo;t have any kids man</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t feel so bad now dude you&rsquo;ve got a billion</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a billion monster babies</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s per load</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t cut sperm so yeah you&rsquo;re like fucking one</p>
<p>demon i think so how many demons do you think you got</p>
<p>damn it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna have a much more efficient</p>
<p>setup here as well ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>when we get back</p>
<p>no how many demons</p>
<p>i think on average</p>
<p>six a week five weeks since i was</p>
<p>you shoot six loads a week</p>
<p>sometimes more than one does</p>
<p>in a month you ever feel like a</p>
<p>loser when you get more than one again</p>
<p>no i feel like i&rsquo;m alive my dick</p>
<p>works that&rsquo;s what i feel like yeah like yeah</p>
<p>still working for this</p>
<p>i always feel like</p>
<p>if i jerk off</p>
<p>more than once a day that i&rsquo;m just obsessed</p>
<p>yeah three times a day</p>
<p>is bad that&rsquo;s bad obviously i&rsquo;m not horny</p>
<p>you know already jerked off</p>
<p>i know but why why just sit there</p>
<p>like a little monkey at the zoo</p>
<p>yeah no in the wild you fucking</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;d be badass</p>
<p>spreading spreading your seed</p>
<p>ready to see you jerking off into a napkin</p>
<p>but if there was vagina then</p>
<p>if there was a vagina</p>
<p>david no one&rsquo;s ever said no i&rsquo;d rather just jerk off</p>
<p>and how crazy</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re insist</p>
<p>that someone&rsquo;s telling</p>
<p>you that masturbation is so bad that you&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the worst case scenario</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>sex with a demon and making half demon</p>
<p>babies that are</p>
<p>gonna be waiting for you when you die</p>
<p>to scream and yell at you yeah</p>
<p>that is because the institution of marriage</p>
<p>they want that that helps religion</p>
<p>they want people making units and</p>
<p>then breathing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing though</p>
<p>like what why do they give a fuck</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why do they give a fuck if you masturbate what is it</p>
<p>about masturbation</p>
<p>about no masturbation</p>
<p>you know that somehow or another</p>
<p>equates to them having more control over you well</p>
<p>the more you don&rsquo;t masturbate the more you want to fuck</p>
<p>right so they can fuck women</p>
<p>and you may</p>
<p>have babies</p>
<p>the results of</p>
<p>babies so the more you masturbate the less babies</p>
<p>right so that&rsquo;s got to be exactly why</p>
<p>the catholic church</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want you having</p>
<p>birth control too right</p>
<p>does that make</p>
<p>sense yeah well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely way</p>
<p>easier to control</p>
<p>someone when they have kids i feel that myself</p>
<p>i feel like i&rsquo;m easier to control</p>
<p>now that you have kids when you have kids when you want</p>
<p>everything to be nice</p>
<p>you know you want</p>
<p>everything to be easy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want any</p>
<p>drama you know</p>
<p>but man the idea of</p>
<p>demon babies you&rsquo;re fucking a</p>
<p>demon no they came up with the</p>
<p>worst story ever</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking a</p>
<p>demon and you make babies</p>
<p>that are half</p>
<p>demon and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>waiting for you when you die what the fuck man</p>
<p>missed those stuff</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like why</p>
<p>stops because you</p>
<p>by the time you figure that</p>
<p>out you&rsquo;ve already jerked off like a thousand times</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s 50 000</p>
<p>demons 50 000</p>
<p>demons i&rsquo;m fucked either way</p>
<p>might as well</p>
<p>enjoy this life you&rsquo;re facing an army of demons who</p>
<p>cares there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be something you</p>
<p>could do to</p>
<p>cancel out the other</p>
<p>demons to make up for</p>
<p>a good point</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s got to be is there another</p>
<p>thing you know i didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>that like what if you let a</p>
<p>great lie had 12</p>
<p>babies you know</p>
<p>with your wife</p>
<p>but masturbated</p>
<p>three times you get to heaven you have</p>
<p>three little</p>
<p>demon babies you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still gonna</p>
<p>the whole lives</p>
<p>like tasks you can do on</p>
<p>earth that cancel out your</p>
<p>demon babies</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gotta be you</p>
<p>gotta look into</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be because</p>
<p>what about people</p>
<p>that are trying to convert into this religion</p>
<p>and like i would but god damn if i do that</p>
<p>the jews don&rsquo;t give a fuck i already got 75 000</p>
<p>jews yeah those</p>
<p>recruiting religion</p>
<p>ever they don&rsquo;t give a fuck we try to convince</p>
<p>you not to do it yeah they make it really hard to</p>
<p>do it also the jewish thing yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a regular do this thing</p>
<p>i never heard of this before</p>
<p>you remember</p>
<p>when david was a king the juke so</p>
<p>powerful that they wouldn&rsquo;t allow any conversions</p>
<p>wow they&rsquo;re like no one&rsquo;s doing it for the</p>
<p>right reasons we can&rsquo;t risk it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s deep yeah</p>
<p>and you guys</p>
<p>what do you guys</p>
<p>think of jesus</p>
<p>they think that he was a real person</p>
<p>okay that spoke</p>
<p>about things he</p>
<p>was a sort of</p>
<p>a wise man but they effective went off the deep end</p>
<p>so they looked down on christianity for</p>
<p>choosing jesus as</p>
<p>their savior</p>
<p>and lord yes they</p>
<p>would say that no no that&rsquo;s not the right</p>
<p>guy to choose</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so funny how they&rsquo;re all sort of kind of connected</p>
<p>like judaism is</p>
<p>sort of kind of connected with christianity</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>all the really conservative</p>
<p>fundamentalist christians wanted to control israel</p>
<p>and support israel</p>
<p>they believe in the rapture</p>
<p>and they believe</p>
<p>that you know when the shit goes down that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>place to be</p>
<p>like you have</p>
<p>to protect them but they believe that they&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>even though the</p>
<p>bible says that they&rsquo;re the chosen people</p>
<p>the christians to go yeah but you guys got the</p>
<p>story all fucked up we got it</p>
<p>right and and don&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be an awesome</p>
<p>thing for the jews if it came out</p>
<p>the jesus actually never existed</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be like dude you guys he never even existed</p>
<p>you know what i mean that would</p>
<p>crush the christian well what</p>
<p>proof do they have that jesus</p>
<p>existed historical</p>
<p>documents well i looked online man and</p>
<p>apparently that&rsquo;s very much in debate</p>
<p>very much in debate yeah there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of scholars that do not believe he was an actual person</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot muslims</p>
<p>islams believe that jesus</p>
<p>existed but just was a man</p>
<p>the jews believe that</p>
<p>jesus existed and he was mad</p>
<p>and it would</p>
<p>it would benefit</p>
<p>their cost because they</p>
<p>would kill each</p>
<p>other they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>slice each other</p>
<p>if you weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>their religion</p>
<p>i believe that they</p>
<p>would the former rap</p>
<p>the great revised</p>
<p>would talk about who he was</p>
<p>jesus see that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>my thing is</p>
<p>that makes me</p>
<p>think that he</p>
<p>even though there isn&rsquo;t that much</p>
<p>proof that he actually wants to</p>
<p>laugh there&rsquo;s a lot of holes and i want dvd</p>
<p>the god that</p>
<p>never was all that shit</p>
<p>you how could</p>
<p>how come the jews in the</p>
<p>muslims don&rsquo;t jump on that</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>never existed</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>yeah exactly so that makes me</p>
<p>think damn he probably was a man who was a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker who knows who</p>
<p>knows what it</p>
<p>sounds like but the issue is</p>
<p>if the guy existed</p>
<p>for sure he didn&rsquo;t walk on</p>
<p>water and come back from the dead yeah</p>
<p>that was like that was like</p>
<p>like someone thinking bruce lee</p>
<p>could really beat up 50 people</p>
<p>you know what i mean like</p>
<p>bruce lee the real god</p>
<p>and bruce lee the superstar</p>
<p>two different fucking people but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hilarious how many people banked their life on some</p>
<p>story that would not make any fucking</p>
<p>sense if you told it today</p>
<p>like if you told that</p>
<p>story today</p>
<p>and said there was a dude who walked on</p>
<p>water and came back from dead everybody</p>
<p>would go just shut the fuck up that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s 2 000 years ago everybody&rsquo;s like whoa</p>
<p>that shit could really happen isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>nuts like anything</p>
<p>like rational people that you talked to that would</p>
<p>there was a guy that we were doing fear factor who</p>
<p>we did a the family fear factor we came to people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>houses and made him do things</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>traveled all across the country this dude was a</p>
<p>teacher he was a fucking math teacher</p>
<p>and he was telling me like</p>
<p>scientifically</p>
<p>that jesus existed</p>
<p>because you can</p>
<p>prove it because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve looked at molecules</p>
<p>that are too complex to have just</p>
<p>occurred naturally</p>
<p>this is a super that&rsquo;s a ridiculous argument</p>
<p>here and this is</p>
<p>super super smart guy</p>
<p>and i was listening to him talk you know supposedly</p>
<p>super smart guy</p>
<p>and i was listening to this guy</p>
<p>talking like how nutty is that</p>
<p>but this guy can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>that he believes in some</p>
<p>also that&rsquo;s not the reason you can say anything</p>
<p>existent because something was too amazing to</p>
<p>exist naturally</p>
<p>like millions</p>
<p>and millions</p>
<p>of faces that does not</p>
<p>she sees somebody draw a</p>
<p>picture of jesus</p>
<p>with the captures</p>
<p>of this is jesus</p>
<p>right but you can</p>
<p>never say that nothing can</p>
<p>exist naturally you don&rsquo;t know the power of nature</p>
<p>nature is absolutely ridiculous</p>
<p>completely unpredictable there&rsquo;s subatomic particles</p>
<p>that blink in and out of</p>
<p>existence all the time they appear</p>
<p>in two places at once this is science</p>
<p>real shit we know that</p>
<p>exists in nature</p>
<p>the whole pattern of nature is</p>
<p>gigantic the fibonacci</p>
<p>sequence that you see in pine cones</p>
<p>and pineapples and all sorts of different</p>
<p>plants and it exists in</p>
<p>human facial features and</p>
<p>this is like a mathematical code</p>
<p>to all this stuff</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s a fucking dude</p>
<p>pressing the button</p>
<p>it might mean that the whole</p>
<p>thing is just</p>
<p>super complicated and conscious</p>
<p>what do they do</p>
<p>pressing the button</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a god</p>
<p>we want to break it down to someone like us</p>
<p>want to like make a</p>
<p>super version of us</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s running well yeah you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about that the old man with the beard in the sky</p>
<p>but jesus on</p>
<p>everything everything</p>
<p>every oh no for sure</p>
<p>of course that</p>
<p>of course of</p>
<p>course of course</p>
<p>no no of course but</p>
<p>it sounded like you were saying</p>
<p>that you were describing</p>
<p>how wonderful the universe is</p>
<p>in the fibonacci</p>
<p>series and how it&rsquo;s all like this</p>
<p>code and structure</p>
<p>the greatest why</p>
<p>did there have</p>
<p>to be a god doing</p>
<p>that like to me i was like that there is an intelligent</p>
<p>other side that is way too complex for us to</p>
<p>understand it</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s what i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it is i mean it</p>
<p>could be that</p>
<p>everything has an intelligence</p>
<p>about it what i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it is is</p>
<p>a single entity</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s much more likely that the</p>
<p>whole of course</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interconnected</p>
<p>thing we totally agree</p>
<p>like an ocean</p>
<p>the ocean and then we&rsquo;re like little</p>
<p>water molecules</p>
<p>the ocean it&rsquo;s all exactly and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experiences feel like it feels like you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>ocean sometimes it feels like you&rsquo;re all connected</p>
<p>all around you to something that you don&rsquo;t see ordinary</p>
<p>those mushrooms</p>
<p>i never told you</p>
<p>i did them by myself</p>
<p>on a fucking</p>
<p>thursday night i</p>
<p>decided a party by myself</p>
<p>yeah then i took all</p>
<p>those fucking mushrooms i got</p>
<p>pictures and</p>
<p>everything and um</p>
<p>how many the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>double that wasn&rsquo;t five grams</p>
<p>no not five</p>
<p>grams it wasn&rsquo;t five i&rsquo;ve done five</p>
<p>grams before that was like</p>
<p>three and a half</p>
<p>okay so i did them all myself</p>
<p>and just want to let you know it</p>
<p>was it was pretty fucking insane</p>
<p>it was insane</p>
<p>but not as intense</p>
<p>as it would have been it at five</p>
<p>frames it was pretty intense but the five</p>
<p>grams like dm</p>
<p>five grams really is that threshold point</p>
<p>boom that was</p>
<p>about a year and a half ago when i did the five</p>
<p>grams of fucking</p>
<p>i was at a zoo</p>
<p>and i just woke up in the zoo</p>
<p>i thought doing mushrooms at the zoo</p>
<p>would be fucking awesome</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>mean outdoors you</p>
<p>get mushrooms go out of nature zoo</p>
<p>but that is like anti nature</p>
<p>fuck i freak the fuck out how</p>
<p>to get the fuck out</p>
<p>you were watching their sorrow</p>
<p>oh yeah for sure right we just had to get the fuck out</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>super negative man i feel terrible when i go</p>
<p>i do not like it at all it makes me feel bad</p>
<p>i used to enjoy it because i used to</p>
<p>enjoy staring at the animals</p>
<p>but then one time i went high</p>
<p>i went one time when i was super baked what i did</p>
<p>what i did when i was super baked</p>
<p>i i got really i felt terrible i got really sad</p>
<p>i thought it was</p>
<p>you know the terrible terrible</p>
<p>thing that they were doing was just</p>
<p>taking these animals and shoving them into</p>
<p>these cages</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even get to do it and they just pace</p>
<p>you got a polar bear at the la zoo</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just pace back and forth by that back door</p>
<p>just waiting for that fucking back</p>
<p>white door it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>fake eyes in a white door</p>
<p>right there by white door</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s horrible man</p>
<p>i freak the fuck out</p>
<p>went out to the parking lot and</p>
<p>this chick i was with me we did the exact same thing</p>
<p>and we saw the exact same shit</p>
<p>we looked at the mountain</p>
<p>we would stop in the middle of the parking lot because</p>
<p>everything was connected it was all connected</p>
<p>but look at the sky</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this guy would dance before and like</p>
<p>aztec writing</p>
<p>we look at the mountains in the distance like</p>
<p>miles away like pasadena mountains</p>
<p>and all this like</p>
<p>aztec pattern they&rsquo;re forming the</p>
<p>aztec pattern isn&rsquo;t that interesting and i was</p>
<p>like are you seeing when you look at the mountains</p>
<p>what do you see it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the aztec patterns</p>
<p>dance then look at the sky the clouds the clouds are</p>
<p>in their spot for a second and then they form</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>connor tell me because connor is the one who</p>
<p>turned me on to the dude who had him</p>
<p>he said the same</p>
<p>goes dude the</p>
<p>clouds gonna</p>
<p>dance for you</p>
<p>wow i didn&rsquo;t even pay attention to that really</p>
<p>until it was actually happening</p>
<p>we get in the fucking car you&rsquo;re like okay cool i</p>
<p>swear to god i was driving on the freeway</p>
<p>freaking out i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if there was cars next to me on the side of me</p>
<p>but it really did look like</p>
<p>as i was driving on the freeway like</p>
<p>like i was in</p>
<p>like i was in</p>
<p>what dreams may come remember that shit</p>
<p>i was driving on the freeway</p>
<p>and it was like rose petals and</p>
<p>like bushes</p>
<p>would form in</p>
<p>front of my car i&rsquo;m driving really rose</p>
<p>petals and bushes whoa</p>
<p>it was fucking insane</p>
<p>that by the way we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to encourage</p>
<p>i just wanted to get home</p>
<p>no i was just trying to get home</p>
<p>all i wanted</p>
<p>exactly all i wanted to do is get home</p>
<p>get in my little fucking dark room</p>
<p>i just close my eyes and</p>
<p>enjoy that light show</p>
<p>cause that light show was fucking</p>
<p>insane the twirling beauty of</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>explain it it&rsquo;s just fucking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i want to say</p>
<p>i want to see why do you</p>
<p>think that you see certain like religious</p>
<p>symbolism and like</p>
<p>hindu shit and buddhas</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where they got it from</p>
<p>you think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where they got it from</p>
<p>yeah must be right</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been doing mushrooms</p>
<p>since the dawn of time</p>
<p>of course that</p>
<p>when i looked at him like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where all this shit comes from</p>
<p>all that alex gray shit</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s telling you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s coming from well alex gray</p>
<p>is but these old cut like</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>those things that i have in my</p>
<p>office of the garuda</p>
<p>those birds</p>
<p>you know those you know i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about in the media room</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re these</p>
<p>crazy psychedelic birds</p>
<p>and when i did dmt ones</p>
<p>i saw those</p>
<p>things i saw</p>
<p>that imagery</p>
<p>and then when i went to a</p>
<p>store and saw them for sale i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>oh my god whoever</p>
<p>created that</p>
<p>thing was there</p>
<p>they had to have seen that you</p>
<p>could see that first</p>
<p>well why is that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>is that or i mean is it something that&rsquo;s already there</p>
<p>we just can&rsquo;t tune into it</p>
<p>until we take</p>
<p>psychedelics</p>
<p>or is it the same</p>
<p>hallucination happens to</p>
<p>every person takes a drug</p>
<p>i think i mean is that possible</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it opens up your</p>
<p>senses somehow to this</p>
<p>other dimension and all</p>
<p>these dimensions that are all around us</p>
<p>and right like we&rsquo;re in a radio</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>tuned in to 97</p>
<p>point one we</p>
<p>got an infinite number of stations we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going to another station</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible to what was that i</p>
<p>think it just fucks with the</p>
<p>brain makes it</p>
<p>make see things</p>
<p>weird possible</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t personally</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the shit that i&rsquo;m seeing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re seeing but the shit that i&rsquo;m seeing</p>
<p>five grams i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve done five grams</p>
<p>but the shit you</p>
<p>say when you do five</p>
<p>grams is for me</p>
<p>who knows it seems</p>
<p>impossible for me to</p>
<p>dream that up in my</p>
<p>brain like it&rsquo;s just the most</p>
<p>beautifully constructed flowing</p>
<p>shapes of nothing</p>
<p>random and you know when you&rsquo;re not high you</p>
<p>close your eyes you see like</p>
<p>random blackness and there&rsquo;s no pattern this is like</p>
<p>you might see</p>
<p>lit or tight</p>
<p>flashes of light</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>close your eyes on mushroom</p>
<p>all of a sudden</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a show</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about a thousand times</p>
<p>more complex than that visualizer you got on itunes</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s pretty fucking cool</p>
<p>visualize pretty cool</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in that same</p>
<p>thing but a thousand times more complex</p>
<p>way more complex</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not making</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not designing this i&rsquo;m not controlling this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s someone</p>
<p>else controlling this someone else is making this shit</p>
<p>not me it seems like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely one option but another option</p>
<p>is that that</p>
<p>stuff super charges your perceptions</p>
<p>and just makes your</p>
<p>imagination more hypersensitive and it makes your</p>
<p>visualizations go wild</p>
<p>because it reacts with you know also</p>
<p>the parasite</p>
<p>eyes that you use to see</p>
<p>things this is parasite</p>
<p>it lives in the sewers and it only feeds on cats brains</p>
<p>so what it does is it&rsquo;s like a worm right</p>
<p>yeah but it lets</p>
<p>rats eat them</p>
<p>and then it burrows</p>
<p>into their brain and the only</p>
<p>thing that changes the rats and</p>
<p>change any behavior at all</p>
<p>except it takes</p>
<p>their way their fear of cats</p>
<p>so they will get</p>
<p>eaten by a cat</p>
<p>everything else is saying they eat</p>
<p>and breathe and do</p>
<p>everything when they</p>
<p>say what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>nothing major</p>
<p>cat kills it goes into the</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s his</p>
<p>brains i know it&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>fine we talked</p>
<p>about this one on the show the</p>
<p>other one that they do</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a worm that gets inside a grasshopper</p>
<p>it convinces the grasshopper to commit suicide</p>
<p>so that it can</p>
<p>hatch out of its body</p>
<p>it grows into the</p>
<p>grasshopper</p>
<p>and teaches the grasshopper to jump into the</p>
<p>water and kill itself</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an aquatic worm</p>
<p>so it has to be hatched in the fucking</p>
<p>water how nutty</p>
<p>are things like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just crazy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>existing on a</p>
<p>whole new level of yeah</p>
<p>like this that</p>
<p>alone right there</p>
<p>is so fucking amazing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so amazing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just another like</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something going on dude i just</p>
<p>think something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on i think well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely something</p>
<p>going on but i</p>
<p>think our idea that our</p>
<p>culture is based on</p>
<p>is just that we want it to be</p>
<p>close to us</p>
<p>we want it to be like a</p>
<p>super version of us</p>
<p>which is like what a god is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>super version of a human</p>
<p>but you know with all</p>
<p>these rules and god is you know</p>
<p>fucking kind of vindictive</p>
<p>and gets pissed at you if you fuck up</p>
<p>and you know a lot of</p>
<p>religions will kill you if you don&rsquo;t listen to them</p>
<p>you know we want it like a</p>
<p>super virgin</p>
<p>plus but it&rsquo;s much more possible that this whole</p>
<p>thing is just</p>
<p>connected to something that you can&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>you know some big</p>
<p>powerful thing</p>
<p>that feeds off itself</p>
<p>everything in this world</p>
<p>has a role and plays a part in this thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;re used to it</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t realize how nutty</p>
<p>it really fucking is because we&rsquo;re used to it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just a normal part of our day</p>
<p>and people get used to anything</p>
<p>people in africa have</p>
<p>giant plates they</p>
<p>stick in their lips</p>
<p>and all the girls do it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re used to it we just get used to</p>
<p>stupid shit</p>
<p>and once we&rsquo;re used to something then</p>
<p>everything becomes fine</p>
<p>and then we</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;s some sort of a</p>
<p>grand order to</p>
<p>things you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>getting weirder and</p>
<p>weirder as i got</p>
<p>older as i get</p>
<p>older and i look at</p>
<p>our culture and i</p>
<p>look at life on this planet i look at my own mortality</p>
<p>you know the fact that i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you know the next half of my life is</p>
<p>gonna be the half of my life</p>
<p>where my body</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work good</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s just the way it is just</p>
<p>getting close to dying</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have health issues if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch your diet you know</p>
<p>you have to make sure you get the proper</p>
<p>sleep or you</p>
<p>might get heart attacks and shit like</p>
<p>things start</p>
<p>going wrong</p>
<p>when you really</p>
<p>start assessing this whole big</p>
<p>picture of what this really is like</p>
<p>god it&rsquo;s like i</p>
<p>feel like i&rsquo;ve been flying without a manual for so long</p>
<p>like just operating my life</p>
<p>not really having</p>
<p>any idea how to do it correctly just fucking up</p>
<p>learning from my fuck ups</p>
<p>starting from scratch</p>
<p>i feel like there&rsquo;s got to be a way better way to</p>
<p>learn life than the way we do it</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like by the time you get christian</p>
<p>by the time you can get yourself</p>
<p>your own personality figured out</p>
<p>and your own the way you interact with people</p>
<p>figuring out</p>
<p>by the time you get that figured out it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>god you&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>dying every guy</p>
<p>every guy has an</p>
<p>age they think oh</p>
<p>if i know what i do now and i go back to</p>
<p>that age i get laid so much oh god yeah</p>
<p>you look like you were 30 for like 30 years</p>
<p>yeah let me figure</p>
<p>that shit i knew i</p>
<p>was like 19 i knew right now</p>
<p>maybe better</p>
<p>maybe more advancements in skincare for men</p>
<p>it seems like we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>supposed to live long enough to figure this out</p>
<p>it seems like</p>
<p>the reason why turtles live to be 1 000 years old</p>
<p>are people in</p>
<p>life to be 100</p>
<p>is because we&rsquo;re not supposed to</p>
<p>it would turn</p>
<p>into a thousand years yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some tortoises no way</p>
<p>i watch discovery all the fucking time</p>
<p>was that a national geographic</p>
<p>god damn it</p>
<p>that was like today right now</p>
<p>god damn a thousand years old</p>
<p>damn so they</p>
<p>literally lived like back when people were writing</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>fucking what was the thousand year old writing they</p>
<p>should put like little black boxes on the time like</p>
<p>write everything out on paper yeah</p>
<p>a thousand years ago they</p>
<p>might have been doing it on animal skins to a lot</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s crazy you know like the dead sea</p>
<p>scrolls that shit was all written on animal skins</p>
<p>those motherfuckers didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>paper they didn&rsquo;t even have paper back there</p>
<p>could be a dead sea squirrel on a fucking turtle right</p>
<p>i wish i knew for sure who&rsquo;s telling the</p>
<p>truth about the dead sea squirrels</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t have enough time to</p>
<p>learn ancient hebrew</p>
<p>or what is it aromantic</p>
<p>and go back and read the dead sea</p>
<p>scrolls and decipher it for myself</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s all this dispute on what the dead sea</p>
<p>scrolls actually mean</p>
<p>and some people say that it contains</p>
<p>all kinds of nutty shit like fucking ufos and flying</p>
<p>saucers and</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s guys who have deciphered from dead sea</p>
<p>scrolls like the john marco</p>
<p>leggo guy says it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about mushrooms he said</p>
<p>all it was about was them eating the ammonium</p>
<p>scaring mushroom</p>
<p>and fertility rituals and he</p>
<p>breaks it all down like</p>
<p>the origins of the words but</p>
<p>people argue</p>
<p>against him and</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>common they</p>
<p>should have a fucking live</p>
<p>thing on abc</p>
<p>where they all all</p>
<p>the best scientists on the planet all the best language</p>
<p>they get together</p>
<p>that should be important</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s disciple</p>
<p>the shit in</p>
<p>front of the world</p>
<p>live satellite feed from fucking friends</p>
<p>the guy who</p>
<p>wrote that book but</p>
<p>he was the one of the head guys</p>
<p>the sidekick and dead sea scrolls</p>
<p>he worked on it</p>
<p>for 14 years and he was the only agnostic in the group</p>
<p>you know they had a</p>
<p>bunch of people that were ordained ministers and</p>
<p>they were the deciphers they were all religious people</p>
<p>and he started out a religious person but when he</p>
<p>started studying theology</p>
<p>he realized somewhere</p>
<p>along the line this is</p>
<p>obviously bullshit</p>
<p>and he just became agnostic</p>
<p>so he looked at the</p>
<p>whole picture</p>
<p>completely different than all the</p>
<p>other guys they all</p>
<p>refuted his findings</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of people that say he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right a lot</p>
<p>of people that say that he was the head scholar</p>
<p>he was the number</p>
<p>one dude and he was the guy who had it all right</p>
<p>he was the guy who was looking at it objectively</p>
<p>and everybody else was looking at it with a religious</p>
<p>slam this fucking guy</p>
<p>thinks it was all</p>
<p>about mushrooms</p>
<p>it was all about</p>
<p>psychedelic mushrooms that</p>
<p>they would hide</p>
<p>these mushrooms from the</p>
<p>romans and they</p>
<p>would hide what the</p>
<p>magic and what the mushrooms can do</p>
<p>and the way they hid it from them was in stories</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>write it down for</p>
<p>like a thousand years they just told each other as a</p>
<p>story for a thousand years</p>
<p>so it just became all fucked up</p>
<p>and so he breaks down</p>
<p>like ancient words</p>
<p>he broke down the word christ</p>
<p>brought it back to an ancient</p>
<p>sumerian word that means a mushroom</p>
<p>covered in god semen</p>
<p>because when</p>
<p>they thought it was raining it thought god was coming</p>
<p>on the earth</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why things</p>
<p>would come up on the</p>
<p>earth like come wasn&rsquo;t bad to them</p>
<p>so like when god</p>
<p>would reign</p>
<p>and he was coming on the earth</p>
<p>these mushrooms</p>
<p>would just appear because they didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>microscopes</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>a spore is they couldn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>microscopic</p>
<p>things so they didn&rsquo;t see any seed or anything and also</p>
<p>these big mushrooms appear</p>
<p>like the next day</p>
<p>they grow quick</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>start eating them and they trip</p>
<p>their fucking</p>
<p>balls out they don&rsquo;t want anybody else to know</p>
<p>about this so they</p>
<p>tried to hide this information they were told oh they</p>
<p>were keeping it from</p>
<p>their enemies</p>
<p>wow isn&rsquo;t that nuts god jerk it off</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they</p>
<p>used to look at it or did he pull out of</p>
<p>some goddesses</p>
<p>he came somehow dude you gotta think of this</p>
<p>like daddy you gotta think</p>
<p>if it feels so good to have a baby</p>
<p>right now think about how good it feels to have a baby</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s an amazing incredible feeling</p>
<p>but most babies now they live</p>
<p>they live to be grown ups they go to be</p>
<p>adults they</p>
<p>think you don&rsquo;t have to worry about them getting</p>
<p>eaten by lions you don&rsquo;t have to worry about plague</p>
<p>but the people</p>
<p>that live back then have the same love for their kids</p>
<p>as we do now</p>
<p>but they couldn&rsquo;t help it</p>
<p>so there were</p>
<p>people were</p>
<p>dying left and</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s nothing you can do to stop it</p>
<p>that must have been nuts man</p>
<p>that must have been fucking horrifying</p>
<p>to have kids have just</p>
<p>died well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why they had all</p>
<p>these rituals</p>
<p>it was like fertility rituals are so important</p>
<p>they want to have as many kids as possible</p>
<p>they wanted</p>
<p>to tell we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in ovulation</p>
<p>roman times 50</p>
<p>lots of people die</p>
<p>after kids god damn</p>
<p>before what</p>
<p>what is the</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably like</p>
<p>adulthood i</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make sense like</p>
<p>only half of them make it</p>
<p>to adulthood</p>
<p>oh god it&rsquo;s so fucked up</p>
<p>imagine what it was</p>
<p>like that was on discovery</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t know the history channel</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t quote me on that</p>
<p>oh no that makes</p>
<p>sense i remember that look it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even if it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fifty percent</p>
<p>it had to be a high number i mean they just</p>
<p>you guys can someone</p>
<p>check that mortality rate and</p>
<p>roman times</p>
<p>over that shit</p>
<p>so i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fifty percent</p>
<p>could be wrong</p>
<p>dude i&rsquo;ve had two</p>
<p>major surgeries</p>
<p>both my knees reconstructed</p>
<p>both acl&rsquo;s and one</p>
<p>more minor surgery my menescus surgery on my knee</p>
<p>but if i lived</p>
<p>you know a thousand</p>
<p>years ago i&rsquo;d be fucked man i&rsquo;d be fucked you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be doing</p>
<p>jiu jitsu no i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t have been playing</p>
<p>by a small step by a school</p>
<p>do it working you</p>
<p>learn to been a softball champion</p>
<p>softball i smash my knees</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s guys out there they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>champions of softball</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re the fucking</p>
<p>mark mcguire of softball</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s guys out there will do this that crazy</p>
<p>who is the hicks and gracie</p>
<p>of softball we need to find that out</p>
<p>hicks and gracie of softball</p>
<p>how accurate can you be when you whip that fucking</p>
<p>thing around they are that looks dope that&rsquo;s nuts them</p>
<p>chicks yeah it all</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;ve ever seen a chick</p>
<p>throw that hard regular</p>
<p>have you ever seen a chick throw that hard regular it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clearly the right way to do it</p>
<p>yeah why are they throwing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like breaking the balls and pool</p>
<p>you know you try to break the balls really hard</p>
<p>if you want like a little person they have like a</p>
<p>loose wrist and just</p>
<p>smash is like a tiny</p>
<p>to it where they just know exactly how to put</p>
<p>their weight into it just hmm</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird like</p>
<p>jujutsu such as certain</p>
<p>things when it comes to techniques</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the more you do techniques</p>
<p>the more those techniques</p>
<p>just become ingrained the way your body moves</p>
<p>your body just gets real good at the movement</p>
<p>so you teach your body move what do you</p>
<p>think of jay</p>
<p>shields control and i fucking incredible</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a natural</p>
<p>17 pounder dan henderson&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>monster he took</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just impressed as fuck that he survived</p>
<p>that first round</p>
<p>that first round he got face</p>
<p>planted he got</p>
<p>ballasted like henderson you have here</p>
<p>on the button no i do i erased it</p>
<p>i raised it</p>
<p>henderson hit him on the button you</p>
<p>erased it yeah i erased it</p>
<p>get it online</p>
<p>we could get it online</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll watch that</p>
<p>but uh henderson face plant</p>
<p>face plants</p>
<p>yeah he just have shields</p>
<p>blindly died for a dude</p>
<p>he got cracked and then henderson hits him</p>
<p>again with a hard uppercut dude</p>
<p>and he goes down again he got fucked up in that</p>
<p>first round i was like i always got a chance</p>
<p>but then he came on</p>
<p>strong in the second round and henderson</p>
<p>started to fade a little bit and jake</p>
<p>shield started taking him down</p>
<p>fucking controlling them and they were saying that</p>
<p>that henderson&rsquo;s been having problems with his back</p>
<p>so you know</p>
<p>he looked kind of</p>
<p>stiff that could have been what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on i could have been why couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t stuff the take down but man shields look good</p>
<p>total control</p>
<p>mounted them</p>
<p>just mounted them over and over again</p>
<p>and henderson could not shake them</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t finish them</p>
<p>and never went for one arm walk with that said it&rsquo;s 420</p>
<p>it is 420 on 420</p>
<p>ridiculous oh my goodness</p>
<p>i am high yeah this is ridiculous</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed to do this</p>
<p>i think four twenty is time to order pizza no</p>
<p>wait can me and i want</p>
<p>this is a tv show</p>
<p>no it just takes they don&rsquo;t give a shit</p>
<p>they do though</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people listening this on itunes too</p>
<p>at this point in</p>
<p>time they&rsquo;re already like are we allowed to eat pizza</p>
<p>i bet no one says no</p>
<p>yeah dude i</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even read son</p>
<p>look i need to get you goddamn more pizza more pizza</p>
<p>pizza for everyone eyeballs fixed</p>
<p>how can you have</p>
<p>an operation get your eyeballs fixed</p>
<p>no no pizza fuck you</p>
<p>fuck you happy three eighty seven hey</p>
<p>how come you haven&rsquo;t got your eyeballs</p>
<p>are you scared of that</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m not scared at all i just haven&rsquo;t done it</p>
<p>would you want to do it yeah</p>
<p>what about you that part eventually</p>
<p>but like the contacts is just so easy like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know their answer i never even got contacts</p>
<p>sometimes i leave my contacts in for like</p>
<p>three or four days and shit i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re supposed to but don&rsquo;t you want to get him</p>
<p>fixed though would you like to not have the contacts</p>
<p>i yeah tell us we gotta make a plan</p>
<p>this pretty incredible</p>
<p>you can see better</p>
<p>yeah i see fine how naughty is that</p>
<p>means see seeing is so fucking important</p>
<p>you can fix it with a little</p>
<p>piece of plastic</p>
<p>how did they figure that shit</p>
<p>out they figure</p>
<p>out contacts someone figure that out that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>house inventions of all i want to see a documentary</p>
<p>all the shit that people change things right now</p>
<p>think about what all the shit that people can do</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s getting so nutty</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting so crazy yeah</p>
<p>what the fuck is gonna be the next big thing</p>
<p>because no one saw the internet coming</p>
<p>you know no one ever thought it was</p>
<p>gonna affect people the way it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>affecting the human race right now because if they did</p>
<p>they would have never let it get out</p>
<p>no corporations</p>
<p>would have ever wanted the internet it&rsquo;s too tricky</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s too hard to control</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s too unpredictable</p>
<p>what the fuck is gonna be the next thing is this isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna be the last thing you don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be like it&rsquo;s gonna be like hologram laptops</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just gonna need like maybe a little</p>
<p>little block and then it just blows up or something</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s gonna be neural</p>
<p>just thinking it happens i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna be neural implants or</p>
<p>the other idea that i have is</p>
<p>was not a neural implant but that they figure out the</p>
<p>frequency of your brain</p>
<p>like what if they</p>
<p>could get your brain to work like a wi fi signal</p>
<p>like what if your brain</p>
<p>like obviously</p>
<p>input comes into your brain</p>
<p>in the form of hearing things and seeing</p>
<p>things and these electrical impulses wherever the hell</p>
<p>sight and sound is created</p>
<p>and how you represent that stuff in your head</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like those are like signals that are coming in</p>
<p>from your eyes from your organs</p>
<p>what if there&rsquo;s a way to get that signal</p>
<p>out into the air</p>
<p>so instead of like having to be like directly</p>
<p>input into your brain with</p>
<p>just you know with</p>
<p>sight signals and with you know</p>
<p>the signals that your ear is giving what if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>to tune the whole mind like a wi fi with some sort of a</p>
<p>neural implant or something that</p>
<p>activates a certain portion of the brain</p>
<p>and literally allows your</p>
<p>brain to tune in to everyone else&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>like we all</p>
<p>share a giant hard drive</p>
<p>like that totally seems possible</p>
<p>it seems to me like</p>
<p>they just have to figure out</p>
<p>how that would work and what kind of a</p>
<p>frequency that would operate under but if</p>
<p>they can introduce</p>
<p>all sorts of things in the people&rsquo;s brains this guy</p>
<p>they did an operation on him</p>
<p>and they stimulated a part of his brain</p>
<p>and he started</p>
<p>i forget what they were trying to do</p>
<p>this was an accident</p>
<p>but in stimulating part of his brain</p>
<p>he started remembering shit from his</p>
<p>childhood like in</p>
<p>graphic detail like it was happening</p>
<p>right there right in front of him</p>
<p>like they literally figured out how to charge</p>
<p>and jump start your memories</p>
<p>you know if they</p>
<p>could do shit like that</p>
<p>they can introduce thoughts to people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>minds they can read vision they can read vision now</p>
<p>they can like put little</p>
<p>things on your head</p>
<p>and you look at something</p>
<p>and a computer will show an image</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible it&rsquo;s the same i mean not good</p>
<p>not a good image they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t figured it out good yet but if you read letters</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d like see the letter a</p>
<p>really yes but</p>
<p>not like pecan</p>
<p>not yet not yet but dude it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>close man well then they&rsquo;ll be able to figure out like</p>
<p>memories exactly</p>
<p>as we might</p>
<p>but how do we</p>
<p>rethink the</p>
<p>world if we realize that</p>
<p>memories are</p>
<p>completely unpredictable</p>
<p>that memories are</p>
<p>so easy to scramble</p>
<p>when you think</p>
<p>about how much of</p>
<p>human history</p>
<p>was just written down and</p>
<p>spoken on memories</p>
<p>lately when i get to argue</p>
<p>about somebody</p>
<p>about something some</p>
<p>waste things happen</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like no that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like you know what we&rsquo;re just remembering it</p>
<p>and i have no idea if i&rsquo;m the one is</p>
<p>wrong or they are</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good way to look at it</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;d like to say like no no no you&rsquo;re remembering it</p>
<p>wrong but it&rsquo;s like why do i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m the one</p>
<p>you gotta be</p>
<p>you gotta be real careful</p>
<p>about that i went back to my town</p>
<p>where i grew up in</p>
<p>i hadn&rsquo;t been there in like 10 years</p>
<p>and i remembered</p>
<p>everything different man i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never forget that my</p>
<p>house looked different</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>street looked different i thought</p>
<p>the staircase was on a different side of the</p>
<p>street like i had it all fucked up in my head</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weird i went to the</p>
<p>place that i love that when i was</p>
<p>three in la</p>
<p>and apartment and my dad got my mom</p>
<p>it was exactly like i</p>
<p>really yeah i was shocked</p>
<p>remembers in a different</p>
<p>way some places changed</p>
<p>they might knock down a</p>
<p>building and change shit around you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that building was exactly the same</p>
<p>how old you remember</p>
<p>that three i got like</p>
<p>maybe four images</p>
<p>from three that&rsquo;s cool you</p>
<p>know what i mean but the way the</p>
<p>street looked at you know</p>
<p>the safeway it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>that safeway</p>
<p>i feel like</p>
<p>this time you&rsquo;re just remembering having remembered</p>
<p>you know so you remember the memory you had a year ago</p>
<p>and then you remember the</p>
<p>memory you had</p>
<p>two for that</p>
<p>you remember your memory of the yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think i have</p>
<p>those original old memories</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about and then</p>
<p>one little thing can</p>
<p>throw you off and then it</p>
<p>shifts your idea oh no that&rsquo;s not what happened</p>
<p>oh wait no no no this happened and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden you see it better</p>
<p>but you were just committed to the way you saw it</p>
<p>10 seconds ago</p>
<p>it was the incorrect way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not fucking reliable enough</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what i was</p>
<p>thinking what i was</p>
<p>thinking before about</p>
<p>like the reason why</p>
<p>turtles lived to be a thousand years</p>
<p>and people only</p>
<p>lived to be a hundred</p>
<p>is i don&rsquo;t think you can</p>
<p>keep our purpose going</p>
<p>and keep us living</p>
<p>because the way society seems to work best</p>
<p>is that people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>live long enough to figure out that it&rsquo;s all bullshit</p>
<p>cause if they do then chaos</p>
<p>restructuring</p>
<p>everything goes</p>
<p>to a different way</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not the way that</p>
<p>humans are going</p>
<p>right now the way we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going is like</p>
<p>some sort of a global domination</p>
<p>thing some sort of a</p>
<p>technological singularity</p>
<p>thing we&rsquo;re moving further and further and further</p>
<p>if we were able to step back and</p>
<p>as a culture get old enough to realize how</p>
<p>silly that all is</p>
<p>and realize how much better life</p>
<p>would be if we all just</p>
<p>relaxed and shared resources and be nice to each</p>
<p>other and treat the</p>
<p>world as if</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re friends and work this all out together</p>
<p>but nothing</p>
<p>would ever get done</p>
<p>things get done because people</p>
<p>are competing when people competing people hate the</p>
<p>other people they&rsquo;re competing against</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>countries or companies or</p>
<p>political parties or anything so</p>
<p>when that kind of shit happens</p>
<p>that competition is why we make newer and better things</p>
<p>if there was no competition like that there</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be the pressure</p>
<p>to be the best at everything</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t hate the</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>there wouldn&rsquo;t be this pressure to dominate them and</p>
<p>crush them that&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>of progress</p>
<p>can we live in a</p>
<p>world like the amazon indians</p>
<p>in the whole world</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s a reason why</p>
<p>those dudes are</p>
<p>still running around with fucking</p>
<p>pieces of animal</p>
<p>flesh covering</p>
<p>their dick is that</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong maybe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>maybe it is it&rsquo;s certainly an alternative but i think</p>
<p>i think we have to look at</p>
<p>human nature as being natural</p>
<p>and i think that if we look at</p>
<p>everything else is being natural if we look at the way</p>
<p>wolves behave</p>
<p>and the way</p>
<p>monkeys behave we look at</p>
<p>their simple lives</p>
<p>as being natural why don&rsquo;t we look at the course of</p>
<p>humanity as being natural</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re pretending</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s something that we all consciously control</p>
<p>but if we do why is it so fucked up still</p>
<p>why is there so much political corruption</p>
<p>when we know there&rsquo;s so much political corruption</p>
<p>why are we still</p>
<p>going to war when</p>
<p>we know that wars are</p>
<p>ridiculous and that they&rsquo;re only ways for profit why we</p>
<p>keep continuing</p>
<p>along the same lines even though</p>
<p>rationally we must know at a certain</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>this is an insane way to live</p>
<p>well maybe it&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s just the way people live</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what people do i believe</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re moving towards</p>
<p>that this behavior</p>
<p>pushes us towards something it pushes us</p>
<p>towards some creation some kind of some global purpose</p>
<p>something some end of</p>
<p>world we&rsquo;re all in little</p>
<p>worlds thinking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about us</p>
<p>but meanwhile</p>
<p>you know whatever&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on you&rsquo;re just producing an energy</p>
<p>that needs to</p>
<p>collectively do something</p>
<p>to the world or something</p>
<p>like we got our little lives and it goes to what</p>
<p>ari was saying</p>
<p>about that parasite</p>
<p>like think about that</p>
<p>think about the animal that this parasite lives in</p>
<p>the animal this parasite lives in has no fucking idea</p>
<p>you know they have no idea no idea</p>
<p>not aware of</p>
<p>existence at all and</p>
<p>the rat has no idea</p>
<p>the cat has no idea what it eats the rat i mean the</p>
<p>whole thing is bananas</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bananas and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>interconnected</p>
<p>they said it&rsquo;s possible to make</p>
<p>those crazy cat ladies too because</p>
<p>a few people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>immune to the fucking parasite</p>
<p>they said there is a</p>
<p>certain person i don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>there is a certain cat parasite</p>
<p>that has infected a tremendous amount of the female</p>
<p>population in like brazil</p>
<p>and a bunch of</p>
<p>other countries and this is</p>
<p>an actual parasite that makes women more docile</p>
<p>yeah probably the same thing it was</p>
<p>no fear i have to look that up because i remember that</p>
<p>yeah but they make some da</p>
<p>sound make some ice for me market that shit</p>
<p>i know right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why women</p>
<p>in brazil i have to find this i have to google this</p>
<p>right now this is</p>
<p>too strange i have to find this out</p>
<p>because i can&rsquo;t remember what it was when i read it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just parasite</p>
<p>in brazil cats women i gotta find this fucking article</p>
<p>mood altering cat parasites make women friendly</p>
<p>and men into jerks dude that&rsquo;s brazil</p>
<p>i mean think about how many</p>
<p>how many really</p>
<p>friendly girls come from brazil and how many</p>
<p>super aggressive dudes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious yeah</p>
<p>if you look up what</p>
<p>google what i looked up</p>
<p>you come up with</p>
<p>quite a few articles about it it&rsquo;s a parasite that</p>
<p>causes rats to sacrifice themselves to cats</p>
<p>may also change human behavior</p>
<p>making women more outgoing and warm</p>
<p>hearted and men</p>
<p>more jealous and suspicious</p>
<p>the toxoplasma</p>
<p>protest is a shed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s shed in cat feces</p>
<p>which are then eaten by rats</p>
<p>infected rats become fearless in the presence of cats</p>
<p>which makes them easier to catch</p>
<p>which in turn</p>
<p>spreads the disease to new cats holy shit</p>
<p>it makes women nicer</p>
<p>and it makes men douchebags that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>nature is totally rooting against us</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re finding new ways to keep it fucked up how</p>
<p>crazy is that man how crazy is that because</p>
<p>men who are more douchey are more likely to fuck</p>
<p>a bunch of different women</p>
<p>and impregnate them like fuck their friends women and</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying like the more douchey the guy is</p>
<p>the more he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna do like creepy shit to go get laid</p>
<p>so the more likely it&rsquo;s gonna make like</p>
<p>accidental babies all over the place</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna keep spreading yeah maybe</p>
<p>nature likes douchebags</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it goes back to what i said it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really achieve</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s competition</p>
<p>and competition</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really mean anything</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s competition</p>
<p>like like primal</p>
<p>you know a man</p>
<p>who hates you you hate him and he hates you</p>
<p>and it really</p>
<p>forces you to work hard</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s why companies fucking hate each other</p>
<p>companies that compete</p>
<p>against each</p>
<p>other are rarely friendly</p>
<p>you know they fucking hate each other</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s the most efficient way to get</p>
<p>things done</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>light a fire</p>
<p>under someone&rsquo;s ass in</p>
<p>order to get the most productivity out of them</p>
<p>hate equals productivity</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>your life would certainly be better off if you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have that you know that aspect to you but you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be a</p>
<p>successful person</p>
<p>that aspect</p>
<p>to you either so uh</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like a mess fucked up shit like war</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to happen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a terrible conclusion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a terrible conclusion but</p>
<p>it might be that</p>
<p>everything we do is the way we&rsquo;re supposed to do it</p>
<p>yeah there you have it jealous for war</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that i</p>
<p>wanna do it</p>
<p>but someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna do it you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>way they&rsquo;ve been doing business forever it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take way too long for that to settle down</p>
<p>all these people that promise that they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna have war anymore</p>
<p>like look at</p>
<p>obama he promised that he was</p>
<p>gonna stop all this</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna pull people out and</p>
<p>just more in than ever</p>
<p>no i still think remember how</p>
<p>george bush</p>
<p>made fun of her playing golf they said</p>
<p>obama has already played more golf than george bush has</p>
<p>and like i think his</p>
<p>first term in his</p>
<p>first year he&rsquo;s played</p>
<p>thirty two times i said george</p>
<p>bush played</p>
<p>twenty eight and he called that flag for</p>
<p>twenty eight times</p>
<p>obama&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>smart guy very good speaker</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really all i i have to say</p>
<p>about in other than that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not seeing anything different</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not doing any of the</p>
<p>things he said he would do</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about the stimulus package i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna really happen with that or whether that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be able to look</p>
<p>into that shit because that&rsquo;s too fucking complicated</p>
<p>and did you look into healthcare</p>
<p>no they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even bother nah</p>
<p>fuck it well maybe a little documentary my problem</p>
<p>my problem with all the</p>
<p>stuff is where do i put my attention</p>
<p>how much time do i have in a day what do i want to</p>
<p>think about do i want to concentrate on</p>
<p>oh how are they fucking us</p>
<p>oh you know</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s this more corruption coming in what is this</p>
<p>do i really want to</p>
<p>focus on that</p>
<p>sometimes focus on the fucking november ballot</p>
<p>with a legalized</p>
<p>pot completely</p>
<p>that would be insane</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the latest</p>
<p>about re and</p>
<p>eddie and myself are medical patients we are</p>

<p>oh yeah you really thought he said johnny bravo</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s even funny</p>
<p>you know and then</p>
<p>immediately it starts off with just</p>
<p>a bunch of backhanded compliments like</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s got some good positions oh yeah but</p>
<p>you know mean already had a high guard like he was like</p>
<p>like basically saying that</p>
<p>nino had my</p>
<p>style of guard first when me and nino</p>
<p>style guards are totally different</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re nothing they&rsquo;re nothing they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very difficult to offer</p>
<p>i mean we both play</p>
<p>you know we do roma platas and</p>
<p>stuff and i got to build a plata for him but the actual</p>
<p>style of our guards is very different and</p>
<p>obviously he doesn&rsquo;t know that you know he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t he hasn&rsquo;t really paid attention good</p>
<p>enough to know the difference big fucking difference</p>
<p>and then he says other stuff like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a bunch of backhanded</p>
<p>compliments it wasn&rsquo;t very but</p>
<p>i thought it was hilarious and so she knew about that</p>
<p>so that she knew about that oh i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know you said a lot of good things about me thanks man</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>i really can&rsquo;t say anything bad about the record</p>
<p>you know i mean i don&rsquo;t even fucking know</p>
<p>well you know what man i think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that don&rsquo;t know you</p>
<p>and you have a polarizing effect</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re so controversial because</p>
<p>just i mean</p>
<p>the way you look the way you act you know</p>
<p>your behavior</p>
<p>is very controversial</p>
<p>you think about like</p>
<p>most jiu jitsu people</p>
<p>jiu jitsu instructors they&rsquo;re not like these wild</p>
<p>musician motherfuckers</p>
<p>you know that come up with</p>
<p>jiu jitsu moves because they&rsquo;re high on weed</p>
<p>like that fucks up their whole dynamic</p>
<p>their whole view of what you know jiu jitsu is and so</p>
<p>because a lot of dudes don&rsquo;t know you</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>the controversial</p>
<p>comes in but if they got to know you they realize</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just a completely open minded dude</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s willing to accept techniques from anywhere and</p>
<p>gives people credit all the time and you invent moves</p>
<p>or you teach moves</p>
<p>based on people&rsquo;s names</p>
<p>like the duda</p>
<p>or different</p>
<p>techniques that you&rsquo;ve got the jean jacques</p>
<p>suite that you got from</p>
<p>each individual you give them all credit</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>they see you getting all this credit for this</p>
<p>revolutionary type of</p>
<p>guard and so they just assume that it&rsquo;s all bullshit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all overhyped</p>
<p>when really it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not arrived you got</p>
<p>some weird wild shit you put it together in</p>
<p>like a real system</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very legit</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very unusual</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re willing to talk to anybody</p>
<p>and have them fuck with it</p>
<p>and come up with their own</p>
<p>stuff i mean look at all the different</p>
<p>things that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>added from your students</p>
<p>all the moves</p>
<p>edwin stuff you</p>
<p>know how you</p>
<p>start incorporating that into class</p>
<p>you know all sorts</p>
<p>of different shit the japanese neck times you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>adding whatever there&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;re always adding it and always giving</p>
<p>the person credit</p>
<p>who created it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s probably the one thing</p>
<p>that the biggest</p>
<p>misconception the biggest</p>
<p>is that you take credit for</p>
<p>things yeah is that i take moves and i</p>
<p>change the names</p>
<p>then i pretend like i made them up</p>
<p>and i put a</p>
<p>whole new name</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there to</p>
<p>think that and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like kind of true</p>
<p>or like not really sort of 50</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally the opposite</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the opposite i give everybody fucking</p>
<p>well like a</p>
<p>twister you know when you</p>
<p>first started doing the</p>
<p>twister and it</p>
<p>started wrestling</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a big that was the big</p>
<p>thing because i</p>
<p>never called it the</p>
<p>twister i got it was the</p>
<p>wrestlers guillotine to me but</p>
<p>the guillotine</p>
<p>was already</p>
<p>taken twister</p>
<p>right and jean zhang</p>
<p>it was the guillotine was already</p>
<p>taken in jiu</p>
<p>jitsu and submission</p>
<p>grappling all that shit</p>
<p>so when i would call</p>
<p>the guillotine</p>
<p>the brazilians just called it the</p>
<p>twister and it</p>
<p>stuck after a while</p>
<p>so a lot of people</p>
<p>think like russells go</p>
<p>that did that in high</p>
<p>school man i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>yeah you gotta know the</p>
<p>story so real quick</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to convince</p>
<p>those guys if they ask</p>
<p>about me like what&rsquo;s up with this</p>
<p>twister thing</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s a guillotine in wrestling</p>
<p>they go yeah yeah he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>bunch of moves like that dude he just</p>
<p>changed his names and then</p>
<p>real quick now i</p>
<p>gotta dig myself out a deep hole with</p>
<p>a lot of people like that that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a total opposite misconception</p>
<p>that i like take moves and</p>
<p>steal em and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like i did it for a</p>
<p>while and then</p>
<p>i had to stop and slow down and change my life</p>
<p>from day one</p>
<p>my first book i give everyone credit</p>
<p>my first broke</p>
<p>marcelo silverado do that</p>
<p>all that shit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve i get pissed off</p>
<p>when people</p>
<p>learn techniques</p>
<p>from someone else and i know them personally i know</p>
<p>where they got the move from</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>start showing it to someone</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>bring up the person that</p>
<p>taught them</p>
<p>that offends me</p>
<p>i always remember to</p>
<p>bring up names but i</p>
<p>tried to as much as i can you</p>
<p>think of jujutsu moves</p>
<p>as like a creative</p>
<p>thing that you&rsquo;re adding to like one big gigantic</p>
<p>piece of artwork like the martial art itself like</p>
<p>when you invent a new technique</p>
<p>like you invent some new</p>
<p>sweep or some new way to set up a google plata</p>
<p>and then you add it to the</p>
<p>jiu jitsu language</p>
<p>do you feel like that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>it is like it&rsquo;s almost like you feel like it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>piece of art</p>
<p>so it was something that you create</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t give you credit for creating that and</p>
<p>then people are out there doing it it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stealing your art almost</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do it regardless</p>
<p>but he wants them to</p>
<p>do it yeah it&rsquo;s fun he</p>
<p>wants them to</p>
<p>do it that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing anybody who&rsquo;s doing his shit he supports me</p>
<p>i mean like aoki</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d love that guy out</p>
<p>there doing your shit you&rsquo;re supporting yeah totally</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m human</p>
<p>i want you know if someone</p>
<p>learns some</p>
<p>shit directly from me or my books or anything</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>right thing to do is give credit</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>right thing to do</p>
<p>and not giving credit</p>
<p>is you did you know whoever you</p>
<p>learn a technique from</p>
<p>you gotta give them</p>
<p>you got to if you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re a douchecraft and that</p>
<p>way it doesn&rsquo;t take away from what you did at all</p>
<p>people think that somehow another you</p>
<p>teaching a guy you know a certain way to set up a rear</p>
<p>naked and then he does it</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>give him credit it takes away from him no it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t take away</p>
<p>from him not at all not at all it&rsquo;s just the friendly</p>
<p>thing to do</p>
<p>anytime i get</p>
<p>things to do anytime i pull off a submission</p>
<p>that someone else</p>
<p>in class showed me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll always go up and go dude got it</p>
<p>twice a day you know what i mean yes</p>
<p>do the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i do the same thing yeah</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s important man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>it fosters that friendly attitude too you</p>
<p>know all i&rsquo;m trying to do</p>
<p>i mean i guess it feels good it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>piece of art</p>
<p>and something i always feel good when a new</p>
<p>transition comes up out of nowhere or someone else</p>
<p>one of my students</p>
<p>teaches me or we see it on the</p>
<p>internet i get</p>
<p>excited it&rsquo;s cool it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a little</p>
<p>piece don&rsquo;t do it have no idea how complex it</p>
<p>is they really have no idea how many levels and</p>
<p>layers there are just</p>
<p>like i was talking to nathan</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about how he trained</p>
<p>with marcello</p>
<p>and i went down new york in</p>
<p>training a couple of times</p>
<p>and he was just talking</p>
<p>about how good</p>
<p>marcello moves and how</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really amazing to see someone operate on that</p>
<p>level and we just</p>
<p>started thinking</p>
<p>about it like how humbling that is</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re around a guy like</p>
<p>marcelo or a</p>
<p>jaguaro or something like that</p>
<p>i watched a video of</p>
<p>jaguarin online rolling through people</p>
<p>just rolling through one dude</p>
<p>after another just submitting a left</p>
<p>right left right left right</p>
<p>when you see someone who&rsquo;s at that high level</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s so humbling</p>
<p>because you realize how many goddamn</p>
<p>layers there are to this and</p>
<p>it never ends</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more complex and more</p>
<p>the guys who are competing</p>
<p>against are faster</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re diving on shit with more precision and</p>
<p>their technique is</p>
<p>more crisp and more</p>
<p>sharp and more options</p>
<p>dude there&rsquo;s 12</p>
<p>different ways that i can</p>
<p>count there</p>
<p>maybe more 12 different ways to play off your back</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i can count 12</p>
<p>distinctly different</p>
<p>styles like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference you can tell</p>
<p>to the train guy</p>
<p>someone could tell</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s playing deep</p>
<p>half he&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>x guard he&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>you know lockdown hat</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s playing 50 50</p>
<p>guard he&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>butterfly guard it&rsquo;s you know he&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>rubber guard</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 12 of them that i</p>
<p>could count there</p>
<p>might be more</p>
<p>adelahiba guard spiral guard all that shit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so complex i mean i&rsquo;ve been doing jujutsu</p>
<p>16 years and i suck at most of those guards</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m not that good at</p>
<p>my mandela heba</p>
<p>guard doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a whole different style spiral</p>
<p>guard inverted guard i never do any of that stuff</p>
<p>i never play 50 50 guard</p>
<p>i never do any of that shit</p>
<p>i have like</p>
<p>four or five guards i have like four or five</p>
<p>guards and there&rsquo;s like 12</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of them that i don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much like all these world champions like</p>
<p>rafael mendes and cobrina and all these guys</p>
<p>their style is totally different than mine</p>
<p>totally like if we talked four hours seminars each</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d be two different worlds</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s so much to learn</p>
<p>which path you&rsquo;re gonna take</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been doing like</p>
<p>again 16 years and i&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>putting new</p>
<p>weapons into the game that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i make sure that there&rsquo;s always new projects that i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never always always always</p>
<p>got to be a new project</p>
<p>and those projects</p>
<p>could take one two</p>
<p>three years to get them</p>
<p>where you need them to be you know</p>
<p>the darse is</p>
<p>still my project from like</p>
<p>you know five years ago</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>as good as the top guys are the darse</p>
<p>are pretty good</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not as good as</p>
<p>i still got some more</p>
<p>levels to pop through</p>
<p>but over the last year year and a half</p>
<p>via teens and</p>
<p>north south</p>
<p>i suck with those</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve been on my project list</p>
<p>when i go against the</p>
<p>scrubs when i go</p>
<p>against the</p>
<p>white belts new guys</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not going to do anything that i&rsquo;m good at with them</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna only get shit that i suck at</p>
<p>and try to train my body</p>
<p>i would get into north</p>
<p>south and i go this feels awkward i don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>danny does it</p>
<p>you know but i</p>
<p>would get in there and try to go as far as i can</p>
<p>and i lose it and i go</p>
<p>do something else like cool i&rsquo;ll come back to it</p>
<p>then try it</p>
<p>again i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not tapping i&rsquo;m not really</p>
<p>squeezing right</p>
<p>trying to move my location</p>
<p>focus on it like and</p>
<p>after a while</p>
<p>bam you get into the</p>
<p>oh okay this is feeling good</p>
<p>you know eventually it&rsquo;ll come</p>
<p>and you have to remember that</p>
<p>people forget that</p>
<p>cause a lot of people when they try something new</p>
<p>they go well it feels</p>
<p>kinda awkward fuck that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go back to my shit i don&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got some strange butts big</p>
<p>you gotta remember that all moves feel</p>
<p>awkward in the beginning and if you want this move it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>you can master this move</p>
<p>if you want</p>
<p>it you can be a killer with this move it&rsquo;s up to you</p>
<p>how many reps you&rsquo;re willing to put in</p>
<p>you know and in jiu jitsu</p>
<p>you know the only sport where you can spar</p>
<p>100 percent every day</p>
<p>everyone just sparse</p>
<p>they put in</p>
<p>as few reps as possible</p>
<p>most people have that</p>
<p>mentality back</p>
<p>unless you force them and that&rsquo;s what i do i</p>
<p>force my guys because i know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna get lazy and if i say</p>
<p>okay everyone do</p>
<p>15 of this and</p>
<p>20 of that and make sure you do that and i</p>
<p>write it on a</p>
<p>board and let them do it</p>
<p>and i just kick back and</p>
<p>you know chill</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna do it</p>
<p>you gotta have people need</p>
<p>people that&rsquo;s why they hire trainers</p>
<p>they could do</p>
<p>everything they know all the exercises they know they</p>
<p>could do it</p>
<p>they just need someone to force them</p>
<p>if you have someone to force you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re paying them</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s easier to go through that shit you never do</p>
<p>and then you can roll it</p>
<p>afterwards and actually get to try it you know</p>
<p>when someone</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know for me i just look at</p>
<p>everything most</p>
<p>things is like long term projects like</p>
<p>how many cycles</p>
<p>have you gone through with this technique</p>
<p>and eventually by</p>
<p>third or fourth cycle</p>
<p>once you hit it bad look now he&rsquo;s doing a new role</p>
<p>look at him</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>motivate yourself to push yourself</p>
<p>it is definitely important to have something pushing</p>
<p>rolling is so much more fun</p>
<p>than drills</p>
<p>yeah actually</p>
<p>can you imagine getting on a</p>
<p>video game and</p>
<p>do you ever get on the practice</p>
<p>no you ever like</p>
<p>just practice the little</p>
<p>movements over and over like 50 times like okay this</p>
<p>do people do that</p>
<p>like they get in</p>
<p>a room where they can just practice move</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re getting really good with all the moves</p>
<p>and they do all the techniques</p>
<p>quick players do it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll do that it&rsquo;s like a workout</p>
<p>they can wake up well</p>
<p>quake is based on a map</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s based on map</p>
<p>systems so like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>maps you play on but one of the most important</p>
<p>things about playing quake</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in a one on one duel</p>
<p>is to understand the map</p>
<p>you gotta know</p>
<p>where the guns are hidden you</p>
<p>gotta know where the ammo&rsquo;s hidden and you</p>
<p>gotta control the map</p>
<p>so what you</p>
<p>gotta do is you</p>
<p>gotta make sure you know</p>
<p>every fucking</p>
<p>every minute</p>
<p>area and you can move around so</p>
<p>they practice like special jumps</p>
<p>and rocket jumps they</p>
<p>practice jumping into certain areas and like</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t get to</p>
<p>really far and then crumble</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;ll practice that shit they practice it so they</p>
<p>have complete command of the</p>
<p>map so they can move around the map anywhere they want</p>
<p>and then they practice timing</p>
<p>when the how is</p>
<p>quake bound</p>
<p>is there a new version</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re playing that</p>
<p>for 10 years</p>
<p>yeah the latest</p>
<p>best version though is quake</p>
<p>iii to me quake</p>
<p>iv is pretty badass</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the latest</p>
<p>i think quake</p>
<p>iv is the last</p>
<p>it takes years to make them</p>
<p>you know everyone they did</p>
<p>they came up with a new doom what</p>
<p>every year when</p>
<p>they get better and better i don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about video games does does</p>
<p>like the graphics</p>
<p>and the graphics and the amount of area you can</p>
<p>travel to always bigger that&rsquo;s a they</p>
<p>get bigger and bigger</p>
<p>to have some games they call</p>
<p>a massive was it</p>
<p>mmorgs or something like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s role player games massive</p>
<p>world it&rsquo;s like an artificial</p>
<p>world role player game</p>
<p>where you can just</p>
<p>travel for miles and meet new people and</p>
<p>people live</p>
<p>their whole lives inside</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually real people</p>
<p>the people that you meet in there they&rsquo;re real people</p>
<p>playing the game real people playing the game yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re great</p>
<p>people have lost</p>
<p>their mind when it comes to</p>
<p>these things i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never heard of that</p>
<p>what does this game call</p>
<p>they starve</p>

<p>sketch but it almost seemed like he had</p>
<p>introduced a few</p>
<p>other sketches already</p>
<p>maybe the audience</p>
<p>knows the answer to this</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good question</p>

<p>and tried to get her to fuck her</p>
<p>and the man</p>
<p>like she got life</p>
<p>in prison that is the mandatory</p>
<p>sentence for that</p>
<p>life in prison is a man&rsquo;s voice</p>
<p>the kids 14 years old and she&rsquo;s like 34 or some shit</p>
<p>and she grabbed the kid&rsquo;s hand and put it on her tick</p>
<p>and she said she was drunk</p>
<p>and she doesn&rsquo;t remember any of it</p>
<p>and this bitch is</p>
<p>going to lie</p>
<p>in their way</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>so what she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>it she did it all she did was put it together she did</p>
<p>you know obviously the bitch is</p>
<p>crazy and she needs to do like a</p>
<p>night in jail or</p>
<p>maybe a week at the most</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>sometimes you</p>
<p>could think</p>
<p>about what it</p>
<p>would be like to</p>
<p>spend one month in prison</p>
<p>that would fucking destroy a lot of your life</p>
<p>and people were like oh</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s got at</p>
<p>least 10 years like</p>
<p>think about what a</p>
<p>month yeah in prison</p>
<p>would be like</p>

<p>terrible terrible</p>
<p>and for just getting a boy to</p>
<p>touch a kid</p>
<p>i mean yeah you</p>
<p>should have done it</p>
<p>but come on you&rsquo;re supposed to like slap on the wrists</p>

<p>this before</p>
<p>you guys you</p>
<p>fucking support that</p>
<p>how dare you</p>
<p>i know but it seems an unbelievable</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s hard to believe that people are that</p>
<p>stupid to give</p>
<p>someone life</p>
<p>for that yeah</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>story when your</p>
<p>favorite in</p>
<p>class got thrown out and like what you do like no</p>
<p>thanks move my chair</p>
<p>two times phrases</p>
<p>like no you didn&rsquo;t you were moving it over and over and</p>
<p>told you to</p>
<p>stop that&rsquo;s all well and good but that was the charges</p>
<p>what the charges were</p>
<p>most of it is</p>
<p>lootness minor</p>

<p>eight probably wasn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>first time crazy the</p>
<p>speed breaking</p>
<p>sucks dick on the little kids that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>well if she did it to this kid she&rsquo;s probably doing the</p>
<p>other one it&rsquo;s not like she&rsquo;s been fucking grown man</p>
<p>just said no just take</p>
<p>yeah big time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like yeah like all of a</p>
<p>sudden out of nowhere</p>
<p>she says let me just dive in this fourteen year old</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;s done before</p>
<p>just not particular</p>
<p>about who she blows</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s all that is she&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>crazy bitch</p>
<p>but you shouldn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>go to jail for the rest of your fucking life that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re trying to put kids in jail for sexting</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to make sexting illegal</p>
<p>for kids girls are shutting</p>
<p>to child porn</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>child porn good for teens</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>child pornographer</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that nuts</p>
<p>of course right</p>
<p>dude what are they kids doing it to each other yes</p>
<p>child porn setting to their boyfriends</p>
<p>wanna hear a crisis</p>
<p>tour a bunch of boys</p>
<p>got suspended i</p>
<p>think it was like nine girls got suspended</p>
<p>from this one</p>
<p>school because they had a</p>
<p>bunch of pictures that they took</p>
<p>and put on their myspace page</p>
<p>in between school when they&rsquo;re not at</p>
<p>school like during</p>
<p>their summer break</p>
<p>so when they came back to school they were suspended</p>
<p>because of sexy pictures of</p>
<p>their myspace page they&rsquo;re like sucking figures</p>
<p>sticking their ass out and doing</p>
<p>stuff and they&rsquo;re only like 14</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re just doing normal horror shit</p>
<p>and they got</p>
<p>suspended so the girls are suing the school</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna win</p>
<p>i mean if it can go on myspace you can&rsquo;t tell someone</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t do something</p>
<p>during their off time because you don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>just because you&rsquo;re teaching them you know when did</p>
<p>these fucking retards be</p>
<p>watching our students at school</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that people accessing it at school</p>
<p>well you could access to that</p>
<p>school if you had access to myspace at school</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what kind of internet access they have at</p>
<p>school yeah but either way</p>
<p>the kids should be able to put up you</p>
<p>know she wants to be a whore she wants to be a whore</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t legislate against that and</p>
<p>you certainly can&rsquo;t punish them for shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s illegal to do</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re acting like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>their fucking mom</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re saying you don&rsquo;t want them in</p>
<p>school for the</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna give</p>
<p>other people a bad impression</p>
<p>of your school is that what it is</p>
<p>cause she&rsquo;s in her underwear online</p>
<p>shut the fuck up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of these dummies</p>
<p>that are teaching</p>
<p>our kids today and that&rsquo;s the problem there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of them who are fucking dummies</p>
<p>when did they become the parents when did they become</p>
<p>the moral arbitrators</p>
<p>when did they become the people who dictate</p>
<p>how people were supposed to behave</p>
<p>you know if you don&rsquo;t have a problem with your kid</p>
<p>sticking her ass</p>
<p>up in the air in myspace</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>teacher you should be like whatever i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>teach you some science and you get through life and</p>
<p>enjoy yourself</p>
<p>but what the</p>
<p>teachers supposed to step in and say</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t be in your underwear when you&rsquo;re mad at</p>
<p>school fuck you</p>
<p>who are you</p>
<p>you just teach just teach me</p>

<p>jack narrator</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t he die a year ago no he had a massive</p>
<p>heart attack you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>based on they just thought</p>
<p>really i thought</p>
<p>he was dead the whole time</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know he was a person they thought he was done</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of people sent like i</p>
<p>think even doug benson</p>
<p>set out an rip</p>
<p>a lot of people were saying he was dead</p>
<p>and so there was a</p>
<p>rumor going around</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t his</p>
<p>dad but he was</p>
<p>basically like</p>
<p>barry newell</p>
<p>he was basically the</p>
<p>not actually</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t know the scientific</p>
<p>medical details</p>
<p>but i know that he was in really really bad</p>
<p>shape from the time of that</p>
<p>till now so who was it</p>
<p>so it wasn&rsquo;t that he was just really</p>
<p>powerful marijuana</p>
<p>activist that</p>
<p>started out his life as like this gold</p>
<p>water republican type guy who was like really anti weed</p>
<p>and then he got divorced</p>
<p>smoking pot with this woman</p>
<p>that he had just met this new woman he</p>
<p>took a chance and he was a single guy</p>
<p>hanging out with some chicken</p>
<p>and really kind of was</p>
<p>blown away by it and then</p>
<p>fell in love with the</p>
<p>effects of marijuana</p>
<p>and then started looking into the history</p>
<p>and then he put out this</p>
<p>really fucking amazing book</p>
<p>called the emperor wears no clothes</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about this marijuana</p>
<p>he wrote it in jail</p>
<p>putting him in jail</p>
<p>the reason he went to jail is because</p>
<p>he before he</p>
<p>wrote the book he was already a</p>
<p>like a marijuana</p>
<p>activist for certain</p>
<p>things there&rsquo;s so many ways you can</p>
<p>fight for marijuana but</p>
<p>i forget exactly what he was</p>
<p>fighting for in the very beginning</p>
<p>he was protesting in</p>
<p>front of a federal building</p>
<p>reagan showed up reagan</p>
<p>told the people the federal building</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t handled</p>
<p>yeah the cops come arrest everybody</p>
<p>all they had to do is pay like some</p>
<p>twenty dollar</p>
<p>ticket or something</p>
<p>he refused to pay it</p>
<p>and he went to jail for</p>
<p>a year and two</p>
<p>yeah he went to jail</p>
<p>he was hardcore</p>
<p>he wrote that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>it was good for him</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where he had the time to</p>
<p>write that for</p>
<p>his own clothes he</p>
<p>voted in jail</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good book too it&rsquo;s really very detailed</p>
<p>if you want to know anything</p>
<p>about the history of propaganda and of</p>
<p>hemp being made illegal</p>
<p>everybody thinks the</p>
<p>reason why marijuana is illegal is because it&rsquo;s bad for</p>
<p>you i mean if you ask like 100 people 75 of them are</p>
<p>going to tell you it&rsquo;s bad for you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something it does</p>
<p>brain damage</p>
<p>causes some problems</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not why it&rsquo;s illegal it&rsquo;s illegal because</p>
<p>when they figured out a way to process hemp</p>
<p>fibers more effectively they came up with this</p>
<p>thing called</p>
<p>decorticator</p>
<p>it was a machine</p>
<p>that grinds up the hemp and makes the</p>
<p>fibers easier to process</p>
<p>william randolph</p>
<p>hearst owned</p>
<p>paper companies</p>
<p>and he also owned newspapers and these</p>
<p>paper companies they make</p>
<p>paper out of fucking wood and this hemp</p>
<p>paper was much better it was far superior</p>
<p>and it was a competing product</p>
<p>so he wanted</p>
<p>to make it illegal so what he decided to do was</p>
<p>print newspaper articles</p>
<p>where they said that</p>
<p>blacks and mexicans were raping</p>
<p>white women i knew it</p>
<p>what is this</p>
<p>and the reason why</p>
<p>they said the reason why they were raping</p>
<p>white women is because</p>
<p>they were smoking this due drug called marijuana</p>
<p>so when congress made marijuana illegal</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re making the textile</p>
<p>you know the fabric the you know all the</p>
<p>things that hemp can make</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t really even</p>
<p>know they were making that illegal too they had no idea</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>completely ridiculous</p>
<p>the fact that it&rsquo;s stuck</p>
<p>from the 1930s all the way you can hear</p>
<p>2010 even though we know it&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>i mean you can go</p>
<p>right now we can go down the corner</p>
<p>store and buy</p>
<p>jack daniels and</p>
<p>drink ourselves to death easy</p>
<p>if we walked in with there right now</p>
<p>we each bought</p>
<p>a big ass bottle like a gallon jug of jack daniels all</p>
<p>three of us in line</p>
<p>no one would bat an eye</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lethal doses</p>
<p>we just bought lethal doses of alcohol</p>
<p>and we could just come here and the</p>
<p>three of us would</p>
<p>drink those</p>
<p>drink that jacked candles</p>
<p>until our body</p>
<p>literally shut the fuck down</p>
<p>that sounds cool</p>
<p>how crazy is it</p>
<p>that people would even bat an eye that marijuana</p>
<p>should or shouldn&rsquo;t be illegal</p>
<p>of course it</p>
<p>should be legal</p>
<p>if you can go and buy jack daniels that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>ridiculous yeah i&rsquo;m fucking hungry yeah</p>
<p>you want to end this thing sounds it</p>
<p>5 18 i think we did enough talk about silver</p>
<p>i think we&rsquo;ve already talked</p>
<p>about silver enough you know</p>
<p>i think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bored enough anderson</p>
<p>silva saying he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take all the ufc belts</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>maybe anderson silva is</p>
<p>bored at 185</p>
<p>pounds maybe that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the reason why his last performance wasn&rsquo;t up to par</p>
<p>you know who the fuck knows man you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re inside that dude&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s obviously brilliant</p>
<p>you know and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fighting and he&rsquo;s probably a very complicated dude</p>
<p>you know but i think</p>
<p>i would like to see him challenged</p>
<p>now chao sun in</p>
<p>fights gonna be very interesting</p>
<p>chao sun is gonna</p>
<p>talk a lot of shit</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s gonna attack him</p>
<p>yeah yeah but august</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s gonna be in salt lake city</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>well chelse signs a real good wrestling</p>
<p>man he beat the fucking</p>
<p>well he beat yushino comedy which was really impressive</p>
<p>cause yushen at the time thought to be like this real</p>
<p>powerful grappler</p>
<p>chelsea and just manhandled them without grapple</p>
<p>the shit out of them kicked his ass</p>
<p>then he beat</p>
<p>nate markport</p>
<p>and i was like oh</p>
<p>that really opened a lot of people&rsquo;s eyes</p>
<p>and so now he gets this point he</p>
<p>took for a wrestling</p>
<p>really explosive with double leg</p>
<p>take downs and you don&rsquo;t see that often you</p>
<p>see a lot of greco guys</p>
<p>flying for your leg he does he&rsquo;s like gsp</p>
<p>with wrestling at 85 that was</p>
<p>a win streak or anything</p>
<p>so he fought</p>
<p>damien maya before that and he got triangles he got</p>
<p>taken down i</p>
<p>think he hit him with a lateral</p>
<p>drop or some sort of a</p>
<p>throw it was really</p>
<p>impressive and damien</p>
<p>mounted them</p>
<p>and then slide the triangle in from</p>
<p>the mountain and pulled them on top of them and tapped</p>
<p>into triangles oh yeah that&rsquo;s two wins that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>sweet yeah those</p>
<p>are two wins that</p>
<p>set but you</p>
<p>know the damien maya thing</p>
<p>look you know</p>
<p>if that guy catches you he catches you</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really good at that</p>
<p>chill something&rsquo;s been caught with</p>
<p>stuff in the past</p>
<p>that would be an interesting</p>
<p>thing if anderson</p>
<p>could submit</p>
<p>him off of his back</p>
<p>that would be fantastic</p>
<p>because you know</p>
<p>chelsun and</p>
<p>at some point</p>
<p>in time if anderson</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t knock him out immediately</p>
<p>chelsun is gonna have anderson on his back</p>
<p>you know unless he catches</p>
<p>them and claws coming in</p>
<p>which is always possible with anderson</p>
<p>so great a sprawling</p>
<p>i have a feeling that</p>
<p>this time this</p>
<p>time chale is gonna take</p>
<p>submission defense in the</p>
<p>guard and pass in the garden</p>
<p>really more seriously i have a feeling you gonna try</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s gonna come out</p>
<p>cause he gets caught in the guard</p>
<p>cause he likes to</p>
<p>pound in the garden when you</p>
<p>pound in the</p>
<p>guard you can get caught</p>
<p>you know look at the</p>
<p>car in there obedience</p>
<p>he got caught</p>
<p>you know and he&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s awesome with</p>
<p>jiu jitsu but</p>
<p>once chale finally realizes that he needs to get</p>
<p>really good at passing and mountain and taking the back</p>
<p>fuck yeah once he realizes</p>
<p>he needs to adapt</p>
<p>the gsp strategy</p>
<p>once he looks at gsp in a few</p>
<p>fights and says holy shit</p>
<p>i should be doing what gsp is doing</p>
<p>once he makes that decision</p>
<p>chell be unstoppable</p>
<p>that dude&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got serious cardio too</p>
<p>the reason why he does</p>
<p>great but then you</p>
<p>know he loses he does</p>
<p>great then he loses</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because he</p>
<p>he is not taking</p>
<p>guard passing and being safe in the</p>
<p>guard and taking</p>
<p>guard passing</p>
<p>as the number one</p>
<p>priority over ground and pound</p>
<p>in the full</p>
<p>guard you only</p>
<p>should really</p>
<p>pound in the full guard</p>
<p>to open shit up like passing</p>
<p>should be your number one</p>
<p>focus look at gsp</p>
<p>passing is its number one focus</p>
<p>that is the correct attitude well that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>what did you think</p>
<p>about what greg jackson said</p>
<p>about gsp well</p>
<p>greg jackson said in the</p>
<p>fight that he didn&rsquo;t want a gsp to pass his</p>
<p>guarding only took dan hardy down</p>
<p>he said just don&rsquo;t pass his garbage</p>
<p>route he was</p>
<p>being i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t agree with</p>
<p>it ever saying he couldn&rsquo;t pass his guard</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t passing it he was like i</p>
<p>guess we thought he was wasting energy</p>
<p>i just wanted to</p>
<p>go like that beat him up from inside the guard</p>
<p>you know the thing</p>
<p>you guys always say the</p>
<p>tour is good from the half guard</p>
<p>but you can get thrust when</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t agree with that strategy</p>
<p>at all ever i would never agree with them but</p>
<p>i can understand it in a way where</p>
<p>i could see that</p>
<p>after gsp passed this guard and mounted them</p>
<p>dan hardy would give this back</p>
<p>then he would post up and then eventually would</p>
<p>shake him up and they would</p>
<p>stand up again that every time so</p>
<p>greg jackson was looking at it was like</p>
<p>if he passes the guards and a mountain</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna eventually stand up</p>
<p>after he gets his back</p>
<p>up and he gets up</p>
<p>so i think just do it</p>
<p>great jackson just like stay in his guard</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t get up from there</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t get up from the</p>
<p>guard he can&rsquo;t get up once he gets his back</p>
<p>you know so just stay in the guard let&rsquo;s get the w</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take a fucking chance with this guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>super conservative strategy</p>
<p>which i understand but</p>
<p>i think gsb was doing fine and i</p>
<p>think he should always go for</p>
<p>the finish he should always go for the past</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>he almost had him</p>
<p>twice he almost had a good</p>
<p>one yeah yeah</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want your you don&rsquo;t want your</p>
<p>partner to get the</p>
<p>orders done you know</p>
<p>john&rsquo;s donker</p>
<p>they were working on it</p>
<p>afterwards they</p>
<p>were working on tightening what he was doing</p>
<p>wrong the setting of his</p>
<p>kimora telling him to hit it at a different angle</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>remember how he did it did he have to leg over the face</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty damn good i don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>he did that was he in psychiatry</p>
<p>or did he have to leg over the face i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>with side control but</p>
<p>the camorra looks strong the armbar looks</p>
<p>strong for a couple seconds man armbar was bent</p>
<p>back way back for a couple seconds</p>
<p>dan hardy just</p>
<p>gritted it out rolled his face into the mat turned</p>
<p>and dan only had two scratches on us under his</p>
<p>right eye and he wasn&rsquo;t hurt his arms were fine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing that he went five</p>
<p>rounds of gsp and he barely had a couple nicks on it</p>
<p>you know harvey&rsquo;s a tough dude</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>smart guy too</p>
<p>so good at shit talking</p>
<p>so good at those interviews man</p>
<p>i got you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s such a tricky</p>
<p>thing because in one way that&rsquo;s like kind of like anti</p>
<p>like what the martial arts is supposed to</p>
<p>stand for talking shit you know but</p>
<p>when dudes do</p>
<p>talk shit they make it so much more interesting</p>
<p>yeah i think they</p>
<p>talk shit back in ancient times like samurais against</p>
<p>the kung fu</p>
<p>dudes and all that shit i</p>
<p>think they talk shit</p>
<p>i can see them talking shit it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tactic you fucks with people&rsquo;s heads</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna make you suck my dick</p>
<p>yeah man what it is a tactic you know</p>
<p>fucking with dudes heads it is like a</p>
<p>legitimate technique the problem is that everyone</p>
<p>thinks they&rsquo;re doing so well</p>
<p>and it like rarely actually kills people off</p>
<p>their games yeah</p>
<p>just seems like</p>
<p>that was woody</p>
<p>sometimes it makes it douchey</p>
<p>two guys are just talking shit to each other</p>
<p>you know sometimes the</p>
<p>you know but when guys are good at it</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t like personal</p>
<p>energy going</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna be honest with you</p>
<p>i really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i win</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m gonna go out and give my all</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i could do what else do you want me to do</p>
<p>would it be awesome if someone went on the internet</p>
<p>and said here&rsquo;s the deal man</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really have a lot of job options i need some</p>
<p>money and it&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>money but fuck it i need to fight</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>seeing that</p>
<p>starting it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>a song on tv a couple times and i thought you know what</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not gonna make some cash with that</p>
<p>my favorite was anderson and one of the times when</p>
<p>they go back and forth they tell you what that guy said</p>
<p>and you say something and they go back and forth</p>
<p>and they said well he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best at fucking</p>
<p>drama school</p>
<p>right but so</p>
<p>they said you know anderson like i said he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna you know get you down</p>
<p>mount you and</p>
<p>pound you into</p>
<p>submission this is</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great tactic</p>
<p>yes i would go</p>
<p>in if that happens right</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>smart way that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>smart way of telling it</p>
<p>yeah anderson is pretty good when it comes to</p>
<p>TikTok and how casual and</p>
<p>calm he gets but</p>
<p>apparently he gets very angry</p>
<p>i mean when you saw that</p>
<p>chelsun fight man</p>
<p>or the rather</p>
<p>damian maya</p>
<p>fight he gets real angry</p>
<p>you know damien maya</p>
<p>whatever the fuck damien maya said</p>
<p>really made him bananas in that</p>
<p>second round</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck was said or</p>
<p>what but have you ever seen him like that before ever</p>
<p>screaming screaming shit talking like that</p>
<p>what if damian</p>
<p>what would happen if</p>
<p>danny and mae were in a buck&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>anderson&rsquo;s silvers</p>
<p>and what if</p>
<p>danny and mae</p>
<p>started doing some fucking</p>
<p>windmill break</p>
<p>this is tough</p>
<p>coming after him</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>and then would stop what if he just</p>
<p>started dancing</p>
<p>it would be crazy if i</p>
<p>right in the middle he just started</p>
<p>break dancing</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>thing where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dress it they spin</p>
<p>that would be awesome</p>
<p>girls had to do that</p>
<p>your same here for breakdance</p>
<p>yeah remember you</p>
<p>should do that a little bit and sometimes</p>
<p>earlier fights what</p>
<p>you got really good and you attack someone like that</p>
<p>like you just fucking spun out of myself</p>
<p>like a big propeller</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of energy can you imagine that&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>break that would be badass man i bet the</p>
<p>break dancers would</p>
<p>start making some</p>
<p>noise it was the</p>
<p>sickest fucking baseball</p>
<p>era like this and</p>
<p>fucking switch positions</p>
<p>and make him</p>
<p>break dance</p>
<p>a break dance</p>
<p>card yeah that&rsquo;s pretty good</p>
<p>what if capo era</p>
<p>got together with</p>
<p>breakdancing and created a new martial art</p>
<p>this is a list</p>
<p>of something</p>
<p>great right</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>so not me of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>just you gonna get fucking boss you can do some kind of</p>
<p>shit and go right to the head spin</p>
<p>when you spin on your head</p>
<p>right yeah and then slide your legs out yeah yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be a great way to pass the guard</p>
<p>i think we&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s probably a good are you guys bored yet yes</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about talk about aoki yeah let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about that real quick while because you&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>what did you think about the</p>
<p>shiny aoki gilbert melinda</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t let him but scoot very interesting fight</p>
<p>uh you know</p>
<p>gilbert melendez is awesome in the guard</p>
<p>and he did a great job of staying away from any danger</p>
<p>i think maybe once or twice</p>
<p>aoki had an amish control and</p>
<p>smashed it against the cage</p>
<p>that was aoki senez is a bad motherfucker</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s very good</p>
<p>gilbert has awesome timing his</p>
<p>stand up was wicked</p>
<p>stayed on top of them</p>
<p>you know i mean the only way that strategy was</p>
<p>gonna work for him you know stay</p>
<p>avoiding the guard was if he</p>
<p>could beat him in the stand up exchanges</p>
<p>you know and he definitely did</p>
<p>he beat him in all the stand up exchanges he was not</p>
<p>hard he looked involved he</p>
<p>beat his ass you know</p>
<p>that really could</p>
<p>him now i hope he had the wrists</p>
<p>once in persona that was good yeah</p>
<p>he got the arm trapped a couple times but</p>
<p>just pulled right the fuck out of it</p>
<p>and it was never in any danger at all</p>
<p>so that was a big fight for him</p>
<p>yogi&rsquo;s just not as good with the fucking with regular</p>
<p>shorts so is jay shields contract demonstrated for us</p>
<p>supposedly yeah which is amazing</p>
<p>if they really let him fight without</p>
<p>a contract saying that if he wins that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still in contract</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how that stuff works</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know you could do that i guess you can</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not willing to sign a new contract i</p>
<p>guess you just have to do it</p>
<p>do whatever you want yeah and so</p>
<p>i think he felt like</p>
<p>i think jake</p>
<p>shields was upset because he felt like they were</p>
<p>not respecting him</p>
<p>yeah they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>promote him enough they mostly most of the promotion</p>
<p>that they had was mentioning dan henderson and not him</p>
<p>because he was on his last fight</p>
<p>yeah and they wanted it to be a big deal i mean dan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a legend two time</p>
<p>pride champion</p>
<p>in two different way</p>
<p>classes so that was a</p>
<p>big deal for them a big acquisition they thought he was</p>
<p>gonna be the big star</p>
<p>so they were hoping that jake shields</p>
<p>would lose i</p>
<p>guess yeah give him the belt</p>
<p>right away yeah</p>
<p>the other guy off was like an orange i mean his</p>
<p>first fight in the organizations a title fight on cbs</p>
<p>and crazy ass fucking fight to</p>
<p>whoever thought that jake she was be able to take</p>
<p>down him some down that many times just order</p>
<p>pizza and watch it</p>
<p>i gotta go all right</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s it ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>this was the first annual 420 podcast</p>
<p>i think we got some good shit we talked about in there</p>

<p>train of conversation too much you got the</p>
<p>potato chips</p>
