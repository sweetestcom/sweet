    <p>Hi friends, so this is the last fucking episode</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d ever be making because I have the words trust no one tattooed on my hand</p>
<p>And here I am giving you a full fucking podcast of how to know you could trust someone</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>So as much as I want to say trust no one and I stand by that&rsquo;s all the day that I die</p>
<p>You can trust people to a certain extent. I</p>
<p>Personally I have like that little boundary of like I&rsquo;m never surprised by nothing</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fully trust any human being</p>
<p>But there are signs that someone is trustworthy and that you can trust them and that&rsquo;s what this podcast is gonna be</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you all the shit that I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>From all the shit that I&rsquo;ve been through and all the awareness that I have</p>
<p>These are the little things that you can pick up on there&rsquo;s gonna be little things</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be big things, but I&rsquo;m gonna teach you how to spot all of it</p>
<p>And after you hear this episode all the things I&rsquo;m gonna tell you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get a newfound sense of trust with yourself</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re gonna feel like you can trust your own judgment of people now</p>
<p>Cuz I got your back and I&rsquo;m in your ear cuz you&rsquo;re never gonna forget this shit</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna hear in this episode like I&rsquo;m about to completely fuck up the way you look at people and I&rsquo;m so sorry</p>
<p>But like I&rsquo;m gonna show you ways to protect yourself. Like these are the identifiers that someone is not safe</p>
<p>And if after you listen to this you realize that</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually trust anyone in your life and no one in your life is trustworthy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, like listen at your own risk bitch cuz like this one&rsquo;s gonna hit you</p>
<p>so one of my favorite type of people and</p>
<p>The first sign that you know</p>
<p>You can trust somebody is the type person that will tell you you have shit on your face</p>
<p>Or you have something in your fucking teeth like the person that looks out for you</p>
<p>Regardless if it hurts your feelings or not</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let me walk around looking fucking stupid if I have some in my teeth goddamn</p>
<p>Tell me like there&rsquo;s just a certain level of comfort and just like assurance and safety</p>
<p>You feel with somebody when they&rsquo;re honest like that like you&rsquo;re looking out for me. You&rsquo;re not worried about</p>
<p>Oh, is this gonna hurt my feelings? It&rsquo;s like no your main concern is making sure that I&rsquo;m okay and like you&rsquo;re protecting me</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two ways people can point shit out they can make fun of you for it or</p>
<p>They can let you know</p>
<p>That something&rsquo;s off or something&rsquo;s wrong or they could try and fix it or whatever it is</p>
<p>They can show it as concern of like you I&rsquo;m looking out for you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m protecting you or if they pointed out and make fun of you fuck them</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the type you can trust if they try and embarrass you for it</p>
<p>Anyone that tries to embarrass you period fuck them don&rsquo;t trust them</p>
<p>But if someone tries to point something out about you to embarrass you no, that&rsquo;s absolutely not don&rsquo;t fucking trust them</p>
<p>keep your fucking distance, but someone that&rsquo;s gonna look out for you and be like</p>
<p>Hey, like they get they point to their teeth or they point to something on their face to like wipe your fucking face</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a down-ass motherfucker. That&rsquo;s someone you can trust. That&rsquo;s someone you can be comfortable with</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s my favorite type of person and that&rsquo;s how I am</p>
<p>Like I always feel bad to like have to point something out</p>
<p>But I know how good I feel when someone points it out for me</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not gonna let me walk around looking stupid. You&rsquo;re not gonna let me walk around my hair fucked up</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m bald right now, but when I had hair</p>
<p>like if when people would like fix my hair for me or like my friends like when I wear a gold chain like if it</p>
<p>Flips when we&rsquo;re at the club because I&rsquo;d be dancing like a motherfuck</p>
<p>When it flips like they&rsquo;ll like readjust it for me and make sure it looks flat like thank you for looking out for me, bitch</p>
<p>Like thank you. Like that is number one sign. You can trust somebody</p>
<p>Do they tell me I have shit in my teeth or I have something on my fucking face?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a little bit more to that because you know</p>
<p>You can trust their compliments when they compliment you if they&rsquo;ll also tell you when something looks bad</p>
<p>So you need someone that can do both?</p>
<p>Okay, that was the only like superficial one honestly like the rest of them are kind of like big and serious so</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to the next one, which is safety</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little signs you can tell someone cares about your safety like the whole text me when you get home thing</p>
<p>The checking in on you making sure you&rsquo;re all right making sure you got a ride making sure you&rsquo;re watched out for</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little things like that that will show someone cares for your safety, but that is the main fucking thing</p>
<p>That you should be worried about is your physical safety and well-being does someone care about that?</p>
<p>Are they gonna make sure you&rsquo;re okay? Do they show some kind of concern or consideration for your safety?</p>
<p>There is so many little things that I do</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m watching out for people like in a restaurant. I always sit facing the door, so I always know what&rsquo;s coming in</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going out? You know what I mean like I need to know everything going on</p>
<p>So I always face the door when I&rsquo;m with someone in a parking lot</p>
<p>I make sure they get in their car, and if you&rsquo;re getting in the car with me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fully in the car with my door closed until you&rsquo;re in the car with your door closed like I&rsquo;m making sure if</p>
<p>Someone grabs you I can easily get to you</p>
<p>Does that make sense like I&rsquo;m never just like locking myself in the car also</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not letting my friends that are girls walk by their self to their fucking car at night</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m dropping off a friend at home</p>
<p>I make sure that they get in their door and they close it when I&rsquo;m dropping a friend off at their car</p>
<p>I make sure they get in and it starts and they&rsquo;re able to drive because I&rsquo;m not just gonna leave you stranded in a fucking</p>
<p>Parking lot and your car don&rsquo;t start like there&rsquo;s just little tiny signs</p>
<p>That you know someone is looking out for your safety, and those are just a few</p>
<p>But that is a really really good sign that it should be your fucking priority like there are some people that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Confrontational and I understand that there are certain people that are not violent</p>
<p>but I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t care who it is when you care about someone you will protect them at all fucking costs</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be an extreme and just because someone is not aggressive and feisty and in your fucking face</p>
<p>They might be doing other things that indicate that they&rsquo;re concerned about your safety</p>
<p>So look out for them like the things that I said just see if they start doing any of that</p>
<p>These are like little telltale signs that you know that they care about your safety</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a huge thing that you know you can trust them</p>
<p>okay, so my next sign you know you can trust someone is</p>
<p>Check them and watch what happens when they get mad when someone gets mad</p>
<p>Do their actions and their words?</p>
<p>Still line up or is what they&rsquo;ve said they are and what they like and what they do and what they value does that flip?</p>
<p>All of a sudden just because they&rsquo;re pissed off. Do they stop respecting you when they get pissed off</p>
<p>Do they stop considering your safety when they get pissed off. It&rsquo;s like certain couples</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like whenever they get in a fight</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m throwing all your shit out of the house fuck you get out of my house get out of my life</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how are you just gonna show such a blatant disregard for someone&rsquo;s well-being and their safety and their home?</p>
<p>You know what I mean. That&rsquo;s just something that does not sit right with me like when you get mad</p>
<p>Are you gonna start attacking me verbally?</p>
<p>Are you gonna use shit that I told you in confidence like things that I was vulnerable about are you now gonna attack me?</p>
<p>With them like you got to watch when people get mad</p>
<p>Watch if there&rsquo;s a flip or watch if they&rsquo;re still consistent if someone is consistent even when they&rsquo;re pissed off</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sign you can trust them so with me I&rsquo;m able to be extremely angry</p>
<p>I can be like foaming at the fucking mouth, and I still am aware of what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>I will be screaming at the top of my lungs, but I&rsquo;m in control of the words coming out of my mouth</p>
<p>Some people aren&rsquo;t so just because someone gets mad and they start screaming. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re being inconsistent. They might be scaring you by getting aggressive, but</p>
<p>Check what they&rsquo;re saying does what they say line up with what they say when they&rsquo;re not mad</p>
<p>Do their feelings for you change all of a sudden because they&rsquo;re mad do now they fucking hate you now</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re disgusted by you. You know what I mean</p>
<p>You got to watch for the consistency</p>
<p>See if when they get angry or when they get emotional they use it as a chance to discard you</p>
<p>discard the way that you feel and all of that because if someone gets mad and they use that as an excuse to like</p>
<p>No longer take you into consideration. It&rsquo;s just about them because they&rsquo;re pissy</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s not a safe person to be with so</p>
<p>You cannot fucking trust them. I&rsquo;m sorry like you&rsquo;ll be at the mercy of whatever emotional state that they are in</p>
<p>So every time they get upset your sense of safety is gone, and I want you to watch out for that</p>
<p>I want you to protect yourself from that and it will start with little things</p>
<p>One more little thing around this is like do they leave you places?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re out together, and you go out and they get pissed off</p>
<p>Are they just gonna leave you are they just gonna leave you in a parking lot?</p>
<p>Are they just gonna leave you at a club like if you drove together?</p>
<p>Are they just gonna take the car and fucking leave you there?</p>
<p>Do not trust the motherfucker that does that you will only allow someone to do that to you once if you listen to my podcast</p>
<p>Bitch, we don&rsquo;t let that shit happen wonder why I always drive separate</p>
<p>You will never catch me nowhere without my own fucking car because I&rsquo;m not taking no chance with that</p>
<p>But if someone does do that like if you go on a trip somewhere</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just gonna leave you somewhere, and they don&rsquo;t care about making sure that you get home safe</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big sign that you can&rsquo;t trust them</p>
<p>Cuz even if I&rsquo;m like pissed off at you like I want to punch you in your fucking throat</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still gonna make sure you get home. Okay. You know like if we went together. I&rsquo;m gonna make sure you get home</p>
<p>Your safety will never be at risk</p>
<p>even if I&rsquo;m mad at you, so that&rsquo;s one way that you can know you can trust someone and</p>
<p>Another way you can test like if you&rsquo;ve just met someone and you want to know how they react when they&rsquo;re angry like maybe they</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t gotten angry with you yet. Look at how they treat other people. They&rsquo;re angry with</p>
<p>Watch that interaction listen to how they talk about people from their past that have done them wrong</p>
<p>Are they vengeful are they fucking hateful are they spiteful because they&rsquo;ll do the exact same shit to you and trust me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned from fucking experience with that like I&rsquo;m like oh, it will never be me. It will never be me</p>
<p>Yes, the motherfuck it will people</p>
<p>Do not deserve for you to be hopeful about them. You&rsquo;re gonna look at their fucking actions</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna look at their fucking patterns. You don&rsquo;t give people hope you give them what they show you</p>
<p>so if they show you that they&rsquo;re unsafe and they have patterns of</p>
<p>Disregarding people when they get mad or when they get upset or when they&rsquo;re mad at somebody like they start fucking with them and they get</p>
<p>Despiteful you don&rsquo;t give them the hope and the benefit of the doubt that they&rsquo;ll treat you different</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna treat you how they&rsquo;re showing you so I want you to remind yourself of that. You&rsquo;re not special. You&rsquo;re not different</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about you</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about them and them not being able to control their emotions and their reactions when they&rsquo;re emotional</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about you, babe. I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re the fucking best thing they ever met</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll fuck it up if they don&rsquo;t know how to get a grip on their emotions and when they&rsquo;re upset</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say that but I got to tell you the way it is because I&rsquo;ve been burnt so many times</p>
<p>from giving people the benefit of the doubt and just hoping that they cared about me, but</p>
<p>someone can care about you and still hurt you so a</p>
<p>Big thing you can use from this podcast is I&rsquo;m the know I&rsquo;m saying signs</p>
<p>You can trust someone but look for signs that you&rsquo;re safe with someone. That&rsquo;s a good thing too because most of these are that</p>
<p>Okay, so the next way, you know</p>
<p>You can trust someone if they don&rsquo;t let things prevent them from helping you</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not gonna let something get in the way of being there for you or helping you and I have an example for my own</p>
<p>Personal life with this one</p>
<p>So one night I&rsquo;m at a bar bitch and y&rsquo;all but like trigger warning gag warning throw up warning</p>
<p>All right. I love watching people throw up, but I don&rsquo;t want that fucking shit near me. I don&rsquo;t want it on me</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s a weird fetish of mine</p>
<p>I like to watch people cry and I like to watch people throw up like I don&rsquo;t want it near me</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to smell it. Like I just want to like it&rsquo;s just satisfying to watch it, you know, but I&rsquo;m at a bar</p>
<p>One night with a couple of friends and we&rsquo;re like outside of the little like area and I&rsquo;m having a fucking cigarette</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hanging out and we&rsquo;re all just like chilling and apparently this dude gets sick and like he&rsquo;s about to throw up</p>
<p>so he takes off running and he like runs through me and my friends and as</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s running through I like do I wasn&rsquo;t aware of like what the fuck was going on?</p>
<p>like I was like talking to somebody mid-conversation and I pointed over at something on the other side of the club and</p>
<p>As I put my arm out and pointed he starts throwing up as he&rsquo;s running by and it fucking like goes</p>
<p>Straight on my arm like full arm covered and fucking some random dudes vomit and he wasn&rsquo;t even cute</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s the fucking worst like you&rsquo;re gonna be ugly and you&rsquo;re gonna throw up on me, please</p>
<p>Oh my god, but I&rsquo;m a nurse</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m used to very very nasty ass shit, and I don&rsquo;t get grossed out by things</p>
<p>I kick in the fucking like fix-it mode and I like I dissociate from the situation and I control it</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just standing there for a second like taking in what the fuck just happened</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like this dude really just fucking threw up on me and everyone around me is like, oh</p>
<p>Oh my fucking god, like girls are gagging guys are like what the fuck like everybody&rsquo;s shocked and like all the people</p>
<p>I was friends with were just kind of like looking around like you so I take my drink my fresh drink</p>
<p>I just got from the fucking bar and I pour it on the top of my arm and like just let it run down and</p>
<p>I got everything off of me and I was just like</p>
<p>Fuck like one. I just lost my whole fucking drink. I just got it and it was good</p>
<p>And then two that&rsquo;s gross as fuck I just got throwed up on by ugly guy</p>
<p>But that was fucking nasty and then all of a sudden my friend Amra comes running up to me with</p>
<p>Napkins and starts like wiping off my arm</p>
<p>Like she didn&rsquo;t care that I just got thrown up on she was there to help me and was the only one</p>
<p>That like came to help me made sure I was okay one</p>
<p>but to like helped me clean it like everybody else was standing around like</p>
<p>And like Amra as soon as she saw it happen took off to the bar grab the fuck ton of napkins and came running back</p>
<p>over to me and</p>
<p>Like she was the only one that was there for me and in that moment. I felt so cared about</p>
<p>Because like she showed me she had my back no matter what and yeah</p>
<p>It was fucking nasty that it was throw up on my arm, but I&rsquo;m the same way if I see</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dealing with something if I care about you you&rsquo;re not dealing with it alone. I don&rsquo;t care how bad it is</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how nasty it is if you&rsquo;re thrown up on I&rsquo;m gonna be right there with you getting it the fuck off you</p>
<p>Just like how Amra was for me. She didn&rsquo;t let anything stop her from being there for me</p>
<p>She was right there with me cleaning it off like everybody else let the throw up stop them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like it was gross. She dove in to give a fuck and was like helping me. She saw I needed something and like she</p>
<p>Prioritized me making sure I was okay and</p>
<p>cleaned it like</p>
<p>She was fucking there for me</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I mean by do people let things get in the way of them being there for you</p>
<p>So like what the throw up like she didn&rsquo;t fucking did she didn&rsquo;t budge. She didn&rsquo;t think twice like yeah</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking gross, but like I was more important to her and she cared more about</p>
<p>Making sure I was okay, then being focused on how gross it was does that make sense</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s deeper than just the throw-up. It&rsquo;s like in that situation everyone around us was so fucking grossed out</p>
<p>That she didn&rsquo;t care if people looked at her like she was fucking nasty because she was coming to clean it off me like</p>
<p>People were looking at me like you because I was like I got thrown up on but like I did like I just look at</p>
<p>Them like you&rsquo;re fucking immature like shut the fuck up like you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re a titty baby-ass bitch if you can&rsquo;t handle a little throw-up</p>
<p>But anyway, they didn&rsquo;t have the background that I have which is nursing like I&rsquo;ve been shit on I&rsquo;ve been thrown up on</p>
<p>Like nursing you see the worst of the worst especially in nursing school</p>
<p>But yeah, my whole point was like she didn&rsquo;t care how people were looking at her</p>
<p>Her priority was being there for me</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something else that someone could let</p>
<p>Prevent them being there for you like if someone is worried about how they&rsquo;re gonna be perceived if they&rsquo;re worried about other people</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if they show that your safety your well-being you making sure you&rsquo;re taken care of you&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not upset if they show you they make that their priority and they care about that</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a solid fucking person, and you know you can trust them</p>
<p>Okay, so my next pointer for knowing you can trust someone is do they exhibit a deeper understanding of things like do they seem like</p>
<p>They just get it do they seem like they understand shit at more than just a surface level like do they are they?</p>
<p>Situationally aware like do they understand that there&rsquo;s more to things that there&rsquo;s more perspectives</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more possibilities solutions explanations like you can tell when someone&rsquo;s with it or when they&rsquo;re fucking not like it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re switched on are</p>
<p>They switched on or are they not because it&rsquo;s a very clear distinction of do people get it or do they not get it?</p>
<p>And one way you can tell if someone is switched on is seeing how they treat other human beings</p>
<p>Are they in touch with the fact that other human beings have feelings?</p>
<p>Like if you look at how people treat wait staff or any customer service</p>
<p>Personnel it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re a human being okay</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not some fucking slave. They&rsquo;re not someone that owes you shit</p>
<p>Alright like I don&rsquo;t like people that have big fucking egos when it comes to like thinking</p>
<p>They are somebody when it comes to customer service you ain&rsquo;t fucking shit</p>
<p>All right be fucking polite or get the fuck out like literally don&rsquo;t do not be mean to people</p>
<p>that shit pisses me off, and I&rsquo;m not even gonna go there, but</p>
<p>You can see are people cut off from the fact that other people are human it doesn&rsquo;t matter what position</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in do they only respect CEOs and people with fucking titles or do they respect the janitor, too?</p>
<p>Are they fucking nice to have a janitor do they speak to the janitor do they hold the door for the janitor?</p>
<p>Do they say hi do they smile are you aware that every single human being has feelings?</p>
<p>Not just the ones that you respect</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you can fucking clock if someone&rsquo;s a piece of shit one or two if they&rsquo;re switched on</p>
<p>Cuz motherfuckers that are not switched on I want to smack upside the fucking head</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve gotten into a lot of like altercations with people for</p>
<p>Being so fucking like unaware that people are human goddamn beings like Jesus Christ</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how we&rsquo;re still so in the dark age with that like these people that are in establishments like</p>
<p>Screaming and showing their ass like over their coffee that got made wrong shut the fuck up</p>
<p>You need to be hit you need to be fucking sat the fuck down</p>
<p>Bitch one you need a reality check of what the fuck&rsquo;s really important in life your little coffee</p>
<p>You can wait bitch, but to like where do you think you&rsquo;re gonna be so disrespectful to somebody just because they made a mistake</p>
<p>And they did something wrong like I understand some people need to be like</p>
<p>Checked and you got to show a little tough love or for you to just berate somebody because they made a mistake</p>
<p>Realize they&rsquo;re a human being</p>
<p>Understand like even if you&rsquo;re in a coffee shop understand baristas if you go to a Starbucks</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly fucking moving go go go they have so much shit. They&rsquo;re doing it&rsquo;s easy to make a little mistake. They&rsquo;re overwhelmed</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot going on like you got to cut them a little slack shit happens. They&rsquo;re humans. They&rsquo;re not machines</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really really big thing that I look for I just unpacked a lot of little points on that one</p>
<p>But you get my point just check are they switched on to the fact that other people are human and that everyone has feelings</p>
<p>Regardless of their position regardless of everything like even the homeless people you see on the side of the road</p>
<p>They still feel all the exact same emotions that you feel so if they seem disconnected</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good word switched off switched on disconnected connected</p>
<p>Whatever you want to word it as just look for that because if someone is switched on and they understand people have emotions</p>
<p>They understand you do too</p>
<p>Okay, so your chances of them hurting you and fucking you over and treating you like shit are lower</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a sign you can trust somebody</p>
<p>Okay, so my next thing to look for you got a check do they fold under pressure and what I mean by do they fold?</p>
<p>Under pressure is can they be convinced against their self and their beliefs and their values?</p>
<p>Can they be forced out of their character?</p>
<p>Because a lot of people will switch the fuck up for money one</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the most common one to</p>
<p>Societal pressure fear of rejection fear of not being liked like people want to be liked and accepted</p>
<p>So they flip the script and they&rsquo;ll flip who they are. Basically. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>They want to appeal to who&rsquo;s in the room and they want to appeal to what like makes a situation best for them</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no consistency in their character</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no consistency and their beliefs and like you don&rsquo;t I mean that they don&rsquo;t have a solid sense of self like they can be</p>
<p>Put under pressure and fold like a fucking napkin. That&rsquo;s someone that you can&rsquo;t trust</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big big red flag is if someone is not able to stand up in a room and</p>
<p>Stand solid and what they believe and what they stand for like do they give in to temptation?</p>
<p>Will they be able to be swayed easily?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I mean, you gotta have someone that can put their fucking foot down and say no and then have that be consistent or like a</p>
<p>big example of this is</p>
<p>discriminatory things people say like there&rsquo;s certain times where people just say</p>
<p>discriminatory shit or like certain words that you shouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>By society&rsquo;s standards like oh that words off-limits</p>
<p>I get it, but judge the context of what they&rsquo;re saying it like with the word faggot</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if people throw around the word faggot like if you throw around the work</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a funny ass word throw around faggot. I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>But as soon as you flip into being disrespectful with that word, I&rsquo;m smacking the fuck out of you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not putting up with that shit</p>
<p>You need someone that&rsquo;s not scared to speak up especially with like racist shit</p>
<p>Like if someone says a certain term and it&rsquo;s not like harmful. I get like not</p>
<p>Needing to make it like a big deal</p>
<p>But if someone&rsquo;s saying something in a derogatory way check them stand the fuck up and speak up</p>
<p>You need someone that will speak up regardless. That&rsquo;s how you know</p>
<p>You can trust someone is whose values stay in line. No matter who they&rsquo;re around, you know, you know, sometimes it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Oh, I just don&rsquo;t want to cause any trouble and it&rsquo;s like nah</p>
<p>Cuz if it actually bothered you you&rsquo;d speak the fuck up. It would not feel good to shut up. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>So someone that&rsquo;s consistent with their beliefs and what they stand for you got to watch out for that</p>
<p>That means they&rsquo;re trustworthy if they be flip-flopping and folding like a napkin. They&rsquo;re not trustworthy</p>
<p>Okay, this is just a little quick one, but people that are worried about looking broke</p>
<p>That is a type of person</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking get like it&rsquo;s so common now that P everyone tries to not look poor to not look broke</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the people that are actually concerned about not looking broke are broke people rich people don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>If someone thinks that they&rsquo;re broke because they know that they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>So anyone that&rsquo;s like always having to do the bougie shit and can&rsquo;t do nothing ratchet</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re the brokest fucking ones the ones that are always like I only do the best like I only do a filet mignon</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like bitch if you go to a restaurant with somebody and they order a filet and they say filet mignon. They&rsquo;re broke</p>
<p>Only broke people say the full fucking name. It&rsquo;s a filet bitch. It&rsquo;s clear that you don&rsquo;t eat them often</p>
<p>Okay now I&rsquo;m just talking shit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just talking shit</p>
<p>But I really do mean it about the filet like do not ever say mignon in front of mignon mignon mignon</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say that in front of me bitch. It&rsquo;s a filet. It&rsquo;s a filet period done shut up after that</p>
<p>But yeah, my whole point with that is like people that can go back and forth with</p>
<p>The shit that they do so like someone that&rsquo;s down to do bum shit and someone that&rsquo;s down to do bougie shit like but not</p>
<p>Someone that always has to do bougie shit like someone that is so scared to look like broke</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust you because what are you willing to do to not look broke? Are you willing to sacrifice me?</p>
<p>Are you willing to?</p>
<p>Embarrass me put me down put me in a weird situation just so you don&rsquo;t look broke</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not safe because you don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re willing to put you down to look better in front of others</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s someone that cares too much about other people&rsquo;s judgment of them</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t fuck with nobody like that like I understand why they are the way that they are</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want you near me</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unsafe to be around because it&rsquo;s gonna be at my expense that you don&rsquo;t look broke</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna come to that eventually and I don&rsquo;t like to have to be around people like that</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m someone that like girl my fucking couch is from Goodwill. It was $200</p>
<p>You know what else was $200 my fucking Versace ashtray</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very picky about where I&rsquo;ll spend my money. I&rsquo;m not broke</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not rich, but I don&rsquo;t care about looking rich like I don&rsquo;t care if people look at me like oh my god</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s broke cuz I know I&rsquo;m fucking not you know</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how you know somebody&rsquo;s broke is if they&rsquo;re so worried about looking broke like I&rsquo;m able to do</p>
<p>The bougie shit and the ratchet shit like I can do both and I need that in all of my friendships like you need someone</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like that and that doesn&rsquo;t care about how they&rsquo;re being perceived</p>
<p>You know so if they&rsquo;re down to pregame with you in the car before you go into the club</p>
<p>Or if they&rsquo;re down to save money in certain spots are down to go to thrift stores</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re down to do just anything like if they&rsquo;re smart around money, and they don&rsquo;t give a fuck about looking broke. They&rsquo;re trustworthy</p>
<p>Okay, so my next one do they own the shit that they say</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve talked about this before on my podcast, but it is such a big one like if I say something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna own it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so bold with the shit that I say like anything. I say that&rsquo;s very like stern or harsh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought it through and I know I&rsquo;m right, and it&rsquo;s a solid point, and there&rsquo;s no negating it</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fucking fight in it</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a rebuttal like if you look at my tick tocks with like where I like cuss people the fuck out</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no rebuttal bitch your case is closed like drop that hammer dung dung law and order face ass like it&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so bold with what I say</p>
<p>Because I know it&rsquo;s the truth, and I&rsquo;ll stand behind it like I&rsquo;m not the type to backtrack</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if I say something, and I need to clear up something</p>
<p>I said I will but I&rsquo;m so strategic when I speak I don&rsquo;t have to take shit back</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fully fine standing behind something. I said so like if I say something about somebody</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing is I don&rsquo;t talk shit about people if I say something about you</p>
<p>And it sounded like I was talking shit. That&rsquo;s a wake-up call that I&rsquo;m not talking shit</p>
<p>I just said something I observed about you, and you don&rsquo;t like how it sounds so that call is coming from inside the house, babe</p>
<p>You need to fucking reflect on that. I&rsquo;m not talking shit. What you&rsquo;re doing is just shitty</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a big thing like if someone says something about someone or says something about a situation or voices an opinion</p>
<p>Do you stand behind it or do you backtrack if someone backtracks don&rsquo;t trust them?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck unless it&rsquo;s about your safety cuz like if I like I&rsquo;ll talk all this shit on cops like fuck cops</p>
<p>Fuck the system, but whenever I get pulled over or whenever I&rsquo;m interacting with a cop. I&rsquo;m a manipulative little fucking shit</p>
<p>I always start out nice. I always start out like I honestly don&rsquo;t fucking I don&rsquo;t engage them</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t talk to them</p>
<p>I size them up and I look at them and I watch their mannerisms cuz I just need to know you don&rsquo;t I mean</p>
<p>But if they interact with me, I&rsquo;m like I don&rsquo;t overextend myself</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking keeping my distance, but if I get pulled over or something. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>Manipulative and if I have to be nice to be manipulative here I go</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s because my ass is on the line</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a situation where like my safety is involved because if you piss off the wrong cop these corrupt little motherfuckers</p>
<p>Will fuck with your life and arrest you for blinking too many times like they&rsquo;ll find some stupid ass example</p>
<p>You got a little you look a little cock-eyed you must be drunk no bitch</p>
<p>I just got a lazy eye you&rsquo;re arrested boom like if you piss off the wrong one. You&rsquo;re fucked so I understand you got to like</p>
<p>Navigate certain situations so like that like if your physical safety is</p>
<p>At risk I get it, but I&rsquo;m talking shit</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not like that like people that just be talking shit, and I&rsquo;ll stand behind it. I don&rsquo;t fuck with that</p>
<p>Okay, so we got two more</p>
<p>my next one is look for</p>
<p>Does someone need to justify what they do like do they always need to feel the reason to explain</p>
<p>What someone did to them that justified them doing something back you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if someone asked me Leo. Did you just call that woman a fucking cunt? Yep? I sure did I?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t feel the need to explain further. Well. She said this to me first or she did this first</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m fine. Just sitting here and owning up to what I did does that make sense like I&rsquo;m not afraid to look like a</p>
<p>Bad guy because I know I&rsquo;m not a bad guy so when people constantly feel the need to explain</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re scared of looking like a bad guy because they feel like one if I do some fucked-up shit</p>
<p>You best know the motherfucker deserved it that I don&rsquo;t care if I look like a bad guy</p>
<p>so just look out for that if there&rsquo;s any allegation made against the person and</p>
<p>They all of a sudden like they feel the need to quickly defend their self</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re eager to do it, and they&rsquo;re like antsy to defend their self constantly</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t take the pressure of possibly looking like a bad person. That&rsquo;s the red flag</p>
<p>so someone that can stand and what they did and</p>
<p>Not be like ruined by the fact that you think they&rsquo;re a bad person. That&rsquo;s a good sign</p>
<p>Okay, so moving on to my last thing</p>
<p>This is the most important one and it&rsquo;s gonna be short and sweet and like to the goddamn point</p>
<p>When you say you&rsquo;re uncomfortable</p>
<p>What do they do?</p>
<p>Do they all of a sudden make a change do they change something do they care that you&rsquo;re uncomfortable and try to make you more</p>
<p>Comfortable or do they ignore it do they try to tell you you&rsquo;re annoying do they try to discard it?</p>
<p>Do they try to invalidate it do they try to make you seem like you&rsquo;re being dramatic?</p>
<p>What is their response?</p>
<p>to hearing that you are</p>
<p>Experiencing something uncomfortable, and you know the answer for fucking that okay, so I want to leave the podcast off on that one</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve prepared you</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m sending my kids off to school</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;ve just taught you everything you need to know before you go to the school of life</p>
<p>Good luck. Love you so much be safe</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I feel right now. I feel like a proud parent, but if you&rsquo;ve made it this far in the podcast</p>
<p>Will you leave me a five-star rating because if you made it this far. I taught you something goddamn it so</p>
<p>Give me the five stars. Thank you</p>
<p>But if you are listening to this share it to your Instagram story if you have Instagram fucking share this shit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll repost you on my story, too</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be friends if you do want to follow me all of my social media will be linked in this podcast</p>
<p>You can go follow all my tick tocks my Instagram all the good stuff</p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;re interested in a one-on-one call with me</p>
<p>I do coaching calls so we can talk on zoom about whatever you&rsquo;re going through and I will get you through it</p>
<p>And I will offer you any insight that I have and I promise you will not be the same at the end of the call</p>
<p>because none of my clients have been I</p>
<p>Will leave the link for the application for that if you want to apply to be a client</p>
<p>But thank you so much for listening</p>
<p>I hope you feel a newfound sense of like security with yourself and like okay now I can trust myself</p>
<p>Because I know how to know if I can trust someone else</p>
<p>So that makes sense like you can now trust your judgment if someone is trustworthy</p>
<p>So I hope I&rsquo;ve supplied you and equipped you with what you need to know</p>
<p>If you have any questions feel free to DM me and I can post a story if I need to elaborate more if people keep</p>
<p>asking the same thing, but</p>
<p>Thank you so much for listening</p>
<p>Stay safe. Take care of yourself. And even though I just told you how to trust someone</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tattooed on my hand for a reason. So I&rsquo;m gonna remind you of it</p>
<p>Trust no one. I will talk to you next Sunday</p>
