    <p>The following is a conversation with Ayana Howard.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a roboticist, professor Georgia Tech,</p>
<p>and director of the Human Automation Systems Lab,</p>
<p>with research interests in human robot interaction,</p>
<p>assisted robots in the home, therapy gaming apps,</p>
<p>and remote robotic exploration of extreme environments.</p>
<p>Like me, in her work, she cares a lot</p>
<p>about both robots and human beings,</p>
<p>and so I really enjoyed this conversation.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>give it five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>follow on Spotify, support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>I recently started doing ads</p>
<p>at the end of the introduction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode,</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,</p>
<p>but you can also use it to buy, sell,</p>
<p>and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.</p>
<p>Cash App also has a new investing feature.</p>
<p>You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,</p>
<p>no matter what the stock price is.</p>
<p>Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,</p>
<p>a subsidiary of Square and Member SIPC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working with Cash App</p>
<p>to support one of my favorite organizations called First,</p>
<p>best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.</p>
<p>They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students</p>
<p>in over 110 countries,</p>
<p>and have a perfect rating at Charity Navigator,</p>
<p>which means that donated money</p>
<p>is used to maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play</p>
<p>and use code LEXPODCAST, you&rsquo;ll get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>which again, is an organization</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve personally seen inspire girls and boys</p>
<p>to dream of engineering a better world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Ayanna Howard.</p>
<p>What or who is the most amazing robot you&rsquo;ve ever met,</p>
<p>or perhaps had the biggest impact on your career?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t met her, but I grew up with her,</p>
<p>but of course, Rosie.</p>
<p>So, and I think it&rsquo;s because also.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s Rosie?</p>
<p>Rosie from the Jetsons.</p>
<p>She is all things to all people, right?</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Like anything you wanted, it was like magic, it happened.</p>
<p>So people not only anthropomorphize,</p>
<p>but project whatever they wish for the robot to be onto.</p>
<p>Onto Rosie.</p>
<p>But also, I mean, think about it.</p>
<p>She was socially engaging.</p>
<p>She every so often had an attitude, right?</p>
<p>She kept us honest.</p>
<p>She would push back sometimes</p>
<p>when George was doing some weird stuff.</p>
<p>But she cared about people, especially the kids.</p>
<p>She was like the perfect robot.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve said that people don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>their robots to be perfect.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate that?</p>
<p>What do you think that is?</p>
<p>Just like you said, Rosie pushed back a little bit</p>
<p>every once in a while.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>So if you think about robotics in general,</p>
<p>we want them because they enhance our quality of life.</p>
<p>And usually that&rsquo;s linked to something that&rsquo;s functional.</p>
<p>Even if you think of self driving cars,</p>
<p>why is there a fascination?</p>
<p>Because people really do hate to drive.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s the like Saturday driving</p>
<p>where I can just speed,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s the I have to go to work every day</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m in traffic for an hour.</p>
<p>I mean, people really hate that.</p>
<p>And so robots are designed to basically enhance</p>
<p>our ability to increase our quality of life.</p>
<p>And so the perfection comes from this aspect of interaction.</p>
<p>If I think about how we drive, if we drove perfectly,</p>
<p>we would never get anywhere, right?</p>
<p>So think about how many times you had to run past the light</p>
<p>because you see the car behind you</p>
<p>is about to crash into you.</p>
<p>Or that little kid kind of runs into the street</p>
<p>and so you have to cross on the other side</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no cars, right?</p>
<p>Like if you think about it, we are not perfect drivers.</p>
<p>Some of it is because it&rsquo;s our world.</p>
<p>And so if you have a robot that is perfect</p>
<p>in that sense of the word,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t really be able to function with us.</p>
<p>Can you linger a little bit on the word perfection?</p>
<p>So from the robotics perspective,</p>
<p>what does that word mean</p>
<p>and how is sort of the optimal behavior</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re describing different</p>
<p>than what we think is perfection?</p>
<p>Yeah, so perfection, if you think about it</p>
<p>in the more theoretical point of view,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really tied to accuracy, right?</p>
<p>So if I have a function,</p>
<p>can I complete it at 100% accuracy with zero errors?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s kind of, if you think about perfection</p>
<p>in the sense of the word.</p>
<p>And in the self driving car realm,</p>
<p>do you think from a robotics perspective,</p>
<p>we kind of think that perfection means</p>
<p>following the rules perfectly,</p>
<p>sort of defining, staying in the lane, changing lanes.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s a green light, you go.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s a red light, you stop.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the, and be able to perfectly see</p>
<p>all the entities in the scene.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the limit of what we think of as perfection.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where the problem comes</p>
<p>is that when people think about perfection for robotics,</p>
<p>the ones that are the most successful</p>
<p>are the ones that are quote unquote perfect.</p>
<p>Like I said, Rosie is perfect,</p>
<p>but she actually wasn&rsquo;t perfect in terms of accuracy,</p>
<p>but she was perfect in terms of how she interacted</p>
<p>and how she adapted.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s some of the disconnect</p>
<p>is that we really want perfection</p>
<p>with respect to its ability to adapt to us.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really want perfection with respect to 100% accuracy</p>
<p>with respect to the rules that we just made up anyway, right?</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s this disconnect sometimes</p>
<p>between what we really want and what happens.</p>
<p>And we see this all the time, like in my research, right?</p>
<p>Like the optimal, quote unquote optimal interactions</p>
<p>are when the robot is adapting based on the person,</p>
<p>not 100% following what&rsquo;s optimal based on the rules.</p>
<p>Just to link on autonomous vehicles for a second,</p>
<p>just your thoughts, maybe off the top of the head,</p>
<p>how hard is that problem do you think</p>
<p>based on what we just talked about?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of folks in the automotive industry,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very confident from Elon Musk to Waymo</p>
<p>to all these companies.</p>
<p>How hard is it to solve that last piece?</p>
<p>The last mile.</p>
<p>The gap between the perfection and the human definition</p>
<p>of how you actually function in this world.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is a moving target.</p>
<p>So I remember when all the big companies</p>
<p>started to heavily invest in this</p>
<p>and there was a number of even roboticists</p>
<p>as well as folks who were putting in the VCs</p>
<p>and corporations, Elon Musk being one of them that said,</p>
<p>self driving cars on the road with people</p>
<p>within five years, that was a little while ago.</p>
<p>And now people are saying five years, 10 years, 20 years,</p>
<p>some are saying never, right?</p>
<p>I think if you look at some of the things</p>
<p>that are being successful is these</p>
<p>basically fixed environments</p>
<p>where you still have some anomalies, right?</p>
<p>You still have people walking, you still have stores,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have other drivers, right?</p>
<p>Like other human drivers are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a dedicated space for the cars.</p>
<p>Because if you think about robotics in general,</p>
<p>where has always been successful?</p>
<p>I mean, you can say manufacturing,</p>
<p>like way back in the day, right?</p>
<p>It was a fixed environment, humans were not part</p>
<p>of the equation, we&rsquo;re a lot better than that.</p>
<p>But like when we can carve out scenarios</p>
<p>that are closer to that space,</p>
<p>then I think that it&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>So a closed campus where you don&rsquo;t have self driving cars</p>
<p>and maybe some protection so that the students</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t jet in front just because they wanna see what happens.</p>
<p>Like having a little bit, I think that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna see the most success in the near future.</p>
<p>And be slow moving.</p>
<p>Right, not 55, 60, 70 miles an hour,</p>
<p>but the speed of a golf cart, right?</p>
<p>So that said, the most successful</p>
<p>in the automotive industry robots operating today</p>
<p>in the hands of real people are ones that are traveling</p>
<p>over 55 miles an hour and in unconstrained environments,</p>
<p>which is Tesla vehicles, so Tesla autopilot.</p>
<p>So I would love to hear sort of your,</p>
<p>just thoughts of two things.</p>
<p>So one, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve gotten to see,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve heard about something called smart summon</p>
<p>where Tesla system, autopilot system,</p>
<p>where the car drives zero occupancy, no driver</p>
<p>in the parking lot slowly sort of tries to navigate</p>
<p>the parking lot to find itself to you.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some incredible amounts of videos</p>
<p>and just hilarity that happens as it awkwardly tries</p>
<p>to navigate this environment, but it&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>nonverbal communication between machine and human</p>
<p>that I think is a, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s some of the work</p>
<p>that you do in this kind of interesting</p>
<p>human robot interaction space.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts in general about it?</p>
<p>So I do have that feature.</p>
<p>Do you drive a Tesla?</p>
<p>I do, mainly because I&rsquo;m a gadget freak, right?</p>
<p>So I say it&rsquo;s a gadget that happens to have some wheels.</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen some of the videos.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s your experience like?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re a human robot interaction roboticist,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a legit sort of expert in the field.</p>
<p>So what does it feel for a machine to come to you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of these very fascinating things,</p>
<p>but also I am hyper, hyper alert, right?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m hyper alert, like my butt, my thumb is like,</p>
<p>oh, okay, I&rsquo;m ready to take over.</p>
<p>Even when I&rsquo;m in my car or I&rsquo;m doing things like automated</p>
<p>backing into, so there&rsquo;s like a feature where you can do</p>
<p>this automating backing into a parking space,</p>
<p>or bring the car out of your garage,</p>
<p>or even, you know, pseudo autopilot on the freeway, right?</p>
<p>I am hypersensitive.</p>
<p>I can feel like as I&rsquo;m navigating,</p>
<p>like, yeah, that&rsquo;s an error right there.</p>
<p>Like I am very aware of it, but I&rsquo;m also fascinated by it.</p>
<p>And it does get better.</p>
<p>Like I look and see it&rsquo;s learning from all of these people</p>
<p>who are cutting it on, like every time I cut it on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting better, right?</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s amazing about it is that.</p>
<p>This nice dance of you&rsquo;re still hyper vigilant.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re still not trusting it at all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And yet you&rsquo;re using it.</p>
<p>On the highway, if I were to, like what,</p>
<p>as a roboticist, we&rsquo;ll talk about trust a little bit.</p>
<p>How do you explain that?</p>
<p>You still use it.</p>
<p>Is it the gadget freak part?</p>
<p>Like where you just enjoy exploring technology?</p>
<p>Or is that the right actually balance</p>
<p>between robotics and humans is where you use it,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t trust it.</p>
<p>And somehow there&rsquo;s this dance</p>
<p>that ultimately is a positive.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t necessarily trust technology,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m an early adopter, right?</p>
<p>So when it first comes out,</p>
<p>I will use everything,</p>
<p>but I will be very, very cautious of how I use it.</p>
<p>Do you read about it or do you explore it by just try it?</p>
<p>Do you like crudely, to put it crudely,</p>
<p>do you read the manual or do you learn through exploration?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an explorer.</p>
<p>If I have to read the manual, then I do design.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s a bad user interface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a failure.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is very confident that you kind of take it</p>
<p>from where it is now to full autonomy.</p>
<p>So from this human robot interaction,</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t really trust and then you try</p>
<p>and then you catch it when it fails to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to incrementally improve itself</p>
<p>into full where you don&rsquo;t need to participate.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense of that trajectory?</p>
<p>Is it feasible?</p>
<p>So the promise there is by the end of next year,</p>
<p>by the end of 2020 is the current promise.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense about that journey that Tesla&rsquo;s on?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s kind of three things going on though.</p>
<p>I think in terms of will people go like as a user,</p>
<p>as a adopter, will you trust going to that point?</p>
<p>I think so, right?</p>
<p>Like there are some users and it&rsquo;s because what happens is</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re hypersensitive at the beginning</p>
<p>and then the technology tends to work,</p>
<p>your apprehension slowly goes away.</p>
<p>And as people, we tend to swing to the other extreme, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, oh, I was like hyper, hyper fearful</p>
<p>or hypersensitive and it was awesome.</p>
<p>And we just tend to swing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just human nature.</p>
<p>And so you will have, I mean, and I&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a scary notion because most people</p>
<p>are now extremely untrusting of autopilot.</p>
<p>They use it, but they don&rsquo;t trust it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a scary notion that there&rsquo;s a certain point</p>
<p>where you allow yourself to look at the smartphone</p>
<p>for like 20 seconds.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be this phase shift</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;ll be like 20 seconds, 30 seconds,</p>
<p>one minute, two minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scary proposition.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s people, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s humans.</p>
<p>I mean, I think of even our use of,</p>
<p>I mean, just everything on the internet, right?</p>
<p>Like think about how reliant we are on certain apps</p>
<p>and certain engines, right?</p>
<p>20 years ago, people have been like, oh yeah, that&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>Like that makes no sense.</p>
<p>Like, of course that&rsquo;s false.</p>
<p>Like now it&rsquo;s just like, oh, of course I&rsquo;ve been using it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been correct all this time.</p>
<p>Of course aliens, I didn&rsquo;t think they existed,</p>
<p>but now it says they do, obviously.</p>
<p>100%, earth is flat.</p>
<p>So, okay, but you said three things.</p>
<p>So one is the human.</p>
<p>Okay, so one is the human.</p>
<p>And I think there will be a group of individuals</p>
<p>that will swing, right?</p>
<p>I just.</p>
<p>Teenagers.</p>
<p>Teenage, I mean, it&rsquo;ll be, it&rsquo;ll be adults.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually an age demographic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimal for technology adoption.</p>
<p>And you can actually find them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re actually pretty easy to find.</p>
<p>Just based on their habits, based on,</p>
<p>so if someone like me who wasn&rsquo;t a roboticist</p>
<p>would probably be the optimal kind of person, right?</p>
<p>Early adopter, okay with technology,</p>
<p>very comfortable and not hypersensitive, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just hypersensitive cause I designed this stuff.</p>
<p>So there is a target demographic that will swing.</p>
<p>The other one though,</p>
<p>is you still have these humans that are on the road.</p>
<p>That one is a harder, harder thing to do.</p>
<p>And as long as we have people that are on the same streets,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be the big issue.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just because you can&rsquo;t possibly,</p>
<p>I wanna say you can&rsquo;t possibly map the,</p>
<p>some of the silliness of human drivers, right?</p>
<p>Like as an example, when you&rsquo;re next to that car</p>
<p>that has that big sticker called student driver, right?</p>
<p>Like you are like, oh, either I&rsquo;m going to like go around.</p>
<p>Like we are, we know that that person</p>
<p>is just gonna make mistakes that make no sense, right?</p>
<p>How do you map that information?</p>
<p>Or if I am in a car and I look over</p>
<p>and I see two fairly young looking individuals</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no student driver bumper</p>
<p>and I see them chit chatting to each other,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, that&rsquo;s an issue, right?</p>
<p>So how do you get that kind of information</p>
<p>and that experience into basically an autopilot?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s millions of cases like that</p>
<p>where we take little hints to establish context.</p>
<p>I mean, you said kind of beautifully poetic human things,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s probably subtle things about the environment</p>
<p>about it being maybe time for commuters</p>
<p>to start going home from work</p>
<p>and therefore you can make some kind of judgment</p>
<p>about the group behavior of pedestrians, blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>and so on and so on.</p>
<p>Or even cities, right?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re in Boston, how people cross the street,</p>
<p>like lights are not an issue versus other places</p>
<p>where people will actually wait for the crosswalk.</p>
<p>Seattle or somewhere peaceful.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;ve also seen sort of just even in Boston</p>
<p>that intersection to intersection is different.</p>
<p>So every intersection has a personality of its own.</p>
<p>So certain neighborhoods of Boston are different.</p>
<p>So we kind of, and based on different timing of day,</p>
<p>at night, it&rsquo;s all, there&rsquo;s a dynamic to human behavior</p>
<p>that we kind of figure out ourselves.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not able to introspect and figure it out,</p>
<p>but somehow our brain learns it.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re saying, is there a shortcut?</p>
<p>Is there a shortcut, though, for a robot?</p>
<p>Is there something that could be done, you think,</p>
<p>that, you know, that&rsquo;s what we humans do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like bird flight, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the example they give for flight.</p>
<p>Do you necessarily need to build a bird that flies</p>
<p>or can you do an airplane?</p>
<p>Is there a shortcut to it?</p>
<p>So I think the shortcut is, and I kind of,</p>
<p>I talk about it as a fixed space,</p>
<p>where, so imagine that there&rsquo;s a neighborhood</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a new smart city or a new neighborhood</p>
<p>that says, you know what?</p>
<p>We are going to design this new city</p>
<p>based on supporting self driving cars.</p>
<p>And then doing things, knowing that there&rsquo;s anomalies,</p>
<p>knowing that people are like this, right?</p>
<p>And designing it based on that assumption</p>
<p>that like, we&rsquo;re gonna have this.</p>
<p>That would be an example of a shortcut.</p>
<p>So you still have people,</p>
<p>but you do very specific things</p>
<p>to try to minimize the noise a little bit</p>
<p>as an example.</p>
<p>And the people themselves become accepting of the notion</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s autonomous cars, right?</p>
<p>Right, like they move into,</p>
<p>so right now you have like a,</p>
<p>you will have a self selection bias, right?</p>
<p>Like individuals will move into this neighborhood</p>
<p>knowing like this is part of like the real estate pitch,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s a way to do a shortcut.</p>
<p>One, it allows you to deploy.</p>
<p>It allows you to collect then data with these variances</p>
<p>and anomalies, cause people are still people,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a safer space and it&rsquo;s more of an accepting space.</p>
<p>I.e. when something in that space might happen</p>
<p>because things do,</p>
<p>because you already have the self selection,</p>
<p>like people would be, I think a little more forgiving</p>
<p>than other places.</p>
<p>And you said three things, did we cover all of them?</p>
<p>The third is legal law, liability,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t really want to touch,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still of concern.</p>
<p>And the mishmash with like with policy as well,</p>
<p>sort of government, all that whole.</p>
<p>That big ball of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, gotcha.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, so we&rsquo;re out of time now.</p>
<p>Do you think from a robotics perspective,</p>
<p>you know, if you&rsquo;re kind of honest of what cars do,</p>
<p>they kind of threaten each other&rsquo;s life all the time.</p>
<p>So cars are various.</p>
<p>I mean, in order to navigate intersections,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an assertiveness, there&rsquo;s a risk taking.</p>
<p>And if you were to reduce it to an objective function,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a probability of murder in that function,</p>
<p>meaning you killing another human being</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re using that.</p>
<p>First of all, it has to be low enough</p>
<p>to be acceptable to you on an ethical level</p>
<p>as an individual human being,</p>
<p>but it has to be high enough for people to respect you</p>
<p>to not sort of take advantage of you completely</p>
<p>and jaywalk in front of you and so on.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a right answer here,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s, how do we solve that?</p>
<p>How do we solve that from a robotics perspective</p>
<p>when danger and human life is at stake?</p>
<p>Yeah, as they say, cars don&rsquo;t kill people,</p>
<p>People kill people.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I think.</p>
<p>And now robotic algorithms would be killing people.</p>
<p>Right, so it will be robotics algorithms that are pro,</p>
<p>no, it will be robotic algorithms don&rsquo;t kill people.</p>
<p>Developers of robotic algorithms kill people, right?</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things is people are still in the loop</p>
<p>and at least in the near and midterm,</p>
<p>I think people will still be in the loop at some point,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a developer.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re not necessarily at the stage</p>
<p>where robots are programming autonomous robots</p>
<p>with different behaviors quite yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scary notion, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>that a developer has some responsibility</p>
<p>in the death of a human being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a heavy burden.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s why the whole aspect of ethics</p>
<p>in our community is so, so important, right?</p>
<p>Like, because it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>If you think about it, you can basically say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to work on weaponized AI, right?</p>
<p>Like people can say, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m gonna do.</p>
<p>But yet you are programming algorithms</p>
<p>that might be used in healthcare algorithms</p>
<p>that might decide whether this person</p>
<p>should get this medication or not.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t and they die.</p>
<p>Okay, so that is your responsibility, right?</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not conscious and aware</p>
<p>that you do have that power when you&rsquo;re coding</p>
<p>and things like that, I think that&rsquo;s just not a good thing.</p>
<p>Like we need to think about this responsibility</p>
<p>as we program robots and computing devices</p>
<p>much more than we are.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s not an option to not think about ethics.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a majority, I would say, of computer science.</p>
<p>Sort of, it&rsquo;s kind of a hot topic now,</p>
<p>I think about bias and so on, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about it, but usually it&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a very particular group of people</p>
<p>that work on that.</p>
<p>And then people who do like robotics are like,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t have to think about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other smart people thinking about it.</p>
<p>It seems that everybody has to think about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, you can&rsquo;t escape the ethics,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s bias or just every aspect of ethics</p>
<p>that has to do with human beings.</p>
<p>Everyone.</p>
<p>So think about, I&rsquo;m gonna age myself,</p>
<p>but I remember when we didn&rsquo;t have like testers, right?</p>
<p>And so what did you do?</p>
<p>As a developer, you had to test your own code, right?</p>
<p>Like you had to go through all the cases and figure it out</p>
<p>and then they realized that,</p>
<p>we probably need to have testing</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not getting all the things.</p>
<p>And so from there, what happens is like most developers,</p>
<p>they do a little bit of testing, but it&rsquo;s usually like,</p>
<p>okay, did my compiler bug out?</p>
<p>Let me look at the warnings.</p>
<p>Okay, is that acceptable or not, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s how you typically think about as a developer</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll just assume that it&rsquo;s going to go</p>
<p>to another process and they&rsquo;re gonna test it out.</p>
<p>But I think we need to go back to those early days</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a developer, you&rsquo;re developing,</p>
<p>there should be like the say,</p>
<p>okay, let me look at the ethical outcomes of this</p>
<p>because there isn&rsquo;t a second like testing ethical testers,</p>
<p>right, it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>We did it back in the early coding days.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where we are with respect to ethics.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s go back to what was good practices</p>
<p>and only because we were just developing the field.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s a really heavy burden.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to feel it recently in the last few months,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a good one to feel like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a message, more than one from people.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve unfortunately gotten some attention recently</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve gotten messages that say that</p>
<p>I have blood on my hands</p>
<p>because of working on semi autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>So the idea that you have semi autonomy means</p>
<p>people will become, will lose vigilance and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually be humans, as we described.</p>
<p>And because of that, because of this idea</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re creating automation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be people be hurt because of it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s many nights</p>
<p>where I wasn&rsquo;t able to sleep because of this notion.</p>
<p>You know, you really do think about people that might die</p>
<p>because of this technology.</p>
<p>Of course, you can then start rationalizing saying,</p>
<p>well, you know what, 40,000 people die in the United States</p>
<p>every year and we&rsquo;re trying to ultimately try to save lives.</p>
<p>But the reality is your code you&rsquo;ve written</p>
<p>might kill somebody.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an important burden to carry with you</p>
<p>as you design the code.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think of it as a burden</p>
<p>if we train this concept correctly from the beginning.</p>
<p>And I use, and not to say that coding is like</p>
<p>being a medical doctor, but think about it.</p>
<p>Medical doctors, if they&rsquo;ve been in situations</p>
<p>where their patient didn&rsquo;t survive, right?</p>
<p>Do they give up and go away?</p>
<p>No, every time they come in,</p>
<p>they know that there might be a possibility</p>
<p>that this patient might not survive.</p>
<p>And so when they approach every decision,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s in the back of their head.</p>
<p>And so why isn&rsquo;t that we aren&rsquo;t teaching,</p>
<p>and those are tools though, right?</p>
<p>They are given some of the tools to address that</p>
<p>so that they don&rsquo;t go crazy.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t give those tools</p>
<p>so that it does feel like a burden</p>
<p>versus something of I have a great gift</p>
<p>and I can do great, awesome good,</p>
<p>but with it comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what we teach in terms of</p>
<p>if you think about the medical schools, right?</p>
<p>Great gift, great responsibility.</p>
<p>I think if we just change the messaging a little,</p>
<p>great gift, being a developer, great responsibility.</p>
<p>And this is how you combine those.</p>
<p>But do you think, I mean, this is really interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s outside, I actually have no friends</p>
<p>who are sort of surgeons or doctors.</p>
<p>I mean, what does it feel like</p>
<p>to make a mistake in a surgery and somebody to die</p>
<p>because of that?</p>
<p>Like, is that something you could be taught</p>
<p>in medical school, sort of how to be accepting of that risk?</p>
<p>So, because I do a lot of work with healthcare robotics,</p>
<p>I have not lost a patient, for example.</p>
<p>The first one&rsquo;s always the hardest, right?</p>
<p>But they really teach the value, right?</p>
<p>So, they teach responsibility,</p>
<p>but they also teach the value.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re saving 40,000,</p>
<p>but in order to really feel good about that,</p>
<p>when you come to a decision,</p>
<p>you have to be able to say at the end,</p>
<p>I did all that I could possibly do, right?</p>
<p>Versus a, well, I just picked the first widget, right?</p>
<p>Like, so every decision is actually thought through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a habit, it&rsquo;s not a,</p>
<p>let me just take the best algorithm</p>
<p>that my friend gave me, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, is this it, is this the best?</p>
<p>Have I done my best to do good, right?</p>
<p>And so&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, and I think burden is the wrong word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a gift, but you have to treat it extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So, on a slightly related note,</p>
<p>in a recent paper,</p>
<p>The Ugly Truth About Ourselves and Our Robot Creations,</p>
<p>you discuss, you highlight some biases</p>
<p>that may affect the function of various robotic systems.</p>
<p>Can you talk through, if you remember, examples of some?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of examples.</p>
<p>I usually&hellip; What is bias, first of all?</p>
<p>Yeah, so bias is this,</p>
<p>and so bias, which is different than prejudice.</p>
<p>So, bias is that we all have these preconceived notions</p>
<p>about particular, everything from particular groups</p>
<p>to habits to identity, right?</p>
<p>So, we have these predispositions,</p>
<p>and so when we address a problem,</p>
<p>we look at a problem and make a decision,</p>
<p>those preconceived notions might affect our outputs,</p>
<p>our outcomes.</p>
<p>So, there the bias can be positive and negative,</p>
<p>and then is prejudice the negative kind of bias?</p>
<p>Prejudice is the negative, right?</p>
<p>So, prejudice is that not only are you aware of your bias,</p>
<p>but you are then take it and have a negative outcome,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re aware, like&hellip;</p>
<p>And there could be gray areas too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always gray areas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the challenging aspect of all ethical questions.</p>
<p>So, I always like&hellip;</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s a funny one,</p>
<p>and in fact, I think it might be in the paper,</p>
<p>because I think I talk about self driving cars,</p>
<p>but think about this.</p>
<p>We, for teenagers, right?</p>
<p>Typically, insurance companies charge quite a bit of money</p>
<p>if you have a teenage driver.</p>
<p>So, you could say that&rsquo;s an age bias, right?</p>
<p>But no one will claim&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, parents will be grumpy,</p>
<p>but no one really says that that&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everybody in human factors and safety research almost&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s quite ruthlessly critical of teenagers.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t question, is that okay?</p>
<p>Is that okay to be ageist in this kind of way?</p>
<p>It is, and it is ageist, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely ageist, there&rsquo;s no question about it.</p>
<p>And so, this is the gray area, right?</p>
<p>Because you know that teenagers are more likely</p>
<p>to be in accidents,</p>
<p>and so, there&rsquo;s actually some data to it.</p>
<p>But then, if you take that same example,</p>
<p>and you say, well, I&rsquo;m going to make the insurance higher</p>
<p>for an area of Boston,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of accidents.</p>
<p>And then, they find out that that&rsquo;s correlated</p>
<p>with socioeconomics.</p>
<p>Well, then it becomes a problem, right?</p>
<p>Like, that is not acceptable,</p>
<p>but yet, the teenager, which is age&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s against age, is, right?</p>
<p>We figure that out as a society by having conversations,</p>
<p>by having discourse.</p>
<p>I mean, throughout history,</p>
<p>the definition of what is ethical or not has changed,</p>
<p>and hopefully, always for the better.</p>
<p>Correct, correct.</p>
<p>So, in terms of bias or prejudice in algorithms,</p>
<p>what examples do you sometimes think about?</p>
<p>So, I think about quite a bit the medical domain,</p>
<p>just because historically, right?</p>
<p>The healthcare domain has had these biases,</p>
<p>typically based on gender and ethnicity, primarily.</p>
<p>A little in age, but not so much.</p>
<p>Historically, if you think about FDA and drug trials,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder to find a woman that aren&rsquo;t childbearing,</p>
<p>and so you may not test on drugs at the same level.</p>
<p>Right, so there&rsquo;s these things.</p>
<p>And so, if you think about robotics, right?</p>
<p>Something as simple as,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to design an exoskeleton, right?</p>
<p>What should the material be?</p>
<p>What should the weight be?</p>
<p>What should the form factor be?</p>
<p>Who are you gonna design it around?</p>
<p>I will say that in the US,</p>
<p>women average height and weight</p>
<p>is slightly different than guys.</p>
<p>So, who are you gonna choose?</p>
<p>Like, if you&rsquo;re not thinking about it from the beginning,</p>
<p>as, okay, when I design this and I look at the algorithms</p>
<p>and I design the control system and the forces</p>
<p>and the torques, if you&rsquo;re not thinking about,</p>
<p>well, you have different types of body structure,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna design to what you&rsquo;re used to.</p>
<p>Oh, this fits all the folks in my lab, right?</p>
<p>So, think about it from the very beginning is important.</p>
<p>What about sort of algorithms that train on data</p>
<p>kind of thing?</p>
<p>Sadly, our society already has a lot of negative bias.</p>
<p>And so, if we collect a lot of data,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a balanced way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to contain the same bias</p>
<p>that our society contains.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, is there things there that bother you?</p>
<p>Yeah, so you actually said something.</p>
<p>You had said how we have biases,</p>
<p>but hopefully we learn from them and we become better, right?</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s where we are now, right?</p>
<p>So, the data that we&rsquo;re collecting is historic.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s based on these things</p>
<p>when we knew it was bad to discriminate,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the data we have and we&rsquo;re trying to fix it now,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re fixing it based on the data</p>
<p>that was used in the first place.</p>
<p>Fix it in post.</p>
<p>Right, and so the decisions,</p>
<p>and you can look at everything from the whole aspect</p>
<p>of predictive policing, criminal recidivism.</p>
<p>There was a recent paper that had the healthcare algorithms,</p>
<p>which had a kind of a sensational titles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not pro sensationalism in titles,</p>
<p>but again, you read it, right?</p>
<p>So, it makes you read it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m like, really?</p>
<p>Like, ugh, you could have.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the topic of the sensationalism?</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s underneath it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, if you could sort of educate me</p>
<p>on what kind of bias creeps into the healthcare space.</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>I mean, you already kind of mentioned.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this one was the headline was</p>
<p>racist AI algorithms.</p>
<p>Okay, like, okay, that&rsquo;s totally a clickbait title.</p>
<p>And so you looked at it and so there was data</p>
<p>that these researchers had collected.</p>
<p>I believe, I wanna say it was either Science or Nature.</p>
<p>It just was just published,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t have a sensational title.</p>
<p>It was like the media.</p>
<p>And so they had looked at demographics,</p>
<p>I believe, between black and white women, right?</p>
<p>And they showed that there was a discrepancy</p>
<p>in the outcomes, right?</p>
<p>And so, and it was tied to ethnicity, tied to race.</p>
<p>The piece that the researchers did</p>
<p>actually went through the whole analysis, but of course.</p>
<p>I mean, the journalists with AI are problematic</p>
<p>across the board, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And so this is a problem, right?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this thing about,</p>
<p>oh, AI, it has all these problems.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing it on historical data</p>
<p>and the outcomes are uneven based on gender</p>
<p>or ethnicity or age.</p>
<p>But I am always saying is like, yes,</p>
<p>we need to do better, right?</p>
<p>We need to do better.</p>
<p>It is our duty to do better.</p>
<p>But the worst AI is still better than us.</p>
<p>Like, you take the best of us</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still worse than the worst AI,</p>
<p>at least in terms of these things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually not discussed, right?</p>
<p>And so I think, and that&rsquo;s why the sensational title, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, so then you can have individuals go like,</p>
<p>oh, we don&rsquo;t need to use this AI.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I want the AI instead of the doctors</p>
<p>that provided that data,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s still better than that, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really important to linger on,</p>
<p>is the idea that this AI is racist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, compared to what?</p>
<p>Sort of, I think we set, unfortunately,</p>
<p>way too high of a bar for AI algorithms.</p>
<p>And in the ethical space where perfect is,</p>
<p>I would argue, probably impossible.</p>
<p>Then if we set the bar of perfection, essentially,</p>
<p>of it has to be perfectly fair, whatever that means,</p>
<p>it means we&rsquo;re setting it up for failure.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really important to say what you just said,</p>
<p>which is, well, it&rsquo;s still better than it is.</p>
<p>And one of the things I think</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t get enough credit for,</p>
<p>just in terms of as developers,</p>
<p>is that you can now poke at it, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s harder to say, is this hospital,</p>
<p>is this city doing something, right?</p>
<p>Until someone brings in a civil case, right?</p>
<p>Well, with AI, it can process through all this data</p>
<p>and say, hey, yes, there was an issue here,</p>
<p>but here it is, we&rsquo;ve identified it,</p>
<p>and then the next step is to fix it.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a nice feedback loop</p>
<p>versus waiting for someone to sue someone else</p>
<p>before it&rsquo;s fixed, right?</p>
<p>And so I think that power,</p>
<p>we need to capitalize on a little bit more, right?</p>
<p>Instead of having the sensational titles,</p>
<p>have the, okay, this is a problem,</p>
<p>and this is how we&rsquo;re fixing it,</p>
<p>and people are putting money to fix it</p>
<p>because we can make it better.</p>
<p>I look at like facial recognition,</p>
<p>how Joy, she basically called out a couple of companies</p>
<p>and said, hey, and most of them were like,</p>
<p>oh, embarrassment, and the next time it had been fixed,</p>
<p>right, it had been fixed better, right?</p>
<p>And then it was like, oh, here&rsquo;s some more issues.</p>
<p>And I think that conversation then moves that needle</p>
<p>to having much more fair and unbiased and ethical aspects,</p>
<p>as long as both sides, the developers are willing to say,</p>
<p>okay, I hear you, yes, we are going to improve,</p>
<p>and you have other developers who are like,</p>
<p>hey, AI, it&rsquo;s wrong, but I love it, right?</p>
<p>Yes, so speaking of this really nice notion</p>
<p>that AI is maybe flawed but better than humans,</p>
<p>so just made me think of it,</p>
<p>one example of flawed humans is our political system.</p>
<p>Do you think, or you said judicial as well,</p>
<p>do you have a hope for AI sort of being elected</p>
<p>for president or running our Congress</p>
<p>or being able to be a powerful representative of the people?</p>
<p>So I mentioned, and I truly believe that this whole world</p>
<p>of AI is in partnerships with people.</p>
<p>And so what does that mean?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe, or maybe I just don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that we should have an AI for president,</p>
<p>but I do believe that a president</p>
<p>should use AI as an advisor, right?</p>
<p>Like, if you think about it,</p>
<p>every president has a cabinet of individuals</p>
<p>that have different expertise</p>
<p>that they should listen to, right?</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s kind of what we do.</p>
<p>And you put smart people with smart expertise</p>
<p>around certain issues, and you listen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why AI can&rsquo;t function</p>
<p>as one of those smart individuals giving input.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s an AI on healthcare,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s an AI on education and right,</p>
<p>like all of these things that a human is processing, right?</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that are human</p>
<p>that are going to be at the end of the decision.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think as a world, as a culture, as a society,</p>
<p>that we would totally, and this is us,</p>
<p>like this is some fallacy about us,</p>
<p>but we need to see that leader, that person as human.</p>
<p>And most people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that like leaders have a whole lot of advice, right?</p>
<p>Like when they say something, it&rsquo;s not that they woke up,</p>
<p>well, usually they don&rsquo;t wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and be like, I have a brilliant idea, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually a, okay, let me listen.</p>
<p>I have a brilliant idea,</p>
<p>but let me get a little bit of feedback on this.</p>
<p>Like, okay.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s a, yeah, that was an awesome idea</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s like, yeah, let me go back.</p>
<p>We already talked through a bunch of them,</p>
<p>but are there some possible solutions</p>
<p>to the bias that&rsquo;s present in our algorithms</p>
<p>beyond what we just talked about?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s two paths.</p>
<p>One is to figure out how to systematically</p>
<p>do the feedback and corrections.</p>
<p>So right now it&rsquo;s ad hoc, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a researcher identify some outcomes</p>
<p>that are not, don&rsquo;t seem to be fair, right?</p>
<p>They publish it, they write about it.</p>
<p>And the, either the developer or the companies</p>
<p>that have adopted the algorithms may try to fix it, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really ad hoc and it&rsquo;s not systematic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a researcher, that seems like an interesting problem,</p>
<p>which means that there&rsquo;s a whole lot out there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not being looked at, right?</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s kind of researcher driven.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t necessarily have a solution,</p>
<p>but that process I think could be done a little bit better.</p>
<p>One way is I&rsquo;m going to poke a little bit</p>
<p>at some of the corporations, right?</p>
<p>Like maybe the corporations when they think</p>
<p>about a product, they should, instead of,</p>
<p>in addition to hiring these, you know, bug,</p>
<p>they give these.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like awards when you find a bug.</p>
<p>Yeah, security bug, you know, let&rsquo;s put it</p>
<p>like we will give the, whatever the award is</p>
<p>that we give for the people who find these security holes,</p>
<p>find an ethics hole, right?</p>
<p>Like find an unfairness hole</p>
<p>and we will pay you X for each one you find.</p>
<p>I mean, why can&rsquo;t they do that?</p>
<p>One is a win win.</p>
<p>They show that they&rsquo;re concerned about it,</p>
<p>that this is important and they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to necessarily dedicate it their own like internal resources.</p>
<p>And it also means that everyone who has</p>
<p>like their own bias lens, like I&rsquo;m interested in age.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll find the ones based on age</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m interested in gender and right,</p>
<p>which means that you get like all</p>
<p>of these different perspectives.</p>
<p>But you think of it in a data driven way.</p>
<p>So like sort of, if we look at a company like Twitter,</p>
<p>it gets, it&rsquo;s under a lot of fire</p>
<p>for discriminating against certain political beliefs.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And sort of, there&rsquo;s a lot of people,</p>
<p>this is the sad thing,</p>
<p>cause I know how hard the problem is</p>
<p>and I know the Twitter folks are working really hard at it.</p>
<p>Even Facebook that everyone seems to hate</p>
<p>are working really hard at this.</p>
<p>You know, the kind of evidence that people bring</p>
<p>is basically anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>Well, me or my friend, all we said is X</p>
<p>and for that we got banned.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of a discussion of saying,</p>
<p>well, look, that&rsquo;s usually, first of all,</p>
<p>the whole thing is taken out of context.</p>
<p>So they present sort of anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>And how are you supposed to, as a company,</p>
<p>in a healthy way, have a discourse</p>
<p>about what is and isn&rsquo;t ethical?</p>
<p>How do we make algorithms ethical</p>
<p>when people are just blowing everything?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re outraged about a particular</p>
<p>anecdotal piece of evidence that&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to sort of contextualize in the big data driven way.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope for companies like Twitter and Facebook?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think there&rsquo;s a couple of things going on, right?</p>
<p>First off, remember this whole aspect</p>
<p>of we are becoming reliant on technology.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also becoming reliant on a lot of these,</p>
<p>the apps and the resources that are provided, right?</p>
<p>So some of it is kind of anger, like I need you, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not working for me, right?</p>
<p>Not working for me, all right.</p>
<p>But I think, and so some of it,</p>
<p>and I wish that there was a little bit</p>
<p>of change of rethinking.</p>
<p>So some of it is like, oh, we&rsquo;ll fix it in house.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s like, okay, I&rsquo;m a fox</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to watch these hens</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s a problem that foxes eat hens.</p>
<p>No, right?</p>
<p>Like be good citizens and say, look, we have a problem.</p>
<p>And we are willing to open ourselves up</p>
<p>for others to come in and look at it</p>
<p>and not try to fix it in house.</p>
<p>Because if you fix it in house,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s conflict of interest.</p>
<p>If I find something, I&rsquo;m probably going to want to fix it</p>
<p>and hopefully the media won&rsquo;t pick it up, right?</p>
<p>And that then causes distrust</p>
<p>because someone inside is going to be mad at you</p>
<p>and go out and talk about how,</p>
<p>yeah, they canned the resume survey because it, right?</p>
<p>Like be nice people.</p>
<p>Like just say, look, we have this issue.</p>
<p>Community, help us fix it.</p>
<p>And we will give you like, you know,</p>
<p>the bug finder fee if you do.</p>
<p>Did you ever hope that the community,</p>
<p>us as a human civilization on the whole is good</p>
<p>and can be trusted to guide the future of our civilization</p>
<p>into a positive direction?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m an optimist, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, there were some dark times in history always.</p>
<p>I think now we&rsquo;re in one of those dark times.</p>
<p>I truly do.</p>
<p>In which aspect?</p>
<p>The polarization.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just US, right?</p>
<p>So if it was just US, I&rsquo;d be like, yeah, it&rsquo;s a US thing,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re seeing it like worldwide, this polarization.</p>
<p>And so I worry about that.</p>
<p>But I do fundamentally believe that at the end of the day,</p>
<p>people are good, right?</p>
<p>And why do I say that?</p>
<p>Because anytime there&rsquo;s a scenario</p>
<p>where people are in danger and I will use,</p>
<p>so Atlanta, we had a snowmageddon</p>
<p>and people can laugh about that.</p>
<p>People at the time, so the city closed for, you know,</p>
<p>little snow, but it was ice and the city closed down.</p>
<p>But you had people opening up their homes and saying,</p>
<p>hey, you have nowhere to go, come to my house, right?</p>
<p>Hotels were just saying like, sleep on the floor.</p>
<p>Like places like, you know, the grocery stores were like,</p>
<p>hey, here&rsquo;s food.</p>
<p>There was no like, oh, how much are you gonna pay me?</p>
<p>It was like this, such a community.</p>
<p>And like people who didn&rsquo;t know each other,</p>
<p>strangers were just like, can I give you a ride home?</p>
<p>And that was a point I was like, you know what, like.</p>
<p>That reveals that the deeper thing is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a compassionate love that we all have within us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that when all of that is taken care of</p>
<p>and get bored, we love drama.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think almost like the division</p>
<p>is a sign of the times being good,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s just entertaining</p>
<p>on some unpleasant mammalian level to watch,</p>
<p>to disagree with others.</p>
<p>And Twitter and Facebook are actually taking advantage</p>
<p>of that in a sense because it brings you back</p>
<p>to the platform and they&rsquo;re advertiser driven,</p>
<p>so they make a lot of money.</p>
<p>So you go back and you click.</p>
<p>Love doesn&rsquo;t sell quite as well in terms of advertisement.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve started your career</p>
<p>at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,</p>
<p>but before I ask a few questions there,</p>
<p>have you happened to have ever seen Space Odyssey,</p>
<p>2001 Space Odyssey?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, do you think HAL 9000,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re talking about ethics.</p>
<p>Do you think HAL did the right thing</p>
<p>by taking the priority of the mission</p>
<p>over the lives of the astronauts?</p>
<p>Do you think HAL is good or evil?</p>
<p>Easy questions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>HAL was misguided.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the people that would be in charge</p>
<p>of an algorithm like HAL.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What would you do better?</p>
<p>If you think about what happened</p>
<p>was there was no fail safe, right?</p>
<p>So perfection, right?</p>
<p>Like what is that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make something that I think is perfect,</p>
<p>but if my assumptions are wrong,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be perfect based on the wrong assumptions, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that you don&rsquo;t know until you deploy</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re like, oh yeah, messed up.</p>
<p>But what that means is that when we design software,</p>
<p>such as in Space Odyssey,</p>
<p>when we put things out,</p>
<p>that there has to be a fail safe.</p>
<p>There has to be the ability that once it&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>we can grade it as an F and it fails</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t continue, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some way that it can be brought in</p>
<p>and removed in that aspect.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what happened with HAL.</p>
<p>It was like assumptions were wrong.</p>
<p>It was perfectly correct based on those assumptions</p>
<p>and there was no way to change it,</p>
<p>change the assumptions at all.</p>
<p>And the change to fall back would be to a human.</p>
<p>So you ultimately think like human should be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not turtles or AI all the way down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at some point, there&rsquo;s a human that actually.</p>
<p>I still think that,</p>
<p>and again, because I do human robot interaction,</p>
<p>I still think the human needs to be part of the equation</p>
<p>at some point.</p>
<p>So what, just looking back,</p>
<p>what are some fascinating things in robotic space</p>
<p>that NASA was working at the time?</p>
<p>Or just in general, what have you gotten to play with</p>
<p>and what are your memories from working at NASA?</p>
<p>Yeah, so one of my first memories</p>
<p>was they were working on a surgical robot system</p>
<p>that could do eye surgery, right?</p>
<p>And this was back in, oh my gosh, it must&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>oh, maybe 92, 93, 94.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like almost like a remote operation.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was remote operation.</p>
<p>In fact, you can even find some old tech reports on it.</p>
<p>So think of it, like now we have DaVinci, right?</p>
<p>Like think of it, but these were like the late 90s, right?</p>
<p>And I remember going into the lab one day</p>
<p>and I was like, what&rsquo;s that, right?</p>
<p>And of course it wasn&rsquo;t pretty, right?</p>
<p>Because the technology, but it was like functional</p>
<p>and you had this individual that could use</p>
<p>a version of haptics to actually do the surgery</p>
<p>and they had this mockup of a human face</p>
<p>and like the eyeballs and you can see this little drill.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, that is so cool.</p>
<p>That one I vividly remember</p>
<p>because it was so outside of my like possible thoughts</p>
<p>of what could be done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the kind of precision</p>
<p>and I mean, what&rsquo;s the most amazing of a thing like that?</p>
<p>I think it was the precision.</p>
<p>It was the kind of first time</p>
<p>that I had physically seen</p>
<p>this robot machine human interface, right?</p>
<p>Versus, cause manufacturing had been,</p>
<p>you saw those kind of big robots, right?</p>
<p>But this was like, oh, this is in a person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a person and a robot like in the same space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m meeting them in person.</p>
<p>Like for me, it was a magical moment</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t, it was life transforming</p>
<p>that I recently met Spot Mini from Boston Dynamics.</p>
<p>Oh, see.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but on the human robot interaction</p>
<p>for some reason I realized how easy it is to anthropomorphize</p>
<p>and it was, I don&rsquo;t know, it was almost</p>
<p>like falling in love, this feeling of meeting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve obviously seen these robots a lot</p>
<p>on video and so on, but meeting in person,</p>
<p>just having that one on one time is different.</p>
<p>So have you had a robot like that in your life</p>
<p>that made you maybe fall in love with robotics?</p>
<p>Sort of like meeting in person.</p>
<p>I mean, I loved robotics since, yeah.</p>
<p>So I was a 12 year old.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna be a roboticist, actually was,</p>
<p>I called it cybernetics.</p>
<p>But so my motivation was Bionic Woman.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know that.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, that was like a seminal moment,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t meet, like that was TV, right?</p>
<p>Like it wasn&rsquo;t like I was in the same space and I met</p>
<p>and I was like, oh my gosh, you&rsquo;re like real.</p>
<p>Just linking on Bionic Woman, which by the way,</p>
<p>because I read that about you.</p>
<p>I watched bits of it and it&rsquo;s just so,</p>
<p>no offense, terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cheesy if you look at it now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cheesy, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of reruns lately.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, but of course at the time it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>captured the imagination.</p>
<p>But the sound effects.</p>
<p>Especially when you&rsquo;re younger, it just catch you.</p>
<p>But which aspect, did you think of it,</p>
<p>you mentioned cybernetics, did you think of it as robotics</p>
<p>or did you think of it as almost constructing</p>
<p>artificial beings?</p>
<p>Like, is it the intelligent part that captured</p>
<p>your fascination or was it the whole thing?</p>
<p>Like even just the limbs and just the.</p>
<p>So for me, it would have, in another world,</p>
<p>I probably would have been more of a biomedical engineer</p>
<p>because what fascinated me was the parts,</p>
<p>like the bionic parts, the limbs, those aspects of it.</p>
<p>Are you especially drawn to humanoid or humanlike robots?</p>
<p>I would say humanlike, not humanoid, right?</p>
<p>And when I say humanlike, I think it&rsquo;s this aspect</p>
<p>of that interaction, whether it&rsquo;s social</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a dog, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s humanlike because it understand us,</p>
<p>it interacts with us at that very social level</p>
<p>to, you know, humanoids are part of that,</p>
<p>but only if they interact with us as if we are human.</p>
<p>Okay, but just to linger on NASA for a little bit,</p>
<p>what do you think, maybe if you have other memories,</p>
<p>but also what do you think is the future of robots in space?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll mention how, but there&rsquo;s incredible robots</p>
<p>that NASA&rsquo;s working on in general thinking about</p>
<p>in our, as we venture out, human civilization ventures out</p>
<p>into space, what do you think the future of robots is there?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, there&rsquo;s the near term.</p>
<p>For example, they just announced the rover</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to the moon, which, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of exciting, but that&rsquo;s like near term.</p>
<p>You know, my favorite, favorite, favorite series</p>
<p>is Star Trek, right?</p>
<p>You know, I really hope, and even Star Trek,</p>
<p>like if I calculate the years, I wouldn&rsquo;t be alive,</p>
<p>but I would really, really love to be in that world.</p>
<p>Like, even if it&rsquo;s just at the beginning,</p>
<p>like, you know, like voyage, like adventure one.</p>
<p>So basically living in space.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With, what robots, what are robots?</p>
<p>With data.</p>
<p>What role?</p>
<p>The data would have to be, even though that wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, that was like later, but.</p>
<p>So data is a robot that has human like qualities.</p>
<p>Right, without the emotion chip.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like emotion.</p>
<p>Well, so data with the emotion chip</p>
<p>was kind of a mess, right?</p>
<p>It took a while for that thing to adapt,</p>
<p>but, and so why was that an issue?</p>
<p>The issue is that emotions make us irrational agents.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>And yet he could think through things,</p>
<p>even if it was based on an emotional scenario, right?</p>
<p>Based on pros and cons.</p>
<p>But as soon as you made him emotional,</p>
<p>one of the metrics he used for evaluation</p>
<p>was his own emotions, not people around him, right?</p>
<p>Like, and so.</p>
<p>We do that as children, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re very egocentric when we&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>We are very egocentric.</p>
<p>And so isn&rsquo;t that just an early version of the emotion chip</p>
<p>then, I haven&rsquo;t watched much Star Trek.</p>
<p>Except I have also met adults, right?</p>
<p>And so that is a developmental process.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a bunch of psychologists</p>
<p>that can go through, like you can have a 60 year old adult</p>
<p>who has the emotional maturity of a 10 year old, right?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s various phases that people should go through</p>
<p>in order to evolve and sometimes you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So how much psychology do you think,</p>
<p>a topic that&rsquo;s rarely mentioned in robotics,</p>
<p>but how much does psychology come to play</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about HRI, human robot interaction?</p>
<p>When you have to have robots</p>
<p>that actually interact with humans.</p>
<p>Tons.</p>
<p>So we, like my group, as well as I read a lot</p>
<p>in the cognitive science literature,</p>
<p>as well as the psychology literature.</p>
<p>Because they understand a lot about human, human relations</p>
<p>and developmental milestones and things like that.</p>
<p>And so we tend to look to see what&rsquo;s been done out there.</p>
<p>Sometimes what we&rsquo;ll do is we&rsquo;ll try to match that to see,</p>
<p>is that human, human relationship the same as human robot?</p>
<p>Sometimes it is, and sometimes it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>And then when it&rsquo;s different, we have to,</p>
<p>we try to figure out, okay,</p>
<p>why is it different in this scenario?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the same in the other scenario, right?</p>
<p>And so we try to do that quite a bit.</p>
<p>Would you say that&rsquo;s, if we&rsquo;re looking at the future</p>
<p>of human robot interaction,</p>
<p>would you say the psychology piece is the hardest?</p>
<p>Like if, I mean, it&rsquo;s a funny notion for you as,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you consider, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, one way to ask it,</p>
<p>do you consider yourself a roboticist or a psychologist?</p>
<p>Oh, I consider myself a roboticist</p>
<p>that plays the act of a psychologist.</p>
<p>But if you were to look at yourself sort of,</p>
<p>20, 30 years from now,</p>
<p>do you see yourself more and more</p>
<p>wearing the psychology hat?</p>
<p>Another way to put it is,</p>
<p>are the hard problems in human robot interactions</p>
<p>fundamentally psychology, or is it still robotics,</p>
<p>the perception manipulation, planning,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually neither.</p>
<p>The hardest part is the adaptation and the interaction.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the interface, it&rsquo;s the learning.</p>
<p>And so if I think of,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve become much more of a roboticist slash AI person</p>
<p>than when I, like originally, again,</p>
<p>I was about the bionics.</p>
<p>I was electrical engineer, I was control theory, right?</p>
<p>And then I started realizing that my algorithms</p>
<p>needed like human data, right?</p>
<p>And so then I was like, okay, what is this human thing?</p>
<p>How do I incorporate human data?</p>
<p>And then I realized that human perception had,</p>
<p>like there was a lot in terms of how we perceive the world.</p>
<p>And so trying to figure out</p>
<p>how do I model human perception for my,</p>
<p>and so I became a HRI person,</p>
<p>human robot interaction person,</p>
<p>from being a control theory and realizing</p>
<p>that humans actually offered quite a bit.</p>
<p>And then when you do that,</p>
<p>you become more of an artificial intelligence, AI.</p>
<p>And so I see myself evolving more in this AI world</p>
<p>under the lens of robotics,</p>
<p>having hardware, interacting with people.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a world class expert researcher in robotics,</p>
<p>and yet others, you know, there&rsquo;s a few,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a small but fierce community of people,</p>
<p>but most of them don&rsquo;t take the journey</p>
<p>into the H of HRI, into the human.</p>
<p>So why did you brave into the interaction with humans?</p>
<p>It seems like a really hard problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard problem, and it&rsquo;s very risky as an academic.</p>
<p>And I knew that when I started down that journey,</p>
<p>that it was very risky as an academic</p>
<p>in this world that was nuance, it was just developing.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t even have a conference, right, at the time.</p>
<p>Because it was the interesting problems.</p>
<p>That was what drove me.</p>
<p>It was the fact that I looked at what interests me</p>
<p>in terms of the application space and the problems.</p>
<p>And that pushed me into trying to figure out</p>
<p>what people were and what humans were</p>
<p>and how to adapt to them.</p>
<p>If those problems weren&rsquo;t so interesting,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably still be sending rovers to glaciers, right?</p>
<p>But the problems were interesting.</p>
<p>And the other thing was that they were hard, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I like having to go into a room</p>
<p>and being like, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>And then going back and saying, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna figure this out.</p>
<p>I do not, I&rsquo;m not driven when I go in like,</p>
<p>oh, there are no surprises.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t find that satisfying.</p>
<p>If that was the case,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go someplace and make a lot more money, right?</p>
<p>I think I stay in academic because and choose to do this</p>
<p>because I can go into a room and like, that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think just from my perspective,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me on it,</p>
<p>but if I just look at the field of AI broadly,</p>
<p>it seems that human robot interaction has the most,</p>
<p>one of the most number of open problems.</p>
<p>Like people, especially relative to how many people</p>
<p>are willing to acknowledge that there are this,</p>
<p>because most people are just afraid of the humans</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t even acknowledge</p>
<p>how many open problems there are.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in terms of difficult problems</p>
<p>to solve exciting spaces,</p>
<p>it seems to be incredible for that.</p>
<p>It is, and it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned trust before.</p>
<p>What role does trust from interacting with autopilot</p>
<p>to in the medical context,</p>
<p>what role does trust play in the human robot interactions?</p>
<p>So some of the things I study in this domain</p>
<p>is not just trust, but it really is over trust.</p>
<p>How do you think about over trust?</p>
<p>Like what is, first of all, what is trust</p>
<p>and what is over trust?</p>
<p>Basically, the way I look at it is,</p>
<p>trust is not what you click on a survey,</p>
<p>trust is about your behavior.</p>
<p>So if you interact with the technology</p>
<p>based on the decision or the actions of the technology</p>
<p>as if you trust that decision, then you&rsquo;re trusting.</p>
<p>And even in my group, we&rsquo;ve done surveys</p>
<p>that on the thing, do you trust robots?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>Would you follow this robot in a burdening building?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>And then you look at their actions and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>clearly your behavior does not match what you think</p>
<p>or what you think you would like to think.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m really concerned about the behavior</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really at the end of the day,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the world,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what will impact others around you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not whether before you went onto the street,</p>
<p>you clicked on like, I don&rsquo;t trust self driving cars.</p>
<p>Yeah, that from an outsider perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always frustrating to me.</p>
<p>Well, I read a lot, so I&rsquo;m insider</p>
<p>in a certain philosophical sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating to me how often trust is used in surveys</p>
<p>and how people say, make claims out of any kind of finding</p>
<p>they make while somebody clicking on answer.</p>
<p>You just trust is a, yeah, behavior just,</p>
<p>you said it beautifully.</p>
<p>I mean, the action, your own behavior is what trust is.</p>
<p>I mean, that everything else is not even close.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like absurd comedic poetry</p>
<p>that you weave around your actual behavior.</p>
<p>So some people can say their trust,</p>
<p>you know, I trust my wife, husband or not,</p>
<p>whatever, but the actions is what speaks volumes.</p>
<p>You bug their car, you probably don&rsquo;t trust them.</p>
<p>I trust them, I&rsquo;m just making sure.</p>
<p>No, no, that&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>Like even if you think about cars,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful case.</p>
<p>I came here at some point, I&rsquo;m sure,</p>
<p>on either Uber or Lyft, right?</p>
<p>I remember when it first came out, right?</p>
<p>I bet if they had had a survey,</p>
<p>would you get in the car with a stranger and pay them?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>How many people do you think would have said,</p>
<p>like, really?</p>
<p>Wait, even worse, would you get in the car</p>
<p>with a stranger at 1 a.m. in the morning</p>
<p>to have them drop you home as a single female?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like how many people would say, that&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And now look at where we are.</p>
<p>I mean, people put kids, right?</p>
<p>Like, oh yeah, my child has to go to school</p>
<p>and yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna put my kid in this car with a stranger.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just fascinating how, like,</p>
<p>what we think we think is not necessarily</p>
<p>matching our behavior.</p>
<p>Yeah, and certainly with robots, with autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>and all the kinds of robots you work with,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s, the way you answer it,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;ve never interacted with that robot before,</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t had the experience,</p>
<p>you being able to respond correctly on a survey is impossible.</p>
<p>But what do you, what role does trust play</p>
<p>in the interaction, do you think?</p>
<p>Like, is it good to, is it good to trust a robot?</p>
<p>What does over trust mean?</p>
<p>Or is it, is it good to kind of how you feel</p>
<p>about autopilot currently, which is like,</p>
<p>from a roboticist&rsquo;s perspective, is like,</p>
<p>oh, still very cautious?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is still an open area of research,</p>
<p>but basically what I would like in a perfect world</p>
<p>is that people trust the technology when it&rsquo;s working 100%,</p>
<p>and people will be hypersensitive</p>
<p>and identify when it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>But of course we&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ideal world.</p>
<p>And, but we find is that people swing, right?</p>
<p>They tend to swing, which means that if my first,</p>
<p>and like, we have some papers,</p>
<p>like first impressions is everything, right?</p>
<p>If my first instance with technology,</p>
<p>with robotics is positive, it mitigates any risk,</p>
<p>it correlates with like best outcomes,</p>
<p>it means that I&rsquo;m more likely to either not see it</p>
<p>when it makes some mistakes or faults,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m more likely to forgive it.</p>
<p>And so this is a problem</p>
<p>because technology is not 100% accurate, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 100% accurate, although it may be perfect.</p>
<p>How do you get that first moment right, do you think?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an education about the capabilities</p>
<p>and limitations of the system.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of how do you educate people correctly</p>
<p>in that first interaction?</p>
<p>Again, this is an open ended problem.</p>
<p>So one of the study that actually has given me some hope</p>
<p>that I were trying to figure out how to put in robotics.</p>
<p>So there was a research study</p>
<p>that it showed for medical AI systems,</p>
<p>giving information to radiologists about,</p>
<p>here you need to look at these areas on the X ray.</p>
<p>What they found was that when the system provided</p>
<p>one choice, there was this aspect of either no trust</p>
<p>or over trust, right?</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t believe it at all,</p>
<p>or a yes, yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>And they would miss things, right?</p>
<p>Instead, when the system gave them multiple choices,</p>
<p>like here are the three, even if it knew like,</p>
<p>it had estimated that the top area you need to look at</p>
<p>was some place on the X ray.</p>
<p>If it gave like one plus others,</p>
<p>the trust was maintained and the accuracy of the entire</p>
<p>population increased, right?</p>
<p>So basically it was a, you&rsquo;re still trusting the system,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also putting in a little bit of like,</p>
<p>your human expertise, like your human decision processing</p>
<p>into the equation.</p>
<p>So it helps to mitigate that over trust risk.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s a fascinating balance that the strike.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t figured out again, robotics is still an open research.</p>
<p>This is exciting open area research, exactly.</p>
<p>So what are some exciting applications</p>
<p>of human robot interaction?</p>
<p>You started a company, maybe you can talk about</p>
<p>the exciting efforts there, but in general also</p>
<p>what other space can robots interact with humans and help?</p>
<p>Yeah, so besides healthcare,</p>
<p>cause you know, that&rsquo;s my bias lens.</p>
<p>My other bias lens is education.</p>
<p>I think that, well, one, we definitely,</p>
<p>we in the US, you know, we&rsquo;re doing okay with teachers,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of school districts</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have enough teachers.</p>
<p>If you think about the teacher student ratio</p>
<p>for at least public education in some districts, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how can you have learning in that classroom,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Because you just don&rsquo;t have the human capital.</p>
<p>And so if you think about robotics,</p>
<p>bringing that in to classrooms,</p>
<p>as well as the afterschool space,</p>
<p>where they offset some of this lack of resources</p>
<p>in certain communities, I think that&rsquo;s a good place.</p>
<p>And then turning on the other end</p>
<p>is using these systems then for workforce retraining</p>
<p>and dealing with some of the things</p>
<p>that are going to come out later on of job loss,</p>
<p>like thinking about robots and in AI systems</p>
<p>for retraining and workforce development.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s exciting areas that can be pushed even more,</p>
<p>and it would have a huge, huge impact.</p>
<p>What would you say are some of the open problems</p>
<p>in education, sort of, it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>So young kids and the older folks</p>
<p>or just folks of all ages who need to be retrained,</p>
<p>who need to sort of open themselves up</p>
<p>to a whole nother area of work.</p>
<p>What are the problems to be solved there?</p>
<p>How do you think robots can help?</p>
<p>We have the engagement aspect, right?</p>
<p>So we can figure out the engagement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a&hellip;</p>
<p>What do you mean by engagement?</p>
<p>So identifying whether a person is focused,</p>
<p>is like that we can figure out.</p>
<p>What we can figure out and there&rsquo;s some positive results</p>
<p>in this is that personalized adaptation</p>
<p>based on any concepts, right?</p>
<p>So imagine I think about, I have an agent</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m working with a kid learning, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>algebra two, can that same agent then switch</p>
<p>and teach some type of new coding skill</p>
<p>to a displaced mechanic?</p>
<p>Like, what does that actually look like, right?</p>
<p>Like hardware might be the same, content is different,</p>
<p>two different target demographics of engagement.</p>
<p>Like how do you do that?</p>
<p>How important do you think personalization</p>
<p>is in human robot interaction?</p>
<p>And not just a mechanic or student,</p>
<p>but like literally to the individual human being.</p>
<p>I think personalization is really important,</p>
<p>but a caveat is that I think we&rsquo;d be okay</p>
<p>if we can personalize to the group, right?</p>
<p>And so if I can label you</p>
<p>as along some certain dimensions,</p>
<p>then even though it may not be you specifically,</p>
<p>I can put you in this group.</p>
<p>So the sample size, this is how they best learn,</p>
<p>this is how they best engage.</p>
<p>Even at that level, it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because, I mean, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>why educating in large classrooms is so hard, right?</p>
<p>You teach to the median,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s these individuals that are struggling</p>
<p>and then you have highly intelligent individuals</p>
<p>and those are the ones that are usually kind of left out.</p>
<p>So highly intelligent individuals may be disruptive</p>
<p>and those who are struggling might be disruptive</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re both bored.</p>
<p>Yeah, and if you narrow the definition of the group</p>
<p>or in the size of the group enough,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to address their individual,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not individual needs, but really the most important</p>
<p>group needs, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of what a lot of successful</p>
<p>recommender systems do with Spotify and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sad to believe, but as a music listener,</p>
<p>probably in some sort of large group,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very sadly predictable.</p>
<p>You have been labeled.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been labeled and successfully so</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re able to recommend stuff that I like.</p>
<p>Yeah, but applying that to education, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why it can&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope for our education system?</p>
<p>I have more hope for workforce development.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m seeing investments.</p>
<p>Even if you look at VC investments in education,</p>
<p>the majority of it has lately been going</p>
<p>to workforce retraining, right?</p>
<p>And so I think that government investments is increasing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a claim and some of it&rsquo;s based on fear, right?</p>
<p>Like AI is gonna come and take over all these jobs.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do with all these nonpaying taxes</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t coming to us by our citizens?</p>
<p>And so I think I&rsquo;m more hopeful for that.</p>
<p>Not so hopeful for early education</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s still a who&rsquo;s gonna pay for it.</p>
<p>And you won&rsquo;t see the results for like 16 to 18 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for people to wrap their heads around that.</p>
<p>But on the retraining part, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a candidate, Andrew Yang running for president</p>
<p>and saying that sort of AI, automation, robots.</p>
<p>Universal basic income.</p>
<p>Universal basic income in order to support us</p>
<p>as we kind of automation takes people&rsquo;s jobs</p>
<p>and allows you to explore and find other means.</p>
<p>Like do you have a concern of society</p>
<p>transforming effects of automation and robots and so on?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I do know that AI robotics will displace workers.</p>
<p>Like we do know that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;ll be other workers</p>
<p>that will be defined new jobs.</p>
<p>What I worry about is, that&rsquo;s not what I worry about.</p>
<p>Like will all the jobs go away?</p>
<p>What I worry about is the type of jobs that will come out.</p>
<p>Like people who graduate from Georgia Tech will be okay.</p>
<p>We give them the skills,</p>
<p>they will adapt even if their current job goes away.</p>
<p>I do worry about those</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have that quality of an education.</p>
<p>Will they have the ability,</p>
<p>the background to adapt to those new jobs?</p>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That I worry about,</p>
<p>which will create even more polarization</p>
<p>in our society, internationally and everywhere.</p>
<p>I worry about that.</p>
<p>I also worry about not having equal access</p>
<p>to all these wonderful things that AI can do</p>
<p>and robotics can do.</p>
<p>I worry about that.</p>
<p>People like me from Georgia Tech from say MIT</p>
<p>will be okay, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s such a small part of the population</p>
<p>that we need to think much more globally</p>
<p>of having access to the beautiful things,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s AI in healthcare, AI in education,</p>
<p>AI in politics, right?</p>
<p>I worry about that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the thing that you were talking about</p>
<p>is people that build the technology</p>
<p>have to be thinking about ethics,</p>
<p>have to be thinking about access and all those things.</p>
<p>And not just a small subset.</p>
<p>Let me ask some philosophical,</p>
<p>slightly romantic questions.</p>
<p>People that listen to this will be like,</p>
<p>here he goes again.</p>
<p>Okay, do you think one day we&rsquo;ll build an AI system</p>
<p>that a person can fall in love with</p>
<p>and it would love them back?</p>
<p>Like in the movie, Her, for example.</p>
<p>Yeah, although she kind of didn&rsquo;t fall in love with him</p>
<p>or she fell in love with like a million other people,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the jealous type, I see.</p>
<p>We humans are the jealous type.</p>
<p>Yes, so I do believe that we can design systems</p>
<p>where people would fall in love with their robot,</p>
<p>with their AI partner.</p>
<p>That I do believe.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t like to use the word manipulate,</p>
<p>but as we see, there are certain individuals</p>
<p>that can be manipulated</p>
<p>if you understand the cognitive science about it, right?</p>
<p>Right, so I mean, if you could think of all close</p>
<p>relationship and love in general</p>
<p>as a kind of mutual manipulation,</p>
<p>that dance, the human dance.</p>
<p>I mean, manipulation is a negative connotation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t like to use that word particularly.</p>
<p>I guess another way to phrase it is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting at is it could be algorithmatized</p>
<p>or something, it could be a.</p>
<p>The relationship building part can be.</p>
<p>I mean, just think about it.</p>
<p>We have, and I don&rsquo;t use dating sites,</p>
<p>but from what I heard, there are some individuals</p>
<p>that have been dating that have never saw each other, right?</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a show I think</p>
<p>that tries to like weed out fake people.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a show that comes out, right?</p>
<p>Because like people start faking.</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the difference of that person</p>
<p>on the other end being an AI agent, right?</p>
<p>And having a communication</p>
<p>and you building a relationship remotely,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s no reason why that can&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>In terms of human robot interaction,</p>
<p>so what role, you&rsquo;ve kind of mentioned</p>
<p>with data emotion being, can be problematic</p>
<p>if not implemented well, I suppose.</p>
<p>What role does emotion and some other human like things,</p>
<p>the imperfect things come into play here</p>
<p>for good human robot interaction and something like love?</p>
<p>Yeah, so in this case, and you had asked,</p>
<p>can an AI agent love a human back?</p>
<p>I think they can emulate love back, right?</p>
<p>And so what does that actually mean?</p>
<p>It just means that if you think about their programming,</p>
<p>they might put the other person&rsquo;s needs</p>
<p>in front of theirs in certain situations, right?</p>
<p>You look at, think about it as a return on investment.</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s my return on investment?</p>
<p>As part of that equation, that person&rsquo;s happiness,</p>
<p>has some type of algorithm waiting to it.</p>
<p>And the reason why is because I care about them, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only reason, right?</p>
<p>But if I care about them and I show that,</p>
<p>then my final objective function</p>
<p>is length of time of the engagement, right?</p>
<p>So you can think of how to do this actually quite easily.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not love?</p>
<p>Well, so that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I think it emulates love</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t have a classical definition of love.</p>
<p>Right, but, and we don&rsquo;t have the ability</p>
<p>to look into each other&rsquo;s minds to see the algorithm.</p>
<p>And I mean, I guess what I&rsquo;m getting at is,</p>
<p>is it possible that, especially if that&rsquo;s learned,</p>
<p>especially if there&rsquo;s some mystery</p>
<p>and black box nature to the system,</p>
<p>how is that, you know?</p>
<p>How is it any different?</p>
<p>How is it any different in terms of sort of</p>
<p>if the system says, I&rsquo;m conscious, I&rsquo;m afraid of death,</p>
<p>and it does indicate that it loves you.</p>
<p>Another way to sort of phrase it,</p>
<p>be curious to see what you think.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;ll be a time</p>
<p>when robots should have rights?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve kind of phrased the robot in a very roboticist way</p>
<p>and just a really good way, but saying, okay,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s an objective function</p>
<p>and I could see how you can create</p>
<p>a compelling human robot interaction experience</p>
<p>that makes you believe that the robot cares for your needs</p>
<p>and even something like loves you.</p>
<p>But what if the robot says, please don&rsquo;t turn me off?</p>
<p>What if the robot starts making you feel</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s an entity, a being, a soul there, right?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;ll be a future,</p>
<p>hopefully you won&rsquo;t laugh too much at this,</p>
<p>but where they do ask for rights?</p>
<p>So I can see a future</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t address it in the near term</p>
<p>where these agents, as they adapt and learn,</p>
<p>could say, hey, this should be something that&rsquo;s fundamental.</p>
<p>I hopefully think that we would address it</p>
<p>before it gets to that point.</p>
<p>So you think that&rsquo;s a bad future?</p>
<p>Is that a negative thing where they ask</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re being discriminated against?</p>
<p>I guess it depends on what role</p>
<p>have they attained at that point, right?</p>
<p>And so if I think about now.</p>
<p>Careful what you say because the robots 50 years from now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be listening to this and you&rsquo;ll be on TV saying,</p>
<p>this is what roboticists used to believe.</p>
<p>Well, right?</p>
<p>And so this is my, and as I said, I have a bias lens</p>
<p>and my robot friends will understand that.</p>
<p>So if you think about it, and I actually put this</p>
<p>in kind of the, as a roboticist,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t necessarily think of robots as human</p>
<p>with human rights, but you could think of them</p>
<p>either in the category of property,</p>
<p>or you can think of them in the category of animals, right?</p>
<p>And so both of those have different types of rights.</p>
<p>So animals have their own rights as a living being,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t vote, they can&rsquo;t write,</p>
<p>they can be euthanized, but as humans,</p>
<p>if we abuse them, we go to jail, right?</p>
<p>So they do have some rights that protect them,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t give them the rights of like citizenship.</p>
<p>And then if you think about property,</p>
<p>property, the rights are associated with the person, right?</p>
<p>So if someone vandalizes your property</p>
<p>or steals your property, like there are some rights,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s associated with the person who owns that.</p>
<p>If you think about it back in the day,</p>
<p>and if you remember, we talked about</p>
<p>how society has changed, women were property, right?</p>
<p>They were not thought of as having rights.</p>
<p>They were thought of as property of, like their&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, assaulting a woman meant</p>
<p>assaulting the property of somebody else.</p>
<p>Exactly, and so what I envision is,</p>
<p>is that we will establish some type of norm at some point,</p>
<p>but that it might evolve, right?</p>
<p>Like if you look at women&rsquo;s rights now,</p>
<p>like there are still some countries that don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>and the rest of the world is like,</p>
<p>why that makes no sense, right?</p>
<p>And so I do see a world where we do establish</p>
<p>some type of grounding.</p>
<p>It might be based on property rights,</p>
<p>it might be based on animal rights.</p>
<p>And if it evolves that way,</p>
<p>I think we will have this conversation at that time,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the way our society traditionally has evolved.</p>
<p>Beautifully put, just out of curiosity,</p>
<p>Anki, Jibo, Mayflower Robotics,</p>
<p>with their robot Curie, SciFiWorks, WeThink Robotics,</p>
<p>were all these amazing robotics companies</p>
<p>led, created by incredible roboticists,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve all went out of business recently.</p>
<p>Why do you think they didn&rsquo;t last long?</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to run a robotics company,</p>
<p>especially one like these, which are fundamentally</p>
<p>HRI human robot interaction robots?</p>
<p>Or personal robots?</p>
<p>Each one has a story,</p>
<p>only one of them I don&rsquo;t understand, and that was Anki.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually the only one I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand it either.</p>
<p>No, no, I mean, I look like from the outside,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at their sheets, I&rsquo;ve looked at the data that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean like business wise,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t understand, I got you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and like I look at all, I look at that data,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, they seem to have like product market fit.</p>
<p>Like, so that&rsquo;s the only one I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>The rest of it was product market fit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s product market fit?</p>
<p>Just that of, like how do you think about it?</p>
<p>Yeah, so although WeThink Robotics was getting there, right?</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s just the timing,</p>
<p>it just, their clock just timed out.</p>
<p>I think if they&rsquo;d been given a couple more years,</p>
<p>they would have been okay.</p>
<p>But the other ones were still fairly early</p>
<p>by the time they got into the market.</p>
<p>And so product market fit is,</p>
<p>I have a product that I wanna sell at a certain price.</p>
<p>Are there enough people out there, the market,</p>
<p>that are willing to buy the product at that market price</p>
<p>for me to be a functional viable profit bearing company?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So product market fit.</p>
<p>If it costs you a thousand dollars</p>
<p>and everyone wants it and only is willing to pay a dollar,</p>
<p>you have no product market fit.</p>
<p>Even if you could sell it for, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s enough for a dollar, cause you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So how hard is it for robots?</p>
<p>Sort of maybe if you look at iRobot,</p>
<p>the company that makes Roombas, vacuum cleaners,</p>
<p>can you comment on, did they find the right product,</p>
<p>market product fit?</p>
<p>Like, are people willing to pay for robots</p>
<p>is also another kind of question underlying all this.</p>
<p>So if you think about iRobot and their story, right?</p>
<p>Like when they first, they had enough of a runway, right?</p>
<p>When they first started,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t doing vacuum cleaners, right?</p>
<p>They were contracts primarily, government contracts,</p>
<p>designing robots.</p>
<p>Or military robots.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s what they were.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they started, right?</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>They still do a lot of incredible work there.</p>
<p>But yeah, that was the initial thing</p>
<p>that gave them enough funding to.</p>
<p>To then try to, the vacuum cleaner is what I&rsquo;ve been told</p>
<p>was not like their first rendezvous</p>
<p>in terms of designing a product, right?</p>
<p>And so they were able to survive</p>
<p>until they got to the point</p>
<p>that they found a product price market, right?</p>
<p>And even with, if you look at the Roomba,</p>
<p>the price point now is different</p>
<p>than when it was first released, right?</p>
<p>It was an early adopter price,</p>
<p>but they found enough people</p>
<p>who were willing to fund it.</p>
<p>And I mean, I forgot what their loss profile was</p>
<p>for the first couple of years,</p>
<p>but they became profitable in sufficient time</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t have to close their doors.</p>
<p>So they found the right,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still people willing to pay</p>
<p>a large amount of money,</p>
<p>so over $1,000 for a vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them,</p>
<p>now that they&rsquo;ve proved everything out,</p>
<p>figured it all out,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s competitors.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so that&rsquo;s the next thing, right?</p>
<p>The competition,</p>
<p>and they have quite a number, even internationally.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s some products out there,</p>
<p>you can go to Europe and be like,</p>
<p>oh, I didn&rsquo;t even know this one existed.</p>
<p>So this is the thing though,</p>
<p>like with any market,</p>
<p>I would, this is not a bad time,</p>
<p>although as a roboticist, it&rsquo;s kind of depressing,</p>
<p>but I actually think about things like with,</p>
<p>I would say that all of the companies</p>
<p>that are now in the top five or six,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t the first to the stage, right?</p>
<p>Like Google was not the first search engine,</p>
<p>sorry, Altavista, right?</p>
<p>Facebook was not the first, sorry, MySpace, right?</p>
<p>Like think about it,</p>
<p>they were not the first players.</p>
<p>Those first players,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re not in the top five, 10 of Fortune 500 companies,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>They proved, they started to prove out the market,</p>
<p>they started to get people interested,</p>
<p>they started the buzz,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t make it to that next level.</p>
<p>But the second batch, right?</p>
<p>The second batch, I think might make it to the next level.</p>
<p>When do you think the Facebook of robotics?</p>
<p>The Facebook of robotics.</p>
<p>Sorry, I take that phrase back because people deeply,</p>
<p>for some reason, well, I know why,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, I think, exaggerated distrust Facebook</p>
<p>because of the privacy concerns and so on.</p>
<p>And with robotics, one of the things you have to make sure</p>
<p>is all the things we talked about is to be transparent</p>
<p>and have people deeply trust you</p>
<p>to let a robot into their lives, into their home.</p>
<p>When do you think the second batch of robots will come?</p>
<p>Is it five, 10 years, 20 years</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll have robots in our homes</p>
<p>and robots in our hearts?</p>
<p>So if I think about, and because I try to follow</p>
<p>the VC kind of space in terms of robotic investments,</p>
<p>and right now, and I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re gonna be successful,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is the second batch,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s only one batch that&rsquo;s focused</p>
<p>on like the first batch, right?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s all these self driving Xs, right?</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re a first batch of something</p>
<p>or if like, I don&rsquo;t know quite where they fit in,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a number of companies,</p>
<p>the co robot, I call them co robots</p>
<p>that are still getting VC investments.</p>
<p>Some of them have some of the flavor</p>
<p>of like Rethink Robotics.</p>
<p>Some of them have some of the flavor of like Curie.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a co robot?</p>
<p>So basically a robot and human working in the same space.</p>
<p>So some of the companies are focused on manufacturing.</p>
<p>So having a robot and human working together</p>
<p>in a factory, some of these co robots</p>
<p>are robots and humans working in the home,</p>
<p>working in clinics, like there&rsquo;s different versions</p>
<p>of these companies in terms of their products,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all, so we think robotics would be</p>
<p>like one of the first, at least well known companies</p>
<p>focused on this space.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if this is a second batch</p>
<p>or if this is still part of the first batch,</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And then you have all these other companies</p>
<p>in this self driving space.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a first batch</p>
<p>or again, a second batch.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of mystery about this now.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s hard to say that this is the second batch</p>
<p>until it proves out, right?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Yeah, we need a unicorn.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Why do you think people are so afraid,</p>
<p>at least in popular culture of legged robots</p>
<p>like those worked in Boston Dynamics</p>
<p>or just robotics in general,</p>
<p>if you were to psychoanalyze that fear,</p>
<p>what do you make of it?</p>
<p>And should they be afraid, sorry?</p>
<p>So should people be afraid?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people should be afraid.</p>
<p>But with a caveat, I don&rsquo;t think people should be afraid</p>
<p>given that most of us in this world</p>
<p>understand that we need to change something, right?</p>
<p>So given that.</p>
<p>Now, if things don&rsquo;t change, be very afraid.</p>
<p>Which is the dimension of change that&rsquo;s needed?</p>
<p>So changing, thinking about the ramifications,</p>
<p>thinking about like the ethics,</p>
<p>thinking about like the conversation is going on, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer a we&rsquo;re gonna deploy it</p>
<p>and forget that this is a car that can kill pedestrians</p>
<p>that are walking across the street, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not in that stage.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re putting these roads out.</p>
<p>There are people out there.</p>
<p>A car could be a weapon.</p>
<p>Like people are now, solutions aren&rsquo;t there yet,</p>
<p>but people are thinking about this</p>
<p>as we need to be ethically responsible</p>
<p>as we send these systems out,</p>
<p>robotics, medical, self driving.</p>
<p>And military too.</p>
<p>And military.</p>
<p>Which is not as often talked about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really where probably these robots</p>
<p>will have a significant impact as well.</p>
<p>Correct, correct.</p>
<p>Right, making sure that they can think rationally,</p>
<p>even having the conversations,</p>
<p>who should pull the trigger, right?</p>
<p>But overall you&rsquo;re saying if we start to think</p>
<p>more and more as a community about these ethical issues,</p>
<p>people should not be afraid.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think people should be afraid.</p>
<p>I think that the return on investment,</p>
<p>the impact, positive impact will outweigh</p>
<p>any of the potentially negative impacts.</p>
<p>Do you have worries of existential threats</p>
<p>of robots or AI that some people kind of talk about</p>
<p>and romanticize about in the next decade,</p>
<p>the next few decades?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Singularity would be an example.</p>
<p>So my concept is that, so remember,</p>
<p>robots, AI, is designed by people.</p>
<p>It has our values.</p>
<p>And I always correlate this with a parent and a child.</p>
<p>So think about it, as a parent, what do we want?</p>
<p>We want our kids to have a better life than us.</p>
<p>We want them to expand.</p>
<p>We want them to experience the world.</p>
<p>And then as we grow older, our kids think and know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re smarter and better and more intelligent</p>
<p>and have better opportunities.</p>
<p>And they may even stop listening to us.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t go out and then kill us, right?</p>
<p>Like, think about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because we, it&rsquo;s instilled in them values.</p>
<p>We instilled in them this whole aspect of community.</p>
<p>And yes, even though you&rsquo;re maybe smarter</p>
<p>and have more money and dah, dah, dah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still about this love, caring relationship.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what I believe.</p>
<p>So even if like, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve created the singularity in some archaic system</p>
<p>back in like 1980 that suddenly evolves,</p>
<p>the fact is it might say, I am smarter, I am sentient.</p>
<p>These humans are really stupid,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;ll be like, yeah,</p>
<p>but I just can&rsquo;t destroy them.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sentimental value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still just to come back for Thanksgiving dinner</p>
<p>every once in a while.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such, that&rsquo;s so beautifully put.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also said that The Matrix may be</p>
<p>one of your more favorite AI related movies.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate why?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is one of my favorite movies.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because it represents</p>
<p>kind of all the things I think about.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a symbiotic relationship</p>
<p>between robots and humans, right?</p>
<p>That symbiotic relationship is that they don&rsquo;t destroy us,</p>
<p>they enslave us, right?</p>
<p>But think about it,</p>
<p>even though they enslaved us,</p>
<p>they needed us to be happy, right?</p>
<p>And in order to be happy,</p>
<p>they had to create this cruddy world</p>
<p>that they then had to live in, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole premise.</p>
<p>But then there were humans that had a choice, right?</p>
<p>Like you had a choice to stay in this horrific,</p>
<p>horrific world where it was your fantasy life</p>
<p>with all of the anomalies, perfection, but not accurate.</p>
<p>Or you can choose to be on your own</p>
<p>and like have maybe no food for a couple of days,</p>
<p>but you were totally autonomous.</p>
<p>And so I think of that as, and that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not necessarily us being enslaved,</p>
<p>but I think about us having the symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>Robots and AI, even if they become sentient,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still part of our society</p>
<p>and they will suffer just as much as we.</p>
<p>And there will be some kind of equilibrium</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll have to find some symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>Right, and then you have the ethicists,</p>
<p>the robotics folks that are like,</p>
<p>no, this has got to stop, I will take the other pill</p>
<p>in order to make a difference.</p>
<p>So if you could hang out for a day with a robot,</p>
<p>real or from science fiction, movies, books, safely,</p>
<p>and get to pick his or her, their brain,</p>
<p>who would you pick?</p>
<p>Gotta say it&rsquo;s Data.</p>
<p>Data.</p>
<p>I was gonna say Rosie,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not really interested in her brain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in Data&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>Data pre or post emotion chip?</p>
<p>Pre.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;d be a more interesting conversation</p>
<p>post emotion chip?</p>
<p>Yeah, it would be drama.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m human, I deal with drama all the time.</p>
<p>But the reason why I wanna pick Data&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>is because I could have a conversation with him</p>
<p>and ask, for example, how can we fix this ethics problem?</p>
<p>And he could go through like the rational thinking</p>
<p>and through that, he could also help me</p>
<p>think through it as well.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s like these fundamental questions</p>
<p>I think I could ask him</p>
