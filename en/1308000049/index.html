    <p>So we have Balaji here. And obviously, Balaji is an expert</p>
<p>in everything. But Balaji, you&rsquo;re used to being</p>
<p>interviewed. One on one. I&rsquo;ve had you on my podcast a couple</p>
<p>years ago, we had some major great discussions. You&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>on a bunch of other people&rsquo;s but today we&rsquo;ll see how you do on on</p>
<p>the squad here with five people passing the ball. You&rsquo;ve listened</p>
<p>to the pod before.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll pass. So 20% each or whatever. It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Okay, perfect. Well, we will have all in stats. We&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>trying to get 20% with this moderator. This says the guy who</p>
<p>has the largest percentage.</p>
<p>Look, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re supposed to be a non shooting point guard,</p>
<p>Jason. Nobody wants to see you brick three pointer after three</p>
<p>pointer. Just bring the ball down the court and pass it just</p>
<p>pass the ball.</p>
<p>Just pass it out of the way, Jason.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s coming from the guy who has 24% of airtime David Sachs.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. I fit exactly what I&rsquo;m supposed to be doing,</p>
<p>which is one quarter. It&rsquo;s statistically proven.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the all in</p>
<p>podcast with us again this week. Chamath Palihapitiya, the</p>
<p>dictator in just a great sweater. And David Friedberg,</p>
<p>you should touch this, you have no idea the material that is</p>
<p>made from it&rsquo;s made from like the, the chin hair of like a</p>
<p>baby goat, baby goat, that&rsquo;s then really locked by a Tibetan</p>
<p>Sherpa, who literally is forced to use lotion and camphor to</p>
<p>keep their hands soft so that they don&rsquo;t disturb the innate</p>
<p>properties of the thread.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing and available right now two for one at Kmart 1495.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going based on the aesthetics of the look. David</p>
<p>Friedberg is back the queen of quinoa recently having his</p>
<p>office hit by a skunk. Are you okay, David? Are you gonna be</p>
<p>okay for the show?</p>
<p>Be alright, just getting getting used to the condition.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re on. You&rsquo;re on Benadryl. And you did you get</p>
<p>hit by the skunk or just your office got hit by the skunk?</p>
<p>Well, my windows were open. Apparently it&rsquo;s baby skunk</p>
<p>season here in Northern California. So there were some</p>
<p>baby skunks playing around.</p>
<p>God, sorry, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not your returns.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Way too soon. And let&rsquo;s move on from definitely too soon. And</p>
<p>from a nondescript motel eight somewhere in Texas, in Texas,</p>
<p>Texas. David Sachs, a coastal elite in Texas.</p>
<p>On mute. You&rsquo;re on mute, David. We&rsquo;re this is episode 48. You</p>
<p>can Yeah, I happen to be in Texas. That&rsquo;s correct. I had</p>
<p>happens to be a tax free state. No coincidence.</p>
<p>happens to be a state where you can carry a gun now. Yeah,</p>
<p>exactly. And women are no longer allowed to make decisions for</p>
<p>their own body. So two out of three ain&rsquo;t bad. What a great</p>
<p>place to live. Ridiculous. David, are you considering</p>
<p>moving to the great state of Texas?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m open to the possibility. Let&rsquo;s just say I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>open to it. You&rsquo;re open to it. But I you know, I recently ran a</p>
<p>Twitter survey where I asked Miami or Austin and Miami one by</p>
<p>about 52% Austin got about 48% with over 10,000 votes. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty interesting. And do you have a preference yourself</p>
<p>between the two? I personally like Miami, I already have a</p>
<p>place in Miami, but I&rsquo;m checking out Austin to serve</p>
<p>you know, just for how close are you to 11? due diligence, just</p>
<p>for complete due diligence. So I think at this point, we should</p>
<p>just go through the cities that sacks doesn&rsquo;t have a home. We</p>
<p>just that might be easier for us to narrow it down. possible</p>
<p>location. Alright, listen, people started haranguing us on</p>
<p>the Twitter to have some bestie guesties on the program. And so</p>
<p>we decided we were bringing Balaji Srinivasan Balaji</p>
<p>Srinivasan. Did I get it correct? I mean, I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>pronouncing your name wrong for five years.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a fucking ignoramus race. You are such a fucking</p>
<p>racist.</p>
<p>Listen, Greek names are hard to pronounce. I mean, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine. Balaji Srinivasan names. Balaji. Everybody gets</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Balaji. Balaji. Balaji. Balaji Srinivasan.</p>
<p>Moon Moon attides Srinivasan.</p>
<p>Balaji you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve listened to just figure it out how to say</p>
<p>Polly hop at Tia. So</p>
<p>I have been training the world how to say Polly hop at Tia for</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>Sri Lankan names are the only names that are harder than South</p>
<p>Asian names, or South India. Although Tamil names are pretty</p>
<p>brutal. I mean, yeah,</p>
<p>Tamil names. Basically, you guys add like maybe one or two more</p>
<p>syllables. So I actually have to train and</p>
<p>hours end in a vowel. The Tamil always ended a consonant, which</p>
<p>always says then you can just they take liberal license to go</p>
<p>on for another 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Can you guys just drop a few syllables from your names?</p>
<p>Like we could. We could. Yeah. But we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Ball Street. No, I Matt Polly.</p>
<p>All right, there&rsquo;s a big tech backlash. And it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>because of David Sachs comments, a new poll shows that 80% of</p>
<p>registered voters, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a</p>
<p>minute, wait, before we go there. I have a question for</p>
<p>apology.</p>
<p>You are, in my opinion, but I think a lot of people would say</p>
<p>one of the most incredibly well read, thoughtful, you know,</p>
<p>commentators, commentators that we have, frankly, like, you know,</p>
<p>not just in tech, but I just think generally, in our society,</p>
<p>I would give you that I think you&rsquo;re incredible. I&rsquo;m curious,</p>
<p>how did you become such a polymath? Was this just one of</p>
<p>these things where you&rsquo;ve always been curious about</p>
<p>everything? Like, just tell us about I&rsquo;m curious about like how</p>
<p>you grew up, first of all, and then second, how do you spend a</p>
<p>normal day? I just want to know those. And then then we can just</p>
<p>jump in. I&rsquo;m just curious, because I&rsquo;m sure extremely well</p>
<p>read and extremely knowledgeable.</p>
<p>Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Um, you know, I try to</p>
<p>learn from from everybody. What do I do? I think normal people</p>
<p>go to the club, or they they go out and have fun. And I read</p>
<p>math books and history books and science books and stuff like</p>
<p>that. That&rsquo;s how I have fun. I find that more interesting.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with with going out people do that I go for</p>
<p>walks and stuff, I work out. But so I do a lot of that. And I</p>
<p>have I mean, other than that, I just, I just read a lot. And I</p>
<p>think I remember a moderate amount. And so I cite that. And</p>
<p>for me, I think it&rsquo;s something really much more complicated</p>
<p>than that. But that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I think we call that a polymath. The TIA.</p>
<p>The only difference is Chamath would be you, if he could stop</p>
<p>going to the club. And he lost that last 40%.</p>
<p>I will make an observation, which I was actually talking to</p>
<p>sacks about this, which is, there&rsquo;s some people who are</p>
<p>great at business and learn the tech because that part is</p>
<p>necessary to put it together. And there&rsquo;s some people who are</p>
<p>fundamentally like scientists or academics, and then get into</p>
<p>business in order to advance technology. And there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with the first group. And I think that&rsquo;s totally, you</p>
<p>know, fine and legitimate, like business people first, and then</p>
<p>they get tech. I&rsquo;m really part of the second group, I think</p>
<p>where, you know, I&rsquo;m fundamentally an academic at</p>
<p>heart, you know, I spent almost the first three decades of my</p>
<p>life meditating on mathematics, and just kind of got into tech</p>
<p>relatively later in life than many others.</p>
<p>All right. And you spent your career building companies,</p>
<p>everybody remembers earn.com.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s actually doing extremely well at</p>
<p>Coinbase. Coinbase earn is on track for 100 million revenue.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s much more than that in terms of GMV, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>broken out separately in there. Not their s1, but their</p>
<p>quarterly filing. So you can go and check me on that. And the</p>
<p>other assets that we added after I joined Coinbase are more than</p>
<p>50% of Coinbase revenue, again, in their filings, and Coinbase</p>
<p>custody and all of its assets come from Rosetta, which is</p>
<p>something that we did there. And we launched USDC when I was</p>
<p>there. And that is whatever $100 million a day. So they got a lot</p>
<p>of value out of that acquisition.</p>
<p>Just and you were the CTO for a while of Coinbase. Obviously,</p>
<p>what was your take on Coinbase&rsquo;s lend product, the SEC coming in</p>
<p>and saying, Hey, pump the brakes, we want a bunch of</p>
<p>information. And then they&rsquo;ve just Brian Armstrong and</p>
<p>Coinbase announced that they&rsquo;re not going to do the land</p>
<p>product. What&rsquo;s your take on that?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t speak for Coinbase anymore. Okay, I&rsquo;m, you know, in</p>
<p>my personal capacity. But I do think that this is sort of the</p>
<p>beginning of an era where we&rsquo;re going to be rolling back the</p>
<p>alphabet soup that FDR put in place. That&rsquo;s to say, you know,</p>
<p>the SEC is not set up to go after millions of crypto</p>
<p>holders and developers are set up to go after a Goldman and a</p>
<p>Morgan, you know, just like the FAA is not set up to go after</p>
<p>millions of drone developers to go after Boeing and Airbus. And</p>
<p>the FDA is not set up to go after millions of biohackers</p>
<p>are set up to go after you know, Pfizer and Merck. So the entire</p>
<p>20th century alphabet soup that regulatory apparatus is</p>
<p>meeting something that it&rsquo;s not really set up for. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be it&rsquo;s the problem is not the problem is not any one</p>
<p>actor like Coinbase or crack and or what have you their problem</p>
<p>is that technology has shifted. And they&rsquo;ve got many more people</p>
<p>to deal with. And many of those are individuals who are more</p>
<p>risk tolerant than companies. So, so I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be able to maintain the status quo of 100 years ago, the</p>
<p>statutes that they&rsquo;re citing, I think that&rsquo;s going to either get</p>
<p>knocked down in court, we&rsquo;re going to be technologically</p>
<p>invalidated, there&rsquo;s going to be sanctuary cities and states</p>
<p>for crypto, or there&rsquo;s going to be international entities like</p>
<p>what El Salvador is doing in Switzerland. So I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that that era is going to maintain, but I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a big conflict over it. So we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>How do you think it&rsquo;s different this time, though, apology to</p>
<p>the like, crackdown, because folks said the same thing. Going</p>
<p>into kind of the Napster era, when you know, everything was</p>
<p>basically peer to peer sharing of media files that were</p>
<p>technically copyright. And there was, you know, some regulatory</p>
<p>regime that, you know, had oversight over that copyright.</p>
<p>But then the DOJ got wrangled in, and they went in, and they</p>
<p>made an example out of arresting a couple 100 kids, I think, and</p>
<p>it basically caused everyone to back away entirely from the</p>
<p>market, similar to kind of what we may be seeing happening in</p>
<p>China right now. But is it not possible that we see a similar</p>
<p>sort of response this time around, where they kind of take</p>
<p>this targeted make an example approach to kind of share people</p>
<p>scare people kind of out of the the frenzy that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, I</p>
<p>think, driving a lot of people onto these platforms, rather</p>
<p>than going after the platforms themselves. So kind of saying,</p>
<p>Look, this is this is a violation of security laws, you</p>
<p>guys are getting prosecuted. Here&rsquo;s the 100 examples. And</p>
<p>suddenly 80% of the attention kind of gets vacuumed out.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;d say a few things about that first is, I think</p>
<p>2021 is different from the year 2000. In the sense that China is</p>
<p>an absolutely ruthless and very competent state. Whereas the US</p>
<p>government, I would consider, you know, it&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>between lawful evil and chaotic evil. You guys know that from</p>
<p>Dungeons and Dragons, okay. So the Chinese government is</p>
<p>lawful evil. They are very organized. And they plan ahead.</p>
<p>And when they push a button, they just execute, like, like</p>
<p>this whole society, and they don&rsquo;t leave, you know, round</p>
<p>corners or things left out. The US government is today in 2021,</p>
<p>not the 1950 US government, the 2020 US government is like this</p>
<p>shambolic, chaotic mess that can&rsquo;t really do anything, and is</p>
<p>optimized for PR and yelling online. And that&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>important topic. But to your so that&rsquo;s one thing where I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference in just state capacity. But in that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not to say that they&rsquo;re not going to try with what they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got. The other thing is that, so to your Napster point, there</p>
<p>was thesis and antithesis, but there was synthesis. That&rsquo;s to</p>
<p>say, you know, Napster led to Kazaa and LimeWire. And</p>
<p>actually, the Kazaa guys went into Skype. So something legit</p>
<p>came out of that. But the more important or more on point thing</p>
<p>is, it led to Spotify and iTunes, the record companies</p>
<p>were forced to the negotiating table,</p>
<p>there was a there was a way point there that&rsquo;s important,</p>
<p>which is good. When that happened in Napster. We, we ran</p>
<p>a company called one amp, and it was part of AOL. The biggest</p>
<p>architectural flaw of Napster was it&rsquo;s a llama&rsquo;s ass. And and</p>
<p>well, the biggest problem with Napster was that it was it was</p>
<p>not fundamentally peer to peer. And so there were these servers.</p>
<p>And so, you know, the the simple software architecture decision</p>
<p>that somebody had to make was okay, well, let&rsquo;s just make a</p>
<p>entirely headless product that basically is a fundamentally</p>
<p>peer to peer. And that&rsquo;s what the Nutella source code was, we</p>
<p>actually released that on AOL servers, without them knowing,</p>
<p>it took them a few hours to figure this out. They called us</p>
<p>we shut the whole thing down. But in those few hours, it was</p>
<p>downloaded about five or 6000 times all this open source code</p>
<p>that we put out, that was the basis of limewire, bear share.</p>
<p>And that is what basically just decapitated the music industry.</p>
<p>And it was there that then the music industry realized we</p>
<p>needed a contractual framework to operate with these folks,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll just keep inventing technology that makes</p>
<p>us impossible. And then that&rsquo;s what sort of that&rsquo;s what iTunes</p>
<p>was able to do with a 99 cent store. That&rsquo;s what Spotify was</p>
<p>able to do after that. But a lot of it started was because of</p>
<p>what biology said earlier, which is a technologically, people</p>
<p>just will continue to push the boundaries. And we did that in</p>
<p>music. And I think that&rsquo;s a lot of why the industry looks the</p>
<p>way it does today.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the print, the print, the premise kind of</p>
<p>resolved back to centralized systems, right? I mean, like,</p>
<p>think about, you know, the Napster concept, it was really</p>
<p>supposed to be true peer to peer file sharing, and it ended up</p>
<p>becoming the iTunes store where everything sat on Apple servers.</p>
<p>And they ultimately that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the reflexivity. Because</p>
<p>like, what happens is all of these folks, you know, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting at Warner Brothers or Warner Music or Universal Music</p>
<p>Group, you&rsquo;re seeing an entire industry that was worth probably</p>
<p>20 or $30 billion, just getting completely decimated. And then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this psychological thing that happens where first you</p>
<p>want to shut everything down. But then because there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>other thing that is even more evil, and even worse and</p>
<p>uncontrollable than the thing that you hated, then you</p>
<p>actually say, Well, listen, my enemy&rsquo;s enemy is my friend. And</p>
<p>so then you say, Well, fine, let&rsquo;s find a few partners to</p>
<p>work with. And we can try to find a way of, of living with</p>
<p>these technologies. And that&rsquo;s going to repeat your point</p>
<p>biology. crypto is probably now where we&rsquo;re going to see it play</p>
<p>out first, because that&rsquo;s probably the most important</p>
<p>intersection of individuals desire and regulatory framework</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s outdated, where the SEC has some extremely complicated</p>
<p>questions it needs to answer, especially even after something</p>
<p>today, like if you&rsquo;re sitting inside, you know, the SEC, and</p>
<p>all of a sudden, you see that that China, an entire country,</p>
<p>that basically was where an enormous amount of this crypto</p>
<p>activity started and originated and was happening, can</p>
<p>completely turn something off. What is our position as a</p>
<p>government and as a society? We don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>Well, let me just fill everybody in for a second, who don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what happens on the taping today, September 24. Chinese</p>
<p>government has announced that doing any transactions in</p>
<p>cryptocurrency is now illegal holding it. Apparently, you can</p>
<p>still hold it. And this comes after Bitcoin servers being</p>
<p>kicked out of the country. So yes, they&rsquo;ve pushed the button.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Balaji.</p>
<p>To Friedberg, I would say, BitTorrent is what kept the</p>
<p>record industry honest. And that kind of forced them to the table</p>
<p>of iTunes. So to Chamath&rsquo;s point, also, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it</p>
<p>more evil, I&rsquo;d call it more good. And BitTorrent also lurks</p>
<p>out there as kind of this, you know, peer to peer enforcer</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a check, exactly. And it&rsquo;s not gone. And in fact, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a basis for new technologies. And I think this is another</p>
<p>flare up. The other thing is that with crypto, the upside,</p>
<p>even though the state wants to crack down on it harder, the</p>
<p>upside is also greater, and the global internet is bigger. And</p>
<p>so I think the rest of world, meaning all the world besides</p>
<p>the US and China, is a huge player in what is to come.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s India, but it&rsquo;s also, you know, Brazil, it&rsquo;s every other</p>
<p>country that&rsquo;s not the US or China. And so that&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>player on the stage. And then third to Chamath to your point</p>
<p>about, yes, China banned crypto. Well, you know, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting is, people talk about China copying the US.</p>
<p>Nowadays, actually, in many ways, especially on a policy</p>
<p>front, the US is copying China without admitting it. But it</p>
<p>does so poorly. For example, lockdown. Okay, the Chinese</p>
<p>lockdown, you know, was something where it wasn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>sit in your rooms, it was something with like, drones with</p>
<p>thermometers and central quarantine, where people were</p>
<p>taken from their families and centrally quarantined, and 1000</p>
<p>ultra intrusive measures that the population by and large</p>
<p>complied with. I mean, forget about a vaccine mandate, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about like, you can see all the videos and stuff from</p>
<p>from out of China, the government itself is published,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t seem real at first. They didn&rsquo;t seem real at first,</p>
<p>right? Yeah. And so you know, the thing is that for the US to</p>
<p>follow that it&rsquo;s a little bit like as a mental image, imagine</p>
<p>a life Chinese gymnast going and doing this whole gymnastics</p>
<p>routine, and then a big, you know, lumpy American following</p>
<p>and not being able to do those same moves, right? The Chinese</p>
<p>government, you know, is is, as I said, lawful evil, but they</p>
<p>are set up to just snap this, snap that do this, do that. The</p>
<p>US government is absolutely not and the US people are not</p>
<p>whatever you do.</p>
<p>Also, our system is a democracy, is it not like so you cannot</p>
<p>just do that, even if the government wanted to weld people</p>
<p>into their homes, we have a democratic state here, we have</p>
<p>to discuss these things. And there&rsquo;s a legal framework to it.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, and 1940s, 1930s, the US was still a democracy,</p>
<p>but it basically managed to exert a very strong top down</p>
<p>control on things. Today, we have something for where for</p>
<p>right, like, you know, under FDR, or in the 50s, a very</p>
<p>conformist society, which was able to kind of drive things</p>
<p>through, even though as a democracy, it was something</p>
<p>where mass media was so centralized, that a relatively</p>
<p>few relatively small group of people could get consensus among</p>
<p>themselves. And then what they print in the headlines, I mean,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to go and figure out the facts on their own, this</p>
<p>gets into the media topic later. So it&rsquo;s de facto centralized at</p>
<p>the media level, the information production and dissemination</p>
<p>level. And then you kind of manufactured consent from there.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re combining that democratic aspect, the</p>
<p>legal aspect with a new information dissemination thing,</p>
<p>which is destabilized, I think a lot of things. Saks, what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>take?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;d love to get Balaji&rsquo;s take on an article that</p>
<p>came out this week in the Wall Street Journal, I think it was a</p>
<p>really important article came about four days ago. And it was</p>
<p>entitled, Xi Jinping aims to reign in Chinese capitalism and</p>
<p>Hugh to Mao socialist vision. And the article describes how</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all seen and talked about on this pod, how they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>cracking down on tech giants have been cutting down their</p>
<p>tech oligarchs down to size, like Jack Ma, how he disappeared</p>
<p>under house arrest. And, you know, and we&rsquo;ve seen that, you</p>
<p>know, they stopped the the anti IPO. But But this article went</p>
<p>beyond those steps and really talked about she&rsquo;s ideological</p>
<p>vision. And what it basically says is that what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>here isn&rsquo;t just the CCP consolidating power, they</p>
<p>actually want to bring the country back to socialism. And</p>
<p>what they say is that that within the CCP, or at least</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s view of it, capitalism was just something they did as an</p>
<p>interim measure to catch up to the West. But ultimately, they</p>
<p>are very serious about socialism. And, you know,</p>
<p>reading this article, I had to wonder, well, gee, did we just</p>
<p>catch a lucky break here, in the sense that look, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>abandoning or if they abandon the thing they copied from us,</p>
<p>which is market based capitalism, they use that to</p>
<p>catch up, maybe this is the way that actually, this is the thing</p>
<p>that slows them down. And the thing that that historically</p>
<p>that it brought to mind is that if you go back into the 1500s,</p>
<p>and you compare Europe to China, China, the Chinese civilization</p>
<p>was way ahead. I mean, it was the standard of living was way</p>
<p>ahead. Technologically, it was way ahead. Europe was a bunch of</p>
<p>squalid, warring, tribal nation states. And then what happened</p>
<p>is a single Chinese emperor banned the shipbuilding</p>
<p>industry, any ship with more than two mass was banned. And so</p>
<p>exploration just stopped in China, it they became very</p>
<p>inward facing, whereas the European states explored and</p>
<p>discovered and conquered the new world colonized the world. And</p>
<p>that led to an explosion of wealth and innovation. And as a</p>
<p>result, Western Europe, and then it&rsquo;s sort of descended, the</p>
<p>United States ended up essentially conquering and</p>
<p>dominating the modern world. And so I guess, you know, to</p>
<p>bring it back to my question to biology, is there a chance that</p>
<p>what she is doing returning to socialism? Could this be like</p>
<p>the Chinese emperor who banned shipbuilding? Or am I reading</p>
<p>way too much into the single Wall Street Journal story?</p>
<p>So my short answer on that is, I think it is. I think the</p>
<p>socialist thing is real. But I think it&rsquo;s better to call it</p>
<p>nationalist socialism. With the implications that has, whereas I</p>
<p>think the US is kind of going in the direction of what I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>called maybe socialist nationalism. You know, where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like different emphases in terms of what is</p>
<p>prioritized, but you know, and I think in many ways, China is</p>
<p>like the new Nazi Germany woke America&rsquo;s like the new Soviet</p>
<p>Russia, and the decentralized center is going to be the new</p>
<p>America, I can elaborate on that. But basically, with</p>
<p>respect to this, one thing I try to do is I try to triangulate</p>
<p>lots of stories. So rather than for example, and nothing wrong</p>
<p>with the Wall Street Journal, you know, the piece like</p>
<p>looking at it, but for every WSJ piece you read, it&rsquo;s useful to</p>
<p>get like, you know, what is CGTN or global time saying even if</p>
<p>you discounted just to see what they&rsquo;re saying, and then you</p>
<p>also triangulate with, let&rsquo;s say, the Indian or Russian</p>
<p>point of view. And by doing this, you I feel that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better than just reading 10 American articles. And, you</p>
<p>know, especially reading primary sources, like there&rsquo;s this good</p>
<p>site called reading the Chinese dream, which actually translates</p>
<p>primary sources, and then you can kind of form your opinions</p>
<p>from that versus like, like a quote, hot take, right? I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying you are, I&rsquo;m just saying that that&rsquo;s what I try to do. So</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve really gotten China right here. I mean, I</p>
<p>think that if you if you look at what&rsquo;s happening, I think we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>basically forecasted this orchestration of essentially the</p>
<p>revertical integration of China. You know, we have China Inc,</p>
<p>where the CEO is Xi Jinping. And where there is a, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;ve, they&rsquo;ve changed the game, where</p>
<p>what they are playing, essentially, is like, settlers</p>
<p>of Catan or something where the goal is just to hoard resources.</p>
<p>And I think that they have enough critical resources for</p>
<p>the world. And the clever part of what they did was the last 20</p>
<p>or 30 years, they leveraged the world to essentially finance</p>
<p>their ability to then have a stranglehold on these critical</p>
<p>resources, whether it&rsquo;s ships, or whether it&rsquo;s rare earths, or</p>
<p>other materials, they leveled up. And I think that was the</p>
<p>genius. Yeah, well, they leveled up, they leveled up on our</p>
<p>capital. Yeah. And now that all that infrastructure is there.</p>
<p>And now that we are addicted to the drug, they can then change</p>
<p>the rules of our operating system. It was a brilliant move.</p>
<p>But they allowed entrepreneurs to believe that they could be</p>
<p>entrepreneurs, they allowed an entire society to basically</p>
<p>level up. Why did nobody see this coming to month? Nobody saw</p>
<p>this coming. People were starting venture firms, look</p>
<p>what they were taking companies public.</p>
<p>They did Belt and Road while we did nation building in Iraq and</p>
<p>Afghanistan. Right? I mean, what is Belt and Road Belt and Road</p>
<p>is there a bill is they&rsquo;re creating ports and super</p>
<p>highways to extract the resources that mouth is talking</p>
<p>about and bringing them into the Chinese system. And what did we</p>
<p>spend our trillions on nation building in Afghanistan? I mean,</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t we see this coming? Everybody was looking at China</p>
<p>starting venture firms, they&rsquo;re, you know, embracing it taking</p>
<p>companies public Wall Street, politicians, nobody saw this</p>
<p>coming. So the Rising Tiger stories been around since the</p>
<p>late 90s. Right? No, no, I&rsquo;m talking about why didn&rsquo;t we see</p>
<p>them cutting the heads off the answer? entrepreneurship spent</p>
<p>because it was not about white people.</p>
<p>China was in Sri Lanka. China was in Africa. These are not</p>
<p>sexy, interesting places. Western audiences, they could</p>
<p>you guys couldn&rsquo;t give a fuck. Let&rsquo;s just be honest. Okay. And</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why it didn&rsquo;t matter. Because you we thought we all</p>
<p>thought that these are countries that are sort of, you know,</p>
<p>squalid third world, developing nation states that don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>matter. They don&rsquo;t necessarily have the resources that matter.</p>
<p>But what did China do? They realized that those folks are</p>
<p>the future GDP, those folks are the future population pools, the</p>
<p>young that can actually do the hard work, and then they went</p>
<p>and they secured again. So not only resources now, so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one thing, hold on. So that&rsquo;s one thing. I think we entirely</p>
<p>missed it. Because, as David said, the military industrial</p>
<p>complex doesn&rsquo;t look at, you know, a developing nation and</p>
<p>say, we want to be there. It looks at Afghanistan and says,</p>
<p>we want to dominate it, because we can actually feed off of that</p>
<p>domination. So that&rsquo;s one thing. The second thing is that I think</p>
<p>that we misunderstood Xi Jinping&rsquo;s ambition. And I think</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a reasonable mistake to have made. The first one is</p>
<p>an error of just complete stupidity. The second one is</p>
<p>something that I think it was legitimate to have missed. And to</p>
<p>your point, you&rsquo;re off he they not only stole the</p>
<p>entrepreneurial playbook, but the colonizing other places and</p>
<p>giving them debt and giving them resources and building ports in</p>
<p>other countries. We thought it was dumb. Let&rsquo;s all be honest.</p>
<p>You know, 10 years ago, no, we did it. No, I would argue</p>
<p>previously argue in a lot of cases we benefited. So China set</p>
<p>up and bought like the largest pork production company in</p>
<p>Australia. And what do you feed those pigs, you feed them</p>
<p>soybeans, and where do those soybeans come from? largest</p>
<p>soybean exporting market is the United States. You know, we had</p>
<p>a tremendous customer in China, as they expanded their</p>
<p>consumption pattern through all of this investing they were</p>
<p>doing worldwide. We were exporting john deere, farm</p>
<p>equipment and Caterpillar construction equipment and</p>
<p>soybean products and there was a and our knowledge industry and</p>
<p>there was a tremendous service model and globalization really</p>
<p>created call it a catch 22 for the United States, where you</p>
<p>know, we were watching the rising tiger, you know, it</p>
<p>fueled in part by this kind of distributed entrepreneurism. But</p>
<p>as that distributed entrepreneurism creates, you</p>
<p>know, obviously, the social</p>
<p>you think there is an equal amount of dollars that went</p>
<p>into Western developed nations from China as it went into</p>
<p>third world countries. No, but it&rsquo;s Western nations couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give a shit about that money is too hard to turn down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mistake in our thinking with respect to the</p>
<p>rest of the world that we&rsquo;ve been making, we make over and</p>
<p>over again. And it was all kind of predicted by a historian</p>
<p>named Samuel Huntington. At Harvard in the 1990s, he wrote a</p>
<p>book called called clash of civilizations. This, this book</p>
<p>was written the same time that another famous book came out</p>
<p>called the end of history and the last man and what the common</p>
<p>belief was in the 1990s in the US was that we had reached the</p>
<p>end of history where every country would become democratic</p>
<p>and capitalist, right? That was the end of history is democratic</p>
<p>capitalism. And we believe that the more we went all over the</p>
<p>world spreading our ideals, it would hasten this day where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d all become democratic capitalists. What Huntington</p>
<p>said is no, you know, cultures and civilizations, these go back</p>
<p>1000s of years, these are stubborn things. And what these</p>
<p>other cultures really want is not westernization, but</p>
<p>modernization. And what they&rsquo;re going to do is they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>modernize, they&rsquo;re going to learn from us as much as they</p>
<p>can about technology, they&rsquo;re going to assimilate and adapt</p>
<p>and take all of our technology, but they are not going to</p>
<p>become like us, they&rsquo;re not going to westernize. And that is</p>
<p>basically what&rsquo;s happened over the last 25 years. And so the</p>
<p>Chinese have caught up to us. And suddenly we realize, whoa,</p>
<p>wait a second, they have not westernized, they are still</p>
<p>their own unique civilization. They, they have they have</p>
<p>basically the equivalent of a modern day emperor. And, and</p>
<p>they have no interest in westernizing. And we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>what have we done? Because now we&rsquo;ve allowed them to catch up</p>
<p>from a technological standpoint.</p>
<p>biology, why do we why do everybody in the West get this</p>
<p>so wrong?</p>
<p>Well, so a few things. One is political differences aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>public in China, but they are real. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>backroom stuff. And there was a real leadership shift from dang</p>
<p>and jang and who to to G. You know, the Mao era was</p>
<p>revolutionary communist, the dang jang who era was</p>
<p>internationalist capitalist, I think that was real. And the G</p>
<p>era is nationalist socialist. And it&rsquo;s just different, like</p>
<p>who did not fully control the military the way that she does.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this ad, you guys should watch the Chinese military ad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called like, we will all be here or something like that.</p>
<p>And the thing about it, it&rsquo;s not just that it&rsquo;s like, extremely</p>
<p>well coordinated military parade and set to be</p>
<p>intimidating, and so on. It&rsquo;s that the whole thing clearly</p>
<p>just falls up to one guy. Gee, it&rsquo;s not him riding in a car</p>
<p>with the rest of the Communist Party, flanking him as an</p>
<p>oligarchy. It&rsquo;s just like one guy, this 2 million person army</p>
<p>folds up to him. That is a true consolidation and roll up of</p>
<p>power that he was able to accomplish, among other things</p>
<p>with tigers and flies going and throwing bougie Lee in prison,</p>
<p>go, you know, having generals, you know, thrown in prison for</p>
<p>whether they were actually corrupt, or whether they simply</p>
<p>you know, dissented or were political rivals. Yeah, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard. It&rsquo;s hard to know from the outside, you know, in one sense,</p>
<p>because so many folks in the Chinese government were taking</p>
<p>bribes is almost like an equity stake in their province, you</p>
<p>know, like coming up, they&rsquo;re like, Hey, you know, hey, grew.</p>
<p>So, you know, give me a cut. Every lot of people were</p>
<p>vulnerable. So he just consult he so it&rsquo;s not something you</p>
<p>know, people will say, Oh, you know, the Chinese plan for 100</p>
<p>years, they don&rsquo;t plan for 100 years, they had this huge war in</p>
<p>the 20th century to the nationalists and communists, the</p>
<p>ding, the ding transition, you know, his triumph for the gang</p>
<p>of four, that was not something Mao had planned. They&rsquo;re human</p>
<p>beings like everybody else. And they had a real leadership</p>
<p>transition after three hours of continuity, then this is what I</p>
<p>think this is the key point you&rsquo;re making, which is, I think</p>
<p>the reason that this actually flipped, and we didn&rsquo;t see it</p>
<p>coming is because Xi Jinping decided, I want to have</p>
<p>complete control over the country, these other people are</p>
<p>getting too powerful. And we&rsquo;re actually reading into this, that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some crazy plan. It just could be a crazy man, not a</p>
<p>crazy. I really disagree with you. Why explain? But I mean, he</p>
<p>just decided, he just decided to basically take away every</p>
<p>entrepreneurs company, they were not trying to do they were doing</p>
<p>all of this stuff in plain sight. Okay. As an example, you</p>
<p>know, we view Sierra Leone as a place where we make commercials</p>
<p>about or we try to fundraise for or we send USA ID, they view</p>
<p>Sierra Leone as a place where there&rsquo;s critical resources that</p>
<p>are dependent on the that the future of the world depends on</p>
<p>and so they will go, they will modernize, they will invest and</p>
<p>they will then own those critical resources. View, we</p>
<p>view Chile as a random country in South America that abuts, you</p>
<p>know, Peru and Argentina, they view Chile as a place where you</p>
<p>where there is the largest sources of lithium that we need</p>
<p>for battery production in the future. They were doing this for</p>
<p>decades, right in front of us. And the reason we did the</p>
<p>cutting of capitalism, hold on a second reason, the reason we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t pay attention is because none of those countries mean</p>
<p>anything to us. Okay, so I agree with Chamath. And the</p>
<p>thing is, though, I&rsquo;d argue that the blindness actually comes</p>
<p>from both ends of the political spectrum, like on the</p>
<p>conservative end, oh, these are shithole countries, basically,</p>
<p>you know, you can believe that if you want, but you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something where, for example, COVID was only taken seriously</p>
<p>once it was hitting Italy and France, like China was still</p>
<p>considered like a third world country. But it actually also</p>
<p>comes from the liberal side in a different look like it&rsquo;s slightly</p>
<p>masked, but it&rsquo;s a condescension of not the</p>
<p>military industrial complex, but the nonprofit NGO, you know,</p>
<p>complex like, oh, the white savior with the NGOs, you know,</p>
<p>coming in and, you know, you know, pat them on the head kind</p>
<p>of thing. They&rsquo;re not a not a big deal. And the thing about</p>
<p>this is like the one thing I think is a huge thing for</p>
<p>diplomatic core today is making any generalization about another</p>
<p>culture, which says that they&rsquo;re not completely good, or that</p>
<p>they have some aspect to them that doesn&rsquo;t match exactly to</p>
<p>the US, you can be called a racist for doing that. And so</p>
<p>this is the criticism of Islam. I mean, if you criticize Saudi</p>
<p>Arabia for throwing gay people off of buildings, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>respecting religious</p>
<p>say that biology just gave the most precise delineation that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had. So I let me just repackage what you said, because</p>
<p>it resonated with me. Western philosophy tends to view</p>
<p>countries in three buckets. bucket number one are countries</p>
<p>like us, right? Those are the other Western countries, the GA</p>
<p>countries, they feel like we&rsquo;re aligned. And then what happens</p>
<p>is you get this weird thing where then you move into like</p>
<p>countries where you basically either deal with it with woke</p>
<p>ism, right? Oh, let me go pat them on the head. Let me go try</p>
<p>to save them because it makes me feel better. Or you deal with</p>
<p>them as neocons where just like I let me go dominate them and</p>
<p>take them to war. And literally, you can take all 180 odd</p>
<p>countries in the world and effectively sort them into those</p>
<p>three things. And that I think is the problem with with the</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s view of what we&rsquo;re doing. And so what David said is</p>
<p>really true, which is that while we were doing this, we had</p>
<p>neocon war, woke ism, or you&rsquo;re our buddy, because you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>us. The entire world reordered itself with completely different</p>
<p>incentives. And they did it right in front of us. And now we</p>
<p>wake up to realize, oh, my gosh, that was an enormous</p>
<p>miscalculation that we just did.</p>
<p>Yeah. So you know, if you look at kind of the history of the</p>
<p>West interaction with the rest of the world, and let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about colonialism, and whether whether you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>colonialism over the last few 100 years, or even you talk</p>
<p>about a microcosm, like Afghanistan, over the last 20</p>
<p>years, I would argue that there&rsquo;s three phases to the West</p>
<p>interaction with these other cultures. Phase one is sort of</p>
<p>domination, right? Like Jamal was saying, phase two is</p>
<p>assimilation, where the the culture that&rsquo;s been dominated</p>
<p>realizes that they&rsquo;re behind and they want to catch up. And so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a process of Americanization romanization. And</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing is they are learning from us and taking our</p>
<p>technology and it lulls us into a false sense of security that</p>
<p>we think they&rsquo;re becoming Americanized. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>alignment. It&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;re trying to catch up. Then the</p>
<p>third phase is reassertion, where the the dominated country</p>
<p>culture, you know, what have you reasserts its traditional</p>
<p>culture and its traditional views, because they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>modernized, but without becoming truly becoming Americanized or</p>
<p>Westernized. And we are caught off guard by that. And we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really realize that they never really wanted our culture, they</p>
<p>just wanted to throw off, you know, American domination or</p>
<p>Western domination. And so what they&rsquo;ve actually done is use</p>
<p>this period to, to basically assimilate and catch up. And the</p>
<p>reality is, like in Afghanistan, they don&rsquo;t have to fully</p>
<p>assimilate all of our technology, they don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>become as strong as us, because we are in their land, they just</p>
<p>have to become strong enough to basically achieve upgrade their</p>
<p>systems, right? They just have to achieve a defensive</p>
<p>superiority. It&rsquo;s not an offensive capability. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>much easier for them to catch up that we think. And we are always</p>
<p>caught off guard by this dynamic, and it repeats itself</p>
<p>over and over again. And what you&rsquo;ve seen in in in China is,</p>
<p>you know, 3040 years ago, you had the great economic reform</p>
<p>of Deng Xiaoping, he laid out what they had to do, he said, he</p>
<p>said, abide your time and hide your strength, hide your</p>
<p>strength under a bushel. That was the great motto by Deng</p>
<p>Xiaoping. He set that policy for 30 or 40 years, they embrace</p>
<p>basically perestroika without glasnost. They reformed their</p>
<p>economic system, they copied us, but but not making Gorbachev&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mistake of giving up any political control whatsoever.</p>
<p>And by 2012, they had largely caught up. And so I would say</p>
<p>that she was not an aberration, he was a reassertion, they had</p>
<p>gotten to a point of strength where they were ready for that</p>
<p>strong leader who was ready to reassert their basically their</p>
<p>ethno nationalism. And that&rsquo;s the point we&rsquo;re at right now.</p>
<p>And once again, we&rsquo;ve been played for fools and caught off</p>
<p>guard.</p>
<p>Friedberg, but I mean, one of the side, one of the signs was</p>
<p>his corruption crackdown a few years ago, right? I mean, that</p>
<p>was kind of step one, where he took all these provincial</p>
<p>managers and kicked him out and put him in jail and started to</p>
<p>you know, clean things up internally, where there was</p>
<p>clearly kind of corrupt behavior underway. But you know, I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>couple points back, I do think it&rsquo;s worth highlighting that, to</p>
<p>some degree, you can kind of try and diagnose his motivation or</p>
<p>diagnose the motivation as being, you know, rather not too</p>
<p>surprising, and maybe not too nefarious in the kind of, you</p>
<p>know, power grabbing sense, which I think we all kind of</p>
<p>want to bucket it as, but, you know, if there&rsquo;s a population,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re seeing in the United States, where, when you loosen</p>
<p>the screws on liberalism, and you know, you kind of allow more</p>
<p>freedom to operate and more kind of free market behavior, you see</p>
<p>tremendous progress. And as I think we&rsquo;ve talked about in the</p>
<p>past, tremendous progress always yields, you know, a distribution</p>
<p>of outcomes amongst the population, but everyone moves</p>
<p>forward, some people just move forward 10 times faster and</p>
<p>farther. And it causes populist unrest, right. And we&rsquo;ve seen it</p>
<p>in the United States. I mean, if AOC, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie</p>
<p>Sanders were elected to kind of be the, you know, the</p>
<p>triumvirate that ran the United States today, they would</p>
<p>probably say, let&rsquo;s end all you know, this capitalism that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creating all this wealth in the United States, and progress</p>
<p>generally would slow down. And I think that there&rsquo;s been inklings</p>
<p>of that. Clearly, there&rsquo;s data to support the inklings of this</p>
<p>in China, that indicates, you know what the the loosening of</p>
<p>the screws has allowed tremendous progress, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>time to tighten the screws, because populism and unrest is</p>
<p>going to arise from kind of perceived inequality, just like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing in the United States. And, you know, I</p>
<p>guarantee or I can&rsquo;t guarantee, but I would assume that if you</p>
<p>know, certain populist leaders in the United States have the</p>
<p>same level of authority that Chinese leaders do, they would</p>
<p>probably act in the same way.</p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;re gonna see next is, and I think we should</p>
<p>talk about what we think will happen next with China. I think</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s on the brink of having a revolution. If you look at what</p>
<p>happened to the Uyghurs, obviously, you can&rsquo;t practice</p>
<p>religion, their students in Hong Kong can&rsquo;t protest, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>publish what you want. Founders can&rsquo;t start companies. Now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to play video games as much as you</p>
<p>want. You can&rsquo;t use social media. And today, you can&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any control over your finance. If you squeeze people across</p>
<p>this many vectors, this hard, this quickly, I think free</p>
<p>birds, right, it could result in massive China&rsquo;s not like a</p>
<p>uniform people in a uniform culture. Of course, yeah. But I</p>
<p>mean, I&rsquo;m just listed like seven or eight things they&rsquo;re doing to</p>
<p>but there are many provinces, many cultures, many differences,</p>
<p>many differences of experience, by the way, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>the rural population in China doesn&rsquo;t experience much of what</p>
<p>I think is driving industry and driving this inequality and</p>
<p>perceived inequality and the changes that are underway. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think that a revolution is generally supported unless you</p>
<p>have, you know, enough kind of concentrated swell across the</p>
<p>population. I don&rsquo;t know how you could see something like that</p>
<p>happening. And as diverse a population as China,</p>
<p>I support China&rsquo;s limits on social media use by children. I</p>
<p>could I could use that here for my kids.</p>
<p>I clearly sacks is letting his kids use whatever they want. I</p>
<p>mean, we definitely need to have some of those over here. Balaji</p>
<p>What do you what do you think is going to happen? worst case</p>
<p>best case for China in the next two decades?</p>
<p>Well, so one thought I want to give is basically that in some</p>
<p>ways, this is inevitable, because China and India are 35%</p>
<p>of the world, Asia was the center of the world. And one way</p>
<p>of thinking about it is that America and the West executed</p>
<p>extremely well over the last couple of centuries. And Asia</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t with socialism and communism. And now that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>actually got a better OS, it&rsquo;s not like the US really could</p>
<p>restrain them, you know. So in that sense, that&rsquo;s also part of</p>
<p>their internal narrative in a way. I mean, of course, Mao</p>
<p>killed millions of people there, they screwed up their</p>
<p>own stuff. But their narrative is, they were colonized by the</p>
<p>West and the opium wars are patronized as copycats</p>
<p>emasculated on film. For decades, they&rsquo;re like heads</p>
<p>down in sweatshops, they built plastic stuff, they took orders</p>
<p>from all these overseas guys, and announce their time to stand</p>
<p>up and take back their rightful position in the world. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s their narrative. And so it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to not not agree with it, but at least understand where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming from. Because they want it more, I think. And so I</p>
<p>disagree, Jason, with your with your view that they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have a revolution. I think that&rsquo;s, like, that&rsquo;s the kind of</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a Western mindset, where, you know, Australia, for</p>
<p>example, is having these COVID protests. In China, the harder</p>
<p>the crackdown, the less more crackdown, like, the easier it</p>
<p>makes the next crackdown. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s something where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be an easy revolution, that&rsquo;s for sure. But</p>
<p>we saw protests, you saw Tiananmen Square, you saw Hong</p>
<p>Kong, and you&rsquo;re gonna see anything since that was 30 years</p>
<p>ago. It&rsquo;s still proof positive that if you squeeze people, they</p>
<p>will take to the streets.</p>
<p>Life in China has accelerated incredible pace over the past 30</p>
<p>years, the average person in China is so much better off than</p>
<p>they were five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30</p>
<p>years ago, revolutions don&rsquo;t come out of that amount of</p>
<p>progress, right? When when your life when you go from $4,000 a</p>
<p>year on average income to $20,000 a year on average income,</p>
<p>what happens if they don&rsquo;t have jobs in the recession,</p>
<p>the only time you revolt is because of economics. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I just said. So what happens if there&rsquo;s a, if they</p>
<p>have a market crash percent a year, the GDP is growing 8% a</p>
<p>year, the population is seeing an incredible benefit. And what</p>
<p>is that reverses? What if that reverses? Would you see a</p>
<p>revolution then?</p>
<p>Well, Jay Cal, I mean, look, I think I think we it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>topologies point about this is like a Western mindset. I mean,</p>
<p>think about the Arab Spring, we saw all those revolutions with</p>
<p>the Arab Spring. And we thought, Oh, look, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>finally throwing off the yoke of oppression. And now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to set up democratic states. And what do we actually</p>
<p>get? We actually got religious fundamentalism, right? Like we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get what we thought. And I think this happens over and</p>
<p>over again, is that, is that, you know, we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>superimpose our mindset on them. You know, we&rsquo;re thinking like,</p>
<p>frankly, a Davos, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I&rsquo;m thinking like,</p>
<p>people want security, by the way, and security, security can</p>
<p>come in a lot of different forms. And religious</p>
<p>fundamentalism is one of them. And you know, the the way that</p>
<p>we see kind of government operate in China may seem</p>
<p>foreign and uncomfortable to us, but it provides enough security</p>
<p>to people to know they&rsquo;re going to have housing, shelter, food,</p>
<p>medicine, and be able to do the things that they want to do to</p>
<p>some extent in some limit. You know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>an equation that says all humans that don&rsquo;t live like Americans</p>
<p>are going to be unhappy.</p>
<p>Yeah, last thing I&rsquo;ll just say is basically, I think the idea</p>
<p>that China will collapse from internal revolution, or, you</p>
<p>know, the US military is like really strong relative to</p>
<p>China, I think are both actually forms of wishful</p>
<p>thinking. With that said, I do believe that we need a strategy</p>
<p>for China on a global scale. And I think the future is a</p>
<p>centralized East and decentralized West. And but but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be just, hey, deus ex machina is</p>
<p>gonna gonna solve this problem.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think the revolution is going to necessarily</p>
<p>overturn China, I think you&rsquo;re going to see revolutionary</p>
<p>moments.</p>
<p>Well, so just just to say one thing in your defense, Jake out,</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s kind of beating up on you is I was</p>
<p>beating up, by the way, just</p>
<p>defending Jake out what&rsquo;s going on. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>guarantee of revolution. But I think this is going to be</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be some social unrest.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I the one way in which I agree with Jake out is I</p>
<p>do think that freedom ultimately is the birthright of every</p>
<p>human, regardless of where you&rsquo;re born, you know who you</p>
<p>are, what culture you are. But I think the thing that the United</p>
<p>States has learned over the last 20 years is the road from here</p>
<p>to there is going to be much more complicated than we think</p>
<p>and longer and longer and cultures are very stubborn</p>
<p>things. And they&rsquo;re not going away anytime soon. And the</p>
<p>transition is going to have to happen within those cultures.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that we can superimpose.</p>
<p>By the way, I would I would also point out freedom is the</p>
<p>birthright and the want of a people that at some point have</p>
<p>enough security to feel like they have that luxury. Up until</p>
<p>that point, I think that you have to make the decision of</p>
<p>does security give me more than freedom. And in a lot of cases,</p>
<p>security coming with all the costs it comes with may give</p>
<p>people more than absolute freedom. And that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>transitionary phase, I think, you know, a lot of people&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>through people&rsquo;s being civilizations and states and</p>
<p>whatnot.</p>
<p>Anybody have a prediction of what&rsquo;s going to happen in the</p>
<p>next 20 years? Or we&rsquo;ll move on to the next?</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t believe sacks was empathetic to your point, Jake,</p>
<p>although that was a great moment. It&rsquo;s really insane.</p>
<p>I have a few predictions. Yeah, I think actually, if you read,</p>
<p>you know, the kill chain or similar books, that&rsquo;s by I think</p>
<p>Christian bros. It&rsquo;s a good book, where basically is like,</p>
<p>you know, the US military has a perfect record in its war games</p>
<p>with China. China&rsquo;s won every round. And, you know, if you if</p>
<p>you look at just the fact that with COVID US military basically</p>
<p>suffered a military defeat in the sense that it had this whole</p>
<p>biodefense program, it&rsquo;s supposed to protect against</p>
<p>biological weapons. That didn&rsquo;t work. Afghanistan, huge defeat,</p>
<p>$2 trillion. You have this Aukus thing where it looks like France</p>
<p>is now pulling off and you know, from from NATO or the EU is</p>
<p>doing their own thing. I think that China is and then China is</p>
<p>really already predominant in many ways in Asia. And the US</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t care about the area as much. I mean, who wants to</p>
<p>start another gigantic war over this? Certainly, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>the people of America do after after 20 years of forever war.</p>
<p>And so and China really cares about Taiwan, they really care</p>
<p>about their backyard. So whether that&rsquo;s a war, or whether that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a referendum on Taiwan, or whether it&rsquo;s some unpredictable</p>
<p>event like COVID, I don&rsquo;t know. But I do think that China does</p>
<p>have some Monroe doctrine like thing that it gets to within</p>
<p>Asia, where basically it says, you know, just like the US said,</p>
<p>Hey, you know, we&rsquo;re running this hemisphere, they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re running the sector of things, whether that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>military conflict, where the US decides to just withdraw, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know. And then I think what has to happen is, we have</p>
<p>to figure out what the decentralized West looks like an</p>
<p>asymmetric response to China, because it&rsquo;s going to basically</p>
<p>be the number one centralized state in the world, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna be able to combat it head on militarily, it&rsquo;s just, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s got like 10x growth in front of it, it&rsquo;s already a</p>
<p>monster. Unless there&rsquo;s some assassination or revolution or</p>
<p>something crazy like that, that&rsquo;s hard to predict. If it</p>
<p>manages what it&rsquo;s got, it&rsquo;s got like, it&rsquo;s like Google 2010,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got 10 years of that in front of it. And whether it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>Chinese decade or Chinese century, I think depends on</p>
<p>whether we can build the technologies to defend freedom,</p>
<p>meaning like encryption, meaning, you know,</p>
<p>decentralized social networks, meaning these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the only I think, kinds of tools that are going to</p>
<p>help us whether it&rsquo;s drones, whether it&rsquo;s other kinds of</p>
<p>things, asymmetric defense versus what they&rsquo;re going to be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to just be a deus ex machina.</p>
<p>I think I look, I think that&rsquo;s a great point to end on Jason,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s other stuff we want to talk about. So what are</p>
<p>the things that you know, apologies commented on that I</p>
<p>give them, you know, a tremendous amount of credit for</p>
<p>is corporate is the idea of corporate journalism. In fact,</p>
<p>biology, you&rsquo;re the first person I heard that term from corporate</p>
<p>journalism, which is a recognition that all of these</p>
<p>reporters actually are employees of companies, and they have a</p>
<p>company culture, and they often have they have owners, the</p>
<p>companies do, those owners often have an agenda, there&rsquo;s often a</p>
<p>dogma inside these corporations. And, and it really got me to see</p>
<p>journalism in a new light, because these journalists</p>
<p>portray themselves as the high priest of the truth, who are</p>
<p>there to speak truth to power. And actually, they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>just kind of the lowest paid functionaries on the corporate</p>
<p>totem pole. And, and, you know, in contradistinction to what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve called citizen journalists, who are people who</p>
<p>are writing what they see as the truth in blogs, or, you know,</p>
<p>formats like this, where they are not getting paid for it, you</p>
<p>know, we&rsquo;re doing it because we want to put forward what we know</p>
<p>to be the truth. And actually, I&rsquo;d love to hear you speak to</p>
<p>that, because I think this is like one of the most powerful</p>
<p>ideas that I&rsquo;ve heard you put forward.</p>
<p>Sure. So, so much I can say about this. The first thing I</p>
<p>would do is I&rsquo;d recommend a book that recently came out by Ashley</p>
<p>Rinsberg, called The Grey Lady winked. And the reason it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>important, and I put it up there, frankly, with top five</p>
<p>books I&rsquo;d recommend, I know, I&rsquo;ve recommended other books,</p>
<p>top five books, I&rsquo;d recommend Grey Lady winked, it goes back</p>
<p>through the archives, you know, the New York Times calls</p>
<p>themselves the paper of record, they call themselves, you know,</p>
<p>the first draft of history, they&rsquo;ve literally run billboards,</p>
<p>calling themselves the truth. But it&rsquo;s just owned by some</p>
<p>random family in New York. And, you know, this guy, Arthur</p>
<p>Salzberger, who inherited it from his father&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s</p>
<p>father. And so you have this, like, random rich white guy in</p>
<p>New York, who literally tries to determine what is true for the</p>
<p>entire world, his employees write something down, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to believe that this is true. And I simply just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe that that model is operative anymore. Because I</p>
<p>think truth is mathematical truth. It&rsquo;s cryptographic</p>
<p>truth. It&rsquo;s true that one can check for oneself, rather than,</p>
<p>you know, argument from authority, it&rsquo;s argument from</p>
<p>cryptography. And, you know, one of the things with Bitcoin with</p>
<p>cryptocurrencies is given decentralized way of checking on</p>
<p>that. Now, to the point about corporate media, it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>literally corporations, these are publicly traded companies</p>
<p>with financial statements and quarterly, you know, reports and</p>
<p>goals and revenue targets. And so once you, you know, kind of</p>
<p>are on the inside of one of these operations, you realize</p>
<p>that that hit piece, or what have you is being graded in the</p>
<p>spreadsheet for how many likes and RTS it gets on Twitter. And</p>
<p>if it gets more, they&rsquo;re going to do more pieces like that flood</p>
<p>the zone with that. And if it doesn&rsquo;t, then they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>do less. And they&rsquo;re all conscious of this. You know, for</p>
<p>example, Nicholas Kristof wrote an article, I think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the articles, no one reads articles, someone will read</p>
<p>where you notice that his Trump columns get something like 5x</p>
<p>more views than his other columns, it&rsquo;s like a huge ratio.</p>
<p>And so at least some folks there are privy to their to their page</p>
<p>views. So and of course, they&rsquo;re looking at their Twitter likes</p>
<p>and RTS, even if they, those are not directly page views there,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re certainly correlated with pages on the article. So</p>
<p>all these folks are literally employees of for profit</p>
<p>corporations are trying to maximize their profits. But we</p>
<p>believe them when they mark themselves as the truth, like</p>
<p>the NYT, or as democracy itself, like the Washington Post, or</p>
<p>fair and balanced, like Fox, these people equate themselves</p>
<p>with like truth, democracy and fairness. They weren&rsquo;t exactly</p>
<p>around at the founding. Okay, they weren&rsquo;t they weren&rsquo;t part</p>
<p>of the Constitution in 7076, the post offices, but these media</p>
<p>corporations were started later on and have kind of glommed</p>
<p>themselves on and declare themselves like part of the</p>
<p>establishment, you know, and and they are not. And the last</p>
<p>point, and I&rsquo;ll just, you know, give you guys, you know, the</p>
<p>Florentines, but we didn&rsquo;t go and say, Oh, BlackBerry do</p>
<p>better. Blockbuster do better. Barnes and Noble do better. We</p>
<p>just replace them disrupted them with better technological</p>
<p>versions. And so the idea that Oh, you know, New York Times do</p>
<p>better. That&rsquo;s completely outmoded way of thinking about</p>
<p>it, we need to disrupt, we need to replace, we need to build</p>
<p>better things, we need to have things that have like on chain</p>
<p>fact checking that have voices from overseas, that have voices</p>
<p>that are actually experts in their own fields that have</p>
<p>voices that are not necessarily corrupted by what you mean by</p>
<p>on chain fact checking. Ah, give an example. So this is this is</p>
<p>a very deep area. But fundamentally, the breakthrough</p>
<p>of Bitcoin was that an Israeli and a Palestinian or a Democrat</p>
<p>and Republican or a Japanese person, a Chinese person, all</p>
<p>agree on who has what Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is</p>
<p>essentially a way of in a low trust environment, but a high</p>
<p>computation environment, you can use computation to establish</p>
<p>mutually agreed upon facts. And these facts are who owns what</p>
<p>million or billion of the roughly trillion dollars on the</p>
<p>Bitcoin blockchain. And that&rsquo;s the kind of thing that&rsquo;s I mean,</p>
<p>people will fight over a $10,000 shed, you know, when when you</p>
<p>can establish global truth over a byte, which says, you know, do</p>
<p>you have 20 or five or 10 BTC, you can actually generalize that</p>
<p>to establish global truth on any other financial instrument. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s tokens, and that&rsquo;s, you know, loans and derivatives. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge part of the economy. And then you can</p>
<p>generalize it further to establish other kinds of</p>
<p>assertions. And that gets a little bit further afield, but</p>
<p>not just, you know, proof of work and proof of stake, but</p>
<p>things like proof of location, or proof of identity. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>various other facts you can put on there. So you start actually</p>
<p>accumulating what I think of is not the paper of record, but the</p>
<p>ledger of record, a ledger of all these facts that some of</p>
<p>them are written by so called Crypto Oracle, some of them</p>
<p>arise out of smart contracts, but this is what you refer to.</p>
<p>And as a today model of what that looks like, it&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>like how when someone links a tweet to prove that something</p>
<p>happened, people link an on chain record to prove that</p>
<p>something happened. Concrete example, do you guys remember</p>
<p>when Vitalik Buterin made that large donation earlier this</p>
<p>year? Yes. Okay, so you want to talk about that? Explain what</p>
<p>happened? I think that you basically tweeted out something</p>
<p>that was essentially trying to raise money to secure necessary</p>
<p>equipment and pharmaceutical supplies to India during a</p>
<p>pretty bad COVID outbreak. And then I think you you decided</p>
<p>that you were going to donate some money and then Vitalik</p>
<p>basically stepped up and actually gave quite a large</p>
<p>sum. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure the exact number of all that.</p>
<p>Yeah. So it was it was an enormous amount in illiquid</p>
<p>terms of, of this meme coin, these Shibu coins. But the thing</p>
<p>is that everybody when they when they wanted to prove that this</p>
<p>has happened, because it&rsquo;s so unbelievable, such a large</p>
<p>amount of money was marked it on the on the order of a billion</p>
<p>when he gave it, do how they proved that they didn&rsquo;t link a</p>
<p>tweet, they linked a block Explorer. Okay, like an on chain</p>
<p>record that showed that this debit and this credit happened.</p>
<p>And the big thing about this is, you know, we take for granted</p>
<p>when you link a tweet, you&rsquo;re taking for granted that Twitter</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t monkeyed with it. But guess what, Twitter monkeys with</p>
<p>a lot of tweets, he says, a lot of people get disappeared. And</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not actually that good a record of what happened</p>
<p>anymore. This is deleted, this guy got suspended this, you</p>
<p>know, like, even the Trump stuff, forget about like Trump</p>
<p>himself. But that historical archive of what happened, you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t link it anymore. It&rsquo;s link rotted just from that, like, I</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s one of the 1000 most important things about it. But</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an important thing.</p>
<p>In the example of say, Taiwan, and China believing Taiwan is</p>
<p>part of the one China concept, and Taiwan believes it is a</p>
<p>country and everybody in the world has a different vote on</p>
<p>that. How does the blockchain clarify? What is the fact about</p>
<p>is China a country? Or is it a province?</p>
<p>Very good question doesn&rsquo;t happen. Well, what it does is it</p>
<p>clarifies the facts about the metadata, who asserted that it</p>
<p>was a country and who asserted that it was a province? And what</p>
<p>time did they do so? And, you know, what money, how much BTC</p>
<p>did they put behind that, or what have you, so it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give you everything. But it does start to give you unambiguous,</p>
<p>like proof of who and proof of when and proof of what, and then</p>
<p>from that, at least, yeah, I mean, like the way, the way I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>kind of explained it to family members who&rsquo;ve asked is, you</p>
<p>know, that the concept of a chain is difficult, I think, for</p>
<p>people to that aren&rsquo;t, you know, have don&rsquo;t have a background in</p>
<p>computer science really grok is like, but everyone understands</p>
<p>the concept of a database, you know, there&rsquo;s a bunch of data in</p>
<p>there, except in this case, the data that makes up the database</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s being verified by everyone. And it&rsquo;s distributed.</p>
<p>So everyone has a copy of it.</p>
<p>I want to know what you guys think about this week in the</p>
<p>Facebook dumpster fire. Let&rsquo;s move to something splashy.</p>
<p>And can you say one thing? There&rsquo;s a book Friedberg on what</p>
<p>you just mentioned, which is called the truth machine by Casey</p>
<p>and Vigna. And it gives a pop culture explanation of the</p>
<p>ledger of record type concepts I just mentioned,</p>
<p>which which I don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people</p>
<p>grok at biology to your point. And I think, you know, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>skipping past it. But it&rsquo;s a really important point, which is</p>
<p>historically, databases have sat on someone servers, and</p>
<p>whoever has those servers decides what data goes in the</p>
<p>database and how they&rsquo;re edited and what&rsquo;s allowed to come out</p>
<p>of the database. So in this notion, generally, a database</p>
<p>with information and it can be held by lots of people who</p>
<p>generally as a group kind of vote and decide what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>go into it. And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the power of decentralization</p>
<p>and how it changes, you know, the information economy, which</p>
<p>drives the world. And it&rsquo;s going to have a lot of implications,</p>
<p>right? Facebook&rsquo;s worst month ever continues. We talked last</p>
<p>week about Facebook having a lead internal leak called the</p>
<p>Facebook papers. This is a continuous leak to not only the</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal, but apparently members of Congress</p>
<p>are also getting it and the leaker and the SEC and the SEC</p>
<p>and the leaker apparently works in the safety group, according</p>
<p>to a congressperson who has been getting it and they are going to</p>
<p>uncloak themselves, and that they were leaking this out of</p>
<p>frustration, that there is human trafficking, democracy issues,</p>
<p>and obviously self harm in girls using Instagram. And, you know,</p>
<p>this research, but that&rsquo;s not all Facebook is admitting for</p>
<p>the first time this week that Apple&rsquo;s privacy updates are</p>
<p>hurting their ad business. And I think the story you&rsquo;re referring</p>
<p>to is that two groups of Facebook shareholders are</p>
<p>claiming that the company paid billions of extra dollars to the</p>
<p>FTC to spare Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg from</p>
<p>depositions and personal liability in the Cambridge</p>
<p>Analytica saga. From the political Politico article,</p>
<p>quote, Zuckerberg, Sandberg and other Facebook directors agreed</p>
<p>to authorize a multi billion dollar settlement the FTC as an</p>
<p>express quid pro quo to protect Zuckerberg from being named in</p>
<p>the FTCs complaint made subject to personal liability or even</p>
<p>required to sit for a deposition. According to the</p>
<p>article, the initial penalty was 106 million. But the company</p>
<p>agreed to pay 50 times more 5 billion to have Zuck and</p>
<p>Sandberg spared from depositions liability. Here is the money</p>
<p>quote, the board has never provided this from the group of</p>
<p>shareholders suing the board has never provided a serious check</p>
<p>on Zuckerberg unfettered authority instead, it has</p>
<p>enabled him defended him and paid him paid billions of</p>
<p>dollars for Facebook&rsquo;s corporate coffers to make his problems go</p>
<p>I have one prediction. The Facebook whistleblower. You</p>
<p>know, when you are a federal whistleblower, number one is you</p>
<p>get legal protection. But number two, which people don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about much as you actually get a large share of the fines that</p>
<p>are paid by the act of your whistleblowing. You know, there</p>
<p>was a couple of SEC claims that I think were settled last year,</p>
<p>where the whistleblower got paid, I think, like 115 odd</p>
<p>million dollars or something, and just an enormous amount of</p>
<p>money. And the SEC has done a fabulous job. And, you know,</p>
<p>using whistleblowers as a mechanism of getting after</p>
<p>folks. And, you know, I think the SEC said they&rsquo;ve collected</p>
<p>almost a billion dollars since this whistleblower program</p>
<p>started that they&rsquo;ve paid out or something just an enormous</p>
<p>amount. And I had this interesting observation, which</p>
<p>is, this person leaked a bunch of stuff or whistle blew to the</p>
<p>Senate to Congress to the SEC, there probably will be an</p>
<p>enormous fine. This person may actually make billions of</p>
<p>dollars, which will then make every other employee at</p>
<p>Facebook really angry about why they didn&rsquo;t leak it first,</p>
<p>because all I guess all this stuff was sitting around. And</p>
<p>apparently now they&rsquo;ve shut it down, right. So that entire data</p>
<p>repository around this whole topic is no longer freely</p>
<p>available for employees to peruse. So</p>
<p>what under a key tam thing?</p>
<p>Well, I think it was more like, like, I guess, like, all of this</p>
<p>data was sitting inside of some Facebook internal server.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I mean, what this this leaker makes money under</p>
<p>like key tam.</p>
<p>So the SEC will pay for information that results in a</p>
<p>fine. And so they just recently announced that they paid out</p>
<p>$114 million whistleblower payment that was the highest</p>
<p>ever. And that they this whistleblowers extraordinary</p>
<p>actions and high quality information prove crucial to</p>
<p>successful enforcement actions. I don&rsquo;t think they announce all</p>
<p>of these whistleblower payouts, they just pay them. So they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s my one observation is I actually think</p>
<p>this whistleblower may make billions of dollars. So more</p>
<p>than any of us made at Facebook, which I think is hilarious. But</p>
<p>the second thing, which is more important is that there was an</p>
<p>article in the Wall Street Journal about how sentiment</p>
<p>amongst Americans have now really meaningfully changed. And</p>
<p>I Jason, I don&rsquo;t know if you have those stats. But this is a</p>
<p>plurality of democrats and republicans where it&rsquo;s like 80%</p>
<p>of anybody now basically says the government needs to check</p>
<p>big tech.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal published an article yesterday</p>
<p>highlighting a new poll conducted for the future of tech</p>
<p>commission, it found that 80% of registered voters 83% dem 78%</p>
<p>repubs agreed that the federal government quote, needs to do</p>
<p>everything it can to curb influence of big tech companies</p>
<p>that have grown too powerful, and now use our data to reach</p>
<p>far into our lives findings are based on a survey of 2000 or so</p>
<p>registered voters.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really, really, really tough road that these</p>
<p>guys will have to navigate these next few years.</p>
<p>Can I can I offer some contrary views here? Yeah, please. So, um,</p>
<p>you know, the whistleblower thing, you know, real</p>
<p>whistleblowers, in my view are like Snowden or Sanjay, who are,</p>
<p>you know, basically overseas and, or in prison for for telling</p>
<p>what the US government is doing. And the difference is, I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re whistleblowing, if accepted and acted upon would</p>
<p>reduce the power of the US government. Whereas these, you</p>
<p>know, kind of awards and so on, I think they they do distort</p>
<p>incentives. It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re giving a billion</p>
<p>dollars to Snowden for blowing the whistle on the NSA, the</p>
<p>military industrial complex is not happy with that. But this</p>
<p>money is being given because government is currently mad at</p>
<p>Facebook and wants to do something that is like a quasi</p>
<p>nationalization of Facebook. Now, very similar to what</p>
<p>happened in China, where basically all the tech CEOs,</p>
<p>they just do it much more explicitly there. They just</p>
<p>basically decapitate all them say, okay, you&rsquo;re going, you</p>
<p>know, spending time with your family. In the US, it&rsquo;s done in</p>
<p>this sort of denied way, and so on. But the US government</p>
<p>getting more control over Facebook is not a solution to</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s real problems. It&rsquo;s just going to mean backdoor</p>
<p>surveillance of everything, every single thing that was</p>
<p>pushed back on every end to end encryption thing that they</p>
<p>implemented. Now, the Keystone cops in the US government, not</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t just surveil everything, then their database</p>
<p>gets leaked. And it&rsquo;s all on the internet, just like what</p>
<p>happened under the solar winds hack. So I&rsquo;m not denying that</p>
<p>there are, you know, like bad things about Facebook, I</p>
<p>actually think on net, it&rsquo;s probably being more beneficial</p>
<p>than many people say. But I don&rsquo;t believe that the federal</p>
<p>government is a solution to those problems. I think the</p>
<p>solution looks more like decentralized social networking,</p>
<p>where people have control over their own data, not simply the</p>
<p>US government quasi nationalizing the thing.</p>
<p>So, you know, people bring up this decentralized social</p>
<p>network thing, and as if it is a better solution, I think you</p>
<p>believe it&rsquo;s a better solution. But I rarely hear anybody talk</p>
<p>about, well, if there&rsquo;s slander on a decentralized network, if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s child pornography, if your personal banking</p>
<p>information, or your, you know, you were personally hacked, and</p>
<p>that information was put on a decentralized social network,</p>
<p>that cannot be reversed and stopped, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>decentralized, correct?</p>
<p>It depends. You know, the thing is, it&rsquo;s basically about why does</p>
<p>it depend, you just said that the blockchain couldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>changed, and that all the facts were permanent. So why does it</p>
<p>depend now?</p>
<p>Well, for something like child porn, for example, it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>being used for that you&rsquo;re not going to find lots of people who</p>
<p>are running those nodes. It is, it&rsquo;s something where edge cases</p>
<p>are always used to attack something. There&rsquo;s a famous</p>
<p>cartoon, which says, How do you want this wrapped, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called control of the internet. And it&rsquo;s either protect children</p>
<p>or stop terrorists, right. And so when we talk about an edge</p>
<p>case like that, I mean, the CSAM stuff, child porn, you know,</p>
<p>that was that&rsquo;s used by Apple to justify intrusive devices that</p>
<p>are scanning everybody&rsquo;s stuff. The I think the answer to a lot</p>
<p>of those things is, if you&rsquo;re doing something that&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s usually ways of going after it, that don&rsquo;t involve</p>
<p>this gigantic surveillance state that was after all only built,</p>
<p>or in the last 10 or 20 years, just normal police work that you</p>
<p>can do. If they&rsquo;re actually like, you know, a bad guy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other forms of police work, you can get search</p>
<p>warrants, you don&rsquo;t have this completely lawless thing, where</p>
<p>you just, you know, some guy in San Francisco hits a button, and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re digitally executed. And so, so, you know, it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t any possibility for rule of law, it&rsquo;s just that it</p>
<p>has to actually be exercised in this.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re on listen, I think we&rsquo;re a long way away from</p>
<p>decentralized social networking actually being the norm or being</p>
<p>a solution, Jason, I think we&rsquo;re at the step of actually</p>
<p>figuring out how much tolerance we have for probably</p>
<p>specifically Facebook and Google&rsquo;s specific business</p>
<p>models. And it&rsquo;s those business models that I think are coming</p>
<p>up against privacy, they theoretically now, and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>figure this out, maybe coming up against mental health, and you</p>
<p>know, our child welfare policies, and what we all view</p>
<p>about that. And those are fundamentally governmental</p>
<p>issues that they should adjudicate. And I think the more</p>
<p>important thing that I take away from all of this is that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>all kind of let it probably get a little bit too far. And I</p>
<p>think now that there&rsquo;s a plurality, something&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>happen, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be right. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be just it&rsquo;s kind of like trying to perform surgery</p>
<p>with a rusty knife. There&rsquo;s going to be all kinds of</p>
<p>collateral damage, specifically to how to police Facebook,</p>
<p>Twitter, social networks, I think it&rsquo;s just like social</p>
<p>media, I think we&rsquo;ve jumped the shark at this point. And I think</p>
<p>folks will want to</p>
<p>decentralization as the solution, like biology.</p>
<p>I do think that that&rsquo;s the ultimate solution for two key</p>
<p>things. One is, the most important thing that we all want</p>
<p>is to know what the actual economic relationship we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having with folks that we spend time with this. So when we spend</p>
<p>time with friends, that&rsquo;s friendship, there&rsquo;s no economic</p>
<p>relationship there necessarily, okay. When we spend time with a</p>
<p>lot of these applications, there is a subtle economic</p>
<p>relationship that is actually hidden from us, which is that we</p>
<p>believe we&rsquo;re getting value for free. But really, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening is we&rsquo;re giving back a bunch of information that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know. When you move to a world of decentralization, you</p>
<p>shine a light on how people make money, and you allow us to vote.</p>
<p>Do I want it? Do I not that single feature will provide more</p>
<p>clarity for people than any of this other stuff will, because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll force people to then step into an economic relationship</p>
<p>with these organizations. And I think that that&rsquo;s just fair,</p>
<p>because those folks should be allowed to make money. But we</p>
<p>should also be allowed to know what the consequences are and</p>
<p>then decide.</p>
<p>David, you are a big proponent of freedom of speech. We saw</p>
<p>massive election interference, the Russians trying to use</p>
<p>social media to create division, other countries doing it to each</p>
<p>other. It&rsquo;s not just the US and Russia, it&rsquo;s China and Russia</p>
<p>and everybody doing it to each other. Do you believe that</p>
<p>something like election interference and those bots</p>
<p>would be solved or it would get worse because of</p>
<p>decentralization? Are you a fan of decentralization? Or would</p>
<p>you rather have a centralized Facebook, Twitter and somebody</p>
<p>responsible like Zuckerberg or jack to mitigate this for</p>
<p>democracies around the world?</p>
<p>Well, the problem that we have is we do have a problem of</p>
<p>social networks spreading lies and misinformation. However, the</p>
<p>people who are in charge of censoring those social networks</p>
<p>keep getting it wrong. So they allow disinformation to be</p>
<p>spread by official channels, whether it&rsquo;s, you know, you</p>
<p>know, whether it&rsquo;s a corporate journalist,</p>
<p>Are you going to say Dr. Fauci?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many official channels that get things wrong.</p>
<p>We talked last week about the Rolling Stone ivermectin hoax.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been absolutely no censorship of that manifestly</p>
<p>wrong story. There&rsquo;s no labeling of it. But then a subjective</p>
<p>opinion, like what Dave Portnoy posted about AOC, attending the</p>
<p>Met Gala, which can&rsquo;t be factually wrong, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just him, an opinion that gets fact checked and labeled. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bizarre. So the situation we have today is we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>preventing misinformation. We&rsquo;re just enforcing the cultural and</p>
<p>political biases of the people who have the power. And that is</p>
<p>always a problem with censorship. And this is why I</p>
<p>agree with Justice Brandeis when he said that, you know, the</p>
<p>sunlight&rsquo;s the best disinfectant, the answer to bad</p>
<p>speech is more speech. We need to have more free and open</p>
<p>marketplaces of ideas. And that ultimately is how you prevent</p>
<p>disinformation.</p>
<p>So decentralized Twitter, decentralized social networks,</p>
<p>do you think that is too much sunlight, and too unruly, the</p>
<p>fact that things could be spread on there?</p>
<p>And well, I&rsquo;d like to see what those things look like when we</p>
<p>actually have them. It&rsquo;s I agree with Martha, we&rsquo;re still some</p>
<p>ways off from that.</p>
<p>Are we? I mean, but can I say a few things? Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>Because I think we have these out there, isn&rsquo;t mastodon out</p>
<p>there and other services out there, and they&rsquo;re contending</p>
<p>with these very issues. So by the way, it&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>philosophy was not sorry, sorry, apology, I just say one thing</p>
<p>before you go. But like this, this general philosophy is not</p>
<p>novel. You know, the internet and the word being called the</p>
<p>tech platforms were meant to be the response to the undue</p>
<p>influence that kind of Americans thought existed already in the</p>
<p>media when they emerged in the late 90s. And, you know, you can</p>
<p>go back hundreds of years, like the state was meant to be the</p>
<p>response to the church. And, you know, the media was meant to be</p>
<p>the response to the state and propaganda. And then the tech</p>
<p>companies were meant to be the response to media. And, you</p>
<p>know, now we&rsquo;re talking about decentralization be kind of</p>
<p>being the response to tech. And at some point, you know,</p>
<p>information accrues in this kind of asymmetric way. And it be</p>
<p>called becomes called that undue influencer. And that I think</p>
<p>ends up becoming the recurring battle that we&rsquo;ll continue to</p>
<p>see whether or not this notion of decentralized systems</p>
<p>actually is the endpoint or is just the next stepping stone in</p>
<p>the evolution. That is this constant kind of evolving cat</p>
<p>and mouse game of where does the information lie, who has</p>
<p>control over it, and who&rsquo;s influencing people ends up kind</p>
<p>of being I think, the big narrative that we&rsquo;ll kind of</p>
<p>realize over the next couple decades. But I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>biology, if it becomes the endpoint, right? I mean, this</p>
<p>is this feels to me part of a longer form narrative.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think like lots of things look cyclic, if you look</p>
<p>at them on like this, if you look from the z axis is more</p>
<p>like a helix where you do make progress, even if it seems</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going in a loop. And so I think, you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>centralized, then you decentralize and you</p>
<p>recentralize. It&rsquo;s like the concept of unbundling and</p>
<p>bundling, you unbundle the, the CD into individual mp3s, you</p>
<p>rebundle into playlists, right. And so with decentralized media,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not purely every single node on their own. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more like a million hubs and a billion spokes. And Jason, to</p>
<p>your point, basically, most of those hubs are not going to</p>
<p>allow things that 99.99% of people think are bad, like see</p>
<p>Sam, you know, as for other things like, you know, slander,</p>
<p>hack documents, you mentioned, the thing is current central</p>
<p>arbiters will falsely accuse people of these things or</p>
<p>enforce them in political ways. It&rsquo;s the centralization is</p>
<p>actually also not a solution is being abused as sacks, you know,</p>
<p>points out, in fact, official disinformation early in COVID,</p>
<p>which, you know, I had to like, basically be back with a stick,</p>
<p>fortunately, you know, got some of it out in time. But, you</p>
<p>know, people said the flu is more serious, the travel bans</p>
<p>were overreactions that only Wuhan visitors were at risk,</p>
<p>that avoiding handshakes is paranoid, that the virus is</p>
<p>contained, tests are available, masks don&rsquo;t help, you know, all</p>
<p>that stuff, the Surgeon General himself, you know, tweeted out,</p>
<p>you know, people don&rsquo;t wear masks, right? BuzzFeed, you</p>
<p>know, NYT, all these guys got the story wrong, and then they</p>
<p>rewrote history to pretend that they didn&rsquo;t. So that to me is a</p>
<p>much greater danger when you have a single source of truth</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s false.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re picking the least bad solution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a good point, because I&rsquo;m old enough to remember when</p>
<p>Balaji was right. About everything related to the</p>
<p>beginning of COVID. And I&rsquo;m old enough to remember when in April</p>
<p>of last year, I wrote a piece in favor of masks, when the WHO and</p>
<p>the Surgeon General and all these official channels were</p>
<p>saying don&rsquo;t wear masks. So the problem is with with this, these</p>
<p>with official censorship, is that they keep getting it wrong.</p>
<p>They keep getting it wrong. And I want to hold on, I want to</p>
<p>bring up one more one more quick point. Okay, Jason, you</p>
<p>mentioned foreign interference on Facebook, I would really</p>
<p>encourage anybody who&rsquo;s concerned about that issue, to</p>
<p>look up you can go look, you just Google the actual ads that</p>
<p>were run by agents of the FSB on Facebook. During the 2016</p>
<p>election, you can actually see the ads they ran. I want to make</p>
<p>two points about that. Number one, the ads are ridiculous.</p>
<p>They are. They are sort of like an absurd. You know, foreigners</p>
<p>perspective.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re me me with bad English. Yes.</p>
<p>Bad English. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s somebody who doesn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>American culture&rsquo;s attempt to propagandize an American and you</p>
<p>look at it, it&rsquo;s so ham handed. Let me give an example. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, in one of them, they&rsquo;ve got Jesus arm wrestling with the</p>
<p>devil, sayings, and it&rsquo;s Jesus saying that I support Trump, and</p>
<p>the devil saying I support Hillary Clinton. I mean,</p>
<p>literally stuff like that. Okay, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>utterly you&rsquo;d see at a Trump rally,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s utterly absurd, and nobody would ever be convinced by it.</p>
<p>The second thing is, the second, the second thing about it is</p>
<p>that when you actually look at the number of impressions that</p>
<p>were created by the sum total of all of these, so the so called</p>
<p>disinformation of all these ads, it is a fractionally small, if</p>
<p>intestinal drop in the ocean compared to the total number</p>
<p>of impressions on Facebook. And so I&rsquo;m not disputing the fact</p>
<p>that somebody in the basement somewhere in Moscow, perhaps was</p>
<p>running</p>
<p>so it was proven. It was like hundreds of people</p>
<p>was running some sort of disinformation operation that was</p>
<p>running ads on Facebook. What I am saying is that when you</p>
<p>actually look at the effect, and quantitatively and</p>
<p>qualitatively, you realize that that whole story was massively</p>
<p>brought blown up abortion in order to create an hysteria that</p>
<p>then justify censorship, then justifies the empowerment by</p>
<p>centralized authorities to be able to regulate to be able to</p>
<p>regulate these social networks with the effect that the people</p>
<p>in power end up censoring in ways that do not support the</p>
<p>truth, but actually just reinforce their own power. That</p>
<p>is what the disinformation story is really about.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s really about sacks is that Russia wants</p>
<p>to pit people like you and me against each other, you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>leaning on left leaning and what they want to do is create this</p>
<p>moment where you and I are fighting over this instead of</p>
<p>fighting Russia. Russia has this as a strategy to demoralize us.</p>
<p>And this is classic KGB technique. So battles back and</p>
<p>forth between Americans so we don&rsquo;t fight against</p>
<p>I have no interest in fighting Russia per se. I&rsquo;m not interested</p>
<p>in picking fights with foreign countries.</p>
<p>And you should want to fight against Russian interference.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m also not engaging in a fight with fellow Americans. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>attempting to de propagandize fellow Americans who&rsquo;ve been led</p>
<p>to believe that Russian interference in the election was</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it didn&rsquo;t happen. But they&rsquo;ve been led to we know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been led happened, but they&rsquo;ve been led to believe that</p>
<p>it was a greater threat than it actually was in order to empower</p>
<p>centralized authorities to engage in censorship over social</p>
<p>network. So I&rsquo;m trying to essentially deprogram an</p>
<p>enormous amount of programming that&rsquo;s taken place. I do not</p>
<p>consider that to be fighting with fellow Americans.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the point is, you have the GOP recounting votes,</p>
<p>even to this day, saying the election was stolen. And then</p>
<p>you have on the left, you have the Democrats saying, Russia won</p>
<p>the election for Trump. In both cases, these are probably</p>
<p>factually incorrect.</p>
<p>In our last podcast, I cited the piece by Rich Lowry, which he is</p>
<p>the editor of National Review, speaking to conservatives saying</p>
<p>that this whole stolen election myth, yes, he called it a myth</p>
<p>is an albatross is it is nothing, it will do nothing but</p>
<p>backfire on conservatives and Republicans. I think there are</p>
<p>plenty of people who recognize that story to be what it is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about something very different here.</p>
<p>I kind of just want to pivot forward a little bit. And I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a good question with biology on on the line. But</p>
<p>yeah, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s use let&rsquo;s assume we move forward to this</p>
<p>decentralized model where there isn&rsquo;t a central media platform</p>
<p>that adjudicates content and makes it available to to the</p>
<p>users of the platform. So now in a decentralized world, take</p>
<p>to take YouTube, for example, YouTube has an application</p>
<p>layer, which is the website we all use to access the videos,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a recommendation list that pops up. And then all</p>
<p>the media that that exists on the YouTube platform sits on</p>
<p>some servers. And so the application is how I&rsquo;m kind of</p>
<p>selecting what media to watch. But that&rsquo;s kind of being</p>
<p>projected to me because of the recommendations being made by</p>
<p>Google and the search function. If you guys remember, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you guys are old enough. But you know, in the early 90s,</p>
<p>we were all on gopher boards, and we were trying to find</p>
<p>information. And it was a total cluster, right? I mean, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just like, nowhere, no way to kind of find what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking for. And so search became kind of the great</p>
<p>unlock right and use that and search became the great unlock</p>
<p>for, you know, for accessing content on this distributed</p>
<p>network that we call the internet. Now in the future, if</p>
<p>all of the YouTube media is decentralized and sits on</p>
<p>distributed servers and sits on a chain or whatever, what is</p>
<p>the application layer look like biology? Because how do you end</p>
<p>up giving users are ultimately going to have to pick an</p>
<p>application or pick a tool to help them access media to help</p>
<p>them access information. And there has to be to some degree a</p>
<p>search function or an algorithmic function that</p>
<p>creates the list of what content to read, or they simply</p>
<p>subscribing to nodes on the network. And that&rsquo;s kind of the</p>
<p>future of decentralization where there&rsquo;s no longer a search a</p>
<p>recommendation function, but there is simply a subscription</p>
<p>function. And I think that that to me is kind of a big</p>
<p>philosophical question, because from a user experience</p>
<p>perspective, people want things easy and simple, they want to</p>
<p>have things recommended to them, they want to have a bunch of a</p>
<p>list of things, and they click down the list, and they&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure most people as we saw in web 2.0, when there were</p>
<p>all these, like, you know, make your own website stuff, and you</p>
<p>had RSS feeds, and that all died, because it was complicated,</p>
<p>and it was difficult, and it wasn&rsquo;t great content for most</p>
<p>people, they prefer having stuff presented to them. So do we just</p>
<p>end up with like 10 2030 subscription applications that</p>
<p>create different algorithms and different kind of access points</p>
<p>for the content? Or are people just living in a subscription</p>
<p>universe in a decentralized world? When it comes to media?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question. So I think, first, we have some</p>
<p>vision of what that world looks like already. Because if you</p>
<p>think about block explorers, and exchanges and wallets, and much</p>
<p>of the rest of the crypto ecosystem, they are all clients</p>
<p>to the Bitcoin and Ethereum and other blockchains, right? So,</p>
<p>you know, I wrote this post called, Yes, you may need a</p>
<p>blockchain, where, you know, people have said, Oh, blockchains</p>
<p>are just slow databases. And that&rsquo;s like saying the early</p>
<p>iPhone camera is just a poor camera. Yes, it was worse on one</p>
<p>dimension, you know, image quality, but it was far better</p>
<p>on other dimensions, namely, the fact that it was ubiquitous, it</p>
<p>was always with you, it was free, it was bundled, it was</p>
<p>programmable, it was connected to a network and so on. And so</p>
<p>blockchains, yes, they have lower transaction throughput,</p>
<p>but they are 1000x or more on another dimension, which is the</p>
<p>number of simultaneous root users. That&rsquo;s to say it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>blockchain is a massively multiplayer database, where</p>
<p>every user is a root user. That&rsquo;s meaning everybody can</p>
<p>read the rows in the Bitcoin blockchain. And anybody who has</p>
<p>some Bitcoin can write a row that&rsquo;s a debit or a credit to</p>
<p>someone else. Anybody with compute can mine blocks. Okay,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s open and permissionless. Similarly, for a decentralized</p>
<p>social network could operate in a similar way. Whereas, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say something like Twitter, or PayPal, the root password is not</p>
<p>public, nobody can can access it. And so what this leads to,</p>
<p>to kind of continue your point is basically, I think, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically been three eras of the internet. The first was p2p,</p>
<p>which was, you know, peer to peer, right. And so individual</p>
<p>nodes are point to point communicating, and that&rsquo;s FTP.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it was telnet before SSH address. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Right. And so the great thing about this is open source is</p>
<p>peer to peer is fully programmable, you can see</p>
<p>everything, right? Then, because of search, because of social,</p>
<p>because of the rise of the second era MVC model view</p>
<p>controller, essentially, many protocols like social networking</p>
<p>or search are not efficient. If every node is pinging every</p>
<p>other node, you can&rsquo;t ping every other node with the index of the</p>
<p>web, you can&rsquo;t ping every other node with Facebook&rsquo;s entire</p>
<p>social graph, when you know, you go and message somebody, you</p>
<p>want a central hub with their photos and stuff. So you can</p>
<p>just send a few packets back and forth, right. And this led</p>
<p>to the, you know, the last 15 years, these gigantic hubs last</p>
<p>20 years, these giant hubs, search and social and messaging,</p>
<p>two side of marketplaces, hub and spoke architecture. And</p>
<p>these hubs have global state, and they&rsquo;re highly monetizable,</p>
<p>you can make billions of dollars off them as many of our friends</p>
<p>have, right, by the way, that the early peer to peer versions</p>
<p>failed, right? Because juice, I mean, you know, the alternative</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really work out. Right? Yeah, exactly. Right. So, I</p>
<p>mean, BitTorrent did exist during this time, it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>it was zero. But generally speaking, this was the era of</p>
<p>hub and spoke MVC dominance. And now we&rsquo;re into a third</p>
<p>architecture, which I call CBC, client, blockchain client. And</p>
<p>so desktop clients have a blockchain that they communicate</p>
<p>with, for example, I have a wallet, you have a wallet on</p>
<p>your client, and then the Bitcoin blockchain intermediates</p>
<p>us I debit in credit you, okay, that&rsquo;s a different architecture</p>
<p>than both MVC and CBC, it actually combines the positive</p>
<p>qualities of both. It&rsquo;s decentralized and open source</p>
<p>and programmable, like peer to peer. But it also has global</p>
<p>state, and it&rsquo;s highly monetizable, like MVC. So</p>
<p>combines the best of both worlds. And it has some</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s very new, which is not open source, where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>open source code, it&rsquo;s open state, where it&rsquo;s open state</p>
<p>database, like open state means the back end is open also. So</p>
<p>all the applications that get built out, essentially, our</p>
<p>clients that same back end that same Bitcoin or Ethereum or</p>
<p>what have you back end, and then you kind of exchange between</p>
<p>them. And the true scarcity now comes not from locking in your</p>
<p>users, but from holding a currency, it kind of gets</p>
<p>reduced, the IP gets reduced to its minimal viable thing, which</p>
<p>is holding that cryptocurrency and what you can do with that.</p>
<p>But so give me the meat, give me the media analogy, right? So</p>
<p>where does the media sit? And how do I as a user have an</p>
<p>experience on what media to view and to access, like think about</p>
<p>because again, like just speaking in a in a layman&rsquo;s term</p>
<p>for folks, maybe to understand, you know, most people, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think understand the dynamics of what underlies a social network</p>
<p>as much as they understand the user experience of browsing</p>
<p>YouTube, right? So yeah, what is the what is my option in</p>
<p>browsing the decentralized version of YouTube? What does</p>
<p>that experience end up looking like in this decentralized</p>
<p>world? Right? Who ultimately adjudicates the algorithm that</p>
<p>defines what my recommended videos are that I&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>accessing from these kind of, you know, different nodes?</p>
<p>Well, I think the idea is you can bring your own, you can pick</p>
<p>one, there&rsquo;ll be a library.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s my point is like the picking function is what</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t didn&rsquo;t work in web 1.0 or web 0.9. Right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll take take a look at. So first of all, that state could</p>
<p>potentially so today blockchains are not very scalable. But</p>
<p>tomorrow, they already actually they&rsquo;re improving very rapidly.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re following Matic, if you&rsquo;re following</p>
<p>polygon, and if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re looking at what Solana is doing,</p>
<p>like you can do a lot more on chain in 2021 than you could in</p>
<ol start="2020">
<li>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of like bandwidth, it just improves</li>
</ol>
<p>every year. So more applications will become</p>
<p>feasible, like search indexes. Moreover, blockchains actually</p>
<p>so just to your specific point about search indexing,</p>
<p>blockchains actually radically simplify search engine to such a</p>
<p>point there are dark horse competitor to Google. What I</p>
<p>mean by that is Google index the open web because open web is</p>
<p>open. And then social networks were like a dark web, you know,</p>
<p>to them where that&rsquo;s why they were so mad. Google was so mad.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t acquire Facebook, right? Because it couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>index it couldn&rsquo;t index Twitter had two deals with them. That</p>
<p>was all on their, you know, on their server. So the social web</p>
<p>is even harder to index than the open web. But block explorer</p>
<p>blockchains, and, you know, block explorers, which are like</p>
<p>search engines on top of them, blockchains are easier to index</p>
<p>than either the open web or the social web. And the reason is,</p>
<p>many of the problems associated with indexing just go away. For</p>
<p>example, just one small problem, as you&rsquo;re probably aware, when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re indexing the open web, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve got a million</p>
<p>websites, you&rsquo;re crawling, each one of them, you only have you</p>
<p>only have a certain bandwidth amount total. So you have to</p>
<p>figure out, okay, do I recrawl this site or this one? Which one</p>
<p>is going to freshen? Okay, does this update every day or not? So</p>
<p>you have to run all these statistical estimators just to</p>
<p>figure out when to crawl a site. All that goes away, for example,</p>
<p>in the context of a blockchain, where you just subscribe, and</p>
<p>you get a block of transactions,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s got the real time index, and they can, there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>advantage being Google and having to start from Friedberg,</p>
<p>we got to wrap for bestie Chamath, David Sachs, Friedberg</p>
<p>and our bestie Balaji. Thanks for coming on the pod. And we</p>
<p>will see you all next time on the all in podcast. Bye bye.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>We open sourced it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with</p>
<p>it. I love you.</p>
<p>Queen of</p>
<p>besties are</p>
<p>dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just like this like sexual tension that</p>
<p>they just need to release.</p>
