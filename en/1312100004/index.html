<p>Call him daddy.</p>
<p>Do I call her daddy?</p>
<p>Call her daddy.</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.</p>
<p>It is Alex and Sofia back at it again for another episode of call her Daddy.</p>
<p>0:24</p>
<p>We hope at this point, you&rsquo;re all calling yourself daddy in the fucking bedroom, or at least forcing your partner to.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do a quick recap of last week, a little update on our lives.</p>
<p>So I left Sophia unattended for a week and I went to Paris before we get into that PO.</p>
<p>0:44</p>
<p>Sophia.</p>
<p>How was your week without?</p>
<p>Me and Lauren are other roommate.</p>
<p>She was in Iceland.</p>
<p>So your department to ourselves yourself.</p>
<p>Sorry, tell me about it.</p>
<p>Go, honestly, at this point, I&rsquo;ve been single for so long.</p>
<p>I am finding myself sexually aroused by anyone that will make eye contact with me for, like, more than two seconds.</p>
<p>1:02</p>
<p>I fell in love with a homeless man, on my way home from work.</p>
<p>Like I love, you have a man bun.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s would fucking go legit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know anymore.</p>
<p>Like, if I&rsquo;m genuinely attracted to these people or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I just, I don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so horny.</p>
<p>Everything looks hot.</p>
<p>No one.</p>
<p>1:18</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;ve been checking you out over here.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>I fucking the cameraman.</p>
<p>Sofia.</p>
<p>Sofia.</p>
<p>What are you doing after this?</p>
<p>By the way cameraman?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting harassed at work.</p>
<p>Anyways, so, like I said, I was personally, in Paris with a guy, um, you know, you&rsquo;re expected to fall in love.</p>
<p>1:37</p>
<p>When you go to Paris except for the fact that I didn&rsquo;t fucking find love.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fucking love found more.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just say, my vagina was drier than a fucking dryer sheet.</p>
<p>It was an extremely interesting trip to sum it up.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say I left the guy and I escaped Aid to the fucking airport without telling him.</p>
<p>1:58</p>
<p>I would want to I kind of want to elaborate but at the same time it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s too ripe and I kind of want to just too soon.</p>
<p>Yeah too soon.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s leave the details of the Paris trip to another podcast.</p>
<p>However, I know you were thinking about me while I was in Paris.</p>
<p>2:14</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We go.</p>
<p>So, Sofia text me when I&rsquo;m in the middle of my Paris trip, and I remember I was laying in bed and I get a text from Sofia.</p>
<p>And in all caps.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, emergency.</p>
<p>You need to come home and I&rsquo;m like, oh my God, at this point.</p>
<p>2:30</p>
<p>I want to leave the fucking trip.</p>
<p>So anything like you need me to make a taco for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there, baby.</p>
<p>Girl.</p>
<p>However, you text me and you emergency, you need to come home and then you follow it up.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re in the hospital and you follow it up with.</p>
<p>I need you to come.</p>
<p>Take a nude for me.</p>
<p>Haha.</p>
<p>2:46</p>
<p>Dude, it was a fucking emergency.</p>
<p>Like taking nude is no joke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of art.</p>
<p>It takes a village.</p>
<p>The tit shot is so easy.</p>
<p>I could fuck it do it.</p>
<p>My eyes closed at this point.</p>
<p>The ass shot.</p>
<p>However, it takes flexibility creativity, stamina concentration.</p>
<p>3:05</p>
<p>And while my girlfriend you Alex, you were gone.</p>
<p>I found myself in pain like trying to contortion my arm around my back, and I was just Like, holy shit.</p>
<p>I need someone to take this for me.</p>
<p>I need a dollar dude.</p>
<p>I understand where you&rsquo;re coming from and I&rsquo;m so fucking sorry.</p>
<p>3:22</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there for you in your time of need.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so I apologize at the end of the day though.</p>
<p>I think I did help you out.</p>
<p>You did you did Alex, you sent me.</p>
<p>If you knew that.</p>
<p>You have stored a few examples handy and ready baby.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready and you&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>3:39</p>
<p>I was so desperate.</p>
<p>At this point.</p>
<p>I was like, I need to fucking learn how to use Photoshop because I&rsquo;m about to fucking You&rsquo;re blond hair brown and play it off as my own.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fucking with you.</p>
<p>At that point.</p>
<p>I was like, if I threw on an emoji of a mill around here, whatever on this picture, like, what would the guy do?</p>
<p>4:00</p>
<p>Honestly, what would he do?</p>
<p>Honestly, guys are so fucking nasty.</p>
<p>They met for a split second, be like, okay, like the Emojis kind of weird, but whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to go take myself to my room and take care of myself.</p>
<p>Like, I know I can lend, you one hundred percent.</p>
<p>I can put a fucking like emojis.</p>
<p>4:15</p>
<p>He liked the kissy face and they would still be like, I&rsquo;m gonna go take care of myself.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to help me the fuck out.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I would honestly, just play it off like babe.</p>
<p>I was trying to be artsy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to send you like, any typical run-of-the-mill nude.</p>

<p>This is something that&rsquo;s Sophie and I were talking about.</p>
<p>So when Sophia I came home and she&rsquo;s like, you know you I want you to take a nude of me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering to guys.</p>
<p>5:03</p>

<p>My God.</p>

<p>Whether it&rsquo;s taking from someone else or not.</p>
<p>You see that?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I mean, I really don&rsquo;t think they would care.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll buy you a brown wig and we&rsquo;re going to do a photo shoot.</p>
<p>5:20</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And of a guy honestly was like Sophia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not your but I will be like you greedy motherfucker.</p>

<p>5:37</p>
<p>Goodbye grateful motherfucker Your Grace with an asp.</p>
<p>Take the ass or leave it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>
<p>Well, we are on the Topic of nudes because I know everyone&rsquo;s listening close because he wasn&rsquo;t sending news at this point.</p>
<p>Okay, Sofia.</p>
<p>5:53</p>
<p>And I have a fucking Public Service Announcement legit.</p>
<p>If you were listening before.</p>
<p>Listen up.</p>
<p>Now, we are about to drop some fucking knowledge that will change lives.</p>
<p>All right, pause, here we go.</p>
<p>6:09</p>
<p>Listen in nudes and the iCloud.</p>
<p>Do not mix.</p>
<p>I state that because listen up folks, if you send an old nude and the person saves it, which see 1000% will, they can see the date that you were originally took the photo?</p>
<p>6:31</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So AK, if you took it back in December, they will see it.</p>
<p>And you are exposed game fucking over folks.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s break it down a little bit more.</p>
<p>Okay, imagine the situation you are in bed.</p>
<p>Your Calling.</p>
<p>This guy are thinking about him and you need to send a nude ASAP.</p>
<p>6:47</p>
<p>Okay, things are getting heated.</p>
<p>You got your fucking pimple.</p>
<p>Cream on your glasses are on lights throughout.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ready to knock the fuck out.</p>
<p>All right, Sophia.</p>
<p>What do we do?</p>
<p>We and everyone else listening resort to sending that old knew that, you know, is green, not everyone has that fucking old fire a snood that they have ready to go locked in fucking loaded.</p>
<p>7:10</p>
<p>All right, so you find your old mood and you&rsquo;re ready to send and then what?</p>
<p>All right, so So this is the most important part and everybody listen up.</p>
<p>It is fucking imperative that you screenshot, the original nude and then proceed and go send the screenshotted version of the nude with the new date or the cloud will fuck you.</p>
<p>7:35</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re having is what you need a fucking explain to them how we found this genius Revelation out.</p>
<p>How did we find out?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let me, let me explain.</p>
<p>So how we found this out?</p>
<p>Is my ex called me the fuck out.</p>
<p>7:50</p>
<p>Because he was basically said he was saving the pic, he was saving it to his iPad, and then he went to look at it and he couldn&rsquo;t find it in that date because his shit was in the memory option where it goes by date.</p>
<p>So high, he&rsquo;s trying to scroll the fuck up and meanwhile, I was no longer in that month.</p>
<p>8:09</p>
<p>I was Chillin in fucking January ass out them like oh fuck and it was so fucking awkward.</p>
<p>Well, that is so rough with horrible and he was like, what the fuck was that pick for another God.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Are you re using news, blah blah.</p>
<p>And of course, I&rsquo;m a fucking psycho.</p>
<p>8:25</p>
<p>I came up with most genius response and he&rsquo;s an idiot and believe me.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But for now, I think it&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I were talking about these of the, our day because guys have now sent me pictures and the other week, specifically, a guy sent me a pic and I saved it to my phone and he, I saw Poor guy doesn&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;re that see, this is where the problems are Fiat.</p>
<p>8:47</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t know where this psycho and where this calculated.</p>
<p>So the guy sent me a pic and it was really hot as shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh my God, you&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>I save it and the poor guy.</p>
<p>I realized he sent it.</p>
<p>He took the picture week before.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, okay, a God only knows how many girls got that goddamn picture within that week.</p>
<p>9:06</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know what the moral of story is be fucking careful and watch your credibility, people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t get sloppy here, people.</p>
<p>I mean, I know half the people Europe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably sending it to are like so dumb, the person even notice, but protect your name out there, folks carry out there.</p>
<p>9:21</p>
<p>I think it would be really fun to test this.</p>
<p>So everyone go.</p>
<p>I want you to save pictures that people have sent you, even if it&rsquo;s selfies, Etc.</p>
<p>Go and click the memories options and see if you can catch any fucking people that were faking that day.</p>
<p>9:38</p>
<p>I want everyone to check.</p>
<p>And if you find people and you&rsquo;re exposing them, please go right into call her daddy.com and As fuck.</p>
<p>Yeah, dude, we are about to ruin relationships, straight up.</p>
<p>We are winning.</p>
<p>People are gonna be like, what the fuck my girlfriend took that two fucking years ago and it&rsquo;s her goat.</p>
<p>9:56</p>
<p>And I love how we just fucking Breeze past the fact that your ex was.</p>
<p>So open, like, hey, I&rsquo;m Gonna Save this.</p>
<p>If you think that your nudes are not being saved to the iPod, iPod my iPod touch, my Apple watch my Kindle, the fucking hard drive to the hard drive.</p>
<p>10:14</p>
<p>Ryback up, the hard drive, the hard drive of the hard drive, exactly, your it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>It goes back to the truth.</p>
<p>That guy&rsquo;s worship these things.</p>
<p>Okay, they will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever do ever the motherfucking news.</p>
<p>10:30</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m telling you this, even, and I feel bad because at least we weren&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re fucking jaded over here.</p>
<p>The thing is girls and I hate to break your heart.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a committed relationship, it doesn&rsquo;t matter guys are keeping those news.</p>
<p>Even if they have to send that shit because if you&rsquo;re a nosy girlfriend, they&rsquo;re going to send that folder to one of their homeboys and they&rsquo;re going to yeah for his them, but at the end of the day those nudes exist and they&rsquo;re here to stay hashtag mute.</p>
<p>10:57</p>
<p>Never die.</p>
<p>Like guys are literally like God take my eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my new guy will lose.</p>
<p>His family photo albums, government issued ID, social security card, passport birth certificate before he fucking losses and deletes all of the nudes in the secret album on his phone.</p>
<p>11:14</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just Life, dude, guys, like we talked about the other day.</p>
<p>My fucking ex told me the first thing he did when he broke up, is he deleted my news.</p>
<p>So fucking literally needless to say, we kind of had a sexual reconnection for a hot minute, a few months after and he sent me a picture of myself and he wrote, and he was like, oh my God, like this is my favorite fucking one of you.</p>
<p>11:38</p>
<p>We will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like bitch.</p>
<p>You said that shit was gone.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Try nude live on forever and fuck that shit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The boyfriend that I got caught cheating on episodes to always plug, go listen to it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking amazing.</p>
<p>11:54</p>
<p>He came across one of my nudes and guess what?</p>
<p>It brought him.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>The fuck back.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like my God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never gonna talk to Sophie again.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s fucking suck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I remember that.</p>
<p>Okay, let me text her.</p>
<p>12:10</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s so fucking true.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk while we&rsquo;re talking about that the V.</p>
<p>People like what a vehicle to be shaving?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the other week Sophia and I were talking about I think every girl specifically listening to this podcast will be able to relate to this and guys are probably going to maybe be shocked.</p>
<p>12:27</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about this, you got your going on a day or you&rsquo;re going out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a single decision.</p>
<p>It is a collective decision between you and your girlfriend&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>My shaving the V tonight or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like an announcement.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like guys, I refused to shave.</p>
<p>12:44</p>
<p>Is because I will not be hooking up with someone, you know, the really cool thing about that is you end up in a random person&rsquo;s shower at 3:00, a.m.</p>
<p>With a random razor fucking shaving that shit off in a blackout.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>13:00</p>
<p>Then you fucking wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not just for that.</p>
<p>You wake up in the fucking morning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, did that happen?</p>
<p>Oh shit.</p>
<p>You look down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fucking bald eagle down there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, wow!</p>
<p>How did that happen?</p>
<p>How many girls please write in and let?</p>
<p>Let us know you have been in that fucking shower, finding that fucking dirty ass.</p>
<p>13:19</p>
<p>Random-ass razor.</p>
<p>It could be a guy&rsquo;s paper and you are taking it to the V like a champ because, you know, goddamn.</p>
<p>Well, you like I have a mission.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do this tonight and I don&rsquo;t care what my sober self was thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going down there.</p>
<p>Literally, wake up the next morning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, I don&rsquo;t think we hooked up.</p>
<p>13:34</p>
<p>And then you look down there and it&rsquo;s fucking like, ball and shaved in your, like, I am now 99.9%.</p>
<p>Sure something happened.</p>
<p>Something went in and out.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t understand like we use it almost as a protection shield.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like pure strategy.</p>
<p>13:50</p>
<p>Once you get hammered, you start to forget your morals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden the bushes.</p>
<p>What brings you back when we got?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s poetic the bush.</p>
<p>Praise you back to remembering.</p>
<p>Oh wait.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I promised myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to fucking hook up with this guy.</p>
<p>Wait, let&rsquo;s think about it because we know we have kind of, like, 50/50 listeners.</p>
<p>14:08</p>
<p>How amazing is it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sitting here talking about this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fucking guy in history.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s shy.</p>
<p>Showering getting ready for his day or night out and he&rsquo;s in the shower and he&rsquo;s like, hell no, I&rsquo;m not gonna shave that shit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get my dick sucked.</p>
<p>Tonight.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to move that fast.</p>
<p>14:24</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to fuck this bitch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how fucking noise like dying right now.</p>
<p>No guy.</p>
<p>A guy could be like, I literally just worked out fucking walk to the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disgusting down there and they&rsquo;re like still.</p>
<p>Can I put it in your mouth?</p>
<p>But Jake like oh, fuck that.</p>
<p>14:39</p>
<p>But I think honestly, the difference is between guys and girls.</p>
<p>At the end of the day.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the ones I can give back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pregnant.</p>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;m just gonna be honest.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get that kind of brings me.</p>
<p>Can we talk about condoms?</p>
<p>I feel I can guess.</p>
<p>I feel like we should.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t even know how to answer that.</p>
<p>Because are they still around know exactly condoms.</p>
<p>14:56</p>
<p>Do they even fucking exist anymore?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Sophia, never talking about this.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>We talked about so much shit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so inappropriate.</p>
<p>Sometimes, weird go to 99 Cent Pizza, were out late night, and we start talking.</p>
<p>Like, I know people know that this podcast also translates into our everyday lives.</p>
<p>15:13</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is not a show folks.</p>
<p>No, this is how we talked and we talked to Lauren about it too and Lauren&rsquo;s like, no, I don&rsquo;t think that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re in sizing guys up.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Are we really gonna go there?</p>
<p>Go for it.</p>
<p>Go for the other day.</p>
<p>15:28</p>
<p>We were meeting with someone.</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t say, um, obviously, we&rsquo;re meeting with someone and I left the meeting and we were getting pizza.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh my God, doesn&rsquo;t blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Have a huge Weiner.</p>
<p>And without hesitation, Alex Goes, absolutely.</p>
<p>15:43</p>
<p>Like, it wasn&rsquo;t even a question.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like, what&rsquo;s happening is Pam&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>It was just like, yep, we done the minute.</p>
<p>We meet guys were like bigger smaller in between even we&rsquo;ve said, There&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s in between he&rsquo;s either tiny or he&rsquo;s fucking packing.</p>
<p>What is wrong with us?</p>
<p>And we bring it up to her roommate Lauren and Lauren&rsquo;s like, yeah, we&rsquo;re like Lauren Jennifer just like, you know, like, when you&rsquo;re fucking getting pizza and the pizza, man, like, you obviously size up his dick, right?</p>
<p>16:07</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, you know, I honestly don&rsquo;t do that comes up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like over, like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>Now you are.</p>
<p>We normal person, normal normal thoughts.</p>
<p>Okay, so we need to reel it in.</p>
<p>So anyways, there&rsquo;s a funeral talking about this other week with regard to condoms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy because Right, so you and I we&rsquo;ve both dated guys that are older in like they&rsquo;re 35 range.</p>
<p>16:31</p>
<p>And then we compare that to a guy that&rsquo;s more in our range like in their 20s older guys, usually will always have a condom on done.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then the younger generation fucking forget it.</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t know what a condiment they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what I do.</p>
<p>Understand.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know how to put one on.</p>
<p>16:46</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you and I are so over here.</p>
<p>Like we can&rsquo;t even get to the condom talk because we&rsquo;re like, okay.</p>
<p>So we had a date.</p>
<p>We had one date, which means that we can go to first base and now, like, how long until we get to second fade?</p>
<p>And I know people probably like, there&rsquo;s no way but the fact that we we still talk about basis.</p>
<p>17:05</p>
<p>Why, why can you imagine if on the fourth date?</p>
<p>You and the guy go back to his room and you fucking put a little lotion, your hand grab his weiner.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, this is about to feel great and you&rsquo;re like, okay.</p>
<p>17:20</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hitting second base.</p>
<p>I hand job.</p>
<p>Yeah, tell you to get lost.</p>
<p>Should be about the best.</p>
<p>Wake the fuck up.</p>
<p>No one has given a fucking hand job since 1999.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s honestly I would love to hear people&rsquo;s comments on this.</p>
<p>17:37</p>
<p>This is a topic about condoms that Sophia and I have been.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been kind of talking about it for a few weeks now.</p>
<p>So girls, specifically do you feel this way with guys?</p>
<p>Like no one is really bringing condoms around anymore like fucking idiots and guys.</p>
<p>17:53</p>
<p>Do you have a reason as to why you don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t fucking write in and say because it feels better.</p>
<p>We know that.</p>
<p>But I mean logistically, like we&rsquo;ve heard from some guys saying like you don&rsquo;t want to come off as the minute you start hooking up and then you whip this fucking condom out.</p>
<p>18:08</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>So bitch you thought you did.</p>
<p>I thought you&rsquo;re about to sleep with any like spread your legs outgoing.</p>
<p>Girls, get all freaked out because they&rsquo;re like, oh, so you brought a condom so you were prepared.</p>
<p>So you thought you were gonna stop fucking because you fought with her fuck.</p>
<p>We are now, let&rsquo;s transition first and foremost.</p>
<p>18:26</p>
<p>I think we should answer some questions.</p>

<p>25:38</p>
<p>Okay, when I recorded the first episode, my mom really contemplated disowning me.</p>
<p>She was a little bit in a State of Shock.</p>
<p>She was like, not into it.</p>
<p>She was like, Sofia, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you know what, Mom?</p>

<p>26:40</p>
<p>What you guys are saying what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Listen, they all want a piece of the thing.</p>
<p>I think, I think we got it ended there.</p>
<p>I always promise.</p>
<p>I know we promised people we&rsquo;re going to talk about, but, you know, Etc.</p>
<p>And we were going to talk about how to give the girl Gluck Gluck 3000.</p>
<p>26:58</p>
<p>But let me just say something with regard to at least anal guys.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the beginning stages of this relationship.</p>
<p>This is episode 4.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like first base approaching second base, like come on, even though I just told him that had to give the sloppy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking blowjob in the downtown region, but fuck me, right.</p>
<p>27:15</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So anyways, thanks so much for listening, guys.</p>
<p>This is what we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>We really need you guys to rate this podcast stars.</p>
<p>But I mean, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you how many stars 5 stars.</p>
<p>Hold up your hand.</p>
<p>How many fingers?</p>
<p>550 K.</p>
<p>So read as five stars and then also give us an honest, positive review.</p>
<p>27:34</p>
<p>And I repeat honest, positive review.</p>
<p>If you guys can slide down on our Channel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really actually know what it does.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s a really big deal if we get great reviews.</p>
