<p>have about 700 people that around so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna take your questions</p>
<p>and for those callers guess what this is</p>
<p>YouTube this is YouTube and for you</p>
<p>callers I&rsquo;m gonna also answer your</p>
<p>questions that I have so I tell you what</p>
<p>Karen we&rsquo;re gonna start with them Maria</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s from Green Bay Wisconsin okay</p>
<p>and she want to know the best treatment</p>
<p>for my 17 year old grandsons lupus okay</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t do this right</p>
<p>here oh yeah this is great</p>
<p>okay good oh nice all right good so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in business here yeah okay great</p>
<p>just like it never happened</p>
<p>so good we have about nine hundred and</p>
<p>seventy-one people on so everyone just</p>
<p>switch over to the YouTube YouTube yeah</p>
<p>do that and I&rsquo;m gonna talk about this is</p>
<p>Marie this is towards Maria Green Bay</p>
<p>Wisconsin again you guys can still call</p>
<p>in we can answer your calls I just won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be able to talk to you so the best</p>
<p>treatment for lupus hands down and by</p>
<p>the way anything that we say is not</p>
<p>meant to diagnose you or create any your</p>
<p>medical diseases or even cure you just</p>
<p>meant it for you to do your own research</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re with help of your doctor but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing vitamin D</p>
<p>vitamin D is what&rsquo;s called an immune</p>
<p>modulator so it helps to control the</p>
<p>immune system and higher levels of</p>
<p>vitamin D and you know you can start out</p>
<p>with 30,000 IU&rsquo;s of vitamin D I did I</p>
<p>put a video out under ms and I would</p>
<p>apply that same protocols by a doctor in</p>
<p>South America Brazil I think and great</p>
<p>protocol great results with autoimmune</p>
<p>stuff so you can check him out I put a</p>
<p>link down there so just look up ms</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really good for all the</p>
<p>autoimmune conditions one thing about</p>
<p>autoimmune is that the immune system is</p>
<p>creating this inflammatory situation so</p>
<p>you have a lot of collateral damage so</p>
<p>this damage is destroying everything so</p>
<p>if you could literally get rid of the</p>
<p>inflammation part of it all of a sudden</p>
<p>you put everything back in remission so</p>
<p>higher amounts of vitamin D is going to</p>
<p>be the thing to do and in addition to</p>
<p>that in a minute fasting those two hands</p>
<p>down are going to be very helpful okay</p>
<p>all right and then Angela had a question</p>
<p>from North Carolina what are my thoughts</p>
<p>on ozone and stem-cell treatment</p>
<p>interesting you say that yes I&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>interested in some fact I&rsquo;m doing a</p>
<p>video on today you read my mind</p>
<p>I love the ozone therapy it&rsquo;s fantastic</p>
<p>ozone is a gas and it&rsquo;s an added oxygen</p>
<p>molecule so it&rsquo;s a three they there is a</p>
<p>danger of inhaling it so you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to breathe it in there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>ways that you can you can inject it of</p>
<p>course with with someone that&rsquo;s trained</p>
<p>and also you can have it infused with</p>
<p>olive oil and put it on the skin it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>antibacterial antifungal antiviral but</p>
<p>it also permeates oxygen into the body</p>
<p>to help heal the skin and the inside of</p>
<p>the body and the tissues I look I</p>
<p>suggest you just wait for the video that</p>
<p>I do on this later than a couple of days</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s our stem cell that&rsquo;s another really</p>
<p>good therapy I have a video on that um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also some new things on</p>
<p>something a version of stem cell which</p>
<p>is peptide therapy but stem cell is</p>
<p>great for inflammation anti aging and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically using</p>
<p>a cell that is undifferentiated so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically it will turn into</p>
<p>whatever cell that is needed wanted so I</p>
<p>think the future of stem cell is going</p>
<p>to be huge it&rsquo;s one of the natural has</p>
<p>very minimal side effects so I highly</p>
<p>recommend it</p>
<p>thanks Angela Rodgers and Kelly&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>Wisconsin Kelly is from Wisconsin and I</p>
<p>think you can you hear me right Kelly I</p>
<p>know you can so I&rsquo;m just gonna put you</p>
<p>in pause here question something</p>
<p>happening on the other side</p>
<p>I just put around pause so Kelly had a</p>
<p>question is saw palmetto good for PCOS</p>
<p>polycystic ovarian syndrome and the</p>
<p>answer is saw palmetto is good for</p>
<p>handling a very powerful form of</p>
<p>testosterone and androgen so it is it is</p>
<p>good but there&rsquo;s something much better</p>
<p>and that is lowering your insulin level</p>
<p>so this is why the most important thing</p>
<p>is to do keto and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>to drop the insulin which is then</p>
<p>converting to androgens because PCOS is</p>
<p>an an urgent problem and females and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want excessive amounts of androgen</p>
<p>because the facial hair and the acne and</p>
<p>the weight gain so that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend thanks Kelly and also all the</p>
<p>questions are gonna be coming up here if</p>
<p>you want to try to capture a few or or</p>
<p>there I&rsquo;ll try to get as many as we can</p>
<p>but you know what Karen I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>time for a question for people the quiz</p>
<p>now quiet okay good so the question is</p>
<p>what is the biggest benefit of exercise</p>
<p>and the answer is not weight loss what</p>
<p>is the top actually tell you what well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the top two benefits of exercise</p>
<p>that goes beyond just weight loss</p>
<p>because exercise is some a very minor</p>
<p>benefit but there&rsquo;s two even more</p>
<p>important benefits from exercise see if</p>
<p>you guys can guess this question okay</p>
<p>guess the answer to the question now are</p>
<p>you on Facebook or YouTube I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>YouTube and you are I&rsquo;m not sure where</p>
<p>you are are you on the same yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the you&rsquo;re on the channel that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s working but are</p>
<p>they able to hear anything see anything</p>
<p>if not tell tell them nothing tell them</p>
<p>to do this if you go just to my channel</p>
<p>dr. Berg you&rsquo;ll see this live video and</p>
<p>you can actually just log right on and</p>
<p>listen to it dr. berger calm no youtube</p>
<p>and then they go to my channel and then</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll see a live video and they can go</p>
<p>to that one instead okay so while</p>
<p>Karen&rsquo;s working on that this is called a</p>
<p>cope guys echo happens in life Carly</p>
<p>everyday there&rsquo;s something you have to</p>
<p>cope doesn&rsquo;t go exactly the way you</p>
<p>wanted to and you just roll it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called punting okay alright someone had</p>
<p>a question here</p>
<p>Oh strength and improve cardio good</p>
<p>answer what are the two benefits of</p>
<p>exercise that are not related to losing</p>
<p>weight oh I see</p>
<p>alright brain health increase oxygen</p>
<p>okay good alright let&rsquo;s see what else</p>
<p>mental health cardio health energy</p>
<p>growth hormone increase good answers</p>
<p>guys heart and vascular heart health and</p>
<p>brain health reducing stress</p>
<p>okay you guys are you guys are on track</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing really good as far as with</p>
<p>your answers but let me give you the</p>
<p>correct answers okay the two two answers</p>
<p>to this question the exercise yeah is</p>
<p>you build up your antioxidant reserve</p>
<p>okay so you get more antioxidants</p>
<p>internally your body just makes more</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge benefit that will decrease</p>
<p>free radical damage but secondly</p>
<p>exercise preserves your muscle mass so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t lose muscle and I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about regular exercise how many of you</p>
<p>found that with aging your muscles are</p>
<p>not cooperating like they should and</p>
<p>they may even kind of start sagging off</p>
<p>your body raise your hand</p>
<p>anyone I guess you can&rsquo;t raise your hand</p>
<p>exercise is the absolute best way to</p>
<p>stimulate the system it creates a mild</p>
<p>stress that then caused your body to</p>
<p>rebound and preserve muscle mass without</p>
<p>the loss of mass so if you&rsquo;re sedentary</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re waiting some day for a reason</p>
<p>to exercise these are the two very</p>
<p>important ones preserve your muscles and</p>
<p>you have to work harder because every</p>
<p>single year you&rsquo;re losing at least one</p>
<p>percent of your muscle mass with aging</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re 80 years old this is after</p>
<p>50 by the way so if it&rsquo;s just like 80</p>
<p>years old you have 30% of your muscle is</p>
<p>gone so you want to do things to prevent</p>
<p>that and preserve muscle mass regular</p>
<p>exercise and what&rsquo;s the second thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m busy reading okay sorry okay</p>
<p>antioxidant Reserve okay</p>
<p>yeah okay okay good so let&rsquo;s Karen let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to Mary we&rsquo;re gonna marry hey Ren Mei</p>
<p>Ren from Tampa Marine marine Marine I</p>
<p>hate I can hear you yeah I can but no</p>
<p>one else can no one else so I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>put her on pause because okay can we</p>
<p>take psyllium see that&rsquo;s a fibre and</p>
<p>bone broth during a fast now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting because I just released a</p>
<p>video on this yesterday I think or the</p>
<p>day before on what you should eat and</p>
<p>should not eat during a fast the fiber</p>
<p>is totally fine because it absolutely</p>
<p>will not increase inside but the bone</p>
<p>broth broth is protein and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>one you I would not consume bone broth</p>
<p>on a fast because it&rsquo;s protein and we</p>
<p>want to avoid protein and carbs so watch</p>
<p>that video as I give you I give everyone</p>
<p>a detailed answer because I talked about</p>
<p>the difference between breaking a fast</p>
<p>breaking your ketosis and losing weight</p>
<p>three different separate deals okay</p>
<p>alright Karen you have any questions yes</p>
<p>there was a question from a couple of</p>
<p>different people about when to eat your</p>
<p>meal that you stress eating lunch and</p>
<p>dinner or just one in the afternoon but</p>
<p>what if they wanted to do breakfast or</p>
<p>is there any advantage or is it better</p>
<p>to do a meal at one time than another</p>
<p>one of the people said that their doctor</p>
<p>was really promoting doing the keto diet</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting but really</p>
<p>pushed having their meal as the</p>
<p>breakfast meal I think that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>excellent question Karen that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fabulous question</p>
<p>alright let&rsquo;s go to Joseph no no I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just kidding this is the answer here you</p>
<p>are it&rsquo;s six o&rsquo;clock at night and then</p>
<p>you of course you&rsquo;re not going to eat</p>
<p>after your dinner right and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna sleep all night long so you got</p>
<p>this jumpstart on fasting okay so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fasting and you&rsquo;re sleeping and then you</p>
<p>wake up if you break that fast</p>
<p>just kind of ruined the longer fast so</p>
<p>eating a breakfast is not the best meal</p>
<p>that was my question I know I&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>to the answer okay so you want to ride</p>
<p>the wave as long as you can until your</p>
<p>first meal now that being said you could</p>
<p>based on your schedule or interest have</p>
<p>them eat your breakfast and then maybe</p>
<p>your second meal at 3:00 and then not</p>
<p>eat after that if you want really</p>
<p>depends on your schedule and also some</p>
<p>people for example really have to have a</p>
<p>snack at night so I recommend they they</p>
<p>go as late as possible maybe even they</p>
<p>have the last meal I get nine and so</p>
<p>they can eat late at night and then they</p>
<p>fast all the way until the next day did</p>
<p>that answer the question can you just</p>
<p>have breakfast as your meal if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing home and yeah okay well that was</p>
<p>simple yep good do you have any other</p>
<p>questions yes Kathy asked if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing an 18 hour fast does it actually</p>
<p>give you a repair benefit or do you have</p>
<p>to go longer no 18 hours is a good</p>
<p>amount of fasting that will give you</p>
<p>really good benefits I would do it</p>
<p>minimally 16 but 18 is better and 20 is</p>
<p>even better but I like 18 you&rsquo;ll get a</p>
<p>lot of benefits alright can you read</p>
<p>that can yeah I can read it does it say</p>
<p>is it safe to consume carb powder or</p>
<p>cream carob powder over cream during</p>
<p>your faucet yeah wouldn&rsquo;t do carob</p>
<p>powder cuz I do know that it has</p>
<p>carbohydrates now it&rsquo;s funny you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>asking these questions that just did a</p>
<p>video on guys but the cream it&rsquo;s fat</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t break your closest but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to split on your weight loss</p>
<p>because your body&rsquo;s gonna burn that as</p>
<p>fat and instead of your own fat ketosis</p>
<p>during pregnancy yeah of course yes oh</p>
<p>absolutely just don&rsquo;t do the in a minute</p>
<p>fasting what about that one</p>
<p>gastroparesis I did a video on this as</p>
<p>well gastroparesis is a situation when</p>
<p>your digestive system is really sluggish</p>
<p>and slow and what you need to do very</p>
<p>simply is consume</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid in the form of the</p>
<p>tain how to chloride as well as opposite</p>
<p>of vinegar and I&rsquo;m telling you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna help you tremendously absolutely</p>
<p>good let&rsquo;s to tell you what let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>Joseph and then give me another one</p>
<p>hey Joseph you&rsquo;re from Hudson Florida</p>
<p>your wife hit a plateau on oh man what</p>
<p>do you do good question and of course I</p>
<p>did another video on this yesterday</p>
<p>which basically I wanted what I want to</p>
<p>know and maybe I could just ask just if</p>
<p>this really quick Joseph you can hear me</p>
<p>can you tell me your wife losing inches</p>
<p>in her midsection or not</p>
<p>Wow 190 pounds that&rsquo;s amazing okay</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>well even the rooster loved that one</p>
<p>well let me let me just answer the</p>
<p>question because the problem is no one</p>
<p>else can hear you except us so yeah I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to I have the gist of what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re asking here every time he says</p>
<p>something good I don&rsquo;t have to ring the</p>
<p>bell because there&rsquo;s a rooster in the</p>
<p>background there&rsquo;s a rooster in the</p>
<p>background he&rsquo;s cheering you on Joseph</p>
<p>and they lost a lot of weight 190 pounds</p>
<p>yeah and now they&rsquo;re kind of getting to</p>
<p>this point where now it&rsquo;s stopped right</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;re not seeing interests as</p>
<p>loss if you saw inches lost then that</p>
<p>means it is working okay but if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see it just lost and you have that</p>
<p>last 25 pounds or whatever to lose all</p>
<p>you have to do is do Oh Matt one meal a</p>
<p>day every other day okay you just have</p>
<p>to go strict with the amount of fasting</p>
<p>go longer get down lose that extra</p>
<p>weight this happened with an another</p>
<p>lady that I showed you that</p>
<p>before-and-after picture I just</p>
<p>interviewed you yesterday incredible she</p>
<p>was over 300 pound pounds she&rsquo;s down to</p>
<p>138 right now I know two years and what</p>
<p>she had no problem she just went Bam Bam</p>
<p>Bam but the last 20 pounds didn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t coming off so she she cut down</p>
<p>the number of meals and says she went</p>
<p>long with fasting dropped out last 20</p>
<p>pounds now she hit her goal 138 great</p>
<p>interview but that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>Joseph good question though all right</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to well here&rsquo;s a question any</p>
<p>vegetarian options for fish oil</p>
<p>replacement yeah yeah because you need</p>
<p>your DHA and there&rsquo;s some algae that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>vegan friendly algae that gives you the</p>
<p>DHA and you know what else you could do</p>
<p>for b12 which is a different topic my</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice powder which I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>bias or our wheatgrass juice powder</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re not bias has b12 in it</p>
<p>double the RDAs which is interesting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually from a microbe so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another thing you want to do I do want</p>
<p>to and I&rsquo;m not by SM I own our own keto</p>
<p>essential amino s&ndash; but I do want to</p>
<p>plug this product it&rsquo;s in a lot of you</p>
<p>guys are taking already the essential me</p>
<p>knows</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s cool about this is that you it</p>
<p>turns into body tissue at 99% in other</p>
<p>words there&rsquo;s only 1% waste as compared</p>
<p>to like a steak you&rsquo;re wasting about 68</p>
<p>percent of that either as fuel or</p>
<p>through your urine so if you are</p>
<p>struggling with getting enough protein</p>
<p>and I do want to do talk about that</p>
<p>shortly because it&rsquo;s a very important</p>
<p>topic this might be a nice little</p>
<p>enhancement that you might want to do</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t waste any of the</p>
<p>protein Karen yep a steak okay I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna give you an example if you have a</p>
<p>steak that&rsquo;s like a hundred grams that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>three ounces three or four ounces</p>
<p>take a well guess how much of that</p>
<p>actual steak is actual protein a hundred</p>
<p>grams how many grams would be actual so</p>
<p>maybe seven percent good answer it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually 25% it&rsquo;s a 25 but still like 25</p>
<p>grams out of a hundred is actual protein</p>
<p>the rest is water and other things I</p>
<p>mean that&rsquo;s like crazy you think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting a lot of protein when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating a steak or even fish you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>getting as much as you think now if we</p>
<p>take take one step further and I will be</p>
<p>doing a video on this if we take a steak</p>
<p>and ask how much of that protocol</p>
<p>protein that you&rsquo;re getting from the</p>
<p>steak is actually turned into body</p>
<p>tissue now we&rsquo;re dealing with a very</p>
<p>small number we&rsquo;re dealing with like 30%</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re getting 30% of 25 grams is um</p>
<p>is 8 carry the seven point eight eight</p>
<p>grams so when you eat a three ounce</p>
<p>steak you&rsquo;re getting actually only eight</p>
<p>grams</p>
<p>I mean people actually need a little</p>
<p>more protein than they think so the</p>
<p>problem is if we have a steak you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting waste in fuel so this is one of</p>
<p>the banners with those aminos</p>
<p>I personally noticed a nice change you</p>
<p>started taking them but I really like</p>
<p>them as an enhancement because you only</p>
<p>waste like one gram or 1% anyway watch</p>
<p>the video on that it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>very soon all right questions lots of</p>
<p>questions okay question regarding coffee</p>
<p>refined or unrefined coconut whale I</p>
<p>never find always go unrefined yeah okay</p>
<p>so here is an interesting question why</p>
<p>do you recommend one cup of coffee a day</p>
<p>when and there was a paragraph so I</p>
<p>think the confusion is that there isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a recommendation to have one cup of</p>
<p>coffee today just how else to be I</p>
<p>always tell people one just because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>meaning if you&rsquo;re gonna have coffee</p>
<p>limited right now to one not know I</p>
<p>point isn&rsquo;t start drinking coffee right</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right because the caffeine the</p>
<p>caffeine can keep you up and you know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re gonna interfere with your</p>
<p>sleep so yeah yeah the point is not</p>
<p>start drinking coffee right right okay</p>
<p>good so question um if you had chronic</p>
<p>hepatitis B would the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>benefit you in any way and how well I</p>
<p>think only from the fact it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>reduce inflammation and the fact that if</p>
<p>you add in a minute fasting in there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s icing on the cake both of those</p>
<p>together will drop inflammation because</p>
<p>ketones and will be very</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory so it&rsquo;s gonna help</p>
<p>anything with itis hepatitis arthritis</p>
<p>bursitis so yes I would highly recommend</p>
<p>that as far as virus goes you want zinc</p>
<p>to help put that virus back on a mission</p>
<p>and put the Machine of course we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not treating any diseases but</p>
<p>mighty may help you yes good now there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a general question about epilepsy how is</p>
<p>it that the ketogenic diet helps</p>
<p>epilepsy what yeah epilepsy is a is</p>
<p>definitely a dysfunctional part of your</p>
<p>brain and so if you take ketones as your</p>
<p>fuel instead of glucose it bypasses the</p>
<p>damaged part of that brain and can feed</p>
<p>it what it needs and the epilepsy goes</p>
<p>away because you&rsquo;re using a different</p>
<p>fuel source that the body can use as</p>
<p>compared</p>
<p>the glucose which the body can&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>alright good</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see here it says coffee increases</p>
<p>your fat-burning capabilities so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for keto I mean maybe a little bit</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not necessarily the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to help you burn fat what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>high in essential amino acids and is it</p>
<p>a good balance for an easy metabolic</p>
<p>without processing excess amino acid</p>
<p>well the only thing I wanted to say</p>
<p>about this little product right here is</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a ton of research in the</p>
<p>combination of how that&rsquo;s put together</p>
<p>and if you go to my website I have the</p>
<p>links there there&rsquo;s massive double</p>
<p>blinded studies that show that out of</p>
<p>all the combinations of amino acids this</p>
<p>was developed to get the maximum</p>
<p>conversion into your body tissue so if</p>
<p>you just buy a regular amino acid</p>
<p>product from the store you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to get the same effect so it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>the research and the science behind this</p>
<p>product</p>
<p>I really wasn&rsquo;t honestly I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>interested in even having that as one of</p>
<p>my products until this doctor who was</p>
<p>enlighten me on it he kept following me</p>
<p>around and he kept saying probably got</p>
<p>my attention he started telling about</p>
<p>more about this and it just like a light</p>
<p>bulb went off I said wow I have to learn</p>
<p>more about this okay send me Sam I</p>
<p>started taking it I was like wow my</p>
<p>muscles feel I feel just more the</p>
<p>muscles are more dense stronger I really</p>
<p>like this product for endurance so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like okay I gotta carry this because</p>
<p>this is awesome it&rsquo;s an awesome product</p>
<p>so I have some personal reality on that</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re looking for those questions</p>
<p>Karen I want to go to Valerie</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s from Denver Colorado and she had a</p>
<p>question regarding she started keto but</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s having constant migraines so one</p>
<p>thing I want you to hey Valerie are you</p>
<p>there okay really quickly just tell me</p>
<p>are you taking MCT oil or exogenous</p>
<p>ketones</p>
<p>hey Valerie Valerie unfortunately I</p>
<p>would love to listen a little bit more</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t because everyone&rsquo;s watching</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna have to just quickly</p>
<p>summarize they can&rsquo;t hear you they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hear you so I&rsquo;m really sorry about that</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing you should do</p>
<p>Valerie you just ordered to keep the MCT</p>
<p>oil start taking that that will at least</p>
<p>get your brain because I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just not in you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>transitioning fast enough so take the</p>
<p>MCT oil or exogenous ketones that&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>right to the brain your brain will be</p>
<p>happy the headaches should go away if it</p>
<p>does not then you need B vitamins</p>
<p>specifically the nutritional yeast and</p>
<p>that should handle the migraines that</p>
<p>will work 99.99% of the time if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t call me back next week and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have everything straightened down thanks</p>
<p>Valerie alright look for that let me</p>
<p>just go to Kelly from Wisconsin</p>
<p>what part of Wisconsin Kelly okay so I</p>
<p>think I might have answered this already</p>
<p>but saw palmetto can be helpful for PCOS</p>
<p>because it actually decreases the it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it has an enzyme in there that help</p>
<p>to reduce the the stronger type of</p>
<p>androgen but what&rsquo;s gonna work better</p>
<p>Kelly is you doing the keto and I F</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s kind of reduced your</p>
<p>insulin and then that&rsquo;s gonna reduce</p>
<p>your androgens okay so and then your</p>
<p>PCOS will be improved the third thing</p>
<p>you have to remember is you have to you</p>
<p>have to actually not just answer the</p>
<p>question you have to ask the question</p>
<p>because these guys aren&rsquo;t hearing the</p>
<p>question so on Valerie with her</p>
<p>headaches she was just saying she&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>keto but she has migraines no we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know did she have migraines before that</p>
<p>yeah or not but her point was just she</p>
<p>is trying keto she&rsquo;s working her way to</p>
<p>get into keto but she&rsquo;s got migraines so</p>
<p>that question was in a question answer</p>
<p>good point</p>
<p>I already answered Maria&rsquo;s question she</p>
<p>want to know my 17 year old grandson</p>
<p>with lupus what should I do and the</p>
<p>answer is vitamin D vitamin D vitamin D</p>
<p>high levels of it go to my video on ms</p>
<p>and watch the protocol that I give</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s good for all autoimmune</p>
<p>conditions again check with your doctor</p>
<p>first but I give you a link on a doctor</p>
<p>in Brazil who&rsquo;s getting fantastic</p>
<p>results with that it&rsquo;s vitamin D good</p>
<p>question all right you find a good</p>
<p>question can yes sir and I&rsquo;m gonna go to</p>
<p>Gabriel from Indianapolis had a question</p>
<p>do carbs and spices count it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>relative to how much spice it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>really really hard to have any</p>
<p>significant amount of calories and</p>
<p>spices so I would I would it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>small issue that I would not worry about</p>
<p>it I would put lots of spices in your</p>
<p>food garlic whatever</p>
<p>not a problem cinnamon because the</p>
<p>benefit of spices are really good for</p>
<p>your food except the only spice that</p>
<p>would not recommend is any spices with</p>
<p>msg and Jennifer from Lancaster</p>
<p>Pennsylvania had a question is keto safe</p>
<p>for someone who has MS well I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very very essential to do it because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna reduce your information I</p>
<p>mean think about it</p>
<p>would you if you had MS in autoimmune</p>
<p>would you want to add more carbohydrates</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna add more inflammation so</p>
<p>you want to do intimate of fasting and</p>
<p>healthy keto for any type of autoimmune</p>
<p>condition just to drop the inflammation</p>
<p>good question Jennifer alright okay so</p>
<p>would you ever recommend adding carbs</p>
<p>for an athlete yeah I think I would but</p>
<p>I would probably try to stay within your</p>
<p>50 grams so just go higher because you</p>
<p>may need a bit more energy unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fully adapted and you also might lose</p>
<p>too much weight if you so keep it right</p>
<p>around 50 now some people let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re younger and you do</p>
<p>huge marathon or whatever I would</p>
<p>probably you could probably go up to 60</p>
<p>70 or even 80 grams of carbs but that is</p>
<p>an exception you know what Karen I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t know if I asked</p>
<p>this question or not let&rsquo;s see here</p>
<p>I think I already asked that question</p>
<p>yeah okay so never mind</p>
<p>okay well let me ask you this does keto</p>
<p>increase estrogen um no no it will not</p>
<p>increase your estrogen it doesn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t decrease it either it will enhance</p>
<p>your hormone effectiveness but now if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating foods with estrogen that</p>
<p>could spike it like if you&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>lot of dairy that&rsquo;s commercial dairy</p>
<p>that could be a problem okay</p>
<p>and again the weekly question what can</p>
<p>you do keto and breastfeed yes but not</p>
<p>exactly the same time you know do keto</p>
<p>and then wait and then do breast feeding</p>
<p>like cuz it&rsquo;s gonna it&rsquo;s gonna be hard</p>
<p>to do unless all I guess you could you</p>
<p>got two hands there that one told the</p>
<p>baby and then but you want to do keto if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re breastfeeding you want to do keto</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re pregnant you just don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to do in a minute fasting okay</p>
<p>Norman has dark circle only under one</p>
<p>eye someone punch him I was gonna say</p>
<p>that but I thought no he has a real</p>
<p>question well the only thing I would say</p>
<p>to that is that the right side is</p>
<p>related to the liver the left sides rate</p>
<p>of really related to the heart so there</p>
<p>could be a connection there I have no</p>
<p>idea you stop me okay with the Keitel</p>
<p>aminos oh yeah what is the equivalency</p>
<p>on the back of the bottle is that</p>
<p>equivalent to grams of protein or grams</p>
<p>of food it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s grams of well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s grams of protein in it food on the</p>
<p>back of the bottle but if you go to the</p>
<p>website I talk we give examples of the</p>
<p>Prout the different foods but the actual</p>
<p>protein in the food not the weight of</p>
<p>the food okay ignore that kid his person</p>
<p>is asked this question about seven times</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>your opinion is the blood type diet</p>
<p>valid I mean it&rsquo;s not what we yeah do or</p>
<p>talk about it sounds valid it sounds</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a technology but if you</p>
<p>look in the back of the book and look at</p>
<p>the research</p>
<p>I just just doesn&rsquo;t really go anywhere I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t find any hardcore data so all</p>
<p>four diets are fairly kind of</p>
<p>combinations of healthy food so honestly</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re gonna feel better on any</p>
<p>one that you do and you may feel better</p>
<p>with more protein or less protein or</p>
<p>taking this protein but honestly I have</p>
<p>not found this like wow yeah if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>this type you eat this and you always</p>
<p>feel better yeah I have not seen it I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry but not saying don&rsquo;t try you know</p>
<p>you try and see if it helps yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the best researcher is it work working</p>
<p>for you all I can tell you is that the</p>
<p>the eating plan that we put people on I</p>
<p>have a lot experience with that and we</p>
<p>it gets great results okay if you do it</p>
<p>whoopsie-daisy</p>
<p>oops I meant a block okay so Brian from</p>
<p>Minnesota lost 70 pounds on kedo Wow</p>
<p>congratulations Brian is cheese bad for</p>
<p>you um I consume cheese on a regular</p>
<p>basis because I&rsquo;m usually I&rsquo;m from</p>
<p>Wisconsin but here&rsquo;s the thing if you</p>
<p>have any prostitues if you have any</p>
<p>reactions to eating cheese then you</p>
<p>might want to cut it down because there</p>
<p>are hormonal things that could influence</p>
<p>you cuz it&rsquo;s from milk which actually is</p>
<p>meant for a baby cow but there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>good quality things and cheese</p>
<p>especially like vitamin k2 so I would</p>
<p>test it out and see if you feel better</p>
<p>with it but here&rsquo;s the key</p>
<p>make sure your cheese is grass from</p>
<p>grass-fed cows and organic and</p>
<p>preferably from Europe because it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a higher quality is it cheap cheese from</p>
<p>Europe tastes better brands in Italy</p>
<p>yeah oh my gosh well they you know all</p>
<p>the food over there these guys they they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put hormones in the meat or the</p>
<p>milk they don&rsquo;t spray stuff on their</p>
<p>food they use sulfur and phosphorus if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s needed it&rsquo;s just you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not doing all this stuff to their food</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually illegal yeah so you just</p>
<p>feel better when you eat it regardless</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re eating and it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have it doesn&rsquo;t tear the body apart it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t start to make the body sick it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give the body a hard time doing</p>
<p>its normal duties and right people feel</p>
<p>better someone asked about the anti I</p>
<p>think is a antibody test with</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s what do you do for that if</p>
<p>it shows positive you want to take a</p>
<p>very powerful antioxidant which is</p>
<p>selenium selenium selenium selenium okay</p>
<p>so I have a video on that the other</p>
<p>question is someone asked us I have a</p>
<p>gallstone two point seven centimeters</p>
<p>will the gall bladder formula dissolve</p>
<p>it I don&rsquo;t know but I do know that</p>
<p>the bile salts help to dissolve or</p>
<p>prevent the formation of stones so so</p>
<p>yeah so I think we can help you but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna have to try and see</p>
<p>see what happens</p>
<p>Sonia from San Antonio Texas had a</p>
<p>question about skin and fingertips</p>
<p>getting dry on keto that does not mean</p>
<p>more water that means you need essential</p>
<p>fatty acids you need more fat so either</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not having enough essential fatty</p>
<p>acids and I&rsquo;m talking about like the</p>
<p>fish oils are called of oil or it means</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not producing a file to</p>
<p>absorb that so it could be more liver</p>
<p>gall better or you need more of the fat</p>
<p>I have done a video on that as well for</p>
<p>those of you that are new on this</p>
<p>channel just realize we have a video on</p>
<p>every single question that you&rsquo;re asking</p>
<p>lemon juice for stones especially kidney</p>
<p>stones more than anything it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>good if you were to consume a cup of</p>
<p>lemon juice per day that would actually</p>
<p>greatly help you because the sit rates</p>
<p>prevent the oxalates and also drinking</p>
<p>enough water like about two to three</p>
<p>liters of water per day with the lemon</p>
<p>juice will actually help to prevent the</p>
<p>supersaturation that occurs with kidney</p>
<p>stones so you may want to check that</p>
<p>what do we got Karen any other questions</p>
<p>here does anyone have any questions</p>
<p>I was wondering read by your cheese um I</p>
<p>go to Trader Joe&rsquo;s and that&rsquo;s where I</p>
<p>get the cheese because it&rsquo;s um they have</p>
<p>some European cheese at a very good</p>
<p>reasonable price</p>
<p>some of these fly by so fast yeah okay</p>
<p>we already did the bone broth you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do bone broth anytime you only want to</p>
<p>do it with a meal if you want to if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re consuming it okay this person&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been it&rsquo;s either the same questioner ah</p>
<p>Kido for a number of months has diarrhea</p>
<p>all the time yeah I think that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fiber you might want to cut down your</p>
<p>fiber you could have either an imbalance</p>
<p>with good bacteria that&rsquo;s preventing you</p>
<p>from digesting the fiber or you could</p>
<p>have SIBO could be a couple of the</p>
<p>reasons but I would cut down the fiber</p>
<p>or change the different types of</p>
<p>vegetables you&rsquo;re consuming and that</p>
<p>should handle the diarrhea but if you</p>
<p>wanted to quickly stop diarrhea blend</p>
<p>plain kefir with blackberries blend it</p>
<p>up and consume that that will actually</p>
<p>stop diarrhea okay Dennis or Denise or</p>
<p>Dennis which are we Denise all right</p>
<p>Dennis you had a question miss fiber</p>
<p>with the week yeah okay so good good</p>
<p>question go ahead</p>
<p>awesome hey Denise since no one can hear</p>
<p>you I just want to tell people what you</p>
<p>said Karen&rsquo;s gonna tell people oh so</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been on keto and she&rsquo;s doing great</p>
<p>she got on it for inflammation and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>handled that she has no inflammation and</p>
<p>three major joins it&rsquo;s going really good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome and also she just wanted</p>
<p>a question can I mix the fiber and your</p>
<p>wheatgrass fiber in the movies grass</p>
<p>absolutely sure yeah no problem at all</p>
<p>not an issue because we grass juice that</p>
<p>I have is it doesn&rsquo;t have fiber in it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the juice part without the without</p>
<p>too many carbs good question all right</p>
<p>what do we have what if you had unwanted</p>
<p>body hair female or not sure that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>useless general yeah that&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>androgen so that&rsquo;s usually if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually you&rsquo;re probably talking about</p>
<p>female that means your insulin is too</p>
<p>high and by the way guys if you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>starting out and you&rsquo;re going to your</p>
<p>doctor demand that they do a fasting</p>
<p>insulin test because all the problems</p>
<p>from diabetes start with high insulin</p>
<p>not blood sugar you have normal blood</p>
<p>sugars for 10 to 20 years and then all</p>
<p>of a sudden you get diabetes but all</p>
<p>this starts with high insulin but they</p>
<p>never test it and a lot of times when</p>
<p>you get to IB you said to they give you</p>
<p>insulin so it&rsquo;s the problem of too much</p>
<p>insulin that&rsquo;s the real disease because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what creates the</p>
<p>problems with the eye the nerve the</p>
<p>heart and your brain okay so get the</p>
<p>fasting insulin test and then you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>know for sure sweating excessively yes</p>
<p>not successfully right excessively</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a that means you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sweating a lot adrenal czar overactive</p>
<p>so I would take for that I would take</p>
<p>more b1 and also I would follow my</p>
<p>videos oh that&rsquo;s much better follow my</p>
<p>videos on adrenal supporting adrenal</p>
<p>adrenal burnout draining off of tea</p>
<p>because I have probably over 100 all</p>
<p>right I&rsquo;m still hungry on keto could</p>
<p>this be an indication of a health</p>
<p>problem I&rsquo;m already eating over 80%</p>
<p>healthy fats it&rsquo;s still not satisfied</p>
<p>yeah what what you want to do you get</p>
<p>satisfied with nutrients okay so you</p>
<p>want to do fat and also nutrient-dense</p>
<p>foods like that that huge bowl of what</p>
<p>do they call that salad and all those</p>
<p>vegetables in addition to enhancing your</p>
<p>diet with nutrients will start to speed</p>
<p>things up but either you have insulin</p>
<p>resistance which is still being a</p>
<p>problem which takes some time or you</p>
<p>need to do more nutrient-dense foods to</p>
<p>really solve this problem shaky hands</p>
<p>shaking that&rsquo;s usually low dopamine I</p>
<p>tell you what can actually help you with</p>
<p>that I should do a video on this tremors</p>
<p>MCT oil MCT oil try some you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll like that okay Bonnie from Reno</p>
<p>had a question blood test before and</p>
<p>after keto you want to know what blood</p>
<p>test to do got Bonnie Bonnie</p>
<p>okay Bonnie I&rsquo;m gonna put you on hold so</p>
<p>Bonnie wants to know what blood tests</p>
<p>before and after keto what&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>important blood tests well you could do</p>
<p>a general blood test to look at your</p>
<p>cholesterol and your triglycerides and</p>
<p>your glucose and all that but I would</p>
<p>definitely get a test if your doctor</p>
<p>will do it it&rsquo;s called Homa ir and hama</p>
<p>ir is a test to pick up insulin</p>
<p>resistance and in that test they will do</p>
<p>a fasting insulin chest and they&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>able to look at it the problem is this</p>
<p>Karen there is no agreement on what is</p>
<p>normal or normal fasting and Flynn tests</p>
<p>so some doctors say it&rsquo;s xx some doctors</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s eight what are you saying it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>five but gonna be five because if you</p>
<p>look at the studies every degree over</p>
<p>five or every number over five there</p>
<p>seems to be more risk factors for</p>
<p>cardiovascular so you want do you want</p>
<p>at five or less that would be a good</p>
<p>good number again the body that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>my opinion</p>
<p>okay an opinion that one person good</p>
<p>question I would think so alright let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see so what&rsquo;s the difference between</p>
<p>MCT oil and coconut oil good question so</p>
<p>MCT oil is medium chain triglycerides</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a type of fat that is</p>
<p>actually in coconut oil so MCT oil is</p>
<p>extracting that fat specifically out of</p>
<p>the MC out of the coconut leaving the</p>
<p>other stuff so you have a more</p>
<p>concentrated version in the advantages</p>
<p>and benefits of MCT oil I have actually</p>
<p>15 I won&rsquo;t listed right here I won&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>through them but I will say this you</p>
<p>guys are very intuitive you&rsquo;re picking</p>
<p>up all my videos before I mean I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>him I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>but you guys are very in tune</p>
<p>the problem with MCT oil is that it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>refined product but it&rsquo;s actually good</p>
<p>to help feed the brain in the heart in</p>
<p>the beginning of doing keto but the</p>
<p>benefits are that it will actually feed</p>
<p>the brain in the heart</p>
<p>the fuel that it needs so there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of benefits but that&rsquo;s really the</p>
<p>difference if you just take coconut oil</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get em CTO but not in the</p>
<p>concentrated amounts okay so while</p>
<p>Karen&rsquo;s looking up another question</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to Rebecca from Haymarket</p>
<p>Virginia if you know that Haymarket is</p>
<p>yeah yeah so what&rsquo;s the the best</p>
<p>indicators of liver health I would say</p>
<p>some of the best indicators of liver</p>
<p>health would be looking down at your</p>
<p>stomach if you have something bulging</p>
<p>out in your stomach then we know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a problem with the liver and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called a fatty liver also your energy</p>
<p>levels through the day</p>
<p>because if you have a liver problem you</p>
<p>get fatigue chronically fatigued also</p>
<p>your joints are your joints free of pain</p>
<p>stiff painful joints would would</p>
<p>indicate liver problems and just</p>
<p>inflammation in general also the eyes</p>
<p>look at the whites of the eyes and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve some what your eyes are white so</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re yellow that&rsquo;s a liver problem</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re if you have these the skin if</p>
<p>you have these little these liver spots</p>
<p>and these little red dots that&rsquo;s a liver</p>
<p>problem so you look at the skin the eyes</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re bloodshot that&rsquo;s a liver</p>
<p>problem Brett if they have chronic</p>
<p>halitosis Dan it&rsquo;s a liver problem so</p>
<p>those are some of the indications thanks</p>
<p>Rebecca you just gave me another idea</p>
<p>for another video I was looking I was</p>
<p>looking for route it down note to self</p>
<p>then we have Anisha from Pennsylvania</p>
<p>had a question in Pennsylvania find out</p>
<p>where where where do you live in</p>
<p>Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Harrisburg Harrisburg well Karen is from</p>
<p>Allentown attempt there was a song about</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s nothing like this song okay</p>
<p>so had an injection to treat retinal</p>
<p>blocking in my left eye okay so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>guessing what you look can you do about</p>
<p>it right that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re asking like</p>
<p>how how to deal with that right now okay</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really really really good</p>
<p>product that you can research on the</p>
<p>internet and it&rsquo;s called ocular troph in</p>
<p>PMG it&rsquo;s from standard process ocular</p>
<p>trophy and PMG and then what you can do</p>
<p>is you can take it take one before bed</p>
<p>and it seems to really help the eye but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s damage to the other the two things</p>
<p>you should do is get on how the key down</p>
<p>in a fasting because high insulin and</p>
<p>high blood sugars prevent the healing of</p>
<p>the eye and also create a lot of</p>
<p>problems especially for the retina but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one last thing you can do Karen</p>
<p>you can take benfotiamine which improves</p>
<p>nerve tissue and guess what the guess</p>
<p>what the retina is it&rsquo;s part of your</p>
<p>brain sticking out of your eye so your</p>
<p>your retina is is basically a nerve</p>
<p>tissue and you can improve that by</p>
<p>benfotiamine which is a fat-soluble B</p>
<p>vitamin b1 which is really good for the</p>
<p>retina but don&rsquo;t forget the ocular troph</p>
<p>in PMG get that product it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>awesome let&rsquo;s answer two more questions</p>
<p>okay sure</p>
<p>let me read that back here get back here</p>
<p>Haven II suggest for someone dealing</p>
<p>with excessive saliva in the morning it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to go away until eating Wow</p>
<p>well the saliva is produced by the</p>
<p>different glands the product lands and</p>
<p>honestly I would look at making sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing the basic program correct</p>
<p>because it could be any number of things</p>
<p>like are you taking enough zinc for</p>
<p>example zinc can actually control the</p>
<p>different extra can glance that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with the function of that</p>
<p>and like are you for example when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in Quito one of the best foods you can</p>
<p>consume is shellfish on Quito because it</p>
<p>gives you the trace minerals so I would</p>
<p>look at the basics and try to get that</p>
<p>implement that and I think that can help</p>
<p>you greatly all right I you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>after 12:00 one more question</p>
<p>okay cuz I&rsquo;m starving it&rsquo;s true okay we</p>
<p>know about that too much manganese can</p>
<p>do what you know what you can&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>that up I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know what about</p>
<p>taking ketone powder now you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about something called ketones</p>
<p>salts there&rsquo;s two types of it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>exogenous ketones one our the salts and</p>
<p>the other ones are what&rsquo;s called esters</p>
<p>which are very expensive and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mainly for people that are exercising</p>
<p>and also people that have Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would do if I were you is I would</p>
<p>take that maybe while you&rsquo;re exercising</p>
<p>and it might help you</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m not needed for most</p>
<p>people I don&rsquo;t think you need it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that some people do but</p>
<p>make sure you don&rsquo;t ignore doing keto</p>
<p>healthily because that&rsquo;s the whole</p>
<p>purpose of this thing is to get healthy</p>
<p>not just to get you in ketosis ketosis</p>
<p>is one part of this program but you got</p>
<p>nutrients you have the the the purpose</p>
<p>of reducing insulin all the benefits</p>
<p>from that so that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>anyway guys I really sorry about the</p>
<p>situation with this streaming streaming</p>
<p>I am gonna try to find out what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on and try to handle this next week I</p>
<p>appreciate all your patience and your</p>
<p>tolerance for this problem and</p>
<p>patience and your patience being in</p>
<p>waiting room anyway have a great weekend</p>
<p>and we will talk to you next week and</p>
<p>stay tuned for some really cool videos</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll be releasing in the upcoming</p>
<p>days how&rsquo;d it go got it</p>
