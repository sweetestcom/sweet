<p>so today I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna be talking</p>
<p>about a few different people who have literally</p>
<p>just vanished into thin air</p>
<p>some have been</p>
<p>found and some have</p>
<p>not it&rsquo;s just very mysterious like what happened to</p>
<p>these people you know like it&rsquo;s just so weird</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done anything like this on my</p>
<p>Monday video so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get into that the</p>
<p>first mysterious case we will talk</p>
<p>about is a tail</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like some people say it&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>and then some people say it&rsquo;s very real so</p>
<p>you decide what you believe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a tale of a</p>
<p>young boy and he was</p>
<p>given the name</p>
<p>Lost Boy Larry</p>
<p>in August of 1973</p>
<p>CB radio operators in</p>
<p>California received a mysterious</p>
<p>transmission</p>
<p>from what seemed to be a</p>
<p>young boy pleading for help over the</p>
<p>radio over the</p>
<p>radio it was reported that a</p>
<p>young boy was crying and sobbing</p>
<p>uncontrollably</p>
<p>which made it difficult for anyone to</p>
<p>fully understand what</p>
<p>he was saying because he was crying so heavily and then</p>
<p>there was also poor signal which</p>
<p>added to the confusion</p>
<p>because people were hearing crying and sobbing</p>
<p>but it was also</p>
<p>breaking up</p>
<p>which made his please</p>
<p>incoherent tons of people</p>
<p>reported hearing this over the</p>
<p>radio airwaves what could be</p>
<p>heard was that the boy called himself Larry and</p>
<p>little Larry</p>
<p>claimed that he had been out with his father</p>
<p>rabbit hunting</p>
<p>in New Mexico</p>
<p>when they had been in a car accident</p>
<p>Larry said that the red and</p>
<p>white pickup truck</p>
<p>him and his father were in</p>
<p>it had overturned when they were</p>
<p>driving and it also like gone and swerved into a ditch</p>
<p>which then in the process</p>
<p>trapped the both of them inside</p>
<p>on the radio said he couldn&rsquo;t get out of the</p>
<p>truck because the doors were jammed shut</p>
<p>and there were</p>
<p>rock walls on either side so he couldn&rsquo;t open the door</p>
<p>either door</p>
<p>and he just couldn&rsquo;t he couldn&rsquo;t get out of the car</p>
<p>the little boy</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even know if he was little but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>assuming he&rsquo;s a little boy</p>
<p>he just sounded terrified</p>
<p>and he also</p>
<p>said that he thought his father had suffered a</p>
<p>heart attack or had been severely</p>
<p>injured his father</p>
<p>could have possibly been dead because he was</p>
<p>slumped over the</p>
<p>steering wheel</p>
<p>and had not</p>
<p>moved since the</p>
<p>crash he also</p>
<p>claimed that he had no food or water</p>
<p>and had no idea</p>
<p>where they were</p>
<p>little Larry here</p>
<p>he was using the</p>
<p>radio that was in the</p>
<p>truck to try and communicate with anybody he</p>
<p>could on the</p>
<p>outside but</p>
<p>again he had a really hard time because he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>to describe</p>
<p>where he was so anybody</p>
<p>could come and find them the</p>
<p>transmissions continued over several days</p>
<p>and were picked up by numerous CB</p>
<p>radio operators around New Mexico</p>
<p>and California</p>
<p>and even as far as</p>
<p>away as Wyoming and parts of Canada</p>
<p>so a lot of people</p>
<p>claim that they heard it</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s said that a lot of people couldn&rsquo;t fully</p>
<p>understand what he was saying because there was just</p>
<p>a lot of static happening</p>
<p>and it was like cutting in and out</p>
<p>and then on top of that</p>
<p>it seemed like</p>
<p>Larry who was on the radio</p>
<p>he was like often</p>
<p>changing the channels</p>
<p>which could have been out of fear or</p>
<p>panic or maybe</p>
<p>because he just didn&rsquo;t know how to work the radio</p>
<p>or clear connect with some help the signal</p>
<p>was also fading</p>
<p>in and out either from interference</p>
<p>or because the battery was dying</p>
<p>not helping</p>
<p>were the various operators out there who</p>
<p>began to mimic</p>
<p>the distress</p>
<p>messages as some sort of like sick joke</p>
<p>they were making fun of the boy</p>
<p>they were pretending to be him</p>
<p>pretending to cry</p>
<p>giving him a hard time because they believed that this</p>
<p>was a prank</p>
<p>like no one really knew if this was real or not</p>
<p>so people did report this</p>
<p>to authorities out in New</p>
<p>Mexico and them</p>
<p>thinking that there</p>
<p>is a missing boy out there in the wilderness somewhere</p>
<p>trapped in a</p>
<p>truck and slowly</p>
<p>starving to</p>
<p>death a search</p>
<p>party was organized</p>
<p>consisting of hundreds of people on the ground</p>
<p>as well as numerous</p>
<p>civilian and military aircraft they were</p>
<p>searching the remote areas of New Mexico from</p>
<p>where it was thought the</p>
<p>transmissions</p>
<p>could be originating from but</p>
<p>they turned up with nothing</p>
<p>when they were</p>
<p>searching they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t finding any</p>
<p>trace of a red and</p>
<p>white pickup</p>
<p>truck like the one described and</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>evidence that there was even a</p>
<p>Larry at all</p>
<p>and then at the same time</p>
<p>larry&rsquo;s signal</p>
<p>gradually faded and became more distorted</p>
<p>with static until</p>
<p>it stopped all together the authorities not long</p>
<p>after called off the search</p>
<p>just in case</p>
<p>stations were set up</p>
<p>in the area to pick up any more potential messages that</p>
<p>might happen</p>
<p>to emerge from the airwaves</p>
<p>but there was</p>
<p>only silence the thought that it may have been a hoax</p>
<p>was feeling more</p>
<p>and more true</p>
<p>to authorities and the people helping search</p>
<p>people were</p>
<p>thinking it was a hoax</p>
<p>because again</p>
<p>they searched high they</p>
<p>searched low</p>
<p>and they just</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t finding anything</p>
<p>but also authorities had</p>
<p>found no one by the name of</p>
<p>Larry that had been reported missing the entire time</p>
<p>no father and son had been reported missing</p>
<p>by any name</p>
<p>like in general</p>
<p>so authorities</p>
<p>officially said</p>
<p>this has got to be a hoax</p>
<p>put it out there to the public that</p>
<p>yeah this is a hoax</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s leave it</p>
<p>alone whatever</p>
<p>but despite</p>
<p>them officially</p>
<p>coming forward saying we believe this is a hoax</p>
<p>some of those people who had actually</p>
<p>spoken to Larry</p>
<p>insisted it was</p>
<p>all genuine</p>
<p>there was one guy he was an army surgeon</p>
<p>and he claimed that he had spoken to</p>
<p>Larry for nearly</p>
<p>3 hours and he</p>
<p>truly believed that the boy</p>
<p>it was in real</p>
<p>trouble like it wasn&rsquo;t a hoax</p>
<p>and then others believed that if it was really like</p>
<p>an elaborate</p>
<p>prank how come no one has ever come forward</p>
<p>claiming the like responsibility for it</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s what people were saying but then I was</p>
<p>thinking like well why</p>
<p>would they they probably</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>taxpayers money</p>
<p>for that search and</p>
<p>stuff but what if somebody</p>
<p>came forward and said</p>
<p>oh yeah that was so and so you know people talk</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t keep</p>
<p>secrets very well</p>
<p>little lost boy Larry</p>
<p>was this all a joke</p>
<p>or did a young boy really die out there</p>
<p>alone as his</p>
<p>radio signal and life</p>
<p>dwindled away</p>
<p>the case to this day</p>
<p>still remains unsolved</p>
<p>whether it was a hoax</p>
<p>or not and it has baffled people for years</p>
<p>but my thought on it because I thought this</p>
<p>story was really interesting</p>
<p>but I also found it a little</p>
<p>bish that this army</p>
<p>sergeant had talked to him for</p>
<p>3 hours allegedly</p>
<p>but within those</p>
<p>3 hours they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t able to get any more info and</p>
<p>or help him</p>
<p>figure how to get out of this</p>
<p>truck that he&rsquo;s locked in</p>
<p>for 3 hours</p>
<p>nothing like what did you talk</p>
<p>about for 3</p>
<p>hours he didn&rsquo;t give you any details like</p>
<p>where he lived</p>
<p>like what his</p>
<p>house looked like</p>
<p>you got nothing in</p>
<p>those 3 hours</p>
<p>the case of Lost Boy</p>
<p>Larry joins a long list</p>
<p>of strange phone calls from</p>
<p>those who have gone missing</p>
<p>another fairly well known case</p>
<p>is a strange call made by a 19 year old college student</p>
<p>named Brandon Swanson</p>
<p>now Lost Boy</p>
<p>Larry it could have been fake it</p>
<p>could have been real we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>but these next ones are real people for sure</p>
<p>why am I laughing it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny on the evening of May</p>
<p>14th oh my gosh didn&rsquo;t we do another case</p>
<p>where it was May 14th</p>
<p>whatever doesn&rsquo;t matter okay</p>
<p>on the evening of May 14</p>
<p>2008 Brandon had been out</p>
<p>partying with</p>
<p>a group of friends</p>
<p>in Minnesota</p>
<p>he decided to</p>
<p>leave the party</p>
<p>and head home and on the way home he managed to</p>
<p>crash his car into a ditch</p>
<p>now I read that he</p>
<p>crashed his car and then I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>heard that he just kind of like</p>
<p>went off the road a bit and got</p>
<p>stuck in a ditch</p>
<p>so I think it</p>
<p>might be he just got</p>
<p>stuck in a ditch to be honest</p>
<p>cause crash</p>
<p>sounds so dramatic</p>
<p>right like I</p>
<p>thought like oh my God it like overturned and I</p>
<p>Yeah anyway so let&rsquo;s just say he got his car like</p>
<p>stuck in a ditch</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s late at night</p>
<p>so Brandon gets out of the car</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s trying to get his</p>
<p>his car out of this ditch</p>
<p>so he can get himself home</p>
<p>but he was unable to get the car out</p>
<p>by himself and he had no</p>
<p>transportation obviously</p>
<p>cause his car</p>
<p>stuck in a ditch Bailey</p>
<p>he called his parents</p>
<p>at around midnight</p>
<p>asking for them to come and pick him up</p>
<p>Brandon told his parents</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>and where he was</p>
<p>and his parents</p>
<p>they were like sure</p>
<p>we will come and get you</p>
<p>and help you out or get your car</p>
<p>out of the stitch as well</p>
<p>Brandon told his parents that he was</p>
<p>near a small town</p>
<p>called Lind</p>
<p>but when his parents got to the location</p>
<p>Brandon was</p>
<p>nowhere to be found</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>you know so they&rsquo;re a little annoyed</p>
<p>so they call</p>
<p>Brandon and they asked him</p>
<p>can you explain where</p>
<p>where you are because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re here and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not here</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking to</p>
<p>Brandon and they&rsquo;re like okay we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>flashing our</p>
<p>headlights do you see our headlights you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re telling</p>
<p>Brandon find us</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sitting here</p>
<p>flashing it so</p>
<p>Brandon says</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see her car I&rsquo;m not seeing the headlights</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where are you</p>
<p>after driving around and talking on the</p>
<p>phone for around 45 minutes</p>
<p>without locating him</p>
<p>Brandon tells his parents on the</p>
<p>phone that he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna head to Lind</p>
<p>which is like the</p>
<p>small town that he&rsquo;s close by</p>
<p>or city whatever</p>
<p>he was just gonna</p>
<p>crash at his</p>
<p>friend&rsquo;s place for the</p>
<p>night so he</p>
<p>could just walk there like no problem</p>
<p>so they stayed on the</p>
<p>phone a bit longer</p>
<p>and Branded said that he</p>
<p>could see the</p>
<p>lights of the town in the distance and</p>
<p>and he can also hear running</p>
<p>water and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden on the</p>
<p>phone you hear</p>
<p>Brandon say</p>
<p>oh shit well actually it was more like this oh shit</p>
<p>and then the line went</p>
<p>brandon&rsquo;s parents</p>
<p>tried to call him back numerous times</p>
<p>every time the calls</p>
<p>went unanswered</p>
<p>brandon&rsquo;s parents did report this to authorities</p>
<p>and a search was launched involving hundreds of people</p>
<p>and even their trained</p>
<p>search dogs</p>
<p>and this search</p>
<p>would go on for around 4</p>
<p>months they</p>
<p>searched over</p>
<p>100 square mile</p>
<p>area without finding any</p>
<p>trace of him</p>
<p>whatsoever police</p>
<p>end up finding</p>
<p>brandon&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>but it was nowhere near</p>
<p>where he told his parents</p>
<p>he had been</p>
<p>authorities were also a bit confused because</p>
<p>the area that</p>
<p>Brandon had been</p>
<p>traveling he was</p>
<p>very familiar with this area so it was a mystery how he</p>
<p>could have gotten so hopelessly lost and how his car</p>
<p>had ended up so far off</p>
<p>off the path</p>
<p>now when they searched</p>
<p>brandon&rsquo;s card there was no evidence at all that</p>
<p>there was any type of foul play</p>
<p>or that he had</p>
<p>any desire to</p>
<p>wanna suddenly</p>
<p>run away there was just no evidence to prove like</p>
<p>where did he go</p>
<p>so there have been a lot of theories</p>
<p>suggesting what may have happened to</p>
<p>Brandon now I</p>
<p>guess there was a</p>
<p>river that was</p>
<p>close by and a lot of people believe that he must have</p>
<p>fell into the</p>
<p>river cause remember on the</p>
<p>phone he said he</p>
<p>heard the water</p>
<p>and then the oh shit</p>
<p>so it sounded like</p>
<p>maybe he slipped</p>
<p>he fell into the river</p>
<p>and then he was washed away</p>
<p>some believe that he was met with foul play</p>
<p>somebody must have like</p>
<p>come up behind him</p>
<p>he yelled oh shit because</p>
<p>maybe somebody</p>
<p>grabbed him</p>
<p>one thing that was really interesting</p>
<p>especially to like authorities and even his family</p>
<p>was that the</p>
<p>phone was purposely</p>
<p>hung up it&rsquo;s not like the</p>
<p>phone was disconnected it&rsquo;s not like the phone was</p>
<p>dropped and you</p>
<p>heard nothing or whatever</p>
<p>Brandon on the</p>
<p>phone said oh shit</p>
<p>and then the call was</p>
<p>disconnected it was</p>
<p>quick it wasn&rsquo;t oh shit</p>
<p>a little like ruffling</p>
<p>noise and then a thing</p>
<p>it was oh shit boom</p>
<p>you know what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>so that was something that</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>thought was like important to know</p>
<p>if he did fall into a</p>
<p>river let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>and you wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be falling into a</p>
<p>river and think to hang up your</p>
<p>phone right</p>
<p>if somebody came up behind you</p>
<p>grabbed you and you yelled oh shit</p>
<p>your first thought</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>let me hang up this</p>
<p>phone call you know you</p>
<p>would be on the</p>
<p>phone like so I just grab me or you would</p>
<p>throw the phone</p>
<p>you would drop the phone</p>
<p>if you fell into a river</p>
<p>you would drop the</p>
<p>it was hung up</p>
<p>he hung up the</p>
<p>phone because when I</p>
<p>first heard this</p>
<p>I was like oh yeah he must have just like fell into the</p>
<p>river or something</p>
<p>but it totally make like you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t hang up the</p>
<p>phone if you were falling into the</p>
<p>river like it&rsquo;s little</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>that can really make a big difference</p>
<p>another thing that was really important</p>
<p>is that when his parents were calling his</p>
<p>phone back the</p>
<p>phone rang and rang and rang</p>
<p>and then it went to voicemail</p>
<p>meaning that the phone was</p>
<p>still on and it was</p>
<p>still working</p>
<p>you know when your</p>
<p>phone is dead or a</p>
<p>phone is broken a</p>
<p>phone is shut</p>
<p>off whatever it goes straight to voicemail</p>
<p>or maybe it rings one 2 times</p>
<p>and then it goes to voicemail</p>
<p>but again his</p>
<p>phone was ringing ringing</p>
<p>ringing ringing ringing ringing and then it would go</p>
<p>to voicemail</p>
<p>so they knew that his</p>
<p>phone was still on</p>
<p>they have done searches</p>
<p>on and off throughout</p>
<p>the years and they have failed to find</p>
<p>any clue as to what happened to</p>
<p>Brandon Swanson</p>
<p>and it seemed like</p>
<p>Brandon had just vanished</p>
<p>into thin air</p>
<p>to this day</p>
<p>Brandon has not been</p>
<p>found it has led people</p>
<p>to sit and wonder what happened to Brandon</p>
<p>what happened why did he yell oh shit</p>
<p>and that could have been</p>
<p>his last words ever</p>
<p>Brandon has not been seen or</p>
<p>heard from since</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that weird</p>
<p>how do you just vanish</p>
<p>another strange case</p>
<p>is a 24 year old man</p>
<p>named William</p>
<p>Hurley so William</p>
<p>was originally from</p>
<p>North Carolina</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>ended up moving to Quincy</p>
<p>Massachusetts</p>
<p>oh my God okay look I know this isn&rsquo;t the time and</p>
<p>every video I have issues</p>
<p>right like every single</p>
<p>video I have issues</p>
<p>about me not being able to talk Massachusetts</p>
<p>this is one of</p>
<p>those words that I</p>
<p>cannot say I</p>
<p>think every</p>
<p>video I have a word that</p>
<p>but I used to get made fun of for this one big time</p>
<p>sorry Massachuse</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>visit you because I can&rsquo;t even pronounce your</p>
<p>state correctly</p>
<p>yes yes yes I see your comments</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an idiot</p>
<p>why are you</p>
<p>watching me then</p>
<p>joke&rsquo;s on you</p>
<p>anyways back to</p>
<p>William Hurley</p>
<p>so he moved to Quincy</p>
<p>and now this is like a suburb</p>
<p>of Boston and he</p>
<p>moved there because he</p>
<p>wanted or he was</p>
<p>living with his</p>
<p>girlfriend Claire</p>
<p>and on October 8th</p>
<p>2009 William</p>
<p>got invited to go to</p>
<p>his very first</p>
<p>I think it was a hockey game but he had</p>
<p>never been to</p>
<p>one before and his friend invited him and he was like</p>
<p>William was really</p>
<p>excited because he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>never been this was</p>
<p>gonna be his</p>
<p>first game he was</p>
<p>gonna go out with just his friend</p>
<p>and it was gonna be a really good time</p>
<p>after the first period</p>
<p>is when William</p>
<p>suddenly complained that he was like really</p>
<p>tired from work that he just wanted to leave</p>
<p>and and it was</p>
<p>weird because like he was so</p>
<p>excited you</p>
<p>know it just it didn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense like you were just really</p>
<p>excited to be here</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re tired but okay</p>
<p>his friend was like okay yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you</p>
<p>later man whatever</p>
<p>once he left the stadium he calls Claire</p>
<p>and he asks</p>
<p>for Claire to come and</p>
<p>pick him up</p>
<p>so claire&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>phone with them and she&rsquo;s like yeah like</p>
<p>where are you</p>
<p>cause I need your location</p>
<p>and William responded with</p>
<p>quote okay I&rsquo;m not 100</p>
<p>sure where I am</p>
<p>now when William said that a person</p>
<p>walking by and you</p>
<p>could hear him in the</p>
<p>background he says</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at 99</p>
<p>Nashwood Street</p>
<p>Claire hears</p>
<p>this she hears like the person who&rsquo;s walking by I</p>
<p>guess say that</p>
<p>and then William kind of</p>
<p>laughs and says</p>
<p>thanks man I</p>
<p>guess I&rsquo;m at 99 Nashwood</p>
<p>Street and claire&rsquo;s like all</p>
<p>right I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>right here I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>right around the</p>
<p>block I&rsquo;ll be there in like 2 seconds</p>
<p>and William says</p>
<p>my phone&rsquo;s at 1</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna die so I&rsquo;ll just wait for you</p>
<p>right here that way you&rsquo;ll see me</p>
<p>and then yeah so you won&rsquo;t be able to get a hold of me</p>
<p>now Claire his girlfriend</p>
<p>she said that she was</p>
<p>literally right around the</p>
<p>street it was</p>
<p>gonna take her</p>
<p>all of a minute to get to him I</p>
<p>guess she was like in the area</p>
<p>waiting for him</p>
<p>as she turned the corner to his location</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s looking for William she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>where is he</p>
<p>he said he was</p>
<p>right here like</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t see him so she&rsquo;s like okay well</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m confused</p>
<p>let me kind of like just</p>
<p>drive around</p>
<p>like in a circle and just</p>
<p>see if I spot him he probably</p>
<p>just kind of wandered a little bit like whatever</p>
<p>and this whole</p>
<p>thing was just really</p>
<p>weird to Claire and like to any of us</p>
<p>really it would be</p>
<p>because she just talked to him</p>
<p>she just heard him say</p>
<p>that he was</p>
<p>right there and she</p>
<p>again was a</p>
<p>minute away so</p>
<p>where did he go</p>
<p>in that minute</p>
<p>so this is just</p>
<p>like baffling to Claire she&rsquo;s like what the hell like</p>
<p>where did he go</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just gone</p>
<p>yes he&rsquo;s just gone</p>
<p>weird you wanna talk</p>
<p>about suspicious</p>
<p>bitch what the</p>
<p>like did he get sucked up by</p>
<p>aliens where do you go you know what happened</p>
<p>Claire goes home</p>
<p>cause she really</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know what else to</p>
<p>do she&rsquo;s been driving around the area for a minute and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not there so she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;ll just go home</p>
<p>maybe he went back into the game</p>
<p>his phone did die</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come back to the apartment</p>
<p>so Claire goes back to the</p>
<p>apartment she&rsquo;s waiting for him</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t show up</p>
<p>but she does</p>
<p>go to the authorities and she tells them what happened</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s just kind of strange</p>
<p>because how do you explain to them that yeah was a</p>
<p>minute away and then he was just gone</p>
<p>so authorities</p>
<p>search the area</p>
<p>right and they&rsquo;re looking they&rsquo;re not seeing anything</p>
<p>where is he</p>
<p>and then authorities come across</p>
<p>a chilling discovery</p>
<p>Williams cell phone</p>
<p>it had been found they</p>
<p>found it it was</p>
<p>smashed to pieces though</p>
<p>it was one of those old</p>
<p>school like that flip</p>
<p>phone thing</p>
<p>where it had the keyboard on it LG</p>
<p>flipped and then you can</p>
<p>anyways it was like</p>
<p>smashed in half and the</p>
<p>screen was smashed and it was just all sorts of smashed</p>
<p>now authorities</p>
<p>when they kind of like invested in</p>
<p>in this more they knew that when you drop a phone</p>
<p>or when like you try to</p>
<p>smash a phone the</p>
<p>screen smashes</p>
<p>but the whole</p>
<p>thing doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break in half</p>
<p>they were like okay this</p>
<p>phone has been like run over</p>
<p>because it was broken in half the</p>
<p>screen was smashed it was like missing buttons</p>
<p>it was hardcore</p>
<p>destroyed the way that they were able to</p>
<p>identify that this was his cell</p>
<p>phone was because</p>
<p>the one thing that they could</p>
<p>identify on the</p>
<p>phone was the serial number that was on the</p>
<p>phone itself on the inside at that time no</p>
<p>other evidence or leads were found</p>
<p>and authorities were apparently</p>
<p>really tight</p>
<p>lipped about the</p>
<p>whole case it was</p>
<p>weird but nobody knew why now on</p>
<p>October 14th</p>
<p>William harley&rsquo;s body was</p>
<p>found in the Charles</p>
<p>River he was</p>
<p>about 25 feet from the shore</p>
<p>and on his body they found</p>
<p>like his wallet and had cash on him</p>
<p>and there was no</p>
<p>visible signs of injury or foul play</p>
<p>or that there was like a mugging</p>
<p>maybe that took place</p>
<p>authorities determined that his body had been in the</p>
<p>water for just a couple of days</p>
<p>he had been missing for a</p>
<p>while now so</p>
<p>okay so then an autopsy was done on his body</p>
<p>and there was no physical injuries</p>
<p>that were found on him so</p>
<p>again they&rsquo;re like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing to determine</p>
<p>what happened they ruled it as a drowning</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like why</p>
<p>did he end up in the water</p>
<p>what do you mean a drowning</p>
<p>he just went out there and like went for a swim</p>
<p>while he waited for his</p>
<p>girlfriend no</p>
<p>and it was just a big mystery like what happened to him</p>
<p>now there is a theory</p>
<p>and I believe this is actually</p>
<p>being looked at seriously by authorities</p>
<p>now there is a theory that the</p>
<p>Smiley Face Killer was responsible for Williams death</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>under investigation they also looked at</p>
<p>Williams phone and they saw that he was</p>
<p>texting Claire and saying that he was really agitated</p>
<p>with somebody</p>
<p>that was sitting next to him now the</p>
<p>smiley face killer</p>
<p>let me know down</p>
<p>below if you</p>
<p>would like me to do a</p>
<p>Monday video on that but</p>
<p>the smiley face killer pretty much took</p>
<p>young college students</p>
<p>males killed them and then put them</p>
<p>usually in a body of water</p>
<p>and then would</p>
<p>leave like a</p>
<p>smiley face</p>
<p>by the body</p>
<p>but in this case like there was no</p>
<p>smiley face</p>
<p>found or anything like that but it</p>
<p>could have been</p>
<p>before the smiley face killer</p>
<p>branded himself</p>
<p>in william&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>in the autopsy</p>
<p>they do like they look for the physical</p>
<p>and internal damage and then they run a</p>
<p>toxicology separately and that</p>
<p>could take a little bit longer to get back</p>
<p>so they ran the</p>
<p>toxicology and they saw that</p>
<p>William had in his</p>
<p>system a date rape drug</p>
<p>so they believe that he</p>
<p>oh shit that scared me</p>
<p>oh fuck oh fuck so they believe now this is the theory</p>
<p>this is the theory</p>
<p>they believe that William was sitting with his friend</p>
<p>right the guy that was</p>
<p>annoying William</p>
<p>next to him put a date rape drug</p>
<p>in his beer</p>
<p>and then William that&rsquo;s when he</p>
<p>starts to feel</p>
<p>funny right</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s feeling</p>
<p>funny he&rsquo;s feeling really</p>
<p>tired and drowsy</p>
<p>he tells his friend</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not feeling well I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;m gonna go</p>
<p>so then he goes</p>
<p>theory is that the guy that was sitting next to him</p>
<p>who date raped him</p>
<p>probably got up and went out with him right</p>
<p>win William makes this</p>
<p>phone call to Claire he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like I have no idea where I am</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s disoriented he&rsquo;s got the</p>
<p>state rape drug in his system</p>
<p>and the guy</p>
<p>who was sitting next to him</p>
<p>was lingering</p>
<p>and when he</p>
<p>heard William say this</p>
<p>he loudly said</p>
<p>what do you say</p>
<p>the location</p>
<p>right and he did this to</p>
<p>throw Claire off they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t really over there</p>
<p>they were in a different location</p>
<p>but William didn&rsquo;t know because he hadn&rsquo;t even been</p>
<p>familiar with this area</p>
<p>the date raper</p>
<p>he was just like</p>
<p>throwing everybody off when William gets off the</p>
<p>phone that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>the person we don&rsquo;t know who</p>
<p>he takes the</p>
<p>phone he probably</p>
<p>smashes it or runs it over</p>
<p>he takes William he</p>
<p>does Lord knows what</p>
<p>throws his body into the lake now</p>
<p>again this is</p>
<p>still a theory</p>
<p>but when I was reading that I was like</p>
<p>yes like that</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>it could possibly</p>
<p>be the case</p>
<p>right but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still under investigation</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m curious to see how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna turn out to this day nobody</p>
<p>really knows what happened the whole</p>
<p>thing is so</p>
<p>weird hopefully</p>
<p>the family can get some closure</p>
<p>or understanding as to what happened</p>
<p>now we have another</p>
<p>story of a very mysterious</p>
<p>disappearance</p>
<p>Todd Geib was 22 years old</p>
<p>and on June 12 2005</p>
<p>Todd had attended a bonfire</p>
<p>party at Like an Abandoned Orchid</p>
<p>in Casanovia</p>
<p>Casanovia Michigan</p>
<p>Todd had lived with his cousin</p>
<p>and this abandoned orchid was</p>
<p>not far a mile and 1/2 away</p>
<p>it was a pretty</p>
<p>large bonfire</p>
<p>party thing that was going on</p>
<p>apparently there were over 50 people that attended this</p>
<p>party so apparently at this</p>
<p>party they were there for a</p>
<p>while and then a fight</p>
<p>broke out and it&rsquo;s unclear if Todd was involved in the</p>
<p>fight at all but it was</p>
<p>around that time</p>
<p>this fight breaks out</p>
<p>and then Todd</p>
<p>tells his friends at this</p>
<p>party that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take off he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna leave he just</p>
<p>is over it now Todd had told everyone that he was just</p>
<p>gonna walk back and</p>
<p>to his house the person who gave him a ride</p>
<p>kinda wanted to stay</p>
<p>Todd was just over it he wanted to go</p>
<p>now from this abandoned</p>
<p>orchid area it&rsquo;s just like a straight</p>
<p>shoot you just like walk</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would be able to get home mile and 1/2</p>
<p>no big deal</p>
<p>no one really thought much of it</p>
<p>he would be fine he reassured everybody he</p>
<p>would be fine</p>
<p>now between the time of 12 47 am and 12 57 am</p>
<p>Todd made a</p>
<p>series of very strange</p>
<p>phone calls</p>
<p>to his friend that gave him a</p>
<p>right to the</p>
<p>party he calls up his friend</p>
<p>and he simply says quote</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had enough</p>
<p>he hangs up</p>
<p>in another call he said</p>
<p>quote I&rsquo;m in a field end</p>
<p>quote and then the</p>
<p>phone goes dead</p>
<p>and then he hangs up the phone</p>
<p>the friend calls Todd</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ringy ringy ring</p>
<p>Todd answers or somebody answers but all that she</p>
<p>could hear was what</p>
<p>sounded like</p>
<p>either heavy breathing</p>
<p>or rushing of wind before the call cut out again</p>
<p>so you know that</p>
<p>that wind noise</p>
<p>when on the</p>
<p>phone or whatever you know kind</p>
<p>of it sounds like it</p>
<p>could be heavy breathing</p>
<p>so then according</p>
<p>to like police reports and what not the phone was</p>
<p>never used again</p>
<p>after that and no further calls</p>
<p>um had gone through Todd</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t show up at home</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>pretty concerned like</p>
<p>where is he</p>
<p>no one can get a hold of him</p>
<p>they go to authorities</p>
<p>and a massive search was</p>
<p>mounted to try and find Todd</p>
<p>there were around 1</p>
<p>500 police and volunteers</p>
<p>that helped</p>
<p>search there was also</p>
<p>an aircraft that was helping</p>
<p>search the orchid</p>
<p>the area around the</p>
<p>party and then the aircraft also</p>
<p>searched the stretch of road where he</p>
<p>was supposed to be or</p>
<p>would be expected to</p>
<p>walk to get home</p>
<p>again 15 hundred</p>
<p>people are searching</p>
<p>right and they find</p>
<p>nothing they</p>
<p>search thoroughly the area</p>
<p>3 times so the</p>
<p>whole thing is just</p>
<p>weird again like</p>
<p>where the f</p>
<p>did he go like how do you just</p>
<p>disappear so then July 2</p>
<p>2005 this is 21 days</p>
<p>after he&rsquo;s gone missing</p>
<p>todd&rsquo;s body was discovered</p>
<p>let me tell you</p>
<p>the discovery of todd&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>is the creepiest</p>
<p>and weirdest and most</p>
<p>suspicious thing ever</p>
<p>and it was weird</p>
<p>for 1t of reasons</p>
<p>first was that Todd was</p>
<p>found in a pond</p>
<p>right in the middle of the area that was</p>
<p>searched numerous times</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s no way nobody</p>
<p>would have seen his body</p>
<p>then there was</p>
<p>a fact that his body was reported as being discovered</p>
<p>standing upright</p>
<p>in the water</p>
<p>you want to talk</p>
<p>about creepy look</p>
<p>his body was</p>
<p>standing upright in the</p>
<p>water with his</p>
<p>head and his</p>
<p>shoulders breaking over the surface</p>
<p>standing he was</p>
<p>fully closed</p>
<p>his wallet was on him</p>
<p>so they knew</p>
<p>authorities knew okay he wasn&rsquo;t robbed he wasn&rsquo;t mugged</p>
<p>and authorities assumed that he just</p>
<p>drowned he drowned</p>
<p>stood there and then drowned</p>
<p>right mm mm mm</p>
<p>so then an autopsy was performed on todd&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>and it was found that he had no external injuries</p>
<p>but he had a</p>
<p>blood alcohol</p>
<p>content of 12</p>
<p>which then led authorities to rule it as an accidental</p>
<p>drowning while</p>
<p>under the influence of alcohol</p>
<p>now the case was closed but of course</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>whole thing is really effing</p>
<p>weird there are</p>
<p>those who do not buy the official ruling</p>
<p>todd&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>they hired their own</p>
<p>pathologist</p>
<p>so when they</p>
<p>searched todd&rsquo;s body they had determined that</p>
<p>okay look he had been missing for 3 weeks</p>
<p>and what they</p>
<p>had determined was that he had only been dead for</p>
<p>about 04:58 days</p>
<p>so that led</p>
<p>the family and</p>
<p>the pathologist to believe that Todd was straight up</p>
<p>snatched right</p>
<p>it was also determined that Todd had no</p>
<p>water in his lungs</p>
<p>and that there were many clues</p>
<p>that pointed to the body being placed in the</p>
<p>water after</p>
<p>death now if you drown</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>water in your lungs</p>
<p>he obviously didn&rsquo;t drown</p>
<p>based off this evidence it strongly</p>
<p>points to the possibility that Todd was in fact</p>
<p>murdered yet</p>
<p>the Michigan Police</p>
<p>the Michigan</p>
<p>State Police</p>
<p>have never reopened the case</p>
<p>sadly todd&rsquo;s family may</p>
<p>never know what happened</p>
<p>now once again</p>
<p>I guess I should have just done a</p>
<p>video on the</p>
<p>smiley face killer</p>
<p>once again theories</p>
<p>suggest it may have been linked to the</p>
<p>smiley face killers</p>
<p>now the smiley face killer is like that&rsquo;s like their</p>
<p>their factors</p>
<p>young boy or</p>
<p>early twenties</p>
<p>college student</p>
<p>water but again there&rsquo;s no like</p>
<p>smiley face found</p>
<p>in the area</p>
<p>which was their signature</p>
<p>maybe it was a copycat killer</p>
<p>maybe it was</p>
<p>the smiley face killers</p>
<p>but one thing we do know for sure</p>
<p>is that Todd did not drown</p>
<p>Todd did not go for a swim</p>
<p>but Michigan</p>
<p>State Police are like nope</p>
<p>sorry he drowned</p>
<p>he went for a swim he drowned</p>
<p>now the last mysterious case we have</p>
<p>is Henry Mccabe now Henry</p>
<p>was from Minnesota</p>
<p>now his disappearance has potential clues hidden</p>
<p>within an eerie voicemail</p>
<p>31 year old</p>
<p>Henry Mccabe went out to a</p>
<p>nightclub in Spring Lake Park</p>
<p>on the evening of September 7th</p>
<p>2015 so that evening at 2 28 AM</p>
<p>henry&rsquo;s wife Karen</p>
<p>who had been away</p>
<p>visiting um</p>
<p>California at the time</p>
<p>she received an</p>
<p>uncomfortable unsettling what the hell voicemail</p>
<p>on her cell phone</p>
<p>so on this voicemail it features 2 minutes of a</p>
<p>strange you cannot make out what he&rsquo;s saying or what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on there&rsquo;s moaning there&rsquo;s groaning</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s screams and there are growls you hear</p>
<p>on this voicemail like gurgling and really high pitched</p>
<p>screams of just terror</p>
<p>towards the end</p>
<p>of the voicemail there&rsquo;s an abrupt moment of silence</p>
<p>before you hear a voice</p>
<p>which could be</p>
<p>heard saying</p>
<p>stop it like it&rsquo;s a different voice</p>
<p>the last person to have seen Henry</p>
<p>was his friend who</p>
<p>he had been like with at the the club</p>
<p>and this friend</p>
<p>claimed that he had</p>
<p>dropped him off at a</p>
<p>local gas station</p>
<p>that was the last time this friend had seen him</p>
<p>police check the</p>
<p>gas station</p>
<p>video footage and they</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t see this friend</p>
<p>dropping Henry off</p>
<p>but they also don&rsquo;t have any evidence that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pointing to the friend</p>
<p>so police and volunteers thoroughly</p>
<p>search the area but they can&rsquo;t find any sign of Henry</p>
<p>investigators</p>
<p>were able to find the location of the final call</p>
<p>final call was determined to not be anywhere near</p>
<p>where the friend claimed</p>
<p>that he had</p>
<p>dropped Henry off the phone</p>
<p>had been pinged</p>
<p>miles opposite</p>
<p>of the location that was mentioned</p>
<p>authorities</p>
<p>searched the area where the</p>
<p>phone pinged</p>
<p>and not a shred of evidence was found</p>
<p>on November 4th 2015</p>
<p>henry&rsquo;s body was discovered</p>
<p>floating in Rush</p>
<p>Lake and autopsy came to the</p>
<p>conclusion that he had drowned</p>
<p>it was unclear</p>
<p>how Henry ended up in this lake</p>
<p>or if there was any foul play involved</p>
<p>and the case is considered to be</p>
<p>unresolved and ongoing</p>
<p>the finding of</p>
<p>henry&rsquo;s drowned body</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to be really consistent</p>
<p>with what is</p>
<p>heard in his</p>
<p>final voicemail to his wife</p>
<p>in the recording</p>
<p>the jumble of gargling growls moans and grunts suggests</p>
<p>some form of violence is being inflicted</p>
<p>on Henry and one investigator even said</p>
<p>the growls turn into high</p>
<p>pitched moans like he&rsquo;s moaning in pain</p>
<p>yet henry&rsquo;s body did not show any signs of</p>
<p>trauma or injury suggesting that</p>
<p>he was indeed hurt</p>
<p>so what does a</p>
<p>weird voicemail mean</p>
<p>who was behind the</p>
<p>voice saying stop it</p>
<p>very little of this case seems to make any</p>
<p>sense and authorities have not been able to come to a</p>
<p>conclusion on what the disturbing voicemail means</p>
<p>or even if the moans and other</p>
<p>noises came from</p>
<p>Henry at all</p>
<p>but for now the case of</p>
<p>Henry mccabe&rsquo;s mysterious disappearance and death</p>
<p>largely remains a strange</p>
<p>mystery that is</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>unusual missing person stories or vanishing stories</p>
<p>and just unsolved</p>
<p>mysteries hopefully</p>
<p>these people get some type of closure</p>
<p>on what happened to</p>
<p>their family or</p>
<p>their friends</p>
<p>let me know what your thoughts are down</p>
<p>below if you have any theories or</p>
<p>heard any theories</p>
<p>about these cases and also I</p>
<p>would love to hear if you like this type of format</p>
<p>little mini stories</p>
<p>I would love to know</p>
<p>other than that</p>
<p>please please please please be safe out there</p>
<p>I hope you have a wonderful day</p>
<p>today you make good choices</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
