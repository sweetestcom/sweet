    <p>Hi friends. This week I&rsquo;m gonna talk about something that kick-started my</p>
<p>spiritual awakening, which was feeling alone in a room full of people. Like</p>
<p>being around people and still feeling alone. That feeling and that like whole</p>
<p>thing going on inside me is what led me to discovering the whole like</p>
<p>spirituality shit. So I&rsquo;m gonna kind of break down what&rsquo;s going on, what happens,</p>
<p>and then like a couple things about how to deal with it. Because that&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>very weird feeling to have. It&rsquo;s like feeling lonely. So you go be around</p>
<p>people and then you still feel lonely even when you&rsquo;re around people. So the</p>
<p>whole thing that happened with me, I think I was 20, and I was at my cousin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house. I&rsquo;m very close to my cousins. Very very close to them. And I was sitting in</p>
<p>the living room with them and there&rsquo;s like four of them plus my sister was</p>
<p>there. So there&rsquo;s literally six people in this room and I&rsquo;m around all these</p>
<p>people that care about me and all these people that love me. And I just sat there</p>
<p>on the couch for a minute and I was like, why the fuck do I feel so alone? Like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>literally sitting here. I can reach out and touch my cousins sitting next to me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re that close to me. Why the fuck do I feel alone right now? Why do I feel so</p>
<p>isolated? I felt like sunken in. That&rsquo;s like the best way to describe the</p>
<p>feeling state was I just felt like sunken in and alone and isolated. Like</p>
<p>just meh. Like I just didn&rsquo;t feel connected to anyone. I didn&rsquo;t feel close</p>
<p>to anyone. I felt so fucking alone even though they were literally close enough</p>
<p>for me to touch them. And that did not make sense to me. And that&rsquo;s what sent me</p>
<p>on my hunt for answers of like, bitch someone got some explaining to do. God,</p>
<p>bitch, you got some explaining to do. Why do I feel like this? It don&rsquo;t make no</p>
<p>logical sense. That&rsquo;s one of the biggest things that really kicked off my</p>
<p>spiritual awakening. I have other stories and shit of like things that have</p>
<p>happened that are weird as hell, but I&rsquo;m not gonna get into that with this one.</p>
<p>But understanding the way that I felt was like, okay, I feel alone around people.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s not adding up so I need to look at it. So I started evaluating it</p>
<p>and looking at it and looking for answers, looking for like solutions and</p>
<p>shit and I couldn&rsquo;t find any. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here to share today. And the</p>
<p>first thing I want to talk about is what I realized about your internal world and</p>
<p>your external world. So everything going on inside you and everything going on</p>
<p>outside of you. That&rsquo;s two different worlds, but you&rsquo;re the only one that can</p>
<p>experience what&rsquo;s going on inside you. Like pain, emotions, feelings, sensations.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re the only one that can experience what&rsquo;s going on in you. And</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the only one that can validate it. You&rsquo;re the only one that knows the truth</p>
<p>of it. So like other people outside of you, you might say, oh I&rsquo;m sad. And they</p>
<p>can look at physically everything around you and everything you have going for</p>
<p>your life and like everything going on and be like, why the fuck are you sad?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get it. Like there&rsquo;s more going on internally people can&rsquo;t see. So</p>
<p>that was one of the biggest realizations I had around it was like your internal</p>
<p>world and your external world are separate and you&rsquo;re the only one</p>
<p>experiencing the internal world. That can be good and bad shit. So like all your</p>
<p>good things you&rsquo;re experiencing, all the good sensations, good feelings, and then</p>
<p>all the bad shit and all like the things that you&rsquo;re struggling with. If you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the only one experiencing them and you&rsquo;re the only one that knows about</p>
<p>them, you&rsquo;re gonna feel alone. Because there&rsquo;s a whole different world you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>living in other people don&rsquo;t know about and other people are not included in. So</p>
<p>in your external reality, yeah there&rsquo;s people there. But in your internal</p>
<p>reality, it&rsquo;s just you. And learning how to bring people in on my internal world</p>
<p>is what helped me not feel alone around people anymore. Because it wasn&rsquo;t a false</p>
<p>sense of connection. I was not being around people being in a whole separate</p>
<p>world that they don&rsquo;t know about. Like I started to reflect what was going on</p>
<p>inside me outside of me. So any problems I had, anything I was feeling, anything</p>
<p>going on inside me, I started letting people know. It was not a quick thing. I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t just all of a sudden like open up and just let everybody fucking know what</p>
<p>was going on. It was a progression of like opening up slowly and then getting</p>
<p>comfortable with it. Because if you&rsquo;re someone that like holds everything in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because it wasn&rsquo;t safe to let it out. So if you just expect yourself to</p>
<p>watch this episode and then flip your whole life and the way you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>living and like bring people in on your internal world, you&rsquo;re not. It&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>fucking scary as shit. You don&rsquo;t know what people are gonna do with what you</p>
<p>share. Like you don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re gonna like attack you and validate you,</p>
<p>not like you, judge you. It&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s a very scary thing to do. So preventing</p>
<p>people in is a safe route. But it&rsquo;s only gonna keep you safe and make you feel</p>
<p>more comfortable for so long. Like the point I was at. Where I felt so</p>
<p>disconnected from everyone around me and everything that it was fucking</p>
<p>painful to just hold it in. But sharing what&rsquo;s going on inside me was like the</p>
<p>cure. It&rsquo;s really what fucking fixed it. That alone is its own journey beach.</p>
<p>Because you have to get clear on like what is going on inside you. You have to</p>
<p>become aware of it. You have to stop judging it. You have to face it and the</p>
<p>truth of it. And one big thing people don&rsquo;t talk about with sexuality is how</p>
<p>detached you feel when you&rsquo;re hiding it. Because when I was going through this</p>
<p>period of like feeling so disconnected and isolated, that&rsquo;s when I really had to</p>
<p>stop ignoring the truth about my sexuality and tap into it and own it. And</p>
<p>it took a lot of internal work before I was able to allow that to reflect</p>
<p>externally and let people know what was going on inside of me. Because fear of</p>
<p>judgment and all that shit I was talking about before. And the closest thing I</p>
<p>found to this online was people talking about authenticity. And it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>sharing the truth of who you are with others. That will make you feel connected</p>
<p>to them. But I like to look at it like sharing what&rsquo;s going on in your internal</p>
<p>world. Going on in your brain. Going on in your heart. Going on in your emotions.</p>
<p>Like sharing all of that is what&rsquo;s not gonna make you feel isolated and alone</p>
<p>in it. Because people are aware of it. People can see it. And people want to be</p>
<p>there for you and comfort all parts of you. And they want to get to know all the</p>
<p>parts of you. But not being straight was a part of me that a lot of people didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know of before. And they were only able to meet me as far as I would allow them</p>
<p>to. Like the truth of me. People didn&rsquo;t get to know the full true me. Like I put</p>
<p>on the image that I was straight. So people just met me that far. They didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get to meet the side of me that wasn&rsquo;t. And when I say you have to let people</p>
<p>meet different parts of you, I&rsquo;m gonna sound like a wacko for a minute. But</p>
<p>every part of you is a different part. That makes no fucking sense. But give me</p>
<p>a second. I&rsquo;m gonna explain. So every emotion you feel and everything that</p>
<p>you experience and deal with inside of you is like a different part. That&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of like how I like to look at it because it makes it easier to reveal to others.</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m sad, that&rsquo;s a part of me people never got to see before. Like the</p>
<p>only emotions I would express before I became aware and like woke the fuck up</p>
<p>was anger and happiness. And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons that I went and found</p>
<p>like a counselor and a therapist. I was like trying to figure out why do I only</p>
<p>feel two emotions? Like I haven&rsquo;t cried since I&rsquo;m 12. What the fuck is wrong? Like</p>
<p>I had gone through so much heartbreaking shit and I hadn&rsquo;t shed a tear. Like I did</p>
<p>not know how to cry. I did not know how to feel sad. I would feel happy or I</p>
<p>would feel pissed off. There was certain periods of like numbness but those are</p>
<p>the only two emotions I was familiar with and that I could feel. I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel shit else. But if you have certain emotions, like if you feel sad, that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>part of you. You can let someone meet. Because like I was such a little tough</p>
<p>stuff back then. Like I used to hide every side of me that I felt was weak or</p>
<p>I felt would make people look at me at a certain way. And that led me to feel so</p>
<p>fucking isolated. But the parts of me that people didn&rsquo;t know about or know</p>
<p>even existed, I had to start sharing them. I had to start letting people meet the</p>
<p>different parts of me. Like the part of me that does get sad. The part of me that</p>
<p>is insecure. The part of me that does question things. The part of me that is</p>
<p>sensitive and gets his fucking feelings hurt. Because I&rsquo;m a Pisces. There&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>hiding that. But the part of me that doesn&rsquo;t just lash out in anger when he</p>
<p>gets his feelings hurt. The part of me that actually is just upset. So look at</p>
<p>it like introducing people to those parts of you. Like all the little aspects</p>
<p>of you. All the things that you feel inside. Every emotion state. Every feeling.</p>
<p>Your pain. Your desires. Your boundaries. What you like. What you don&rsquo;t like. All of</p>
<p>these are things that you need to allow people to meet or you&rsquo;re gonna feel</p>
<p>isolated forever. There is no fucking cure to it besides this. That I&rsquo;m aware</p>
<p>of. Because I hunted and searched bitch. I saw plenty of counselors. Plenty of</p>
<p>therapists. Fuck them. They didn&rsquo;t do shit. All these self-help books didn&rsquo;t do shit.</p>
<p>This is what I had to discover like in myself of like okay get out of your body</p>
<p>and observe the situation of what&rsquo;s going on. Why do you feel alone sitting</p>
<p>here in front of all these fucking people? Like Leo why would this person</p>
<p>alone sitting in a room full of people? What the fuck&rsquo;s going on there? And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I learned from my observation of like digging into my own</p>
<p>situation was I had to let people truly meet me. Like there was so much of myself</p>
<p>I was hiding and that&rsquo;s why I felt so fucking isolated. So it goes so deep and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in so many small little things. It&rsquo;s in the small shit. Everybody when they</p>
<p>make a change or they are going through something they wait for this big pivotal</p>
<p>moment of like this huge just discovery of like this secret. This hack. This trick.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t one. This is the trick but it&rsquo;s not a big thing. It&rsquo;s in every</p>
<p>little thing that you do. It&rsquo;s in all the little parts of you that you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>let people see. That you haven&rsquo;t let people meet. But you have to meet them</p>
<p>first. So like me with my sexuality. I had to stop suppressing it and stop trying</p>
<p>to disown it and like discard it. I had to face the possibility that I might</p>
<p>actually not be straight. By just holding space for it to try and understand the</p>
<p>way that I was feeling is what allowed me to meet it. Because if you sit here</p>
<p>and you just judge yourself you&rsquo;re never gonna even go down the rabbit hole of</p>
<p>exploring what&rsquo;s going on inside you. You have to just be able to give things</p>
<p>inside you your presence. So thoughts, feelings, emotions, desires, anything. Like</p>
<p>just observe them and see what the fuck&rsquo;s going on inside you. See if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true or not. Play into it. Entertain the thoughts. Don&rsquo;t just immediately shut it</p>
<p>down. Because when I would have sexual thoughts about like a fucking dude I</p>
<p>would shut it down immediately and I wouldn&rsquo;t even pay attention to it. But</p>
<p>that meant I was not able to meet the part of me that was not straight. I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t able to go down that. I couldn&rsquo;t even like face it myself. So that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>step one. Is like you have to face shit in yourself you&rsquo;re scared to face. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many things that are gonna completely deconstruct your self-concept. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the most painful fucking things you can go through. Is realizing certain</p>
<p>things going on inside you that are not accurate on the outside. So when I had to</p>
<p>completely like shift who I was on the outside I felt so fucking naked. Because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain safety in hiding things. And having like a wall up and</p>
<p>having like a shell of like who you present to the world. You present the</p>
<p>part of you that is safe and has gotten you accepted for your whole life. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what people typically present. So when you start realizing shit inside you that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t match that. You have to potentially go up to people looking like</p>
<p>a fucking liar and looking like you&rsquo;re fake. Because you have to reveal what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>truly in you. And it&rsquo;s a hard thing and people are not gonna judge you that hard</p>
<p>for it. But the more you discover yourself the more you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>switch the way that you present. And a lot of things are gonna change and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna feel so fucking uncomfortable. But this is the true way and the only way</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found to cure feeling alone around people. It&rsquo;s the only one. And it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>very tough road to go down. But it&rsquo;s the fucking true one that works. There&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many things you can do to numb out the feeling of feeling alone. You can</p>
<p>distract yourself. You can do fucking drugs. You can drink. Whatever. Do what</p>
<p>you got to fucking do. And so you&rsquo;re ready to face the truth of it. I just</p>
<p>laid you out the roadmap of how to do it. And how to fix the problem for real. A</p>
<p>lot of people teach like distractive techniques and things that are not truly</p>
<p>gonna bring you in touch with yourself. But that&rsquo;s the thing. You have to get in</p>
<p>touch with what&rsquo;s inside you and then represent it and let people meet that.</p>
<p>That is what&rsquo;s gonna make you feel cared about. If you just put on this image and</p>
<p>this shell to people, they&rsquo;re gonna love this shell. They&rsquo;re gonna love the</p>
<p>exterior you&rsquo;ve put on. They&rsquo;re not gonna love who&rsquo;s inside it. They don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>know who&rsquo;s inside it. And it&rsquo;s a normal thing for everyone to do this. Like</p>
<p>everybody does this to a certain extent. And everybody has to keep themselves</p>
<p>safe. And everybody presents what gets them accepted. It happens. And then you</p>
<p>become more aware. And then you have to change it. But my biggest thing is just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t attack yourself for what you discover in yourself. Because people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t warn you about the whole like self-development shit. Like it can turn</p>
<p>into full-blown self-hatred. And like you become disgusted with yourself. And you</p>
<p>fucking hate yourself. And that&rsquo;s what will lead you to wanting to no longer be</p>
<p>here. So take it easy. Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up for what you discover. And just</p>
<p>because you have a certain thought or feeling, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>automatically true. But you have to go through your fear that it could</p>
<p>potentially be true to face it and see what it really is. But if you want to</p>
<p>talk about law of attraction shit, oh my god I don&rsquo;t like to talk about that. A lot</p>
<p>of hate that people have comes from how they treat themselves. And now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna talk about being a vibrational match to how people treat you. If you</p>
<p>have a part of you, like the part of me that&rsquo;s gay, if I shut it down and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like, that&rsquo;s disgusting. Fuck no. Ew. I hate it. If I suppress that in myself, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna reflect in my reality. And when it reflects in front of me through another</p>
<p>person, I&rsquo;m gonna treat them and that trait exactly how I treated it in myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna fucking be disgusted by it. I&rsquo;m gonna want to push it away. I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>hate it. And that also works on the flip side. So as you start to get in touch</p>
<p>with yourself, and let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve like had a negative experience with crying.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;ve cried around someone and they like attacked you or called you</p>
<p>weak or called you a bitch or whatever it is. And now that&rsquo;s how you respond to</p>
<p>yourself when you&rsquo;re emotional because that&rsquo;s how I used to be. Anytime I would</p>
<p>get upset and cry, I would hide it. Anytime I would get upset and cry, I was</p>
<p>shamed. I was bullied. I was like made fun of. I was like pushed away by others. So I</p>
<p>stopped crying. I completely cut off from the part of me that was emotional and</p>
<p>that got sad. And that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t feel it. But I had to go back and like</p>
<p>revisit and re-meet the part of me that does get sad. And as soon as I changed</p>
<p>the way that I started reacting to myself, everyone else started reacting to</p>
<p>me differently. Like I said, the way you treat yourself inside is gonna reflect</p>
<p>on the external. So people that fucking hate the fact that they&rsquo;re gay or won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even acknowledge it, they just feel disgusted by it, are gonna feel the same</p>
<p>way when it pops up in front of them. And people that caretake themselves and care</p>
<p>about the way that they feel and are gentle with themselves when they&rsquo;re sad</p>
<p>or upset are gonna line up with people who are gonna treat them the same</p>
<p>fucking way. Because as soon as I started getting in touch with my emotions and I</p>
<p>started feeling sad and I stopped judging myself for feeling sad, I lined</p>
<p>up with people who cared about the way that I felt and understood that I got</p>
<p>sad and didn&rsquo;t care and didn&rsquo;t shame me. Like they were concerned. They wanted to</p>
<p>comfort me. They wanted to be there for me. As soon as you switch how you treat</p>
<p>yourself internally, that will reflect. It will match. You will become a match to</p>
<p>people who will treat you the same way. That&rsquo;s a real weird fucking dynamic but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it happen too many times. I&rsquo;ve experienced it too many times for me to</p>
<p>just say, oh it&rsquo;s an idea. Oh it might not be true. I think it&rsquo;s fucking true. Whether</p>
<p>you want to take that for yourself or not, go explore it. Don&rsquo;t ever just take</p>
<p>something anyone says like and assume that it&rsquo;s true. Fucking question it for</p>
<p>yourself. Test it out for yourself. Change the way that you operate and the way</p>
<p>that you look at yourself or a certain aspect of you. Switch the way that you do</p>
<p>it and then see who you line up with and see how they treat you when they see</p>
<p>that part. But this really just comes down to letting people see who you are</p>
<p>and see what you feel and see what you experience in your internal world</p>
<p>because you will no longer feel alone in it. You&rsquo;re the only one in it so no</p>
<p>shit you feel alone. Like it makes so much sense but I know when you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through it, it&rsquo;s very confusing. But I hope this brought some clarity. But I</p>
<p>want to give you a little bit of reassurance because this scared the</p>
<p>absolute fuck out of me and I felt like I had nowhere to go and no one to talk</p>
<p>to when I started doing all of this because people don&rsquo;t fucking get this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big reason why I started the Facebook community for all of you</p>
<p>guys. The link will be in the description if you want to join it. It&rsquo;s a private</p>
<p>Facebook group for all of us. It&rsquo;s free. It&rsquo;s just a place where you can go to</p>
<p>talk to people who get it. You can go ask for advice. You can go post funny memes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a place where all of us can go and create a little community where we</p>
<p>can be there for each other, give each other advice, relate, vent, comfort,</p>
<p>whatever you fucking need. You have a group of people who think the same way</p>
<p>you do and are on the same journey as you because I know how fucking lonely it</p>
<p>is. So that&rsquo;s why I wanted to create that. But my whole point with bringing that up</p>
<p>is when you feel like you&rsquo;re alone and you&rsquo;re trying to like sort all this out</p>
<p>it gets very weird and you feel like uncomfortable and you don&rsquo;t have anyone</p>
<p>you can talk to. But I just want to give you the reassurance while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>learning to navigate yourself and switch your relationship to all the different</p>
<p>parts of you inside yourself. Don&rsquo;t be scared to show these parts to people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be. But I want to reassure you that you&rsquo;re okay too and</p>
<p>people want to be there for you. Like after I started opening up about the</p>
<p>truth of myself and what I was experiencing and what I was feeling to</p>
<p>my friends a long time ago, my friend Summer literally looked at me and was</p>
<p>like, Leo I&rsquo;ve wanted to be there for you so long. Like I&rsquo;ve literally just</p>
<p>watched you and I&rsquo;ve just been friends with this shell and I&rsquo;ve wanted to be</p>
<p>able to be there for you but you wouldn&rsquo;t let anyone in. You wouldn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>say anything was wrong. She&rsquo;s like, I could tell but I didn&rsquo;t know what was</p>
<p>going on and I wanted to be there for you. And I had a lot of friends say that</p>
<p>and a lot of people in my life. But people want to be there for you. It makes</p>
<p>people feel of use and people like to feel of use. So if you give someone a</p>
<p>chance to be of use to you by being there for you, by accepting you, by</p>
<p>comforting you, they&rsquo;re gonna like that and it&rsquo;s gonna make them feel more</p>
<p>attached to you and you&rsquo;ll feel more attached to them. People want to feel of</p>
<p>use. So give them that. Allow them to be useful to you. Allow them to care about</p>
<p>you. Allow them to accept you. You have to give them the chance of that because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m someone who is extremely accepting because I know how hard it is to be</p>
<p>rejected and how fucking terrible that feels. So when someone is struggling with</p>
<p>something that they&rsquo;re fucking petrified to like admit to anyone, I love when they</p>
<p>come to me and admit it to me because I get the chance to be such a pivotal</p>
<p>fucking moment in their life of them saying something that they&rsquo;re scared</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be rejected for and I get to accept them and be there for them</p>
<p>because I know how good it feels to have someone accept you. So I get to be that.</p>
<p>You know what I mean? Like allow people to be of use to you. I love it. I love to</p>
<p>be there for people. I love to be that pivotal moment and that piece of support</p>
<p>that they need and you being scared to let someone be that for you is robbing</p>
<p>both of us. You&rsquo;re robbing yourself of the connection and you&rsquo;re robbing me of</p>
<p>feeling useful to you and allowing me to be there for you. So I know there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of guilt and shame around sharing shit inside of you like especially feelings</p>
<p>but I want to reassure you there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it and people want to</p>
<p>be there for you. I fucking promise. Go in the Facebook community. Literally go do</p>
<p>it and watch how much support you&rsquo;re fucking flooded with. Whether you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>question your sexuality or whatever it is. It&rsquo;s a private group so anything you</p>
<p>post in there it&rsquo;s only seen by people I&rsquo;ve accepted and allowed to be in the</p>
<p>group. So it&rsquo;s all people who are supportive and people who will be there</p>
<p>for you. Like it&rsquo;s all people just like you who fucking get it and are all</p>
<p>struggling with their own shit. Literally go post whatever you&rsquo;re dealing with in</p>
<p>that fucking group especially if it&rsquo;s about your sexuality and watch how many</p>
<p>people flock to support you and be there for you because they genuinely care. Not</p>
<p>because they get anything for it. They don&rsquo;t get shit for it. Like people just</p>
<p>genuinely care about you and I&rsquo;m excited for you to experience that. Alright so</p>
<p>before we jump into what would Leo do I just want to say if you like this</p>
<p>episode so far and you feel like it&rsquo;s helpful leave this video a thumbs up and</p>
<p>share it with someone that you know. Share it with anyone that you think will</p>
<p>help them because I want to help get this out because this is what truly</p>
<p>fucking saved me. These are the realizations and the shit that like got</p>
<p>me out of where I felt so stuck in. So I want this to touch as many people as</p>
<p>possible. So send this to anyone you think it will help. Share it wherever you</p>
<p>want. If you put it on your Instagram story like share that you&rsquo;re listening</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll reshare it to mine. I love when you guys fucking do that. But something big</p>
<p>people ask me about a lot is eating disorders. Go to a therapist or go to a</p>
<p>nutritionist who has struggled with eating disorders. Go to them because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll teach you how to fucking get through it. They&rsquo;ll teach you how to deal</p>
<p>with it. I&rsquo;ve recovered from fucking binge eating. I can teach someone how to</p>
<p>do it. It&rsquo;s just a matter of finding someone who has done what you want to do.</p>
<p>Like I went from cripplingly fucking insecure to like&hellip; But let&rsquo;s jump into</p>
<p>what would Leo do? So the first situation someone is asking they wrote y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>people write like long paragraphs but I like when they&rsquo;re short and like to the</p>
<p>point but sometimes I need more details. But this person basically vented about</p>
<p>like how they can&rsquo;t find like a good therapist or a good coach. So they said</p>
<p>how do you find a good therapist or a good coach? I&rsquo;m just gonna like summarize</p>
<p>it like that. So if you&rsquo;re looking for a fucking therapist go to a therapist who</p>
<p>has experience with what you&rsquo;ve been through. So if you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>suicidal thoughts do not go to a motherfucking therapist that does not</p>
<p>know about that. Has not experienced it and doesn&rsquo;t know how to navigate it</p>
<p>because all they&rsquo;re gonna spit at you is what they&rsquo;ve learned from a fucking book.</p>
<p>You need the people who have walked through the fucking murky ass water that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stuck in. You need to find the people that have made it out of the hole</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stuck in. They know how to get out truly not by throwing a fucking</p>
<p>medication at you. Like they&rsquo;re the ones that can truly get you through it. Same</p>
<p>thing with coaches. If you want to hire a coach because a lot of people don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>therapists. If you want to hire a coach hire a coach who has achieved what you</p>
<p>want to achieve or has repaired something in themselves that you want to</p>
<p>repair. Same thing with like a trainer. If you want to hire a personal trainer hire</p>
<p>a motherfucker that looks the way you want to look. You don&rsquo;t go hire the fat</p>
<p>at the personal training gym because they&rsquo;re a personal trainer. Clearly they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what the fuck they&rsquo;re doing. They went to school they got a</p>
<p>certification. It doesn&rsquo;t mean they know what the fuck to do with it. They read</p>
<p>some books. Okay so go to people who have what you want to have. Who have been</p>
<p>through what you&rsquo;re struggling with or who look the way you want to look. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my fucking like across the board for all this shit. Like don&rsquo;t go to someone who</p>
<p>has not made it out of what you&rsquo;ve been through. Sure other people can help and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be a little difficult to find like certain things. Confident and so</p>
<p>assured in myself you can&rsquo;t tell me shit. Like no one can like penetrate like the</p>
<p>fucking like shield of confidence I have now. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m you&rsquo;re not fucking</p>
<p>with me. So just remember me saying that. Anyone can get a title. Anyone can get a</p>
<p>license. Anyone can get a fucking degree. It does not mean they&rsquo;re good. It does</p>
<p>not mean they&rsquo;re credible. It means they&rsquo;ve read books, studied shit, and</p>
<p>taken tests and passed. All that means is they&rsquo;re qualified on paper. It does not</p>
<p>mean that they&rsquo;re capable of helping you. Qualified does not mean capable. Okay</p>
<p>just remember me saying that when you&rsquo;re trying to find anyone that can help you.</p>
<p>Go to motherfuckers who know how to get what you want. Trust me. Because I went to</p>
<p>a couple therapists that were not struggling with what I was struggling</p>
<p>with and I kept getting faced with well how does that make you feel? Are you</p>
<p>opposed to getting on medication? No bitch I don&rsquo;t want to fucking get on</p>
<p>medication. I want you to help me through my goddamn problems and they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>offer anything and that&rsquo;s one thing that I strive so hard to offer like my</p>
<p>one-on-one clients is like tools. Like literal ways to manage your fucking</p>
<p>emotions and manage everything you&rsquo;re dealing with. I&rsquo;m not just gonna say oh</p>
<p>just talk about it. Oh just journal it down. No I&rsquo;m gonna teach you how to deal</p>
<p>with the thoughts when they come up. Reminders to tell yourself. Ways to go</p>
<p>about and navigate situations and ways to like stay on track and get yourself</p>
<p>like back to normal. Like I I fucking hate people that just like are like oh</p>
<p>just talk to me. Like a therapist should not just be a fucking ear. Okay venting</p>
<p>does nothing. Sorry. You could vent on a piece of paper for free. The fuck? But the</p>
<p>people that have been through what you&rsquo;re going through are not just gonna</p>
<p>sit there and listen. So when you speak what you&rsquo;re going through they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>relate to that pain because they&rsquo;ve been there and they&rsquo;re gonna want to give you</p>
<p>as much as they can. That&rsquo;s how I fucking am. When someone comes to me and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting in a situation that I&rsquo;ve struggled through and made it out of I</p>
<p>know what they need to get out of it and I&rsquo;m gonna give it to them. I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>over fucking deliver because I want to save them from it because I know how</p>
<p>painful that shit was. So finding someone who&rsquo;s been through what you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>through is the one that can truly help. I&rsquo;m just gonna leave it there. Okay so</p>
<p>the next situation I&rsquo;m gonna try not to laugh. I can&rsquo;t even read it and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>laughing. Okay someone said my ex got me Legos for the last four years when we</p>
<p>were together. I don&rsquo;t know if I should keep them or throw them away.</p>
<p>Legos? Like the toys? I don&rsquo;t know your age. I don&rsquo;t know your situation. There</p>
<p>are some adults that are into Legos. If that&rsquo;s your thing do it. Mitch I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>laughing at you I&rsquo;m just laughing at the situation. I&rsquo;m kinda. But like are you</p>
<p>attached to the Legos just because he gave them to you or do you love Legos?</p>
<p>Like if you have an actual collection of like Legos and shit that you like love</p>
<p>and enjoy I&rsquo;d say if they&rsquo;re like a key piece to completing a collection or you</p>
<p>value what they are aside from who gave them to you keep them. If you&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>keeping something from an ex because it came from the ex get the fuck rid of it.</p>
<p>Trust me I&rsquo;ve been there. I burnt so much shit and sold so much shit from</p>
<p>previous relationships just because I don&rsquo;t fucking want to be reminded of you.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s certain things that I love just them for what they are. There&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>attachment to who gave it to me and I can dissociate that. But to hold on to</p>
<p>things like oh just because your ex gave them to you get the fuck rid of them.</p>
<p>Trust me there&rsquo;s this weird energetic thing that happens when someone gives you</p>
<p>a gift and you keep it because it&rsquo;s like from them. You&rsquo;re like emotionally like</p>
<p>attached still and I can&rsquo;t tell you how good it feels to light that shit on fire</p>
<p>because I had a fucking fire pit with a bunch of shit from my exes like it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>nice to just watch it burn. But my astrology chart is like my element is</p>
<p>fire like I manifest through fire I cleanse through fire like fire is my</p>
<p>thing like other people might like other shit but I&rsquo;ve had my chart read and shit</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve always been obsessed with fire but it makes sense. So get rid of it if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only keeping it just because of who it&rsquo;s from. Trust me you&rsquo;re gonna feel</p>
<p>so like cut off from it and like moved on and detached you&rsquo;re gonna feel like a</p>
<p>weight is lifted off of you just trust me on it it makes no fucking sense it</p>
<p>makes a lot of sense but it makes no sense but just trust me don&rsquo;t keep shit</p>
<p>just because of who gave it to you. If you don&rsquo;t like it get rid of it. Okay so</p>
<p>the next situation I&rsquo;m gonna have to read. Someone said what would you do if</p>
<p>you knew someone was disrespectful to you throughout the entire relationship</p>
<p>embarrassed you by talking to all their friends about you but now they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>recognized it and decided to improve themselves now that you&rsquo;ve distanced</p>
<p>yourself will they revert back to those behaviors once they get me back</p>
<p>emotionally or is there a chance they&rsquo;ve truly mean their words they seem sincere</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been asking them for so long so someone being disrespectful about you</p>
<p>and to you in a relationship is a fucking no-go either leave them or smack</p>
<p>the fuck out of them but embarrassing you to their friends no bitch that ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna fly because for you to go around their friends now is gonna feel</p>
<p>uncomfortable if they went running their fucking mouth about you and ruined</p>
<p>your character and ruined your image to all these fucking people and they think</p>
<p>that you can still coexist with them that&rsquo;s weird that&rsquo;s uncomfortable</p>
<p>because what are they gonna do go to all their friends and be like hey I lied</p>
<p>my ex was not actually like this and we&rsquo;re back together like they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to face looking like a liar or you&rsquo;re gonna have to face owning the</p>
<p>shit that you did if it was fucked up and they&rsquo;re just gonna be looking at you</p>
<p>like what the hell that&rsquo;s why I say shut your</p>
<p>fucking mouth when you&rsquo;re dating somebody</p>
<p>your fucking relationship problems stay between you two do not run your</p>
<p>fucking mouth so I get your frustration with that shit because once you try and</p>
<p>embarrass me or attack my character you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>bitch now we&rsquo;re done because there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>recovering from that you&rsquo;re just gonna go like share shit and try and make me</p>
<p>look bad intentionally fuck you that&rsquo;s childish and he&rsquo;s someone</p>
<p>that needs to defend his image and his reputation</p>
<p>with the people around him and he cares about that more than he cares about how</p>
<p>he makes you look or how he makes you feel</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a dangerous motherfucker to deal with because he wants to get to</p>
<p>people first with his fucking story to paint an image and save his self-concept</p>
<p>before they find out the truth and find out he was the dick or you both</p>
<p>were at fault like he people like to look like the</p>
<p>little innocent one so if you feel like that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>watch the fuck out with that but you said he realized he</p>
<p>fucked up once you decided to distance yourself</p>
<p>convenient so if you&rsquo;re thinking about giving this another shot</p>
<p>I think you need to test it like slowly ease into seeing what&rsquo;s going on it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t jump back into a relationship don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking commit right back off the bat fuck that he don&rsquo;t deserve that shit</p>
<p>when you fuck up it&rsquo;s like you have to earn it back</p>
<p>so agree to give it another shot but be hesitant</p>
<p>be distant and make him fucking prove himself the first time he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>disrespectful you walk I don&rsquo;t give a fuck that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a real hard thing is like when someone&rsquo;s fucked up and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having to like be reproven that they won&rsquo;t behave a certain way</p>
<p>as soon as they fuck up if you take them back and like be okay with it</p>
<p>it just establishes the pattern of like that&rsquo;s acceptable behavior and they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>keep fucking doing it you can give him another chance but he</p>
<p>has one he fucks up he&rsquo;s out he&rsquo;s done that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re going through like the reproving themselves period</p>
<p>because if you think you&rsquo;re just gonna run a relationship off of like you get</p>
<p>one chance forever it&rsquo;s never gonna fucking work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too much tension and it&rsquo;s gonna be like walking on eggshells but</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s trying to prove himself again and make you like get close to him again</p>
<p>and trust him again you&rsquo;re gonna have to give him one</p>
<p>fucking shot and be very serious about it like</p>
<p>stay distant so that when you when he does fuck up you cut him and you walk</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not that fucking hard but if you just jump back in it emotionally</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna make things a lot more difficult but while he&rsquo;s trying to prove</p>
<p>himself he gets one shot after you feel like you trust him more</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good don&rsquo;t tell him he only has one shot that&rsquo;s for you to know because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want him like pretending to be on like his best</p>
<p>behavior don&rsquo;t tell him he has one shot just allow him to show if he&rsquo;s truly</p>
<p>changed or not and watch his actions you have to get into another situation</p>
<p>when he gets pissed off does he fucking disrespect to you what</p>
<p>happens do not just jump back in you fucking like put your toe in the</p>
<p>water and you put like a little knob itself maybe like</p>
<p>like an ankle or something you don&rsquo;t fucking just jump back in you test it</p>
<p>and you let him prove that he does see it and he is changed</p>
<p>or he hasn&rsquo;t and if he hasn&rsquo;t you cut that shit and you never fucking feel bad</p>
<p>about it okay love you that&rsquo;s all i got for this</p>
