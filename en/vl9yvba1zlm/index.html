<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>welcome back everyone we&rsquo;re here with</p>
<p>another q a</p>
<p>on the topic of Health anything that I</p>
<p>say is definitely not meant to replace</p>
<p>your medical care check with your doc</p>
<p>before taking any of the advice but we</p>
<p>have some real interesting things to</p>
<p>talk about and some great questions that</p>
<p>we want to answer let&rsquo;s just Dive Right</p>
<p>In Steven do as many as we can excellent</p>
<p>idea let&rsquo;s start off with social media</p>
<p>today we love them Yaz media from</p>
<p>YouTube how to combine my fat intake</p>
<p>with oh good here&rsquo;s another one of these</p>
<p>words lithosis in my gallbladder I am</p>
<p>not convinced I have to have it removed</p>
<p>so did I say that right come on fat</p>
<p>intake with lithosis is how it&rsquo;s spelled</p>
<p>so what here here&rsquo;s the thing I I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like missing a little bit</p>
<p>information I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>um if you have</p>
<p>large stones or no stones or small</p>
<p>stones but the point is that um</p>
<p>realize that gallstones don&rsquo;t just come</p>
<p>from cholesterol It&rsquo;s a combination of</p>
<p>cholesterol and a lack of bile so if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough bile then you get this</p>
<p>super concentrated um like uh</p>
<p>cholesterol stone that can develop so</p>
<p>the solution is to increase the amount</p>
<p>of bile salt okay and that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>help you</p>
<p>um you know of course if you if you do</p>
<p>the diet that I recommend you&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>combination of</p>
<p>great uh you know plants and vegetables</p>
<p>and things like that with your protein</p>
<p>with your fat and um and also um I have</p>
<p>so many videos in gallbladder you should</p>
<p>watch those but uh I would start taking</p>
<p>a bile salt formula</p>
<p>um maybe gallbladder formula and just</p>
<p>start taking that a regular basis just</p>
<p>to start to reverse this ratio so you</p>
<p>can resolve it and then maybe don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>consume a massive amount of fat right</p>
<p>now until you get things situated</p>
<p>um I had a lot of gallbladder problems</p>
<p>early on and of course my problem was</p>
<p>not just saturated fat it was the</p>
<p>combination of saturated fat and all the</p>
<p>carbs I was doing at the same time that</p>
<p>probably created the problem</p>
<p>okay very good let&rsquo;s see now I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if Sandra&rsquo;s pushing the envelope</p>
<p>here on YouTube but she wants to know if</p>
<p>she can have her sourdough bread as a</p>
<p>part of the keto diet and can I use</p>
<p>coconut or almond flour maybe that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>what do you think doc</p>
<p>is she gonna make the bread out of the</p>
<p>coconut flour well that&rsquo;s what I mean</p>
<p>yeah do that I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>um that would be interesting if you can</p>
<p>make a sourdough bread of that flower</p>
<p>that that would be that would be good I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what it would taste like</p>
<p>but um it might be um edible would that</p>
<p>meet the requirements of being keto</p>
<p>perhaps</p>
<p>yeah if there&rsquo;s no other</p>
<p>um grains in there if there&rsquo;s not added</p>
<p>grains because sometimes the you see</p>
<p>these recipes are these keto friendly um</p>
<p>breads but then it has the tapioca in</p>
<p>there it has uh you know gluten wheat</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s protein</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s undigestible by humans so you</p>
<p>really have to just</p>
<p>have knowledge of what you should have</p>
<p>and what you should avoid okay very good</p>
<p>sander we would love to hear back from</p>
<p>you to see what that tastes like maybe</p>
<p>send us a snapshot and we&rsquo;ll publish you</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we kick off</p>
<p>with our first quiz question today Dr</p>
<p>Bergen by the way audience all of them</p>
<p>are questions no true falsers so you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get away with the 50 50 coin flip</p>
<p>today you&rsquo;re gonna have to really put</p>
<p>your thinking caps on and here it is</p>
<p>okay which vitamin deficiency is behind</p>
<p>bladder issues like I&rsquo;m talking about a</p>
<p>leaky bladder frequent urination you</p>
<p>know incomplete empty of your urinary</p>
<p>bladder or urgency</p>
<p>what is What vitamin deficiency is</p>
<p>really behind</p>
<p>the majority of those problems</p>
<p>all right very good dig into that</p>
<p>audience</p>
<p>uh and here&rsquo;s another set of Love lover</p>
<p>a letter uh for you Dr Berg Cami from</p>
<p>YouTube thank you for all your</p>
<p>educational videos you have made me more</p>
<p>aware of my health you are amazing thank</p>
<p>you Dr Berg and I Echo that my</p>
<p>intermittent fasting has gotten me out</p>
<p>of the pudgy zone for some time and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>very grateful for that as well Dr Burke</p>
<p>okay you bet Bob from YouTube does</p>
<p>sleeping up to 12 hours a day a part of</p>
<p>a healthy fasting that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>well um I think it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt if you</p>
<p>get more sleep that&rsquo;s for sure I mean</p>
<p>the more um I mean I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if I could do that I mean sleep for</p>
<p>12 hours that would be very difficult to</p>
<p>do but if you could do it occasionally</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably probably help you probably</p>
<p>catch up on all the lack of sleep that</p>
<p>you might be getting</p>
<p>very good uh let&rsquo;s stay on YouTube for a</p>
<p>second this is Osama from YouTube the</p>
<p>skin on my face turned yellow since I</p>
<p>followed healthy keto I take Vitamin D</p>
<p>supplements Trace elements and B</p>
<p>vitamins I have a blood test and the</p>
<p>results were normal what do you think</p>
<p>the cause might be now with Osama I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know you know if he&rsquo;s from an</p>
<p>Asian country or whatever it has white</p>
<p>skin so it&rsquo;s a little difficult right to</p>
<p>determine where he started but he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>yellow skin now</p>
<p>well of course if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>jaundice and your liver&rsquo;s healthy then</p>
<p>it could be something you&rsquo;re eating with</p>
<p>um some pigmentation are you eating a</p>
<p>lot of carrots hopefully you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing a lot of carrot juice</p>
<p>um are you doing a lot of turmeric I</p>
<p>mean all these things potentially could</p>
<p>could make you a bit on the yellow side</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um I I don&rsquo;t know I really don&rsquo;t not</p>
<p>have to get more of a history these I</p>
<p>can only guess</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>all right very good well listen Dr Berg</p>
<p>I know you have a certain fondness for</p>
<p>Canada so I thought it would be</p>
<p>appropriate to start off with our guest</p>
<p>from Ontario and his name is Chris and</p>
<p>Chris if you&rsquo;re unmuted you are on with</p>
<p>Dr Berg</p>
<p>oh there we go</p>
<p>can you hear me we sure can perfectly</p>
<p>oh great good morning Dr Berg good</p>
<p>morning uh just want to start out by</p>
<p>saying uh I&rsquo;m not a long time Watcher</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just discovered you since Christmas</p>
<p>time uh but certainly made a huge</p>
<p>difference when I discovered bile salts</p>
<p>uh about three years ago I had my</p>
<p>gallbladder removed after a long lengthy</p>
<p>process of figuring all of this out and</p>
<p>uh nobody said anything about bile salts</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why I was</p>
<p>feeling so terrible</p>
<p>so uh thank you very much for that and</p>
<p>as well as a lot of the other</p>
<p>bits and pieces that I&rsquo;ve picked up</p>
<p>along the way the turmeric one was a</p>
<p>great one and our local grocery store</p>
<p>actually carries it so the the actual</p>
<p>turmeric as opposed to the the tablet so</p>
<p>I was very pleased to find that uh my</p>
<p>question today I guess is maybe twofold</p>
<p>you kind of answered it with your uh</p>
<p>your video that dropped today I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>having a lot of issues in my stomach</p>
<p>area and they actually cleared up for</p>
<p>quite a quite a while it&rsquo;s only been the</p>
<p>last couple of weeks and I&rsquo;ve started to</p>
<p>feel</p>
<p>um the fullness under my right ribs</p>
<p>again and kind of radiating up to the</p>
<p>shoulder and it sounds like from the</p>
<p>video that came out today it might be</p>
<p>more pancreatic problem</p>
<p>and all the things that you talked about</p>
<p>today are in your bile salts all the</p>
<p>extra things to take so I guess the</p>
<p>first part of the question is should I</p>
<p>take more of those as opposed to just</p>
<p>taking them when I&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>uh and then the second part is somehow</p>
<p>maybe taking the extra vitamins that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started taking since watching you</p>
<p>and over the last month and a half or so</p>
<p>somehow causing a problem should I</p>
<p>should I take them spread out more</p>
<p>during the day should I take them</p>
<p>concentrated I&rsquo;m not quite sure on that</p>
<p>yeah I it</p>
<p>I think that for the first question I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re on the right track yes you</p>
<p>could take um additional gallbladder</p>
<p>formula an empty stomach because that</p>
<p>way you can work on the bile ducts I</p>
<p>mean think about you</p>
<p>um I think you&rsquo;ve mentioned that you</p>
<p>removed the gallbladder so what that</p>
<p>means now is you just don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>concentrated amount of bile you have</p>
<p>bile coming trickling down there but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not in the right amounts or</p>
<p>concentration so you&rsquo;re always going to</p>
<p>have like a little weakness there which</p>
<p>means that you could still have a bit of</p>
<p>sludge within the the tubing the pipes</p>
<p>from your liver to not just</p>
<p>the gallbladder um where the gallbladder</p>
<p>used to be like to the small intestine</p>
<p>but also wraps around to a point where</p>
<p>the pancreas connects and that could be</p>
<p>a little backed up and create a little</p>
<p>pancreatic problem and maybe even a</p>
<p>deficiency of those pancreatic enzymes</p>
<p>so I think that&rsquo;s probably sounds like</p>
<p>the weakness that um you just have to</p>
<p>keep working on and that takes some time</p>
<p>um you might benefit from</p>
<p>definitely betaine hydrochloride because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll actually really help at the</p>
<p>stomach level and maybe some enzymes too</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t jump to too many things</p>
<p>at once I would try one thing at a time</p>
<p>one thing that might be also beneficial</p>
<p>if you have a fatty liver would be to</p>
<p>add some choline to your diet because</p>
<p>that that can act like an additional</p>
<p>support</p>
<p>to keep that liver really you know</p>
<p>cleaned out and so stuff can actually</p>
<p>start coming out and then</p>
<p>also don&rsquo;t forget the the basic eating</p>
<p>plan make sure that um</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re applying some of the the</p>
<p>basic healthy</p>
<p>keto</p>
<p>um that I recommend just that way you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have a nice combination of foods that</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>create problems in the future</p>
<p>um because we want to look at the</p>
<p>original reason why you&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>gallbladder problem in the first place</p>
<p>right and you want we want to correct</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um but if you have that</p>
<p>right sensation underneath your right</p>
<p>gallbladder</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would um</p>
<p>I would suspect there&rsquo;s just more sludge</p>
<p>that needs to be dealt with and yeah so</p>
<p>just add that on an empty stomach and</p>
<p>that should thin more of the bile and</p>
<p>that should</p>
<p>you know you can keep increasing until</p>
<p>that sensation goes away and then you</p>
<p>know okay I need that much for a while</p>
<p>and then as your diet improves that</p>
<p>symptom should go away I used to have</p>
<p>that all the time in fact I think I had</p>
<p>it for 12 years I had no idea</p>
<p>about where it was coming from and uh</p>
<p>thank goodness I I figured it out</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really a</p>
<p>pain underneath your right rib cage</p>
<p>indeed well Hey listen thanks for being</p>
<p>our inaugural visitor on the show Chris</p>
<p>he did a great job and we&rsquo;d love to hear</p>
<p>back from you about all your successes</p>
<p>with your ailing gallbladder okay we</p>
<p>kicked off today with our first question</p>
<p>you you bet you anytime Chris get back</p>
<p>with us all right let&rsquo;s see uh our first</p>
<p>quiz question uh asked</p>
<p>if I push the right button which vitamin</p>
<p>deficiency is behind bladder issues</p>
<p>leaky frequent urination incomplete</p>
<p>emptying of the bladder and other earthy</p>
<p>things and our audience seventy percent</p>
<p>of them said vitamin C 15 say vitamin D</p>
<p>and 15 say vitamin B is in boy</p>
<p>drum roll please Dr Burke how&rsquo;d they do</p>
<p>the answer is thymine B1 deficiency and</p>
<p>let me just explain because there are a</p>
<p>lot of people who have problems with</p>
<p>their bladder and they get up to the</p>
<p>night they have issues with um</p>
<p>urgency and then they they have to go</p>
<p>but not a lot comes out</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s just a lot of issues with the</p>
<p>bladder I did a deep dive into this</p>
<p>subject recently and found some</p>
<p>fascinating information with um that</p>
<p>correlates with what I already knew and</p>
<p>unfortunately when you try to research</p>
<p>this topic you&rsquo;re not going to find it</p>
<p>because the first probably 10 pages on</p>
<p>Google is all the same old same old you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s just trash it&rsquo;s like they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give you it&rsquo;s like a bunch of</p>
<p>companies that hired um SEO people to</p>
<p>just come up with content based on</p>
<p>keywords but there&rsquo;s no real</p>
<p>answers and so you end up going to the</p>
<p>doctor and getting another Med whatever</p>
<p>and then having it cause side effects</p>
<p>but B1</p>
<p>if you look up the relationship between</p>
<p>B1 and all these problems with the</p>
<p>bladder you&rsquo;ll have all this interesting</p>
<p>stuff come up</p>
<p>um that relate to um</p>
<p>the muscle the nerve connection to the</p>
<p>muscle that surrounds the bladder itself</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that connection is is very interesting</p>
<p>because when you don&rsquo;t have enough B1</p>
<p>and that usually comes from consuming</p>
<p>years of carbs and sugars and alcohol</p>
<p>and things like that you can affect that</p>
<p>nerve many different areas even in the</p>
<p>brain the actual Center in the brain</p>
<p>that controls the bladder the holding of</p>
<p>the urine and the releasing of the</p>
<p>bladder is highly sensitive to a B1</p>
<p>deficiency</p>
<p>so what is the solution you start taking</p>
<p>a natural B1 and you also I would take</p>
<p>in addition to that benphotamine which</p>
<p>is that fat soluble B1 that can also</p>
<p>help more on the brain level if there is</p>
<p>a problem in there and restore that and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some great data that shows that</p>
<p>you know even by taking you might have</p>
<p>to take it up to three months but I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ll probably see changes within</p>
<p>you know a week or two and of course</p>
<p>change the diet as well but that&rsquo;s uh if</p>
<p>you have that problem it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>important to know that connection all</p>
<p>right very good well later in the show</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to hear from margar who is a</p>
<p>transplant from Russia so as we talk</p>
<p>about who&rsquo;s watching I&rsquo;m going to go</p>
<p>ahead and credit her with chiming in on</p>
<p>behalf of uh Russia and in addition to</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;d like to say hello to those in</p>
<p>UK Canada Mexico Switzerland Jordan</p>
<p>Sweden Ethiopia Poland Norway Chile Oman</p>
<p>Algeria the Netherlands Japan United</p>
<p>Arab Emirates France Italy Taiwan India</p>
<p>Nepal Argentina Serbia</p>
<p>Iran Belgium Colombia Ireland Greece</p>
<p>Pakistan Bermuda Cuba Scotland artria</p>
<p>Kuwait Yemen Israel the Dominican</p>
<p>Republic turkey New Zealand Australia</p>
<p>Sri Lanka Trinidad and Tobago the Virgin</p>
<p>Islands Malta I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>from them for a while Peru Finland</p>
<p>Jamaica Lithuania Syria Nigeria South</p>
<p>Africa Germany Aruba a great place</p>
<p>Portugal the Philippines Egypt Qatar</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s chechnya anyway sorry</p>
<p>Terry I blew that reading Austria</p>
<p>Croatia Brazil Slovenia Romania and all</p>
<p>across these United States and as usual</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be some frustrated people that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t hear their name and they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to chime in and add to that list so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll wait for that so thanks everybody</p>
<p>for listening and of course all across</p>
<p>these wonderful United States if I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t say that let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media Lucy from YouTube My amylase level</p>
<p>is at 164. the normal is 110 does this</p>
<p>mean I have pancreatitis</p>
<p>yeah right I I can&rsquo;t diagnose that with</p>
<p>just that one value you know here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing when you when you evaluate someone</p>
<p>you really have to um use as much</p>
<p>information as possible get a history uh</p>
<p>potentially it could be one of the</p>
<p>causes but</p>
<p>um you really have to take all the</p>
<p>factors and make sure there&rsquo;s no missing</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>like probably recently Steve I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you&rsquo;ve heard uh in the news it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all over the news that</p>
<p>erythritol has now been found linked to</p>
<p>heart attacks and strokes have you heard</p>
<p>about that no but it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be back to Salt next week or</p>
<p>something if anyone is interested me</p>
<p>talking about that let me know and we</p>
<p>will talk about that but uh</p>
<p>uh you know I&rsquo;m in the keto Community</p>
<p>you know people are saying oh my gosh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wow I&rsquo;ve been eating that for a</p>
<p>while I hope I don&rsquo;t drop dead of a</p>
<p>heart attack well</p>
<p>this is a perfect example of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>of just missing information when you</p>
<p>evaluate and probably on purpose to to</p>
<p>make something</p>
<p>sound really bad but in reality when you</p>
<p>have all all the information it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>but um yeah I really don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>your pancreatitis but um if you have it</p>
<p>or not but um there&rsquo;s many causes and I</p>
<p>think</p>
<p>probably the most common cause with a</p>
<p>problem with your enzymes</p>
<p>especially the pancreas</p>
<p>would be some problem in the the ducks</p>
<p>that are causing pressure or</p>
<p>inflammation or a backup and</p>
<p>what I would do if I were you as a</p>
<p>really inexpensive way to</p>
<p>um potentially solve it is I would start</p>
<p>taking tatka which is that it&rsquo;s a type</p>
<p>of bile salt that will definitely open</p>
<p>up those ducks and if you feel better</p>
<p>within</p>
<p>a couple days then that&rsquo;s then we know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a problem with the sludge this is</p>
<p>this bile sludge is probably</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s just a super common problem</p>
<p>that most people have never even heard</p>
<p>of so</p>
<p>um it can create a lot of nausea and</p>
<p>bloating and um especially problems</p>
<p>related to the gallbladder and the</p>
<p>pancreas so</p>
<p>um I have videos on it and so it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s valuable to know that if if you</p>
<p>have any of those symptoms all right</p>
<p>very good well be forewarned audience</p>
<p>Noah wreath for tall back to two or</p>
<p>three cups of sugar per day with the</p>
<p>food pyramid uh with all the carbs and</p>
<p>so on so you&rsquo;ll feel a lot better once</p>
<p>you get that back underway okay now here</p>
<p>we go with our second question once</p>
<p>again no true false today there it is</p>
<p>Doc</p>
<p>deal</p>
<p>with um the vitamin D side effects like</p>
<p>some people get fatigue insomnia</p>
<p>headache constipation even diarrhea when</p>
<p>they take vitamin D</p>
<p>okay so what&rsquo;s the best way to deal with</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>is it not to take the vitamin D or what</p>
<p>else could you do to solve that problem</p>
<p>okay here we have a very popular</p>
<p>question we hear a lot V from Facebook</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m new to keto how do I eliminate my</p>
<p>craving for sweets</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s the easiest thing in the</p>
<p>world you just basically reduce your</p>
<p>dietary consumption of sweets to get rid</p>
<p>of your craving to sweets you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>rid of it by keeping continuing to eat</p>
<p>sweets so you reduce your sweets and</p>
<p>then your body has no choice but to</p>
<p>start burning your own fat and that</p>
<p>transition takes three days</p>
<p>and if you want to speed it up even more</p>
<p>then you practice intermittent fasting</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t eat as frequent maybe two</p>
<p>meals a day now is it going to be hard</p>
<p>to do initially well</p>
<p>not if you add more fat to the diet</p>
<p>to be more satisfied but within three</p>
<p>days all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve adapted your</p>
<p>Cravings are gone and now you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hungry anymore it&rsquo;s really fascinating</p>
<p>you have to try it to believe it and</p>
<p>once you do it you&rsquo;ll be wow that was</p>
<p>amazing I didn&rsquo;t know that would work</p>
<p>like that but it does and now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>burning fat it&rsquo;s a different fuel source</p>
<p>and uh you&rsquo;re going to feel much much</p>
<p>better V we are all rooting for your go</p>
<p>um girl I assume and get back with us</p>
<p>and let us know about how you don&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>a darn about sweets anymore okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see Denise from Facebook I take pure</p>
<p>therapeutic fermented ketones never</p>
<p>heard of that and now off all meds</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great lost body fat and better</p>
<p>Whole Health all around down 106 pounds</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s the bell for three bell rings</p>
<p>for that why aren&rsquo;t more people not</p>
<p>using this magic so she got over the</p>
<p>sweet uh Cravings it sounds like</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two ways to</p>
<p>um get ketones well there&rsquo;s more more</p>
<p>ways than two but</p>
<p>um you can</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>cut down your carbs</p>
<p>to get your</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your body to make more ketones and then</p>
<p>you can actually also not eat and then</p>
<p>your body will actually turn your own</p>
<p>fat into Ketone so it has the ability to</p>
<p>to change your dietary fat into ketones</p>
<p>as well as your own body fat into</p>
<p>ketones and</p>
<p>and basically just need to do two things</p>
<p>is cut down carbs and don&rsquo;t eat so so</p>
<p>often and cut out those snacks Steve is</p>
<p>anyone uh as you see on social media is</p>
<p>anyone interested in knowing more about</p>
<p>this uh erythritol uh heart con problem</p>
<p>connection or are they not really</p>
<p>commenting about it well that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>question for Terry because he</p>
<p>wonderfully sort of uh you know gauges</p>
<p>which message is to send me so Terry</p>
<p>word out to you any uh action on</p>
<p>erythritol and also uh Alec he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching on there for various things on</p>
<p>social media so Alec if you see anything</p>
<p>that has to do with the wreath for tall</p>
<p>questions please let your local producer</p>
<p>know and we&rsquo;ll get that back to Dr Berg</p>
<p>so pressures on Alec and Terry for that</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s an interesting question I</p>
<p>mean I you know I use it but you know</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;m 69 dog and everything was</p>
<p>going to kill me</p>
<p>every five years for the last 69 years</p>
<p>salt no salt you know this that so I</p>
<p>guess I&rsquo;ve won but erythritol hasn&rsquo;t put</p>
<p>me down yet so I&rsquo;m going to call that</p>
<p>Victory now as promised there are some</p>
<p>people that feel uh very dejected</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t mention their name but</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t mention their name on and</p>
<p>here they are here are the people that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to mention Ghana India South</p>
<p>Korea Albania uh Jamaica Somalia Saudi</p>
<p>Arabia and Spain welcome on board</p>
<p>everyone I can&rsquo;t imagine there&rsquo;s many uh</p>
<p>countries around the world that are left</p>
<p>off the list today so let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>oh</p>
<p>um here we go uh Terry&rsquo;s just chimed in</p>
<p>our audience overwhelmingly wants Dr</p>
<p>bark to discuss in depth the results of</p>
<p>the erythritol study with four</p>
<p>exclamation marks so yes that is a topic</p>
<p>of Interest doc</p>
<p>let me just touch on it real fast I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna you&rsquo;ll see a whole video on it but</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need to spend a lot of time on</p>
<p>it but here&rsquo;s the thing this study is</p>
<p>all over the news it&rsquo;s in social media</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so if you actually read the study</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s not even a study about the</p>
<p>dietary erythritol okay it&rsquo;s not even it</p>
<p>was not it&rsquo;s not about a person</p>
<p>consuming erythritol at all that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting it&rsquo;s about your body making</p>
<p>its own erythritol so the people that</p>
<p>had the most erythritol from</p>
<p>endogenous which means your body makes</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>um uh was had a head Association to a</p>
<p>heart problem right</p>
<p>okay so what there&rsquo;s some some missing</p>
<p>data there&rsquo;s a missing piece of the</p>
<p>puzzle here that people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your body makes erythritol as a</p>
<p>byproduct of uh glucose metabolism</p>
<p>so the people that have the most</p>
<p>erythritol in their blood are the people</p>
<p>who are consuming the most sugar like</p>
<p>diabetics people eating fructose a lot</p>
<p>of fruit</p>
<p>as well as</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it increases when you have</p>
<p>oxidative stress as in kidney disease</p>
<p>liver disease</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so and even belly fat so you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have a lot of erythritol and the</p>
<p>majority of people in this study</p>
<p>were not healthy they&rsquo;re diabetics they</p>
<p>are at high blood pressure they had a</p>
<p>lot of pro they&rsquo;re overweight they had a</p>
<p>lot of problems</p>
<p>so obviously they&rsquo;re going to have high</p>
<p>levels of erythritol and the question is</p>
<p>this is the big question</p>
<p>um is it really the erythritol that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing the problem</p>
<p>or is it</p>
<p>the health problems you have that is</p>
<p>causing the heart problem that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s answered with the next next</p>
<p>piece of the puzzle which is fascinating</p>
<p>if you continue to research erythritol</p>
<p>and in animal studies uh you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>that it acts as an antioxidant it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory it actually improves</p>
<p>insulin sensitivity it lowers glucose it</p>
<p>can help slow down the weight gain in</p>
<p>certain studies it it improves insulin</p>
<p>resist actually it makes insulin</p>
<p>resistance less resistant</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s really probably happening when</p>
<p>you have a higher level of erythritol is</p>
<p>your body is probably using that</p>
<p>erythritol to counter the bad effects</p>
<p>from the sugar</p>
<p>so they kind of made this study and they</p>
<p>had four different sections and they</p>
<p>made these</p>
<p>uh these assumptions which is totally</p>
<p>based on</p>
<p>you know garbage information and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all observational well most of it was</p>
<p>observational but stay tuned for a more</p>
<p>in-depth review on that but um</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to worry about consuming</p>
<p>erythritol at all</p>
<p>um like they say or you&rsquo;ll see on</p>
<p>all these news like it&rsquo;s just right off</p>
<p>the bat you know they grab this</p>
<p>this piece and they just want to learn</p>
<p>people it&rsquo;s another another one of those</p>
<p>studies that um they haven&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>evaluated they&rsquo;re just jumping to</p>
<p>conclusions and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just garbage</p>
<p>well it certainly is and they make it</p>
<p>click based so they obviously leave all</p>
<p>the stuff out just a couple of Juicy</p>
<p>comments and you think once again I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be dead tomorrow and here we all are</p>
<p>alive and well okay so uh quiz question</p>
<p>number two again much of the audience</p>
<p>angst is not true false they had to do</p>
<p>some real research and it asked the best</p>
<p>way to deal with vitamin D side effects</p>
<p>which are fatigue insomnia headache and</p>
<p>constipation is uh and eighty percent of</p>
<p>them say is to take K2 10 say to add</p>
<p>more natural sunlight and ten percent</p>
<p>say add more magnesium or Fiber well doc</p>
<p>okay so the answer is magnesium now</p>
<p>these are all symptoms of magnesium</p>
<p>deficiency so if you are um taking</p>
<p>vitamin D</p>
<p>um it doesn&rsquo;t really work if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in in magnesium yes you need</p>
<p>K2 and you need zinc and you need B6 but</p>
<p>magnesium is a really important one</p>
<p>um to take with D3</p>
<p>and so um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re again if you&rsquo;re deficient in</p>
<p>vitamin in magnesium and you take a lot</p>
<p>of D3 you could end up with some side</p>
<p>effects so when I sometimes when I hear</p>
<p>this like oh yeah vitamin D is bad</p>
<p>because I had a I got a headache or I</p>
<p>got constipation all that means is you</p>
<p>sh it&rsquo;s a great indication that you</p>
<p>probably need more magnesium and all of</p>
<p>a sudden the side effects go away same</p>
<p>thing with insomnia</p>
<p>um now there is another uh very rare</p>
<p>side effect of hypercalcemia which but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d have to take</p>
<p>so much vitamin D like hundreds of</p>
<p>thousands over months to um</p>
<p>um to end up with a problem with a</p>
<p>kidney stone</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s very rare and um but</p>
<p>magnesium deficiency symptoms are more</p>
<p>common so where do you get magnesium</p>
<p>leafy greens okay so as long as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>following kind of what I&rsquo;m recommending</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to have a magnesium</p>
<p>deficiency because you have that salad</p>
<p>each day it&rsquo;ll give you plenty of</p>
<p>magnesium magnesium associated with the</p>
<p>chlorophyll it&rsquo;s like the heart of the</p>
<p>chlorophyll molecule that&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>green stuff so um</p>
<p>I just want to point that out you know</p>
<p>just so you have that connection okay</p>
<p>very good asking for a friend how much</p>
<p>magnesium is in a large pepperoni pizza</p>
<p>uh probably not a lot unless you uh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>made out of uh your salad which is</p>
<p>probably not all right very good okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see now uh let&rsquo;s move on let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to our room and I spoke of a nice</p>
<p>young lady that was originally from</p>
<p>Russia but she&rsquo;s now my neighbor in</p>
<p>Goldsboro North Carolina and if she is</p>
<p>unmuted herself then we&rsquo;re going to hear</p>
<p>all from her here she is Margot</p>
<p>currently from North Carolina you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only here with Dr bird</p>
<p>hello good morning good morning oh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>originally from Russia and uh in the</p>
<p>early age I found out</p>
<p>through the medical expertise of Russian</p>
<p>doctors I was</p>
<p>um producing a very little of stomach</p>
<p>acid which is barbaric way how they do</p>
<p>it and they diagnose me with the</p>
<p>deficiency of all the vitamins fast</p>
<p>forward come to wonderful dive United</p>
<p>States I ended up to have a weird</p>
<p>sensation in my legs and my knees and</p>
<p>every muscle was jerking fast forward</p>
<p>more I ended up with two C diffs which</p>
<p>has survived and in the process I was</p>
<p>trying to prove my doctor I am low in</p>
<p>stomach acid and I cannot take</p>
<p>um suppressant for the acid it was just</p>
<p>was a battle for a year and now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to figure out what that low</p>
<p>stomach acid which is in Russia they</p>
<p>told me I&rsquo;m genetically pre-exposed or</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a genetic in me uh because</p>
<p>production was there but it&rsquo;s very small</p>
<p>amount they actually suck it out that I</p>
<p>mean I&rsquo;m sorry and now my OB GYN saying</p>
<p>my iron is very low in saturation in my</p>
<p>blood is very low and she prescribed me</p>
<p>a supplement but I know already</p>
<p>supplements will only absorb if I have</p>
<p>enough acid so Nutri Cycles you do one</p>
<p>thing and they tell you to do another</p>
<p>thing and then you try to figure out</p>
<p>what is actually right for me so I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have to make it my own way I took</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>change my diet I am now on fasting stay</p>
<p>with my husband which is he lost 62</p>
<p>pounds</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s in a ketogenic that we eat</p>
<p>salad and I break my fast with caviar an</p>
<p>empty stomach with the bromelin to kind</p>
<p>of speed out of digestion and</p>
<p>sometimes I eat some nuts like walnuts</p>
<p>and salmon so I&rsquo;m trying to see what</p>
<p>else can I put there to bring my B</p>
<p>vitamin up bring my acid up and</p>
<p>absorption of iron</p>
<p>so did you say that you can&rsquo;t consume</p>
<p>betaine hydrochloride</p>
<p>I actually do I actually take it with my</p>
<p>meal yeah okay yeah</p>
<p>um I think you probably just need a lot</p>
<p>more than the average person and that</p>
<p>probably will help you</p>
<p>um also sea salt at least the chlorides</p>
<p>in the sea salt will help build up the</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid but betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride is definitely something</p>
<p>you should have before a meal now</p>
<p>um if you don&rsquo;t have enough acid you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>more susceptible to anemia because you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t absorb some of the minerals</p>
<p>especially like iron and things like</p>
<p>that so if you wanted to</p>
<p>um solve the iron thing I think the best</p>
<p>thing would be to have a little bit of</p>
<p>liver in your diet maybe every other day</p>
<p>that would really be the best thing for</p>
<p>your B vitamins it&rsquo;s a super</p>
<p>concentrated amount of B vitamins you</p>
<p>can also do the nutritional yeast and</p>
<p>fortified but I know the problem that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running into because without that</p>
<p>acid</p>
<p>um boy it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>you can end up with um</p>
<p>you know small intestinal bacterial</p>
<p>overgrowth</p>
<p>um an inability to absorb B12 but if you</p>
<p>take the liver you&rsquo;ll get B12 and iron</p>
<p>you can fill two birds with one stone</p>
<p>and um see what happens is when you eat</p>
<p>liver or red meat um and ask you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to break it down so you can</p>
<p>extract those nutrients well your body</p>
<p>has a hard time doing that so you just</p>
<p>might need to have a little bit more</p>
<p>liver and then more acid so you can</p>
<p>break it down</p>
<p>um but it sounds like you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>right track</p>
<p>um you just want to focus on eating</p>
<p>nutrient dense foods right like liver</p>
<p>Fish seafood all that will is very high</p>
<p>especially self shellfish is very high</p>
<p>in the nutrition that you need to help</p>
<p>bypass this issue you have with the</p>
<p>stomach</p>
<p>um if you do take um</p>
<p>it might be helpful also to get a DNA</p>
<p>test to see if there&rsquo;s any problem with</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called methylation in which case</p>
<p>you might be better</p>
<p>benefiting from taking like a</p>
<p>methylcobolamine or methylfolate</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>to really kind of go deeper so</p>
<p>so that would be my advice</p>
<p>thank you so much because they actually</p>
<p>laugh at me saying I&rsquo;m Elsa because my</p>
<p>fingers and my toes is ice cold even</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s 100 degrees outside</p>
<p>wow that could probably solve your</p>
<p>problem because that&rsquo;s a yeah you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>more blood flow I bet you anything if</p>
<p>you did a</p>
<p>I did a DNA test it would show up um</p>
<p>like you have a problem methylating and</p>
<p>and again it&rsquo;s a simple solution you</p>
<p>take you take a supplement with</p>
<p>methylcobolamine methyl folate with B6</p>
<p>and some of the other cult factors and</p>
<p>uh I think</p>
<p>that could really help you in a big way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well Margo thank you so</p>
<p>much for um did you have another</p>
<p>question go ahead</p>
<p>I always wanted to say I do uh take your</p>
<p>yeast B vitamin and uh my husband has</p>
<p>taken it with me so we felt much big</p>
<p>improvements right away because I</p>
<p>actually take a bigger dose than it was</p>
<p>recommended just because I know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>deficient in it and it was uh</p>
<p>dramatic change for sure well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting because</p>
<p>um that has in there the folate and it</p>
<p>has the methyl methyl B12 too so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably why you feel better and I it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good that you didn&rsquo;t take another</p>
<p>version that&rsquo;s fortified because you</p>
<p>probably would feel worse if you had</p>
<p>this synthetic or the uh the folic acid</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want that you want the folate</p>
<p>and I just did a video on that but um</p>
<p>yeah that that&rsquo;s good that you stumbled</p>
<p>on that that&rsquo;s great thank you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrific well I tell you what uh Margo I</p>
<p>would rather lapse into coma than eat</p>
<p>beef liver or any kind of liver but you</p>
<p>have a stronger Constitution to me I can</p>
<p>tell that just by looking at you so go</p>
<p>ahead and eat some liver and get back</p>
<p>with us and let us know how well that</p>
<p>worked out for you why don&rsquo;t we go on to</p>
<p>the next question Dr Berg and here it is</p>
<p>all right so what is the primary</p>
<p>indicator of a fatty liver so</p>
<p>what would be the</p>
<p>the first obvious sign that you have a</p>
<p>fatty liver without doing a blood test</p>
<p>or anything like that what&rsquo;s what what</p>
<p>would be the the best</p>
<p>indicator for that</p>
<p>very good by the way back to that uh</p>
<p>question we answered before a lot of</p>
<p>people said K2 what can you remind us</p>
<p>again of how K2 interacts with vitamin D</p>
<p>and what what the relationship is</p>
<p>vitamin K2 is the partner of vitamin D3</p>
<p>vitamin D3 helps increase the calcium</p>
<p>absorption by 20 times in the small</p>
<p>intestine and so you end up with higher</p>
<p>amounts of calcium in the blood but then</p>
<p>vitamin K2 directs that calcium where to</p>
<p>go to push it in the bones and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in K2 where a lot of people</p>
<p>are deficient then the calcium can build</p>
<p>up in the arteries and inside the walls</p>
<p>of the arteries</p>
<p>causing stiffness of the arteries and</p>
<p>high blood pressure so this is why when</p>
<p>people take K2 with D3 a lot of times</p>
<p>their blood pressure is better</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many other things that K2 does</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>and one of the problems people get</p>
<p>confused between K1 and K2 if they&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>Warfarin which is a blood thinner to</p>
<p>prevent clots they don&rsquo;t realize that um</p>
<p>that blocks</p>
<p>um K1 but it also blocks the enzyme that</p>
<p>K2 acts on</p>
<p>so this is why one of the side effects</p>
<p>from Warfarin is</p>
<p>vascular calcification</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re taking more a lot</p>
<p>of calcium and so</p>
<p>I mean here</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re trying to thin the blood</p>
<p>and prevent a heart attack by avoiding</p>
<p>this the clotting but then you end up</p>
<p>with a calcium problem so</p>
<p>um you know you really if if someone is</p>
<p>on Warfarin I would definitely check</p>
<p>with the doc to see if there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>type of medication that is</p>
<p>that won&rsquo;t won&rsquo;t involved the K vitamins</p>
<p>okay so that&rsquo;s just a tip</p>
<p>okay very good let&rsquo;s go back to the</p>
<p>Green Room we&rsquo;re going to go through</p>
<p>these and we have a Ken and he&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>from North Carolina and Ken if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>unmuted yourself you&rsquo;re on with Dr Burke</p>
<p>up I see a mute box okay can you hear me</p>
<p>perfectly</p>
<p>excellent the question I have is a year</p>
<p>ago I did a calcium scan and my number</p>
<p>was 138 and recently I did a second</p>
<p>calcium scan my number was 173.</p>
<p>which surprised me</p>
<p>for a couple of years I&rsquo;ve been taking</p>
<p>30 000 uh international units of vitamin</p>
<p>D daily</p>
<p>and certainly for at least a year I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been taking about 300 milligrams of K2</p>
<p>daily</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>the question is</p>
<p>uh I guess the bottom line is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>causing my increase in calcium plaque if</p>
<p>you have any speculation but the other</p>
<p>question is is am I taking too much</p>
<p>vitamin D3</p>
<p>um or something else I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m doing real</p>
<p>good with uh keto not completely as good</p>
<p>as you</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m uh I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m getting close to a</p>
<p>really good keto uh</p>
<p>diet and regimen okay yeah there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple things I would mention about that</p>
<p>realize that um that score is not</p>
<p>terrible I mean like if it was a</p>
<p>thousand I would be concerned but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just talking it&rsquo;s under 200 so I mean</p>
<p>this is a</p>
<p>somewhat a mild issue but still I</p>
<p>understand we want it going down the</p>
<p>opposite direction so that being said</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you taken the K2 I would check</p>
<p>I would check two things I would check</p>
<p>your blood to see what your blood levels</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>um and then I would also get a DNA test</p>
<p>and I would look at any genetic weakness</p>
<p>that you have that could relate to this</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then that might actually tell you a</p>
<p>lot</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s kind of like one of those uh</p>
<p>predictive</p>
<p>information especially what relates to</p>
<p>heart</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s several different angles</p>
<p>with that the other reason for calcium</p>
<p>buildup is um</p>
<p>the parathyroid gland</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s another thing on my radar</p>
<p>the parathyroid gland but but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing with the parathyroid</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re low in vitamin D3 your</p>
<p>parathyroid then kind of can go into the</p>
<p>bone and start taking calcium from that</p>
<p>and building up in the arteries but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s your situation but</p>
<p>there also could be you know a problem</p>
<p>with the parathyroid that can be</p>
<p>producing too much calcium that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>factor you also have biofilms</p>
<p>which is another thing that microbes</p>
<p>that actually can hold calcium in the</p>
<p>arteries the other factor is</p>
<p>tocotrenals the vitamin E I know that is</p>
<p>a really important thing for vascular</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>inflammation that can then lead to this</p>
<p>calcium calcium issue</p>
<p>um so we have I take a Toca train leaves</p>
<p>every morning okay good</p>
<p>good and then the other thing that you</p>
<p>may benefit from is maybe a key later</p>
<p>a key later</p>
<p>um you can like cilantro there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>various uh EDTA there&rsquo;s a chelator and</p>
<p>you could you can even start to do a</p>
<p>little</p>
<p>um distilled water</p>
<p>and um and then take the minerals</p>
<p>take all the other minerals except</p>
<p>calcium and to help balance this out</p>
<p>um but I would first get a test I I</p>
<p>highly it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that this</p>
<p>problem is coming from the Vitamin D it</p>
<p>you know I would I would like to just do</p>
<p>I would just look at your diet really</p>
<p>just to make sure that there could be</p>
<p>something else contributing to this that</p>
<p>you just you might need to just be a</p>
<p>little bit more script strict</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so I mean that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s probably not the</p>
<p>complete answer but I think that&rsquo;s as</p>
<p>much as I can give you right now based</p>
<p>on what I the data I have but I would</p>
<p>definitely get a DNA test because that</p>
<p>can actually</p>
<p>show you some hidden things that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not even aware of</p>
<p>all right well Ken thanks so much for</p>
<p>coming on with us we&rsquo;re fighting the</p>
<p>clock a little bit so we&rsquo;ve got to move</p>
<p>on and uh we but we always as always</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d love to hear back from you and find</p>
<p>out the great progress okay uh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got some answers for the third</p>
<p>question which asks what is the primary</p>
<p>indicator of a fatty liver</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see Terry claims that ninety</p>
<p>percent of our respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>belly fat five percent say puffy or</p>
<p>yellow eyes and five percent say insulin</p>
<p>resistance who won well the majority is</p>
<p>correct yeah down look down</p>
<p>uh at your shoes right now if you see</p>
<p>something you can&rsquo;t see your shoes if</p>
<p>you have any protrusion whatsoever in</p>
<p>your belly</p>
<p>um that is the best indication that we</p>
<p>now deliver</p>
<p>is fatty now what&rsquo;s interesting about</p>
<p>when you when you have a fat cell and</p>
<p>you eat poorly over time the fat cell</p>
<p>starts to expand right well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a point where the fat cell</p>
<p>has a limitation it cannot keep</p>
<p>expanding and what happens then is you</p>
<p>start to get a problem with the fat cell</p>
<p>it loses</p>
<p>um blood supply you start having</p>
<p>um dysfunctional fat cells I mean people</p>
<p>are just so against fat they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize it&rsquo;s actually a living cell it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>helping you and then when that that cell</p>
<p>becomes damaged that&rsquo;s when you start to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>have insulin resistance okay and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when the fat cell can no longer be</p>
<p>stored inside that cell it goes gets</p>
<p>stored outside the cell that&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>ectopic and I&rsquo;m talking about like</p>
<p>amongst your muscle cells around your</p>
<p>organs around the liver and it starts to</p>
<p>build up in the liver it&rsquo;s no longer in</p>
<p>the fat cell it&rsquo;s outside the fat cell</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s around your liver and then now that</p>
<p>insulin resistance starts picking up the</p>
<p>pace and you it gets worse and worse and</p>
<p>worse and thank goodness you have some</p>
<p>extra space as a backup space</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like the extra luggage</p>
<p>around around the cavity in your</p>
<p>midsection so you can hold Steve roughly</p>
<p>between</p>
<p>four</p>
<p>eight or more liters of extra ectopic</p>
<p>fat in your belly and your belly can</p>
<p>keep expanding more and more and more to</p>
<p>a certain point until it explodes so</p>
<p>um that that basically is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening it just tells us that liver</p>
<p>liver fat there is no way you can have</p>
<p>belly fat and</p>
<p>like a clean liver without fat there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible so belly fat indicates</p>
<p>liver fat and even if someone doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have belly fat they could still have</p>
<p>liver fat too you just need to get an</p>
<p>ultrasound scan the liver and see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on inside there okay very good</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;re running against the clock a</p>
<p>little bit so uh audience you are always</p>
<p>so fast here&rsquo;s question number four Doc</p>
<p>and we hope they get us answers back so</p>
<p>quickly</p>
<p>what is the best remedy for heal a bone</p>
<p>spurs</p>
<p>and also ostephites those little uh</p>
<p>Spurs that you see in the joints and and</p>
<p>these calcium deposits what would be the</p>
<p>best remedy for that</p>
<p>okay very good we&rsquo;ve got a couple more</p>
<p>in the green room so Gemma because of</p>
<p>our time I&rsquo;m going to ask you to give us</p>
<p>one question and belt it out in 30</p>
<p>seconds go</p>
<p>hi Dr Berg I&rsquo;m managing uh Hydra then</p>
<p>Titus super ativa HS and I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>taking metformin and Spyro lock tone</p>
<p>daily I&rsquo;ve been doing the clean keto for</p>
<p>six months along with intermittent</p>
<p>fasting I feel absolutely great I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lost weight and I just got all my blood</p>
<p>results and they&rsquo;re phenomenal my</p>
<p>question is how do you suggest your</p>
<p>thoughts on dealing with this skin issue</p>
<p>and also I&rsquo;m supposed to start taking</p>
<p>umira next Friday</p>
<p>well I don&rsquo;t even know what that</p>
<p>condition is can you just tell me</p>
<p>briefly what that condition is I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never even heard of it before</p>
<p>yes I it&rsquo;s a condition it&rsquo;s a skin</p>
<p>condition which has to do with the</p>
<p>follicle area evidently there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>protein that I make too much of tnf</p>
<p>alpha</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay well</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what I would do if I were you and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the right track</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re actually on keto and so you</p>
<p>reduce this indic what she just</p>
<p>mentioned there&rsquo;s an inflammatory Factor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in the it&rsquo;s an immune</p>
<p>inflammatory factor that um</p>
<p>that needs to be reduced and so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the keto so that&rsquo;s helping you see</p>
<p>metformin also believe it or not</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it targets insulin resistance and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why it works for so many things of</p>
<p>course there&rsquo;s a big side effect of B12</p>
<p>deficiency</p>
<p>lactic acidosis potentially and so you</p>
<p>need B1 and so just for the fact here I</p>
<p>met for me you need B1 and b12 so start</p>
<p>taking those right off the bat</p>
<p>um but I would if I were you not just do</p>
<p>keto I would do I would put emphasis on</p>
<p>making sure there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>omega-6 uh fats in your diet like this</p>
<p>soy oil the corn oil the canola the</p>
<p>cotton seed I would really eliminate</p>
<p>those and I would beef up no pun</p>
<p>intended cod liver oil</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would do if I were you and</p>
<p>I would also add one more thing and that</p>
<p>would be vitamin D3 uh about 10 000 IUS</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then I would really evaluate after</p>
<p>about two or three months to see how you</p>
<p>do I think that&rsquo;s probably the best</p>
<p>thing for you but um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing better why are they</p>
<p>going to add another medication I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know I have no I don&rsquo;t have the details</p>
<p>on that but</p>
<p>um the goal would be to maybe go less</p>
<p>medications over time</p>
<p>because the keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting will decrease the need for</p>
<p>medication especially if it&rsquo;s related to</p>
<p>blood sugars or insulin resistance</p>
<p>well Gemma we&rsquo;re about out of time here</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry we can&rsquo;t answer but we would</p>
<p>love to hear back from you as you get</p>
<p>some more uh progress in this issue and</p>
<p>thank you so much for getting back with</p>
<p>us and let&rsquo;s see so now uh we are going</p>
<p>to hit social media because we should</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Debbie from Facebook how can I</p>
<p>rate how can I raise my blood pressure</p>
<p>mine has dropped since taking blood</p>
<p>pressure meds that make me dizzy what</p>
<p>should I do seems like an obvious answer</p>
<p>this is a classic classic if you take</p>
<p>medications and it lowers it is too low</p>
<p>then you need to get with your doctor to</p>
<p>take less of that medication because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s working too hard that would be the</p>
<p>thing you need to do I mean you can add</p>
<p>more salt and more water to get more</p>
<p>volume to get more pressure but</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s not a bad idea but I</p>
<p>would first try to get with your doctor</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>um especially if a lot of times when you</p>
<p>do keto the need for medication goes</p>
<p>down and and all of a sudden you end up</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>um low blood pressure or even low blood</p>
<p>sugar and you&rsquo;re like well then take</p>
<p>less medication because you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to take</p>
<p>blood</p>
<p>glucose lowering medication if you have</p>
<p>low blood glucose</p>
<p>makes sense okay audience is on it thank</p>
<p>you all so much uh question four what is</p>
<p>the best remedy for bone spurs and a lot</p>
<p>of opinions out there 55 percent say K2</p>
<p>or magnesium 20 say lemon water 20 say</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar and remaining five</p>
<p>are holding out for collagen uh do we</p>
<p>have any winter stock</p>
<p>all those answers are true there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something a little stronger for bone</p>
<p>spurs um that would be phosphorus</p>
<p>phosphorus</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re deficient in phosphorus you</p>
<p>can you have a tendency to get these</p>
<p>deposits and when I was in practice we</p>
<p>used a standard process product called</p>
<p>phosphood liquid works good on bone</p>
<p>spurs so you might want to get that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not affiliated with the company I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get any Kickbacks so you can just look</p>
<p>it up stay in a processed fast food</p>
<p>liquid take that works pretty good so um</p>
<p>just just a little</p>
<p>tip on</p>
<p>a good remedy if you have that problem</p>
<p>okay very good that&rsquo;s great by the way</p>
<p>sorry we see you there and we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to get right to you but we want to</p>
<p>launch out our last question and here it</p>
<p>is Doc</p>
<p>all right what is the most potent way to</p>
<p>increase the number of mitochondria in</p>
<p>your body</p>
<p>okay folks grab onto that and sorry</p>
<p>thanks for being so patient with us and</p>
<p>Syria&rsquo;s last but certainly not least and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s from the great borough of Brooklyn</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>Dr Berg</p>
<p>thanks for taking my question</p>
<p>I have a question in regards to styes I</p>
<p>often develop them on my eyelids</p>
<p>um I know what to do like when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>there but I&rsquo;m curious how what I could</p>
<p>do to prevent it or like why they even</p>
<p>come in the first place</p>
<p>is there a nutrient I&rsquo;m missing or some</p>
<p>vitamin yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s usually viral</p>
<p>related and it just it&rsquo;s kind of like a</p>
<p>little red light that means that you</p>
<p>need either more zinc</p>
<p>or you need more vitamin A those two and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>um just from working with a lot of</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s thighs I I&rsquo;ve um they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>usually always deficient vitamin A</p>
<p>but where do you get vitamin A well egg</p>
<p>yolks butter liver things like that but</p>
<p>it could also be that um</p>
<p>the gallbladder is not quite producing</p>
<p>enough bile so I always kind of look at</p>
<p>that so Cod Liver for example is a</p>
<p>really good remedy for a vitamin A and D</p>
<p>and omega-3 so that might be the best</p>
<p>remedy for you</p>
<p>um and then take a little zinc and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll that&rsquo;ll help you the other</p>
<p>um reason that you might be deficient in</p>
<p>zinc is that when stress goes up people</p>
<p>tend to deplete their zinc reserves or</p>
<p>if they eat sugar and things like that</p>
<p>so you can end up with a a little stye a</p>
<p>viral thing kind of coming out of</p>
<p>remission like what what&rsquo;s going on I</p>
<p>came back with my eyelid there so um</p>
<p>stress is another Factor uh I&rsquo;m assuming</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re probably not coming 10 foot</p>
<p>near Sugar so we can rule that out but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would look at the stress point and the</p>
<p>cod liver oil and uh and zinc and that</p>
<p>usually should handle it</p>
<p>um so that that would be my advice</p>
<p>thank you so much that&rsquo;s great thanks so</p>
<p>much Sherry thanks for hanging in there</p>
<p>and being our last contestant if you</p>
<p>will and uh thank you enjoy the spring</p>
<p>up there in New York okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna wait for our answer for our</p>
<p>final question however let&rsquo;s get back</p>
<p>and pay homage to social media uh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see Daniel from Facebook should men</p>
<p>avoid flaxseed oil because of the</p>
<p>estrogen content</p>
<p>for the most part I would say yes unless</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s some other indications it</p>
<p>does you know there are other benefits</p>
<p>to flax oil but a flaxseed but typically</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend men having much of it</p>
<p>because it can potentially have an</p>
<p>estrogenic effect not potently but it</p>
<p>can and most people do have a problem</p>
<p>with too much estrogen because of all</p>
<p>the things that mimic estrogen in the</p>
<p>environment but there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who have also a problem with deficiency</p>
<p>mainly women with estrogen and that</p>
<p>could be</p>
<p>um especially right after pregnancy</p>
<p>especially menopausal so um I think I</p>
<p>would not recommend that for men</p>
<p>okay very good and the audience is</p>
<p>always on it the final question the data</p>
<p>is in what is the most potent way to</p>
<p>increase the number of mitochondria in</p>
<p>your body and are a team of experts 40</p>
<p>percent of them say fermented foods 35</p>
<p>of our respondents say fasting 15 say</p>
<p>exercise and 10 percent say MCT oil</p>
<p>okay the most potent way is to exercise</p>
<p>and the exercise that creates the the</p>
<p>most numbers of mitochondria is the</p>
<p>intensity of that exercise so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing some intense exercise you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>forcing the body to adapt and make a lot</p>
<p>more mitochondria now what is that going</p>
<p>to do that&rsquo;s going to actually give you</p>
<p>more capacity for energy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to walk around and go wow I</p>
<p>just have a lot more energy I feel</p>
<p>better and um so if you have an energy</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>um if you exercise exercise to it</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;ll all of a sudden solve that</p>
<p>problem usually but there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>reasons why you might be tired but yeah</p>
<p>exercise and you know of course fasting</p>
<p>will also do it but exercise is the most</p>
<p>potent way to increase more mitochondria</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s great and one of the</p>
<p>reasons our audience may be so smart is</p>
<p>because they were bright enough to</p>
<p>download your great app so they can have</p>
<p>these answers at their fingertips and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s available on iOS and also on</p>
<p>Android so I know many of you rely on</p>
<p>that as sort of a cheat sheet but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not cheating for goodness sakes learn</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s good for you right there on the</p>
<p>app and drberg.com so why don&rsquo;t we have</p>
<p>a marathon of</p>
<p>um social media to wrap things up uh</p>
<p>Chris from Facebook Dr Berg I am taking</p>
<p>niacin with uh flush my to flush my</p>
<p>cholesterol but it&rsquo;s not extended</p>
<p>release do I need to take extended</p>
<p>release in order for it to be effective</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>no no now the one that really works on</p>
<p>cholesterol doesn&rsquo;t have to be extended</p>
<p>release but you want to make sure you</p>
<p>get the one that flushes not don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the the non-flush</p>
<p>which is a nice set of mine you want to</p>
<p>you want to get niacin</p>
<p>um it doesn&rsquo;t have to be extended</p>
<p>release and it&rsquo;ll work nicely it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very I mean it&rsquo;s so researched on on</p>
<p>lowering cholesterol and and other</p>
<p>lipids other you know problems with lipo</p>
<p>proteins it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>which by the way cholesterol is not</p>
<p>lipoproteins but um the point is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good remedy for everything</p>
<p>related to LDL and improving your HDL I</p>
<p>mean</p>
<p>amazing research on what it can do to</p>
<p>the inside of the arteries so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good natural way I&rsquo;m surprised</p>
<p>they even</p>
<p>allowed that research because it</p>
<p>competes with drugs but um of course</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see some</p>
<p>some people saying oh yeah it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>create liver problems but it&rsquo;s so rare</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so rare and you&rsquo;d have to have</p>
<p>massive amounts of it all right very</p>
<p>good Renee from YouTube appears to be</p>
<p>very disciplined but she&rsquo;s wants to know</p>
<p>if she has a teaspoon of olive oil with</p>
<p>minced garlic and a pinch of cayenne</p>
<p>pepper mixed with water will it break</p>
<p>her fast</p>
<p>not by too much I would not buy too much</p>
<p>because fats the only thing that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to um</p>
<p>activate insulin and insulin is the key</p>
<p>factor now the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consuming a fat</p>
<p>may cause a temporary shift of your body</p>
<p>using that as a fuel source and not your</p>
<p>own fat so but that&rsquo;s different than</p>
<p>breaking a fast it&rsquo;s more like</p>
<p>inhibiting your ability to lose weight</p>
<p>um but it&rsquo;s a minor thing and I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a bad thing to do</p>
<p>for many people especially if you want</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>add some additional nutrients</p>
<p>okay very good well um you know do you</p>
<p>have any final words for the TGIF crowd</p>
<p>around the world we&rsquo;re running out of</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>if there is any additional uh topics or</p>
<p>videos you want me to to do a video on</p>
<p>please write them in the comments I read</p>
<p>a lot of your comments I don&rsquo;t always</p>
<p>respond to them but I read them and I</p>
<p>really appreciate all the wonderful</p>
<p>comments last week as well as on this</p>
<p>show right here thanks for being here</p>
<p>this long I will see you next week same</p>
<p>time as well as every single day I</p>
<p>release a video so stay tuned for some</p>
<p>more information that I think you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
