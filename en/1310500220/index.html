    <p>The following is a conversation with Vincent Recaniello,</p>
<p>professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia.</p>
<p>Vincent is one of the best educators in biology</p>
<p>and in general that I&rsquo;ve ever had</p>
<p>the pleasure of speaking with.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you check out</p>
<p>his This Week in Virology podcast</p>
<p>and watch his introductory lectures on YouTube.</p>
<p>In particular, the playlist I recommend</p>
<p>is called Virology Lectures 2021.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out the sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>As a side note, please allow me to say</p>
<p>a few words about the COVID vaccines.</p>
<p>Some people are scared of a virus hurting</p>
<p>or killing somebody they love.</p>
<p>Some are scared of their government betraying them,</p>
<p>their leaders blinded by power and greed.</p>
<p>I have both of these fears.</p>
<p>And two, I&rsquo;m afraid, as FDR said, of fear itself.</p>
<p>Fear manifests as anger and anger leads to division</p>
<p>in the hands of charismatic leaders</p>
<p>who then manufacture truth in quotes</p>
<p>that maximize controversy and a sense of imminent crisis</p>
<p>that only they can save us from.</p>
<p>And though I&rsquo;m sometimes mocked for this,</p>
<p>I still believe that love, compassion, empathy</p>
<p>is the way out from this vicious downward spiral of division.</p>
<p>I personally took the vaccine</p>
<p>based on my understanding of the data,</p>
<p>deciding that for me, the risk of negative effects</p>
<p>from COVID, short term and long term,</p>
<p>are far worse than the negative effects</p>
<p>from the mRNA vaccine.</p>
<p>I read, I thought, I decided, for me.</p>
<p>But I never have and never will talk down to people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t take the vaccine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m humble enough to know just how little I know,</p>
<p>how wrong I have been and will be</p>
<p>on many of my beliefs and ideas.</p>
<p>I think dogmatic certainty and division</p>
<p>is more destructive in the long term than any virus.</p>
<p>The solution for me personally, like I said,</p>
<p>is to choose empathy and compassion</p>
<p>towards all fellow human beings,</p>
<p>no matter who they voted for.</p>
<p>I hope you do the same.</p>
<p>Read, think, and try to imagine</p>
<p>that what you currently think is the truth</p>
<p>may be totally wrong.</p>
<p>This mindset is one that opens you to discovery,</p>
<p>innovation, and wisdom.</p>
<p>I hope my conversation with Vincent Racanello</p>
<p>is a useful resource for just this kind of exploration.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t talk down to people</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s the most knowledgeable virologist</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever spoken to.</p>
<p>He has no political agenda,</p>
<p>no desire to mock those who disagree with him.</p>
<p>He just loves biology</p>
<p>and explaining the fundamental mechanisms</p>
<p>of how biological systems work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great person to listen to</p>
<p>and learn from with an open mind.</p>
<p>I hope you join me in doing so,</p>
<p>and no matter what,</p>
<p>try to put more love out there in the world.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Vincent Racanello.</p>
<p>You mentioned in one of your lectures on virology</p>
<p>that there are more viruses</p>
<p>in a leader of coastal seawater</p>
<p>than people on earth.</p>
<p>In the Nature article titled Microbiology by Numbers,</p>
<p>it says there are 10 to the 31 viruses on earth.</p>
<p>Also it says that the rate of viral infection</p>
<p>in the ocean stands at 10 to the 23 infections per second.</p>
<p>And these infections remove 20 to 40%</p>
<p>of all bacterial cells each day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a war going on.</p>
<p>Do you, what do you make of these numbers?</p>
<p>Or why are there so many viruses?</p>
<p>So the numbers you&rsquo;re quoting,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in my first virology lecture, right?</p>
<p>Because people don&rsquo;t know these numbers</p>
<p>and they get, whoa, they get wild by them.</p>
<p>So I love to give them.</p>
<p>So the way, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>As I was saying offline,</p>
<p>you have one of the best introductory lectures on virology</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever seen, introductory lectures, period.</p>
<p>So I highly recommend people</p>
<p>find you on YouTube and watch it</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re curious at all about viruses.</p>
<p>It, yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of times throughout watching it,</p>
<p>I felt like, whoa.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s my goal is to work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what my students tell me.</p>
<p>One student once said, every day after every lecture,</p>
<p>I could go home and tell my roommate something</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t know and blew her away.</p>
<p>So the number of viruses is really an amazing number.</p>
<p>So that number 10 to the 31 is actually</p>
<p>just the bacterial viruses in the ocean.</p>
<p>So there are viruses that infect everything</p>
<p>on the planet, including bacteria.</p>
<p>There are a lot of bacteria in the ocean.</p>
<p>And so 10 to the 31 is from basically particle counts</p>
<p>of seawater all over the world.</p>
<p>So there are more viruses than 10 to the 31,</p>
<p>but just in the ocean.</p>
<p>And that number is so big.</p>
<p>First of all, the mass exceeds that of elephants</p>
<p>on the planet by a thousand fold.</p>
<p>And if you lined up those viruses end to end,</p>
<p>they would go 200 million light years into space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so big a number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And then yes, 10 to the 20 some infections per second</p>
<p>of these viruses killing bacteria</p>
<p>and releasing all this organic matter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of this, what we call</p>
<p>the biogeochemical pump, cycling of material in the ocean.</p>
<p>The bacteria die, they start to sink</p>
<p>and then they get metabolized</p>
<p>and converted to compounds that are needed.</p>
<p>A lot of it gets released as carbon dioxide and so forth.</p>
<p>So these are actually really important cycles</p>
<p>that are catalyzed by the virus.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s so wild that nature has developed</p>
<p>a mechanism for mass murder of bacteria.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to look at it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just what happened, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I wonder what the evolutionary advantage</p>
<p>of like such fast cycling of life is.</p>
<p>Is it just an accident of evolution</p>
<p>that viruses are so numerous</p>
<p>or is it a feature and not a bug?</p>
<p>So the fast is, it&rsquo;s not all fast.</p>
<p>Not all viruses are fast.</p>
<p>Some are 20 minutes per cycle.</p>
<p>Some take weeks per cycle, but that&rsquo;s just per second.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many viruses in the ocean</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what you get per second,</p>
<p>no matter how fast the cycle is.</p>
<p>But I look at it this way.</p>
<p>Viruses were probably the first organic entities</p>
<p>to evolve on the planet.</p>
<p>Long ago, billion years ago,</p>
<p>just as the earth cooled</p>
<p>and organic molecules began to form,</p>
<p>I think these self, we call them self replicators.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just short things that today,</p>
<p>would look like RNA, which is the basis of many viruses.</p>
<p>They evolved and they were able to replicate.</p>
<p>Of course, they were just naked molecules.</p>
<p>They had no protection and it was just RNA based.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s tough because RNA is pretty fragile in the world.</p>
<p>And it probably didn&rsquo;t get very big as a consequence.</p>
<p>But then proteins evolved and I&rsquo;m skipping like hundreds</p>
<p>of millions of years of evolution.</p>
<p>Proteins evolved, maybe without a cell, maybe with a cell.</p>
<p>But then to make a cell,</p>
<p>there probably were some RNA based cells early on,</p>
<p>but they were pretty simple.</p>
<p>But the cells that we know of today,</p>
<p>even bacteria and single celled eukaryotes,</p>
<p>they have very long DNA genomes.</p>
<p>And you need a lot of DNA to make a complicated cell.</p>
<p>And so we think at some point, the RNA became DNA.</p>
<p>And probably one of the earliest enzymes that arose</p>
<p>is the enzyme that could copy that RNA into DNA,</p>
<p>which we now know today as reverse transcriptase,</p>
<p>which my former boss, David Baltimore</p>
<p>and Howard Temin co discovered.</p>
<p>And that enzyme arose and copied RNA to DNA.</p>
<p>And then you could build big cells with DNA</p>
<p>because DNA can be millions and millions of bases</p>
<p>in length and RNA, the longest RNA we know of</p>
<p>is 40,000 bases, not much bigger than the SARS CoV2.</p>
<p>What would you say is the magic moment along that line?</p>
<p>I saw it was one or two billion,</p>
<p>maybe three billion years it took</p>
<p>to go from bacteria to complex organism.</p>
<p>It seems like Earth had a very long time,</p>
<p>not a very long time without life,</p>
<p>and then a very long time with very primitive life.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m discriminating, calling bacteria primitive life.</p>
<p>People would object to you doing that for sure.</p>
<p>But it seems like complex organism</p>
<p>when it starts becoming something like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s a good, not animal like,</p>
<p>but more complexity than just like a single cell.</p>
<p>What do you think is the magic there?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hardest thing?</p>
<p>If you were trying to engineer Earth and build life</p>
<p>and build the simulations,</p>
<p>obviously we&rsquo;re living in a video game, what this is.</p>
<p>So if you were trying to build this video game,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the hardest part along this evolution?</p>
<p>Bacteria are mostly single cells.</p>
<p>They do make colonies.</p>
<p>They get together in biofilms, which are really important.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re all single bacteria in that.</p>
<p>And the key is making an organism</p>
<p>where cells do different things.</p>
<p>We have skin cells and eye cells and brain cells.</p>
<p>Bacteria never do that.</p>
<p>And the reason is probably energy.</p>
<p>Bacteria can&rsquo;t make enough energy to do that.</p>
<p>And so there was another cell</p>
<p>existing at the time, the archaea.</p>
<p>And the idea is that a bacteria went into an archaea</p>
<p>and became the modern day mitochondria,</p>
<p>the energy factory of the cell.</p>
<p>And that now led that cell</p>
<p>develop into more and more complicated organisms</p>
<p>like we have today.</p>
<p>It was all about energy.</p>
<p>So the mitochondria, the energy,</p>
<p>the mitochondria is the magic thing.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just actually not my idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Nick Jones.</p>
<p>Have you heard of Nick Jones?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an evolutionary biologist in the UK.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s done experimental work on this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s his idea that the defining point</p>
<p>was the ability to make a lot of energy,</p>
<p>which a mitochondria can do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a whole bacteria inside of a bigger cell.</p>
<p>And that becomes what we now call eukaryotes</p>
<p>and that they can get more and more complicated.</p>
<p>So let me bring you back to the viruses.</p>
<p>I wanna finish that story.</p>
<p>Yeah, which points of viruses come along?</p>
<p>So remember, we have these precellular,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called precellular replicons, right?</p>
<p>And so we have a precellular stage</p>
<p>where we have these self replicating molecules</p>
<p>and then cells arise.</p>
<p>And then the self replicating molecules invade the cells.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a hospitable environment.</p>
<p>I mean, they didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>They just went in and it turned out</p>
<p>it was beneficial for them, so it stuck.</p>
<p>And they replicate inside the cell now</p>
<p>where they have pools of everything they need.</p>
<p>They get more and more complicated.</p>
<p>And then they steal proteins from the cell</p>
<p>to build a protective shell.</p>
<p>And then they can be released as virus particles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now protected.</p>
<p>They can move from host to host.</p>
<p>And because they&rsquo;re at the earliest stages</p>
<p>of cellular evolution, they can diversify</p>
<p>to infect anything that arises.</p>
<p>And that is why I think there&rsquo;s so many of them</p>
<p>and everything on the planet is infected</p>
<p>because the ancestor of everything</p>
<p>was infected many years ago.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easier to steal than to build from scratch.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easier to sort of break into somebody else&rsquo;s thing</p>
<p>and steal their proteins.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>My colleague, Dixon de Palmier, calls viruses safe crackers.</p>
<p>Safe crackers.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, from an evolutionary perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to steal because you can select.</p>
<p>But then you have to figure out mechanisms for stealing,</p>
<p>for breaking into, for cracking the state.</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t have to figure out.</p>
<p>It just happens, right?</p>
<p>Because molecules are so diverse</p>
<p>that a molecule gets into a cell</p>
<p>and if there&rsquo;s a protein that sticks to it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna stick and that gives an advantage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no planning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no thinking about it, right?</p>
<p>It just happens.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;ll return to that.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha ha ha.</p>
<p>What, but these numbers are crazy.</p>
<p>So what, as these more complex organisms evolved,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take us humans as an example,</p>
<p>should we be afraid of these high numbers?</p>
<p>Should we be worried</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s so many viruses in the world?</p>
<p>Well, to a certain extent.</p>
<p>I mean, they have, it&rsquo;s twofold.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re good and bad, right?</p>
<p>Viruses are no, there was no question they can be bad.</p>
<p>We know that because they&rsquo;ve infected</p>
<p>and caused disease throughout history,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also, you and I are full of viruses</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t hurt us at all and probably help us</p>
<p>and every organism is the same.</p>
<p>So they are clearly beneficial as a consequence.</p>
<p>So I think, so every living thing on the planet</p>
<p>has multiple viruses infecting everything you can see.</p>
<p>And most of them I think we don&rsquo;t worry about</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t infect us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re unable.</p>
<p>In fact, now you can actually take your feces</p>
<p>and send them to a company</p>
<p>and they will sequence your viruses in your feces for you,</p>
<p>your fecal virome, right?</p>
<p>And the most common virus in human feces</p>
<p>is a plant virus that infects peppers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called pepper model mosaic virus.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because people eat a lot of peppers</p>
<p>and it just passes right through you.</p>
<p>Cabbage is full of viruses from the insects</p>
<p>that walk on the cabbage in the fields.</p>
<p>We eat them, they just pass us.</p>
<p>So I think most of the viruses we don&rsquo;t need to worry about</p>
<p>except when we&rsquo;re talking about species</p>
<p>that are closest to us, mammals, of course.</p>
<p>And I think the most numerous ones</p>
<p>are the most concerning, they&rsquo;re viruses like bats.</p>
<p>Bats are 20% of mammals and rodents are 40% of mammals.</p>
<p>And we humans live nearby, right?</p>
<p>And we know throughout history,</p>
<p>many viruses have come from bats and from rodents to people,</p>
<p>no question about it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a proximity in terms of just living together</p>
<p>and a proximity genetically too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more likely that a virus will jump</p>
<p>from a bat and a rodent.</p>
<p>And birds too.</p>
<p>Birds can give us their viruses that&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Influenza viruses come from birds mainly.</p>
<p>So I think those are the three species,</p>
<p>not species, it&rsquo;s higher than species obviously,</p>
<p>but those are the three I would worry about</p>
<p>in terms of getting their viruses.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s out there, right?</p>
<p>We have very little clue about what viruses,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve for years wanted to capture wild mice</p>
<p>in my backyard and see what viruses they have</p>
<p>because no one knows.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an easy.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t ask them, so you mean map,</p>
<p>like is there a way?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t ask them, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I would have to sacrifice them and take tissue</p>
<p>and then bring it in the lab and do genome sequencing.</p>
<p>So you can do a thorough sequencing</p>
<p>to determine which viruses.</p>
<p>Is there a sufficiently good categorization of viruses</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;d be?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>So whenever you do sequence, right?</p>
<p>You get some environmental sample</p>
<p>and you extract nucleic acid and you sequence it.</p>
<p>What you do is you run it past the database.</p>
<p>The gold standard is the GenBank database</p>
<p>which is maintained here in the US.</p>
<p>And you see if you get any hits.</p>
<p>And then you can say, ah, look,</p>
<p>this sequence is similar to this virus.</p>
<p>And you can classify all the viruses you see.</p>
<p>The problem is 90% of your sequence is dark matter.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t hit with anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a lot of it is unknown viruses.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna be hard to figure out</p>
<p>because someone&rsquo;s gonna have to go after it</p>
<p>and sort it through.</p>
<p>So yes, you can find a lot of viruses</p>
<p>and the numbers you get are astounding.</p>
<p>You can find thousands of new viruses</p>
<p>just by looking in various life forms.</p>
<p>But there are many more that we don&rsquo;t pick up</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not in the database.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a good time to take a quick tangent.</p>
<p>What do you think about Alpha Fold 2?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve been paying attention to that.</p>
<p>With them DeepMind solving the protein folding problem</p>
<p>and then also releasing, first of all,</p>
<p>open sourcing the code, which is for me</p>
<p>as a software person, I love.</p>
<p>And then second of all, also making like 300,000 predictions</p>
<p>or something like that for different protein structures</p>
<p>and releasing that data.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On the side of,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s dark matter.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Is there something, first, what are your general thoughts,</p>
<p>level of excitement about their work?</p>
<p>And second, how can that be applied to viruses?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll be able to explore</p>
<p>the dark matter of virology using machine learning?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Because in all this dark sequence,</p>
<p>you can translate it and make a protein.</p>
<p>You can see what a protein looks like.</p>
<p>It has what we call an open reading frame, right?</p>
<p>A start and a stop.</p>
<p>And right now it&rsquo;s just a bunch of amino acids,</p>
<p>but if we could fold it,</p>
<p>maybe the fold would be like something we already know,</p>
<p>some protein fold, which gives you a lot of clues, right?</p>
<p>Because there are only so many protein folds in biology</p>
<p>and that dark matter is probably one of them.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s very exciting because for years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve followed structural biologists for years</p>
<p>and in the beginning,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t even solve structures of viruses, they&rsquo;re too big.</p>
<p>We could do small molecules like myoglobin,</p>
<p>that was the first one done, took years to do that.</p>
<p>Then as computational power increased,</p>
<p>then they could start to do viruses,</p>
<p>but it took a long time.</p>
<p>X ray crystallography,</p>
<p>depending on getting crystals of the virus, right?</p>
<p>And now we can do cryo electron microscopy,</p>
<p>which is much faster.</p>
<p>You could solve,</p>
<p>the spike of SARS COVID 2 was solved in two months</p>
<p>by Jason McClelland here in Austin actually</p>
<p>at the beginning of the pandemic,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re limited, you can&rsquo;t do huge proteins.</p>
<p>You can only do moderately sized ones.</p>
<p>So, or actually you can do viruses,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t do small proteins.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s speeded it up, but it&rsquo;s still too fast to solve.</p>
<p>You get a new protein, you wanna solve its structure.</p>
<p>So if we could predict it,</p>
<p>and I know from talking to structural biologists,</p>
<p>this has been their holy grail from day one.</p>
<p>They wanna be able to take a sequence of a protein,</p>
<p>put it in a computer and have the structure put out</p>
<p>without having to do all the experiment.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why this is very exciting</p>
<p>that you can predict it.</p>
<p>That mean it&rsquo;s not finished obviously,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s more to do,</p>
<p>but I think it will be a day</p>
<p>where you could take any amino acid sequence</p>
<p>and predict what it&rsquo;s gonna look like.</p>
<p>See, but like aren&rsquo;t structural biologists</p>
<p>gonna get greedy?</p>
<p>So once you have that,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you wanna go more complicated then?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you wanna go,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just the first step, right?</p>
<p>You go from amino acid to the structure,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s like multiple protein interactions.</p>
<p>Like how do you get to the virus?</p>
<p>Well, so that&rsquo;s what the ultimate goal</p>
<p>of getting a structure is that then you can do experiments</p>
<p>and figure out what the structure means, right?</p>
<p>So many, in the old days,</p>
<p>structural biology was a career in itself.</p>
<p>You worked with people who had a system</p>
<p>and just solve proteins for them,</p>
<p>and then you moved on to another one.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t really do any experiments.</p>
<p>The other people got to do all the interesting experiments.</p>
<p>Now, young structural biologists are multifaceted.</p>
<p>They solve the structure,</p>
<p>and then they say,</p>
<p>what happens if we change this amino acid?</p>
<p>Oh, look, it blocks binding to the receptor.</p>
<p>This must be the receptor binding interface.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the exciting stuff, absolutely,</p>
<p>is doing the experiment.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder if you can do some kinds of like simulations</p>
<p>of like, you know, different proteins</p>
<p>or multi protein systems going to war against each other,</p>
<p>like to try to figure out, you know,</p>
<p>reinforcement learning is used in alpha zero, for example,</p>
<p>to learn chess and go,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s using the self play mechanism</p>
<p>where the thing plays against itself</p>
<p>and learns better and better.</p>
<p>Whether you can, I wonder if you can simulate</p>
<p>almost evolution in that way</p>
<p>for primitive biological systems,</p>
<p>have them in simulation, fight each other,</p>
<p>and then see what comes out,</p>
<p>like a super dangerous virus comes out</p>
<p>or super like Chuck Norris type of thing</p>
<p>that defends against the super dangerous virus,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all in simulation.</p>
<p>So an example would be,</p>
<p>we have all these variants of SARS COVID 2 arising, right?</p>
<p>Which look to be selected by immune responses,</p>
<p>but we know what amino acids are changing in the spike</p>
<p>and how they block antibody binding.</p>
<p>You could simulate that.</p>
<p>You could say, what is the antibody looking at?</p>
<p>Where antibodies bind on proteins are called epitopes, right?</p>
<p>You could map them all and change them in a simulation</p>
<p>one by one and go back and forth</p>
<p>between the antibody and the virus.</p>
<p>So all these, evolution is what we call an arms race, right?</p>
<p>The virus changes and then it evades the host</p>
<p>and then the host can change.</p>
<p>The host takes longer to change though, unfortunately.</p>
<p>It takes geological time, but it can.</p>
<p>And then the virus can change</p>
<p>and it can go back and forth.</p>
<p>And we can see evidence of this in genome sequences</p>
<p>of both viruses and their hosts.</p>
<p>And so you can take a protein in a host</p>
<p>that is a receptor for multiple viruses</p>
<p>and you can see all the impacts of virus pressure on it.</p>
<p>And you could simulate that for sure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just one thing that you could do.</p>
<p>You could simulate changes in say an enzyme</p>
<p>that makes it resistant to a drug</p>
<p>and predict all the drug resistance.</p>
<p>But the problem is people like me,</p>
<p>the experimental virologists</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how to do any of that.</p>
<p>So we need to collaborate with people, I guess.</p>
<p>Oh, with other humans.</p>
<p>We do that, we do that.</p>
<p>But with people from a field that we&rsquo;re not used to,</p>
<p>I suppose people who, would it be AI, I suppose?</p>
<p>Yeah, machine learning people.</p>
<p>Machine learning people.</p>
<p>And you would say, look, this is the biological problem.</p>
<p>Is there a way we can use your tools to attack it?</p>
<p>The problem is those people are antisocial introverts</p>
<p>that have a place like this</p>
<p>and try to hide from other people in the world.</p>
<p>Very difficult to find in the wild.</p>
<p>Okay, so outside of doing amazing brilliant lectures online,</p>
<p>you host and produce five, I would say, related podcasts,</p>
<p>including my favorite, This Week in Virology,</p>
<p>also This Week in Parasitism,</p>
<p>This Week in Microbiology, and so on.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a good person to ask,</p>
<p>what are the categories of small things,</p>
<p>small biological things in this world that can kill you,</p>
<p>kill us humans?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look, you said like most viruses are friendly</p>
<p>or at least not unfriendly.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s look at the unfriendly ones.</p>
<p>And viruses and bacteria and those kinds of things.</p>
<p>When you look at the full spectrum of things</p>
<p>that can kill you, can you kind of paint a brief picture?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the big picture is that</p>
<p>the things that can kill you are a minority</p>
<p>of everything that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about molecules.</p>
<p>So we have in us proteins that can kill us.</p>
<p>Preons that are just, it&rsquo;s a protein in us.</p>
<p>And if it misfolds, it makes all of its other copies misfold</p>
<p>and then you die of a neurological disease.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty rare.</p>
<p>So there are proteins, there are viruses.</p>
<p>And as I said, only certain ones can kill us.</p>
<p>But even if we get those from animals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not straightforward.</p>
<p>If you look at SARS CoV2, right?</p>
<p>This is probably a once in a hundred year pandemic,</p>
<p>I would say, equivalent to 1918 in its devastation.</p>
<p>And in between there have been smaller pandemics</p>
<p>of other viruses, but it doesn&rsquo;t happen all that often.</p>
<p>So we have a lot of viruses.</p>
<p>We have a lot of bacteria of various sorts</p>
<p>that can cause infections in us.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a limited number, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re streptococci and staphylococci and clostridia.</p>
<p>We could go on and on, but we know how to handle those.</p>
<p>As long as we have antimicrobials,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that we abuse them and we get resistant.</p>
<p>So that can be a problem.</p>
<p>Then we have fungi, not mushrooms,</p>
<p>but much smaller fungi that multiply sub microscopic</p>
<p>or just at the microscopic level.</p>
<p>They can, in dry climates of the US,</p>
<p>you can inhale their spores and they can grow in your lung</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re immunosuppressed and so forth.</p>
<p>So those are the tiny guys.</p>
<p>And then we have parasites,</p>
<p>which we do this week in parasitism,</p>
<p>where single cells, even worms of various sorts</p>
<p>can invade you and cause all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>How, I was like kind of terrified to listen to that podcast.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, what you learn is that you can,</p>
<p>you travel somewhere and you can get infected</p>
<p>and bring it back home.</p>
<p>Here in the US, we do have certain kinds of parasites,</p>
<p>but because of our lifestyle,</p>
<p>we more or less have avoided them.</p>
<p>For example, there&rsquo;s a parasite called toxoplasma,</p>
<p>which is infected most of the world, actually,</p>
<p>because a lot of people like to eat raw meat</p>
<p>and you would get it from raw meat.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not as fond of that here in the US.</p>
<p>We like to cook our meat,</p>
<p>but that could be a consequence of eating raw meat.</p>
<p>Is that what leads to, what is it called, toxoplasmosis?</p>
<p>Yeah, so toxoplasmosis, it&rsquo;s mainly,</p>
<p>a big issue is if you&rsquo;re pregnant and you get toxo,</p>
<p>then your fetus is gonna be very badly malformed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna have brain defects and so forth.</p>
<p>And animals can get it as well.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of parasites of that nature,</p>
<p>which you often acquire by food,</p>
<p>eating food of different sorts.</p>
<p>And it usually happens elsewhere.</p>
<p>On This Week in Parasitism, we do a case.</p>
<p>So Daniel Griffin is our resident physician.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a doctor, a real doctor, right?</p>
<p>And every month, he comes up with a case.</p>
<p>Okay, this is a person I saw.</p>
<p>And last month, this young lady had traveled somewhere</p>
<p>and she ate raw fish.</p>
<p>It was somewhere Southeast Asia or something.</p>
<p>And she ended up with red bumps all over her skin.</p>
<p>And it turned out it was a parasite from the fish</p>
<p>that moved around in her and very easy to cure.</p>
<p>We have, if the right doctors and the right drugs,</p>
<p>you can cure all these things.</p>
<p>What about diagnose, like connect the red spots</p>
<p>to the fact that it&rsquo;s a parasite?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy if you have the right diagnostics.</p>
<p>Now, Daniel often goes to parts of the world</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t have diagnostics</p>
<p>and he has to use other mechanisms.</p>
<p>He may have to take a bit and look at it under a microscope.</p>
<p>And then he may not be able to get the drug</p>
<p>depending on where he is.</p>
<p>But often he sees patients who come back to the US</p>
<p>and they get diarrhea or they have a fever.</p>
<p>And he said, where have you been?</p>
<p>And he can put two and two together.</p>
<p>And so we let our listeners do that.</p>
<p>And they all send in guesses.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s wonderful to hear them go through this.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of parasites that can get you.</p>
<p>You have to be careful about eating when you go overseas.</p>
<p>And water too?</p>
<p>Water as well.</p>
<p>And in parts of Africa, there are parasites in the lakes</p>
<p>that if you go swimming, they can invade you.</p>
<p>And in fact, they can go into your hair follicles</p>
<p>and burrow in and get into your bloodstream.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>So Daniel is interesting because he&rsquo;s very adventurous</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not afraid of any of this.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a famous lake in Africa, Lake Malawi,</p>
<p>which harbors a lot of these parasites.</p>
<p>And he said, oh yeah, yeah, I just make sure</p>
<p>I towel off vigorously when I get out and get rid of them.</p>
<p>And that was the name of an episode.</p>
<p>But food is, sushi, you can get worms from sushi.</p>
<p>And the solution is to freeze it.</p>
<p>And many sushi restaurants now have liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>They snap freeze their sushi and that kills all the parasites.</p>
<p>And a study was actually done in Japan</p>
<p>showing that freezing does not alter the taste of sushi</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s up, you see a big industry there.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was thinking about, I&rsquo;m so boring and bland</p>
<p>that especially when I am now in Texas here</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been eating quite a bit of barbecue,</p>
<p>I realized I really haven&rsquo;t explored the culinary world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been curious to travel and taste different foods.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say by way of advice,</p>
<p>channeling Daniel, I guess, if you were to travel</p>
<p>in the world, if eating is the thing</p>
<p>that gets you the parasites,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a good advice for eating</p>
<p>in strange parts of the world, Mongolia, India, China?</p>
<p>Is there something you could say by way of advice?</p>
<p>I think Daniel would say,</p>
<p>make sure your food is cooked, right?</p>
<p>Cooked, but that&rsquo;s so boring.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s unfortunate.</p>
<p>And he would agree with you</p>
<p>because many vegetables are delicious.</p>
<p>Salads even are delicious, not cooked,</p>
<p>but they can have parasites in them.</p>
<p>Meats, fish, people like to have uncooked fish.</p>
<p>So if you wanna be really safe and boring,</p>
<p>just make sure everything is cooked.</p>
<p>And now we have a case this week on TWIP</p>
<p>of a young man who went, I forgot where he went,</p>
<p>but he stayed in a hotel.</p>
<p>I think, oh, Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
<p>Stayed in a hotel.</p>
<p>And he came back with diarrhea and fever.</p>
<p>And he said, I don&rsquo;t know where, I stayed in the hotel.</p>
<p>I just ate hotel food, lots of vegetables and fruits,</p>
<p>and probably they weren&rsquo;t washed with clean water.</p>
<p>He got something from that.</p>
<p>The bottom line is most of these infections</p>
<p>with parasites can be diagnosed,</p>
<p>and you can be treated, and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>So if you really wanna experience the cuisine,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you should worry about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Daniel would say.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return to the basics.</p>
<p>We can then jump around all over the place.</p>
<p>What are the basic principles of virology?</p>
<p>Maybe a good place to start is what is a virus?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I mean, I talk in my first lecture for 20 minutes</p>
<p>before I get to that.</p>
<p>But, and I wonder if I should put it up front,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of a boring definition.</p>
<p>So if you do that first, people will turn off.</p>
<p>So first you tell them about all the millions and billions</p>
<p>of viruses around.</p>
<p>So a virus, we have a very specific definition</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s different from everything else on the planet.</p>
<p>Because first of all, it&rsquo;s a parasite.</p>
<p>It takes, a parasite means you take something</p>
<p>from someone else.</p>
<p>We have human parasites who take money from others, right?</p>
<p>But in biological terms, a parasite takes something</p>
<p>from the host that the host would otherwise use energy</p>
<p>or some building block or something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never really a symbiotic relationship</p>
<p>between a virus and a host.</p>
<p>Well, there can be.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the dichotomy I think is that we define them</p>
<p>as parasites, yet I just told you 20 minutes ago</p>
<p>that many viruses are probably beneficial.</p>
<p>So I think what it means is we, at some point</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to change our definition, right?</p>
<p>Because after all, definitions we make are just constructs</p>
<p>that make it easy for us to study,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t necessarily represent what&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, like Pluto was a planet at first</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s not a planet anymore</p>
<p>and a lot of people are very upset.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s only according to us.</p>
<p>There may be another race living somewhere else</p>
<p>who thinks it&rsquo;s a planet, right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe that&rsquo;s why viruses are attacking humans.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very angry.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re calling them parasites.</p>
<p>So right now our definition includes parasite</p>
<p>because a virus cannot do anything without a cell.</p>
<p>If this mug were full of viruses,</p>
<p>it would not do anything for years.</p>
<p>It would eventually probably lose its infectivity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not gonna reproduce here, it needs cells.</p>
<p>And to the first people who discovered viruses,</p>
<p>that was astounding that they didn&rsquo;t just reproduce,</p>
<p>divide on their own like bacteria.</p>
<p>So a virus needs to get inside of a cell,</p>
<p>inside the cell, it can&rsquo;t just hang around on the surface.</p>
<p>It needs to get in in order to make more of itself.</p>
<p>And so we call it an obligate intracellular parasite</p>
<p>because it needs to get in a cell</p>
<p>and then it takes things from the cell</p>
<p>in the form of all kinds of molecules</p>
<p>and processes and energy and so forth to make new viruses.</p>
<p>Obligate means it&rsquo;s obligated to be inside the cell.</p>
<p>Absolutely, it will not reproduce outside of the cell.</p>
<p>So this mug of viruses can in no way be living,</p>
<p>in my opinion.</p>
<p>However, once it gets inside of a cell,</p>
<p>now the cell is a virus infected cell, it&rsquo;s alive.</p>
<p>So a virus, in my view, has two phases, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this nonliving particulate phase</p>
<p>that everyone is used to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send you, you need a virus for your table.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send you a nice model.</p>
<p>I think it would look good here.</p>
<p>Which, yes, definitely.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go with all this other stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, these are all mechanical.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no biology here.</p>
<p>So you wouldn&rsquo;t want a virus here?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;d want a virus, of course.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ll send you one and then you can look at it.</p>
<p>Because now that we have the three dimensional structures</p>
<p>solved by structural biologists,</p>
<p>we take the coordinates and we put it in a 3D printer</p>
<p>and you can make amazing models, right?</p>
<p>Of any virus.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a huge variety of viruses?</p>
<p>Huge, that we know of,</p>
<p>which is only a fraction of what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the categories?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s RNA, there&rsquo;s DNA viruses.</p>
<p>What are those, what&rsquo;s DNA and RNA?</p>
<p>Two broad categorizations.</p>
<p>RNA, these are genetic material.</p>
<p>Can be two different chemicals.</p>
<p>So RNA, everything else on the planet besides viruses</p>
<p>is all DNA based.</p>
<p>You and I are DNA based.</p>
<p>Everything on the planet today is DNA based,</p>
<p>except some viruses are RNA based.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the first life that arose on the planet was RNA based.</p>
<p>Yeah, so these are like old school viruses.</p>
<p>These are old school.</p>
<p>We call relics, yeah.</p>
<p>Relics, and this has got a name,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the RNA world, which I think is great.</p>
<p>Is it big still, or are the relics dying out?</p>
<p>Oh no, the relics, in my opinion,</p>
<p>are the most successful viruses, the RNA viruses.</p>
<p>And SARS CoV2 is an RNA virus.</p>
<p>We can talk about why they&rsquo;re so successful.</p>
<p>But you have, broadly speaking, viruses with RNA,</p>
<p>genetic information, which are relics.</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re contemporary.</p>
<p>They have adapted to the modern world</p>
<p>and the modern organisms living in it.</p>
<p>And then we have DNA based viruses,</p>
<p>which are extremely conservative and slow.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very successful.</p>
<p>Everyone has a herpes virus infection,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t get the news like the RNA viruses do.</p>
<p>The HIVs and the influenza viruses</p>
<p>and the SARS Coronaviruses, they get all the press</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re RNA based, because RNA lets you change</p>
<p>more so than DNA.</p>
<p>So they evolve much faster, the RNA viruses.</p>
<p>Much faster.</p>
<p>And in fact, I have an lecture on evolution.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve listened to that one.</p>
<p>You should, it&rsquo;s really, I think it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>RNA viruses exist at their error threshold,</p>
<p>which means they can&rsquo;t make any more mutations</p>
<p>when they reproduce, otherwise they&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>They would go extinct.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re evolving at their error threshold.</p>
<p>DNA viruses are hundreds of times lower</p>
<p>than their error thresholds.</p>
<p>And we know this, we can do an experiment to find that out.</p>
<p>Now, why that is, is a good question,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the reason why RNA viruses</p>
<p>are far more successful.</p>
<p>They infect many more hosts and they&rsquo;re very,</p>
<p>I would say slippery.</p>
<p>They can change hosts really quickly,</p>
<p>because in any animal harboring an RNA virus,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say a bat in some cave somewhere,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just one genome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s millions of different genomes of all kinds,</p>
<p>all within the framework of, say, coronavirus,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all different.</p>
<p>And one genome in there might just be right</p>
<p>for infecting a person if it ever encountered that person.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the thing that.</p>
<p>Or there could be a large number.</p>
<p>This is a tiny fraction, but a large number of them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all operating at the threshold of error.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like little, like it&rsquo;s like startups,</p>
<p>little entrepreneurs, like a startup world.</p>
<p>Yes, and many of them fail.</p>
<p>Yeah, many of them fail.</p>
<p>Many of the changes fail.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the DNA viruses that are like the IBM</p>
<p>and the Google. Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>The big corporations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very good, I like that.</p>
<p>They become conservative with the bureaucracies</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff, so they.</p>
<p>And a lot of baggage.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s expensive for them to reproduce, yeah.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t move quickly.</p>
<p>Yes, the RNA viruses are the fast moving members.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what a virus is.</p>
<p>We call them ovulated intracellular parasites.</p>
<p>And then I told you there&rsquo;s DNA and RNA,</p>
<p>but then let&rsquo;s go further.</p>
<p>The nucleic acid is not naked.</p>
<p>Because naked nucleic acid in the world isn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>I mean, it existed in the precellular world,</p>
<p>but there probably weren&rsquo;t a lot of threats to it then.</p>
<p>Naked nucleic acid doesn&rsquo;t last long in the environment.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re covered, the nucleic acid is covered.</p>
<p>It can be covered with a protein shell,</p>
<p>a pure protein shell, or it can have a membrane around it,</p>
<p>which would be lipids from the host cell.</p>
<p>So lipids, so it&rsquo;s a fatty membrane.</p>
<p>Fatty membrane, yeah, so our cells</p>
<p>are coated with fatty membranes, right?</p>
<p>Our cells, the outer plasma membrane, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>Viruses can be too.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re kind of like cells,</p>
<p>but without the ability to do the mitochondria stuff.</p>
<p>Some are, they don&rsquo;t have nuclei,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have mitochondria.</p>
<p>But they do have a nucleic acid, they have a membrane,</p>
<p>and then of course there&rsquo;s spikes in the membrane</p>
<p>that allow them to attach to cells.</p>
<p>And so that completes our two different kinds.</p>
<p>So they have, they all have like attachment mechanisms,</p>
<p>like ways to, like keys into the cell.</p>
<p>They all have to get into cells.</p>
<p>There are a couple of exceptions though.</p>
<p>There are viruses of fungi and plants.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do the fungi.</p>
<p>Fungi would be like yeast.</p>
<p>The yeast cell wall is pretty hard to get through.</p>
<p>So viruses typically don&rsquo;t attach to a yeast</p>
<p>and get inside.</p>
<p>Rather, they just live in the yeast forever.</p>
<p>And they multiply as mostly nucleic acids,</p>
<p>and as the yeast divide, they go into the daughter cells.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how they exist.</p>
<p>Plant viruses, also the plant cell wall</p>
<p>would be very hard to get across by binding a protein.</p>
<p>So plant viruses get into plants either by</p>
<p>pests that inject them in, they&rsquo;re sucking sap out,</p>
<p>and they inject virus at the same time.</p>
<p>Or farmers, they have contaminated farm equipment</p>
<p>and they roll over the plants and introduces viruses.</p>
<p>So those fungi and plant viruses,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have this specific receptor binding</p>
<p>to get them into the cell.</p>
<p>But everything else, yeah, the virus binds</p>
<p>to something on the surface, very specific.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken into the cell because that&rsquo;s what cells do.</p>
<p>When things bind their exterior, they take it in.</p>
<p>Because in most cases, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something they need.</p>
<p>And so the virus slips in.</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;d call that a Trojan horse, right?</p>
<p>Trojan horse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to not anthropomorphize this whole thing.</p>
<p>It is hard.</p>
<p>So obviously, they don&rsquo;t know any of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an actual Trojan horse.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not getting actually tricked</p>
<p>in the way humans trick each other.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s all passive.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just through so many years of evolution,</p>
<p>you select something that works, and it continues.</p>
<p>And what survives then goes on</p>
<p>with perhaps a slightly different approach.</p>
<p>I love this idea of passive.</p>
<p>Of course, according to Sam Harris,</p>
<p>so for my sufficiently intelligent alien civilization</p>
<p>observing humans, our behavior might seem passive too</p>
<p>because they understand fully exactly what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s no free will,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all just operating in the same way.</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>A cell does, but just a much higher level of complexity.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I love the distinction between active and passive.</p>
<p>I mean, the point is, I think anthropomorphizing</p>
<p>to a certain extent is fine</p>
<p>because it helps people understand.</p>
<p>But when you start to say,</p>
<p>I think the virus is doing that</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re putting a human lens on it,</p>
<p>and you may be wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t know why things happen for a virus.</p>
<p>So right now, we have variants emerging,</p>
<p>and people say, well, I think it&rsquo;s because the antibodies</p>
<p>are selecting for variants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good idea,</p>
<p>but it may not be the only thing that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>You start imagining them coming to the table negotiating.</p>
<p>Yeah, you get into trouble with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I tell my students,</p>
<p>be careful about the anthropomorphizing</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna apply your values to a virus,</p>
<p>and you have different values.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a human, and you have,</p>
<p>what you think is the reason for this outcome</p>
<p>may not be right, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>Just be open minded about it.</p>
<p>In both directions.</p>
<p>I actually, one of the things that pushed back</p>
<p>on this in the space of robotics,</p>
<p>people, most people in robotics</p>
<p>try to not anthropomorphize.</p>
<p>For example, they don&rsquo;t give a gender or a name to robots.</p>
<p>They really try to see it as a machine.</p>
<p>And to me, that makes sense in one way,</p>
<p>but it totally doesn&rsquo;t make sense in another.</p>
<p>If that robot is to interact,</p>
<p>operate in the human world and interact with humans,</p>
<p>we have to anthropomorphize it</p>
<p>in order to understand, as an engineering problem,</p>
<p>how should it operate in a human world?</p>
<p>Now, the difference with viruses, the scale of operation,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to treat them as humanlike</p>
<p>because the scale of operations is much smaller.</p>
<p>But with robots, you&rsquo;re in the same time scale,</p>
<p>the same spatial scale.</p>
<p>Of course, in the movies,</p>
<p>they always give them names and personalities, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, yeah, that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s my argument is we should do the same</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to solve</p>
<p>the engineering problem of robotics too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just for the movies.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you this,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve said, controversially, not really,</p>
<p>that viruses are not living.</p>
<p>Defend yourself.</p>
<p>Are viruses alive or not?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve seen many people say, oh, they have to be,</p>
<p>they have nucleic acids, they evolve, they mutate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all true, but they don&rsquo;t do it on their own.</p>
<p>The particles in my mug are just not doing any of that</p>
<p>unless they get into a cell.</p>
<p>So a virus infected cell is alive.</p>
<p>I totally agree with that,</p>
<p>because in fact, when a virus gets in a cell,</p>
<p>it converts it into a virus making factory, if you will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer a cell.</p>
<p>Some people call it a viro cell.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like that, but it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>The particle is not alive.</p>
<p>You can have your virus infected cell as alive,</p>
<p>but the particle, it just would not do anything forever</p>
<p>without getting inside of a cell.</p>
<p>But once it&rsquo;s in a cell, it is alive then,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s no longer a particle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken apart and nucleic acid is moving</p>
<p>around the cell, it&rsquo;s making proteins.</p>
<p>Eventually it makes new particles.</p>
<p>And then those particles released from the cell,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not living anymore.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of, I think it&rsquo;s kind of like a spore,</p>
<p>a spore of a, or a seed.</p>
<p>Although the seed just doesn&rsquo;t work because the seeds,</p>
<p>the cells in the seed have the ability</p>
<p>to make their own energy and so forth.</p>
<p>But a bacterial spore, and it&rsquo;s the same thing,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do anything unless you add water and nutrients</p>
<p>and then it starts to divide.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t need to get into a cell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different from a virus.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why the particle.</p>
<p>And when people think of virus,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always thinking of the particle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I say it can&rsquo;t be alive</p>
<p>because the particle can&rsquo;t do anything on its own.</p>
<p>But if you think of a virus as an organism</p>
<p>with a particle phase in a cell,</p>
<p>then it makes sense to be alive.</p>
<p>And by the way, when you say particle,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re referring to that structure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been mentioning,</p>
<p>some parts of the membrane and not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been called, what is that,</p>
<p>a virion particle or something?</p>
<p>Virion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s what you should have here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send you one.</p>
<p>And then you can refer to it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the sexiest one to have?</p>
<p>Like what, in terms of particles to have on a table?</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately, the ones that you can 3D print.</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;re not going to be super.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones that we know the structures of, right?</p>
<p>So someone sent me last year</p>
<p>a 3D model of SARS CoV2, and it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually cracked open so you can see the RNA</p>
<p>and the spikes are sticking out.</p>
<p>And they even put some antibodies sticking onto the spikes.</p>
<p>And I mean, when I show this on a live stream,</p>
<p>people love this.</p>
<p>They go, oh my God, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>I have that.</p>
<p>I have my virus that I worked on</p>
<p>most of my career, poliovirus.</p>
<p>I have a 3D model of that, which I actually just had made.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gorgeous.</p>
<p>And you can have it made in any color you want, right?</p>
<p>What would you say is the most fascinating,</p>
<p>terrifying, surprising, beautiful virus to you?</p>
<p>So of all the viruses you looked at,</p>
<p>sometimes when you just sit late at night</p>
<p>with a glass of wine looking over the sunset,</p>
<p>which virus do you think about?</p>
<p>So fulfilling all of those adjectives is hard, right?</p>
<p>Fascinating, exciting, terrifying.</p>
<p>Well, the terrifying is an optional one, I think,</p>
<p>because maybe that puts a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>See, terrifying, to me, I&rsquo;m not terrified</p>
<p>because I think we can handle most viruses.</p>
<p>As you see with this brand new one that emerged a year ago,</p>
<p>we can handle it.</p>
<p>From a virology perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the human perspective</p>
<p>is a different story, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always an issue.</p>
<p>But so I think there are a couple of different categories</p>
<p>of virus.</p>
<p>You could do the terrifying,</p>
<p>and I think rabies is a terrifying virus</p>
<p>because unless you&rsquo;re vaccinated,</p>
<p>100% certainty you&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>So you get bitten by a rabid raccoon or bat or dog, whatever,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s still 70,000 deaths a year of rabies</p>
<p>throughout the world because there are a lot of feral dogs</p>
<p>running around that are infected.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re vaccinated, you&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing we can do.</p>
<p>But we do have a vaccine</p>
<p>which we can actually give you</p>
<p>even after you&rsquo;ve been bitten,</p>
<p>which is the only vaccine that works that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a therapeutic, right?</p>
<p>It will treat your illness</p>
<p>because the disease takes so long to develop.</p>
<p>Eventually, you get all kinds of neurological issues</p>
<p>and paralysis and so forth, but it takes time,</p>
<p>and you can be vaccinated.</p>
<p>It will prevent that in the meanwhile.</p>
<p>So people always say,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the most lethal virus?</p>
<p>Is it Ebola?</p>
<p>I said, no, it&rsquo;s actually rabies.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re vaccinated, it will kill you.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s good to linger,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ll talk about vaccines a few times today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to linger on cases</p>
<p>where vaccines have clearly,</p>
<p>undoubtedly helped human civilization.</p>
<p>And it seems like rabies is a good example.</p>
<p>Oh, rabies is great because everyone knows what happens</p>
<p>when somebody gets rabies, right?</p>
<p>You have fear of water, hydrophobia.</p>
<p>Your body becomes spastic and stiff and jerks around,</p>
<p>and you lose consciousness.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, no more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fun ride to death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a horrible way to die.</p>
<p>So I think most people know that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been popularized enough in media, right?</p>
<p>So that nobody would probably object to getting,</p>
<p>oh, I was just bit by this raccoon and it ran off.</p>
<p>Okay, well, we should assume it&rsquo;s rabid.</p>
<p>We should immunize you.</p>
<p>And most people are okay with that,</p>
<p>because they know the consequences.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also pretty rare, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like something that you&rsquo;re trying to get</p>
<p>into the arms of 250, 300 million Americans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>But the few thousand every year, it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>So the transmissibility is difficult, right?</p>
<p>It has to, oh, it&rsquo;s not airborne.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not airborne.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you have to be bitten.</p>
<p>Although some people claim you could walk into a cave</p>
<p>and the bats breathing out rabies virus could infect you,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t really think that&rsquo;s well substantiated.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a bite.</p>
<p>How would you do a study on that?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very hard to do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to collect the vapors in the cave</p>
<p>and show that they&rsquo;re infectious, which,</p>
<p>and by the way, someone emailed me the other day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll like this.</p>
<p>They say, why can&rsquo;t we just immunize</p>
<p>all the bats in the world against these viruses?</p>
<p>And I said, well, how would you do that?</p>
<p>There are caves everywhere, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He said, well, maybe you could just go and aerosolize.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty dangerous.</p>
<p>And then all the bats should have vaccine passports</p>
<p>to make sure that they&rsquo;re all.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I said, you have to get their consent</p>
<p>before you do it.</p>
<p>But we do immunize wildlife against rabies.</p>
<p>We have rabies vaccines for wild animals.</p>
<p>There are a whole bunch of them that get rabies.</p>
<p>And we put it in bait</p>
<p>and drop it from helicopters in the woods</p>
<p>and it drops down the incidence of rabies in people.</p>
<p>People hiking, get bitten and so forth,</p>
<p>it drops the incidence.</p>
<p>So we can do that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>I always wondered how much medical care</p>
<p>are we doing for animals in the wild</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve recently become more and more aware</p>
<p>that animals are living in extreme poverty, right?</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t know, you think like natural, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Like when animals are living on a farm, it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>But then you also have to compare to like</p>
<p>what life is like in the, or like the zoo.</p>
<p>You have to compare what life is like in the wild.</p>
<p>Well, the life in the wild is very tough, I think.</p>
<p>Most animals have to, well, the carnivores anyway,</p>
<p>they have to catch their food every day, right?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the viruses there.</p>
<p>Yeah, viruses as well.</p>
<p>So the rabies immunization is the only one I&rsquo;m aware of</p>
<p>for wild animals.</p>
<p>We do immunize lots of other animals.</p>
<p>So we immunize chickens and pigs and cows,</p>
<p>even fish, farmed fish.</p>
<p>We pick each fish up and give it an injection,</p>
<p>you know, when it&rsquo;s a small fish.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s mostly so that the farmers get a good yield.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really care about the animals, right?</p>
<p>We want a good yield for market.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s some examples where we immunize animals</p>
<p>to prevent spillovers into people.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a disease called Hendra in Australia,</p>
<p>which was discovered in the 90s.</p>
<p>And it turns out that there are bats, fruit bats,</p>
<p>that have this virus, and the bats are fine,</p>
<p>but sometimes they fly into horse stalls</p>
<p>and the horses get infected.</p>
<p>In Australia, it was initially racehorses,</p>
<p>which are very expensive, right?</p>
<p>The horses got infected and they died,</p>
<p>and the humans who would take care of them would die also.</p>
<p>So now they immunize the horses to prevent the,</p>
<p>well, to save the horses.</p>
<p>Probably that&rsquo;s the motivation,</p>
<p>because these horses are hundreds of thousands of dollars,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And then the people don&rsquo;t get sick</p>
<p>because the horses don&rsquo;t get sick.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to immunize all the people</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too rare.</p>
<p>But that approach is called the one world health approach,</p>
<p>which means everything&rsquo;s connected on the planet.</p>
<p>And we have to think of everything in the grander scheme,</p>
<p>not just us.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can immunize some things</p>
<p>along the trajectory that a virus would take.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Some living beings.</p>
<p>In the Arabian Peninsula,</p>
<p>they have a MERS coronavirus issue every month.</p>
<p>There are a couple of cases where a camel</p>
<p>will infect a human, and the human can get very sick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a respiratory disease, very much like COVID.</p>
<p>And so camels are very common there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re raced, they&rsquo;re used as pets, they&rsquo;re eaten.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of human camel contact.</p>
<p>But the number of cases are rare, two a month.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to immunize all the humans.</p>
<p>So the idea would be to immunize the camels.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>So, okay, so you put rabies.</p>
<p>But Ebola also is a famously deadly one.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>It kills like, I don&rsquo;t know, 50%, 60% of its.</p>
<p>It could be 50 to 90, but that&rsquo;s in Africa,</p>
<p>where the healthcare isn&rsquo;t great.</p>
<p>You saw when the cases of Ebola came to the U.S.,</p>
<p>we could take care of it.</p>
<p>We knew how to take care of it.</p>
<p>We had fancy hospitals and so forth,</p>
<p>and now we have a vaccine, so we can.</p>
<p>And the vaccine is really good,</p>
<p>but there are many governments in Africa</p>
<p>that are suspicious of us,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want to use our vaccine, so they.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a vaccine for Ebola.</p>
<p>There is, yeah.</p>
<p>And the effectiveness and safety of it,</p>
<p>to how much is understood.</p>
<p>So this is difficult,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not a lot of Ebola, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a continuous, ongoing thing.</p>
<p>There are sporadic outbreaks here and there.</p>
<p>Of a few thousand people.</p>
<p>At most, at most, usually a few hundred.</p>
<p>And the biggest ever, in fact,</p>
<p>this is why we didn&rsquo;t for years have an Ebola vaccine.</p>
<p>The U.S. military, together with Canada,</p>
<p>developed an Ebola vaccine for service people, right?</p>
<p>They wanted to say, well, we&rsquo;re sending people</p>
<p>into these Ebola areas, we want a vaccine for them.</p>
<p>So they had developed it through all the preclinical,</p>
<p>which means before it goes into people.</p>
<p>And that stopped, because there was no money</p>
<p>to do a phase one and a phase two and a phase three.</p>
<p>In fact, for phase two and three,</p>
<p>you need to have infections going on,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re looking at how well</p>
<p>the vaccine prevents infections, right?</p>
<p>So then there was a West African outbreak in 2015.</p>
<p>2013, 2015.</p>
<p>The most cases ever, 25,000.</p>
<p>So they got to test the vaccine.</p>
<p>But they only put it in a few thousand people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s been in hundreds of thousands of people</p>
<p>like the COVID vaccines has been.</p>
<p>So it looks like it has high efficacy.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;d like to have more data.</p>
<p>Side effects maybe are not so great.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different available vaccines.</p>
<p>Some have been tested more than others.</p>
<p>I would say this would probably not be widely accepted</p>
<p>in the US.</p>
<p>But then neither would be something over 50%</p>
<p>deadliness of a virus.</p>
<p>No, I think if you were, in fact, many physicians</p>
<p>work in countries that have Ebola,</p>
<p>so they get vaccinated, because they understand the choice.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, it&rsquo;s always about the choice.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So then one more thing.</p>
<p>To answer the interesting,</p>
<p>what are some of the viruses you really are fascinated by?</p>
<p>There are a number of viruses that have clearly been shown</p>
<p>to alter host behavior, and that&rsquo;s how they spread.</p>
<p>I think those are fascinating.</p>
<p>For example, there are some viruses of plants</p>
<p>that are spread by aphids.</p>
<p>And the aphid bites the plant,</p>
<p>the virus reproduces in the plant,</p>
<p>and it somehow engineers the plant</p>
<p>to give off volatile organics to attract more aphids,</p>
<p>which will spread the virus.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that amazing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s altering the behavior.</p>
<p>Altering because somehow the virus infecting the plant cells</p>
<p>gives off these organics and attracts aphids.</p>
<p>And furthermore, somehow when the aphid bites,</p>
<p>it tastes horrible.</p>
<p>So they immediately leave with the virus</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve just picked up and go to another plant to spread it.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re attracted and then repulsed at the same time.</p>
<p>And obviously you don&rsquo;t want to anthropomorphize this</p>
<p>like a strategy they&rsquo;re taking on.</p>
<p>Somehow this worked out.</p>
<p>It worked out this way.</p>
<p>It just evolved.</p>
<p>And you know, evolution is sometimes hard to trace, right?</p>
<p>Like Darwin famously said,</p>
<p>he could never figure out how an eye evolved</p>
<p>from a single cell, right?</p>
<p>But it did.</p>
<p>The more complicated, complex the holistic organism is</p>
<p>that the virus invades,</p>
<p>the less able it is to control that organism, right?</p>
<p>So I wonder if there&rsquo;s viruses</p>
<p>that can control human behavior,</p>
<p>you know, to induce more spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t see why not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not enough humans</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s supposed to like evolve through.</p>
<p>Well, we can&rsquo;t do the experiment to test it, right?</p>
<p>We have to observe.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always hard when you&rsquo;re observing</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many things that can confound</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>Yeah, change human behavior, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many things that impinge on our behavior,</p>
<p>but yeah, I think it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s highly possible.</p>
<p>If it does it in a plant,</p>
<p>why not change some other organism&rsquo;s behavior?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Anyway, those fascinate me.</p>
<p>There are lots of examples of those that are fascinating</p>
<p>and how they work, people are trying to figure out.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s not a lot of money to work on, you know,</p>
<p>insect and plant viruses unless you&rsquo;re going to the USDA.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t get a lot of work moving forward.</p>
<p>Well, is there, if you understand some of those viruses,</p>
<p>is that transferable to human viruses, that understanding?</p>
<p>I think some of it could be, sure.</p>
<p>I think the general principles, for example,</p>
<p>how does the virus cause volatile organics to be made?</p>
<p>It must be turning on some genes</p>
<p>and you could learn principles from that,</p>
<p>how the virus might do that.</p>
<p>Sure, I think everything is broadly applicable.</p>
<p>So to say it&rsquo;s not useful to study viruses of insects</p>
<p>and plants is just wrong because in science,</p>
<p>we probably know this, maybe in your field it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re curious, you&rsquo;re going to run into interesting</p>
<p>things that you never planned on, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people like, you can criticize,</p>
<p>why do we want to go on Mars?</p>
<p>Why do we want to colonize Mars?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like, why do you want to go to the moon?</p>
<p>The reality is when you do really difficult things,</p>
<p>engineering things, like all these inventions</p>
<p>along the way are created.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>Basically just pick a thing that everyone can agree</p>
<p>is kind of cool and is really hard and do that.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll have like thousands of inventions</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with the thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think you should let curious scientists</p>
<p>just follow what they&rsquo;re interested in</p>
<p>to a certain extent.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, in science we say we have translational research</p>
<p>where we say, okay, here&rsquo;s some money,</p>
<p>go cure cancer or diabetes or heart disease, whatever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But that often doesn&rsquo;t work out very well.</p>
<p>What works better is to say, you have a good lab,</p>
<p>you have a good track record,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s some money, here&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where PCR, CRISPR, recombinant DNA,</p>
<p>all that stuff which has made the field explode,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all it came from.</p>
<p>Not from people saying, I want to cure genetic diseases</p>
<p>by gene editing, but by saying,</p>
<p>what are these repeated things in this bacterium doing?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a big philosophical question?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s these deadly viruses</p>
<p>that are not very transmissible, Ebola, rabies.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s these less deadly viruses</p>
<p>that are very transmissible, like COVID,</p>
<p>I guess kind of borderline.</p>
<p>But why isn&rsquo;t there super transmissible,</p>
<p>super deadly viruses?</p>
<p>I think if you compare SARS one and two,</p>
<p>you get somewhat of an answer, right?</p>
<p>SARS one was more deadly.</p>
<p>In fact, over half of the time when people were infected,</p>
<p>they ended up in the hospital because they were that sick.</p>
<p>And then the peak of virus shedding from them</p>
<p>happened long after they went in the hospital.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easy to contain the infection</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in a hospital, right?</p>
<p>There was not much pre symptomatic</p>
<p>or asymptomatic shedding with SARS one.</p>
<p>And shedding means you become infectious.</p>
<p>So in a respiratory virus,</p>
<p>you inhale the droplets with the virus</p>
<p>and they reproduce in your upper respiratory tract,</p>
<p>what we call the nasopharynx, right?</p>
<p>The nose and going back to that little cavity</p>
<p>just above your mouth.</p>
<p>So the virus reproduces really well.</p>
<p>And then as you talk and sneeze and cough,</p>
<p>you expel droplets and then those are inhaled</p>
<p>by other people and then they reproduce.</p>
<p>And for SARS two, we now know there&rsquo;s a lot of reproduction</p>
<p>just before you feel anything, if at all.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of shedding and transmission</p>
<p>before you get symptomatic.</p>
<p>And as many people don&rsquo;t ever get symptomatic, right?</p>
<p>So they spread really easily.</p>
<p>So that explains why some viruses can transmit</p>
<p>a lot better than others.</p>
<p>And if one happens to knock you out,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re never gonna transmit</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re in the hospital like SARS one.</p>
<p>But why can&rsquo;t you have both?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you just wait a while before it knocks you out</p>
<p>but when it knocks you out, it really kills you?</p>
<p>That is a philosophical question, right?</p>
<p>Because we could talk about why we haven&rsquo;t observed it.</p>
<p>I mean, one issue is that if you&rsquo;re killed too quickly</p>
<p>by a highly lethal virus,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna transmit it very well, right?</p>
<p>So Ebola can kill you quite rapidly.</p>
<p>And most of the transmission occurs when people</p>
<p>are being cared for at home or in hospitals.</p>
<p>The doctors and nurses get the virus,</p>
<p>but people walking around, you&rsquo;re not walking around</p>
<p>when you have Ebola, you&rsquo;re too sick.</p>
<p>You know, you have black, bloody diarrhea,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re vomiting, you&rsquo;re bleeding from your skin</p>
<p>and mucous membranes, you&rsquo;re not walking around,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to parties.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s part of it,</p>
<p>that if the infection is too lethal,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re simply not a good transmitter.</p>
<p>And I think transmission is probably one</p>
<p>of the most powerful selection forces for viruses</p>
<p>because a virus always has to find a new host.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a startup that fails, right?</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t find a new host, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And so anything that makes the virus transmit better</p>
<p>is gonna help it.</p>
<p>And if killing you, being less lethal is part of that,</p>
<p>that works too.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a strong selection pressure</p>
<p>against being lethal.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a strong selection pressure</p>
<p>against being lethal and being more transmissible.</p>
<p>Those two seem to work in opposite ways.</p>
<p>And now we don&rsquo;t have a lot of data to support this.</p>
<p>This is kind of a thought experiment,</p>
<p>but there is one experiment done in Australia</p>
<p>many years ago.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know this, but in the 1800s,</p>
<p>the hunters in Australia imported a rabbit from Europe</p>
<p>so they could hunt it because the native rabbit</p>
<p>in Australia was too fast for them.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t shoot them.</p>
<p>So they brought in this European rabbit</p>
<p>and they reproduced out of control.</p>
<p>Within a couple of years, they were everywhere,</p>
<p>millions of rabbits in all the watering holes.</p>
<p>And now they had a problem.</p>
<p>So they decided to use a virus</p>
<p>to get rid of these excess rabbits.</p>
<p>And they used a virus, a pox virus called myxoma virus,</p>
<p>which is a natural virus of a different kind of rabbit.</p>
<p>But for these European rabbits, it was quite lethal</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s spread by mosquitoes.</p>
<p>So they said, okay, let&rsquo;s release this virus.</p>
<p>And the first year, 99.2% of the rabbits were killed,</p>
<p>but that 0.8% that were left had some form of resistance.</p>
<p>They were variants.</p>
<p>Every organism, not just viruses, makes mutants.</p>
<p>And there were some variants of the rabbits</p>
<p>that could survive infection.</p>
<p>And then in subsequent years, the virus became less lethal.</p>
<p>And then the mosquitoes had a better shot</p>
<p>of transmitting it from one rabbit to another</p>
<p>if the rabbit lived longer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the selection probably.</p>
<p>And so in the end, the rabbits lived on.</p>
<p>The virus was there.</p>
<p>It evolved to be more transmissible and less lethal.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the only.</p>
<p>Life is amazing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only data. Life on Earth is amazing.</p>
<p>It is, it is.</p>
<p>If you take the time to look at it and see what&rsquo;s happened,</p>
<p>it is amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also humbling that it just makes you realize</p>
<p>humans are just a small part of the picture.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re wrecking it, aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we&rsquo;re not really.</p>
<p>I mean, viruses are wrecking it some ways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not really wrecking anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all part of it.</p>
<p>But you know, when the ways that humans exist</p>
<p>encourages viruses to infect us, right?</p>
<p>When we were hunter gatherers,</p>
<p>living in bands of 100 people, very few viruses</p>
<p>because it was hard for the virus to go</p>
<p>from one band to another.</p>
<p>And perhaps a hunter would, one of these humans</p>
<p>would get an animal and bring a virus into camp</p>
<p>and some people would die,</p>
<p>but it would never spread to another.</p>
<p>And then when we started to congregate in cities,</p>
<p>we figured out agriculture and so forth</p>
<p>and how to harvest animals,</p>
<p>then we could get bigger and bigger populations</p>
<p>and the viruses went crazy.</p>
<p>And they went from animals to us.</p>
<p>So measles went from cows to humans</p>
<p>when humans learned to domesticate cows</p>
<p>and started gathering in big cities.</p>
<p>Yeah, but now that humans are able to communicate</p>
<p>and travel globally,</p>
<p>the viruses become more and more dangerous, transmissible.</p>
<p>Thereby, if you look at earth as an organism,</p>
<p>thereby pushing humans to be more innovative,</p>
<p>create alpha fold two and three and four and five,</p>
<p>create better systems and eventually there&rsquo;s rockets</p>
<p>that keep flying from earth.</p>
<p>And eventually the virus is becoming super dangerous</p>
<p>and threatening all of human civilization,</p>
<p>will force it to become a multi planetary species</p>
<p>and its organism starts expanding.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, I think that we have our early,</p>
<p>probably the most of the,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re studying viruses since 1900, right?</p>
<p>Most of that time was because of diseases they caused.</p>
<p>The first viruses discovered, yellow fever,</p>
<p>virus, smallpox, polio virus, influenza virus,</p>
<p>those were all because people got sick and they said,</p>
<p>oh, look, this is a virus that&rsquo;s associated with it.</p>
<p>And so we got good at learning how to take care</p>
<p>of these infections, making vaccines and so forth</p>
<p>over the years and it&rsquo;s only in the last 20 years</p>
<p>that we recognize that there are more viruses out there</p>
<p>that are far more interesting, perhaps,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve learned how to deal with the bad ones for sure.</p>
<p>So we talked about what is a virus.</p>
<p>We talked about some of the most dangerous</p>
<p>and deadly viruses.</p>
<p>Can we zoom in and talk about COVID 19 virus?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what your preferred name is, but maybe for this.</p>
<p>Right, the virus is SARS CoV2, which is hard, it&rsquo;s long,</p>
<p>and then COVID 19 is the disease.</p>
<p>So you could say the virus of COVID 19, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>The virus of COVID 19.</p>
<p>But for the purpose of this conversation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll every once in a while just say COVID.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine, no problem.</p>
<p>What is this virus from,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many ways we can talk about it.</p>
<p>I think from a basic structural,</p>
<p>like the variant structure,</p>
<p>biological structure perspective, what is it?</p>
<p>What are its variants?</p>
<p>Can you describe the basics,</p>
<p>the important characteristics of the virus?</p>
<p>So viruses are classified by humans</p>
<p>just to make it easier to keep track of them, right?</p>
<p>So this is a coronavirus, which is because</p>
<p>when they were first discovered,</p>
<p>I think the first ones were animal coronaviruses.</p>
<p>They looked at them in the electron microscope</p>
<p>and it looked like the solar corona,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all there is to it.</p>
<p>And I have to say that early in the outbreak,</p>
<p>the place with the highest seropositivity in the US,</p>
<p>for a while, 68% was a working class neighborhood</p>
<p>in New York City called corona.</p>
<p>Can you beat that, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy, yeah.</p>
<p>So coronaviruses, they have membranes, right?</p>
<p>We talked about membranes,</p>
<p>they have spike proteins in the membrane,</p>
<p>so they can attach to cells.</p>
<p>And inside, they have RNA.</p>
<p>And they are the viruses with the longest RNA</p>
<p>that we know of.</p>
<p>None other comes close.</p>
<p>For some reason, they&rsquo;re able to maintain 30,000,</p>
<p>so SARS, COVID, two RNAs, 30,000 bases of RNA,</p>
<p>and some of the other coronas are even longer, 40,000.</p>
<p>This is a, coronas are family of viruses</p>
<p>that included the one you mentioned before, version one.</p>
<p>So SARS, COVID one, yeah.</p>
<p>COVID one, and I guess other ones as well.</p>
<p>So the first, we first learned of them in animals,</p>
<p>a lot of animals, pigs, and cows,</p>
<p>and horses have coronaviruses.</p>
<p>And then in the 60s, we discovered</p>
<p>a couple of human coronaviruses that just cause colds,</p>
<p>very mild colds that you wouldn&rsquo;t even think twice about.</p>
<p>And then suddenly, in 2003, there&rsquo;s this outbreak</p>
<p>of severe respiratory disease in China.</p>
<p>And it started in November,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t tell the world until February.</p>
<p>And that was really bad, because it was already spreading</p>
<p>by the time they told people about it.</p>
<p>But this went to 29 different countries.</p>
<p>Only 8,000 people were infected, and then it stopped.</p>
<p>And that was the first time we saw an epidemic coronavirus.</p>
<p>And what they did afterwards is they said,</p>
<p>okay, it looks like it came from the meat markets.</p>
<p>They have live meat markets in Guangzhou,</p>
<p>in the south of China, where you can go</p>
<p>and pick out an animal and the guy will slaughter it for you</p>
<p>and give it to you, and then of course,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s blood everywhere, and that&rsquo;s how they got infected.</p>
<p>And they figured out that there&rsquo;s this animal</p>
<p>called a palm civet, that was the source of virus.</p>
<p>The palm civets are shipped in from the countryside,</p>
<p>and the palm civets somehow in the countryside</p>
<p>got it from a bat.</p>
<p>So they went looking in caves in the countryside,</p>
<p>and they found in one cave all the viruses</p>
<p>that could make up SARS 1.</p>
<p>And that was 2000, and I would say,</p>
<p>took about five, eight years after that outbreak.</p>
<p>So that was the first hint that bats have coronaviruses</p>
<p>that can infect people and cause problems, right?</p>
<p>And after that, we should have been ready.</p>
<p>So didn&rsquo;t they already start developing</p>
<p>vaccines after then? Yes.</p>
<p>So some people started making vaccines.</p>
<p>They tested them in mice, but they never got into people.</p>
<p>And some people started working on antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>Nothing ever came of them because, you know,</p>
<p>industry, there&rsquo;s no disease, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Why should we make vaccines and drugs?</p>
<p>And NIH in the US, you submit a grant,</p>
<p>and they say, ah, it&rsquo;s too risky.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s none of this virus around.</p>
<p>So people were really shortsighted because I always say,</p>
<p>we could have had antivirals for this, absolutely, for sure.</p>
<p>No question.</p>
<p>In fact, the one antiviral that&rsquo;s in phase three,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called molnupiravir.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only one that you can take orally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pill.</p>
<p>It looks really good.</p>
<p>That was developed five years ago,</p>
<p>but never taken into humans.</p>
<p>It could have been ready.</p>
<p>So we dropped the ball, and then the next decade, 2012,</p>
<p>MERS coronavirus comes up in the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>This comes from camels and infects people,</p>
<p>but probably the camels got it from bats originally</p>
<p>some time ago.</p>
<p>But that never transmits from person to person, very rarely.</p>
<p>Every new little outbreak is a new infection from a camel.</p>
<p>So that was 2012, and now here we are, 2019,</p>
<p>the new outbreak of respiratory disease in China.</p>
<p>And this one really goes all over the world</p>
<p>where SARS1 could not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a coronavirus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different enough from SARS1</p>
<p>that it has very different properties.</p>
<p>Causes a lot.</p>
<p>But it still has a membrane.</p>
<p>It still has a very long RNA in the middle,</p>
<p>and then it still has the spike proteins.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>What are the things that are,</p>
<p>what are the little unique things</p>
<p>that make it that much more effective?</p>
<p>That make it cause a pandemic of millions of people</p>
<p>as opposed to SARS1?</p>
<p>Well, the genome is 20% different from SARS1, say.</p>
<p>And in those bases, there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>there are things that make it different from SARS1.</p>
<p>It binds the same receptor, ACE2, on the cell surface.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s remarkable.</p>
<p>It has a lot of the same proteins.</p>
<p>They look similar.</p>
<p>Like if you look at the structure of the spikes,</p>
<p>they look similar,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s enough amino acid differences</p>
<p>to make the bio.</p>
<p>And what it is, we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>because how do you figure that out?</p>
<p>You need to study animals,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t infect people.</p>
<p>And the animal models aren&rsquo;t great.</p>
<p>So the way you figure that out</p>
<p>is you figure out how those differences,</p>
<p>what functional,</p>
<p>like how the difference in the amino acids</p>
<p>lead to functional difference of the virus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Like how it attaches, how it breaks the cell wall.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And how the hell do you figure that out?</p>
<p>Like, I guess there&rsquo;s models of interaction.</p>
<p>First, you need an animal of some kind to infect, right?</p>
<p>You can use mice.</p>
<p>People have used ferrets, guinea pigs,</p>
<p>nonhuman primates,</p>
<p>all of the above.</p>
<p>Nonhuman primates are very expensive,</p>
<p>so not many people do that.</p>
<p>And then you can put the virus in the respiratory tract.</p>
<p>But in fact, none of them get sick like people do.</p>
<p>Many people with COVID get a mild disease,</p>
<p>but 20% get a very severe, longer lasting disease.</p>
<p>They can die from it, right?</p>
<p>No animal does that yet.</p>
<p>So we have no insight into what&rsquo;s controlling that.</p>
<p>But if you just wanna look at the very first part</p>
<p>of infection and the shedding and the transmission,</p>
<p>you can do it in any one of several animal models.</p>
<p>Ferrets are really good for transmission.</p>
<p>They tend to have nasal structures like humans</p>
<p>and you can put them in cages next to each other</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll transmit the virus really nicely.</p>
<p>So you can study that.</p>
<p>But the other thing that&rsquo;s important that we should mention</p>
<p>is how do you manipulate these viruses?</p>
<p>So these are RNA viruses.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t manipulate RNA.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how to do it.</p>
<p>But DNA, because of the recombinant DNA revolution</p>
<p>that occurred in the 70s,</p>
<p>we can change DNA any way we want.</p>
<p>We can change a single base, we can cut out bases,</p>
<p>we can put other things in really easily.</p>
<p>And if I may give it a personal aspect,</p>
<p>when I went to MIT as a postdoc in 1979,</p>
<p>David Baltimore said, here&rsquo;s what I want you to do.</p>
<p>The moratorium on recombinant DNA experiments</p>
<p>on viruses has just been lifted.</p>
<p>I want you to make a DNA copy of polio</p>
<p>and see if you put that in a cell</p>
<p>whether it will start an infection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So I made a DNA copy of polio virus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only 7,500 bases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much smaller than corona.</p>
<p>And I took that DNA and I put it in a piece of DNA</p>
<p>from a bacteria called a plasmid.</p>
<p>And you can grow plasmids in many, many bacteria,</p>
<p>make lots of them and purify the DNA really easily.</p>
<p>And I took that DNA and I sequenced it</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t know the genome sequence</p>
<p>of polio at the time.</p>
<p>And that took me a year by the way,</p>
<p>because the techniques we had were really archaic</p>
<p>and nowadays you could do it in 15 minutes, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And I took the DNA, I put it into cells and out came polio.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the start.</p>
<p>Now, since then everybody has taken that technique</p>
<p>and used it for their virus.</p>
<p>You can now do it with SARS CoV2.</p>
<p>You make a DNA copy of any RNA virus,</p>
<p>you can modify it and you put it back into cells</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get your modified virus out.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an important part of understanding</p>
<p>the properties of the virus as, say, in an animal.</p>
<p>By changing the virus, you&rsquo;re changing a DNA copy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making the virus then and putting it into the animal.</p>
<p>Can you clarify, so even in the RNA virus,</p>
<p>you can take and turn it into DNA?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then that allows you to modify it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mapping?</p>
<p>Well, no, no, no, what&rsquo;s the process</p>
<p>of going from RNA to DNA?</p>
<p>Reverse transcription.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s reverse transcription.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Oh, so you actually go through the process</p>
<p>of reverse transcription to do this?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Remember, David Baltimore and Howard had discovered</p>
<p>this enzyme in the 70s.</p>
<p>They got the Nobel Prize for that.</p>
<p>And when I went to David&rsquo;s lab at MIT,</p>
<p>he had the enzyme in the freezer.</p>
<p>He said, here, take this and make a DNA copy of polio.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t make the connection</p>
<p>that you can use that kind of thing for an RNA virus.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And then modify it.</p>
<p>See, any DNA virus already exists as DNA.</p>
<p>So you can modify it.</p>
<p>But for RNA viruses, it was difficult.</p>
<p>And so then from that point on, for influenza,</p>
<p>every other RNA virus and coronaviruses,</p>
<p>people made DNA copies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what they use to modify</p>
<p>and ask questions about what things are doing, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this gene doing?</p>
<p>What if we take it out?</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Can you do the same thing with COVID?</p>
<p>Is take the RNA and then.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And in fact, in January 2020,</p>
<p>as soon as the genome sequence was released from China,</p>
<p>the labs all over were synthesizing this 30,000 base DNA</p>
<p>and getting virus.</p>
<p>What can you figure out without infecting anything?</p>
<p>Just turning into, with the reverse transcription,</p>
<p>turning into DNA, modifying stuff,</p>
<p>and then putting it into a cell.</p>
<p>What can you figure out from that?</p>
<p>Oh, well, you could, let&rsquo;s say you can cut out a gene.</p>
<p>You see some genes in the sequence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what these genes do.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s cut them out.</p>
<p>And then you could cut them out of the DNA.</p>
<p>You put the DNA in cells and maybe you get virus out.</p>
<p>And you go, oh, clearly that gene&rsquo;s not needed</p>
<p>for the virus to reproduce, at least in cells, right?</p>
<p>Or maybe you take the gene out</p>
<p>and you never get any virus, so it&rsquo;s lethal.</p>
<p>Is there a nice systematic ways of doing this?</p>
<p>Do people kind of automate it?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And we, I mean, the problem with SARS, the COVID virus,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s 30,000 bases, a lot of stuff there.</p>
<p>And what makes it more difficult is that you have to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been classified as a BSL3 agent, biosafety level three.</p>
<p>And so not everyone has a lab that&rsquo;s capable of doing that.</p>
<p>So it limits the number of people who can do experiments.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re lucky to have a few in New York City,</p>
<p>but not every place has them.</p>
<p>So you cannot work with a virus just out on the bench</p>
<p>like we do with many other viruses.</p>
<p>You have to wear a suit and have to have special procedures</p>
<p>and containment and so forth.</p>
<p>So it makes it difficult to do basic experiments</p>
<p>on the virus.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s a pandemic, there&rsquo;s a lot of money,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of incentive to work on it harder.</p>
<p>And also you don&rsquo;t need to work on the virus.</p>
<p>You can take bits of it and work.</p>
<p>You could take, say, just the spike, right?</p>
<p>And say, can we make a vaccine with just the spike?</p>
<p>Because that doesn&rsquo;t require BSL3, so yes.</p>
<p>So like building a vaccine requires you to figure out</p>
<p>how, or antiviral drugs, how to attack various structural</p>
<p>parts of the virus and the functional parts of the virus.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You have to decide on a target.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m gonna make an antiviral,</p>
<p>what am I gonna target in the virus?</p>
<p>And there are a few things that make more sense than others.</p>
<p>Usually we like to target enzymes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember your biochemistry,</p>
<p>but enzymes are catalytic.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a lot of them to do a lot of things.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re typically in low concentrations</p>
<p>in a virus infected cell.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easier to inhibit them with a drug.</p>
<p>And the coronas have a couple of enzymes that we can target.</p>
<p>So you have to figure that out ahead of time</p>
<p>and decide what to go after.</p>
<p>And then you can look for drugs that inhibit</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that hard to do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just something beautiful about biology,</p>
<p>about the mechanisms of biology.</p>
<p>And I kind of regret falling in love</p>
<p>with computer science so much</p>
<p>that I left that biology textbook on the show</p>
<p>and left it behind.</p>
<p>But hopefully we&rsquo;ll return to it now</p>
<p>because I think one of the things you learn</p>
<p>even in computer science that studying biology</p>
<p>and certainly neurobiology,</p>
<p>you get inspired.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a mechanism of incredible complexity</p>
<p>that works really well, is very robust,</p>
<p>is very effective, efficient.</p>
<p>It inspires you to come up with techniques</p>
<p>that you can engineer in the machine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what drives a field forward</p>
<p>when people improvise and come up with new technologies</p>
<p>that really make a difference.</p>
<p>And we have a bunch of those now.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between the coronavirus family</p>
<p>and the other popular family, influenza virus family?</p>
<p>I mean, if I were, because you mentioned</p>
<p>we should have done a lot more</p>
<p>in terms of vaccine development,</p>
<p>that kind of thing for coronaviruses.</p>
<p>But if I were back then, from my understanding,</p>
<p>the thing we should all be afraid of is influenza,</p>
<p>like some strong variants coming out from that family.</p>
<p>That seems like the one that will destroy human civilization</p>
<p>or hurt us really badly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you agree with this sense,</p>
<p>but maybe you can also just clarify</p>
<p>what to use as the difference between the families.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting difference.</p>
<p>They both have membranes, right?</p>
<p>So then they have spike proteins embedded in them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re different spikes.</p>
<p>In fact, for influenza, there are two main ones.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called the HA and the NA.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s inside is RNA,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very different RNA.</p>
<p>And here we have to explain that.</p>
<p>So viruses with RNA can have three different kinds of RNA.</p>
<p>They can have what we call plus RNA.</p>
<p>They can have minus RNA,</p>
<p>or they could have plus minus,</p>
<p>actually two strands hybridized together.</p>
<p>The plus RNA simply means that</p>
<p>if you put that plus RNA in a cell,</p>
<p>you know, your cell has ribosomes in it</p>
<p>that make the proteins that you need.</p>
<p>The ribosomes will immediately latch onto the plus RNA</p>
<p>and begin to make proteins.</p>
<p>A minus RNA is not the right strand to make proteins.</p>
<p>So it has to be copied first.</p>
<p>And then the plus minus is both together.</p>
<p>So the SARS coronaviruses,</p>
<p>all the coronaviruses have plus RNA.</p>
<p>So as soon as that RNA gets in the cell,</p>
<p>boom, it starts an infectious cycle.</p>
<p>Same thing with poliovirus, by the way, which I worked on.</p>
<p>Influenza viruses are negative stranded.</p>
<p>So they cannot be translated when they get in the cell.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s tough for the virus</p>
<p>because the cell actually cannot make plus RNA</p>
<p>from minus RNA.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have the enzyme to do it.</p>
<p>So the virus has to carry it in inside the virus particle.</p>
<p>And then when the minus RNA is in the cell,</p>
<p>the virus enzyme makes plus RNAs and those get translated.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a big difference.</p>
<p>And then in the influenza viruses,</p>
<p>not only is it minus RNA, but it&rsquo;s in pieces.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in eight pieces.</p>
<p>We call that segmented,</p>
<p>whereas the corona is in one long piece of RNA.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re like floating separately?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the genes are on separate pieces.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all packaged inside that virus particle</p>
<p>of influenza virus, but they&rsquo;re in pieces.</p>
<p>And why that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>is because if two different influenza viruses</p>
<p>infect the same cell,</p>
<p>the pieces as they reproduce can mix</p>
<p>and out can come a virus with a new assortment of pieces.</p>
<p>And that allows influenza virus</p>
<p>to undergo extremely high frequency evolution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we get pandemics.</p>
<p>When we have a new flu pandemics</p>
<p>is because somewhere in some animal,</p>
<p>two viruses have reassorted</p>
<p>and made a new virus that we hadn&rsquo;t seen before.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about kind of biological characteristics,</p>
<p>but what am I incorrect in my intuition</p>
<p>that are from the things I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>that the influenza family viruses is more dangerous?</p>
<p>Like what makes it more dangerous to humans?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on the,</p>
<p>there are many flavors or vintages of influenza virus.</p>
<p>Some are dangerous and some are not, right?</p>
<p>It depends on which one.</p>
<p>Some like the 1918 apparently was very lethal,</p>
<p>killed a lot of people.</p>
<p>But more contemporary viruses,</p>
<p>we had a pandemic in 2009 of influenza.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t such a lethal virus.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly why,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t kill that many people.</p>
<p>It transmitted pretty well.</p>
<p>Is that the bird flu one?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all deriving.</p>
<p>That one was called swine influenza.</p>
<p>Swine, that&rsquo;s right, swine, yeah.</p>
<p>It seemed to have started in a pig,</p>
<p>but it had bird, it had RNAs from bird influenza viruses.</p>
<p>These viruses are all reassortants of different viruses</p>
<p>from pigs and birds and humans.</p>
<p>But influenza can cause pneumonia</p>
<p>and can kill you as does SARS COVID too.</p>
<p>So it depends on the virus.</p>
<p>So there is another influenza virus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s currently circulating.</p>
<p>So right now we have the 2009 pandemic virus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still around.</p>
<p>And then the 1968 pandemic virus,</p>
<p>which was the one before 2009,</p>
<p>that one is still around too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s more lethal.</p>
<p>And depending on the season,</p>
<p>some seasons the 2009 virus predominates,</p>
<p>some seasons the 1968.</p>
<p>And when the 68 is around, you get more lethality.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re living with an influenza family.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t exterminated them.</p>
<p>Right, we never will, never exterminate them.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because every shorebird in the world is infected with them.</p>
<p>Gulls and terns and ducks and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we develop strong vaccines that defend against?</p>
<p>Oh, we could do that, sure.</p>
<p>But that would not eliminate them from humans.</p>
<p>Even if you had the best vaccine,</p>
<p>you would never get rid of it in people</p>
<p>because there would always be someone who&rsquo;s not vaccinated</p>
<p>or in which the vaccine didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>No vaccine is 100%.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Well, you just contradicted yourself.</p>
<p>You said the perfect vaccine.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Imperfect, imperfect.</p>
<p>But then you said, like, even if you had the perfect,</p>
<p>yeah, some people wouldn&rsquo;t get vaccinated.</p>
<p>But I understand what you mean.</p>
<p>But I actually was asking how difficult is it</p>
<p>to make vaccines like that for,</p>
<p>it seems like it&rsquo;s very difficult to do that</p>
<p>for the influenza virus.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really easy to make an old school vaccine.</p>
<p>So the way the first influenza vaccines were made</p>
<p>was actually Jonas Salk worked on them in the 40s.</p>
<p>You just grow lots of virus</p>
<p>and you grow it in eggs, by the way, chicken eggs.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Literally?</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>Yeah, chicken, embryonated.</p>
<p>So they get fertilized and there&rsquo;s a 10 or 12 day embryo</p>
<p>in it and you put virus in it, it grows up</p>
<p>and then you harvest it.</p>
<p>You get about 10 mls of fluid.</p>
<p>And then you take that,</p>
<p>you treat it with formaldehyde or formalin</p>
<p>and it inactivates the virus so it&rsquo;s no longer infectious.</p>
<p>And you just inject that into people.</p>
<p>And that was the first flu vaccine.</p>
<p>It was made for the US Army actually.</p>
<p>And then it got moved over to people.</p>
<p>We still use that old school tech today.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re taking, can you help me out here?</p>
<p>Okay, so this is a good time to talk about vaccines.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking the actual virus,</p>
<p>you put it in an egg, you let it grow up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very funny that you put it in an egg.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very poetic.</p>
<p>And then how do you make it not infection,</p>
<p>not effective or whatever?</p>
<p>Not infectious.</p>
<p>Not infectious, is that the right term here?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how do you make it not infectious?</p>
<p>You can treat it with any number of chemicals</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll disrupt the particle so it no longer infects.</p>
<p>So that step of disrupting the particle</p>
<p>is that very specific to a particular variant particle?</p>
<p>No, the same collection of chemicals</p>
<p>you can use for all kinds of,</p>
<p>and which have been used for SARS CoV2 vaccines also.</p>
<p>Same technology.</p>
<p>Okay, so what are, there&rsquo;s several things to ask.</p>
<p>So you called it old school in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s slightly dismissive,</p>
<p>like people talk about Windows 98 or something.</p>
<p>So is there risks involved with it?</p>
<p>Or is it just difficult to produce large amounts?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s only, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy.</p>
<p>I mean, you could do it in cells and culture,</p>
<p>but eggs were convenient.</p>
<p>And in the 1940s, we didn&rsquo;t have cells and culture.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know how to do that.</p>
<p>So we had to use something else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to do,</p>
<p>but the process of inactivating the virus with a chemical</p>
<p>makes it not the best vaccine you can make.</p>
<p>The flu vaccines that we have today,</p>
<p>which are mostly based on this inactivation,</p>
<p>is called inactivated virus vaccines.</p>
<p>Oh, so like the kind of thing</p>
<p>it presents to the immune system to train on</p>
<p>is not close to the actual virus.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s what we think.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why probably the flu vaccines</p>
<p>are just not very good, you know?</p>
<p>60% efficiency at the best, right?</p>
<p>Which is not really good.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>What is the measure of efficiency for a vaccine?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s how it does in the general population</p>
<p>at preventing influenza.</p>
<p>At preventing?</p>
<p>Illness, not infection.</p>
<p>We usually don&rsquo;t measure infection</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re testing a vaccine.</p>
<p>We just measure sickness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really easy to score, right?</p>
<p>You do a trial and you say,</p>
<p>if you feel sick, give us a call.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll tell you what to do.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, what&rsquo;s sickness?</p>
<p>Sickness is the presence of symptoms?</p>
<p>So this is good time to say what a symptom is, okay?</p>
<p>A symptom is what you only can feel.</p>
<p>Only you can feel an upset stomach</p>
<p>or a sore throat or that sort of thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the lived experience of a symptom.</p>
<p>Whereas a sign is something that someone could measure</p>
<p>and tell that you&rsquo;re infected,</p>
<p>like virus in your nasopharynx or something else, right?</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms.</p>
<p>And so in a vaccine trial, they tell you,</p>
<p>well, if you have any of these symptoms,</p>
<p>they give you a paper with the exact symptoms listed</p>
<p>to make sure you&rsquo;re picking them up, right?</p>
<p>So for flu, it would probably be fever, sore throat, cough.</p>
<p>You call them and then they will do a PCR,</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;ve got flu and not some other virus</p>
<p>that makes similar symptoms.</p>
<p>And then they would say, are you a vaccine or non vaccine arm</p>
<p>and count up all the infections</p>
<p>and see how the vaccine did, basically.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating because the reporting,</p>
<p>so symptom is what you feel.</p>
<p>Yes, for sure.</p>
<p>And certainly the mind has a ability to conjure up feelings.</p>
<p>Oh yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>And so like culturally, maybe there was a time</p>
<p>in our culture where it was looked down upon</p>
<p>to feel sick or something like that,</p>
<p>like toughen up kind of thing.</p>
<p>And so then you probably have very few symptoms</p>
<p>being reported.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>And now is like much more, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>perhaps you&rsquo;re much more likely to report symptoms.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s fascinating because then it changes.</p>
<p>Oh, it is definitely a perception because for,</p>
<p>your symptom may be nothing to me or vice versa, right?</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re doing this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of a imprecise science because,</p>
<p>and even it&rsquo;s a cultural thing in some countries,</p>
<p>something that would make us feel horrible,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t even bother reporting.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t have any symptoms.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit imprecise and it clouds the results.</p>
<p>So if you can measure things, it&rsquo;s always better,</p>
<p>but you start out with a symptom.</p>
<p>And if you say, if someone tells you this virus,</p>
<p>20% of the people are asymptomatic,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t report symptoms,</p>
<p>that number is probably not a constant.</p>
<p>It depends where you did the study.</p>
<p>It could be different in China versus South America,</p>
<p>Europe, et cetera, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I was trying to figure,</p>
<p>so I took two shots of the Pfizer vaccine</p>
<p>and I had zero symptoms.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So, and I was wondering, well, see,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s my feelings, right?</p>
<p>This is not, because I felt fine, I was waiting.</p>
<p>Did you have pain at the injection site?</p>
<p>No, it was kind of pleasant.</p>
<p>You felt nothing the next day, no?</p>
<p>Nothing, no tiredness, no exhaustion, no.</p>
<p>But see, like I have an insane sleeping schedule.</p>
<p>I already put myself through crazy stuff.</p>
<p>That said, maybe I was expecting something really bad.</p>
<p>Like I was waiting and therefore didn&rsquo;t feel it.</p>
<p>But I also got allergy shots</p>
<p>and those, I was out all next day,</p>
<p>like exhausted for some reason.</p>
<p>So that gave me like a sense like, okay,</p>
<p>at least sometimes I can feel shitty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good to know.</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>And then with the vaccine it didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but the question is like,</p>
<p>how much does my mind come into play there?</p>
<p>The expectations of symptoms,</p>
<p>the expectations of not feeling well,</p>
<p>how does that affect the sort of the self reporting</p>
<p>of the symptoms?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s definitely a variable there,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s certainly many people that don&rsquo;t feel anything</p>
<p>after the vaccines.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some that have a whole range of things</p>
<p>like soreness and fever, et cetera, yeah.</p>
<p>So okay, you were talking about the old school development</p>
<p>inside the egg.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s better than that?</p>
<p>So then the next generation of vaccines</p>
<p>which arose in the 50s were what we call</p>
<p>replication competent, where the virus you take</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually reproducing in you.</p>
<p>Yeah, that sounds safe.</p>
<p>And it can be somewhat problematic, yes,</p>
<p>as you might imagine,</p>
<p>because once you put that virus in you,</p>
<p>you have no more control, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you have a kill switch in it,</p>
<p>which actually would be a great idea to put in.</p>
<p>Like nanobots, what can possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>No, you could just put something in there.</p>
<p>If you added a drug, you would shut it off, right?</p>
<p>And people are thinking about that</p>
<p>because now we&rsquo;re engineering viruses to treat cancers</p>
<p>and other diseases and we may wanna put kill switches</p>
<p>in them just to make sure they don&rsquo;t run away.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting, so you can deploy a drug</p>
<p>that binds to this virus that would shut it off</p>
<p>in the body, something like that.</p>
<p>Something like that, yeah, that would be the idea.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to engineer it in.</p>
<p>Anyway, these were, the first one was yellow fever vaccine</p>
<p>that was made because that was a big problem.</p>
<p>And this virus, and the way you do this,</p>
<p>back in the old day was empirical.</p>
<p>So Max Tyler, who did the yellow fever vaccine,</p>
<p>he took the virus, which is a human virus, right?</p>
<p>And he infected, I think he used chick embryos.</p>
<p>And he went from one embryo to another and just kept passing</p>
<p>and he did that hundreds of times.</p>
<p>And every 10 passages, he would take the virus</p>
<p>and put it in a mouse or a monkey, whatever his model was.</p>
<p>And then eventually he got a virus</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t cause any disease after 200 and some passages.</p>
<p>And then that was tested in people</p>
<p>and it became the yellow fever vaccine that we use today.</p>
<p>He selected for mutations that made the virus</p>
<p>not cause disease, but still make an immune response.</p>
<p>So those are called replication competent.</p>
<p>We now have the polio vaccine,</p>
<p>which was developed in the 50s after the yellow fever.</p>
<p>Then we had measles, mumps, rubella.</p>
<p>Those are all replication competent vaccines.</p>
<p>And you mentioned is that&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>They are all safe vaccines.</p>
<p>The only one that has had an issue</p>
<p>is the polio replication competent vaccine.</p>
<p>It was called Sabin vaccine or oral polio virus vaccine</p>
<p>because you take it orally, it&rsquo;s wonderful</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have to inject it.</p>
<p>This is the perfect delivery.</p>
<p>Either intranasal for a respiratory virus</p>
<p>or orally for polio goes into your intestines.</p>
<p>It reproduces and it gives you wonderful protection</p>
<p>against polio.</p>
<p>However, you do shed virus out</p>
<p>and that virus is no longer a vaccine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reverted genetically in your intestine.</p>
<p>So you can infect others with polio.</p>
<p>Take that virus and put it into an animal and give it polio.</p>
<p>And in fact, the parents of some kids in the 60s and 70s</p>
<p>who were immunized got polio from the vaccine.</p>
<p>The rate was about one and one and a half million</p>
<p>cases of polio.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s called vaccine associated polio.</p>
<p>And I always argue that</p>
<p>we may not have picked the right vaccine.</p>
<p>There was a big fight in the US and other countries</p>
<p>between the inactivated polio</p>
<p>and the infectious polio vaccines,</p>
<p>which ones we should be using</p>
<p>because we found out that the infectious vaccine</p>
<p>actually caused polio.</p>
<p>And eight to 10 kids a year in the US alone</p>
<p>got polio from the vaccine,</p>
<p>which looking back is really not acceptable in my view,</p>
<p>although the public health community said it was</p>
<p>to get rid of polio.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re close to eradicating polio globally,</p>
<p>but this vaccine derived polio is a problem.</p>
<p>So now we have to go back to the inactivated vaccine,</p>
<p>which is tough because it&rsquo;s injected.</p>
<p>So, okay, so the basic high level,</p>
<p>how vaccines work principle is</p>
<p>you want to deploy something in the body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s as close to the actual virus as possible,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t do nearly as much harm.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like a million, not a million,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a bunch of ways you could possibly do that.</p>
<p>So those are two ways.</p>
<p>And now of course we have modern ways</p>
<p>we can make mRNA vaccines, right?</p>
<p>What are the modern ways?</p>
<p>I did, you wanna look, mRNA vaccine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the, that&rsquo;s the most modern,</p>
<p>but even before mRNA vaccines,</p>
<p>we learned that we could use viruses</p>
<p>to deliver proteins from a virus that you wanna prevent.</p>
<p>And so the Ebola vaccine,</p>
<p>we took the spike gene of Ebola virus</p>
<p>and put it in a different virus</p>
<p>and we deliver that to people</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s called a vector vaccine.</p>
<p>And some of the COVID vaccines are vectors</p>
<p>of different kinds of most famous are adenovirus vectors</p>
<p>carrying the spike gene into the cell.</p>
<p>Can you explain how the vector vaccine works again?</p>
<p>So we have, we take a virus that will infect humans</p>
<p>but will not make you sick.</p>
<p>In the case of adenovirus,</p>
<p>the years and years of people studying it</p>
<p>has told us what genes you could cut out</p>
<p>and allow the virus to infect the cell</p>
<p>but not cause any disease.</p>
<p>So instead of doing selection on it,</p>
<p>you actually genetically modify it.</p>
<p>Yes, you modify the vector, yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re much more precise about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very precise</p>
<p>and then you splice in the gene for the spike</p>
<p>and then you use that to deliver the gene</p>
<p>and it becomes produced as protein</p>
<p>and then you make an immune response.</p>
<p>And vector is the term for this modified.</p>
<p>Right, so we&rsquo;re now using viruses at our bidding.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using them as vectors, not just for vaccines.</p>
<p>We can cure monogenic diseases.</p>
<p>That is if you have, if you&rsquo;re born with a genetic disease,</p>
<p>you have a deletion or a mutation in a gene,</p>
<p>single gene, we can give you the regular gene back</p>
<p>using a virus vector.</p>
<p>So cancers too, we can cure cancers with vectors.</p>
<p>Wow, really?</p>
<p>Interesting. Yeah.</p>
<p>I think in 10 to 15 years,</p>
<p>most cancers will be treatable with viruses, yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And not only can we put things in the vector</p>
<p>to kill the tumor,</p>
<p>we can target the vector to the tumor specifically</p>
<p>in a number of ways.</p>
<p>And that makes it less toxic, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t infect all your other cells.</p>
<p>But it takes time to develop a vector for a particular thing</p>
<p>because it requires a deep understanding.</p>
<p>Yeah, in fact, we have about a dozen different virus vectors</p>
<p>that have been studied for 20 years.</p>
<p>And those are the set of vaccine vectors that we&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>So it includes adenovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus,</p>
<p>which is a cousin of rabies, but doesn&rsquo;t make people sick.</p>
<p>Influenza virus is being used as a vector</p>
<p>and even measles virus.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re familiar with how to modify those to be vectors</p>
<p>and those are being used for COVID vaccines.</p>
<p>And then of course we have the newest,</p>
<p>which is the nucleic acid vaccines.</p>
<p>So years ago, people said,</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t we just inject DNA into people?</p>
<p>Take the spike and put it in a DNA and inject it.</p>
<p>So people tried many, many different vaccines.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are no human licensed vaccines</p>
<p>that are DNA vaccines.</p>
<p>Although there is a West Nile vaccine for horses</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a DNA based vaccine.</p>
<p>So if you have a horse, you can give it this vaccine,</p>
<p>but no human.</p>
<p>Can you clarify, does a DNA vaccine</p>
<p>only work for DNA viruses?</p>
<p>No, it can work for DNA or RNA.</p>
<p>Because remember, for an RNA virus,</p>
<p>we can make a DNA copy of it.</p>
<p>And it will still, when you put that DNA in a cell,</p>
<p>it goes into the nucleus.</p>
<p>Okay, right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re just skipping a step.</p>
<p>You get proteins.</p>
<p>For RNA vaccines, you&rsquo;re giving, okay, I got it.</p>
<p>So those didn&rsquo;t work for human vaccines.</p>
<p>And there were many HIV AIDS vaccine trials</p>
<p>that used DNA vaccines, didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And then a number of years ago,</p>
<p>people started thinking, how about RNA, RNA vaccines?</p>
<p>And I first heard this, I thought, what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with RNA my whole career.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fragile.</p>
<p>If you look at it the wrong way, it breaks.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s being facetious, right?</p>
<p>But you have to be very careful</p>
<p>because your hands are full of enzymes</p>
<p>that will degrade RNA.</p>
<p>So I thought, how could this possibly work,</p>
<p>injecting it into someone&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an example of I was skeptical and I was wrong.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you modify the RNA properly</p>
<p>and protect it in a lipid capsule,</p>
<p>it actually works as a vaccine.</p>
<p>And people were working on this years</p>
<p>before COVID came around.</p>
<p>They were doing experimental mRNA vaccines</p>
<p>and there were a couple of companies</p>
<p>that were working on it.</p>
<p>And so at the beginning of 2020, they said, let&rsquo;s try it.</p>
<p>And I was skeptical, frankly,</p>
<p>because I just thought RNA would be too labile,</p>
<p>but I was wrong.</p>
<p>So this is, as we&rsquo;re saying offline, one of the great things</p>
<p>about you is you&rsquo;re able to say when you&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>about intuitions you&rsquo;ve had in the past,</p>
<p>which is a beautiful thing for a scientist.</p>
<p>But I still think it&rsquo;s very surprising</p>
<p>that something like that works, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I am surprised.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just launching RNA in a protective membrane.</p>
<p>And then now one thing is surprising</p>
<p>that the RNA sort of lasts long enough in its structure.</p>
<p>But then the other thing is why does it work</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a good training ground for the immune system?</p>
<p>Is that obvious that that should work?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s obvious to most people</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s worth going into it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, they wrap the RNA in fats,</p>
<p>in lipid membranes, right?</p>
<p>And the particular formulation they test for years</p>
<p>to make sure it&rsquo;s stable,</p>
<p>it lasts a long time after it&rsquo;s injected.</p>
<p>And the two companies that make the current COVID vaccines,</p>
<p>right, Moderna and Pfizer,</p>
<p>they have different lipid formulations to get to the same.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a real part of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not simple.</p>
<p>There are quite a few different lipids</p>
<p>that they put into this coding.</p>
<p>And they test to see how long they protect the RNA</p>
<p>after it&rsquo;s injected, say, into a mouse,</p>
<p>how long does it last?</p>
<p>And the way it works is these,</p>
<p>apparently these lipid nanoparticles,</p>
<p>they get injected into your muscle,</p>
<p>they bump into cells and they get taken up.</p>
<p>So lipid fat is sticky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s greasy, we like to say.</p>
<p>And so your cells are covered with a greasy membrane also.</p>
<p>So when these lipid nanoparticles bump into them,</p>
<p>they stick and they eventually get taken up.</p>
<p>And they figured this out right at the beginning.</p>
<p>If we put RNA in a lipid nanoparticle,</p>
<p>will it get taken up into a cell?</p>
<p>And the answer was yes, it was just let&rsquo;s try it.</p>
<p>And it worked.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically experiment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like some deep understanding of biology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s experimentally speaking, it just seems to work.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, they had some idea</p>
<p>that lipids would target this to a cell membrane.</p>
<p>And remember, there&rsquo;s no receptor involved.</p>
<p>Like the virus has a specific protein</p>
<p>that attaches to a receptor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not efficient enough to just bump around</p>
<p>and get into a cell.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what these things are doing.</p>
<p>And they probably optimize the lipids</p>
<p>to get more efficient uptake.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not as efficient as a virus would be</p>
<p>to get into a cell.</p>
<p>Right, so you have no specific,</p>
<p>I mean, which is why it&rsquo;s surprising</p>
<p>that you can crack into the safe with a hammer.</p>
<p>Or with some fat.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of surprising.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of amazing that it works.</p>
<p>But so maybe let&rsquo;s try to talk about this.</p>
<p>So one of the hesitancies around vaccines</p>
<p>or basically around any new technology</p>
<p>is the fact that mRNA is a new idea.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an idea that was shrouded in some skepticism,</p>
<p>as you said, by the scientific community.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a cool new technology.</p>
<p>Surprising that it works.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition?</p>
<p>I think one nice way to approach this</p>
<p>is try to play devil&rsquo;s advocate and say both sides.</p>
<p>One side is why your intuition says</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s safe for humans.</p>
<p>And what arguments can you see if you could steal man</p>
<p>and argument why it&rsquo;s unsafe for humans.</p>
<p>Or not unsafe for humans,</p>
<p>but the hesitancy to take an mRNA vaccine is justified.</p>
<p>So many people are afraid because it&rsquo;s new technology</p>
<p>and they feel it hasn&rsquo;t been tested.</p>
<p>I mean, in theory, what could go wrong?</p>
<p>This is the nice thing about mRNA</p>
<p>is that it doesn&rsquo;t last forever.</p>
<p>As opposed to DNA, which doesn&rsquo;t last forever,</p>
<p>but it can last a lot longer.</p>
<p>And it could even go into your DNA, right?</p>
<p>So mRNA has a shorter lifetime,</p>
<p>maybe days after it&rsquo;s injected into your arm,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not gonna be around forever.</p>
<p>So that would say, okay, so it&rsquo;s sticking around</p>
<p>for your lifetime is not happening.</p>
<p>But what else could happen?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see the protein that&rsquo;s made,</p>
<p>could that be an issue?</p>
<p>And again, proteins don&rsquo;t last forever.</p>
<p>They have a finite longevity in the body.</p>
<p>And this one also lasts perhaps at the best a few weeks.</p>
<p>Now this is a protein that&rsquo;s made</p>
<p>after the RNA gets into the cell.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the lipid nanoparticles taken up into a cell</p>
<p>and the mRNA is translated and you get protein made.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a question, I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>where in the body, so because it&rsquo;s not well targeted,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s supposed to be targeted,</p>
<p>but it can go throughout the body,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the concerns.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s injected deep into your deltoid muscle,</p>
<p>right here, shoulder.</p>
<p>And the idea is not to put it in a blood vessel,</p>
<p>otherwise it would then for sure circulate everywhere.</p>
<p>So they go deep in a blood vessel and it&rsquo;s locally injected.</p>
<p>And they did, before this even went into people,</p>
<p>they did experiments in mice</p>
<p>where they gave them a thousand times higher concentrations</p>
<p>than they would ever give to people.</p>
<p>And then when you do that, it can go everywhere basically.</p>
<p>You can find these nanoparticles</p>
<p>in every tissue of the mouse.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s at a thousand fold higher concentration, right?</p>
<p>So I think at the levels that we&rsquo;re using in people,</p>
<p>most of it&rsquo;s staying in the muscle,</p>
<p>but sure, small amounts go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Could there be a lot of harm caused if it goes elsewhere?</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s say ridiculously high quantities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to understand what is the damage</p>
<p>that could be done from an RNA just floating about.</p>
<p>So the RNA itself is not gonna be a problem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the protein that is encoded in it, right?</p>
<p>This is a viral RNA which has no sequence in us,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s nothing that it could do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the protein that I would say you could ask,</p>
<p>what is that gonna do?</p>
<p>And the one property we know about the spike</p>
<p>is that it can cause fusion of cells, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the virus gets in in the beginning.</p>
<p>The spike attaches to the cell by this H2 receptor</p>
<p>and it causes the virus and the cell to fuse.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how the RNA gets out of the particle.</p>
<p>But so wait, I&rsquo;m a bit confused.</p>
<p>So with this mRNA vaccine with the lipids and the RNA,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no spike, right?</p>
<p>The mRNA codes for the spike.</p>
<p>Oh, the mRNA codes, so it creates the spike.</p>
<p>Creates a spike.</p>
<p>And so that spike could cause fusion of cells.</p>
<p>Yes, except they modified the spike so it wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>They made two amino acid changes in the spike</p>
<p>so it would not fuse.</p>
<p>So they understand enough which amino acids</p>
<p>are responsible for the fusion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>This is so cool.</p>
<p>So they could modify it.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s not gonna cause fusion, so that&rsquo;s not an issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the prefusion stabilized spike.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So the spike, when it binds ACE2,</p>
<p>that top falls off and the part of the spike</p>
<p>that causes fusion is now exposed.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t happen in this mRNA vaccine.</p>
<p>So those are the things that could have happened,</p>
<p>but I think they&rsquo;re ruled out by what we&rsquo;ve just said.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no better test</p>
<p>than putting it into people, right?</p>
<p>And doing phase one, phase two, and phase three,</p>
<p>and increasing numbers of people and asking,</p>
<p>what do we see?</p>
<p>Do we have any concerns?</p>
<p>And so now it&rsquo;s been in many millions of people</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t see most of the effects you see in a vaccine,</p>
<p>you see in the first couple of months.</p>
<p>Things like the myocarditis with some of the vaccines,</p>
<p>the clotting issues with the AstraZeneca vaccine,</p>
<p>Guillain Barre, you see those relatively quickly.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen small numbers of those occur,</p>
<p>but other things we haven&rsquo;t seen,</p>
<p>and you never say never, right?</p>
<p>Right, so I mean, this is fascinating, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I drink, I put Splenda in my coffee</p>
<p>and it has supposedly no calories,</p>
<p>but it tastes really good.</p>
<p>And despite what like rumors and blogs and so on,</p>
<p>I have not seen good medical evidence</p>
<p>that is harmful to you, but it&rsquo;s like, it tastes too good.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m thinking like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gotta be longterm consequences,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very difficult to understand</p>
<p>what the longterm consequences are.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this kind of like distant fear</p>
<p>or anxiety about it.</p>
<p>Like this thing tastes too good, it&rsquo;s too good to be true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be, there&rsquo;s no free lunch in this world.</p>
<p>This is the kind of feeling that people have</p>
<p>about the longterm effects of the vaccine,</p>
<p>that you mentioned that there&rsquo;s some intuition</p>
<p>about near term effects that you want to remove,</p>
<p>like the diffusion of cells and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but they think, okay,</p>
<p>this travels to other cells in the body,</p>
<p>this travels to neurons or that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And then what kind of effect does that have longterm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s yet to be discovered?</p>
<p>What do you make me for this vaccine,</p>
<p>but in general in science about making statements</p>
<p>about longterm negative effects?</p>
<p>Is that something that weighs heavy on you?</p>
<p>Is that something we can kind of escape</p>
<p>through just large scale experimentation</p>
<p>with animals and humans?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re really, if you&rsquo;re concerned about longterm,</p>
<p>then you have to do a longterm experiment, right?</p>
<p>And maybe you don&rsquo;t see something for 50, 60 years.</p>
<p>So if someone says to you,</p>
<p>there are no longterm effects of the COVID vaccines,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>because they haven&rsquo;t done the long experiment, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always the possibility, but you have to weigh it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always, there&rsquo;s no free lunch, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a risk benefit calculation you have to make.</p>
<p>You can have the study, it goes 50 years and then decide,</p>
<p>but I guess what you&rsquo;re doing is just like we said,</p>
<p>I forget which one, with polio, with rabies, I forget,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re weighing the side effects.</p>
<p>Yeah, polio, right.</p>
<p>The vaccine versus the effects of the virus.</p>
<p>And like both of them, you don&rsquo;t know longterm effects,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re building up intuition as you study,</p>
<p>which what are the longterm effects?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a huge number of people,</p>
<p>like that have like, I don&rsquo;t want to say experts</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t like the word,</p>
<p>but people have studied it long enough</p>
<p>to where they build up intuition.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know for sure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s basic science being done, there&rsquo;s basic studies.</p>
<p>But you start to build up an intuition of what might be</p>
<p>a problem down the line and what is not,</p>
<p>biologically speaking.</p>
<p>And so given that map, then considering the virus,</p>
<p>there seems to be a lot of evidence for COVID</p>
<p>having negative effects on all aspects of the body,</p>
<p>not just even respiratory, which is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>So the cognitive stuff is terrifying.</p>
<p>All kinds of systems evolve, yes.</p>
<p>And then you look at the same thing with the vaccine</p>
<p>and there seems to be less of that.</p>
<p>But of course you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s some kind of dormant thing that&rsquo;s just going to.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You have to make a judgment.</p>
<p>And for a lot of people they can&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t have the tools to make the judgment.</p>
<p>I totally understand that.</p>
<p>And we have let people down a few times in medicine, right?</p>
<p>And I know two very specific examples.</p>
<p>The first polio vaccine ever made,</p>
<p>the Salk vaccine was released in 1955.</p>
<p>Immediately within months,</p>
<p>a few hundred cases of paralysis in kids who got it</p>
<p>because it was not properly inactivated.</p>
<p>Now you have to understand,</p>
<p>parents were dying for a polio vaccine</p>
<p>because kids were getting paralyzed every summer,</p>
<p>30,000 kids a year.</p>
<p>And so they went and took it.</p>
<p>They took the word of the medical establishment</p>
<p>that it was safe and it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Big letdown, never going to forget something.</p>
<p>Although I think a lot of people today aren&rsquo;t aware of that.</p>
<p>I think that was a big problem that&rsquo;s everlasting.</p>
<p>Then the attenuated vaccine that we talked about,</p>
<p>the infectious causing polio.</p>
<p>Yet parents continued to bring their kids to be vaccinated</p>
<p>because they were said,</p>
<p>this is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And I have to say,</p>
<p>I was involved in several lawsuits</p>
<p>where parents of a kid who got paralyzed</p>
<p>from the polio vaccine decided to sue the manufacturer</p>
<p>and get some money for their kid.</p>
<p>And so they got mad.</p>
<p>And I think you could not&hellip;</p>
<p>The first issue could have been prevented,</p>
<p>could have been prevented by inactivating it properly.</p>
<p>I think the company just did the wrong thing.</p>
<p>The second we had evidence for,</p>
<p>and we should probably have not used that vaccine any longer,</p>
<p>but I think that destroys public confidence.</p>
<p>But those aren&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not long term.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a minority of cases.</p>
<p>This is a minority.</p>
<p>This is a very rare event, yeah.</p>
<p>But nevertheless,</p>
<p>science as an institution didn&rsquo;t make corrections</p>
<p>in that case.</p>
<p>No, they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so what do you make of that?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very unfortunate</p>
<p>that those few things can destroy trust.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that lasts till today.</p>
<p>I think today is a different era, right?</p>
<p>And most people don&rsquo;t know about those stories.</p>
<p>I tell them to you because that&rsquo;s what could happen.</p>
<p>I think it could happen today.</p>
<p>If you look at the history of the polio vaccine,</p>
<p>the US Public Health Service wanted kids to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>So they did things that probably weren&rsquo;t correct</p>
<p>to get the vaccine back online.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But they did it and they pushed it through.</p>
<p>So the question is, what do we do today?</p>
<p>So I can look at, as we just said,</p>
<p>I can look at what might happen</p>
<p>and I can make reasonable decisions</p>
<p>about the likelihood of them happening.</p>
<p>And I can also say, I don&rsquo;t wanna get COVID of any kind</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve seen how nasty it can be.</p>
<p>And I decide I&rsquo;m taking the risk,</p>
<p>whatever small of a long term effect,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take the risk.</p>
<p>My family took the risk and many other people did.</p>
<p>Of a vaccine.</p>
<p>Of getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s very small.</p>
<p>But I understand where people can&rsquo;t make that decision.</p>
<p>And that begs the question,</p>
<p>what would they need to make a decision?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re concerned about an effect in 40 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna know for 40 years.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think if I were to speak,</p>
<p>because I talked to, like I mentioned offline to Joe Rogan</p>
<p>and his podcast yesterday,</p>
<p>I talked to him all the time about this.</p>
<p>I think the concern is less about the long term effects</p>
<p>like on paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about the, like people like Anthony Fauci</p>
<p>and people at the top are simply misrepresenting the data</p>
<p>or like are not accurately being transparent.</p>
<p>Not collecting the data properly.</p>
<p>Not reporting on the data properly.</p>
<p>Not being transparent.</p>
<p>Not representing the uncertainties.</p>
<p>Not openly saying they were wrong two months ago.</p>
<p>Like in a way that&rsquo;s not like dramatic,</p>
<p>but revealing the basic process of science</p>
<p>when you have to do your best under uncertainty.</p>
<p>Just also just being inauthentic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense, especially with like a younger generation</p>
<p>now, there&rsquo;s a certain way on the internet.</p>
<p>Like the internet can smell bullshit</p>
<p>much better than previous generations could.</p>
<p>And so they see there&rsquo;s a kind of inauthenticity</p>
<p>that comes with being like representing authority.</p>
<p>Like I am a scientist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an expert.</p>
<p>I have a PhD.</p>
<p>I have four decades of work.</p>
<p>Therefore everyone should listen to me.</p>
<p>And somehow that maps to this feeling of,</p>
<p>well, what are they hiding?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re speaking from authority like this,</p>
<p>if everyone is in agreement like this,</p>
<p>that means they all have emails between each other.</p>
<p>They said, we&rsquo;re gonna tell this.</p>
<p>This is the message we&rsquo;re gonna tell the public.</p>
<p>Then what is the truth, the actual truth?</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a much bigger uncertainty.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s dead people in the basement</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re hiding from bad mRNA vaccine experiments.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re, and then the conspiracy theory</p>
<p>starts to grow naturally</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s this kind of mistrust of that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s less about kind of like a deep concern</p>
<p>about longterm effects.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a concern about longterm effects</p>
<p>if we find out that there&rsquo;s some secret stuff</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not being told.</p>
<p>It all lands on that.</p>
<p>So what the heck, I mean, so I put the blame</p>
<p>not on the data, but basically on the leaders</p>
<p>and the communicators of the science at the top.</p>
<p>Well, to that I would say all the data,</p>
<p>as far as I know, are made public.</p>
<p>So you can dive into it.</p>
<p>And I know a lot of people ask me questions</p>
<p>and I just say, it&rsquo;s right here in the data.</p>
<p>And I know a lot of people can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t dive into it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s one solution for people who are able.</p>
<p>Now you could argue, well,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;ve left data out.</p>
<p>Well, then not even I can help</p>
<p>because then they&rsquo;re hiding it from me too.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s highly unlikely.</p>
<p>I think for the most part,</p>
<p>the FDA requires the release</p>
<p>of all the clinical trial data, right?</p>
<p>So, okay, so this clinical trial data, that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the data that we should be focusing on, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of different data sets here.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s preclinical data,</p>
<p>which is everything that was done in the lab</p>
<p>before this vaccine ever went into a human arm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the cell culture work</p>
<p>that we talked about a little, experiments in animals.</p>
<p>All of that is publicly accessible.</p>
<p>Most of it gets published.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the initial drug filing,</p>
<p>which is huge, the books of,</p>
<p>you can get that and look at it, right?</p>
<p>This is me sort of asking sort of difficult questions here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of money to be made by makers of the vaccine.</p>
<p>So for these companies, and obviously there&rsquo;s a distrust</p>
<p>of those folks too.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done a lot of really good things in this world,</p>
<p>but the incentives are such</p>
<p>that you wanna sweep stuff under the rug</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not 100% pure in your ethics.</p>
<p>And how hard is it for that data to be fabricated,</p>
<p>manipulated, like what&rsquo;s your intuition</p>
<p>for the pre trial stuff?</p>
<p>I think when you start fabricating,</p>
<p>then you get inconsistencies,</p>
<p>which are pretty easy to pick up.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re talking about some large scale things</p>
<p>of this nature.</p>
<p>Because then you can look through the data very,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna, I mean, we require looking very carefully,</p>
<p>but you will see inconsistencies from one trial to another.</p>
<p>And that might ring a bell that something&rsquo;s been done.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like the moon landing thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes like going to the moon is easier than faking it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>In the sense it might be easier to do a large scale trial</p>
<p>and get an effective vaccine versus faking it.</p>
<p>But when you brought up the for profit issue,</p>
<p>I think that is always been an issue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt that having your health depend</p>
<p>on for profit industry may not be the best solution.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how else to do it.</p>
<p>People tell me I&rsquo;m a dreamer that thinking that,</p>
<p>all medicines could be nonprofit.</p>
<p>But I also think that the world should have one health</p>
<p>system that takes care of everyone, right?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s some countries that can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and other countries have an excess like us.</p>
<p>So I wish we could do that.</p>
<p>Well, the argument is the speed of which the vaccines</p>
<p>for COVID were produced would never happen</p>
<p>in a nonprofit system,</p>
<p>would never happen in a non capitalist system.</p>
<p>Oh, I could set up a vaccine production institute</p>
<p>in the US that would get the vaccines done</p>
<p>because you just need to put money into it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what made these vaccines get done money.</p>
<p>They poured billions of dollars and they got it done quickly.</p>
<p>But if I set up a nonprofit institutes of vaccines</p>
<p>throughout the US staffed with really talented people,</p>
<p>pay them well, keep them motivated,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get your vaccine.</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s the thing with capitalism is that</p>
<p>the selection of who to hire a good,</p>
<p>when you say good people,</p>
<p>capitalism has a machine that fires people</p>
<p>who are not good and selects people that are good.</p>
<p>Coming from the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>the dream of communism is similar</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re saying broadly defined.</p>
<p>It certainly doesn&rsquo;t work in the broads.</p>
<p>The question of whether it works in the healthcare space,</p>
<p>there is some aspect to the machine of capitalism</p>
<p>being the most effective way to select for good people</p>
<p>and to effectively produce the thing.</p>
<p>But then of course, a lot of people would argue</p>
<p>the current, even the current healthcare is not</p>
<p>with like regulations, there&rsquo;s some weird mix</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunities for inefficiencies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of opportunities for bureaucracy.</p>
<p>So you have like the worst of all worlds.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t there be some intermediate that works</p>
<p>because I mean, the other issue that we haven&rsquo;t mentioned</p>
<p>is that politics gets thrown into this</p>
<p>and that really messes up</p>
<p>and it should never be mixed with healthcare,</p>
<p>but it is because a lot of funding comes from the government</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s another confounding factor.</p>
<p>But I really think I could make a vaccine institute</p>
<p>that if someone didn&rsquo;t do well, I&rsquo;d fire them.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not gonna stay if you can&rsquo;t do your job</p>
<p>and do it well, you don&rsquo;t give them incentives,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the two extremes I think.</p>
<p>There has to be a solution that people don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>this mistrust for a company making huge profits</p>
<p>off of a drug.</p>
<p>But you know what, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>it seems that vaccines and antivirals bear the brunt</p>
<p>of this criticism yet there are many other pharmaceuticals</p>
<p>that people rely on of all sorts.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t seem to question and have issues</p>
<p>with those and they have far more side effects than vaccines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very strange how we&rsquo;re picking that way,</p>
<p>but I should also say that if you have one big</p>
<p>vaccine institute, one of the other sets</p>
<p>of vaccine conspiracies, I mean, I would say they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a little farther out into the wild side of ideas,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s one way to control the populace</p>
<p>is by injecting substances into them, right?</p>
<p>People, I mean, part of that, funny enough,</p>
<p>it probably has to do with needles</p>
<p>versus something you put in your mouth,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about the government,</p>
<p>especially when it&rsquo;s government mandated injection</p>
<p>of a substance into you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what the science says,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s 100% effective, 100% safe,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a natural distrust of what,</p>
<p>like even if this is effective and safe,</p>
<p>giving the government power to do this,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t they gonna start getting ideas down the line for,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>I think that they can barely govern.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re gonna do that,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to take, unless you&rsquo;re a federal employee,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to take a COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that largely has to do, not largely,</p>
<p>but there is an individualistic spirit</p>
<p>to the American people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this, like, you&rsquo;re not gonna take my gun away</p>
<p>from me, you&rsquo;re not going, and I think that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that makes America what it is.</p>
<p>Just coming from the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a power to sort of resisting</p>
<p>the overreach of government.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite interesting, because I&rsquo;m a believer,</p>
<p>I hope that it&rsquo;s possible to have,</p>
<p>to strive towards a government that works extremely well.</p>
<p>I think at its best, a government represents the people</p>
<p>and functions in the similar way that you&rsquo;re mentioning,</p>
<p>but that, like, pushback,</p>
<p>even if it turns into conspiracy theory sometimes,</p>
<p>I think is actually healthy in the long arc of history.</p>
<p>It can be frustrating sometimes,</p>
<p>but that mechanism of pushing back against power,</p>
<p>against authority, can be healthy.</p>
<p>I agree, I think it&rsquo;s fine to question the vaccines.</p>
<p>What I have issue with is that many people</p>
<p>put out incorrect information,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure what their motivations are,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very hard to fight that,</p>
<p>because then it&rsquo;s my word versus theirs,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m happy to talk with people</p>
<p>about any of their concerns,</p>
<p>but if you start getting into the stuff</p>
<p>that just isn&rsquo;t true, then we have a problem.</p>
<p>The thing I struggle with is conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>whatever language you want to use,</p>
<p>but sort of ideas that challenge</p>
<p>the mainstream quote unquote narrative,</p>
<p>given our current social media and internet,</p>
<p>like the way it operates,</p>
<p>they can become viral much easier.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something much more compelling about them.</p>
<p>Like I have a secret about the way things really work.</p>
<p>That becomes viral, and that&rsquo;s very frustrating,</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re not having</p>
<p>a conversation on level ground.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re trying to present scientific ideas,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>the conspiracy theories become viral much faster,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re not just having a discussion</p>
<p>on level ground.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the frustrating part,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not an even discussion.</p>
<p>Can I just say one more thing?</p>
<p>I mean, the internet is here to stay,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re gonna have to figure out</p>
<p>how to deal with it, right?</p>
<p>But from my perspective,</p>
<p>I was skeptical that any COVID vaccine</p>
<p>would be ready within a year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Plus, the way I look at the mRNA vaccine as a scientist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gee whiz to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that it worked,</p>
<p>and I think the data are great, so I want it.</p>
<p>As a scientist, I want it.</p>
<p>One of the really sad things, again,</p>
<p>with me, too, as a scientist or as an admirer of science,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s politics,</p>
<p>but one of the sad things to me about the previous year</p>
<p>is that I wasn&rsquo;t free to celebrate</p>
<p>the incredible accomplishment of science with the vaccines.</p>
<p>I was very skeptical that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to develop a vaccine so quickly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s unfortunate that we can&rsquo;t celebrate</p>
<p>how amazing humans are to come up with this vaccine.</p>
<p>Now, this vaccine might have long term effects.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean this is not incredible.</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t you celebrate?</p>
<p>Because I would love to inspire the world</p>
<p>with the amazing things science can do.</p>
<p>And when you say something about the vaccines,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not listening to the science.</p>
<p>A lot of people are not listening to the science.</p>
<p>What they hear is, oh, you&rsquo;re a Republican</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re a Democrat, and you&rsquo;re social signaling,</p>
<p>doing some kind of signaling.</p>
<p>No, I think that the vaccine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about injecting something into you,</p>
<p>and maybe you&rsquo;re right that the rhetoric is like,</p>
<p>you better take this or you&rsquo;re dumb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the right approach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen, actually, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen both sides kind of imply that.</p>
<p>So the people who are against the vaccine</p>
<p>are dumb for not trusting science,</p>
<p>and the people who are for the vaccine</p>
<p>are called dumb for trusting science,</p>
<p>the scientific institution.</p>
<p>And nobody wins, yeah.</p>
<p>And they both kind of have a point.</p>
<p>Like, because you can always,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, is the glass half full or half empty?</p>
<p>Because you can always look at, like, science</p>
<p>from a perspective of certain individuals</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t represent, perhaps, the not greatest leaders,</p>
<p>almost like political leaders.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>yesterday I went on a whole rant against,</p>
<p>I said a lot of positive things about Anthony Fauci</p>
<p>before I went on a rant against him.</p>
<p>Because ultimately, you know,</p>
<p>I think he failed as a leader,</p>
<p>and I know it&rsquo;s very difficult to be a leader,</p>
<p>but I still wanted to hold him accountable for that</p>
<p>as a great communicator of science and as a great leader.</p>
<p>What do you think he didn&rsquo;t do right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>So the core of the problem is the several characteristics</p>
<p>of the way he was communicating to the public.</p>
<p>So one is the general inauthenticity.</p>
<p>Two is a thing that, it&rsquo;s very hard to put into words,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s certain ways of speaking to people</p>
<p>that sounds like you&rsquo;re hiding something from them.</p>
<p>That sounds like you&rsquo;re full of shit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the authenticity piece.</p>
<p>Like, it sounds like you&rsquo;re not really speaking</p>
<p>to the full truth of what you know</p>
<p>and that you did some shady shit in your past</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to hide.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a way of communicating</p>
<p>that I think the internet and people in general</p>
<p>are becoming much better at detecting.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like you said, they&rsquo;re good BS detectors.</p>
<p>Yeah, good BS detectors.</p>
<p>But contributing to that is speaking from authority,</p>
<p>speaking with authority and confidence</p>
<p>where neither is deserved.</p>
<p>So first of all, nobody&rsquo;s an authority on this new virus.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re facing a deadly pandemic,</p>
<p>and especially in the early stages,</p>
<p>it was unclear how deadly it would be.</p>
<p>It was unclear, probably still unclear,</p>
<p>fully how it&rsquo;s transmitted.</p>
<p>The full dynamics of the virus,</p>
<p>the full understanding of which solutions work and not,</p>
<p>how well masks of different kinds work,</p>
<p>how easy or difficult it is to create tests,</p>
<p>how many months or years it&rsquo;s gonna take</p>
<p>to create a vaccine,</p>
<p>how well in history or currently do quarantine methods</p>
<p>or lockdown methods work,</p>
<p>what are the different data mechanisms</p>
<p>that are data collection mechanisms</p>
<p>that are being implemented,</p>
<p>what are the clear plans that need to happen,</p>
<p>what the epidemiology that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>what is the uncertainty around that?</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the geopolitical stuff with China.</p>
<p>I personally believe there should have been</p>
<p>much more openness about the origins of the virus,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re leaked from a lab or not.</p>
<p>I think communicating that you&rsquo;re open to these ideas</p>
<p>is actually the way to get people to trust you,</p>
<p>that you are legitimately open to ideas</p>
<p>that are very unpleasant, that go against the mainstream.</p>
<p>Showing that openness is going to get people to trust you</p>
<p>when you finally decrease the variance in your uncertainty,</p>
<p>like decrease uncertainty and have,</p>
<p>we still have a lot of uncertainty,</p>
<p>but this is the best course of action.</p>
<p>Vaccines still have a lot of uncertainty around them.</p>
<p>mRNA is a new technology,</p>
<p>but we have increasing amounts of data,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the data sources,</p>
<p>and laying them out in a very clear way</p>
<p>of this is the best course of action that we have now.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the perfect course of action,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s by far the best course of action.</p>
<p>And that would come from a leader</p>
<p>that has earned the capital of trust from people.</p>
<p>I mean, I think in recent history,</p>
<p>the worst pandemic is 1918 flu, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s mainly because we didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have many tools at our disposal.</p>
<p>And that was tied up with World War I.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So the leadership there, I mean.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know what is a lot of deaths, right?</p>
<p>And any one person is someone&rsquo;s family,</p>
<p>so to them it&rsquo;s a lot, right?</p>
<p>But that logic, we don&rsquo;t apply that logic generally,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of people suffering</p>
<p>and dying throughout the world,</p>
<p>and we turn the other way all the time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the story of history.</p>
<p>So saying you all of a sudden.</p>
<p>What bothers me though, I mean, personally,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like anyone dying anywhere,</p>
<p>but, and especially considering what technology</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to muster, yet we still kill each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a dichotomy to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, this is the, what is it, Paul Farmer?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s these great stories.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the burden of being in healthcare,</p>
<p>being a doctor, is you have to help.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t help but help a person in front of you</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s hurting, but you also are burdened</p>
<p>by the knowledge that you helping them,</p>
<p>you spending money and effort and time on them,</p>
<p>means you&rsquo;re not going to help others,</p>
<p>and you cannot possibly allocate</p>
<p>that amount of time to everybody.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re choosing which person lives and which person dies.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re doing so,</p>
<p>the reason you&rsquo;re helping the person in front of you</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re in front of you.</p>
<p>And so the reason right now we care a lot about COVID</p>
<p>is because the eye of the world has turned to COVID,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not seeing all the other atrocities</p>
<p>going on in the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not necessarily related to deaths,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re related to suffering, human suffering,</p>
<p>which you could argue is worse than death,</p>
<p>prolonged suffering.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all of these questions.</p>
<p>And the fundamental question here is,</p>
<p>are we overreacting to COVID in our policies?</p>
<p>So this is the, when we turn our eye</p>
<p>and care about this particular thing and not other things,</p>
<p>are we dismissing the pain that business owners</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve lost their businesses are going to feel?</p>
<p>And then the long, talking about long COVID,</p>
<p>the long term effects, economic effects on the millions</p>
<p>of people that will suffer, that suffer financially,</p>
<p>but also suffer from their dreams</p>
<p>being completely collapsed.</p>
<p>So a lot of people seek gain meaning from work.</p>
<p>And if you take away that work,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s anger that can be born, there&rsquo;s pain.</p>
<p>And so what does that lead to?</p>
<p>That can lead to the rising up of charismatic leaders</p>
<p>that channel that anger towards destructive things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been done throughout history.</p>
<p>So you have to balance that with the policies</p>
<p>that you have in COVID.</p>
<p>And then, I mean, very much my main opposition</p>
<p>to Fauci is not on the details, but the final result,</p>
<p>which is I just observe that there&rsquo;s a significant decrease</p>
<p>in trust in science as a, not the institution,</p>
<p>but the very sort of mechanisms of science.</p>
<p>I think science is both beautiful and powerful.</p>
<p>And the reason why we have so many amazing things</p>
<p>and such a high quality of life.</p>
<p>And distrust in that, that the thing we need now</p>
<p>to get out of all the troubles we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>continue getting out of the troubles we&rsquo;re in is science,</p>
<p>the scientific process, broadly defined like innovation,</p>
<p>technological innovation, scientific innovation,</p>
<p>all of that, distrust in that is totally</p>
<p>the wrong thing we need.</p>
<p>And so anybody who gets in,</p>
<p>who causes a distrust in science to me,</p>
<p>carries the responsibility of that</p>
<p>and should be in, because the response,</p>
<p>I mean, should be fired, should be,</p>
<p>or at least openly have to carry the burden of that,</p>
<p>of having caused of that kind of level of mistrust.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s maybe unfair to place it on any one individual,</p>
<p>but you have to, I think in your pocket said,</p>
<p>the buck stops at the top, like the leaders have to.</p>
<p>No, no, there&rsquo;s a clear leader here, yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>So even if it&rsquo;s not directly his fault,</p>
<p>he has to carry the price of that.</p>
<p>Do you think we should at this point say,</p>
<p>okay, we have vaccines,</p>
<p>you can decide whether you take them or not,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s move forward?</p>
<p>Maybe you can help me understand this,</p>
<p>because it seems like, why is that not the right solution?</p>
<p>Completely open society, the vaccines,</p>
<p>at least in the United States,</p>
<p>as I understand are widely available.</p>
<p>So this is the American way, you have the decision to make.</p>
<p>If you have conditions that make you worried to get COVID</p>
<p>and go to the hospital, then you should get vaccinated</p>
<p>because here&rsquo;s the data that shows</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s much less likely for you to die</p>
<p>if you get vaccinated,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t want to get vaccinated</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re worried about longterm effects of vaccine</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>but then you suffer the consequences of that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I think is driving,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all about kids,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna go back to school in the fall</p>
<p>and many of them can&rsquo;t be vaccinated.</p>
<p>So if they get infected, they do have less frequency</p>
<p>of disease, but it&rsquo;s not zero.</p>
<p>They do get sick and they can have longterm consequences.</p>
<p>And at that age, it would be a shame, right?</p>
<p>And not even their choice,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t decide to get vaccinated or not</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t have access to it.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s what would drive my efforts</p>
<p>to try and get more people, at least in schools, vaccinated,</p>
<p>but I might be wrong, it may not be that.</p>
<p>So can you kind of dig into that a little bit?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re saying that there should be an effort</p>
<p>for increased vaccinations of kids going to school,</p>
<p>just not for societal benefit,</p>
<p>but for the benefit of each individual kid, right?</p>
<p>So right now, kids under 12, right,</p>
<p>are not yet vaccinated, is that correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not gonna be in time for school opening</p>
<p>that they get vaccinated.</p>
<p>And then, I suppose the teachers</p>
<p>are all gonna be vaccinated,</p>
<p>makes sense for them to do that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just worried the kids</p>
<p>are gonna be transmitting it amongst them</p>
<p>and many states don&rsquo;t allow mask mandate in school.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s driving the larger narrative</p>
<p>in the US to protect kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of what I hear from Daniel Griffin,</p>
<p>because increasing numbers of kids</p>
<p>are being admitted to hospitals now,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re becoming the major unvaccinated population.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hanging out over the summer</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just gonna get worse in the fall.</p>
<p>And so you could have a lot of kids with long COVID</p>
<p>and disabled their entire lives, right, so.</p>
<p>And of course, hearing from people who are vaccine hesitant,</p>
<p>I hear exactly the kids statement,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re saying they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>the long term effects of the vaccine to affect the kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s of this new vaccine.</p>
<p>Which I would say is, as I said before,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say never,</p>
<p>but we do know that long COVID exists.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know for how long,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve only looked out six or eight months.</p>
<p>We know that exists and the frequency is increasing.</p>
<p>It certainly exists in young kids</p>
<p>and we have no idea about long vaccine effects.</p>
<p>So I think they have to make their decision based on that.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>But your question is why don&rsquo;t we just open up society,</p>
<p>say here we have these vaccines</p>
<p>if you wanna protect yourself.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s mainly the school</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s driving the whole narrative, that&rsquo;s my opinion.</p>
<p>In which direction, not to open up or?</p>
<p>No, to open up, but to try and get their efforts</p>
<p>at the federal level to get people vaccinated, right?</p>
<p>But see, how high are the risks for kids?</p>
<p>I mean, my understanding was it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, yes, it&rsquo;s nonzero, but it&rsquo;s very low.</p>
<p>But what is the numbers?</p>
<p>Now, 70,000 hospitalizations so far</p>
<p>in kids as of last week.</p>
<p>So yes, it&rsquo;s low, but polio was low.</p>
<p>Polio was 20, 30,000 kids a year paralyzed.</p>
<p>And well, many people have actually argued</p>
<p>that that vaccine wasn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>
<p>Now, that wasn&rsquo;t a substantial enough health problem.</p>
<p>But paralyzed is different than hospital.</p>
<p>So what does hospitalized mean?</p>
<p>Long COVID.</p>
<p>But this is the long COVID question.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the open question.</p>
<p>It was long COVID in kids.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Well, a lot of the same issues,</p>
<p>cognitive issues, motor issues,</p>
<p>respiratory, GI dysfunction.</p>
<p>How long?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, it could end in a year.</p>
<p>As you know, there are other post acute infectious sequelae</p>
<p>that we know about.</p>
<p>Chronic fatigue, ME, CFS is thought</p>
<p>to be a post infectious sequelae,</p>
<p>which has gone for many decades now</p>
<p>in many millions of people.</p>
<p>This could be another one of those.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just saying it might be worth erring</p>
<p>on the side of not letting the kids get infected.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;m trying to keep an open mind here</p>
<p>and I appreciate you doing the same.</p>
<p>Of course, I lean on definitely not requiring people</p>
<p>to get vaccinated,</p>
<p>but I do think getting vaccinated</p>
<p>is just the wiser choice,</p>
<p>looking at all the different trajectories before us.</p>
<p>Getting vaccinated seems like from the data,</p>
<p>it seems like the obvious choice, frankly.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also trying to keep an open mind</p>
<p>because some things in the past that seemed obvious</p>
<p>would turn out to be completely wrong.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to keep an open mind here.</p>
<p>So for example, one of the things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get your thoughts on this is antiviral ideas.</p>
<p>So ideas outside of the vaccine.</p>
<p>So ivermectin, something that Brett Weinstein</p>
<p>and a few others have been talking about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a few studies.</p>
<p>Some of them have been shown not to be very good studies,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, there seems to be some promise.</p>
<p>And I wanted to talk to Brett</p>
<p>about this particular topic for two reasons.</p>
<p>One, I was really bothered by censorship of this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole nother topic.</p>
<p>I just, I&rsquo;m bothered by censorship.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gray area, of course,</p>
<p>but it just feels like that should not have been censored</p>
<p>from YouTube, like discussions of ivermectin.</p>
<p>We can set that aside.</p>
<p>The other thing I was bothered by</p>
<p>the lack of open mindedness</p>
<p>on exploring things like ivermectin in the early days,</p>
<p>especially when at least I thought</p>
<p>the vaccine would take a long time.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not just ivermectin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really seriously at a large scale,</p>
<p>rigorously exploring the effectiveness of masks.</p>
<p>And the big one for me is testing.</p>
<p>Like the fact that that wasn&rsquo;t explored aggressively</p>
<p>to lead to mass manufacturing like May, 2020 is absurd.</p>
<p>Anyway, so I was bothered by these solutions</p>
<p>not being explored and not by now</p>
<p>having really good ivermectin studies.</p>
<p>Can I talk about ivermectin?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would love that, yeah.</p>
<p>Sure, so full disclosure,</p>
<p>my wife worked on ivermectin at Merck for 20 years.</p>
<p>Okay, so they just want people to know,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t talk to her all the time about it.</p>
<p>And anyway, she hasn&rsquo;t been at Merck for a long time.</p>
<p>As you know, ivermectin is a very safe drug</p>
<p>used to treat certain parasitic infections, right?</p>
<p>And it is approved, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>You can take one dose a year</p>
<p>and be protected against river blindness in Africa</p>
<p>and certain parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remarkably effective.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s quite a safe drug</p>
<p>at the doses that are approved.</p>
<p>Now, early last year, a study was done,</p>
<p>I believe in Australia, which showed in cells in the lab,</p>
<p>if you infect with SARS CoV2 and then put ivermectin in,</p>
<p>it would inhibit the virus production substantially.</p>
<p>It was quite clear, right?</p>
<p>But the concentrations they were using were rather high</p>
<p>and could not be achieved by the approved dosing.</p>
<p>So you would need to do a dosing study</p>
<p>to make sure it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>And the reason is that ivermectin binds to receptors</p>
<p>in your brain and it can have high doses.</p>
<p>So some people take high doses inappropriately</p>
<p>and they have neurological consequences.</p>
<p>So if you needed 10 times more ivermectin,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to make sure it would be safe in people.</p>
<p>So this is a question of safety too.</p>
<p>Right, so I think it has always been the case</p>
<p>that it should have been properly studied, but it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There were lots of trials here and there,</p>
<p>lots of improperly controlled trials</p>
<p>where someone would just treat some patients</p>
<p>and say, hey, they all did fine, but have no control arm.</p>
<p>And there were some controlled trials,</p>
<p>but they were very small.</p>
<p>So right now, a 4,000 person trial is enrolling</p>
<p>to test in a randomly controlled trial setting,</p>
<p>whether it works or not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still plenty of cases that you can do that.</p>
<p>So you can ask whether there are any side effects.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s completely fine.</p>
<p>And if it says it works, then we should use it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I always tell people,</p>
<p>if you wanna use ivermectin, you can do it off label.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s FDA approved.</p>
<p>And if your physician says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you this off label,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any objection,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna work.</p>
<p>Now, a friend of ours last week in New Jersey got COVID.</p>
<p>He went to his local hospital</p>
<p>and their regimen was remdesivir, dexamethasone, ivermectin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written, that&rsquo;s what they do for every COVID patient.</p>
<p>They just give it to them automatically.</p>
<p>And so he recovered.</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s to say it was or was not ivermectin, right?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have any strong ideological opposition.</p>
<p>I just think it should be tested</p>
<p>for what you wanna use it for.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s being done, and I think that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Is it strange to you that ivermectin</p>
<p>or other things like it</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t tested aggressively in the beginning?</p>
<p>From a broad scientific community aspect,</p>
<p>I can be a little bit conspiratorial,</p>
<p>and this is what people talk about with ivermectin,</p>
<p>is with the vaccines,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s quite a lot of money to be made.</p>
<p>With ivermectin, there&rsquo;s not as much money to be made.</p>
<p>Is that too conspiratorial?</p>
<p>Like why didn&rsquo;t we try more solutions in the beginning?</p>
<p>Well, all the money was put into vaccines, right?</p>
<p>Very little was put into antivirals,</p>
<p>because the decision was made at a very high level,</p>
<p>probably involving Dr. Fauci.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna put 24 billion into vaccines, right?</p>
<p>And I think part of the reasoning is</p>
<p>they give you years worth of protection,</p>
<p>whereas an antiviral works</p>
<p>and you have to keep dosing and so forth.</p>
<p>But ivermectin is not trivial in this.</p>
<p>I agree, it should have been tested early on,</p>
<p>but we had a really bad experience with hydroxychloroquine,</p>
<p>which we can talk about too.</p>
<p>Ivermectin is very hard to synthesize.</p>
<p>Most drugs, you synthesize chemically.</p>
<p>You devise a formulation and a synthesis,</p>
<p>and they do it, they scale it up, and it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Ivermectin is really hard.</p>
<p>And so what they do instead is they take the culture</p>
<p>of the bacterium that makes it,</p>
<p>and they grow it up, and they ferment it,</p>
<p>and then they purify it.</p>
<p>And Merck owns the bacteria.</p>
<p>A number of years ago, two employees of Merck stole it</p>
<p>and left the company and tried to market it,</p>
<p>and they were arrested and they got put in jail.</p>
<p>So they protect it very carefully.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t just make it.</p>
<p>If you do, it&rsquo;s incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>And now India, it&rsquo;s very cheap apparently.</p>
<p>They use it quite liberally there,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;re making it.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;ve licensed it from Merck and so forth.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why it hasn&rsquo;t been tested more widely, I think.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s complexities in terms of getting a lot of it</p>
<p>and manufacturing a lot of it.</p>
<p>Yes. Okay.</p>
<p>So what was the hydroxychloroquine?</p>
<p>So hydroxychloroquine was also shown early on</p>
<p>to inhibit virus in cell culture.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not surprising.</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine, of course, is used for malaria.</p>
<p>And what it does, when your cell takes up things</p>
<p>from the plasma membrane, including viruses,</p>
<p>it goes through a pathway called the endocytic pathway,</p>
<p>which involves a vesicle moving through the cell.</p>
<p>And as it moves through the cell, its pH drops.</p>
<p>And that lets a lot of viruses out actually.</p>
<p>And hydroxychloroquine blocks that.</p>
<p>So it blocks infection with a lot of viruses.</p>
<p>So the problem with those early studies that were published</p>
<p>is that they were done in kidney cells and culture,</p>
<p>where the only way the virus can get in</p>
<p>is through the endosome.</p>
<p>And hydroxychloroquine inhibits that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why it inhibits in kidney cells and culture.</p>
<p>But lung cells and respiratory cells of humans</p>
<p>where the virus reproduces can get in two different ways.</p>
<p>It can get in from this endocytic pathway,</p>
<p>which is inhibited by hydroxychloroquine,</p>
<p>or it can get in at the cell surface,</p>
<p>which is not inhibited by hydroxychloroquine.</p>
<p>So when you treat patients, it has no effect in the lung</p>
<p>because the virus can just bypass it.</p>
<p>And all the usage initially were based on</p>
<p>the studies done in kidney cells and culture.</p>
<p>So that was just wrong, scientifically incorrect,</p>
<p>yet it drove a lot of, and today many people</p>
<p>still think they should be taking it, but.</p>
<p>So that not panning out kind of resulted</p>
<p>in a loss of optimism about other similar things panning out.</p>
<p>Well, that and many other repurposed drugs were tried,</p>
<p>and a lot of HIV antivirals were tried.</p>
<p>I think the problem with hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p>influenced the ivermectin narrative.</p>
<p>People thought that the data was being hidden</p>
<p>about hydroxychloroquine, so they said,</p>
<p>well, they must be doing the same thing with ivermectin,</p>
<p>but with hydroxychloroquine, it just scientifically</p>
<p>could not work as an antiviral.</p>
<p>The other problem that is more broad</p>
<p>that is important to point out is that</p>
<p>when you have COVID and you need an antiviral,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually because you can&rsquo;t breathe</p>
<p>and you go in a hospital.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re mildly ill,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never gonna go to your doctor</p>
<p>and ask for an antiviral.</p>
<p>And the problem is when you can&rsquo;t breathe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no longer a viral issue.</p>
<p>It is now an inflammatory issue,</p>
<p>and no antiviral in the world is gonna help you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why remdesivir doesn&rsquo;t work very well,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s mainly given intravenously</p>
<p>to people who go in a hospital.</p>
<p>If you get ivermectin in the hospital,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna do anything for reducing virus,</p>
<p>because by that time, you have very little virus</p>
<p>to begin with.</p>
<p>You have an inflammatory problem</p>
<p>that you need to treat in other ways.</p>
<p>So this is why a lot of the antivirals failed,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re used too late.</p>
<p>What you need is a pill you take</p>
<p>on that first positive test,</p>
<p>when you have a scratchy throat.</p>
<p>You get a PCR in 15 minutes, I&rsquo;m positive,</p>
<p>take a pill, boom, that&rsquo;s gonna inhibit it.</p>
<p>If you wait till you can&rsquo;t breathe,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why the monoclonals even don&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in hospital that well,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>And the approach now is if you&rsquo;re in a high risk group,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re over 65, if you are obese or have diabetes</p>
<p>or any other comorbidities,</p>
<p>your first sign of a scratchy throat positive,</p>
<p>you get monoclonals, then they might help you.</p>
<p>But if you wait till you go in a hospital, it&rsquo;s too late,</p>
<p>because the viral curve drops.</p>
<p>After that first symptom, within three days,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re no longer shedding enough virus to transmit.</p>
<p>Drops really quickly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the reason a lot of these antivirals failed,</p>
<p>because they were tested in hospitalized patients.</p>
<p>And we have nothing but remdesivir now, unfortunately.</p>
<p>So it was the wrong approach.</p>
<p>We should have been giving it to people</p>
<p>who just tested positive from the start.</p>
<p>Or just even for preventative and see.</p>
<p>You could do that too.</p>
<p>But I have to say, the other issue is,</p>
<p>this molnupiravir is a drug in phase three now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an oral antiviral, it looks good.</p>
<p>If we go ahead with just one,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna get resistance within a few months,</p>
<p>and it will be useless.</p>
<p>We need to have at least two or three drugs</p>
<p>that we can give in combinations.</p>
<p>And we know that, because that&rsquo;s what took care of HIV,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what took care of HCV, hepatitis C virus.</p>
<p>It really reduces the emergence of resistance.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan got quite a bit of heat recently</p>
<p>about mentioning a paper and a broader idea,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think is that controversial,</p>
<p>but maybe we can expand on it.</p>
<p>And the idea is that vaccines</p>
<p>create selective pressure for a virus to mutate</p>
<p>and for variants to form.</p>
<p>First of all, from a biological perspective,</p>
<p>can you explain this process?</p>
<p>And from a societal perspective,</p>
<p>what are we supposed to do about that?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get the terminology right.</p>
<p>So as we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>viruses are always mutating.</p>
<p>So no vaccine or no drug makes a virus mutate.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s the wrong perspective</p>
<p>in which to look at it, got it.</p>
<p>What the immune response is putting pressure,</p>
<p>selection pressure on the virus.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s one particle with the right mutation</p>
<p>that can escape the antibody, that will emerge, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what happens with influenza virus, right?</p>
<p>We vaccinate every year,</p>
<p>and there are not a lot of people that get infected,</p>
<p>so they get natural immunity.</p>
<p>And then the virus is incredibly varied.</p>
<p>It mutates like crazy.</p>
<p>And in some person somewhere,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one variant that escapes the antibody,</p>
<p>which has been induced either by infection or vaccination.</p>
<p>It can be both.</p>
<p>And that drives the emergence of the new variants,</p>
<p>so the next year we need to change the vaccine.</p>
<p>So I would say both natural infection and vaccination,</p>
<p>sure, select for variants.</p>
<p>Absolutely, there&rsquo;s no question,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re inducing immunity.</p>
<p>Now, what happened last year was at the beginning of 2020,</p>
<p>very few people in the world were immune</p>
<p>as the virus first started spreading.</p>
<p>But you can see in the sequences of those isolates</p>
<p>from the beginning of 2020,</p>
<p>you can see all of the changes that are now present</p>
<p>in the variants of concern at very, very low frequencies.</p>
<p>They were already there,</p>
<p>but there was no selection for them to emerge.</p>
<p>Until November, when we now had many millions of people</p>
<p>who had mostly been infected, but also some vaccinated,</p>
<p>then we saw the alpha variant emerge in England,</p>
<p>probably because of immune selection.</p>
<p>Now, the virus that had the change</p>
<p>that evaded the antibody had an advantage,</p>
<p>and that virus drove through the population.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>All these variants are simply antigenic selection.</p>
<p>So the variants, the mutations</p>
<p>that are at the core of these, quote unquote, variants,</p>
<p>they were always there all along the vaccine,</p>
<p>or the infections did not create them.</p>
<p>No, the infections don&rsquo;t create them, they&rsquo;re selected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the vaccine wipe out a lot of the variants,</p>
<p>and then by making your body immune to them,</p>
<p>but some of them survive.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another tree that&rsquo;s built,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unclear what that tree leads to.</p>
<p>I mean, it could make things much worse or much better,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, with flu, we see year after year the virus changes,</p>
<p>we change the vaccine, we deal with it,</p>
<p>we change it again, there&rsquo;s an unending series.</p>
<p>But see, that&rsquo;s a very different story.</p>
<p>If, do you think COVID will be with some likelihood,</p>
<p>like the flu, where it&rsquo;s basically variants,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll never be able to eradicate it?</p>
<p>It will never eradicate it in any case, ever.</p>
<p>Well, come up with a vaccine</p>
<p>that makes you immune to enough variants</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s not enough evolutionary room.</p>
<p>Well, if you cut down the number of infections,</p>
<p>then you reduce the diversity, sure, right?</p>
<p>The problem is if, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a cynic</p>
<p>and you say, well, vaccination is just selecting</p>
<p>for variants, so let&rsquo;s stop it.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re gonna have infection,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna select for variants.</p>
<p>And there, you&rsquo;re more likely to get very sick</p>
<p>because we know the vaccines are really good</p>
<p>at preventing you from dying.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it still makes sense to use vaccines</p>
<p>because they prevent you from dying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bottom line.</p>
<p>But can we ever make a vaccine that deals with all variants?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And the reason I say that is because people</p>
<p>who get naturally infected with SARS COVID,</p>
<p>they develop COVID, they recover.</p>
<p>If you give them one vaccine dose,</p>
<p>they make an immune response</p>
<p>that handles all the variants that are around right now.</p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>Much better than people who&rsquo;ve gotten two doses of vaccine.</p>
<p>For some reason, their immune response is suddenly broadened</p>
<p>after the infection vaccination,</p>
<p>and they can handle all the variants that we know of so far.</p>
<p>So that tells me we can devise a strategy</p>
<p>to do the same thing with a vaccine</p>
<p>that makes a really broad vaccine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll handle all the variants.</p>
<p>Well, you actually, on the virology blog,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re the author of that, but.</p>
<p>I am, I am, yes.</p>
<p>Oh, the blog, yes, but there&rsquo;s a particular post</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s talking about reporting on a paper</p>
<p>that a mix and match strategy.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s one of my co writers, Trudy Ray, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s an interesting idea</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some early evidence now</p>
<p>that mixing and matching vaccines,</p>
<p>like one shot of Pfizer and one of like Moderna or something,</p>
<p>that creates a much better immunity</p>
<p>than does two shots of Pfizer.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s worth exploring, absolutely.</p>
<p>And this is relevant, what we&rsquo;re doing with influenza,</p>
<p>you know, instead of having to vaccinate people every year,</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t we devise a vaccine</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;d get once in your lifetime</p>
<p>or maybe once every 10 years, okay?</p>
<p>So the spike of influenza, it&rsquo;s a long protein,</p>
<p>kind of like the spike of SARS CoV2,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s stuck in the virus membrane,</p>
<p>and the very tip, that&rsquo;s the part that changes every year.</p>
<p>This is where the antibodies bind.</p>
<p>But the stem doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>And if you make antibodies to the stem,</p>
<p>they can also prevent infection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that when people are infected</p>
<p>or with the current vaccines,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t make many antibodies to that stem part,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to make those</p>
<p>and we think they would be broadly protective</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d never be able to,</p>
<p>or more rarely be able to have a variant emerge</p>
<p>that escaped it.</p>
<p>And I think we can do the same thing</p>
<p>with coronavirus too, for sure.</p>
<p>Can I ask you about testing?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>You mentioned PCR, what kind of tests are there?</p>
<p>The antigen test, what are your thoughts on each?</p>
<p>Maybe this is a good place to also mention like viral load</p>
<p>and the history of the virus as it passes through your body</p>
<p>in terms of what&rsquo;s being tested for</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So the first tests that were developed were PCR,</p>
<p>polymerase chain reaction.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically nucleic acid amplification tests.</p>
<p>And they were very first ones.</p>
<p>They stuck the swab all the way up into your brain almost.</p>
<p>I had that done a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, it&rsquo;s really nasty.</p>
<p>But now they do an anterior Nares swab.</p>
<p>They get a little, they get a bunch of cells</p>
<p>and some mucus which has virus and parts of virus,</p>
<p>stick it in a test tube and then they run a reaction</p>
<p>which by the way involves reverse transcriptase</p>
<p>because it converts the viral RNA to DNA</p>
<p>and then you amplify it.</p>
<p>And you can specify what part of the viral RNA</p>
<p>you wanna amplify and then a machine will detect it</p>
<p>and it can be done in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re detecting pieces of RNA, not infectious virus.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re measuring viral RNA loads, right?</p>
<p>And a common mistake that many people</p>
<p>who should know better, physicians and scientists</p>
<p>of all kinds, they think that indicates</p>
<p>how much virus you have.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a diagnostic of whether you have bits of RNA in you</p>
<p>and it probably means you&rsquo;re infected.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t use it to shed light on what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll tell you why in a bit.</p>
<p>But first we have to explain some other things.</p>
<p>So until you get to about a million copies of RNA,</p>
<p>so you can measure the copy number in this test,</p>
<p>this PCR test.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a number called CT or cycle threshold.</p>
<p>The test, the way the machine works, it goes through cycles</p>
<p>and every cycle it amplifies what you put in</p>
<p>and the more cycles you need to see something,</p>
<p>that means there&rsquo;s not a lot of RNA there.</p>
<p>So if you do a test and you have a cycle threshold of 35,</p>
<p>you have very little RNA in you.</p>
<p>Contrary, if you have a cycle threshold of 10,</p>
<p>you have a ton of RNA and it only took 10 cycles</p>
<p>to detect it.</p>
<p>And you can extrapolate from that number,</p>
<p>the number of copies you have per sample, say per swab.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have a million, you&rsquo;re not infectious.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna infect anyone.</p>
<p>So in the early days, no matter what CT,</p>
<p>what PCR result you had, they would quarantine you.</p>
<p>And that was wrong because you&rsquo;re not shedding.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be quarantined,</p>
<p>but wasn&rsquo;t thought through properly, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you had like 14 days</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>14 days, which is now we know is too long</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t shed for that long in a normal infection.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s 10 days should be fine.</p>
<p>So what happens is you get infected,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know it of course.</p>
<p>The virus starts to grow very quickly.</p>
<p>And within four or five days,</p>
<p>you reach a peak of shedding.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making a lot of RNA and you may be asymptomatic.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re shedding, you can infect others.</p>
<p>And then you may or may not have your symptom onset.</p>
<p>So you shed for a couple of days before symptom onset.</p>
<p>And then within three days, four days,</p>
<p>the viral RNA crashes and you&rsquo;re no longer shedding,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re no longer transmitting.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the one kind of test we have.</p>
<p>It can tell you if you&rsquo;re infected at the moment,</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna be infected tomorrow, right?</p>
<p>Cause if you&rsquo;re negative today,</p>
<p>you could be positive tomorrow.</p>
<p>You just might be in a different part</p>
<p>of the incubation period, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one test been used the most.</p>
<p>You can now get 15 minute versions of them</p>
<p>in a walk in or whatever fine.</p>
<p>Then there are antigen tests,</p>
<p>which look for the proteins that the virus is making.</p>
<p>So as it&rsquo;s reproducing in your nose,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not only making genomes, it&rsquo;s making proteins.</p>
<p>And so these you can buy in the drug store.</p>
<p>And these would have been great if they had,</p>
<p>Michael Minna last year had the idea</p>
<p>that if we could make a little stick,</p>
<p>a little piece of paper that you would suck on</p>
<p>and it would tell you if you&rsquo;re infected or not,</p>
<p>if this could cost less than a buck,</p>
<p>everybody could test themselves.</p>
<p>Which they can cost less than a buck, by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they were never made, right?</p>
<p>Right, they&rsquo;re never mass manufactured.</p>
<p>So his idea is to do like daily tests.</p>
<p>Yeah, daily and then the kid&rsquo;s going to school,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s positive or she&rsquo;s positive.</p>
<p>Well, if it&rsquo;s cheap enough, you just take another test</p>
<p>because they have a certain error frequency.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s positive twice, you stay home</p>
<p>and the next day you try again.</p>
<p>And I think this would have revolutionized</p>
<p>because the PCR tests are more expensive at the time</p>
<p>and they take longer to do and so forth.</p>
<p>But that never happened.</p>
<p>But now we do have $20 Binax now</p>
<p>and others that you can buy and people buy them.</p>
<p>But that can still happen, right?</p>
<p>And this is the very frustrating thing to me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m worried about variants,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also worried about future,</p>
<p>much more deadly pandemics.</p>
<p>Like I know we kind of said, yes, COVID, lots of deaths,</p>
<p>but like it could be a lot worse too.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m thinking what is going to be the right response</p>
<p>for the future pandemic of its kind?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the right response</p>
<p>for continued number of variants</p>
<p>and some of the variants might be deadlier</p>
<p>or more transmissible?</p>
<p>Well, we can, the antigen tests</p>
<p>will pick up the variants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a question.</p>
<p>The PCR may be influenced by changes,</p>
<p>but you can quickly adapt the primers that you use.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>Like to me, all of these discussions</p>
<p>about vaccines and so on.</p>
<p>Vaccines, we got very lucky that they took so little time.</p>
<p>And you have to be aware no matter what</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s hesitancy with the vaccines</p>
<p>in this country before.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, that&rsquo;s a reality.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just be like magically saying</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to overcome that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any hesitancy</p>
<p>and cheap tests at home.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I think if someone, so the question is</p>
<p>if someone tested positive, would they stay home?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>What if their job depends on them going in?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Well, you have to look at sort of aggregate,</p>
<p>how many people would decide.</p>
<p>And I think, again, a lot of that is in leadership,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of them,</p>
<p>I would say most people would stay home.</p>
<p>I think that Mina had the idea</p>
<p>and it would have changed the whole situation for sure.</p>
<p>If it could have been made when we talked to him last spring,</p>
<p>I think, or summer, we would have gotten around</p>
<p>a lot of the issues that we&rsquo;re in today</p>
<p>because I think people would have stayed home</p>
<p>and not transmitted.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s still valuable to this day.</p>
<p>In the fall, if we don&rsquo;t have vaccine uptake,</p>
<p>we could just test kids every day</p>
<p>and keep them home when they&rsquo;re infected.</p>
<p>It cuts, and we don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>But I think, and I&rsquo;m not privy to what was going on,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think a lot of emphasis</p>
<p>was put on testing early on.</p>
<p>The CDC developed the first one, it was flawed.</p>
<p>They had to recall the kits.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a fiasco.</p>
<p>They should have had 100 companies</p>
<p>making the tests initially, right?</p>
<p>So for the future, I think what we have learned</p>
<p>is we need to have a rapid antigen test right off the bat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doable.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do it in a day like you can for PCR</p>
<p>because you need to make antibodies</p>
<p>to the protein that you&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>and you need to do those in animals.</p>
<p>But you can do it in weeks and we should be ready for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I mean, to me, that&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obviously the best solution.</p>
<p>Second to that, if we understood how well masks work.</p>
<p>Like, maybe let me ask you this question.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put masks aside.</p>
<p>How well do we understand how COVID is transmitted?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s droplets of different sizes,</p>
<p>aerosols, tiny, tiny droplets.</p>
<p>It seems like that&rsquo;s a very difficult thing</p>
<p>to understand thoroughly.</p>
<p>So it seems like it&rsquo;s transmitted both ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how exactly.</p>
<p>So how much do we understand</p>
<p>and why is it so difficult to understand fully?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s clear that it&rsquo;s transmitted</p>
<p>through the air mostly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not touching.</p>
<p>We thought initially it would be a lot of touch,</p>
<p>but very little of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s through the air and when you talk,</p>
<p>mainly when you talk, you expel a lot of droplets, right?</p>
<p>Even the plosives that your foam thing here</p>
<p>are meant to pee, right?</p>
<p>That you send out little sprays</p>
<p>and those have viruses in them.</p>
<p>And the big drops fall to the ground</p>
<p>and the little ones can go 100 feet or more, right?</p>
<p>But the little ones also have less virus in them.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure, well, we certainly do not know</p>
<p>how much virus you need to be infected.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s probably at least several thousand particles,</p>
<p>if not more.</p>
<p>And it could be that for most people,</p>
<p>the tiny droplets don&rsquo;t have enough virus</p>
<p>to infect someone else.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s one observation about this virus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And that is that 80% of transmissions</p>
<p>are done by 20% of the people, of the infected people.</p>
<p>Not every infected person transmits.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been borne out in multiple studies.</p>
<p>And in fact, there&rsquo;s a study at University of Colorado</p>
<p>where they quantified the viral RNA loads</p>
<p>in all the swabs that had been done of students</p>
<p>for like a six month period.</p>
<p>And most of the infectious virus,</p>
<p>most of the RNA copies were found</p>
<p>in 15 to 20% of the people.</p>
<p>The rest had really low</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably why they don&rsquo;t transmit.</p>
<p>So those are the ones that might get enough virus</p>
<p>in the tiny droplets to be able to infect</p>
<p>someone at a distance.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s entirely possible.</p>
<p>Why is it hard to study?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do it in real life</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s infected.</p>
<p>And if you do, there&rsquo;s not a controlled environment</p>
<p>to measure droplets and so forth.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to do it in a laboratory situation.</p>
<p>If you use an animal, you just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the relevance of that is to people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to use human and do challenge experiments.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t do that at this point,</p>
<p>at least not for this virus.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s hard to know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So we have to make inferences</p>
<p>from epidemiological associations</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re studying, say transmission in a household</p>
<p>where people are stuck in the same rooms together</p>
<p>and you can get an idea of what kind of droplets</p>
<p>were involved.</p>
<p>So that makes it much harder too.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re leaning on epidemiological stuff</p>
<p>as opposed to like biophysics</p>
<p>or something like the mechanic.</p>
<p>Very hard.</p>
<p>So that makes it really hard to then develop solutions</p>
<p>like masks, to ask the question, how well do masks work?</p>
<p>Because then to answer that question,</p>
<p>you can lean on epidemiological stuff again,</p>
<p>like looking at populations that wear masks</p>
<p>versus don&rsquo;t wear masks.</p>
<p>As opposed to actually saying,</p>
<p>like from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>like what kind of material and what kind of tightness</p>
<p>by which amount decreases the viral load</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s received on the other end.</p>
<p>But some experiments have been done with masks</p>
<p>and just droplets with no virus in them, right?</p>
<p>And you can measure the efficiency</p>
<p>of different mask materials at keeping those in.</p>
<p>So if I say that this mask stops 70%</p>
<p>of this or larger size droplet,</p>
<p>that leads to this percent decreased transmission.</p>
<p>And also on both the generation</p>
<p>and the receiving end and the giving end.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So how well do masks protect you from others?</p>
<p>How well do you do mask protect others from you?</p>
<p>Like all of those things seem like</p>
<p>they could be more rigorously studied.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>And now is the time because once this is over,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s gonna do it.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s gonna care.</p>
<p>No. Right.</p>
<p>But it seems like to me, so tests is one thing,</p>
<p>but masks, like the good mask,</p>
<p>whatever the good means, whatever that means,</p>
<p>like some level of quality of material on your face,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s shown to actually like thoroughly shown to work well,</p>
<p>that seems like an obvious solution</p>
<p>to reopen society with.</p>
<p>If you have a good understanding of how well they work.</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t have a good understanding,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you get,</p>
<p>and you have people speaking from authority,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you start getting the politicization</p>
<p>of the solution.</p>
<p>Of course, of course.</p>
<p>No, the data, there are some data,</p>
<p>most, they&rsquo;re mostly epidemiological</p>
<p>and they show some effect in some countries, right?</p>
<p>But they could be way better.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, but the fact that they&rsquo;re not perfect,</p>
<p>then people take advantage of and say,</p>
<p>well, look, they don&rsquo;t work that well,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not gonna wear it.</p>
<p>I think, as you said, people can use it as an excuse.</p>
<p>But even if it works, so Daniel always says,</p>
<p>a mask will cut down transmission by 50 to 60%,</p>
<p>and then distance will do another 30%.</p>
<p>Yeah, those numbers are made up though.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re not made up, but they&rsquo;re estimates.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And many of them are made based on models, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We make this model,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say the mask cuts down this much,</p>
<p>what will be the effect on it?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, they&rsquo;re models,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s for the same reason.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe the transmission of the variants</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all based on statistical models as well,</p>
<p>not biological experiments done in a lab.</p>
<p>So in that sense, vaccine data is much better</p>
<p>than mask data.</p>
<p>For sure, for sure.</p>
<p>So my problem with the mask data,</p>
<p>which I always thought was fascinating,</p>
<p>I stopped talking about it.</p>
<p>I was in a paper about masks.</p>
<p>I stopped talking about it</p>
<p>because what started happening</p>
<p>is masks created assholes on both sides.</p>
<p>The people that were like in Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>the friends of mine that were wearing masks,</p>
<p>the way they look at others who don&rsquo;t is like&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a whole nother issue, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I understand.</p>
<p>That happens when you don&rsquo;t have solid science.</p>
<p>Understood.</p>
<p>They now start judging you like you&rsquo;re a lesser human being.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not only dumb, but you&rsquo;re almost like evil.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing bad for society by not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>And then the people looking in the other way</p>
<p>are seeing you for the asshole that you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>for judging them unrightly.</p>
<p>So they almost wanna say F you by not wearing the mask.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this division that&rsquo;s created</p>
<p>that was heartbreaking to me because masks like testing</p>
<p>is a solution that was available early on.</p>
<p>And if understood well, it could be deployed</p>
<p>in a mass scale, and it seems like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some historical evidence for other viruses</p>
<p>where it does very well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>And so like the fact that this was politicized,</p>
<p>yeah, it was a little bit heartbreaking.</p>
<p>You can find in the literature studies,</p>
<p>mostly of healthcare workers and influenza,</p>
<p>where you can actually,</p>
<p>because you see the people every day that can sample them,</p>
<p>you can actually see what masking does.</p>
<p>And some of them show an effect and others do not,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Like any trial, sometimes if it&rsquo;s not big enough</p>
<p>and then people latch onto that, see,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>But I think the main issue is that in January,</p>
<p>both CDC and WHO said masks don&rsquo;t work, don&rsquo;t use them.</p>
<p>That was the kiss of death for masks</p>
<p>because when they then changed their mind,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t say we screwed up.</p>
<p>They just said wear masks.</p>
<p>If they had said we made a mistake, we were wrong,</p>
<p>I think more people would have worn masks.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And like you said, admitting you&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>is like a real big part of it.</p>
<p>And I also think almost the better way</p>
<p>is not just saying you&rsquo;re wrong,</p>
<p>but in January saying,</p>
<p>like revealing the uncertainty under which we operate.</p>
<p>Like actually, like reveal what was done</p>
<p>with the Spanish flu at the beginning</p>
<p>of the previous century,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of mass controversy then too.</p>
<p>It went back and forth.</p>
<p>And that was actually the source of a lot of distrust</p>
<p>there too.</p>
<p>So, and then look at influenza,</p>
<p>like how is it effective with that?</p>
<p>And just reveal this, we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but like with some probability,</p>
<p>this is the best option we got currently.</p>
<p>And then in a month or two, adjust it,</p>
<p>saying that, you know what,</p>
<p>our like uncertainty decreased a little bit.</p>
<p>We have a better idea.</p>
<p>Like that was an incorrect estimate,</p>
<p>but reveal that you&rsquo;re struggling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like this weird binary clock</p>
<p>that goes one direction or the other.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re struggling with uncertainty.</p>
<p>And like trusting,</p>
<p>people maybe criticize me sometimes for this,</p>
<p>but I think most people are actually intelligent.</p>
<p>Like trusting the public to be intelligent</p>
<p>with if you give them, if you have transparent</p>
<p>and give them information in a real authentic way,</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;re hiding something.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re intelligent enough to use that data</p>
<p>to make decisions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing as with the testing,</p>
<p>is if you put that power in the people&rsquo;s hands</p>
<p>to know if they&rsquo;re sick or not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna make unmasked the right decision, I think.</p>
<p>The masks and the testing has been a bit heartbreaking.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good point though,</p>
<p>that most people don&rsquo;t seem to have an objection</p>
<p>to testing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>And then obviously Macamina makes that point brilliantly.</p>
<p>And still there&rsquo;s very little excitement around that.</p>
<p>But he said he was going to do it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I mean, I haven&rsquo;t spoken to him since then.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pushing it.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, but he can&rsquo;t do it alone.</p>
<p>He has to get, so one of the resistances,</p>
<p>FDA doesn&rsquo;t like cheap things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna approve it.</p>
<p>So they makes the mass manufacture</p>
<p>like with the emergency exceptions,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things very difficult.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s not much money to be made on it</p>
<p>without that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just economic pressures against it.</p>
<p>And because so much investment was placed on the vaccines</p>
<p>and obviously there&rsquo;s an incentive mechanism there</p>
<p>where the companies, lobbyists and all those,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this machine that says arguing for tests</p>
<p>is difficult because the thing that&rsquo;s worked</p>
<p>for most severe viruses in the past is vaccines.</p>
<p>Now we have vaccines.</p>
<p>Why the hell would you need tests?</p>
<p>At that time, like why the hell do you need tests</p>
<p>when we can be working on vaccines?</p>
<p>It seems like the obvious thing to be working</p>
<p>is the vaccines from their perspective,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not obvious at all to me.</p>
<p>I think you should have both.</p>
<p>I think have vaccines and good testing</p>
<p>and that covers you really well</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re always gonna have people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t get vaccinated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve been paying attention to this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy named Brett Weinstein.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy named Sam Harris.</p>
<p>They have good representation.</p>
<p>I would say of two sides of a perspective on the vaccine.</p>
<p>So from Sam Harris&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obvious that everybody should get vaccinated</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s irresponsible to not get vaccinated.</p>
<p>I think he represents a lot of people&rsquo;s belief in that.</p>
<p>And then Brett talks a lot about ivermectin,</p>
<p>but also talks about hesitancy towards the vaccine</p>
<p>for people who are healthy,</p>
<p>for people who are younger, that kind of thing,</p>
<p>and saying we should consider longterm effects</p>
<p>of the vaccine in making this calculation.</p>
<p>What do you make about this conversation?</p>
<p>Some of it happens on Twitter.</p>
<p>Some of it happens in the space of podcasts.</p>
<p>Do you pay attention to this kind of thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your role in this?</p>
<p>What do you hope is the way to resolve this conversation?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s healthy?</p>
<p>Well, a conversation is always healthy,</p>
<p>but to make definitive statements is not</p>
<p>because it suggests you have information that you don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So we talked about longterm effects.</p>
<p>I think you need to balance those versus longterm effects</p>
<p>of the disease and you can make your decision.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to tell everybody to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>I think you need to present the case.</p>
<p>You say, here, we made good vaccines.</p>
<p>Here are the safety profile.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the risk benefit balance.</p>
<p>And you should decide.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a smart person.</p>
<p>You should decide.</p>
<p>Now, companies are gonna do differently, right?</p>
<p>Companies may say you have to be vaccinated to work here.</p>
<p>My employer, Columbia, said we have to be vaccinated</p>
<p>to work in the fall.</p>
<p>And if you wanna be a student, you have to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>So you decide whether you wanna go or not.</p>
<p>But the idea that you should make a decision</p>
<p>based on longterm effects, there is no evidence, right?</p>
<p>So how can you make a decision</p>
<p>when we don&rsquo;t have evidence,</p>
<p>whereas we do have evidence</p>
<p>that there are longterm effects of getting COVID?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a fair argument</p>
<p>and it just makes people scared to say that.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, for someone to say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a no brainer and to denigrate people</p>
<p>for not being vaccinated, that&rsquo;s not the approach either</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna dig in and say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing this because you tell me to, right?</p>
<p>I think the middle ground is to say,</p>
<p>take a bit of both and say, here are the potential issues</p>
<p>and here are the benefits and this is what I would do.</p>
<p>And you have to just decide on your own.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d leave it to them.</p>
<p>I say, you decide.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t want to, it&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll probably get infected at some point</p>
<p>and maybe you&rsquo;ll be okay.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the best available data</p>
<p>and it looks like the vaccines are pretty damn smart solution.</p>
<p>They seem to work.</p>
<p>I think you tell people what you did</p>
<p>and present both sides calmly.</p>
<p>And I think digging in, like in a debate,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s terribly useful.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my view.</p>
<p>I mean, people come to me all the time and ask me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried, what should I do?</p>
<p>And I say, what are you worried about?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about it and go through it calmly.</p>
<p>And if they want to still take ivermectin,</p>
<p>I say, it&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s your choice.</p>
<p>And I have a problem with that.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I love that&rsquo;s the way you think.</p>
<p>People should definitely listen to This Week in Virology</p>
<p>and follow your work, it&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying it lately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s my favorite way to stay in touch</p>
<p>with the happenings of COVID.</p>
<p>Obviously you put in a lot of other stuff in there, but.</p>
<p>We used to do other viruses before COVID.</p>
<p>It was quite interesting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to slip other viruses in</p>
<p>because I think they&rsquo;re informative in many ways.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna do more and more of that.</p>
<p>But I have to say I canceled,</p>
<p>usually I record on Tuesday and Friday</p>
<p>and I canceled today so I could be with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor, I appreciate that.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I think a couple of other people were gonna be away anyway.</p>
<p>So I do a lot of different pods.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all on YouTube, but I also do a live stream</p>
<p>on Wednesday nights on YouTube, which you can find.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where people can come and ask questions.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have an agenda.</p>
<p>We just start and by 30 minutes in,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 700 people with questions</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t even get through</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many of them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m actually astounded</p>
<p>that so many people have really good questions.</p>
<p>Most of them are reasonable and they come back every week.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s turning into a great forum</p>
<p>to have a nice discussion.</p>
<p>And the YouTube channel is called what?</p>
<p>So you could search for my name,</p>
<p>which is Vincent Racaniello, it&rsquo;ll turn up.</p>
<p>Or my handle on YouTube is ProfVRR, P R O F V R R.</p>
<p>Have you read The Plague by Camus by any chance?</p>
<p>Years ago, years ago.</p>
<p>I have to read it again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really relevant.</p>
<p>Let me sort of ask you a question about it.</p>
<p>It describes a town that&rsquo;s overtaken by a plague</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s blocked off from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And it kind of reveals the best, the worst of human nature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like how people respond to that.</p>
<p>Sort of the encroaching, their own mortality,</p>
<p>their own death on the horizon.</p>
<p>I think one of the messages in the book</p>
<p>that ultimately like love for others.</p>
<p>So like a lot of people want to become isolated</p>
<p>and they hide from each other,</p>
<p>but ultimately the thing that saves you is love,</p>
<p>which is one of the things of just watching this pandemic,</p>
<p>with the distance, with the masks, that&rsquo;s all fine.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a distancing from people of that tension,</p>
<p>the breaking of the common humanity between people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons when I came to Austin</p>
<p>earlier this year just to visit,</p>
<p>I fell in love with the city</p>
<p>because even with the masks and the distance,</p>
<p>there was still a camaraderie, like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>just a love for each other,</p>
<p>just a kindness towards each other.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I took away from The Plague.</p>
<p>Mostly it&rsquo;s told to the story of the doctor</p>
<p>who basically gives in</p>
<p>and just gives himself as a service to others.</p>
<p>And that love is the thing that liberates him</p>
<p>from his own conception of mortality,</p>
<p>the fact that he&rsquo;s here, he&rsquo;s going to die.</p>
<p>What do you think about the effect of the virus?</p>
<p>We talked a lot about biology,</p>
<p>but the effect of the virus</p>
<p>on the fabric of the common humanity that connects us.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what a pandemic does.</p>
<p>It really cuts that, right?</p>
<p>Because small outbreaks, they&rsquo;re local,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have global effects.</p>
<p>But when you have something this big</p>
<p>where pretty much nobody escapes,</p>
<p>and not just making people sick,</p>
<p>it changes your life, right?</p>
<p>People lose jobs, they change jobs,</p>
<p>they move somewhere else.</p>
<p>They have all kinds of disruptions.</p>
<p>You know, kids can&rsquo;t go to school.</p>
<p>It really shows you.</p>
<p>I mean, I always like to say,</p>
<p>a tiny virus can bring Earth to its knees.</p>
<p>A tiny virus that you can&rsquo;t even see them,</p>
<p>that most people don&rsquo;t even think about most of the time.</p>
<p>And the real effect is not just sickness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what it does to people.</p>
<p>Because in the end, we are animals,</p>
<p>and most animals like each other, and they interact,</p>
<p>they have great social structures,</p>
<p>and that makes them do well.</p>
<p>And I guess the exception is people in AI, right?</p>
<p>They could be on their own.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why you build robots,</p>
<p>that you fall in love with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so I think when a,</p>
<p>the real story is what it does to society, for sure.</p>
<p>Which has ramifications way beyond</p>
<p>the number of people dying,</p>
<p>and the vaccines, and the tests, and all of that.</p>
<p>And this one has really made a big rupture.</p>
<p>And you could tell, not now so much,</p>
<p>I think being out and about now,</p>
<p>things look pretty normal,</p>
<p>except for some people wearing masks.</p>
<p>You would never know.</p>
<p>I mean, the airport this morning was completely jammed.</p>
<p>People going, and they&rsquo;re all on vacation,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all wearing shorts, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re back to normal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s August.</p>
<p>But last year is really different.</p>
<p>In New York, where you&rsquo;re used</p>
<p>to lots of people on the street, it was eerie.</p>
<p>It was just quiet.</p>
<p>But under it all, people are still,</p>
<p>most people help each other when they have to, right?</p>
<p>Most people are willing to,</p>
<p>if something happens to someone,</p>
<p>to reach out and help them.</p>
<p>There are always exceptions where people are mean,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just the way animals are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not the only ones that can be mean to our own species.</p>
<p>But I think most of the motivation</p>
<p>for everything that was done is to help other people.</p>
<p>I mean, I do think that the vaccine manufacturers,</p>
<p>maybe not the leaders, but the people working in the labs</p>
<p>really wanted to get this out quickly</p>
<p>and help people, right?</p>
<p>I think at every level, people who are contributing</p>
<p>really wanted to help other people</p>
<p>and feel proud that they&rsquo;re able to do that.</p>
<p>So I view it as we&rsquo;re never gonna be 100% good</p>
<p>because animals are not.</p>
<p>Evolution made us, I mean, we&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>We somehow rose above by having incredible brain</p>
<p>and so forth, but a lot of our base instincts</p>
<p>are animals, and they chase each other</p>
<p>and have alpha males and all that stuff,</p>
<p>and we always have a little bit of that in us.</p>
<p>But we do have some humanity</p>
<p>that this really ripped up, it really did.</p>
<p>And I think for me, someone who studied viruses</p>
<p>for over 40 years, it&rsquo;s just amazing</p>
<p>that an invisible thing can do that, right?</p>
<p>It goes back to the thing you found fascinating,</p>
<p>which is a virus affecting human behavior.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Or behavior of the organism.</p>
<p>Yes, so humans can make weapons and do harm</p>
<p>and you can see that, but this you can&rsquo;t even see.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, and look what it has done.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll do it again, there&rsquo;ll be more.</p>
<p>I just, I wish we would be more prepared</p>
<p>because we know what to do.</p>
<p>We know we should be making antivirals vaccines,</p>
<p>masks, testing masks, making test modalities</p>
<p>that we can really quickly redesign.</p>
<p>But after SARS one, all that went out the door.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t do anything,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re in this situation.</p>
<p>So people ask me this all the time,</p>
<p>are we gonna be ready for the next one?</p>
<p>And I always say, we should be.</p>
<p>We have all the information we need to know what to do.</p>
<p>But somehow I think people forget.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes we really step up</p>
<p>when the tragedies run in front of us.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>When the catastrophe.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, somehow humans have still survived.</p>
<p>The fact that we had nuclear weapons for so many decades</p>
<p>and we still have not blown each other up,</p>
<p>whether by terrorists or by nation is quite surprising.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always, after reading the Pentagon Papers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even more amazing, right?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how we do it.</p>
<p>I tend to believe there&rsquo;s that at the surface,</p>
<p>you notice the greed, the corruption, the evil,</p>
<p>but the core of human nature, the human spirit</p>
<p>is one in the scientific realm is curiosity,</p>
<p>and more deeply is kindness, compassion,</p>
<p>and wanting to do good for the world.</p>
<p>I believe that desire to do good outpowers</p>
<p>all the other stuff by a large amount.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have not yet destroyed ourselves.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of bickering.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of wars on the surface,</p>
<p>but underneath it all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this ocean of love for each other.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s an evolutionary advantage to that.</p>
<p>And it would be a good explanation</p>
<p>why we still haven&rsquo;t destroyed ourselves.</p>
<p>God, we had so many opportunities.</p>
<p>If you look at all the wars in history, so many.</p>
<p>I was just, my son was telling me</p>
<p>about the Ottoman Empire, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just war after war,</p>
<p>and then other countries splitting up countries</p>
<p>with no regard to who&rsquo;s living where, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, how can these people do this?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Human history is fascinating,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re still young as a species.</p>
<p>We have a lot more time to go,</p>
<p>and a lot more ways to destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>Do you have advice?</p>
<p>Like you said, you have many decades of research</p>
<p>and an incredible career and life.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people about career,</p>
<p>about life, people in high school, people in college,</p>
<p>of how to live a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>So what I like to do is tell people,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t plan it, because I didn&rsquo;t plan anything.</p>
<p>Everything I did was one step at a time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to plan.</p>
<p>I just found things that were interesting to me.</p>
<p>And so my father was a doctor,</p>
<p>and he wanted me to be a doctor,</p>
<p>but I was not interested in taking care of people.</p>
<p>I learned that, but I couldn&rsquo;t say no to him.</p>
<p>So I was a biology major in college,</p>
<p>and I graduated, and I didn&rsquo;t have anything to do.</p>
<p>So I liked science, so I got a job in a lab.</p>
<p>And it was very exciting,</p>
<p>and that led to everything else</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve done one step at a time.</p>
<p>And I think the most important thing you can do,</p>
<p>well, there are two important things.</p>
<p>You can be really curious all the time.</p>
<p>You mentioned curiosity.</p>
<p>I think curiosity is essential.</p>
<p>You have to be curious about everything.</p>
<p>And if you are, you&rsquo;re never gonna be bored.</p>
<p>And so people who say they&rsquo;re bored,</p>
<p>I say, you are not curious.</p>
<p>You should just think about things</p>
<p>and say, look at something and say, how does that work?</p>
<p>Or what is it doing, and how do they get there?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll never be bored.</p>
<p>And the other thing is when you find something,</p>
<p>which may take time, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You have to be passionate about it.</p>
<p>You have to put everything into it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I did with viruses.</p>
<p>So I think they&rsquo;re amazing.</p>
<p>And I tell my classes, I love viruses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re amazing, and people think I&rsquo;m morbid</p>
<p>because obviously they kill people,</p>
<p>and I shouldn&rsquo;t love something.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I mean.</p>
<p>I love them in the way they have emerged</p>
<p>and how they work and so forth</p>
<p>and all that we don&rsquo;t know about them.</p>
<p>So you need to be curious and passionate,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t plan too much.</p>
<p>And just find something that you don&rsquo;t call a job.</p>
<p>As someone said on the livestream last week,</p>
<p>I wish I had a job I liked as much as you.</p>
<p>I said, it&rsquo;s not a job.</p>
<p>I never looked at it as a job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my vocation, it&rsquo;s my passion.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a job, then you&rsquo;re not gonna like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, something that doesn&rsquo;t feel like a job.</p>
<p>So you said viruses are kind of passive,</p>
<p>nonliving, you could say, or even cells are passive.</p>
<p>And humans are kind of active.</p>
<p>We seem to be making our own decisions.</p>
<p>So let me ask you the why question.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this life of ours?</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s no meaning.</p>
<p>It just happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an accident.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no life elsewhere</p>
<p>because this is just a rare accident</p>
<p>that happened in the right conditions.</p>
<p>I mean, people all think I&rsquo;m wrong</p>
<p>because there are billions and billions</p>
<p>of stars out there, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no meaning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, what do they call it?</p>
<p>A perfect storm of events</p>
<p>that led to molecules being formed.</p>
<p>And eventually, I mean, it took a long time</p>
<p>for life to evolve, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just driven by conditions.</p>
<p>If something emerged that worked,</p>
<p>it would then go on to the next step.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no meaning other than that.</p>
<p>The only difference is that we,</p>
<p>and I think many other animals can probably,</p>
<p>we have the ability, we&rsquo;re sentient, right?</p>
<p>We can influence what happens to us.</p>
<p>We can take medicines, right?</p>
<p>We can alter what would normally happen to us.</p>
<p>So we can remove some of the selection pressure.</p>
<p>But I think everything else on the planet</p>
<p>just goes, looks for food and give a lot of offspring</p>
<p>so you can perpetuate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a natural biological function.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re much more directly concerned with survival.</p>
<p>I think humans are able to contemplate their mortality.</p>
<p>We can see that even if we&rsquo;re okay today,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re eventually going to die</p>
<p>and we really don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>So we try to come up with ways to push that deadline</p>
<p>farther and farther away.</p>
<p>Well, we have really, I mean,</p>
<p>we used to die in our 30s, right?</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s 70s, 80s.</p>
<p>Well, most of us used to die in the first few weeks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah, infant death.</p>
<p>I always tell people the only thing that&rsquo;s 100% is death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only thing in the world that&rsquo;s 100%.</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>No, I never think about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just enjoying day to day and I don&rsquo;t think about it.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>You work on viruses.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t contemplate your own mortality</p>
<p>given the deadliness of the viruses around us?</p>
<p>I never thought COVID would kill me.</p>
<p>No, I never was afraid of that.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>I mostly feared for other people getting sick,</p>
<p>especially people who could die of it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want that to happen to them.</p>
<p>But I always thought that it&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>not a realistic viewpoint not to be worried</p>
<p>because many people are.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been relatively healthy.</p>
<p>They should sequence my genome because it works really well</p>
<p>and I have a good immune system.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;d be the first immortal person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be a first.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think that biologically you just can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the ends of our chromosomes keep getting</p>
<p>shorter and shorter and that&rsquo;s eventually what kills us.</p>
<p>So you just can&rsquo;t keep going on.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s fine, I don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>I understand from the vampires</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not good to live forever.</p>
<p>I guess make the most of the time you got.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, bacteria live a much shorter time</p>
<p>so we got that on bacteria.</p>
<p>Bacteria are just little bags of chemicals that split.</p>
<p>So they have no stake in the matter at all.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t bother.</p>
<p>I think that you have to go a long ways</p>
<p>before you get into some kind of consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird that this bag of chemicals</p>
<p>has a stake in the matter.</p>
<p>Like our human body, consciousness is a weird thing.</p>
<p>Not just in us, but they make half of the oxygen</p>
<p>on the planet.</p>
<p>20% of the oxygen comes from bacteria.</p>
<p>And they made, in the beginning of Earth,</p>
<p>they made enough oxygen to start oxygenation going,</p>
<p>life going.</p>
<p>I mean, they have an incredible role.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all an accident, just happened.</p>
<p>Well, Vincent, like I told you, I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big honor that you would talk to me today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for coming down.</p>
<p>Thank you for spending so much time with me.</p>
<p>And thank you for everything you do</p>
<p>in terms of educating about viruses,</p>
<p>about biology, microbiology, and everything else.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Everybody should check out Vincent&rsquo;s YouTube,</p>
<p>watch his lectures, listen to the podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly incredible.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me, Vincent.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Vincent Racaniello.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Isaac Asimov.</p>
<p>The saddest aspect of life right now</p>
<p>is that science gathers knowledge</p>
<p>faster than society gathers wisdom.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
