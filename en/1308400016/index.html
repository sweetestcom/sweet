    <p>Hi friends this week we&rsquo;re talking about when the motherfucker tries to come back</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a best friend or a friend that you cut off because they did some fuck shit</p>
<p>Or if it&rsquo;s an ex like you broke up with somebody and they want to come back</p>
<p>Or just like a sneaky link or like anything like anytime somebody tries to come back in your life</p>
<p>This is the shit that you need to know and even if you&rsquo;re like ah Leo. I&rsquo;m a skip this week</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anybody trying to come back</p>
<p>Maybe one day you will and maybe one of your friends is gonna have an ex try to come back</p>
<p>And this is all the shit that you can tell them so you could sound real smart. You know</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s jump right into it. So I got like a list. I got a whole bunch of bullet points like I have at least</p>
<p>Like 12, so let&rsquo;s just go with it</p>
<p>So the first thing when someone tries to come back they&rsquo;re gonna be on there like their best behavior typically like with an ex</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just use like a dating example</p>
<p>When you have your ex try to come back after you left they asked you dusted their fucking ass and now they&rsquo;re trying to come back</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna act on their best behavior</p>
<p>And if you complained about certain things</p>
<p>While you were with them and you tried to get them to change certain behaviors or stop doing this that and the other</p>
<p>When they come back if they all of a sudden fix all of the behaviors you had been bitching about previously</p>
<p>That reveals they knew what to do the entire fucking time</p>
<p>They just ratted on their self that they heard you they understood what you were complaining about</p>
<p>They were choosing not to change their behavior when they were with you now all of a sudden they want to come back and act</p>
<p>Like mr. Perfect, so that just they just ratted their self out because they knew how to fucking behave before they knew how to act</p>
<p>They knew how to treat you before but they just weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>So that should be your first red flag and if someone does this shit to you</p>
<p>You should cut them off and never speak to them again. Sorry</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna like pull that card out because motherfucker</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna gaslight me this whole time</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re together and pretend like you don&rsquo;t know what the fuck is going on and you&rsquo;re gonna make</p>
<p>excuses for the way that you&rsquo;re treating me and you&rsquo;re not gonna change certain things when I ask you and</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re gonna come back after I leave your dumb ass and then try and be mr. Perfect. No get fucked get lost</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your first</p>
<p>Absolutely cut them off. Okay, and let this be reassurance that it&rsquo;s okay to do that</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the biggest fuck you that someone can do is like treats you like shit</p>
<p>And then you leave them and then you leaving them is what makes them treat you nice. Fuck that fuck this individual</p>
<p>Get rid of them. They got some growing up to do</p>
<p>They got some fucking learning to do and don&rsquo;t reward that behavior because as soon as you take them back or you give into it</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna flip right back to who they were they it&rsquo;s called a bait and switch</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna pretend to be a certain way to bait you and then as soon as they hook you they&rsquo;re gonna switch up and go</p>
<p>Right back to who they fucking were</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fall for it. And I do have kind of a test that you can do to see if someone is</p>
<p>Actually like gonna change so like if they do some fucked up shit and they come back to you and they try to like apologize</p>
<p>And they try to like create resolve if they genuinely understand</p>
<p>How what they did hurt you?</p>
<p>They are not gonna expect you to forgive them and jump back to them immediately</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna understand that you don&rsquo;t trust them anymore. You&rsquo;re scared of them. They just hurt you</p>
<p>So the test is like if they get mad, so if you&rsquo;re like, okay, I&rsquo;m willing to hear you out</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to like work on things and see where things are gonna go, but I&rsquo;m not gonna put a label on it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to jump back into dating you</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to jump back into none of that shit</p>
<p>like I want to try and see if we can work this out without like fully getting back invested with you if</p>
<p>They get mad at that</p>
<p>Run, that&rsquo;s the fucking shit. I&rsquo;m talking about they&rsquo;re gonna bait and switch you if they genuinely understand how they hurt you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be fine with going forward with no label. They&rsquo;ll be fine with working through what they did and creating actual repair</p>
<p>but if they just expect to come back and be nice to you and say all the right things and</p>
<p>Instantly, you&rsquo;re gonna just like switch and commit to them again and like, oh, we&rsquo;re back together. We&rsquo;re back dating</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not how shit works and</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not actually like aware of how bad they hurt you or like the reason that you broke up with them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna change. They don&rsquo;t get it. They don&rsquo;t see it because they couldn&rsquo;t expect you</p>
<p>To jump back into a relationship with them if they saw how hurt you were</p>
<p>They would understand you&rsquo;re like standoffish</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a kicked puppy if you kick the fuck out of a dog and then it acts scared of you to come up to</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be shocked. You&rsquo;re gonna be like no shit. It&rsquo;s scared of me</p>
<p>I just kicked the fuck out of it</p>
<p>But if they get mad at you for being a kicked puppy and you act scared of them if they get mad that you act</p>
<p>Scared there&rsquo;s a huge disconnect and they&rsquo;re very unaware. They don&rsquo;t get it. They don&rsquo;t see how their actions affected you</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t see how they hurt you and they&rsquo;re gonna do it again</p>
<p>So another test kind of for the situation is</p>
<p>If someone fucks up and they realize that they fucked up when they come back to you to like create repair and resolve</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna be offering to do things</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna be offering to do things to give you reassurance to feel safe to trust them again</p>
<p>Repairing things with you will not feel like a chore. They will not make you feel like a bother</p>
<p>They will not make you feel like an inconvenience. It will be</p>
<p>like understandable to them and they will want to</p>
<p>Repair things with you so they will want to do what it takes to make you trust them again. They&rsquo;ll be fine with</p>
<p>Re-establishing trust and building the fucking blocks of it again. They&rsquo;re not gonna be annoyed with you. I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want to say they&rsquo;ll be eager to fix things, but they&rsquo;ll be very understanding if you want to take it slow</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll understand they&rsquo;re not gonna give you shit. They&rsquo;re not gonna like attack you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna make you feel stupid for not trusting them. They&rsquo;re not gonna call you an idiot</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna threaten to leave you because you don&rsquo;t instantly just jump back into shit with them. Okay?</p>
<p>So those are some things to look for. Oh</p>
<p>One more point when they are putting in the effort to repair things with you and establish trust again</p>
<p>They are not gonna be expecting praise</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna be expecting for you to like be eating their fucking ass and like praising them like oh my god</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the puppy like the kicked puppy if they kick you and then they come over to you and they hug you and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>Oh my god. I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to praise them for that. You don&rsquo;t need to be like, oh my god</p>
<p>Thank you for coming over here and consoling me after you just kicked the fuck out of me</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re not gonna need to be encouraged. That&rsquo;s a big thing. That&rsquo;s it right there. I just came to my head</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna need to be encouraged. They&rsquo;re not gonna need praise. They&rsquo;re not gonna need a fucking</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s expected shithead like when you fuck up you fix it</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not gonna need praise for fixing it</p>
<p>if someone is genuinely fixing it because they want to</p>
<p>Now if someone has the motive of like all they want to do is just get you back</p>
<p>Anything they do that doesn&rsquo;t make them feel like they&rsquo;re getting toward that goal is gonna aggravate them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna get fucking pissed because them leaving you like even if someone treated you like shit</p>
<p>You are so much more important to them than you even realize you&rsquo;re giving them so much more safety and security and like they&rsquo;re attached to</p>
<p>You in a way that you don&rsquo;t even realize even if they treat you like shit. I know it&rsquo;s hard to hear but</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like they&rsquo;re attached to you more than you fucking realize</p>
<p>So when you leave them when you finally leave them, it&rsquo;s gonna make them like anxious and they&rsquo;re gonna be fucked up</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna know what to do</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just gonna know that they don&rsquo;t feel good and they want you back like for whatever fucking reason</p>
<p>so when they come after you all they want back is that safety and security blanket and they want that reassurance that like everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s like some childish fucking</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t raised properly things didn&rsquo;t form right in their frontal lobe their reasoning processes like shit just didn&rsquo;t form for them</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably very immature</p>
<p>But this is what they&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>This is how they&rsquo;re gonna behave so it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the way that you can tell the difference between</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s genuinely trying to rekindle things with you and repair things versus someone who&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Anxiously just wants to get you back because they don&rsquo;t like the way that they feel</p>
<p>After losing you and like I said like someone that comes back and genuinely cares</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not gonna be any expectations with their actions like the kicked puppy</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re supposed to walk over to a puppy after you fucking kick it if you did kick it back</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re supposed to console it you&rsquo;re supposed to do all that</p>
<p>But when if I accident like when I accidentally step on cat because I step on her all the fucking time</p>
<p>I immediately run over to her and I grab her and I hug her I like make sure she&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll like hug her and be like I&rsquo;m sorry yada yada</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll like sweet-talk her little fucking ass because I feel bad. I don&rsquo;t expect</p>
<p>Anything for that. I don&rsquo;t expect shit</p>
<p>so if someone is coming to you and</p>
<p>Like behaving a certain way and there&rsquo;s an expectation behind it like oh, we&rsquo;re gonna fuck after I say</p>
<p>Sorry, or oh, I&rsquo;m gonna get like you&rsquo;re gonna recommit to me after I say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry ooh like and then they don&rsquo;t get that they&rsquo;re gonna freak out, but someone that&rsquo;s genuinely</p>
<p>Doing it they&rsquo;re not gonna expect anything</p>
<p>For them coming to you and trying to repair the situation or say that they&rsquo;re sorry like they&rsquo;re just gonna get it</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not like that&rsquo;s the whole thing about why I don&rsquo;t like people saying. Sorry</p>
<p>I throw around the word sorry and like a joking way, but you will never fucking hear me say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry in a serious sense because I don&rsquo;t need to fucking say that when I come to someone that I realized</p>
<p>My actions affected in a negative way. I&rsquo;m not coming to you for a fucking forgiveness. I don&rsquo;t need you to forgive me</p>
<p>I just want to</p>
<p>Explain my perspective and explain what&rsquo;s going on and share with you that I understand how I hurt you</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna come and share all this shit with you</p>
<p>To hopefully make some kind of repair and to make you feel better</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect anything for it if you don&rsquo;t want to take me back. I&rsquo;m not gonna be mad at you because I get it</p>
<p>Do you see how that&rsquo;s a fully different energy that&rsquo;s a whole different feeling</p>
<p>Versus someone coming to you if it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m gonna say all these things. Oh, and then I want you to get back with me</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like no you can tell when it&rsquo;s genuine because there&rsquo;s no expectations attached</p>
<p>And if there you feel like there are expectations attached, they don&rsquo;t get it. Okay, they can hope for things. They can hope that</p>
<p>You will like want to take with him back or whatever, but they&rsquo;re not gonna expect it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two different tastes in your mouth when you hear it, you&rsquo;ll know it. Okay, you&rsquo;re aware</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re listening to aware and aggravated you get it bitch and the rest of the things that I say in this you&rsquo;re really gonna be</p>
<p>Able to spot it</p>
<p>Okay. My next point is if someone does something</p>
<p>Severely fucked up to you if they break your trust in a big way if they disrespect you in a big way</p>
<p>If you forgive them and take them back</p>
<p>They will never respect you I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t make the fucking rules</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way it is. You can get mad at me, but we both know it&rsquo;s the truth bitch</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here as a friend telling you this</p>
<p>but if someone does something really fucked up to you and then they can come like if someone cheats on you and then they</p>
<p>Come to you and they can convince you</p>
<p>To get back with them whether it takes them a month and you finally like cave and you get back with them or you give</p>
<p>Them another chance or whatever it is. You have now shown them you can be manipulated and you can be fucked on and</p>
<p>gotten back</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna be scared of anything because if they can do something severe enough like fuck another person while they&rsquo;re dating you and</p>
<p>You will still take them back. They have this new confidence that you will never fucking leave them</p>
<p>They will never lose you because they just weaseled their way back in they just got the fuck back in</p>
<p>So you just gave them a reassurance that you will never get from them</p>
<p>Because typically if you&rsquo;re the one forgiving someone you&rsquo;re not doing fucked-up shit. So I&rsquo;m just throwing that out but</p>
<p>If they do something really really bad to you, it sucks, but you have to</p>
<p>Realize that you can&rsquo;t forgive it. Like sometimes there is no forgiveness. I don&rsquo;t believe in forgiveness</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about that before on this pocket. We&rsquo;ve talked about it, bitch. I&rsquo;ve talked about it. I act like we&rsquo;re having a conversation</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how I feel. I did ask for like I&rsquo;m talking to like my bestie when I&rsquo;m fucking making this podcast</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so funny</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>Yeah, like sometimes people shouldn&rsquo;t be forgiven</p>
<p>Sometimes people&rsquo;s actions are too damaging to even be able to create repair and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with not forgiving someone</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s not preached in social media and that&rsquo;s not preached in like this new generation</p>
<p>But forgiveness isn&rsquo;t always deserved. You don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to forgive fucking anybody for anything if you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>But the main point I need to drill into people</p>
<p>And I had to do it into myself for a long time is if you let shit go you will never be respected</p>
<p>They will do it again</p>
<p>If you show someone that you will put up with and allow being disrespected</p>
<p>in a certain way</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pathetic</p>
<p>Honestly, and i&rsquo;m able to stand here and say that because I was the pathetic one for so long. I let</p>
<p>so much</p>
<p>fucking shit</p>
<p>slide</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>previous relationships</p>
<p>I know I said i&rsquo;ve only been in one but in order to clear myself legally i&rsquo;m gonna have to say multiple</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s just pretend but I</p>
<p>Let so much shit slide I should have never</p>
<p>fucking put up with</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, like disgusted looking back on the shit that I let go</p>
<p>Not on like the person didn&rsquo;t deserve it, but how fucking disrespectful it was to myself. I was disrespecting the living shit out of myself</p>
<p>to continue</p>
<p>In the relationships I was in and with the people I was in even with friendships like I actually can say</p>
<p>Relationships because fucking everybody like the shit that I used to put up with is so fucking degrading like absolutely not</p>
<p>Absolutely the fuck not do not ever</p>
<p>Take someone back that cheats on you that betrays you that does some fucked up ass shit</p>
<p>You will never feel safe with them again</p>
<p>You will never feel secure trust cannot be rebuilt. I&rsquo;m mad bitch</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking mad as you can tell but trust cannot be rebuilt from some things</p>
<p>Some things just break it and it&rsquo;s fucking broken</p>
<p>Trust is like a vase if you shatter the fucker. Good luck</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never rebuilding it. There is no rebuilding it</p>
<p>Now if you chip off a couple pieces of the vase you can put them back on that&rsquo;s saveable</p>
<p>But to fully be able to like have the vase again after you shatter the fucker</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not happening some situations trust is too broken to be rebuilt. I don&rsquo;t care what you do</p>
<p>If you cheat on me once</p>
<p>I will i&rsquo;m already gonna be paranoid</p>
<p>About everything that you fucking do in every move you make and every person you talk to that&rsquo;s not me</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s like my fear that you&rsquo;re gonna cheat. So if someone actually does cheat on me</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now been verified like you will do it. You just did it. So for me to try and get back with you</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you act right for 20 fucking years when you say i&rsquo;m gonna go run to the store real quick bitch</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust you. It&rsquo;s always gonna be in the back of my head. Are you really going to fuck someone?</p>
<p>It does not matter how long you try to rebuild it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be rebuilt that little voice will always be back in the back of my head because it&rsquo;s survival</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a you might get fucking betrayed again. That voice don&rsquo;t shut up for me</p>
<p>That voice don&rsquo;t shut up for anybody and anybody that tells you that is a fucking liar</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ll never be able to get that back</p>
<p>You might be able to like pretend but you&rsquo;re always gonna secretly be scared as shit</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always gonna secretly be like looking more into things and going through their phone as you fucking should</p>
<p>Okay, you should always go through your partner&rsquo;s phone. You heard it here fucking first</p>
<p>All right, if someone doesn&rsquo;t let you go through their phone, don&rsquo;t be with them</p>
<p>It goes both ways like why would you why should you not be able to go through your partner&rsquo;s phone?</p>
<p>People spend most of their fucking day on their phone</p>
<p>All of everything you need to know about someone is on their fucking phone</p>
<p>Why would I not want access to that part of you a bitch?</p>
<p>I want to know you fully if i&rsquo;m committing to you</p>
<p>So go through that goddamn fucking phone. You need to find out anything go through that damn phone</p>
<p>Every part of it, okay</p>
<p>Let me get off that where the fuck even was I with this whole topic? I just got off on a damn tangent</p>
<p>Oh about um, if someone does something really really fucked up, you can&rsquo;t take them back. They will never respect you</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll get this like</p>
<p>Reassurance that all right now I can do some fucked up ass shit and you&rsquo;ll take me back like</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll just keep doing worse and worse shit i&rsquo;m sorry to say it but</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happens when you give someone that level of security with you</p>
<p>They know that they can push it. They know that they can like get you back. They&rsquo;re gonna be less</p>
<p>Considerate of you in the way that you feel because they know that you&rsquo;ll always just be there</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;ll always be able to manipulate you and get you back</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t fucking be that put your goddamn foot down on their neck. Don&rsquo;t let them back</p>
<p>My next point with breakups or cutting someone off</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already really fucking hard like the amount of</p>
<p>Convincing it takes for you to finally cut someone off and then to actually go through with it</p>
<p>To like fully break up or cut a friend off or whatever it is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fucking hard to already do it</p>
<p>If you cut someone off</p>
<p>And then you go back to them</p>
<p>However hard it was to cut them off the first time it&rsquo;s going to be harder the next time</p>
<p>So remind yourself of that it&rsquo;s going to take more from you and it&rsquo;s going to be way fucking harder</p>
<p>To cut them off the next time and I really need to talk about embarrassment</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>People are too comfortable running their fucking mouth about the dumb ass shit that they put up with</p>
<p>So if someone is in a toxic relationship and like say you&rsquo;re my friend, okay?</p>
<p>And you run to me and tell me all the fucked up ass shit that your boyfriend is doing to you</p>
<p>babe</p>
<p>You look dumb, okay?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t run your mouth about your partner to anyone</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a fucking rule</p>
<p>Like if someone does some fucked up ass shit and you&rsquo;re gonna let it slide let it slide in your own head</p>
<p>You deal with that one on your own</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re gonna look like a goddamn fool to everybody else and everyone&rsquo;s gonna see how you&rsquo;re willing to disrespect yourself</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna make everyone lose respect for you the way that you&rsquo;re okay with being treated the shit that you&rsquo;re gonna tolerate</p>
<p>So before you go run your fucking mouth to everybody about how your ex was so bad</p>
<p>Make sure you are not going to get back with them because if you</p>
<p>Go run in your mouth</p>
<p>About this person you just broke up with and then a month later you&rsquo;re back with them</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a goddamn idiot. You look like a fucking fool to everybody around you and I know that sounds very harsh</p>
<p>But you need to hear it</p>
<p>I needed to be told this shit too</p>
<p>But like shut your fucking mouth until you are certain and even if you&rsquo;re still in a relationship with somebody watch it</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re when you&rsquo;re with somebody i&rsquo;m very old school. I&rsquo;m very old-fashioned with my beliefs about</p>
<p>Relationships like you should never try to embarrass your partner. You should always try to like uphold their</p>
<p>Sense of respect and self and everything. It&rsquo;s like you want to uphold their image for them</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to make people disrespect them or look down on them</p>
<p>So watch your fucking mouth about what you tell people</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I mean, like I don&rsquo;t like that like people that will just run to their friends and vent about their partner and like talk shit</p>
<p>Like uh, don&rsquo;t you fucking dare do that?</p>
<p>Your partner doesn&rsquo;t deserve that one and two you look like an idiot. All right</p>
<p>Like babe, i&rsquo;m just trying to help you. I&rsquo;m really just trying to help you. Don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>Okay, i&rsquo;m gonna hit back on this topic really quick</p>
<p>If someone tries to come back into your life and they&rsquo;re doing everything right, okay</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, mr. Fucking perfect understand. That&rsquo;s the best they&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>As good as they&rsquo;re being as the best they&rsquo;re gonna get because you act on your best behavior</p>
<p>After you fuck up like when they&rsquo;re trying to win you back, they&rsquo;re gonna be 10 on 10</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna be behaving the best way that they fucking can and if you aren&rsquo;t even satisfied with that you&rsquo;re done bitch</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>you might not have realized it until I just said that but</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re gonna try to act like mr. Perfect. And while they&rsquo;re acting like that if you still don&rsquo;t even like them you&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even consider going back. Let that be your validation</p>
<p>All right, that ain&rsquo;t what the fuck I want because even when you&rsquo;re on 10 for what you&rsquo;re capable of it ain&rsquo;t enough for me</p>
<p>And I want to reassure you that&rsquo;s okay. If someone&rsquo;s best is still not enough for you. That&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re of a different caliber. You deserve more</p>
<p>Re-fucking play that okay skip back right now and listen to that again</p>
<p>Okay. Now I want to give you a couple of tips</p>
<p>and just different perspectives to look at with</p>
<p>these relationships, so</p>
<p>If someone loses you</p>
<p>Okay, why wouldn&rsquo;t they want you back?</p>
<p>Duh, like that&rsquo;s a fucking given like no shit. Why would they not want you back?</p>
<p>Why would they not be chasing after you? Why would they not be trying to come back?</p>
<p>Like they realized what they had they realized what they lost like why the fuck would they not be coming back we get that</p>
<p>But you need to ask yourself. Why do you want them back?</p>
<p>Why would you want them back and especially</p>
<p>Given now the circumstance of if they did something fucked up to you and they broke your trust</p>
<p>They betrayed you whatever it is. They were disloyal whatever it fucking was</p>
<p>Why would you want them back now?</p>
<p>And I am gonna hit on okay logically it&rsquo;s easy to say like I deserve better</p>
<p>But the way that you feel it&rsquo;s like if you feel like you want them back</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s understandable because people can do fucked up ass shit to you and you still just care when you genuinely care for someone</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have an attachment to them and you&rsquo;re gonna want them back no matter what they do</p>
<p>But sometimes you have to govern that little voice inside yourself and be like look I understand that you want it and here cry</p>
<p>Break the fuck down. I will let you cry right now, but you&rsquo;re not going back. Okay, so be sad</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re going and we&rsquo;re getting better for ourself. That&rsquo;s it. You have to govern that little voice inside you and be logical</p>
<p>it fucking sucks and it hurts but</p>
<p>Why the fuck would you want them back?</p>
<p>another thing to ask yourself</p>
<p>If someone does something or betrays you is how many times do I need to be shown?</p>
<p>Like if they just cheated on you or they just talk shit behind your back about you to somebody else</p>
<p>Or they did something like they betrayed you in some way. They stole from you. Whatever it was</p>
<p>They just showed you</p>
<p>Straight the fuck up. They just showed you</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t give a fuck about how you feel. They&rsquo;re not going to consider you. They&rsquo;re fine with disrespecting you</p>
<p>What else do you need to see babe?</p>
<p>Why do you need to have it happen again, why do you need to give them another chance to not fuck you over?</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t have needed the first one in the first place. And that&rsquo;s the reason that I don&rsquo;t fucking ask for forgiveness</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need second chances</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fuck up</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not hard to be a decent human being so don&rsquo;t make no excuse for no bum motherfucker</p>
<p>All right, so I have two more little things to say, okay</p>
<p>How are we liking this podcast so far if you&rsquo;re like in this like send me a dm on instagram. I&rsquo;ll put my</p>
<p>At in the description of this send me a dm what you think what you think thank and thunk</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re in the middle of this bitch drop me a rating leave me a five stars</p>
<p>For being your like best friend that yells at you and tells you all the shit that you need to hear</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t want to hear</p>
<p>I got your back always don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>Okay. So out of my last two points the first one</p>
<p>Is there are so many more people in the world?</p>
<p>than you can even</p>
<p>imagine</p>
<p>And I know when you&rsquo;re like losing a friend or you&rsquo;re in a breakup</p>
<p>Everything feels so small. It feels like that one person is just like oh my god</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s it. Like you feel like there&rsquo;s nobody left for you</p>
<p>Bitch, I can&rsquo;t tell you how many more people are in the world than you can even imagine</p>
<p>And if you are considering going back to someone that treats you like absolute fucking shit or has disrespected you</p>
<p>Enough for you to want to leave</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give up on yourself yet</p>
<p>Go do what is in your ability to meet new people</p>
<p>Go make friends go meet new partners go travel bitch</p>
<p>Go do anything in your control to meet more people before you sit down and tell yourself</p>
<p>This is it. I should just settle no</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so much more capable than you think you deserve so much better than you fucking think</p>
<p>As soon as you start to question do I deserve better you do?</p>
<p>I heard that the other day and I can&rsquo;t fucking stop thinking about it, but that&rsquo;s the truth</p>
<p>So do everything in your power</p>
<p>Do everything you can to meet new people</p>
<p>Anything get the fuck up and go do it, babe</p>
<p>Like you you need to go do that for yourself before you sit down</p>
<p>And just accept defeat and go back to this piece of shit. Okay, the one that you left</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your last option. That&rsquo;s your backup plan. Okay, let them be your fall back</p>
<p>Because the way that they just fucked on you</p>
<p>They can be manipulated back into taking you back. Don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even care if five years fucking goes by the motherfuckers that fuck you over and betray you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always looking for approval. They always want your forgiveness</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be right there when you want to fucking go back if you want to go back</p>
<p>So like I said go find</p>
<p>anyone else</p>
<p>Go do everything you can in your power to meet new friends meet new people get in a new relationship go fucking do it, bitch</p>
<p>like go</p>
<p>Exhaust yourself first before you run back</p>
<p>All right, so i&rsquo;m going to close this bitch out with bringing the little you into it</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Imagine whatever experience you just had or whatever. You just went through with a friend or a partner or whatever it is</p>
<p>Imagine the child version of you that&rsquo;s like six or seven years old</p>
<p>imagine them walking up to you right now</p>
<p>And imagine yourself</p>
<p>Telling them</p>
<p>You deserve to be treated this way. You deserve to be cheated on you deserve to be betrayed</p>
<p>You deserve to be fucked on the way that you just were</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t matter your feelings aren&rsquo;t important. You should choose to go be with someone like this</p>
<p>You should choose to go be with this person that treats you like shit. You deserve it kid</p>
<p>Imagine telling yourself that you feel how fucking bad that feels</p>
<p>That kid is still in you</p>
<p>That little child is always a part of you and always will be</p>
<p>So if you can&rsquo;t find the strength to choose better for your adult self</p>
<p>Choose it for your little self choose to find better for little you because little you is always there</p>
<p>Holy fucking shit</p>
<p>Oh my god, here I am fucking crying</p>
<p>That just hit me</p>
<p>but yeah people</p>
<p>find it really hard to</p>
<p>See their innocence</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re grown like it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;ve been a fucking prostitute or if you&rsquo;ve sold drugs or if you&rsquo;ve fucking murdered somebody you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>a child like you you still have that little innocence and that little purity of like a child and</p>
<p>children deserve to be cared for so like</p>
<p>Please just care for yourself and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Put yourself back in a situation that&rsquo;s fucking bad like just think of little you</p>
<p>Think of little fucking you and what you would do for them</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell them they deserve that fucking shit because they&rsquo;re still in you don&rsquo;t put them through that</p>
<p>Like protect them and choose better for them. If you can&rsquo;t choose better for the adult you right now</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a really good way to bridge that gap</p>
<p>And to help you stay strong is to realize that there&rsquo;s more in you to consider than just you now</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much more about you that is worth protecting and loving</p>
<p>I just have a really soft spot</p>
<p>For children and kids and I will protect them at all fucking costs. That&rsquo;s just how I am</p>
<p>So this analogy really helps me and I have to envision little me a lot</p>
<p>to kind of like get through shit and</p>
<p>Choose the right thing because I have to choose better for him a lot of the time because me who I am now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to just like</p>
<p>Whatever, you know, but when I think of little me, I feel like I have a responsibility now and it&rsquo;s like I have to parent</p>
<p>That kid and like I have to watch out for him and I don&rsquo;t want him to go through</p>
<p>Bad shit because i&rsquo;m fine with going through bad things. I can deal with shit</p>
<p>But to imagine little me having to do it. I want to protect him. So i&rsquo;m I choose better for both of us</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I gave this example</p>
<p>But just remember little you is always inside you</p>
<p>So draw on them when you need to like the strength to</p>
<p>Choose what&rsquo;s good for you</p>
<p>And one more thing it shouldn&rsquo;t take someone losing you</p>
<p>To appreciate you</p>
<p>Or to realize what they had if they didn&rsquo;t see it when they had it. That&rsquo;s not fair to you</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not fucking fair at all</p>
<p>So if you leaving them and now they&rsquo;re like all of a sudden oh my god all these things I miss about you</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too fucking late. I&rsquo;m, sorry</p>
<p>Little you don&rsquo;t deserve that little you doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be in a position where they&rsquo;re unappreciated</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Where it takes you being hurt enough to finally leave someone for them to see you fuck that</p>
<p>That person&rsquo;s not worth you</p>
<p>That person isn&rsquo;t worth having you if they didn&rsquo;t fucking appreciate you</p>
<p>All right. I need to end this episode like that was a lot</p>
<p>Emotionally for me like bitch, sometimes I just be talking and I just like fucking the waterworks just be happening</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare</p>
<p>But this was a very intense topic and it&rsquo;s something that hits very close to home for me</p>
<p>So I hope everything I said in this episode was helpful. I hope you learned something</p>
<p>I hope you choose better for little you</p>
<p>And i&rsquo;m talking to everybody when I say that not just for relationships with fucking everything</p>
<p>But if you want to follow my social media i&rsquo;ll put it all in the description of this podcast</p>
