    <p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> in making and building things it‚Äôs like, when you start, you think that there‚Äôs, like, one right way of doing it and it‚Äôs like, no, there‚Äôs a hundred different ways of doing it. And maybe five of those are really good and 40 of those are really bad. But it‚Äôs like you can ‚Äì there are so many different ways to ‚Äì to skin a cat. But why would you want to skin a cat? (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT</strong>: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Behind the Tech. I‚Äôm your host, Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer for Microsoft.</p>
<p>In this podcast, we‚Äôre going to get behind the tech. We‚Äôll talk with some of the people who have made our modern tech world possible and understand what motivated them to create what they did. So, join me to maybe learn a little bit about the history of computing and get a few behind-the-scenes insights into what‚Äôs happening today. Stick around.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Hello and welcome to Behind the Tech. I‚Äôm cohost, Christina Warren, Senior Developer Advocate at GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> And I‚Äôm Kevin Scott.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> And today, we are talking to Simone Giertz, who is an incredible inventor, roboticist and maker of all kinds.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. Simone has been one of my favorite YouTubers for years. I was so incredibly excited when she agreed to be on the program today. I‚Äôve just wanted to talk to her for a really long time. She is an inspiration to me, as someone who likes to make things. Like, I watch her videos and learn a bunch of things and get inspired about things that I then want to go do myself.</p>
<p>But the thing that I really admire about her is the example that she‚Äôs setting for other people, sort of teaching you that if you, you know, have a little bit of curiosity and determination and you‚Äôre, you know, you let yourself be a little bit fearless, like, you can really do anything.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Now, I know you‚Äôve been a ‚Äì you‚Äôre a huge fan of hers, and I can‚Äôt wait to hear the two of you talk shop, no pun intended.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, awesome.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Simone Giertz is a Swedish inventor maker, robotics enthusiast, TV host, professional YouTuber, and most recently, entrepreneur. She briefly studied engineering physics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and has since built a career creating amazing things and sharing the process of their creation with the world. Giertz builds robots that do all kinds of impractical and funny things, like an alarm clock that slaps the user, a lipstick applier, and famously, a toothbrush helmet that launched her YouTube career. She‚Äôs an inspiration to everyone who follows her.</p>
<p>Simone, thank you so much for joining us today.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Well, so maybe we can start our conversation with your childhood and how you got interested in making.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I mean, for me, it didn‚Äôt really start in my childhood, to be honest. Like, I was always interested in making things, but ‚Äì and I remember, I mean, I studied woodworking in school and stuff like ‚Äì like, I‚Äôm from Sweden and all kids do that and sewing. And I really enjoyed it, and I was always like a very free range kid and kind of just running around and making my own mistakes and trying to figure things out.</p>
<p>But I definitely wasn‚Äôt like a tech whiz kid. Like, my brother was. He was always picking apart computers and learning programming, and I was like, no, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs for me. And then it wasn‚Äôt until I was 23, 24, where I remember it, like, hitting me and being like, ‚Äúwow, this is so cool.‚Äù But I never saw myself as somebody who would think that that stuff was interesting. Yeah, but then once I did, it was just like full force ahead.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Do you remember what the inspiration was, like that moment that you had when you were 23, 24 years old, that made you think, wow, this is something I‚Äôd like to do?</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> You know, I think it‚Äôs, really for me, it‚Äôs the thing that excites me about tools, and I do really think of programming as a tool, is when you realize what you can use it to do. Like, I was never excited about them on their own. It was more like, wait, so you‚Äôre telling me if I learn how to program just, like, basic JavaScript and CSS, then I can make a website where there‚Äôs head ‚Äì like, hair growing out of the screen. And I can turn my cursor into a razor blade and I can shave that fake hair off, you know? So, it was just, for me, it was like ‚Äì it was very much once I realized, like, all the stupid, silly stuff I could do with it, yeah‚Ä¶</p>
<p>But since then, I mean, I haven‚Äôt written a line of code in years. I‚Äôll, like, still write some, like, basic motor program, but that was a couple of years ago. I did code a lot and I was ‚Äì I started getting into electronics and programming mostly Arduinos, but now, I‚Äôm just, like, very hardcore into woodworking and welding and have been enjoying that part of making a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Well, I ‚Äì I‚Äôve watched some of your‚Ä¶ actually, I‚Äôve seen all of your videos. Like, you have no idea how excited I was to be able to get to chat with you. So, I ‚Äì and this must be a weird thing, too. You‚Äôre putting so much of your life there, and you‚Äôve got a complete stranger like me who comes along and, like, wants to ask about how Scraps is doing. And, you know, is that C&amp;C machine still working for you in LA, I mean, like, it‚Äôs weird, right?</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I think, in part, I‚Äôve gotten used to it, but it‚Äôs also like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to say this without sounding cheesy, but I do think that who I am on the Internet is a pretty good representation of who I am in real life. So, it‚Äôs never like, oh, they don‚Äôt know the real me. Like, they ‚Äì like, people who watch my videos do know a side of me.</p>
<p>So, I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs mostly just hard because I‚Äôm like, oh, but I feel guilty because I‚Äôm like, I should know things about you, too. It almost feels like when you‚Äôre like, hanging out with somebody and they remember so many things you said, and you‚Äôre like, I can‚Äôt even remember where you live.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. Well, so I want to really get into the hardcore makery stuff, but I did want to say, like, one of the things that I love so much about how you make your videos is you just allow yourself to be vulnerable on camera. Like, you show the whole process. Like, you get excited about a project, like, stuff doesn‚Äôt work. You get really upset about it not working. Then you, like, stick with it and, like, make it work.</p>
<p>Like, I was, just this past week, I was rewatching the stained glass window video and, like, I‚Äôm going on this journey with you. Like I‚Äôve done so many of these things myself and, like, the water‚Äôs leaking out of this thing. I‚Äôm like, oh my God, I know exactly how that feels. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I mean, it‚Äôs like building is messy and it‚Äôs always, like, frustrating. And then when you do get it to work, it‚Äôs, like, exhilarating. And I think for me, it was always discouraging to watch videos where people just nailed it, because then I would feel like I was doing something wrong, because I‚Äôm like, my builds never feel like that. Like, they‚Äôre always ‚Äì I mean, it‚Äôs, like, the difference between, like, the really beautiful Instagram vacation photo versus, like, what it actually was. And you‚Äôre like, I was kind of cold and hungry and, like, upset with my dad or whatever.</p>
<p>And I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm just trying to be transparent. Plus, like, the thing is, when bad things happen in builds, I‚Äôm always ‚Äì I get so annoyed with it. But then when I‚Äôm editing the footage, I‚Äôm always kind of happy that it happened because I‚Äôm like, oh, that‚Äôs where the story is at. And it‚Äôs also like, it is nice to see, like, how I can overcome those adversities. Like, even for myself, I‚Äôm like, yeah, I did solve it and I was really upset and I felt like I wasn‚Äôt going to come around on top. And then I managed to finagle my way through it somehow.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and I don‚Äôt know how you think about it philosophically, about just the whole struggle of making things. Like, being a creator, whether you‚Äôre writing software or making a company or building a project or whatnot, like, there‚Äôs a whole bunch of things that can make that go easier. It‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre curious. It‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre willing to explore. But, like, the thing that you show is that resilience is super important. Like, nothing ever goes perfectly.</p>
<p>And I felt this, you know, the same way when I was a young software engineer. Like, all you ever saw was the computer science paper that someone had written where they got into all of the answers, and you saw none of the process, how they got there. And you just felt so bad about yourself that you‚Äôre imagining how much easier it must have been for everybody else when in reality, it wasn‚Äôt.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> The thing is, I think, yeah, it‚Äôs resilience, but also for me, the reason that I am resilient in these situations is because I‚Äôm so genuinely excited about what I‚Äôm doing. If I wasn‚Äôt pumped about it, then I‚Äôd be like, whatever. I‚Äôll just move on and, like, go play video games instead. But since I‚Äôm like, I really want to pursue this and push it through and, like, make this build come to life, I think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs making me resilient. And also just because I think I am really stubborn.</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm like, oh, I have to push myself and work harder and, like, be really disciplined about it. It‚Äôs mostly that I‚Äôm just, like, lying in bed at 3 a.m., being like, oh, I can solve it like this, or what about if I do that, and my brain just kind of can‚Äôt let it go because I really want to see it, see it through.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> That‚Äôs awesome. Well, so maybe we can talk a little bit about how you get the inspiration to make the things that you make, because you do ‚Äì you have chosen over the years to make a bunch of interesting things‚Ä¶ that are not ‚Äì I mean, and if you watch makers on YouTube, there‚Äôs a lot of‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know whether&hellip;it‚Äôs not that people are copying each other, but there seem like there are these things, like everybody in woodworking goes and makes an epoxy river table at the same time. And like, there are these trends and, like, the things that you do are just so unique to you. How do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm setting that bar for myself. I‚Äôve just always been like, I want it to be something that you haven‚Äôt really seen before or a spin on something in a way that you haven‚Äôt done before. And I think it‚Äôs just ‚Äì it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm most interested in making, but it‚Äôs also because I am ‚Äì I think it has to do with the platform that I‚Äôm creating for. So, it is now YouTube and social media, and then I‚Äôm always like, what‚Äôs the hook? What‚Äôs the interesting thing?</p>
<p>And then if I ‚Äì I think if I‚Äôm being totally honest, if I was just making stuff for myself, then it would still be in that realm. But I probably wouldn‚Äôt push myself as hard. But now, I‚Äôm just always like, you know, in some way I think it might all ‚Äì like, almost be insecurities because I‚Äôm, like, to justify to exist in the space, I feel like I have to present something really unique.</p>
<p>And I‚Äôm always like ‚Äì because there are so many different videos I could be making and I‚Äôm like, it‚Äôs not interesting enough. I don‚Äôt feel like I can ask people to spend time watching this if it‚Äôs not elevated in some way. And I do think that has a little bit to do with, like, insecurities or, like, being apologetic about taking up space, which goes very against, like, being on YouTube.</p>
<p>But then I think it‚Äôs also just what I‚Äôm interested in. And I love, like, trying to find unique solutions to everyday problems. And that‚Äôs also what I‚Äôve been doing now, trying to transform or, like, apply that thinking to product design. So, it‚Äôs like making things for YouTube, but then also using those same kind of qualifiers to develop products and try to create for that arena as well, which is, like, a whole other world.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> I mean, already, the ‚Äì the things that you are making, so you have a new online store called Yetch, Y-E-T-C-H.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I‚Äôm very proud of how I managed to segue into that because it did actually come very naturally. (Laughter.) Did I mention that I also have a product store and where I‚Äôm trying to apply this thinking. Felt very pro.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> (Laughter.) But you just are making some of the coolest stuff. So, the ‚Äì the everyday calendar that you make is such an awesome idea just because it‚Äôs general purpose. Like, you can use it for any practice you‚Äôve got, and you created it for a meditation practice you were trying to do?</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I wanted to meditate every day. So, I made this calendar that‚Äôs kind of like a year. I still don‚Äôt know how to elevate or pitch it without, like visuals, but it represents a whole year. And if you tap a day, you can light it up. So, you can be like, did I meditate today? And you get to tap it, and it‚Äôs like, almost like a little gold star.</p>
<p>But I‚Äôve seen, I mean, what‚Äôs really fun about that product is people are using it in ways I never expected it to. I mean, there‚Äôs people who use them as period trackers or, like, how often they water their plants or if they took their medicine. So, it‚Äôs like very just, like, here‚Äôs something that I found useful for this, but maybe you can find it useful for other things.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, it‚Äôs amazing. And then, we were just talking about it. I have a ‚Äì I‚Äôm sitting in the middle of a shop right now, so my office is a machine shop and woodworking studio.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Oh wow, lucky you.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> So, like there‚Äôs ‚Äì yeah, it‚Äôs all ‚Äì all of this stuff off of cameras and. And so, like, I work with some people here. And we were talking about your, like, Philips head screwdriver ring and, like, what a great idea everybody thought it was. They were like, oh yeah, I wish I had that. Like, I had something this morning where it would have been useful.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah. No, it is. It‚Äôs been really, really fun. I‚Äôm like manufacturing is‚Ä¶ a pain. It is. It is ‚Äì it is, yeah. I feel like everybody‚Äôs ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost like hearing people talk about parenting and anyone who has kids is going to be like, having kids is so hard. And it‚Äôs the same for manufacturing where people are just like, it‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs really, really hard.</p>
<p>And, like, the everyday calendar, especially because now, a lot of the other products that we‚Äôve added to the roster, and it‚Äôs still just, like, a seedling of a product company, don‚Äôt have any electronics in it. And I‚Äôm like, I don‚Äôt know if I ever want to do another electronics product ‚Äì (laughter) ‚Äì because, like, the amount of things that can go wrong with it and we‚Äôre using capacitive touch, which is very reliable. But I mean, there are thousands of calendars out in the world there now and living happy lives.</p>
<p>But yeah, it‚Äôs definitely, as somebody who‚Äôs terrified of disappointing people, I‚Äôm like, couldn‚Äôt I have a dream that meshed well with my personal anxieties and wasn‚Äôt, like, one of the most triggering things where you‚Äôre like, we‚Äôre sending out thousands of puzzles, and what if something‚Äôs wrong with them? What if the boxes come scratched? What if somebody‚Äôs going to be disappointed and sad? But so far, so good.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs honestly ‚Äì it‚Äôs just ‚Äì it feels really nice to be able to, like, find not a life beyond YouTube, but, like, something else to do and something else to, like, revive the purpose of my YouTube channel for me, because it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve never had as a goal to have the world‚Äôs biggest YouTube channel or been feeling, like, super motivated by the numbers.</p>
<p>So then, it‚Äôs like, okay, what do I want to use this for? And like, being a product designer has been a dream that I‚Äôve had almost my whole life. And I remember being a kid and I was, like, kind of wanting to go into, like, interior design. And I was always, like, redecorating my room. But then I didn‚Äôt think it was cool enough because it felt too conventional. So, I was like, no, I‚Äôm not going to do that.</p>
<p>And then when I was going into college, I was always like, I‚Äôm going to study physics because it‚Äôs the hardest you can do. And I want to prove to myself that I‚Äôm smart. And then I dropped out after a year because I was like, no, this is not ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think this is that fun.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> (Laughter.) Well, so let‚Äôs talk a little bit, if you are okay with it, about the process of making the everyday calendar. So, you get the idea for this thing. Like, then, what do you go do, because‚Ä¶ Did you start with the intention that you were going to make a thing to be manufactured and sold to other people?</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Not at all. And I think that‚Äôs what I want to retain as well. Like, I‚Äôm always, and for YouTube as well, I‚Äôm making things for an audience of one. (Laughter.) Like, I‚Äôm making something because I really want it. And then if other people find it interesting, then great.</p>
<p>So, I made it. I made this version of it that had a bunch of toggle switches, so it was 365 toggle switches. And I just did it as ‚Äì as a video. It was untested, so it was on the YouTube channel. And then it, like, actually worked really well for me and I started wanting to think of, like, if it could be a product.</p>
<p>The problem with any product where you have 365 of a component is, like, cost just immediately starts taking off, and there was no way for us to have mechanical buttons or toggle switches or anything in a calendar. And I remember us wanting ‚Äì I kind of wanted it to almost look like an elevator button grid, but, like, smaller. But it would have been like a $1,000 product, which I didn‚Äôt want.</p>
<p>So, we ended up using capacitive touch because it‚Äôs ‚Äì it can just be in software. You just need some special chips to monitor the capacitive touch, and actually ended up using circuit board as the front plate. So, it‚Äôs this, like, designed, very embellished looking circuit board, but if you‚Äôre looking close, closer at it, you can see all the traces.</p>
<p>So, that was really fun. It was a fun design challenge to take these materials that are not really meant to be consumer facing and try to make them look really pretty and beautiful enough for you to want to hang it on a wall.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> And just the process of creating and who you‚Äôre collaborating with, had you ever laid a circuit board out before? Had you, like ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I had done some PCB design before, but very minimal. So, I started working with an electrical engineer, and a mechanical engineer and just some other people. Like, we were really just a small team of friends and trying to put it together. We did a Kickstarter campaign, raised some money, shipped those out a couple of months late after a lot of headache. But, like, we managed to get them out.</p>
<p>And ‚Äì and yeah. And now, we‚Äôre finally like the pandemic unfortunately came in between there with all the chip shortages and stuff like that. So, our BOM cost, so our bill of materials went up with, like, 40%, which just made it an unfeasible product for us. So, we kind of had to hold off on manufacturing more. And now, we‚Äôre looking at ‚Äì we just had another batch come in and now, we‚Äôre looking at adding another batch.</p>
<p>But it is ‚Äì there‚Äôs some reliability things we‚Äôre working on to think about, because we have 365 LEDs. The fault rate of an LED normally is, like, one in 10,000 over a couple of years, which sounds reasonable, but that means that, like, one in 30 calendars can get an issue down the line, like, a couple of years down the line. So, we‚Äôre replacing those.</p>
<p>But there has been a lot of, like, trying to figure out how to increase the lifespan of the LEDs and doing a lot of stress testing, seeing if we can reduce the heat when we‚Äôre soldering them and, you know, a lot of different things. And that‚Äôs like, you know, you kind of think that you design a product, and you put it out there and you‚Äôre like, done. But there is a lot of iterating, and trying to figure out how to improve it and how to make it a better experience, both for the manufacturer, and for us and for the customers.</p>
<p>So, I‚Äôm learning so much and it‚Äôs really ‚Äì it is, like‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt, even looking back like two years ago, I‚Äôm thinking of how much I‚Äôve learned and that‚Äôs really nice. It‚Äôs like a lot of ‚Äì because we‚Äôre learning by doing and there‚Äôs not ‚Äì we‚Äôre a really, like, skilled, but young team and it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ You know, I just feel really fortunate to be able to do it, and to be able to do it this way and to be able to do it on my own terms and kind of follow the whims of my creativity. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Yeah, I‚Äôm just stoked.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT: I</strong>t‚Äôs just awesome stuff. And it for a curious person, it seems like the way that you‚Äôre doing things, like, you‚Äôve got a lot of surface area for your curiosity to explore ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> (Laughter.) That‚Äôs the nice way of putting it.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Because it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre just building a bunch of electronic products. Like, I‚Äôm ‚Äì I‚Äôm just super curious. So, you ‚Äì you‚Äôre making these rings. Are they cast and machined or‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> So, the rings are manufactured. They‚Äôre not cast, they‚Äôre not 3D printed. We looked into doing some of that, but since we wanted to actually be a functional tool, the screwdriver ring, you just can‚Äôt get the hardness of the material using that. So, they‚Äôre all machined.</p>
<p>And then the screw ring was really tricky to figure out how to do. So basically, it‚Äôs a ring. It looks like a Phillips head screw, but then it‚Äôs, like, embedded into a normal kind of signet ring.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> And the way you manufacture screws is you kind of have this, like, rod of metal come and then they stamp the screw head into it, kind of stamp that face into it. And we couldn‚Äôt really do that because it would deform the ring too much, and also, that tooling would be incredibly complex to make.</p>
<p>So, what we ended up doing is using lasers to do it and the amount of precision ‚Äì like, the amount of time we spent coupling the screwdriver ring and the screw ring with other items, and trying to see if they, like, hold in place or fall out, just because we want that really good fit, it‚Äôs just ‚Äì you know, you go in such detail. In a way, I‚Äôm like, no customer is ever going to notice this, but also, like, knowing that we can get it to that level where we‚Äôre feeling really happy with it, it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre not going to be able to stay away from it.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. Well, and I love that. There are other makers out there, like one of my favorite YouTube makers is this guy, John Grimsmo, who makes knives. And, like, they are super obsessed with knives.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> They make every last thing. They make their own bearings. They make ‚Äì like, every piece of that knife is custom machined in their machine shop. And like, it‚Äôs completely unnecessary, but so awesome.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah. I just love it when people are excited about something and almost, in particular, they‚Äôre excited about something that I‚Äôm not, because I‚Äôm always like, how? What is it about it that just gets you ticking and, like, gets you so in ‚Äì want to get into the nitty gritty of it all? I don‚Äôt know.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> I feel the same way. When I watch other makers, sometimes, I‚Äôm watching it to learn something that I am going to go reproduce. And sometimes, I watch it just to, like, see how fascinating other human beings are in expressing their creativity. Like, I would never in a million years, like, you know, know ‚Äì and this is not a ding on the product ‚Äì like, it would never occur to me to put a Phillips head screwdriver tip on ‚Äì on a ring. But I love that you did. Like, it‚Äôs just amazing.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah, I feel like everybody‚Äôs brain is, like, in their own corner of creativity. And you go and you see something that some other maker or some other artists and make ‚Äì is making, and you‚Äôre like, wow, you‚Äôre just having a blast over there. And that‚Äôs, like, your arena. And I definitely feel like I have my own little pod and, like, kind of the area that I‚Äôm making in. And, yeah, but‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> So, I have to mention your puzzle as well. So, my wife‚Äôs pandemic obsession, like the thing that she would do when she was, like, just completely overwhelmed with the stress of being locked in a house with two little kids and a cranky husband, was she would go just work on a puzzle. Like, we had a big table set up and there was a puzzle on it at all times, and she would solve it. And she ‚Äì I would buy her puzzles. And evidently, my taste in puzzles is Godawful, because I would buy her ones that were just the most miserably hard to solve.</p>
<p>And then I saw yours, which is a, what, a 500-piece puzzle? It‚Äôs all white and you randomly remove a piece ‚Äì (laughter) ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> A piece from every puzzle, yes. So, you get 499 out of 500 pieces. And it is, as far as I‚Äôm concerned, the world‚Äôs first officially incomplete puzzle. Yeah, I came up with the idea of this, like, years and years ago, or I think maybe like three years ago. And I came out of the bathroom, and I was laughing so hard that I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing long enough to tell my friend what I was laughing about. (Laughter.) And I still don‚Äôt.</p>
<p>And then it‚Äôs like it goes so long where I‚Äôm like, is the joke still there? You know, you spend so much time with it and so much time, like, designing the boxes and thinking about it. And then you‚Äôre like, is this still funny? And sometimes, it‚Äôs like trying to look at your hands and being like, are these normal looking hands?</p>
<p>But I‚Äôm still I just think‚Ä¶ You know, the thing that blows my mind the most about it is that people are, like, down for the joke. And I mean, it‚Äôs just sometimes, you take a step back and I‚Äôm like, we‚Äôve sold, like, 1,000 incomplete puzzles and it‚Äôs just so bizarre. But yeah, here we are.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> But it‚Äôs a hilarious joke. I told my wife I‚Äôm going to order her one. I told her about it and she was like, why would she do that? (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I know! It‚Äôs like the most wholesome, villainous thing to do. (Laughter.) Like, there‚Äôs no harm in it, but it‚Äôs really like ‚Äì people are like, why? Why? But the funny thing is, because I put together this puzzle two times now, three in total with another iteration, and when you realize which piece is the missing piece, it‚Äôs almost the most fun part of the puzzle, because I mean, all the other parts are miserable, really, but it‚Äôs like where you‚Äôre like, oh, that‚Äôs the one. And it‚Äôs almost more of a satisfaction to find the one that‚Äôs missing. But yeah.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Well, and the completed puzzles actually I mean, there‚Äôs something almost like you should frame it and hang it in the Museum of Modern Art. Like, the ‚Äì it‚Äôs ‚Äì it says something, but both the fact that a human being would have the patience to go spend all of this time on a thing that can‚Äôt be finished, as well as the aesthetic of the ‚Äì this stark white puzzle missing one piece, I ‚Äì I think it‚Äôs very clever, very clever.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I mean, it‚Äôs spending time on this thing that‚Äôs not going to be finished. But also, like, generally, when you work with a jigsaw puzzle, when you‚Äôre done, you just crumble ‚Äì crumble it all together anyway. So, it‚Äôs like ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> But it is, it‚Äôs interesting how much of a‚Ä¶ I was going to say eyesore but almost, like, thought-sore it is because you‚Äôre always like, oh, it‚Äôs not going to be worth it because it‚Äôs missing a piece. And you‚Äôre like, and that‚Äôs what I wrote on the box. I had a lot of fun writing all the copy text for the puzzle. And what I wrote on the box was like, this piece ‚Äì this puzzle has one piece that‚Äôs missing and 499 that aren‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs almost this thing of like, it‚Äôs so easy to just focus on that one thing that‚Äôs wrong. And then you‚Äôre like, oh, but there‚Äôs so much that is right, and that is just the way I wanted it to be, but‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, and one of the things that I love are the never finished things, because so much of what I spend my time doing, like, it has to get finished. You can‚Äôt ‚Äì you can‚Äôt run a business without finishing things. But in my personal life, I love unfinished things. And folks asked me a lot, I‚Äôve got this shop and they ask me, oh, what‚Äôs the ‚Äì what‚Äôs the best thing you‚Äôve built in the shop or the thing that you‚Äôre proudest about in the shop? And I‚Äôm like, well, it‚Äôs kind of the shop itself and it‚Äôs never finished. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah, yeah. But that‚Äôs also such a different area of making, because I‚Äôve never ‚Äì I haven‚Äôt gotten to the point or my brain hasn‚Äôt latched on to, like, shop layout as a fun project to work on. I‚Äôm just like, I just want it to work. Like, my shop is a mess. I call it the butthole of the house because I‚Äôm like, just let it be ugly. Like, it‚Äôs just going to ‚Äì it‚Äôs just there for its function.</p>
<p>And then I‚Äôve been thinking of like, oh, I should really get better about structuring things, but it just hasn‚Äôt, like ‚Äì it hasn‚Äôt clicked for me yet where I‚Äôm like, oh, that brings me a lot of satisfaction, but I think I‚Äôll get there eventually. But it‚Äôs also I‚Äôm just a messy person in general, and I‚Äôm always leaving a trail of projects behind me.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> But I ‚Äì I think that‚Äôs fine.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah, but sometimes, I‚Äôm like, I wish I was ‚Äì I wish I was that person and that I was that person who was like, I‚Äôm going to make labels for things and not just throw them into random bins. But I mean, there‚Äôs pros and cons to every setup. I do move fast, so there‚Äôs that.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. Well, I mean, the way that I think about my working environments, I can be incredibly messy, but what I like about my shop is I walk into it and everything is where it‚Äôs supposed to be, and it‚Äôs clean and it is ready for action. It‚Äôs all potential energy. And it makes me ‚Äì and this is what I need as a creator. I need to walk into situations, and I get inspired by the possibility that sits in the order.</p>
<p>And I know other people who are, like, way, way more creative than I am, who have completely different processes and it‚Äôs okay. Like, it‚Äôs fascinating to me, like, how everybody works.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah, to me, it‚Äôs like step one is always clear a big enough space on my workbench where I can work on the project. (Laughter.) It‚Äôs always, like, just pushing things off to the side. But there‚Äôs still ‚Äì I still have hope that I‚Äôm going to be one of those neat people, but it‚Äôs like ‚Äì also, like, doing machine maintenance and stuff, I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Well, and then it‚Äôs working with other people is sort of fun, too, right? Like, I ‚Äìshare this shop with, like, someone who works with me, and it took us a while to figure out, like, hey, here‚Äôs our ‚Äì here‚Äôs our dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah, and that‚Äôs also, if you‚Äôre sharing a space with somebody, then I‚Äôm all for being clean and stuff. And I will, like ‚Äì the only time I will really properly clean my house is if somebody‚Äôs coming over. But when it‚Äôs just left to my own devices, especially in the workshop, it‚Äôs like, yeah, it‚Äôs just pure chaos. And then I‚Äôll have fits of cleaning and be really orderly for all of 25 minutes, but yeah‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> (Laughter.) So what ‚Äì what interesting stuff are you doing now? You mentioned woodworking and welding.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah. Oh, I was just ‚Äì welding because I was just welding today. Oh, I‚Äôm working ‚Äì Oh, I love this project so much. It has been the most interesting engineering challenge and I‚Äôm just stoked about it. I‚Äôm making a music instrument that pops bubble wrap.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Oh. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> So, it‚Äôs like, you know like those little music boxes that have, like, the little barrels with spikes on it and it plays a tune.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yep.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> So, imagine that, but it‚Äôs bigger and you feed in a sheet of bubble wrap and it pops different bubbles. And the bubbles popping resonate in different length tubes. So, it actually plays different notes. So, right now, I‚Äôm at like a very fun part of the build where I‚Äôm going to ‚Äì I‚Äôm probably ‚Äì tomorrow, I‚Äôll probably have a first attempt at a final assembly. So, I have almost all the parts. I still need to C&amp;C and machine some ‚Äì the ‚Äì some wood parts, but it‚Äôs all, like, coming together. And it‚Äôs probably not going to work, so there‚Äôs most likely going to be a rev 2.</p>
<p>But yeah, I‚Äôm ‚Äì I‚Äôm just stoked about the concept. I think it‚Äôs so fun and I‚Äôm just ‚Äì it‚Äôs one of those ideas where you‚Äôre like, I think of it and then I‚Äôm like, somebody must have done this. Like, there is no way nobody has done this. And then I, like, Google, and you get to the bottom of the image search or you, like, search on YouTube and you can‚Äôt find anything. And you‚Äôre like, nobody‚Äôs done this. (Laughter.) And yeah, so I‚Äôm stoked. It‚Äôs been a fun project on every level so far, and ‚Äì and really complicated, but super fun.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> It sounds crazy complicated, actually.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> It has been crazy complicated, but I‚Äôve ‚Äì I‚Äôve started working‚Ä¶ Like, one of the push and pulls of my career is in the beginning, I was so stubborn about putting in, like, every screw myself. And I think a part of it is, like, being a woman in a field with not a lot of women, and I always felt like I was always wanting to be ready. If anyone questioned my skills or questioned who had build a ‚Äì built a project, I would be able to say, like, no, I did absolutely everything. No dude ever touched this project.</p>
<p>But then, like, in recent years, I really like ‚Äì I love working with other people. It‚Äôs so fun to problem solve with other people, and I‚Äôve started working with this engineer. He helped me on the companion chair, and the puzzle table and the scissor lamp. So, we‚Äôll like design it together in Fusion and sit and problem solve together. And it‚Äôs let me, like ‚Äì I‚Äôve ‚Äì I‚Äôm learning so much. It‚Äôs letting me do much more complex projects than I would have the bandwidth to do myself.</p>
<p>So yeah, it‚Äôs been super fun to just, like, try to solve these incredibly specific problems. Like, I spent probably a week just popping bubble wrap, trying to figure out the optimal shape and surface to pop bubbles reliably and to make sure that we could perfectly control pop location, because it needs to pop within a very small area for it to resonate in the tube. And just, like, getting to spend so much time on such specific problems is ‚Äì is such a treat.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Do you do any 3D printing for prototyping?</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, I do. So, it‚Äôs ‚Äì the first thing I tend to grab for is my laser cutter because it‚Äôs always the fastest. Like, you can do something within a couple of minutes. But then 3D printing and then last is just C&amp;C‚Äôing. So, it‚Äôs nice to have like things in different tiers of prototyping. But yeah, this ‚Äì this build is going to have some 3D printed elements, but most of it is going to be C&amp;C‚Äôd. And I got a rotary kit for my C&amp;C so I could make the barrel on the ‚Äì on the C&amp;C, which was a whole new learning experience, but very fun.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> That sounds fun. And you‚Äôve got an Avid C&amp;C machine that you put together yourself?</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, those are super cool.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I love it. It was such a game changer for me.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> So, it‚Äôs really interesting. I‚Äôve been a woodworker since I was a teenager, which is ‚Äì (laughter) ‚Äì I‚Äôm older than you, so that‚Äôs a very long time ago. And, like, one of the funny things that I‚Äôve seen in woodworking over the years is you have people who try to define what real woodworking is. So, there are, like, some who are like, oh, if it‚Äôs anything but hand tools, it‚Äôs not real woodworking. And then, like, people now are saying, oh, well, if you use a C&amp;C and not just hand power tools, it‚Äôs not real woodworking, which always struck me as‚Ä¶ I mean, and no ‚Äì no disrespect.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> If you didn‚Äôt ‚Äì if you didn‚Äôt fell the tree yourself ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> I love ‚Äì I love those handwork traditions.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Did you not grow the tree and then fell it and dry it? Then no, it‚Äôs not ‚Äì it‚Äôs not woodworking. (Laughter.) Yeah, I think it‚Äôs always like‚Ä¶ I get it, but I mean, it‚Äôs the same with, like, when GPSs were starting to come out and people were like, oh, it‚Äôs not real driving if you have a device help you navigate around the city. Like, to me, it‚Äôs just it‚Äôs all parts of the same coin and you‚Äôre comfortable with different tools.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs like, for me, as somebody who started in electronics and started in kind of computer design, it‚Äôs been such a ‚Äì for me, the C&amp;C kind of perfectly came into my build process because I‚Äôm always making drafts in the computer anyway. And I‚Äôm using Illustrator and Fusion to design it, and then being able to pop that onto a machine, like the first thing I grab for is never really, like, a knife and a piece of wood, and I start, like, carving something out.</p>
<p>So, I think it‚Äôs just all like ‚Äì we just think of the world in different terms. And for me, I‚Äôm ‚Äì I‚Äôve always thought computer first. And ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> It‚Äôs just different. There‚Äôs so many ways you can solve a problem. And I think that‚Äôs one of the things, like, that I‚Äôve learned in ‚Äì in making and building things, is, like, when you start, you almost ‚Äì you think that there‚Äôs, like, one right way of doing it and it‚Äôs like, no, there‚Äôs a hundred different ways of doing it. And maybe five of those are really good and 40 of those are really bad. But it‚Äôs like you can ‚Äì there are so many different ways to ‚Äì to skin a cat. But why would you want to skin a cat? (Laughter.) It‚Äôs such a weird expression.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> (Laughter.) Yeah, I‚Äôve never understood that metaphor.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah, there are so many ways to build a chair.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yes, correct. (Laughter.) Yeah, one of the things that really inspires me about how you approach making, and Adam Savage does the same thing, is you have so many tools in your arsenal. And, you know, one of the things that I used to ‚Äì the lies I used to tell myself is like, oh, I can‚Äôt do X. Like, I am a woodworker, I can‚Äôt be a machinist. Like, I work with wood. I can‚Äôt weld stuff or do metalworking, which is just sort of a silly ‚Äì silly, self-imposed set of constraints, because of course, you can do all of these things.</p>
<p>And I just love watching you just having an idea and, like, you just apply so many different tools at the ‚Äì at the ‚Äì like, how do you‚Ä¶ How did you get to that point, like not letting yourself get siloed as a ‚Äì like, a maker of type X?</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I mean, I can list the things that I never thought I would be able to do. It‚Äôs like almost every skill I‚Äôve acquired at some point. Like, I remember thinking, oh, I could never program. And then you start and you‚Äôre like, oh, this isn‚Äôt ‚Äì like, other people are doing this, so I can probably figure it out too.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt think I could solder. I remember being really scared the first time I soldered, and then you‚Äôre like, oh, I can do this. I didn‚Äôt think I could weld. I was terrified of welding. And then you have somebody show you the ropes, and then you‚Äôre like, okay, I can do this.</p>
<p>The same with C&amp;C‚Äôing. I was really reluctant to get into C&amp;C‚Äôing because I was like, I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs so complicated and I feel like I could never learn and ‚Äì or driving a car. I mean, it‚Äôs like almost everything, it‚Äôs like I run into, like, no, I could never do this. I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just not going to be good enough or be able to figure it out. And then you start and you‚Äôre like, so silly of me to think that I couldn‚Äôt do it because you‚Äôve just got to find the right way to learn, you know?</p>
<p>It took me three attempts to start learning Fusion, because ‚Äì Fusion 360, because I would just get stuck on their instructional videos. And I was like, this is so complicated. And then you just find somebody who can teach you in a way that works for you or find a way to learn it. And it‚Äôs ‚Äì yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> But I do remember, like, more in a branding way or, like, I was really nervous about getting pigeonholed as, like, the Queen of Shitty Robots, which is what I used to do. I used to only build, like, funny robots and weird machines, which I loved. And like, I‚Äôll still do that. I feel like a lot of the projects I do now draw a lot of ‚Äì still have a lot of those elements.</p>
<p>But I was really happy to feel like I was able to move beyond that and expand beyond that, and have my audience kind of be down for the ride. I feel I‚Äôve ‚Äì they‚Äôre ‚Äì they‚Äôre just the most kind, supportive people and they‚Äôre just like, oh, if you‚Äôre excited about it, we‚Äôre excited too, which is a very, very supportive community to have.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. And ‚Äì and, like, the breadth of this stuff that you work on all the way from the whimsical to some hardcore engineering things, like the Truck-la that you built, the ‚Äì turning a model 3 Tesla into an El Camino or like a truck.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Like a truck, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, crazy.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah, it‚Äôs ‚Äì you know, it‚Äôs ‚Äì I try to do things I‚Äôm genuinely excited about and that does throw some curveballs.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> (Laughter.) Which I ‚Äì I think it‚Äôs so ‚Äì it‚Äôs so inspiring. So, maybe last couple of questions before ‚Äì before we go. So, one is ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> You‚Äôre so ‚Äì can I just say you‚Äôre so sweet. I feel like I‚Äôm just getting to sit here and have you say a bunch of really sweet and kind and thoughtful things. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> (Laughter.) It‚Äôs very nice. I can‚Äôt even begin to tell you how big a fan I am of what you‚Äôre doing. And one, because I‚Äôm genuinely‚Ä¶. genuinely, like, entertained and inspired by what you do. But, like, the thing that I really admire is what you‚Äôre doing for other people.</p>
<p>One of the tragic things to me is folks going around the world thinking that they don‚Äôt have agency over creativity and that, like, all of the stuff that they are consuming and that they use in their lives is ‚Äì is magical and beyond their understanding or‚Ä¶ And, like, you just inspire people to go past that, to say, like, hey, you know, we ‚Äì all of these things were built by people. We can understand how they‚Äôre built. We can go hack on them, like change them, modify them, make our own things. Like, that‚Äôs a super powerful thing to be putting out into the world.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I just think, for me, as well, it‚Äôs so, like‚Ä¶ things seem so set in stone. And, you know, I‚Äôve been thinking about, like, forks, for example, and I‚Äôve never questioned what a fork looks like. But you ‚Äì then you realize, like, this is just built upon decisions that people have made. Somebody came up with this design and within these parameters, and it‚Äôs just, like, generations of humans trying to improve on things, and then realizing I can be one of those people.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs just such a ‚Äì and you flail your way through it. (Laughter.) You flail and you futz, and then you get somewhere. And sometimes, you don‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a really fun way, for me at least, to be in the world because it‚Äôs like everything is malleable and, like, have ‚Äì like, being able to have bought a house for the first time. And I‚Äôm like, I can do anything. And you‚Äôre like, does the window really need to be this way or could it be something else? Could it be something more fun?</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. I had a colleague one time, who I think had her PhD in robotics from Carnegie Mellon. And she was, like, one of our awesome product managers. And she ‚Äì we were talking one day and she ‚Äì she just was obsessed with home renovation stuff.</p>
<p>And she‚Äôs like, yeah, it‚Äôs like these‚Ä¶ I have people in my team who look at what I‚Äôm doing, like knocking walls down, like, you know, that there‚Äôs something behind the drywall, like the ‚Äì the chest to Narnia, that there‚Äôs magic behind there. (Laughter.) And she‚Äôs like, I try to explain to them that, like, there‚Äôs no magic. It‚Äôs just, like, hey, I‚Äôm interested in doing this. And like, I figured it all out.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah. You watch a lot of YouTube videos and then you figure it out. You watch a lot of YouTube videos and then you Google, what are the most common accidents people who do this have? Like, whenever I‚Äôm learning a new tool, I‚Äôm like, what are the most common accidents with, like, angle grinders? And then you‚Äôre like, okay, these are the things I shouldn‚Äôt do. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Oh, angle grinders.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah, they‚Äôre terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. The closest I ever came to seriously injuring myself was with an angle grinder.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah, they‚Äôll do it.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> And a router table.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Oh, I‚Äôm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Not good. (Laughter.) Well, so, maybe the last couple of questions. So, one is what are you sort of excited about in the future? Like, what‚Äôs the thing that you don‚Äôt know how to do right now that you ‚Äì that you want to go figure out at some point in the future, like a thing you want to add to your arsenal of skills?</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I do want to work more on vehicles. I‚Äôm kind of on the lookout for another big vehicle project, but it‚Äôs ‚Äì I think I‚Äôve set the bar a little bit too high for myself because I‚Äôm, like, trying to think of like Truck-la, and she‚Äôs just a really hard act to follow. But I really want to do that and do more, more just vehicular stuff because that‚Äôs such an interesting area.</p>
<p>I also ‚Äì I want to learn how to build houses. I really want to, like, at least design a house at some point, but that‚Äôs a couple of years down the line. But then, now, it‚Äôs just a lot of, like, product development. Design for manufacturing is a really interesting area.</p>
<p>And honestly, like, a lot of the things that I‚Äôm hoping to see the next couple of years is just, like, growing as a CEO. And in that leadership role, there‚Äôs a lot of other parts to the business where it‚Äôs like, you know when you grow up on YouTube or being a YouTuber and you‚Äôre kind of, like, yeah. You‚Äôre just this kid making videos in your living room. And then the business has just grown, and I‚Äôm really excited to step more into that role and just, I don‚Äôt know, learn about that. But, like, leadership is never something I‚Äôve really thought about, you know?</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. But I ‚Äì I think, just like everything else you‚Äôre doing, like, you‚Äôre going to be great at it. So as long as you approach it with humility and curiosity and, like, you‚Äôre willing to try to introspect on what you‚Äôre doing so that you can get better all the time, like, every ‚Äì everybody starts out ‚Äì</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I can just be like, hey, can I be on the podcast again? And you say a bunch of really sweet, encouraging things to me. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> if you ever need encouraging words about leadership, I can ‚Äì I can absolutely offer them, because I remember when I ‚Äì you know, nobody ‚Äì I don‚Äôt believe in this notion of born leader. Like, you‚Ä¶ as soon as you find, like, a reason to be a leader, like there‚Äôs a thing you want to help a bunch of other people accomplish, then it‚Äôs just this journey of, like, how do I get better and better at doing that?</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah. And it‚Äôs really like ‚Äì it‚Äôs such an individual like journey as well, because it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm running these businesses and I want to ‚Äì I‚Äôm figuring out what the company culture is and how I want it to be. Like, what do we actually prioritize in the business? How can you create a really, like, kind and supportive environment that‚Äôs also productive? And I know it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs not looking like a normal enterprise and I want to retain some parts of that.</p>
<p>But then you‚Äôre also like there is a lot of structure that is required. And yeah, there‚Äôs just a lot of, like, you know, you try something and then you‚Äôre like, did that ‚Äì was that ‚Äì did it feel right or was that right, or should I iterate and try to course correct? And there‚Äôs definitely a lot of that, both in building, but also in running companies and in interacting with people or in, like, normal relationships. You‚Äôre just always like, did this feel right or ‚Äì or should I do it differently, and constantly trying to find better ways of being in the world.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah. Yes, and I think that‚Äôs a perfect mindset. I mean, it‚Äôs a really, really powerful thing, like waking up every day, just sort of reflecting on what you‚Äôre doing and how you can get a little bit better at it, just step by step.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> So, last question: You do so much fun stuff for your job, but I ask everyone on the podcast, like, what they do in their, quote unquote, free time or leisure time when they‚Äôre not working‚Ä¶ for fun.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> It‚Äôs been a struggle. Because if left to my own devices, I‚Äôll just keep on building things. So come Saturday, and I‚Äôll be like, I‚Äôm going to work on some house projects, and then I just end up being more in the workshop and doing a lot of firing up my C&amp;C and doing a lot of the same stuff. So, I‚Äôve just been trying to ‚Äì my New Year‚Äôs resolution was to try to make more friends and build more community, which is interesting because it‚Äôs almost the thing that you just expect to happen. And I‚Äôm like, no, I‚Äôm actually going to make an effort.</p>
<p>I moved to L.A. mid-2020, so, like, during the pandemic and I‚Äôm still, like, I‚Äôm just going to try to, like, meet more people and actually make an effort to, like, create that environment where, like, you can hang out and build community. So, I‚Äôve been doing a lot of that. I‚Äôm just, like, trying to see a lot of people and be social.</p>
<p>And then I spend a lot of time with my dog. That‚Äôs really it. Like, we go to the park and I throw a stick repeatedly. She has a blast. I enjoy looking at her having a good time. And then we go home and we rest.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, she‚Äôs ‚Äì she‚Äôs so cute.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I just ‚Äì I just gave her a new haircut, and she now has a mullet, which is very funny. (Laughter.) It just makes people laugh so much.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> (Laughter.) You‚Äôve got to put that on the video.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah, I just laugh every time I look at her, but I feel like she‚Äôs finally come to her true self.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Is she self-aware of the bad haircut or the mullet?</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> I don‚Äôt think so, I don‚Äôt think so. I think all she can tell is that people look at her and they get very happy. (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> So, we have a shop dog, a brown standard poodle whose name is Douglas Fur.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah, good one.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> (Laughter.) Yeah, and Douglas knows when he‚Äôs got a bad haircut.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Yeah? Oh, I don‚Äôt think she knows. She just gets very excited about being so aerodynamic when I cut her short. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> That‚Äôs ‚Äì that‚Äôs so awesome. Well, look, thank you so much for taking time to chat with us today, and thank you for what you do. It‚Äôs just great stuff.</p>
<p><strong>SIMONE GIERTZ:</strong> Thank you so much. Yeah, and thanks for watching all my videos. It‚Äôs not just for research for this podcast. It means a lot.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>[MUSIC]</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> All right. That was Kevin‚Äôs interview with Simon Giertz. I thought it was really, really great. I mean, she‚Äôs incredible, right? Like, the stuff that she does, as you said at the top of the show, she‚Äôs a great example for so many people out there. But what was amazing to me is how she‚Äôs just so kind of fearless to give things a try. And that attitude, I think, about learning and exploring and trying things out is just really, really, I think, rare to see people do it the way that she has, and also, really awesome just to see the results where she‚Äôs saying, well, if other people can do this, why can‚Äôt I try? I don‚Äôt think we have enough of that in this world.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yeah, I totally agree. We have so many people, and, like, I do this myself sometimes. Like, I have, over and over again in my own life, sort of looked at things and said, oh, I don‚Äôt understand how this works. And like, I think it‚Äôs too complicated for me to understand. And, like, that ‚Äì that is ‚Äì you can certainly live your life that way, but, like, it‚Äôs so much more interesting when you just can focus your curiosity on a thing, like figure out what makes it tick, like, what must the people who made it have been thinking when they created the thing; and then just giving yourself permission to tinker around and to try to replicate people‚Äôs results or make brand new things that have never existed before yourself.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> No, I totally agree with you. I have a tendency sometimes to do the same thing where I think something is too hard, and I don‚Äôt want to even attempt it because I‚Äôm just like, well, there‚Äôs no way I could figure it out. But hearing Simone talk and thinking about it and thinking, no, I‚Äôm going to go ahead and I‚Äôm going to learn to actually fix my own plumbing if I want to, you know?</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> It‚Äôs inspiring, actually. I wanted to ask you, you know, when did your, I guess, love of making start? Did it start as a kid or has this been something that‚Äôs come about more as you‚Äôve gotten older and as you know, you‚Äôve done other things and been exposed to people like Simone?</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> It did start when I was a kid. Like, I was always super, super curious about how things worked. I was, you know, the bane of my mother‚Äôs existence when I was a little kid, because I was the four year old that was trying to take things apart and shove metal objects in light sockets and all sorts of, like, highly, highly dangerous and destructive sorts of things.</p>
<p>But, you know, the thing that I did when I was younger, is I just sort of put these weird constraints on my making. Like, I would just convince myself that, oh, I only know how to do this and I can‚Äôt do this other stuff. So, like, for a very long time, like I ‚Äì the story that I told myself is I am not mechanically inclined. And ‚Äì and so, like, oh my God, it‚Äôs so much easier to make things with software than it is to, like, make things with, like, physical things.</p>
<p>And then I you know, I‚Äôd done some woodworking stuff when I was a kid and I became a more serious woodworking hobbyist, you know, as an adult. But even then, it‚Äôs like, oh, well, I‚Äôm only a woodworker. Like, I can‚Äôt ‚Äì I can‚Äôt do this other stuff. And, like, the thing that I‚Äôve just learned over time is that, yeah, you can ‚Äì you can teach yourself how to do anything. And when you have more tools in your arsenal, you can do more really interesting, creative things.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> Yeah. No, I think that‚Äôs ‚Äì I think that‚Äôs a great point. And I think what‚Äôs great about what‚Äôs happening now, what we didn‚Äôt have access to before, is we have this community of makers, people like Simone, who are making this amazing content and teaching others, and giving them ideas and showing off what it looks like, which is empowering. It really is, for people who might not know where to get started or might be afraid of doing something wrong, having those guides out there for us is just really awesome.</p>
<p><strong>KEVIN SCOTT:</strong> Hundred percent. I mean, we should all be just incredibly grateful with how generous all these makers are, that they are sharing what they do with all of us and teaching us, like, what their creativity looks like. Even if, you know, we‚Äôre just curious and never going to do things ourselves, like it‚Äôs still just an incredible act of generosity on their behalf.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTINA WARREN:</strong> No, you‚Äôre completely correct. And I think that goes for all types of art, which making definitely is. We‚Äôre very fortunate to have so many generous people, as you say, sharing with us, and Simone is definitely one of them.</p>
<p>All right. Well, that is all the time we have for today. Thank you so much to Simone Giertz for joining us.
