views i&rsquo;ve ever had is 25 000 views an hour¬†¬†</p>
<p>and take take a while to guess what the topic is¬†
corona virus yeah it&rsquo;s a very hot topic right now¬†¬†</p>
<p>you know about i would say 15 years ago i was¬†
doing talks around the governmental agencies¬†¬†</p>
<p>in washington d.c and also exxon mobil and they¬†
kicked me out they actually said you can&rsquo;t talk¬†¬†</p>
<p>anymore i called them up and said why they said¬†
well because you&rsquo;re recommending 45 eggs a day¬†¬†</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very bad for the heart i¬†
said no i didn&rsquo;t say 45 i said 4-5</p>
<p>they said oh okay you can come back so¬†
sometimes you have to clarify things</p>
<p>so uh disclosures no financial ties to¬†
pharmaceutical diagnostic or medical devices¬†¬†</p>
<p>or food industry owner of dr bird.com dr berg¬†
supplements authored the healthy keto plan i¬†¬†</p>
<p>organized a summit called the healthy keto¬†
summit every year and my bias is low carb¬†¬†</p>
<p>so today i want to talk about some unique problems¬†
that happen in the keto uh world i have a large uh¬†¬†</p>
<p>following on social media i have a facebook close¬†
private group of 300 thousand people and i&rsquo;m it&rsquo;s¬†¬†</p>
<p>called my keto lab i&rsquo;m able to test different¬†
things to see what works see what problems that¬†¬†</p>
<p>people are running into and uh gain a tremendous¬†
amount of understanding about what people are¬†¬†</p>
<p>running into and what the solutions are so i¬†
want to share today some common problems and¬†¬†</p>
<p>solutions one of the biggest ones being plateau¬†
it&rsquo;s keto stall so i want to talk about that first</p>
<p>so a couple couple things one is that you¬†
have people who say well it&rsquo;s not working¬†¬†</p>
<p>i only lost two pounds the first week i¬†
lost six and now i just lost two pounds¬†¬†</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like well you have to understand that is¬†
normal so it takes a little bit of education¬†¬†</p>
<p>at first to set people up but there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s¬†
different levels of awareness that you have to¬†¬†</p>
<p>understand you have awareness of the¬†
problem awareness of the cause of the¬†¬†</p>
<p>problem awareness of the solution¬†
and also of the correct solution so¬†¬†</p>
<p>like i would take like men for example they might¬†
have this huge belly but they&rsquo;re not very aware¬†¬†</p>
<p>that that is a fatty liver they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re¬†
just like oh yeah it&rsquo;s fine i can deal with it¬†¬†</p>
<p>so i wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily go right¬†
into teaching them about what to eat¬†¬†</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s too high level so i really address¬†
people where they&rsquo;re at and then build them up¬†¬†</p>
<p>and one of the things i found is that you have¬†
to teach them the basics of certain things¬†¬†</p>
<p>uh especially like one guy came in he goes um¬†
yeah your program&rsquo;s not working i tried it for two¬†¬†</p>
<p>weeks and it didn&rsquo;t work well it did work but then¬†
it stopped working well what did you do well i¬†¬†</p>
<p>stopped stop the diet i said did you think it was¬†
going to keep working if you stop so you really¬†¬†</p>
<p>have to educate people from the very beginning and¬†
so there&rsquo;s a really important very vital principle¬†¬†</p>
<p>that i talk about and that is about it&rsquo;s not lose¬†
weight to get healthy it&rsquo;s get healthy to lose the¬†¬†</p>
<p>weight and this is so basic because looking at¬†
diabetes as a disease doesn&rsquo;t work as this being¬†¬†</p>
<p>this is like this cause of cause situation¬†
it&rsquo;s the effect of course of high insulin¬†¬†</p>
<p>if someone does not understand this concept¬†
they&rsquo;re very susceptible to doing the wrong¬†¬†</p>
<p>solution very unhealthy programs diet¬†
appetite suppressants low quality¬†¬†</p>
<p>products they try to get they try to actually¬†
diet to lose weight how many of you agree that¬†¬†</p>
<p>dieting actually destroys your metabolism you¬†
take someone who&rsquo;s menopause and you ask them¬†¬†</p>
<p>how many diets have you been on it&rsquo;s probably¬†
been 10 or 12 and every time they do it¬†¬†</p>
<p>of course they&rsquo;re doing it wrong it slows down¬†
the metabolism so just because someone&rsquo;s losing¬†¬†</p>
<p>weight doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re getting healthy¬†
it really depends on how they&rsquo;re losing weight¬†¬†</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s some products that people think¬†
are healthy you have you know of course the¬†¬†</p>
<p>slim fast hidden sugars if you take a look at the¬†
ingredients high levels of soy protein isolates¬†¬†</p>
<p>which are exposed to hexane which in pubmed is a¬†
neurotoxin and there&rsquo;s no fda has no sealing of¬†¬†</p>
<p>how much hexane is in there had a lot of clients¬†
come in that have done like programs like ideal¬†¬†</p>
<p>protein that really high in soy protein isolates¬†
and end up with liver and gallbladder issues so¬†¬†</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re hidden sugars as well so is a¬†
really important question that i always always¬†¬†</p>
<p>ask people to figure things out and i think¬†
it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s not emphasized and that is okay¬†¬†</p>
<p>when did this problem start and what happened¬†
just before that and you can get so much data¬†¬†</p>
<p>i had one lady came in with a heart attack¬†
a heart attack symptoms she&rsquo;s been to the¬†¬†</p>
<p>hospital spent forty thousand dollars worth¬†
of testing and nothing showed up and then we¬†¬†</p>
<p>find out i said when did you start well two¬†
weeks ago what day tuesday what did you eat¬†¬†</p>
<p>she was oh a big banana split i said okay laid¬†
it on my table started doing some work on her¬†¬†</p>
<p>and it was basically just a congested gallbladder¬†
backed up in the liver causing heart pain all¬†¬†</p>
<p>the all the heart symptoms went away so¬†
it&rsquo;s really really important to find out¬†¬†</p>
<p>what occurred just before you started having¬†
that problem i asked that question a lot</p>
<p>maltodextrin glycemic index way higher than¬†
glucose and sugar so obesity is a symptom¬†¬†</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not if you focus on obesity you&rsquo;re going to¬†
basically you&rsquo;re not going to be as successful¬†¬†</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming from too much insulin so i have¬†
people focus on other indicators of health i¬†¬†</p>
<p>try to get them off the weight loss at first¬†
because they may not lose weight initially¬†¬†</p>
<p>especially if they have a slow metabolism¬†
so i always ask them how is your energy is¬†¬†</p>
<p>your hunger going away that&rsquo;s a good indication¬†
that the insulin is coming back in a good range</p>
<p>carb cravings if you still have carb cravings¬†
there&rsquo;s still there&rsquo;s a problem with your blood¬†¬†</p>
<p>sugars is your belly shrinking um there are people¬†
women that are actually menopausal that have a lot¬†¬†</p>
<p>of atrophy and it looks just like fat identical¬†
because what happens after menopause is sometimes¬†¬†</p>
<p>you have a spike in cortisol cortisol tends to¬†
turn muscle protein into glucose and then it¬†¬†</p>
<p>raises insulin so you have this loss of muscle¬†
looks like cellulite and fat and they&rsquo;re really¬†¬†</p>
<p>adamantly want to lose weight but this takes¬†
some time to heal this process so in the process¬†¬†</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re building up their proteins you know it¬†
takes months and months maybe even a year or two¬†¬†</p>
<p>to build up this protein back there where actually¬†
they&rsquo;re per volume the muscle is heavier than the¬†¬†</p>
<p>fat so everything is shrinking they&rsquo;re not losing¬†
weight you just have to teach them that this is¬†¬†</p>
<p>normal they have to know that so they&rsquo;re not¬†
setting themselves up for a loss so the most¬†¬†</p>
<p>important thing that a person could do to increase¬†
their health is to use their own fat as fuel¬†¬†</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s several advantages of doing this number¬†
one now you start running on ketones and there&rsquo;s a¬†¬†</p>
<p>lot of advantage it&rsquo;s a superior fuel more energy¬†
output appetite suppressant more efficient better¬†¬†</p>
<p>lipid profiles tumors can&rsquo;t consume ketones¬†
reduce oxidative stress and more o2 less co2¬†¬†</p>
<p>and then you have the benefits of reduction¬†
of insulin which is the common denominator¬†¬†</p>
<p>of so many health problems i mean inflammatory¬†
conditions heart of course diabetes the fatty¬†¬†</p>
<p>liver high cholesterol aneurysms stroke¬†
dementia other than that it doesn&rsquo;t have¬†¬†</p>
<p>any effects but it&rsquo;s actually pretty connected¬†
to everything so you get to do these two things¬†¬†</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a you know about the glycemic¬†
index there&rsquo;s actually an insulin index¬†¬†</p>
<p>too how many of you have not familiar with the¬†
insulin index okay those are that&rsquo;s a scale¬†¬†</p>
<p>that um it&rsquo;s all the non-carbohydrate triggers¬†
or the non-carbohydrate influences on insulin¬†¬†</p>
<p>and of course fat is the lowest effect¬†
on insulin but lean low low-fat protein¬†¬†</p>
<p>like whey protein is very high on the¬†
scale of the insulin index and this is why¬†¬†</p>
<p>the keto works really good because you have higher¬†
fat higher fat if you have a whole egg for example¬†¬†</p>
<p>versus the egg whites you have a much less insulin¬†
spike and this is important just understanding um¬†¬†</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re trying to do we&rsquo;re trying to create as¬†
much health benefit by the reduction of insulin¬†¬†</p>
<p>and so you have the lowering of carb we don&rsquo;t want¬†
to be afraid of fat and we need to understand that¬†¬†</p>
<p>scale but we also want to look at other ways of¬†
decreasing insulin and one of the biggest ways is¬†¬†</p>
<p>fasting intermittent fasting um fasting¬†
is not low carb it&rsquo;s no carb and uh¬†¬†</p>
<p>what happens there&rsquo;s a little hormone called¬†
the gip hormone in the small intestine that gets¬†¬†</p>
<p>activated every time you eat no matter what you¬†
eat so if you don&rsquo;t understand that you may not¬†¬†</p>
<p>put emphasis on fasting and realize that¬†
that&rsquo;s really important especially in the¬†¬†</p>
<p>helping people with really resistant weight¬†
problems and that&rsquo;s very beneficial so the¬†¬†</p>
<p>combination of both of these are vitally important¬†
insulin is a dominating hormone in the presence of¬†¬†</p>
<p>too much insulin a lot of the other hormones¬†
are suppressed especially growth hormone¬†¬†</p>
<p>insulin-like growth factor</p>
<p>and then you get uh when you consult¬†
people you get this thing where um¬†¬†</p>
<p>uh you find out they&rsquo;re on sorta keto uh how many¬†
of you ever had clients that are in sort of keto¬†¬†</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m not losing weight well what are you¬†
doing well on sort of keto well keto is like¬†¬†</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be in sorta keto i mean it just¬†
doesn&rsquo;t work it&rsquo;s like a switch there&rsquo;s¬†¬†</p>
<p>gonna be a point where you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not gonna¬†
get into ketosis there&rsquo;s a certain amount of¬†¬†</p>
<p>carbohydrates that you need to go below and if¬†
your metabolism is low it has to be even lower</p>
<p>so i know this might be hard to believe¬†
but some of your your patients or clients¬†¬†</p>
<p>do cheat occasionally and they¬†
don&rsquo;t tell you that they cheat¬†¬†</p>
<p>they keep it a little secret how many have¬†
ever had that happen once once before so¬†¬†</p>
<p>what happens is they keep a little secret and¬†
they do it again and again you&rsquo;re coaching¬†¬†</p>
<p>them and you go they&rsquo;re not getting results what&rsquo;s¬†
interesting about this is they tend to be a bit um¬†¬†</p>
<p>critical to kind of justify it and so i have¬†
learned in practice i have an advantage of being¬†¬†</p>
<p>a practice for 29 years i work with so many people¬†
that um i see this common scenario that happens¬†¬†</p>
<p>if a client comes in that&rsquo;s not¬†
progressing and they&rsquo;re critical¬†¬†</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ll say well you know i really¬†
don&rsquo;t like the color of your walls and¬†¬†</p>
<p>and your secretary is just so rude and i&rsquo;m not¬†
losing weight and i go thank you very much i have¬†¬†</p>
<p>a question is there anything that you&rsquo;re eating¬†
that you shouldn&rsquo;t be eating i look them right¬†¬†</p>
<p>in the eye and they&rsquo;ll look they&rsquo;ll do this¬†
like no they look down you know right there¬†¬†</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not telling the truth so i don&rsquo;t make them¬†
feel guilty says well what do you think about when¬†¬†</p>
<p>they ask you that question they go well i did have¬†
a little ice cream but it was organic you know¬†¬†</p>
<p>i said okay good anything else uh potato chips¬†
but i didn&rsquo;t have that many i got okay how many¬†¬†</p>
<p>do you have well i did have a bag okay and i¬†
just keep going anything else and you will be¬†¬†</p>
<p>shocked to find out these guys are consuming¬†
massive amounts of junk food on the side¬†¬†</p>
<p>found out this one lady she&rsquo;s doing literally i¬†
think a whole bag of oreo cookies every single day¬†¬†</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very important if you&rsquo;re coaching someone¬†
to know that because if you don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re¬†¬†</p>
<p>going to be uh trying something else and they&rsquo;re¬†
going to eventually leave and you&rsquo;re going to¬†¬†</p>
<p>be chop living so it&rsquo;s i spend a lot of time just¬†
keeping that communication line open so there&rsquo;s no¬†¬†</p>
<p>secrets i don&rsquo;t care if they cheat just¬†
tell me i want that communication line open</p>
<p>so for those people that have a very slow¬†
metabolism and i know you have some clients¬†¬†</p>
<p>that no matter what you do they just can&rsquo;t nothing¬†
works okay let&rsquo;s put you in a 500 calorie diet¬†¬†</p>
<p>still doesn&rsquo;t work have you exercised more it¬†
doesn&rsquo;t work strict keto it doesn&rsquo;t work you¬†¬†</p>
<p>ever have a client like that yeah they&rsquo;re usually¬†
menopausal they usually have the thyroid removed¬†¬†</p>
<p>the gallbladder removed they&rsquo;re pre-diabetic¬†
and they have a history of many different diets¬†¬†</p>
<p>and now they end up in your office and you&rsquo;re¬†
like okay what do i got to do with this¬†¬†</p>
<p>so what i will do is i&rsquo;ll i&rsquo;ll do all the things¬†
i told you then i&rsquo;ll start to go down the list and</p>
<p>start to really beef up no pun intended the¬†
intermittent fasting so i will decrease the¬†¬†</p>
<p>frequency of eating and i&rsquo;ll have them¬†
fast longer there&rsquo;s a really important¬†¬†</p>
<p>rule that i tell my clients and also even the¬†
videos right now is that don&rsquo;t eat if you&rsquo;re not¬†¬†</p>
<p>hungry do not eat if you&rsquo;re not hungry because¬†
then you&rsquo;re going to be hungry when you eat¬†¬†</p>
<p>because it stimulates insulin so then the blood¬†
sugar comes down so it&rsquo;s so simple and so these¬†¬†</p>
<p>individuals what happens is they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re going¬†
a long period of time and i told them they have¬†¬†</p>
<p>two meals a day i said are you hungry now i¬†
just eat them because you told me i said okay¬†¬†</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to one meal a day all right and i&rsquo;ll do¬†
that are they progressing sometimes they&rsquo;re not¬†¬†</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not really um seeing the um the changes¬†
that they really need and they have maybe a huge¬†¬†</p>
<p>belly and you just have to come up with something¬†
that&rsquo;s a little more powerful so i will um i&rsquo;ll¬†¬†</p>
<p>do this kind of a stair step method the first¬†
thing is i&rsquo;ll take their uh their um breakfast¬†¬†</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll say listen if you&rsquo;re in the morning¬†
if you&rsquo;re not hungry just don&rsquo;t skip it and¬†¬†</p>
<p>start pushing it forward to lunch and so pretty¬†
pretty much there the lunch the breakfast is gone¬†¬†</p>
<p>and so they have lunch and dinner and then what¬†
i&rsquo;ll do is i&rsquo;ll take the lunch and the dinner and¬†¬†</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll start squeezing them together and until¬†
the point where it&rsquo;s like a four-hour window¬†¬†</p>
<p>most people do very very well with this and i do¬†
have quite a few people doing this on my lab with¬†¬†</p>
<p>tremendous amounts of success some people need¬†
to do one meal a day the key is making sure they¬†¬†</p>
<p>have enough nutrients in that meal you know to¬†
prevent things like hair loss which i will cover¬†¬†</p>
<p>now some some people need to go even a little¬†
bit longer not everyone but i have put people¬†¬†</p>
<p>that fast to the point where they&rsquo;re eating once¬†
every other day now as long as your energy is good¬†¬†</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking the nutrients and you&rsquo;ll see that¬†
they&rsquo;ll finally start to change and i have had¬†¬†</p>
<p>a handful of people who were consuming one meal¬†
every other day make sure they do the sea salts¬†¬†</p>
<p>and electrolytes and they finally after all this¬†
time start losing weight so their metabolism is¬†¬†</p>
<p>so efficient that this is what they need and it&rsquo;s¬†
not that they&rsquo;re starving when they&rsquo;re not eating¬†¬†</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just they&rsquo;re basically eating their own¬†
fat when they&rsquo;re not eating and that&rsquo;s the concept¬†¬†</p>
<p>that you have to get across is that you are eating¬†
when you&rsquo;re not eating you&rsquo;re just eating your fat¬†¬†</p>
<p>so sleeping interesting had a lady who um she¬†
lifted three and a half million pounds at the gym¬†¬†</p>
<p>over course of a year and lost one single pound¬†
and she came in very depressed and i found out¬†¬†</p>
<p>she was not sleeping she was actually on the¬†
right she was eating pretty good but she was¬†¬†</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t sleeping so um i i actually worked with¬†
with sleeping i actually told her to stop watching¬†¬†</p>
<p>the news right before bed that was the big problem¬†
um i told her to start taking calcium magnesium¬†¬†</p>
<p>i did some work on her and she started sleeping¬†
like a baby and that was the only time that things¬†¬†</p>
<p>started to kick in she lost a lot of weight great¬†
before and after i mean don&rsquo;t underwrite sleep¬†¬†</p>
<p>like my wife and i went on a trip uh recently¬†
because we were like completely pale and white in¬†¬†</p>
<p>january so we went to the bahamas to this little¬†
remote little island where they have like no¬†¬†</p>
<p>internet no reception and it got dark around 6:30.¬†
there was nothing to do so we went to bed at 7 00¬†¬†</p>
<p>and i said well let&rsquo;s just go to bed we go to¬†
bed i s we think we slept for 13 or 14 hours¬†¬†</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never felt that better in my life it¬†
was amazing so i mean i&rsquo;ve been running on¬†¬†</p>
<p>maybe six hours if that just getting¬†
more sleep can create huge changes¬†¬†</p>
<p>in your in your blood sugars in your¬†
body so i need to do more of that¬†¬†</p>
<p>okay stress yes that can affect you i think out¬†
of all the stress people have a lot of the stress¬†¬†</p>
<p>comes from other people how many realize that¬†
people can stress people out certain personality¬†¬†</p>
<p>types you got the slow drivers that just really¬†
jack up my adrenals they&rsquo;re just driving and then¬†¬†</p>
<p>you have the antagonistic people but really the¬†
the worst case is the is the passive aggressive¬†¬†</p>
<p>the underminers they&rsquo;re the person they told¬†
you they stood up for you but they actually ruin¬†¬†</p>
<p>your reputation they&rsquo;ll say comments like well¬†
you&rsquo;ve done quite well for your educational level</p>
<p>what had this attorney come in to see me¬†
he said i said hey how did you find out¬†¬†</p>
<p>about me he says well out of all the¬†
quacks you seem to be the less weird</p>
<p>it was kind of a hint of a compliment but it&rsquo;s¬†
really kind of just taking my wind out so as¬†¬†</p>
<p>a as a practitioner you&rsquo;re always going to get¬†
a percentage of those people that come in that¬†¬†</p>
<p>are just you don&rsquo;t feel good when they&rsquo;re around¬†
them i screen those out right now i screen those¬†¬†</p>
<p>guys out and they constantly are nullifying¬†
your results if they get results there will¬†¬†</p>
<p>be someone else that worked on them wasn&rsquo;t¬†
you or they&rsquo;ll say comments like hey that&rsquo;s¬†¬†</p>
<p>a nice sweater was that on sale like oh you¬†
got a haircut was that cheap cuts and like¬†¬†</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just something about them you don&rsquo;t really¬†
like but i do have a way of i finally figured out¬†¬†</p>
<p>a way of getting back at these people revenge¬†
you want to know how i do it you can do but how¬†¬†</p>
<p>many of you have clients like this yeah this¬†
is what you do it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a great great thing¬†¬†</p>
<p>you when they start doing that all you do is you¬†
just look them right in the on the face look them¬†¬†</p>
<p>really close and just say what¬†
what&rsquo;s that has that been growing¬†¬†</p>
<p>has that been growing you should probably get¬†
that checked out yeah get your liver checked out¬†¬†</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing¬†
to you they&rsquo;re introverting you¬†¬†</p>
<p>you just flip it they&rsquo;ll be in the bathroom¬†
for hours looking at that little back there¬†¬†</p>
<p>and like oh my gosh is that the coronavirus¬†
and then just get them out of your space and¬†¬†</p>
<p>but with this attorney that came in uh what¬†
i did is i said um i knew i did not want to¬†¬†</p>
<p>take him on so i said i tell you what this¬†
is what i want to do go up to the front¬†¬†</p>
<p>and i have a bottle of calcium it&rsquo;s four dollars¬†
i want you to buy that go ahead and try that if¬†¬†</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work i can&rsquo;t help you never saw him¬†
again so nice way of getting rid of those guys¬†¬†</p>
<p>but stress is a really really key thing to oh my¬†
gosh exercise either over exercising over training¬†¬†</p>
<p>or not exercising at all so regular consistent¬†
exercise um creates some really nice effects with¬†¬†</p>
<p>a lot of things autophagy the¬†
cleaning up of old damaged tissue¬†¬†</p>
<p>protects your immune system keeps your body full¬†
of oxygen but i had one lady who came in she was¬†¬†</p>
<p>uh exercising i&rsquo;m not kidding six hours a day¬†
and no weight loss six hours a day at the gym</p>
<p>so she was over training so i had her which took a¬†
long time to do this but i got her to exercise um¬†¬†</p>
<p>like for an hour twice a week and she started¬†
to lose the weight and it was really a weird¬†¬†</p>
<p>brain strain because she didn&rsquo;t realize that¬†
overture i mean the benefit of exercise occurs¬†¬†</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sleeping the 48 hours later not during¬†
the exercise exercise is a stress the benefits are¬†¬†</p>
<p>delayed she didn&rsquo;t understand that um okay¬†
bloating so you you i do recommend vegetables¬†¬†</p>
<p>for most people but if they start bloating i take¬†
them off of it because they might have sibo small¬†¬†</p>
<p>intestinal bacterial overgrowth they might not¬†
deal with them and so there&rsquo;s been a handful of¬†¬†</p>
<p>people not the majority that would just can&rsquo;t do¬†
well on vegetables so i will adjust what i do but¬†¬†</p>
<p>i do i&rsquo;ll tell you why i recommend more vegetables¬†
in a bit but if they&rsquo;re bloating that can cut down¬†¬†</p>
<p>on the weight loss because they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re fluid¬†
retained they&rsquo;re just holding the stress in the¬†¬†</p>
<p>gut and that&rsquo;s happened a handful of times so you¬†
want to you know just kind of look at that as well</p>
<p>okay next thing is the transitional phase¬†
when you&rsquo;re getting into ketosis there&rsquo;s¬†¬†</p>
<p>a thing called keto fatigue has anyone¬†
ever experienced that so i had a chance¬†¬†</p>
<p>to just work with a lot of people and find¬†
out this is mostly potassium deficiency¬†¬†</p>
<p>and when you do keto you&rsquo;re no longer running¬†
in carbs so you&rsquo;re going to dump a lot of fluid¬†¬†</p>
<p>because carbs retain fluid with that fluid becomes¬†
electrolytes not just potassium but sodium now our¬†¬†</p>
<p>bodies tend to retain sodium more than potassium¬†
we don&rsquo;t have um any mechanism to retain potassium¬†¬†</p>
<p>hardly at all so there&rsquo;s this false information¬†
being spread that spread out there that potassium¬†¬†</p>
<p>is dangerous on our body if you have well¬†
of course if you have staged kidney disease¬†¬†</p>
<p>yes but if you have healthy kidneys it&rsquo;s not¬†
dangerous in fact potassium is protective of¬†¬†</p>
<p>the kidney if you want date on that i have amazing¬†
research on that you can you can ask me later but¬†¬†</p>
<p>but the thing about potassium is out of¬†
all the nutrients we need potassium in¬†¬†</p>
<p>large amounts 4,700 milligrams a day if you take¬†
a look at what you have to eat to consume that¬†¬†</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find out the majority of¬†
people are just not consuming enough potassium¬†¬†</p>
<p>so um potassium is involved with a lot of things¬†
fluid exchange energy it buffers uric acid¬†¬†</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really an effective thing for blood¬†
pressure wow it just brings blood pressure¬†¬†</p>
<p>down there&rsquo;s a lot of data on this also heart¬†
rhythm rhythm um really helps with arrhythmias¬†¬†</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s involved in the¬†
pacemaker nerve and energy muscle¬†¬†</p>
<p>making hcl but the main purpose of¬†
potassium is involved in the sodium¬†¬†</p>
<p>potassium pump in the cells so you have¬†
these little pumps on the cell surface that</p>
<p>you have a billion of them let¬†
me just go right to that first¬†¬†</p>
<p>yeah this is what they look like they have one¬†
purpose to keep the potassium inside the cell¬†¬†</p>
<p>and the sodium outside the cell to keep this¬†
electrical gradient to keep these two minerals¬†¬†</p>
<p>separate that forms through the help of the¬†
insulated wall of that cell it helps to form¬†¬†</p>
<p>develop a battery the body allocates¬†
30 of all of its energy to these pumps¬†¬†</p>
<p>and what the what what this energy this¬†
electrical energy does is it it activates¬†¬†</p>
<p>the nerve and the muscle tissue so if you&rsquo;re¬†
deficient and this pump doesn&rsquo;t have enough¬†¬†</p>
<p>raw material you&rsquo;re going to get weakness¬†
and uh in the muscle and things like that and¬†¬†</p>
<p>so this is one wikipedia so you know it&rsquo;s true¬†
they said it&rsquo;s the causes of hypokalemia low¬†¬†</p>
<p>potassium is uh look at the cause one of the¬†
causes is going a ketogenic diet i don&rsquo;t know if¬†¬†</p>
<p>i believe that but i do know that you&rsquo;d lose fluid¬†
um with this and so that could be the reason why¬†¬†</p>
<p>also one of the big symptoms of hypokalemia the¬†
first one is feeling tired so if you if you&rsquo;re¬†¬†</p>
<p>into exercise and you&rsquo;re doing endurance exercise¬†
if you take a little more potassium you&rsquo;re going¬†¬†</p>
<p>to find you can go a lot longer too because your¬†
your cellular pumps have are are recharged so</p>
<p>to prevent that i i recommend foods that are high¬†
in um potassium on the ketogenic diet i don&rsquo;t want¬†¬†</p>
<p>to get too much into this but the potassium and¬†
the the insulated phospholipid layer on the cell¬†¬†</p>
<p>acts as a capacitor which basically stores¬†
electrical charge your cells are batteries and¬†¬†</p>
<p>if you divide the amount of voltage which¬†
is uh 150 microvolts inside the cell by¬†¬†</p>
<p>the thickness of the wall which is very small¬†
it can yield electrical fields in excess¬†¬†</p>
<p>of 200 kilovolts that&rsquo;s 200,000 volts¬†
so certainly enough to break down any¬†¬†</p>
<p>most insulators so if you compare that¬†
to anything like underground cables¬†¬†</p>
<p>it smokes anything else so your cells are just¬†
amazing how it can generate this incredible¬†¬†</p>
<p>amount of voltage and activate muscles and if you¬†
make sure that you give it the right nutrients¬†¬†</p>
<p>beet tops have the most potassium per cup¬†
1300 so i mean i don&rsquo;t consume beet tops so¬†¬†</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh spinach the problem with spinach that¬†
i have on the keto is it&rsquo;s high in oxalates¬†¬†</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re prone to kidney stones i have them avoid¬†
spinach brussels sprouts 600 something cabbage 300¬†¬†</p>
<p>tomatoes 400 swiss chard so you can see avocados¬†
830 milligrams asparagus 400 so typically speaking¬†¬†</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get a little more potassium with¬†
greens um but you can also get them from lamb you¬†¬†</p>
<p>can get potassium from lamb 2 268 for 3 ounces¬†
can of tuna is 280 round steak 3 ounces of 300¬†¬†</p>
<p>so you really just have to you should probably uh¬†
yourself or with a client just start calculating¬†¬†</p>
<p>how much potassium is a person really eating and¬†
you may find that it&rsquo;s not even close so you may¬†¬†</p>
<p>want to substitute with calcium citrate or another¬†
type of calcium i&rsquo;m sorry potassium okay keto flu¬†¬†</p>
<p>is purely a salt deficiency sodium or chloride¬†
no one&rsquo;s really talking about chloride salt is¬†¬†</p>
<p>composed of 40 sodium 60 chlorides chlorides are¬†
really necessary to make the hydrochloric acid¬†¬†</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a very important mineral just as sodium¬†
so when you do keto you do need more sea salt¬†¬†</p>
<p>and so that will take care of the flu¬†
flu-like symptoms very quickly and also weak¬†¬†</p>
<p>muscles here&rsquo;s another gem if you¬†
don&rsquo;t know this this is a no-brainer¬†¬†</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have clients come to you that have¬†
peripheral neuropathy and there&rsquo;s a really good¬†¬†</p>
<p>remedy that seems to work the majority of the¬†
time because hyperglycemia depletes vitamin b1¬†¬†</p>
<p>and b1 is involved in making myelin sheath it&rsquo;s¬†
it protects the cells against the complications¬†¬†</p>
<p>of high sugar it&rsquo;s considered a nerve vitamin¬†
when you&rsquo;re low in b1 you get neuritis¬†¬†</p>
<p>you get that excessive thinking thinking and¬†
like nervous anxiety um i like the best source of¬†¬†</p>
<p>b1 being nutritional yeast it&rsquo;s more of a natural¬†
type it rids lactic acid so if you put someone on¬†¬†</p>
<p>metformin one of the side effects it&rsquo;s rare is¬†
lactic acidosis b1 reduces that complication¬†¬†</p>
<p>so if you have someone on metformin if you¬†
have on b12 and b1 that would be very smart¬†¬†</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s involved in four different steps in the¬†
krebs cycle and the mitochondria in the generation¬†¬†</p>
<p>of atp so it&rsquo;s like the spark plug that occurs¬†
when you have fuel and oxygen coming into that¬†¬†</p>
<p>krebs cycle and so if you&rsquo;re not if you&rsquo;ve¬†
been on a high carb diet you&rsquo;ll deplete b1¬†¬†</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you start getting¬†
the complications of diabetes and¬†¬†</p>
<p>mainly it&rsquo;s the destruction of the vascular the¬†
capillary function the blood flow to the nerve¬†¬†</p>
<p>and the eye and the nerve and the also the¬†
epithelial cells in the heart and the kidney¬†¬†</p>
<p>as well as in the um the peripheral nerves¬†
not to mention the brain um so ben thought¬†¬†</p>
<p>to me if you&rsquo;ve never heard of this it&rsquo;s a fat¬†
style will be one uh it&rsquo;s a no-brainer it it&rsquo;s¬†¬†</p>
<p>quite miraculous and they made it fat soluble¬†
to penetrate the myelin sheath in the brain¬†¬†</p>
<p>and it can be absorbed i think it&rsquo;s seven to nine¬†
times more than waterside will be one but it&rsquo;s a¬†¬†</p>
<p>really um you start like you just get a bottle¬†
of it and have them take uh you know four four¬†¬†</p>
<p>times a day whatever the recommended dosage is and¬†
uh it seems to work for peripheral neuropathies¬†¬†</p>
<p>i will say that some people if it&rsquo;s¬†
really bad it does take months to kick in¬†¬†</p>
<p>alpha lipoic acid also is good as well¬†
but it reduces the oxidative stress¬†¬†</p>
<p>and the complications of diabetes i have a lot¬†
of references if you want it hair loss okay¬†¬†</p>
<p>so you have sometimes people say well keto is very¬†
healthy because you&rsquo;re going to lose all your hair¬†¬†</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s probably um if you&rsquo;re¬†
doing it incorrectly if you¬†¬†</p>
<p>the the main thing with the hair loss¬†
is you need certain trace minerals¬†¬†</p>
<p>not just for the thyroid um but for the hair¬†
directly so the two trace minerals that seem¬†¬†</p>
<p>to work the majority of time are zinc and selenium¬†
and they both are actually involved in the thyroid¬†¬†</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s biotin is another really good one as¬†
well if someone has gut issues it could be the¬†¬†</p>
<p>reason why they&rsquo;re not your body makes biotin¬†
so it could be either that you have you don&rsquo;t¬†¬†</p>
<p>have the friendly bacteria to make biotin or¬†
you have gut damage that you&rsquo;re not able to¬†¬†</p>
<p>absorb that biotin so sometimes i&rsquo;ll give people¬†
biotin in higher amounts to kick in the hair¬†¬†</p>
<p>but zinc is a really important thing¬†
so what i do is i make sure that¬†¬†</p>
<p>they do what&rsquo;s called a healthy¬†
version of keto which is high density¬†¬†</p>
<p>nutrient foods especially the trace¬†
minerals and that would be the shellfish¬†¬†</p>
<p>these are high zinc foods tuna eggs pumpkin¬†
seeds lamb fish as well as selenium is another¬†¬†</p>
<p>important one selenium is probably one of the¬†
most important trace mineral antioxidants really¬†¬†</p>
<p>important in the thyroid especially hashimoto&rsquo;s¬†
because you have all this inflammatory reactions¬†¬†</p>
<p>and to counter all that free radical damage¬†
that&rsquo;s happening with hydrogen peroxide and¬†¬†</p>
<p>so selenium is really important and where do you¬†
get it you get it actually in fish and seafood so¬†¬†</p>
<p>this is just a chart to show you the the mercury¬†
some people are concerned about mercury as long as¬†¬†</p>
<p>you have enough selenium it&rsquo;ll counter the mercury¬†
so like the three types of fish that you wouldn&rsquo;t¬†¬†</p>
<p>want to consume would be pilot whale which i know¬†
i i really love that uh mako shark or swordfish¬†¬†</p>
<p>but everything else is is pretty good so you¬†
don&rsquo;t necessarily have to work worry about that¬†¬†</p>
<p>selenium tuna brazil nuts eggs sardines halibut¬†
sunflower seeds spinach and beef shellfish you¬†¬†</p>
<p>can see that different different uh nutrients¬†
contain a lot of different trace minerals uh so a¬†¬†</p>
<p>well rounded meal would be fine shellfish i think¬†
is is great for keto as long as it&rsquo;s a you know¬†¬†</p>
<p>healthy version key additional because i&rsquo;m¬†
trying to go fast because i can see the times¬†¬†</p>
<p>running out here key foods i do recommend¬†
a small amount of dairy for certain people¬†¬†</p>
<p>but if they start getting acne if they¬†
have problems with fibroids if they have¬†¬†</p>
<p>a prostate problem i&rsquo;m going to take them¬†
off dairy um but because i&rsquo;m from wisconsin¬†¬†</p>
<p>um i like high quality dairy and of course i do¬†
the grass-fed uh organic um at halloween we gave¬†¬†</p>
<p>out um these little mini packs and you know these¬†
kids just don&rsquo;t come back anymore i don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>i want to thank you for coming and listening and¬†
have a wonderful afternoon thank you very much</p>
