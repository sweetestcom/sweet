    <p>Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Welcome to the all in podcast with us today again.</p>
<p>The Queen of Kinhwa, David Freeberg, David Sachs, the rain man himself.</p>
<p>And of course, the dictator here, Chamath. And let&rsquo;s get ready. It&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Chamath and Sachs. Here it comes, everybody. Sachs is ready in the red corner.</p>
<p>Representing Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and rich people everywhere.</p>
<p>David, the rain man, Sachs. And in the blue corner, representing the underserved,</p>
<p>the forgotten, the underdogs, the woke left, Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride. Rain man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans, and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, guys. I&rsquo;m the Queen of Kinhwa. I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>And I will also be representing John F. Kennedy, who said a rising tide lifts all boat,</p>
<p>and maybe even some Bill Clinton, too. Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton, I was going to say.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the champion of the left and the right. Yeah.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton did a great job. He ended the welfare state.</p>
<p>All right. So here we go, folks. In show housekeeping, we do need to point out</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been running some polls. The fans of the show have been running polls. And I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know why I&rsquo;m bringing this up because I got barbecued in them. But we have three polls we need</p>
<p>to share with the audience from Twitter. The first is if you could have just one of the all</p>
<p>in pod besties to mentor you and your startup growth, who would it be and why? Looks like</p>
<p>Rain Man, you ran away with that one with 39 percent. The Dictator with 34. Queen of Kinhwa</p>
<p>coming in at 17. And Uber&rsquo;s their fourth investor came in with a measly 8 percent.</p>
<p>I will tell you, this is why 83 percent of startups fail. They choose the wrong mentor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Perfect.</p>
<p>So I was proud to win this one. But the truth is, so Chamath was slightly ahead.</p>
<p>And then I put my thumb on the scale by retweeting the poll, because obviously my followers are more</p>
<p>likely to vote for me. So then I shot ahead and I kept real quiet because I didn&rsquo;t want Chamath</p>
<p>retweeting it to his one point two million followers. And if he had done that, he probably</p>
<p>would have blown me out of the water. But I kept real quiet till the time elapsed.</p>
<p>And then I and then I shared it with the group.</p>
<p>Nobody keeps a track of followers, but it&rsquo;s actually closer to one point five.</p>
<p>The only person who knows your follower count better than you, Chamath, is Phil Hellmuth.</p>
<p>Actually, every morning, Phil Hellmuth subscribe,</p>
<p>subtracts his number of subscribers from yours to know the net. All right. Second poll came up.</p>
<p>Thanks, Matt, for this, by the way. Matt Yarger, no friend of mine.</p>
<p>All right, per request. Let&rsquo;s do another poll and see the other side of the story. If you could have</p>
<p>just one of the all in pod besties moderate your podcast, who would you choose? And it turns out</p>
<p>the dictator 31% to my 30.6% a full 1% more than me. I came in second world&rsquo;s best wingman and</p>
<p>rain man. 21% queen of King Wah 16%. And then most importantly, which bestie would you want in</p>
<p>your on your side in a bar fight? I will say Chamath smooth velvety voice that that ran away</p>
<p>for him here. Thank you. Yeah, I think I think that I think the audience is just trying to hurt</p>
<p>Jason. They&rsquo;re just trying to hurt Jason. That was it. That was it. Jason has heard he&rsquo;s inadequate</p>
<p>by more than 1%. Usually, it&rsquo;s measured in inches, not percentages. Somebody was dunking</p>
<p>on me on Twitter. And they&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re the poorest of all your friends. I was like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the strategy. Always have more powerful and richer friends than you. Then you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to worry about picking up the check. Okay. And then there was another interesting AI breakthrough</p>
<p>this week. Did you talk about the bar fight? What was the bomb curious? The bar fight one? Hold on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. I didn&rsquo;t get to that one. The bar fight was Oh, here we go. For some reason.</p>
<p>These morons seem to think that your stick legs are going to help them in a fight.</p>
<p>Bro, that&rsquo;s a bad. Honestly, I need to correct this. Like that was maybe bad lighting or a bad</p>
<p>camera. You&rsquo;re holding up a Pandora&rsquo;s box right now. Honestly, they&rsquo;re not there. Guys, guys,</p>
<p>guys, guys, guys, honestly, come on. They are not as skinny as people seem to be railing. And</p>
<p>honestly, I&rsquo;m happy to, you know, if there&rsquo;s a standard way of measuring proof, okay, you know</p>
<p>what, Jason, if there&rsquo;s a standard way, if somebody can tell us what is the standard way of</p>
<p>measuring leg circumference, I&rsquo;m happy to submit my, my, my measurements. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>that skinny. They&rsquo;re really, really anorexic. Super disturbing. Thank you. You got a lot going</p>
<p>on up top. I&rsquo;m very proud of you. But below the belt. It&rsquo;s not true, bro. I work on my legs a lot.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s keep working. It&rsquo;s legs and abs to keep your back strong.</p>
<p>One thing this, this podcast will win in a poll is the hosts talk about themselves more than any</p>
<p>other podcast on the internet. We need to talk about each other in order to make fun of each</p>
<p>other. Yeah, this should be called the navel gaze podcast. All right, here we go. So besties that</p>
<p>you most want in a fight Queen of quinoa coming in dead last. Yeah, I&rsquo;m coming in at 17%. Rain</p>
<p>Man 32%. And Shamath, I guess that thirst trap you tweeted got you 39% in that bowl.</p>
<p>I the other thing these polls is why democracy doesn&rsquo;t work, but go on. I can I can hold my</p>
<p>own in a physical altercation. I think I think you want Shamath and I because I think sax is</p>
<p>going to be under the table calling 911. And Freeberg is going to try to talk it out and get</p>
<p>just absolutely sucker budge. Like guys, we don&rsquo;t really need to buy.</p>
<p>Jason Jason is the one that would smash the beer bottle, create a shiv and say let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go. I would I would have Jason, I would I would actually pick Jason as number and</p>
<p>if you were going to be in a bar fight, Jason certainly touts his taekwondo skills.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion, he&rsquo;s claimed to be an expert in taekwondo.</p>
<p>Can we pull up the video? Isn&rsquo;t there a video of you doing?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the video of Jason pushing help you?</p>
<p>If you want to see Jason and a grown man, another grown 50 year old overweight man fighting,</p>
<p>we have video. Yeah. Well, that one, I don&rsquo;t know if we should show but Nick,</p>
<p>you should definitely insert the image of J Cal trying to do the taekwondo kick and it</p>
<p>looks like he&rsquo;s about to have a herniated groin. It&rsquo;s about to fall over. Yeah,</p>
<p>I was in my 20s. All right, let&rsquo;s start Jason. What do you got? What do we got this week?</p>
<p>I guess the topic we should get right to is inflation. This is a topic we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about a whole bunch. Because we&rsquo;re printing a ton of money. Everybody seems to think the hedge</p>
<p>against inflation is to buy Bitcoin, or do you put your money into equities? And are we actually</p>
<p>going to see things other than homes and education, massively inflate? We&rsquo;ve seen some anecdotal</p>
<p>evidence of this. Tesla increased the price of their cars, used cars have gone up in price,</p>
<p>which is a function of the lack of production of some cars during the pandemic. So there might</p>
<p>be a multitude of factors there. But just putting it out there, are we going to go are we going to</p>
<p>face inflation that you know, goods and services are going to just go through the roof and cost?</p>
<p>Or do we have enough efficiency in the system that the average consumer is not going to see</p>
<p>massive inflation on the products and services they buy? Coming out of the</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the real issue that Chamath says inflation is good, and he because it creates a quality and</p>
<p>he thinks 1979 was a great year. I think we should go straight to that.</p>
<p>Give a general discussion. Let&rsquo;s go. I think we should go to Chamath to explain his tweet storm.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll respond. Okay, there. So I think David, you got unnecessarily emotional and</p>
<p>personal that was not again, these these were things that I&rsquo;ve learned from someone who I</p>
<p>will say without betraying him is an extremely well respected person at an extremely well known</p>
<p>institution that basically has helped make a lot of sort of, you know, capital allocators,</p>
<p>very smart about things and has made people a lot of money. So I was relaying what I learned</p>
<p>through him. So let me just relay that, again, and I&rsquo;ll just start with this. Whenever you have a</p>
<p>dollar of income, you can do one of two things with that income, you either consume things,</p>
<p>right, so you buy, or you can save and you can put it into investments for the future,</p>
<p>right? So consumption and investment. The reality is that most people so the lower 60% of the income</p>
<p>distribution essentially spends above their income, right, the lowest actually spends at</p>
<p>so $1 earned is $1 spent, and then the middle two, because they have access to credit $1 earned,</p>
<p>they spend about, you know, percentage points more than that, when you get to the richest</p>
<p>20% of the population, they&rsquo;re actually able to save and they save about 13 cents of every</p>
<p>dollar and they&rsquo;re able to invest in the future. So consumption and investment,</p>
<p>the reality is inflation comes through a volume of activity, right? So you as a rich person can</p>
<p>go and buy one $100,000 necklace at Tiffany&rsquo;s, it doesn&rsquo;t move the needle for inflation. But when,</p>
<p>you know, 200,000 people buy $1,000 television, that&rsquo;s felt in the economy, it moves. So inflation</p>
<p>comes because of gross tonnage of volume. So you need consumption. And by definition,</p>
<p>what that does is it pushes consumption into those, you know, that 60 to 80% of people that</p>
<p>are not the top 20%. So what it means is that, you know, you have a volume game of people buying</p>
<p>things. And when they buy more of those things, inflation goes up, how do they buy more things,</p>
<p>they have more income because their propensity is to consume. So then you have to ask yourself,</p>
<p>where is this incremental income coming from? And all he has observed, which I think is very</p>
<p>credible is we had the supernatural event in the pandemic, we&rsquo;ve now started to print trillions of</p>
<p>dollars of incremental consumption. And that&rsquo;s going to start to lead to the most simple ways</p>
<p>in which consumption manifests in inflation, which is via commodity prices. What does that mean? Let</p>
<p>me state simply, a rich person lives in a well insulated house, drives an electric car, and</p>
<p>eats fish. A less rich person lives in a poorly insulated house, lives, you know, drives an SUV,</p>
<p>and eats beef, beef versus fish. As a simple example, it consumes 2030 50 100 times more</p>
<p>input costs to generate that same pound of protein that a fish does. It&rsquo;s just an example of showing</p>
<p>how income distributions and the effects and the consumption patterns of large swaths of people</p>
<p>drive different consumption behaviors, which drive inflation. So all he was trying to represent to me</p>
<p>was that idea, which is that we have printed trillions of dollars, we are creating artificial</p>
<p>levels of consumption, that consumption will actually drive up commodity prices,</p>
<p>commodity prices will actually drive up inflation. Then what he told me was the best analogy,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s not perfect, but it rhymes to the history is what actually happened in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Which is that by having this sort of boundary condition, you have to ask yourself what will</p>
<p>happen if inflation rips higher. And, you know, starting in the late 60s, through the 70s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of what you had a same kind of boundary can forget the way in which the money got to</p>
<p>people, you know, in this case, it was a government check. But in the late 60s, and early 70s, we had</p>
<p>similar kinds of programs, we had Head Start, we have, you know, AmeriCorps, we had Food Stamps Act,</p>
<p>we had the Social Security Act, all of these things were transfer payments. And when you put</p>
<p>that much money into the hands of a large swath of people, consumption went up, commodity prices</p>
<p>went up, inflation went up, it peaked in 1979. But it also happened that when that happened,</p>
<p>the gap between the rich and the poor was the lowest it had ever been. And so I thought that</p>
<p>that was a really interesting thing to observe. Okay, sacks, you were triggered, you were triggered</p>
<p>by this. Well, I wasn&rsquo;t triggered. I just said it was my worst take ever. And then</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t my day you were triggered. It wasn&rsquo;t my day.</p>
<p>Let me explain what&rsquo;s wrong with the tape. I created a PowerPoint. So</p>
<p>I pulled a Chamath. No, it&rsquo;s not boring. And Chamath has done it too. So don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even go there. I&rsquo;m gonna do email. You guys come and hit me up in the second half.</p>
<p>No, no, no, we&rsquo;re gonna keep the Friedberg index high. So go ahead,</p>
<p>sacks. Take us through the PowerPoint. What do you want to say?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep this quick. Okay, so I&rsquo;ve called the PowerPoint Chamath&rsquo;s worst take ever.</p>
<p>David, it says right at the top of disclaimer, here is something I learned today. Why is it</p>
<p>my take? Well, you said you responded to me then saying that I didn&rsquo;t like facts. So</p>
<p>that was your response. So I am proving I&rsquo;m going to show you some facts. Okay.</p>
<p>So first of all, let&rsquo;s ask the question was 1979 a good year? I don&rsquo;t think you can just</p>
<p>cherry pick this one number, the Gini index and say that this was some sort of great year.</p>
<p>1979, a severe recession begins, which ultimately leads to negative point 3% GDP growth in 1980.</p>
<p>The word stagflation misery index become household terms. We had unemployment of 6%</p>
<p>on its way to 7.2%. In 1980. We had a 13.3% in inflation rate. The prime rate for 30 year</p>
<p>mortgage was 11.2%. Wow. Yeah, try to good luck trying to buy a house. We had long lines of the</p>
<p>gas pump. There was an oil embargo. Do you guys remember the gas pump lines? I wasn&rsquo;t born yet,</p>
<p>but go on. Yeah, it was crazy. And then you know, Jimmy Carter declares a national crisis</p>
<p>and confidence. This was the so called Malay speech. He was well on his way to becoming</p>
<p>a one term president. So what this shows is David, hold on, let me just do the takeaway.</p>
<p>So the takeaway is that, you know, the Gini index as 1979 was a great year. And, you know,</p>
<p>the issue is the reason it wasn&rsquo;t is because it&rsquo;s a lot easier to make everyone equally poor</p>
<p>than ever than equally rich when the economy does poorly, guess what the gap shrinks.</p>
<p>Then Margaret Thatcher had a great line about this. So long as the gap is smaller,</p>
<p>they would rather have the poor be poorer. That&rsquo;s a great video everyone should watch</p>
<p>on her last speech to parliament. Chamath posted this chart showing this is the percentage of</p>
<p>wealth held by the top point 1%. Chamath, we&rsquo;ll go to you next to explain one, two and three.</p>
<p>But let me just point out, look at when else the Gini index was plummeting the 1930s.</p>
<p>The Great Depression did a great job creating relative equality by making everyone poor. So</p>
<p>my point is, yeah, I understand there are these equalities, but you know what creates inequality</p>
<p>economic booms. That&rsquo;s what creates inequality. What we should care about is not just inequality,</p>
<p>but economic growth, real wage growth, poverty, how many people are below the poverty line,</p>
<p>and concentrations of power. So that&rsquo;s what we should be looking at not just this Gini coefficient.</p>
<p>Let me stop there. I&rsquo;ve got other slides, but I&rsquo;ll stop there and let you respond.</p>
<p>Go back one slide. The three points there were just interesting to me. Number one was</p>
<p>LBJ and the war on poverty and all those social programs. Number two, and you spoke about this,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re doing a full accurate assessment. What Carter&rsquo;s biggest mistake was,</p>
<p>was he stopped the transfer payments, because LBJ started them. Nixon continued them. Carter</p>
<p>stopped them. And I think it&rsquo;s important to frame</p>
<p>what transfer payments are for people who don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s basically like, you know, there are all kinds of ways to get money into the</p>
<p>hands of individuals. You know, we now talk about universal basic income. That&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>of transferring money from the government and from systemic holders of capital to individuals.</p>
<p>Food stamps was away, the social security was away. There&rsquo;s all kinds of different ways.</p>
<p>Welfare was away until Clinton disassembled that. So I think that what we&rsquo;ll never know</p>
<p>is what would have happened if Carter hadn&rsquo;t actually stopped those balance of payments.</p>
<p>And the key point is about what happened then afterwards in three. So you had this</p>
<p>basically stopping by Carter. He didn&rsquo;t get to reap any of the benefits of it.</p>
<p>Reagan comes in and says, you know what, we&rsquo;re going to simplify the tax code.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to defund all kinds of stuff, including, for example, all the mental health</p>
<p>defunding that he had already done in California that spewed people with mental health disease</p>
<p>onto the streets of San Francisco and Los Angeles. And that sort of continued. And then</p>
<p>the real cataclysmic change on top of all of this, which sealed the fate of that trend line happened</p>
<p>in point number three, which is when George George Bush in 2001 had this really seminal decision,</p>
<p>which is he had the ability to block China from entering the WTO, and instead he let them in.</p>
<p>And he traded that for a vote on the Security Council. And when you think about what really</p>
<p>happened there, you will unleashed 1 billion people willing to do anything at a cheaper,</p>
<p>faster and better rate, you ushered in globalization, you ushered in the gutting</p>
<p>of the middle class of America, and you transferred all that wealth creation that</p>
<p>could have happened in a more inefficient, but in a balanced way that could have benefited</p>
<p>Americans and you ship them abroad to China. So I think it&rsquo;s just interesting to note that</p>
<p>basically, since 1979, we&rsquo;ve all been singing from the same playbook. And, and I think that</p>
<p>maybe what we need to do is figure out whether we need to come back to this idea of shifting</p>
<p>the balance of payments back into the hands of individual consumers. And all I&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>without making a judgment, is when you look at what Biden has done in just in the first 60 days,</p>
<p>$1.9 trillion of stimulus, and a proposed $3 trillion stimulus package, we&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re not even infrastructure package, we&rsquo;re not even three months into his presidency,</p>
<p>and you forecast that forward, it feels like we&rsquo;re entering an era of spend, spend, spend.</p>
<p>And that was an opinion of mine, which I believe is actually fairly accurate. I do think it will</p>
<p>drive inflation, I do think it&rsquo;ll drive commodity prices. And I think on balance,</p>
<p>I do think it will suppress the wealth creation of the rich. And I do think it will give folks</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t necessarily have investments, the ability to make more in real income,</p>
<p>which they will spend. Well, okay, just just quickly. So I&rsquo;m going to begin by agreeing with</p>
<p>the part of Chamath&rsquo;s response that I agree with, which is what happened around 2000 2001,</p>
<p>which killed wage growth for the average worker. Chamath is right about that. But it wasn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>George W. Bush, it was a bipartisan disaster. In 2000, Bill Clinton pushes Congress to approve the</p>
<p>US China trade agreement, and gave them full access to the WTO. This was basically temporary MFN.</p>
<p>And look at what he said, he said, economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one way</p>
<p>street, it requires China to open its markets to us in new ways. And it turned out to be a one way</p>
<p>street the other way. And then he also said that for the first time, our companies will be able to</p>
<p>sell and distribute products in China made by workers here in America without being forced to</p>
<p>relocate manufacturing to China, we&rsquo;ll be able to export products without exporting jobs. Well, gee,</p>
<p>the exact opposite happened. So and then and then what happens in 2001 is Bush makes this situation</p>
<p>permanent. He grants permanent what&rsquo;s called permanent normal trade relations, which basically</p>
<p>MFN status in perpetuity to China, granting them full access to our markets. And Chamath is right,</p>
<p>that that devastated the average worker, because all of a sudden, they&rsquo;re being forced to compete</p>
<p>with, you know, foreign labor that&rsquo;s potentially making $2 a day, and is not subject to the same</p>
<p>labor laws and environmental laws as workers in the US are. So I agree with Chamath about what</p>
<p>happened then. But but I got to go back and clean up this view of what happened between 1980 and</p>
<ol start="2000">
<li>Because that&rsquo;s where I think we have this, this disagreement. Let&rsquo;s talk about the China</li>
</ol>
<p>thing for a second. Yeah, we made a mistake there. We got hoodwinked. We don&rsquo;t have access to their</p>
<p>market. I think it&rsquo;s, it would be good to pause for a second and say, Okay, we tried this experiment</p>
<p>for 20 years, there was some good that came out of it, our companies were able to grow and become</p>
<p>the dominant players in the world like Apple, but an Amazon, right, we did capture a lot of this</p>
<p>value. And a lot of people came out of poverty in China, I guess, on the margins, that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing, we can all agree. But it&rsquo;s a communist country. And we basically enabled a communist</p>
<p>country to become essentially, you know, our counterparty in running the planet and in our</p>
<p>leadership positions on the planet. What do we do now in terms of unwinding this? Is there a way to</p>
<p>roll this back? Or do we just mute it from this point forward? And how does it become a two way</p>
<p>street? Or is that just not even possible, as we&rsquo;ve seen with the NBA, and some other companies,</p>
<p>Twitter, Google, just not being allowed to even operate in China? Who&rsquo;s we? America,</p>
<p>the United States, the United States, I mean, US companies, global companies. I mean,</p>
<p>yeah, you know, I think that the challenge is your your framework, right? Guys, I think I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one big thing you&rsquo;re forgetting in 2001, which is, I think that Bush actually traded away</p>
<p>access to the WTO so that they could guarantee China&rsquo;s vote when he wanted to go to war with</p>
<p>Iraq, which happened in 2003. Okay, well, two dumb decisions that got worse by being put together.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is it was a trade, it was a trade, he traded, he traded access to he traded access</p>
<p>to the WTO in return for their support for a UN resolution to go to war with Iraq.</p>
<p>Look, I, you know, Chamath, you said that I was defending the Republican point of view. I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be the first to say that George W. Bush was his presidency was a disaster. I think it&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>down as one of the worst. He got us into all these stupid foreign wars in the Middle East,</p>
<p>he began them. I think the decisions with China were a mistake. So I certainly don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>defend that. And by the same token, I think the Clinton years were were generally great years</p>
<p>in America. So this is not a partisan analysis on my part. What do you think about the China</p>
<p>concept here and how we would go forward? And what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the path forward with China?</p>
<p>I mean, again, like, I think it comes down to your objective, and who are you solving for?</p>
<p>And who should we solve for democracy, the human species? Well, I mean, I feel like the environment,</p>
<p>the point of view that, you know, one government is innately better than another is being tested</p>
<p>and proven right and wrong every day right now. And, and I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s fair to say that</p>
<p>that just because the form of government that the you know, that the Chinese have kind of</p>
<p>adopted and used to govern their country and their people is innately wrong. There&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>things that are innately wrong in many democracies and that are innately wrong in many</p>
<p>non democratic republics. And so I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s fair to just say that, you know, that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really the objective is let&rsquo;s get rid of that communism. I mean, that was an easy kind of simple,</p>
<p>you know, check that you could use a few decades ago as a way to kind of rally everyone</p>
<p>emotionally towards some cause. But I think there&rsquo;s a lot of businesses today that operate</p>
<p>effectively in their own kind of geopolitical cloud. And it&rsquo;s a little bit of a kind of</p>
<p>misstatement to think that an American company is an American company. It&rsquo;s not that American</p>
<p>quote, unquote, American companies solely build their stuff and sell their stuff in the United</p>
<p>States. Many American quote, unquote, American companies build stuff overseas and sell stuff</p>
<p>overseas. And global is globalization as much as we might want to kind of poopoo the effects it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>had on the average quote, unquote, American worker. It really has transformed the way businesses</p>
<p>operate with respect to politics and countries. There&rsquo;s a God, what&rsquo;s the book, I can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>the book, but there&rsquo;s a book that speaks to how a lot of large multinational corporations today</p>
<p>effectively have to operate as if they were countries into an unto themselves. And so they</p>
<p>have competing interests with respect to what the average American or the American government or the</p>
<p>American people might have, even though they might be quote, unquote, American companies,</p>
<p>and there might be some intricate tie. And so I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s as simple as we have to quote,</p>
<p>unquote, defeat China, we are so intricately tied to the to the economy of China to the workers of</p>
<p>China, and vice versa. And I think that it&rsquo;s a much more complicated thing than you know,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s our three point checklist for how do we quote, unquote, beat China. And that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s hard. And that&rsquo;s why I think a lot of smart people have, you know, kind of taken on</p>
<p>and been challenged by and failed at trying to resolve a path forward where there&rsquo;s this quote,</p>
<p>unquote, looming enemy that is going to become the global economic power, which strips the American</p>
<p>people of their influence around the world. And you know, that may be kind of the inevitability</p>
<p>of the 21st century. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a dark inevitability if but I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>simple easy answer. And I don&rsquo;t know if from a from a business point of view, let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>company. I&rsquo;m not sure I necessarily feel the effects of one quote, unquote, country affecting,</p>
<p>you know, having more influence globally with other countries and others, it turns out a lot</p>
<p>of businesses have greater influence than a lot of governments. And so you know, one way to kind</p>
<p>of think about the evolution of globalization, and maybe even with respect to kind of the notion of</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve been talking about decentralization, is that maybe governments themselves become less</p>
<p>important in the 21st century. And it&rsquo;s the kind of decentralized online movements and businesses</p>
<p>and you know, other kind of entities that perhaps are not as regulated and controlled and owned by</p>
<p>governments. And, you know, maybe the big failure of the 21st century will be governments. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Chamath, you have that&rsquo;s on. Sorry, that was a bit esoteric. But</p>
<p>no, no, I think it&rsquo;s Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the thing, the thing that you&rsquo;re not willing to acknowledge is that even when GDP</p>
<p>shrinks, it&rsquo;s like a it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s shrinking from a base where there&rsquo;s substantive growth year</p>
<p>over year, like, you know, our the GDP in 1969, where LBG was president was less than a trillion</p>
<p>dollars, and the GDP now is like 23 and a half trillion dollars. And so it&rsquo;s been nothing</p>
<p>essentially but a straight line up. And so, you know, this idea that we the inflation causes,</p>
<p>you know, the only way that we close the wealth gap is by making everybody poor is not true.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re some people may be getting less rich at the same rate, so they feel poor. But the idea that</p>
<p>you actually become poor is just not true. It&rsquo;s a feeling that you have, but it&rsquo;s not rooted in fact.</p>
<p>So when you look at the wealth gap, are you concerned about the gap? Or are you concerned</p>
<p>with, you know, the status of the folks on the bottom and how much their lot in life has gotten</p>
<p>better? Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m concerned with both. Actually, there I have a slide on this, too.</p>
<p>I would buy this argument. And I&rsquo;ve heard this argument from before from people not as smart as</p>
<p>David, I would buy this argument if GDP did something other than go up in an absolute</p>
<p>straight fucking line. No, it doesn&rsquo;t. It doesn&rsquo;t. Well, hold on. I&rsquo;m gonna show me show GP in a</p>
<p>second. The first thing I want to just cover is that part of the problem with the Gini index</p>
<p>is it doesn&rsquo;t fully account for government transfers. This is something I didn&rsquo;t fully</p>
<p>know until I researched it after your tweet storm Chamath, but basically only 2% of the population</p>
<p>the publicly reported stats are that 13.5% of the US population lives in poverty. Once you actually</p>
<p>take into account all these programs and transfer payments, it&rsquo;s more like 2%. You can see this on</p>
<p>this chart on the left here, that the green represents the transfer payments. By the way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against transfer payments. I think we need a social safety net. I want the social safety net</p>
<p>to be as effective as possible. I don&rsquo;t want it to trap people in government dependency. I want it</p>
<p>to work. I want it to get people out of poverty and into the opportunity economy. I absolutely</p>
<p>believe we need a social safety net. We need these transfer payments. You can see that the green bars</p>
<p>there make a huge difference in reducing poverty. The Gini index doesn&rsquo;t really take that into</p>
<p>account. Well, how do you fund these types of transfer payments? The more of a stronger economy</p>
<p>that you have, the more that you have a government, the more that you have an economic boom,</p>
<p>the more that you see real wage growth and the ability to fund these programs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just look at GDP for a second. Let&rsquo;s go back to this period,</p>
<p>82 to 2000. I call this the Reagan-Clinton boom. I see this as a relatively bipartisan period</p>
<p>where under Reagan and Clinton, you had GDP growth of almost 4% compared to the usual 2%,</p>
<p>2.5%. By the way, this is why Reagan and Clinton left office with huge approval numbers despite</p>
<p>scandals. Remember, Reagan had Iran-Contra, Clinton had Lewinsky. None of that mattered</p>
<p>really in the eyes of the American people because the economy was so strong, and you can see that</p>
<p>here. By the way, it hasn&rsquo;t been this strong in the 2000s. We&rsquo;ve never really gotten back</p>
<p>to this type of economy since 2009. Is that because of the economic boom of the</p>
<p>PC and internet eras? What would we attribute it to?</p>
<p>The technology boom has a huge impact, but let me just describe what started it.</p>
<p>What happened in 1981? Reagan&rsquo;s inaugurated as president in January of 1981. He cuts the top</p>
<p>marginal income tax rate from 70% to 50%. I&rsquo;d say equally important, you have Paul Volcker at the</p>
<p>Fed. He breaks inflation. He jacks up interest rates, causes a very severe recession in 1982,</p>
<p>but it broke the back of hyperinflation. It ushered in decades of declining interest rates.</p>
<p>You can see that on this chart here. Interest rates have more or less been in the decline</p>
<p>since Paul Volcker was at the Fed. What does this do? It reduced the risk-free rate of return,</p>
<p>which leads to more investment in everything. It leads to more investment. It caused a rally</p>
<p>in the bond market and the stock market. By the way, no one remembers in a modern</p>
<p>area. I&rsquo;m sorry, Saxe, but like most interest rates for buying a home, mortgage rates were</p>
<p>over 6.5% for most of the last couple of decades. Yeah.</p>
<p>Good luck buying a home in the 1970s. David, can you actually be intellectually</p>
<p>honest and overlay aggregate actual GDP on this chart? Because what you&rsquo;ll see is it goes up and</p>
<p>to the right independent of all of this bullshit. No, that&rsquo;s not true. You can see it.</p>
<p>That is absolutely true. Can I share my screen now?</p>
<p>GDP growth rate versus&hellip; No, this is simple. Forget growth rate.</p>
<p>What is the actual number? Right. We&rsquo;re talking about the real number,</p>
<p>not the percentage growth, because I was actually about to ask the question.</p>
<p>The real number, guys. This is a change.</p>
<p>I know. This is the change in GDP. I know. I&rsquo;m talking about grade two</p>
<p>mathematics here, guys. The absolute number. The absolute number keeps going up and to the</p>
<p>right because&hellip; No, it doesn&rsquo;t. These dots that</p>
<p>are below zero are recessions in which GDP actually shrinks.</p>
<p>Those are changes from the year before. So when you&rsquo;re compounding naturally&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The green and red bars at the very bottom are changes</p>
<p>from the year before, but these are absolute percentage changes in GDP.</p>
<p>I know. A recession is defined as two quarters</p>
<p>of negative growth. So GDP can go down. David, can I just show you the aggregate</p>
<p>GDP growth from 1960 to 2000? And you can just look at this and tell me what&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>what is wrong with the trading economics website that that everybody else would use?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think one of the things that I have is a question for everybody is,</p>
<p>is there a is there a major difference between two percent, two and a half percent,</p>
<p>three percent growth in terms of how we all experience our lives?</p>
<p>And what are we optimizing there for? Are we optimizing for consistency or we opt in,</p>
<p>you know, no recessions? Well, this is what&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So do you see this chart right here? It&rsquo;s perfectly consistent with the</p>
<p>exception of the financial crisis. This is aggregate GDP. Okay, it started off</p>
<p>at less than a trillion in 1950 something. It was about, you know, a trillion dollars in 1968.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about $23 trillion now. This is the aggregate of what has</p>
<p>happened in the American economy over the last 70 years.</p>
<p>compounding interest is an amazing thing.</p>
<p>Now, exactly right. Now, this has happened in democratic presidencies,</p>
<p>Republican presidencies, when rates were at 16%, when rates were at 0%.</p>
<p>So all I&rsquo;m saying is we have a natural tendency and inertia to move forward,</p>
<p>the rate of change, we can debate. And obviously, it is ebbed and flowed over years.</p>
<p>But the fact that it&rsquo;s towards moving forward and downhill with increasing momentum is undeniable.</p>
<p>And so again, I would ask, when we think about the fact that the natural tendency is that the</p>
<p>next five or 10 year period, in aggregate will become bigger and better, there&rsquo;ll be more of the</p>
<p>pie to share. Why is inflation a bad thing? Because all it does is depress financial assets,</p>
<p>it drives up earnings and income, which drives up consumption of the lower three or four quartiles</p>
<p>of the lower three quartiles of the earnings population. I just don&rsquo;t see why it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>bad thing. I think I think mild, mild inflation, you know, in the two to 4% range is is fine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably better. It&rsquo;s certainly better, I would say than two to 4% deflation. But when</p>
<p>you start to get runaway inflation, like we did in the 1970s, it massively increases interest rates.</p>
<p>And that makes it harder for people to buy houses, and borrow money and invest money,</p>
<p>because now the risk free rate of return is higher. And that only applies, I know,</p>
<p>but that only applies to the top quartile of the population, the bottom three quartiles,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give a shit about what you just said, because they don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people want to have to spend $600 on a loaf of bread. You know, that&rsquo;s it. Look,</p>
<p>you look at Venezuela, you look at Weimar, Germany, you do not want inflation to get out</p>
<p>of control. And it can spiral out of control. Because once people start to expect</p>
<p>it, is that realistic, though, that it will spiral out of control, given technological</p>
<p>advances efficiency? I mean, what you backdrop, you are, you are bringing up, I think the really</p>
<p>brilliant point, which is, could it really even happen today? Because if you think about where</p>
<p>we allocate our time and attention and consumption, half of it, by definition, are things that are</p>
<p>just so naturally deflationary. We&rsquo;re all you know, we&rsquo;re on YouTube, you know, Facebook,</p>
<p>tick tock all the time. Those are naturally deflationary sinks of time and energy and</p>
<p>effort and money. Right. So today, to Jason&rsquo;s point, like, I think that that&rsquo;s actually true.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s even possible to actually have hyperinflation anymore.</p>
<p>Where do we have hyperinflation, NFTs, Bitcoin, equities, and financial assets,</p>
<p>financial and homes, right? I mean, and that&rsquo;s a highly regular and I guess healthcare and</p>
<p>educate higher education, those but pretty much anything that the government&rsquo;s involved in.</p>
<p>Basically, what the government&rsquo;s involved in NFTs and Bitcoin, those are the anti government</p>
<p>portfolio. But But by the way, healthcare inflation really started in Obama because</p>
<p>of Obamacare. Yeah, anything that the government&rsquo;s involved in inflates.</p>
<p>Yeah, because if the government&rsquo;s paying the bill, why wouldn&rsquo;t you raise prices?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no competitive market, there&rsquo;s one customer to charge whatever you want,</p>
<p>etc. So to be clear, I inflation is not my number one concern right now. I&rsquo;m just saying that it</p>
<p>would not be a good thing to let it get out of control. That&rsquo;s all. But it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the biggest concern on my list. Your main concern is dunking on Chamath for that tweet storm.</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m not dunking on him. He dunked on me saying that, you know,</p>
<p>basically turned into a bunch of 15 year old girls who said something and got misinterpreted</p>
<p>on social media. And now we have to work it out. And you the audience are the beneficiaries.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ll tell you, I&rsquo;ll tell you, my, my main concern is this idea that economic booms</p>
<p>are not a good thing. Because, you know, God forbid, the people at the top might get richer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem to that, then. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys have been following</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening with the head of operations at work. I guess he&rsquo;s the head of warehouses at</p>
<p>Amazon. Amazon is standing up to Elizabeth Warren on Twitter. They&rsquo;re mixing it up. Did you guys</p>
<p>see these tweets? Let&rsquo;s pull them out. No, it&rsquo;s cool. What? You haven&rsquo;t seen these? No.</p>
<p>Chamath, didn&rsquo;t you donate like some ridiculous amount of money to Elizabeth Warren&rsquo;s campaign?</p>
<p>No 25k just a little tasty poo. It was a little teaser bet. And I and I didn&rsquo;t like what I saw.</p>
<p>So I had to shut it down. I shut it down on the turn. The flop was not the flop.</p>
<p>You limped in you limped in with seven, four.</p>
<p>I limped in with seven, four offsuit. I put a little teaser bet out there. I didn&rsquo;t like what</p>
<p>I saw. And so I folded. Basically, Amazon is finally saying, Hey, we&rsquo;re just gonna,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna stand up when Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders kind of attack us and attack Bezos.</p>
<p>And they just said, Listen, you guys set the minimum wage, do your job. We move the minimum</p>
<p>wage at Amazon to $15 an hour. We made our decision, get back to work and set the federal</p>
<p>minimum wage of $15 an hour and stop telling us we don&rsquo;t pay our taxes because you make the tax law.</p>
<p>So essentially, this dovetails with the hearing. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys watched any of the</p>
<p>hearing with Zuckerberg and everybody, but basically, they were all seems like big tech</p>
<p>is just putting their foot down and saying, just tell us what you want us to do. Because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing it. We&rsquo;re giving people what Zuckerberg and Dorsey basically said is that if you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>that kind of speech, then why don&rsquo;t you prohibit it instead of telling us to do it? You can&rsquo;t and</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t because you know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a violation of the First Amendment. So that Yeah,</p>
<p>they were kind of pushing back on them saying, Listen, if you have such a problem with it,</p>
<p>pass a law. Yeah. And this guy, Dave Clark, you guys know Dave Clark at Amazon?</p>
<p>Nope. So this is the guy who&rsquo;s been mixing it up. And if the audience is listening, you can</p>
<p>see a bunch of this on the YouTube channel, because we will put in a while he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the number two guy there. He runs all he runs the entire retail business, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah. So now Amazon is on a full court press to engage with, let&rsquo;s call it the socialist left.</p>
<p>I guess they call themselves democratic socialists, because they don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>called socialists. And they&rsquo;re saying like, Listen, we give people health care, we give</p>
<p>them 15 bucks an hour. And if you want to tour the facilities tour the Philly, but nobody is</p>
<p>peeing in bottles. And then of course, the press and a couple of people showed bottles with pee</p>
<p>in them, that drivers can&rsquo;t stop to even go to the bathroom, which I think is a tragedy and</p>
<p>horrible. People should not have to pee in bottles. I mean, they asked me about on CNBC</p>
<p>today. I was like, Are you this is a serious question. Like, of course, nobody should be</p>
<p>peeing in bottles. But if you look at this exchange, I think we&rsquo;re kind of hitting the</p>
<p>end of this debate, which is everybody kind of agrees, we should have health care for</p>
<p>everybody in the country, we should have a $15 minimum wage. Why are we dunking and fighting</p>
<p>with each other? When we&rsquo;ve got this adversary, which is, or two adversaries with Russia and</p>
<p>China, we have these two crazy adversaries who want to build authoritarian countries and control</p>
<p>the economy and eventually control the planet. Why is why are Americans fighting with each other</p>
<p>over these issues? I mean, this is this is just incredible. I just want to read it. Bernie Sanders</p>
<p>says, I look forward to meeting with Amazon workers in Alabama on Friday. All I want to</p>
<p>know is why the richest man in the world Jeff Bezos is spending millions trying to prevent</p>
<p>workers from organizing a union so they can negotiate for better wages, benefits and working</p>
<p>conditions. To which he replies, all we want to know is why the senator is one of the most</p>
<p>powerful Paul&rsquo;s and polit politicians in Vermont for 30 plus years and their minimum wage is still</p>
<p>only 1175. Amazon&rsquo;s minimum wage is $15 plus great health care from day one. The senator</p>
<p>should save his finger wagging lecture until after he actually delivers in his own backyard.</p>
<p>To your point, it is getting to a point now where folks are like, Alright, guys, so step</p>
<p>up and change the laws and change the incentives. And I think that that&rsquo;s going to be really</p>
<p>important. sexy, you had something that you you were really miffed by what Zack said or something</p>
<p>at the thing. Oh, well, well, I what Zack was trying to do in that hearing that the</p>
<p>secretary guy, what&rsquo;s his name? Ben Thompson.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no, no, no, no, it&rsquo;s strategy. No strategy. He literally said it came to the poker game</p>
<p>that we do at the D conference, or the Rico conference, whatever it&rsquo;s called co conference.</p>
<p>And he said, it&rsquo;s true. Right? It&rsquo;s the worst. It&rsquo;s the worst name that was ever created.</p>
<p>strategy. Anyway, 100 bucks a year. He&rsquo;s got like 10,000 people paying for it. It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>What what makes the way he</p>
<p>Okay, great. So the way thank you for that. Thank you for that clarification.</p>
<p>What what Ben Thompson wrote the way he described Zuck statement is that Zuck was pulling up the</p>
<p>ladder on all the other social networking sites that might come afterwards. And it was, look,</p>
<p>it was one of those tactical maneuvers. That&rsquo;s in Facebook sort of narrow self interest, but it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>obviously in their self interest that, you know, people slam them for that. It&rsquo;s just too</p>
<p>Machiavellian. And basically, what Zuckerberg said is, listen, we now have over 30,000 people</p>
<p>doing content moderation, you guys should check you, the lawmakers should change section 230.</p>
<p>To say that, you know, you the social media sites only get section 230 protection,</p>
<p>the liability shield, if you engage in this kind of content moderation. But if you&rsquo;re a site that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t, then you don&rsquo;t get protection. What&rsquo;s what Zuckerberg trying to do? You know, small</p>
<p>startups can&rsquo;t hire 30,000 people to do content moderation. So this is like classic regulatory</p>
<p>capture, but done brazenly in the open at a congressional hearing. I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think it kind of makes a lot of sense from him. It&rsquo;s the game theory is pretty obvious,</p>
<p>which is like, okay, make it now impossible for anybody to compete with us. And you basically</p>
<p>lock us in forever, which it&rsquo;s pretty, pretty brilliant. The question is, what do you think</p>
<p>the odds are that politicians fall for this? I think they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re forcing their hand now.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t have a choice. Yeah, well, I mean, the democrats on that committee have basically</p>
<p>been saying that disinformation is a huge problem. And you the social media sites need to</p>
<p>correct it, you need to control it. And so Zuckerberg comes along and says, okay, great,</p>
<p>no problem. We&rsquo;ve hired 30,000 content moderators, we&rsquo;re going to do what you said. In fact, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to hire more. And by the way, if you really want to get tough about this, why don&rsquo;t you modify</p>
<p>section 230 to require it? Well, how many other startups can ever hire that number of content</p>
<p>moderators, this is creating a moat that will basically protect Zuck and Facebook forever,</p>
<p>right capture. Yep. And the other crazy thing in this was the stupid format they come up with,</p>
<p>where they give each person who&rsquo;s, you know, a senator or congressman who&rsquo;s a congressperson,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing the questioning, they give them five minutes. So they&rsquo;re like, I only want a yes,</p>
<p>no answer. And you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m going to ask you the most challenging problem in the world,</p>
<p>I need you to answer yes or no binary one or zero. And it&rsquo;s like, well, that&rsquo;s not kind of</p>
<p>how a nuanced issue works. Like section 230. This is going to take some time, can I get one minute</p>
<p>to answer the question, two minutes to answer the question. And so Jack and Zuckerberg and everybody</p>
<p>just kind of threw their hands up. They&rsquo;re like, I can&rsquo;t answer this in a yes, no, can you ask me,</p>
<p>give me 30 seconds to answer these questions. It was pretty ridiculous. And then they were trying</p>
<p>to get them all to say that their platforms were used for the January 6 insurgency. And I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with Zuck on much, but he was like, No, I think the people who were involved in January 6</p>
<p>were responsible for it. So whether that&rsquo;s the President or the people who broke into the</p>
<p>Capitol, they&rsquo;re the ones who are actually responsible for this. You guys didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>Yes. So no, I well, I read, I read some summaries of it. And I think Dorsey actually did a did a</p>
<p>great job. And I like I liked his performance. And let me read you a quote. Mike Solana tweeted this</p>
<p>So, but he said, Jack said, I don&rsquo;t think these decisions should be made by private companies</p>
<p>or the government, which is why we&rsquo;re suggesting a protocol approach to help the people make the</p>
<p>decisions themselves. That was Jack Dorsey. Now, that almost sounds like me, if he just changed</p>
<p>the word protocol to First Amendment case law. So I don&rsquo;t want these companies or the Senate</p>
<p>Judiciary Committee, you know, censoring people, I want to use a revered external standard, which</p>
<p>is the First Amendment case law that&rsquo;s been developed over the last two centuries. So Jack</p>
<p>wants to use a protocol, okay, but fine. But he&rsquo;s on the right track here, which is he&rsquo;s saying,</p>
<p>look, we don&rsquo;t want to be in the business of having this power to decide who&rsquo;s going to have</p>
<p>access to, you know, to the town square. And that&rsquo;s a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s also got a project there to turn social networks into open standards. So in other words,</p>
<p>the way we can all anybody can make an email client because email is an open standard,</p>
<p>anybody can build a web page or a browser, because HTML is an open standard. He wants to do that.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s working on that inside of Twitter, where anybody is going to be able to take their tweets,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to be decentralized. There&rsquo;s going to be no central server. And you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be able to bring your own algorithm. So if you feel the algorithm is causing you to see extreme</p>
<p>views, you can say I want mine to only lean towards, I want this one that leads towards</p>
<p>positivity and kindness, right? And somebody can make a third party, there&rsquo;s a rhythm that</p>
<p>gets rid of jerks. You guys probably saw this week, but a deal was announced and investment</p>
<p>was announced. And recent Sequoia, myself and a few others, we did this thing called bit cloud.</p>
<p>Oh, I heard about this. Yeah. So what is it just to give you a sense of it? It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing about it separately from a bunch of people.</p>
<p>Yeah. So I mean, like the in a nutshell, you know, what these guys did was they said,</p>
<p>okay, well, you know, we&rsquo;re just going to take, you know, this entire blockchain concept,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to fork it. And we&rsquo;re going to create this thing where folks can essentially</p>
<p>have one blockchain, they can, you know, have content around it, and then identify sort of</p>
<p>people and nodes. And all of a sudden, like we all have this currency that sits on top of this</p>
<p>bit cloud currency. And why that&rsquo;s interesting is their first app that they built on top of this</p>
<p>was basically a kind of a clone of Twitter, just kind of as a proof of concept app. And I think,</p>
<p>Jason, it&rsquo;s moving to a place where now people with reputation and people with trust can actually</p>
<p>signal that they have it. And then that&rsquo;s a probably a better way over time for folks like</p>
<p>us to figure out what is valuable and not valuable, what is trustworthy or not, irrespective of</p>
<p>whichever end of the spectrum is coming in off of and then if there is disinformation, you know,</p>
<p>that person&rsquo;s quote, unquote, bit cloud stock, right, that their token will fall in value,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll probably be a lot of interesting apps that are built on top of this, I was really</p>
<p>drawn to the general idea of the project. And I think that&rsquo;s what Andreessen and Sequoia probably</p>
<p>felt as well. So you know, there are these interesting solutions. There&rsquo;s bit cloud,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Jason, what you said, this open source project to Twitter, it&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s all going to</p>
<p>be really interesting. But I think if we can get to a way where we can quantify reputation and trust,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the another way of around working around the pulling up the ladder effect of of what</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter effectively told Congress this week. I want to talk to you guys about what</p>
<p>the hell what the hell is going on in the Suez Canal? And what does this mean? I mean, Freeberg,</p>
<p>what the fuck is this? This is unbelievable. You know, it&rsquo;s so random, and unfortunate, but this,</p>
<p>this ship that weighs 200,000 metric tons, that&rsquo;s taller, it&rsquo;s longer than the Empire State Building</p>
<p>is tall, going through the Suez Canal, which I think, you know, there&rsquo;s about 100 ships a day go</p>
<p>through the Suez Canal. And it&rsquo;s, you know, the Suez Canal really is, you know, kind of an amazing</p>
<p>engineering accomplishment that connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, it basically</p>
<p>allows ships from Asia to not have to go all the way around Africa to get to Europe.</p>
<p>And the ship goes into the Suez Canal, and it had a blackout, its power went out.</p>
<p>And so it just kept cruising without being able to control the steering, because there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>friggin power steering on these massive ships. You know, like, they don&rsquo;t have like a wire</p>
<p>connected to the rudder. And so, you know, no backup battery supply, I guess. No one knows,</p>
<p>but like the power went out and the total blackout on the ship, they couldn&rsquo;t get the power back on.</p>
<p>And the thing just keeps cruising and cruising and cruising. And it cruises right into the side,</p>
<p>which is this big sand barrier on either side of the Suez Canal. And it gets lodged in the sand</p>
<p>barrier on the side. Now, when you have 200,000 metric tons moving at a few miles an hour,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an incredible amount of momentum of energy. And so when it lodges in the side, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s lodged in there. And now it&rsquo;s stuck.</p>
<p>Mass times acceleration equals stuck.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s actually mass times velocity. But yeah, you&rsquo;re close. And so the thing just</p>
<p>basically got lodged in there, and they can&rsquo;t get it out. And now they think it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>take another week or two before they&rsquo;ll be able to kind of dig all around the sand and tugboat</p>
<p>the thing out of there. But I think what&rsquo;s interesting, so 10% of global trade moves</p>
<p>through the Suez Canal, and about 100 of these massive ships a day, you know, move through this</p>
<p>canal. But it really highlights the fragility of our global supply chain, similar to kind of the</p>
<p>experience I think we had during the COVID pandemic, when all of a sudden, things like</p>
<p>toilet paper were less available to us. But you know, a small power outage on a boat,</p>
<p>on a ship, you know, in the middle of the Suez Canal can suddenly block up so much of global</p>
<p>trade and cause, you know, massive fluctuations in commodity prices and availability of supplies</p>
<p>and products for businesses around the world, there&rsquo;s going to be rippling economic effects</p>
<p>for a period of time, it&rsquo;s unclear how significant they&rsquo;re going to be.</p>
<p>But you know, I really do think that taking note of the fragility of our supply chain in</p>
<p>this particular context, is worth taking a step back. And you know, I spent a lot of my personal</p>
<p>my work time, obviously off the podcast, thinking about kind of our systems of industry. And you</p>
<p>know, the global industrial revolutions were really predicated on this notion of centralization.</p>
<p>You know, we took a lot of our production systems, and we centralize them and created</p>
<p>automated repeatable tasks. And that reduced the cost and allowed us per unit of production,</p>
<p>to basically make things much more affordably. But the problem with centralization, generally</p>
<p>speaking, and supply chains is exactly this, which is you you have a supply chain,</p>
<p>that is much more delicate. And it is much more I mean, think about the difference in power,</p>
<p>right? If the power goes out at a power plant, all the homes that are connected to it lose power,</p>
<p>versus if every home had their own power generator or solar cells, they could continue to support</p>
<p>themselves. And in a similar context, so much and this goes back to our conversation earlier</p>
<p>about globalization, so much of our global supply chain for industry has become centralized by</p>
<p>finding the lowest cost possible, but it loses all of its durability. And so the 21st century,</p>
<p>and especially leading into this infrastructure bill that we&rsquo;re going to be talking about,</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s going to be talked about for a long time now, for months to come, presents an opportunity</p>
<p>for us to think about durability in industry and durability and supply chains that I think</p>
<p>is really profound, and allows us to shift the balance of, of power, but also shift the set</p>
<p>the sources of production of all the things we consume as a species in a much more distributed</p>
<p>way. And that can be done using green technology using, you know, 3d printers using biomanufacturing,</p>
<p>you know, using solar, there&rsquo;s a lot of vertical farming, vertical, whatever, I&rsquo;ll disagree with</p>
<p>you on that one. And we&rsquo;ll talk about that separately. But I would argue like so much of</p>
<p>industry has been centralized. Because remember, when the industrial revolutions took hold,</p>
<p>the only skill set we had as a species was mechanical engineering. And in the years that</p>
<p>followed, we developed skills in chemical engineering, and ultimately in software and</p>
<p>hardware engineering. And now more recently, in biochemical engineering, where we can use</p>
<p>biological systems to make stuff. And the advent of those technology capabilities, I think really</p>
<p>gives us the opportunity today to reinvent the supply chains. And so the Suez Canal, I hope is</p>
<p>a little bit of a wake up call, and I hope leads into some of the thinking around the infrastructure</p>
<p>build proposals, where we&rsquo;re about building durability in the supply chain. And in that</p>
<p>process, by the way, creating manufacturing jobs, you know, in a more distributed way,</p>
<p>let me build on what you&rsquo;re saying. So for all of the people listening that really, really care</p>
<p>about electrification and electric cars, and there&rsquo;s a bunch of Tesla bulls here, you know,</p>
<p>Tesla uses a specific kind of battery called NCA. And there&rsquo;s, you know, other forms of batteries,</p>
<p>but for the most part, and Tesla in China uses this LFP chemistry. But the point is, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of very, very valuable nickel that goes into making lithium ion batteries. And so if you believe</p>
<p>in electrification, and you believe in, you know, zero emissions, and you believe in using these</p>
<p>batteries, you need to believe in nickel, which is a tough business, okay, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re grabbing,</p>
<p>you know, rock out of the ground, and you&rsquo;re leaching this, this extremely important metal</p>
<p>out of it. So just a little while ago, there is a huge nickel manufacturer called Norlisk Nickel,</p>
<p>right. And they have these two Russian nickel mines. And just very recently, they flooded,</p>
<p>and the plug which had been erected for localizing the flooding was washed away,</p>
<p>not for the first time, not for the second time, but for the third time. And people now think that</p>
<p>getting all this water out of the mine may take at least a year. Okay. So what, why should we care?</p>
<p>Well, right now, if you think about all the batteries that were forecasted to make in order</p>
<p>to sort of eliminate climate change, and, you know, do all these good things and for, you know, Tesla</p>
<p>to make their, you know, beautiful cars or whomever that, you know, they need nickel.</p>
<p>And right now we have we have a deficit of nickel that&rsquo;s going to emerge now in less than a year.</p>
<p>And we have, we have about a 37 to 40% shortage of what we need. So it&rsquo;s like you have all these</p>
<p>grandiose visions of how the world should work. And an electric failure in a barge shuts down</p>
<p>the global supply chain for weeks, a flood in a nickel mine is going to cause the price of a</p>
<p>Tesla to basically double. And shouldn&rsquo;t people at some point, ask ourselves, is this really what</p>
<p>efficiency is supposed to feel like on the ground? And it may not be right. And so maybe again,</p>
<p>going back to the first conversation, a little bit more inefficiency, a little bit more inflation,</p>
<p>a little bit more redundancy will allow us to be resilient. And maybe that&rsquo;s what we really want.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you could ask the people in Texas what they want after they lost their power,</p>
<p>and they have one light snowstorm and the whole city is destroyed. I mean, there really is.</p>
<p>There is something to having the redundancy in your home and the supply chain and obviously drugs,</p>
<p>which we witnessed during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Right, right. I mean, we infrastructure, we were so we were so concerned about</p>
<p>short term profit maximization that we offshored our entire pharmaceutical production,</p>
<p>and PPE manufacturing to China, which then said that they might ration it to us based on,</p>
<p>you know, geopolitical concerns. No, thanks. So yeah, that that is that is that is penny wise</p>
<p>and pound foolish. The absolute definition is the is the infrastructure bill going to fix it</p>
<p>freeberg you have a rundown of the infrastructure bill, you know, there isn&rsquo;t a good, there isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a good clarity on this, my concern is that there&rsquo;s going to be lots of push for things like</p>
<p>roads and, you know, stuff that doesn&rsquo;t create ongoing jobs that so much money is going to go</p>
<p>into basically a disguised stimulus package, versus, you know, the ideal kind of infrastructure</p>
<p>program set is to enable industry. So if you go back and you think about like the Manhattan project</p>
<p>and the Apollo mission, you know, those were very expensive government programs that have a very</p>
<p>specific mandate. But because there were big investments and difficult problems, they unlocked</p>
<p>a lot of industry that followed that initial development cycle. And I think that that is kind</p>
<p>of a good guideline for us to think about with respect to what we might hope for an infrastructure</p>
<p>bill to do, which is to create unlock for industry, as opposed to plowing money into short term</p>
<p>service contracts with a bunch of guys who are going to make a ton of money building roads,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t really change the industry very much. And so I&rsquo;m concerned, it&rsquo;s going to be a</p>
<p>giveaway of money that&rsquo;s going to create a short term stimulus, but doesn&rsquo;t really create long</p>
<p>term effects in the industry. But we&rsquo;ll see what kind of comes out as they get more clarity on</p>
<p>this. There&rsquo;s certainly a big push for quote, unquote, green, but I&rsquo;m not sure the people that</p>
<p>are quote, unquote, green advisors in this in this context, are going to be thinking about this,</p>
<p>you know, this next century of opportunity, you know, yeah, so so we&rsquo;ll see,</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s gonna have to have a real come to Jesus if they actually really give a shit about climate</p>
<p>change. Yeah, I&rsquo;ll give you an I&rsquo;ll give you a different example, like, again, to really</p>
<p>electrify, you have to pull metals out of the ground. That is a dirty business, okay. And there</p>
<p>are impacts to the environment, even if you&rsquo;re the best at it. And right now in the Western</p>
<p>Hemisphere, it takes 20 years to green light a mine 20 years, our shortages start in the next</p>
<p>year. In China, they have, you know, no issues whatsoever, right? Let&rsquo;s just say so maybe it</p>
<p>takes them seven to 10 years to get a to get a project greenlit. Now, I&rsquo;m not advocating that</p>
<p>we become China. But I think that it&rsquo;s really important for us to realize that like, you know,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re going to really take this seriously, you can&rsquo;t have progress being hijacked by things that</p>
<p>may not matter as much in the grand scheme of things like there is the opportunity, for example,</p>
<p>to build a massive set of copper and nickel mines in the Western Hemisphere. But the minute that</p>
<p>they get greenlit, they get there&rsquo;s an injunction that&rsquo;s filed by an NGO that&rsquo;ll say, Oh, you know,</p>
<p>we have to think about the land grouse. And it&rsquo;s like, what the fuck is the land grouse?</p>
<p>And at some point, you have to figure out whether you actually want your kids to have asthma or not.</p>
<p>And whether they can suck up, you know, p.m. to five and p.m. 10 for the rest of their lives,</p>
<p>or you care more about the land grass. And this is going to come, come to a head. And hopefully,</p>
<p>the infrastructure bill paves the way for these decisions. Because I think as a country, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to decide because many other countries in order to have clean air and drinkable</p>
<p>water are going to basically prioritize humans over the land grass. Yeah, I mean, it reminds me</p>
<p>of the nuclear discussion we had earlier in this podcast of like, we can&rsquo;t even put a new nuclear</p>
<p>power plant in this country without it taking decades. And any, any, any interesting updates</p>
<p>on the business side? I saw is Microsoft really about to buy discord for $10 billion?</p>
<p>Yeah, if you look at that compared to, you know, the slack acquisition is slack up what for 28</p>
<p>billion with was it 800 million in revenue, yearly revenue at the time. And discord has 150 million,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to pretend it&rsquo;s unbelievable. It&rsquo;s an even higher multiple.</p>
<p>For 1.2 billion at this point.</p>
<p>Well, it was it was in hindsight, it was probably cheap.</p>
<p>It made the market.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, back in 2012, we really thought back in 2012, that one to 2 billion was like,</p>
<p>the best case scenario of yeah, the upper bound of what a SAS exit would look like.</p>
<p>We just never realized how big the market could get. And now obviously, you have slack at close</p>
<p>to 30 billion, you have DocuSign IPO at 40 billion, you have zoom at over 100 billion.</p>
<p>And so the markets just ended up so much bigger than we ever thought. And we were the optimists,</p>
<p>we were the ones building companies in SAS back then. And so the cloud has just been so I mean,</p>
<p>and you see this now with you know, the numbers that Azure and Google Cloud, and AWS keep</p>
<p>reporting where they&rsquo;re at, like 10s of billions of revenue, and they&rsquo;re still growing like 40 50%</p>
<p>a year. So the cloud is just so much bigger than what we all thought and what came before.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean. So I&rsquo;ve just decided to stop trying to find</p>
<p>new ideas and just, I mean, new, like a new thesis, and just keep investing in this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m kind of all in on, on SAS right now.</p>
<p>Do you think Microsoft is doing this to compete with slack, or they&rsquo;re doing it to just</p>
<p>really take over gaming? You have any insights?</p>
<p>I think probably it&rsquo;s probably an element of both where they do like one of their few</p>
<p>consumer business lines that&rsquo;s done really well as Xbox and gaming, and they bought Minecraft. And so</p>
<p>I think they can get some value out of it there. But I have to believe that this is competitively</p>
<p>driven. They got to be worried about slack. I mean, the crown jewel at Microsoft is the</p>
<p>office suite. The reason they bought Yammer is to accelerate the transition of office into cloud,</p>
<p>social and mobile. And it did help do that. And they got to be worried about Salesforce now</p>
<p>buying slack. I mean, that is Benioff has been</p>
<p>wanting to go after office for a long time. And this is his way to do it.</p>
<p>Yeah. All right. There you have it, folks. Another all in podcast is in the can.</p>
<p>Let me just ask a question. Are people making summer plans and fall plans based on</p>
<p>the I&rsquo;m making I&rsquo;m making I&rsquo;m making tonight plans. I can&rsquo;t wait to get you</p>
<p>victims into the poker room. I want you to fly in. Come on, come and play. We need a full</p>
<p>bestie victim. Well, what&rsquo;s your plan tonight? Like, are you going to some fancy like</p>
<p>pasta restaurant with your wife? Are you doing pop and bottles with?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. Who are you hanging out with tonight? What are you doing?</p>
<p>Yeah. What are you doing with the kids? It&rsquo;s Friday night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to ask again. Do you know their names?</p>
<p>Put them to bed. Fly up north days. Come to the poker game.</p>
<p>Tell us your kids middle names.</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>I went to the movies last night. I was I took my 11 year old out. She was she was</p>
<p>she wanted to get a Shake Shack. So I took her to Shake Shack. And the movie theater was there</p>
<p>and it was open. And I was like, Oh, let&rsquo;s go check it out of what&rsquo;s going on at the movie theater.</p>
<p>And Terminator two was playing 15 minutes later. Great film.</p>
<p>Incredible film holds up and amazing to see on the big screen. We walk in I kid you not,</p>
<p>you know, 100 seat theater with these beautiful big chairs, nobody there. And they were so excited.</p>
<p>Did you rent the whole thing?</p>
<p>No, it just happens to be that they&rsquo;re open for business. They space people out.</p>
<p>And it was $5 a ticket to see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking my I&rsquo;m taking my daughters to the movies this afternoon. First time they&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>been to the movies. They&rsquo;re, you know, three and a half and two. I am so excited to take them to a</p>
<p>movie theater. So we rented the whole theater for $99. It&rsquo;s the best deal in town.</p>
<p>What, what movie are you seeing?</p>
<p>Trolls, you can choose a movie. That&rsquo;s the cool thing. There&rsquo;s like a list of like 50</p>
<p>films and you can pick a film. So I got like a little kid&rsquo;s film for them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re get to go see a movie theater and have popcorn have the experience.</p>
<p>And you can have other friends there.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can have up to 20 people. So you rent the whole theater for 99 bucks. And you</p>
<p>you can kind of if you want to come see Trolls, come on, just cruise up. I&rsquo;ll send you a ticket.</p>
<p>Oh my god, that&rsquo;s the coolest fucking thing.</p>
<p>Godzilla vs. Kong is happening. And I&rsquo;m renting a theater for it. So if everybody wants to bring</p>
<p>their kids, it&rsquo;s a great series.</p>
<p>My kids would never sleep after seeing that.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s not for three to five year olds. But you know, 10 year olds. Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 100 bucks. This is an AMC theater.</p>
<p>99 bucks. It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>For AMC. But the the Sinopolis I think charges 200. And that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>like really high end theater where you can press a button and the waiter comes.</p>
<p>And the waiter was like, thanks for coming. We really appreciate it. Like you&rsquo;re one of</p>
<p>the first guests.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>There is no way.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was kind of like an emotional moment for me to take my daughter again,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what we would do every Friday.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, school.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way movie theaters go out of business. I mean, they&rsquo;re just it&rsquo;s such like,</p>
<p>like a traditional experience. It&rsquo;s so American.</p>
<p>I wonder what AMC is trading at. Hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wonder if AMC would be an interest.</p>
<p>I, uh, I, I just, I&rsquo;m just saying this conversation out. He&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I got my movie theater downstairs. The usher is on standby. Ready to let me in.</p>
<p>How many seats are you? Sax is like, oh, you can only rent a 20 seat theater. I have a 40</p>
<p>seat theater.</p>
<p>Sax, how many theaters are, do you have built in your various homes?</p>
<p>Do you only have one theater per home, Sax? Is it one theater per home?</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s got a multiplex in each. In case people want to watch different movies.</p>
<p>They meet at the popcorn stand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m excited to go back to the movies.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be able to do that soon.</p>
<p>I love going to the movies. I love it.</p>
<p>How excited are you guys to go to Disneyland? I want to take my kids to Disneyland.</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Sax and I, when we first moved.</p>
<p>COVID is over. I&rsquo;m so sick. By the way, how right, how right were we?</p>
<p>I think it was like two or three pods ago. We were saying that COVID would be over by Memorial</p>
<p>Day.</p>
<p>Memorial Day.</p>
<p>And even in California, Gavin Newsom basically has finally capitulated to logic and everybody</p>
<p>can get a shot now as of April 15th.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which means by May 15th, everybody who wants to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>All it took was a recall. 2.2 million signatures.</p>
<p>It took the recall and shame and shaming him and berating him on Twitter constantly.</p>
<p>I mean, Peter Pham was tweeting out like every day, the growing inventories of vaccine and all</p>
<p>the open appointments we all were. And it&rsquo;s like ridiculous. We kept mentioning him.</p>
<p>5 million shots on shelves in a pandemic. I mean, you don&rsquo;t need to be Freeberg to understand</p>
<p>how vaccines work. Each person&rsquo;s a blocker, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. And the other thing, the other thing that got Newsom to move was that Biden gave that press</p>
<p>conference in which he moved up the date. And so then that prompted Newsom to move up his date.</p>
<p>And the same thing happened like a month ago when Biden gave that speech where he said he gave that</p>
<p>May 1st date as a date everyone should get vaccinated. So frankly, it&rsquo;d be nice if we had</p>
<p>a governor who would just do the right thing without the constant threat of recall and tweet</p>
<p>shaming and the president dragging him into the future.</p>
<p>But but I guess we do with all I&rsquo;m curious what you guys think of what we should do with all this</p>
<p>extra supply. I had an interesting idea for the economy. If you come to America, and you&rsquo;ve tested</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have COVID, right, you take a test on the forget there. If you come to America,</p>
<p>we will give you the vaccine at the airport. Jason, I think here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna do from</p>
<p>now on. Great with that. You&rsquo;re gonna have you&rsquo;re gonna have three little chips a week and you get</p>
<p>to put a chip in a jar and then you can suggest one of your ideas. But then once you hit three,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re done. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Vaccine tourism. No, we like formalized vaccine tours. If you</p>
<p>come to America for vacation, complimentary vaccines on the way in. I mean, we&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>at the point where everyone&rsquo;s. Look, I mean, look, effectively affected. No, I think effectively,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have that it won&rsquo;t be at the airport. But I mean, the all the restrictions</p>
<p>are coming off in every state by mid April now. And people can&rsquo;t afford an international plane</p>
<p>ticket. You know, they&rsquo;re not like going to come to the US to get a shot. I would like to advocate</p>
<p>that we take these extra vaccines and we ship them to the developing world. Yeah, they should</p>
<p>go south of the border for sure. For sure. Yeah. And by the way, we&rsquo;re doing a much better job</p>
<p>vaccinating people than Europe. I mean, it&rsquo;s unbelievable that COVID is spiking in Europe</p>
<p>right now because they&rsquo;ve been so incompetent at getting people vaccinated. Well, their issue was</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t order in shockingly incompetent, shocking Canadians and the Europeans said we</p>
<p>want you to prove to us the vaccine works before we put our order in. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that Jason,</p>
<p>I think I think Jason like I think that like sometimes I think over the last 40 years,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been two polar opposites of governing people. One is what I would call the autocrat.</p>
<p>And the other is what I would call kindergarten soccer, where when the ball no matter where the</p>
<p>ball is on the on the soccer field, every player on every team is surrounded. Yes. And so as a</p>
<p>result, no progress is here. Progress is bursty and unpredictable and sometimes not great, but it</p>
<p>can happen. And this is where like, you know, so like, I mean, we are I&rsquo;m still shocked at the lack</p>
<p>of scientific rigor and understanding by these people. And so how could you have an entire</p>
<p>Western set of countries who are theoretically not stupid, be in this situation in April of 2021</p>
<p>knowing what we know? Yeah, well, how&rsquo;s how&rsquo;s Brexit? How&rsquo;s Brexit looking now? Because God,</p>
<p>because Britain is like, is almost fully vaccinated, their COVID numbers are coming</p>
<p>way down. And then the British variant, the British variant, it started in the UK</p>
<p>is spreading like wildfire across Europe, because they&rsquo;re too bureaucratic to get</p>
<p>everyone vaccinated. So I mean, Britain is looking really good by comparison right now.</p>
<p>They opted out of kindergarten soccer.</p>
<p>Yeah. And by the way, this is just to tie back to the infrastructure for a second,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with infrastructure if the investments can be spent wisely,</p>
<p>but how much of us trust the government to spend the money wisely as opposed to on</p>
<p>pork barrel spending and wasteful projects and taking too long. We have the Bay Bridge in San</p>
<p>Francisco, the original Bay Bridge took two years to build. And then the the repair of it took 17</p>
<p>years, where they did like the the upgraded version. And that&rsquo;s the problem we have is that</p>
<p>nobody really trusts our government anymore to allocate this money wisely.</p>
<p>Just to give people an idea, doses administered per 100 people 39. Well, now 40 for the US and</p>
<p>Israel 114. Obviously, there&rsquo;s two dose shots, and Spain 14, Italy 14, Canada 12. Mexico for</p>
<p>my mom, who&rsquo;s almost at just got her first shot, which I think is inexcusable. Justin Trudeau,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re listening, disaster, I just I just think that&rsquo;s unacceptable, unacceptable. She&rsquo;s 79 years</p>
<p>old. It&rsquo;s unacceptable. God, I mean, it literally is politicians, these politicians and bureaucrats</p>
<p>design this complicated system to prove that they&rsquo;re helping people. It&rsquo;s just like news.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just all they do is get in the way equity. That&rsquo;s the way the red the red light should go</p>
<p>off and you should run far away from whatever comes after we&rsquo;re going to solve an equity problem.</p>
<p>We see let&rsquo;s go for efficiency. Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s go. Yeah. All right, everybody. We&rsquo;ll see you all</p>
<p>next time on the all in podcast. Love you guys. Love you best. See you tonight. See you tonight,</p>
<p>except bring us some of that. Bring us some of that sacks crafty poo money. Come on. Yeah,</p>
<p>buy in. Come on. We will play PLL. We&rsquo;ll keep it to hold them. Yeah, we know if you fly up,</p>
<p>if you fly up for the evening, you&rsquo;re going to be just fully committed. You know, you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be playing right. Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ll come in tilted because I&rsquo;ll be negative.</p>
<p>Jet fuel. Yes.</p>
<p>Just go for a coin toss. How about if we cover it? We&rsquo;ll just do a flip and we&rsquo;ll cover it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll cover your jet fuels. Boy, that&rsquo;s not a no. I didn&rsquo;t hear.</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s low. Someone&rsquo;s in text and tell her to kick him out of the house tonight.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you. Besties are</p>
<p>my adventure. We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>just like this, like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Going all in.</p>
