<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>hi guys welcome back it is Friday</p>
<p>morning and we have Roxanna to help us</p>
<p>out with these questions</p>
<p>and I always like to just kind of give</p>
<p>you a disclaimer so every anything that</p>
<p>I say is not meant to diagnose or cure</p>
<p>any of your medical diseases okay this</p>
<p>is just a minute for you to do research</p>
<p>and come up with your own conclusions I</p>
<p>mean that being said Roxana</p>
<p>let me now tell you the cure for cancer</p>
<p>no I&rsquo;m just kidding I mean it&rsquo;s quite</p>
<p>amazing like that even on the back of</p>
<p>all the supplement bottles that anyone</p>
<p>has to put out you have to legally put</p>
<p>this statement these statements have not</p>
<p>been evaluated by the FDA this product</p>
<p>is not intended to pretty much do</p>
<p>anything can&rsquo;t do anything can&rsquo;t cure</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t prevent can&rsquo;t do anything so you</p>
<p>just have to put that out there and I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s this a whole monopoly over</p>
<p>the body by the medical profession so</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on so so we</p>
<p>have a lot of callers already been on on</p>
<p>for 60 minutes so we&rsquo;re gonna go right</p>
<p>to Ruth in Texas with you to question go</p>
<p>ahead good morning dr. Byrd first I</p>
<p>wanted to thank you for the information</p>
<p>you gave me last time on the digestate</p>
<p>and the gallbladder formula I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>taking just the two with protein in my</p>
<p>meal and then one gallbladder afterwards</p>
<p>after the meal and I felt much better</p>
<p>awesome a follow-up question on that on</p>
<p>the gallbladder formula do you take it</p>
<p>immediately after the mill or about a</p>
<p>half hour because isn&rsquo;t the bile</p>
<p>released in the small intestine yeah</p>
<p>yeah and so here&rsquo;s kind of the thought</p>
<p>on that yeah it&rsquo;s I would take it</p>
<p>immediately right after you eat it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna try to trace the food and back the</p>
<p>food is so it&rsquo;s not gonna be before but</p>
<p>the whole thought is if you take the</p>
<p>gall bladder formula with the bile which</p>
<p>is alkaline before the food you know</p>
<p>could kind of neutralize some of the</p>
<p>acid and you can end up with like less</p>
<p>stomach acid so my whole thought just</p>
<p>let the stomach do its job initially</p>
<p>with the food followed up with</p>
<p>with the bile it just seems to work</p>
<p>better because you&rsquo;re right the bile is</p>
<p>gonna be excreted from the gallbladder</p>
<p>into the small intestine it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to be in the stomach so we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily want to interfere with the</p>
<p>stomach acid as much as to certain</p>
<p>degree but here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>I also added in betaine hydrochloride to</p>
<p>that formula to counter some yeah yeah</p>
<p>so we have an acidifying effect so it</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be too bad but if it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>only thing is if on a rare occasion if</p>
<p>someone does not have enough stomach</p>
<p>acid and they take the gallbladder and</p>
<p>then take and without the digest plus</p>
<p>then it takes that little bit of ass</p>
<p>that they have and they might actually</p>
<p>feel a little worse so in which case</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s simple effects just add more</p>
<p>stomach acid outside of vinegar BAM</p>
<p>problem solved okay so my question today</p>
<p>was about the adrenal fatigue and the</p>
<p>adrenal and cortisol relief I tried</p>
<p>taking the adrenal and cortisol release</p>
<p>and it really brought me down too much</p>
<p>so then I started tracking the adrenal</p>
<p>fatigue and it picks me up so I take one</p>
<p>in the morning with three of the seek</p>
<p>help and two of the b5 but I&rsquo;m wondering</p>
<p>at what point would I change over to the</p>
<p>adrenal support well I know doing the</p>
<p>adrenal there&rsquo;s two products that have</p>
<p>adrenal fatigue formulas advanced</p>
<p>formula it&rsquo;s like really strong it&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>people that need more help and you</p>
<p>obviously you&rsquo;re responding good to it</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what you need right now</p>
<p>the adrenal in cortisol relief is more</p>
<p>for actually it&rsquo;s for people that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a really big problem with adrenals</p>
<p>maybe they need to maintain it it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>minor problem which honestly is the</p>
<p>majority of population they will do very</p>
<p>well on the regular adrenal program but</p>
<p>not the the advanced formula that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mainly for people that have some chronic</p>
<p>stress inflammatory conditions but</p>
<p>apparently that&rsquo;s what seems to work on</p>
<p>you so I would stick with that right now</p>
<p>and then as you improve</p>
<p>then add the adrenal course cell relief</p>
<p>later that&rsquo;s what I was doing so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the same formula then they&rsquo;re just one</p>
<p>stronger than the other now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>completely different formulas okay okay</p>
<p>I was gonna say the cortisol relief it</p>
<p>actually made me tired and sleepy and</p>
<p>not wanting to get out of bed but the</p>
<p>adrenal fatigue it perks me up makes me</p>
<p>feel good and then when I added the</p>
<p>pantothenic acid I felt even better the</p>
<p>only thing is I get a little bit of</p>
<p>heaviness in my chest but I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the pantothenic acid that&rsquo;s doing that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the last one that I had</p>
<p>that I added I&rsquo;m just gonna cut back on</p>
<p>that or maybe even eliminate it now that</p>
<p>the adrenal fatigue really seems to be</p>
<p>helping yeah and yeah it works good so</p>
<p>the thing that we have to realize</p>
<p>sometimes too is when you start working</p>
<p>with the adrenals some of these</p>
<p>nutrients can really try out the Drina</p>
<p>to the point where you feel tired which</p>
<p>really is your journals finally going</p>
<p>thank you I could finally chill out</p>
<p>after the flight of fight mechanism</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna take a person out of</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just know it all of a sudden</p>
<p>feel like you want to take a nap so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s problem yeah</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s working but it&rsquo;s working too</p>
<p>fast so you just ease off take a little</p>
<p>less take it before bed boom you&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>interesting okay yeah same thing with</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>anything with the massage tool when you</p>
<p>start applying this it&rsquo;ll just put</p>
<p>someone into a sleep and they think oh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m detoxing no you&rsquo;re actually going to</p>
<p>sleep we&rsquo;re pulling stress out</p>
<p>especially if you had flight-or-fight</p>
<p>all right Ruth thanks for your call</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go to Deborah and</p>
<p>Connecticut you&rsquo;ve been waiting for just</p>
<p>under an hour go ahead Deb hi thank you</p>
<p>for taking my call sure I wrote looked</p>
<p>at one of your videos regarding sinus</p>
<p>infections and things like that</p>
<p>my son&rsquo;s about seven and he always</p>
<p>sounds like he has a blocked nose even</p>
<p>though he did that not have a cold and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put him on a regional oil some</p>
<p>drops new water because he won&rsquo;t take a</p>
<p>pill but I&rsquo;ve been doing it now for</p>
<p>awhile and I just don&rsquo;t see any</p>
<p>different yeah for the men good and then</p>
<p>my other question if you have time is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>program and I haven&rsquo;t lost any weight</p>
<p>for about a month and I haven&rsquo;t lost any</p>
<p>inches but my belly is starting to</p>
<p>increase again and I&rsquo;m like what is</p>
<p>going on okay so let&rsquo;s talk about your</p>
<p>son first is yours is your son eating</p>
<p>healthily is he doing no he loves pasta</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t get him off of it yeah I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried noodles and all that only thing</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll eat the string being and I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get him off the pasta I find gluten-free</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s about it</p>
<p>yeah the proper thing I would recommend</p>
<p>is your next child start them off early</p>
<p>no no no what I think what you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have to do is you&rsquo;re gonna have to just</p>
<p>continue to enlighten and educate and</p>
<p>even try to get them to watch a video</p>
<p>because unless he decides you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t force them this is not</p>
<p>going to be good but it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>something in the diet that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>creating mucus and stuffing up his nose</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another thing I mean and the</p>
<p>problem with kids too is sometimes they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to take supplements so comes</p>
<p>because like some of the other remedies</p>
<p>would be Spanish black radish really</p>
<p>works good you can get in a tablet it</p>
<p>clears up the sinuses liquid stinging</p>
<p>nettle root also works good but</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s in a capsule there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of remedies for that but that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re up against probably gonna</p>
<p>maybe eliminating dairy might help now</p>
<p>as far as you let&rsquo;s just really quickly</p>
<p>give me a summary of what are you doing</p>
<p>in a minute fasting I&rsquo;m doing innovative</p>
<p>fasting I am not exercising</p>
<p>okay eating one and a half meals a day</p>
<p>okay what are you eating the protocol</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating hi kale I&rsquo;m doing my high-fat</p>
<p>with my moderate protein okay so here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would do I would not go not add a</p>
<p>lot more fat to diet and just kind of</p>
<p>make sure that your fats is coming</p>
<p>within the protein itself don&rsquo;t add</p>
<p>extra fat because sometimes that can you</p>
<p>might be in ketosis but you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>burning that extra fat and that&rsquo;s why I</p>
<p>just released a video on ketosis won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily cause you to lose weight</p>
<p>depending on how much fat you have in</p>
<p>the diet so you might want to reduce</p>
<p>that so you forces your body</p>
<p>use your own fat that&rsquo;s one thing the</p>
<p>other thing I want you to try I think</p>
<p>that extra stomach thing is more of a</p>
<p>bloating from the cow I want you to not</p>
<p>do the kale and try other types of</p>
<p>vegetables romaine lettuce</p>
<p>let us leave and see if that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just help you because that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>little thing with that care for some</p>
<p>people they they tend to blow with that</p>
<p>okay great thank you you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>all right we&rsquo;re going to Roxanna Roxanna</p>
<p>do we have any questions on social media</p>
<p>any anything yes we do okay first let me</p>
<p>just all the countries that are out</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>Denmark United Kingdom Ireland Romania</p>
<p>we have people from course the United</p>
<p>States California Philadelphia</p>
<p>Cincinnati we have been from Scotland</p>
<p>just like all over the place they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>at the same time zone that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>yeah so we have a novice Kovas from</p>
<p>YouTube sorry if I said that wrong</p>
<p>probiotics supplements effective in</p>
<p>weight loss okay the prebiotics would be</p>
<p>more alike the fiber and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little there&rsquo;s like for example</p>
<p>asparagus has a great prebiotic and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be food or the microbes</p>
<p>now will it help weight loss it may or</p>
<p>may not depending on excuse me depending</p>
<p>on if you if you&rsquo;re lacking or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lacking in those fibers or food for the</p>
<p>microbes so I think he can contribute</p>
<p>but some people have an overabundance of</p>
<p>friendly bacteria or are just bacteria</p>
<p>in general in their gut and with those</p>
<p>people it&rsquo;s usually a problem with some</p>
<p>unfriendly it&rsquo;s not all friendly so</p>
<p>adding more prebiotics is not</p>
<p>necessarily like the thing that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to help you lose weight but the key is</p>
<p>again reducing the carbohydrates that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most important thing and keeping</p>
<p>your vegetables very high but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not used to consuming vegetables you</p>
<p>might have to ease up into it</p>
<p>because it could overload your your gut</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have you might not</p>
<p>have they&rsquo;re not used to consuming that</p>
<p>much fiber so that could actually bind</p>
<p>you up and make you feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gaining weight when in fact you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just bloated all right from</p>
<p>YouTube we have Chris maverick he says</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a good food to break a fast that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been up for one to two days well</p>
<p>the best way to break the fast is the</p>
<p>food that is the highest nutrients</p>
<p>because think about it if you&rsquo;re any</p>
<p>first meal of the day or of the week</p>
<p>your cells are gonna be like super open</p>
<p>to receiving that like a like a rocket</p>
<p>ship so just make sure that that meal is</p>
<p>not low quality it&rsquo;s some seriously high</p>
<p>in nutrients in there I would take your</p>
<p>supplements first then boom eat and then</p>
<p>I recommend the vegetables first then</p>
<p>the protein and then the fat did you</p>
<p>like that answer</p>
<p>yep okay good good you have another</p>
<p>question yep</p>
<p>Judy Rowland is asking what you think</p>
<p>about ox bile yeah ox bile it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>I use it in my gall bladder formula</p>
<p>purify bile salts while faults bile</p>
<p>salts really help to prevent stones and</p>
<p>they help you extract bad type of</p>
<p>vitamins from the fats that you are</p>
<p>eating and a lot of people either they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a gall bladder or they have a</p>
<p>sluggish gall bladder and they that will</p>
<p>help them but make sure you consume that</p>
<p>after the meal not before because it</p>
<p>could neutralize your stomach and then</p>
<p>another thing that&rsquo;s really missing is</p>
<p>the the acidifier it&rsquo;s in my digest</p>
<p>formula which acidifies a stomach and</p>
<p>then just by that alone that will</p>
<p>increase your production of bile without</p>
<p>even taking bile so it&rsquo;s a kind of a</p>
<p>omitted thing with a lot of people okay</p>
<p>so now Roxanna I have one we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>ask the first question right off the bat</p>
<p>okay so in social media let&rsquo;s this is a</p>
<p>true or false question guys it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be really easy for you true or false</p>
<p>insulin is used by snail certain types</p>
<p>of snails to cause the prey to be</p>
<p>subdued and taken over like it makes the</p>
<p>slightly unconscious is that true or</p>
<p>false okay do snails use insulin to use</p>
<p>it as a defense mechanism for their prey</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s kind of a common question</p>
<p>that people ask a lot but I just want to</p>
<p>see if they can get this true or false</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll come back to that answer</p>
<p>alright so we&rsquo;re gonna go right to Brian</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Nebraska you had a question</p>
<p>go ahead hi doctor um yes I have several</p>
<p>conditions I have diabetes and epilepsy</p>
<p>both of which the ketogenic diet is</p>
<p>supposed to help I also have pituitary</p>
<p>ism I have a insufficiency and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking all the steroids that your body</p>
<p>would make I&rsquo;m taking testosterone and</p>
<p>so mainly my cholesterol last time was</p>
<p>that the doctor is 300 so I&rsquo;m wondering</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s safe to do the diet and with all</p>
<p>those conditions you know what would you</p>
<p>recommend okay good</p>
<p>other than that Brian how you doing yeah</p>
<p>okay good so um all right here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing right this there&rsquo;s a great movie</p>
<p>you need to watch you can get it it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>YouTube it&rsquo;s actually for free first do</p>
<p>no harm</p>
<p>okay watch that movie it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>because it covers true story about this</p>
<p>little child who had epilepsy and did</p>
<p>the Kido so it&rsquo;s a really good movie to</p>
<p>watch so check that out but the only</p>
<p>diet that is that you need to focus on</p>
<p>right now is the keto within a minute</p>
<p>fasting it is the exact thing that is</p>
<p>going to help you so much so you can</p>
<p>kill two birds with one stone</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna definitely help support</p>
<p>neurogenesis in the brain help your</p>
<p>brain work better and it&rsquo;s been an a</p>
<p>proven beneficial thing for people with</p>
<p>seizures epilepsy</p>
<p>and diabetes so your cholesterol is high</p>
<p>will I know because you&rsquo;re obviously</p>
<p>your your insulin is probably sky-high</p>
<p>and I would get an insulin fasting test</p>
<p>but if you did this program and you kept</p>
<p>your carbs low and you did it exactly</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m telling people I would</p>
<p>definitely get the books and you get the</p>
<p>full picture of this because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to just randomly try different</p>
<p>things understanding to do it and then</p>
<p>implement it with the fat you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>find that your cholesterol will come</p>
<p>down because you don&rsquo;t have the carbs</p>
<p>really important go for health first so</p>
<p>you want to do a lot of vegetables a lot</p>
<p>of healthy quality fats and and</p>
<p>implement the intimate of fasting I</p>
<p>would I would expect to see great</p>
<p>results within a few days and even a few</p>
<p>weeks with doing this now the fact that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the steroids it&rsquo;s a situation</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t necessarily want to come</p>
<p>off anything</p>
<p>but start implementing this thing as</p>
<p>your body heals get with your doctor to</p>
<p>reduce the amount of these steroids the</p>
<p>steroids they&rsquo;re probably the thing that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m most concerned about because they</p>
<p>have such big side-effects and your body</p>
<p>becomes dependent and it affects the</p>
<p>adrenal so I think your entire endocrine</p>
<p>system will be very happy and thank you</p>
<p>if you do this and then one last saying</p>
<p>colostrum there you can get it from the</p>
<p>health of store get a high-quality one a</p>
<p>powder start taking very small amounts</p>
<p>of it before you go to bed in some water</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really good to repair the</p>
<p>damage from steroids alright thanks</p>
<p>Bryan okay Devin you&rsquo;re from Wisconsin</p>
<p>you had a question yeah hi dr. Berg um</p>
<p>first of all I just want to say I just</p>
<p>appreciate you know every all the videos</p>
<p>and all the knowledge you put out there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s really cool to go on</p>
<p>YouTube and see that sort of thing okay</p>
<p>so I have a few questions a couple short</p>
<p>ones and then a little bit of a longer</p>
<p>one so I I&rsquo;m 19 years old I have a</p>
<p>slightly high cholesterol already and I</p>
<p>was wondering about eggs I know that you</p>
<p>have in your videos like eggs they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know as far as cholesterol goes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two fine but I was wondering is</p>
<p>someone who has high cholesterol already</p>
<p>would they</p>
<p>be good or bad that&rsquo;s one and then as</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s trying to burn fat and</p>
<p>build muscle would a protein shake a</p>
<p>high quality protein shake grass-fed</p>
<p>whey isolate after a workout kind of</p>
<p>defeat the purpose of burning fat or you</p>
<p>know how would that work out</p>
<p>and also I I just I kind of I know like</p>
<p>the like the foods you know that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>supposed to be eating I kind of have a</p>
<p>general understanding of like the good</p>
<p>stuff to be eating but as far as like</p>
<p>timing those like I I&rsquo;m not really that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one thing that I kind of lag</p>
<p>in so pretty much like how my day goes I</p>
<p>wake up around 10:00 have some coffee to</p>
<p>wake up then I go without eating</p>
<p>anything I go work out pretty intensely</p>
<p>and then after I had my first meal</p>
<p>around 1 o&rsquo;clock so I work out for about</p>
<p>an hour then a half hour to an hour I</p>
<p>had my first meal most of the time I</p>
<p>have a protein shake before that high</p>
<p>fats usually bacon eggs and then second</p>
<p>meal is normally between 7 to 8 and then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it only two meals so I was</p>
<p>wondering if there&rsquo;s anything I can do</p>
<p>and Bible and the kale shake I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing that a lot I normally do that</p>
<p>towards the second meal so I do that</p>
<p>after my second meal so yeah I was just</p>
<p>kind of wondering you know if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anything I can do within that kind of</p>
<p>routine to maybe make this whole</p>
<p>approach you know more effective okay so</p>
<p>question I have for you are your chore</p>
<p>glycerides high or low I&rsquo;m not sure okay</p>
<p>what about trades your HDL you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not sure I just I just know that my</p>
<p>cholesterol is you know a little higher</p>
<p>than it should be and then what the most</p>
<p>important question is what part of</p>
<p>Wisconsin me from Waukesha Wisconsin</p>
<p>okay good I&rsquo;m from Brazil Kenosha</p>
<p>so write down okay and obviously in my</p>
<p>breakfast I do have cheese</p>
<p>of course that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a good that</p>
<p>kind of yeah all right so here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you do to have been the most important</p>
<p>thing that you need to realize is that</p>
<p>for you to just you know if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>high cholesterol is just to keep your</p>
<p>quantities of vegetables very high like</p>
<p>yes the kale shake but just like make a</p>
<p>big huge salad like a big one and you</p>
<p>can have that like for your dinner as</p>
<p>your first thing I always have the big</p>
<p>salad that way it kind of it does keep</p>
<p>the cholesterol flowing through the</p>
<p>liver and I think that will help you so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing I think you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>good with the the other foods I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what your second meal is but I</p>
<p>would not do that shaped protein shake</p>
<p>after workout that&rsquo;s going to kind of</p>
<p>defeat the purpose because it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>spike insulin so if you wanted a protein</p>
<p>shake go ahead and have it with the meal</p>
<p>as your protein nut as a snack I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll help you but the eggs no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to worsen your cholesterol and</p>
<p>also you have to realize there is zero</p>
<p>data that proves that even increasing</p>
<p>dietary fat will increase your</p>
<p>cholesterol or cause heart attacks and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no data that shows that having</p>
<p>high cholesterol will cause heart attack</p>
<p>so I know you people say oh yes there is</p>
<p>no there&rsquo;s not I&rsquo;m waiting for that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s study out there it&rsquo;s not out</p>
<p>there the thing is if you combine the</p>
<p>carbs so total cholesterol used to be</p>
<p>225 as normal they dropped it and</p>
<p>putting everyone on statins so I won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even worry about total cholesterol but</p>
<p>is in if your triglycerides are low and</p>
<p>your HDL is high even if you had high</p>
<p>LDL it wouldn&rsquo;t not be a problem there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a video on that so I would watch that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see so you asked that protein</p>
<p>shake I wouldn&rsquo;t do that just ride the</p>
<p>wave do the two meals a day add the</p>
<p>vegetables more and I think you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>be fine and as long as you keep your</p>
<p>cheese in there make sure it&rsquo;s organic</p>
<p>from Wisconsin I tell you one thing</p>
<p>about Wisconsin the that&rsquo;s like the best</p>
<p>water I&rsquo;ve ever had in my life I wish I</p>
<p>could like have a pipe it out and ship</p>
<p>it to Virginia but anyway thanks for</p>
<p>your call</p>
<p>and let us know how you do hey guys</p>
<p>listen below there&rsquo;s a little link on</p>
<p>keto essentials if you&rsquo;re new to keto</p>
<p>and you want a plan of action a real</p>
<p>simple little sheet it&rsquo;s a one shooter</p>
<p>and it tells you what to eat what not to</p>
<p>eat you can click the link below and get</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called keto essentials down though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real simple check it out okay all</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>Roxanna what do we got for the answers</p>
<p>true or false we have a lot of true</p>
<p>really really people think that snails</p>
<p>have yeah and they are actually so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get a drumroll</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to forget the Dream Home okay</p>
<p>so do snails produced and swim yes they</p>
<p>do</p>
<p>okay certain cone snails and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing it for quite a few years</p>
<p>insulins been around for about two</p>
<p>billion years on this planet I mean 2</p>
<p>billion years and in different</p>
<p>single-cell organisms and and even fish</p>
<p>snails clams use insulin to keep bring</p>
<p>their prey into a state where they can</p>
<p>you know take over so it kind of brings</p>
<p>it makes them really tired and sluggish</p>
<p>I mean think about if you have too much</p>
<p>insulin you can go into a coma so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely a situation so the motto is</p>
<p>that keep your insulin normal don&rsquo;t keep</p>
<p>it too high don&rsquo;t keep it too low and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat things that increase insulin</p>
<p>where else you too will become prey to</p>
<p>the problems of sluggishness mentally</p>
<p>physically yeah okay all right well</p>
<p>these guys are sharp</p>
<p>all right so Marianne Ren from Utah you</p>
<p>had a question</p>
<p>so thinking I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m not pronouncing its</p>
<p>mayor end from Utah reactive</p>
<p>hypoglycemia are you still there all</p>
<p>right we lost that call I&rsquo;m gonna just</p>
<p>gonna put her on I&rsquo;m gonna go right to</p>
<p>the next person so Christine you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Germany you had a question</p>
<p>hi hi I&rsquo;ve been on Cato for almost two</p>
<p>years good</p>
<p>taxi diabetic three months after on</p>
<p>after I was on Cato I could get off my</p>
<p>medication Wow that&rsquo;s all I don&rsquo;t weigh</p>
<p>myself but I know that I&rsquo;ve been losing</p>
<p>weight because my clothes fit me loose</p>
<p>no good however about months ago we</p>
<p>started intermittent fasting and I</p>
<p>developed stomach rash I get really cold</p>
<p>in my hands and I still have a Pucci</p>
<p>stomach go away soon okay so here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>and your stomach gotten smaller on the</p>
<p>top and made your stomach and the lower</p>
<p>part look a little bit bigger yeah okay</p>
<p>yeah alright so here let me answer the</p>
<p>questions first of all you&rsquo;re right it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they call it a key to rush I think it</p>
<p>should be called in a minute fasting</p>
<p>rash because when you do in a minute</p>
<p>fasting you put your body in that state</p>
<p>called a tapa G which is the recycling</p>
<p>of old damaged protein parts but also it</p>
<p>can clean up a lot of microbes in detox</p>
<p>eat a little bit so I think one thing</p>
<p>you can do is get some bentonite clay</p>
<p>take that when you&rsquo;re fasting to clean</p>
<p>up any excess you know immune reactions</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s creating it and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>the rash is coming from another thing is</p>
<p>to take the B vitamins because the B</p>
<p>vitamins will help nutritionally use</p>
<p>that sometimes we&rsquo;ll handle the rash but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you about it you can get</p>
<p>rashes from like viruses that can come</p>
<p>out of remission all sorts of things and</p>
<p>then that can trigger it now the cold is</p>
<p>also your body adapting and that should</p>
<p>over time clear up but it also is an</p>
<p>indication that you might need some</p>
<p>iodine so I would get some seek help and</p>
<p>that should help you but what happens as</p>
<p>you lose weight sometimes other things</p>
<p>might be accentuated like the lower part</p>
<p>of the stomach which is always the last</p>
<p>to go which will eventually go and also</p>
<p>now that looks bigger but your top of</p>
<p>your stomach looks smaller or let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>the side of your legs you&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>weight but now that little bulge of</p>
<p>extra</p>
<p>fat on your hips start it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>pronounced or you you know the weight on</p>
<p>the upper body goes away but then not in</p>
<p>the lower part so now it looks worse so</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a situation over time that</p>
<p>will get better just stick with it and</p>
<p>add exercise and but it could take</p>
<p>honestly it could take up to a year okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but just want to let you know</p>
<p>thanks for your call from Germany</p>
<p>all right Roxanna do we have any</p>
<p>questions go ahead we have Brooke Bruce</p>
<p>from Facebook and asking that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interested in hearing if someone with</p>
<p>gastric bypass has to eat more times a</p>
<p>day to get the calories in yeah with</p>
<p>gastric bypass I did a video on this the</p>
<p>stomach is now smaller and by the way</p>
<p>Roxanna when you do when you do in a</p>
<p>minute fasting your stomach will shrink</p>
<p>your stomach will shrink not to the</p>
<p>degree that a gastric bypass so when</p>
<p>that happens your body adapts to this</p>
<p>small amount of food and you do not have</p>
<p>to eat more frequently to get your</p>
<p>nutrients because your body now will</p>
<p>will retain more nutrients especially</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing an event fasting so when</p>
<p>you do gastric bypass it does honestly</p>
<p>improve insulin resistance just for the</p>
<p>fact that you&rsquo;re cutting down the amount</p>
<p>of food and the more of stimulation of</p>
<p>insulin I&rsquo;m not recommending it but if</p>
<p>you had it done you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>improvements with your blood sugars so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because of the less amount of</p>
<p>food but I would not increase the</p>
<p>frequency to get your calories I would</p>
<p>just eat what you can and then go with</p>
<p>that and make sure you the foods are</p>
<p>very concentrated nutrient dense and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to have to</p>
<p>supplement with trace minerals and maybe</p>
<p>a little bio support the gall bladder</p>
<p>formula that will help you so you can</p>
<p>start really pulling in those fats have</p>
<p>a vitamins okay is that good yep okay</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>do you have another question yes from</p>
<p>YouTube Cassandra Cox is asking</p>
<p>if intermittent fasting and keto is okay</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re pregnant well I think keto is</p>
<p>totally fine if you&rsquo;re pregnant I just I</p>
<p>would stick with three meals and not do</p>
<p>any more any more severe in a minute</p>
<p>fasting if you&rsquo;re pregnant just to make</p>
<p>sure just stick with three three meals</p>
<p>no snacks</p>
<p>and I think but keto is totally healthy</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re doing it healthily</p>
<p>like I recommend okay good</p>
<p>so I just want to bring up this one</p>
<p>thing I want to show you guys I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you ever seen one of these right</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an EMF tester what is EMF</p>
<p>electromagnetic fields I want to show</p>
<p>you something this picks up a lot of</p>
<p>like the energy coming off your cell</p>
<p>phone your computers I&rsquo;m gonna turn it</p>
<p>on and I&rsquo;m gonna do a video on this</p>
<p>around my house I just found all sorts</p>
<p>of areas that I need to like like you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to have a battery with</p>
<p>charger with your phone right by your</p>
<p>head when you&rsquo;re going to sleep at night</p>
<p>because look at this thing you can see</p>
<p>that it kind of not good right so and</p>
<p>also when you talk on your phone you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting a lot of EMS especially if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the car roxanna so if you have a cell</p>
<p>phone number one do not touch it on your</p>
<p>ear there&rsquo;s been studies that it causes</p>
<p>brain tumors so keep it away from the</p>
<p>ear or not even or put on speakerphone</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t even keep it touching your</p>
<p>body and even have one of those little</p>
<p>adapters that goes into the ear but make</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a certain one</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an earbud that doesn&rsquo;t have a wire</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it puts the sound up there but</p>
<p>I will put this in the video but I just</p>
<p>want to bring this up EMFs are pretty</p>
<p>intense especially if you know they say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s safe but that&rsquo;s what they said with</p>
<p>cigarettes so it&rsquo;s just a little point</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do an extensive video on that</p>
<p>of course they say sugars safe right you</p>
<p>can even give it to your babies alright</p>
<p>and baby food alright you have another</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>yep I actually got a lot of questions on</p>
<p>exercise is that okay to exercise during</p>
<p>keto and how frequent no you if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing QT can now next</p>
<p>sighs anymore I&rsquo;m just being very</p>
<p>sarcastic now you want to do exercise</p>
<p>with keto in a minute fasting it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very good thing it&rsquo;s gonna give you the</p>
<p>unfair advantage it&rsquo;s gonna speed up</p>
<p>weight loss it&rsquo;s gonna help you tone you</p>
<p>definitely need to do that so that leads</p>
<p>us to the next question Roxanna are you</p>
<p>ready for this yep okay what is the</p>
<p>number one exercise that will trigger</p>
<p>growth hormone higher than any other</p>
<p>exercise on planet earth okay what type</p>
<p>of exercise and it&rsquo;s a specific type of</p>
<p>exercise okay so go ahead and answer and</p>
<p>we will reveal this after my next caller</p>
<p>okay California we have Paris from</p>
<p>California you had a question about I</p>
<p>think cholesterol levels I can hear you</p>
<p>now yeah I&rsquo;m on keto for one year almost</p>
<p>a year and Michael doesn&rsquo;t want to come</p>
<p>down from the total closer to 42 three</p>
<p>months ago 199 and good cholesterol is</p>
<p>162 bad cholesterol the bad cholesterol</p>
<p>is anyway HDL and LDL all high and the</p>
<p>ratio is perfectly okay and a lot of I</p>
<p>asked them to do a lot of different</p>
<p>tests</p>
<p>all those yeah whatever risk and stuff</p>
<p>is okay but total HDL LDL it&rsquo;s very high</p>
<p>and my doctor office talking to my</p>
<p>statin but I don&rsquo;t want to do that so</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s any pump they gonna go down so I</p>
<p>have a question is your triglycerides</p>
<p>normal yes okay it wasn&rsquo;t normal before</p>
<p>you know but now is normal and the ratio</p>
<p>is perfectly normal I mean another test</p>
<p>is a cholesterol HDL ratio is normal</p>
<p>cholesterol percentage cholesterol is</p>
<p>normal I don&rsquo;t need a lot of testing</p>
<p>and my alpha man got slightly high and</p>
<p>the doctor said because the key your</p>
<p>alkaline albumin okay all right so let</p>
<p>me ask you another question are you</p>
<p>going through any stress right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always alright so here have you ever</p>
<p>had your pattern a and pattern B</p>
<p>cholesterol tested LDL actually I asked</p>
<p>her this time she said no and we know</p>
<p>that no she never I asked her for</p>
<p>pattern and emphatically I saw a new</p>
<p>video but she said no we don&rsquo;t need that</p>
<p>and they trying to pay but the question</p>
<p>is in any point they&rsquo;re gonna go down or</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be high already not it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that bad okay let me just answer</p>
<p>that okay so I would find another doctor</p>
<p>I would find another doctor who will do</p>
<p>the test you want to check with the</p>
<p>pattern a and pattern B I I would bet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s not the bad type of LDL I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s a good thing I think if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through stress you said</p>
<p>always think about this all your stress</p>
<p>hormones need cholesterol people that</p>
<p>are under stressed need more adrenal</p>
<p>hormones so guess what your total</p>
<p>cholesterol is gonna be high your ratios</p>
<p>are fine your triglycerides are low you</p>
<p>know what that means it means that</p>
<p>actually it&rsquo;s totally normal to have</p>
<p>slightly slightly higher cholesterol I</p>
<p>would just for the fun of it I would</p>
<p>love to be a fly on the wall put a</p>
<p>little microphone in your ear to say</p>
<p>just say doctor I&rsquo;m okay so the total</p>
<p>cholesterol is bad can you just send me</p>
<p>the research that shows that that will</p>
<p>be harmful in any way they won&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to send it to you because total</p>
<p>cholesterol means nothing even if it was</p>
<p>250 I would not be a problem or even I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s just so insignificant if these</p>
<p>other values are normal then you do not</p>
<p>have to worry about it&rsquo;s not significant</p>
<p>your body needs more cholesterol to heal</p>
<p>certain things your ratios are good so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about</p>
<p>the only thing that worried about is you</p>
<p>keep going to the doctor and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to</p>
<p>put doubts in your mind because they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand it so find another</p>
<p>doctor get your pattern a pattern B and</p>
<p>and get the truth on what&rsquo;s going on all</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>thanks Paris all right we&rsquo;re gonna go to</p>
<p>well actually we&rsquo;re gonna go to Roxanna</p>
<p>what what do we get as the number one</p>
<p>exercise that produces the most growth</p>
<p>hormone which is yeah well we got</p>
<p>several different responses yeah um</p>
<p>walking sprinting high-intensity running</p>
<p>sleeping jumping squats it was just a</p>
<p>variety of different answers okay so do</p>
<p>we do we have a drumroll please</p>
<p>sprinting sprinting can increase your</p>
<p>human growth hormone by 777 percent</p>
<p>Wow sprinting now if you have bad knees</p>
<p>get on a bike a speed bike and you can</p>
<p>go real fast the key is going as hard as</p>
<p>you can for 30 seconds or sprinting as</p>
<p>hard now when people do the honey on our</p>
<p>100-yard dash</p>
<p>Roxanna mm-hm how long is usually take</p>
<p>how many seconds yeah yeah if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really fast I think the world record is</p>
<p>what like nine something seconds I think</p>
<p>I can run it in 15 seconds yeah but the</p>
<p>point is that if you go really fast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a short workout so if you</p>
<p>did 100-yard ashes and you did or just</p>
<p>run fast you can for 30 seconds to the</p>
<p>point where your muscles can&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>anymore oh my gosh that would be the</p>
<p>ultimate workout because it&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>stress and then you wait 90 seconds and</p>
<p>then do it again now you can always add</p>
<p>that going up a hill that&rsquo;s even better</p>
<p>but the point is that work up to it get</p>
<p>a personal trainer to help you but that</p>
<p>will produce the most human growth form</p>
<p>plus it will activate the glutes the</p>
<p>thighs and I mean look at these</p>
<p>sprinters they have way better bodies</p>
<p>and long-distance runners so that is the</p>
<p>exercise that you want to graduate to</p>
<p>eventually if you want more growth</p>
<p>hormone which is the anti-aging okay</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m almost 35 years old so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working on me so okay so now we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>go to Derrick from Queens go ahead</p>
<p>Derrick hey good morning dr. Byrne how</p>
<p>are you good</p>
<p>hey last time we spoke you told me two</p>
<p>things but I&rsquo;m gonna go quickly I know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people waiting last</p>
<p>time you told me to take a pre insulin</p>
<p>test and then post one I have a script</p>
<p>here and I just want to read it to you</p>
<p>seeing if I&rsquo;m not missing anything</p>
<p>before I go and actually take these</p>
<p>tests I did take a 1 C my a1c was five</p>
<p>point one Wow perfect I think that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little high from my age I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not at all okay wholly within the normal</p>
<p>range gotcha okay this one is this one</p>
<p>says glucose postprandial glucose</p>
<p>how many minutes after should I should I</p>
<p>do that well for you first of all you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to do a glue a glucose post</p>
<p>perennial you want to do an insulin test</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re checking the blood sugar</p>
<p>Oh insulin okay so this is not the right</p>
<p>one no okay</p>
<p>okay so insulin okay</p>
<p>another thing is I have all your</p>
<p>products everything that that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>come out with I have all of it and this</p>
<p>is actually with my me and my mother we</p>
<p>are severely stressed it&rsquo;s like when you</p>
<p>explain in your videos to the point</p>
<p>where like uh or like a pin drop falls</p>
<p>and you you know you lose it because</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s how that&rsquo;s how much you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on edge you know total adrenal out</p>
<p>especially my mom and me myself so I was</p>
<p>wondering what we can take for that I do</p>
<p>have all your formulas and that&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>it I think for this week okay good so</p>
<p>until next week this is what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do</p>
<p>I just happen to for you Derek just for</p>
<p>you I just created a pretty awesome</p>
<p>webinar on stress roxanna is actually in</p>
<p>the video so it&rsquo;s just gonna be famous</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna release it this weekend so</p>
<p>you can watch that video and I actually</p>
<p>show people how to get rid of their body</p>
<p>stress it&rsquo;s not about sitting on a</p>
<p>mountain and doing meditations I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>even talking about nutrition for this</p>
<p>technique but I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to</p>
<p>extract stress and I have a lot of</p>
<p>examples over and over it&rsquo;s a technique</p>
<p>you want to watch this video with</p>
<p>someone else so you can partner up and</p>
<p>do this technique on each other and if</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t then I show you how to do it</p>
<p>do-it-yourself version but stay tuned</p>
<p>this weekend if you&rsquo;re on my youtube</p>
<p>channel you&rsquo;ll get a release will also</p>
<p>release on the Facebook too so yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll handle that</p>
<p>and Iquitos essentials downloaded</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a link down below there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>quick you know two-page thing that shows</p>
<p>you exactly what to eat what not to eat</p>
<p>also you guys I someone let you know I</p>
<p>just released a new amazing course it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called a keto coaching course if you</p>
<p>like helping people if that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>purpose in life this course will help</p>
<p>you help people a lot more so very&ndash;it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I had the health coaching course before</p>
<p>now I switched it to something called</p>
<p>the keto coach training and when you and</p>
<p>we show you how to use ketosis healthy</p>
<p>ketosis and in a minute fasting is your</p>
<p>tools so it&rsquo;s about 45 lessons it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>could probably get it done within two to</p>
<p>four weeks it&rsquo;s not a bunch of fluff</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exactly what you need to know and</p>
<p>that way you can help other people and</p>
<p>get certified so go to my website</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a button you can click it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably gonna be where is it it&rsquo;s under</p>
<p>keto yeah keto coaching I should</p>
<p>probably say coaching training but</p>
<p>anyway I&rsquo;m excited to release that and I</p>
<p>want a team of really good trained</p>
<p>people that can help other people</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many people that need your</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s exciting so check it out</p>
<p>alright Roxanna what do you what do you</p>
<p>got for any type of questions over there</p>
<p>yes Cynthia Clark from YouTube is asking</p>
<p>if keto aggravates your adrenal fatigue</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a good question it does the</p>
<p>opposite it actually helps adrenal</p>
<p>fatigue keto helps adrenal fatigue</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re fixing the blood sugars</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fixing insulin which is</p>
<p>powered the endocrine system which</p>
<p>instantly is going to actually be in</p>
<p>better for your adrenals because if you</p>
<p>actually have a blood sugar problem on</p>
<p>top of an adrenal problem it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be worsened so when you run your body on</p>
<p>ketones which is a superior fuel which</p>
<p>is is the original fuel source it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really healthy for the adrenals in fact</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the therapies for</p>
<p>the adrenals because you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>sleep better you&rsquo;re going to feel better</p>
<p>you got less inflammation it is not bad</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>the adrenals at all okay good do you</p>
<p>have another question yes Maggie Rivera</p>
<p>from Facebook she&rsquo;s asking how do you</p>
<p>get rid of toxins stored in the fat</p>
<p>cells well as you as you eat healthy and</p>
<p>you can include the cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables in the kale shake that will</p>
<p>naturally it&rsquo;s called phase 1 phase 2 UT</p>
<p>toxification slowly bringing these</p>
<p>toxins out and you don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>want to pull them out faster than that</p>
<p>but at some point you want to do that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the purification detox which</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do another video on that which</p>
<p>is the ultimate roto-rooter on steroids</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;s a sauna based and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing nutrition at the same time and you</p>
<p>can kind of extract the the toxins that</p>
<p>come out through the fat cells without</p>
<p>going through the bloodstream just comes</p>
<p>right out so you&rsquo;re wiping it off you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like wow look at that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like toxins coming out that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole different seminar so I&rsquo;ll talk</p>
<p>more about that in videos but that would</p>
<p>be the ultimate roto-rooter I&rsquo;ve done it</p>
<p>like three times and it really cleans</p>
<p>out the junk out of the trunk okay great</p>
<p>good so now we&rsquo;re gonna go to Jeremy</p>
<p>from Florida you had a question</p>
<p>hey good morning good morning</p>
<p>hey I just I just found out about you</p>
<p>about a week ago I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed</p>
<p>they diagnosed me with the it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>PMR which is polymyalgia rheumatica it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the beer joint pain I mean I&rsquo;m in severe</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got me on a prednisone and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually when I&rsquo;m on that</p>
<p>prednisone dose pack I&rsquo;m a normal person</p>
<p>I can move I can do all kind of stuff</p>
<p>but as I start tapering off of it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>back to the same Ground Zero so I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been going to an infectious-disease</p>
<p>doctor I&rsquo;ve been to a Rheumatologist and</p>
<p>their comments are fighting each other</p>
<p>so now I&rsquo;m trying to take a holistic</p>
<p>approach and try to do something so I</p>
<p>can move around and you know be active</p>
<p>again so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m calling today you know</p>
<p>first time I really even listened to</p>
<p>your show and I mean anything so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just reaching out there so if you have</p>
<p>any advice yeah I do glad to hear I do</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that you called because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some really good advice because your</p>
<p>main thing is we need to reduce</p>
<p>inflammation in your entire body right</p>
<p>and the best way to do that is with</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and if you come</p>
<p>combined in keto which will drop the</p>
<p>insulin and and help your stabilize your</p>
<p>blood sugars and combined in a minute of</p>
<p>fasting and by the way you can go to the</p>
<p>website and watch the quick version</p>
<p>which is under under educational tab</p>
<p>under how to do ketosis like for videos</p>
<p>you can watch how to do that and then</p>
<p>get the book and implement keto and</p>
<p>another fasting your inflammation will</p>
<p>come down you&rsquo;ll feel much much better</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s not treating a</p>
<p>disease what that&rsquo;s doing is getting the</p>
<p>basics in for your body to run on the</p>
<p>right fuel so it can a lot of things can</p>
<p>clear up and this is this is why it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when someone like you you know wants to</p>
<p>know a remedy for something like that</p>
<p>my question is do you have the basics in</p>
<p>yet if you don&rsquo;t then get those in</p>
<p>because chances are if you do you</p>
<p>probably won&rsquo;t have those symptoms</p>
<p>anymore because even if you ask your</p>
<p>doctor what causes this you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>a blank stare like deer in the</p>
<p>headlights like we don&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the I mean they don&rsquo;t know so that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing I would do okay is that the other</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s really really good is to</p>
<p>take boron boron okay that trace mineral</p>
<p>is really good for inflammation and pain</p>
<p>in the muscles and then the other thing</p>
<p>is stinging nettle root that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>really good one too but those won&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>unless you get the basics in so get the</p>
<p>corrected eating thing and then watch</p>
<p>what happens you just might not need to</p>
<p>take all those steroids anymore thanks</p>
<p>Jeremy alright Roxana we have another</p>
<p>question okay okay you ready for this</p>
<p>mm-hmm what is the key nutrient a very</p>
<p>specific key nutrient that will help a</p>
<p>person prevent</p>
<p>neuropathy that is like nerve damage to</p>
<p>the sensory nerves in the feet and the</p>
<p>hands okay okay what do you guys think</p>
<p>what is the specific nutrient that will</p>
<p>help prevent that and it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>nutrient that if you take you can</p>
<p>actually improve it too okay so as</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re answering that question I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go right to Teresa from South</p>
<p>Carolina you had a question about the</p>
<p>adrenal type right that&rsquo;s correct yeah</p>
<p>what was your question is it possible to</p>
<p>be adrenal type and the fatty liver same</p>
<p>time good question yeah it really is</p>
<p>Theresa because you can have a</p>
<p>combination of body types you can have</p>
<p>the adrenal with a little ovary adrenal</p>
<p>with liver absolutely because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all connected so think about this let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just say for example you had an adrenal</p>
<p>type and you&rsquo;re pumping all this</p>
<p>cortisol out which is then turning your</p>
<p>muscles into sugar which is then</p>
<p>creating more of a blood sugar issue and</p>
<p>more fat guess where that that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>go into the liver a lot of adrenal cases</p>
<p>end up with a fatty liver because</p>
<p>cortisol releases fat or converts</p>
<p>protein into fat and so it&rsquo;s gonna end</p>
<p>up in your liver</p>
<p>so absolutely so what you want to do is</p>
<p>you want to get the basics in first get</p>
<p>the keto and in and fasting and give</p>
<p>that it really cleaned up and then</p>
<p>reevaluate get your liver check see if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better get your drina&rsquo;s check to</p>
<p>see if it&rsquo;s better and I bet a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a lot better okay all</p>
<p>right Roxanna what do we have as an</p>
<p>answer we have a variety it&rsquo;s vitamin D</p>
<p>calcium vitamin C potassium B complex</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a variety all right so do we</p>
<p>have a drumroll please</p>
<p>the answer is vitamin b1 okay anyone</p>
<p>that is the key one to actually prevent</p>
<p>peripheral neuropathies protect Roxana</p>
<p>your mitochondria that&rsquo;s the little</p>
<p>energy factors in the cell that produce</p>
<p>energy I&rsquo;ve ever heard of the Krebs</p>
<p>cycle yeah okay we won&rsquo;t get into that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the energy metabolism thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on in the in the cells of</p>
<p>the mitochondria basically it needs b1</p>
<p>if you have a dysfunctional deficiency</p>
<p>of b1 then you&rsquo;re gonna start getting</p>
<p>side effects if your sugars too high if</p>
<p>you actually have enough b1 and your</p>
<p>bloodstream in your system and you</p>
<p>actually are have high sugar this</p>
<p>symptoms will be much much less with</p>
<p>your neurology and your nerves so</p>
<p>nutritional yeast is is one of the best</p>
<p>sources of b1 and if you have peripheral</p>
<p>neuropathy you want to take a fats I</p>
<p>will be one which is called benfotiamine</p>
<p>look it up then folk to me and I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll help you okay alright so now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go to the next call or</p>
<p>Patricia you&rsquo;re from South Carolina go</p>
<p>ahead you had a question yes thank you</p>
<p>dr. Burke</p>
<p>hmm I just found you not that long ago</p>
<p>about a week ago</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m YouTube and I I&rsquo;ve started to adopt</p>
<p>this lifestyle you teach so I&rsquo;m 50 years</p>
<p>old</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 510 and I weigh 330 pounds and my</p>
<p>son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes</p>
<p>which is a devastating thing but I</p>
<p>decided I want to find out what the</p>
<p>mystery to good eating and health is so</p>
<p>I could move around and stay alive the</p>
<p>one thing I&rsquo;m having trouble with I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>asking from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 a.m. I</p>
<p>feel wonderful just it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>miraculous when I sit down to eat my big</p>
<p>salad which I copy from your video I got</p>
<p>a big bowl I did everything the way did</p>
<p>I literally can filling up and cannot I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong you know I just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t eat that much I feel so full and I</p>
<p>wanted to ask for your insight on that</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good question because yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like here here all this all this</p>
<p>fiber and you&rsquo;re like oh my god if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not used to consuming that salad</p>
<p>what I would do is I would cut it down</p>
<p>probably in half get used to it because</p>
<p>it is a lot of fiber because we don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>want to add a little protein in there</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re over 300 pounds you know</p>
<p>what if you could just do the salad with</p>
<p>protein and not add extra fat and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>comfortable with that go for it because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to actually help you some</p>
<p>people start craving salad they keep</p>
<p>eating like lots of salad and that that</p>
<p>way they get the nutrients but what</p>
<p>happens is it does fill up the entire</p>
<p>testin with a lot of fiber so they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a chance to eat anything else so</p>
<p>you may want to even also try the</p>
<p>protein first and then some salad after</p>
<p>but experiment with that if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually your bowels are going and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting constipated then that</p>
<p>does mean that you can tolerate that</p>
<p>amount of greens but maybe with myself I</p>
<p>think what I did is I I&rsquo;ve been doing it</p>
<p>for such a long time my body can digest</p>
<p>a lot of salad but some people might</p>
<p>need to go very gradual but I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing the right thing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling better keep going and I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna help you a lot because I just</p>
<p>want to let you know that I have we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on in - tune in radio right now you can</p>
<p>we have an app no we don&rsquo;t have an app</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually in the app and so you can</p>
<p>download that you can listen to us in</p>
<p>the car so that way you can be walking</p>
<p>and doing whatever and you can hear some</p>
<p>of these shows so it&rsquo;s tuned in and not</p>
<p>to mention anchor app also has this as</p>
<p>well so if you want to download that you</p>
<p>can check it out it&rsquo;s pretty cool and</p>
<p>also the keto essentials the link down</p>
<p>below you don&rsquo;t if you want to know the</p>
<p>basics go ahead and download that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a really quick version okay</p>
<p>alright so now Roxanna I have another</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>okay and this is something very new what</p>
<p>is the fifth body type okay so I wrote a</p>
<p>book on the four body types what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fifth body type what do you think okay</p>
<p>and why you&rsquo;re thinking we&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>right to Roy from Kentucky he has a</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>go ahead Roy oh hi hi Roy from Kentucky</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually at my church doing my walk</p>
<p>was why did he talk to you</p>
<p>good I started on March 7 to March 7th</p>
<p>of this year I was 13 pounds away from</p>
<p>300 pounds okay I started doing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing like eating a salad</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like dairy clean eating half of it</p>
<p>you know with chickens right then eating</p>
<p>the other half for supper and adnap</p>
<p>wroking I&rsquo;ve been able to take off 30</p>
<p>pounds in in the 29 days Wow is that</p>
<p>faster is that too fast of a weight-loss</p>
<p>and the other question I have is what do</p>
<p>you do when you get down to your target</p>
<p>weights to maintain it okay good</p>
<p>question right let me answer both of</p>
<p>those number one I think you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s not too much weight loss</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s gonna happen you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been running your body and sugar</p>
<p>for a while so all that sugar in your</p>
<p>system stored in something called</p>
<p>glycogen glycogen it also has a lot of</p>
<p>water connected to it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>fluid-filled sponge so as you dump all</p>
<p>this extra fluid make sure you take your</p>
<p>electrolytes to you by the way you dump</p>
<p>all this extra fluid out of your system</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna drop a lot of weight it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not all fat it&rsquo;s fluid you need to get</p>
<p>rid of the fluid so no it&rsquo;s not too much</p>
<p>weight loss especially if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>the right evening plan so you may start</p>
<p>plateauing at some point you might come</p>
<p>down to like eight pounds because really</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the maximum fat that you can burn</p>
<p>per month is eight pounds of fat per</p>
<p>month eight pounds so these people that</p>
<p>are like losing eight pounds a month</p>
<p>they think oh my gosh it&rsquo;s not working</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like yes it is working it&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>good so yeah you&rsquo;re doing fun on that</p>
<p>and then the other question you had is</p>
<p>what to do to maintain it because if you</p>
<p>keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see hit your weight goal and all of a</p>
<p>sudden now you&rsquo;re going to get it to</p>
<p>skinny we can&rsquo;t have that so here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>you just simply increase your fat to the</p>
<p>point where you&rsquo;re maintaining you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna gain weight on fat if your</p>
<p>carbohydrates are low you&rsquo;re just gonna</p>
<p>maintain it</p>
<p>okay I mean I don&rsquo;t know of anyone maybe</p>
<p>there is someone out there I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if anyone I&rsquo;ve never heard of this by</p>
<p>someone doing a lot of fat with low</p>
<p>carbs and gaining a lot of fat I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seen it it&rsquo;s the carbs because that</p>
<p>controls insulin okay all right Roxanna</p>
<p>what do we got for the answer on this</p>
<p>one what&rsquo;s the fifth body type we have</p>
<p>normal body type keto adapted body type</p>
<p>a healthy body type fat adopted body</p>
<p>type okay so basically you guys don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what do you think Roxanna I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know well I just I was thinking about</p>
<p>this yesterday and the answer is the</p>
<p>pancreas body type oh it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>insulin resistance and I just it just</p>
<p>hit me yesterday I&rsquo;m like sitting there</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going wait a second there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>body type I&rsquo;ve missed it because we have</p>
<p>the liver we have the dream where the</p>
<p>overall of the thyroid but that pancreas</p>
<p>the cells of the pancreas are called the</p>
<p>islets of langerhans you knew that they</p>
<p>actually start getting a little bigger</p>
<p>as they produce all this insulin so it</p>
<p>pumps out this hormone insulin which</p>
<p>then is a dominant hormone and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna gain weight very similar to the</p>
<p>adrenal but one&rsquo;s caused by one thing</p>
<p>and the others caused by something else</p>
<p>so stay tuned for more on that but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to build that into my new quit my</p>
<p>quiz for body type it&rsquo;s gonna be called</p>
<p>the fifth body touch just because some</p>
<p>people have this and they don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know it and it&rsquo;s gonna solve a lot of</p>
<p>problems okay all right now we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>go to Christine from France go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the line yes hello dr. Berg</p>
<p>from our English and English living in</p>
<p>France and I got I&rsquo;ve got the question</p>
<p>about cortisol my blood group is rhesus</p>
<p>a negative and apparently that creates</p>
<p>too much</p>
<p>cortisol in the body and I&rsquo;ve recently</p>
<p>found out have recently been for a blood</p>
<p>test and the cortisol is coming up high</p>
<p>so the next step my doctor is going to</p>
<p>send me for a scan an abdominal scan to</p>
<p>look at the adrenals I was doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and I was doing</p>
<p>quite well</p>
<p>and then as usual when I follow a diet I</p>
<p>start craving chocolate for example do</p>
<p>you know have you heard of this before</p>
<p>yeah and here&rsquo;s a couple tips because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be the last call I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>give you some tips so you can do</p>
<p>sugar-free chocolate that&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>problem you can do some of that make</p>
<p>sure you do it doesn&rsquo;t have chocolate</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have caffeine it does have</p>
<p>another stimulant so don&rsquo;t do a lot but</p>
<p>I do know you&rsquo;re in France so you have</p>
<p>to have chocolate but you definitely</p>
<p>need to do the keto in a minute fasting</p>
<p>because with that you can add these</p>
<p>wonderful desserts</p>
<p>these fatty desserts with chocolate at</p>
<p>the end of the meal not a problem you</p>
<p>can do that and I think that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>help you now this weekend watch my</p>
<p>youtube channel because I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
