    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language and the people who contributed to that history.</p>
<p>Over the last few episodes, we&rsquo;ve looked at the oldest known ancestor of English, the</p>
<p>ancient Indo-European language called Proto-Indo-European Bilingualist.</p>
<p>We looked at how the language was discovered, and then how it was reconstructed.</p>
<p>We also looked at some of the reconstructed words and the connection many of those words</p>
<p>have to modern English.</p>
<p>But who were these original Indo-European people?</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, a large portion of this ancient language was reconstructed</p>
<p>during the 19th and 20th centuries, but linguists were not entirely sure who these people were.</p>
<p>Many of them had their own opinions and guesses, but there were so many theories that I probably</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t explore all of them in this episode.</p>
<p>And many of these theories were wrong, sometimes really wrong, and even today, this remains</p>
<p>one of the more controversial topics in linguistics.</p>
<p>There are still many differences of opinion as to the original homeland of the Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>and the specific manner in which they migrated to the point where the various Indo-European</p>
<p>languages are spoken today, and I&rsquo;m certainly not going to resolve all of those debates</p>
<p>in this episode.</p>
<p>But I do believe that a consensus as to the original homeland has started to emerge.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the view I&rsquo;m going to present here.</p>
<p>And while some linguists and historians may still disagree with some aspects of this theory,</p>
<p>the theory that I&rsquo;m presenting in this episode is the majority view today.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the evidence we have to solve the mystery of the original Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>is very limited.</p>
<p>For much of the history of antiquity, we can rely upon the written accounts of the Greeks</p>
<p>and the Romans and the few other literate people of the time who kept and maintained</p>
<p>written records.</p>
<p>But the Indo-Europeans were the ancient ancestors of the Romans and the Greeks, so we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have written records from these people.</p>
<p>We have to rely upon clues within the original Indo-European language itself, and then we</p>
<p>have to compare those clues to the archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>Eventually, by putting all these pieces together, we can at least narrow down the options to</p>
<p>a general location and a general time frame in which these people lived.</p>
<p>One other quick note before I jump into this topic.</p>
<p>As with the other episodes of this podcast, I&rsquo;ve utilized lots of different resources</p>
<p>for this episode.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s one particular resource which was invaluable, and I wanted to make a specific</p>
<p>mention of it here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a recent book by David W. Anthony called The Horse, the Wheel, and Language.</p>
<p>How Bronze Age Writers from the Eurasian Steps Shaped the World.</p>
<p>Anthony is an archaeologist by profession, but he&rsquo;s spent a tremendous amount of time</p>
<p>studying the origin of the original Indo-Europeans, and his book links the linguistic evidence</p>
<p>with the archaeological and other physical evidence to determine where and when these</p>
<p>people lived.</p>
<p>So check out his book if you want more information about this topic.</p>
<p>Let me also mention that since we&rsquo;re dealing with the very distant past, I&rsquo;m electing</p>
<p>to use the traditional terms B.C. and A.D. to distinguish dates.</p>
<p>I realize that modern historians prefer to use B.C.E. and C.E., but those terms can get</p>
<p>confusing in a podcast, so I&rsquo;ll use the more traditional B.C. and A.D.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at the evidence.</p>
<p>In order to analyze the clues to determine who the Indo-Europeans were, we really need</p>
<p>to get a handle on the geography of Eastern Europe and Eurasia.</p>
<p>Obviously the best way to do that is by reference to a map, and you can find a map at historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>Just click on Episode 9.</p>
<p>But since this is a podcast and many of you listening may not have a map to look at while</p>
<p>listening to the episode, I&rsquo;m going to try to set the scene for you.</p>
<p>Let me begin by noting that the history of the early tribes of Europe and Asia is really</p>
<p>an East-West history, not so much a North-South history.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is that for centuries and centuries the movement of peoples between</p>
<p>Europe, Asia, and North Africa was eastward and westward.</p>
<p>Trading routes and migratory routes were along these east-west routes.</p>
<p>The Silk Road, for example, was the primary trading route which extended from East Asia</p>
<p>to the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>From ancient China, the trading routes moved westward, through ancient Persia into the</p>
<p>Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>But further north, in northern Eurasia, nomadic peoples also moved east-west along the Eurasian</p>
<p>steppes, which are the vast grasslands that extend from eastern Europe all the way to</p>
<p>eastern Asia.</p>
<p>These people included later groups, like the Huns and the Mongols, and probably included</p>
<p>the very first Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>But why was the movement east-west and not north-south?</p>
<p>Well the answer to that question lies in geography, because there&rsquo;s a series of natural barriers</p>
<p>extending across Europe and Asia which inhibit north-south travel.</p>
<p>And these barriers extend from western Europe all the way to China.</p>
<p>The most obvious of these barriers lies in the west, and it&rsquo;s the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>This vast sea, which separates Europe from Africa, prevented significant migrations or</p>
<p>movements from one side to the other.</p>
<p>Originally there were traders who crossed the Mediterranean by boat or ship.</p>
<p>But in these ancient times, large movements or migrations of people across vast seas or</p>
<p>oceans was impractical, if not impossible.</p>
<p>Remember that in ancient times, many of these people were herders who traveled with their</p>
<p>animals, including sheep, oxen, and other animals.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t really possible for tribes of people to cross a large body of water with</p>
<p>the animals in tow.</p>
<p>So the Mediterranean is an obvious barrier inhibiting north-south travel.</p>
<p>As we move eastward, the next natural barrier lies just to the east of the Mediterranean,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the Black Sea.</p>
<p>This oval-shaped sea is connected to the Mediterranean by a waterway, which forms the dividing line</p>
<p>between Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Then as we look eastward from the Black Sea, we have another sea, the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>And as we move eastward from the Caspian Sea, we find the vast deserts and arid regions</p>
<p>of Central Asia.</p>
<p>This includes modern Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>And even though some limited travel through this region was possible, the rugged and dry</p>
<p>terrain made it very difficult for any extended period of travel by large groups of people</p>
<p>and animals.</p>
<p>So we have these three seas that I just mentioned, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the</p>
<p>Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>And these seas together form part of the series of obstacles which limited north-south travel</p>
<p>in ancient times.</p>
<p>So if these seas are natural barriers inhibiting north-south travel, what about the areas in</p>
<p>between them?</p>
<p>Why not just travel through the area in between those seas?</p>
<p>Well, with regard to the area between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, the answer</p>
<p>is that there is another barrier, the Caucasus Mountains.</p>
<p>This mountain range extends eastward from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea, and it basically</p>
<p>creates a wall between those two seas.</p>
<p>The Caucasus Mountains are the home of modern Georgia, Azerbaijan, and southern Russia.</p>
<p>Once again, it was very difficult for a tribe of people together with animals, wagons, and</p>
<p>other belongings to cross a mountain range.</p>
<p>But what about the area between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean?</p>
<p>Well, this was really the only good place to cross from north to south.</p>
<p>This narrow crossing point, which includes the Bosphorus Strait, is not blocked by a</p>
<p>rugged mountain range or other natural barrier.</p>
<p>And not surprisingly, the areas of Europe just to the north of this area, known as the</p>
<p>Balkans, is the location of the oldest settlements in Europe.</p>
<p>This passage became tied to the trading routes coming from the Far East and from Egypt and</p>
<p>North Africa.</p>
<p>All of these trade routes met just south of the area between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean</p>
<p>in what came to be known as the Middle East, also known as the crossroads of the ancient</p>
<p>world for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>So we have the Mediterranean, Black Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and Caspian Sea forming an east-west</p>
<p>barrier inhibiting travel, except for a narrow passage between the Mediterranean and the</p>
<p>Black Sea.</p>
<p>The consequence of these natural barriers is that two ancient east-west highways developed.</p>
<p>The Silk Road, which developed to the south of these barriers, is the most famous.</p>
<p>But to the north of these barriers we find the vast prairie of the Eurasian steppes which</p>
<p>extend from eastern Europe all the way to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>And this massive territory also permitted east-west movements, and it&rsquo;s the same region</p>
<p>that will become very important to our story.</p>
<p>Now there are three reasons for this little geography refresher.</p>
<p>First to introduce you to the landscape of Eurasia.</p>
<p>Secondly, to introduce the early trade and migratory routes which become very important</p>
<p>as we look at migrations of ancient people.</p>
<p>And third, and perhaps most importantly, to introduce you to the area around the Black</p>
<p>Sea because much of the next couple of episodes of the podcast will center on this region.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look a little closer at the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s travel clockwise around the Black Sea and see what&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already mentioned that the Caucasus Mountains extend from the east side of the Black Sea</p>
<p>to the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>So to the east and southeast we have a mountainous region.</p>
<p>To the south of the Black Sea lies modern-day Turkey, what was once known and referred to</p>
<p>as Anatolia or Asia Minor.</p>
<p>To the west of the Black Sea is the Bosporus Strait and the waterway which extends to the</p>
<p>Mediterranean.</p>
<p>North of this waterway, as we move clockwise around the Black Sea, is the area known as</p>
<p>the Balkans, the home of modern-day Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p>And this is the area where the Danube empties into the Black Sea.</p>
<p>And as we continue to move northward through the Balkans in a clockwise motion around the</p>
<p>Black Sea, we arrive at the area north of the Black Sea.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s here that we find the probable home of the ancient Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>This area north of the Black Sea is the westernmost portion of that vast, grassy region known</p>
<p>as the Eurasian Steppes.</p>
<p>And this region extends from this part of Eastern Europe all the way to the Great Wall</p>
<p>of China.</p>
<p>And really, this is the last geographical feature that&rsquo;s essential to this story.</p>
<p>So what is a steppe?</p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s basically a massive prairie like is found in the central United States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a transitional region between the desert areas to the south in the Near East and Central</p>
<p>Asia and the Russian forest in the north.</p>
<p>In this transitional region, there&rsquo;s enough moisture to produce vegetation like grass,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not enough moisture to produce thick forests.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically just a grassy transitional zone that extends across two continents.</p>
<p>This is the same type of transitional zone that we have in the United States between</p>
<p>the western United States deserts and the heavily forested areas in the east.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we find the Great Plains.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically the same thing.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the Eurasian Steppes extend across Europe and Asia, with the westernmost</p>
<p>portion being located in this area north of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>This region is also sometimes called the Russian Steppe.</p>
<p>Now before we look at the specific evidence to determine the home of the original Indo-Europeans,</p>
<p>let me begin by giving away the ending a bit.</p>
<p>Linguists have generally narrowed the possibilities for the Indo-European homeland down to two</p>
<p>main possibilities.</p>
<p>One option is that the Indo-European homeland was south of the Black Sea in Anatolia, which</p>
<p>is modern-day Turkey.</p>
<p>And that homeland existed around 6500 BC.</p>
<p>This theory was once very popular and it still has its supporters, but it&rsquo;s largely given</p>
<p>way to the other theory which has emerged as the more dominant theory in light of modern</p>
<p>research and evidence, including both linguistic and archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>This second option holds that the Indo-European homeland was in this area north of the Black</p>
<p>Sea and the Caspian Sea in the Russian Steppe, in the southern area of modern Ukraine and</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>This theory also suggests that the Indo-Europeans lived there much more recently.</p>
<p>Unlike the 6500 BC date suggested by supporters of the first theory, those who believe that</p>
<p>the homeland was north of the Black Sea believe the original Indo-Europeans were there between</p>
<p>about 2500 BC and 4500 BC.</p>
<p>So why has this second theory become the generally accepted theory for the date and location</p>
<p>of the Indo-European homeland?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s look at the evidence.</p>
<p>Let me begin by noting one more time that, like all aspects of Indo-European origins</p>
<p>and migrations, there&rsquo;s no absolute consensus about anything.</p>
<p>Remember that we&rsquo;re dealing with prehistory and it&rsquo;s a matter of deciphering various</p>
<p>clues to reach an ultimate conclusion.</p>
<p>Rather than presenting every possible theory on the subject in this episode, I&rsquo;m only</p>
<p>going to focus on what I believe to be the current majority view of these issues.</p>
<p>So with that disclaimer out of the way, let&rsquo;s look at the evidence.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the time frame when this original Indo-European language would have</p>
<p>been spoken.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually easier to identify the end of this period than the beginning.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the original Indo-European language is the parent language from which</p>
<p>all other Indo-European languages were descended.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the ancestor of all the daughter languages which came later.</p>
<p>So there was a time when this original language was spoken, and at some point the speakers</p>
<p>of this language began to separate from each other and they began to migrate and carry</p>
<p>a version of the original language with them.</p>
<p>At that point we have variations of the original language which will eventually evolve into</p>
<p>the different language families in the various daughter languages like Hittite, Latin, Greek</p>
<p>and Sanskrit.</p>
<p>So if we can determine when these various daughter languages began to appear as distinct</p>
<p>languages, then by definition we are beyond the date when the original language was spoken.</p>
<p>So the first step in this process is to determine when the first known Indo-European languages</p>
<p>appeared.</p>
<p>Again, if we can establish a date for the first appearance of those languages, we know</p>
<p>we are beyond the period of the original language.</p>
<p>So that will mark the latest possible point in which the original language could have</p>
<p>been spoken.</p>
<p>And in fact, languages don&rsquo;t just appear overnight.</p>
<p>It usually takes several centuries for one language to evolve into a separate language.</p>
<p>Think about the evolution of Latin into French, Spanish and the other Romance languages.</p>
<p>It took several centuries to get there.</p>
<p>So even when we identify the point at which we have the first known Indo-European languages,</p>
<p>the original language would have been spoken a few centuries before that date.</p>
<p>So we have to allow for that period of evolution and language change as well.</p>
<p>So to figure out when the original Indo-European period ended, let&rsquo;s try to find the date of</p>
<p>the first daughter languages.</p>
<p>Now linguists have looked at all of the ancient Indo-European languages and they&rsquo;ve identified</p>
<p>the earliest known date when each one existed.</p>
<p>And in some cases they have very specific dates and for others they have a general time</p>
<p>frame.</p>
<p>Again this is not to say that the languages first appeared on those dates.</p>
<p>Obviously those languages would have been in existence before those dates.</p>
<p>But these are the earliest dates that we can actually confirm that the languages were on</p>
<p>the ground and being spoken in those regions.</p>
<p>So we can say with some certainty that we have the descendants of the original language</p>
<p>in place on those dates.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re therefore outside of the range of the original language by these dates.</p>
<p>Now based upon all of the research of linguists and historians, the first Indo-European languages</p>
<p>to appear as distinct languages were the ancient Hittite language in modern day Turkey, the</p>
<p>very earliest Greek language known as Mycenaean Greek, and the Old Indic language of India</p>
<p>which was the ancestor of Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Now for each of these very old ancient languages, linguists have identified the earliest known</p>
<p>date during which each of these was being spoken.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with the oldest known Indo-European language, the Hittite language of Anatolia,</p>
<p>which remember is modern day Turkey.</p>
<p>Hittite is part of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European family tree.</p>
<p>All of those Anatolian languages are believed to be about the same age, having evolved from</p>
<p>the original Indo-European language about the same time.</p>
<p>But we know the most about the Hittite language, so I&rsquo;ll focus on that one.</p>
<p>You may remember from earlier episodes that the Hittites are mentioned in the Old Testament</p>
<p>of the Bible, and that their language has existed in cuneiform inscriptions for centuries.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t until the early 20th century that linguists deciphered the language and</p>
<p>determined that it was actually an Indo-European language.</p>
<p>So what about the first known date of the language?</p>
<p>Well according to researchers, the Hittite language was an established language in Turkey</p>
<p>as early as 1900 BC.</p>
<p>And remember that there were also related languages within this Anatolian branch, which</p>
<p>were also being spoken in other parts of Turkey or Anatolia during this same time frame.</p>
<p>And since it would have taken some time, probably several centuries, for these languages to</p>
<p>become distinct and established in these areas, the ancestral language would have been spoken</p>
<p>a few centuries prior to this date.</p>
<p>So 2500 BC is generally given as a rough estimate for the date when the original Indo-European</p>
<p>ancestors of the Hittites arrived in Anatolia.</p>
<p>So around 2500 BC, the early ancestors of the Hittites arrived in modern-day Turkey.</p>
<p>By 1900 BC, the various Anatolian languages, including Hittite, had developed and can be</p>
<p>documented as established languages in these regions.</p>
<p>So that gives us our first date to work with.</p>
<p>If the ancestors of these Anatolian speakers separated around 2500 BC, that would mark</p>
<p>the latest possible date of the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s one little caveat to the use of this date, 2500 BC.</p>
<p>Hittite has several unique features which have led some linguists to conclude that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a descendant of the original Indo-European language at all, but instead is a sibling</p>
<p>or cousin of the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>In other words, the Anatolian languages and the original Indo-European language may have</p>
<p>each descended from an even older common ancestor.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s true, the dates during which Hittite was spoken will not be of much help.</p>
<p>So with that caveat in mind, let&rsquo;s look at the next oldest Indo-European language.</p>
<p>The next oldest language for which we have confident dates is the ancient Mycenaean Greek</p>
<p>language which appeared in Greece no later than 1650 BC.</p>
<p>The Mycenaeans are considered the first Indo-European Greeks, and their language is the oldest known</p>
<p>Greek dialect.</p>
<p>Now again, we have Mycenaean Greek on the ground and being spoken in 1650 BC.</p>
<p>So it would have taken some time to get to this point from the original language.</p>
<p>Linguists estimate that Mycenaean Greek probably originated as a dialect of the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language at least 500 to 700 years earlier.</p>
<p>So that puts the split of the earliest Greek speakers from the original Indo-European speakers</p>
<p>at around 2200 BC.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just a short period after the estimated split of the Hittite ancestors in 2500 BC</p>
<p>that I just mentioned.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re getting the same general time frame.</p>
<p>The next oldest language family is Old Indic, which is the precursor of Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Old Indic appeared in writing as far back as 1500 BC.</p>
<p>But again, by this point Old Indic was an established language, which had evolved from</p>
<p>an even older Indo-Iranian language, which itself was an offshoot of the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>So if we account for the time that it would have taken for this language to fully evolve</p>
<p>into Old Indic, linguists estimate that the earliest Indo-Iranian language was in place</p>
<p>and distinct from the original Indo-European language by 2500 to 2300 BC.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re looking at almost the exact time frame.</p>
<p>So that gives us 2500 BC for the split of the Anatolian branch, 2200 BC for the split</p>
<p>of the Greek branch, and 2500 to 2300 for the Indo-Iranian branch.</p>
<p>So based on all of this, historians tend to use 2500 BC, give or take a few centuries,</p>
<p>as the end of the original Indo-European period.</p>
<p>So by 2500 BC, the original Indo-European language had begun to fragment into dialects</p>
<p>that later became the Anatolian group, the Indo-Iranian group, and the Hellenic or Greek</p>
<p>group.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how we know the approximate date at which the original Indo-European period</p>
<p>ended.</p>
<p>But when did it begin?</p>
<p>Actually this takes us much further back in time, where we have even less evidence.</p>
<p>But there are clues buried within some of the original Indo-European words that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>looked at in some of the earlier episodes.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with words related to woven wool textiles and fabrics.</p>
<p>The key here is woven wool.</p>
<p>Woven wool textiles and fabrics did not exist before 4000 BC, and some archaeologists believe</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t exist before 3500 BC.</p>
<p>Woven wool textiles are made from long fibers that didn&rsquo;t grow on wild sheep.</p>
<p>It required domesticated sheep bred for long wool, and this long wool allowed ancient people</p>
<p>to create woolen textiles.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European language also contained root words for sheep, ewe, ram, and lamb,</p>
<p>which indicates access to domesticated sheep.</p>
<p>So these people apparently had domesticated sheep with wool, which was long enough for</p>
<p>woolen fabrics and textiles.</p>
<p>Now based on archaeological evidence, sheep were domesticated between 8000 BC and 7500</p>
<p>BC in the eastern portions of modern-day Turkey and the western portions of modern-day</p>
<p>Iran.</p>
<p>But for around 4000 years, they were only used for meat.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have the long wool required for textiles until around 4000 BC to 3500 BC.</p>
<p>This conclusion is based on the animal bone evidence in the archaeological record.</p>
<p>Another clue as to the location of the original Indo-European speakers, which I&rsquo;ll focus</p>
<p>on in more detail in a minute, is that sheep were initially domesticated in the Near East</p>
<p>and later brought to Europe.</p>
<p>The longer hair required for textiles may have evolved in the colder European climate,</p>
<p>and the longer hair may have then started to be used for fabrics.</p>
<p>So anyway, woven wool textiles appeared in Europe and the Near East after 3300 BC, though</p>
<p>wool-bearing sheep could have appeared as early as 4000 BC in the northern Caucasus</p>
<p>Mountains.</p>
<p>So all of this suggests that the original Indo-European language had to be spoken after</p>
<p>around 4000 BC when sheep with long wool existed.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first big clue as to the earliest possible date of the Indo-European language.</p>
<p>But now let&rsquo;s consider the original Indo-European words related to wheels and wagons.</p>
<p>Wheeled wagons did not exist before 4000 BC.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European language has two words for wheel, and other words for axle</p>
<p>and phil, which was the pole to which animals were yoked, and it also has a verb meaning</p>
<p>to ride in the sense of go in a vehicle.</p>
<p>Archaeology and inscriptions on ancient relics indicate that wheeled vehicles were widespread</p>
<p>after 3400 BC, and there&rsquo;s no evidence of wheeled vehicles before 4000 BC.</p>
<p>By 3500 BC or so, the wheeled vehicle had probably been invented, and by 3000 BC its</p>
<p>use was widespread throughout the Near Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>So this gives us pretty much the exact time frame as the woven wool words.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European language had to have been spoken after wheeled vehicles existed</p>
<p>around 4000 BC.</p>
<p>So based on the linguistic and archaeological evidence, the original Indo-European language</p>
<p>was being spoken by around 4000 BC, and we can even say 4500 BC to be a little bit generous</p>
<p>and extend that possible time frame back a bit.</p>
<p>And that language had fractured and split into separate daughter languages by 2500 BC</p>
<p>as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>So that narrows the maximum time frame in which this original Indo-European language</p>
<p>could have been spoken from around 4500 BC at the beginning to around 2500 BC at the</p>
<p>end.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the when.</p>
<p>What about the where?</p>
<p>Well, this has tended to be the most controversial issue among historians and linguists.</p>
<p>So where did these original Indo-European speakers live?</p>
<p>Again, part of the answer lies in the words the Indo-Europeans used.</p>
<p>The Indo-European words for plants and animals include many of those found in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Words like birch, otter, beaver, lynx, bear, horse, bee, honey, snow, and ice.</p>
<p>But there are no Indo-European cognate words for animals or vegetation native to tropical</p>
<p>or Mediterranean or desert climates.</p>
<p>Words like monkey, lion, bamboo, parrot, palm tree, or camel.</p>
<p>Now the absence of a word doesn&rsquo;t prove that the word or the thing the word describes didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>It may be the case that there&rsquo;s simply not a surviving cognate word.</p>
<p>But the fact that there are so many words for plants and animals in temperate climates</p>
<p>and no such words for plants or animals in tropical or desert climates.</p>
<p>That suggests that these people lived in cooler, temperate climates further north.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in an earlier episode, the Indo-European words bee and honey are of particular importance.</p>
<p>Honey has been reconstructed as medhu in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>This word is also the source of the word mead, which is a honey-based alcoholic drink that</p>
<p>was popular for centuries.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why those words are so important.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have honey or mead without honeybees.</p>
<p>And honeybees were not native east of the Ural Mountains, which is the mountain range</p>
<p>that divides Europe from Asia.</p>
<p>So this also narrows the scope of the possible homeland of the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>It basically removes Siberia and much of northeastern Eurasia, including the Central Asian steppes of Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Another clue that excludes this same region from consideration is the fact that the area</p>
<p>east of the Urals continued to be occupied by hunter-gatherers until 2500 BC, which remember</p>
<p>marks the end of the original Indo-European period.</p>
<p>Since the people in this region were hunter-gatherers, there were no domesticated animals in this</p>
<p>region until after that time frame.</p>
<p>Yet the original Indo-European language had words for domesticated animals, like sheep,</p>
<p>oxen, and horses.</p>
<p>So this also tends to exclude this same region.</p>
<p>However, farming and herding were practiced in the areas south and west of the Urals during</p>
<p>this period.</p>
<p>In other words, on the European side of the Urals.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a major clue that we&rsquo;re looking at the area of Europe, not Asia east of the Urals.</p>
<p>Another clue is the word horse.</p>
<p>The fact that this word exists in the original Indo-European language is also of particular</p>
<p>importance.</p>
<p>Horse has been reconstructed as equo in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>This is the source of the modern English word equine.</p>
<p>I talked about the many ways in which that word was used in the original Indo-European</p>
<p>grammar in the last episode.</p>
<p>Well between 4500 BC and 2500 BC, which remembers the period during which the original Indo-European</p>
<p>language was being spoken, horses were rarely found or were completely absent in the Near</p>
<p>East, Iran, and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>But they were numerous and very important in the Eurasian steppes.</p>
<p>So as we narrow the range of possibilities where the original Indo-European language</p>
<p>was spoken, we can start to exclude Asia east of the Urals, and the Near East, Iran,</p>
<p>and Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>That leaves temperate Europe and the temperate parts of Anatolia and the Caucasus Mountains.</p>
<p>Another clue is some of the strong similarities between the original Indo-European language</p>
<p>and the early Uralic languages.</p>
<p>The Uralic language family is distinct from the Indo-European language family, and it</p>
<p>includes most of the few languages of Europe that are not of Indo-European origin.</p>
<p>These languages are spoken in northern Europe and Siberia, including Magyar in Hungary,</p>
<p>as well as Finnish and Estonian.</p>
<p>Now these languages show evidence of word borrowings from the Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>Proto-Uralic, which was the first version of the Uralic languages, may have borrowed</p>
<p>several words from the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>That includes words for give, sell, bring, wash, fear, spin, walk, drill, price, water,</p>
<p>name, and a few others.</p>
<p>And this suggests very early contact between the first Uralic speakers and the first Indo-European</p>
<p>speakers.</p>
<p>The homeland of the first Uralic languages was probably in the forest zone north of the</p>
<p>Russian steppes, and more specifically the forest zone in the southern flanks of the</p>
<p>Ural Mountains.</p>
<p>So the contact must have been in the vicinity of the Ural Mountains, and we&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>established that the Indo-European speakers were most likely not present east of the Urals.</p>
<p>So this leaves the area south and west of the Urals that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>In earlier episodes of the podcast, I also mentioned several cultural factors that are</p>
<p>indicated by the original Indo-European vocabulary, and these can basically be summarized as follows.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European speakers raised and bred animals because we have words like</p>
<p>bull, cow, ox, ram, ewe, lamb, pig, and dog, and we have words meaning to drive cattle</p>
<p>and to shear, as in wool, and weave, as in textiles, and yoke, as worn by oxen.</p>
<p>All of these words are associated with domesticated animals.</p>
<p>And the original Indo-European speakers consumed milk and dairy foods because we find words</p>
<p>for sour milk, whey, and curds.</p>
<p>The original Indo-European speakers farmed and tended crops, so some basic farming existed</p>
<p>because we find words meaning aard, which is a scratch plow, and yoke, worn by oxen</p>
<p>pulling a plow, and we find words meaning grain, furrow, and grind and pestle, which</p>
<p>are used to turn grain into flour.</p>
<p>There are also some other cultural clues indicated by the vocabulary of the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>For example, they had terms for movable wealth, which ultimately became the term for herds,</p>
<p>and they had separate terms for fixed or immovable wealth.</p>
<p>They had male-centered households, based on kin terms.</p>
<p>They believed in their own souls, and they had one or more sky gods.</p>
<p>And they had a social hierarchy, which began at the household level, and then moved up</p>
<p>to the family level, and then the clan, and then a clan chief, and then all the way to</p>
<p>the tribal level.</p>
<p>And it should also be noted that there&rsquo;s no known Indo-European word for city.</p>
<p>So based on all of this evidence, we can conclude the following.</p>
<p>These people lived between 4500 to 2500 BC.</p>
<p>They were tribal farmers and herded cattle and sheep, so they were not hunter-gatherers.</p>
<p>They had access to and collected honey from honeybees, and they drank mead.</p>
<p>They used and drove wheeled wagons.</p>
<p>They made woolen textiles, produced by weaving.</p>
<p>They plowed fields.</p>
<p>They had cows, and cows played a prominent role in their society, both in daily life</p>
<p>and religion.</p>
<p>They worshipped sky gods.</p>
<p>They lived in a temperate climate, not the Mediterranean, tropical, or desert climate.</p>
<p>They lived south or west of the Ural Mountains, which divide Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>So they lived on the European side of the Urals.</p>
<p>They did not live in the northern forested steppes of Eurasia, because those people were</p>
<p>either hunter-gatherers or basic herders without farming during this period.</p>
<p>They did not live in the Near East, Iran, or the Indian subcontinent, because those</p>
<p>areas didn&rsquo;t have horses during this period.</p>
<p>They lived in relative proximity to the Urals, because of the connections between the original</p>
<p>Uralic language and the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>And they probably lived in proximity to the Caucasus Mountains, between the Black Sea</p>
<p>and the Caspian Sea, because of some connections with the ancient languages spoken in that</p>
<p>region as well.</p>
<p>When all of those factors are combined, and we look at the archaeological record and the</p>
<p>anthropological record, this narrows the possible location of the original Indo-European</p>
<p>speaking people to the area west of the Ural Mountains and north or east of the Caucasus</p>
<p>Mountains in the steppes of modern Russia and the eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s the area immediately north of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another important key.</p>
<p>The archaeological evidence in this region confirms the existence of peoples who fit</p>
<p>the description of the Indo-European speakers that I just laid out.</p>
<p>These people were the herders of what is called the Yamnaya Horizon.</p>
<p>They were the first peoples of the steppes to create a herding economy.</p>
<p>And these were very likely the first speakers of the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>And they are thus the oldest known linguistic ancestors of English.</p>
<p>When we combine the cultural factors that I mentioned before with the archaeological</p>
<p>evidence of the people who lived in this region around this time, we start to get a more complete</p>
<p>picture of who these people were.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have determined that these people knew and used copper and silver and</p>
<p>possibly gold, but they did not use iron.</p>
<p>So that means that they were part of the so-called Bronze Age, which preceded the Iron</p>
<p>Age.</p>
<p>The linguistic and archaeological evidence also indicates that these people had warlike</p>
<p>tendencies, and that they engaged in raiding for cattle and raiding for revenge.</p>
<p>So we now have an emerging view of these original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>We can reasonably determine where and when they lived, north of the Black Sea and Caspian</p>
<p>Sea in the Eurasian steppes between 4500 BC and 2500 BC.</p>
<p>And we start to get a picture of how these people lived.</p>
<p>In the next episode, I&rsquo;m going to conclude our look at the original Indo-Europeans, the</p>
<p>speakers of English&rsquo;s oldest ancestor.</p>
<p>It will be a true history episode, as I&rsquo;m actually going to try to establish a timeline</p>
<p>from the very beginning of the Indo-Europeans to their migration throughout Europe and Central</p>
<p>Asia.</p>
<p>This is the story of the Indo-European migrations, and that will set the stage for our look at</p>
<p>the Western European branches of the Indo-European languages, specifically Greek, Latin, Celtic,</p>
<p>and the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>Those are the languages which directly influenced and led to the English language we have today.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
