    <p>The following is a conversation with Ben Askren,</p>
<p>wrestler, MMA fighter, and a brilliant,</p>
<p>opinionated, and fun personality</p>
<p>in the world of martial arts.</p>
<p>And yes, he occasionally likes to talk a little trash.</p>
<p>Given his wild online antics</p>
<p>and his boxing match with Jake Paul,</p>
<p>some people may forget just how dominant he was</p>
<p>in the sport of wrestling and in MMA for most of his career.</p>
<p>In wrestling, he is a two time NCAA Division I</p>
<p>national champion and four time finalist.</p>
<p>In mixed martial arts, he went undefeated for 10 years</p>
<p>with a record of 19 and 0 before losing to Jorge Masvidal</p>
<p>with a flying knee that caught everyone by surprise.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also into cryptocurrency, disc golf,</p>
<p>and is the cohost of Flow Wrestling Radio Live.</p>
<p>This is a Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Ben Askren.</p>
<p>Before we talk about your incredible wrestling career,</p>
<p>your MMA career, let me ask you, I have to ask you,</p>
<p>what did you think about the Jake Paul</p>
<p>versus Tyron Woodley fight?</p>
<p>Well, I thought, I mean, I&rsquo;m obviously biased.</p>
<p>I thought Tyron won.</p>
<p>I had five rounds of three.</p>
<p>And again, maybe this is my bias in the way I was seeing it.</p>
<p>I thought he was more effective with the striking</p>
<p>and he was more aggressive and Jake had more volume.</p>
<p>But that was the only thing I would give him.</p>
<p>And I guess a lot of people just didn&rsquo;t see it that way.</p>
<p>They thought he landed more, significantly more punches.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t think he really did any damage.</p>
<p>It was a split decision.</p>
<p>Split decision, yeah.</p>
<p>Were you surprised?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the thing, so the thing I said</p>
<p>when I went in to fight him, I said, we don&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s good, maybe he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>We really have no idea to this point, you know?</p>
<p>And so I knew Tyron was a lot better boxing than I was.</p>
<p>And so I thought, okay, I think it&rsquo;s a good likelihood</p>
<p>that Tyron beats him up, but there&rsquo;s a chance</p>
<p>that Jake&rsquo;s kind of good at this.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s kind of what played out is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s kind of good at it.</p>
<p>Even if you saw it the way I saw it,</p>
<p>he still was impressive in his showing</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s obviously put a lot of time into it.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not bad, we&rsquo;ll say that much.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it surprising to you that like</p>
<p>an elite level athlete, combat athlete,</p>
<p>lost to somebody who just takes it really seriously</p>
<p>but is nevertheless not elite level?</p>
<p>Hmm, but I think boxing&rsquo;s a really specific rule set.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll speak about Tyron, not myself.</p>
<p>Tyron had good striking, but obviously</p>
<p>it was his first boxing match ever.</p>
<p>And within mixed martial arts, you have the fear</p>
<p>of the takedown and the fear of the kick</p>
<p>and fear of other things to go along with the punching.</p>
<p>And so if you look at Tyron,</p>
<p>throughout his MMA career last times,</p>
<p>what set up his punches were like level change fakes</p>
<p>at a takedown, they dropped, boom,</p>
<p>and then something comes over the top, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s many more elements to worry about</p>
<p>in mixed martial arts, whereas boxing, there&rsquo;s only one.</p>
<p>It was his first fight.</p>
<p>Yes, I thought Tyron was gonna win.</p>
<p>I thought this was gonna happen.</p>
<p>But like I said, I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty evident</p>
<p>that Jake&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s not bad at boxing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pretty solid, you know?</p>
<p>He gets in there and works hard at it, I guess.</p>
<p>Out of 10 times, how many times do you think Jake wins?</p>
<p>Against Tyron?</p>
<p>Against Tyron.</p>
<p>They fight again and again and again, like iteratively.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, part of the thing is,</p>
<p>okay, so Jake&rsquo;s corner said you need a knockout</p>
<p>going into the eighth round, right?</p>
<p>So I think they thought, maybe they were trying</p>
<p>to motivate him, but I don&rsquo;t see it that way.</p>
<p>Because if they actually thought that he was winning,</p>
<p>why would they encourage him to take a dumb risk</p>
<p>when Tyron clearly has knockout power, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really stupid coaching philosophy</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>So you obviously are thinking,</p>
<p>hey, this is actually in the balance, it&rsquo;s competitive.</p>
<p>And I feel like Tyron thought maybe he was winning</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t have the urgency necessary.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s a chance he turns it up a lot.</p>
<p>Man, I would wanna watch him again before I,</p>
<p>so okay, I have this problem with my personality.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my personality, Lex.</p>
<p>I have an issue with not being able</p>
<p>to give really exact answers.</p>
<p>So I hate giving you an answer that like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like is 100% calculated.</p>
<p>So I would like to see them go once more</p>
<p>because I would like to see, hey, can Tyron,</p>
<p>because if Tyron can turn up the pace</p>
<p>and Jake can&rsquo;t handle it,</p>
<p>then I think it&rsquo;s an eight, one or nine, two, right?</p>
<p>If it goes the exact same way</p>
<p>and maybe Tyron was a close split decision,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, oh, it&rsquo;s probably gonna be close</p>
<p>every single time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re probably gonna get a five to five type of thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I feel like out of one match,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not totally indicative of what the future</p>
<p>is gonna look like.</p>
<p>I feel like Tyron would get a knockout</p>
<p>and then you would still be in the same place,</p>
<p>like not knowing what to predict.</p>
<p>Okay, so your fight with Jake Paul,</p>
<p>looking back, you had a little bit of time now.</p>
<p>How would you analyze that fight?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the fight specifically,</p>
<p>I got cracked with an overhand right,</p>
<p>so I mean, it kind of sucks.</p>
<p>I would say, and this is where everyone&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t care and everyone&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why would you do that?</p>
<p>It turns your reputation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I wanted to do it.</p>
<p>I had an enjoyable time training and in the buildup.</p>
<p>Obviously, I wasn&rsquo;t skillful enough to get the win,</p>
<p>but even despite the fact that I know what&rsquo;s gonna happen,</p>
<p>if someone asked me to do it again,</p>
<p>I probably would have done it again.</p>
<p>And so the way I was thinking about</p>
<p>when I was deciding whether to do it or not,</p>
<p>because I got the offer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, is this money, it can change my life.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna double my net worth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna add significantly and make my life easier.</p>
<p>Number two is like, when I was in high school,</p>
<p>we used to do boxing matches for free,</p>
<p>just because we thought it was fun.</p>
<p>When we didn&rsquo;t have something going on Friday night,</p>
<p>me and my buddies would get together</p>
<p>and we had some boxing goes on, basically,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d punch each other in the head.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, for something I think is enjoyable,</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re gonna pay me a whole bunch of money,</p>
<p>yeah, sure, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>Would you, do you think if you got the rematch,</p>
<p>if you did the rematch, would you,</p>
<p>what are the odds you win?</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably not very good.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s pretty good, actually,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not very good.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s probably at a low point for me,</p>
<p>because, so when I started training for that,</p>
<p>I was like 215 pounds, which is the heaviest I&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
<p>I came off my hip surgery.</p>
<p>I literally, when I said, yes, I&rsquo;ll do it,</p>
<p>I had literally started working out the week before</p>
<p>for the first time in my, since the surgery,</p>
<p>because I wasn&rsquo;t able to do anything.</p>
<p>So could I perform better?</p>
<p>Yeah, but now after watching him box Tyron,</p>
<p>like if you ask me, Ben, can you beat Tyron?</p>
<p>Probably not, but I don&rsquo;t think I can beat Tyron.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>In boxing.</p>
<p>In boxing, correct, in boxing, yeah.</p>
<p>So my chances of beating him, you know,</p>
<p>and watching that card, it&rsquo;s like, damn,</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;d kind of be fun to box someone who I know sucks,</p>
<p>who I know can beat, that&rsquo;s what would be fun, you know?</p>
<p>Because like, the training, the preparation was fun,</p>
<p>but then obviously, I got my butt kicked, that sucked.</p>
<p>You know, can I swear on this podcast?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Oh, I was gonna drop an F bomb, I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure, sorry.</p>
<p>I think that sucked, is a swear.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You could drop all of the F bombs you want.</p>
<p>So, preparation wise, do you think you were more prepared</p>
<p>for that fight, or the Jordan Burrows exhibition?</p>
<p>I mean, like, how did you approach it mentally, you know?</p>
<p>Well, the Burrows thing, I obviously, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So when I retired the first time in 2017,</p>
<p>Burrows was the only current, like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll say really elite level wrestler</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d never trained with.</p>
<p>I was really good friends with in Nebraska,</p>
<p>head of the coaching team, still am.</p>
<p>And I said, hey, I just want, I&rsquo;m gonna pay my own way.</p>
<p>I want to come down and train with Jordan,</p>
<p>because I want to see what it feels like.</p>
<p>You know, I want to get in there and mix it up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mixed it up with David Taylor and Kyle Dake.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just something about wrestling that I love.</p>
<p>And so I flew myself down there in January of 2018,</p>
<p>and I spent four days training with Jordan.</p>
<p>It was a really good time.</p>
<p>It gave me some great insight into how he thinks,</p>
<p>and you know, what a great champion he is.</p>
<p>What was it like training with him?</p>
<p>Like what, can you give some insights?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Like what the, like how hard is the live training?</p>
<p>Is it more drilling?</p>
<p>Is it technical?</p>
<p>Like how does, his, it seems like his style</p>
<p>is very different than yours.</p>
<p>So how does that match up in the room</p>
<p>in terms of like what you learn from each other,</p>
<p>that kind of thing?</p>
<p>We only went full live for one,</p>
<p>I think it was like 12 or 15 minutes ago</p>
<p>where it was just go, wrestle.</p>
<p>We did a bunch of simulated live,</p>
<p>but obviously he had, so I was a senior in college</p>
<p>and he was a freshman in Nebraska.</p>
<p>And so we, our teams had dueled each other.</p>
<p>He was obviously a lot smaller at that point in time,</p>
<p>but he had followed my career.</p>
<p>And so when I went in there, it was like,</p>
<p>hey, I know you&rsquo;re really good at this position.</p>
<p>What about this position?</p>
<p>What are you trying to do?</p>
<p>How exactly does it work?</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s wrestle there, you know?</p>
<p>And then, hey, what about this position?</p>
<p>And so we would spend 30 to 40 minutes</p>
<p>talking about that position.</p>
<p>On the ground or?</p>
<p>It was like, one was a chest wrap,</p>
<p>one was a headlock, one was, I don&rsquo;t remember,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the, we call it the lightning dump, but it&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>The lightning dump?</p>
<p>Yeah, my buddy&rsquo;s name was Lightning Luke Smith</p>
<p>in high school and he was the first person I saw do it.</p>
<p>So usually when I see someone do something,</p>
<p>then I name that move after them.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>Great name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good name.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so what I said with that is like,</p>
<p>he was still trying to be the best in the world.</p>
<p>I was just trying to go work out with Jordan Burrows</p>
<p>because I enjoy wrestling.</p>
<p>Is like someone who at that point,</p>
<p>when he has five world titles at that,</p>
<p>four or five at that point, a lot.</p>
<p>And so he said, my high school kids is like,</p>
<p>hey, this is a guy who&rsquo;s the best in the world,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s bringing someone in and saying,</p>
<p>well, how do I do this?</p>
<p>How do I do that?</p>
<p>What about this?</p>
<p>What about that?</p>
<p>And so the level of inquisitiveness he has</p>
<p>is really impressive.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s obvious why he got to the level he did</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s figuring out all these little situations.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s honestly one of the biggest things</p>
<p>I think wrestlers, a lot of wrestlers fail to do</p>
<p>as they get older.</p>
<p>Even when they get to early college age,</p>
<p>they say, this is my style.</p>
<p>This is what I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna lift and work out hard</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not gonna add anything to my game.</p>
<p>Whereas you&rsquo;ve seen many progressions</p>
<p>in Jordan Burrows game.</p>
<p>He just made his 10th world team.</p>
<p>And if you have a really keen eye,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been able to watch him change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching him since 2007.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s changed so much.</p>
<p>And obviously still maintained a world class level</p>
<p>almost the entire time.</p>
<p>When you say change, like what changed?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s got that double leg.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s no double leg anymore.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>He like his double leg for the first time</p>
<p>against Alex Deering, he hadn&rsquo;t hit it in years.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s like when people think about Jordan Burrows,</p>
<p>they think about the double leg</p>
<p>because in his early years,</p>
<p>fire, he had a great double leg, right?</p>
<p>And even so in those years, I would say</p>
<p>the biggest thing with Jordan Burrows double leg</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t his level of explosiveness,</p>
<p>it was his level of persistence.</p>
<p>He would shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot.</p>
<p>And it would last time to be from fun, creative angles</p>
<p>and on the screen, all of a sudden he&rsquo;s on you.</p>
<p>And he was just super persistent with it.</p>
<p>And I think that was probably the key.</p>
<p>And then you saw, when he came out</p>
<p>to the won the first world championship in 2011,</p>
<p>it was kind of that type of mentality.</p>
<p>And then shortly after then,</p>
<p>obviously everyone was starting to lower</p>
<p>their stance getting lower</p>
<p>and he developed a really good like</p>
<p>Mantis go behind series</p>
<p>where he would go one way the other way.</p>
<p>Then he started developing really good</p>
<p>like low single ankle pick type thing, you know?</p>
<p>And then his hand fighting got really tremendous,</p>
<p>like 15, 16, 17, his hand fighting was really good.</p>
<p>And now I just commented at the 21 trials,</p>
<p>like a few of the defensive sequences he got into,</p>
<p>it was like, holy shit,</p>
<p>like just not from an athletic standpoint,</p>
<p>from a technical standpoint,</p>
<p>the things he were doing was just tremendous.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve seen him as someone like</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s continued to reinvent themselves</p>
<p>over the course of the last 10, 12 years.</p>
<p>Especially as a junior and senior in college,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exceptionally dominant.</p>
<p>If you were to face him at the peak,</p>
<p>both of your peaks of NCAA wrestling,</p>
<p>could you beat him?</p>
<p>And if you can beat him,</p>
<p>well, of course you can beat him.</p>
<p>How do you solve the Jordan Boroughs problem?</p>
<p>Well, so from a folk style wrestling standpoint,</p>
<p>Folk style, yes.</p>
<p>Folk style.</p>
<p>So, you know, he had some competitive matches</p>
<p>his junior and senior year.</p>
<p>He had a two, one win over,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s three, two over Michael Chandler,</p>
<p>who was my teammate who&rsquo;s fighting in the UFC now.</p>
<p>He had a two and win over Tyler Caldwell.</p>
<p>So I think you can glean some insight into that.</p>
<p>You know, he got ridden,</p>
<p>he got so mad about this up on a podcast.</p>
<p>So during Corona,</p>
<p>we had to make up all kinds of bullshit to talk about.</p>
<p>And we were doing like the last 10 years best 165s.</p>
<p>And I said, Kyle Dake would ride him for over a minute.</p>
<p>He got so mad he wanted to come on the podcast the next day.</p>
<p>So hopefully he doesn&rsquo;t listen to this and be like,</p>
<p>fuck you, man, you know?</p>
<p>But, you know.</p>
<p>When was this?</p>
<p>This is during Corona.</p>
<p>Corona, last year.</p>
<p>He got mad.</p>
<p>We were talking about, we were.</p>
<p>Before the trials.</p>
<p>Yeah, correct, yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, Michael Chandler rode him for two minutes plus</p>
<p>and that was his junior year, not his senior year.</p>
<p>Sure, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s some things there.</p>
<p>I think the interesting thing would be</p>
<p>if I would have stuck around, right?</p>
<p>So I chose to go into mixed martial arts</p>
<p>after 2008, I would have been 74</p>
<p>and he would have been 74.</p>
<p>So we would have had to wrestle.</p>
<p>And then I think that the freestyle Jordan Burroughs puzzle</p>
<p>is a lot more difficult to solve</p>
<p>than the folk style Jordan Burroughs puzzle.</p>
<p>And I think, I don&rsquo;t think he would,</p>
<p>I think he would acknowledge that he&rsquo;s much better</p>
<p>at freestyle than he was at folk style.</p>
<p>You know, although he was very good, he&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>This is like raw speed explosiveness.</p>
<p>Present a problem to you.</p>
<p>Well, so he was never, I mean, he didn&rsquo;t really excel</p>
<p>on the mat in kind of either style.</p>
<p>In freestyle, he has got some good lace transitions,</p>
<p>but in folk style, like his whole,</p>
<p>like in his entire college career,</p>
<p>I think he has like 10 pins, which is almost nothing,</p>
<p>you know, so he was gaining no value off the top position.</p>
<p>He was good enough on most people to get off bottom</p>
<p>without it being an issue, but it wasn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, this is an area where we really have</p>
<p>to be careful, there&rsquo;s a lot of things here.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just, he wasn&rsquo;t gaining value there.</p>
<p>Whereas in freestyle, he, I don&rsquo;t wanna say never,</p>
<p>but the amount of times he gets turned is incredibly rare,</p>
<p>very, very rare, and he does have like lace transitions,</p>
<p>so he gets a lot of points there.</p>
<p>So, and obviously freestyle is,</p>
<p>it can be geared way more in the neutral position, right?</p>
<p>Where we&rsquo;re only doing takedowns, so yeah.</p>
<p>Were you surprised that he lost to Dake in the trials,</p>
<p>to Kyle Dake?</p>
<p>Oh, Kyle&rsquo;s so, so, he&rsquo;s so good, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think, I think his performance at the Olympics</p>
<p>was, his loss then was shocking to,</p>
<p>I mean, we understand it happened to Kyle Dake, you know?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been a guy who&rsquo;s competed with Jordan Burrows forever,</p>
<p>and obviously he was on the losing side for a while,</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s on the winning side.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of people thought it was a coin flip,</p>
<p>and I think actually Kyle Dake made it feel like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a coin flip.</p>
<p>Now, to me, it feels like Kyle Dake isn&rsquo;t gonna win</p>
<p>that match significantly more times than he isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>is what it feels like.</p>
<p>Yeah, I forgot which trials it was.</p>
<p>Was it four years ago, where Kyle Dake threw him?</p>
<p>Like he, he, you saw inklings of like,</p>
<p>oh wow, there might be eventually a changing of the guard.</p>
<p>Yeah, so at 13, Kyle came out and he had the one throw,</p>
<p>but then he lost one of the matches decisively,</p>
<p>and then he was hurt in 14, and in 16,</p>
<p>Kyle Dake actually went up to 86 kilograms,</p>
<p>so actually in 16, at the trials we had,</p>
<p>so Jake Herbert was number one seed,</p>
<p>he was a former, as Guy Russell,</p>
<p>I was a former world silver medalist.</p>
<p>So you had David Taylor, who had not made a team yet,</p>
<p>who is now a world champion, Olympic champion.</p>
<p>You had Kyle Dake in the bracket,</p>
<p>who was a two time world champion now,</p>
<p>and you had Jaden Cox in the bracket,</p>
<p>who had not made any teams yet,</p>
<p>but is now, what, a four time world medalist,</p>
<p>two time world champion.</p>
<p>So, and then obviously Jaden came out on top of that,</p>
<p>won his first Olympic medal, Olympic bronze medal.</p>
<p>So Kyle didn&rsquo;t wrestle Jordan in 16,</p>
<p>and Kyle&rsquo;s contention the whole time,</p>
<p>and they argued about this,</p>
<p>so I actually did a little bit of backstabbing.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not backstabbing.</p>
<p>And both of them, or just one of them?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t tell any of them.</p>
<p>Okay, so Jordan got mad.</p>
<p>We talked about this fake match during Corona, right?</p>
<p>We had to make up something to talk about.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously no matches.</p>
<p>So we talked about this fake match, and.</p>
<p>Do you stand behind that statement, by the way?</p>
<p>Listen, here&rsquo;s what I said.</p>
<p>Kyle Dake&rsquo;s a four time NCAA champion.</p>
<p>Yes, I said, you gotta pick a winner.</p>
<p>I said, Kyle Dake wins two, one</p>
<p>on a minute and six ride time,</p>
<p>which I mean, we&rsquo;re talking as close as it gets,</p>
<p>as close as it gets for Kyle Dake,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a four time NCAA champion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, we&rsquo;re talking.</p>
<p>Over Jordan Burrows.</p>
<p>In a Folkestown match.</p>
<p>The hypothetical.</p>
<p>Back in college or now?</p>
<p>Completely hypothetical.</p>
<p>Now or in college?</p>
<p>In college.</p>
<p>Both of them at their peaks at 165 pounds.</p>
<p>So completely hypothetical.</p>
<p>And so Jordan called in, he was all pissed at me</p>
<p>for picking Kyle Dake.</p>
<p>He wants to come on the next day and argue his point.</p>
<p>So I said, F that, that&rsquo;s dumb.</p>
<p>Oh, we had to pick a winner.</p>
<p>We had to do something hypothetical.</p>
<p>So then I called Kyle Dake, and I said,</p>
<p>Kyle, Jordan&rsquo;s gonna come on and argue his case</p>
<p>in the morning.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s gonna do that, why don&rsquo;t you come in</p>
<p>and argue your case?</p>
<p>So no one else knew Kyle was coming on the podcast.</p>
<p>So they both show up, and they went at it.</p>
<p>But one of the contentions Kyle had for years,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s still this rule,</p>
<p>if you win a world level medal, the following year,</p>
<p>you sit out until the very end of the American trials.</p>
<p>And they do a best two or three.</p>
<p>So every time previously that Kyle had wrestled Jordan,</p>
<p>he had to come through a tournament on Saturday.</p>
<p>Okay, probably three matches.</p>
<p>And then on Sunday, he would wrestle Jordan</p>
<p>in the best two out of three, right?</p>
<p>So his contention was, I&rsquo;m only wrestling Jordan</p>
<p>at a disadvantage because I have to compete on Saturday</p>
<p>and then competing on, which it&rsquo;s a fair argument.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>But I also see USA Wrestling&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if someone wins a world medal,</p>
<p>we are gonna reward them</p>
<p>because we want that person on the team again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy though that Kyle Dake had to wrestle,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s not wrestling bums in that division.</p>
<p>Not bums, yeah.</p>
<p>And yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how wrestlers do it.</p>
<p>Because you have to go to war like three matches</p>
<p>and then face Jordan Burrows.</p>
<p>Yeah, especially a few of those years with Dakehead,</p>
<p>the name Andrew Howe.</p>
<p>But it was a really competitive matches.</p>
<p>David Taylor had really competitive matches with him.</p>
<p>Isaiah Martinez even got in there, Deeringer.</p>
<p>So he had some really competitive matches</p>
<p>before he ever got to Jordan Burrows.</p>
<p>So I never answered your initial question was,</p>
<p>how did I feel?</p>
<p>So the Jordan Burrows match,</p>
<p>I was not in wrestling shape at all,</p>
<p>meaning wrestling&rsquo;s heavily dependent,</p>
<p>especially in neutral positions,</p>
<p>heavily dependent on timing and other things.</p>
<p>I was wrestling very, very minimally</p>
<p>because I started fighting again.</p>
<p>So like my athletic shape was great,</p>
<p>but it was mainly for fighting, I wasn&rsquo;t wrestling.</p>
<p>So I think they were actually trying to do Burrows,</p>
<p>Dake at the Beat the Streets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the biggest fundraiser in wrestling</p>
<p>every single year.</p>
<p>In New York?</p>
<p>In New York City.</p>
<p>They usually raise like a million dollars.</p>
<p>They started all these programs in New York City to get,</p>
<p>which I really wonder what they&rsquo;re doing with the money now</p>
<p>because they probably can&rsquo;t have the kids wrestling</p>
<p>because New York&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>I think New York figures out a way</p>
<p>what to do with the money.</p>
<p>Hence Michael Malice complaining that they&rsquo;re corrupt</p>
<p>and all that.</p>
<p>But it goes to the Beat the Streets organization</p>
<p>who then starts the clubs in New York.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what to do with the money.</p>
<p>Anyway, so I was called like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>two weeks before the event and said,</p>
<p>hey, someone was supposed to wrestle Jordan Burrows.</p>
<p>It fell out.</p>
<p>Would you wrestle him?</p>
<p>I said, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, they said,</p>
<p>I trained with them for four days the year before.</p>
<p>I had a pretty good idea how the match was going to go.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t going to go so well for me,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, okay, you&rsquo;re missing a main event.</p>
<p>I can bring, because of where I&rsquo;m at right now in my life,</p>
<p>I can bring a lot of attention to wrestling.</p>
<p>I can help you guys raise a bunch of money</p>
<p>for Beat the Streets.</p>
<p>My goal is I think I thought I could get one take down</p>
<p>or turn on him was kind of my goal for the match.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get there.</p>
<p>He went kind of hard.</p>
<p>He went hard?</p>
<p>Yeah, that asshole didn&rsquo;t give me a point.</p>
<p>Yeah, that.</p>
<p>I said, this is bullshit, Jordan.</p>
<p>I told him during the match, like, this is bullshit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fucking going too hard right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a wrestler.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a wrestler anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fighter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming in here.</p>
<p>So yeah, so I had a really good idea.</p>
<p>I mean, we wrestled together.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;ll probably get mad</p>
<p>because I think in the live go,</p>
<p>we did like the 12 or 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I think I actually scored a take down in that, I believe.</p>
<p>Maybe, or maybe it was a turn.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll probably say, no, I didn&rsquo;t, but whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I knew what was going to happen.</p>
<p>I knew what the outcome was going to be.</p>
<p>I knew I could probably, I was hoping I could stay competitive</p>
<p>and maybe, you know, lose like 10, two or something.</p>
<p>Like, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s walk back.</p>
<p>Cause I think I originally brought it up</p>
<p>in terms of how prepared were you against Jake Paul</p>
<p>versus Jordan Burrows.</p>
<p>So did you prepare for Jake, cardio wise?</p>
<p>Yeah, I worked hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did.</p>
<p>But it was, I told you, I started training for my,</p>
<p>I mean, once I had my hip surgery,</p>
<p>they said, you know, for the first six weeks,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even walk.</p>
<p>And it was hard for me to listen to them</p>
<p>cause by week four and a half, five,</p>
<p>I was feeling pretty good.</p>
<p>I want to get rid of my crutches.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like, you know what?</p>
<p>This is for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>And if you get the,</p>
<p>so if you get the real hip replacement,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no wrestling, there&rsquo;s no nothing, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the next step.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take this serious.</p>
<p>So I do my crutches for six weeks.</p>
<p>The next six weeks, it&rsquo;s still like really low weight bearing.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t necessarily do anything, you know?</p>
<p>So then I get done with the three months,</p>
<p>which is like January and I&rsquo;m like, okay,</p>
<p>I should start working out.</p>
<p>So I started riding a bike a little bit and then, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now I&rsquo;m fat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking fat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get in better shape</p>
<p>cause I haven&rsquo;t been able to do anything.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually start working out.</p>
<p>And, and then that happened, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, okay, well now I got three months</p>
<p>and it gives me a good reason to get back in shape.</p>
<p>And, you know, I knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to be a full time boxer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, how do I put a boxing camp together?</p>
<p>So I found, you know, I had my old teammate, Mike Rhodes.</p>
<p>He came up and kind of lived with me ish kind of thing</p>
<p>for three months.</p>
<p>I found a couple of his guy canine out of Michigan.</p>
<p>He came over three weeks.</p>
<p>He was great.</p>
<p>I went to Freddie Roach for a week.</p>
<p>So I kind of like, you know,</p>
<p>try to get as many good as ideas as I could.</p>
<p>And my thought was like, okay, well if this dude sucks,</p>
<p>I can just be tough and, you know, block a few punches,</p>
<p>get him tired and then beat him up.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s probably not much of my do about</p>
<p>in the next three months.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m, I was never good at boxing in the first place.</p>
<p>All of my standup in mixed martial arts was predicated on</p>
<p>how do I get through the two or three punches</p>
<p>that are gonna come at me in the time I need</p>
<p>to get a hold of them.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s all, you only have to make two</p>
<p>or three of them miss.</p>
<p>And then boom, you&rsquo;re on top of them, at least for me.</p>
<p>That was all my striking was predicated on.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t about, hey, I&rsquo;m gonna do damage on the feet</p>
<p>in order to make something else happen.</p>
<p>It was like, how do I clear this barrier,</p>
<p>get a hold of you.</p>
<p>And if you, I actually did the math one time.</p>
<p>I think I got a takedown.</p>
<p>If you include the knockout round against Masvidal,</p>
<p>I got a takedown in every round except two.</p>
<p>So it was like, it was like 53 out of 55 rounds in MMA,</p>
<p>I got a takedown.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Somewhere, somewhere in there.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re hunting the takedown once you, once.</p>
<p>Right away.</p>
<p>Once you get your hands on them, you get the takedown.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But the incredible thing about you,</p>
<p>I just recently talked, spent a couple of days</p>
<p>with Jimmy Pedro.</p>
<p>And he talked about his guys and just champions in general</p>
<p>hating to lose more than they love winning.</p>
<p>And the way you talked about losing,</p>
<p>you lost very few times in your career,</p>
<p>like later you were dominating both wrestling and MMA.</p>
<p>But the way you took these losses against people</p>
<p>that are, I don&rsquo;t know, below elite level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>I was gonna get pissy, but it&rsquo;s completely fair.</p>
<p>I thought he was a bum too.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not what I meant.</p>
<p>I was in trouble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay, no, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>No, no, no, but like what,</p>
<p>can you explain the psychology behind that?</p>
<p>Like what, is there a system behind this?</p>
<p>Is there a philosophy behind this?</p>
<p>Well, I wasn&rsquo;t very good in the beginning.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where it all starts from.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t start getting good until the age of like 13.</p>
<p>I started at five.</p>
<p>I probably started competing more at age 10, 11.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t really get good until 13.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still at 13.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to get great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting better, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty good.</p>
<p>So I actually have,</p>
<p>I have written this book on sports psych,</p>
<p>but I got someone to write it for me kind of thing.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;ve had this philosophy for years</p>
<p>that there has to be this balance between two things, right?</p>
<p>So on the one hand, in this category,</p>
<p>on the one hand you have hating to lose.</p>
<p>A great champion has to hate to lose, like you said, right?</p>
<p>But on this other hand,</p>
<p>you have to have someone who seeks out challenges, right?</p>
<p>Cause if you don&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never gonna reach your full potential either.</p>
<p>And so you have to balance these two balls</p>
<p>at the same time, right?</p>
<p>And so like for me, I always,</p>
<p>and this is maybe cause I wasn&rsquo;t good,</p>
<p>but I was always like,</p>
<p>let me go find the best people to wrestle all the time.</p>
<p>Let me go find, I would like literally,</p>
<p>like seventh, eighth grade</p>
<p>when I was starting to get better,</p>
<p>it was like, and there&rsquo;s no internet.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s no one was using the internet.</p>
<p>It was like a wrestling magazine.</p>
<p>And like, hey dad, there&rsquo;s a tournament here.</p>
<p>I think that, are the kids gonna be there?</p>
<p>Can you take me two hours across the state today, please?</p>
<p>You would wrestle like in competition against them.</p>
<p>In competition.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, in competition.</p>
<p>Hey, I heard there&rsquo;s this tournament.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the magazine, this is this tournament.</p>
<p>Hey dad, will you take me over there tomorrow?</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t trying to win.</p>
<p>You were trying to get the experience.</p>
<p>I was trying to wrestle the best guys.</p>
<p>Maybe I win, maybe I lose.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, when you do a competition,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no guarantee of a winner or a loss.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just doing competition, right?</p>
<p>So I wanted to go,</p>
<p>I wanted to challenge myself against the best guys</p>
<p>of which I thought maybe I could come out on top, right?</p>
<p>So like eighth grade year, I won way way,</p>
<p>I probably lost a handful of times</p>
<p>in the state of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>It was probably really, really minimal</p>
<p>the amount of times I lost, you know?</p>
<p>But it was just about getting the challenge.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, some kids, and not kids in my club,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll push them very hard on this,</p>
<p>are scared of challenging themselves.</p>
<p>They like being the big fish in the small pond.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not willing to go say,</p>
<p>I want to go get that guy, and I want to get that guy,</p>
<p>and I want to get that guy.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s like, so I think that&rsquo;s part of it for me</p>
<p>is like, I always just loved to challenge.</p>
<p>I enjoyed competing thoroughly, right?</p>
<p>And I understood from a young age,</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t a good, losing is a part of it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not always going to win.</p>
<p>And that was kind of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, sometimes, you know,</p>
<p>and for my MMA career, I never planned it to go that way,</p>
<p>but yeah, I didn&rsquo;t lose for nine years.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s pretty rare.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t plan for that to happen.</p>
<p>That was just what happened, you know?</p>
<p>Okay, but you also didn&rsquo;t lose</p>
<p>like the second part of your college career.</p>
<p>My 87, I lost, I won my last 87 matches.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that didn&rsquo;t come along with the hatred of losing?</p>
<p>You just.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like losing, I still don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you seem to, okay, but you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t seem, you seem to kind of shrug it off</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>
<p>Okay, so like with, specifically with these two instances</p>
<p>that you bring up.</p>
<p>With the Masvidal, it feels definitely, so, okay.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s go deep, let&rsquo;s go deep.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So the Masvidal one, it feels different,</p>
<p>because I had.</p>
<p>So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, for people who don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Masvidal loss was your first loss.</p>
<p>First loss.</p>
<p>In MMA.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a dramatic loss.</p>
<p>Very dramatic.</p>
<p>And there was this kind of buildup as you were potentially</p>
<p>one of the greats of all time coming into this fight.</p>
<p>And so, this pressure, all of that.</p>
<p>So the, no, I mean, I was thoroughly enjoying it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel the pressure.</p>
<p>So the Masvidal fight is, he got one fucking move on me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he beat me.</p>
<p>And if we do that again, I think I win.</p>
<p>At that point in my life, for sure, I think I win</p>
<p>way, way, way more times than I lose.</p>
<p>He knew that too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t want to sound the bout agreement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I had to taunt him and why he got so mad,</p>
<p>because I had to continue to taunt him</p>
<p>in order to get him to sign, right?</p>
<p>So that one hurt because, as people don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>my MMA career, I&rsquo;ll just go through it fast.</p>
<p>I did three fights in like smaller leagues.</p>
<p>I got signed by Bellator.</p>
<p>I was undefeated for three and a half years.</p>
<p>I was nine and oh.</p>
<p>When I got done with that in 2012, 2013,</p>
<p>I, at that point in my head,</p>
<p>I was just going to transition to the UFC</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where you go.</p>
<p>I was ranked like sixth in the world.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t really had a competitive match</p>
<p>at the end of the Bellator thing.</p>
<p>And Dana White, for a reason still unknown to me,</p>
<p>we still haven&rsquo;t had this conversation.</p>
<p>I wish I could ask him, I should ask him sometime,</p>
<p>chose to refuse me any entry into the UFC.</p>
<p>He just said, I went to his office</p>
<p>and he literally said, we&rsquo;re not interested.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to make you an offer.</p>
<p>Did you, did you mention something too about him,</p>
<p>about the UFC?</p>
<p>That was a year before that.</p>
<p>That was a year before.</p>
<p>And that might play a role in it, I think.</p>
<p>So yes, what happened the year before that</p>
<p>was I called him a liar, which,</p>
<p>but listen, I&rsquo;m writing this one</p>
<p>because he said you can&rsquo;t test for drugs</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m all natural, which you can tell by my physique.</p>
<p>And I was always put off by the fact</p>
<p>that so many people cheated.</p>
<p>And I was very vocal about that.</p>
<p>And so he had made some statement like,</p>
<p>oh, well, there&rsquo;s no way you could test.</p>
<p>I said, bullshit.</p>
<p>You, very specifically, I said USADA does it</p>
<p>for all other sports worldwide, you can do it.</p>
<p>And then it was funny</p>
<p>because I hired USADA a couple of years later.</p>
<p>So I think he took some offense to that,</p>
<p>but that was like a year and almost a year and a half,</p>
<p>I think, somewhere, years later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he holds a grudge or anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I literally go to Vegas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long story.</p>
<p>You can read about it other places.</p>
<p>So I got released from a belt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like this is a negotiation.</p>
<p>I got released from my belt or contract.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m out of here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go to the UFC.</p>
<p>I go to Vegas, and then I was told,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s no offer for you.</p>
<p>Tough shit, you know?</p>
<p>So then I ended up signing with one championship.</p>
<p>I spent, what, three and a half years there.</p>
<p>I won the belt in my second fight</p>
<p>and retained the title the entire time.</p>
<p>And then I just, I think.</p>
<p>Again, dominating people.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t have a competitive fight.</p>
<p>And so I retired 18 and 0.</p>
<p>Never, never, and for someone who loves a challenge,</p>
<p>never getting to really challenge myself</p>
<p>was incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>And I left the door open.</p>
<p>I said, if I ever get the chance</p>
<p>to prove I&rsquo;m the best in the world,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to come back.</p>
<p>So somehow, a year later, I get traded.</p>
<p>Trades have never happened,</p>
<p>and this is the one and only trade ever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been retired for a year.</p>
<p>I got traded.</p>
<p>I get to come back.</p>
<p>I fight Robbie Lawler, the first fight.</p>
<p>I win.</p>
<p>And then essentially, they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>okay, if you fight, if you beat George,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get the title shot against Marty.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, this is what I&rsquo;ve been working for</p>
<p>the entire, I&rsquo;ve been trying to prove</p>
<p>I was the best fighter in the world</p>
<p>for the last 10 years,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve not been afforded this opportunity.</p>
<p>So when I lost to George, that was hard,</p>
<p>because it was something that I had waited for</p>
<p>for a really, really long time.</p>
<p>It was something that I thought I could compete for,</p>
<p>but I never got the opportunity to do,</p>
<p>so that one was hard.</p>
<p>At the same time, from just the competitive logistically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, he got me with one move.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like he beat my ass for 15 minutes,</p>
<p>and I got beat a bunch of different ways.</p>
<p>So that was like, fuck, if I get it again,</p>
<p>I could have done it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not gonna let me have it again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like wrestling where you could go</p>
<p>the next year or the next week or whatever.</p>
<p>You lose at Big Ten,</p>
<p>you go to nationals two weeks later.</p>
<p>Does that loss change you in any way, your psychology?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first loss.</p>
<p>I mean, had I had a longer MMA career post that,</p>
<p>there definitely would have been a lot of time spent</p>
<p>getting better at the entry point to the takedown, right?</p>
<p>Which I already spent time there,</p>
<p>and I hate making excuses, but yeah, the hip,</p>
<p>the hinging of my hip, what I couldn&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>was preventing me from doing some things,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s why, if you look at the fight,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bent over as I go for the double leg.</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>So what happened for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>you went in for a double leg, and he went.</p>
<p>Flying knee.</p>
<p>He did a flying knee, and it caught you well.</p>
<p>Specifically the way he did that knee</p>
<p>was kind of different than the way</p>
<p>anyone had thrown flying knees before.</p>
<p>Most people go more just from a stand straight vertical,</p>
<p>whereas he took a few like running steps</p>
<p>and went more, you know,</p>
<p>the trajectory of the angle was different.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s kind of probably why it caught,</p>
<p>you know, I think a lot of things in combat,</p>
<p>well, probably everything,</p>
<p>but I focus specifically on combat,</p>
<p>happen subconsciously.</p>
<p>Like our brain is reading what&rsquo;s coming at us,</p>
<p>and lots of times it&rsquo;s stuff we&rsquo;ve seen before</p>
<p>so we can judge how to move correctly.</p>
<p>And you misread because it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t seen before.</p>
<p>Had not seen him come at that specific angle, yeah.</p>
<p>So that loss was really hard.</p>
<p>With the Burroughs one, I told you,</p>
<p>I knew I was gonna lose.</p>
<p>So it was like, whatever, you know?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking this because I want to put</p>
<p>the sport of wrestling out there in a big way.</p>
<p>I wanna help them raise a lot of money.</p>
<p>We sold at Madison Square Garden,</p>
<p>Hulu Theater, and we raised a whole bunch of money.</p>
<p>So my goals were accomplished.</p>
<p>Jake Paul fight, I took it because</p>
<p>they paid me a whole bunch of money,</p>
<p>and I thought it was gonna be fun.</p>
<p>Did I have any illusion I was a great boxer?</p>
<p>No illusions whatsoever.</p>
<p>Would I have preferred to win?</p>
<p>Absolutely, but like I told everyone,</p>
<p>whether I win or lose on Saturday night,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be back coaching wrestling on Monday,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what I enjoy doing,</p>
<p>and I was back coaching wrestling on Monday.</p>
<p>And once I&rsquo;m out, these middle school kids</p>
<p>give me a little bit of shit about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>But where were you in terms of your shape</p>
<p>and how you felt in the Mazodal fight?</p>
<p>Would you say you&rsquo;re on the,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a difficult question to ask</p>
<p>of a world class athlete, but like,</p>
<p>were you past peak?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I don&rsquo;t know why guys like to lie about that.</p>
<p>I mean, the peak for me was really evidently</p>
<p>in my late 20s, and maybe they are all fueled</p>
<p>by extra supplements, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But for me, that was evident.</p>
<p>But you get this, so you get this crosshair</p>
<p>where if you&rsquo;re smart, like I mentioned John Burrows was,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still gaining wisdom, you&rsquo;re gaining strategy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gaining a lot of things, right?</p>
<p>And so while your physicality may go down,</p>
<p>your overall skill level still may be rising,</p>
<p>especially in MMA because people usually start later</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gaining wisdom, strategy,</p>
<p>all of the, maybe more tools in their toolbox, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting all these things.</p>
<p>So their actual competitive peak,</p>
<p>despite their athletic peak going down,</p>
<p>might still be a few years past that, right?</p>
<p>Because these things are crossing.</p>
<p>No, so I felt I was great.</p>
<p>Obviously the hip was an issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because I knew I had a lot of pain here,</p>
<p>and I knew it was because of this.</p>
<p>And it was like, okay, whenever I&rsquo;m done,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just get it taken care of, whatever.</p>
<p>But every time I train, I have pain kind of like</p>
<p>all up my back, and the day after the surgery,</p>
<p>I woke up and there was no pain on the right side of my,</p>
<p>the surgery was on the left side.</p>
<p>There was no pain on the right side of my back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s fucking weird.</p>
<p>Like every morning I wake up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of pain there, you know?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, well I&rsquo;m on pain pills.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll come back tomorrow.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;d never been back since my hip surgery.</p>
<p>So it was weird, because it was like this,</p>
<p>I thought this was affecting this,</p>
<p>but it was affecting all the way across my whole back.</p>
<p>So if I get to get a new hip, honestly,</p>
<p>if I, I don&rsquo;t know if this is gonna change</p>
<p>the competitive outcome whatsoever.</p>
<p>If I had known how good the hip replacement was gonna be,</p>
<p>I would have done it the second I retired</p>
<p>from one championship in November of 2017.</p>
<p>I would have had my hip surgery scheduled for December 1.</p>
<p>Just from a lifestyle standpoint,</p>
<p>I could only sleep in one position.</p>
<p>There was a lot of things I couldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>I was in a lot of pain.</p>
<p>So I would have done that a lot earlier.</p>
<p>But no, from an athletic point, I was ready.</p>
<p>This shit goes wrong sometimes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to ask this, but you know,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan, me, had a sense about you similar to like Fedor,</p>
<p>that you are potentially one of the greatest ever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Does it hurt that you&rsquo;re not in the discussion now</p>
<p>of being in the top 10 of all time?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t prove it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t deserve it.</p>
<p>Biera, I mean.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t prove it.</p>
<p>I mean, and so it&rsquo;s like, had I somehow gotten</p>
<p>to convince Dana White, we go and convince him in 2013</p>
<p>to make me an offer, and I didn&rsquo;t even need a good offer.</p>
<p>I just needed any offer.</p>
<p>Had I gotten the offer then,</p>
<p>maybe the outcome&rsquo;s different, right?</p>
<p>But given, I would never expect anyone</p>
<p>to think of me that way.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t prove it.</p>
<p>I know what I was, and I&rsquo;m good with that.</p>
<p>And yeah, other people never got to see that.</p>
<p>Do you think, well, you can&rsquo;t know fully, right?</p>
<p>Do you think if you went to the UFC at that time</p>
<p>instead of one championship?</p>
<p>I think I would have had a lot of success.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s obviously certain guys,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of guys I&rsquo;ve trained with</p>
<p>that I had a lot of really good results against.</p>
<p>And obviously, Tyron was a champion for a long time there.</p>
<p>So I was around, Tyron was a champion,</p>
<p>Anthony was a champion at lightweight.</p>
<p>I was, you know, same gym as him,</p>
<p>and we had a lot of people coming through.</p>
<p>Yeah, I.</p>
<p>Would you face Tyron?</p>
<p>Would I have fought him?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I mean, so he was still the champion when I came into the UFC</p>
<p>and we said, no, we&rsquo;re not gonna fight.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Hey, so he can&rsquo;t change history, right?</p>
<p>So once something happens,</p>
<p>you gotta accept for what it is.</p>
<p>And move forward and obviously hope you can continue</p>
<p>to keep accomplishing great things,</p>
<p>which for me, obviously my athletic career is over.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s gonna be through my wrestling academies</p>
<p>and you know, who knows what else I get into.</p>
<p>You might do exhibition matches</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff, right?</p>
<p>Says who?</p>
<p>Wrestling and stuff, no?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my thing with the wrestling matches is like,</p>
<p>just for fun, if you said, hey Ben, just for fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Would you love to go wrestle someone?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would, I would, right?</p>
<p>I love wrestling, I get in there.</p>
<p>I love, you know, I love like,</p>
<p>so one of my guys has gotten to be pretty good.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in college, he got in Keegan O&rsquo;Toole.</p>
<p>He just won a junior world title this year.</p>
<p>And so when I&rsquo;m doing private lessons,</p>
<p>I have such think about the development of the athletes.</p>
<p>Sometimes I can wrestle hard, but most of the time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m just gonna help them</p>
<p>with whatever they need help with.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still wrestling and it&rsquo;s fun, but it&rsquo;s helping them.</p>
<p>You know, for like, Keegan comes back this summer</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s training for the junior world title.</p>
<p>So to be able to just shake hands sometimes and say like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try to kick your ass.</p>
<p>Should you try to kick my ass?</p>
<p>You know, like just to go, like.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a good feeling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much fun.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t get to do that very much.</p>
<p>So if you said, Ben, would you love to do some matches?</p>
<p>And the answer is yeah.</p>
<p>The problem, unfortunately for me,</p>
<p>and maybe you could talk me off a ledge here,</p>
<p>is like, because of where I&rsquo;ve gotten to in my career,</p>
<p>if I choose to do a wrestling match,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna, people are gonna be really excited about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna blow up and it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>I just want to wrestle just to wrestle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather just like go in a room</p>
<p>where no one can watch and just wrestle.</p>
<p>I just enjoy it.</p>
<p>Well, you could also wrestle.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s different kinds of wrestling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s wrestling where there&rsquo;s an event</p>
<p>and like, you know, there&rsquo;s a buildup and then an announcement.</p>
<p>And you can also do like a Khabib style,</p>
<p>like in the room, there&rsquo;s cameras</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of going, it&rsquo;s like the.</p>
<p>Wait, Khabib does that?</p>
<p>No, in.</p>
<p>Marcelo does that.</p>
<p>He whooped my ass a few times.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen Khabib in some videos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like set up, it&rsquo;s just people going hard</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s more fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, and it&rsquo;s also more like</p>
<p>presenting the beauty of the sport, you know?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And like, and there&rsquo;s no winning or losing really</p>
<p>in that context.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re always joking around a little bit,</p>
<p>even when you&rsquo;re going super hard.</p>
<p>So I feel like, especially in the modern day</p>
<p>with the internet, that&rsquo;s a compelling way to do.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve thought about,</p>
<p>this is the one thing I&rsquo;ve thought about doing.</p>
<p>Cause I told you about my buddy was the content thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Rockfin.</p>
<p>Thought about doing, you know,</p>
<p>the old really famous Gracie challenge.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ve thought about doing the aspirin challenge.</p>
<p>You wanna hear my rule set?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m gonna do this.</p>
<p>People are gonna show up to your, like in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>I have to select you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with a thousand bucks, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay, 30 minutes.</p>
<p>You pin me or I pin you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>No points, no nothing.</p>
<p>We just wrestle.</p>
<p>Camera, that&rsquo;s it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s camera in the room.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a referee</p>
<p>cause we don&rsquo;t want there to be contention over the pin.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Just one pin.</p>
<p>30 minutes, 30 minutes, okay?</p>
<p>If I pin you, you don&rsquo;t get shit, you go home, right?</p>
<p>Every person I pin, it goes up by a thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Two thousand, three thousand, four thousand, five thousand</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>If you make it the distance</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t pin you and you don&rsquo;t pin me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pay for your travel and give you 500 bucks, right?</p>
<p>Just a consolation prize for showing up.</p>
<p>If you pin me, you get whatever the jackpot is.</p>
<p>Wait, who&rsquo;s adding to the jackpot?</p>
<p>I am, it&rsquo;s my money.</p>
<p>My money.</p>
<p>But then what&rsquo;s the incentive to keep winning for you?</p>
<p>Cause the jackpot.</p>
<p>Well, cause obviously I would put the content somewhere</p>
<p>where people would watch it, right?</p>
<p>Oh, so you&rsquo;re gonna make money.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;d make money that way.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not exponentially growing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going up by like.</p>
<p>Yeah, I really think there&rsquo;s probably only a couple people</p>
<p>that could pin me.</p>
<p>So I would either just not choose those people</p>
<p>or wait till I get a really large audience</p>
<p>and people get really excited</p>
<p>and in that case, I&rsquo;m making a lot of money.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What do you think, how many matches would go with you,</p>
<p>like Khaldech shows up?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he could pin me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean like, so Jordan Burrows could beat me,</p>
<p>but he can&rsquo;t pin me.</p>
<p>He was never a pinner.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He ain&rsquo;t gonna pin me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only a few people who have the skill level</p>
<p>to do so, right?</p>
<p>It takes a lot.</p>
<p>Cause that was, so pinning was one of my specialties.</p>
<p>I had the fourth most of all time</p>
<p>and I won the pinning award the last two years.</p>
<p>So you think you can be done on points and just pin them?</p>
<p>This is actually one of the issues I have with</p>
<p>Jiu Jitsu and the point system and the Eddie Bravo thing.</p>
<p>I actually think Eddie Bravo thing is kind of,</p>
<p>people get so mad at me.</p>
<p>Sorry, Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>And you want me to tell you why it&rsquo;s bullshit?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like, if Jordan Burrows whoops my ass</p>
<p>and the score is 16 to two, but he can&rsquo;t pin me.</p>
<p>Then I get to go to overtime and get a cradle on him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably going to pin him.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m better than Jordan Burrows.</p>
<p>Nah, that ain&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>He just whooped my ass.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Like if we can go the whole, cause they do submission only.</p>
<p>So if Jordan Burrows beats me up for,</p>
<p>what is it, eight minutes, 10 minutes?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the length of an Eddie Bravo match?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Something like that, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So we go 10, me and Jordan Burrows go 10 minutes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna outscore me significantly.</p>
<p>He will not pin me, I promise you that.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So now we go to the overtime.</p>
<p>Strong words, but yeah.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t, Jordan Burrows is not gonna,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna beat me.</p>
<p>I will give you that.</p>
<p>Kyle Dake won&rsquo;t pin you either.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, they will both beat me on points very badly.</p>
<p>Now David Taylor, he might pin me</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s a very good pinner also.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll beat me very badly, they will not pin me.</p>
<p>But now we get to the overtime and we get to pick like,</p>
<p>right, so in Eddie Bravo you get a rear naked choke</p>
<p>or an armbar.</p>
<p>Okay, give me a cradle, I&rsquo;ll probably pin him.</p>
<p>Okay, a good cradle.</p>
<p>You can say cradle or maybe give them,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re probably not gonna pin me, right?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe there&rsquo;s a chance, but probably not.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s just not their specialty.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, the Eddie Bravo thing</p>
<p>is when it goes into overtime,</p>
<p>you get a dominance position on a person</p>
<p>and you get to, yeah, basically put them in a cradle.</p>
<p>This is the wrestling equivalent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you take their back or mount.</p>
<p>Maybe an armbar, yeah, like a wrestling armbar.</p>
<p>So, and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s very fair.</p>
<p>Cause if someone whoops your ass, they whoops your ass.</p>
<p>And then, you know, and so I think the reason why</p>
<p>Jiu Jitsu people accept that rule set is that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I think they know this, but would admit it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think their point scoring system adequately rewards</p>
<p>what people value.</p>
<p>So like in wrestling, we value takedowns</p>
<p>cause it gets us closer to the pin.</p>
<p>And the most valuable scoring is a near fall,</p>
<p>near to the pin, because that&rsquo;s the ultimate goal to sport.</p>
<p>Whereas in Jiu Jitsu, for example,</p>
<p>like if I were to get a takedown,</p>
<p>so like if I went to Gordon Ryan and he just didn&rsquo;t pull guard</p>
<p>I would probably get the takedown.</p>
<p>Now, if somehow he didn&rsquo;t submit me,</p>
<p>which he probably would, right?</p>
<p>But say he got, got close to like 12 submissions,</p>
<p>but somehow I slipped out of all of them.</p>
<p>Now I went to zero, like that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Like he should very clearly win</p>
<p>cause he almost submitted, you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Like there, and I, and I realized the difficulty.</p>
<p>I realized the difficulty in rewarding near submissions,</p>
<p>but that is the most valuable thing is getting close</p>
<p>to finishing the match.</p>
<p>And in most competitions, they don&rsquo;t actually reward that.</p>
<p>But okay, so this, this isn&rsquo;t about the sport.</p>
<p>This is about the Ben Askren challenge</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What, why 30 minutes?</p>
<p>Why not unlimited time?</p>
<p>Why, why go until whenever?</p>
<p>Cause then it&rsquo;s just a cardio thing.</p>
<p>Cause at some point then someone would just have to fall</p>
<p>over dead, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no more skill level involved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just who can stand up the longest.</p>
<p>You honestly don&rsquo;t think 30 minutes is a cardio thing too.</p>
<p>How do you think that&rsquo;s actually going to look?</p>
<p>How are they going against you for 30 minutes?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to be kind of boring for the most part.</p>
<p>What position are you going to be stuck in?</p>
<p>Because you, well, you can&rsquo;t, but you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t have a gigantic amount of action</p>
<p>for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>So I relate to this because some of my kids,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m teaching them wrestling, they&rsquo;re like, well,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t do that for seven minutes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, you know, like say, say if I had you do</p>
<p>hang cleans at a relatively heavy weight,</p>
<p>as hard as you could, you&rsquo;re not going to last seven minutes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to, your pace will slow down, right?</p>
<p>So my thing is like, well, your pace doesn&rsquo;t have to step</p>
<p>here because in wrestling, you&rsquo;re competing against someone.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re here at a hundred and you go to 80,</p>
<p>but they go to 70, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And then you go to 60, but they go to 40,</p>
<p>this is even better, right?</p>
<p>Because the gap is growing.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t necessarily, if we get tired, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>If they get more tired, that&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>So I think most people would know that.</p>
<p>So they would kind of slow it down.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think at 30, I mean, I&rsquo;ve wrestled 30 minute</p>
<p>goes, I&rsquo;ve wrestled hour long goes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get so tired,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to fall over in that time period.</p>
<p>But at some point, if it&rsquo;s unlimited,</p>
<p>someone will get so tired or dehydrated</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re just going to freaking fall over.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you think, what about making it exciting and dynamic?</p>
<p>You think the other person is always going to be going</p>
<p>for the pin and thereby make it dynamic.</p>
<p>Well, if they&rsquo;re working that hard,</p>
<p>then they might exhaust themselves, right?</p>
<p>And obviously then if you&rsquo;re being that dynamic,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re adding risk to yourself too,</p>
<p>because you are doing that.</p>
<p>Well, I love this.</p>
<p>This is a great idea.</p>
<p>Well, I figured I&rsquo;d rack up like 20 pins against bums,</p>
<p>or not as great people in the beginning.</p>
<p>And then I would start bringing in better people</p>
<p>because they would be enticed by $20,000,</p>
<p>the possibility to win.</p>
<p>And not much fanfare, just a camera and just local.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, in my wrestling room.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, like the Gracie Challenge.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so then maybe you have like, you know,</p>
<p>for most people, you have someone edit like the 90 seconds</p>
<p>of the most fun things that happen.</p>
<p>And then you can watch the entire 30 minutes</p>
<p>if you want to.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I think most people,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not really, really elite,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably going to pin them.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not really elite.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about.</p>
<p>This has been like fun for me to think about.</p>
<p>And obviously it plays in my skill sets</p>
<p>because my cardio is good and my pinning is good also.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>So, like you said, you weren&rsquo;t very good in your early days</p>
<p>until 13, 14.</p>
<p>What was the switch?</p>
<p>You started to dominate people in your college career.</p>
<p>You dominated.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And obviously you stopped losing at some point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, well, I would say,</p>
<p>so even when I didn&rsquo;t lose in collegiate competition,</p>
<p>I would go in the summers and try to make the world team.</p>
<p>So, I would lose some, not a lot, right?</p>
<p>Minimally.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, when I&rsquo;m five, I start playing all sports.</p>
<p>Like I know you moved to America at what age?</p>
<p>13.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, at least I don&rsquo;t know what it was for you,</p>
<p>but in America at my age,</p>
<p>you usually play like a sport every season, right?</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s what I did in the beginning.</p>
<p>I had minimal success in wrestling.</p>
<p>I was kind of chunky.</p>
<p>And then in fifth grade, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t tell you, I wanted to be better.</p>
<p>And I told my parents, and this is funny,</p>
<p>because now I look at other 11 year olds</p>
<p>and very few of them are this mature.</p>
<p>And I actually think emotional maturity</p>
<p>is kind of one of the key indicators</p>
<p>of how longterm successful someone&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>And at age 11, I said, I don&rsquo;t wanna play baseball.</p>
<p>I like baseball, but I don&rsquo;t wanna play baseball</p>
<p>because I wanna wrestle more</p>
<p>because I wanna get better at wrestling.</p>
<p>So, at age 11, I quit baseball</p>
<p>so I could wrestle in a club for March, April, and May.</p>
<p>Because that was all that existed at that point in time.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t wrestle in June, July,</p>
<p>or any of those other months.</p>
<p>What was that desire to get better?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not about winning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where it came from.</p>
<p>I just wanted to get better.</p>
<p>I wanna get better.</p>
<p>I wanna be good at this.</p>
<p>I wanna be really good at this.</p>
<p>So, when you&rsquo;re looking at kids now as a coach,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking for that.</p>
<p>Somebody who says, you know what, I kinda suck.</p>
<p>I wanna get better.</p>
<p>And I wanna try to also inspire that.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, I think as a coach,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably my biggest job is to get a kid</p>
<p>and get them to believe I can do this.</p>
<p>Because if I can do this, well, I can do that.</p>
<p>I can do that too, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many kids who, unfortunately,</p>
<p>have shitty parents or bad teachers</p>
<p>that tell them, you suck, you can&rsquo;t be anything, right?</p>
<p>So, I think my biggest goal as a coach</p>
<p>is to get someone to believe they can do it.</p>
<p>So, actually, some of the ones that believe they can do it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the most fun,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not the ones who need it the most, right?</p>
<p>The ones who think they can</p>
<p>are the ones that need me the most.</p>
<p>Because they need someone to, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know what inspired me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>At age 11, fifth grade, I quit.</p>
<p>So, then I started having more success</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m like, say, placing at the state tournament.</p>
<p>In high school.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So, sixth grade, I placed at the state,</p>
<p>the local youth state tournament, you know?</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m having more success.</p>
<p>Seventh grade was the first year</p>
<p>I won the youth state tournament.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m getting better.</p>
<p>Eighth grade, I actually feel like I got pretty good,</p>
<p>but when I went to the national tournaments,</p>
<p>I was still having really minimal success.</p>
<p>My freshman year, I decided to quit football.</p>
<p>Same reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I need to put more time into this.</p>
<p>My parents, my dad luckily got a mat in my basement.</p>
<p>So, we have a year round club,</p>
<p>and our impetus was that we didn&rsquo;t have this opportunity</p>
<p>to go to a club year round.</p>
<p>So, we had a mat in my basement.</p>
<p>I had to go find, hey, you wanna come wrestle?</p>
<p>Yeah, to find partners for myself.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;d you do?</p>
<p>Did you drill?</p>
<p>Did you live wrestle?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;d you do in that basement?</p>
<p>So, actually, I think, you&rsquo;ll enjoy this.</p>
<p>I think the start of my scrambling was</p>
<p>kind of based around that.</p>
<p>So, I got kind of,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably my freshman sophomore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of, the years are a little fuzzy, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>But probably my freshman, sophomore, junior year,</p>
<p>I found two kids who were really consistent</p>
<p>who would come out, like you would come out on,</p>
<p>he would come out on Tuesday,</p>
<p>and this dude would come out on a Wednesday, right?</p>
<p>And they would come every week,</p>
<p>and they were really consistent partners for me</p>
<p>to have in the summer.</p>
<p>But they weren&rsquo;t nearly as good as me.</p>
<p>They were way worse.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s like, okay, how do I,</p>
<p>how do I make this kind of like fun and compelling</p>
<p>for them to come back?</p>
<p>Because if I just whoop their ass,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna come back, you know?</p>
<p>So, it was like, I would let them get as close as they could,</p>
<p>and I thought they could do a takedown</p>
<p>before not getting it,</p>
<p>and then try to like escape or get out.</p>
<p>So, obviously, if I let them get really close,</p>
<p>sometimes they get it, you know?</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re enjoying it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they ever knew I was doing this, right?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>And that was kind of like the start,</p>
<p>because I had to figure my way out of bad positions,</p>
<p>because I had to try to make it entertaining for them,</p>
<p>where they still got something out of it,</p>
<p>and they wanted to come back the next week.</p>
<p>And I also got something out of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love this, yeah.</p>
<p>Because that relationship is so important,</p>
<p>with that, like, that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few drilling partners,</p>
<p>training partners that were really important to my life,</p>
<p>and I always wonder why it&rsquo;s difficult,</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s so difficult to find them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like I, if anyone&rsquo;s listening to this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a judo person in the Austin area, actually.</p>
<p>Getting the reps with people is hard.</p>
<p>Even in jiu jitsu, that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like, people want to do the fun stuff.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to really put in the work,</p>
<p>and it takes a certain kind of personality.</p>
<p>And then you also have to make it fun for the other person,</p>
<p>just like you said.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a skill mismatch,</p>
<p>but also if you have an interest mismatch,</p>
<p>in terms of the amount of drilling you want to do,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>you have to figure out ways to make it fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p>So you did.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think I did that,</p>
<p>and no one told me.</p>
<p>As I get some, I get frustrated,</p>
<p>because now we have, just in my academy,</p>
<p>we probably have 50, 60 high school kids only</p>
<p>that are year round.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re year round.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re not consistent in the summer or whatever,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>So when they don&rsquo;t have a great partner,</p>
<p>they start whining,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, you little bitches, like, you know.</p>
<p>Some days they get really mad about it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, I had no partners.</p>
<p>I had to find freaking two partners to come twice a week.</p>
<p>You guys, there&rsquo;s still 22 people in the room.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry there&rsquo;s not the perfect partner for you,</p>
<p>but like, go work out with that dude.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what was the switch, the change?</p>
<p>Was it gradual, or?</p>
<p>Gradual.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I was in ninth grade.</p>
<p>I quit football, because I wanted to get really serious.</p>
<p>What position in football were you in?</p>
<p>I was actually a nose tackle.</p>
<p>But at that point, so, okay,</p>
<p>so I was also, the other thing I kind of left out here,</p>
<p>I was really fat growing up.</p>
<p>In sixth grade, I also decided, okay, I&rsquo;m really fat,</p>
<p>and if I want to be a competitive wrestler,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t be fat, because weight matters.</p>
<p>I went from 130 pounds to 100 pounds in sixth grade.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So by the time I was a freshman, I was 119.</p>
<p>So I still wasn&rsquo;t as heavy as I was in sixth grade.</p>
<p>So I was pretty small, too,</p>
<p>but I was also slow, unfortunately.</p>
<p>So they put me a nose tackle.</p>
<p>I liked the competitiveness, so I was decent at it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where you wrestled, 119?</p>
<p>My freshman year, yeah.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>So yeah, so then I started having a lot of success</p>
<p>state wise, but not nationally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my national success,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t come to my junior year in high school.</p>
<p>But yeah, I was grinding and getting better the whole time.</p>
<p>And then senior year, I started having a lot of success</p>
<p>nationally, and I got recruited.</p>
<p>But then even when my freshman year of college,</p>
<p>this is where I loved competing, I would go every weekend.</p>
<p>Because I knew, if you take the emotions out of competition,</p>
<p>all it is is seeing your failures, acknowledging them,</p>
<p>and then figuring out what you need to work on.</p>
<p>If we take all the emotion out of it, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>So I wrestled 50 matches as a redshirt freshman,</p>
<p>which is incredibly rare.</p>
<p>I had 10 losses.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, and like to not so great guys, you know?</p>
<p>So like my skill level still at that point</p>
<p>was not that great.</p>
<p>And then the next year I came out</p>
<p>and I made it into the finals.</p>
<p>So my, I made a gigantic jump in that redshirt year</p>
<p>to the real freshman year.</p>
<p>So a few questions.</p>
<p>Where did the funk style of wrestling,</p>
<p>the creative stuff get developed, at which stage?</p>
<p>So I think like looking retroactively,</p>
<p>there was no intention to start when I was in high school</p>
<p>with those kids, but I think that&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>well, what was happening, right?</p>
<p>So what I would really say is,</p>
<p>I had one influential coach my redshirt year of college</p>
<p>named Mike Ironman, great guy.</p>
<p>But then the second thing was, it was just out of necessity.</p>
<p>I had this burning desire to be the best.</p>
<p>And when I was getting my ass kicked every day in the room,</p>
<p>cause we had, you know, Tyron was there,</p>
<p>we had All American 157, we had All American 184.</p>
<p>So I wasn&rsquo;t having a ton of success.</p>
<p>And very quickly I realized</p>
<p>from like a more traditional athletic perspective,</p>
<p>strength and speed, I couldn&rsquo;t keep up with anyone.</p>
<p>I was way worse.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, okay, fuck, how do I, how do I do this?</p>
<p>You know, I want to do this.</p>
<p>How do I do this?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be a way, you know?</p>
<p>So Mike Ironman showed me a couple of things,</p>
<p>but then it was just like this creative expansion</p>
<p>for the next, you know, say three to five years.</p>
<p>And then even now it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something, and maybe you feel this way about judo,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s like fun</p>
<p>about the way the body moves and works</p>
<p>and exploring something new and thinking about,</p>
<p>hey, wrestling&rsquo;s been happening at a relatively high level</p>
<p>for we&rsquo;ll say 80 to 90 years in America.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still new things being developed.</p>
<p>And so when you see something new,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, oh damn, like, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Or like Jason Knowles may have to win Dixie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, how did I not think of that shit?</p>
<p>Like, why did I think of that?</p>
<p>So easy, I should have thought of that, you know?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this like obsession with the sport of wrestling</p>
<p>and positions where I actually think sometimes,</p>
<p>thank God we didn&rsquo;t have smartphones</p>
<p>because I may have been distracted by my smartphone.</p>
<p>Maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t have been because I was so obsessed,</p>
<p>but maybe, but you know, some days I had,</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t finish the single leg on a specific person</p>
<p>or maybe they were finishing on me and it was like,</p>
<p>go home and I was just fucking obsessed</p>
<p>about that one position.</p>
<p>Like, okay, what am I missing here?</p>
<p>And not just accepting like that whatever the coach says</p>
<p>is the answer, but like, what am I missing?</p>
<p>What ways can my body move</p>
<p>that no one&rsquo;s told me it can move yet?</p>
<p>Where can my arms go, right?</p>
<p>Where can I do all these things?</p>
<p>And so I would just obsess about these things.</p>
<p>And then, you know, sometimes you come in the next day</p>
<p>and you say, oh, well maybe this, you know,</p>
<p>and maybe it works, maybe it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>maybe it works twice and it doesn&rsquo;t work the next time.</p>
<p>And so you kind of like have this creative process</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>that are on the cutting room floor</p>
<p>that never made it to the light</p>
<p>because you thought they&rsquo;d be good</p>
<p>and they failed and they sucked.</p>
<p>And then, you know, to the point where,</p>
<p>like my senior year,</p>
<p>I got to this point where the people,</p>
<p>then they were just figures.</p>
<p>Figures would wrestle in my head</p>
<p>about positions I was thinking about.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t tell them what to do.</p>
<p>They would just, they&rsquo;d just go in my head.</p>
<p>And then like, oh fuck, wait, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, like that just happened.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the move and then I&rsquo;d go try to practice</p>
<p>and sure enough, boom, that&rsquo;s the move.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what you have Alpha Zero playing,</p>
<p>learning chess.</p>
<p>You have, it&rsquo;s called Self Plays.</p>
<p>You have, did the figures have like a clear?</p>
<p>No faces, they were just like.</p>
<p>Did they have a human form</p>
<p>or is it just like stick figures essentially?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was not like humans.</p>
<p>It was more like stick figures.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t stick figures exactly like they were.</p>
<p>They had some volume?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was like a gray person</p>
<p>and they had, you know, three dimensions essentially</p>
<p>so I had to see how the things moved and yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, this is exactly what OpenAI and DeepMind at Google</p>
<p>are, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something called reinforcement learning</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence where you have like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done it for like sumo wrestling.</p>
<p>You have like, you have these two stick figures</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t even know how to get up at first</p>
<p>and they figure out how to stand on their two feet</p>
<p>and then they figure out how to push the other person</p>
<p>off of the pedestal.</p>
<p>Wait, so, but what about like when you look</p>
<p>at the Boston Dynamics, sometimes they have trouble</p>
<p>with like jumping and balancing and the other stuff.</p>
<p>So are they doing that same program or no?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>This, everything Boston Dynamics is doing is hard coded</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not learning the,</p>
<p>all of the sophisticated movements and strategies</p>
<p>like high level strategies and movement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all something that Boston Dynamics does not do</p>
<p>and if it does it, like the parkour stuff,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all hard coded in.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>People like project and think like these robots</p>
<p>have like discovered like how to move</p>
<p>in sophisticated ways they haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what, when you and John were talking</p>
<p>about the grappling robot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, the one thing I was obsessing about in my head</p>
<p>is that with the chess, right?</p>
<p>If a chess piece moves, right?</p>
<p>The horse can move like an L, right?</p>
<p>It can only move like an L.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it moves at two meters per second</p>
<p>or seven meters per second.</p>
<p>It can only move there, right?</p>
<p>Whereas like a single leg, I can shoot a single leg</p>
<p>with many different velocities.</p>
<p>I can shoot at different angles.</p>
<p>I can shoot with different amounts of force, right?</p>
<p>I can shoot with my head up versus my head,</p>
<p>I mean, right?</p>
<p>All these things are gonna matter.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a human being defending the single leg.</p>
<p>All of those things are gonna matter</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where human beings who wrestle</p>
<p>are calculating those things subconsciously.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re obviously not consciously calculating in their head,</p>
<p>oh, the force is coming at me at this,</p>
<p>so I need to do that, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just doing it because.</p>
<p>But see, the thing is, so you would absolutely,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing a robot that you&rsquo;re wrestling,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to constrain the speed at which it moves</p>
<p>and the power that it&rsquo;s able to deliver.</p>
<p>So that presumably, that&rsquo;ll be the limitation.</p>
<p>So then it&rsquo;ll be just the same exactly as a human.</p>
<p>But then, so if we go human, max force,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re Jordan Burrows double, max force, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the highest, that&rsquo;s the highest we get</p>
<p>and then we go down from there.</p>
<p>Even within that, it&rsquo;s like sometimes,</p>
<p>I can shoot a single leg with a maximum force of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, we&rsquo;ll just say 20 is the number, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ll shoot it at 20</p>
<p>because I feel sometimes I shoot it at 15,</p>
<p>sometimes I shoot it at 12, right?</p>
<p>Because you feel something in your opponent</p>
<p>that makes you do it differently.</p>
<p>So they would have to learn how,</p>
<p>and then all of these different things</p>
<p>and sometimes maybe I clamp a little harder.</p>
<p>So the robot would have to learn</p>
<p>all of these different incoming inputs to the system</p>
<p>and then create this reaction.</p>
<p>Oh no, no, no, 100%.</p>
<p>So this would be all continuous.</p>
<p>So unlike chess, it would not be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just chess is discrete, there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>One and then.</p>
<p>You move, it&rsquo;s a very specific set of moves.</p>
<p>Now here you would, those are all variables you control</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re continuous variables.</p>
<p>So the speed, the force, there&rsquo;s actuators,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s all these joints, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you can move.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just an optimization problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, and it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been fascinated thinking about it</p>
<p>since you guys talked about it.</p>
<p>It was a long time ago,</p>
<p>I listened to it probably three to four weeks ago</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve kind of been like obsessing about it ever since.</p>
<p>Yeah, it just changes when,</p>
<p>so unlike boxing, for example, or striking,</p>
<p>once you grab a hold of somebody,</p>
<p>it changes, you&rsquo;re now one body, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very complicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just shooting a double leg without,</p>
<p>like maybe doing like faking a double leg</p>
<p>and then shooting the double leg,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very doable with robotics,</p>
<p>but then like doing a clinch and from there,</p>
<p>doing like a Russian tie, like that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, I think that&rsquo;s way harder than people realize</p>
<p>in terms of how many things are involved,</p>
<p>like the force of the grip, the leverage you&rsquo;re providing</p>
<p>with all the different parts of the shoulder</p>
<p>and the arm and the torso, the twist,</p>
<p>how much of your weight are you allocating,</p>
<p>like leaning on the other person,</p>
<p>like taking weight off of one of your legs</p>
<p>and the other leg, all of that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the really interesting thing about humans</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re able to do all of this calculation.</p>
<p>Subconsciously. Yeah, subconsciously.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been thinking about since we,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like how many things even these high school athletes</p>
<p>who are like getting medium good</p>
<p>are subconsciously thinking about all the time</p>
<p>or not even thinking about, sorry, reacting to,</p>
<p>but then even like for me, I&rsquo;m a few orders of magnitude</p>
<p>better than some of these kids that play,</p>
<p>and so when I go like super hard,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I can feel their weight</p>
<p>moving the wrong direction,</p>
<p>and so for me to off balance them or trip them or whatever</p>
<p>is kind of easy sometimes, you know,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not feeling it the right way, right,</p>
<p>or their timing&rsquo;s just a little bit off</p>
<p>or the way they&rsquo;re grabbing the hip,</p>
<p>maybe they should be up a little higher, right,</p>
<p>these really small things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s all easy to take advantage of</p>
<p>for a robot, it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s so many things.</p>
<p>The big problem is ethically,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many people are willing to train</p>
<p>with a robot because you&rsquo;re gonna get hurt.</p>
<p>Well, couldn&rsquo;t you make a robot train as a robot or no?</p>
<p>Yes, but then it&rsquo;s expensive.</p>
<p>So, because they&rsquo;re gonna get.</p>
<p>Put the padding on that thing.</p>
<p>I know, but then it&rsquo;s not, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, then you&rsquo;re not capturing the full.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you put like some rubber coating on them,</p>
<p>you know, something for that effect?</p>
<p>You could, I mean, you could, you could.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re talking about robots that are,</p>
<p>these are humanoid robots,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re talking about $500,000 million robots.</p>
<p>So, you would have to be motivated to spend a lot of money</p>
<p>because you have to have them wrestle for like a lot.</p>
<p>To get better.</p>
<p>Yeah, to get better.</p>
<p>And then, the open question is how long does it take</p>
<p>to get good enough to be a human?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we understand, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you understand how hard wrestling is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, is it a really hard problem?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s harder, chess or wrestling?</p>
<p>Wrestling, by far.</p>
<p>Not even close.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, yeah, that&rsquo;s the sense I have.</p>
<p>So, because there&rsquo;s an infinite amount of moves, right?</p>
<p>And possibilities, so once I shoot the same leg,</p>
<p>now you have X amount of choices.</p>
<p>Once you make your choice, now I have a choice,</p>
<p>X amount of choices.</p>
<p>Now you have X amount of choices on the defense,</p>
<p>and we can just keep going back and forth, right?</p>
<p>And this number becomes.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the same happens with chess.</p>
<p>Correct, but then in wrestling,</p>
<p>you have to make these movements very instantaneously,</p>
<p>right, because if I shoot a single leg,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna wait and say, what&rsquo;s your defense?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, you have to be instantaneously.</p>
<p>And then, also, again, based on the force and the vectors</p>
<p>and the angles, you have to calculate that and adjust.</p>
<p>So really, you know, if you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>well, I can shoot a single leg,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like moving the chess, it&rsquo;s not one move, right?</p>
<p>If you want to talk about different forces and stuff,</p>
<p>it could be hundreds or thousands of different moves</p>
<p>based on how hard I shoot it,</p>
<p>the angle, the direction, all of those things.</p>
<p>Yeah, but wait a minute.</p>
<p>So, robots can do this kind of stuff really fast.</p>
<p>People probably know the physiology of this,</p>
<p>but the reaction speed for a human</p>
<p>is maybe 100 milliseconds, something like that, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>from sensation to, like, from the signal traveling</p>
<p>up to your brain and down, I don&rsquo;t know what that number is,</p>
<p>but robots certainly could do it way faster.</p>
<p>You would actually have to, like, constrain the speed.</p>
<p>Well, so the robots are already killing the chess people,</p>
<p>right, so, yeah, theoretically,</p>
<p>they could eventually beat wrestlers,</p>
<p>but you asked what was harder, wrestling or chess.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think wrestling is,</p>
<p>because of the time component in it</p>
<p>and the physicality of, you know,</p>
<p>is it this force or that force, you know?</p>
<p>Because if I&rsquo;m gonna say we&rsquo;re in a seatbelt side by side,</p>
<p>right, a wrestling seatbelt, not in Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>based on the pressure you&rsquo;re giving me,</p>
<p>I might do a bunch of different things, right?</p>
<p>And so, like, to an untrained eye,</p>
<p>they might both look like the same thing from you.</p>
<p>To a trained feel, it&rsquo;s like, well, in one case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really evident I should go this way,</p>
<p>in another case, it&rsquo;s really evident I should go that way.</p>
<p>So the other thing to consider, just like with chess,</p>
<p>the AI systems, so human versus human</p>
<p>play a certain way together.</p>
<p>They actually haven&rsquo;t considered</p>
<p>a really large number of strategies</p>
<p>that AI systems discover.</p>
<p>So one possibility with a robot,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll discover certain ties and certain takedowns.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>That, like, will dominate no matter what the human does.</p>
<p>You think that, so you think there&rsquo;s that,</p>
<p>so this, I mean, this is what I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>with the wrestling, so fun is there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>even after 80, 90 years, there&rsquo;s this continuous evolution.</p>
<p>So you think.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be some, like, low single type thing,</p>
<p>like John Smith type of situation.</p>
<p>Well, like a down block go behind is something</p>
<p>that has really, I would say really in the last fiveish years</p>
<p>has really been evolved.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a go behind?</p>
<p>Down block go behind, so when you shoot,</p>
<p>well, they just, head inside or head outside matters,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s one for both.</p>
<p>You shoot at me, essentially, I take my leg, boom.</p>
<p>And then, so that was kind of in existence</p>
<p>when I was in college, right?</p>
<p>You down block them and you stop,</p>
<p>but usually you hit on this side of their head, right?</p>
<p>And now, immediately, you shoot and I attack that shoulder</p>
<p>and then I start hitting a go behind on you, right?</p>
<p>And so, like, that in its current incarnation,</p>
<p>it absolutely wasn&rsquo;t around when I was in college.</p>
<p>I would say it probably became popular</p>
<p>five to seven years ago.</p>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s these big things that are happening.</p>
<p>Now I really wanna roll back</p>
<p>because I wanna be ahead of the game.</p>
<p>I wanna know what I&rsquo;m missing.</p>
<p>I mean, one interesting thing you have with Alpha Zero</p>
<p>that plays chess is it sacrifices pieces</p>
<p>much more than humans do.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll give you a piece.</p>
<p>And not only does it give you a piece,</p>
<p>it will wait a bunch of moves before it makes you pay.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Because it knows that that&rsquo;s better for the long term.</p>
<p>Long term.</p>
<p>So like humans rarely sacrifice</p>
<p>without getting the piece back,</p>
<p>like two or three moves after.</p>
<p>Alpha Zero can wait like five moves.</p>
<p>So basically you&rsquo;ll have, potentially with wrestling,</p>
<p>you might have a robot that like puts itself</p>
<p>in bad positions, but in a certain kind of way</p>
<p>then that will actually turn out.</p>
<p>Lures the opponent in to trap.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what my style is based on.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You basically narrow, one thing to do</p>
<p>is you narrow the set of choices.</p>
<p>You put yourself in a bad position,</p>
<p>but it narrows the set of choices.</p>
<p>For them, because they&rsquo;re not used to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re not used to it.</p>
<p>And then you drag them into your, yeah.</p>
<p>So, but there&rsquo;s also, the problem is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s mechanical issues.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s actually just difficult to build robots</p>
<p>that are able to sense,</p>
<p>because we have sensation throughout our body, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just difficult to build that kind of robot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s expensive.</p>
<p>You start talking about multimillion dollars,</p>
<p>and then people start asking you questions.</p>
<p>Why did you invest all of this money?</p>
<p>They wanna see what moves they do, duh, hello.</p>
<p>It could be a better investment.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I mentioned John Smith.</p>
<p>He is, if people don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>one of the great wrestlers, wrestling coaches ever.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also creative like you.</p>
<p>He spoke really highly of you.</p>
<p>What do you think about that guy?</p>
<p>Did you guys ever work together?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>So you know what, when I was a senior,</p>
<p>and I had the people wrestling in my head,</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to be doing,</p>
<p>I was pretty much a graduate,</p>
<p>so I did an independent study with the sports psychology.</p>
<p>I was potentially going to go to grad school</p>
<p>for sports psychology.</p>
<p>Well, I actually did nine credits,</p>
<p>and then I just decided I didn&rsquo;t want to do it anymore.</p>
<p>I continued learning on my own.</p>
<p>But I had an independent study with the guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the head of USA Track and Field Sports Psych.</p>
<p>So here was the class was,</p>
<p>I got to go sit down and talk with him for an hour,</p>
<p>and he was like fascinated by me.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t let me do homework.</p>
<p>It was like the greatest three credits ever.</p>
<p>We just talked.</p>
<p>I learned so much.</p>
<p>It was so awesome.</p>
<p>But so I started, so one time it came up,</p>
<p>I had these robot, or people wrestling in my head,</p>
<p>and he said, well, who else do you think,</p>
<p>but John Smith happened.</p>
<p>So I went and got John Smith&rsquo;s number,</p>
<p>and I called him and said,</p>
<p>hey, you ever had these people wrestling in your head?</p>
<p>And he said, yeah, but as soon as I stopped coaching,</p>
<p>they went away.</p>
<p>Same thing happened to me.</p>
<p>As soon as I started coaching, they went away.</p>
<p>So if I really force myself now,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, I see something in practice,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really higher level,</p>
<p>because high school wrestling,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to, maybe I feel bad,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a little bit lower level, right?</p>
<p>So if Keegan, for example, who won the tournament,</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s struggling with a problem or asks me a question,</p>
<p>and I can force myself to see the bodies moving</p>
<p>and think about it again,</p>
<p>kind of like I was in early age,</p>
<p>but it won&rsquo;t just flow there anymore.</p>
<p>So he said it went away, and for me, it went away also.</p>
<p>By the way, if we can pause on the bodies in your head,</p>
<p>how are they generating new ideas?</p>
<p>Are they just kind of?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You tell me.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, they&rsquo;re just scrambling in your head?</p>
<p>It would be specifically based on a problem</p>
<p>I was struggling with, or a specific position, you know?</p>
<p>It goes in for a single, and then go from there.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m sitting in geography class,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have to work that hard, because it&rsquo;s easy, right?</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;m just sitting there acting</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m looking at the board,</p>
<p>and these guys are wrestling,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m watching them wrestle,</p>
<p>and yeah, sometimes they come up with a really good solution.</p>
<p>Is there somebody you look up to style wise?</p>
<p>Like Gable, John Smith, all these legend status people.</p>
<p>Probably Gable, or it&rsquo;s a Gable.</p>
<p>John Smith, but after the fact.</p>
<p>So the problem with wrestling in my era</p>
<p>was you couldn&rsquo;t watch it.</p>
<p>There was no access, right?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t really available.</p>
<p>Even if you want to say, go find a bunch of John Smith,</p>
<p>man, they&rsquo;re kind of hard to find, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of them on YouTube,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve obviously seen all of those,</p>
<p>but in my era, there really wasn&rsquo;t any of it.</p>
<p>So it was hard to be a fan of something,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why wrestling has, the fans are going like this,</p>
<p>because now you can flip on the Flow app,</p>
<p>and you can watch something that&rsquo;s happening in Europe, right?</p>
<p>We can do this easily, so we can be a fan of people.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m more a fan of wrestling than I was then,</p>
<p>because there just was no access.</p>
<p>So now I can watch someone I like,</p>
<p>and say, oh shit, that guy&rsquo;s wrestling.</p>
<p>Oh, boom, I flip my phone on, I watch them wrestle.</p>
<p>That type of thing.</p>
<p>You know, and a quick rant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really frustrating that you can&rsquo;t watch the Olympics.</p>
<p>Oh my god, it&rsquo;s so frustrating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, I think I&rsquo;m gonna go to war on this point.</p>
<p>Go to NBC&rsquo;s headquarters, I&rsquo;ll go with you.</p>
<p>You got a soldier here.</p>
<p>I was talking to Jimmy, Jimmy Pedro,</p>
<p>he was surprised by this, too.</p>
<p>Most matches, you can&rsquo;t see, even,</p>
<p>you talk about like a comeback, Gable Steelers,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t see the full match.</p>
<p>You get like a crappy highlight.</p>
<p>So the two biggest things, and really the three,</p>
<p>the NCAA championships on ESPN,</p>
<p>the Olympic trials are on NBC, and the Olympics are on NBC.</p>
<p>And these companies are so big,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a department dedicated</p>
<p>to selling the rights to that footage, right?</p>
<p>So the rights to wrestling footage,</p>
<p>which no one really cares all that much about,</p>
<p>except a niche, are the exact same as track and field,</p>
<p>or basketball in the Olympics.</p>
<p>So yes, all of this stuff is completely inaccessible to us.</p>
<p>The NCAAs, the Olympic trials, and the Olympics,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t go watch old film on it, it sucks.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, old, the current film.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t even watch the Gable match?</p>
<p>The Gable Steelers, no.</p>
<p>They did a, you know, they do something</p>
<p>that annoys the fuck out of me.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Okay, they do like a three or two minute highlight.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like they capture the most important thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all about the buildup.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that very beginning when you step on the mat,</p>
<p>and the nerves, and you walk out, and like that,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, you miss,</p>
<p>then when the triumph happens, or the heartbreak happens,</p>
<p>it has that much more power.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you want to go to war with NBC or ESPN,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to join that.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m fortunate it&rsquo;s the IOC.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, is the IOC on that?</p>
<p>IOC is selling, for the Olympics,</p>
<p>is the one that&rsquo;s making.</p>
<p>Well, so NBC broadcasts,</p>
<p>so they obviously have the live rights.</p>
<p>You would think they would have recorded,</p>
<p>if they, I mean, they&rsquo;re the ones recording it,</p>
<p>you would think they keep the rights when you think.</p>
<p>No, no, no, they&rsquo;re getting a license of it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting exclusive like license,</p>
<p>but like the, you know, for example,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this, I talked to Travis Stevens, the Judo player,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a really sort of famous match,</p>
<p>just a heartbreak in his career from 2012 Olympics,</p>
<p>where he goes against a German, Oli Bischoff, whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 20 minute match to go to war,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not available anywhere,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s uploaded on YouTube and set to private.</p>
<p>The reason I know this is on the IOC channel.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve uploaded all of these matches.</p>
<p>They have it and put it up.</p>
<p>So actually, so my Olympic match, the one I won,</p>
<p>got put public, and so I don&rsquo;t know if it was private,</p>
<p>it got put up on YouTube.</p>
<p>I was allergic to it the week of my Jake Paul fight.</p>
<p>It was so dumb.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, why, this is 13 years later, this is bullshit.</p>
<p>Like this should have been up.</p>
<p>So, I mean, okay, so what about Olympic trials footage?</p>
<p>That has to be the USOC then or NBC?</p>
<p>So I know like, okay, so I know Flow, right?</p>
<p>Cause I worked with them.</p>
<p>I know if Flow buys your event or whatever, right?</p>
<p>They buy the rights, generally in the contract,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have rights to both live stream it</p>
<p>and then use that footage at any point moving forward.</p>
<p>So those matches live on Flow&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I would be surprised</p>
<p>if NBC didn&rsquo;t have something similar.</p>
<p>Flow does a pretty good job of providing</p>
<p>like a place where you can watch all these matches.</p>
<p>NBC does not.</p>
<p>Does not, yeah.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s an argument with Flow as well,</p>
<p>but certainly with Olympics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between what Flow does</p>
<p>and what the Olympics represent.</p>
<p>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>Like it feels like the Olympics,</p>
<p>which is what the charter says,</p>
<p>should be as accessible as possible.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Like you should really lower the barrier</p>
<p>for entry for the Olympics.</p>
<p>You know that&rsquo;s what the charter says,</p>
<p>but those people in the IOC,</p>
<p>these are the worst people ever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very bad.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re not bad.</p>
<p>They just lost touch of the dream they once had</p>
<p>when they joined the IOC.</p>
<p>Well, I would argue all the way back</p>
<p>that these are rich fat cats who,</p>
<p>like I get so mad about the NCAA,</p>
<p>which finally now got rid of this bullshit term amateurism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, there&rsquo;s some holy grail</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t make money to be an amateur athlete,</p>
<p>but the people who own the IOC</p>
<p>or the people who own the institutions,</p>
<p>college institutions are making boatloads of money</p>
<p>off of you, that&rsquo;s crap.</p>
<p>So you competed, like you said, at the 2008 Olympics.</p>
<p>Did you believe you can win gold?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So your mental game was on point.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was ready.</p>
<p>So what went wrong?</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t good enough.</p>
<p>That was what I said.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so at that point in time,</p>
<p>it was my first year of international competition.</p>
<p>So when I came out in 2007,</p>
<p>it was my first time making 74 kilograms,</p>
<p>which is pretty small for me.</p>
<p>I had some failures, but then quickly I turned that around</p>
<p>and I was having success in America.</p>
<p>I was beating everyone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say easy, but yeah,</p>
<p>I was doing really well.</p>
<p>I went international one time,</p>
<p>and there was one match I got cheated on.</p>
<p>The Russians, they&rsquo;re cheaters.</p>
<p>Excuse you, Ukraine, not Russia.</p>
<p>I lost one real match where I actually lost,</p>
<p>and it was to Denis Sarguch,</p>
<p>who would go on to win three world titles,</p>
<p>but he was behind the T of that year,</p>
<p>and it was competitive.</p>
<p>So I knew, okay, I&rsquo;m going with the best guys in the world.</p>
<p>I beat a bunch of other guys who were good</p>
<p>and had passed decent results.</p>
<p>So I knew I was right there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I ran into this guy, Ivan Fundora,</p>
<p>and I had someone do scouting reports for him,</p>
<p>actually my high school coach,</p>
<p>who now coaches for our academy, John Messimerich,</p>
<p>and Fundora was the worst stylistic matchup.</p>
<p>I got him, and I lost him second round.</p>
<p>So I wasn&rsquo;t good enough.</p>
<p>Had I decided to keep wrestling,</p>
<p>I probably would have gotten better,</p>
<p>but at that point, I just wasn&rsquo;t in the cards.</p>
<p>So in your division was, like you said, it&rsquo;s the T of,</p>
<p>if I said it&rsquo;s the T of, that guy&rsquo;s special.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very special.</p>
<p>So that would be my other guy that you asked earlier</p>
<p>who I enjoyed watching, and that was a guy I,</p>
<p>again, it was kind of after the fact</p>
<p>because it was hard to access footage,</p>
<p>but he was a lot of fun to watch.</p>
<p>What do you think made him great?</p>
<p>A lot of people talk about him</p>
<p>as potentially one of the greatest ever.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, so he won six and three,</p>
<p>six Worlds, three Olympics, nine total,</p>
<p>which there&rsquo;s only one or two people above that.</p>
<p>So again, it was hard to watch any live footage of him,</p>
<p>but from what I&rsquo;ve seen, his feel is different.</p>
<p>He was just ahead of his time,</p>
<p>and the feel and the touch he had</p>
<p>for certain moves and different things,</p>
<p>because obviously physically he&rsquo;s kind of unimposing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s taller than skinnier,</p>
<p>which it can work in wrestling,</p>
<p>but it is by less represented.</p>
<p>So yeah, he was special, so good.</p>
<p>Do you take any inspiration from,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about Dagestan in general.</p>
<p>What do you think makes those wrestlers great?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Have you read the book, The Talent Code?</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And that kind of talks about these talent hotspots</p>
<p>all around the world.</p>
<p>So now obviously with our wrestling academies,</p>
<p>we try to take some lessons from that and apply it.</p>
<p>I got to assume, they didn&rsquo;t cover Dagestan</p>
<p>in that book specifically,</p>
<p>but I got to assume a lot of the same principles</p>
<p>that are in that book apply to Dagestan in wrestling.</p>
<p>They did South Korea and women&rsquo;s golf.</p>
<p>They did Curacao in baseball.</p>
<p>They picked a lot of these other places</p>
<p>that were really elite.</p>
<p>I think it was maybe Moscow in women&rsquo;s tennis also.</p>
<p>So I think all of these things</p>
<p>that make any group great organization</p>
<p>is probably the same things that&rsquo;s happening there.</p>
<p>Well, the hardship, I mean,</p>
<p>is there something specific about wrestling</p>
<p>that can create so many great champions?</p>
<p>From that area?</p>
<p>So obviously they all love the big deal.</p>
<p>Wrestling specifically is a big deal there.</p>
<p>They do Sambo also, obviously.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s part of it is a lot of the kids are doing it.</p>
<p>They obviously are rough tumble, tough life.</p>
<p>Getting a lot of fights.</p>
<p>And then I think that also that a lot of them,</p>
<p>it is a way out right there.</p>
<p>The elite level athletes in that part of the world,</p>
<p>from my understanding, are really well compensated</p>
<p>compared to what the average person makes</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re treated really well.</p>
<p>So people see it as a way out.</p>
<p>Whereas like, and then honestly,</p>
<p>if America is getting better,</p>
<p>but in 2008, the reason I went to MMA</p>
<p>was because I didn&rsquo;t want to be poor my whole life.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It sucked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I don&rsquo;t want to make $20,000</p>
<p>for the next 48 years.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to go do something else.</p>
<p>If I could have made, even I didn&rsquo;t need to be rich, right?</p>
<p>If I could have made $100,000 or $70,000 wrestling,</p>
<p>I probably would have kept wrestling.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s factors</p>
<p>and obviously now they have a really like,</p>
<p>a bunch of really good people in one area.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s probably, and it&rsquo;s been going on for a long time.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s probably been a bunch of like adults</p>
<p>and coaches that are coming back and helping that progress.</p>
<p>So yeah, a lot of those things that happen.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m definitely going to travel there to talk to them</p>
<p>because I can speak Russian.</p>
<p>It makes it very,</p>
<p>makes me uniquely qualified to.</p>
<p>My brother can speak a little bit of Russian.</p>
<p>Your brother can? Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, like a little bit like he swears and.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Like he would, oh man, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t make me oversell.</p>
<p>I think he would be able to have a conversation with you.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Probably not like you.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, what&rsquo;s the reason he knows Russian?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why he got obsessed with languages.</p>
<p>And so his college degree is actually,</p>
<p>what are they called?</p>
<p>Interdis, where you have three minors.</p>
<p>So he had a minor in Russian, a minor in Spanish</p>
<p>and maybe Japanese, I&rsquo;m messing up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely, it&rsquo;s Russian and Spanish for sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the third one is.</p>
<p>No, but yeah, Dagestan, it&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>But the emphasis on technique, the lighter drilling,</p>
<p>like they don&rsquo;t really go super hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I only spent a couple, so I was there,</p>
<p>I was in Vladikavkaz in 2008.</p>
<p>That was where the World Cup was.</p>
<p>We had to train there for like two days afterwards.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t get to dig deep,</p>
<p>dig deep into what was going on or anything.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, I think sparring is very beneficial</p>
<p>for wrestling, not like sparring MMA is we fight, right?</p>
<p>Sparring in wrestling is, so I always just describe it</p>
<p>to be really simple.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re drilling, it&rsquo;s relatively 0% resistance.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re going as hard as we can, that&rsquo;s 100%.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all this gray area in the middle that&rsquo;s sparring,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So if you have a good relationship,</p>
<p>like college me and my brother, we could just go</p>
<p>and we know where each other&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even have to talk about it, right?</p>
<p>But like in my wrestling club, I&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>okay, hey, I want you guys to go 50% in this position.</p>
<p>Or I want the high crotch guy, I want him to shoot</p>
<p>and this is for him, so I want him to go 70.</p>
<p>And the defensive guy, I want you to go 40.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not supposed to be trying to win here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna go a little later.</p>
<p>I want you to give him some looks, you know?</p>
<p>So I think it has really taken hold in America.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really beneficial for success.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, I mean, America&rsquo;s doing better</p>
<p>than we&rsquo;ve ever done historically.</p>
<p>Well, that 70 and 40, that&rsquo;s like an art form</p>
<p>to find that right place,</p>
<p>because the really good people I&rsquo;ve trained with,</p>
<p>they go much closer to 100% speed wise,</p>
<p>but without forcing things the way you would</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some weird combination of things that,</p>
<p>like if you truly earn a technique,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re given that technique.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then it becomes much less injury prone.</p>
<p>It becomes somehow more fun, more dynamic.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get stuck in positions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a lot of movement.</p>
<p>Yeah, the one thing, so you and John talked about,</p>
<p>like different ways to learn and get better.</p>
<p>And so I think John obviously innovated</p>
<p>within the sport of jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>And so for us, and maybe there&rsquo;s a differentiator for us.</p>
<p>I think about it like.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>You have this academy and you sent me this plan.</p>
<p>They have like a really well thought through plan</p>
<p>for how to develop a good wrestler.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s, for me there&rsquo;s four categories, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the teaching, which is like, you don&rsquo;t know shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re coming in and I&rsquo;m showing you the move</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re literally going out there and you&rsquo;re trying.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s not even drilling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like teaching, like you&rsquo;re trying to learn something.</p>
<p>So obviously in someone&rsquo;s earlier periods,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re spending a lot of time in that phase</p>
<p>because they literally don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>how to move their bodies the right way.</p>
<p>Once you learn the skill, then there&rsquo;s the drilling</p>
<p>because you absolutely have to get those reps</p>
<p>to become really proficient in that movement</p>
<p>and then the sparring and then the live, right?</p>
<p>And so like, I think obviously by the time you get</p>
<p>to the kind of, I don&rsquo;t wanna say end point, right?</p>
<p>But further on, the time you spend teaching is so,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>in the learning teaching phase is not insignificant,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so much smaller because to someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s really good, who I&rsquo;ve coached for 10 years,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to give this big long drawn out explanation.</p>
<p>I just have to say, hey, move your hand a little differently</p>
<p>or just do this, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to spend any time there.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s like something that consumes</p>
<p>for the younger kids, say five through 12 or 13,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re consuming a massive amount of time there</p>
<p>on that teaching learning phase.</p>
<p>And then as we get older, that time wanes a lot.</p>
<p>But that makes total sense, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because when you look at like jiu jitsu schools,</p>
<p>they spend a lot of time in the teaching learning</p>
<p>and then the live, like there&rsquo;s not enough drilling.</p>
<p>I like how you draw a distinction there</p>
<p>because it feels like you&rsquo;re always starting from scratch.</p>
<p>Like people have like very crappy short term memory.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re not, like the way teaching is done</p>
<p>is you show a technique from scratch</p>
<p>and it seems disjoint.</p>
<p>It is for sure, especially if you have a class</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been with you for a while,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to start from scratch.</p>
<p>You can say, hey, let&rsquo;s focus on this one little thing here</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s, after we do this, let&rsquo;s do that,</p>
<p>and you kind of put, start putting it all together.</p>
<p>And then with jiu jitsu, the thing that I really struggled</p>
<p>with was a couple of things.</p>
<p>It was, and this is not speaking for all the jiu jitians,</p>
<p>my personal experience through the sport.</p>
<p>And I actually found my, so when I unretired,</p>
<p>I found someone really great that I loved</p>
<p>and I really wish it was Mark Lehman.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know him at all.</p>
<p>I wish I would have found him earlier</p>
<p>because he was just tremendous.</p>
<p>But number one, there&rsquo;s no drilling.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, in wrestling, I can boil down to,</p>
<p>I can probably name you the best six moves, right?</p>
<p>So we need, as younger people, single leg, right?</p>
<p>Single leg&rsquo;s gonna be the most proficient takedown.</p>
<p>It always has been, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>probably always will be,</p>
<p>unless they figure out something different.</p>
<p>The robot.</p>
<p>The robot figures out something different.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna shoot a lot of single legs.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because everyone&rsquo;s gonna do that, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna shoot a lot of single legs.</p>
<p>So just like, say, an armbar or some type of sweep, right?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we go get 50 reps there?</p>
<p>Hey, by the time I&rsquo;ve been in your jiu jitsu school</p>
<p>for two years, I better know a fucking armbar.</p>
<p>I better know it.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t spend 10 minutes teaching me.</p>
<p>Just tell me to go hit 50 reps.</p>
<p>And then if, when I&rsquo;m hitting my reps,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m doing wrong,</p>
<p>then just say, hey, Ben,</p>
<p>move your leg a little bit that way</p>
<p>or raise your hips up a little more, right?</p>
<p>Like, correct as you&rsquo;re drilling</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re getting all these reps at it</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re becoming more proficient.</p>
<p>And then the other thing I really struggled with was,</p>
<p>to your point during live,</p>
<p>so many times it&rsquo;s just this five minute go, go, go.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not the most efficient way to learn</p>
<p>because when you have two people,</p>
<p>especially when they&rsquo;re focused on winning,</p>
<p>and you say go, they&rsquo;re gonna go to wherever they do best.</p>
<p>Well, if I&rsquo;m trying to make you good at something,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you doing what you do best all the time.</p>
<p>I need you doing some other things, right?</p>
<p>If you have a great single leg</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t shoot to the other side of the body,</p>
<p>we need to work on that, right?</p>
<p>You need to start shooting the other side.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some sense that you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like you should be told what to work on</p>
<p>but you should be told to work on the thing</p>
<p>that you wanna work on.</p>
<p>Meaning, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe you can comment on this,</p>
<p>but everybody develops a different game</p>
<p>as you get better and better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a set of things you need to be working on.</p>
<p>So I actually have, like when I,</p>
<p>especially when I&rsquo;m training very seriously,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have a specific technique that I have in mind</p>
<p>and I have a sheet of paper on the side</p>
<p>where I literally, my head keep counting off</p>
<p>how many times I put myself in that position</p>
<p>and pulled off the technique.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all I care about in like training.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just, whatever it is,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a guillotine, it&rsquo;s a guillotine,</p>
<p>arm drag, arm drag, but I wanna make sure I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I love numbers, so I&rsquo;ll say like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make sure I get 50 arm drags</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not getting off the mat until I do.</p>
<p>And that, you know, if it takes.</p>
<p>Any thrilling or live contest?</p>
<p>So in this, in the thing I&rsquo;m describing right now</p>
<p>is the live contest.</p>
<p>Okay, got it.</p>
<p>But drilling, obviously, drilling.</p>
<p>So I feel like I can&rsquo;t find a drilling part,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s so hard to find drilling partners, even.</p>
<p>So boring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s annoying to me that this is boring.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing more annoying to me</p>
<p>than the look of boredom on another person&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re drilling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t you.</p>
<p>Do you really think drilling&rsquo;s that beneficial to you?</p>
<p>Cause you said it&rsquo;s a job.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>And he thinks I&rsquo;m an idiot, but yes.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why am I, am I an idiot?</p>
<p>Or why is this drilling beneficial?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go with two trick questions.</p>
<p>Why is it so beneficial?</p>
<p>I think for me, it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a meditative aspect to it</p>
<p>where the more you drill,</p>
<p>the more you start noticing the details.</p>
<p>Let me push back a little bit here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to push back all the way.</p>
<p>Cause every time, if I was wrestling,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll warm up my head, crotch, shin, leg, whatever, right?</p>
<p>But even, so say like at a high level</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m really wrestling, say 10 years ago,</p>
<p>even during that drill portion,</p>
<p>if we talk about the resistance of our opponent</p>
<p>from zero to 100,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that my partner at that point,</p>
<p>and this is people I&rsquo;m really comfortable with,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably at least going 20 or 30, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably giving me a certain look with the sprawl</p>
<p>or, you know, I got to get through their hands.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t set it up right,</p>
<p>they might put their arm down, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, we are drilling</p>
<p>cause we&rsquo;re wrestling at a really low resistance level,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a little bit of sparring.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>The 20%, the 20, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s not really drilling.</p>
<p>Cause I think it&rsquo;s drilling.</p>
<p>I think literally you&rsquo;re shooting</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just going boom, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>show me your dummy, boom, boom, boom, boom type of thing.</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s very hard to be a dummy</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t do 20%, so you&rsquo;re going to do 20%.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s so, so yes, that&rsquo;s 20%.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like sparring a little bit then.</p>
<p>No, but they&rsquo;re not really resisting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just giving you the right frame.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re giving you the right like movement</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re being an intelligent dummy, essentially.</p>
<p>I mean, but also like the really important component</p>
<p>of this is you pick the techniques for which is beneficial.</p>
<p>If the technique is, has dynamic elements to it,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be doing that with,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying like there&rsquo;s certain moves</p>
<p>and I like those moves and I select the game base</p>
<p>in those moves.</p>
<p>So are you drilling to get better</p>
<p>or are you drilling just to work out?</p>
<p>No, to get better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to tell you.</p>
<p>I believe you can become like exceptionally good</p>
<p>very fast by drilling.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>First of all, let me ask you an empirical question.</p>
<p>Let me, have you actually drilled 10,000 times</p>
<p>a particular move?</p>
<p>Millions.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t drilled millions.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands likely.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re just saying numbers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you know what 100,000.</p>
<p>The numbers are freaking astronomical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way more than 10,000.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you know what 100,000 feels like.</p>
<p>Dude, there was a 10 year period</p>
<p>where I wrestled every single day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 3,000 days, so you&rsquo;re telling me 10,000,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only three of them a day.</p>
<p>I do way more than that.</p>
<p>Three of them.</p>
<p>Probably 30 of them a day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 100,000.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>I doubt you did 30 a day for a particular technique.</p>
<p>I did, for sure, 100%.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Because some days I might do 100, right?</p>
<p>So 30 of 30 is not very many.</p>
<p>Especially if we count all reps,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re counting drilling and live.</p>
<p>So like our college coaches would make us just drill a lot</p>
<p>and I just hated it.</p>
<p>So I would rebel and just kind of give a little spar.</p>
<p>You shoot a high crotch, we&rsquo;ll start.</p>
<p>Coach wants to drill a high crotch.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ll start.</p>
<p>You shoot the high crotch, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m gonna sit the corner or I&rsquo;m gonna give you my hip</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna try something.</p>
<p>So then you have to react.</p>
<p>And I would argue that all skill level</p>
<p>past the beginner stuff is some necessity of that, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do this, then what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s back and forth.</p>
<p>I shoot a single leg, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>I shoot a high crotch, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>And you have to start unconsciously programming</p>
<p>these things in your head.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re too conscious to think about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be too slow to actually hit it at math.</p>
<p>But the drilling is the unconscious programming.</p>
<p>But the simple movement, the first simple movement,</p>
<p>the first simple movement, that single leg</p>
<p>or the high crotch or arm drag, whatever.</p>
<p>Like I feel like the amount you&rsquo;re gonna get better at it</p>
<p>is so minuscule compared to the amount you&rsquo;re gonna gain</p>
<p>at doing other things around it.</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s the key word, you feel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your opinion.</p>
<p>If we did a study on it, then I would be proven correct.</p>
<p>No, perhaps.</p>
<p>So first of all, your brain,</p>
<p>as an exceptionally creative combat athlete,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that you don&rsquo;t like the boredom of drilling.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s obvious that you have like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re such a creative energy</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just not going to be somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to enjoy that.</p>
<p>So enjoyment is probably having an active mind</p>
<p>is really important.</p>
<p>So the question is, do you have the kind of makeup</p>
<p>that has an active mind during a drilling on a dummy?</p>
<p>And I have that mind.</p>
<p>Like I can.</p>
<p>But do you really think, okay,</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re, let&rsquo;s pick a technique.</p>
<p>What technique do you want to drill on?</p>
<p>Are we doing jiu jitsu or wrestling?</p>
<p>Whatever you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe with words, but certain guard passes.</p>
<p>Let me think, just guard pass.</p>
<p>Okay, so you have a guard pass</p>
<p>and you get it to be, I&rsquo;d say nine and a half out of 10,</p>
<p>right, just from a technical standpoint.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think you need some resistance to feel?</p>
<p>Because essentially all benefit after that</p>
<p>is going to be, what are they going to try to do to me?</p>
<p>And if they shift that way,</p>
<p>do I need to sink here or move there?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I actually think we&rsquo;re agreeing,</p>
<p>but maybe terminology wise.</p>
<p>Well, the split is the important thing.</p>
<p>Like how much of each?</p>
<p>So I think it is spar.</p>
<p>Like I think it&rsquo;s a very light touch spar</p>
<p>is what you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>which is in my opinion, really isn&rsquo;t drilling.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because drilling past the basic proficiency,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think brings much value.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to tell you is I think it does.</p>
<p>I think doing that same movement,</p>
<p>I think you begin to learn more over time.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re saying like once you get the basic proficiency,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a diminishing returns.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think everything has diminishing returns</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re learning a technique.</p>
<p>But with something as complex as wrestling or grappling,</p>
<p>if you can have way more gains over here,</p>
<p>why focus on going from a 9.7 to a 9.8?</p>
<p>If this other area, if you&rsquo;re spending so much time here</p>
<p>that this other area is left unexplored,</p>
<p>you can make gigantic gains over there.</p>
<p>No, but you&rsquo;re gonna lose.</p>
<p>I think a lot depends on your style.</p>
<p>I think a lot is determined by how good you are</p>
<p>at one thing.</p>
<p>And so if you wanna become a master of a particular thing</p>
<p>and then make your whole game</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s all pulled into that system, then I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think one is too small of a number.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s small.</p>
<p>I feel like you can&rsquo;t be easily this, like I&rsquo;ve.</p>
<p>Yeah, you wanna funnel, you wanna create funnels.</p>
<p>Funnels. Funnels, right?</p>
<p>Where everything goes into a few positions.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s all field.</p>
<p>Where I feel you win 100%.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>But I feel you can get like drilling on a dummy 80%</p>
<p>of the time and 20% of the time live rolling</p>
<p>with people worse than you.</p>
<p>Like a little bit worse than you.</p>
<p>Or a lot worse than you.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think, I definitely think.</p>
<p>So my buildup would be teach.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking a complex technique, right?</p>
<p>So by the time we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll say a late high school kid who&rsquo;s pretty proficient,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably done the drilling part.</p>
<p>So then now it&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>if I wanna get something new to you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably tell you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably be able to do the basic premise</p>
<p>within five to 10 minutes if they&rsquo;re good, right?</p>
<p>Do this, okay, they do it.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s like, okay, so now here from here,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re gonna do, we&rsquo;re gonna go light sparring.</p>
<p>So I know you have success.</p>
<p>Cause I need you to complete the task</p>
<p>in order to get better at it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something a lot of people in wrestling mess up,</p>
<p>is they just wanna go with the toughest person.</p>
<p>But if you go with the toughest person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna actually execute on any skills.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get a workout and I need you to execute</p>
<p>cause I need you to get good at this.</p>
<p>In order to get good at it,</p>
<p>you have to get all the way through the technique.</p>
<p>Why do you need them to complete?</p>
<p>Just so they gain confidence in the technique</p>
<p>or they go through all this stuff?</p>
<p>They have to feel all the way through.</p>
<p>Like if I said, learn a high crotch when you&rsquo;re drilling</p>
<p>but stop halfway every time.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not actually gonna be able to do it</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re gonna stop, you&rsquo;re not gonna feel.</p>
<p>So, you know, try it on someone, spar lightly, get it.</p>
<p>Do it on someone who&rsquo;s not as good as you, get it.</p>
<p>Then kind of work your way up the ladder</p>
<p>so you can get it on someone your own skill level</p>
<p>or maybe better than you, right, in a live competition.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I feel like that basic drilling,</p>
<p>so a kid like Keegan who I&rsquo;ve brought up a few times,</p>
<p>I feel like if there&rsquo;s something new,</p>
<p>I could literally tell him,</p>
<p>this is what I want you to do</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s such a great feeler,</p>
<p>he could go drill it proficiently</p>
<p>within probably a minute or two.</p>
<p>But then to hit it on someone high level,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna take quite a while longer.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a mix of drilling and sparring</p>
<p>on people a little bit worse than you.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then equal and then better, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, because there&rsquo;s this, with grappling,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s such like a feel component to the pressure,</p>
<p>the movement, all these things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still, like I said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many things you can throw at someone</p>
<p>out of one position, not just moves,</p>
<p>but moves at a different level of force or whatever.</p>
<p>Are you and these kids developing</p>
<p>like a big picture strategy of like,</p>
<p>what are the main setups and take downs</p>
<p>and just like a whole system?</p>
<p>So I kind of sent you our technique book, right,</p>
<p>how we kind of go at approach it.</p>
<p>So I think in wrestling, you&rsquo;re going to need,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need a handful of things</p>
<p>just off the word go, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to, so I think on our feet,</p>
<p>I need to be able to take this out of the body.</p>
<p>I need to be able to take that out of the body.</p>
<p>I need to be able to bring you underneath me.</p>
<p>I need to be able to go around you, right?</p>
<p>Now we can accomplish those different ways,</p>
<p>but we should have all of those weapons</p>
<p>if we wanna be really good some way, right?</p>
<p>So if I neglect one of those,</p>
<p>so if I neglect the ability to say, pull you down, right?</p>
<p>Front lock you.</p>
<p>Now, if I have a good shot and you&rsquo;re smart,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna lower your stance.</p>
<p>So my shot is not gonna be as successful</p>
<p>and I have the inability to pull you down, right?</p>
<p>So I kind of need all of those so I can,</p>
<p>as they get better, I can point those things out.</p>
<p>On bottom, my folks at bottom,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain things like you have to be good</p>
<p>at leg right defense, right?</p>
<p>You have to, I mean, at a high level or you&rsquo;re just gonna,</p>
<p>when you get it in, you&rsquo;re just getting stuck there.</p>
<p>Not gonna be able to escape.</p>
<p>But besides that, yeah, there&rsquo;s a multitude of things</p>
<p>that you can choose from and I&rsquo;m gonna,</p>
<p>depending on your body style and what you&rsquo;re good and bad</p>
<p>at, I&rsquo;m gonna probably develop something a little different.</p>
<p>I might give you, hey, you do the quad pod,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be better at the knee slide, whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, top, kind of same thing.</p>
<p>I have to ask you about Khabib.</p>
<p>So I remember a while ago Rogan said</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the perfect fight for Khabib, you are.</p>
<p>So let me ask two questions.</p>
<p>The first, do you think you can beat him in an MMA match</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re at your peak?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t like, yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of those people where people will get really mad</p>
<p>at me if I say yes, but yeah, I mean, I think.</p>
<p>But how would you do it?</p>
<p>How would you solve that puzzle?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we would grapple</p>
<p>and I think I would be better than him.</p>
<p>But you know, sometimes I feel weird saying this,</p>
<p>people are like, yeah, right, you&rsquo;re full of shit.</p>
<p>And, but that&rsquo;s no one out grappled him, right?</p>
<p>I mean, nobody did.</p>
<p>And maybe I&rsquo;m wrong on this,</p>
<p>but if we look at the best possible candidates,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely one of them.</p>
<p>And then obviously I have a small size advantage too.</p>
<p>So in a wrestling match,</p>
<p>so we can just reduce that MMA match to a wrestling match.</p>
<p>What do you think is the right strategy on him?</p>
<p>Like, do you understand his style,</p>
<p>his wrestling style, the pressure he applies?</p>
<p>Do you understand how the hell he makes it happen?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, he never, unfortunately,</p>
<p>fought any real, who I would say,</p>
<p>really, really high level wrestlers.</p>
<p>I was actually really disappointed</p>
<p>how bad Justin Gaethje&rsquo;s wrestling was,</p>
<p>because Justin Gaethje had some solid success,</p>
<p>but his wrestling was really bad in that fight.</p>
<p>Gaethje had success in the NCAA?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think he was seventh place, maybe, or somewhere.</p>
<p>He was definitely all American.</p>
<p>It was lower though.</p>
<p>So yeah, I would like to see how he dealt with someone</p>
<p>who was like, who I think, oh man,</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s a really high level wrestler.</p>
<p>Because we saw, and this is early in his career,</p>
<p>but Gleason Tebow did give him some issues</p>
<p>earlier in his career.</p>
<p>So I would like to see him in that situation</p>
<p>and see how he does.</p>
<p>I would love to, I just love wrestling and grappling.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d love this.</p>
<p>Someone said, hey, Ben, Khabib wants to roll with you.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m there tomorrow.</p>
<p>It sounds like a blast.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably competitive as hell.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still competitive?</p>
<p>I know when to be and when not to be.</p>
<p>Say if I&rsquo;m going to high school kids,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not going to be competitive</p>
<p>because then I&rsquo;m just being a dick.</p>
<p>How would you take him down?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What are we talking about, real wrestling?</p>
<p>Like wrestling, wrestling?</p>
<p>Wrestling, wrestling.</p>
<p>I would probably try to take single legs and stuff.</p>
<p>Single legs?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t, okay.</p>
<p>None, none.</p>
<p>No, honestly, I don&rsquo;t have the slightest clue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to feel, I&rsquo;d feel him out.</p>
<p>But single legs is my best take on it.</p>
<p>People talk about his wrestling being really good.</p>
<p>People that train with him.</p>
<p>So, okay, so I grilled someone, I will not say who,</p>
<p>on the Ed Ruth thing,</p>
<p>because Ed Ruth is very elite at folk style wrestling.</p>
<p>He never became that great at fighting, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Wait, Ed Ruth wrestled Khabib?</p>
<p>They were on the same team for a while, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And there was rumors that Khabib beat him up.</p>
<p>And I said, I sure can&rsquo;t believe that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard that that was,</p>
<p>if they were just straight wrestling,</p>
<p>Ed would get slightly the better of it.</p>
<p>Well, Ed Ruth is like one of the greats.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that was what I heard.</p>
<p>But in an MMA setting,</p>
<p>because of all the tools that Khabib would get him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I agree.</p>
<p>I agree with Rogan on this one.</p>
<p>That would have been good to see.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>So yeah, if Khabib wants to work out, I&rsquo;d love it.</p>
<p>I love wrestling and grappling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do much Jiu Jitsu</p>
<p>because I just don&rsquo;t have time for it anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the Wrestling Academy like every single day.</p>
<p>But yeah, I loved Jiu Jitsu while I did it.</p>
<p>And if I didn&rsquo;t have Wrestling Academies,</p>
<p>I probably would still be doing Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do well in Jiu Jitsu as well.</p>
<p>But let me ask you a ridiculous question.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the greatest of all time, freestyle or folk style?</p>
<p>Oh, wrestling.</p>
<p>Wrestling.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Well, I will say my knowledge past like the year 2000</p>
<p>is really not that great.</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>In which direction?</p>
<p>Sorry, after 2000?</p>
<p>No, no, before.</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t find any film or anything, you know?</p>
<p>And so you hear of all these.</p>
<p>So you need evidence?</p>
<p>You need direct evidence?</p>
<p>I want to be able to watch them and see them</p>
<p>and feel the times and feel their opponents</p>
<p>and all those things to really like,</p>
<p>I hate giving bad answers, you know?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just not enough footage of any of those people.</p>
<p>You know, we go back to someone like Alexander Medved.</p>
<p>Like, you can&rsquo;t find footage.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t find anything on him, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, who is the wrestler?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>So post 2000, I think, and obviously just freestyle.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Americans, Russians?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s just that T.F. has probably the best argument</p>
<p>post 2000.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Russian tank, that guy is, yeah.</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s better, Snyder or Sajilov?</p>
<p>So Sajilov just won at the Olympics.</p>
<p>Now, I understand this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how that works,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty close, right?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Not that match, but in general, the matchup.</p>
<p>So, well, so Kyle won the first one in 17.</p>
<p>Sajilov pinned him the following year.</p>
<p>But then Kyle lost and took bronze in 19.</p>
<p>And then just lost.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say fairly decisively,</p>
<p>but it was six to three and it was a late take down.</p>
<p>He kind of gave it up and maybe if it was really competitive,</p>
<p>maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna wrestle again in like two weeks here.</p>
<p>So that, you know, yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>you have to say Sajilov at this point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else to say</p>
<p>unless Kyle proves us otherwise.</p>
<p>Yeah, not enough people talk about Sajilov.</p>
<p>Okay, well, you think that guy should go to MMA?</p>
<p>You think Kyle should go to MMA?</p>
<p>Some of these guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re making enough money in wrestling</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t really feel the need to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s terrifying though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a heavyweight, Sajilov would probably,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like Khabib, but heavyweight.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember,</p>
<p>do you remember Bilal Makov?</p>
<p>So Bilal Makov actually was the Russian representative</p>
<p>in both styles in 2016, Greco and freestyle.</p>
<p>And he was, to my knowledge,</p>
<p>the only person the UFC has ever signed</p>
<p>that was zero and zero, in modern era,</p>
<p>signed that was zero and zero.</p>
<p>And then he actually never ended up fighting.</p>
<p>But weird, right?</p>
<p>So yeah. No motivation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the story is.</p>
<p>Cause sometimes out of Russia,</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you have better sources than I do.</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels like dudes just disappear.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re a world champ or a little big champ</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden you&rsquo;re like, wait, where&rsquo;d he go?</p>
<p>You talked shit about Russia earlier in the conversation.</p>
<p>So. Oh, what&rsquo;d I say?</p>
<p>I forgot, but I think.</p>
<p>Steroids.</p>
<p>I think somebody&rsquo;s gonna show up to your door.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried.</p>
<p>I honestly, I&rsquo;ve said enough bad things</p>
<p>where I would be a kind of looking over my shoulder</p>
<p>if I wanted to do something.</p>
<p>I, for one, love the Russians.</p>
<p>What about Icarus?</p>
<p>How does that make you feel?</p>
<p>What about it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fake news.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s propaganda?</p>
<p>Maybe it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is anymore.</p>
<p>Maybe it is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s troublesome, man.</p>
<p>I hate cheating in all of its forms.</p>
<p>Any other like recaps from the Olympics of 2020 Tokyo</p>
<p>that stood out to you?</p>
<p>Gable Stephenson?</p>
<p>Like anything like that?</p>
<p>Gable&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I think America&rsquo;s coming to the point</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re gonna compete with Russia</p>
<p>every single year in wrestling,</p>
<p>which obviously, you know,</p>
<p>long, long time ago, many, many years ago we were great.</p>
<p>And then kind of after that Soviet Union period,</p>
<p>I think there was a lot of poverty in that area.</p>
<p>And that kind of led the wrestling team</p>
<p>going down a little bit.</p>
<p>And then obviously a lot of those regions,</p>
<p>the way they found oil and gas in the Caspian Sea, I believe.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been really kind of on the upswing</p>
<p>for the last 20 years.</p>
<p>And now America really, since 2012,</p>
<p>has been on the upswing in wrestling.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re kind of really competing with them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not sending a couple of their best guys.</p>
<p>So for those who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the Olympics moved back a year.</p>
<p>So they are hosting the 2021 World Championships,</p>
<p>despite the fact that we just had the Olympics</p>
<p>two months ago.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s happening next week in Oslo, Norway.</p>
<p>So like Russia&rsquo;s not sending their number one at 57</p>
<p>and their number one at 65.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, America&rsquo;s probably gonna win, I think.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna guarantee anything,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a really good chance of it.</p>
<p>Is Dave Taylor, all of those guys, competing?</p>
<p>America gave any of the Olympians that medaled</p>
<p>the opportunity to not even have to wrestle off.</p>
<p>They just got to keep the spot</p>
<p>since it was two months later if they medaled.</p>
<p>So the only one who&rsquo;s not is Gable.</p>
<p>Gable&rsquo;s moving on.</p>
<p>We have a pretty good guy behind him.</p>
<p>Nick Wisniewski is a world medalist.</p>
<p>But then he&rsquo;s, so Burrell&rsquo;s filled in the 79 spot.</p>
<p>Jayden Cox filled in the 92 spot,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a world champion also.</p>
<p>So we have a pretty good squad.</p>
<p>A hell of a team. Pretty good squad, yeah.</p>
<p>Pretty good squad. Pretty happy.</p>
<p>So given your run in Bellator in one championship,</p>
<p>that was like one of the most dominant runs in MMA.</p>
<p>What would you say was like key to your dominance</p>
<p>in that long undefeated streak?</p>
<p>Huh, probably consistency would be one.</p>
<p>The fact that I just, I lived and trained the same way</p>
<p>no matter where my life was,</p>
<p>whereas a lot of fighters,</p>
<p>once they start making money for the first time,</p>
<p>they have all these obligations and they travel</p>
<p>and they really enjoy making money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of why some of them fall off.</p>
<p>So you had like the same process,</p>
<p>like the same camp. Yeah, I stayed at my house.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t vacation, yeah, everything.</p>
<p>Just, you know, and so that was a big part of it.</p>
<p>Obviously the style thing is like, no one could,</p>
<p>there was only a few people who could stop my style.</p>
<p>And I think I continue to get better</p>
<p>as a mixed martial artist.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t as innovative in mixed martial arts,</p>
<p>but there was a handful of things that I innovated,</p>
<p>you know, specifically in the top position</p>
<p>where I spent a lot of time where it was just like,</p>
<p>there was just, once I got on top of you,</p>
<p>it was like in a spider web</p>
<p>and there was just kind of no way out.</p>
<p>You know, you never felt the certain things I was doing.</p>
<p>And so people just, they gave up eventually.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s the level of wrestling in MMA would you say?</p>
<p>So I saw somewhere like champions,</p>
<p>the most popular martial art for current UFC champions</p>
<p>are all wrestling.</p>
<p>So we just lost a bunch of the belts.</p>
<p>Wrestling is a sport, right?</p>
<p>But yeah, at one point we had,</p>
<p>I think it was eight of nine maybe</p>
<p>or something to that effect.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s not just wrestling,</p>
<p>not just the actual martial art of wrestling</p>
<p>that contributes to our success in mixed martial arts,</p>
<p>but other things like the way we&rsquo;re systemized.</p>
<p>So most kids who have all this have went through</p>
<p>the high school program and the college program</p>
<p>and they know how to show up on time</p>
<p>and they know how to work hard.</p>
<p>So when they go to ATT or AKA or wherever,</p>
<p>they know how to show up on time</p>
<p>and they know how to work hard</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna get you a really long way.</p>
<p>Just those two things, right?</p>
<p>Not even the techniques, it&rsquo;s just the discipline.</p>
<p>Those things.</p>
<p>Then I think you throw on top of that the fact</p>
<p>that most of us have competed 1500 to 2000 times,</p>
<p>probably by the time we get to 20 something,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a huge advantage too.</p>
<p>Most of these other people from other disciplines</p>
<p>maybe have competed 100, if that, right?</p>
<p>So we have this competitive process down</p>
<p>really, really, really, really well.</p>
<p>Plus the weight cut.</p>
<p>The weight cut.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these things that factor into it.</p>
<p>I think the fact that we&rsquo;re really open minded,</p>
<p>I think if you would, I don&rsquo;t wanna pick on jiu jitsu again,</p>
<p>but how many jiu jitsu guys have became</p>
<p>highly proficient in wrestling</p>
<p>versus how many wrestling guys</p>
<p>have became highly proficient in jiu jitsu?</p>
<p>I think that number swings one way</p>
<p>and not that much the other way, you know?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re open to adapting and learning</p>
<p>and for some reason, like jiu jitsu people,</p>
<p>how many of them have got high level wrestling?</p>
<p>Or even mediocre wrestling, the number&rsquo;s really small.</p>
<p>They refuse to, it&rsquo;s really frustrating.</p>
<p>Why won&rsquo;t they do this?</p>
<p>This is obviously a part of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna pick on specific guys,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s certain guys in the history of MMA</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, listen, man.</p>
<p>I mean, Damian Maia, who was my last fight,</p>
<p>is a great example of somebody who actually</p>
<p>did get proficient in wrestling, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some of these jiu jitsu guys who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if you just got on top, you would submit him.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you learn a freaking takedown?</p>
<p>Like, holy moly, just learn how to take someone down.</p>
<p>Once you get them down, they will not get up</p>
<p>and you win the fight.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s so easy, you know?</p>
<p>But they refuse.</p>
<p>How complicated is that journey?</p>
<p>So like Donaher that you mentioned, Craig Jones,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re big on wrestling as part of jiu jitsu now.</p>
<p>Like wrestling, not just on the feet,</p>
<p>but wrestling from the bottom coming up</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So how difficult is that whole skill set, would you say,</p>
<p>for a jiu jitsu person to learn?</p>
<p>Not that hard.</p>
<p>If they really put their mind to it.</p>
<p>Cause they already like, when you grapple,</p>
<p>and this is any grappling art,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a certain part of it that you kind of get</p>
<p>and it can, it might not be the exact same thing,</p>
<p>but you understand how your body moves</p>
<p>and how to feel certain pressures</p>
<p>and you can adapt yourself pretty quickly, you know?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think, I think there&rsquo;s a certain level</p>
<p>of stubbornness where they didn&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>certain people didn&rsquo;t want to do it for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I think a lot of times in MMA, it&rsquo;s the I&rsquo;m so macho,</p>
<p>I can stand and bang thing, you know,</p>
<p>where they want to show how macho they are.</p>
<p>But yeah, that was a frustrating one that they,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of wrestlers who became highly proficient</p>
<p>in jiu jitsu and really adapted</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t go the other way.</p>
<p>And then I guess the other thing there too is</p>
<p>they can both steal from each other, right?</p>
<p>As any martial art can steal from another.</p>
<p>And like, I feel like jiu jitsu</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do enough stealing from wrestling.</p>
<p>Like they should have looked at all the wrestling possible</p>
<p>and said, well, why don&rsquo;t we steal that and that and that?</p>
<p>You know, and like, hey, let&rsquo;s take that over.</p>
<p>And maybe we&rsquo;d make a little tweak because it&rsquo;s different,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something we can definitely use there.</p>
<p>So like in wrestling, for example,</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a one arm guillotine in jiu jitsu, right?</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a move called, well, it&rsquo;s got a hundred,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like the oldest move in wrestling</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s what they did, the cows,</p>
<p>where they go around the chin and they throw them</p>
<p>on the back, how do we call that one?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay, sorry, did you just ask me what I call that one?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Would you take a cow and grab it by the neck,</p>
<p>throw it to the side?</p>
<p>No, but in wrestling, in wrestling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay, we call it that.</p>
<p>Are you putting it under?</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can grab their chin</p>
<p>and then you go under their arm</p>
<p>and then throw them on their back.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, gotcha, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we call that the honey badger,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s got different names,</p>
<p>wherever you go, it&rsquo;s got different names.</p>
<p>So I would always, I would say like pre Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>I was average at it, like I could do it,</p>
<p>but against good people, you&rsquo;d never get it for,</p>
<p>because they would get the back of their head up</p>
<p>and they were too strong where you couldn&rsquo;t collapse them</p>
<p>by going over their neck, right?</p>
<p>Because the forces weren&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>So then in Jiu Jitsu, you learn the one arm gi team</p>
<p>where you grab their chin and this is more of running along</p>
<p>the side of their head and then you go here</p>
<p>and you choke them, right?</p>
<p>Much more efficient way to move their head</p>
<p>because the fulcrum is way down here</p>
<p>and their head can move into that, right?</p>
<p>So once I learned that in Jiu Jitsu, I&rsquo;m like, wait,</p>
<p>I can do this in wrestling.</p>
<p>So now once I learn how to grab their chin the right way</p>
<p>and I do the honey badger, no one ever gets out.</p>
<p>I just had to steal that Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>put it in wrestling and boom, there we go.</p>
<p>But very few people steal any direction,</p>
<p>that takes creativity.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>And open mindedness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy because it&rsquo;s already done,</p>
<p>you just gotta steal it.</p>
<p>I mean, same with Judo, if you&rsquo;re a gi Jiu Jitsu person,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much stuff in Judo that&rsquo;s ripe for the stealing</p>
<p>because Judo is much more emphasizes explosive moves</p>
<p>on the transition, which is something Jiu Jitsu does not do.</p>
<p>Because you have some.</p>
<p>You mean from the take down to.</p>
<p>From the take down, but also just in general,</p>
<p>just in the transition, the concept of transition,</p>
<p>the Jiu Jitsu is very much about we&rsquo;re in this position,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re in this position, then we&rsquo;re in this position.</p>
<p>The Judo is much more in when there&rsquo;s chaos of any kind.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you need to strike.</p>
<p>And to learn that, I mean, that&rsquo;s why people like</p>
<p>Travis Stevens and Judoka, when they go to Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>they can dominate.</p>
<p>But Jiu Jitsu people should steal that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too stubborn.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so is every, wrestlers are stubborn too.</p>
<p>No way, there would never be any stubborn wrestlers.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I was surprised, all these coaches,</p>
<p>John Smith, Dan Gabel, they don&rsquo;t really have interest</p>
<p>in MMA or Jiu Jitsu and so on.</p>
<p>But you would think somebody like a John Smith</p>
<p>would like put on a white belt and roll around.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think he&rsquo;s just too focused on, you know.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s a coach.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s a coach and what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think if you take him when he&rsquo;s younger,</p>
<p>he would have a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We actually have a really good wrestler</p>
<p>making his MMA debut tomorrow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you, Bo Nickel,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard of him, very high level.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s gonna have a lot of success.</p>
<p>I mean, some people might say that like Jiu Jitsu</p>
<p>makes you a little comfortable being in your back</p>
<p>and for a wrestler, that could be like really bad.</p>
<p>I hate that take.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s the Dan Gabel take.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so stupid, it&rsquo;s so stupid.</p>
<p>For God&rsquo;s sakes, we know the fucking rules.</p>
<p>Just, in wrestling, you don&rsquo;t go to your back.</p>
<p>In Jiu Jitsu, you can, it&rsquo;s like, whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But like, so Jiu Jitsu, for example,</p>
<p>so I coached, when I was at Rufus, I coached the wrestling</p>
<p>for a long, I don&rsquo;t know, three, four, five years.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been taking a Jiu Jitsu guy</p>
<p>and teaching them a wrestling technique</p>
<p>where you needed to use your feet.</p>
<p>To teach a Jiu Jitsu guy, so easy, so simple,</p>
<p>because they already understand the concept,</p>
<p>butterfly guard, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, right?</p>
<p>To take a wrestler who&rsquo;s never done any of it</p>
<p>and teach him how to use his feet,</p>
<p>oh my God, it&rsquo;s such a beast, it&rsquo;s so hard,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not a weapon they&rsquo;re thinking about using.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, we understand the rules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like freestyle folks are wrestling.</p>
<p>Freestyle, if I&rsquo;m on the mat, I can lock my hands.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see people locking their hands</p>
<p>all the time in folk style just because they did freestyle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they get it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a rule, they understand it.</p>
<p>So the notion that somehow you come from on your back.</p>
<p>But pinning, that&rsquo;s like a, it has a special meaning.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I actually think, so Jiu Jitsu,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t actually wanna be flat, flat very often, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna be.</p>
<p>I always wondered this,</p>
<p>because I did a couple of catch wrestling tournaments,</p>
<p>and I did, I would put myself in butterfly guard,</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t going against good people,</p>
<p>so which is why I was doing all these things.</p>
<p>But I wondered if you could create a system of wrestling</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re butterfly guard.</p>
<p>So I think that there&rsquo;s a few places where I use it.</p>
<p>But so specifically the Elevator Series,</p>
<p>which my main series up bottom,</p>
<p>it is, it&rsquo;s not butterfly guard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a butterfly guard grip with your foot.</p>
<p>So I boom, I go here, I catch your leg with my foot,</p>
<p>boom, and I elevate you over, right?</p>
<p>And then also sometimes,</p>
<p>I think Keegan does this too from watching me,</p>
<p>but if I get double leg,</p>
<p>sometimes if I&rsquo;m accepting, so freestyle,</p>
<p>obviously you&rsquo;re gonna give him points,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna focus on accepting that you&rsquo;ve already got me,</p>
<p>and as I go down, I&rsquo;m just gonna butterfly guard you up,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna try to flip my hip back to the mat,</p>
<p>and end up in a wizard position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used that quite a few times,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s kind of like a bailout mechanism</p>
<p>that gets me back to maybe not a great position,</p>
<p>but obviously much better than being taken down.</p>
<p>Beautiful. Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me ask you quickly about crypto,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re also, you have a show.</p>
<p>You have a lot of interest in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Why are you interested in cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>Is it just a financial investment,</p>
<p>or is there a philosophy that attracts you to it?</p>
<p>So I, my friend told me about it in 2017.</p>
<p>I was actually, I went to, I was,</p>
<p>my friend met me in Shanghai.</p>
<p>I fought in one championship, and he told me,</p>
<p>and the second he told me, I&rsquo;m like, oh, I&rsquo;m so in,</p>
<p>because I had read Ron Paul and the Fed.</p>
<p>I had read, I kind of had an understanding</p>
<p>how the Fed is unfair,</p>
<p>and so when he told me about crypto,</p>
<p>this decentralized system that no one has control over,</p>
<p>it just made sense, and so we&rsquo;ve had the podcast,</p>
<p>to say Michael Saylor on it, and I love the way he says it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, who do you trust more with your money?</p>
<p>Do you trust the politicians, or do you trust engineers?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an easy choice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think, I don&rsquo;t even think</p>
<p>I have to think about that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust politicians, no matter what country they come</p>
<p>from, China, America, wherever, I don&rsquo;t trust them.</p>
<p>So. So what about in 2017, what was it, Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Are you, what do you find, which ones do you find interesting?</p>
<p>Yeah. There&rsquo;s all kinds of ideas,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the more sort of primal mechanism</p>
<p>of proof of work and Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s smart contracts, ideas,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all kinds of innovations</p>
<p>across the different points.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m in super deep</p>
<p>where I understand the technical components</p>
<p>of a lot of them.</p>
<p>I understand what Bitcoin can do for people,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s probably the one I&rsquo;ve focused the most on.</p>
<p>And I actually, I think I was talking about,</p>
<p>I was trying to convince Michael to talk about Bitcoin</p>
<p>because he hates it also, what he did last night.</p>
<p>And I think most of the main problems Bitcoin solves,</p>
<p>people in America are so American centric,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>So like high levels of inflation,</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t happened in, it&rsquo;s starting to happen,</p>
<p>it hasn&rsquo;t happened in America in a long time, right?</p>
<p>But someone in Venezuela is like, oh, I get that, you know,</p>
<p>or remittance payments, right?</p>
<p>Remittance payments to, you see it.</p>
<p>So I saw this in, when I was spending all the time</p>
<p>in Singapore, Singapore is obviously</p>
<p>a really wealthy country,</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;d have Indonesian workers or Filipino,</p>
<p>and they would all go on Sundays,</p>
<p>they would go to these places to ship stuff</p>
<p>back to their families and through Western Union,</p>
<p>Western Union gouges the shit out of these people.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re taking eight, 10, 12%</p>
<p>of whatever they&rsquo;re sending,</p>
<p>then it takes five days and the person&rsquo;s gonna go pick it up,</p>
<p>whereas Bitcoin, I could send you Bitcoin</p>
<p>person to person, right?</p>
<p>So like American people don&rsquo;t understand that.</p>
<p>American people don&rsquo;t really understand the unbanked, right?</p>
<p>A decent portion of the world is unbanked,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have access to it.</p>
<p>And a much, much, much smaller portion of the world</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have access to internet.</p>
<p>So if I can put a mobile wallet on your phone,</p>
<p>and we can send money person to person.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of those problems</p>
<p>where Americans don&rsquo;t really think about</p>
<p>that are really obvious that this solves.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a key one,</p>
<p>obviously the fact that the value goes up</p>
<p>is really outstanding also,</p>
<p>but if you look at it, I got in in 2017,</p>
<p>so I got to watch it go up.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t sell shit at the top, really stupid.</p>
<p>And then the majority of my time</p>
<p>was spent through the bear market.</p>
<p>And so I had to love it for the principles that it provided,</p>
<p>not the fact that I actually lost money in the beginning</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m way up, but yeah.</p>
<p>So I think that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just holding.</p>
<p>Just holding.</p>
<p>I think at the top of this bull market,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably sell a very small portion, just to.</p>
<p>So you mean like right now there&rsquo;s a bull market?</p>
<p>Yeah, most people think say in the next three to six months</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be at the top of the market.</p>
<p>And so probably when that happens,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably sell a little bit.</p>
<p>You gotta hodl it, Ben.</p>
<p>You gotta hodl.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I am.</p>
<p>So one of my podcast cohosts, he&rsquo;s like super rich,</p>
<p>like super rich.</p>
<p>So he has lost touch with the every man.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my argument to him, it&rsquo;s really simple.</p>
<p>And listen, I&rsquo;m doing well for myself in life,</p>
<p>but if say someone buys a Bitcoin, right?</p>
<p>One Bitcoin at $5,000, which it was last year.</p>
<p>And this Bitcoin goes from $5,000 to $200,000,</p>
<p>which is right around what a lot of people think</p>
<p>the peak is going to be.</p>
<p>They bought one Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re living in a $200,000 house.</p>
<p>So to take half of that, right?</p>
<p>You started with $5,000 of the Bitcoin,</p>
<p>to sell half a Bitcoin for $100,000</p>
<p>and pay off your house, your remaining house payment,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s life changing to someone.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>And so you still have a Bitcoin,</p>
<p>so if Bitcoin goes to a million,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still gonna have half a million,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna feel really, really rich</p>
<p>with that half a million dollars</p>
<p>because you bought it for effing $2,500, you know?</p>
<p>So yeah, so I would encourage anyone who&rsquo;s not uber rich</p>
<p>to, if you have huge profits, take a little bit of them</p>
<p>because it could change your life.</p>
<p>And if you hold it and it goes down,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel the pain of that.</p>
<p>Like sometimes if you&rsquo;re more constrained financially,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more psychologically difficult</p>
<p>to ride the ups and downs.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is for sure.</p>
<p>So they have these really fascinating things in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the main guys on our podcast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called Onchain Metrics.</p>
<p>So all wallet transactions are visible, you know?</p>
<p>And so they have all these fun categories.</p>
<p>So I think you said you don&rsquo;t like numbers, but.</p>
<p>I like numbers.</p>
<p>Oh, you love numbers.</p>
<p>So I love numbers also.</p>
<p>So they have all these different categories.</p>
<p>Like you can see how long a wallet has held a Bitcoin,</p>
<p>or how many Bitcoins are in a certain wallet.</p>
<p>And so what they&rsquo;ve seen during the downturn,</p>
<p>so April it kind of peaked and went down,</p>
<p>is that the whales are still buying.</p>
<p>So whales, people of a thousand or more are still buying.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve said the main group of sellers</p>
<p>is the ones who held it from zero to three months.</p>
<p>So like they don&rsquo;t have money.</p>
<p>They bought it because they thought it was going up.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh shit, I got to sell it, right?</p>
<p>Whereas anyone who&rsquo;s held it for a long time</p>
<p>is generally still holding on to it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good indicator, right, for the whole space.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you for some advice.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been through one heck of a career,</p>
<p>one heck of a life.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person today?</p>
<p>Well, in wrestling, I think wrestling&rsquo;s really a microcosm</p>
<p>of what your life&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why one of the things I stress to kids is like,</p>
<p>if we can go through this now and figure,</p>
<p>I have a couple of kids who are struggling</p>
<p>with certain things right now.</p>
<p>If you can figure it out this now in wrestling,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a lot better to figure it out now</p>
<p>and get over this mental hump</p>
<p>than when you&rsquo;re 32 and you have two kids, right,</p>
<p>and your job&rsquo;s not going well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a lot worse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a lot more painful then.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s fucking figure it out now.</p>
<p>So a lot of these things, a lot of these lessons</p>
<p>we can learn from wrestling,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s persistence or perseverance or work ethic,</p>
<p>or, you know what I said,</p>
<p>wrestlers show up on time and they work hard, right?</p>
<p>These things, if we can learn these things at an early age,</p>
<p>those are general, those characteristics</p>
<p>will generally carry on throughout our life.</p>
<p>And those are the things</p>
<p>that are going to make us really successful.</p>
<p>So, you know, I would say find a great coach,</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s going to spend a lot of time</p>
<p>and put a lot of time into you</p>
<p>and make sure they have a lot of wisdom</p>
<p>and steal all the wisdom that you can from them.</p>
<p>And then if you can be successful at one thing,</p>
<p>generally whatever that recipe was</p>
<p>that took you to be successful at that,</p>
<p>apply it to everything else, right?</p>
<p>Apply it to the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Apply it to getting a wife that you enjoy.</p>
<p>Apply it to living in a place you want to live,</p>
<p>doing a job you want to do, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many possibilities</p>
<p>and you just have to be bold enough</p>
<p>to go take those chances.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because early on in life</p>
<p>is when you have much more time.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t realize it&rsquo;s time to learn the lessons.</p>
<p>Like somehow later in life,</p>
<p>you get busier, responsibilities</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Like high school is a magical time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in college.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in college, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s so much time to learn.</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t even have kids yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t have kids, but that still fills up.</p>
<p>Well, no, I&rsquo;m purpose.</p>
<p>And I did something that many people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t seem to be able to do.</p>
<p>I walked away from a lot of responsibilities.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>By saying goodbye.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>But meetings, everybody around me at MIT</p>
<p>was like meetings fill the day.</p>
<p>And then you have more projects</p>
<p>and you do a great job and you become successful.</p>
<p>And then the more meetings fill the day</p>
<p>and more responsibilities as opposed to like,</p>
<p>wait a minute, do I want to be involved in all these things?</p>
<p>And instead, do I want to find one or two things</p>
<p>to really focus on?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I choose.</p>
<p>But that becomes harder and harder</p>
<p>and harder as you get older.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I&rsquo;m sure, and also the more success you have,</p>
<p>you become sought after other places too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s happening with you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to keep saying no, no, no.</p>
<p>Saying no is hard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re known for roasting people</p>
<p>with a single boom roasted line.</p>
<p>So any ideas, maybe you want to mention malice,</p>
<p>but any ideas come to mind when you look at me?</p>
<p>Man, you know what?</p>
<p>If I was going to boom roast someone,</p>
<p>I would want to kind of like research their career</p>
<p>and dissect them and figure out their biggest negatives.</p>
<p>Get to the core.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have that notion with you.</p>
<p>I figured, you know, I got a general sense of,</p>
<p>okay, he&rsquo;s really successful, he&rsquo;s super sharp.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really interested in some really interesting things.</p>
<p>I bet we&rsquo;ll have a great conversation,</p>
<p>but I had no intention to roast you.</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>What about malice?</p>
<p>You had dinner with him last night.</p>
<p>Hmm, for him.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you get to know him, by the way?</p>
<p>Just Twitter.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the most magical place in the world, right?</p>
<p>I always tell people it&rsquo;s the greatest source of information</p>
<p>if you know how to use it.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s insane on Twitter, actually.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s quite a lot.</p>
<p>So I had to unfollow him on Twitter,</p>
<p>because he was too much.</p>
<p>It was too intense?</p>
<p>No, it was too much, it fills up.</p>
<p>Like, I want to be able to consume the content.</p>
<p>So if I want to see something he says,</p>
<p>I can go to his page, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just too much for my timeline.</p>
<p>I want to be able to consume who I follow.</p>
<p>So I try to not follow a lot of people,</p>
<p>because I want to be able to consume them.</p>
<p>And he was too much.</p>
<p>He fights the trolls, which,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;d ever fight the trolls.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just too many of them.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s a troll himself.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like the big troll fighting the little trolls.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the king troll.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million of them.</p>
<p>So even if you kill 100,000,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still not 100,000 left.</p>
<p>You just gotta ignore them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Nightwalker or whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll take it, because you had nothing,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t rose GSP out of respect, too.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to take that as a sign of respect.</p>
<p>What do you say bad about GSP?</p>
<p>Now I try to rose his hair.</p>
<p>Like, why are you trying to grow hair now</p>
<p>after all these years?</p>
<p>He looked good, bald.</p>
<p>Everyone loved him with his head shaved.</p>
<p>Now it looks kind of strange.</p>
<p>Like, why you got hair now?</p>
<p>Well, it was one of the more surreal moments of my life.</p>
<p>So he was here and he wore a black suit and tie.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Yeah, we did the podcast with him,</p>
<p>just mirror image of me.</p>
<p>And then we also did, I haven&rsquo;t released it yet,</p>
<p>but just the video together.</p>
<p>And I was doing a martial arts stuff in a suit and tie.</p>
<p>That was quite,</p>
<p>that was quite, that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>like certain moments in your life are just like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I was part of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, with GSP, so yeah,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have anything to rose him about.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe the Matt Serra thing</p>
<p>would be the one that you could get him with, you know?</p>
<p>I would be really fascinated,</p>
<p>like really dig deep from a sports psychology standpoint,</p>
<p>because he always talks about how much fear he had</p>
<p>when he was competing.</p>
<p>And I find that to be interesting because obviously,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s almost like, to me, it&rsquo;s almost like,</p>
<p>was he successful despite that?</p>
<p>Not because of that, right?</p>
<p>And because anxiety usually leads</p>
<p>to really negative performance for the majority of people.</p>
<p>And what was it about him</p>
<p>that the anxiety wasn&rsquo;t super negative?</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I wonder that too.</p>
<p>So I have, I wondered that about him,</p>
<p>but I have a huge amount of anxiety interacting,</p>
<p>especially with people, just about everything, yeah.</p>
<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s helpful or not.</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s very helpful.</p>
<p>Well, I think, so okay, I think in two different ways.</p>
<p>So I think probably your everyday life, okay,</p>
<p>is different than like in a performance or a competition.</p>
<p>You have to be like super in the moment</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So anything that&rsquo;s pulling you away,</p>
<p>like, oh my gosh, you know,</p>
<p>for high school kids, right, that coach.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, that girl&rsquo;s in the stands,</p>
<p>and if I get beat, then,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actively thinking about this other thing</p>
<p>when this is going on.</p>
<p>And I need 100% of your focus right here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s never, I don&rsquo;t think he has anxiety in the ring.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>I think, like, I have the same thing.</p>
<p>Like if I have a really high performance thing</p>
<p>that I have to do, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a lecture in front of a lot of people.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;d be a great example.</p>
<p>That, there&rsquo;s huge amount of anxiety weeks ahead,</p>
<p>days ahead, hours ahead.</p>
<p>So you have a system to get rid of it then?</p>
<p>As you perform. No, maybe,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just the body gets rid of it somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s not a system.</p>
<p>Subconscious system.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s self preservation.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t actually have anxiety</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re performing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like, so then that problem,</p>
<p>somehow that problem has solved itself, right?</p>
<p>The problem is when the anxiety is actually happening</p>
<p>while the wrestling match is happening,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real issue.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it like sneaks in there too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference, you know, MMA and wrestling</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s no breaks in wrestling, right?</p>
<p>I guess there is, you can look at the crowd a little bit,</p>
<p>like you can look, so maybe,</p>
<p>but like the, there&rsquo;s other things we have to perform.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s more breaks, like a lecture,</p>
<p>you can catch yourself thinking,</p>
<p>like in this conversation, you know,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve said a bunch of stuff where I think,</p>
<p>why the hell did you say that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s dumb, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the anxiety because there&rsquo;s a pause</p>
<p>and that could be, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I think it just pushes me to be better,</p>
<p>but maybe I could be way better if I let go of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary to think that GSB, if you let go of that,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Could he have been better?</p>
<p>Or did he ever, did he have a,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re saying like, you don&rsquo;t necessarily feel those.</p>
<p>So I think certain people that I&rsquo;ve coached,</p>
<p>like they would describe how they would feel</p>
<p>literally during the wrestling match, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying like during the speech performance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mostly gone.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s interesting to see if like,</p>
<p>he talked a lot about that,</p>
<p>but if it was all the way somehow gone,</p>
<p>and it means he would have a mechanism for it.</p>
<p>So like I had a really bad performance</p>
<p>my freshman year of high school at nationals,</p>
<p>cause I had the ability to be anxious.</p>
<p>And one of my coaches talked about like,</p>
<p>and a lot of A type personalities are kind of that way,</p>
<p>you know, because they&rsquo;re trying to consider</p>
<p>all possibilities at the same time.</p>
<p>And while we&rsquo;re actually performing or competing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s negative to performance, right?</p>
<p>So he said he would always leading up to the match</p>
<p>within say an hour, his name was talking about fishing.</p>
<p>He would get someone to talk about fishing with him</p>
<p>because it would stop him thinking about the match</p>
<p>and being uber anxious.</p>
<p>So I kind of took it to heart and it really helped me</p>
<p>as I would always like have someone to talk to</p>
<p>and just goof around about whatever.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not thinking about this thing.</p>
<p>And then once I step in, it&rsquo;s time to go.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t have this like anxious buildup.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s how for me, I took it away, but like me,</p>
<p>you know, like you said, you have a way to get it away,</p>
<p>obviously, cause it&rsquo;s there and then it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess so, I guess there&rsquo;s a little tricks</p>
<p>you come up with.</p>
<p>Yeah, you start thinking about it&rsquo;s not fishing,</p>
<p>maybe I should try the fishing thing.</p>
<p>I hate fishing, so boring.</p>
<p>But maybe it&rsquo;s good to think about that.</p>
<p>All right, Ben, this is, like I told you, I&rsquo;m a big fan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of your wrestling, your fighting,</p>
<p>your personality.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming down.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>Appreciate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor.</p>
<p>Bam, let&rsquo;s go wrestle.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ben Askren.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p>Only a man who knows what it is like to be defeated</p>
<p>can reach down to the bottom of his soul</p>
<p>and come up with the extra ounce of power it takes</p>
