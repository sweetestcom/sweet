I like it.
I like it.
Thank you.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to do something completely different.

    <p>Are we ready for me to clap us in?</p>
<p>We are ready for you to clap us in.</p>
<p>Clap us in.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s end of the year claps, so it&rsquo;s got to be a really good banger.</p>
<p>Okay, let me think.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re going to do something completely different.</p>
<p>Do you remember in the 80s when we were growing up and you would go to the skating rink?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have couple skate and you&rsquo;d have backwards skate and then you would have a free skate.</p>
<p>Loved a free skate.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is going to be a free skate.</p>
<p>We are going to free ball it, free skate it on all the shit that we&rsquo;ve had it with that</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t happened to have covered yet in this infancy stage of our fantastic podcast</p>
<p>about positive friendships and feedback and making people feel better about themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re going to do is we&rsquo;re going to go around the room, producers included.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to list some things that we&rsquo;ve had it with because this is our end of the</p>
<p>year wrap up.</p>
<p>Hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to do this annually.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start first.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go around the room.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve absolutely had it with.</p>
<p>The phrase, there is no such thing as a stupid question that just sends you into orbit, orbit.</p>
<p>Stupid questions are ubiquitous.</p>
<p>They are fucking everywhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pull the room.</p>
<p>Have you had it with stupid questions?</p>
<p>Caveat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with people that ask stupid questions.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But what really infuriates me is when you&rsquo;re in a group setting, like at a seminar and</p>
<p>people ask them questions when we&rsquo;re trying to leave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like even if it&rsquo;s the smartest, best question that everybody wants to know the</p>
<p>answer to, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>So stupid questions.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m more fired up about the person at a meeting that continues to ask questions</p>
<p>when everybody else is right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be laboring the meeting, laboring, laboring the milling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m torn.</p>
<p>God damn it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a millennial.</p>
<p>So you were raised with unicorns and rainbows, popped up your ass all the fucking time.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You were told your whole life there&rsquo;s no such thing as a stupid question, weren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I mean, that entices people to ask the question when they actually need to ask the</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>There are stupid questions.</p>
<p>There are stupid questions.</p>
<p>Let me tell you an example of one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a stupid question?</p>
<p>I had a girl at work for me once and she said, yeah, this month is my birthday month.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>First of all, people who celebrate their birthday month had it, stop it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking one day.</p>
<p>Everybody has one day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no month about it.</p>
<p>Quit being such a fucking narcissist.</p>
<p>And after 21, nobody, you&rsquo;re just not dying.</p>
<p>And so anyway, she says on a Friday, she says, since Sunday is actually my official birthday</p>
<p>and on Monday I&rsquo;m going to be super hungover.</p>
<p>So can I come in late?</p>
<p>Cause this is a person who&rsquo;s probably been told her whole life.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t hurt to ask.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as a stupid question.</p>
<p>I think it was a stupid question.</p>
<p>I will always think it&rsquo;s a stupid question.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t announce to your boss that you&rsquo;re going to be hungover on Monday morning and</p>
<p>you would like to come in late so that your boss can accommodate your hangover.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>But there is a saying, a closed mouth never gets fed.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t ask the question, you&rsquo;ll never know the answer.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s, this is my problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a saying though, there are no stupid questions.</p>
<p>Only stupid people who ask them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of cynicism I need right now.</p>
<p>A good old Gen Xer to come in and just deflate the millennial.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Richard, what do you think about stupid questions?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with pumps.</p>
<p>I think I prefer people to ask a stupid question instead of giving me a stupid result, especially</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m transitioning back to the corporate world.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in training and then it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been like eight hours.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go home.</p>
<p>Any question you have right now does not apply.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in training.</p>
<p>So just save it till tomorrow.</p>
<p>Write it down.</p>
<p>Text yourself.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Email.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just please, please just shut up.</p>
<p>The trainer wants to go home.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Your turn pumps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with people that leave voicemails that are long.</p>
<p>I mean, you can tell me in under 15 seconds what you need to tell me on a voicemail.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need all the bullshit backstory, context, whatever.</p>
<p>And then what really sends me into orbit is that deal where you record yourself while</p>
<p>texting and then it sends what you&rsquo;re saying, what your voice is saying.</p>
<p>Voice text.</p>
<p>It is the biggest beat down on the planet.</p>
<p>I have a friend that religiously does it.</p>
<p>I refuse to listen to him.</p>
<p>I will not.</p>
<p>And then she&rsquo;ll call me and be like, I&rsquo;m like, you sent me a voice text.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not listening to that.</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t take it and that&rsquo;s too much information, too much information.</p>
<p>And then somebody who sends a voice memo as a text instead of typing out the text,</p>
<p>correct?</p>
<p>Placing the phone call.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>I can say that I can add to this genre of grievances and I can say that I&rsquo;ve absolutely</p>
<p>fucking had it with a person who I have programmed into my phone.</p>
<p>Their name is programmed, right?</p>
<p>So when the text comes, I know exactly who it&rsquo;s from.</p>
<p>Then they send me the message and then they put their initials at the end of the or name.</p>
<p>It is the, an extreme level of fucking narcissism that, Oh, I&rsquo;ve got people that do it.</p>
<p>Not tech.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Sign their text messages.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>First of all, the only person like who does that shit is like Barack Obama.</p>
<p>When he would tweet personally, he would sign his tweet, B O Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Well, then you just have fucking Larry and Joe and Curly over here that are self-appointed</p>
<p>celebrities in their hometown that have started signing text messages.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, listen up, dumb shit.</p>
<p>We know who you are because your numbers program, you don&rsquo;t need to take the extra time to sign</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And it really chops my hide.</p>
<p>Nellie, what do you think about this subject?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like voicemails.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>I think voicemails should be extinct.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t need them.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>In terms of voice texts, I don&rsquo;t do it, but I know a lot of people that do, they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have time to text.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just easier to speak and multitask as they move about their day.</p>
<p>Then do Siri that have Siri do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Siri.</p>
<p>Siri.</p>
<p>Jen.</p>
<p>Voicemails.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really mind because I don&rsquo;t like talking on the phone.</p>
<p>So if it gets me out of a phone call, I&rsquo;m happy with the voicemail.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Signing initials.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that really bothers me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start doing it and then I&rsquo;ll circle back with you and see if it, right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to, I&rsquo;m going to start signing JW and I&rsquo;m going to do a dash JW after every</p>
<p>single time.</p>
<p>Hey Jen, how&rsquo;s your day today?</p>
<p>Dash JW.</p>
<p>You want to go grab a coffee?</p>
<p>Dash JW.</p>
<p>Nellie, grievance.</p>
<p>What have you had it with?</p>
<p>People who chew gum in public, loud chewing and popping.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>I think I could be an offender.</p>
<p>I think I, cause I chew nicotine gum like crazy.</p>
<p>Am I loud?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t like, I haven&rsquo;t noticed you.</p>
<p>I have, I have friends that I&rsquo;m like, I want to kill.</p>
<p>So you haven&rsquo;t felt that anger towards me?</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t felt that.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m deeply addicted to nicotine gum.</p>
<p>I know that you are, but it&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If I ever am, you have to tell me.</p>
<p>I fucking go to town on the bubbles, the little bubbles, the big bubbles, all the bubbles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you this much.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t chew virgin gum, so it doesn&rsquo;t interest me at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t chew virgin gum.</p>
<p>I have to chew gum that has a stimulant in it.</p>
<p>Stimulant is nicotine.</p>
<p>Otherwise I don&rsquo;t want it, but I do sometimes kind of, I can pop it.</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It is kind of, I don&rsquo;t blow bubbles with it, but I can kind of make it pop in the back</p>
<p>of my mouth.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s super satisfying.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>But at the same time that I&rsquo;m popping it, the nicotine is soaking into my body.</p>
<p>Into your teeth and your gums.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucking awful.</p>
<p>But hey, listen, I haven&rsquo;t smoked.</p>
<p>Cigarettes disgust me now completely, but pumps and I used to just chain smoke.</p>
<p>Oh God, it was horrible and awesome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fun.</p>
<p>It was so fun.</p>
<p>Smoking was so fun.</p>
<p>Those were the days.</p>
<p>Smoking a cigarette with a friend.</p>
<p>The best part about it was like, Oh my God, I got to tell you something.</p>
<p>We would light up and the story would be so good, pumps would go, okay, let&rsquo;s double</p>
<p>shot.</p>
<p>And that meant smoke another one.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re going to take two shots.</p>
<p>We would double shot.</p>
<p>You do a lot of Euro trips.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you crave a cigarette out there?</p>
<p>I smoke when I&rsquo;m in Europe.</p>
<p>The first couple of times, so I quit smoking in 2015 and the first couple of trips that</p>
<p>I took, because if you smoke cigarettes in the United States of America, you feel like</p>
<p>the biggest white trash, loser motherfucker on the planet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re easier on heroin.</p>
<p>In Europe, it&rsquo;s like chic and cool and they&rsquo;re all doing it.</p>
<p>It was kind of hard.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m completely past all of that and I&rsquo;m solely into the gum, but, and, and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really, when I smell it and stuff, I&rsquo;m kind of like, ugh, like I have zero desire to smoke</p>
<p>a cigarette.</p>
<p>All right, Jen, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>What have you had it with?</p>
<p>The world cup.</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on with the world cup?</p>
<p>Every country in the world calls it football.</p>
<p>Except us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Except us.</p>
<p>So during these games, these Americans get together and they chant, it&rsquo;s called soccer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Why do we have to be so ethnocentric?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t you just go to a country where it&rsquo;s called football?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Which technically makes more sense, which is football, American football.</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t use their feet.</p>
<p>And actually I think if it touches your feet, it&rsquo;s more football.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called soccer.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s the biggest sport in the world, which everybody calls one thing, except</p>
<p>for us.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s the biggest sport in the world, except for here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not even something that we care about that much.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We only care during the world cup.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>Elon Musk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Motherfucker.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t get about Elon Musk.</p>
<p>So you have this green energy, right?</p>
<p>Conservatives aren&rsquo;t big purchasers of plug in cars, electric cars, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, so it&rsquo;s mainly like environmentally, you know, conscious people that are going</p>
<p>to buy a Tesla or buy a solar panel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his market, right?</p>
<p>So then he goes off the rails and is like paddling around with Trump and Kanye West</p>
<p>and carrying the sink into Twitter and all this shit.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t quite understand the business plan because it seems like he&rsquo;s alienating</p>
<p>both sides because now there&rsquo;s no liberal or progressive person that&rsquo;s going to buy</p>
<p>a fucking Tesla.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s ruined that brand.</p>
<p>Conservatives aren&rsquo;t going to buy it because for them, that&rsquo;s a pussy car.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a pussy snow, no, they don&rsquo;t care because global warming isn&rsquo;t real to them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what a pussy snowflake would drive.</p>
<p>So they wouldn&rsquo;t be caught dead.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>What is he thinking with all of that?</p>
<p>Number one, and number two, if I had that much goddamn money, as much as I enjoy doing</p>
<p>this podcast, I&rsquo;m going to have, I mean, I&rsquo;m probably going to have an Instagram that is</p>
<p>completely private, buttoned up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really doing anything with the exception of maybe three to four people.</p>
<p>I might add a couple of French bulldogs to the collection, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I think the whole thing about him that drives me crazy, first of all, he&rsquo;s a DOG dog, but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s Mr. Free Speech.</p>
<p>Free speech does not include hate speech, and free speech is a guarantee in the constitution</p>
<p>by the government.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to grant you free speech, it just goes all through me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also doing free speech unless you make fun of him.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What a titty baby.</p>
<p>His penis is probably that big.</p>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very reminiscent of our former president.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Both weird shaped or very small penises, you can tell.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>So your theory is they have a weird shape or small penis.</p>
<p>We know he has a weird shape because Stormy Daniels, and she would know, she blew the</p>
<p>whistle on Trump&rsquo;s penis.</p>
<p>What did she say?</p>
<p>It was almond.</p>
<p>Mushroom.</p>
<p>Mushroom.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So both those men scream inadequate penises.</p>
<p>Inadequate penises.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any doubt about that.</p>
<p>Richard, what do you think of Elon Musk?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really a fan.</p>
<p>Jen said it.</p>
<p>He claims he&rsquo;s for free speech until people make fun of him.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Doing the rules of this free skate.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re free balling it, we&rsquo;re free skating.</p>
<p>You can phone a friend.</p>
<p>You can have a lifeline.</p>
<p>So right now I&rsquo;m going to offer to the free skaters, does anybody want to make fun of</p>
<p>Elon Musk?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re debating, does anybody, would anybody like to use a lifeline?</p>
<p>I have a lifeline.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>I would like to use the lifeline.</p>
<p>Is it a couple skate or life line?</p>
<p>Nealie.</p>
<p>No it&rsquo;s a lifeline.</p>
<p>A lifeline.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What lifeline would you like to use?</p>
<p>I would love to phone up our friend.</p>
<p>Phone a friend.</p>
<p>Phone a friend.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Tell us who your friend is.</p>
<p>His name is Andrew Feldman.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And why would you like to phone Andrew?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like him to show you why.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Neilie&rsquo;s using her lifeline, we&rsquo;re phoning Andrew.</p>
<p>I love this Free Skate episode.</p>
<p>Hi Andrew.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hi Andrew.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>This is Angie, but we call her Pumps.</p>
<p>I think you know Jen and Nealie, and then we have a second.</p>
<p>Very, very well.</p>
<p>And as you can see, I combed my hair and took a shower for this.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very impressed.</p>
<p>We feel very privileged.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Nealie wanted to phone you.</p>
<p>Nealie, why don&rsquo;t you tell us why, why did we need to phone Andrew?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Andrew always has a laundry list of things he&rsquo;s had it with.</p>
<p>Andrew, let me tell you what we&rsquo;ve discussed so far.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Run it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>The thing I&rsquo;ve had it with is this phrase, there&rsquo;s no such thing as a stupid question.</p>
<p>As being a Jew, I&rsquo;m always tired of everything and complain about everything.</p>
<p>So yeah, this is right in my wheelhouse.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>So I see it.</p>
<p>I mean, off the top, what I&rsquo;m just, you know, what am I fed up with and tired of?</p>
<p>You know, Hollywood, I&rsquo;m over it.</p>
<p>Because for example, I grew up, you know, watching, you know, grand movies, you know,</p>
<p>like the King and I, you know, dressing up in like a tuxedo with tails when I was three</p>
<p>or four.</p>
<p>Like when I turn on, you know, when I turn on like the Oscars, for example, where are</p>
<p>all the stars?</p>
<p>Like, where are they?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t exist anymore.</p>
<p>I mean, back in like the 90s, you used to have, you know, Sir Anthony Hopkins, I mean,</p>
<p>Robin Williams, I mean, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino.</p>
<p>All these people were always nominated.</p>
<p>Where are all the stars?</p>
<p>I mean, I watched something like the Oscars to escape from my miserable reality, not to</p>
<p>be reminded of it.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>What do you think about Elon Musk?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just tired of billionaires.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m tired of them.</p>
<p>I mean, look at what they&rsquo;re doing with their money.</p>
<p>I mean, even like the good billionaires, you know, why we always say, you know, why can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>billionaires, you know, try to like solve world hunger?</p>
<p>Bill Gates did, or he tried to.</p>
<p>I mean, Elon, I mean, yes, I mean, obviously, you know, he&rsquo;s done some things that have</p>
<p>been successful.</p>
<p>But I think he&rsquo;s probably at the end of the line should just, you know, shut up and go</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I mean, free, yes, I mean, free speech, I mean, he&rsquo;s, you know, bragging about free</p>
<p>speech and just another boob that free speech is only okay when it agrees with you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t we have enough of that already?</p>
<p>You know, you like you said, there&rsquo;s no such thing as a stupid question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sort of over that.</p>
<p>Of course, there is.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re getting ready for a lot more stupid if they&rsquo;re increased, you know, characters.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re normalizing stupid and praising stupidity.</p>
<p>Listen, I mean, yeah, expertise and the love of expertise has, you know, flat out gone</p>
<p>out the window.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, Dr. Fauci tells me to take a shot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take a shot.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because, you know, for whatever reason, this guy, you know, decided for 30 years to all</p>
<p>he does is study this.</p>
<p>If I studied something like that for 30 years, I like to think that I would know a thing</p>
<p>or two about it.</p>
<p>I listened to him, not my friends on Facebook or the Internet or whatever.</p>
<p>I listened to that guy.</p>
<p>I have a solution for that.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my solution.</p>
<p>All of the people that get their medical advice from Facebook, there should be at the hospital</p>
<p>in the parking lot, Facebook tents with the people that post this stuff.</p>
<p>And if you get sick, you have to go to the Facebook doctors in the parking lot in the</p>
<p>tent of the hospital.</p>
<p>And the people who want to go to a medical professional who have studied this get to</p>
<p>go into the hospital.</p>
<p>And I just think that&rsquo;s the way we need to play it moving forward.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I just think if you&rsquo;re going to listen to Facebook, you go to Facebook doctors.</p>
<p>And I think I think it could solve a lot of problems.</p>
<p>All the stupid questions would be at those tents, a Facebook tent with Facebook doctors.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, it&rsquo;s like because here&rsquo;s the thing that cracked me up about the shots.</p>
<p>People would be like, I&rsquo;m not getting the shot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s in it.</p>
<p>I mean, that motherfucker sitting there drinking Mountain Dew and it&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>know what&rsquo;s in that Mountain Dew that you&rsquo;re drinking, do you?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s in it.</p>
<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s in it.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, people work like, you know, 24 hours a day for like six straight months.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, in a lab to put it together, I mean, to save us, I don&rsquo;t care what&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t care what&rsquo;s in it.</p>
<p>I put a lot more ridiculous things in my body in the last hour prepping for this shot of</p>
<p>COVID.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>My God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing compared to that.</p>
<p>No, absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, Andrew, here&rsquo;s my, I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Voicemails that are too long.</p>
<p>People leaving forever ending voicemails and then voice texting where they leave you a</p>
<p>voicemail on your text stream.</p>
<p>What do you think about those two things?</p>
<p>So the, so the first one, I actually, I like to, for people&rsquo;s birthdays, I like to leave</p>
<p>messages and I&rsquo;ll rhyme their age with something that&rsquo;s like sort of, you know, funny or whatever</p>
<p>acute.</p>
<p>And so I believe I&rsquo;ve, you know, left a message, a birthday message or two for some folks in</p>
<p>the room there, but like that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, I actually like doing that, but I will say the, the voice memos, um, uh, you</p>
<p>know, thing in, in the text messages have to stop my brother, but I got two brothers.</p>
<p>I love both of them.</p>
<p>I like one of them more.</p>
<p>The one that I liked the least, uh, doesn&rsquo;t all the time and it just has to stop.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not playing these things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what you say to sound like you&rsquo;re walking and huffing and puffing to the subway</p>
<p>enough.</p>
<p>I mean, it can obviously wait, but I totally agree with the voice memos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely horrible.</p>
<p>Horrible.</p>
<p>Let me ask the group about this in our free skate episode.</p>
<p>I saw an article in the news that said the national park services have, are advising</p>
<p>people not to lick psychedelic toads.</p>
<p>Several things I immediately think is now they&rsquo;re going to have a bunch of crazy motherfuckers</p>
<p>going to the national park to lick the psychedelic toads because without the announcement, the</p>
<p>frogs were safer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They had no clue.</p>
<p>Why would they put national park services through these toads under the fucking bus</p>
<p>by making this announcement?</p>
<p>Why would they inform everybody that toads are psychedelic?</p>
<p>I had no idea.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>I mean, I got to believe park attendance is down, right?</p>
<p>Revenue shrinks, baby.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, something.</p>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t believe that they announced it.</p>
<p>Did you all see that in the news?</p>
<p>I did, but now I want to try it now that I know.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>We need to go trap Simon and take him to Burning Man next year.</p>
<p>Let me ask you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be freaked.</p>
<p>Burning Man.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s gross.</p>
<p>I mean, they said, I mean, please take a shower after this episode because they saw dirt rubbing</p>
<p>off of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken them 60 days to get the whole thing fucking cleaned up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot like coal mining.</p>
<p>You come home and you can&rsquo;t wash it off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just gross.</p>
<p>Not that this has anything to do with toads, but the tea sort of reminded me of this.</p>
<p>So when a few months ago or maybe a year ago when Starbucks changed to like paper straws</p>
<p>because of the turtles, I&rsquo;ve never met a wild turtle.</p>
<p>I could give an F about the freaking turtles.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that my straw, you know, gets soggy, you know, before halfway through</p>
<p>ridiculous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>I will kill a few hundreds of thousands of turtles with a straw.</p>
<p>For a straw.</p>
<p>For having plastic straw.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge straw person, but I mean, it&rsquo;s like they get like limp and flaccid in the</p>
<p>drink.</p>
<p>Does anybody consider in making a straw that it would get wet eventually?</p>
<p>And I live in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough going on in my bedroom with that.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I can&rsquo;t stand paper straws.</p>
<p>They should be banned from the plant.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me throw this out there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just free ball this.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another thing that really chaps my heart and gets me all worked up.</p>
<p>The phrase, everything happens for a reason.</p>
<p>I think is bullshit.</p>
<p>I think it is the biggest.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it is bullshit.</p>
<p>I think it is the biggest bunch.</p>
<p>I think it is a jet stream of bullshit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any truth to it.</p>
<p>I think it is so dumb.</p>
<p>Andrew, what do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would agree.</p>
<p>I would agree.</p>
<p>I, I, one of the, the healthier people I know in my life recently, you know, passed away</p>
<p>from cancer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, there, there is no good reason for that.</p>
<p>There is, there is no good reason.</p>
<p>Not everything, you know, happens for a reason.</p>
<p>Some things are just unexplainable and fucked up.</p>
<p>Some things are fucked up.</p>
<p>Shit happens to nice people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no reason.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to have an explanation.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to have an explanation for these things.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes I totally agree with that.</p>
<p>Life can be cruel and random and unfair.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Good people get fucked over all the time.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s no good reason, bad reason or reason for that.</p>
<p>But shitty people get away with stuff all the time.</p>
<p>Not mentioning any names, but think about DJT, you know, people get away with just a</p>
<p>bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, listen, stupid is stupid is stupid.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s plenty of people out there today proving that.</p>
<p>I mean, if they would have been told once or twice that, you know, they were stupid</p>
<p>earlier on, maybe they&rsquo;d be, you know, I had it with slow drivers in the left lane.</p>
<p>No problem with you driving slow.</p>
<p>Just get the F out of my way and I&rsquo;ll move over for a guy driving faster than me.</p>
<p>You want in the right or middle, but never in the left.</p>
<p>When I pass you, I&rsquo;m making it more dangerous for everybody.</p>
<p>Slow walkers.</p>
<p>I mean, I personally have always ever, I am never walking for leisure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really do leisure activities when I&rsquo;m walking.</p>
<p>I want a place to be.</p>
<p>So please, like, you know, step aside or like, you know, when you feel me coming, because</p>
<p>you can feel me coming, move.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re, this is the same thing that I&rsquo;ve sort of had it with is that we&rsquo;re Jews.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of, you know, Christmas decorations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
<p>I mean, we have a couple of, you know, candy canes up in our house.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, separation between, you know, church and church.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s, let me jump on that really quick because I am not a religious person at all,</p>
<p>but I celebrate Christmas, but I&rsquo;m not of any faith.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a non, I&rsquo;m in the non category, but I do celebrate Christmas.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve absolutely had it with is everybody claiming that there&rsquo;s a war on Christmas and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just total bullshit.</p>
<p>Christmas won.</p>
<p>It won.</p>
<p>Yeah, what war?</p>
<p>You know, everybody&rsquo;s claiming there was this big war.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no war on Christmas.</p>
<p>Christmas won.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already stolen Thanksgiving&rsquo;s vendor.</p>
<p>It has.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, so, I mean, the war on Christmas does not exist.</p>
<p>In fact, it was actually, I believe, you know, a bunch of Jews that wrote all the famous</p>
<p>Christmas songs.</p>
<p>I mean, back in the day, I mean, if you look it up, I think now to go to, to, to go to</p>
<p>sports, you know, for a little bit, I watch a whole ton of sports.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m such a horrible athlete, but I love watching sports.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And one of the things that is an issue for me is that all this technology, right, they</p>
<p>literally in tennis, right at Wimbledon or US Open, you can like tell if a ball is going</p>
<p>in or out.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I watched the NFL every Sunday, like so often, you know, every time the referee comes back,</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>And it says the call in the field, you know, stands not confirmed, confirm it.</p>
<p>There are a thousand cameras.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much technology.</p>
<p>Confirm the call and stand by it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a crap call, just stand by it.</p>
<p>Stand by it.</p>
<p>None of this stands up.</p>
<p>I mean, we live in, you know, a black and white, you know, world when it comes to that.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve got the technology used, right?</p>
<p>I, I a hundred percent agree.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;ve even talked about that in tennis, like one little tiny bit is on the white line.</p>
<p>You can see it.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you spot a first down appropriately in football?</p>
<p>It makes sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>I mean, these, these got these NFL refs.</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t have, they are, they don&rsquo;t have full-time jobs.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t study the yearbook year round.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously the NFL is still making a whole crap ton of money, so they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>care.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, it just takes away from the game.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Take up too much of your time.</p>
<p>And by the way, we loved it.</p>
<p>You are a woman of a certain age and I have a thing for so gorgeous.</p>
<p>So this has been a nice little pick me up is he&rsquo;s got mommy issues.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>She just passed away from cancer.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>That was okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But that was a good joke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with the city of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I hate it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on in Philly?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>So I just had it with the city of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>One, the bell is broken.</p>
<p>Does not work.</p>
<p>How long has it been broken?</p>
<p>The Liberty Bell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been broken forever.</p>
<p>The Liberty Bell.</p>
<p>Oh, the Liberty Bell.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a dumb question right here.</p>
<p>We just had one.</p>
<p>Guilty.</p>
<p>Guilty.</p>
<p>Guilty.</p>
<p>Guilty.</p>
<p>I mean, commitment, commitment to the cast.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So yeah, the bell is broken.</p>
<p>You know, Rocky, they have a real statute for a fake boxer.</p>
<p>It was fake.</p>
<p>Like, real life, you know, exists.</p>
<p>It was a made up story.</p>
<p>They have a statue right in front of a really good art museum that nobody ever goes to only</p>
<p>to take a photo with that stupid, you know, statue right in front of it.</p>
<p>Of a fictional character.</p>
<p>Of something that was fake.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And lastly, if they expect me to believe that they were the first group of people to put</p>
<p>cheese on a steak sandwich, I&rsquo;m calling bullshit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just calling bullshit.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, I mean, it&rsquo;s the reason why, like, 74 percent of, you know, America</p>
<p>is obese.</p>
<p>Is sandwiches like that.</p>
<p>Secondly, I mean, you know, in terms of sandwiches, I&rsquo;ll take a bagel with lox any day over that</p>
<p>crap.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just, overall, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just, I had it with that entire place from</p>
<p>top to bottom.</p>
<p>This speech has been going on, like, we&rsquo;ve heard this several times.</p>
<p>Philadelphia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you go right after this.</p>
<p>I just have to tell you that.</p>
<p>So, Rocky Balboa, Sylvester Stallone, he just finished shooting a TV show in Tulsa.</p>
<p>Oh, Tulsa, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Tulsa Kings, I think.</p>
<p>Tulsa Kings, yeah.</p>
<p>Everyone that was around him said he is the biggest motherfucking asshole on the planet.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not friendly.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s demanding, entitled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like never heard more people gripe about one person ever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that before, too, and it&rsquo;s shitty, right?</p>
<p>Because didn&rsquo;t he start his Hollywood journey by having to sell his dog and then buy it</p>
<p>back for like, you know, he bought it back for like four times the amount he sold it</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>He had to, he had to sell his dog to, to, to, to, for, for money to like eat or for</p>
<p>food to, for a few hundred dollars and then bought it back after he became rich from the</p>
<p>same person for like $40,000.</p>
<p>Like you would think somebody that had that little, would be a little more mindful.</p>
<p>How long, how long did they, how long did the other person have the dog?</p>
<p>Only a few years, but then he blew up right after Rocky.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Also, the thing about Rocky is like, it&rsquo;s like the first, you know, it&rsquo;s like the, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s one of the only movies that is set entirely in English that I need subtitles</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, I just can&rsquo;t understand what he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>Plus on the waterfront with Marlon Brando, it&rsquo;s the exact same story 40 years before</p>
<p>and he just did it better because he&rsquo;s Brando.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Andrew, I have to say you&rsquo;ve been an absolute joy.</p>
<p>Your cynicism and the shit you&rsquo;ve had it with is like tap my veins and inject that shit</p>
<p>right in it.</p>
<p>And then I would back it up with a snort.</p>
<p>That kind of shit just fuels my fire.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>You might have to be like a monthly commentator.</p>
<p>Maybe I have a thing for Jewish men.</p>
<p>I love Larry David.</p>
<p>I love Andrew.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just bitch about shit.</p>
<p>Are you hitting on Andrew?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you know he&rsquo;s married?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, you know, quite right.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s been great, but this is actually what they taught us in the Hebrew</p>
<p>school was things that you&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this Jewish contract, a marriage contract called a get to look that the man and the</p>
<p>woman sign.</p>
<p>And in that, you know, it says that you are not the man is not allowed to have it, you</p>
<p>know, have had it with anything anymore, ever.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like you give that up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>So, but to get it out here, it&rsquo;s just so great.</p>
<p>That way I don&rsquo;t have to get it all out upstairs, which she&rsquo;s tired of it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>Maybe one day we will meet up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll do a live podcast, but it won&rsquo;t be in fucking Philly.</p>
<p>I can.</p>
<p>No, it will not be.</p>
<p>Rest assured that.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve so enjoyed.</p>
<p>It was such a pleasure.</p>
<p>Oh, the pleasure was, was, you know, all mine.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for, for inviting me and taking the time.</p>
<p>This was a, this was a real treat.</p>
<p>I absolutely loved it.</p>
<p>And I, you know, hearing, you know, the shout outs that the podcast has been getting and,</p>
<p>you know, listen, my wife has been listening to a whole bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it&rsquo;s going great and I wish you all the luck.</p>
<p>This is absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Casey.</p>
<p>Thanks for jumping.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I loved Andrew Neely.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Your phone.</p>
<p>A friend was five stars, five stars off the chart, obsessed with Andrew.</p>
<p>That kind of just how he has had it with shit is just fucking drugs in my veins.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>So fun.</p>
<p>Hey, what a great year.</p>
<p>So much fun.</p>
<p>What a fun venture that I&rsquo;ve had at podcast has been.</p>
<p>I want to thank my co-host pumps who, you know, I love more than anything on the planet.</p>
<p>My soulmate, my sister, wife, the love of my life, Angela Dawn, Jen Morton, Neely.</p>
<p>We love you girls so much.</p>
<p>This has been so fun.</p>
<p>Richard, we love all of your input and all of the wonderful things you do to make us</p>
<p>sound great and the whole breast milk thing.</p>
<p>But we can talk about that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to come out of Richard&rsquo;s Pandora&rsquo;s box next time?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Next year.</p>
<p>So anyway, I think what we can say now is what pumps see you next Tuesday, a new year,</p>
<p>a new Tuesday, a new grievance, a new cut, subscribe, like do all the stuff, do all the</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
