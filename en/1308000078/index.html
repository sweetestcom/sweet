    <p>All right, what? Oh, I&rsquo;m doing this again. All right, listen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a two parter you read you listen to the first part. Now</p>
<p>this is the second part, Episode 76.5. If you will, this</p>
<p>is our first ever two parter part two of our two parter. You</p>
<p>already listened to part one of Episode 76. That&rsquo;s Ilan and</p>
<p>Twitter. Lots of details there. And now we&rsquo;re going to cover</p>
<p>some more topics including the global food crisis, China&rsquo;s</p>
<p>plan to stockpile a bunch of food geopolitics while around</p>
<p>the horn, French election, Germany, etc. And then we&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>into details about a little bit of the drama and details,</p>
<p>pageant tea parties, poker, all the good stuff of the all in</p>
<p>summit. Coming soon. Okay, enjoy the show. I&rsquo;ll see you on</p>
<p>the rain man David. There&rsquo;s still a war raging, but I</p>
<p>wanted to get an update from Friedberg on the food crisis,</p>
<p>which he predicted very early for a lot further. fertilizer</p>
<p>prices are still climbing like crazy. There&rsquo;s been some food</p>
<p>riding in China, which I think is a separate issue. He&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>educate us in a minute Sri Lanka. So what is your theory</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;re going to do from here, Friedberg, because I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all waiting for this shoe to drop. And I think you</p>
<p>predicted this is something that we would experience into the</p>
<p>fall and into next year. So when are we going to actually</p>
<p>see these food riots occurring? And then it&rsquo;s China&rsquo;s food</p>
<p>rights have anything to do with this? Or does that have to do</p>
<p>with they? Yeah, I think I would put the Chinese food riots as</p>
<p>kind of a separate localized supply chain problem related to</p>
<p>the lockdowns. But we&rsquo;re definitely, you know, I think I</p>
<p>mentioned last week, the USDA planting report showing in the</p>
<p>US how acreage is being reduced on corn. And, and we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>this around the world where acres are coming out of</p>
<p>production, or less fertilizers being used, which means less</p>
<p>foods being made. So everything that we predicted, I mean, this</p>
<p>is a slow train, a Titanic into the iceberg that we&rsquo;re watching</p>
<p>right now. And it&rsquo;s going to continue for nine to 18 months.</p>
<p>So, you know, one of the questions that people are now</p>
<p>asking, which I said, you know, would become a really critical</p>
<p>next step in this crisis, is how are we going to bridge the gap</p>
<p>in calories? Where&rsquo;s the food going to come from? And how are</p>
<p>we going to feed nations that are almost entirely dependent on</p>
<p>imports that are running out of food, or out of food. So I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>mentioned this in the past, the whole world runs on a 90 day food</p>
<p>supply, which means roughly 25% of the world&rsquo;s calories are in</p>
<p>storage right now. But that&rsquo;s not the case, uniformly. So some</p>
<p>countries like Tunisia and Somalia, Ethiopia, have close to</p>
<p>zero calories in storage. Some countries, like the United</p>
<p>States are roughly, you know, 30 40% of our, you know, annual</p>
<p>consumed calories are sitting in storage. China is a complete</p>
<p>outlier. For years, China has been stockpiling food. And at</p>
<p>this point, China has 150% of their annual consumption of food</p>
<p>in storage. So they have supplies that if all food</p>
<p>production and import stopped in China, they would be able to</p>
<p>feed their population for one and a half years. That&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>incredible supply of food. So if you look around the world to</p>
<p>places like Sri Lanka and places like Somalia that are</p>
<p>struggling to figure out how are we going to bridge this gap</p>
<p>on calories that&rsquo;s about to hit us Egypt&rsquo;s about four months of</p>
<p>food, by the way, and Egypt is dwindling, they cannot get the</p>
<p>food out of the Black Sea. So China is going to be one of the</p>
<p>very few potential solutions for bridging the calorie gap over</p>
<p>the next year. And I have a strong prediction and a strong</p>
<p>belief that because of that, China will use it to maximal</p>
<p>leverage. And we will see over the next year, an incredible</p>
<p>amount of leverage and power being accumulated by China,</p>
<p>because of transactions that they&rsquo;re going to start to enter</p>
<p>into to bridge the calorie gap around the world. So in the horn</p>
<p>of Africa, for example, there has been this continuous</p>
<p>presence of China, trying to give themselves a military base</p>
<p>trying to take some influence over local media. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been this kind of push and pull with, you know, certain</p>
<p>populations around whether or not we should kind of embrace</p>
<p>China locally. And I think that, for example, the the food</p>
<p>crisis that we&rsquo;re seeing emerge in Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea,</p>
<p>Djibouti, is going to be resolved by China. And China is</p>
<p>going to end up gaining influence, gaining military</p>
<p>presence, and establishing a more permanent foothold in the</p>
<p>horn of Africa, because of the position that they&rsquo;re in of</p>
<p>strength with all these calories, and the and the need</p>
<p>in these regions. That&rsquo;s not just their Sri Lanka, other</p>
<p>parts of Southeast Asia, even Western Africa, Northern Africa,</p>
<p>China is going to show up. And they&rsquo;re the only country that</p>
<p>can show up the UN, the World Food Program, they&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>everything they can to shuffle calories around, change food</p>
<p>supplies. But I do think that one of the things that everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be watching, and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a slow roll, this isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to be some one big deal, and everyone wakes up over the</p>
<p>next year, while the US is, you know, trying to do everything we</p>
<p>can to maximally impose sanctions on Russia, China is</p>
<p>slowly turning the crank around the world on the influence that</p>
<p>they are going to gain, because of this food crisis, and the</p>
<p>absolute, you know, surplus that they have locally and the</p>
<p>ability to export that surplus to support needs around the</p>
<p>world, and it&rsquo;s not going to be free, it&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>cheap. So I thought it was worth highlighting what we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>And I shared a couple of articles with you guys. And with</p>
<p>Nick articles that no one is paying attention to. And this</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t some conspiratorial, oh, my God, there&rsquo;s some dangerous</p>
<p>thing happening. I&rsquo;m just pointing out one of the things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening as we talk about, you know, the great</p>
<p>change in power, the shift in power globally, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening. It is happening in a very significant way this year,</p>
<p>given the surplus that China has the dearth that many countries</p>
<p>have, and the inability for the US to really adequately respond</p>
<p>to the food crisis that&rsquo;s emerging. And so I thought it</p>
<p>was worth bringing to everyone&rsquo;s attention. There&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>little articles that support this point. I shared them with</p>
<p>you guys, you guys can put them in the show notes and, and put</p>
<p>them up on YouTube and whatever. But I think this is going to</p>
<p>become a macro trend that we&rsquo;re going to wake up to in six to</p>
<p>nine months and be like, Whoa, what the heck happened? You</p>
<p>know, how did China get so much leverage around the world? And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s starting now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happens with every war. You know, we all we go in</p>
<p>hot, you know, we, you know, rah, rah, we&rsquo;re all gung ho. And</p>
<p>then at some point in time, we&rsquo;re like, wait a second, why</p>
<p>do we do that? You know? And, you know, and look, there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>shortage of, of neocons and liberal interventionists are all</p>
<p>saying this war is wonderful for us, because it&rsquo;s reunited the</p>
<p>American Alliance and the Western Alliance. And that this</p>
<p>has been this war is a good thing for us. Let&rsquo;s keep it</p>
<p>going. Let&rsquo;s bleed Russia. Let&rsquo;s topple Putin. Let&rsquo;s stabilize</p>
<p>the regime. They&rsquo;re in favor of protracted conflict that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been, you know, warning against. And what Freeberg is saying is</p>
<p>the longer this conflict goes on, the more of these disastrous</p>
<p>scenarios are going to materialize.</p>
<p>What do you what is your take on how crippled Putin is right</p>
<p>now, David, just objectively, and again, you&rsquo;re not a fan of</p>
<p>Putin.</p>
<p>You listen, yeah, look, I don&rsquo;t have any, I just lost the ship.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, this does not look good for him. It feels like</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t and he&rsquo;s losing all his tanks. I mean, this seems like</p>
<p>a I don&rsquo;t know anything you don&rsquo;t know, in terms of, you</p>
<p>know, I&rsquo;m just a consumer of information. But I tend to think</p>
<p>that we are overly optimistic in the West. And look, the war has</p>
<p>clearly gone very bad for Putin. But this idea that everything</p>
<p>that magically, we&rsquo;re going to get regime change in Moscow,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to get Gorbachev 2.0. That that is that is an</p>
<p>objective worth protracting this war for, I tend to think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a mistake. I mean, that that&rsquo;s now doesn&rsquo;t mean I</p>
<p>support Russia&rsquo;s invasion. I&rsquo;ve said it&rsquo;s illegal. It&rsquo;s a crime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a violation of international law to</p>
<p>humanitarian disaster. But what I&rsquo;ve supported is a is a</p>
<p>negotiated peace, a settlement that we try to get as quickly as</p>
<p>possible. That is clearly not the administration&rsquo;s position on</p>
<p>this. They want to keep this thing going. And you know, this</p>
<p>idea that that a long war is good for America&rsquo;s alliances. I</p>
<p>would disagree with that, because you&rsquo;re already seeing all over</p>
<p>the world now people are starting to object to American</p>
<p>policy. You saw it with India. And India is the world&rsquo;s largest</p>
<p>democracy, they should be on our side, they definitely should not</p>
<p>be on China&rsquo;s side, because they have a huge, they&rsquo;re not late</p>
<p>intention. But China and India are both de facto on Russia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>side on this. Africa and large parts of Latin America would</p>
<p>like to have oil. And they would like to maintain their they would</p>
<p>like to maintain their relationship with Russia. And</p>
<p>they did not support the denunciation of Russia, they</p>
<p>would like to see this conflict and large parts of Africa would</p>
<p>like to see it and Latin America, basically all the</p>
<p>victims, if there&rsquo;s a famine in the world in six months, like</p>
<p>freeberg is saying, they are all very worried about this. All of</p>
<p>them have expressed concern with the American policy, which seems</p>
<p>to be retract this war.</p>
<p>Okay, and freeberg, you have to go do your talk at Berkeley.</p>
<p>Congratulations. And we&rsquo;ll see you next time. Thanks for the</p>
<p>contribution. Chamath, any thoughts on the CPI, we set a</p>
<p>record that seemed to have gotten lost in the haze of</p>
<p>Twitter. I learned something really interesting that I just</p>
<p>wanted to share with you guys. So there was a big CPI print,</p>
<p>obviously, but there was a report, probably not many people</p>
<p>read it. But it was about home equity. And the takeaway was</p>
<p>that since 2020, Americans have taken to 430, I think the exact</p>
<p>number is 427 $427 billion of home equity out of their homes</p>
<p>and effectively spent it. So what what it started to make me</p>
<p>think about was if you look at all of that home equity, plus</p>
<p>the stimmy checks, plus the unemployment insurance checks</p>
<p>that starts to explain, I think why the labor markets are so</p>
<p>tight, and why people haven&rsquo;t gone back to work, there is no</p>
<p>motivation, because there&rsquo;s just so much money sloshing around</p>
<p>for them to basically not have to be forced to do any of this</p>
<p>stuff that they don&rsquo;t want to anymore. And I think the the</p>
<p>thing to keep in mind is like, that&rsquo;s also what&rsquo;s gone into the</p>
<p>stock market. It&rsquo;s also what&rsquo;s driven up the price of used</p>
<p>cars, new cars, all of this stuff. I just think that kind of</p>
<p>like starts to paint a picture of CPI that&rsquo;s really important,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s probably a little bit more transitory than</p>
<p>we may actually think because when you exhaust all of that</p>
<p>extra money that dry powder, there&rsquo;s not as much inflation</p>
<p>to be had. And I think most people are now forecasting that</p>
<p>inflation is really going to taper off. And the big warning</p>
<p>sign that everybody is sort of, you know, marching towards is,</p>
<p>you know, too many excessive rate hikes between now and the</p>
<p>end of the year could actually push us into a real recession.</p>
<p>And we were talking about that before, but the probability is</p>
<p>now sort of like one in three. Whereas before, I think, you</p>
<p>know, David and I sounded a little bit crazy when we were</p>
<p>talking about it. So I just wanted to put that out there</p>
<p>as something I learned this week that I thought was really</p>
<p>important, worth the labor participation rate peaked at</p>
<p>67 68%. But half a trillion dollars. I mean, half a trillion</p>
<p>dollars of actual spending in the economy, that&rsquo;s a ton of</p>
<p>money to be absorbed, right? If people have a couple 100 grand</p>
<p>in their bank account who own homes or whatever, there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>need to go back to a job. And if you don&rsquo;t feel safe, because</p>
<p>you maybe still have some COVID fears, you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>commute, or you&rsquo;re just out of the rhythm for two years. And</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m kind of enjoying skiing, or whatever</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing, whatever your jam is, maybe there&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>rush to get back, you&rsquo;ll wait until you you&rsquo;ll wait until you</p>
<p>exhaust all of that money. This is a and then we&rsquo;re not, as we</p>
<p>talked about, we&rsquo;re not letting people into the country at the</p>
<p>same time. So you still have 10 million job openings. That</p>
<p>flips, that would be economic activity, that would be helpful</p>
<p>in fighting fighting against a recession, correct?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that that we&rsquo;re probably going to have a quarter</p>
<p>or two contraction, it&rsquo;s probably going to happen at sort</p>
<p>of at the late end of this year, beginning of next year, just the</p>
<p>real question is how, how high are rates between now and then.</p>
<p>And again, I think the setup isn&rsquo;t very good, which is that</p>
<p>the investors in the stock market are playing chicken with</p>
<p>the Fed. And, you know, they&rsquo;re just at the beginning of a rate</p>
<p>cycle, and they haven&rsquo;t been able to impact any real forms</p>
<p>of liquidity in the equity market. And so I think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>holding, they&rsquo;re gonna, they&rsquo;re going to attack that, and the</p>
<p>only blunt force instrument they have is rates. And so, you</p>
<p>know, you could see rates at three, three and a half percent,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s going to impact a lot of stuff. And the problem is</p>
<p>that, you know, it&rsquo;s going to be after the economy has slowed</p>
<p>down, because it&rsquo;s going to be after a lot of these, you know,</p>
<p>fake savings, if you will, have been depleted.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we&rsquo;re seeing some pressure come off as well, the</p>
<p>car shortage is kind of ending. And wages have raised so that it</p>
<p>seems like they&rsquo;re in this, you know, confluence of events,</p>
<p>certain things are starting to work themselves out. Are you</p>
<p>Hey, can I tell you something? I was I was in Washington this</p>
<p>week, the number of people that listen to our pod, it is</p>
<p>incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting. Yeah. I mean, incredible Washington care</p>
<p>about our views on politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible. The number of feedback to Yeah, it&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>really, really special. We&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve stumbled into something</p>
<p>pretty cool. And the fact that it&rsquo;s like, must, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>must listening. It&rsquo;s must listen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a Sunday weekly show, you just get a different</p>
<p>perspective from the tech sector and capital allocators that</p>
<p>maybe you don&rsquo;t get on us, you know, meet the press or</p>
<p>something. Yeah.</p>
<p>But just to follow up on that inflation point, the economic</p>
<p>point, Jason, if I can, so please.</p>
<p>So look, the main reason inflation is going to go down in</p>
<p>the second half of this year is because inflation is measured on</p>
<p>a year over year basis. And you remember about a year ago is</p>
<p>when inflation started, but you know, around this time last</p>
<p>year, inflation was only two and a half percent, then it</p>
<p>reached 5% by the summer, then by the end of the year was</p>
<p>almost 8%. So as we sort of lap last year&rsquo;s inflation rate, we</p>
<p>come up against, you know, you&rsquo;re copying against a 7.8%</p>
<p>number last year. So I don&rsquo;t think inflation&rsquo;s going to get</p>
<p>any better. We&rsquo;re probably looking at roughly a 12%, you</p>
<p>know, official two year inflation numbers. So in other</p>
<p>words, since Biden took over as president, you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>probably 12 to 13% of total inflation as measured by CPI.</p>
<p>And that is why even though the headline number will come down</p>
<p>later this year, I don&rsquo;t think the American people are going</p>
<p>to feel any better about the situation. You can almost</p>
<p>predict that Jen Psaki or whoever replaces her at the</p>
<p>podium at the White House briefing room, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be touting these lower inflation numbers at the end of the year.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t mean price levels will have decreased prices will</p>
<p>still be very high. When people go to the grocery store, they</p>
<p>buy meat or bread or what have you, it&rsquo;s going to be very</p>
<p>expensive. And I don&rsquo;t think people are gonna be feeling</p>
<p>better off. And there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of negativity going</p>
<p>into the November election for this administration.</p>
<p>And also, I think it&rsquo;s going to impact consumption. I mean, if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to a gas station, and you I mean, I drove the</p>
<p>minivan to LA. And it&rsquo;s the only electric, it&rsquo;s only non</p>
<p>electric car we have, we happen to drive it because we had a</p>
<p>number of people that was bigger than the axe. And it was</p>
<p>like shocking to buy $7 gasoline. And obviously, I can</p>
<p>withstand, you know, filling up, but I could see people saying,</p>
<p>you know what, maybe I&rsquo;m not going to make that incremental</p>
<p>trip, or, you know, you start looking at some of the prices,</p>
<p>you know, for taking a trip or flights, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>looked at flights or hotels, like things are starting to</p>
<p>creep up that it&rsquo;s like super noticeable. And that&rsquo;s got to</p>
<p>affect consumption. And then that would be what would be part</p>
<p>of those negative two quarters, right? Chamath. I mean, the role</p>
<p>of people stopping consuming and just saying, you know what,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too expensive right now. Just stay at home and watch</p>
<p>Netflix. Fuck it. You know, I&rsquo;ll cook pasta tonight.</p>
<p>You see that happening already.</p>
<p>Yeah, people are starting to balance the balance sheet, just</p>
<p>looking at the balance sheet and say, you know what, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the way I can, you know, cut some expensive items off the,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ll ride a bike, they&rsquo;re going to take less</p>
<p>travel, because, you know, the cost of airline tickets have</p>
<p>gone up, because the cost of the jet fuel has gone up at all.</p>
<p>It all ripples through the economy. But I think the thing</p>
<p>is that when when the Fed gets involved, though, they get</p>
<p>involved in a, you know, in a brute force way,</p>
<p>let me make a prediction right now, if we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re definitely</p>
<p>headed into an economic slowdown, I don&rsquo;t know if it</p>
<p>will meet the technical definition of recession, but</p>
<p>very negative course of growth. Yes, exactly. So, you know,</p>
<p>very high chance, I think of recession, like Jamal said,</p>
<p>towards the end of the year, if this war is still going on,</p>
<p>and we get into recession, look out below, I think this</p>
<p>president will be in Jimmy Carter territory, he began the</p>
<p>year at 38%. That was in reasonably good conditions of</p>
<p>peacetime. If you know, and I tweeted at the beginning of the</p>
<p>year in January, I said that, you know, this is, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at 38%. That&rsquo;s with peace and prosperity, look out</p>
<p>below, if we get recession and war, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s looking</p>
<p>like right now. So, you know, I think this is things are</p>
<p>looking pretty, pretty dire, which is why I keep saying it,</p>
<p>you know, the policy, this administration should be to try</p>
<p>and find a settlement to the situation in Ukraine to this</p>
<p>war. I know that we didn&rsquo;t start it, Putin started it,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s be clear. But if there&rsquo;s an off ramp here, we should be</p>
<p>seizing it because we got real problems back home in America,</p>
<p>and the administration should be focused on our economy and</p>
<p>our problems.</p>
<p>Europe is going to be the canary in the coal mine on all</p>
<p>of this, because I think they feel this pretty severely. And</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of exhaustion amongst European</p>
<p>governments and leaders when you start to listen to this</p>
<p>rhetoric to kind of, you know, find a way to end what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on over there, because the they&rsquo;re going to see a pretty</p>
<p>meaningful recession, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Much more, much more so than we will.</p>
<p>Yeah. And if you look, if you look right now, what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in France, Marine Le Pen is surging.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Against Macron. I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s going to pull off the</p>
<p>upset, but one of the major pillars, well, actually, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what she&rsquo;s running on. She is saying that she has been focused</p>
<p>on inflation and cost of living. And she says Macron has been</p>
<p>distracted by being America&rsquo;s basically lapdog puppet,</p>
<p>whatever, on Ukraine. So she&rsquo;s saying we need to focus on the</p>
<p>French economy. And she&rsquo;s also saying that we as France should</p>
<p>set our own follower policy and not be so differential to the</p>
<p>US. She says that this protracted war in Ukraine, and</p>
<p>all this hot rhetoric coming out of the Biden administration</p>
<p>about war crimes, and destabilizing Putin and toppling</p>
<p>him and putting him on trial at the Hague, that is not in French</p>
<p>interests. That&rsquo;s what the Americans want to do. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not what we should be wanting to do. We need to end this war.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not ready to say she&rsquo;s going to pull off the upset yet.</p>
<p>But she is clearly articulating that message because she is</p>
<p>finding purchase with the French electorate based on that</p>
<p>message. And you&rsquo;re going to hear that if this war continues</p>
<p>for three months and six months, and Europe goes into</p>
<p>recession, you&rsquo;re going to start hearing politicians all over the</p>
<p>European continent saying the same thing and questioning</p>
<p>American leadership. And why are they are dragging this thing</p>
<p>out? The thing that&rsquo;s the scariest thing about the French</p>
<p>election. And I&rsquo;m not sure how many Americans paid attention to</p>
<p>it. But just to maybe summarize in a very quick nutshell, you</p>
<p>actually had this really interesting dynamic of three</p>
<p>candidates. One was what would be considered far left. Jean</p>
<p>Luc Melenchon, one far right Marine Le Pen, and then one that</p>
<p>was very, very centrist Emmanuel Macron. And what&rsquo;s crazy is</p>
<p>both of these two were, you know, 22 plus percent of all of</p>
<p>the votes. It was just that Le Pen and Macron were one and two.</p>
<p>And so they go into a runoff election. And, you know,</p>
<p>Melenchon was very clear, he was like, under no circumstance,</p>
<p>should any of my supporters vote for Le Pen. But it just</p>
<p>shows you what&rsquo;s happening, which is like France, which is,</p>
<p>you know, sort of coming undone under this populist fight is</p>
<p>probably a canary in the coal mine for how this stuff could</p>
<p>play out in other places. And it&rsquo;s kind of scary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to see what happens in Germany as well, as</p>
<p>they look at this enabling of</p>
<p>code, they were able to hold the line, they you know, they</p>
<p>still have a center right government. But you know, in</p>
<p>Austria for a while, that wasn&rsquo;t the case in Hungary, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>really the case. So there&rsquo;s a lot of countries, at least in</p>
<p>the eastern block of Europe, where you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve seen a tip</p>
<p>in one direction or the other. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to think</p>
<p>of that in France, it could tip in one direction or the other.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the UK, or unfortunately, however, you look</p>
<p>at it, it&rsquo;s still really a two party system, for the most part,</p>
<p>I think. So I don&rsquo;t know, we&rsquo;re in a really precarious moment in</p>
<p>world history, I think. Yeah. By the way, I want to talk about</p>
<p>one thing that at the end of last year, I talked about just a</p>
<p>very random thing about, you know, visa and MasterCard and</p>
<p>how you could short them. Or, you know, like, basically, like</p>
<p>the payment networks, we&rsquo;re going to start to get, you know,</p>
<p>dismantled this year. It&rsquo;s really interesting to see, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if you guys have been really paying attention to all</p>
<p>the activity that&rsquo;s been happening in payments over like</p>
<p>the last literally 90 days, I think has been really</p>
<p>incredible up into, you know, just today, you know, visa and</p>
<p>MasterCard, I think are doing the single dumbest thing they</p>
<p>could do by being a duopoly, which is raising prices,</p>
<p>especially into an inflationary moment, which just lacks</p>
<p>complete knowledge and sensitivity of the moment. So</p>
<p>dampen economic activity, but also creates the incentives for</p>
<p>disruption. Sure, right, because then the gap between</p>
<p>you and your next clearest competitor becomes more obvious.</p>
<p>And again, in capitalism, you compete away these advantages.</p>
<p>And I just think that the setup is becoming more and more</p>
<p>obvious for the shift in payments. I just think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quite interesting. So Dick Durbin, actually, today,</p>
<p>basically, is going to create a big, you know, hubbub in the</p>
<p>Senate around these increasing merchant fees, which will</p>
<p>eventually spill over to consumers. There&rsquo;s some talk</p>
<p>that, you know, I, what is it called? Zellie? Is that how you</p>
<p>pronounce it? Zellie, the the inner bank payment system,</p>
<p>people are talking about them converting that to becoming a</p>
<p>more substantive payment system. And then this week, I</p>
<p>was able to see a little bit under the hood of, you know,</p>
<p>Solana pay. And that&rsquo;s really exciting. So it&rsquo;s all coming, I</p>
<p>think, like, it&rsquo;s like a swarm of activity to dismantle these</p>
<p>payments businesses. I just wanted to just give the 90 day</p>
<p>update from our from our discussion in January. All</p>
<p>right, everybody, we will see you May 15 16th and 17th in</p>
<p>Miami for the first all in summit now sold out. No more</p>

<p>to be able to get to anybody on it. Sorry, you can sign up and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll make sure you know about next year. If there is a next</p>
<p>year, this might be a one and done kind of situation. Three</p>

<p>Nate Silver, Brad Gerstner, Claire Vickle who is amazing,</p>
<p>Mar Hershon, Palmer Lucky, Keith Raboy, Joe Lonsdale. Oh,</p>
<p>you got Antonio to want to speak. Tip or Antonio is now</p>
<p>coming out of a shell. Antonio Garcia Martinez. Nice. I mean,</p>
<p>these are Adina. You should get we should get some foreign</p>
<p>policy folks too. I mean, well, if you guys wanted to do any</p>
<p>**** work, you could help me out here. I thought this was</p>
<p>just a grift you were doing. I didn&rsquo;t know it was serious. Now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now I may have to help. Yeah, no, you&rsquo;re gonna be proud</p>
<p>of this. Well, here&rsquo;s the thing that I&rsquo;m gonna be most proud of</p>
<p>is the format. I have come up with a new concept of a format.</p>
<p>I came up with a theme question that people can choose to</p>
<p>answer or not but the problem I want to solve and it could be</p>
<p>the problem I most wanna solve. It could be the problem I wanna</p>
<p>see solve the problem I&rsquo;m thinking about. People will go</p>
<p>up in most cases and give a ten to 20-minute, call it a Ted</p>
<p>style talk, a solo dolo talk where they kinda talk about</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re working on in their lives then they come and sit in</p>
<p>a chair with two besties on either side and then the four</p>
<p>of us engage them in a conversation. While we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking, we&rsquo;re gonna have maybe five slides that producers will</p>
<p>put together of data points, etc. So, we all get educated.</p>
<p>We pull up the slide and then there&rsquo;ll be, you know, 600</p>
<p>people in the auditorium, 100 people in the simulcast room.</p>
<p>We will take one question from the audience or two questions</p>
<p>if we have time with each segment and so you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>a lot of bestie action but stimulated by bestie guestie</p>
<p>positions um and I think this is really what folks want. Now,</p>
<p>if somebody doesn&rsquo;t want to give one, let&rsquo;s say Palmer just</p>
<p>wants to talk. Well, we&rsquo;ll just talk with Palmer um and so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be an option. I told people you could your</p>
<p>position paper, your position statement could be five minutes,</p>
<p>it could be twenty. So, I wanna do something on uh natural</p>
<p>resource scarcity and uh national security. So, uh Jim</p>
<p>Latinsky, the CEO of MP Materials. Okay, you just, all</p>
<p>you gotta do is email me the person&rsquo;s email address or</p>
<p>introduce me and we&rsquo;ll set it up. So, we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>something on like the supply chain of like rare earths and</p>
<p>lithium. Yeah. And so and then here&rsquo;s my other idea. So, I I</p>
<p>told everybody. So, that the problem I&rsquo;d like to solve there</p>
<p>is energy independence for America. Perfect. So, then do I</p>
<p>still need to email you now? Just email me but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing we&rsquo;re doing. I told everybody. I just I just told</p>
<p>you the. Yeah, we have it. Nick will take a note. Yeah. Um to</p>
<p>remind you. Um to get the email address. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>happen. Okay, so you don&rsquo;t need me to email you. Uh I mean, we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t wanna guess the email if you have it and you know them.</p>
<p>I mean, I know you wanna do the least amount of work but I need</p>
<p>to get a producer&rsquo;s fee here. I don&rsquo;t know. You guys gotta</p>
<p>outvote Freeberg. Putting that aside. I&rsquo;m fine. I&rsquo;m fine with</p>
<p>that too. Thank you. Then three because that&rsquo;s how all in media</p>
<p>is working now. It&rsquo;s just gonna be votes. Well, why don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>sign the LLC agreement? Did anybody sign it yet? I was</p>
<p>gonna review it to see what poison pill Freeberg put in</p>
<p>there. Can somebody? I&rsquo;m not signing this **** till I have</p>
<p>two lawyers look it over. Freeberg&rsquo;s got a poison pill in</p>
<p>there. I don&rsquo;t know about you guys but I just signed any</p>
<p>random docu sign that I just assumed. You know, I wanna get</p>
<p>to speak. You don&rsquo;t wanna get to speak at the conference. In</p>
<p>the last 30 days. Yeah. So, I&rsquo;d like to get, I&rsquo;d like to get</p>
<p>Professor John Mearsheimer to speak. He&rsquo;s a. Oh, that&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>great. Yeah, he&rsquo;s a professor at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been there 40 years. He&rsquo;s the leading, he&rsquo;s a leading</p>
<p>theorist, you could say, of the school of thought called</p>
<p>realism. Oh, yeah. Uh and and foreign policy and he has a</p>
<p>track record of being right about all of America&rsquo;s foreign</p>
<p>policy. Oh, wait. This is the guy you shared the video with,</p>
<p>right? Yeah. So. He&rsquo;s the guy who talked about the duopoly.</p>
<p>What do they call that? The mono, dual, tri. World order.</p>
<p>Nucleosis. Multipolar. Unipolar. Yeah, I mean, he has a</p>
<p>critique. He has a critique of liberal interventionism which</p>
<p>has been the dominant. Fantastic. Foreign policy since</p>
<p>the end of the Cold War. It&rsquo;s what got us into Iraq,</p>
<p>Afghanistan, Syria, Libya. He predicted all those things be</p>
<p>fiascos. He also predicted that our policy of constructive</p>
<p>engagement towards China would ultimately backfire and be a</p>
<p>disaster and he has a very contrarian critique right now</p>
<p>of our policy in Ukraine that&rsquo;s gone viral. Yes. On Twitter and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotten like 10 million plus views. He&rsquo;d be an</p>
<p>incredible person to to come speak. Well, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened while we invite people, you know, we we invite</p>
<p>some people. They don&rsquo;t know the show. We knew other people</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, oh my god, I love the show. I&rsquo;m there. What</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna be interesting is the next 30 days, we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>talk to each person about what they what topic they really</p>
<p>wanna, you know, double click on and then we&rsquo;re gonna pair</p>
<p>people. So, you might have Keith Reboy and Antonio, you</p>
<p>know, you might have Tim Urban and Joe Lonsdale or whatever</p>
<p>and so hopefully we can find a little dynamic. Maybe people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t agree. Maybe they have, you know, opposite positions</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re going to then have this great Socratic</p>
<p>dialogue with everybody and I think it&rsquo;s gonna be a very fast</p>
<p>paced type thing and then hopefully the speakers sit in</p>
<p>the VIP area and then I&rsquo;m gonna have a runner there with a</p>
<p>microphone or I might do it myself. So, you know, I might</p>
<p>have Keith Reboy on in the morning. In the afternoon, he</p>
<p>might wanna chime in on Joe Lonsdale&rsquo;s talk. I run up to</p>
<p>him with a microphone, etcetera. So, we got probably,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do two hours in the morning, three hours in the</p>
<p>afternoon. So, it&rsquo;s 10 to 12 so you can sleep in or come for</p>
<p>coffee. If we stay late playing poker every night, it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>a gentle wake up. Twelve to two is a nice lunch, healthy. Three</p>
<p>to five, nice, I&rsquo;m sorry, two to five, three hours of nice</p>
<p>content. Then you get a little break. You go to the parties. At</p>
<p>the end of the parties, you never know a poker table or two</p>
<p>might be pulled out and we play a little cash game. Who knows?</p>
<p>Anything&rsquo;s possible. So, poker could be all three nights. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know. You know, this depends on the degeneracy level</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s gonna be a fun time. I&rsquo;m just asking nobody go</p>
<p>ham on Sunday or Monday night. Please. Tuesday night, you wanna</p>
<p>have a little extracurricular. You wanna go a little late,</p>
<p>Davey, Chamath, that&rsquo;s fine but I want everybody in bed by</p>
<p>midnight, Sunday night, Monday night. No crazy. Alright, so</p>
<p>what are the dates this thing again?</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. Sunday, Monday. Of</p>
<p>what? Of what? May 15, 16, 17. Okay. Oh my god. Oh my god. What</p>
<p>a **** show. And you better **** fly some of these speakers out</p>
<p>the tour. It&rsquo;s in a month. It is in a month. Yes, that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m busting my **** on this. Okay, so uh Jake, I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>introduce you to Latinsky so we can uh slaughter. And if</p>
<p>anybody had uh we could use a couple more female speakers,</p>
<p>people of color. I&rsquo;m really trying to keep it diverse and</p>
<p>have a lot of range of speakers. A lot of uh David</p>
<p>Stans said yes early. You got the Joe Lonsdale. You get Keith</p>
<p>Robois. They all like wanna support David&rsquo;s team. I could</p>
<p>use a couple people maybe with the posing viewpoint. So, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to keep it a little bit wide. Uh Barry Weiss may</p>
<p>come. We&rsquo;re trying to work on bars. Oh, that&rsquo;s good. Yeah, we</p>
<p>should go. I can&rsquo;t make it. I wanted to have Bari and Kara</p>
<p>Swisher. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like that oil and vinegar is gonna</p>
<p>happen. Can we uh can we get Glenn Greenwald? But that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right, right, right. You&rsquo;re getting, you&rsquo;re getting further</p>
<p>and further to the right. What I&rsquo;d like to have is somebody</p>
<p>with Barry. Matt Taibbi. That&rsquo;s another kind of right guy. I</p>
<p>would like to have somebody on the left. Your definitions are</p>
<p>all off Jason. These definitions don&rsquo;t mean anything</p>
<p>anymore. Okay, they&rsquo;re independent critical thinkers.</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re they they originally came from the left.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not like huge fans of unbridled capitalism but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>more on the populist side. If you want to send an invite to</p>
<p>anybody, Saks, I would appreciate it. Particularly</p>
<p>Peter Thiel who&rsquo;s the you&rsquo;re the one person who can deliver</p>
<p>it since you guys are besties. Bring us Peter Thiel. The guy</p>
<p>spoke at a goddamn. Alright, give me a give me a list. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>invite Glenn. I&rsquo;ll invite Taibbi. I&rsquo;ll invite Peter. Oh</p>
<p>great. Now, we just lost half the audience. We&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>a protest outside. I I actually. These are the most</p>
<p>interesting people. Exactly. Peter Thiel&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>interesting. For sure. I like Mike Taibbi actually. I&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>you that. Here&rsquo;s the problem. Here&rsquo;s the problem. Here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem with getting the people on the other side is that the</p>
<p>people on the other side, again, it&rsquo;s not right versus left</p>
<p>anymore. It&rsquo;s sort of populist versus elitist and you already</p>
<p>know what all the elitists are gonna say and they&rsquo;re too</p>
<p>afraid to be on stage with people on the other side. But I</p>
<p>mean, I think that you&rsquo;re associated with Peter Thiel</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a little bit charge and triggering for</p>
<p>certain people. That&rsquo;s. Yeah, exactly. That&rsquo;s why they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t believe in free speech. They don&rsquo;t, I mean,</p>
<p>people are like, how could you be friends with David? I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>because we love each other. We&rsquo;re friends. Like, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>besties. And they&rsquo;re like, well, but you disagree with</p>
<p>tactics. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s contamination by association.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s basically, that&rsquo;s I mean, David, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to do to me right now. I&rsquo;m getting the back channel.</p>
<p>How could you do this with David Sacks? And I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s my best friend. That&rsquo;s why our pod is popular</p>
<p>is we have four people who are friends who sometimes disagree</p>
<p>with each other. The reason you can&rsquo;t create the show still</p>
<p>anywhere else. I&rsquo;m not giving up my friendship with David.</p>
<p>The reason you can&rsquo;t create the show anywhere else is because</p>
<p>those people think they get contaminated if they even have a</p>
<p>conversation with somebody on the other side of things. But</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get that on your side. Correct. Because we believe in</p>
<p>free speech. Because we&rsquo;re intellectually confident. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>intellectually confident. We don&rsquo;t believe in shutting down</p>
<p>the debate. Right. We believe in free speech. The other side,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re authoritarian, because they can&rsquo;t defend anything. They</p>
<p>just cancel people. They&rsquo;ve lost the art of persuasion. I</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;ve given up their position would be they&rsquo;ve given</p>
<p>up trying to reach you. You just don&rsquo;t get it. They&rsquo;ve given</p>
<p>up trying to reach you. And I&rsquo;m like, don&rsquo;t give up. Put up a</p>
<p>fight. If you disagree with sexist, it&rsquo;s not about reaching</p>
<p>me. It&rsquo;s about reaching all of them. Yes. All the people out</p>
<p>there watching the debate. They don&rsquo;t want to engage the debate</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t win the debate because they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to persuade. All they know how to do is cancel weekly. Look</p>
<p>what I did to you. All they know how to do is cancel people.</p>
<p>Yes. They&rsquo;re so used to cancel people. I debate you every week,</p>
<p>Saxon. I own you half the time. Okay. Good. I think so.</p>
<p>January 6th. We&rsquo;re going to release the January 6th tapes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you got. Your little excursion on January 6th.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like MSNBC. That&rsquo;s all you got.</p>
<p>Love you, Eskies.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge</p>
<p>orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless. It&rsquo;s like sexual</p>
<p>tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a bee.</p>
