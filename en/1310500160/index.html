    <p>The following is a conversation with Tim Dillon,</p>
<p>a standup comedian who is fearless</p>
<p>in challenging the norms</p>
<p>of modern day social and political discourse.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>NetSuite Business Management Software,</p>
<p>Athletic Greens All In One Nutrition Drink,</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that I will continue</p>
<p>talking to scientists, engineers, historians,</p>
<p>mathematicians, and so on.</p>
<p>But I will also talk to the people</p>
<p>who Jack Kerouac called the mad ones</p>
<p>in his book, On The Road.</p>
<p>That is one of my favorite books.</p>
<p>He wrote, the only people for me are the mad ones.</p>
<p>The ones who are mad to live,</p>
<p>mad to talk, mad to be saved,</p>
<p>desirous of everything at the same time.</p>
<p>The ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing,</p>
<p>but burn, burn, like fabulous yellow Roman candles</p>
<p>exploding like spiders across the stars.</p>
<p>And in the middle, you see the blue center light pop</p>
<p>and everybody goes, ah.</p>
<p>Some of these conversations will be a bit of a gamble</p>
<p>in that I have no idea how they will turn out.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m willing to risk it for a chance</p>
<p>at a bit of an adventure.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy and honored that Tim, this time,</p>
<p>wanted to take a chance as well.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Tim Dillon.</p>
<p>What would you like your tombstone to read?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good way to summarize the essence of a human being.</p>
<p>I would like it to say, this has not been paid for.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I want my living relatives to struggle to pay for it.</p>
<p>And I think I would like them to be hounded every day.</p>
<p>I would like people to call and go, listen,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t wanna ever excavate a body,</p>
<p>but we will because this has not been paid for.</p>
<p>I love the idea of leaving the, like debt,</p>
<p>leaving the world in lots of debt</p>
<p>that other people have to deal with.</p>
<p>And I know people that have done that.</p>
<p>I know people that have been in families</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s happened, where someone has to sit</p>
<p>and just curse the sky</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have a physical person anymore</p>
<p>to be angry at, but they still have to deal</p>
<p>with the decisions that person made.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s deeply tragic,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s always struck me as very funny.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a kind of immortality, the debt.</p>
<p>Because if the debt lasts for a long time,</p>
<p>the anger lasts for a long time.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re now immortal in the minds of many.</p>
<p>You arouse emotion in the minds of many.</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s best friend in the town I grew up in,</p>
<p>her husband shot himself in the driveway.</p>
<p>And my mother&rsquo;s friend never got a chance to just grieve</p>
<p>because he owed so much money.</p>
<p>She would come over and go, I hate him.</p>
<p>I fucking hate him.</p>
<p>And it was just such an interesting thing</p>
<p>to see somebody who, and her kids ended up getting angry</p>
<p>at her for that because they didn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>why she would hate a guy who was clearly suffering.</p>
<p>But she goes, he took the selfish way out.</p>
<p>He fucked us.</p>
<p>And it was always interesting for me to just remember</p>
<p>that you can leave earth and still be a problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a special person.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I think, what I&rsquo;d like my tombstone to read.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a show called Louis with Louis C.K.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you watched it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this moment, I think, where an old guy&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>to Louis about the best part about love</p>
<p>is after you break up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s remembering the good times and feeling that loss,</p>
<p>the pain of that loss.</p>
<p>The worst part about love is when you no longer</p>
<p>feel that pain.</p>
<p>So the pain of losing somebody lasts longer,</p>
<p>is more intense and lasts longer than the actual love.</p>
<p>So his argument was like the pain is what love really is.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>In the same way that anger,</p>
<p>your tombstone would arouse will last longer.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s deeply like a human thing.</p>
<p>Like why do we attach happiness</p>
<p>to the way we should remember others?</p>
<p>It could be just anger.</p>
<p>I know so many people who will have</p>
<p>deeply complicated feelings when&hellip;</p>
<p>I did drugs for many years and I spent time</p>
<p>with some wild people.</p>
<p>And their parents were also wild people.</p>
<p>And some of their parents have done crazy things to them.</p>
<p>And have created situations that were not productive</p>
<p>for child rearing.</p>
<p>And so I know that when those people die,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a very mixed bag.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of complex emotions.</p>
<p>Like, hey, we loved that guy.</p>
<p>But also when we look back, he was a horrible father,</p>
<p>a horrible husband, but he was fun.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t put enough stock in that,</p>
<p>but that will be a push and pull.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be the one kind of bringing up like,</p>
<p>hey, he was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>He was a lot.</p>
<p>Remember when he stuck us,</p>
<p>one of the things this particular person I&rsquo;m talking about,</p>
<p>we were at a bar and me and my friend were there,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having dinner.</p>
<p>And his father, who was an alcoholic,</p>
<p>a guy that would go out every night and didn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>refused to work, would lie and say he was going to work</p>
<p>and then go to a bar.</p>
<p>I mean, just a fun person.</p>
<p>And we were sitting at this bar restaurant</p>
<p>and the bartender, we see his father walk up</p>
<p>to the bartender and say, point at us, point at our table</p>
<p>and go and put the thumbs up.</p>
<p>And the bartender nodded.</p>
<p>And then the father walked over to our table and he said,</p>
<p>listen, I just want to let you know I just bought you dinner.</p>
<p>And I looked at his son and I said, he&rsquo;s a pretty good guy.</p>
<p>And then he climbed over the little fence down to the water</p>
<p>and got in his little boat.</p>
<p>It was a little cigarette boat and he just drove away.</p>
<p>And then about an hour later, we went and we said,</p>
<p>I think that guy took care of the bill.</p>
<p>But she said, well, go talk to the bartender.</p>
<p>So we talked to the bartender and he goes,</p>
<p>he handed us a bill and the bill was for like $1,000.</p>
<p>And we said, wait a minute, what the hell&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>And he goes, the guy that left an hour ago said,</p>
<p>you were going to take care of his bill.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been drinking here all week.</p>
<p>And we go, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>And he goes, remember, he pointed at you.</p>
<p>He put the thumbs up and you guys waved.</p>
<p>You remember that?</p>
<p>And the guy go, and we went, yeah.</p>
<p>And I just looked at my friends, my friend and I went,</p>
<p>you know, your dad is just,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to remember him for all kinds of reasons.</p>
<p>But to you, he was fun.</p>
<p>He was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t my dad, but I spent a lot of time with him.</p>
<p>I was in two boating accidents with him.</p>
<p>You know, two boating accidents.</p>
<p>Alcohol involved, drugs involved.</p>
<p>Yes, he was, usually alcohol was involved</p>
<p>when he left his house and when he was at home as well.</p>
<p>But I was in two boating accidents.</p>
<p>And do you know how fun someone has to be</p>
<p>to get in a second boating accident?</p>
<p>Do you know what a good time someone has to be</p>
<p>to get in a boat with them</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;ve already gotten in one wreck?</p>
<p>Never get fooled again.</p>
<p>What was that line?</p>
<p>George Bush, never get fooled again.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you&rsquo;re getting fooled again,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a reason for it,</p>
<p>but he was a fun guy.</p>
<p>He did have a death wish.</p>
<p>The second boating accident, he grabbed me</p>
<p>and said, you can&rsquo;t hang out with me anymore.</p>
<p>And I said, why?</p>
<p>He goes, I&rsquo;m trying to kill myself.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh.</p>
<p>And then I understood that like all of the fun</p>
<p>under the fun lived a very destructive person</p>
<p>who not only was destructive, but wanted to die.</p>
<p>So speaking of fun people that want to die,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re, we can go Hunter S. Thompson,</p>
<p>but Charles Bukowski.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re aware of the guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of him, sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read some of his stuff.</p>
<p>So his tombstone says,</p>
<p>I just want to ask you a question about it.</p>
<p>His tombstone says, don&rsquo;t try.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>What do you think about that advice</p>
<p>as a way to approach life?</p>
<p>I think for many people, it&rsquo;s a good advice</p>
<p>because the people that are going to try will do anyway.</p>
<p>And the people that need to be told,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole cottage industry now</p>
<p>of motivational speakers and life coaches and gurus</p>
<p>that tell people that they all have to own their own business</p>
<p>and be their own boss and be a disruptor</p>
<p>and get into industries.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredibly unrealistic for most people.</p>
<p>Most people are not suited for that.</p>
<p>And the Gary Vees of the world that tell everybody</p>
<p>that they should just hustle and grind</p>
<p>and hustle and grind.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very light on the specifics</p>
<p>of what they should actually do.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think a lot of people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not horrible advice to give to a lot of people.</p>
<p>I think my generation got horrible advice</p>
<p>from our parents, from our teachers.</p>
<p>And that advice was follow your dreams and nobody,</p>
<p>and that was it, by the way.</p>
<p>There was no like, what are your dreams?</p>
<p>Are they realistic?</p>
<p>What happens when they don&rsquo;t work out?</p>
<p>Will your dreams make you happy?</p>
<p>Are your dreams real?</p>
<p>Do they exist on earth?</p>
<p>Can you follow, anybody follow your dreams?</p>
<p>You can be anything you want to be.</p>
<p>Horrible advice, horrible advice.</p>
<p>Worst advice you could ever give a generation of people.</p>
<p>Really, truly.</p>
<p>I mean, think about it.</p>
<p>If you were talking to somebody</p>
<p>and you were trying to make them succeed,</p>
<p>are there any two worse pieces of advice to give them</p>
<p>than follow your dreams</p>
<p>and you can be anything you want to be?</p>
<p>Those to me are the two most destructive pieces</p>
<p>of information I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>So let me push back because.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>This is. Many people do.</p>
<p>So yeah, this is like a rigorous journalistic interview.</p>
<p>Larry King, by the way, passed away today.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m taking over the.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very sad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m carrying the.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very sad.</p>
<p>RIP King.</p>
<p>Yeah, what was I even gonna say?</p>
<p>Oh, let me push back on the follow your dream thing</p>
<p>is I come from an immigrant family</p>
<p>where I was always working extremely hard at stuff,</p>
<p>like in a stupid way.</p>
<p>I would, I love, there&rsquo;s something about me</p>
<p>that loves hitting my head against the wall</p>
<p>over and over and over until either my head breaks</p>
<p>or the wall breaks.</p>
<p>Just like, I love that dedication</p>
<p>for no purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the mouse that&rsquo;s stuck in a cage or whatever.</p>
<p>And no, and everybody always told me,</p>
<p>my family, the people around me,</p>
<p>the sort of the epitome of what I could achieve</p>
<p>is to be kind of a stable job.</p>
<p>You know, the old like lawyer doctor,</p>
<p>in my case, it&rsquo;s like scientists and so on.</p>
<p>But I had these dreams at this fire, you know,</p>
<p>about love robots.</p>
<p>And that nobody ever gave me permission</p>
<p>to pursue those dreams.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re supposed to grab it yourself.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s supposed to give you permission,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about just people saying, you know,</p>
<p>fuck what everyone else thinks,</p>
<p>like giving you permission, a parent</p>
<p>or somebody like that saying, do your own thing.</p>
<p>Go become an actor, go become like,</p>
<p>do the crazy thing you&rsquo;re not supposed to do,</p>
<p>an artist, go build a company, quit school,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yes, sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the push back against the,</p>
<p>follow your dreams as bad advice.</p>
<p>In mass, if you were to look at,</p>
<p>in mass, if you were to look at statistically</p>
<p>how few people that works out for,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, no, but let&rsquo;s be very honest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very true.</p>
<p>Be very honest.</p>
<p>So I mean like, yeah, if you&rsquo;re gonna go be an,</p>
<p>hey, I was broke for 10 years before I became a,</p>
<p>before I was making money as a comedian.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t need Gary Vaynerchuk</p>
<p>to tell me to follow my thing, right?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>I was kind of funny and like,</p>
<p>I was kind of, a lot of things were in my favor</p>
<p>of being a comedian, right?</p>
<p>I had this kind of crazy fucked up life.</p>
<p>I had a lot of stories.</p>
<p>I had exhausted, I was willing to fail.</p>
<p>I had failed before.</p>
<p>I was broke.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t care about being broke.</p>
<p>I knew how to be broke.</p>
<p>I had, I was shameless to a degree.</p>
<p>I was, I would get on a stage night after night</p>
<p>and be laughed at.</p>
<p>I would, I had a high threshold for being embarrassed.</p>
<p>I had a high threshold for people thinking</p>
<p>that I was a scumbag, right?</p>
<p>And showing up at family parties and being like,</p>
<p>yeah, I still really don&rsquo;t have a job.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just, I work at comedy clubs kind of,</p>
<p>and I get booked when I can.</p>
<p>And I was, you know, suited for it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this idea that people can just roam</p>
<p>around the world injecting themselves into other things</p>
<p>they have no aptitude for at all.</p>
<p>And will that to happen?</p>
<p>A small percentage of people might be able to do that,</p>
<p>but the vast majority of people have something</p>
<p>they might key into that they&rsquo;re meant to do.</p>
<p>Like you loved robots, you love technology,</p>
<p>and you found a place in that world where you thrive.</p>
<p>But I think many people, a lot of people love robots, right?</p>
<p>So a lot of people think everything you do is interesting.</p>
<p>I think your shit is fascinating.</p>
<p>I watch you or podcasts, and I think it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I have no place in your world.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I have no place in that world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like remedial math.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like community college math.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a waste of my time.</p>
<p>What do you think about robot?</p>
<p>Would you ever buy a robot for your home?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What will it do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be a companion, a friend.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I mean, I would like to start replacing friends</p>
<p>and family with robots immediately.</p>
<p>I mean, truly, truly.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not even kidding.</p>
<p>Like I would like to have a Thanksgiving with four robots.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dead serious.</p>
<p>Are they into QAnon?</p>
<p>Like are the robots, when do the robots start going crazy?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my question is like, how long do the robots</p>
<p>live with me before they are also a problem</p>
<p>and I got to replace them?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna indoctrinate the robot.</p>
<p>The robot&rsquo;s gonna call me like my aunt does</p>
<p>and talk about coronavirus for an hour every morning</p>
<p>and tell me everyone in America who&rsquo;s died of coronavirus.</p>
<p>One of the things I enjoy in life</p>
<p>is how terrified people like you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan by the way, get a robot.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m concerned about AI</p>
<p>completely getting rid of the need for human beings</p>
<p>because human beings, I mean, usually you go out</p>
<p>in the street and you go,</p>
<p>so few of these people are necessary, even now.</p>
<p>Even now you look at people and you go,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hanging on by a thread, right?</p>
<p>And you can just imagine how many jobs</p>
<p>are gonna get replaced, how many industries</p>
<p>are going to be completely remade with AI</p>
<p>and the pace of change worries me a little bit</p>
<p>because we do a very bad job in this country</p>
<p>of mitigation when we have problems.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do a great job.</p>
<p>We did not great job with COVID, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do a good job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something we don&rsquo;t do well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good in booms and busts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good when it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re actually, we kind of know how to kind of like,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re bottomed out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like a gambling addict in this country.</p>
<p>We like, we know what it feels like</p>
<p>to be outside of an OTB at 9 a.m.</p>
<p>drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes going,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna build it back.</p>
<p>And we know what it&rsquo;s like to win,</p>
<p>but anything in between, it seems not that great.</p>
<p>So to me, it feels like are we gonna be able</p>
<p>to like help people that are displaced</p>
<p>and that have their jobs taken by,</p>
<p>I mean, do you not fear sort of a world</p>
<p>where you have a lot of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>replacing workers and then what happens?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of fears around artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>One of them is, yes, displacement of jobs, workers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s technology in general.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just any kind of new innovations displace jobs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m less worried about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more worried about other impacts</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>For example, the nature of our discourse,</p>
<p>like social, the effects of algorithms</p>
<p>on the way we communicate with each other,</p>
<p>the spread of information,</p>
<p>what that information looks like,</p>
<p>the creation of silos, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think that would just make worse</p>
<p>the effects that the displacement of jobs has.</p>
<p>I think ultimately, I have a hope</p>
<p>that technology creates more opportunities</p>
<p>than it destroys.</p>
<p>I hope so too.</p>
<p>So in that sense, AI to me is an exciting possibility,</p>
<p>but the challenges this world presents</p>
<p>will create divisions, will create chaos and so on.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m more focused on the way we deal</p>
<p>as a society with that chaos,</p>
<p>the way we talk to each other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>Creating the platform that&rsquo;s healthy for that.</p>
<p>Now, as a comedian creator,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call it,</p>
<p>people that put out content,</p>
<p>the gatekeepers are now algorithmic, right?</p>
<p>So they are kind of almost AI ready.</p>
<p>So if you are a person that puts out YouTube videos,</p>
<p>podcasts, whatever you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>it used to be a guy in the back of the room with a cigar</p>
<p>saying, I like you or get him out of here.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s an algorithm you barely understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to people at YouTube,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if they understand the algorithm.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This is fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Because I speak to people at YouTube and I go,</p>
<p>hey, man, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>One of my episode titles of my podcast</p>
<p>was called Knife Fight in Malibu.</p>
<p>It was about real estate.</p>
<p>And it was because a realtor in Malibu,</p>
<p>I was trying to get a summer rental,</p>
<p>which I can&rsquo;t really afford,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a huge problem.</p>
<p>I follow my dreams.</p>
<p>So I called a realtor and she said, listen,</p>
<p>she goes, I don&rsquo;t know what the government&rsquo;s saying,</p>
<p>but she goes, it&rsquo;s a real knife fight out here.</p>
<p>You know, an old grizzled woman, real realtor,</p>
<p>tanned skin, sig out the mouth, driving a Porsche.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real knife fight out here.</p>
<p>Her entire life had become real estate.</p>
<p>Her soul had been hollowed out.</p>
<p>Her kids hate her.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s made her come in years,</p>
<p>but she just loves heated kitchen floors infused.</p>
<p>Fun.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a demon from hell and we need them, truly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting rid of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>And she goes, it&rsquo;s a real knife fight out here.</p>
<p>So we put that in the episode title.</p>
<p>And of course, I guess some algorithm thought</p>
<p>that we were showing like people stabbing each other</p>
<p>in a Wendy&rsquo;s and we got like demonetized.</p>
<p>Did we get demonetized?</p>
<p>We lost a lot of views</p>
<p>because we were kicked out of whatever out,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re just kicked out.</p>
<p>And then I was asking YouTube about it.</p>
<p>They were kind of understanding it.</p>
<p>But even the people that work there</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t truly seem to understand the algorithm.</p>
<p>So can you explain to me how that works</p>
<p>where they barely know what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>No, they do not understand the full dynamics</p>
<p>of the monster or the amazing thing that they&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the amount of content that&rsquo;s being created</p>
<p>is larger than anyone understands.</p>
<p>Like this is huge.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t deal with it.</p>
<p>The teams aren&rsquo;t large enough to deal with it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like special cases.</p>
<p>So if you fall into the category of special case,</p>
<p>so we can maybe talk about that, like a Donald Trump,</p>
<p>where you like actually have meetings</p>
<p>about what to do with this particular account.</p>
<p>But everything outside of that is all algorithms.</p>
<p>They get reported by people</p>
<p>and they get, like if enough people report</p>
<p>a particular video, a particular tweet,</p>
<p>it rises up to where humans look over it.</p>
<p>But the initial step of the reporting</p>
<p>and the rising up to the human supervision</p>
<p>is done by algorithm.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t understand the dynamics of that</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about billions of tweets.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about hundreds of thousands of hours</p>
<p>of video uploaded every day.</p>
<p>Now, the hilarity of it</p>
<p>is that most of the YouTube algorithm</p>
<p>is based on the title.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>And the description is a small contribution</p>
<p>in terms of filtering,</p>
<p>in terms of the knife fight situation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all they can do.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have algorithms at all</p>
<p>that are able to process the content of the video.</p>
<p>So they try to also infer information</p>
<p>based on if you&rsquo;re watching all of these QAnon videos</p>
<p>or something like that, or Flat Earth videos,</p>
<p>and you also watch, are really excitedly watching</p>
<p>the whole knife fight in Malibu video,</p>
<p>that says that increases the chance</p>
<p>that the knife fight is a dangerous video for society</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Interesting, wow.</p>
<p>Based on their contribution.</p>
<p>So people are watching something,</p>
<p>because I watch QAnon and Flat Earth videos</p>
<p>to ridicule them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I watch these videos and I make fun of them on my show.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is,</p>
<p>if I then go watch something else,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m increasing the likelihood</p>
<p>that that video is gonna get looked at</p>
<p>as potentially subversive or dangerous.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>So they make decisions about who you are,</p>
<p>who you are as a human being,</p>
<p>as a watcher, as a visual user,</p>
<p>based on the clusters of videos you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>But those clusters are not manually determined.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re automatically clustered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so weird.</p>
<p>We have titles where they got upset about,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even understand.</p>
<p>Like we had a title that was so innocuous, in my opinion,</p>
<p>and the title of the episode was called Bomb Disney World.</p>
<p>And I was asking people to consider bombing Disney World.</p>
<p>And YouTube got angry at that.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>You can never understand why.</p>
<p>You could have said Disney World is the bombs.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just rearranging.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it probably meant.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t saying do it,</p>
<p>but I was saying let&rsquo;s start thinking about plans to do,</p>
<p>not let&rsquo;s do it, but let&rsquo;s get in the mind.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s change the conversation.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very interesting because as a comedian,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna live in that world</p>
<p>of worrying about algorithms.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna worry about deplatforming</p>
<p>and shadowbanning.</p>
<p>I mean, all these conversations</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve had with other comedians about shadowbanning,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>We all call each other, I think I&rsquo;m being shadowbanned.</p>
<p>Are you being shadowbanned?</p>
<p>Nobody knew what that word was a month ago,</p>
<p>I mean, a year ago,</p>
<p>but everyone now is convinced that everything they do</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t succeeding is being shadowbanned.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this new paranoia,</p>
<p>this algorithmic paranoia now that we all kinda have</p>
<p>because there are genuine instances</p>
<p>of people being taken out of an algorithm,</p>
<p>you know, rightly or wrongly,</p>
<p>however you wanna believe.</p>
<p>But then there are also things that just don&rsquo;t perform</p>
<p>as well for a myriad of reasons.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re all saying like, well, they&rsquo;re against me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re shutting me down.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true or not, you know?</p>
<p>What do you think about this moment in history,</p>
<p>which was really troubling to me?</p>
<p>We could talk about several troubling aspects,</p>
<p>but one is Amazon removing Parler from AWS.</p>
<p>To me, that was the most clearly troubling.</p>
<p>It felt like it created a more dangerous world</p>
<p>when the infrastructure on which you have competing</p>
<p>medium of communications now puts its finger on the scale,</p>
<p>now influences who wins and who loses.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re always told is like,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t like Twitter, create your own service.</p>
<p>Or if you don&rsquo;t like something, you can do your own thing.</p>
<p>Or if you are, and basically because, you know, tech,</p>
<p>you have to be in business with one of five companies.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s like Amazon, Facebook, Google, YouTube,</p>
<p>and Twitter, whatever, they&rsquo;re like, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, Amazon puts everything on the cloud,</p>
<p>you know, Google and YouTube,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all basically the SEO and the advertising.</p>
<p>And you got to get your name out there.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna be buried in it.</p>
<p>Like, because you have to do business with it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a cartel of these companies.</p>
<p>You understand it better than anybody</p>
<p>that you are prevented, truly.</p>
<p>And I think whatever you think about Parler,</p>
<p>whatever you think about what people are saying on Parler,</p>
<p>whatever you think about Alex Jones,</p>
<p>whatever you thought about Milianopolis,</p>
<p>the state has an interest in,</p>
<p>and has always had an interest in crushing dissent.</p>
<p>This is what the state has done.</p>
<p>This is how they, you know, retain the power they have</p>
<p>by eliminating dissent where they can.</p>
<p>Now, because you don&rsquo;t have, you know,</p>
<p>three broadcast networks anymore,</p>
<p>and a handful of newspapers that were all run, by the way,</p>
<p>by people that had been either compromised or happily,</p>
<p>you know, happily going with the program,</p>
<p>and you have this wild west of the internet,</p>
<p>people like me, people that make,</p>
<p>I make funny content that I hope is funny,</p>
<p>but a lot of it is wild and crazy.</p>
<p>I say a lot of wild and crazy things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very funny.</p>
<p>I say a lot of wild and crazy things about powerful people.</p>
<p>You mock the powerful in there</p>
<p>by bringing them down a notch.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll probably talk about it,</p>
<p>but humor is one of the tools to balance the powers</p>
<p>in society.</p>
<p>Well, sure.</p>
<p>And to make people feel better about things</p>
<p>and to, you know, whatever the case may be, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my goal is to kind of like,</p>
<p>hey, people have had a shitty day.</p>
<p>If this video or podcast makes you laugh, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I think that it won&rsquo;t ever,</p>
<p>it was never gonna stop at Alex Jones.</p>
<p>Not that I think he should have been taking off everything</p>
<p>the way he was,</p>
<p>but this keeps going until we have sanitized</p>
<p>all of social media.</p>
<p>And what they really want it to be</p>
<p>is what Instagram is kind of becoming,</p>
<p>which is a marketplace of,</p>
<p>you could just go and buy sneakers, go buy a sweatshirt,</p>
<p>go buy jeans, go buy this, go buy that.</p>
<p>And the idea of the free exchange of information</p>
<p>seems to be the old internet.</p>
<p>And it seems the new internet seems to be, you know,</p>
<p>hyper, and I&rsquo;m a capitalist,</p>
<p>but this seems to be like hyper capitalist</p>
<p>in the sense of like, they only want you consuming things</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want you thinking too much.</p>
<p>And that seems to be where it&rsquo;s heading.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve even seen that with Instagram</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like everything on Instagram is like,</p>
<p>buy a sweatshirt, you know?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, all right, man.</p>
<p>Hey man, if I want a sweatshirt, I&rsquo;ll get it.</p>
<p>Like, relax.</p>
<p>You know, just every ad seems to be encouraging consumption,</p>
<p>but very few things seem geared towards,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s have a dialogue or let&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and not that Instagram was ever great for that,</p>
<p>but like, if everything&rsquo;s are geared now</p>
<p>towards content on Instagram,</p>
<p>a lot of it seems geared towards shopping.</p>
<p>See, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s an interesting point.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the consumerism that capitalism leads to</p>
<p>is necessarily gets in the way of nuanced conversation.</p>
<p>I feel like you could still sell Tim Dillon sweatshirts</p>
<p>and have a difficult nuanced conversation</p>
<p>or mock the current president, the previous president,</p>
<p>mock the powerful, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, we try.</p>
<p>We try to balance that.</p>
<p>Do you have sweatshirts?</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>Are they on sale now, fake business?</p>
<p>We do, fake business sweatshirt</p>
<p>with the Enron logo, fake business,</p>
<p>because I do fake business all the time.</p>
<p>It would be nice if you talk about Alex Jones</p>
<p>if you plug the sweatshirt during that conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll do that, absolutely.</p>
<p>But what I tend to worry about with,</p>
<p>I see social media and technology</p>
<p>existing to flatten society.</p>
<p>It makes people very boring.</p>
<p>All of the experiences kids have right now are online.</p>
<p>Many of their closest friendships are online.</p>
<p>Their first relationships are online.</p>
<p>The culture is very homogenous,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s eliminating characters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s eliminating interesting people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making people into AI.</p>
<p>All of their tastes.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>AI could be Charles Bukowski as well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not there yet, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the $75,000 dog is not doing anything.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>Listen, I hate people.</p>
<p>I get why you like AI so much.</p>
<p>I hate people too, and I&rsquo;m very amenable to AI,</p>
<p>and I agree with you.</p>
<p>Listen, I think the future,</p>
<p>we gotta get everyone out of here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you on that, so don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m.</p>
<p>I love people.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s manipulating my mind and my.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the flash of light in your eyes</p>
<p>when you talked about that dog</p>
<p>was so much more than any person.</p>
<p>And I get it, by the way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I hate people, but if we could.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not excited.</p>
<p>If we could just use robots to kill most of them,</p>
<p>I think that would be good for society.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with that too,</p>
<p>but I think that social media flattens people.</p>
<p>Flattening the personalities of characters.</p>
<p>Flatten the personalities of people, man.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, you know, when&rsquo;s the last time?</p>
<p>Like, I like the idea of like, you know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m, you know, somebody showing up to high school</p>
<p>with like a backpack and taking out an old CD</p>
<p>and being like, hey man, here&rsquo;s this band</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never heard of that I love</p>
<p>or whatever, you gotta get into this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you know, when I talk to young,</p>
<p>you know, I have friends that have younger brothers</p>
<p>and everything.</p>
<p>And I know that the dominant culture was always dominant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an idiot, but like,</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s harder to be unique and original now</p>
<p>because so much of what&rsquo;s promoted</p>
<p>is just this way to kind of corral people</p>
<p>into believing and thinking a certain set of ideals</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s constantly shifting and evolving.</p>
<p>And people are just caught up in that.</p>
<p>And to me, it gets very boring very quickly.</p>
<p>I hate being bored and that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that</p>
<p>because at the same time, podcasts are really popular,</p>
<p>long form podcasts are really popular</p>
<p>and people are hungry for those kinds of conversations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of dangerous ideas, quote unquote,</p>
<p>flowing, being spread around through podcasts,</p>
<p>meaning just like debates.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>You know, so that&rsquo;s still popular.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what to.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>That gives me hope, I guess.</p>
<p>I hope so too.</p>
<p>And like I said, I look at the negative a lot</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what I usually make fun of,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of positive stuff happening too.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk a bit about Alex Jones.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to talk to him</p>
<p>while you were on the Joe Rogan Experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on Alex&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked, I&rsquo;ve had Alex on my show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to Alex for three hours</p>
<p>in front of, I guess it was maybe like 15 million people</p>
<p>right on Joe&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p>It was a really wild conversation.</p>
<p>I think it was one of the coolest moments in broadcasting</p>
<p>that clearly that I&rsquo;ve ever been a part of.</p>
<p>But I think it goes in the lexicon of like,</p>
<p>these are big podcasts.</p>
<p>Like I think it&rsquo;s one of the biggest podcasts.</p>
<p>A week before the election, Alex Jones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really grateful that Joe gave me the opportunity</p>
<p>to be there.</p>
<p>And it was just an amazing conversation to watch.</p>
<p>What was the shirt you wore?</p>
<p>Fridges Lane.</p>
<p>It was a fun joke that no one in tech got</p>
<p>because we all know how funny they are.</p>
<p>But the tech writers, which is mainly blue haired.</p>
<p>I do not agree with these statements.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mainly blue haired people</p>
<p>whose goal in life is to find things</p>
<p>to give them orgasms with.</p>
<p>If you want to dye your hair blue, it&rsquo;s your choice.</p>
<p>I respect it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but is it your choice?</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>all the tech writers, like a lot of people just,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m just maligning tech unfairly.</p>
<p>But a lot of people that sense there&rsquo;s a humor</p>
<p>were like, he&rsquo;s advocating for human trafficking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s clearly a joke</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re coming off the believe all women.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re coming off that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very funny to just say Fridges Lane,</p>
<p>hey man, believe all women.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s just our politics and our public sphere</p>
<p>is so schizophrenic right now</p>
<p>that when you point that out,</p>
<p>people are going to be angry with you.</p>
<p>But that was a fun shirt to wear.</p>
<p>But on Alex, you know, I was one of the people</p>
<p>that found him really entertaining,</p>
<p>that the same kind of thing as with Bukowski,</p>
<p>these kinds of personalities that are wild,</p>
<p>crazy, full of ideas.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to be grounded in truth at all,</p>
<p>or they can be grounded in truth a little bit.</p>
<p>Like, he&rsquo;s just playing with ideas,</p>
<p>like a jazz musician, screaming sometimes.</p>
<p>Obviously he has some demons.</p>
<p>Sometimes he&rsquo;s super angry for no reason whatsoever</p>
<p>at some weird thing that he&rsquo;s constructing in his own head.</p>
<p>Sometimes he&rsquo;s super loving and peaceful,</p>
<p>especially lately that I&rsquo;ve heard him,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen with him,</p>
<p>with Michael Malice, where he&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>like Malice was doing,</p>
<p>like telling Alex Jones, I love you, Alex.</p>
<p>Just this loving kind of softness and kindness</p>
<p>underneath it all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to make of any of it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this huge number of people</p>
<p>that tell me that Alex Jones is dangerous for society.</p>
<p>So what do you do with that?</p>
<p>Do you think he&rsquo;s dangerous for society?</p>
<p>Do you think he is one of the sort of</p>
<p>entertaining personalities of our time</p>
<p>that shouldn&rsquo;t be suppressed or somewhere in between?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that Alex per se is dangerous for society.</p>
<p>I think the greater danger for society comes again</p>
<p>from stifling all dissent, right?</p>
<p>All, like anybody with a voice that uses it,</p>
<p>that critiques the government,</p>
<p>and putting all of those people in a category</p>
<p>and getting rid of them is incredibly dangerous.</p>
<p>To me, more so.</p>
<p>I think the biggest problem that Alex has ever had</p>
<p>was when he questioned the Sandy Hook shooting.</p>
<p>And that really was,</p>
<p>because it really is this identifiable incident</p>
<p>that you can look at where it did get away from him</p>
<p>and a lot of his fans who,</p>
<p>the people that are attracted to conspiracy stuff,</p>
<p>and I have some of those fans,</p>
<p>some of them are really smart people,</p>
<p>some of them are mentally unwell.</p>
<p>A lot of them happen to be mentally unwell.</p>
<p>So when you have a fan base of people</p>
<p>where some of them are mentally unwell,</p>
<p>and you are questioning tragic events, okay?</p>
<p>And Alex was right about Epstein.</p>
<p>He was right about a lot of things,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got no credit for that.</p>
<p>And I understand that this,</p>
<p>sometimes when you write about 10 things</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re wrong about something,</p>
<p>and the thing you&rsquo;re wrong about is so offensive to people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never gonna get any credit for being right,</p>
<p>even though you were right more than when you were wrong.</p>
<p>The problem was a lot of his fans who were crazy stalked,</p>
<p>harassed these families and accused them of being actors</p>
<p>and accused them of faking their children&rsquo;s deaths.</p>
<p>It was just horrific experience.</p>
<p>And Alex is tied to that.</p>
<p>And how much he inspired that by what he did on his show,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know because I haven&rsquo;t watched hours and hours</p>
<p>of that particular thing, the whole Sandy Hook thing.</p>
<p>If you listen to him, he says, I really covered it.</p>
<p>I kind of covered it and moved on.</p>
<p>Other people go, no, he spent a long time on it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the real danger of going into that territory</p>
<p>over and over again,</p>
<p>going everything&rsquo;s a false flag or everything&rsquo;s fake.</p>
<p>I think Alex has actually been kind of reasonable.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s resisted a lot of the politics of racial resentment</p>
<p>on the alt right, for example, he&rsquo;s resisted that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s resisted the antisemitic currents</p>
<p>of a lot of that politics.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s resisted a lot of the virulently anti trans</p>
<p>or anti gay stuff.</p>
<p>Now he does dip his toe into the water</p>
<p>of like the culture wars, of course he does.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve never really seen him,</p>
<p>and I could be wrong about this,</p>
<p>embrace white nationalism or identitarianism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen him really go antisemitic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen him take that route.</p>
<p>When I grew up and I would turn him on every now and then,</p>
<p>he was talking about NAFTA, the WTO,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s talking about 9 11,</p>
<p>he was talking about the world trade organizations</p>
<p>and a lot of these big conferences,</p>
<p>whether it was the Bilderberg group,</p>
<p>whether it was a Bohemian Grove, which he infiltrated.</p>
<p>And he was talking about,</p>
<p>hey, here are the most powerful people in the world.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how it affects you.</p>
<p>And that was interesting to me</p>
<p>because no one else was really talking about it</p>
<p>except Alex Jones, occasionally Art Bell on WABC.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d listen to him at night, right?</p>
<p>I think Alex became very controversial</p>
<p>when he decided to back Donald Trump.</p>
<p>And then he has a considerable following</p>
<p>and a considerable audience</p>
<p>that he was then able to marshal</p>
<p>in the direction of supporting Donald Trump.</p>
<p>That was when the spotlight,</p>
<p>because then he was talking to Trump, Trump did his show,</p>
<p>Alex Jones just got bigger, right?</p>
<p>And he blew up, that&rsquo;s the term, right?</p>
<p>He blew off, he put out the Good HBO special,</p>
<p>whatever you wanna call it.</p>
<p>He has a hit song, he blew up.</p>
<p>And then people started looking at the things</p>
<p>that he was associated with.</p>
<p>The Sandy Hook thing is a blemish on his record.</p>
<p>I do believe he regrets it.</p>
<p>But again, I do see the point of the families</p>
<p>who are like, dude, fuck this guy forever.</p>
<p>This is the worst thing I ever went through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very tough, I understand the people that say that.</p>
<p>I understand, and I understand the people that go,</p>
<p>when you have tech companies that act</p>
<p>in a coordinated manner to just get rid of someone,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have any way to defend themselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little terrifying when you think</p>
<p>about that power being abused and how wouldn&rsquo;t it be?</p>
<p>Do you think he should have not have been banned</p>
<p>from all these platforms?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I do think that</p>
<p>if you are a private company, right?</p>
<p>I do think, and this is where you run into this problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if these tech companies</p>
<p>were government utilities, would that decrease</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s likelihood of being banned?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>So I understand the benefit of them being treated</p>
<p>like public utilities and people thinking</p>
<p>they have the right to a Twitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never, I don&rsquo;t know, I have very little confidence.</p>
<p>I mean, the government&rsquo;s trying to roll out a vaccine</p>
<p>in California and we vaccinated like five people.</p>
<p>I mean, in terms of what we need to do in the state, right?</p>
<p>So maybe if it was a government utility,</p>
<p>I do think someone like Alex,</p>
<p>like there should be some process.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re gonna get rid of someone,</p>
<p>they should have a way to defend themselves.</p>
<p>There should be more democratic process</p>
<p>that you can go through</p>
<p>than just being unilaterally taken off something.</p>
<p>But like, then you run into the,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, am I gonna say that everyone deserves?</p>
<p>No, if you&rsquo;re threatening or harassing people</p>
<p>or threatening to kill them,</p>
<p>publishing their private information,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re committing crimes on these platforms,</p>
<p>obviously the people that own these platforms</p>
<p>are gonna be like, we&rsquo;re not gonna allow this to happen.</p>
<p>So I understand that there is a line, right?</p>
<p>There is some, like people that say there&rsquo;s no line</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t really thinking, like there is a line.</p>
<p>I just thought that line seems to be moving all the time</p>
<p>and it seems to be a very hard thing to police.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think you can remove a guy off everything</p>
<p>and then also bank accounts won&rsquo;t give him debit cards</p>
<p>or credit cards, I don&rsquo;t know if you talked to him</p>
<p>about that, but like, you know,</p>
<p>there were financial institutions that were refusing</p>
<p>to let him park his money there.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it really does get pretty terrifying</p>
<p>pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Probably without any transparency from those companies.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right, it feels like there should be a process</p>
<p>of just having, for him to defend himself.</p>
<p>I think there needs to be a process</p>
<p>for people to defend themselves.</p>
<p>Every day I wake up and I go,</p>
<p>is something I said in a video gonna get taken</p>
<p>out of context, is somebody gonna get angry,</p>
<p>is somebody gonna be, you know, I say wild stuff</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what makes me laugh,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what makes my friends laugh</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what makes my audience laugh.</p>
<p>So I never ever, people, you know, whatever political side</p>
<p>you come down on, I think if you make your living speaking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always interesting to me if you are pro</p>
<p>the deplatforming, that&rsquo;s odd.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to consider a kind of a jury context</p>
<p>to where, you know, there&rsquo;s transparency</p>
<p>about why your video about bombing Disney World</p>
<p>might be taken down, like it gets taken down</p>
<p>and then there is, it&rsquo;s almost like creating</p>
<p>a little court case, a mini court case</p>
<p>and not in a legal sense, but in the public sphere.</p>
<p>And then people should be able to have, you know,</p>
<p>we pick representatives of our current society</p>
<p>and have a discussion about that and make a real vote.</p>
<p>You know, just have like jury locks himself up</p>
<p>in a discussion, that kind of process might be necessary.</p>
<p>Right now, what happens is Twitter is completely,</p>
<p>first of all, they&rsquo;re just mostly not aware</p>
<p>of everything they&rsquo;re doing, there&rsquo;s too much stuff,</p>
<p>but the stuff they&rsquo;re aware about,</p>
<p>they make the decision in closed doors meetings</p>
<p>and without any transparency to the rest of the company</p>
<p>actually, but also transparency to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And so, and then all they say is we&rsquo;re making decisions</p>
<p>because the people, they use things like violence.</p>
<p>So violence equals bad and if this person is quote unquote,</p>
<p>inciting violence, therefore that gives us enough reason</p>
<p>to ban them without any kind of process.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting, I&rsquo;m torn in the whole thing.</p>
<p>If it was indeed, there&rsquo;s no transparency about it,</p>
<p>but if Parler was indeed inciting violence,</p>
<p>like if there was brewing of violence, potential violence</p>
<p>where, you know, thousands of people might die</p>
<p>because of some kind of riot, like this is the scary thing</p>
<p>about mob, about when a lot of people get together.</p>
<p>Who are good people, like legitimately good people</p>
<p>that love this country, that don&rsquo;t see enemies</p>
<p>yet around them, but if they get excited together</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s guns involved and then some cop gets nervous</p>
<p>and shoots one person, another person shoots the cop</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a lot of shooting involved</p>
<p>and then it goes from five people dying in the Capitol</p>
<p>to thousands of people dying in the Capitol.</p>
<p>Well, in fairness to defend the people at the Capitol,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t shoot the cop, they bludgeoned him to death</p>
<p>with a fire extinguisher.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I do wanna just kind of put that out</p>
<p>as a defense of them.</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;m sure there was some wild shit going on</p>
<p>on Parler and I think the problem, here&rsquo;s the problem,</p>
<p>right, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that just wanna go on</p>
<p>these sites and say they wanna kill everyone.</p>
<p>And the problem is, you know, at what point</p>
<p>do you shut them all down?</p>
<p>Like I think a lot of people are just living in a world</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re powerless, they don&rsquo;t have any political</p>
<p>power, they don&rsquo;t have any economic power, right?</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t throw their money around.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have healthcare, their job security isn&rsquo;t great.</p>
<p>They might be living in a community that doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the resources they would like it to have.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not happy and thrilled.</p>
<p>And then they have these sites where they can go on</p>
<p>and just say, man, I&rsquo;d like to fucking burn it all down.</p>
<p>And distinguishing a guy blowing off steam</p>
<p>and saying wild stuff from a genuine threat</p>
<p>is a very hard thing to do, you know?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve threatened to kill, I got banned from Airbnb,</p>
<p>I threatened to kill the people that banned me,</p>
<p>comedically, comedically, this is a joke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to kill you, this is a joke</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m blowing off steam and I&rsquo;m angry.</p>
<p>Do you know how many people that my parents,</p>
<p>like my dad&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m gonna fucking kill this guy,</p>
<p>my mom&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m gonna fucking kill.</p>
<p>They were talking about each other.</p>
<p>But none of it ever happened, but we should be,</p>
<p>I think you have to create a space for people</p>
<p>to threaten to overthrow the government</p>
<p>as long as they don&rsquo;t violently do it.</p>
<p>I mean, does that make any sense?</p>
<p>I mean, as long as they&rsquo;re not gonna go hurt innocent people,</p>
<p>what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s so many people out there that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why a lot of these things like 4chan, these sites,</p>
<p>a lot of people going on there,</p>
<p>they just wanna say the most fucked up shit</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the thing that gives them,</p>
<p>they can laugh or they can release steam</p>
<p>and it is immature, it is stupid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not productive, it&rsquo;s not, you know,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not gonna give people health insurance,</p>
<p>you gotta give them something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when someone in this country dies</p>
<p>that everyone disagrees with, right?</p>
<p>Political figure, media figure,</p>
<p>a lot of people dance on their grave online</p>
<p>and then everyone, people goes,</p>
<p>and the other side will always do it.</p>
<p>Like if a conservative dies and everyone goes, great,</p>
<p>conservatives goes, this is grotesque that you,</p>
<p>and then when RBG dies, they all have parties</p>
<p>and the conservatives go, great.</p>
<p>You have to let people in this country</p>
<p>enjoy the deaths of their enemies.</p>
<p>You do because they don&rsquo;t have much else.</p>
<p>Again, if you gave them other things,</p>
<p>you might say, guy, you can go get an E operation.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you stop?</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re working for shit wages</p>
<p>and you haven&rsquo;t figured out a way to treat them,</p>
<p>treat their cancer diagnosis, and they don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>I mean, life, you know, you gotta,</p>
<p>you gotta derive pleasure from something, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting point that anger is a good valve,</p>
<p>like to, if your life is suffering,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something very powerful about anger,</p>
<p>but I still have hope that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be.</p>
<p>I mean, that kind of channeling into anger</p>
<p>that then becomes hate led us</p>
<p>into a lot of troubles in human history.</p>
<p>So you have to be careful empowering people too much</p>
<p>in that anger, especially, I think my,</p>
<p>I think I understand why people are nervous about Parler,</p>
<p>about Twitter and so on.</p>
<p>Because all that shit talking about violence</p>
<p>was now paired with let&rsquo;s get together at this location.</p>
<p>This was a new thing.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not just being on whatever platform talking shit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s saying we&rsquo;re going to in physical space meet.</p>
<p>And then everybody got, all these platforms got nervous.</p>
<p>Well, what happens when all these shit talkers,</p>
<p>all these angry people that are just steam,</p>
<p>letting off steam meet in a physical space.</p>
<p>And there was probably overreach,</p>
<p>almost definitely overreach,</p>
<p>but I can understand why they were nervous.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be,</p>
<p>and this is when Trump got elected</p>
<p>and when you have like, whatever you have, right?</p>
<p>Whether you have riots in Portland and Seattle,</p>
<p>where you have the Antifa people doing crazy things,</p>
<p>you have like the people storming the Capitol.</p>
<p>There never seems to be a ton of an examination</p>
<p>of why these ideas are becoming popular.</p>
<p>Why are people so angry?</p>
<p>What is leading people to this?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>What about their lives is to the point</p>
<p>where they need to show up at these places?</p>
<p>And like, and obviously there&rsquo;s going to be people</p>
<p>on the fringe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll always be the mentally unwell.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll always be people that want to destroy society.</p>
<p>But when you look at how popular,</p>
<p>large, long discredited things,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s fascism, totalitarian communism,</p>
<p>all of these things are like, why are they back?</p>
<p>Why are they back in a big way?</p>
<p>And why are people so fed up with the status quo</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re finding solace</p>
<p>in the most extreme discredited theories</p>
<p>of how to run and operate societies,</p>
<p>theories that have led to deaths of a lot of people.</p>
<p>So to me, I&rsquo;m like, if those people at the Capitol,</p>
<p>yes, if they were going to work,</p>
<p>if they were able to go out and drink at Chili&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if they were able to get a fucking checkup, right?</p>
<p>Like if their job paid a little bit better,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not saying that this is all the reason, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there&rsquo;s a lot of people there</p>
<p>that are doing quite well and they&rsquo;re still nuts.</p>
<p>But like the anger and the rage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s boiling to the surface of this society,</p>
<p>does it come from the fact that across the board</p>
<p>people in very different areas</p>
<p>and with very different political beliefs</p>
<p>feel like they are being fucked over</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing they can do about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the baseline to me,</p>
<p>they look at the people that run the country</p>
<p>and run the world, whether they&rsquo;re tech titans,</p>
<p>the guys that you talked to,</p>
<p>or whether they&rsquo;re people that run the government,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re people that run large banks,</p>
<p>large media companies,</p>
<p>the people that have created this kind of infrastructure</p>
<p>that everyone lives in,</p>
<p>these people are incredibly powerless.</p>
<p>And when you push people to that point,</p>
<p>logically, sadly, and unfortunately,</p>
<p>the next thing does seem to be violence.</p>
<p>Yeah, the thing that troubles me a lot</p>
<p>is you said nobody&rsquo;s asking why these beliefs are out there,</p>
<p>but sometimes it&rsquo;s not even acknowledged</p>
<p>that people are hurting, people are angry,</p>
<p>just even acknowledging that all the conspiracy theories</p>
<p>that are out there, acknowledging that they&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>And then people are thinking about it and talking about it</p>
<p>just because otherwise,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not acknowledged in this nuanced way.</p>
<p>What happens is you say,</p>
<p>okay, 70 million people are white supremacists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just throwing a kind of blanket statement.</p>
<p>And of course that gets them angrier</p>
<p>and makes them feel more powerless.</p>
<p>And that ultimately, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been painful for me</p>
<p>to see is that there&rsquo;s not an acknowledgement</p>
<p>that most people are good.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s circumstances where it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re pissed off.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because you are powerless.</p>
<p>I mean, most of us are powerless.</p>
<p>You could fall in with a bad crowd.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing, you can just fall in.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s not blame.</p>
<p>Obviously you have agency, you&rsquo;re a person.</p>
<p>But the idea that you could be rehabilitated,</p>
<p>you could do something stupid</p>
<p>or you could fall into a group of people that are,</p>
<p>and then in a few years you can go,</p>
<p>what the fuck was I doing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an ex drug addict.</p>
<p>I know what it&rsquo;s like to go from being one thing</p>
<p>to being another thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a drug addict.</p>
<p>If I would use drugs right now or drink,</p>
<p>I would still be addicted to them.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not something that I can ever change</p>
<p>about myself, but I know what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to go from one thing to another thing.</p>
<p>So when you look at racism or whatever ism,</p>
<p>homophobia, misogyny, whatever you&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>antisemitism, and you go, that&rsquo;s a fixed condition</p>
<p>where nobody&rsquo;s ever going to be able to change.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s ever gonna be able to be rehabilitated.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s ever going to be able to reimagine themselves</p>
<p>in a different way.</p>
<p>To me, you&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re throwing away someone</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re making them feel helpless and worthless.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna lead to antisocial behavior</p>
<p>that spills out into the violence.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a very redemptive society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge factor.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a redemptive society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I like O.J. Simpson.</p>
<p>Because O.J. Simpson, yes, he did a bad thing supposedly.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s very kind now on Twitter</p>
<p>and he makes very nice points about how we all have</p>
<p>to get involved in the political process</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s on golf courses and I like watching people golf.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do it, but I like watching him do it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like an elder statesman</p>
<p>because I remember him from the naked gun.</p>
<p>And I choose to forgive him for whatever happened there,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I choose to forgive him really for,</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, what they say is</p>
<p>he cut his wife&rsquo;s head off.</p>
<p>But I can look past that and redeem him</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s very stable on Twitter and he&rsquo;s a good,</p>
<p>like I see all these people going crazy on Twitter</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, O.J.&rsquo;s lived a full life.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a benefit to that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a benefit to kind of living a full life.</p>
<p>Yeah, how many of us have not at least tried</p>
<p>to murder somebody?</p>
<p>100%, listen, O.J.&rsquo;s had the highs and the lows,</p>
<p>but he did it on his terms.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a Frank Sinatra song.</p>
<p>Yeah, he did it my way.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a benefit to that.</p>
<p>And he seems like a very well adjusted person now.</p>
<p>So I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, how is that a fact?</p>
<p>But it is a fact and that&rsquo;s an uncomfortable fact.</p>
<p>Well, this is a strong case of forgiveness</p>
<p>in one of the more extreme cases, I suppose.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s not a process of forgiveness.</p>
<p>It seems like people just take a single event from your,</p>
<p>sometimes a single statement from your past</p>
<p>and use that as a categorical like capture</p>
<p>of the essence of this particular human being.</p>
<p>So murder might be a thing that you should get a time out</p>
<p>for a little while.</p>
<p>Murder is bad.</p>
<p>Murder, and let&rsquo;s just say that.</p>
<p>Murder is not good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you make this definitive statement.</p>
<p>O.J. is an interesting cat because you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s very stable on Twitter.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very like, he&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s take a look at it, guys.</p>
<p>Like we need more of his energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to say.</p>
<p>I know like, yes, it was bad.</p>
<p>He killed the woman in the waiter.</p>
<p>I was not for that.</p>
<p>I wish he didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>But the trial, the O.J. Simpson trial was such a fun thing.</p>
<p>And like you said, we need more fun people in society.</p>
<p>Speaking of fun people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve, your politics have been all over the place.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>I mean, imagine not,</p>
<p>imagine someone whose politics weren&rsquo;t all over the place.</p>
<p>It would seem odd.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>In the 10 years that I&rsquo;ve been politically conscious,</p>
<p>just because I&rsquo;m 35 and 20.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve probably been conscious for over two decades,</p>
<p>but like Democrats have become Republicans,</p>
<p>Republicans become Democrats.</p>
<p>I remember when Ann Coulter said,</p>
<p>we need to, he defended George W. Bush when he said,</p>
<p>we need to go out and Christianize</p>
<p>or modernize the Arab world.</p>
<p>We need to democratize the Arab world.</p>
<p>And then Ann Coulter backed Donald Trump.</p>
<p>And all the right wing in America believed</p>
<p>in nation building.</p>
<p>They believed in going out and democratizing areas</p>
<p>that might breed radical terrorists,</p>
<p>whether it was Iraq or wherever you were going,</p>
<p>toppling regimes and instituting</p>
<p>new democratic norms in those countries.</p>
<p>That was the right wing point of view when I grew up.</p>
<p>Then the right wing switched to,</p>
<p>we are going to be isolationist.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to take care of America.</p>
<p>First and foremost,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to go into other countries.</p>
<p>And then the Democrats who, when I grew up,</p>
<p>were doves and the right wing people were more hawkish.</p>
<p>And the Democrats were like,</p>
<p>the military solutions aren&rsquo;t the way.</p>
<p>We need to have multilateral diplomatic coalitions</p>
<p>to solve all the problems.</p>
<p>Now, Rachel Maddow&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s nuke Russia every night on MSNBC.</p>
<p>The Democrats are like,</p>
<p>we need strong presence in Syria.</p>
<p>We need a strong presence.</p>
<p>We need to counter Putin all over the globe.</p>
<p>We need to get, so they&rsquo;re more hawkish on things.</p>
<p>So literally I have watched two political parties</p>
<p>literally flip and it&rsquo;s crazy to watch.</p>
<p>And in some sense I&rsquo;ve watched that as well</p>
<p>because when I first saw Barack Obama,</p>
<p>I admired that he was against the war.</p>
<p>This is whatever, maybe before he was a Senator,</p>
<p>he spoke out against the Iraq war.</p>
<p>And then it doesn&rsquo;t feel like,</p>
<p>it feels like his administration was more hawkish</p>
<p>than dovish in a sense with all the drone attacks,</p>
<p>with the sort of inability to pull back,</p>
<p>or at least in mass efficiently pull back</p>
<p>from all the military involvement</p>
<p>that we have all over the world.</p>
<p>So, and just the language.</p>
<p>What I think is interesting about that,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting about Obama,</p>
<p>cause this is a very interesting study,</p>
<p>is that presidents are controlled in very different ways.</p>
<p>Presidents can be controlled by different factors,</p>
<p>power factions within Washington.</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons that Obama was maybe,</p>
<p>you had a very close relationship with John Brennan,</p>
<p>he was a CIA director.</p>
<p>And Obama was very close with John Brennan,</p>
<p>and Obama was very, I think malleable to the extent</p>
<p>that the CIA, and I&rsquo;ve had CIA agents on my show,</p>
<p>John Kiriakou, a guy who went to jail for exposing torture,</p>
<p>was saying that like, you get into the Oval Office,</p>
<p>all of a sudden you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>that presidential daily briefing every day,</p>
<p>and the intelligence people come in and they go,</p>
<p>listen man, I mean, there&rsquo;s gonna be a terrorist attack</p>
<p>on your watch if you don&rsquo;t do X, Y, and Z.</p>
<p>They go, they call it like blue book information,</p>
<p>which is five levels above top secret,</p>
<p>and they go like, hey man, a guy in Iran at a cafe</p>
<p>said he&rsquo;s blowing everything up next week,</p>
<p>and you know, I mean, it&rsquo;s the same thing as Parler,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>But now the president&rsquo;s making a decision</p>
<p>on usually a lot of uncorroborated intelligence</p>
<p>that goes into a presentation for the president,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just terrified every day,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want a terrorist attack on your watch.</p>
<p>Now, so why are they getting all this information?</p>
<p>Because a lot of the people in Washington</p>
<p>have an interest in perpetual, constant, ongoing warfare,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of financial gain to be had from that.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re sneaking their information</p>
<p>into the presentations that are going to the president,</p>
<p>and then the president is now behaving and going,</p>
<p>fuck, I don&rsquo;t want a bomb going off,</p>
<p>we gotta do what we gotta do.</p>
<p>And whatever version of that happens,</p>
<p>that is really kind of what is happening,</p>
<p>whereas the presidents are being controlled</p>
<p>by forces that are outside of the political sphere,</p>
<p>but very much still in it.</p>
<p>And they have a lot of, that&rsquo;s what the deep state is.</p>
<p>You know, Trump, there&rsquo;s a lot of ridiculing Trump</p>
<p>of going, the deep state doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>It absolutely exists, there&rsquo;s been books about it</p>
<p>written by liberal journalists.</p>
<p>The deep state is only a term for unelected, largely,</p>
<p>power factions in Washington, DC,</p>
<p>that outlive any presidential administration.</p>
<p>These are people that might work at the State Department,</p>
<p>they might work at the Defense Department.</p>
<p>These are people that are not always working officially</p>
<p>in any government capacity.</p>
<p>They might be private companies,</p>
<p>they might be military contractors,</p>
<p>they might be people at Boeing or Raytheon</p>
<p>or General Dynamics.</p>
<p>And they constitute a group of people</p>
<p>that Trump kind of called the swamp,</p>
<p>but Trump had really no interest in draining the swamp.</p>
<p>But he articulated these things, and this is what it is.</p>
<p>You have a lot of interested parties that have budgets</p>
<p>that they want, big budgets.</p>
<p>Everybody wants a budget in Washington,</p>
<p>whether you know what it is, they want money.</p>
<p>And these are the people who really control press.</p>
<p>So this idea that the president is the be all end all</p>
<p>has got to be smashed,</p>
<p>which is why the horse race model of politics</p>
<p>and being like, is it right wing?</p>
<p>Is it left wing?</p>
<p>Is it, what team am I on and what color am I wearing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simplistic, but the reality is this is an empire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s past its peak.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p>The United States is an empire past its peak.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>you could prove that case in court.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go to court right now.</p>
<p>But I do love the more complex idea</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s just human beings who crave power</p>
<p>and seek ways to attain that power through different ways.</p>
<p>If you have Barack Obama or George Bush or Donald Trump,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different attack vectors.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different ways to attain that power</p>
<p>and then you can use that to leverage.</p>
<p>And it probably doesn&rsquo;t have to be just in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who crave power all over the world.</p>
<p>Of course, but where we are now in Los Angeles,</p>
<p>these people are all good.</p>
<p>LA.</p>
<p>Studio executives and people that I,</p>
<p>from what I understand, they treat everyone fairly</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re nice, but he sees the bad guys,</p>
<p>but out here in LA, everyone&rsquo;s lovely.</p>
<p>So amidst this fun exploration in your mind</p>
<p>through the political landscape that you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>over the past couple of decades</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been conscious politically,</p>
<p>where does Donald Trump fit into this picture for you?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Well, he didn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>Cause we didn&rsquo;t, he wasn&rsquo;t political</p>
<p>until four years ago, right?</p>
<p>He got political very quickly before.</p>
<p>I mean, he was always firing off crazy tweets</p>
<p>about where Obama was born or whatever,</p>
<p>but he was, he got into politics like very quickly</p>
<p>and then he became the president, right?</p>
<p>So it was like, we didn&rsquo;t, I knew him as Donald Trump,</p>
<p>this crazy New York city character,</p>
<p>the coast of the apprentice.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think much about him.</p>
<p>He was just constant, you know,</p>
<p>like he was just this constant figure.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t think much about Warren Buffett.</p>
<p>Like I know like Trump&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s married to a new show girl all the time</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s always opening another casino and he&rsquo;s on TV.</p>
<p>Wait, Warren Buffett really?</p>
<p>No, Trump.</p>
<p>Trump, but like Warren Buffett is the opposite, right?</p>
<p>Warren Buffett&rsquo;s like been married for a billion years,</p>
<p>lives in a little house in Omaha,</p>
<p>but these are the, that&rsquo;s what I associate Trump.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t think about Warren Buffett.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about these people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just guys that I&rsquo;ve known forever</p>
<p>that have like, you know,</p>
<p>you associate certain things with them, right?</p>
<p>And Trump, we always associated with kind of vulgar,</p>
<p>garish, new money, billionaire, married a lot,</p>
<p>you know, casinos, Miss Universe pageants.</p>
<p>But again, you know, but it makes perfect sense</p>
<p>that he really was able to become president at the moment</p>
<p>where we were about to have Hillary Clinton versus Jeb Bush.</p>
<p>And I think Americans felt like this is,</p>
<p>now the oligarchy is spitting right in our face.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even making it feel like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an appearance of democracy.</p>
<p>We have two crime families</p>
<p>vowing for control of the country every four years.</p>
<p>And then there was this rogue kind of upstart guy</p>
<p>that was really about himself.</p>
<p>You know, Trump doesn&rsquo;t really care that much about the,</p>
<p>I mean, really was summarized perfectly when he left</p>
<p>and he just said, hey, have a good life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he said</p>
<p>before he got on Andrews Air Force Base.</p>
<p>If you watch his speech, he goes, hey, have a good life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he really feel.</p>
<p>Like, hey, have a good life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get on a plane right now</p>
<p>and fly to a castle I own in Florida.</p>
<p>And really, I&rsquo;m not gonna think too much about you people</p>
<p>outside of how I can get more attention in the future.</p>
<p>Can I ask you like a therapy question?</p>
<p>What is your favorite</p>
<p>and least favorite quality of Donald Trump?</p>
<p>So my least favorite quality of Donald Trump,</p>
<p>I think because there&rsquo;s a few of them,</p>
<p>his lack of empathy,</p>
<p>complete and total lack of empathy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel that he cares about human beings on any level.</p>
<p>And I feel like that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>maybe it should be a requirement, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think he cares.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s obvious that he doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I mean, he sent, you know, basically he&rsquo;s saying like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in there, Mike Pence is in there.</p>
<p>He knows that his people are going to get,</p>
<p>try to get into a Capitol.</p>
<p>I mean, those motherfuckers are not gonna have jobs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna go to federal prison and he doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>As long as they&rsquo;re storming the Capitol</p>
<p>to prove the point that he thinks he won the election,</p>
<p>he has no concern for these people, his followers.</p>
<p>He leads them lambs to the slaughter, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not a respectable quality.</p>
<p>My favorite quality of Donald Trump</p>
<p>is his willingness to call bullshit.</p>
<p>So his willingness to call bullshit out.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t play the game.</p>
<p>He will, you know, when people say about Putin,</p>
<p>Putin kills people, he goes,</p>
<p>we kill a lot of people here too.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s willing and able to break the fourth wall</p>
<p>and say things that no politician has ever said.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s willing to call out hypocrisy, you know,</p>
<p>of course not his own, but the media,</p>
<p>the members of the political establishment,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a laudable quality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an entertaining quality, right?</p>
<p>We all like it.</p>
<p>I love, I&rsquo;m like this guy saying something</p>
<p>that a lot of people want said.</p>
<p>That being said, it&rsquo;s coupled with no real work or action.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not coupled with anything behind it</p>
<p>that he just wants to,</p>
<p>we did an episode of my podcast once</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like essentially he&rsquo;s like criticizing</p>
<p>the deep state, he wants a deeper state.</p>
<p>He wants a deeper state.</p>
<p>Like he hired his daughter and her husband.</p>
<p>I mean, this is not a guy that&rsquo;s interested</p>
<p>in transparency and openness.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a guy that would just prefer,</p>
<p>he wants to run the mafia state.</p>
<p>But he shakes up the norms of social discourse,</p>
<p>political discourse, and that people</p>
<p>are just hungry for that.</p>
<p>Like he got banned from Twitter,</p>
<p>from all the different platforms.</p>
<p>Do you think, is there an argument to be made</p>
<p>for and against banning Twitter?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always arguments to be made for everything.</p>
<p>A permanent ban seems to be an overreaction to me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the president of the United States.</p>
<p>It also rearranges the power,</p>
<p>like whether you like him or hate him,</p>
<p>love him or hate him, he was the president.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve elevated Twitter is now more powerful</p>
<p>than the president.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, do you want that to be longterm the salute,</p>
<p>that the reality, like now Jack at Twitter</p>
<p>is more powerful than the president of the United States.</p>
<p>Is that a good paradigm going forward?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, listen, maybe give him a little time out</p>
<p>for a few days.</p>
<p>I think a time out, a little spanking, certainly,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if a permanent ban across the board</p>
<p>on every social media.</p>
<p>I mean, they banned them on Grindr.</p>
<p>I mean, this is how hilarious it is, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they banned them across the board on everything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he could get an Airbnb now, neither can I,</p>
<p>but like, I don&rsquo;t think he can do anything.</p>
<p>Again, I just, I look back and there&rsquo;s so many people,</p>
<p>my very smart, intelligent friends that go,</p>
<p>yeah, but who cares?</p>
<p>Yeah, but he&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, but blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I don&rsquo;t like Milianopolis.</p>
<p>Yeah, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you have such faith.</p>
<p>You have such faith that it&rsquo;s always gonna be the people</p>
<p>you dislike that are banned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always gonna be the, it&rsquo;s never gonna be you.</p>
<p>Man, you have so much faith in the government.</p>
<p>You have so much faith in tech oligarchs you&rsquo;ve never met.</p>
<p>You have so much faith in the security state</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna always make the right decisions</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not gonna penalize people</p>
<p>that shouldn&rsquo;t be penalized.</p>
<p>To me, I&rsquo;m like, wow, I&rsquo;ve never had that much faith</p>
<p>in any human being ever, including myself.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want that power.</p>
<p>I would start deplatforming people that I hate.</p>
<p>I would deplatform my aunt, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I would deplatform everyone I know.</p>
<p>I mean, so it&rsquo;s such an insane power to give somebody,</p>
<p>like who gets heard, who gets to speak?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m worried about the effect it has</p>
<p>on people like you, actually.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Of being, like everybody&rsquo;s a little more nervous</p>
<p>in what they say.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And that is a big problem.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because then you&rsquo;re just like longterm unmasked,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It has an effect where people just become more bland.</p>
<p>Yeah, self censorship, anxiety,</p>
<p>all of these things go into it.</p>
<p>We try to fight it.</p>
<p>I try to fight it.</p>
<p>I think I gotta still do what makes me laugh</p>
<p>and what makes me laugh is often fucked up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s often, it&rsquo;s not always fucked up in a way</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna get me thrown off something,</p>
<p>but I think pushing certain buttons is funny to me,</p>
<p>so I gotta keep doing that.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that so many of the lines</p>
<p>are blurred, right?</p>
<p>So you have comedians that are commentators</p>
<p>and commentators that are comedians and politicians.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s harder to get the defense of like,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m a comedian, leave me alone.</p>
<p>That defense becomes harder</p>
<p>when all of these lines are blurring.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s kind of everything now.</p>
<p>So like people say to me, you should run for office</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re serious and I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re crazy,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re serious.</p>
<p>Like, so the blurring of everything means</p>
<p>that people aren&rsquo;t in their lanes as much</p>
<p>and that you go, well, this guy is dangerous</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s not just making a joke.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing something else and he&rsquo;s using humor.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m really not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really just trying to make a joke.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all, that&rsquo;s really what I&rsquo;m trying to do.</p>
<p>But I do think that because of the flattening,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there that go,</p>
<p>they take aim at humor because they go,</p>
<p>humor is where bad ideas can kind of start and flourish.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you, to put some responsibility on you,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think humor is a way to,</p>
<p>that you are the modern,</p>
<p>like Jordan Peterson style intellectual,</p>
<p>that humor is actually a tool of.</p>
<p>It can be.</p>
<p>Changing the zeitgeist,</p>
<p>changing the social norms. It absolutely can be,</p>
<p>but it also cannot be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s any one thing</p>
<p>and I think there&rsquo;s a lot of pressure for a comedian.</p>
<p>You can be funny and right.</p>
<p>You can be funny and wrong.</p>
<p>If your goal is to be right,</p>
<p>you might end up being right and not funny.</p>
<p>So the reality is funny has to come first.</p>
<p>There are brilliant people that have been funny</p>
<p>and correct according to people, right?</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>people that put way too much faith in what comedy is,</p>
<p>most of what comedy is,</p>
<p>is people showing up to strip malls</p>
<p>and telling jokes for an hour</p>
<p>while people eat chicken fingers</p>
<p>and they all get drunk and they laugh</p>
<p>and they feel a little bit better about their lives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the majority of comedy.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s like 10 famous people that are really famous</p>
<p>that do a version of that in an arena.</p>
<p>But the amount of cultural power they have</p>
<p>has always been greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>My uncles loved George Carlin,</p>
<p>who was anti military industrial complex,</p>
<p>anti this, anti that.</p>
<p>And then they would go vote for Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as powerful as you think.</p>
<p>I wish it was.</p>
<p>It feels good.</p>
<p>It feels good for me to say I am the new thing.</p>
<p>It really isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It truly isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>No one is, comedians are the people that get on stage</p>
<p>and say, we&rsquo;re fucked up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re drug addicts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sex addicts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re fat.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gross.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t manage our money.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t stop eating.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t stop fucking doing horrible things.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re liars.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re narcissists.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re scumbags.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the people that get out and say that.</p>
<p>Only a psychopath would look at us and go,</p>
<p>show me the way.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I disagree with you because then I&rsquo;m a psychopath.</p>
<p>Well, and that&rsquo;s, I mean, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>no pushback here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another issue.</p>
<p>But you know what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Well, and I don&rsquo;t because, I mean,</p>
<p>I understand you using this as a psychological tool</p>
<p>for yourself to give yourself freedom.</p>
<p>But the reality is you are one of the rare comedians</p>
<p>like a George Carlin who is, besides being funny.</p>
<p>When I hear things like that, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;re being very sweet.</p>
<p>But like, I agree.</p>
<p>I understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I do stuff that makes, hopefully makes you think.</p>
<p>I hope that&rsquo;s what good comedy is.</p>
<p>But I think I try to do that.</p>
<p>But I also would hate to feel shackled to the idea</p>
<p>of that I had to make a point</p>
<p>and that point had to be correct.</p>
<p>I think the best comedy makes fun of everything.</p>
<p>It makes fun of both sides.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a deeper truth about humanity revealed.</p>
<p>But then what happens is people take that deeper truth</p>
<p>and go, let&rsquo;s politicize it.</p>
<p>But what does he mean?</p>
<p>Is it the right or the left?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m doing something that I think speaks</p>
<p>to hopefully people on both sides for everybody.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m making fun of people on the left and the right</p>
<p>and in the center and people that don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>and people that do care.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to figure out a way to do it.</p>
<p>But then immediately anything of value</p>
<p>in this culture right now is like, how do we politicize it?</p>
<p>How do we put it in a box?</p>
<p>So yes, I think comedy can produce a lot</p>
<p>of inherently valuable things, reflective, thoughtful things.</p>
<p>But then immediately, can it be put in this box</p>
<p>where all of those things can be used politically?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, like when they say like,</p>
<p>comedy is a great way to speak truth to power.</p>
<p>It is, but I don&rsquo;t know how much it changes things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much a joke can dethrone a king.</p>
<p>I know the idea is nice,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s look at the practical applications.</p>
<p>I mean, we had brilliant comics, Bill Hicks,</p>
<p>George Carlin, Richard Pryor.</p>
<p>We had people talk about so many problems in society,</p>
<p>illustrate them, put a spotlight on them.</p>
<p>And we still have them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re worse now than they&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>I think the society is better.</p>
<p>And so to push back in my perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible that those voices</p>
<p>were the exact reason we have the world today,</p>
<p>which I do believe is actually,</p>
<p>I mean, on the boring old measures</p>
<p>of what makes a good world,</p>
<p>which is the amount of violence in the world,</p>
<p>the amount of opportunity that all those kinds of measures,</p>
<p>even happiness, all of those things measured,</p>
<p>things have been improving.</p>
<p>Steven Pinker gets a lot of shit for this,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s really good at articulating</p>
<p>how the data says pretty clearly</p>
<p>that the world is getting better.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s arguable that the freedoms we do enjoy currently</p>
<p>are thanks to the comedic voices or the people who mock.</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s possible that humor</p>
<p>is the very thing that saves the world.</p>
<p>Humor is the very thing that keeps,</p>
<p>is the balance of power in the world.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of the things that those guys criticize,</p>
<p>whether it was militarism or the elites,</p>
<p>the lying, the corruption, the bribery,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still going on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always gonna go on, right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the nature of human beings.</p>
<p>We call it out, we point it out,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have a plan to change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really our job.</p>
<p>And I think that too much now is like,</p>
<p>well, comedians should have a,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t tell people who to vote for.</p>
<p>Like the idea that comedians</p>
<p>went and told people who to vote for,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, to me, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>I understand like people have strong opinions,</p>
<p>but like, I believe I have a job.</p>
<p>And my job is to make you laugh or whatever,</p>
<p>maybe make you think,</p>
<p>but like, my job is not to tell you who to vote for.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s absurd.</p>
<p>But see, the thing you do by the comedy,</p>
<p>like on your Twitter,</p>
<p>that people should definitely follow.</p>
<p>I believe that, Jim J. Dillon, I agree with you.</p>
<p>Oh, on this point of,</p>
<p>I agree with you wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>That people should follow you.</p>
<p>Yeah, you give me,</p>
<p>you give me freedom to think on my own.</p>
<p>Meaning like you&rsquo;re shaking things up</p>
<p>to where I don&rsquo;t feel constrained</p>
<p>about what I can think about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not telling me what to think,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving me the freedom to think.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what great comedy does,</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t often agree with George Carlin.</p>
<p>He can get pretty political sometimes.</p>
<p>But just the ability to do that&rsquo;s so rare.</p>
<p>Podcasts do that too now.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s certain people</p>
<p>that can really just challenge you to,</p>
<p>even when you disagree with them,</p>
<p>to sort of be like,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s okay to think about this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I appreciate that,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And I mean, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And a guy like you, who&rsquo;s a brilliant guy, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m giving you the license to think,</p>
<p>then man, the world is completely fucked.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m happy about that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, you know.</p>
<p>Speaking about the world being completely fucked,</p>
<p>Alex Jones turned on QAnon.</p>
<p>I know almost nothing&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very tough match.</p>
<p>They had a rough marriage.</p>
<p>They fought it.</p>
<p>They fought it out for years.</p>
<p>And eventually we just knew</p>
<p>someone was gonna leave someone.</p>
<p>Hewlett tried to leave him a few months ago.</p>
<p>Oh, so&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, he was staying at someone else&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>The car wasn&rsquo;t in the driveway.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the thing about QAnon that makes it a lot of fun</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s kind of a make it up as you go along.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a drug addict, right?</p>
<p>So often my lies aren&rsquo;t planned.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the moment.</p>
<p>A lot of what I do on the podcast,</p>
<p>a lot, you know, it&rsquo;s all in the moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have an idea what I wanna talk about,</p>
<p>and I rant and I go.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been like stoned,</p>
<p>and I show up at home,</p>
<p>and my parents are like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>There was $50 on the mantle.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>well, and I gotta make something up on the spot, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, you know, are you drinking again?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>And then you gotta have a,</p>
<p>well, you were gone for two days.</p>
<p>No one knows where you were.</p>
<p>And somebody said you left your car.</p>
<p>Well, I was at, well, this is,</p>
<p>I was at a sales conference and I left my car.</p>
<p>I flew to Phoenix.</p>
<p>Like, I understand what that is.</p>
<p>QAnon is an ever evolving conspiracy theory</p>
<p>where the events are happening in the past,</p>
<p>in the present, and in the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hilarious.</p>
<p>Every conspiracy theory is like Kennedy,</p>
<p>something like that,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of truth in that,</p>
<p>or all truth.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re looking back from 30,000 feet,</p>
<p>analyzing little things that have already happened.</p>
<p>QAnon&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>so I think Alex is kind of like got a little tired of</p>
<p>the constant evolving nature of that conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not a fan of like the jazz that is QAnon.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re improvising constantly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re improvising.</p>
<p>Alex is like, hey man,</p>
<p>I was on board a little bit,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting a little annoying</p>
<p>because it can turn on you.</p>
<p>Eventually you become part of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>Alex is controlled opposition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>Eventually you,</p>
<p>because QAnon just eats things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a conspiracy that just eats things.</p>
<p>The minute you start to say,</p>
<p>hey man, maybe that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it just eats you and go,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re in on it.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s in on it.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s a satanic pedophile.</p>
<p>Everybody.</p>
<p>Everyone that questions it is eating children.</p>
<p>And you go, wait a minute,</p>
<p>that seems illogical.</p>
<p>But now there&rsquo;s not enough children.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>And I think QAnon&rsquo;s over now, unfortunately,</p>
<p>because for these people,</p>
<p>but I think fortunately for them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have to find a new hobby.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s over now</p>
<p>because even the best QAnon people now are starting to go,</p>
<p>hey man, this might not be going down the way we thought.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve literally gone as far as to say</p>
<p>that like Biden and Trump switched faces.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s actually still the president except Biden.</p>
<p>You have to be a real moron now.</p>
<p>You gotta be real stupid now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at the end.</p>
<p>Like it was cool when the Epstein stuff happened,</p>
<p>QAnon was like, it was party at Q.</p>
<p>And then when the Hunter Biden laptop stuff</p>
<p>started to happen, they were like dancing,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>And then Biden wins and they&rsquo;re like, wait, whoa.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s the day after the party.</p>
<p>QAnon, if you ever went to a party in high school</p>
<p>or college, QAnon right now is the day after the party.</p>
<p>You wake up, it&rsquo;s 12 noon.</p>
<p>The sun is hitting you in the face.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hung over.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a stench of disgusting beer and cigarettes</p>
<p>all over the house.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, what the fuck happened here?</p>
<p>I gotta get out of here and get a bacon, egg and cheese.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what QAnon is.</p>
<p>They gotta sober up, get out of that house,</p>
<p>get a bacon, egg and cheese and go, man,</p>
<p>we were fucking whacked.</p>
<p>We were high, dude.</p>
<p>I thought Nancy Pelosi was eating children for four years</p>
<p>and that Donald Trump was gonna put her in Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p>Wow, that was, cause I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>People had to do that after the sixties.</p>
<p>They were like, yeah, I just did a bunch of acid</p>
<p>and I lived in a ranch in Malibu</p>
<p>and fucked everyone I ever saw.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, I thought that was the way</p>
<p>the world was gonna go and I followed some shaman guy,</p>
<p>some guru who just wanted to fuck me</p>
<p>and 10 other people that were living there.</p>
<p>And we did that for three years.</p>
<p>Apparently we never created the utopia</p>
<p>we thought we were gonna have.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m back working here at Allstate Insurance</p>
<p>and we have great policies and we&rsquo;d love you</p>
<p>to come in the office so we can break them down for you.</p>
<p>It all ends folks, all the love, all the bullshit ends,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fun, they have so much fun.</p>
<p>QAnon was hard to get mad at because they were,</p>
<p>this was all they had.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they were quite good at it.</p>
<p>And they were good at it and it was a lot</p>
<p>of desperate people, but they were also rich idiots.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also like dumb rich people</p>
<p>and those are like the saddest people in Q</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s like they should,</p>
<p>they have the resources to do other things,</p>
<p>but they just love Q.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m just into this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;re rich, go do something.</p>
<p>How in curious are you?</p>
<p>Go to the Amazon, go bird walk.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but they&rsquo;re, you know, so.</p>
<p>Play golf.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad, but they&rsquo;re like done now.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>I see you think this is the.</p>
<p>I think everything&rsquo;s ending.</p>
<p>My whole thing is that Trump&rsquo;s out, QAnon&rsquo;s over,</p>
<p>the quarantine is gonna end.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s gonna go back</p>
<p>to something that&rsquo;s more recognizable.</p>
<p>I think that.</p>
<p>Are you optimistic about the 2021 and what.</p>
<p>To a degree in certain aspects, I have optimism.</p>
<p>And then I have, I have short term optimism</p>
<p>and longterm pessimism.</p>
<p>Meaning that I think in the short term,</p>
<p>things can get better.</p>
<p>I think longterm, because there&rsquo;s so many forces</p>
<p>that are out of our control that are evolving</p>
<p>in ways I barely understand that are carving up society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be very tough longterm</p>
<p>to be completely optimistic.</p>
<p>Like, Hey, it&rsquo;s gonna be great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be good forever.</p>
<p>But short term, I think, yeah, this quarantine will end.</p>
<p>Things will get better.</p>
<p>The economy will get a little better.</p>
<p>The constant Trump craziness will die down a little bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my hope.</p>
<p>And people can go back to focusing on things that matter,</p>
<p>which is the things that are near you and close to you.</p>
<p>Yeah, the humans around you.</p>
<p>Humans around you, not Nancy Pelosi.</p>
<p>I have uncles that talk about Nancy Pelosi.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;ve never met her.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never meet her, shut up.</p>
<p>And I have a belief that this kind of local love</p>
<p>and kindness that you naturally can have</p>
<p>for human beings that you actually know</p>
<p>can be expanded at scale through the social networks</p>
<p>that we use, that we build.</p>
<p>Twitter is currently failing at that miserably.</p>
<p>That would be great.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>If we were able to increase the love</p>
<p>through the social networks, that would be great.</p>
<p>It feels very hard to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a worthy challenge.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve tweeted, one of the underreported reasons</p>
<p>conspiracy theories take hold</p>
<p>is because some of them are true.</p>
<p>What conspiracy theories do you believe</p>
<p>that are sort of important for people to think about,</p>
<p>would you say?</p>
<p>Kennedy was not killed by a lone gunman</p>
<p>with no connections to any other situation, government.</p>
<p>I believe that JFK was removed from office</p>
<p>by a group of people that had very different interests.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>This is the question of like deep state.</p>
<p>So these are powerful people that are able now</p>
<p>to dictate through basically the threat of violence</p>
<p>what the presidents,</p>
<p>the surface powerful people in our society.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, again, I&rsquo;m not&hellip;</p>
<p>I want another investigation into 9 11,</p>
<p>not because I think that George Bush pressed a button</p>
<p>and made 9 11 happen,</p>
<p>but because we invaded the country of Iraq.</p>
<p>And then we, 15 out of 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>There was tons of stuff in the 9 11 report</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t make sense to anybody.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tons of stuff about that day</p>
<p>that I feel like we just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I, my little aunt life</p>
<p>touched upon conspiracy theory world</p>
<p>and first learned about Alex Jones is when 9 11 happened.</p>
<p>It was very frustrating to me</p>
<p>how poorly the reporting and the transparency</p>
<p>around what exactly happened, who knew what,</p>
<p>all that kind of a basic information</p>
<p>that you would hope the government would release, reveal,</p>
<p>and use as like a lesson for how we prevent this.</p>
<p>Instead, it felt like a lot of stuff was being hidden</p>
<p>in order to manipulate some kind of machine</p>
<p>that leads us to war.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fair to say.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I just don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve gotten the full story.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the full story is.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know what it is,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t feel like we&rsquo;ve gotten the full story.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are groups of powerful pedophiles, right?</p>
<p>Whether they&rsquo;re in the Catholic church</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re in the government or wherever they are,</p>
<p>they are able to cover things up that they do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to silence people that try to out them</p>
<p>in terms of like, you know, disrupt their operations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>QAnon has nuggets of truth.</p>
<p>It just went crazy.</p>
<p>Any conspiracy theory that involves the Knights Templar</p>
<p>and also Chrissy Teigen is probably wrong, you know?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Knights Templar?</p>
<p>Well, it was just this group of Knights back in the day.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s that supposedly secret meetings.</p>
<p>And like in every conspiracy, they talk about like,</p>
<p>you know, if you go deep enough,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians,</p>
<p>you know, all of these secret groups throughout history,</p>
<p>the Illuminati, the&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, and there&rsquo;s a thread that connects all of this.</p>
<p>Oh yes, it connects it all to David Spade.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a little much.</p>
<p>Well, how do you, if you&rsquo;re David Spade,</p>
<p>defend yourself, by the way?</p>
<p>You ignore it because it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>And I know David Spade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Hollywood&rsquo;s kind of boring.</p>
<p>Yes, there are sex orgies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not invited.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s shit going on.</p>
<p>Kids do get abused, women get abused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll invite you to one.</p>
<p>Please, we got the $75,000 dog and then we&rsquo;ll get one.</p>
<p>But, you know, me and David Spade,</p>
<p>we go out to sushi restaurants, like,</p>
<p>and you sit there and you listen to people complain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a lot of it is.</p>
<p>What a lot of Hollywood is is deeply sad tragedy</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t understand that some of it is nefarious</p>
<p>and dark and there are problems</p>
<p>and there are real power brokers here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dark town, 100%.</p>
<p>But the idea that everybody that lives here</p>
<p>is in some wide ranging vast conspiracy isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>It ignores how humdrum, boring, deeply sad</p>
<p>most people&rsquo;s lives are in Hollywood.</p>
<p>And it ignores how sad fame is in general.</p>
<p>Fame&rsquo;s a sad thing.</p>
<p>Not always, but a lot of times it&rsquo;s a sad thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fleeting, it&rsquo;s ephemeral, it doesn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>It separates you from other people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s isolating.</p>
<p>It can be traumatic depending on what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s better than the alternative.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to be famous,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better to be famous than not famous, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a mixed bag to a degree.</p>
<p>There are things about it that aren&rsquo;t great.</p>
<p>And Hollywood has a deep undercurrent of sadness</p>
<p>of people that have not realized their dreams</p>
<p>and people that have realized them.</p>
<p>Both of those people.</p>
<p>The people that win Olympic gold medals</p>
<p>can sometimes suffer from depression.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>Well, somebody said, and I forget who said it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great quote, it&rsquo;s not mine.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s from a book, or it might be from a TV show.</p>
<p>Sometimes I quote something and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s from like, Charlotte&rsquo;s Web.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh.</p>
<p>The two worst things are,</p>
<p>oh, I think it&rsquo;s from the movie Limitless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like an idiot.</p>
<p>But anyway, thanks for having me on.</p>
<p>Tomorrow you&rsquo;re gonna make some genius.</p>
<p>I will not publish this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from the movie, and I think he says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The two worst things in the world are not good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, you know what&rsquo;s not from Limitless?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s from the movie</p>
<p>where Nicolas Cage sold weapons.</p>
<p>It was called Lord of War.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little better than Limitless.</p>
<p>Anyway. That&rsquo;s a good movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great movie.</p>
<p>He said, the two worst things in the world</p>
<p>are not getting what you want and getting it.</p>
<p>So the undercurrents of sadness</p>
<p>that run through Hollywood are,</p>
<p>there are two rivers that converge,</p>
<p>and there are people that just never had it,</p>
<p>and people that have it and go, now what?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a sad place, a tragic place.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of, it&rsquo;s boring.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t realize is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually kind of boring.</p>
<p>Well, life is kind of boring.</p>
<p>Life is kind of boring.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also like, you know,</p>
<p>so I think QAnon&rsquo;s this way to make a lot of it seem like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s super exciting.</p>
<p>And listen, I don&rsquo;t want to diminish the experiences</p>
<p>of people who&rsquo;ve been abused here,</p>
<p>because there is a lot of horror here.</p>
<p>But the whole QAnon thing was like,</p>
<p>everybody in everything is doing, and that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Well, see, just to linger on that a little bit is,</p>
<p>Bill Gates, the conspiracy theories around Bill Gates</p>
<p>bother me because, this is me, dumb, naive Lex,</p>
<p>thinks that Bill Gates did a lot of good for this world.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>First, by creating a company</p>
<p>that empowered personal computers.</p>
<p>And second, by donating a ton of money</p>
<p>for like treating malaria in Africa</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s these huge amounts of conspiracies, I think,</p>
<p>based on like just replies to whenever</p>
<p>Bill Gates does anything.</p>
<p>Like, to me, the top replies should be about</p>
<p>how inspiring that guy is, to donate so much money.</p>
<p>And so sorry to, the thing I&rsquo;m struggling with is,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m Bill Gates, like, how do you behave differently?</p>
<p>How do you show people that you&rsquo;re, if you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, doing creepy stuff</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re saying he&rsquo;s doing?</p>
<p>Well, I think part of it is that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s done some really good stuff, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an innovative guy, he&rsquo;s on the vanguard</p>
<p>of a lot of things, but he&rsquo;s also the antichrist.</p>
<p>And I think that that is, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>He is the prince of darkness, as well as some, no.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my deal with Bill Gates.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Batman villain billionaire,</p>
<p>meaning that he&rsquo;s not a villain,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s got all this money, right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, and I love Musk and all these guys,</p>
<p>I know you love these guys.</p>
<p>Listen, when you have the kind of money that these guys have</p>
<p>and you have the vision that they have,</p>
<p>and they want society to look a certain way,</p>
<p>and a lot of them are doing great things,</p>
<p>people, they need to get better at the pushback.</p>
<p>They need to get a little better.</p>
<p>When somebody says, hey man, what&rsquo;s going on over there?</p>
<p>Bill Gates needs to be a little better at going,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what, because, you know, Bill Gates has the money.</p>
<p>You know, I think once he wanted to shoot a missile</p>
<p>of dust at the atmosphere to help global warming,</p>
<p>and a lot of scientists were like,</p>
<p>hey man, that might not be the way to do it.</p>
<p>But no one in history, like so few people in history</p>
<p>have had the resources to even have that thought,</p>
<p>that if you have the resources to have that thought,</p>
<p>and you have designs on the way you want society to look,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s public health policy or vaccinations,</p>
<p>whatever, you have to get a little better</p>
<p>at dealing with legitimate critiques.</p>
<p>And obviously you&rsquo;re not defending yourself</p>
<p>against people that say you&rsquo;re the Antichrist,</p>
<p>but like, you need to get a little better.</p>
<p>And I feel like Bill Gates and some of those people</p>
<p>at that level are like, ugh, PR is kind of like, you know.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re terrible at it.</p>
<p>Him and Zuckerberg are really bad at it.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg&rsquo;s horrible at it.</p>
<p>He seems especially bad at public.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it makes me feel so bad</p>
<p>because the problem with being a billionaire</p>
<p>is you lose touch with reality if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p>
<p>I think Elon is good at, at least so far,</p>
<p>maintaining touch with reality.</p>
<p>No, if you look at the name of his child,</p>
<p>you can clearly see.</p>
<p>Listen, I do like him,</p>
<p>and I do think what he&rsquo;s done with Tesla,</p>
<p>you know, my producer has a Tesla,</p>
<p>and he never shuts up about it.</p>
<p>Most people that have Teslas never shut up about them,</p>
<p>and they think they&rsquo;re part of the development team</p>
<p>at SpaceX, and I like that he&rsquo;s created a world</p>
<p>where people can get excited about a $37,000 car</p>
<p>and never shut the fuck up about it</p>
<p>to the point where I have to threaten people</p>
<p>with physical violence to get them to stop telling me</p>
<p>about that their car drives itself.</p>
<p>Oh, you should get a Tesla.</p>
<p>Maybe have a few less drinks and a few fewer Vicodin,</p>
<p>and you can drive yourself.</p>
<p>Have you thought about getting a Tesla?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought about it.</p>
<p>You should get a Tesla.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like them, they&rsquo;re minimalist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like, I want more.</p>
<p>I want more.</p>
<p>Get the Cybertruck.</p>
<p>I want a Cybertruck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just being a, trolling you by being a salesman.</p>
<p>My producer wants a Cybertruck.</p>
<p>I want a stagecoach.</p>
<p>Old school, stagecoach, horse thief shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going back to that.</p>
<p>I live in an area with a lot of horses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going back to like whipping a horse.</p>
<p>I want an animal to shriek while I go by.</p>
<p>You want more suffering in the world, not less.</p>
<p>Oh, I think we need it.</p>
<p>Okay, but I just don&rsquo;t like that billionaire is a bad word.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not necessarily,</p>
<p>not every billionaire is a pedophile.</p>
<p>I know, but the problem is a lot of like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, you know, Epstein was very smart</p>
<p>at like just getting people at that house</p>
<p>and taking photos of them.</p>
<p>Nobody knew what they were doing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, it was one of those things where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Epstein was the most social guy ever.</p>
<p>Like every photo he&rsquo;s like, hey,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like everyone that&rsquo;s ever done anything</p>
<p>in the world has been at that fucking island.</p>
<p>Every human being is like in a photo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just weird, like I&rsquo;m in,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s funny me and my friends get together.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t ever take photos, right?</p>
<p>Like last night, a few people,</p>
<p>it was my birthday yesterday, I&rsquo;m 17.</p>
<p>And my friends came over and we&rsquo;re just eating dinner, right?</p>
<p>And we had a fun night,</p>
<p>and just four people that are over, nobody, right?</p>
<p>Nobody ever thought like, let&rsquo;s, hey, I wanna remember it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take photos, I&rsquo;m 36, woo!</p>
<p>But everything Epstein did,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just photos of everybody, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Do you think Jeffrey Epstein killed himself?</p>
<p>No, I think he was killed by that guy,</p>
<p>that guy that they put in his cell, that lunatic,</p>
<p>who was that big muscled guy.</p>
<p>I think he was just, he did it for money,</p>
<p>kept his mouth shut.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Money from whom do you think?</p>
<p>Mossad, MI6, CIA, all three.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of pressure</p>
<p>from a lot of different powerful people.</p>
<p>Probably Mossad, CIA more.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems very clear that he was working</p>
<p>inside of a honeypot intelligence operation.</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell&rsquo;s father was an Israeli super spy.</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell&rsquo;s working for Israeli intelligence.</p>
<p>It would be odd to think,</p>
<p>and of course the CIA knows about everything</p>
<p>that Israeli intelligence is doing with Americans.</p>
<p>So I would think that it&rsquo;s a very cozy relationship</p>
<p>with those two intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>And I think if you ran it by anyone,</p>
<p>I think if you ran it by French intelligence,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d go, yeah, no, get him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there was any intelligence service</p>
<p>in the world whose job is to protect the powerful people</p>
<p>that live in their countries</p>
<p>that was against him getting whacked.</p>
<p>But do you think it&rsquo;s possible that he&rsquo;s just an evil person</p>
<p>who is after manipulating people and also was a pedophile?</p>
<p>So that there&rsquo;s a bigger thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not factual that there&rsquo;s a bigger thing.</p>
<p>Evil people don&rsquo;t get handed.</p>
<p>Those are your facts, Tim Dillon.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s the facts of the case.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get handed a 65.</p>
<p>Show me another evil guy</p>
<p>who was handed a $65 million place by Les Wexner.</p>
<p>Show me another evil guy</p>
<p>that got that type of a handshake deal</p>
<p>where he was basically let off without anything</p>
<p>after a judge had made a very sweetheart deal for him</p>
<p>after he was accused of molesting a 14 year old.</p>
<p>Show me another evil guy</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have that kind of backing</p>
<p>that has those types of friends, those connections,</p>
<p>those types of properties.</p>
<p>Show me multiple passports all over the world.</p>
<p>So show me a guy without anyone backing him that&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>Why did they, so you think he&rsquo;s just an evil guy</p>
<p>who is doing this for whom is his own just shits and giggles.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just getting off on it.</p>
<p>Human nature, yeah.</p>
<p>Human nature, huh?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
<p>$70 million limestone mansion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being visibly mocked.</p>
<p>Yeah, is it human nature?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like poetry.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
<p>I think they manipulated human nature,</p>
<p>but I think they did it.</p>
<p>I think JustLane,</p>
<p>I think Epstein was really just a functionary</p>
<p>and I think JustLane was kind of a pimp</p>
<p>and Epstein was kind of a guy that made the money okay</p>
<p>and hid money and things like that</p>
<p>and worked for a lot of powerful people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in lone pedophiles anymore.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even believe that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a pedophile, you&rsquo;re like in a group.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not even going there,</p>
<p>but staying on JustLane,</p>
<p>so you believe there&rsquo;s some power in her.</p>
<p>What do you think happens to her now?</p>
<p>Like what are the differences?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;ll happen to her,</p>
<p>but I imagine she&rsquo;ll get some type of deal,</p>
<p>closed door thing years from now</p>
<p>when people don&rsquo;t really care about the case</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;ll serve some time in a very lax thing</p>
<p>or she&rsquo;ll be killed.</p>
<p>I mean, again, it&rsquo;s like if she was doing</p>
<p>what she was doing, which is I believe a fact</p>
<p>that she was compromising powerful people</p>
<p>so that they could be blackmailed</p>
<p>by the intelligence services of the US and Israel,</p>
<p>probably, I don&rsquo;t see how she wasn&rsquo;t doing that.</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s black, someone&rsquo;s using the photos</p>
<p>and the tapes, right?</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s using that against these people.</p>
<p>Someone wants to control these people.</p>
<p>Well, who and why?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real question.</p>
<p>And I think the real question is you wanna exert control</p>
<p>over congressmen and senators and presidents</p>
<p>because they have the power to make decisions</p>
<p>to affect the, but the CIA just works</p>
<p>for a lot of very wealthy people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the CIA, so how the CIA started, right?</p>
<p>It was lawyers, bankers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re protecting financial interests</p>
<p>of multinational corporations all over the world,</p>
<p>overthrowing democratically elected governments,</p>
<p>going in and doing subterfuge campaigns,</p>
<p>encouraging terror.</p>
<p>They were doing all kinds of crazy stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why that would change.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s who they still represent.</p>
<p>And I think those people want certain policies</p>
<p>and certain people pushed forward.</p>
<p>And I think those people are controlled.</p>
<p>And I think one of the ways to control people</p>
<p>is their sexual problems.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way they did it.</p>
<p>I wish there was a way to,</p>
<p>because everything you just said now is.</p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being indoctrinated on air.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s just a,</p>
<p>Jeff Ramsey is just a fun, random guy</p>
<p>who just wanted to make home movies of presidents?</p>
<p>Well, you think I&rsquo;m just some random guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to sell myself as somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s friendly with the American audience.</p>
<p>I believe you are backed by people</p>
<p>that want people to be more comfortable with robot dogs.</p>
<p>I believe that.</p>
<p>I believe you&rsquo;re pushed to be the happy face of AI.</p>
<p>Which is why I will edit this part.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t pick the happier face.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>No editing.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan&rsquo;s rule, no editing.</p>
<p>This is live.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I wish there was a way to,</p>
<p>for some of the conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>to prove that that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>Like what the CIA is.</p>
<p>There is some possibility in my mind</p>
<p>that institutions like the CIA</p>
<p>and different kinds of organizations</p>
<p>are driven less by organized malevolence</p>
<p>and more by just incompetence.</p>
<p>Just bureaucracy, being incompetent.</p>
<p>I think that argument gets less and less persuasive</p>
<p>when you look at all the things they&rsquo;ve been able to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very certain, just like you said,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a bunch of them that have done,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some conspiracy theories</p>
<p>that are dramatic and true.</p>
<p>The question is, I wish there was a way to prove</p>
<p>that some of them are not.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult,</p>
<p>because so much is shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>Like one of the things I&rsquo;m bothered by</p>
<p>is when people accuse other athletes</p>
<p>of using steroids, for example.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, yes, a lot of people use steroids,</p>
<p>but it sucks that people just don&rsquo;t believe you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some incredible athletes that look shredded,</p>
<p>that look just incredible performers,</p>
<p>and everybody just says that they&rsquo;re on steroids.</p>
<p>They kind of assume.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, and people accuse me all the time</p>
<p>of being on performance enhancing drugs and steroids.</p>
<p>And it is hard, but what I remind them is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what my appearance is a result of dedication.</p>
<p>But no, it&rsquo;s hard work, diet, exercise, dedication.</p>
<p>Are you on keto?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on, I&rsquo;m on keto.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a version of, you&rsquo;re keto, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m doing a version of keto right now with Brad.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, do you see what I mean?</p>
<p>You carb up in order to be able.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s keto with sugar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called keto plus sugar.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a good diet for,</p>
<p>I grew up in the 90s when nobody ever lost weight sadly,</p>
<p>because every diet was like,</p>
<p>you can eat what you want, just be accountable.</p>
<p>No one even knew what that meant.</p>
<p>So it would be like my mother being like,</p>
<p>if you have chocolate chip pancakes, have a glass of water.</p>
<p>Just take a walk around the block.</p>
<p>You can go to McDonald&rsquo;s three times a day.</p>
<p>Just walk around the block.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what my parents used to say.</p>
<p>My mother would be like, just walk around the block.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>Gonna have a cigarette?</p>
<p>Walk 20 steps, walk 20 steps back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exercise.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s too many conspiracies out there.</p>
<p>A lot of them aren&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>A lot of them are bitter, angry people</p>
<p>trying to justify their own impotence,</p>
<p>not being able to do anything in life.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like the people</p>
<p>that have done something in life, they&rsquo;re all nefarious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, the car just attacked against me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 100% true, 100%.</p>
<p>It attracts usually people</p>
<p>that have not figured out a way to succeed</p>
<p>or haven&rsquo;t succeeded on the level that they want to.</p>
<p>But that also being true,</p>
<p>there is a fair amount of fuckery going on and provable.</p>
<p>And, you know, we just have to, I think, separate,</p>
<p>know that these things are often inflated or not true,</p>
<p>but know that sometimes they are true.</p>
<p>Otherwise it wouldn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>If there was no, if there was nothing to JFK,</p>
<p>there was nothing to 9 11,</p>
<p>if people felt like they were being dealt with honestly,</p>
<p>this wouldn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>I mean, this exists because there are real questions</p>
<p>that people have that don&rsquo;t get answered for whatever reason.</p>
<p>And then the vacuum of the refusal to answer those questions,</p>
<p>that information vacuum is filled with people</p>
<p>like Alex Jones, who are curious</p>
<p>and sometimes they&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>and sometimes they&rsquo;re horribly wrong.</p>
<p>And sometimes they&rsquo;re all over the place.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re good storytellers and people love stories.</p>
<p>And then when there&rsquo;s an absence of actual.</p>
<p>Alex is a uniquely American person,</p>
<p>like a very interesting, I don&rsquo;t know how many countries,</p>
<p>like how many people make a living as a conspiracy theorist,</p>
<p>a good living in other countries, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>And he became like, I know people that knew him</p>
<p>when he was a kid,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d go to Austin and perform a lot.</p>
<p>And he was a guy that would take a bullhorn and yell at cops</p>
<p>because he thought DEI checkpoints were unconstitutional.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he was doing in college.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just went through, he was hated by the right.</p>
<p>He was hated by the Bush people.</p>
<p>He was hated by them.</p>
<p>And he went from being this guy</p>
<p>that was considered like a leftist even,</p>
<p>like even though he was never a leftist,</p>
<p>he was considered this like enemy</p>
<p>of mainstream conservatism.</p>
<p>Like he was not considered a guy that wasn&rsquo;t a patriot,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t this, wasn&rsquo;t that.</p>
<p>And he just, wow, like he whines and whines</p>
<p>and ends up just being this confidant</p>
<p>of a Republican president,</p>
<p>very divisive Republican president.</p>
<p>And he becomes this populist and everything like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really wild to watch that.</p>
<p>But I mean, I do think he should retire eventually</p>
<p>just so we could get some, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it seems like it&rsquo;s a lot to keep doing.</p>
<p>Well, I hope this world allows for Alex Jones</p>
<p>to continue having a voice because just like you said,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a, use the word fun,</p>
<p>but really he shakes up the norms of our discourse.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>I do think we need to put more value.</p>
<p>I think entertainment, we do need to say</p>
<p>that like there are people that should be allowed</p>
<p>to have a voice for entertainment purposes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of what Donald Trump,</p>
<p>now that he&rsquo;s not the president,</p>
<p>come on, let the guy, let him talk.</p>
<p>Who do you think is the best comedian of all time?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Greatest of all time.</p>
<p>You mentioned Carlin, your uncle&rsquo;s liking Carlin.</p>
<p>Well, Carlin is great.</p>
<p>Carlin is really hard to argue with,</p>
<p>but Chappelle is also really great.</p>
<p>Louis C.K. is really great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s what Joan Rivers is great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You smile at that.</p>
<p>Well, she&rsquo;s a beast of a comic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of her standup actually.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a beast of a comic.</p>
<p>Ask Rogue and ask any of them.</p>
<p>Kennison&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So what makes a great comic do you think</p>
<p>in the history of comedy?</p>
<p>Just like that.</p>
<p>Said something at the moment in a way,</p>
<p>found a way to communicate with people</p>
<p>in the funniest possible way at that moment</p>
<p>and illustrated larger truths about life in what they did.</p>
<p>And I think that guys like Louis and Chappelle</p>
<p>and Pryor and Kennison and Hicks,</p>
<p>people like Joan Rivers have done that.</p>
<p>And even modern people,</p>
<p>people like Maria Bamford&rsquo;s an amazing comedian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a different style of comedy per se,</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s an amazing comedian.</p>
<p>Cat Williams is an amazing comedian.</p>
<p>He really is.</p>
<p>Does he have any, was he the one of the things</p>
<p>you kind of mentioned, the communities you mentioned,</p>
<p>they were kind of fearless in saying</p>
<p>the difficult things that needs to be said.</p>
<p>Cat Williams is more, I don&rsquo;t remember his comedy,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s just more wild out there.</p>
<p>Well, to an extent that you can watch it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got stuff.</p>
<p>He talks about stuff.</p>
<p>He talks about race brilliantly.</p>
<p>He talks about America brilliantly.</p>
<p>No, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff there.</p>
<p>Of course, Chris Rock.</p>
<p>Of Chris Rock, of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really pick one.</p>
<p>You just gotta, there&rsquo;s a class of people</p>
<p>that throughout this history of this business,</p>
<p>which is not that long of a history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much within the last century,</p>
<p>that have been really influential.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s style, the way they deliver things.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s substance of how they, what they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>or sometimes it&rsquo;s just a style of what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re only talking about standup comedians, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a million great comedians.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re gonna talk about Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler</p>
<p>and Chris Farley, these are brilliant.</p>
<p>And those guys are bigger influences on comedy,</p>
<p>I think, than standups, really, truly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s so many brilliant people in the business.</p>
<p>Who was, for you, influential, just early on?</p>
<p>Hicks was influential, because I&rsquo;d watch Bill Hicks,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be like, this guy&rsquo;s saying crazy shit on stage,</p>
<p>and this is the only way he can get away with it,</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>And he was calling out the military industrial complex,</p>
<p>and he was talking about the first Gulf War.</p>
<p>I remember he said a joke that I heard.</p>
<p>It made me sit up straight, and he goes,</p>
<p>he was in Canada, and he said, we had a war in the States.</p>
<p>He was talking about the first Gulf War.</p>
<p>And he said, I was in the unenviable position</p>
<p>of being for the war, but against the troops.</p>
<p>And to me, I love that joke.</p>
<p>It was so funny to me, and I was like,</p>
<p>oh, you can&rsquo;t get away with that anywhere</p>
<p>other than standing on a stage.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t ever say that in an office, really.</p>
<p>And this was before, like, it was like PC,</p>
<p>and they said, the other thing,</p>
<p>I always knew that comedians had to say shit</p>
<p>and have it be funny enough</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t get away with it in polite society.</p>
<p>That was the whole point.</p>
<p>That was why it was a dark theater or a dark nightclub.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when people had a few drinks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the art form was, and that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>So a guy like that was influential</p>
<p>because I started watching him.</p>
<p>And then, of course, I loved SNL when I was a kid,</p>
<p>and I would watch Chris Farley,</p>
<p>and I would watch people like even John Belushi</p>
<p>going back in the day, but I&rsquo;d watch Adam Sandler</p>
<p>and Will Ferrell and all these guys.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many funny people,</p>
<p>but Bill Hicks was kind of funny.</p>
<p>And then Patrice O Neill was probably my favorite comedian</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s made me laugh more than anybody else.</p>
<p>So I think it was you, actually,</p>
<p>that maybe on your podcast,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about Patrice O Neill</p>
<p>and that he was actually vicious to others.</p>
<p>I think he was a little mean to other people,</p>
<p>but he was very good to people that he liked, I guess.</p>
<p>I think he was like not, I mean, he wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve never met him.</p>
<p>I have no inside info, but from what I&rsquo;ve heard,</p>
<p>he was like no nonsense guy, right?</p>
<p>He just said what he wanted to say.</p>
<p>But I think in terms of comedians,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of anyone funnier than Patrice O Neill</p>
<p>who said, in modern times,</p>
<p>that said more about our society than him.</p>
<p>I mean, he was just a brilliantly funny guy.</p>
<p>On the radio, he was funny.</p>
<p>On his specials, he was funny.</p>
<p>Everywhere, he was funny.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something else to be said</p>
<p>about the whole medium of comedians doing podcasts.</p>
<p>Because it unlocks a weird, special, new thing</p>
<p>that changed everything.</p>
<p>I mean, Rogan started with that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a whole nother form</p>
<p>of like standups, the ones that have a lot to say.</p>
<p>Almost like we get to witness the process</p>
<p>of the creation of the jokes in a way, or the mind.</p>
<p>The sort of the evolution of the mind behind the jokes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>Comedians relate to social media.</p>
<p>Comedians, comedy&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a performance based medium.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about getting up and doing it,</p>
<p>getting up in a club, getting up in a theater,</p>
<p>getting up in a bar, getting up wherever you can get up.</p>
<p>And comedy for years was about performance.</p>
<p>And then on the higher end,</p>
<p>it was about movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>But we were very slow to get on YouTube.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very slow to adapt to technology.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very slow to monetize anything we did on the internet.</p>
<p>So podcasting was a way for comics and funny people</p>
<p>to kind of get into that space, start earning money.</p>
<p>And now because of the pandemic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really become essential.</p>
<p>And it helps you, and even without the pandemic,</p>
<p>it was how you were building a fan base.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like, but comics were very reticent</p>
<p>to embrace social media at all</p>
<p>because they thought it was cheap and they didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>And they thought the people on it were idiots</p>
<p>and were unfunny and it was just a blatant,</p>
<p>whatever it was, whether it was a money grab</p>
<p>or it was just too commercial in a sense</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re like, hey, look at me.</p>
<p>Like it was just goofy, right?</p>
<p>And then comics, I think got displaced</p>
<p>because all the YouTubers came in</p>
<p>and all the social media stars came in</p>
<p>and they really knocked comics off</p>
<p>because now people are much more,</p>
<p>like if you ask anyone under 30</p>
<p>who their favorite comedian is, they say David Dobrik.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s a funny guy, but like what you,</p>
<p>not especially to me a ton, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, but he makes people laugh, so he&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s what people, that&rsquo;s a comedian now.</p>
<p>So comics got beat by other people coming</p>
<p>into a digital space before they did laying the groundwork</p>
<p>and taking it over.</p>
<p>And now comics are just trying to stay alive.</p>
<p>Like even my podcast, which is people really like it,</p>
<p>thank God, and I love doing it.</p>
<p>The Tim Dillon Show.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>I was late, you know, I mean, I was, I just, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been podcasting for a long time,</p>
<p>but really dedicating myself</p>
<p>and putting the resources behind it, I was late to it.</p>
<p>Like, I was like, hey, I&rsquo;m telling jokes on stage,</p>
<p>which is great, but I should have been allocating more time</p>
<p>to building an infrastructure online.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t doing it and a lot of comics weren&rsquo;t doing it.</p>
<p>Funny comics weren&rsquo;t doing it.</p>
<p>Comics should be doing it.</p>
<p>And I think when the pandemic ends,</p>
<p>a lot of comics will just keep doing live standup,</p>
<p>but I will keep, obviously I&rsquo;m gonna go back on the road</p>
<p>and do live standup, but I will keep doing this podcast</p>
<p>and building digitally too.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also exploring ideas.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing like short videos and so on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to look for different mediums of how to be funny.</p>
<p>I wanna be funny everywhere.</p>
<p>I love making things too.</p>
<p>My producer, Ben Avery, is like a brilliant editor</p>
<p>and comedic mind, even though he&rsquo;s not a standup.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s able to, he understands funny,</p>
<p>he understands what makes me funny.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re able to make these really, I mean,</p>
<p>some of those videos, they&rsquo;re just brilliant little videos,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re tiny little videos,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking as funny as anything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s me working with somebody else</p>
<p>to make something really great.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that relationship that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>In some sense, the medium of a short video is a challenge,</p>
<p>just like the medium of a short tweet.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>How to say something.</p>
<p>I mean, whatever the flavor is of what&rsquo;s in your heart,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in your mind, how to say it,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the goal is funny or something,</p>
<p>or just an expressing idea.</p>
<p>I think the whole thing that&rsquo;s important to us</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s an extension of,</p>
<p>really like an extension of your friendship in a way.</p>
<p>Like, are you guys laughing at it?</p>
<p>Are you guys making each other laugh about this idea?</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>other people are going to laugh at it.</p>
<p>I think so much of the old medium was like,</p>
<p>everything was top down.</p>
<p>Okay, pitch me this idea.</p>
<p>I pitch it to the showrunner.</p>
<p>They pitch it to the network.</p>
<p>They pitch it to this, to that, to that.</p>
<p>Standards and practices, sales,</p>
<p>and we got to go through everything.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s just like, are me and a few buddies</p>
<p>or even just one buddy laughing at this idea?</p>
<p>Does it captivate us?</p>
<p>And do we see it visually?</p>
<p>And also a great line from Roseanne,</p>
<p>a guy, not Roseanne, but a guy that worked on Roseanne,</p>
<p>the old Roseanne, the great one.</p>
<p>He said, is it funny with the sound off?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we try to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Is it funny with the sound off?</p>
<p>When you see me in the dumb things,</p>
<p>or me in the Meghan McCain, or me in the thing,</p>
<p>is it funny with the sound off?</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s funny with the sound off,</p>
<p>you have a good starting point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious, because you,</p>
<p>I would say you&rsquo;re one of the people,</p>
<p>because most people are not funny with the sound off,</p>
<p>most comedians.</p>
<p>Like you, Will Ferrell&rsquo;s another example of that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about when I click on one of your videos,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny, just like the first thing I see, just your face.</p>
<p>We, well, thank you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very sweet.</p>
<p>But I mean, thank God.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what we try to do, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to be funny.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to be funny.</p>
<p>Can we talk about love a little bit?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So you came out of the closet as being gay</p>
<p>when you were 25.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was late, very late.</p>
<p>Very late.</p>
<p>Before then.</p>
<p>By today&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<p>During and after, how has your view on love evolved?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to say, because like I would,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to make a very like Disneyfied statement</p>
<p>about like that you can&rsquo;t be in love secretively.</p>
<p>You should be honest.</p>
<p>Love should all be about honesty, but that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that are in love</p>
<p>that are lying to everyone else,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re deeply in love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would love to say something like,</p>
<p>honesty is an ingredient for love, you know?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, maybe honesty with each other.</p>
<p>But I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people in the world</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t honest.</p>
<p>My view on love is super important.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s, a lot of society in America</p>
<p>is all about love.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t tend to focus on other things</p>
<p>in terms of like, you know, friendship</p>
<p>or sustainability of that.</p>
<p>Cause I think that a lot,</p>
<p>I know a lot of people in relationships where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, they&rsquo;re not, they are, they love each other,</p>
<p>but like, it&rsquo;s also a rock solid couple</p>
<p>because they are, they&rsquo;re very compatible</p>
<p>in many other ways.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I think that like,</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re friends.</p>
<p>They have, right.</p>
<p>I see friendship and love as the same thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just parts of it that are, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I look at it as like,</p>
<p>there is, there needs to be more than just like that,</p>
<p>like amazing, like chemistry or physical attraction</p>
<p>that is this chemical thing that happens.</p>
<p>There should be like some underlying,</p>
<p>I mean, again, that&rsquo;s from what I,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve observed as really long lasting,</p>
<p>successful relationships.</p>
<p>Well, is there something about coming out that,</p>
<p>that was, that you took away,</p>
<p>that you remember as profound,</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That it was my, that I, it wasn&rsquo;t society, it was me.</p>
<p>So there were kids that were out in my high school</p>
<p>that I waited years later to do it.</p>
<p>That was no one&rsquo;s fault but my own.</p>
<p>So I was taking a cowardly way out</p>
<p>and a lot of people.</p>
<p>So I could blame society or like,</p>
<p>oh, I lived in a conservative area</p>
<p>and I grew up in that.</p>
<p>You should take responsibility for your own decisions.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re being cowardly,</p>
<p>admit that you&rsquo;re being cowardly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I took out of it is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not society&rsquo;s fault that you chose to be a coward.</p>
<p>Society will never be perfect.</p>
<p>You have to be honest when you&rsquo;re ready to be honest</p>
<p>or however you want to be honest,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not somebody, too much now</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s everyone else&rsquo;s fault that you didn&rsquo;t take,</p>
<p>make a hard choice or a hard decision.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of what I took out of it.</p>
<p>So now in retrospect, you see yourself as,</p>
<p>were being afraid.</p>
<p>Do you think at the time?</p>
<p>Well, I wanted people to like me,</p>
<p>which is the disease of humanity, right?</p>
<p>Is that we want to be liked.</p>
<p>And what happens is if you want people to like you</p>
<p>and love you even,</p>
<p>you want people to feel comfortable with you.</p>
<p>And those were people like your family?</p>
<p>Friends more.</p>
<p>My family I would always,</p>
<p>could always throw in the street,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>
<p>I mean, but I am not,</p>
<p>but my friends, my circle of friends,</p>
<p>which I were my family at the time when you&rsquo;re a senior,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re 10th, 11th grade in high school,</p>
<p>your friends are your family.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s your,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t want to do anything</p>
<p>that puts you on the outside of the circle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just thinking back to that fear.</p>
<p>Is there things you&rsquo;re afraid of now?</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re not doing, you&rsquo;re afraid to do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of all kinds of things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of not being good at my job,</p>
<p>not being funny, letting people down,</p>
<p>not putting out products that are good,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the podcast every week or stand up</p>
<p>or the videos,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m afraid of like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a ton of people that really enjoy what we do.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re in that position,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re nervous that you&rsquo;re going to start doing things</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>So the new things you want to do,</p>
<p>the evolution you want to do,</p>
<p>you want to make sure you&rsquo;re evolving in the right way.</p>
<p>You want to make sure that you&rsquo;re doing things</p>
<p>that are consistent with why people liked you,</p>
<p>but also you don&rsquo;t want to put yourself in a box</p>
<p>and limit what you can be going forward.</p>
<p>So like, I had a talk with the CEO of NBC Universal once.</p>
<p>I was doing some internal sketch for them.</p>
<p>And I was playing like a cab driver and he was a,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not the current CEO, but he&rsquo;s a former CEO.</p>
<p>And I said to him, what&rsquo;s the hardest part of running</p>
<p>a corporation of this size?</p>
<p>And he said something very interesting.</p>
<p>He said, the hardest part is maximizing</p>
<p>the current profit model of what you have</p>
<p>at the same time, getting ready, getting ready,</p>
<p>getting the company ready</p>
<p>for where it&rsquo;s going to be in five years.</p>
<p>He said, those are often at odds.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the toughest thing.</p>
<p>He goes, cause I could just bang out</p>
<p>everything I got to do right now.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to make a lot of money doing this,</p>
<p>but am I devoting enough resources into digital</p>
<p>so that in five years, when that&rsquo;s where everything lives,</p>
<p>are we competitive in that space?</p>
<p>So as funny as I am now, hopefully to people</p>
<p>and a lot of the things that I want to do now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going, what am I, what groundwork am I not laying</p>
<p>for three to five years down the road</p>
<p>so that I can be adapting to the trends</p>
<p>that are important then in terms of not so much</p>
<p>comedic trends, but like the technological trends,</p>
<p>like what is the, what is the, you know,</p>
<p>I should have done podcasting earlier.</p>
<p>What should I, should I have a bigger presence on TikTok?</p>
<p>Should I have a bigger presence here?</p>
<p>Should I have a business, or should I be on Twitch?</p>
<p>Should I be doing this?</p>
<p>Should I be doing that?</p>
<p>What am I not doing that I should be doing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll regret not doing?</p>
<p>And those are, those are the conversations</p>
<p>I think I have in my own head all the time.</p>
<p>And I guess there&rsquo;s parallels to coming out as gay</p>
<p>or just parallels in like a career path</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re taking all that, that&rsquo;s ultimately just fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fear. Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fear of, you know, the best thing that happened</p>
<p>in my career was that I came to LA.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have an idea of what was going to happen.</p>
<p>I met somebody who was really committed</p>
<p>to making funny things that we just wanted to be funny.</p>
<p>No one would let us be funny.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have Comedy Central letting us be funny.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have HBO, we didn&rsquo;t have Netflix.</p>
<p>We just had a garage and a phone in the beginning</p>
<p>and then a camera and then a thing.</p>
<p>And we just wanted to be funny.</p>
<p>And that was the greatest risk really I took</p>
<p>because I was like, well, I don&rsquo;t know what else</p>
<p>is going to happen right now, but I just want to be funny.</p>
<p>And funny saved my life, right?</p>
<p>I mean, funny got me out of drugs.</p>
<p>Funny probably got me out of the closet.</p>
<p>Funny was the thing that I was able to do</p>
<p>that made everything okay in my own head.</p>
<p>So I was like, as long as I&rsquo;m being funny,</p>
<p>something good will happen.</p>
<p>So we did that and then something really cool happened</p>
<p>that we were able to do a lot of cool things,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fear that keeps you from being</p>
<p>the better version of yourself.</p>
<p>Your mom, I mean, you have so many complicated,</p>
<p>fascinating parts of your story.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Your mom, as you were growing up, suffered.</p>
<p>Schizophrenic, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, from mental illness, yeah, schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Can you tell her story and how that relationship</p>
<p>has changed over the years?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, she was always eccentric and always,</p>
<p>you know, the terms for schizophrenia</p>
<p>in an Irish Catholic household</p>
<p>where we didn&rsquo;t talk about anything were eccentric, fun.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a theme to this conversation.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s unpredictable.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a wire, she was a live wire.</p>
<p>Any of the words you would use to describe somebody</p>
<p>who was a fucking lunatic, but you wouldn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>Pop that spin.</p>
<p>Right, she started experiencing symptoms</p>
<p>probably early on in her life,</p>
<p>but she also, I think, started really manifesting them</p>
<p>when I was in my mid teens, so like 14, 13, 14 area.</p>
<p>And she got really, really bad.</p>
<p>And then I think she was institutionalized</p>
<p>about 10 years ago, a little over 10 years ago.</p>
<p>And she could really no longer live on her own.</p>
<p>She was unable to go to work.</p>
<p>She was unable to function.</p>
<p>So I visit her when I can.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m not in New York.</p>
<p>Whenever I go to New York, I visit her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s aware of what I do, my career and everything like that.</p>
<p>She has good days and bad days,</p>
<p>but mental illness is a thing that&rsquo;s very tough.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t talk about it as a society.</p>
<p>People with mental problems don&rsquo;t get that much attention.</p>
<p>We tend to think that they did something wrong</p>
<p>or that they deserve it or that they are to be ignored.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t devote a lot of resources into it,</p>
<p>which is unfortunate because then you have the junk gurus</p>
<p>come in and go like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s diagnose your mental illness off Instagram.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s not the move.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you love her?</p>
<p>I do, I do.</p>
<p>I love her, but I also remember her that isn&rsquo;t her now.</p>
<p>And when someone has mental illness that&rsquo;s severe,</p>
<p>you make peace with their death before they die.</p>
<p>Wow, yeah.</p>
<p>Because the part of them that you love and remember</p>
<p>a lot of cases is not evident or obvious.</p>
<p>Now, my mother&rsquo;s still a loving person that I love,</p>
<p>but the fun, her ability to be present in the moment</p>
<p>and to not, that is lost with the progression of realness</p>
<p>so that you still love her.</p>
<p>And I mean, again, your parents,</p>
<p>the time horizons you have with your parents are unknown.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I have friends that their parents were in their lives</p>
<p>for their entire life.</p>
<p>And I have friends whose parents were in their life,</p>
<p>but my mother was a very, she knew what I was.</p>
<p>When I was a little kid, I was an actor.</p>
<p>When I was like six to 12,</p>
<p>my mother knew that I was a performer.</p>
<p>She knew what I was and what I&rsquo;d ultimately do.</p>
<p>She recognized that in me.</p>
<p>And when I said to her, I want to audition for shows,</p>
<p>I want to be on stage, I want to be on this,</p>
<p>I want to do this, she let me do it</p>
<p>because she knew who I was</p>
<p>and she didn&rsquo;t want to get in the way</p>
<p>of me being a human being, a fully realized person at six.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably the best thing a parent can do for a kid</p>
<p>is let them be who they are.</p>
<p>And my mother did that.</p>
<p>So that, I mean, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>We ate too much fast food.</p>
<p>There were negatives, but she did let me be who I was.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you want to throw them out into the street.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes.</p>
<p>But coming to accept the mortality of her,</p>
<p>I guess, identity as you remember it from childhood,</p>
<p>do you ponder your own mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of death.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the idea of death, but I know it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s going to happen eventually.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love it.</p>
<p>Do you think about it?</p>
<p>I think about, I want to do some good stuff</p>
<p>that people can look back at.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m proud of the show</p>
<p>where if people look back at the show,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how comedy ages or whatever,</p>
<p>but I think I put out a lot of stuff</p>
<p>and I want to continue to put out stuff</p>
<p>and I want to put out a few specials</p>
<p>that people can look back at and go,</p>
<p>oh, this guy was really funny in this really crazy,</p>
<p>he lived in the latter part of this century</p>
<p>when all this shit was going on.</p>
<p>And he kind of made fun of it.</p>
<p>And he did something to make people&rsquo;s lives a little better</p>
<p>just by having a few laughs.</p>
<p>What do you think about,</p>
<p>this is something like in the podcast context,</p>
<p>do you think you&rsquo;ll have just one or two or three shows</p>
<p>out of thousands maybe that are like the truly special ones?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the case.</p>
<p>Or do you think it&rsquo;s an entirety of the body of work?</p>
<p>I think people will take 10 minute clips</p>
<p>from all different shows and put them together.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a highlight.</p>
<p>Yeah, like a highlight reel of just like,</p>
<p>these are like the best things that he&rsquo;s ever done</p>
<p>or the best rants he&rsquo;s ever had,</p>
<p>the best things, whatever.</p>
<p>So the legacy would be that this was an important voice</p>
<p>in a very weird time.</p>
<p>I would hope that that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>And I hope that I continue to be,</p>
<p>you say important, I say funny,</p>
<p>but hopefully I continue to be a voice.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I think when I think about death,</p>
<p>I think about like, what do people come on earth to do?</p>
<p>And I think I came,</p>
<p>I think my main purpose on this planet</p>
<p>other than to experience whatever love</p>
<p>or worthiness or whatever is to entertain people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of people in comedy right now</p>
<p>that are not entertainers, and that&rsquo;s really the problem.</p>
<p>But, and they got into comedy sort of the way</p>
<p>that you can walk into the wrong store in a mall</p>
<p>and then not realize you&rsquo;re in the wrong store</p>
<p>and try on a bunch of clothes and then go,</p>
<p>fuck, I wasted my whole afternoon.</p>
<p>But I think I&rsquo;ve always kind of been an entertainer</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I wanna do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, unfortunately, sadly,</p>
<p>a lot of people that look up to you.</p>
<p>That is a horrible thing, but life is a nightmare.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you were to give them advice,</p>
<p>young folks, people in college, maybe even high school,</p>
<p>but people in their 20s about what to do with their life,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s career, whether it&rsquo;s just life in general,</p>
<p>what would you say?</p>
<p>Ignore everyone.</p>
<p>Make a few good friends.</p>
<p>Truly have honest conversations with yourself about your,</p>
<p>when do you feel the most alive?</p>
<p>Figure that out.</p>
<p>When and how do you feel the most alive?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Figure that out.</p>
<p>Try to figure out a job or a career</p>
<p>that can replicate that feeling.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to anyone.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to your parents.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to the gurus on the internet.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to anyone.</p>
<p>Figure out where you feel the most alive.</p>
<p>Where do you feel excited?</p>
<p>Where does your pulse quicken?</p>
<p>What do you feel matters?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in a situation, do you feel like it matters?</p>
<p>What situation was that?</p>
<p>What got you excited?</p>
<p>What thing did you walk into where you looked around</p>
<p>and were taken back and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>wow, this is amazing?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m filled with awe.</p>
<p>If you can figure out a life where you can excite yourself,</p>
<p>you might not use drugs or alcohol or a sex addiction</p>
<p>or gambling or irresponsibility.</p>
<p>You might not have to get your fucking kicks</p>
<p>in very destructive places</p>
<p>if you can get them in a productive place.</p>
<p>Well, you had a pretty weaving life</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s full of mistakes and so on.</p>
<p>Many mistakes.</p>
<p>Is that, are mistakes a bug or a feature?</p>
<p>Like, do you recommend embrace the mistakes,</p>
<p>make a bunch of them?</p>
<p>Depends what they are, right?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve had the full spectrum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot, but a lot of mine could have sunk me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like, they sound like fun when I talk about them,</p>
<p>but they actually could have sunk me.</p>
<p>And they were all part of what made me funny,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I would never tell anyone else</p>
<p>to just light their life on fire</p>
<p>and hope it all works out on the other end.</p>
<p>It would be pretty irresponsible.</p>
<p>But hey, at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna, we get, there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I think one of my themes is that there&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>We give the power.</p>
<p>We think we have too, the power of choice</p>
<p>has been elevated on our society to an unhealthy degree.</p>
<p>I think people are, I think you could get really good</p>
<p>at something, but you&rsquo;re born with a certain aptitude.</p>
<p>It might be to be a deal maker,</p>
<p>might be to be an athlete.</p>
<p>It might be to be an artist.</p>
<p>It might be to be a romantic,</p>
<p>just fall in and out of love, in and out of love,</p>
<p>in and out of love.</p>
<p>It might be to be like a world traveler.</p>
<p>Like, but whatever you are, I think you are.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s something about you</p>
<p>that makes you something.</p>
<p>And if you can figure it out and then refine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be good at it per se.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re an athlete,</p>
<p>it might not mean that you&rsquo;re going to be a great athlete</p>
<p>in the history, but it might mean you&rsquo;re the best coach</p>
<p>anyone&rsquo;s ever had, or you&rsquo;re the person that, you know,</p>
<p>builds a local scene for young athletes or whatever.</p>
<p>If you are a really good deal maker,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re gonna be Warren Buffett,</p>
<p>but it might mean you&rsquo;re somebody who enjoys</p>
<p>making deals all the time and things like that.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re an entertainer,</p>
<p>it might mean that you are an entertainer.</p>
<p>It might mean that you are in the world of entertainment</p>
<p>because you love it so much that if you lack the skillset</p>
<p>to really pursue it on a degree,</p>
<p>you just want to be like, there&rsquo;s a thing</p>
<p>inside of you that makes you what you are.</p>
<p>I think, I look at certain people and I go,</p>
<p>you were born to be that thing.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>The whole purpose is to find it.</p>
<p>I was a juror on that murder trial in Long Island</p>
<p>and the woman who&rsquo;s the DA, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>you were born to do this.</p>
<p>You were born to put murderers away</p>
<p>and this guy killed the mother of his children.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a bad guy, but like, I was like,</p>
<p>you are really good at what you do.</p>
<p>She has a strong belief in whatever her moral code is</p>
<p>and what her justice and ethics are.</p>
<p>And she wants to communicate that to people.</p>
<p>She was very good at doing what she did.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the facts of the case.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really listen.</p>
<p>He seemed guilty, so I just voted guilty.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t really listen to her,</p>
<p>but I heard the shape of her mouth was very bovine,</p>
<p>like a cow, and it conferred a certain level</p>
<p>of expertise that I enjoyed.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I mean, you could see, you&rsquo;re half joking.</p>
<p>Yes, but I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>You can often see that people just,</p>
<p>they found their place.</p>
<p>They found their role.</p>
<p>They found their thing.</p>
<p>They found their thing,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of the purpose of life.</p>
<p>And once you are in a place that seems sticky,</p>
<p>like the place that seems right,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the problems with the generation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re speaking to, is there&rsquo;s always a feeling</p>
<p>like I should keep exploring, keep exploring.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s okay to stay in a place that you found that works.</p>
<p>Yeah, and listen, sometimes the best place you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>is like when people are like,</p>
<p>when did you feel really excited and alive?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like doing nothing.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, like that&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some people are gonna be like,</p>
<p>I feel really excited and alive,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m laying in my backyard in a hammock.</p>
<p>And I just wanted the simplest life</p>
<p>and not have to do much, and I don&rsquo;t like doing anything.</p>
<p>And I love laying around and going,</p>
<p>wow, the sky looks good today.</p>
<p>Bill Gates goes, the sky looks good today.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s shoot a missile into it.</p>
<p>He wants to do shit, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like in between that and nothing</p>
<p>is you can find something.</p>
<p>But in that process, for you personally,</p>
<p>I mean, for me and for others, I think there&rsquo;s a struggle.</p>
<p>When you look in the,</p>
<p>when Tim and Dylan looks in the mirror,</p>
<p>do you love yourself or do you hate yourself?</p>
<p>Well, a lot of times I think I&rsquo;m Amy Schumer,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m confused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a detente to myself all the time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love myself or hate myself.</p>
<p>Addicts have a very bad problem</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t just fall in love with yourself</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t hate yourself.</p>
<p>Both of them lead you to a negative place.</p>
<p>You try to stay kind of even keel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go like, hey man, you put out a video,</p>
<p>get all these views, things are great.</p>
<p>You sold a bunch of tickets.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s fucking go out and like, maybe let&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>hey man, let&rsquo;s have that drink</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been waiting for for 11 years.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t look at myself and go,</p>
<p>you ate a burger yesterday.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a piece of shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re horrible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never get into the shape you want.</p>
<p>I try not to get too low or too high.</p>
<p>Both of them are not good for my particular mind.</p>
<p>Okay, I gotta ask, we kind of spoke about 2021</p>
<p>and you being potentially hopeful,</p>
<p>hopeful short term, cynical long term.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So let me ask, I forgot to ask, are you moving to Austin?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t think so immediately.</p>
<p>I love Joe.</p>
<p>I love what he&rsquo;s trying to do down there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m appreciative of everything that he&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>for not only me, but for comedy in general.</p>
<p>And I think as things happen in Austin</p>
<p>and unfold is such a political answer,</p>
<p>but as things unfold, I will consider it more and more.</p>
<p>But I mean, I think I got another year in LA.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve spoken so nicely about this magical place</p>
<p>that is Los Angeles.</p>
<p>LA is very funny.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s a place for comedy in LA?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>There will always be a place for comedy in LA.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna be a place for comedy in New York.</p>
<p>I mean, the question is how thriving of a comedy scene</p>
<p>is Austin gonna be?</p>
<p>And Joe can probably make it one,</p>
<p>but as of right now, it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So that would be him doing that.</p>
<p>But the question, there&rsquo;s a lot of people escaping</p>
<p>Los Angeles, but I know better about New York.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of really brilliant people.</p>
<p>Let them go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other people.</p>
<p>This is the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is the fear thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, but all the brilliant people are leaving.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be other people and they&rsquo;ll fill their shoes</p>
<p>the way that they&rsquo;ve done throughout history.</p>
<p>And I think that New York and LA,</p>
<p>listen, maybe in five to 10 years,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not the two cities.</p>
<p>It would be real rough in five years</p>
<p>when this pandemic&rsquo;s over for people in Australia to go,</p>
<p>dude, you gotta go to America</p>
<p>and you gotta visit Charleston and Austin.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be adults here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be adults.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still gonna be New York and LA for a while.</p>
<p>LA is an absolute hellscape,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re gonna replace California</p>
<p>with another place.</p>
<p>And also, everyone&rsquo;s making decisions now</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re literally in the midst of a pandemic</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve never had before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never had this before.</p>
<p>Joe loved California up until the pandemic.</p>
<p>He had problems with it.</p>
<p>Like, we all have problems with it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of benefits to being here.</p>
<p>I think a lot of us made pretty bad decisions in 2020</p>
<p>because we were all locked up</p>
<p>and stuck with our own thoughts.</p>
<p>But, so it&rsquo;s funny, there&rsquo;s parallels</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t necessarily,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m obviously a fan of comedy,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t care where comics move.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a parallel move that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>set of decisions which do influence my decision making,</p>
<p>which is where to start a business that&rsquo;s tech centered.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s more about the San Francisco, Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>And there is a lot of people leaving there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s already.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to Austin.</p>
<p>Well, Austin, there&rsquo;s a, I think,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of different places.</p>
<p>Phoenix, there&rsquo;s Denver.</p>
<p>Austin will probably be a massive tech hub.</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s all, everything about Austin says</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to be a massive tech hub.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know if that means</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be a massive comedy hub.</p>
<p>It might.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if those two can actually coexist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t, I think, you know,</p>
<p>comedy suffered in New York and LA</p>
<p>when everyone got super rich.</p>
<p>Like, you know, it just wasn&rsquo;t as cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still much more fun on the road.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still more fun to perform for people</p>
<p>that want and need to laugh in strip malls</p>
<p>than it is to perform for hedge fund managers</p>
<p>and with their dates and, you know, Instagram models in LA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just what it is.</p>
<p>Comedy on the road is much more fun.</p>
<p>So maybe in the spirit of that, Austin becomes,</p>
<p>but you know, you know, if Austin is just colonized</p>
<p>by tech bros and stuff like, yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>sure, sure it&rsquo;ll be fun and it&rsquo;ll be great.</p>
<p>I think Joe&rsquo;s made LA a scene.</p>
<p>So if anyone&rsquo;s going to make Austin a scene, it&rsquo;s Joe.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I like the, on the Elon side,</p>
<p>which is what I&rsquo;m much more familiar with,</p>
<p>the promise of the possibility of what that could become</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of problems in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>And of course it might be naive to think that</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s like the grass is greener thing,</p>
<p>which is just because the place where you come from</p>
<p>has a lot of problems,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you can just create a new place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to have those problems.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s homelessness in Austin.</p>
<p>There are problems in Austin.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that with, by the way,</p>
<p>with the influx of very rich people to an area,</p>
<p>sometimes that helps things,</p>
<p>but sometimes it just makes things more polarizing</p>
<p>and it puts a spotlight on those problems</p>
<p>and makes those problems even bigger, right?</p>
<p>So, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s necessarily,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to predict.</p>
<p>I just know that LA right now is funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that there&rsquo;s 15 year old TikTokers</p>
<p>making millions of dollars dancing in a house</p>
<p>while the world burns.</p>
<p>That is very funny.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s for your style of humor, yes.</p>
<p>The absurdity of the world is that it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>No one cares about Hollywood starlets</p>
<p>and actresses and actors and everyone goes,</p>
<p>hey, fuck you.</p>
<p>Even though they&rsquo;ve won three Academy Awards,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all being replaced</p>
<p>by just mediocre dancer 15 year olds.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s something hilarious</p>
<p>about this city and it will burn in hell,</p>
<p>but so will everything.</p>
<p>So what are we talking about?</p>
<p>Eventually the sun will die out</p>
<p>and we will all be gone unless we colonize</p>
<p>outside of our solar system.</p>
<p>But I just sit here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struggling with this</p>
<p>because Boston, I&rsquo;m currently at MIT,</p>
<p>Boston doesn&rsquo;t feel like the right place</p>
<p>to start a business in the tech sector.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m choosing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at San Francisco the way it is</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m looking at Austin.</p>
<p>Oh, Austin, clearly.</p>
<p>So it seems clear, but it&rsquo;s such a difficult thing</p>
<p>to predict what a place will look like in 10 years</p>
<p>and 15 years and 20 years.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so hard to predict if you&rsquo;ll like it or not</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>And this is speaking to risk,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not really a good reason for me to move anywhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a good reason to do anything in life.</p>
<p>Part of me wants to just fucking do it</p>
<p>and whatever and see what happens.</p>
<p>Do you like Boston, do you like other things about Boston</p>
<p>besides the tech thing?</p>
<p>You like MIT.</p>
<p>MIT, that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Do you like the food in Boston?</p>
<p>Do you eat food?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t eaten food or been outside for years.</p>
<p>And I mean, that&rsquo;s probably the better version.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re keto forever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been keto for a long time.</p>
<p>Yeah, keto, fasting for a long time.</p>
<p>15 years fasting, eating once or twice a day.</p>
<p>But no sugar ever, no like and no pasta ever, no bread ever.</p>
<p>No pasta, no bread, no, except like, so my source of&hellip;</p>
<p>You could kind of live anywhere</p>
<p>because like going out is such a big part</p>
<p>of what city you live in.</p>
<p>And like, do you like the food there?</p>
<p>Do you like the restaurants?</p>
<p>Can you meet people?</p>
<p>Whatever, but it&rsquo;s like, you really can just kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, so not married, no kids.</p>
<p>Right, you have freedom.</p>
<p>Me too, I have freedom.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, we have the curse of being vegan.</p>
<p>We have too many choices.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>We have too many choices.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have somebody else going, what about like,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to justify our decisions to anyone.</p>
<p>So we can just kind of like let our minds go run wild.</p>
<p>So you just got to hone the instinct</p>
<p>of just what feels right and just fucking do it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I think Austin with Joe down there and Elon down there,</p>
<p>Austin seems like a real no brainer move for you.</p>
<p>To try, you know, why the hell not?</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>And then I think I should go to MIT.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, I think I should give those nerds</p>
<p>a piece of my mind that you should go to.</p>
<p>I was in an Uber pool once with a kid from MIT</p>
<p>and I was eating this thing from Bova&rsquo;s Bakery.</p>
<p>I forget what it was.</p>
<p>It was like a, it&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know Bova&rsquo;s Bakery, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s in Boston, it&rsquo;s famous.</p>
<p>I was eating a thing and I was like covered in chocolate.</p>
<p>This kid, like this little nerd, like this little like,</p>
<p>you know, USB drive with feet was just staring at me</p>
<p>and they just dropped him off at MIT.</p>
<p>And he like scurried away.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a big school that,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t the NSA recruit out of their heavy,</p>
<p>like MIT, places like that?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t speak to that.</p>
<p>But what, this is a ridiculous question</p>
<p>I sometimes ask myself when I&rsquo;m alone.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Do you think about the big existential kind of,</p>
<p>why the hell we&rsquo;re here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cosmic kind of joke kind of in a weird way, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Joe said it the other day on,</p>
<p>maybe it was you saying that like,</p>
<p>he was just like, you know,</p>
<p>by the time you figure out what it is, you&rsquo;re out of here.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Or you even start to figure out what it is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re out of here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s kind of funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t get enough time to truly,</p>
<p>I think the meaning of life is just like,</p>
<p>at the end of the day, do you feel it was time well spent?</p>
<p>Was it time well spent?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what it is.</p>
<p>If you look back, do you go,</p>
<p>hey, it was time well spent.</p>
<p>Pretty good ride.</p>
<p>It was a pretty good ride.</p>
<p>I did a lot of things.</p>
<p>Doing what you say is a part of it, I think.</p>
<p>If you say you&rsquo;re going to do something, maybe doing it.</p>
<p>That seems to be extrapolating the meaning of life question</p>
<p>to like, you know, what did you come here to do?</p>
<p>I think it goes down deep of like, who are you</p>
<p>and what do you want and you know,</p>
<p>what are you suited to do and what?</p>
<p>It does seem that like, the people who are most enlightened</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever met or read books by,</p>
<p>they ultimately land on humor.</p>
<p>Like, they don&rsquo;t take shit seriously.</p>
<p>They embrace the absurdity of it all</p>
<p>and just kind of laugh at it in this kind of simple way.</p>
<p>So it does seem that humor is like,</p>
<p>one of the fundamental truths of this universe we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And somehow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s love, it&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Humor can be love, right?</p>
<p>People laughing, that that sound is kind of like,</p>
<p>Carolyn Knapp, who wrote a book called,</p>
<p>Drinking a Love Story, which is a really good book</p>
<p>about not drinking.</p>
<p>Drinking and then not drinking.</p>
<p>And she said, you could understand things as love.</p>
<p>I think one of the last lines of the thing is like,</p>
<p>people talking about their experiences in life,</p>
<p>that could be love.</p>
<p>Like, you know, laughter is love.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like love and finding it</p>
<p>wherever you could find it is why we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that connection.</p>
<p>And laughter can be love.</p>
<p>And, you know, figuring out, you know,</p>
<p>something that makes life better</p>
<p>for a lot of people can be love.</p>
<p>You know, whether it&rsquo;s a vaccine</p>
<p>or a technological advancement or whatever.</p>
<p>Like, you know, all of those things,</p>
<p>I think, can be that feeling.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>It connects you to a larger frequency, you know?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it, Tim.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re one of the voices.</p>
<p>I truly believe that your legacy</p>
<p>would be one of the most important voices of our time,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re fearless and challenging all the absurdity</p>
<p>of the nonsense of our social and political discourse.</p>
<p>So I hope you keep doing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit starstruck, so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stop it.</p>
<p>Listen, I was your intellectual capacity.</p>
<p>Enjoying anything I do only underscores</p>
<p>how truly fucked we are.</p>
<p>But thank you very much.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you for talking today.</p>
