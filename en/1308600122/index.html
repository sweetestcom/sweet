    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,</p>
<p>where I and an expert guest discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode marks the fourth in the six episode series</p>
<p>on fitness, exercise, and performance.</p>
<p>And today&rsquo;s episode is all about optimal fitness programming.</p>
<p>That is how to design a fitness and exercise program</p>
<p>that can achieve the goals that you want</p>
<p>for fitness and for sports performance.</p>
<p>Dr. Andy Galpin, great to be back.</p>
<p>In previous episodes,</p>
<p>you taught us about the various adaptations</p>
<p>that occur at the level of cells, at the level of organs,</p>
<p>indeed at the level of the entire body</p>
<p>that underlie things like improvements in strength</p>
<p>and speed, hypertrophy, aka muscle growth,</p>
<p>and the various forms of endurance.</p>
<p>And you laid out beautifully the various protocols</p>
<p>that one can do in order to achieve</p>
<p>each and every one of those adaptations.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;d love for you to teach us</p>
<p>how we can combine different protocols</p>
<p>to achieve multiple adaptations in parallel.</p>
<p>For instance, how to improve endurance and strength,</p>
<p>how to achieve some level of hypertrophy,</p>
<p>perhaps directed hypertrophy at specific muscle groups,</p>
<p>while also maintaining endurance</p>
<p>and perhaps improving speed, for instance.</p>
<p>And if you would, I&rsquo;d love for you to tell us</p>
<p>how we can combine different protocols</p>
<p>and vary those across the week, across the month,</p>
<p>across the year, so that we can make regular progress.</p>
<p>And perhaps even you could give us a window</p>
<p>into the ways to make the fastest progress possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would love to do that.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve invested a lot of time</p>
<p>in the previous episodes covering background and concepts</p>
<p>and detail about the physiology</p>
<p>so you understood why you&rsquo;re making the choices you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>and why other choices are less effective.</p>
<p>In this discussion, I would actually like to jump</p>
<p>maybe more directly to the answer</p>
<p>and kind of get right into the protocol.</p>
<p>So maybe a little bit less background.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in that stuff,</p>
<p>I suppose you&rsquo;d have to go backwards a little bit</p>
<p>and watch some of those previous episodes.</p>
<p>But I would love to jump into just some samples,</p>
<p>some case studies, if you will,</p>
<p>and kind of walk through different protocols.</p>
<p>I know that over the course of my 11 years</p>
<p>as a college professor</p>
<p>and being in the public space a little bit,</p>
<p>probably the most numerous style of question I have gotten</p>
<p>is exactly that.</p>
<p>So I know the rep range for this,</p>
<p>or I know the style of training for that adaptation,</p>
<p>but how do I put them together?</p>
<p>And I would just like to spend our time today</p>
<p>going through those things.</p>
<p>And the reason I want to do it is this.</p>
<p>Some people listening at home surely just love exercise.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already bought in</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to train no matter what.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re interested in just actually being more effective.</p>
<p>And so the way that you structure</p>
<p>and put your plan together will in large part</p>
<p>determine getting more progress for less effort,</p>
<p>or actually being able to put the same amount of effort in</p>
<p>and getting results faster.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also some folks probably listening who are like,</p>
<p>okay, I exercise, I do what I can.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bought into the benefits.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked so elaborately</p>
<p>over the 100 plus episodes you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>about the various benefits of exercise.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re kind of doing it</p>
<p>because you know it&rsquo;s important, but you&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>So for those folks, it&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>okay, how can we actually make this thing more effective?</p>
<p>So we can make sure you hit the things</p>
<p>you absolutely have to get</p>
<p>for the short and long-term benefits, right?</p>
<p>To make sure that you&rsquo;re looking the way you want to look,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re performing physically the way you want to perform,</p>
<p>and then you can do that across your lifespan.</p>
<p>So how can we give you all some structure</p>
<p>to where, again, you don&rsquo;t have to turn</p>
<p>into an absolute lover of physical fitness</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have to take over your life,</p>
<p>but you can still get more results</p>
<p>for your same time restrictions,</p>
<p>whether that be you have two days a week</p>
<p>or five days a week,</p>
<p>or only certain access to equipment or experience,</p>
<p>whatever the case may be,</p>
<p>how can we help those folks as well</p>
<p>put together a protocol that will get them closer</p>
<p>to their goals with less restrictions?</p>
<p>Fantastic, and I&rsquo;m hoping that along the way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll also point us to how often</p>
<p>to take the fitness assessment</p>
<p>for each of the adaptations that you referred to</p>
<p>in a previous episode.</p>
<p>We will also link to that fitness assessment segment</p>
<p>in the show note captions for this episode,</p>
<p>because that fitness assessment for different adaptations,</p>
<p>I think, is a really powerful way for people to touch in</p>
<p>and see how much long endurance do they have?</p>
<p>How much anaerobic capacity do they have?</p>
<p>How much strength do they really have?</p>
<p>And then perhaps you&rsquo;d also be willing to throw in</p>
<p>a couple of additional ways that we can assess</p>
<p>our level of fitness and progress</p>
<p>in this arc of a fitness program across the year.</p>
<p>Amazing, I can&rsquo;t wait to do that.</p>
<p>I think it is also important before we jump in</p>
<p>to acknowledge a lot of folks may be thinking to themselves,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really necessarily need a plan.</p>
<p>Why do I have to do that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a certain goal I&rsquo;m going after.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not running a race anytime soon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a competitive athlete.</p>
<p>I just, I go to the gym and I work out, and that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Well, I would like to try to convince you that</p>
<p>regardless of where you&rsquo;re at,</p>
<p>having a plan will achieve those things</p>
<p>we just talked about,</p>
<p>which is more success in a shorter timeframe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a significant amount of research</p>
<p>to support this.</p>
<p>Those individuals who go on a specific training plan</p>
<p>compared to those who do not,</p>
<p>will receive better results, right?</p>
<p>Independent of the effectiveness of the program, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked in previous episodes</p>
<p>about tons of different styles and strategies.</p>
<p>And to reiterate,</p>
<p>it really doesn&rsquo;t matter which one you pick.</p>
<p>The fact that you have a plan</p>
<p>is always more effective than not having a plan.</p>
<p>And so again,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not planning on competing with something,</p>
<p>if you wanna shorten the amount of time you&rsquo;re in the gym,</p>
<p>get more results from it,</p>
<p>I would strongly encourage to put something together.</p>
<p>The two largest reasons why people don&rsquo;t get results</p>
<p>with their fitness training protocol</p>
<p>is number one, adherence,</p>
<p>and then number two, some sort of progressive overload.</p>
<p>Both of those two things are challenging to accomplish</p>
<p>without a plan, right?</p>
<p>So the reason people don&rsquo;t go to the gym, one of them,</p>
<p>and one of the reasons why it takes them so long</p>
<p>is because they don&rsquo;t walk in with a very specific plan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like going to the grocery store</p>
<p>and figuring out what you&rsquo;re going to buy</p>
<p>versus knowing exactly</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re gonna get in your shopping list,</p>
<p>grabbing those things and getting out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice your time in the grocery store</p>
<p>is half the length.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more productive</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t waste money on extra things, okay?</p>
<p>So that alone will drive adherence</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not going to think to yourself,</p>
<p>oh, that 90-minute workout I do is actually really just 60.</p>
<p>And so now the next time you go to train,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, man, I don&rsquo;t have 90 minutes.</p>
<p>You realize it&rsquo;s only 60 or 40 or 30 or 20,</p>
<p>whatever it needs to be.</p>
<p>So that alone will get you there.</p>
<p>The second part of that, which is overload,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to understand and remember,</p>
<p>well, the last time I did lat raises,</p>
<p>I used, I think, five pounds</p>
<p>and then I think I did like 12.</p>
<p>Well, if you don&rsquo;t have some sort of system of tracking,</p>
<p>and this can be as simple as a notebook,</p>
<p>just writing down what you did before</p>
<p>and doing a little bit more the next time,</p>
<p>that is going to almost guarantee you success.</p>
<p>So having some structure,</p>
<p>and this structure can be fairly loose,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna talk about a bunch of different examples,</p>
<p>is something I strongly encourage everyone</p>
<p>to utilize for their exercise.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is also separate from Dr. Andy Galpin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of our desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Momentus.</p>
<p>Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to be partnering</p>
<p>with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>their supplements are of extremely high quality.</p>
<p>Second of all, their supplements are generally</p>
<p>in single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to develop a supplementation protocol,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to focus mainly</p>
<p>on using single ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>With single ingredient formulations,</p>
<p>you can devise the most logical and effective</p>
<p>and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals.</p>
<p>In addition, Momentus supplements ship internationally,</p>
<p>and this is, of course, important because we realize</p>
<p>that many of the Huberman Lab podcast listeners</p>
<p>reside outside the United States.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try the various supplements mentioned</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast, in particular supplements</p>
<p>for hormone health, for sleep optimization, for focus,</p>
<p>as well as a number of other things,</p>
<p>including exercise recovery,</p>
<p>you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by 8Sleep.</p>
<p>8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating,</p>
<p>and sleep tracking capacity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using an 8Sleep mattress cover</p>
<p>for about the last eight months,</p>
<p>and it has completely transformed my sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sleeping about the same amount,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sleeping far deeper,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m now getting the proper ratios</p>
<p>of so-called rapid eye movement, or REM sleep,</p>
<p>and slow-wave sleep, and waking up feeling</p>
<p>far more recovered mentally and physically.</p>
<p>The underlying mechanism for all that</p>
<p>is very straightforward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere</p>
<p>about the critical relationship</p>
<p>between sleep and body temperature.</p>
<p>That is, in order to fall asleep at night,</p>
<p>your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees</p>
<p>in terms of core body temperature,</p>
<p>and waking up involves a one to three degree increase</p>
<p>in core body temperature.</p>
<p>With 8Sleep mattress covers,</p>
<p>you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment</p>
<p>to be one temperature at the start of the night,</p>
<p>a different temperature the middle of the night,</p>
<p>and a different temperature as you approach morning,</p>
<p>each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep</p>
<p>and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever.</p>

<p>So what sorts of things should people be thinking about</p>
<p>when developing an overall fitness program?</p>
<p>A few minutes ago, we were talking about</p>
<p>how two of the major reasons people don&rsquo;t get as much</p>
<p>out of their training programs as they would like</p>
<p>is because of, one, a lack of adherence,</p>
<p>and two, a lack of progressive overload.</p>
<p>So the solution to that is constructing a plan</p>
<p>that lives within your realistic limitations.</p>
<p>So I would like to walk you through my 10-step approach</p>
<p>to how I design training programs.</p>
<p>Now, before I do that, I think it is fair and important</p>
<p>for the audience to understand</p>
<p>that this is simply my approach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this a long time.</p>
<p>I played college football</p>
<p>and I wrote my own training programs back then.</p>
<p>I have and am still working with professional athletes</p>
<p>and PGA Tour and the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball,</p>
<p>as well as a ton of general population folks.</p>
<p>So this is a combination of the evidence-based</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about in terms of best practices</p>
<p>for strength and conditioning,</p>
<p>as well as just my years of experience.</p>
<p>So there are many, many ways one could do this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even suggesting this is the best.</p>
<p>This is simply how I do it.</p>
<p>This is exactly how I handle it</p>
<p>when a new individual comes to me</p>
<p>and how I teach my students.</p>
<p>So step number one is assessing properly</p>
<p>and identifying a training goal.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s actually sort of funny</p>
<p>because we hear that a lot,</p>
<p>but a lot of people actually never take that step.</p>
<p>Not to call anybody in the room out.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening here is this morning, Andy, Dr. Galpin,</p>
<p>and I were training together</p>
<p>and he was providing amazing tips on form</p>
<p>and set rep cadence and this sort of thing.</p>
<p>And he said, so what&rsquo;s your training goal</p>
<p>for the next 12 months?</p>
<p>And I paused and it turned into a very long pause.</p>
<p>Because-</p>
<p>Which is an easy, nice way of saying</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have an answer.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have an answer.</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t just want to maintain</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve developed in terms of strength</p>
<p>and hypertrophy and endurance,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have a clear goal.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m hoping that by the end of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>I will be on track to a clear set of goals to train for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna bore you all here,</p>
<p>but really I can&rsquo;t stress enough</p>
<p>how important that step really,</p>
<p>truly is to getting results.</p>
<p>The analogy we use here is,</p>
<p>if you left your house and you were attempting</p>
<p>to get to the grocery store and you just started driving,</p>
<p>and if you drove every possible route,</p>
<p>you would eventually get to a grocery store.</p>
<p>And so, yes, that can work.</p>
<p>A better approach is saying, here&rsquo;s where I am,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s where I want to go,</p>
<p>what is the optimal route there?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really what you&rsquo;re doing with goals.</p>
<p>So it is a boring step, it is not interesting to hear,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any real hacks or tricks for you,</p>
<p>but it is step number one on purpose.</p>
<p>We have to know exactly where we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>You can do this in two ways.</p>
<p>Way number one is to just pick something,</p>
<p>arbitrarily decide, I&rsquo;m gonna run a 5K,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve done that before</p>
<p>and I want to improve it by 10 seconds.</p>
<p>I want to lose 10 pounds.</p>
<p>You can just pick one, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Another way is to run through that fitness testing protocol</p>
<p>that we described a few episodes before.</p>
<p>And if you do that, you can see which of these areas</p>
<p>that maybe you have the largest lagging in,</p>
<p>or what is the most severe performance anchor</p>
<p>is how we refer to it.</p>
<p>And then choose that as your primary goal.</p>
<p>So either option, some people come into training programs</p>
<p>with a very clear goal in mind,</p>
<p>they want to add more muscle or whatever, whatever.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t really know,</p>
<p>I just kind of work out,</p>
<p>then run the fitness testing protocol.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see what score is the lowest in,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll maybe make that a priority</p>
<p>for the next, say, three months.</p>
<p>So the first step is to identify a specific</p>
<p>or set of specific training goals.</p>
<p>A really nice tool for helping you set a goal</p>
<p>is a system called SMART, right?</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a little bit of debate</p>
<p>on what those acronyms actually stand for,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll get close enough, right?</p>
<p>So SMART is often specific, measurable,</p>
<p>attainable, realistic, and timely.</p>
<p>So starting off with S, specific.</p>
<p>In general, the more specific your goal is,</p>
<p>the higher likelihood you will have at succeeding in that.</p>
<p>M, being measurable, means it needs to be something</p>
<p>that you can actually put a metric on.</p>
<p>So this can be objective or subjective,</p>
<p>but generally I like to have at least one objective measure.</p>
<p>So remembering objective is something</p>
<p>that is not based on feeling.</p>
<p>This could be something simple like your body weight.</p>
<p>It could be how much you can bench press,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your one-mile time,</p>
<p>and whatever is most important to you.</p>
<p>It actually doesn&rsquo;t have to be a fitness-related goal.</p>
<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re using fitness</p>
<p>as a way to enhance your sleep,</p>
<p>the main metric you may be interested in</p>
<p>is the amount of hours slept.</p>
<p>It could be something like efficiency</p>
<p>or whatever is most interesting.</p>
<p>It could be work productivity.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t have to actually be the fitness goal,</p>
<p>but what is the motivation of why you&rsquo;re doing it?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s specific, measurable.</p>
<p>Attainable or actionable, as is often described,</p>
<p>is something that is within your capability.</p>
<p>So attainable, a bad example of attainable</p>
<p>is something like, my goal is to win more games.</p>
<p>That may not be up to you.</p>
<p>The other team you&rsquo;re playing, it could influence it,</p>
<p>the schedule, et cetera.</p>
<p>So attainable should be something</p>
<p>that is within your control.</p>
<p>Realistic or relevant to you</p>
<p>is something that is, again,</p>
<p>something realistic that you can achieve.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t wanna make a goal that is,</p>
<p>you wanna double your body mass.</p>
<p>This is not gonna happen.</p>
<p>So think about the constraints.</p>
<p>How old are you?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your training experience?</p>
<p>How much time do you really have to invest in this?</p>
<p>And then pick something that is realistic,</p>
<p>and then honestly, my little twist here</p>
<p>is take that and minus 10%.</p>
<p>Because typically, when people put together</p>
<p>training programs, their goal tends to be quite lofty,</p>
<p>and they get some small percentage of the way in,</p>
<p>realize they&rsquo;re never going to get there,</p>
<p>and then back off.</p>
<p>We actually, this sort of reminds me</p>
<p>of a classic deception study that we did</p>
<p>in my lab one time, where we took people,</p>
<p>and we had them do this maximal front raise,</p>
<p>basically, so you held a dumbbell out in front of you</p>
<p>for as long as you possibly could.</p>
<p>And the goal here was actually, it&rsquo;s a deception study,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re tricking them.</p>
<p>And so we said, okay, we wanna just get normative values</p>
<p>to see how long people can hold this front raise,</p>
<p>and I think we used something like 5% of their body weight.</p>
<p>And so they came in and they did it one time,</p>
<p>and we timed them.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t get to see the clock, they left.</p>
<p>And then we said, we gotta come back in, repeat it, right?</p>
<p>We gotta do a couple of tries here</p>
<p>to get a normal value in case it&rsquo;s off or whatever.</p>
<p>Well, the participants were split up into four groups.</p>
<p>So group one actually was told that their time</p>
<p>was 15% lower than that they actually got.</p>
<p>Group two was 5% lower, group three was 5% higher,</p>
<p>and group four was 15% higher.</p>
<p>So the second time they came in to do it,</p>
<p>our graduate student, quote unquote, made a mistake</p>
<p>and left the timer in front of them.</p>
<p>So the first time, again, they did the exercise,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just holding it, they don&rsquo;t have any idea</p>
<p>how long they&rsquo;re holding it.</p>
<p>The second time, they had a giant iPad set</p>
<p>like just a little bit off-centered,</p>
<p>or they can clearly see it,</p>
<p>so they watched the time go by.</p>
<p>And of course, what happened was,</p>
<p>those folks say who did one minute,</p>
<p>the very first time when they tested,</p>
<p>they came back in to do the second time,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re holding it, and we told them</p>
<p>they actually got 45 seconds.</p>
<p>When in reality, they had done a minute.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re holding it and holding it,</p>
<p>and they think they only did 45 seconds.</p>
<p>By the time they get to like second 40, 41, 42,</p>
<p>they get past 45, they almost all quit,</p>
<p>like 47, 48 seconds.</p>
<p>Because they wanted to beat their previous score,</p>
<p>but then were like, cool, I beat it,</p>
<p>and then they quit early.</p>
<p>So they were actually not yet to failure,</p>
<p>but they were just happy enough</p>
<p>to beat what they thought they&rsquo;d done, and then they quit.</p>
<p>The other group on the inverse side,</p>
<p>again, say they got a minute,</p>
<p>we told them they got a minute and 15 seconds.</p>
<p>They got to like 45 seconds, 50 seconds,</p>
<p>and started realizing, oh man, I have 30 more seconds to go,</p>
<p>and they quit way early.</p>
<p>Because the carrot was way too far out.</p>
<p>They realized, I&rsquo;m never gonna get there,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just gonna stop now.</p>
<p>Can you guess which group did the best on the post-test?</p>
<p>Ones that were just within about 5% of.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So they wanted to improve,</p>
<p>and so again, say they got a minute the first time.</p>
<p>We told them they got a minute five,</p>
<p>or sorry, they got a minute five the first time.</p>
<p>We told them they only got a minute.</p>
<p>They actually exceeded that greatly</p>
<p>because they wanted the PR.</p>
<p>So making sure that that goal is properly aligned,</p>
<p>it needs to be a little bit scary,</p>
<p>a little bit unrealistic.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re gonna have to work for this.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s too easy, you&rsquo;ll quit.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t feel like a challenge.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s too hard though, you&rsquo;ll quit early as well.</p>
<p>So you want to make sure it&rsquo;s that reasonable balance</p>
<p>of like, ah, should I train today?</p>
<p>Or like, maybe I&rsquo;ll just go through.</p>
<p>If I do that, I&rsquo;m not gonna hit.</p>
<p>I gotta get after it.</p>
<p>But not like, oh my God, like, there&rsquo;s just no chance here.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna walk away early.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fantastic study, I have to say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>I think it illustrates a number</p>
<p>of important psychological principles</p>
<p>about goal-setting, motivation, self-perception,</p>
<p>but also the dopamine system.</p>
<p>You know, the dopamine system</p>
<p>is this universal reward system</p>
<p>that meaning it doesn&rsquo;t only work for food</p>
<p>or only work for fitness goals</p>
<p>or only work for academic goals or relationship goals.</p>
<p>It is the universal substrate for all of that.</p>
<p>And I actually think there&rsquo;s some real gems of information</p>
<p>in the study design that you described.</p>
<p>So just cue that for maybe a potential collaboration</p>
<p>between our laboratories,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s very important,</p>
<p>but it does cue up another question</p>
<p>relevant to fitness in particular,</p>
<p>which is what are your thoughts on intermediate goals?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say my goal is to drop two percentages,</p>
<p>2% of body fat from where I am now a year from now.</p>
<p>So roll into the next year from now</p>
<p>about 2% lower on body fat,</p>
<p>but maintain my lean body mass,</p>
<p>or maybe even increase it.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>How should I assess progress?</p>
<p>You know, because the dopamine system loves a goal,</p>
<p>that it loves anticipation of a goal,</p>
<p>but it responds best to we sort of re-up,</p>
<p>if you will, our dopamine anytime we get a signal</p>
<p>that we are on the right track to that goal.</p>
<p>And that signal could be, okay, I did the workout.</p>
<p>I just trust that these workouts</p>
<p>are going to give me the result I want.</p>
<p>But of course, we know that when people get a glimmer</p>
<p>of the idea or some objective feedback</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re on the right path,</p>
<p>that dopamine system really fires and provides motivation</p>
<p>for continuing toward the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>in the strength, speed, and hypertrophy episode,</p>
<p>resistance training itself has this built into it</p>
<p>because of the infusion of blood into the muscles.</p>
<p>You actually get a little window</p>
<p>into what you might get in terms of an adaptation</p>
<p>simply by way of the so-called pump.</p>
<p>Whereas endurance type work generally doesn&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see yourself get better, drop back,</p>
<p>and then adapt and actually get better.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s actually what you see with weight training.</p>
<p>So given all of that contour of the dopamine system,</p>
<p>what sorts of intermediate goals should I set for myself</p>
<p>or should somebody set for themselves?</p>
<p>And I realize it will probably depend on the ultimate goal,</p>
<p>but would you say check in on progress once every week,</p>
<p>every month, three months?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can tell the look on my face.</p>
<p>I love this question and this topic.</p>
<p>I spend so much time on it</p>
<p>on my senior graduate level program design course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to work with a few athletes</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve had multiple years.</p>
<p>And if you can really take the time to step back and go,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about optimizing for the next six weeks.</p>
<p>And in this case, it&rsquo;s not the next fight.</p>
<p>It is the championship fight</p>
<p>that we need to get to in three years.</p>
<p>Or it is the Olympics, which are on a quad program.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really optimizing for that four year.</p>
<p>If you can have that foresight and really think about that</p>
<p>and then work backwards,</p>
<p>you can see some pretty tremendous things.</p>
<p>The sort of saying that is like we tend to overestimate</p>
<p>what we can get done in a week</p>
<p>and underestimate what can happen in a year.</p>
<p>That can be extraordinarily powerful.</p>
<p>However, you have to have those metrics</p>
<p>called out ahead of time</p>
<p>because you will lose motivation in that short term</p>
<p>because you won&rsquo;t see that result immediately.</p>
<p>But if you remember, I&rsquo;m on a path to 4% or 2%</p>
<p>or whatever you need to be.</p>
<p>Therefore, I only need to be this far right now.</p>
<p>I need to be that far and then that far.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite clear.</p>
<p>And so what we would actually do in that scenario,</p>
<p>not to go like so off track here,</p>
<p>because I can really go on this stuff,</p>
<p>is let&rsquo;s say it was the year recommendation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna actually need to go to the last part of SMART,</p>
<p>which is timely.</p>
<p>So part of setting this goal</p>
<p>is making sure you understand the time domain responsible.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually quite great here</p>
<p>because not to go inception on us</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re like list within a list</p>
<p>and Rob kills us over here.</p>
<p>But number one of this program design thing</p>
<p>was assessing your goal.</p>
<p>Number two is identifying your defender.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is what is stopping you</p>
<p>from hitting that goal?</p>
<p>So you wanna lose 2% body fat in the next year.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna stop us?</p>
<p>Once we can achieve that,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll go into more of that in a second,</p>
<p>then you just start walking that 2% backwards.</p>
<p>So you might have to go something like this.</p>
<p>Look, every time I start working out</p>
<p>really hard, I always get hurt.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So maybe instead of jumping really hard</p>
<p>into a high-intensity interval training program,</p>
<p>knowing we&rsquo;re likely to hurt something</p>
<p>or get burnt out or quit</p>
<p>or whatever the defender is for you,</p>
<p>maybe we invest something right now,</p>
<p>which is maybe improving your flexibility</p>
<p>or working on movement technique,</p>
<p>whatever&rsquo;s gonna stop you from getting hurt.</p>
<p>Or maybe we progress slower so we don&rsquo;t get there.</p>
<p>That will allow us to do the work necessary</p>
<p>to hit that goal 12 months from now,</p>
<p>not two weeks from now, not two months from now.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re like, no, look, hey, I move well.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m in decent shape.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got enough muscle mass on me.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked in previous episodes</p>
<p>why having insufficient muscle mass</p>
<p>is sometimes detrimental for fat loss.</p>
<p>So you checked all that boxes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get hurt very often, right?</p>
<p>I got equipment around, no problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the time in my schedule</p>
<p>and I have enough muscle, great.</p>
<p>Well, now we maybe just split it up and say,</p>
<p>look, we got 12 months, we got 2%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as simple as doing a half a percent</p>
<p>per quarter of the year.</p>
<p>And now all we&rsquo;re looking at is that number, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to necessarily get all these things done.</p>
<p>I can go quarter, half percent,</p>
<p>half percent, half percent, half percent.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get there, right?</p>
<p>The other scenario that I laid out a second ago,</p>
<p>it maybe needs to look like something like this.</p>
<p>Quarter one is gonna be 0%.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You may not lose a pound for the next three months.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the goal of these three months.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s the goal this year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our major macro cycle goal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get there,</p>
<p>but to get there most effectively,</p>
<p>we need to invest in, you know,</p>
<p>working more with your chiropractor</p>
<p>or whatever the thing is, right?</p>
<p>That will allow us to then go half a percent quarter two</p>
<p>when we can really start training,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna ramp into it.</p>
<p>Quarter three, we&rsquo;re gonna go another half a percent.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re halfway there.</p>
<p>Quarter four, we&rsquo;ve invested so much.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ready to go.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna go hard.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get that last 1%, that last quarter,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna get there and you won&rsquo;t be hurt.</p>
<p>So that makes it very clear.</p>
<p>And I can also envision how the precise structure</p>
<p>of these intermediate goals would vary</p>
<p>depending on what sort of adaptation one is pursuing.</p>
<p>And I do remember from our previous episodes</p>
<p>that fat loss itself is not an adaptation.</p>
<p>It is a by-product of other adaptations.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure that you know</p>
<p>that I was paying attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s committed to memory.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Some goals such as fat loss are very quantifiable</p>
<p>and yet they might not be linear, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know, you know,</p>
<p>the assumption is if you ingest, you know,</p>
<p>X fewer calories than are required per day,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll lose X amount of weight,</p>
<p>some percentage from body fat.</p>
<p>I think that cues up the idea</p>
<p>that we need to build some flexibility</p>
<p>into our thinking about these intermediate goals</p>
<p>in order to just make sure that dopamine system</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t tethered to exact numbers, you know,</p>
<p>because after all a reduction in 2% body fat,</p>
<p>for instance, is really a desire to achieve</p>
<p>a different sort of overall body composition</p>
<p>or recomposition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, by the way, that that&rsquo;s my exact goal.</p>
<p>I think one of my goals is to be able to run a mile faster.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sort of haunted by this experience</p>
<p>of wanting to run a cross country in college</p>
<p>and trying to walk on.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t a division one school,</p>
<p>but the threshold for being considered for the team</p>
<p>was you had to run a sub 10 minute, two mile,</p>
<p>which turns out to be very, very fast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, I did not do that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even come close,</p>
<p>but, and I don&rsquo;t think that I could reasonably do that now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in committing</p>
<p>to the kind of training required.</p>
<p>The sacrifice isn&rsquo;t meaningful enough for me.</p>
<p>Fair and honest.</p>
<p>But lowering one&rsquo;s mile, time to run a mile by,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 10% seems like a reasonable goal</p>
<p>across six months.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So in the case of a goal like that,</p>
<p>clearly there are specific training programs,</p>
<p>but this raises the issue of</p>
<p>what if I have other goals as well?</p>
<p>And at what point do people having multiple goals</p>
<p>start to set up collisions between goals?</p>
<p>How do we know whether or not something is reasonable,</p>
<p>not just on its own,</p>
<p>but because of the other things</p>
<p>that one has structured into their program?</p>
<p>So being able to reduce a mile time by 10% in six months,</p>
<p>okay, maybe that&rsquo;s doable.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>You can tell me,</p>
<p>but also being able to double the amount</p>
<p>that they can do for a single repetition leg extension</p>
<p>for that matter.</p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>that seems, those seem like incompatible goals.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So a couple of things.</p>
<p>Number one,</p>
<p>the more specific and precise you can be with a single goal,</p>
<p>the faster you will get there, generally.</p>
<p>So in theory,</p>
<p>if you had one thing you wanted to achieve,</p>
<p>the best way to go about it is to focus on that.</p>
<p>Give it the most priority.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t do anything else</p>
<p>along the way.</p>
<p>You can, but you would want to focus on that.</p>
<p>The more additional goals you bring in,</p>
<p>the more distraction you&rsquo;re creating for that primary goal.</p>
<p>Depending on what those goals are,</p>
<p>you can actually do them at the same time.</p>
<p>Some other combinations are less effective.</p>
<p>Think about it like this.</p>
<p>We went through those nine adaptations</p>
<p>and we went through them in a specific order on purpose.</p>
<p>The closer those adaptations are together in that list,</p>
<p>the more compatible they are to training each other.</p>
<p>The further away they become more challenging.</p>
<p>So just to give a few examples,</p>
<p>if you wanted to improve your speed and power,</p>
<p>you could basically train those simultaneously.</p>
<p>They would not interfere with each other at all.</p>
<p>In fact, since power is speed times force,</p>
<p>it would be complimentary.</p>
<p>If you just walk down the line from there to strength,</p>
<p>hey, same thing.</p>
<p>If you get faster, that&rsquo;s gonna aid in strength</p>
<p>because force is mass times acceleration.</p>
<p>So if you improve acceleration,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re contributing to strength.</p>
<p>Same thing with power.</p>
<p>So speed, power, and strength</p>
<p>are generally very complimentary.</p>
<p>You can absolutely train all three of those goals</p>
<p>at the same time and have no issues.</p>
<p>Getting into hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve got a little bit of distinction.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna train strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>as we talked about in that episode,</p>
<p>at the base, those are gonna be complimentary.</p>
<p>You add on some muscle, you&rsquo;re gonna get stronger.</p>
<p>You start training for strength,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably gonna help you add on some muscle mass.</p>
<p>As you get to the end of that spectrum,</p>
<p>the overlap between the two starts to go away</p>
<p>such that if you truly wanted to maximize strength</p>
<p>above everything else,</p>
<p>if you continue to train for hypertrophy as well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to take too many resources</p>
<p>out of your recovery bin,</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t be able to do that.</p>
<p>The inverse would also be the same.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re training to maximize strength,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to put enough volume on</p>
<p>to get sufficient hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to then combine speed with hypertrophy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going farther away from each other,</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s going to be more and more distraction.</p>
<p>So the hypertrophy training would cause a ton of fatigue.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to go at max speed</p>
<p>for your speed or power strength.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna be compromising those results.</p>
<p>Now, speed training won&rsquo;t compromise</p>
<p>your hypertrophy training because it&rsquo;s non-fatiguing.</p>
<p>Right, and so boom,</p>
<p>here we have a little bit of an interference effect</p>
<p>one way, but probably not the other.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move down the spectrum one more time</p>
<p>and get into endurance.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t go through all of these things,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re getting the idea here.</p>
<p>Oh, a little bit of a high intensity intervals.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>Now, would that compromise my speed, power, or strength?</p>
<p>Probably because there&rsquo;s a little bit of residual fatigue.</p>
<p>If the volume was low enough, then you&rsquo;d be fine.</p>
<p>All you&rsquo;re worried about there is not necessarily</p>
<p>like some sort of cellular mechanism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just simple fatigue.</p>
<p>It is amount of energy expenditure</p>
<p>versus is that compromising my recovery to come back?</p>
<p>Would those first three or four of those,</p>
<p>speed, power, strength, interfere with your ability</p>
<p>to elevate your anaerobic capacity?</p>
<p>Probably not, almost surely.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at any of the literature</p>
<p>on endurance training, you will see that speed,</p>
<p>power, and strength almost always improve endurance, right?</p>
<p>Endurance training added on top of strength</p>
<p>can be detrimental, can have a neutral effect,</p>
<p>but generally doesn&rsquo;t help one get stronger</p>
<p>by adding additional conditioning, unless you&rsquo;re so unfit,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get through the volume needed</p>
<p>in the strength training, right?</p>
<p>One more example here, so we don&rsquo;t drag this out too far.</p>
<p>In the case of something like I wanna lose fat,</p>
<p>well, hey, we don&rsquo;t have to worry about interference.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re fatigued for your hypertrophy session,</p>
<p>not a big deal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just trying to get some work done.</p>
<p>If your hypertrophy session fatigued you</p>
<p>from your conditioning, it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>because you got the work done,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it so much.</p>
<p>So it really kind of depends on the actual goal.</p>
<p>And what you wanna pay attention to do is actually,</p>
<p>what are the chances of overlap,</p>
<p>which means like what are the adaptations</p>
<p>you get physiologically that cross over</p>
<p>from one to the other?</p>
<p>And then what are the ones</p>
<p>that are actually gonna start interfering?</p>
<p>In fact, in my class, I have this giant matrix chart</p>
<p>of interference effect going from adaptations</p>
<p>through a whole bunch of systems,</p>
<p>everything from like handling pH to lymphatic drainage</p>
<p>to bone mineral density, et cetera.</p>
<p>You can walk through these whole things and say,</p>
<p>which ones actually have a positive effect?</p>
<p>Which ones have a massive positive effect?</p>
<p>And then which ones actually</p>
<p>have a little bit of interference?</p>
<p>And perhaps if you guys are nice enough,</p>
<p>we could throw that into a newsletter or something,</p>
<p>some PDF or something.</p>
<p>I think that would be immensely valuable.</p>
<p>I think some of that more extensive information</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s laid out in grid form like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really useful.</p>
<p>So we should do, well, now we&rsquo;ve said it.</p>
<p>So we-</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say I would do it.</p>
<p>I said, perhaps.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a terrific idea.</p>
<p>The idea that items closer to each other on the list</p>
<p>of those nine different adaptations</p>
<p>are going to be easier to achieve in parallel</p>
<p>than items further apart makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>And what I heard was that there&rsquo;s a few caveats</p>
<p>that might seem minor,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re actually quite important,</p>
<p>such as anything that is relatively low intensity</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t impede recovery</p>
<p>can probably be included as a parallel goal.</p>
<p>So some speed work in conjunction</p>
<p>with some long duration cardio work, for instance,</p>
<p>even though we&rsquo;re talking about number two on that list</p>
<p>and number nine on that list.</p>
<p>In that case, the long duration endurance,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s low intensity,</p>
<p>may actually interfere with the speed</p>
<p>if the volume gets too high.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about, I went on a 30 minute jog,</p>
<p>for most people, it&rsquo;s totally fine.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>is when the miles start piling up</p>
<p>or the time really starts getting there</p>
<p>in combination with some of the things,</p>
<p>the factors we&rsquo;ve talked about earlier,</p>
<p>which is exercise choice.</p>
<p>So more eccentric landing-based exercise choices.</p>
<p>Running, for example,</p>
<p>is more likely to interfere than cycling, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re not landing.</p>
<p>Swimming is low impact.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to do those things,</p>
<p>you can hedge your bets a little bit</p>
<p>by choosing an exercise choice that is less impactful.</p>
<p>Again, if we&rsquo;re literally,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s oftentimes confusing here was like,</p>
<p>oh, don&rsquo;t do 10 minutes on the treadmill before you lift.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna cut, oh, like timeout.</p>
<p>A warmup is fine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really talking about probably more than 30 plus minutes</p>
<p>at higher than 60% heart rate,</p>
<p>like random number, something like that.</p>
<p>Depends on the person, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it has to be a decent chunk.</p>
<p>Again, you can actually fix that</p>
<p>by then just consuming calories.</p>
<p>You can also fix that by making sure everything else</p>
<p>in the hidden invisible stressor bucket is improved.</p>
<p>So this is like one of our tricks that we&rsquo;ll get into</p>
<p>when we get into the recovery</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to reduce your training</p>
<p>if you just ramp up your recovery.</p>

<p>to claim the special offer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take the liberty of assuming</p>
<p>that most people fall into one of either three bins</p>
<p>in terms of their goals.</p>
<p>Again, most people,</p>
<p>certainly there are going to be people</p>
<p>that lie outside these bins.</p>
<p>I think if you polled a hundred people</p>
<p>or a hundred thousand or a million people</p>
<p>as to what their major goals were in working out,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d say, as you so nicely listed out before,</p>
<p>aesthetic changes, functionality, and longevity.</p>
<p>But that one in three really kind of sit higher</p>
<p>than most people would like to perhaps even admit.</p>
<p>They want to look good,</p>
<p>which usually means they want to lose some fat,</p>
<p>gain some muscle in specific places.</p>
<p>I realize there are folks out there</p>
<p>that really want to gain a lot of muscle,</p>
<p>and just muscle everywhere.</p>
<p>But I think most people would like to have</p>
<p>a little more shape here or a little more muscle there</p>
<p>to either balance out their aesthetic</p>
<p>or to accentuate certain parts of their physique.</p>
<p>And they would probably like to shave off</p>
<p>some subcutaneous fat,</p>
<p>although there are those exceptionally lean people out there</p>
<p>and they exist too.</p>
<p>I think it would be gain muscle in specific places,</p>
<p>lose fat, and do it in a way</p>
<p>that also provides some booth</p>
<p>to their health span and longevity.</p>
<p>I would say that might even be 50% of people out there.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m taking the liberty of guesstimating.</p>
<p>Another bin I would venture is interested</p>
<p>in getting stronger and putting on more muscle.</p>
<p>Certainly there are a number of people</p>
<p>that are interested in doing that.</p>
<p>And that could even be more muscle all over</p>
<p>or more muscle with some accentuation to certain areas</p>
<p>where they happen to be weaker</p>
<p>or less developed as it were.</p>
<p>And then the third bin be people</p>
<p>that really enjoy cardiovascular work.</p>
<p>Oh, I should say the second bin</p>
<p>probably care about their longevity also,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really foremost.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, I feel great now and I&rsquo;ll live to be whatever,</p>
<p>but I only wanna do it if I get that much muscle.</p>
<p>We know these kinds of folks.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think this-</p>
<p>I run a poll in my class every year</p>
<p>when I ask like, what you guys all lift?</p>
<p>Of course, like I make them put their hand up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you guys are in my class.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna put your hand up and let you lift weights.</p>
<p>And then I ask them like, why do you train?</p>
<p>And like health is, long-term health is like on the list.</p>
<p>And they all like, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>any of you that selected health are liars.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re 20 to 25, you are not exercising for health.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exercising because you wanna look a certain way</p>
<p>or get stronger.</p>
<p>Once you get past that undergraduate age though,</p>
<p>the actual desire to live longer and better</p>
<p>actually becomes pretty real.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that there are people who wanna feel better.</p>
<p>They know that exercise and the results from exercise</p>
<p>can make them feel better.</p>
<p>Yeah, that second bin tends to be more focused</p>
<p>on the aesthetic change, it seems, or being strong.</p>
<p>And then the third category, I think are people,</p>
<p>I know a lot of folks like this,</p>
<p>who really enjoy what are normally considered</p>
<p>endurance type activities.</p>
<p>And here, I just wanna highlight again</p>
<p>what you so beautifully illustrated in previous episodes</p>
<p>that you can gain a lot of endurance</p>
<p>even using weights or machines.</p>
<p>It just depends on how you use them, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the exercise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about how you perform them, et cetera.</p>
<p>And you, again, beautifully provided all those details</p>
<p>as to how to create endurance</p>
<p>regardless of equipment standards, et cetera.</p>
<p>But that third category seem to be people</p>
<p>who enjoy running, cycling, swimming, hiking, dancing,</p>
<p>activities that they can do for long periods of time</p>
<p>that often will involve some sort of skill</p>
<p>that is based on improving motor patterns.</p>
<p>So maybe not so much stride,</p>
<p>but certainly for people that really love tennis,</p>
<p>people that love a sport like golf, right?</p>
<p>Do they wanna be able to not just walk,</p>
<p>they wanna walk the 18 holes,</p>
<p>they wanna have a great golf swing, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a golf player,</p>
<p>so forgive me if my nomenclature is off.</p>
<p>So I would say there are three-</p>
<p>Golfer.</p>
<p>Yeah, golfer.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t play golf.</p>
<p>Oh, got it, you don&rsquo;t play golf.</p>
<p>Well, you play golf, you wouldn&rsquo;t call a golf player.</p>
<p>I played miniature golf a few times, that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>Although Stanford does have a beautiful golf course,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m told I should learn how to play golf.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come up and play it for you if you want.</p>
<p>You come up, I&rsquo;ll play it, I&rsquo;ll tell you how it works.</p>
<p>Get me on that course.</p>
<p>I almost see it from my lab.</p>
<p>So category one, I think,</p>
<p>is a significant fraction of people.</p>
<p>So as we lay out these different ways to assess goals,</p>
<p>and as we approach the structure of a program,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ll tell us,</p>
<p>if we could perhaps touch back to those</p>
<p>every once in a while,</p>
<p>again, I&rsquo;m taking the liberty of assuming</p>
<p>we will net about 80 to 90% of people out there.</p>
<p>Again, those categories being people</p>
<p>who want to lose some fat,</p>
<p>maybe build some muscle in specific areas on their body,</p>
<p>and really want to be healthy.</p>
<p>They want to feel great,</p>
<p>and they want to have a long healthspan and lifespan.</p>
<p>They want to live a long time feeling great.</p>
<p>Second category,</p>
<p>people want to build more muscle and strength.</p>
<p>Sure, they don&rsquo;t want to damage their health,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not their main focus.</p>
<p>Their main focus is on building muscle and strength.</p>
<p>And then that third category of people</p>
<p>who really wants to do more endurance type work,</p>
<p>feel great and strong doing it,</p>
<p>but not because they can carry heavy weights</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re doing it,</p>
<p>but rather they can feel vital</p>
<p>and they can push harder for longer.</p>
<p>And maybe even translate that</p>
<p>to some of the more recreational type activities</p>
<p>or sports like tennis and things that are more long duration</p>
<p>playing soccer, maybe even softball or things of that sort.</p>
<p>Yeah, surfing, swimming.</p>
<p>So those three categories,</p>
<p>maybe we could call those bin A, B and C</p>
<p>for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re willing to embrace that,</p>
<p>I think that will be informative toward our listeners</p>
<p>in a way that simply not assuming</p>
<p>what people&rsquo;s different goals are</p>
<p>might not be able to accomplish.</p>
<p>Said differently, hopefully by doing that,</p>
<p>people will derive a lot more</p>
<p>from the description of the program</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to give us.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Now, I am certain that I want to let you return</p>
<p>to your list of the five things</p>
<p>that people need to consider</p>
<p>when establishing a exercise program.</p>
<p>Yeah, great, let&rsquo;s do that.</p>
<p>I also do want to acknowledge a point</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve brought up acutely.</p>
<p>Exercise doesn&rsquo;t mean just lifting weights.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my background, that&rsquo;s what I spend my time on.</p>
<p>So I sort of default to examples in that category,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve articulated plenty of other ways</p>
<p>where you can get amazing forms of exercise</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with lifting weights.</p>
<p>So for those folks in, was it bin C or three?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Bin C, we go A is gain muscle, lose fat,</p>
<p>be healthy now and forever.</p>
<p>Bin B is get stronger, gain muscle,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t damage your health,</p>
<p>but not really focus on health in the immediate term.</p>
<p>And then bin C is want to play</p>
<p>or do endurance type activities</p>
<p>and quote unquote feel strong doing it.</p>
<p>So have more vigor to be able to do that longer</p>
<p>and maybe with more attention to skill, et cetera.</p>
<p>And of course, also want to improve their health.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ve effectively done</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve given us three different avatars</p>
<p>with three different goals, right?</p>
<p>So the next step for each person or group</p>
<p>is going to be to identify their defenders.</p>
<p>But before we get that,</p>
<p>we got to close the loop on this smart thing.</p>
<p>So in each case, they have either chosen that goal</p>
<p>based on their personal preference</p>
<p>or perhaps they did our fitness testing protocol</p>
<p>and realized they need to gain strength.</p>
<p>So whether the reason they chose to be in buckets B</p>
<p>or A or C was because of our protocol</p>
<p>or personal preference, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>They still want to go through this process</p>
<p>of laying out their goals</p>
<p>and making sure that again, they are specific, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go through bin C, which is a great one.</p>
<p>So you want to have more energy</p>
<p>and you want to feel stronger</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing your kiteboarding.</p>
<p>You want to feel stronger</p>
<p>when you finish your round of tennis,</p>
<p>round of golf, game of tennis.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a different strength.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>See, I hear, I know what you&rsquo;re saying though.</p>
<p>So that goal needs to be specific to that, right?</p>
<p>So it would be hard to make a goal</p>
<p>like I want to feel better at the end of my round.</p>
<p>Boy, that depends on too many other factors.</p>
<p>A better goal would be something like this.</p>
<p>I want to be able to run this two mile loop</p>
<p>that I do around my neighborhood</p>
<p>and I want to do it and have a lower heart rate at the end.</p>
<p>Or I want to be able to get my heart rate back,</p>
<p>my heart rate recovery back faster.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>That will probably align with you feeling</p>
<p>quote unquote stronger with it, right?</p>
<p>So I did the same course</p>
<p>and either I can do it at the same speed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not nearly as hard,</p>
<p>or I can go faster, whichever one, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But that would be an example of a specific goal.</p>
<p>The other buckets you laid out</p>
<p>kind of already have specific goals.</p>
<p>Like I want to get stronger.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s going to be the goal.</p>
<p>The other one is going to be,</p>
<p>you know, I want to lose some fat.</p>
<p>The goal is sort of implicit in that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the other people where you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care about that.</p>
<p>I just want to be able to surf the great waves</p>
<p>and then not feel exhausted afterwards.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>Well, then you still should pick a metric</p>
<p>that is not that activity maybe,</p>
<p>because it won&rsquo;t be within your control,</p>
<p>depending on the waves and the temperature</p>
<p>and all this stuff,</p>
<p>that you can use as a proxy to say,</p>
<p>if I were to do something</p>
<p>that represented me feeling probably better when I surf,</p>
<p>what would that be?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not perfect,</p>
<p>but it should be still as specific as you could get.</p>
<p>You still want to make sure it&rsquo;s measurable.</p>
<p>Again, in this example,</p>
<p>it might be something like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to go to the pool</p>
<p>and time how long it takes you to swim 800 meters</p>
<p>or something, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s attainable.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll set a goal that&rsquo;s realistic and timely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to improve by 5% in the next two months.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>That probably falls into the realm.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re making the assumption</p>
<p>that if you did that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably feel better</p>
<p>when you go out to do your primary activity,</p>
<p>which is safe surf.</p>
<p>The reality of it is,</p>
<p>every time we work with an actual athlete,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>Athletes don&rsquo;t come to us to lift weights.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t come to us to get stronger.</p>
<p>They come to us because they want to play better</p>
<p>and they want to stay on the field more.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re trying to convince them of is,</p>
<p>if you do this thing in the gym,</p>
<p>then that should translate into you being better</p>
<p>at your sport, recovering faster, being less injured.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still just a proxy.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with these other non-specific goals,</p>
<p>especially when they&rsquo;re performance-based goals.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t package it that way,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really what you talked about for Bin C there.</p>
<p>It is a performance-based goal.</p>
<p>I want to be able to perform when I&rsquo;m in the field.</p>
<p>In my brain, that&rsquo;s a sport.</p>
<p>In your brain, it&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re at yoga class.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve said this earlier in our series</p>
<p>that if you have a body, you&rsquo;re an athlete.</p>
<p>I want to prepare your body</p>
<p>such that it can do exactly what you want it to do.</p>
<p>You then get to have the choice of what you ask it to do.</p>
<p>You call it a sport.</p>
<p>You call it your Saturday hike with your family.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>You get control of your body performing</p>
<p>the way you want it to perform,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what this whole thing is about.</p>
<p>Great, so now that we&rsquo;ve covered, I think,</p>
<p>as much as we need to regarding assessing</p>
<p>and choosing a goal,</p>
<p>I want to get back to this idea of identifying your defender.</p>
<p>So you really need to think carefully</p>
<p>about what is stopping you from hitting those goals.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re forecasting a little bit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also going back into your own personal history.</p>
<p>Do you have history of knee pain?</p>
<p>Do you have a history of working too much?</p>
<p>Do you have a history of a lot of travel?</p>
<p>Do you have a history of getting sick a lot?</p>
<p>What are these things that are happening</p>
<p>that are gonna stop you from hitting your goal?</p>
<p>A couple of examples I&rsquo;ve already laid out,</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t need to go too much longer here,</p>
<p>but in the case of somebody who is in maybe bin A,</p>
<p>which is I want to lose some fat,</p>
<p>maybe gain a little bit of muscle.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s stopping you from the strength</p>
<p>and conditioning side?</p>
<p>Is it the fact that you can&rsquo;t train consistent enough?</p>
<p>Is it a fact that when you go to train,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what to do?</p>
<p>Is it a fact that when you go to train,</p>
<p>you train your ass off and you&rsquo;re not getting results?</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>All three of these different scenarios</p>
<p>are going to result in different programs</p>
<p>because they have different reasons you&rsquo;re failing.</p>
<p>And that is really critical.</p>
<p>Instead of just going, I want a fat loss program</p>
<p>and picking one up off the internet,</p>
<p>it may not actually be addressing</p>
<p>the point of failure for you.</p>
<p>So the sooner you can choose your programs</p>
<p>based on why you&rsquo;re failing,</p>
<p>the sooner you&rsquo;ll start getting results.</p>
<p>You have to run a little bit of a critical analysis there.</p>
<p>And it can be, you know, something scientific</p>
<p>and it could be a measurement.</p>
<p>And it also could just be you thinking about</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve tried this in the past and why didn&rsquo;t it work?</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t that interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, tell me more about why it wasn&rsquo;t interesting.</p>
<p>Oh, I just, I&rsquo;m not really into machines.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all I had.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Or I loved it.</p>
<p>I loved the gym I was at and I was getting results,</p>
<p>but it was so far away.</p>
<p>Okay, interesting.</p>
<p>Why did you stop before?</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t it work?</p>
<p>Or if it did work in the past, amazing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to something similar,</p>
<p>but has your life changed at all?</p>
<p>Is there anything different about now</p>
<p>than when it worked three years ago?</p>
<p>Yes, no.</p>
<p>Maybe we run it right back.</p>
<p>If it is, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna sort of predict those things.</p>
<p>And you wanna work, effectively what I&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>throughout this entire 10-step process is going to be</p>
<p>you wanna make sure that there are</p>
<p>the non-negotiables that are in your life</p>
<p>that you know are going to be ahead of your fitness program.</p>
<p>And you wanna work with those things, not against them.</p>
<p>Right, because life will win.</p>
<p>When it comes to your children, when it comes to your job,</p>
<p>life is going to win.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to give up something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take some hard work,</p>
<p>but we wanna fight the right battles for most people.</p>
<p>Even for our professional athletes,</p>
<p>we get this all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like they have nothing else to do but train.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, well, hold on now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting traded.</p>
<p>They have agents to deal with.</p>
<p>They may not have a contract.</p>
<p>They have families, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Life will get in the way, I promise.</p>
<p>And so you wanna fight the battles that you can win,</p>
<p>not ones that you&rsquo;re going to lose.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s really what this game is about.</p>
<p>So if the battle is, hey, my job is super hectic.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna come up with a different strategy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more flexible, maybe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still gonna hold you to the fire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna be easier on you,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re just not going to try to set up a situation</p>
<p>where you have to do this workout Monday,</p>
<p>Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday,</p>
<p>because you know your job is on the road</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the provide all the income</p>
<p>for your family and your children.</p>
<p>Okay, whatever the thing is, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we really wanna identify.</p>
<p>So when I say identify your defenders,</p>
<p>you need to run a little bit of a critical analysis on this</p>
<p>and a little bit of a tool I&rsquo;ll use for this</p>
<p>is a modification of another system I stole from Kenny Kane,</p>
<p>which is what we call the quadrant system.</p>
<p>So you can imagine everything in your life</p>
<p>goes into one of four buckets, all right?</p>
<p>Now, bucket one, I&rsquo;m just gonna call business.</p>
<p>And this has anything to do with your job, income,</p>
<p>sort of all those things.</p>
<p>Bucket two is relationships.</p>
<p>So again, this could be family or love life,</p>
<p>like anything that we would call a relationship.</p>
<p>Social connection, purpose, anything, right?</p>
<p>Bucket three is your fitness</p>
<p>and bucket four is your recovery.</p>
<p>So one of the first steps we take</p>
<p>is we walk through this and we say,</p>
<p>all right, you have 10 points total</p>
<p>and you get to distribute these 10 points</p>
<p>across the four areas.</p>
<p>So not 10 each, you get 10 total.</p>
<p>And so we walk through and we say,</p>
<p>right now, where are you giving your points?</p>
<p>And we could do this right now for you if you&rsquo;d like,</p>
<p>or I could make up a scenario.</p>
<p>Do you wanna do it?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Great, so Andrew, right now in the last month,</p>
<p>if you had 10 points total in those four categories,</p>
<p>where would you be distributing the most points?</p>
<p>Which category and how many points would that be?</p>
<p>Business, my work.</p>
<p>Business, work, job, sort of all those things.</p>
<p>And how many out of 10?</p>
<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t, I should say, ever quite feel like work.</p>
<p>Running a laboratory and doing the podcast</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t ever really feel like work in the traditional sense,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s career, it&rsquo;s work, it involves relationships,</p>
<p>but it certainly doesn&rsquo;t enhance my fitness,</p>
<p>except of my vocal cords, and recovery.</p>
<p>So with those notes there,</p>
<p>I would say four to five.</p>
<p>You pick.</p>
<p>Five.</p>
<p>Five, fair.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most common number.</p>
<p>Five, business, five.</p>
<p>Great, once again, I&rsquo;m typical, which makes me happy.</p>
<p>You nailed it.</p>
<p>One of the few ways in which I&rsquo;ve been accused</p>
<p>of being normal.</p>
<p>I picked five for business.</p>
<p>No kidding.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next highest, and what&rsquo;s that score?</p>
<p>I do invest in relationships.</p>
<p>I would say, does it have to be around,</p>
<p>can it be a decimal?</p>
<p>It has to be a whole integer.</p>
<p>A whole integer.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>All right, we&rsquo;re seven out of 10 here.</p>
<p>So would you say it is fair</p>
<p>that you spend roughly 2 1‚ÅÑ2% of your,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessarily time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s energy, time, focus, sort of all of these things,</p>
<p>2 1‚ÅÑ2 times as much on your business</p>
<p>as you do in your relationships?</p>
<p>It varies depending on what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>It feels a little skewed in the direction of business,</p>
<p>so I might want to adjust to a four-three ratio there.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>But I think I&rsquo;m gonna hold to five,</p>
<p>two business relationships,</p>
<p>and then just for sake of example,</p>
<p>and because this doesn&rsquo;t seem like</p>
<p>an exceedingly precise measure,</p>
<p>it can have some slop.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Where would you put fitness and recovery?</p>
<p>I definitely put energy into fitness,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna give that also a two.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Which leaves?</p>
<p>One for recovery.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>That, what you just laid out is,</p>
<p>again, the most quintessential split you could have.</p>
<p>In fact, you run this game on everyone,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna come up with basically the same answer,</p>
<p>unless they don&rsquo;t work out or whatever, right?</p>
<p>Okay, so a couple of rules here.</p>
<p>Recovery must be at minimum</p>
<p>half of your fitness allocation.</p>
<p>In your case, two to one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna say it has to be half,</p>
<p>like it has to be five out of 10 points,</p>
<p>in which case it doesn&rsquo;t leave much for anything else.</p>
<p>I would like it to be minimum 20% of the total,</p>
<p>which means two out of 10.</p>
<p>Now, and when I say recovery,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t simply mean muscle.</p>
<p>I mean, you need personal time.</p>
<p>You need meditation.</p>
<p>You need sleep.</p>
<p>You need to go to a concert and get out and see people.</p>
<p>Whatever the things that give you energy back, right?</p>
<p>Some folks, that&rsquo;s personal time.</p>
<p>Some folks, that&rsquo;s social time.</p>
<p>Whatever that means to you, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually get a lot of energy from my work.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why some of these numbers are a little bit,</p>
<p>you can kind of cloak the underlying dynamics.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what we do from this game.</p>
<p>We look at that and we say,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s our split, Andrew, five, three, two, one.</p>
<p>Five, two, two, one.</p>
<p>Five, two, two, one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to be able to put three in relationships,</p>
<p>just because, but then I need 11 out of.</p>
<p>Right, so here&rsquo;s the fun game we play.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re currently at this and you don&rsquo;t get to add to 11.</p>
<p>You have to stay at 10.</p>
<p>Your 10 is different than my 10, maybe, right?</p>
<p>But 10 is 10 or just whatever the maximum</p>
<p>you can actually do, it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>So if we went back to our training goal,</p>
<p>whatever that goal was for you,</p>
<p>and we went back to our defenders,</p>
<p>we would look at this score now and say,</p>
<p>is three out of 10, fitness is three, right?</p>
<p>Fitness is two.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s five, two, two, one.</p>
<p>Is two out of 10 sufficient to hit that training goal</p>
<p>in that timeframe you described?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say you said,</p>
<p>I wanna hit a new PR in my mile six months from now.</p>
<p>Yeah, for simplicity&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>and also because it&rsquo;s largely true,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put myself in what I refer to as bin A earlier.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>My bifat percentage is okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the range that I would like,</p>
<p>but I would like to bring it down a little bit,</p>
<p>gain a little bit muscle here and there,</p>
<p>keep or gain some endurance.</p>
<p>And certainly, certainly my immediate</p>
<p>and long-term health are extremely important to me.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So then the question, and then the answer may be yes,</p>
<p>that this is the optimal split for you.</p>
<p>If it is not, then we have to make a choice.</p>
<p>We either alter the goal or the timeline</p>
<p>to make it realistic, or we alter our quadrant.</p>
<p>And then if we&rsquo;re going to alter our quadrant,</p>
<p>the next step is critically important.</p>
<p>We need a list of very specific life actions</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to take that allows that split to happen.</p>
<p>So if you said, for example,</p>
<p>I wanna put three into relationships, great.</p>
<p>What specific life actions are you going to take</p>
<p>to pull one from fitness,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t pull any from recovery, or one from business?</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to actually answer this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too personal.</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t like making these things about you.</p>
<p>Right, and that&rsquo;s the other reason to do it.</p>
<p>It is a diabolical trick to insist that these</p>
<p>be whole integers.</p>
<p>Because I would have done a 4.5 for business</p>
<p>and a 2.5 for relationships,</p>
<p>but obviously you write the rules on this, not me.</p>
<p>So you would just walk through that list, okay?</p>
<p>And the list could be something like,</p>
<p>I promise to not work after 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Thursday through Sunday.</p>
<p>Or whatever the thing is, right?</p>
<p>I promise I&rsquo;m gonna make sure that I don&rsquo;t start work</p>
<p>before 8 a.m. or whatever, right?</p>
<p>No more trips.</p>
<p>Just make those things specific and measurable.</p>
<p>Not just like, I&rsquo;m gonna work less.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s never gonna go.</p>
<p>What is the very specific life action you&rsquo;re going to take?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be an alarm that goes off</p>
<p>Tuesday night at 4, 5 p.m.</p>
<p>And no matter what we, at Barbell Shrugged,</p>
<p>we used to have a little shirt that was like D3AT,</p>
<p>which is like drop everything and train.</p>
<p>Which means at 3 p.m. in the afternoon,</p>
<p>no matter what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>we dropped everything and trained.</p>
<p>Because that was like, when you start a business</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going, things just run away from you, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just sort of like, man, it&rsquo;s not my company,</p>
<p>but those guys are like,</p>
<p>we are a strength and conditioning company</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not training.</p>
<p>So we had to just make this hard rule</p>
<p>and it was just like a little thing that came up</p>
<p>and it was easy to say,</p>
<p>drop everything and train, 3 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>I like this drop D, E, everything, A, and blank.</p>
<p>Like it could be drop everything and, you know,</p>
<p>pick your favorite.</p>
<p>Totally, drop everything and read.</p>
<p>Pick the relevant, read.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>You know, I really miss reading for pleasure.</p>
<p>I would put that under recovery.</p>
<p>And potentially-</p>
<p>Drop everything and breathe.</p>
<p>Oh, and breathe, you were saying.</p>
<p>Oh, and breathe.</p>
<p>I was saying read.</p>
<p>I said that too.</p>
<p>Yeah, because for me,</p>
<p>reading is actually is both recovery and relationship.</p>
<p>Because oftentimes in my relationships,</p>
<p>I insist, not insisted.</p>
<p>I certainly didn&rsquo;t insist.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a format of reading the same book in parallel.</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>Yeah, not necessarily side by side,</p>
<p>but the same book in parallel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful practice</p>
<p>or listening to the same audio book.</p>
<p>It works well.</p>
<p>You can drop everything and play.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just going to go do something fun.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to play video games.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to go play with your kid.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to do whatever, play with your dog.</p>
<p>Like it doesn&rsquo;t have to actually be play,</p>
<p>but play to you could signify personal time, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>So yeah, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I really like this drop everything and blank category</p>
<p>that you probably shouldn&rsquo;t have more than what,</p>
<p>two or three of those overall.</p>
<p>Pretty much like one is the one to two,</p>
<p>maybe is where you want to go after that.</p>
<p>So the idea is then to redistribute the numbers on this list</p>
<p>but through a very concrete action.</p>
<p>And I like this drop everything and blank</p>
<p>because it speaks to the non-negotiable aspect of it.</p>
<p>Has to be.</p>
<p>Life will get pushed, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fine time to, right?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in next year I&rsquo;m going to.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you put those things,</p>
<p>those things you might as well just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even put on your list, right?</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re talking to somebody who loves rules</p>
<p>because when they are non-negotiable rules,</p>
<p>they provide this incredible organizing force for the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a neuroscience thing in my mind.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And actually we did an episode on happiness</p>
<p>where you find that once people make a decision,</p>
<p>if they eliminate the possibility of other decisions,</p>
<p>like literally the hatch is closed, that is it.</p>
<p>Burn the boats.</p>
<p>The rates of subjective happiness,</p>
<p>immediate and long-term happiness over time go way, way up.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m convinced that the nervous system</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t like to keep the valves</p>
<p>on these dopamine circuits open.</p>
<p>I actually think it diminishes from the reward component.</p>
<p>And there are actually some data on this.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t want to take us off track, but.</p>
<p>The last part of this, what we do then,</p>
<p>is we take that quadrant and we take that list</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re going to print it physically.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to put it in two places.</p>
<p>This could actually be on your phone.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to print it, you can screenshot it.</p>
<p>It can be the background of your phone.</p>
<p>So every time you click on your phone,</p>
<p>you immediately see that quadrant.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a very clear reminder of like,</p>
<p>what are my priorities today, right?</p>
<p>Just a simple little picture.</p>
<p>I also like to put it in your place of failure.</p>
<p>So for a lot of people that is like on their laptop</p>
<p>or right above their workstation, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the thing that&rsquo;s going to lose</p>
<p>and beat your fitness is your job, typically, right?</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s on your TV.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on your Netflix control.</p>
<p>No, sorry, Netflix, no offense.</p>
<p>But you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s whatever the thing is that you fail for.</p>
<p>I play too many video games.</p>
<p>Great, there, I work too much.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>And you put it there and you put it also,</p>
<p>the last component is it has to also be</p>
<p>in the hands of somebody who can hold you accountable, right?</p>
<p>Wife, training partner, business partner, whatever.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, hey, Andrew,</p>
<p>like you promised you were going to do X yourself.</p>
<p>Why are you still here?</p>
<p>You committed to this.</p>
<p>You got to get out of here.</p>
<p>Someone who will like, be like, no, no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s drop everything and read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s eight o&rsquo;clock, you&rsquo;re supposed to be reading.</p>
<p>You got to go.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get a check back in on that.</p>
<p>Check back in every week, check back in.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter every month.</p>
<p>And then you can adjust, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You can always change the system,</p>
<p>but that has to now change.</p>
<p>You got to print a new one.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s a whole new promise you&rsquo;ve made to yourself.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to be able to hold yourself accountable</p>
<p>to those things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be flexible enough to where it&rsquo;s realistic.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be, I&rsquo;m not going to work</p>
<p>after six o&rsquo;clock every day.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just three days a week.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s on Saturdays,</p>
<p>I promise to work for the first two hours</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t work Saturday night or whatever,</p>
<p>or the inverse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to work Saturday, you get it.</p>
<p>You could come up with a million examples here.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the system we use to make sure</p>
<p>that we have now properly identified where we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>We found a roadmap to that.</p>
<p>And now we know exactly how we&rsquo;re going to stay on track.</p>
<p>I have to take this opportunity to add one more thing</p>
<p>to our drop everything list.</p>
<p>And you gave the example of deer,</p>
<p>which is maybe drop everything and read</p>
<p>or drop everything and relax, or another example.</p>
<p>I have to add a deal, which is drop everything.</p>
<p>And this is for you, Lex, love.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the advantages of having a dog</p>
<p>or having children is that the drop everything</p>
<p>and love is often enforced by the faces</p>
<p>of those that you love.</p>
<p>They just show up in whatever space you happen to be in.</p>
<p>Especially if you work from home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a brief break</p>
<p>to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that many of the factors</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health</p>
<p>and wellbeing can only be analyzed</p>
<p>from a quality blood test.</p>
<p>One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests</p>
<p>out there, however, is that you get information back</p>
<p>about various levels of lipids and hormones</p>
<p>and metabolic factors, et cetera,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what to do with that information.</p>
<p>InsideTracker makes knowing what to do</p>
<p>with all that information exceedingly easy.</p>
<p>They have a personalized platform</p>
<p>that lets you see what your specific numbers are,</p>
<p>of course, but then also what sorts</p>
<p>of behavioral do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts,</p>
<p>what sorts of nutritional changes,</p>
<p>what sorts of supplementation would allow you</p>
<p>to bring those levels into the ranges</p>
<p>that are optimal for you.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to the next one, shall we?</p>
<p>Number three here is going to be what I call calendar</p>
<p>or sort of timeframe.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going back a little bit in saying</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve decided on this goal</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve identified the defenders.</p>
<p>Now we need to come up with a realistic timeframe</p>
<p>for how long it&rsquo;s going to take to accomplish that goal.</p>
<p>And when you do that,</p>
<p>you need to look at your life schedule.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is,</p>
<p>do you have important deadlines coming up?</p>
<p>Do you have holiday?</p>
<p>Do you have a trip?</p>
<p>Do you have travel?</p>
<p>Do your children have something coming up?</p>
<p>You need to take all that information.</p>
<p>And I literally lay out a calendar</p>
<p>and I write all those dates in a physical calendar first.</p>
<p>And the reason I&rsquo;m suggesting this</p>
<p>is you want to work your training backwards around that.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve been discussing, life will win.</p>
<p>If you try to plan a training program</p>
<p>that is five days a week, 90 minutes a day,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you look two weeks from now</p>
<p>and you realize you&rsquo;ve got a grant deadline</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve got to take two days to go to Austin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just foolish.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to fail and then you&rsquo;re going to quit</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to be like,</p>
<p>man, again, my training program failed.</p>
<p>So you need to figure out what the non-negotiables are</p>
<p>in that business quadrant and just not be foolish.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s imagine you&rsquo;re going to plot out</p>
<p>say a 12 week training phase</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve decided on this goal.</p>
<p>And then you look and you realize</p>
<p>in the middle of this 12 week span,</p>
<p>week five is really hectic and chaotic.</p>
<p>Or you realize that this is a quarter</p>
<p>in which something important is due.</p>
<p>Maybe we want to either adjust the goal</p>
<p>or what we really do in this step</p>
<p>is going on to actually step number four,</p>
<p>which is choose the number of days per week you can exercise</p>
<p>and the length in terms of amount of time</p>
<p>you can truly afford to train.</p>
<p>I would rather you underestimate that than overestimate it.</p>
<p>So again, you look at the calendar,</p>
<p>you put all these non-negotiables,</p>
<p>the deadlines you cannot move in the calendar.</p>
<p>And then you say, look, based on this,</p>
<p>realistically I can conservatively train</p>
<p>three days a week for 60 minutes total.</p>
<p>And that includes the time I walk into the gym,</p>
<p>my warmup, my down regulation, breathing at the end,</p>
<p>and then me getting back either in the shower and back.</p>
<p>Because really now it&rsquo;s maybe 90 minutes.</p>
<p>By the time you traveled, you transitioned,</p>
<p>you picked back up on work, you showered, you ate, et cetera.</p>
<p>That time just runs away from you.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden it was a two and a half hour thing,</p>
<p>even though it was a 45 minute workout.</p>
<p>So you really need to figure that thing out.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a few weeks in and you realize,</p>
<p>oh, I actually have a little more time than I thought,</p>
<p>you can always train more.</p>
<p>You can do another thing, you can add it.</p>
<p>But what you don&rsquo;t want to do is set up a program</p>
<p>that is requiring you to do certain exercises on one day</p>
<p>or certain styles of training on another.</p>
<p>And then you constantly miss one of those days.</p>
<p>I thought I could do four days a week,</p>
<p>but one day a week something&rsquo;s getting pulled out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just gonna keep you off schedule,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna make you feel like a failure,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna run into problems with your training.</p>
<p>So schedule three, if you are sure you can get three,</p>
<p>and if there&rsquo;s an extra day,</p>
<p>we can always do other fun stuff.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really step three and four.</p>
<p>Figure out your life events over the course of this time.</p>
<p>How many days a week can you train?</p>
<p>And how long in terms of minutes per workout?</p>
<p>Notice, we haven&rsquo;t selected a single exercise yet.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t worried about how heavy, rest intervals,</p>
<p>all those modifiable variables.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to pick those later.</p>
<p>First, where are we going?</p>
<p>Second, how are we going to get there?</p>
<p>Which is the quadrant in identifying of defenders.</p>
<p>And then the third is, what are the restrictions</p>
<p>I need to place on myself in terms of program design</p>
<p>based on how often and how long I can work out?</p>
<p>That is going to allow you to go back</p>
<p>to some of the previous episodes and go,</p>
<p>man, you gave us all kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>How do I know which one to choose?</p>
<p>This is your answer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to choose based upon the limitations</p>
<p>of time and frequency.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve already said,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s imagine we&rsquo;re in bucket A or bucket C,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And you go, look, the most I can afford with where I&rsquo;m at</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s going on in my life is three days a week.</p>
<p>Well, we automatically know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to start training,</p>
<p>choosing a training style</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s limited to three days a week.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even worry about the four or five days.</p>
<p>Those are off the table.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve placed restrictions.</p>
<p>It kind of goes back to that concept of,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of your podcast guests, Jocko, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, hey,</p>
<p>structure gives us actually some freedom.</p>
<p>So by creating some restrictions here</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re a little more free to go,</p>
<p>I only actually have to choose between A and B</p>
<p>rather than sitting down and going,</p>
<p>man, there&rsquo;s all, I&rsquo;m 20 hours</p>
<p>into this exercise podcast thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many options which one to pick.</p>
<p>Well, you create a little bit of restriction</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s easier to go,</p>
<p>oh, my only option is A or B.</p>
<p>And there we go.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s number four.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s three and four.</p>
<p>At that point, once we&rsquo;re good there,</p>
<p>now what you wanna do is go to step number five,</p>
<p>which is actually select your exercises or your movements.</p>
<p>And this is gonna be as simple as selecting like,</p>
<p>you know, a kettlebell swing or running or swimming.</p>
<p>It could be your entire exercise mode.</p>
<p>And what you wanna do with exercise selection here</p>
<p>is make sure that you&rsquo;re balancing those exercises</p>
<p>across the whole week,</p>
<p>not within necessarily every workout.</p>
<p>So if you have four days a week, five days a week,</p>
<p>you wanna look at the exercise selection and say,</p>
<p>okay, I need to have somewhat of a reasonable balance</p>
<p>between movement patterns or muscle groups</p>
<p>or front and back, side to side,</p>
<p>however you&rsquo;re thinking of it, just across that week.</p>
<p>So again, say we&rsquo;re on a three-day program.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re in either of the buckets,</p>
<p>any of the buckets really.</p>
<p>And we say, okay, great.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not ideal if all I select is cycling every day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a lot of balance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t notice any, there&rsquo;s no upper body work there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no torso work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other position.</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;m gonna really focus on cycling.</p>
<p>So I will do only cycling two days a week,</p>
<p>but that third day I need to pick something</p>
<p>for the other movement areas.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna make sure you stay in a reasonable balance.</p>
<p>If you have an exercise that you like, great.</p>
<p>If you have exercise you have access to.</p>
<p>Again, maybe the gym is a giant pain in the ass.</p>
<p>And so you can say, look, it&rsquo;s too far away.</p>
<p>The closest one is 45 minutes there and back.</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;m gonna restrict myself</p>
<p>to only kettlebell and bands and running</p>
<p>because I can do those in my house.</p>
<p>Awesome, we&rsquo;ve actually created some freedom</p>
<p>because we gave ourselves some restriction.</p>
<p>And now we just have to figure out</p>
<p>how am I going to give some movement patterns</p>
<p>somewhat balanced across my three days?</p>
<p>So really when it comes to exercise choice,</p>
<p>it is selecting the patterns that you know how to execute,</p>
<p>giving yourself, again, somewhat of a balance</p>
<p>between the muscles and the joints</p>
<p>and the movement patterns,</p>
<p>making sure that you are specifically targeting</p>
<p>any muscle group or movement that you want.</p>
<p>So making sure you wanna improve muscle size in your glutes,</p>
<p>you better make sure some of the exercises you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>at least one day a week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling it in your actual glutes.</p>
<p>So you can check that box.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be every exercise.</p>
<p>It probably shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be every single day,</p>
<p>but make sure it&rsquo;s checked off somewhere on that list.</p>
<p>And the last one is,</p>
<p>is there a strategy in which you can progress it?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m just gonna do body weight exercises.</p>
<p>Okay, great, well, how are you gonna progress those?</p>
<p>In the case of like body weight,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to add load.</p>
<p>Maybe you can put a weight vest on or something,</p>
<p>but then maybe you don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s an extra thing or that can only go so far.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s my progression strategy gonna be?</p>
<p>Well, in this case, maybe you just increase the complexity</p>
<p>by going from two legs, like say a body weight squat,</p>
<p>to a single leg squat, or you just increase repetitions</p>
<p>or you increase time you&rsquo;re gonna hold.</p>
<p>My point is your progression strategy</p>
<p>will be based upon the restrictions that you placed</p>
<p>based on availability and things like that.</p>
<p>The last thing I would recommend here</p>
<p>in terms of exercise progression,</p>
<p>to make sure that you can continue to do these things</p>
<p>while lowering your risk of injury,</p>
<p>both in the short term and long term,</p>
<p>is to progress your exercise complexity in this fashion.</p>
<p>So make sure, number one,</p>
<p>you can do the exercise properly with assistance.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s imagine a scenario</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re going to try to squat.</p>
<p>So give yourself, put your hands on a bench</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Now, can you execute that squat perfectly with assistance?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re holding onto something.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t, then don&rsquo;t progress past that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go now do a barbell back squat</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t do it correctly when you had assistance.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s assume most people can do that.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Now you can move on to the next step,</p>
<p>which is can you do it well without assistance?</p>
<p>So this would be body weight only.</p>
<p>Check, cool.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good there.</p>
<p>Okay, now you can go ahead and move on.</p>
<p>Can you do it well with an added eccentric load?</p>
<p>So in this particular case,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re learning to squat,</p>
<p>we can do it well when I hold onto something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Okay, now I can do it well with just my body weight.</p>
<p>Now, if I put a little bit of weight on,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a kettlebell in the front,</p>
<p>like a goblet squat or dumbbells to the side</p>
<p>or whatever you want to do,</p>
<p>can I lower it and go all the way down</p>
<p>and stay in perfect position?</p>
<p>If you can do that, great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed to go to the next step,</p>
<p>which is can you hold isometrically?</p>
<p>So can you go all the way down</p>
<p>and then hold that bottom position?</p>
<p>What you don&rsquo;t want to do is start adding load</p>
<p>or speed or fatigue</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going down to the bottom position of the movement</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re out of control.</p>
<p>We really want to avoid this.</p>
<p>So I want you to show me,</p>
<p>you can go down and you can lower the weight under control.</p>
<p>You can hold it in that position under control.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re clear there,</p>
<p>now we can add the concentric portion, right?</p>
<p>You can now go ahead and you can lower it.</p>
<p>You can hold that position of most danger.</p>
<p>Now you can move up at whatever speed we want.</p>
<p>We are all good there.</p>
<p>Once you can show me those things,</p>
<p>you can add the last two steps,</p>
<p>which are now speed if you choose to.</p>
<p>And the last one, which is fatigue, right?</p>
<p>I would really discourage people</p>
<p>from doing exercises to fatigue,</p>
<p>especially with a moderate or high load,</p>
<p>unless you can promise me you can do these first six steps.</p>
<p>If you can, you can basically go hog wild</p>
<p>with your training and your chances of injury</p>
<p>are very low, again, both acute injury</p>
<p>as well as long-term injury,</p>
<p>which is just sort of like my joints ache</p>
<p>and all of a sudden my shoulder hurts</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p>And once you&rsquo;re clear there, you can train pretty hard.</p>
<p>I really like this because recently</p>
<p>I was showing somebody how to use a,</p>
<p>in this case, it was a hack squat machine.</p>
<p>I noticed that they were very timid</p>
<p>of getting into a deep squat position.</p>
<p>And they cited a previous knee injury,</p>
<p>which has long since healed.</p>
<p>But even with proper foot placement and everything,</p>
<p>you just tell they were getting ginger about it</p>
<p>as they approached that bottom position.</p>
<p>But over time with pauses at the bottom,</p>
<p>they become very comfortable</p>
<p>and now actually are going well below 90 degrees</p>
<p>angle between femur and lower leg.</p>
<p>So it was clear that it wasn&rsquo;t something,</p>
<p>range of motion limited, or it was just,</p>
<p>it was a mental thing, but a logical one for them.</p>
<p>Now, after what you just said,</p>
<p>I think a better strategy that I could have used</p>
<p>would have been to have them get into that position,</p>
<p>just no weight at all, maybe nothing on the sled,</p>
<p>and then slowly working up from there</p>
<p>as opposed to doing what we did in our case,</p>
<p>which was to just convince them</p>
<p>that they were much stronger than they thought they were.</p>
<p>We eventually got there,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m realizing that there was far too much</p>
<p>mental anguish involved in that process.</p>
<p>Yeah, this whole progression, by the way,</p>
<p>this can all happen in one session.</p>
<p>If you can check the boxes, like in that example,</p>
<p>you may have been fine to jump there.</p>
<p>It may have just been a, hey, you&rsquo;re fine here,</p>
<p>get through it, oh, okay.</p>
<p>This whole progression might take two years.</p>
<p>I mean, this really depends on your background,</p>
<p>if you actually have injury history,</p>
<p>your comfort, your confidence, like all these things.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need to worry</p>
<p>about rushing through that progression.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even need to get all the way to the end</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t want to, especially with speed</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>But again, it can happen.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be like, well, it&rsquo;s a month of this,</p>
<p>a month, like, but no, if they feel great</p>
<p>and you can go through one to seven in five minutes,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<p>Number six.</p>
<p>Number six now is just order.</p>
<p>So you know how many days per week you&rsquo;re gonna work out.</p>
<p>You know how long they&rsquo;re going to take.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve selected all the exercises you need to get done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve balanced that across the week.</p>
<p>Now you just need to put them in order.</p>
<p>And the easy answer here is generally</p>
<p>do what&rsquo;s most important first in the workout.</p>
<p>There is some minor interference effect</p>
<p>or some other things there, but the reality of it is</p>
<p>if you do the priority first,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to be okay.</p>
<p>So whether this priority is a muscle group,</p>
<p>so in the example,</p>
<p>you want to make sure your glutes get trained.</p>
<p>Maybe do it first.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to maximize your back squat,</p>
<p>you may not want to do a bunch of glute exercises</p>
<p>to fatigue first, but that&rsquo;s not the priority we picked.</p>
<p>We picked a different one, which is buckets A, B, and C.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>By doing it first, you told me the priority</p>
<p>was to make sure I do something for my glutes.</p>
<p>And then I would also like to get my back squat</p>
<p>a little bit stronger or whatever.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>The same thing could be done for your endurance training.</p>
<p>You could do your endurance training before you&rsquo;re lifting</p>
<p>if you understand that that means</p>
<p>you might be compromising your lifting quality</p>
<p>of the workout a little bit.</p>
<p>But you might be fine with that</p>
<p>if you say the endurance work is more important right now.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know the answer to that though</p>
<p>if you hadn&rsquo;t gone through steps one through four.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why those things are critical.</p>
<p>So it makes what we call chaos management,</p>
<p>which is things happen in the moment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>What should I choose?</p>
<p>That decision becomes really clear</p>
<p>because you can always go back to the beginning</p>
<p>and go, my priority was this.</p>
<p>Then therefore, that&rsquo;s my choice today.</p>
<p>So it provides a very simple set of instructions</p>
<p>for when the workout gets cut short,</p>
<p>when your workout has to be in a hotel</p>
<p>and any number of things that pop up in real life,</p>
<p>whether again, you&rsquo;re an athlete or non-athlete,</p>
<p>either way, life will get in the way at some point.</p>
<p>So you need to have rules and a system that says,</p>
<p>when this happens, I go right back to this</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s my choice.</p>
<p>Done, I&rsquo;m moving on.</p>
<p>No decision to make here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already been determined a week ago, five weeks ago.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re off and rolling.</p>
<p>So the order again is pretty simple.</p>
<p>Just put the one that is most important first.</p>
<p>Now I know you like to do legs on Monday.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I actually love that too.</p>
<p>I do the same thing generally</p>
<p>because to me that&rsquo;s almost always the most important thing.</p>
<p>If I miss a bicep workout, I&rsquo;m probably fine,</p>
<p>but I really don&rsquo;t like missing the big movement pattern.</p>
<p>So I make sure that those happen on a day</p>
<p>that tend to be more stable for me.</p>
<p>Mondays are generally pretty stable.</p>
<p>Things get chaotic as the week moves along for me.</p>
<p>Others might be the opposite, right?</p>
<p>Others might wanna go,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m actually gonna keep Monday as my flexible day</p>
<p>or off day because I like to get a lot of my work done,</p>
<p>get that cleared so I can have,</p>
<p>oh, sure, like working around you.</p>
<p>Some people love to train on Saturdays</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s their most free.</p>
<p>Some people hate it.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You tell me what is the biggest priority</p>
<p>and when are you the most fresh?</p>
<p>Monday, Tuesday, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Depends on your work schedule.</p>
<p>Maybe you work the weekends.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>You decide what day of the week</p>
<p>are you generally the most consistent,</p>
<p>the most consistent schedule</p>
<p>and the most consistent energy</p>
<p>and do the thing that is most important on that day.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter Monday, Tuesday, day one, day three.</p>
<p>We were sort of talking about this earlier,</p>
<p>but you actually don&rsquo;t even have to do a week schedule.</p>
<p>Our brains tend to like to go year, month, week,</p>
<p>but a lot of folks will even just run this thing</p>
<p>in terms of like a seven or nine day schedule.</p>
<p>In fact, we ran a nine day training schedule</p>
<p>for one of my major league baseball players</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s eight or so years into his career</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s hitting all time PRs in velocity.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s very, very good.</p>
<p>And it was a nine day training cycle</p>
<p>and we ran that for the entire season.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a seven day split,</p>
<p>but it tends to work for a lot of people</p>
<p>because most people have a fairly consistent schedule</p>
<p>across the seven days.</p>
<p>So pick the thing that is most important,</p>
<p>do it first and do it on the day of the week</p>
<p>that is most consistent for you</p>
<p>in terms of schedule and energy.</p>
<p>I really like what you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>I should just say that one of the reasons</p>
<p>I put legs on Monday is because I tend to get enough sleep</p>
<p>on the weekends.</p>
<p>I generally get enough sleep during the middle of the week,</p>
<p>but oftentimes things will come up.</p>
<p>I can be pretty sure, however,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve quote unquote caught up on my sleep</p>
<p>on the weekends.</p>
<p>This notion of catching up on sleep</p>
<p>is a little dicey scientifically,</p>
<p>but I tend to be pretty rested by Monday morning.</p>
<p>And actually my week begins on Sunday</p>
<p>and Sundays are when I get my long form cardio.</p>
<p>So those two are really non-negotiable.</p>
<p>And the reason that long form cardio is on Sunday</p>
<p>is that it can take many different forms.</p>
<p>It can take a hike with a weighted vest,</p>
<p>it can take the form of a jog,</p>
<p>it can be done with other people,</p>
<p>it can be family time,</p>
<p>it can be time with friends and so on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty hard to do during the middle of the week</p>
<p>or pretty hard to ensure, at least for me.</p>
<p>I also find that by bookending the week</p>
<p>with some non-negotiable days of training on Sunday, Monday,</p>
<p>then if the week gets busy Tuesday, Wednesday,</p>
<p>or even sometimes Thursday with travel</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>one can sort of catch up toward the weekend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ideal.</p>
<p>I mean, ideally it&rsquo;s spaced out,</p>
<p>but really this isn&rsquo;t about what I do.</p>
<p>This is really just to underscore</p>
<p>the principle you described,</p>
<p>which is I have a very clear sense now</p>
<p>over three decades or so of training</p>
<p>and three decades or so of being involved</p>
<p>in academics and science and work</p>
<p>of when I tend to be most rested,</p>
<p>when I tend to have some flexibility in my schedule</p>
<p>and also when I&rsquo;m trying to combine fitness</p>
<p>with some of my social engagements,</p>
<p>which is actually quite fun.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed is that the four boxes</p>
<p>that you mentioned before,</p>
<p>work, relationships, fitness, and recovery,</p>
<p>some of them do have some crossover.</p>
<p>They all do.</p>
<p>A hike with family or friends</p>
<p>is both relationship and fitness and so on.</p>
<p>But I love the principle</p>
<p>because anything that can add consistency,</p>
<p>as you pointed it out,</p>
<p>is going to greatly increase the probability</p>
<p>of reaching one&rsquo;s goals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of an obvious one.</p>
<p>But in an earlier episode,</p>
<p>you also said something that I wrote down</p>
<p>and is really still ringing in my mind,</p>
<p>especially now,</p>
<p>which is that consistency always beats intensity.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>We used to do a thing</p>
<p>when I was training NFL players</p>
<p>for the combine many years ago,</p>
<p>where Saturdays were supposed to be the day they came in</p>
<p>and we did the most regeneration.</p>
<p>So this is when they get body work done</p>
<p>and we do hot, cold contrast</p>
<p>and sort of all these things.</p>
<p>And our attendance was like 1%.</p>
<p>Nobody showed up.</p>
<p>For a massage?</p>
<p>Nobody showed up.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Seems right, but remember.</p>
<p>I love a good massage.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>But remember, you&rsquo;re 18 years old.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re likely to be getting millions of dollars</p>
<p>handed to you in the next few weeks or months.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not referring to me, by the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually quite a bit older than 18.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not getting handed millions of dollars each week.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I would think that.</p>
<p>But those folks, they recover super fast.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never really had that.</p>
<p>And also, Friday night?</p>
<p>Kind of enticing.</p>
<p>And so nothing was there.</p>
<p>And the strategy then was,</p>
<p>what if we, instead of having</p>
<p>a important, hard training day on Saturday,</p>
<p>we transition and it is only things they want to do.</p>
<p>So we basically identified,</p>
<p>what are the things in training you love the most?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s do those Saturdays.</p>
<p>And it turns out for those folks, no surprise here,</p>
<p>it was what we called the gun show.</p>
<p>So they would come into the gym</p>
<p>and we would literally do nothing but biceps and triceps.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d just get a pump.</p>
<p>And then the deal was though,</p>
<p>you come in and literally what would come in</p>
<p>is we would pick three guys.</p>
<p>Say you, you, and you.</p>
<p>You pick your favorite bicep exercise.</p>
<p>You pick your favorite one.</p>
<p>You pick your favorite one.</p>
<p>You three over there,</p>
<p>you pick your favorite tricep, tricep, tricep.</p>
<p>And we just run a big circuit.</p>
<p>Like how many reps?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how many sets.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even care.</p>
<p>Just like pump away.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t even care, right?</p>
<p>We chose small muscle groups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really gonna interfere with much.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re training them for the NFL Combine,</p>
<p>which is like, it&rsquo;s not a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s legs performance basically, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, if they smash their biceps and triceps</p>
<p>on a Saturday, it&rsquo;s not gonna influence</p>
<p>what we did on Monday.</p>
<p>So recovery wasn&rsquo;t an issue.</p>
<p>Once we finished the gun show though,</p>
<p>now you have to go do your regen stuff.</p>
<p>So if you need chiro work, you need physical therapy,</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>So we would get them in the building</p>
<p>with the low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>And then we would actually get them to do their work.</p>
<p>You can do the same thing.</p>
<p>And I honestly do the same thing.</p>
<p>I tend to do either,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m gonna do an upper or lower split,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do that stuff either Friday night or Saturday.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s very difficult for me</p>
<p>to do a hard long workout Friday night, right?</p>
<p>Or even Friday morning for that matter.</p>
<p>The same thing Saturday.</p>
<p>I wake up and now it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s family mode.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kid things.</p>
<p>I wanna do stuff.</p>
<p>Man, but I can usually convince myself to be like,</p>
<p>all right, just go in there and go 20 minutes</p>
<p>and get your upper body stuff done.</p>
<p>All right, I can walk myself into that mentally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder to walk yourself</p>
<p>into your five sets of five deadlift.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of just like, whoa,</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t got that in me right now.</p>
<p>My high intensity intervals, the max of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that right now.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll either go for my long steady state stuff,</p>
<p>which is like, I&rsquo;m going on the bike,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m riding down to the beach,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re coming back nasal only.</p>
<p>I can get myself to go for a bike ride like that,</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>So I pick the thing that I&rsquo;m likely to do on the days</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m probably gonna be my weakest quote unquote,</p>
<p>not physically, but motivation wise.</p>
<p>For a long time, I tried to like,</p>
<p>it just got stuck in a way</p>
<p>where my hardest stuff was Friday nights.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, why am I doing this?</p>
<p>I was having like a 50% success rate,</p>
<p>just like we were having like a no percent success rate</p>
<p>with the NFL guys on Saturday.</p>
<p>So you have to be a little bit tough.</p>
<p>You have to grind sometimes,</p>
<p>you have to get some motivation and go after it.</p>
<p>But you also have to be like,</p>
<p>well, this is just stupid planning, right?</p>
<p>Like why put yourself in a position</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just failing over and over and over</p>
<p>when I could move it and go, look,</p>
<p>those sessions are going to be things that are easier.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t require as much gusto to get up</p>
<p>and get them done.</p>
<p>I get those things done 90% of the time.</p>
<p>Cause the worst case I can be like,</p>
<p>all right, we&rsquo;re gonna go do a family thing.</p>
<p>Give me 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna run up there and smash upper body.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t need, I don&rsquo;t need a 20 minute warmup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I can just kind of jump into those things</p>
<p>if I had to, if I feel great,</p>
<p>then I can still go do something else</p>
<p>or I can do more, I can do a longer session.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re sort of immune to any situation.</p>
<p>So I would book in those, I guess is what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the day you&rsquo;re gonna have the best day?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the day you generally have the worst?</p>
<p>And put the programs around those situations.</p>
<p>I love the idea of identifying the friction points,</p>
<p>the high friction and low friction days.</p>
<p>Friction, meaning anything that impedes you</p>
<p>from training consistently or well.</p>
<p>And there are so many factors that ratchet into that.</p>
<p>Sleep, other social engagements, work.</p>
<p>You know, Friday night, I also find it tough</p>
<p>to do any kind of training.</p>
<p>I do cardiovascular training.</p>
<p>I do interval type training on Fridays typically,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of cumulative fatigue and stress</p>
<p>that happens across the week.</p>
<p>And usually for a long time, gosh, more than a decade now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been telling myself that Saturday is the day</p>
<p>that I try to reduce my cortisol</p>
<p>as much as possible from the week.</p>
<p>And then Sunday is the day that I enjoy</p>
<p>that low cortisol state.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually what opened up into the long, slow run.</p>
<p>I actually like to think of myself as a bit of a mule</p>
<p>during those long runs.</p>
<p>I actually have a shirt that has a sloth on it</p>
<p>that I wear to remind myself to go slowly on those runs.</p>
<p>Not that I ever run that fast,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the whole mindset around it</p>
<p>is to be a bit of a mule, just kind of moving through it.</p>
<p>And the fatigue factor is more one of,</p>
<p>you know, at first it&rsquo;s just a little bit of boredom,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;ve noticed there&rsquo;s a whole different set</p>
<p>of mental scapes that open up</p>
<p>under different training types.</p>
<p>And this is maybe something we&rsquo;ll get into</p>
<p>a little bit in a future episode or discussion.</p>
<p>You know, when you train really intensely</p>
<p>for short periods of time, one way,</p>
<p>your mind goes into a particular state.</p>
<p>When you do long duration training,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking and indeed,</p>
<p>even the way it affects sleep patterns</p>
<p>is also very different.</p>
<p>I think one of the great futures for neuroscience</p>
<p>and exercise science and collaboration</p>
<p>is to identify how different patterns of physical movement</p>
<p>relate to different patterns of thinking and vice versa.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s something maybe to just earmark</p>
<p>for a future conversation,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s clearly a relationship there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, when we certainly know</p>
<p>of a pretty clear relationship between</p>
<p>even what we would classify as zone five exercise</p>
<p>and deep sleep.</p>
<p>So zone five, again, being,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re breathing a lot through your mouth</p>
<p>because you have to in order to bring in enough oxygen</p>
<p>to offset the acidity created by the-</p>
<p>The carbon.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the high heart rate.</p>
<p>So, I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to look at it and hit a number,</p>
<p>looking for something like 30 plus minutes a week</p>
<p>being in the top 10% of your heart rate.</p>
<p>That impacts deep sleep.</p>
<p>Is going to positively impact deep sleep</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s done very far away from deep sleep.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to do that at night.</p>
<p>So you want, in terms of time.</p>
<p>So if you hit those numbers earlier in the day,</p>
<p>oftentimes that will enhance deep sleep.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was looking at some papers recently</p>
<p>and the number that kind of emerged from those papers</p>
<p>was that unless it&rsquo;s low intensity exercise,</p>
<p>trying to exercise about six hours or more away</p>
<p>from your sleep time would be ideal.</p>
<p>Now that said, for those of you that have to hit the gym</p>
<p>or go for a run in the evening</p>
<p>and then are trying to fall asleep four to six hours later,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want that statement</p>
<p>to impede your regular exercising.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an easy trick to that.</p>
<p>Just finish it with down regulation breathing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of one of our things that if you,</p>
<p>because that is a realistic situation, right?</p>
<p>Finish work at five or even six</p>
<p>and then by the time you&rsquo;re training or running</p>
<p>or whatever you want to call it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 7.38, you&rsquo;re home at nine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating and then you can&rsquo;t eat two hours before bed.</p>
<p>Pretty soon you run into a number</p>
<p>of different collision points</p>
<p>that make you wonder whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing everything wrong</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s really worth training at all.</p>
<p>And I would argue it&rsquo;s better to train than not to train,</p>
<p>provided that you can still get to sleep.</p>
<p>100%, so you have to walk a little bit of a game.</p>
<p>We run into this issue with the NBA players, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re playing games at six o&rsquo;clock at night to start.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball is a 7.05, 7.10 pitch, right?</p>
<p>And also, by the way,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re changing time zones every five days, right?</p>
<p>UFC fighters and such, we&rsquo;re usually training twice a day.</p>
<p>There is no option to train.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we are training twice a day, always.</p>
<p>So we have to come up with strategies for that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s other non-athlete scenarios, of course,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, there is no other option here, cool.</p>
<p>So what we do is a couple of things.</p>
<p>Number one, the further away you can make it from sleep,</p>
<p>the better, if possible.</p>
<p>We do need to train, though,</p>
<p>around the same time you&rsquo;re going to be playing.</p>
<p>That has to happen.</p>
<p>So the harder and longer we go in the training session,</p>
<p>the harder and longer we go</p>
<p>in our down-regulation post-exercise.</p>
<p>And that is, in my estimation,</p>
<p>the number one lever you can pull that can help, right?</p>
<p>Now, if it really does start crushing sleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to make a critical decision there.</p>
<p>In general, it&rsquo;s not a good reason to not exercise.</p>
<p>But maybe you restrict it to only a couple of days a week,</p>
<p>you go all the way up in intensity,</p>
<p>and the rest of the days, maybe 70%.</p>
<p>You stay in just kind of a working zone.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a longer down-regulation.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s other strategies you can do.</p>
<p>But yeah, you want to be careful of,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve had this situation a number of times</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s sort of just like sleep complaints,</p>
<p>sleep complaints, sleep complaints.</p>
<p>We run full sleep studies on them in their house.</p>
<p>We do the whole thing with absolute rest.</p>
<p>We come in, we do the whole thing,</p>
<p>eye tracking, biomarkers, the whole thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, oh,</p>
<p>you just need to stop doing intervals at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Right, and I would add to that,</p>
<p>another incentive for being able to train</p>
<p>with or without caffeine is that it&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>that even if you can fall asleep after ingesting caffeine</p>
<p>in the preceding hours,</p>
<p>that caffeine consumed in the, gosh, even 12,</p>
<p>but really eight to 10 hours, four hours prior to bedtime</p>
<p>really disrupts the architecture of sleep.</p>
<p>So if you critically rely on caffeine in order to train,</p>
<p>whatever your training might be,</p>
<p>and you know that sleep is important for recovery,</p>
<p>well, then it&rsquo;s pretty obvious where I&rsquo;m going with this.</p>
<p>So having that flexibility is vitally important.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve probably also covered this,</p>
<p>but you can actually measure that directly.</p>
<p>So by eye tracking patterns,</p>
<p>you can actually identify the effects</p>
<p>that caffeine has on sleep,</p>
<p>independent of a sleep time or not.</p>
<p>Right, there are never positive effects.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>That said, I am a proponent of caffeine early in the day.</p>
<p>And caffeine does have a lot of,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s anti-neurodegenerative,</p>
<p>and as long as you&rsquo;re not getting anxiety,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pro-performance,</p>
<p>both mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>But of course, if you do not need caffeine,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re one of these mutants that do not need caffeine</p>
<p>in order to go about your daily living</p>
<p>with focus and intensity,</p>
<p>then by all means, don&rsquo;t start taking caffeine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the hugest fan.</p>
<p>I am scientifically, 100% of the board.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t do well on it.</p>
<p>Well, you seem to ride a little bit more</p>
<p>of what we would call sympathetic tone,</p>
<p>kind of shifted towards more alert.</p>
<p>I tend to be naturally a bit more</p>
<p>like my bulldog Costello was,</p>
<p>a little bit more on the mellow, sleepy side,</p>
<p>and caffeine just puts me right at that alert,</p>
<p>but calm place.</p>
<p>And I can get away with drinking,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say ridiculous,</p>
<p>but a fair amount of caffeine and remain there.</p>
<p>But I do restrict it until the time right up about 2 p.m.</p>
<p>at the latest is really when I&rsquo;m trying to drink caffeine.</p>
<p>Number seven.</p>
<p>Great, so number seven and eight are pretty simple.</p>
<p>This is now choose the intensity and the volume.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve discussed those at length</p>
<p>in the previous episodes.</p>
<p>We probably don&rsquo;t have the time to go back</p>
<p>over all those details.</p>
<p>So, remember the adaptation you&rsquo;re training for</p>
<p>and pick the appropriate rep range,</p>
<p>total amount of sets,</p>
<p>as well as the intensity</p>
<p>to then get the corresponding adaptation, right?</p>
<p>All you have to do is select those things.</p>
<p>In terms of progression through a week,</p>
<p>the rule of thumb we say for intensity</p>
<p>is something around 3% per week, right?</p>
<p>For volume, it will depend</p>
<p>on what you&rsquo;re doing a little bit,</p>
<p>but anytime you cross more than 10% per week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start running into problems.</p>
<p>So, I like 5% better.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need to be as low as three.</p>
<p>You can jump up much more than that.</p>
<p>Five to 7% is better.</p>
<p>So, if you are doing, say, running,</p>
<p>because the numbers make it easy,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing 10 miles per week total.</p>
<p>If you were to go up to 11 miles the next week,</p>
<p>great, you&rsquo;re right around 10%.</p>
<p>But what you wouldn&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>is say I&rsquo;m running 10 miles this week,</p>
<p>and I did maybe four Monday, three Wednesday, three Friday.</p>
<p>So, four, three, and three, you got your 10.</p>
<p>Then you wouldn&rsquo;t want to add a mile every day.</p>
<p>So, Monday, instead of doing four, I did five.</p>
<p>Wednesday, instead of doing three, I did four.</p>
<p>Friday, instead of doing three, I did four.</p>
<p>What you actually did is you went from 10 to 13,</p>
<p>which is a much higher percent jump</p>
<p>than the 10% prescribed.</p>
<p>So, the same thing would be true for lifting weights.</p>
<p>The same thing is actually true for calories</p>
<p>and trying to add them, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, the body tends to not handle those things as well,</p>
<p>jumping more than 10% per week.</p>
<p>So, keeping with this idea</p>
<p>of increasing progressive overload,</p>
<p>being 10% more over some period of time,</p>
<p>am I correct in assuming that I want to identify</p>
<p>one, maybe two meaningful variables</p>
<p>and progressing that or those variables?</p>
<p>So, progressive overload can come in the form</p>
<p>of any of the modifiable variables.</p>
<p>So, you could increase the complexity of the movement.</p>
<p>You could increase the intensity or the load.</p>
<p>You can increase the volume by either more sets,</p>
<p>more reps, or more total exercises in a day.</p>
<p>What about time under tension?</p>
<p>You could also manipulate the tempo of each repetition.</p>
<p>You could also manipulate how many times per day you train.</p>
<p>So, you can manipulate frequency.</p>
<p>You can also manipulate rest intervals.</p>
<p>So, you can progressively load any of these things.</p>
<p>Increase intensity, run a little bit faster,</p>
<p>complete the same amount of work slightly faster,</p>
<p>put 5% more on the barbell or the load</p>
<p>or the handle or whatever you&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a simple way.</p>
<p>If you want to think about volume,</p>
<p>in the case of endurance work, it&rsquo;s simple,</p>
<p>mileage, time, whatever.</p>
<p>In the case of lifting, all you have to do</p>
<p>is take the amount of repetitions you&rsquo;re doing per set,</p>
<p>multiply it by the sets, add that all up.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re doing three sets of 10, that&rsquo;s 30 repetitions.</p>
<p>If you did three exercises, you just did 90 repetitions.</p>
<p>Put that number down for Monday.</p>
<p>Put that number down for Wednesday.</p>
<p>Put that number down for Friday.</p>
<p>Add that total up.</p>
<p>So, say you did 90, 90, 90.</p>
<p>You would look and say,</p>
<p>my total number of repetitions this week is 270.</p>
<p>If I want to go up 5%,</p>
<p>then I need to go up another 15 or so total repetitions.</p>
<p>Great, that&rsquo;s all we have to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the increase.</p>
<p>You may keep the load exactly the same,</p>
<p>keep the exercises the same chain, nothing else,</p>
<p>but you want to add 15 more total reps for your week.</p>
<p>And you may choose to do that</p>
<p>by adding one more repetition per set.</p>
<p>Close enough.</p>
<p>So, last week I did three sets of 10.</p>
<p>This week I&rsquo;m going to three sets of 11.</p>
<p>It can be as simple as that.</p>
<p>Again, it can be complex.</p>
<p>I walked you through.</p>
<p>It can be any of the modifiable variables,</p>
<p>but the progression I just laid out is fairly simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s honestly the one I recommend for most people</p>
<p>just because it will avoid confusion</p>
<p>and it will avoid people taking massive leaps in volume.</p>
<p>So, the typical strategy I would recommend here</p>
<p>is increasing load or intensity</p>
<p>or a little bit of a combination</p>
<p>slowly for about six or so weeks</p>
<p>and then taking what we generally call a deload.</p>
<p>So, back down to maybe 70%.</p>
<p>Whatever that number is you&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>So, you did three sets of 10</p>
<p>and you worked yourself all the way up to three sets of 15.</p>
<p>Back that down and maybe we&rsquo;ll do two sets of eight</p>
<p>for the week.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll come back the following week</p>
<p>and go back and do the highest we&rsquo;ve done now</p>
<p>where all of a sudden we&rsquo;re going to do four sets of 12</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So, if you get these little deloads every,</p>
<p>depending on what you&rsquo;re doing, four to eight weeks or so,</p>
<p>you should be in a spot where you can continually progress</p>
<p>for a very long time without either burning out</p>
<p>or overloading and overstressing an injury pattern.</p>
<p>So, the simple way, pick intensity or volume</p>
<p>and just go up slightly every week</p>
<p>for a short span of time, generally around six weeks.</p>
<p>And then you come back and change your strategy</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>Because you mentioned sets and repetitions here,</p>
<p>just wanted to remind folks that in the episode</p>
<p>that we did on strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>and that also included speed,</p>
<p>there was a description of a terrific program for strength,</p>
<p>which is the three-by-five program</p>
<p>or three-to-five program as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>which is to select three to five exercises</p>
<p>performed for three to five repetitions,</p>
<p>three to five times per week with three to five minutes rest</p>
<p>in between those exercises.</p>
<p>For three to five sets.</p>
<p>And if I recall correctly,</p>
<p>the protocol for generating hypertrophy muscle growth</p>
<p>is to perform a minimum of 10</p>
<p>and probably more like 15 to 20 sets</p>
<p>per muscle group per week.</p>
<p>And that can be done in a single session</p>
<p>per muscle per week.</p>
<p>So one could train for instance,</p>
<p>quadriceps one day per week,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re getting that volume of sets per week,</p>
<p>or it could be divided up across two</p>
<p>or three different sessions</p>
<p>for that individual muscle group.</p>
<p>Of course, people are going to target</p>
<p>all their major muscle groups</p>
<p>and hopefully some of them minor muscle groups as well.</p>
<p>And as I recall, the number of repetitions</p>
<p>that can generate hypertrophy is quite broad,</p>
<p>anywhere from six repetitions</p>
<p>all the way up to 30 repetitions.</p>
<p>But by the end of the set,</p>
<p>it should be to failure or close to failure with good form.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, and we would say close to failure</p>
<p>is probably most appropriate.</p>
<p>You can actually reach failure</p>
<p>maybe on a few of the sets, maybe the end.</p>
<p>And probably best to choose that</p>
<p>with the exercises that are safer.</p>
<p>Not that any exercise is particularly unsafe</p>
<p>if you do it appropriately,</p>
<p>but you may not want to go to true failure on every set</p>
<p>for the more complex, larger, riskier exercises.</p>
<p>So pretty close to failure, but not all the way.</p>
<p>And I realized I forgot to mention</p>
<p>rest intervals between sets.</p>
<p>It follows that if a large range of repetitions are performed</p>
<p>that a large range of rest intervals are allowed,</p>
<p>meaning there could be rest intervals</p>
<p>between sets of as low as 30 seconds between sets</p>
<p>or as high as two or three minutes,</p>
<p>depending on the loads that one is using.</p>
<p>And that of course will scale with the number of repetitions.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>In fact, that sort of leads me into step number nine</p>
<p>of designing your own training program,</p>
<p>which is you&rsquo;ve decided our goal,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve worked our calendar out,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve figured out how many days per week</p>
<p>and how long we&rsquo;re going to work out in those sessions.</p>
<p>We then went and selected our exercises.</p>
<p>We balanced them across the movement patterns</p>
<p>and the muscle groups that we need</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re not causing excess of stress</p>
<p>on the same exact joint or muscle group over time.</p>
<p>We then ordered our exercises based on priority.</p>
<p>Because of that, we have identified our goal.</p>
<p>We went back and we selected the volume,</p>
<p>which is the repetitions per set,</p>
<p>the total amount of sets and the load per set</p>
<p>that matched the goal that we wanted to get</p>
<p>or the adaptation.</p>
<p>Now all we have to do is fill in the rest intervals,</p>
<p>which reflect back again, the goal.</p>
<p>So generally higher rest intervals,</p>
<p>which means time that you rest between your sets,</p>
<p>higher, somewhere between two to five minutes</p>
<p>for things like speed, power and strength,</p>
<p>perhaps a little bit lower,</p>
<p>although as you mentioned,</p>
<p>it could also stay high for hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And then for endurance, you follow the rest interval</p>
<p>that reflects the type of endurance training</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d like to get.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s walked us through one through nine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost done.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve put together a pretty nice little protocol.</p>
<p>It should be well-rounded.</p>
<p>It should be effective.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also talked about how to progress it</p>
<p>from week to week,</p>
<p>keeping it within again, four to six weeks,</p>
<p>maybe up to eight before we then take a back off.</p>
<p>The very last thing we have to do</p>
<p>to make sure this training program</p>
<p>is customized to you, your goal and your situation,</p>
<p>which is then going to enhance your likelihood of adherence</p>
<p>and consistency,</p>
<p>as well as increase the likelihood of effectiveness,</p>
<p>is we just have to do a little bit</p>
<p>of what we call chaos management,</p>
<p>which is take a quick moment to think through,</p>
<p>this program looks great,</p>
<p>but if I had to nitpick it,</p>
<p>where are the possible chances of failure?</p>
<p>And you just wanna sort of think about</p>
<p>where would I predict things would go wrong?</p>
<p>And if anything pops out to you,</p>
<p>try to come up with your solution at the beginning.</p>
<p>And this could be a number of things.</p>
<p>So maybe you&rsquo;ve picked an exercise</p>
<p>and you realize, man,</p>
<p>I really actually don&rsquo;t like that exercise.</p>
<p>Or maybe you look at the schedule now</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s laid out in front of you.</p>
<p>You look at your work schedule and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>ah, maybe that&rsquo;s a bit aggressive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It could be any number of things,</p>
<p>but it is a useful exercise</p>
<p>to just think through everything realistically.</p>
<p>I typically just like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the adage I teach my graduate students,</p>
<p>before we hit submit, we&rsquo;re gonna sleep.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s ready.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna take 12 hours.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna wake up the next day,</p>
<p>look at it again and go,</p>
<p>are we sure we&rsquo;re good here?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Make adjustments if you need.</p>
<p>If not, if you feel confident,</p>
<p>then hit send and cross your fingers.</p>
<p>Yeah, we were referring to submitting the manuscript.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting you say that.</p>
<p>I have a statement that I always make to people in my lab.</p>
<p>They hit submit.</p>
<p>And I always say that you realize</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna wake up tomorrow morning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be an email in your inbox</p>
<p>that something was formatted incorrectly</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to spend tomorrow reformatting</p>
<p>and submitting again.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve also learned that every project</p>
<p>is actually two projects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m trying to not die over here</p>
<p>and interrupt you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this enough times.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve done this many dozens of times.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also another truism of science,</p>
<p>which is that there&rsquo;s the project,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the scientific question,</p>
<p>and then the paper is yet another project.</p>
<p>And I actually think this is an analogy</p>
<p>that carries over to other domains of life.</p>
<p>I think that anytime we take on something,</p>
<p>if we want to write a book, or we want to get a degree,</p>
<p>or we want a fitness program,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth thinking about those decisions</p>
<p>as actually taking on two major things.</p>
<p>Because one is the planning and organization</p>
<p>around that thing,</p>
<p>and the other is the actual performance of the thing.</p>
<p>And so I say that because here,</p>
<p>what you just described,</p>
<p>this 10 steps to consider in designing a program.</p>
<p>I think some people who are real list makers</p>
<p>and love the precision and the thoroughness,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m one of these people thinking, this is great,</p>
<p>I just want to check off each one of these things</p>
<p>on the list and figure out the ideal program for me</p>
<p>for a given period of time, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then other folks might be thinking,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s a lot, that&rsquo;s just a lot to do.</p>
<p>But what I know with certainty</p>
<p>is that performing those sorts of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call them what they are,</p>
<p>those tasks of figuring out what&rsquo;s what,</p>
<p>where the defenders are, et cetera,</p>
<p>without question makes everything go so much more smoothly</p>
<p>once you are into the actual performance,</p>
<p>the action of doing the exercise program,</p>
<p>or the book, or the podcast,</p>
<p>or whatever it is that you happen to do.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m grateful that you brought up</p>
<p>both the things that act as conduits</p>
<p>for getting good work done,</p>
<p>and this notion of defenders and bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Because if we don&rsquo;t consider those,</p>
<p>I would argue that it&rsquo;s a very low probability</p>
<p>that anyone will succeed.</p>
<p>But when one does consider those, even just a few of them,</p>
<p>I think the probability of success</p>
<p>goes way, way up immediately.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a very good point.</p>
<p>That is a lot of work for a lot of people.</p>
<p>And I know when I&rsquo;m consuming information,</p>
<p>it is helpful to hear structure and systems and design.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also helpful to hear actual real-life examples.</p>
<p>So maybe the next thing we can do here</p>
<p>is I can just walk you through an entire setup</p>
<p>and a program,</p>
<p>considering folks that are in bucket A, B, and C.</p>
<p>And maybe I&rsquo;ll save a little bit of the explanation</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll eliminate maybe some background,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just walk you through what this could look like.</p>
<p>All right, so I created a program</p>
<p>which should run about a year.</p>
<p>And the idea here is that this could be</p>
<p>an evergreen system.</p>
<p>So one could check off all the boxes</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>So in general, we wanna have three primary goals</p>
<p>with exercise.</p>
<p>We wanna look a certain way,</p>
<p>whatever that means to you.</p>
<p>We wanna be able to perform a certain way,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s for life goals like hiking and energy</p>
<p>or sport goals or whatever.</p>
<p>And then we wanna be able to do that across our lifespan.</p>
<p>Okay, so a program that gives you</p>
<p>all the goals we talked about.</p>
<p>And a program that covers that health combine</p>
<p>that we referred to way back</p>
<p>in some of our earlier discussions,</p>
<p>which as a little bit of a recap is,</p>
<p>what are the physical fitness parameters</p>
<p>that we know are critical to maintaining</p>
<p>both lifespan and wellness span?</p>
<p>And as a bit of a reminder,</p>
<p>those are things like your grip strength,</p>
<p>your leg strength,</p>
<p>your total amount of muscle mass,</p>
<p>your actual speed and power</p>
<p>so that you can catch yourself from a fall,</p>
<p>your VO2 max and your physical fitness.</p>
<p>So I wanna program that does a little bit of all that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s similar actually,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re kind of crossing barriers between our three buckets</p>
<p>so I need to be able to control my fat.</p>
<p>I need to be able to have enough muscle.</p>
<p>That muscle needs to have enough function</p>
<p>and I need to be able to maintain range of motion</p>
<p>so that I don&rsquo;t lose flexibility and get hurt.</p>
<p>And then I need to have a good VO2 max</p>
<p>as well as to be able to sustain energy over time.</p>
<p>So that was the goal of my progress.</p>
<p>Now, a couple of other things that we haven&rsquo;t chatted about,</p>
<p>which are very important.</p>
<p>You have mentioned, I think on a previous podcast</p>
<p>about the importance of seeing light.</p>
<p>Is this something you&rsquo;ve covered at one point or another?</p>
<p>I joke that I&rsquo;ll be going into the grave</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be shoveling dirt onto me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be telling people what I&rsquo;ll tell you again now,</p>
<p>which is to get five to 30 minutes of sunlight viewing</p>
<p>as early in the day as possible,</p>
<p>ideally from sunlight,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called sunlight,</p>
<p>or from bright lights of another kind</p>
<p>if you cannot get sunlight.</p>
<p>And also get that in the evening</p>
<p>and then avoid bright lights</p>
<p>between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
<p>unless you do shift work,</p>
<p>in which case check out our episode on shift work.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a little bit of a juxtaposition</p>
<p>where people are like,</p>
<p>I need to work out and do all this training,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;m also supposed to be outside.</p>
<p>Okay, how do I blend those two things</p>
<p>into my training program?</p>
<p>Cool, so I checked that box as well.</p>
<p>I built that in.</p>
<p>The last thing here is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about structured exercise</p>
<p>and just in this episode,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve really opened up and do non-structured exercise,</p>
<p>hiking, sports, things like that.</p>
<p>Well, one thing that is incredibly clear</p>
<p>and my colleague and friend, Tommy Wood</p>
<p>at the University of Washington</p>
<p>published a fantastic paper very recently</p>
<p>on the importance of proprioception</p>
<p>in maintaining and staving off</p>
<p>late onset dementia and Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Maybe just remind people what proprioception is.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s structured exercise and that&rsquo;s very important,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s also things like balance and coordination</p>
<p>and proprioception,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re adjusting to stimuli</p>
<p>coming in from the outside world.</p>
<p>So this stimuli could be sound,</p>
<p>could be light, could be smell,</p>
<p>or in the physical case of the body,</p>
<p>it is where you are at in space.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m feeling like I&rsquo;m falling to the left,</p>
<p>therefore I need to correct and move back to the right.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t get this with doing things</p>
<p>like a hack squat on a machine.</p>
<p>You get this typically from being outside.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re smelling and seeing things</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re also not landing with your foot</p>
<p>in the exact same position on an even platform.</p>
<p>We get this from things like sport.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not only exercising,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m reacting to the outside world.</p>
<p>The ball&rsquo;s going over here,</p>
<p>my opponent&rsquo;s going over there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important in my opinion</p>
<p>to have at least one session per week of exercise</p>
<p>in which you are doing something</p>
<p>that challenges proprioception, right?</p>
<p>So how do I fold all of these best practices</p>
<p>into one training program</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not 200 hours a week, seven days a week?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve laid out to you.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>Cool, let me walk you through it</p>
<p>and then maybe we&rsquo;ll come back</p>
<p>into each individual category</p>
<p>and you can ask questions about them.</p>
<p>So the way that I think is best is to have a goal</p>
<p>and have that goal be around eight to 10 weeks long</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>So what I gave you is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start off with quarter number one of the year.</p>
<p>So perhaps January through March or so,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this one,</p>
<p>but just as an example,</p>
<p>you decide your goal is gonna be</p>
<p>to put some muscle mass on.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna prioritize adding muscle, okay?</p>
<p>Now within that, you&rsquo;re gonna be bulking up,</p>
<p>adding some muscle,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also going to be sleeping more.</p>
<p>We know we need extra recovery in this session</p>
<p>and we need to go up in calories.</p>
<p>Now this happens to work nice for a couple of reasons,</p>
<p>but in that protocol,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;re gonna do seven days</p>
<p>or seven sessions a week of physical activity.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean seven days,</p>
<p>but maybe those sessions are something like,</p>
<p>I will do one indoor sport.</p>
<p>This could be basketball,</p>
<p>could be any number of things, right?</p>
<p>So I got my sport ticked off and it&rsquo;s indoors, why?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in January to March.</p>
<p>The weather&rsquo;s probably not great for most of the world.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna do as much outside activity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do weights maybe three or four times a week</p>
<p>and then maybe two days a week, I&rsquo;ll go for a long walk.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;ll come back and I&rsquo;ll explain to you</p>
<p>why I made all these individual choices.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna run that for the first quarter.</p>
<p>At the end of this quarter,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna take a deload week.</p>
<p>Now this could be fully off.</p>
<p>Maybe this is when you schedule a vacation.</p>
<p>Maybe this is backing off.</p>
<p>Maybe you just keep your walks in</p>
<p>and you spend the extra time on your family or work</p>
<p>or whatever else you need to do.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve bulked up a little bit.</p>
<p>We spent 12 weeks adding some mass.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re gonna transition into quarter two,</p>
<p>which is where we start to actually get lean.</p>
<p>This is actually a pretty standard bodybuilding template,</p>
<p>which is you put on some mass first</p>
<p>and then you get lean after that.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re gonna get lean from April to June.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna bring calories down a little bit.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re actually gonna play</p>
<p>in a hypocaloric state somewhat.</p>
<p>The days tend to get longer.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna have more time to spend in the sun.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna shift a little bit</p>
<p>from an indoor sport activity,</p>
<p>like the example I said earlier was basketball,</p>
<p>to maybe stand-up paddle boarding</p>
<p>or some other thing</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re actually getting your sport done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re reacting, you&rsquo;re using proprioception,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re getting that sun in there as well</p>
<p>because you have a greater opportunity to actually do so</p>
<p>and the weather probably is gonna cooperate with you</p>
<p>more often than it would in, say, February.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re then maybe gonna pick a fitness or an exercise class,</p>
<p>any number of routines where you&rsquo;re with multiple people.</p>
<p>And then two days a week in addition to that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna maybe lift some weights.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve added some muscle.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve got lean.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually looking pretty good for the summertime.</p>
<p>Hmm, interesting, right?</p>
<p>Quarter three, July to September,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll transition and we&rsquo;ll try to get</p>
<p>into great cardiovascular shape.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll transition more</p>
<p>into some high-intensity interval type of stuff</p>
<p>more frequently.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna maybe stay at maintenance calories now.</p>
<p>We spent a little bit of time hyper,</p>
<p>then we went hypo,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re gonna go back to maintenance and keep along.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna continue to choose some outdoor sports,</p>
<p>but maybe you change it up.</p>
<p>Maybe you keep the same one.</p>
<p>Maybe now we switch it out into golf</p>
<p>or now we pick a pickleball or we play basketball,</p>
<p>but now we just do it outside.</p>
<p>Any number of things you can do, right?</p>
<p>So maybe even we do a couple, change it up.</p>
<p>You do that twice a week.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re spending more time in the sun now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking outside</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re seeing this great weather</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not cooped up in a gym,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re getting your physical fitness in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also going to be aiding in your high intensity</p>
<p>or your interval, your conditioning,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing more stuff like that</p>
<p>rather than lifting in a gym.</p>
<p>And then maybe you&rsquo;re actually gonna do some track workouts.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll do this on a bike</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;ll do some hill sprints outside,</p>
<p>any number of things.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll do that maybe twice a week.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll still lift weights twice a week in our gym.</p>
<p>The last quarter then is gonna be October to December</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna transition there</p>
<p>and do more pure cardiovascular fitness, okay?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re doing that, we&rsquo;re gonna be working harder.</p>
<p>And remember, cardiovascular training</p>
<p>is generally expelling much more calories than lifting.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna actually go up in calories.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna return to that.</p>
<p>And that works out kind of well</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know if you know or not,</p>
<p>but people tend to eat a little more calories</p>
<p>from the months of say November through December.</p>
<p>Yeah, holidays and at least in Northern Hemisphere,</p>
<p>colder temperatures.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Maybe even we play with two workouts a day here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to get really in shape.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to improve our conditioning</p>
<p>and our endurance in multiple areas.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna actually transition back into an indoor sport.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;re gonna do some kickboxing</p>
<p>or a jiu-jitsu class or something like that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna maybe hit the cardio machine once or twice.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re hopping on a StairMaster or VersaClimber</p>
<p>or maybe getting an assault bike going,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>Maybe hit some machines and do our lifting there.</p>
<p>Maybe we had spent the rest of the earlier part of the year</p>
<p>on barbells and dumbbells.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll transition to some machines</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll still try to get outside</p>
<p>and walk twice a week, okay?</p>
<p>And that gets us our outside activity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not necessarily a structured program.</p>
<p>So you could, hey, we got 15 minutes</p>
<p>where the weather&rsquo;s breaking a little bit.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s walk, get outside and get a walk in.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the overall structure of everything.</p>
<p>I would like to actually go back to the beginning now</p>
<p>and kind of walk through each one of these things in detail</p>
<p>and explain why I chose certain things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of given some hints already,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;d be helpful to walk back</p>
<p>to the beginning and start there.</p>
<p>Great, I love the overall structure.</p>
<p>I have just a couple of questions.</p>
<p>The idea of training mostly for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>January through March, makes sense,</p>
<p>followed by period from April through June,</p>
<p>focusing primarily on fat loss.</p>
<p>And then from July to September,</p>
<p>speed and interval type work.</p>
<p>And then October to December,</p>
<p>you put to emphasize endurance type training.</p>
<p>I thought for a moment that when we got to October, December</p>
<p>you were going to emphasize strength.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m wondering whether or not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any incentive for training for strength</p>
<p>October, December, so that when one arrives</p>
<p>at the hypertrophy training, January through March,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re that much stronger.</p>
<p>The idea being then there&rsquo;s more muscle to hold on to</p>
<p>as one then tries to lose fat from April through June.</p>
<p>And then July through September is the speed work</p>
<p>or is July through September</p>
<p>the speed slash power phase of the program?</p>
<p>The July through September would be more</p>
<p>like your higher heart rate,</p>
<p>learning to get all the way up,</p>
<p>maximum exertion and then recovery.</p>
<p>And October to December is long form endurance.</p>
<p>Moderate to long form, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s closer to that aerobic capacity stuff.</p>
<p>It is closer to longer duration</p>
<p>and moving through that spectrum.</p>
<p>You are astute in pointing out</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t have pure strength really in there.</p>
<p>You certainly could fold it in,</p>
<p>but quite literally if you spent three months</p>
<p>bulking up in January to March,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna bring some strength along the way.</p>
<p>So you should be fine there,</p>
<p>but you absolutely could alter any of these variables</p>
<p>if you wanted to emphasize something more than other ones.</p>
<p>So say you actually felt like</p>
<p>you ran through the fitness testing</p>
<p>and you identified actually your endurance is pretty good,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re struggling maybe with a little bit of strength</p>
<p>and maybe a little bit of lower muscle mass.</p>
<p>You could substitute quarter three or quarter four</p>
<p>and say one of those quarters will be strength</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll do all of my conditioning in another quarter.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ve really done</p>
<p>is the programming is still fairly simple.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve just altered the priorities a little bit</p>
<p>and therefore you&rsquo;ve altered the adaptation across the year</p>
<p>and why this is really important.</p>
<p>This template is meant to be something</p>
<p>you can just run back year after year after year</p>
<p>and you make a subtle change like that.</p>
<p>And now over the course of five, 10, 20 years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be in a fantastic spot at the end.</p>
<p>So you can make easy adjustments along the way</p>
<p>as priorities pop up, as goals pop up,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to be in a position</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s nothing that&rsquo;s going to be lagging behind.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be in a good spot.</p>
<p>Most of your bases are covered to be pretty lean,</p>
<p>have a good amount of muscle and to be in great shape.</p>
<p>Two other questions.</p>
<p>One, just a quick question,</p>
<p>for sake of generating proprioceptive feedback</p>
<p>during the endurance phase,</p>
<p>is trail running a good option?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Thinking back to days running cross-country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s October, December, you&rsquo;re trail running.</p>
<p>Totally. Training for endurance.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The ground is not super solid,</p>
<p>which is even better in this case, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re making more choices</p>
<p>and trying to not fall on your face.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And then you mentioned bulking up</p>
<p>and I just wanted to highlight</p>
<p>that there are some folks, myself included,</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;d like to add a little bit of muscle here or there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in overeating to the point</p>
<p>where I lay down a lot of body fat stores along with that.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people out there</p>
<p>are not necessarily interested in quote unquote bulking up.</p>
<p>I also, my understanding of the literature,</p>
<p>and tell me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>is that while there does need to be</p>
<p>some sort of caloric surplus</p>
<p>above what is required to maintain body weight</p>
<p>in order to build muscle,</p>
<p>that many people who try and quote unquote bulk up</p>
<p>basically just end up expanding the size</p>
<p>of their cheeks and face</p>
<p>along with their limbs and torso.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not trying to poke fun at them,</p>
<p>but the idea of deliberately overeating</p>
<p>to the point where a lot of body fat stores come along,</p>
<p>I would imagine that would just make the April</p>
<p>through June phase that much harder.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s ever been studied directly,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;s all that,</p>
<p>excuse me, all that healthy</p>
<p>to bring along a lot of adipose tissue</p>
<p>in one&rsquo;s pursuit of hypertrophy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely correct.</p>
<p>We have not gotten into the nutritional details there,</p>
<p>but yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>Good clarification point.</p>
<p>A couple of things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be doing this very long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 12 weeks, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to be six or eight weeks.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t seen me eat.</p>
<p>Number two, just since we&rsquo;re here to clarify,</p>
<p>the literature is ongoing in this area,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s actually a handful of studies</p>
<p>that I know are coming soon.</p>
<p>But in general, when I say hypercaloric here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to increasing caloric intake</p>
<p>above baseline by something like 10 to 15%.</p>
<p>So if you normally eat 2,500 calories throughout the day,</p>
<p>you might add another 250 to 400.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doubling calories.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you to be stuffing your face,</p>
<p>hating food, feeling awful all day,</p>
<p>and then putting on half of your weight as fat</p>
<p>and half of your weight as muscle.</p>
<p>It is just technically hypercaloric</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re eating more,</p>
<p>which is an absolute requirement</p>
<p>for most people to add muscle, right?</p>
<p>Some folks who have a high percentage of body fat</p>
<p>and a low level of fitness training</p>
<p>can actually get away with just</p>
<p>being either isocaloric technically</p>
<p>or even a little bit lower and still adding some muscle</p>
<p>while losing some fat.</p>
<p>But for most folks, that&rsquo;s going to be challenging.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to want to be in a hypercaloric state.</p>
<p>Another reason I put it in here is because remember,</p>
<p>people tend to make these extra calorie choices</p>
<p>during this part of the year anyways.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re sort of playing into life</p>
<p>is why I chose that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, you can&rsquo;t restrict calories all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really hard.</p>
<p>So maybe if we can put calorie restriction</p>
<p>during the phases of the year, that&rsquo;s a little bit easier</p>
<p>and give you the freedom to have a little bit more calories</p>
<p>during the phase of the year</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re probably going to want to do that anyways.</p>
<p>Just make sure you&rsquo;re doing a style of training</p>
<p>that supports that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to be trying to add muscle</p>
<p>when you know you&rsquo;re going to be adding more calories.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be trying to really push the pace</p>
<p>on our conditioning when we know we&rsquo;re going to be eating</p>
<p>more calories anyways.</p>
<p>And so that is actually in fact exactly why I chose</p>
<p>those goals for those times of the year</p>
<p>is because we&rsquo;re now playing into life a little bit more.</p>
<p>But we, again, certainly do not want to be eating</p>
<p>to an excess where it&rsquo;s causing some of the problems</p>
<p>you mentioned.</p>
<p>We want to be eating a little bit more.</p>
<p>The last point here is the next phase, April to June,</p>
<p>we know we&rsquo;re going hypocaloric.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always kind of nice to go,</p>
<p>yep, we&rsquo;re going to go in a little bit</p>
<p>of a calorie deficit here.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really just these few months.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s okay because I&rsquo;ve spent the last six months</p>
<p>where I wasn&rsquo;t restricting that much.</p>
<p>And then one actually where I got to eat a little bit more.</p>
<p>And now, cool, not hard for me to convince somebody</p>
<p>that to go, we&rsquo;re going to bring the calories down right now</p>
<p>or in a month, in two months,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just going to be this 12 or 16 week phase</p>
<p>or whatever you end up being in there.</p>
<p>So those were some of the rationale</p>
<p>that I was thinking of when I decided to do that.</p>
<p>But thank you, that&rsquo;s a very important point</p>
<p>in terms of the hypocaloric.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the dirty bulk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the excess that a lot of folks will do.</p>
<p>And just a final point for folks</p>
<p>in the Southern Hemisphere,</p>
<p>Australians and South Americans,</p>
<p>we actually have a large listenership</p>
<p>in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Of course, adjust accordingly,</p>
<p>even though the holiday months are still</p>
<p>in November, December.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re of course holidays all year long.</p>
<p>Many of the major holidays are around November, December,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s summer down there.</p>
<p>Just adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wholly about</p>
<p>trying to achieve certain adaptations</p>
<p>at certain times of year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about trying to eliminate bottlenecks,</p>
<p>defenders, as you mentioned.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really about the sequence.</p>
<p>So if we go back to that first quarter,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna try to add some mass</p>
<p>for the reasons I just described, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also tends to be pretty motivating.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna start the year off,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna wanna train and get all excited</p>
<p>because of your New Year&rsquo;s resolution,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna see results immediately.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this in some of the previous episodes.</p>
<p>The nice part about hypertrophy training</p>
<p>is you see your muscles growing right now,</p>
<p>where the endurance stuff tends to have</p>
<p>a little bit more of a delayed gratification.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna give you a win early, okay?</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re also gonna be sleeping more</p>
<p>because we know, and maybe we&rsquo;ll get into this</p>
<p>in a future episode,</p>
<p>that sleep is absolutely critical to recovery</p>
<p>and critical to growing muscle mass.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna emphasize sleep</p>
<p>more during this part of the year,</p>
<p>also because the sun is very low.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder to sleep for a lot of folks</p>
<p>longer when the sun is out for longer,</p>
<p>especially if you don&rsquo;t have a perfect blackout.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re just like trying to play</p>
<p>with the restrictions life gives you</p>
<p>and optimize your scenario.</p>
<p>So the sun&rsquo;s probably not out very often,</p>
<p>and especially depending on where you live,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re anywhere like where I grew up</p>
<p>in the Pacific Northwest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be dark and gray and gloomy most of the day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not hard to convince you to go to sleep</p>
<p>a little bit more often.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also, again, why I chose an indoor sport.</p>
<p>That activity, you&rsquo;re gonna not shoot yourself in the foot.</p>
<p>Being in the gym when it&rsquo;s cold and crappy outside</p>
<p>is not that hard to convince yourself to do.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna be lifting your weights,</p>
<p>say four times a week.</p>
<p>And then again, getting some outside time</p>
<p>in the form of a walk</p>
<p>so that you can do it in the middle of work if you have to,</p>
<p>or catching 20 minutes here or there,</p>
<p>whatever it needs to be.</p>
<p>The chances of you missing that walk are little,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll still get some outside time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about the importance of getting sunlight in,</p>
<p>even if it is overcast.</p>
<p>So you can still nail all those boxes</p>
<p>and be in a pretty good spot at the end of that quarter.</p>
<p>Okay, so moving on to quarter two then, April to June.</p>
<p>A lot of people wanna look good during the summer months.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more likely to be outside.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more likely to have your shirt off</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hot,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re either on vacation or going to the beach.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s play into that a little bit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let people look a little bit better,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what they determine to be looking better,</p>
<p>during the months when they&rsquo;re more likely to have that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also more likely to have things like weddings</p>
<p>over the summertime.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t get married often in the winter.</p>
<p>And so people wanna look good for these events.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s play into what a lot of people already want,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s help you get leaner.</p>
<p>Not a lot of holidays that involve eating during that phase.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re not gonna feel like you&rsquo;re missing out</p>
<p>on a ton of life,</p>
<p>outside of maybe a few smaller holidays in that phase.</p>
<p>The days are getting longer.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re gonna choose to get in the sun more often.</p>
<p>We can start getting a tan better.</p>
<p>We can start getting ready for summer.</p>
<p>And so this is why we exchanged our indoor sport</p>
<p>for an outdoor sport, surfing, hiking, cycling outside,</p>
<p>whatever the thing is you wanna do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tons of them, kiteboarding,</p>
<p>like I said, skateboarding, there you go.</p>
<p>You know, start skating a little bit,</p>
<p>whatever it needs to be.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll do that once a week or so.</p>
<p>And then I actually threw in a fitness class here.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One, now it&rsquo;s sort of nice</p>
<p>to take the pressure of programming off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also nice to, if you&rsquo;ve been lifting by yourself,</p>
<p>to get in there and lift with somebody else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also nice to now have some social interaction.</p>
<p>The gamification, the group,</p>
<p>the scoring stuff that happens in fitness classes</p>
<p>is very, very powerful.</p>
<p>It tends to be somewhat fleeting,</p>
<p>so it won&rsquo;t last for a long time for some people,</p>
<p>others it does.</p>
<p>And so if you pepper this thing in</p>
<p>and you know you&rsquo;re gonna join this activity class,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not great</p>
<p>and the program design isn&rsquo;t perfect,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine for 10 weeks.</p>
<p>In fact, you may really, really enjoy it.</p>
<p>And also, again, it gives you something new to think about.</p>
<p>Music is on, you&rsquo;re out of your house</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re lifting at your house,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a different part of the gym,</p>
<p>the schedule&rsquo;s a little tighter.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t just go work out whenever you want.</p>
<p>You gotta sort of show up when the class is going</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll probably find that you just love it.</p>
<p>You also get some social interaction, right,</p>
<p>which is something that&rsquo;s also very important</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t really discussed yet</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re out playing basketball by yourself or whatnot.</p>
<p>So this is just another thing I&rsquo;m trying to fold in</p>
<p>that still allows you to check off multiple boxes</p>
<p>of things that are healthy for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had episodes on the importance</p>
<p>of social connection interaction.</p>
<p>We talked about that in the quad breakdown</p>
<p>of making sure you have relationship time</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So throwing in a fitness class</p>
<p>and just doing honestly something quite different</p>
<p>is pretty fun.</p>
<p>But then still keeping two days a week</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re doing a traditional strength training thing</p>
<p>so you have some quality control there.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can also then make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hitting any specific movements or muscle groups</p>
<p>that are very important to you.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t get to control that in your fitness class,</p>
<p>but now you can at least do the gym</p>
<p>and make sure you hit that muscle group</p>
<p>that you have an interest in it.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re feeling pretty good.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re rolling into the summer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty lean.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting out in the sun a lot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re bringing calories down a little bit</p>
<p>and we probably are feeling pretty happy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also not burnt out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done a lot of fun things</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve checked a lot of the boxes off</p>
<p>for long-term development.</p>
<p>We had a combination of specificity</p>
<p>with exercise selection,</p>
<p>but we also folded in just a little bit of variation</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about overuse injury</p>
<p>of doing the same machines, the same lift</p>
<p>months and months and months after months</p>
<p>and slowly wearing down something</p>
<p>if our technique isn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re gonna go into our quarter three,</p>
<p>which is the summer months basically up here at least,</p>
<p>July to September.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll transition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since we&rsquo;ve done some conditioning.</p>
<p>So we may have lost a little cardiorespiratory fitness.</p>
<p>We may have not feeling great anymore.</p>
<p>Maybe energy throughout the day,</p>
<p>stuff is starting to leak down.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna get in shape.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna push our heart rate high</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna bring the calories back up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get into the summertime,</p>
<p>4th of July, other holidays like this</p>
<p>where eating is involved.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re going to sporting events and things like that.</p>
<p>Our sport choices is often going to be outdoors.</p>
<p>But in fact, what you&rsquo;ll notice here</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ve ramped the sport choice up to twice a week.</p>
<p>And in fact, I would encourage you</p>
<p>to do two different types of exercise.</p>
<p>And one of the primary reasons for that</p>
<p>is to spend more time outside.</p>
<p>A challenge we often see with people with exercise</p>
<p>is going, man, it&rsquo;s so nice outside.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t go sit in the gym for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>All right, I don&rsquo;t have that much free time.</p>
<p>And then he remains over here telling me</p>
<p>I need to get direct sunlight more</p>
<p>and like, how am I gonna fit this in?</p>
<p>Well, do your exercise outside, enjoy it.</p>
<p>Now, if you live down here like us,</p>
<p>you take sunshine for granted.</p>
<p>But a lot of people I know, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only nice for two and a half months of the year.</p>
<p>Get outside.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s push more of our fitness training</p>
<p>into outdoor activities.</p>
<p>These sports can be intense or not, right?</p>
<p>It could be, go out there and swim hard, get in the ocean.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna do open ocean swimming</p>
<p>instead of swimming in the pool indoors</p>
<p>or whatever the case may be.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna give ourselves more of a priority</p>
<p>of being outside, we&rsquo;ve looked pretty good,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a little tan and we&rsquo;re enjoying</p>
<p>all the benefits of training outside</p>
<p>and the lack of structure.</p>
<p>Still, we have structure, but not so specific</p>
<p>like the machines and the weights give us.</p>
<p>Maybe even now we&rsquo;re doing some track workouts.</p>
<p>So now we can do something like sprint the straightaways,</p>
<p>walk the corners.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have to, again, do our conditioning</p>
<p>on the same StairMaster or machine or whatever we&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna enjoy some stuff like that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna be athletic, we&rsquo;re gonna run, we&rsquo;re gonna move.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked about that yet, right?</p>
<p>Everything has really been about</p>
<p>sort of structured exercise.</p>
<p>Well, now we&rsquo;re gonna do some sprint work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get out and see that,</p>
<p>which is a really important human quality</p>
<p>that I think is important to not lose</p>
<p>is actually ability to sprint.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll still make sure we lift twice a week</p>
<p>for the same reasons I talked about in the previous phase.</p>
<p>So we make sure we have some quality control there.</p>
<p>We maintain some of the muscle</p>
<p>that we built in the quarter before.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t lose too much strength.</p>
<p>There is very good literature to suggest</p>
<p>strength maintenance can be done</p>
<p>in as little as five sets per week for a very long time,</p>
<p>really up to eight plus weeks if you do a little bit.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re touching it enough</p>
<p>to where you&rsquo;re not gonna get really, really weak.</p>
<p>But what you wouldn&rsquo;t wanna do is go 12 or 16 weeks</p>
<p>where you lifted no weights.</p>
<p>And maybe you got in great shape,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna feel very weak after that.</p>
<p>So maybe that number can come down to one time a week</p>
<p>if you really wanted it to,</p>
<p>but one to two days a week where you&rsquo;re lifting</p>
<p>the big exercises, the muscle groups</p>
<p>and the movements of interest, and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<p>Then lastly, we roll into our final quarter,</p>
<p>which is October to December.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna really get in great shape.</p>
<p>The sun is starting to come down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re rolling into the holidays.</p>
<p>Weather&rsquo;s getting worse.</p>
<p>We may have other outdoor activities we wanna do.</p>
<p>Like in my case, you&rsquo;re going on a hunting trip.</p>
<p>You have some travel, conferences,</p>
<p>whatever the case may be.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re going to choose an indoor sport.</p>
<p>And I love combat sports.</p>
<p>So the example I gave earlier was like jujitsu,</p>
<p>or maybe you just transition your basketball to inside</p>
<p>or your pickleball comes inside</p>
<p>or whatever it happens to be.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re still gonna have that twice a week.</p>
<p>And then maybe instead of the track workout outside,</p>
<p>you do that same workout indoors now</p>
<p>back on some sort of machine or something like that.</p>
<p>Our weights are actually now down to once a week</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re really pushing the pace on cardiovascular.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing once a week to maintain it,</p>
<p>to not lose and get too far behind.</p>
<p>But we really wanna bring up our VO2 max.</p>
<p>We wanna bring up our efficiency,</p>
<p>our cardiac output and everything like that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re still gonna now walk twice a week</p>
<p>so that we get something outside.</p>
<p>And I talked about why, again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nice to have that flexibility</p>
<p>of not having to train outside</p>
<p>because now you got to warm up and do all those things.</p>
<p>You just get out and get a walk in.</p>
<p>You still get the outdoor experience.</p>
<p>So we run that entire thing.</p>
<p>And then you just start back the next year.</p>
<p>Ideally, again, at the end of every quarter,</p>
<p>you take a week off,</p>
<p>whether that is a true full week off,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m fully in support of.</p>
<p>I mean, friends, we&rsquo;re only talking</p>
<p>about four off weeks a year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely fine.</p>
<p>Or it could even be a slight deload week</p>
<p>if you want it to be.</p>
<p>So we shouldn&rsquo;t run into too many issues of overuse.</p>
<p>We have a lot of variety.</p>
<p>We get a lot of movement patterns in</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re mixing in sport with machines and dumbbells.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re mixing in social interaction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re mixing in the sun.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re mixing in enjoyment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re mixing in fat loss, strength, hypertrophy,</p>
<p>some cardiovascular endurance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re mixing in calories in high.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re mixing in a little bit of calories low.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re trying to hit as many of these nodes as possible.</p>
<p>If you also wanted to cut each one of these</p>
<p>a little bit short and repeat your fitness testing</p>
<p>at the end of every quarter, you could.</p>
<p>I would probably recommend doing it at least once a year,</p>
<p>perhaps doing it maybe the third week of December or so.</p>
<p>So you run that testing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your last week of training.</p>
<p>Then you get to go on your vacation break.</p>
<p>You come back at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got new goals, new targets, and you go.</p>
<p>If you wanted to repeat it twice a year,</p>
<p>do the same sort of thing at the end of June, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I know I laid these out as quarters,</p>
<p>which is generally 12 weeks with one back-off week.</p>
<p>But if you wanted to make it nine weeks</p>
<p>and a testing week and then a back-off for 10 weeks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s close enough.</p>
<p>So the last little thing I wanna say is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;re doing the 12 weeks</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna have a back-off week</p>
<p>at the end of the 12 weeks.</p>
<p>I would actually still then recommend</p>
<p>having at least one back-off week halfway through.</p>
<p>So it would look like this.</p>
<p>Five weeks, hard, where you&rsquo;re progressing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going up, up, up, up, up.</p>
<p>Every week, you&rsquo;re either increasing volume intensity</p>
<p>like we talked about a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>Then week six, deload.</p>
<p>Go down to 70% volume and intensity.</p>
<p>Come back, go hard for five more weeks.</p>
<p>And now week 12 is your true off week</p>
<p>where you, again, take the whole thing off.</p>
<p>If you do that, you now have four weeks a year</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re totally off.</p>
<p>You have four weeks a year where you&rsquo;re really backing down</p>
<p>and you just have five-week segments all year round</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just gonna push it hard for five weeks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need a break, you&rsquo;re gonna reset,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna transition a little bit.</p>
<p>Now, as I started this conversation off with,</p>
<p>there are many ways you could structure</p>
<p>your training program throughout the year</p>
<p>and hit those primary goals we talked about</p>
<p>of looking fantastic, feeling amazing,</p>
<p>and being able to do that your entire life.</p>
<p>All I can tell you though is I know this model works</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve done this a lot with our clients</p>
<p>in our Rapid Health Optimization Program.</p>
<p>And this spans everything from 25-year-old folks</p>
<p>who are competing in the Boston Marathon</p>
<p>to a lot of individuals who have never exercised before</p>
<p>who maybe have done a little bit of exercise.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s quite literally</p>
<p>all three of the buckets you laid out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had clients in all of those areas,</p>
<p>both men and women, young and old.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had a tremendous amount of success</p>
<p>transforming their lives using a very similar model</p>
<p>to what I just laid out.</p>
<p>I find that overall structure to be immensely informative.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you why in the context</p>
<p>of a number of examples of myself,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s the least important of them, frankly,</p>
<p>but examples of family members of mine and friends of mine</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve undertaken consistent exercise training programs,</p>
<p>but that haven&rsquo;t varied the program so much.</p>
<p>And here again, I think of the person</p>
<p>who really loves to swim.</p>
<p>They have a low barrier of entry to the pool or to the ocean.</p>
<p>They love being in the water.</p>
<p>I am not one such person.</p>
<p>I like being in the water,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t motivate to drive to the pool</p>
<p>or to bike to the pool or to get into the ocean that often.</p>
<p>Once I do it, I enjoy it.</p>
<p>But for me, it&rsquo;s running and lifting weights.</p>
<p>And it has been for a very long time.</p>
<p>I have a family member, close family member</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t really like quote unquote exercise,</p>
<p>but loves dance and dancing.</p>
<p>Going out dancing, yes, but dance classes in particular.</p>
<p>Really enjoys it.</p>
<p>Loves to be distracted from the fact</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s doing exercise and just really enjoys it.</p>
<p>And it actually is a very good dancer,</p>
<p>despite the fact that she&rsquo;s related to me.</p>
<p>And on and on.</p>
<p>There are many examples, I think,</p>
<p>of folks that fall into the different bins</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>but that also tend to default towards a given structure</p>
<p>of training one way and doing that throughout the year.</p>
<p>I can tell you right now</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m personally going to modify my schedule</p>
<p>according to this four quarters per year.</p>
<p>It actually works because I&rsquo;ve mostly been</p>
<p>on the quarter system in academics for a very long time.</p>
<p>I was at a university, had a semester system once,</p>
<p>but this quarter system is actually</p>
<p>the one that we follow academically.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one reason why it&rsquo;s a natural fit for me.</p>
<p>I confess that I typically don&rsquo;t vary up</p>
<p>the proportions of endurance to resistance training.</p>
<p>I tend to keep those about three and three across the week,</p>
<p>three resistance training sessions,</p>
<p>three, let&rsquo;s call them cardio sessions,</p>
<p>but each one designed to achieve a different adaptation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve now altered those even further</p>
<p>based on your recommendations</p>
<p>in this episode and previous episodes.</p>
<p>But what I have not done</p>
<p>is to really think about deload</p>
<p>and to really stick to the structure that I set out</p>
<p>to accomplish across the year.</p>
<p>On the topic of deload,</p>
<p>for me, the deload has been</p>
<p>when I get overwhelmed with work or I&rsquo;ve gotten sick.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to get sick that often,</p>
<p>but every once in a while I&rsquo;ll get knocked back</p>
<p>with a cold or a flu.</p>
<p>Once every three or four years,</p>
<p>I seem to really get hammered</p>
<p>with a fever inducing something or other.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m bedridden for a couple of days</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m back at it.</p>
<p>And I tend to come back rather slowly</p>
<p>and that tends to be my week off.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder</p>
<p>whether or not part of the reason I hit those streaks</p>
<p>of being overwhelmed by sickness or by stress</p>
<p>is that I have not done a deload period.</p>
<p>So one of the things that I&rsquo;m going to immediately implement</p>
<p>is a periodic deload</p>
<p>according to the program that you described.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also going to start matching my specific goals</p>
<p>for each quarter with time of year.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve done that</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not because I live in California.</p>
<p>And by the way, folks, there are temperature variations</p>
<p>and amount of light across the day variations</p>
<p>in California as well,</p>
<p>although they are not as dramatic</p>
<p>as they would be near the North Pole, for instance.</p>
<p>But of course, some of the listeners are at the equator,</p>
<p>so they have the opposite issue.</p>
<p>In any event, I&rsquo;m definitely going to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start incorporating regular deload periods.</p>
<p>And I am going to be very dedicated,</p>
<p>very disciplined about sticking to a program</p>
<p>for three months devoted mainly to hypertrophy,</p>
<p>then a three-month program devoted to fat loss,</p>
<p>then a program devoted to aerobic output,</p>
<p>and then one devoted to endurance.</p>
<p>Although I must say it&rsquo;s very tempting for me</p>
<p>to do a very specific strength dedicated portion</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t tend to be particularly strong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not weak, but I&rsquo;m not particularly strong.</p>
<p>So I might consult with you</p>
<p>as to how I could vary endurance and strength.</p>
<p>In any event, I love the idea of a macro structure,</p>
<p>and I love the idea of deloads in anticipation</p>
<p>of being able to go further in the long run</p>
<p>in terms of results.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping this next year,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re just on the cusp of a new year,</p>
<p>will be the first year in which I don&rsquo;t find myself</p>
<p>getting some bug or virus or whatever it happens to be</p>
<p>from time to time</p>
<p>and having to back off on training for that reason.</p>
<p>And that prompts a question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that I want to get into in more detail</p>
<p>with you when you describe recovery in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>But a couple of quick questions,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s some short or shortish answers</p>
<p>you could provide.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not feeling well,</p>
<p>like I really had a poor night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>maybe just two to four hours of sleep for whatever reason,</p>
<p>train or don&rsquo;t train?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first question.</p>
<p>Second question is if I&rsquo;m starting to feel</p>
<p>a little bit of a throat tickle</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m in that phase of denial,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t get sick, I&rsquo;m not getting sick,</p>
<p>and would I be better off bundling up some hot liquids,</p>
<p>getting into bed, sleeping a little bit more, et cetera,</p>
<p>and protecting myself against that</p>
<p>or would I be better off training?</p>
<p>And then the third question is</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ve already succumbed to a bug,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a severe bug,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have elevated body temperature, so no fever,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hacking up and not productive cough</p>
<p>or anything like that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m feeling just kind of not well,</p>
<p>head cold-ish sort of thing comes to mind</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not seasonal allergies,</p>
<p>train or don&rsquo;t train?</p>
<p>Leaving aside the point of whether or not</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a position to get anyone else sick</p>
<p>because obviously that&rsquo;s a bad idea.</p>
<p>Okay, so lack of sleep,</p>
<p>I would say 30 to 40% of one&rsquo;s typical sleep</p>
<p>the previous night, train or no train?</p>
<p>Starting to feel like one might be getting ill.</p>
<p>And then the third category is coming back from being sick.</p>
<p>Thanks, and sorry for the extended question,</p>
<p>but I wanna make sure there was enough detail there</p>
<p>because I think these are three common scenarios.</p>
<p>We are going to cover that in the recovery conversation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s next in detail</p>
<p>and I will give you very specific guidelines</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to go into that.</p>
<p>The quick answer is it comes back</p>
<p>to what phase of training you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Now, to walk through each scenario.</p>
<p>If it is a crummy night of sleep</p>
<p>and I am in a phase of training</p>
<p>in which we are trying to cause adaptation,</p>
<p>I have a lot of space in my schedule</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really using this time to make progress</p>
<p>because I know coming up soon,</p>
<p>my schedule will change and my time to train will go down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still training.</p>
<p>I might use a bunch of tricks that we have</p>
<p>for feeling better instantaneously.</p>
<p>We call these little hacks.</p>
<p>These are acute hacks.</p>
<p>These are not chronic hacks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna push the base.</p>
<p>If it is really close to a deload week,</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s Wednesday and I start my deload next week,</p>
<p>or this is not one bad night of sleep.</p>
<p>This has been four bad nights of sleep</p>
<p>in the last five days.</p>
<p>This has been six kind of crummy nights</p>
<p>over the course of the last nine</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re starting to see a larger pattern</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a different answer.</p>
<p>So the question we&rsquo;re going to ask ourself is,</p>
<p>is this acute or is this a tendency</p>
<p>or actually a chronic thing?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s acute and we&rsquo;re close,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna train through it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s acute and this is not a phase of training</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re trying to really push,</p>
<p>then maybe we back off a little bit.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s the opposite though,</p>
<p>we need to probably make some changes</p>
<p>and give ourselves some recovery.</p>
<p>This may include anything from a moderate training session.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m gonna go in the sauna and sit through that</p>
<p>and then do some breathing drills and some mobility stuff.</p>
<p>All right, great.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m gonna, again, go to the gym</p>
<p>and ride the bike at 50% heart rate.</p>
<p>Something restorative like that.</p>
<p>Gives you a little bit of energy</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t beat you down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably where we&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling sick and you think it&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably going to do option two as well,</p>
<p>which is some sort of restorative training.</p>
<p>So again, this tends to be moderate, could be weights,</p>
<p>could be any of this stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re gonna go out for your swim</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not going to push past probably about 70%.</p>
<p>We can absolutely induce immunosuppression</p>
<p>with excessive training.</p>
<p>And so you may wanna walk out of that.</p>
<p>The last case, which was I think phase number three,</p>
<p>you said there, which is sort of like</p>
<p>I got a pretty gnarly cold right now.</p>
<p>Am I gonna train?</p>
<p>Most of the time for most people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna say, just shut it down.</p>
<p>Get out of there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to get productivity done there,</p>
<p>you may be better off either going and sleeping,</p>
<p>catching up on work, doing other stuff</p>
<p>so that the next time we go to train, you don&rsquo;t feel behind</p>
<p>and we can give a good solid effort for it.</p>
<p>So I know other people who will train right through it.</p>
<p>I tend to not to be totally frank.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m feeling kind of junky, I&rsquo;m really not gonna train.</p>
<p>I may actually probably do some hot water immersion.</p>
<p>So bath, jacuzzi, things like that.</p>
<p>I actually like those better than I like sauna.</p>
<p>If one is ill or you just like them better</p>
<p>than sauna generally.</p>
<p>Both actually.</p>
<p>Oh my, first person ever met or come on this podcast</p>
<p>to say you like baths and jacuzzi more than sauna.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I may even do some ice, probably not a ton though,</p>
<p>cause you gotta be careful there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big stressor.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re already over the line,</p>
<p>you may be adding a pass there.</p>
<p>Or I may go sleep.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m feeling very, very, very sleepy</p>
<p>and sometimes depending on what kind of a bug you get,</p>
<p>that can happen, I will just sleep.</p>
<p>And that might be the best choice you have.</p>
<p>If that means you kick the cold half a day earlier,</p>
<p>then you just won in the aggregate.</p>
<p>So those are probably, it&rsquo;s a little bit of inside</p>
<p>of the algorithm that I&rsquo;m running with those things.</p>
<p>Those are highly informative answers.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I look forward to our discussion about recovery</p>
<p>so that we can go into even more depth on how to recover.</p>
<p>The last thing I do want to say here</p>
<p>is kind of going back to our quarter system.</p>
<p>The examples I gave with the bulking up, losing fat</p>
<p>and then getting into better fitness</p>
<p>and cardiovascular fitness at the end.</p>
<p>Those were just samples.</p>
<p>Friends, please don&rsquo;t take that literally.</p>
<p>If you want to emphasize strength more,</p>
<p>put in some more strength.</p>
<p>If you want to emphasize a different one</p>
<p>of our nine adaptations, great, do that too.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who has a lot of body fat to lose,</p>
<p>then maybe put that for two consecutive sessions</p>
<p>or every other, you can modify them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about nine very specific training adaptations</p>
<p>as well as in fat loss.</p>
<p>I only gave you four, which is just meant to be a sample</p>
<p>that you can roll in or out, but use those priorities</p>
<p>to adjust that system according</p>
<p>to what is important for you now,</p>
<p>five years and then 45 years down the line</p>
<p>for whatever that may be.</p>
<p>So if you are absolutely free to modify the order,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re absolutely free to modify the primary outcome</p>
<p>and then adjust the specifics within each quarter</p>
<p>based upon what is needed to do to optimize that outcome.</p>
<p>I think maybe one more tool we can offer people</p>
<p>is maybe giving the individual week</p>
<p>a little bit more structure.</p>
<p>So the system I laid out is sort of like month by month</p>
<p>and maybe we can lay out,</p>
<p>say a three day a week workout program</p>
<p>and a four day a week program that would still hit some</p>
<p>of the same well-rounded adaptations</p>
<p>that probably covers maybe not individualized per bucket</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about A, B and C,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna cover 75, 80% of what would need</p>
<p>to occur in all three buckets.</p>
<p>And then you can use that last 25%</p>
<p>for your individual goal or specialization.</p>
<p>So maybe we can jump into that next.</p>
<p>Great, let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>The first one I wanna give you is just a basic</p>
<p>three day split that again, same idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a well-rounded exercise program.</p>
<p>I actually wrote this all in an article</p>
<p>that is on XPT&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>So perhaps we can link directly to that.</p>
<p>I will just jump you straight to the answer.</p>
<p>You can read more about why in details</p>
<p>in that article if you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>But this is day one, day two, day three.</p>
<p>You could do these days where you split them up</p>
<p>actually having say 24 hours in between,</p>
<p>or you could do these back to back.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily matter.</p>
<p>In this particular case, say day one,</p>
<p>you would start off and do a little bit of speed and power.</p>
<p>And then you may finish that</p>
<p>with a little bit of hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Now, if you wanna gain more speed and power,</p>
<p>you just do more of it.</p>
<p>If you wanna maybe just do a little bit to touch it</p>
<p>and you really wanna gain some muscle,</p>
<p>you would do more of an emphasis there.</p>
<p>So the template can stay the same</p>
<p>and you would just increase the amount</p>
<p>of either adaptation, the speed and power stuff,</p>
<p>or the hypertrophy based on how high it is</p>
<p>in your priority list.</p>
<p>Those are combined together</p>
<p>because as we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t necessarily interfere with each other.</p>
<p>You would do the speed and power stuff first</p>
<p>because it wouldn&rsquo;t hamper the hypertrophy.</p>
<p>If you did the hypertrophy first in that workout,</p>
<p>it would probably compromise your speed and power.</p>
<p>And in that case,</p>
<p>you would actually not be getting your adaptation.</p>
<p>So day one, you do that.</p>
<p>And that could be a 20 minute workout total</p>
<p>or a two and a half hour up to you.</p>
<p>Then you would come back maybe the next day</p>
<p>or two days later, whatever you&rsquo;d like to do.</p>
<p>In your second day of exercise,</p>
<p>you would start off with a pure strength protocol</p>
<p>and you would finish that with what I&rsquo;m calling</p>
<p>just a higher heart rate.</p>
<p>So this could be something like our anaerobic capacity stuff.</p>
<p>It could be the aerobic capacity,</p>
<p>something where you&rsquo;re getting up</p>
<p>to close to high heart rate.</p>
<p>It could be those 20 second bursts.</p>
<p>It could be a 90 second burst, five minute mile repeats,</p>
<p>anything you like.</p>
<p>You can just sort of plug and play this in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting to a spot now</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve had a little bit of speed,</p>
<p>a little bit of strength, a little bit of hypertrophy,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve touched a high heart rate.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve checked off most of the boxes already</p>
<p>into sessions.</p>
<p>Our last session then would be more of a steady state,</p>
<p>long duration endurance.</p>
<p>And so a three day week split like that</p>
<p>is gonna be a pretty nice setup</p>
<p>for the average person.</p>
<p>So this could be a Monday, Wednesday, Friday,</p>
<p>Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening on the intervening days?</p>
<p>Totally off, if you want it to be.</p>
<p>So I set this up as in the best I can give you,</p>
<p>Andy, is three days.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>If you have more, we could certainly improve it,</p>
<p>but this was my worst case scenario.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got other things in my life.</p>
<p>The most I could do for exercise is three days a week.</p>
<p>And given that it&rsquo;s three days per week,</p>
<p>how approximately how long</p>
<p>are each of these workouts going to last?</p>
<p>I would do whole body exercises for almost all that.</p>
<p>I would do your full body parts.</p>
<p>And I think you could certainly finish that</p>
<p>in 45 minutes of work time.</p>
<p>A little bit of time to warm up,</p>
<p>some down regulation at the end.</p>
<p>You could be in and out of that gym</p>
<p>in certainly under 60 minutes.</p>
<p>The reality is you could probably be out of there</p>
<p>in under 50 minutes.</p>
<p>The total work time could be 30, 35 once you get going.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s three days.</p>
<p>As you pointed out,</p>
<p>probably more work per week is going to be better</p>
<p>in terms of maximizing goals of aesthetic goals</p>
<p>and performance enhancing goals and longevity goals.</p>
<p>I mean, the numbers that I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>is that we should all try to get somewhere between 150</p>
<p>and probably more like 180 to 200 minutes</p>
<p>of zone two cardio per week minimum.</p>
<p>But as I recall, you consider zone two cardio</p>
<p>so low intensity that just walking around</p>
<p>qualifies as zone one, zone two cardio.</p>
<p>Yeah, not to take us too far off track,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s actually useful to differentiate</p>
<p>what I consider to be exercise and physical activity.</p>
<p>So physical activity is out for a walk.</p>
<p>It is using a walking treadmill while you&rsquo;re at work.</p>
<p>It is parking farther in the parking lot</p>
<p>and taking more steps.</p>
<p>These are all important.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s clear, you are not going to reach</p>
<p>likely optimal health by only exercising hard</p>
<p>and then sitting around the other 23 and a half hours today.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very, very important.</p>
<p>Whether you wanna do that in the form of zone one</p>
<p>or zone two and hit 30 minutes a day,</p>
<p>various organizations will say things like that.</p>
<p>You need to have 30 minutes a day</p>
<p>of moderate to low intensity exercise.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>You can combine it like that if you want.</p>
<p>What you don&rsquo;t wanna do is just physical activity only,</p>
<p>which is almost always going to be like zone one</p>
<p>to maybe zone two.</p>
<p>You also don&rsquo;t wanna go the other end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>which is again, like I lift hard three days a week.</p>
<p>And then what do you do the rest of the time?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not optimal either.</p>
<p>And so I guess the system I&rsquo;ve walked you through here</p>
<p>or the example rather I walked you through is</p>
<p>you would need to maybe supplant that</p>
<p>with being physically active.</p>
<p>If you work, say you&rsquo;re a nurse and you&rsquo;re on your feet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re moving up and down,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably actually covering a decent amount</p>
<p>of your physical activity</p>
<p>because you might be at 15,000 steps a day.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sitting in front of your computer</p>
<p>and you do this same three day split,</p>
<p>you would probably need to go out of your way</p>
<p>to make sure you&rsquo;re adding a bunch more steps in.</p>
<p>So you might need to add several hours of walking</p>
<p>to hit that 150, 180 minutes a week of physical activity</p>
<p>because the program I laid out is,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing really 45 minutes, three days a week,</p>
<p>maybe 60 minutes, at best you&rsquo;ve hit 180.</p>
<p>60 minutes times three, 180 a week.</p>
<p>So you might actually need to then throw in</p>
<p>maybe some more specific walks.</p>
<p>So you could do that in a number of ways.</p>
<p>It could be again, actual structured exercise.</p>
<p>It could be simply,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do a 10 minute walk three times a day.</p>
<p>It could be the exercise snacks</p>
<p>that we talked about in a previous episode.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots of ways to engage in more physical activity.</p>
<p>But to me, those are different oftentimes</p>
<p>in structured exercise.</p>
<p>I think many people will appreciate</p>
<p>that you put out there for us a three day a week protocol</p>
<p>because many people simply don&rsquo;t have more time to exercise.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re putting emphasis on these other bins</p>
<p>in the quadrant.</p>
<p>And frankly, those other bins are very important as well.</p>
<p>So wonderful that people can check off some critical boxes</p>
<p>for aesthetics and performance and longevity</p>
<p>with three days of work or workouts per week, I should say.</p>
<p>What are some other schedules that people can follow</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re willing to dedicate a bit more time</p>
<p>toward their fitness?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>If you wanted to do another sample of maybe a four day week.</p>
<p>And again, to clarify this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really happy you said that.</p>
<p>This is a four day week of structured exercise.</p>
<p>This would not account your physical activity</p>
<p>and moving around.</p>
<p>Which everybody should be doing.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Maybe this is something like day one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do a strength training session</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll stay in the five to 10 or so repetition range.</p>
<p>A little bit of strength, a little bit of hypertrophy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve checked off a couple of boxes.</p>
<p>Probably whole body.</p>
<p>So that you get all the body parts covered or close.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at generally multi-joint exercises.</p>
<p>Could be a combination of barbells, free weights,</p>
<p>bands, machines, anything like that would be sort of day one.</p>
<p>You could come back the very next day</p>
<p>or you could wait 24 hours.</p>
<p>But the second day of your exercise</p>
<p>would be maybe your long duration.</p>
<p>And this is actually sort of similar to how you set it up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you do a little bit of the inverse.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re kind of saying is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably gonna be a little bit sore from day one</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have any free body parts that aren&rsquo;t sore.</p>
<p>So instead of trying to do another lift or something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna put in some restorative,</p>
<p>longer duration stuff.</p>
<p>Same exact principles for long duration</p>
<p>we just talked about.</p>
<p>Could be a swim.</p>
<p>Could be any number of things.</p>
<p>Could be your sport.</p>
<p>Could be you&rsquo;re out, ride the bike</p>
<p>and go for a jog in the sun.</p>
<p>Whatever you would like to do.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling better,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s a little harder longer.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling pretty beat up from the day before,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s a little bit shorter and slower.</p>
<p>You can modify it.</p>
<p>Then maybe you take the next day off or that&rsquo;s open.</p>
<p>Your third day of exercise is now,</p>
<p>instead of being that five to 10 repetition range</p>
<p>for your lifts,</p>
<p>you do something like 11 to 30 reps range.</p>
<p>Also, this could be exchanged</p>
<p>for something more like body weight,</p>
<p>more muscular endurance type of stuff.</p>
<p>So this is a great day.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s yoga.</p>
<p>Maybe it is a gymnastics thing you&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>or any of the many other styles of training</p>
<p>that are not quote unquote lifting weights,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not just walking and hiking.</p>
<p>So it could be a Pilates or equivalent.</p>
<p>Anything like this</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna get some muscular burn in there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably not any additional weight</p>
<p>outside of body weight.</p>
<p>Or if it is, it&rsquo;s fairly minimal,</p>
<p>five, 10, sort of 15 pounds.</p>
<p>Something like that would be nice.</p>
<p>Could also be done in a circuit.</p>
<p>So we could hit our high heart rate</p>
<p>and we could hit some muscular endurance in there.</p>
<p>Group activity class might be nice here.</p>
<p>Even maybe something like a spin class or a dance class.</p>
<p>All these things could be great.</p>
<p>And then maybe you even finish that</p>
<p>with 10 minutes of some light weights</p>
<p>to hit the body part you say didn&rsquo;t get.</p>
<p>So maybe you did the dance class</p>
<p>and then you finish and you do 10 minutes</p>
<p>of upper body sets of 30</p>
<p>to make sure you get a nice pump there</p>
<p>because your legs probably got some work</p>
<p>during the dance class, but your upper body didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you balance the system out a little bit.</p>
<p>So all body parts got a little bit of muscular endurance.</p>
<p>Your heart rate got really high, came back down,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve sort of checked both of those boxes.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s important to remember the hypertrophy episode.</p>
<p>Doing sets of say 15 plus repetitions per set</p>
<p>is as effective as doing sets of five to 10 or 12</p>
<p>for hypertrophy, gaining muscle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not effective though for strength gains.</p>
<p>So you wouldn&rsquo;t wanna do this only</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d really be doing nothing</p>
<p>to improve your muscle strength.</p>
<p>And you wanna make sure that that box is ticked</p>
<p>at least a little bit.</p>
<p>Then again, you could take the day off after this,</p>
<p>or you could roll right into your fourth exercise day,</p>
<p>which would be your last exercise session of the week.</p>
<p>And you would do something more of like a medium intensity.</p>
<p>So this is a little bit higher intensity</p>
<p>than our second day.</p>
<p>And this could be something like, you know,</p>
<p>shadow boxing or hitting a heavy bag.</p>
<p>It could be a little bit of higher intensity intervals,</p>
<p>but not all the way up.</p>
<p>So maybe this is, you&rsquo;re gonna do a one minute on,</p>
<p>one minute off on the bike,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re only gonna go to like 85, 90% heart rate.</p>
<p>And then instead of going off during that one minute,</p>
<p>you drop it down to 50%.</p>
<p>So it would actually look like 30 minutes of straight work,</p>
<p>but you would have a little bit of rolling intensity</p>
<p>as opposed to staying really nice and restorative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be some work there.</p>
<p>And you would finish it with something like</p>
<p>five to six minutes total of max heart rate stuff,</p>
<p>which lines up perfectly with that number</p>
<p>you actually created in our endurance episode</p>
<p>of hitting six minutes total per week</p>
<p>of maximum heart rate or close.</p>
<p>So you could wrap that all up kind of into one session.</p>
<p>You could do those in the inverse order.</p>
<p>Thorough warmup, a few minutes,</p>
<p>whether you wanna do 30 second bursts or a minute burst</p>
<p>or straight five minutes.</p>
<p>This is a protocol I like to use a ton on the assault bike</p>
<p>is simply a good warmup, 10 minutes, solid warmup.</p>
<p>Recover, and then I&rsquo;m gonna go five minutes</p>
<p>and cover as much distance as I can in five minutes.</p>
<p>Brutal.</p>
<p>It is brutal and it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And you get a lot done in five minutes.</p>
<p>10 minutes on the back of that is a very gradual</p>
<p>bring back to earth there.</p>
<p>I actually, in that case,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to do down regulation breathing</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve spent 10 minutes</p>
<p>actually coming way back down.</p>
<p>And the last two minutes or so of that</p>
<p>is very deliberate five second inhale through the nose,</p>
<p>five second exhale through the nose</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m barely just moving.</p>
<p>And you end up being in a pretty good spot.</p>
<p>So that again, time-wise could easily be done in 30 minutes</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d be rounded off there.</p>
<p>So the nice part about this four day a week split</p>
<p>as well as the three day a week split</p>
<p>is it does give you a little bit of flexibility.</p>
<p>And so what I mean is maybe Monday</p>
<p>your plan is to do the day one lift.</p>
<p>And then any number of things popped up in life,</p>
<p>you shipped it back to Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rather than saying like Monday is leg day</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden something happened,</p>
<p>you missed leg day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re doing these things in order</p>
<p>and you would like to get all four done in a seven day span.</p>
<p>But if it doesn&rsquo;t happen, fine.</p>
<p>The next day you get the workout,</p>
<p>you just go right back into the next workout.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t matter what day they land on exactly.</p>
<p>For the three day routine that works very nice</p>
<p>because the assumption there</p>
<p>is you really only have time for three workouts a week.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s sort of implicit</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s probably some chaos happening</p>
<p>in the schedule a little bit.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t really have the ability</p>
<p>to lock in three days per week.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not the case, you can go.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re trying to listen to the pain points</p>
<p>that people have with exercise</p>
<p>and see if we can give them some solutions for those.</p>
<p>Several things about this program are attractive to me.</p>
<p>One of them you just mentioned,</p>
<p>which is that by not rigidly attaching individual workouts</p>
<p>just to specific days of the week,</p>
<p>one in theory could say,</p>
<p>okay, I didn&rsquo;t get that much sleep last night.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel, I know that a lot of people say,</p>
<p>what is feel?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t feel recovered</p>
<p>or like I&rsquo;m gonna get that much out of the workout tomorrow</p>
<p>or today, so I&rsquo;m just gonna push it forward a day.</p>
<p>And the ability to slide workouts forward or back by a day</p>
<p>I think is incredibly valuable for the consistency sake.</p>
<p>I also really like this idea</p>
<p>of some of the long duration work coming a day</p>
<p>after hitting the strength and a bit of hypertrophy work.</p>
<p>So this would be the day two.</p>
<p>One thing that I&rsquo;ve experienced over and over</p>
<p>is that if I&rsquo;m very sore in a given muscle group,</p>
<p>especially my legs, doing some low intensity cardio,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a jog or on the bike,</p>
<p>typically for me, it&rsquo;s a jog or even skipping rope</p>
<p>and then walking, skipping rope and walking</p>
<p>does seem to dissipate the soreness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a mechanism for everything, frankly.</p>
<p>But I like that arrangement.</p>
<p>And then I also like this idea</p>
<p>of making sure that there&rsquo;s a workout for muscular endurance</p>
<p>because I feel like unless I&rsquo;ve been stuck</p>
<p>without a good gym or I&rsquo;ve decided</p>
<p>to specifically train body weight exercise,</p>
<p>which I did a few years ago,</p>
<p>I got really excited about some of Pavel Satsulin&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Great stuff, yeah, amazing.</p>
<p>The Naked Warrior, which doesn&rsquo;t involve training naked,</p>
<p>although I suppose you could if you wanted,</p>
<p>but it was really about no weights</p>
<p>and involved building up to pistol squats</p>
<p>and one-arm pushups and things of that sort,</p>
<p>even doing pull-ups on doors.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve discovered that some door frames</p>
<p>are much stronger than others in hotels.</p>
<p>I just accidentally caused some damage there.</p>
<p>But in any case, muscular endurance,</p>
<p>I think is a really interesting one</p>
<p>that I plan to incorporate into my schedule.</p>
<p>But that is, I think is one that&rsquo;s often overlooked</p>
<p>unless people really have an aversion</p>
<p>to weights and to machines.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, it shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s pretty low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a lot of equipment for it typically.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that bad.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t often get that sore out of it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna feel a nice, wonderful pump afterwards.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s great, and as we discussed many times now,</p>
<p>it is quite effective at hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I also, I don&rsquo;t know if they fit specifically</p>
<p>with muscular endurance, but if you look at the physiques,</p>
<p>for example, on rock climbers,</p>
<p>I mean, they have, to me, of course they have,</p>
<p>usually the experienced climbers</p>
<p>have pretty remarkable body compositions.</p>
<p>They tend to be lean and lithe and flexible,</p>
<p>all those things that many people aspire to.</p>
<p>The other thing is their development</p>
<p>always looks exceedingly balanced.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really tend to see climbers</p>
<p>that are overdeveloped in the torso</p>
<p>and underdeveloped in the arms</p>
<p>or overdeveloped in the arms despite all the climbing</p>
<p>and underdeveloped relatively in the other limb movement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true for women and men.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a sport that I participate in,</p>
<p>but it seems like what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is essentially muscular endurance training.</p>
<p>Basically, yep.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s really something there to be valued.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a four-day-a-week schedule</p>
<p>with off days or rest days inserted as needed</p>
<p>and then just continuing.</p>
<p>For those that are a bit more committed to their fitness</p>
<p>and want to do a five or six-day-a-week program,</p>
<p>would you recommend just collapsing some of the off days,</p>
<p>paying more attention to recovery</p>
<p>and cycling through more quickly?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>You could combine that and just run that,</p>
<p>either one of those programs.</p>
<p>So you could run that three-day-a-week program back to back.</p>
<p>Get that done in six days.</p>
<p>So day one, speed, power, hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Day two, strength, work with elevated heart rate,</p>
<p>anaerobic capacity.</p>
<p>And day three, endurance,</p>
<p>and then just cycle through again.</p>
<p>You take day four off of the week</p>
<p>and then you go back again.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d be having the six days of exercise,</p>
<p>one day off, and you&rsquo;d be getting</p>
<p>every one of those adaptations in multiple times a week.</p>
<p>That is almost exactly how I would set up</p>
<p>a six-day-a-week program.</p>
<p>Great, I love the elegance and the simplicity of that</p>
<p>and the thoroughness of it,</p>
<p>because it checks off so many,</p>
<p>if not all of the nine major adaptations to exercise</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about these episodes.</p>
<p>And I suppose the one thing that I want to highlight</p>
<p>and pose this also as a question</p>
<p>is that early in our discussions in a previous episode,</p>
<p>you mentioned that so much of what people think of</p>
<p>and apply as it relates to resistance training</p>
<p>is borrowed from bodybuilding</p>
<p>and hypertrophy training specifically,</p>
<p>which typically involves getting close to failure</p>
<p>or failure, sometimes even involving rest, pause,</p>
<p>where you hit failure,</p>
<p>then set the weight down for a few seconds</p>
<p>and repeat these high-intensity techniques,</p>
<p>accentuating the negative, so-called eccentric, et cetera.</p>
<p>In hearing about these protocols of three-day-a-week</p>
<p>or four-day-a-week, six-day-a-week,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear to me that if one is not careful</p>
<p>to omit that kind of thinking</p>
<p>and suddenly is taking their strength work</p>
<p>and speed work to failure,</p>
<p>or is pushing too hard on muscular endurance</p>
<p>to the point where you&rsquo;re just grinding out</p>
<p>that very last pushup on every set,</p>
<p>that the amount of soreness and the amount of recovery</p>
<p>that results from these workouts</p>
<p>might start to cause progress issues.</p>
<p>So one thing that&rsquo;s in the back of my mind is,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve described these programs,</p>
<p>is that even though some of them are very brief</p>
<p>or involve a minimum of time commitment,</p>
<p>in particular the three-day-a-week,</p>
<p>but also the four-day-a-week schedule,</p>
<p>there is a discipline involved in making sure</p>
<p>that you stick to the workout</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re supposed to do that day</p>
<p>and not go ham, as they say,</p>
<p>and just throw in a couple extra sets</p>
<p>of bicep curls and tricep pushes</p>
<p>because you want to do that</p>
<p>and you thought maybe you could get away with that,</p>
<p>but you have to come back pretty quickly</p>
<p>and do some serious, meaning devoted,</p>
<p>speed and power work or strength work.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t been disciplined</p>
<p>about not doing certain forms of exercise,</p>
<p>I could see how the whole thing could crash quickly</p>
<p>and one could think, oh, this is just too much work</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s not for me.</p>
<p>So this, I suppose, is now where the question comes,</p>
<p>which is what are some of the key points</p>
<p>that people need to keep in mind</p>
<p>when they embrace a program?</p>
<p>How rigidly do they need to stay attached to,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s endurance day, I&rsquo;m just doing endurance.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s strength day, I&rsquo;m just doing strength work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to take things</p>
<p>to absolute failure or beyond failure.</p>
<p>I am absolutely happy with anyone modifying</p>
<p>any of the sample programs, however they would like to.</p>
<p>My only recommendation for the question you just posed</p>
<p>would be set your program</p>
<p>and then if you&rsquo;re going to make a change, fine,</p>
<p>but that is a change to your program.</p>
<p>In other words, don&rsquo;t just make decisions</p>
<p>every single day and make changes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing that, you might as well not have a program</p>
<p>and as we described earlier, there is clear evidence</p>
<p>that having a program is better than not,</p>
<p>regardless of the effectiveness of the program</p>
<p>and so my general comment to that is,</p>
<p>okay, fine, a day or two, you made some modifications.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a situation now where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically changing the workout every day as you go.</p>
<p>Then we just need to write a new program.</p>
<p>We need to reassess where we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>because we need to have some structure.</p>
<p>But the reality of it is, I change the programming</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do the day of often</p>
<p>because of any number of situations,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>
<p>I way overestimated today.</p>
<p>We talked a little bit in a previous episode</p>
<p>about auto-regulation, which is a style of periodization</p>
<p>and program design, which you&rsquo;re adjusting</p>
<p>based on how you&rsquo;re actually feeling that day,</p>
<p>but with some specific structure.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna take some measurements that day</p>
<p>and adjust, so auto-regulation is a very,</p>
<p>very effective tool.</p>
<p>You just need to make sure that that auto is dialed.</p>
<p>In other words, is it because your body</p>
<p>actually needed something different</p>
<p>or is it because you&rsquo;re now just getting a little bit lazy?</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re just not feeling like it today.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a little bit of an impossible line to draw there.</p>
<p>Both scenarios are real, gray area.</p>
<p>A lot is real in the moment.</p>
<p>And so you just need to be a little bit aware</p>
<p>of having some reality check, listening to your body,</p>
<p>but then also being like, hey, no, I&rsquo;m talking to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you this is the plan, we&rsquo;re going to do this</p>
<p>and staying within it.</p>
<p>It is going to be challenging to progressively overload</p>
<p>and therefore get a higher likelihood of success</p>
<p>at your training program.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just making decisions and changing the program</p>
<p>right before you work out, you&rsquo;re probably not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going, for most people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably going to choose less or off</p>
<p>more so than you choose more.</p>
<p>Now, having said that, there are more than a few clients</p>
<p>that have come through our programs</p>
<p>where they choose more always.</p>
<p>They add a set, they add an exercise,</p>
<p>they add another workout and that can be okay,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going to track various markers on them.</p>
<p>And if we see these things consistently going down,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to identify whether they are,</p>
<p>which phase of this overtraining thing we&rsquo;ll talk about next</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually in.</p>
<p>Some phases I&rsquo;m okay, some of them I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re seeing certain things happen physiologically,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to make a conversation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also then going to really think carefully</p>
<p>about why are you making this choice?</p>
<p>Do you feel like the training isn&rsquo;t enough?</p>
<p>Okay, great, well, let&rsquo;s modify it then.</p>
<p>Are you not making progress?</p>
<p>Or are there some other reasons why you&rsquo;re doing this?</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m not a psychologist or therapist,</p>
<p>but there are clearly situations in which folks</p>
<p>and dose themselves with far too much exercise</p>
<p>for reasons that are not</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s productive to their training or goals.</p>
<p>And if such case, we would probably bring in somebody</p>
<p>that specializes in those areas to clear that out</p>
<p>and just make sure it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not doing this for anxiety issues or energy things.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s, I just don&rsquo;t think the program&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>Okay, great, let&rsquo;s go back.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at our metrics.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s evaluate our tests and go there.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s other reasons,</p>
<p>then we may bring in somebody to have that conversation.</p>
<p>Usually when I&rsquo;ve seen people deviate from programs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because they tend to revert to something</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve done for a long time.</p>
<p>It just feels really comfortable to them.</p>
<p>And it worked.</p>
<p>And it was giving them decent results.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re skeptical to try something else.</p>
<p>Or there is a phenotype of kind of haphazardness sometimes,</p>
<p>especially if people get really caffeinated</p>
<p>before workout and just want to throw something in.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a third category.</p>
<p>And this is one that I&rsquo;ve had to contend with a lot</p>
<p>in my life, which is that I really enjoy training</p>
<p>with other people when I have the opportunity.</p>
<p>And a certain day rolls around</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re supposed to do something</p>
<p>and not do other things.</p>
<p>And people say, hey, do you want to go for a long ocean swim</p>
<p>or you want to train?</p>
<p>And you end up doing some, you know,</p>
<p>Kenny Kane, this one&rsquo;s for you,</p>
<p>some ridiculous, you know, 20 wall ball,</p>
<p>CrossFit type workout.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not acclimated for that sort of thing.</p>
<p>And then it does tend to throw things off.</p>
<p>Not because, no pun intended, Kenny,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with a 20 sets of wall balls</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s part of your conditioning.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s not appropriate for where you are</p>
<p>in your schedule, it really can disrupt</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>Even as a non-competitive athlete like myself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s years since I&rsquo;ve competed in any athletic program,</p>
<p>but as a non-competitive athlete,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a beauty to,</p>
<p>and a really strong incentive to being disciplined</p>
<p>about the program that one follows.</p>
<p>As a mentor and professor that I worked with years ago</p>
<p>used to say, I&rsquo;d come into his office,</p>
<p>all these ideas and things I want to do.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d say, let&rsquo;s constrain this walk.</p>
<p>And then, you know, the question you always want to arrive</p>
<p>at in a discussion with your students, as you know,</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s the experiment exactly?</p>
<p>And then you go and you do that specific experiment.</p>
<p>I think I view a workout the same way,</p>
<p>that there are multiple adaptations, goals,</p>
<p>and things that people are trying to achieve,</p>
<p>really knowing why you&rsquo;re there each time</p>
<p>and really sticking to that.</p>
<p>Even if it means not training with other people,</p>
<p>or I always say, well, you can train with me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not going to train with you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one way to do it.</p>
<p>But really sticking to a schedule</p>
<p>is really what allows the progress to emerge.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean being antisocial.</p>
<p>You can invite people along,</p>
<p>but in this case, I&rsquo;m telling people to be the host,</p>
<p>not the guest.</p>
<p>I have a little bit of a rule here.</p>
<p>Maybe I should answer your question this way.</p>
<p>I actually like doing things totally different occasionally.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll do, when I&rsquo;m traveling,</p>
<p>I tend to do hotel workouts.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is,</p>
<p>I will go down to the workout room</p>
<p>and I will do a set of 10 to 15 reps</p>
<p>of every single machine in the exact order</p>
<p>in which they are laid out.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Just for the sake of fun.</p>
<p>Like just for the sake of like, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the tarot card version of workouts.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>Like whatever comes up, I&rsquo;m going to make sense of it.</p>
<p>And you just move.</p>
<p>And those are typically things of like,</p>
<p>I just want to move a little bit for jet lag</p>
<p>and other sort of purposes, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s often like, I wasn&rsquo;t going to get to workout today.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m going to do something to feel great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t travel that much though.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not really throwing my things off.</p>
<p>I also, I don&rsquo;t get a lot of free time.</p>
<p>And so if I am traveling</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m seeing someone I haven&rsquo;t seen in many years</p>
<p>or for the first time,</p>
<p>I mean, we got to train together this week for the first time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to burn that opportunity.</p>
<p>My rule is this though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to cost me more than three days.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m absolutely happy to get out there</p>
<p>and maybe tomorrow morning or tonight,</p>
<p>we go do something fun that&rsquo;s off my schedule.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in, I&rsquo;m in a hundred percent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to down regulate a little bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to maybe do as much as you</p>
<p>or as hard as you or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do more than I should.</p>
<p>But if it costs me tomorrow, it was worth the exchange.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a world record I&rsquo;m setting anytime soon.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have, I got many years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to give up a couple of days of exercise</p>
<p>and be a little sore than I need to be</p>
<p>for the exchange of a lifetime memory.</p>
<p>And this stuff is so important to me.</p>
<p>This stuff lands is like true lifetime memory.</p>
<p>So I can look back.</p>
<p>Many of my fond memories from my life</p>
<p>are our training sessions with friends,</p>
<p>whatever it is, like doing jujitsu</p>
<p>with somebody who&rsquo;s a world champion.</p>
<p>We just like totally, whatever the thing is, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, that was really, really cool.</p>
<p>Absolutely worth missing two days.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s going to be more than three days though,</p>
<p>where like, I&rsquo;m going to be so wrecked.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t work out for five or six days.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m probably like, all right, that&rsquo;s kind of nonsense.</p>
<p>Unless it&rsquo;s just like an opportunity where I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I absolutely can&rsquo;t pass up, you know?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of how I think about it.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t happen too often with me though,</p>
<p>maybe once a month.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m like, okay, I&rsquo;m fine, I lost a day.</p>
<p>Reality of it is, it&rsquo;s probably more like once a quarter</p>
<p>that that happens, so I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>So you do want to balance joy and life.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be so rigid about your training program</p>
<p>that it ruins and robs those experience.</p>
<p>Physical activity should be fun.</p>
<p>Your fitness and your training should be something</p>
<p>that makes your life better, not some task</p>
<p>you have to get done so that 75 years from now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve hit some metric of who knows what.</p>
<p>Just alone in your room with your training logs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, in all seriousness,</p>
<p>I think you point to the richness of life</p>
<p>and you can draw these boxes like work,</p>
<p>relationships, fitness, recovery,</p>
<p>but the boundaries between those boxes are blurry</p>
<p>because, and I should say, I love training with you.</p>
<p>I greatly enjoyed training with you this morning,</p>
<p>not just because I was receiving so many useful tips.</p>
<p>In fact, thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve PR&rsquo;d in a number of things today.</p>
<p>Thanks to your input in the moment,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a replaceable kind of gift,</p>
<p>but mostly it&rsquo;s the gift of getting to train</p>
<p>with a colleague and friend.</p>
<p>So I want to underscore, highlight,</p>
<p>and put an exclamation mark behind what you just said.</p>
<p>Thank you once again and again</p>
<p>for giving us so much interesting, clear, actionable,</p>
<p>and at times somewhat counterintuitive information</p>
<p>in order to build out an exceptional training program</p>
<p>to meet any of, and in some cases,</p>
<p>all of the nine major adaptations that exercise can create</p>
<p>toward aesthetic, performance-related,</p>
<p>and healthspan-lifespan, aka longevity goals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really a treasure trove of information there.</p>
<p>And I look forward to our next discussion</p>
<p>about how to best recover from exercise,</p>
<p>both within the exercise bout and between exercise bouts,</p>
<p>and in the more macroscopic structure</p>
<p>of a week, a month, a year.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t wait either.</p>
<p>I love that topic and I&rsquo;ve got a lot to cover,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;ll be fun.</p>
