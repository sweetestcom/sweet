    <p>All right, everybody, welcome to 2023. Everybody&rsquo;s well rested</p>
<p>and ready to take on 2023. Yes, Jamal. How was your break?</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Okay, sexy poo. I know you don&rsquo;t go to temperatures that are</p>
<p>under 57 degrees anymore. Do you have a nice break? Did you go</p>
<p>somewhere warm?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a confirmation. Wow, man of so many words. And</p>
<p>freeberg.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m over cold weather vacations.</p>
<p>Yeah, that does happen at a certain point.</p>
<p>I actually went to Florida went to the free state of Florida.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Yes. Well, what&rsquo;s going on in Florida at the turn</p>
<p>of the new year? I wonder that drew you down to the great state</p>
<p>of Florida.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just freeing it up in the free state of Florida.</p>
<p>We have our 2023 predictions. Now, play some music and all that</p>
<p>kind of stuff. Producer Nick at this point. Let&rsquo;s get to it.</p>
<p>Last year, we did.</p>
<p>Do you guys notice that every time we talk about something</p>
<p>somewhere between sort of two months to a year later, the Wall</p>
<p>Street Journal ends up writing a big piece about it. Think piece</p>
<p>about it. Yeah. So I tweeted into the group chat, like last</p>
<p>year, we all talked about Sequoia and distributing public</p>
<p>equities and how it&rsquo;s very fraught and difficult. And then</p>
<p>today, they write this big article about how people have</p>
<p>just burned enormous amounts of billions of dollars that they</p>
<p>could have returned to LPS like these venture investors by not</p>
<p>distributing. It makes sense. Three weeks ago, when we did</p>
<p>our end of the year wrap up, my big winner for 2022 were the pot</p>
<p>shops, right, Citadel. And today, in the Wall Street</p>
<p>Journal, an article lands that these guys with 56 billion of a</p>
<p>um, over the last two years have made almost $45 billion of</p>
<p>revenues. Isn&rsquo;t that incredible?</p>
<p>And this is what happens to math. Usually,</p>
<p>they are, these guys are just crushing it. And Citadel</p>
<p>securities did like almost, you know, seven and a half billion</p>
<p>of revenue. I mean, it&rsquo;s unbelievable these businesses</p>
<p>how good they are. Yes. So let&rsquo;s get into this is typical.</p>
<p>Chamath, if you think about journalists, they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>get into the conversations that are occurring at the bar after</p>
<p>the event, the late night conversation, the group chats,</p>
<p>well, and that&rsquo;s what this podcast is. It&rsquo;s the exposed</p>
<p>back channel, right. And so if you listen to this pod, you got</p>
<p>the back channel of Silicon Valley, politics, tech, science,</p>
<p>etc. So let&rsquo;s do our predictions. In 2020, we said</p>
<p>our biggest political winner would be sacks. And I both said</p>
<p>to Santa&rsquo;s Chamath says Xi Jinping and Freiburg said,</p>
<p>Putin, who do we think is our biggest political winner going</p>
<p>forward? Who do you pick sacks biggest political winner for</p>
<p>2023? Who will be your biggest political winner for 2023?</p>
<p>Well, I went a little bit outside the box here, because I</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re gonna have gridlock in Washington. So I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>expecting a ton to be coming out of Washington over the next</p>
<p>year. My pick for biggest political winner is Asian</p>
<p>American college applicants. There are two Supreme Court</p>
<p>decisions that the court heard on Halloween last year, there</p>
<p>was a lawsuit against Harvard and a another lawsuit against</p>
<p>UNC by a group called students for fair admissions, and that</p>
<p>they maintain that Harvard and UNC violate title six, the Civil</p>
<p>Rights Act, because Asian American applicants are far less</p>
<p>likely to be admitted than similarly qualified applicants</p>
<p>from other groups. And the federal courts in Boston and</p>
<p>North Carolina rejected this argument, but the Supreme Court</p>
<p>took up the cases. So they kind of went out of their way to hear</p>
<p>this. And I think that they are going to, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>primitive action, I think the majority will rule to strike</p>
<p>down these policies that really discriminate against Asian</p>
<p>Americans. And I think they&rsquo;re the last group in America where</p>
<p>it seems to be okay to discriminate against. And I</p>
<p>think the Supreme Court is gonna, is gonna find that</p>
<p>unconstitutional.</p>
<p>To my authentic thoughts there, you have brought this up</p>
<p>multiple times on the podcast over the last two years.</p>
<p>I have said that this was unfortunately, affirmative</p>
<p>action when it started, I think had very, very good intentions.</p>
<p>And I still think that there&rsquo;s a place for it. The problem is</p>
<p>that these very liberal institutions decided to play</p>
<p>judge, jury and executioner on which minorities counted in</p>
<p>affirmative action. And that&rsquo;s not what the intention was. The</p>
<p>intention was to look at the establishment and their ability</p>
<p>to get their progeny into these incredible schools, even when</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t deserve to be there. And so I think this was always</p>
<p>an issue of classism that was disguised as racism. And people</p>
<p>who are in the upper classes of society have always had an edge.</p>
<p>You had the legacy admissions into Harvard, you had people,</p>
<p>the Kushners very famously, right, like the $5 million check</p>
<p>from the father that got the son into the school, all of this</p>
<p>stuff, it&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s been well written about. And whether or</p>
<p>not those things are right isn&rsquo;t the point. I think the point is</p>
<p>that there are folks in emerging, lower middle classes</p>
<p>who have the potential to crush. And those kids should have a</p>
<p>chance. And you can&rsquo;t just decide who those kids are based</p>
<p>on the color of their skin. And in this case, what happened was</p>
<p>some blacks were still allowed in some Hispanics were allowed</p>
<p>in but Asian Americans broadly were discriminated. And that was</p>
<p>a really stupid outcome. You cannot punish kids for willing</p>
<p>to work their ass off. And I think that that was the</p>
<p>unfortunate outcome of what affirmative action has become by</p>
<ol start="2022">
<li>So it is going to get repealed. The reason it&rsquo;s going</li>
</ol>
<p>to get repealed is that, you know, we have case law that very</p>
<p>clearly states that any institution that accepts federal</p>
<p>funds cannot have any form of discrimination. And this is how</p>
<p>these folks who have tried to repeal affirmative action have</p>
<p>taken up this lawsuit. And hopefully the outcome is a more</p>
<p>meritocratic system that also tries to create a plurality of</p>
<p>different people from different backgrounds. freeburger, any</p>
<p>thoughts? And if not, your biggest political winner for</p>
<p>2023.</p>
<p>My biggest political winner for 2023 is MBS. Mohammed bin</p>
<p>Salman. I think that Saudi Arabia will have the most</p>
<p>important year in kind of the modern era in terms of their</p>
<p>role. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw this Reuters report from a</p>
<p>few weeks ago, but there&rsquo;s kind of a deepening discussion about</p>
<p>the oil yuan trade, in that Saudi would sell oil to China</p>
<p>and they would get paid in one Saudi Arabia sits at the</p>
<p>intersection of the United States, Russia and China, they</p>
<p>have relationships with all three nations. And in the kind</p>
<p>of conflict and power struggle that is underway, I think that</p>
<p>ultimately, the direction of where global currency kind of</p>
<p>reserves will be taken, and the importance of these great</p>
<p>nations and who sits atop whom can actually be dictated and</p>
<p>significantly influenced by MBS this year, by some of the deals</p>
<p>and trades he might put in place and the kind of partnerships he</p>
<p>might forge. I think as a result, you will see him kind of</p>
<p>rise in terms of influence, not in terms of, you know, hey, the</p>
<p>world has accolades for this for this guy. But I think in terms</p>
<p>of global influence, he will rocket ship to kind of the top</p>
<p>because of this, this kind of jockeying he can now do between</p>
<p>these three great nation states, and defining, you know, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen with the US and what&rsquo;s going to happen with</p>
<p>China and what&rsquo;s going to happen great selection of currency</p>
<p>reserves. Great selection. I mean,</p>
<p>great selection.</p>
<p>The shitty thing, by the way, about your selection is that</p>
<p>Biden, our explicit stance is unfortunately quite</p>
<p>confrontational with MBS. And yeah, you saw that play out in</p>
<p>q4. We asked them to ease up on OPEC plus to introduce supply</p>
<p>cuts, and they did some nominal 100,000 barrel per day cut</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do much of anything. There was an article to your</p>
<p>point freeberg just recently, about Saudi really doubling</p>
<p>down on getting the oil out of the ground and monetizing their</p>
<p>petrochemicals. So there&rsquo;s just going to be a glut of supply in</p>
<p>the market. And we have the least amount of influence with</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia than we&rsquo;ve ever had. And it seems like we could</p>
<p>change that if we decided to, but I think Biden has taken this</p>
<p>very confrontational approach, which doesn&rsquo;t seem to make a</p>
<p>lot of sense.</p>
<p>Their stated intent is to diversify away from oil, and</p>
<p>into technology and other kind of emerging growth economies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they funded the vision fund. That&rsquo;s why MBS made</p>
<p>that big kind of visit to Silicon Valley a few years ago.</p>
<p>And there is technology that they want to import into Saudi</p>
<p>Arabia, they want to have ownership in around the world.</p>
<p>And if the US is creating a barrier for them to import us</p>
<p>tech into Saudi or for Saudi to kind of invest in the US, but</p>
<p>China and Russia have open arms. And all they want is for Saudi</p>
<p>to start doing trades and you want, it&rsquo;s going to happen. And</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where this guy has kind of a real opportunity</p>
<p>to shift the global economic dynamic.</p>
<p>Say what you will about Trump. He had open dialogue with North</p>
<p>Korea, China, Russia, and the enemies close. Sure want to be</p>
<p>able to talk to anybody and he was able to talk to anybody. Now</p>
<p>you also want to be able to say, Hey, listen, you can&rsquo;t dismember</p>
<p>a journalist like Khashoggi and you need to be able to have both</p>
<p>of those ideas in your head. You can&rsquo;t be rigid in foreign</p>
<p>policy, you have to be fluid and keep people at the table</p>
<p>talking Chamath, who is your big political? Who do you predict</p>
<p>will be the big political winner of 2023? Chamath&rsquo;s prediction,</p>
<p>everybody? Go ahead.</p>
<p>I really like spread trades, right? Where you go long</p>
<p>something and short another. So I&rsquo;d like to pair my biggest</p>
<p>political winner with my biggest political loser for 2023. Okay.</p>
<p>And I am going to focus on the Republican nomination. And I am</p>
<p>going to go long. Nikki Haley, and I&rsquo;m going to go short, Ron</p>
<p>DeSantis. Now let me</p>
<p>sex again, if you if you&rsquo;re watching, you&rsquo;re not watching</p>
<p>sex right now, he is ready to interject, go to Martha.</p>
<p>So I think that all of this nonsense, for example, in the</p>
<p>house speaker race, all of the midterm results, what it really</p>
<p>speaks to our people are getting exhausted with the lunatic</p>
<p>fringes of both parties. That&rsquo;s point number one. And point so</p>
<p>that favors moderates as an emergent class. And point number</p>
<p>two is that if you look back through many, many cycles of</p>
<p>Republican and Democratic nominations, it is a very</p>
<p>negative thing to be in the lead so early going into the Iowa</p>
<p>caucuses in January. And so if you put those two things</p>
<p>together, the risk is that DeSantis decays, things emerge</p>
<p>people attack him because he&rsquo;s the clear front runner. And the</p>
<p>opportunity just like it was for Trump in 16, or for Clinton,</p>
<p>or for George Bush, not Herbert Walker, but you know, w is to</p>
<p>emerge from the back. And so if I think about a moderate person</p>
<p>who can emerge from the back, who can consolidate the ranks,</p>
<p>they should probably be from the south, they will have a lot of</p>
<p>these purple compromises that sacks mentioned in their policy</p>
<p>program. And they will have a history of winning and a history</p>
<p>of normalcy. And so I think that of all of the places where you</p>
<p>could ever elect a woman as President of the United States,</p>
<p>I think it will come from the Republicans before it comes from</p>
<p>the Democrats. I mean, the Democrats are unfortunately</p>
<p>increasingly judgmental. And I think it&rsquo;s very difficult for a</p>
<p>woman to emerge there. But I do think that Nikki Haley has a</p>
<p>shot. So I&rsquo;m going to go long Nikki Haley. And I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>short Ron DeSantis.</p>
<p>Okay, I like it a spread trade for his prediction. Well done</p>
<p>before sacks you interject, let me just do mine. And because</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll have to interject to I was looking at Biden and Trump</p>
<p>and thinking, hmm, which one of these is going to have the big</p>
<p>win in 2023. So the two biggest I think, players, I have a</p>
<p>prediction for Trump. I think he&rsquo;s going to lose 50 pounds on</p>
<p>the ozempic. Everybody loves a weight loss story. I think he is</p>
<p>going to be indicted by Garland. Is he on? Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Sorry, he&rsquo;s on ozempic. No, I&rsquo;m predicting an ozempic run. And</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to drop 4050 pounds. Then we&rsquo;re going to have a</p>
<p>svelte. Trump get indicted by Garland. And the debates and the</p>
<p>and the and the rigmarole with DeSantis, I think he&rsquo;s gonna go</p>
<p>after DeSantis based on weight and height. And then he&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to win the nomination in 24. And we&rsquo;re gonna have Trump versus</p>
<p>Biden. But this is a crazy prediction here. I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have a settlement. I think he&rsquo;s going to agree to not</p>
<p>run and get the pardon. This is a crazy prediction. I know. But I</p>
<p>think he loses the weight. He wins the nom. He gets indicted.</p>
<p>And then he gets the Richard Nixon pardon, global pardon for</p>
<p>all of the shit he&rsquo;s done. Saks, you can reply to these two crazy</p>
<p>predictions as much right in my</p>
<p>I mean, this is like proof positive that everything you</p>
<p>have to say about Trump is an act of projection. I mean, like</p>
<p>ozempic. I mean, are you talking about yourself or Trump?</p>
<p>Strike. Boom.</p>
<p>He has been ozempic and super good. Yes. Both of those things</p>
<p>are fasting. Have you sacked on any ozempic?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried it.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think everybody should be looking into this if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>have weight issues. It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a great new</p>
<p>I would say it even more broadly. I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot</p>
<p>about these GLP ones. And I got to tell you, statins are a clear</p>
<p>wonder drug. Yes. Okay. I think that the 50 year longitudinal</p>
<p>data on its value is pretty unimpeachable. Metformin even</p>
<p>taken prophylactically has shown incredible benefits for cell</p>
<p>regeneration, longevity, and glucose management. And the</p>
<p>real look, the reality is, let&rsquo;s just take a step back. The</p>
<p>American diet, we&rsquo;re all pre diabetic. Okay, so let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just not beat around the bush. The way that Americans eat</p>
<p>and our food supply, and also probably in Western Europe, is</p>
<p>pre diabetic by definition, it&rsquo;s shit, it&rsquo;s trash. So metformin</p>
<p>makes a lot of sense. And again, it&rsquo;s longitudinal data is</p>
<p>incredible. But I got to tell you, the early data on these GLP</p>
<p>ones are unbelievable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extraordinary. And I can tell you from firsthand</p>
<p>experience, I would lose half a pound a week, when I would die</p>
<p>it. No, but what I&rsquo;m saying is, it&rsquo;s beyond that. And what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about is insulin response. It&rsquo;s cardiac health.</p>
<p>And so if this data tracks like this, man, you just want to put</p>
<p>everybody on these GLP. Well, I just want to also put a</p>
<p>disclaimer out here, do your own research, work with your</p>
<p>doctors, whether it&rsquo;s for metformin, or a Zempik, but I</p>
<p>had great results on it. I recommend if you&rsquo;re struggling</p>
<p>with weight loss, like I did for many years, you talk to your</p>
<p>doctor about it. That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s not a commercial for what Govia</p>
<p>or Zempik, but I do think these things are going to change the</p>
<p>world. Well, and they&rsquo;re getting better. And it seems like</p>
<p>people with diabetes are on them for life. So if your question is</p>
<p>like, if I could do this for a year to lose weight, you know, I</p>
<p>think diabetics are on it for life. So when I made my decision,</p>
<p>again, work with your doctors, not random podcast or venture</p>
<p>capitalists for your health advice. I was like, well, all of</p>
<p>these people who have diabetes are going to on it for years,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s non toxic, go get a prenuvo scan. Just make sure</p>
<p>absolutely you got. So there you have it. Those are our</p>
<p>predictions. So if you want to respond to any, I want to I want</p>
<p>the sacks to react to my spread trade.</p>
<p>Yeah. So look, I think, you know, if you&rsquo;re going on a</p>
<p>betting site, I think that you could place that bet that</p>
<p>Chamath made pretty cheaply, and probably it&rsquo;s like has some good</p>
<p>upside to it. So I don&rsquo;t criticize it as a bet. Do I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s actually going to happen? No. And I think the</p>
<p>reason is, is this that if you look at what&rsquo;s happening right</p>
<p>now with the speaker&rsquo;s race, there&rsquo;s two very clear wings in</p>
<p>the Republican Party, there&rsquo;s the establishment wing, and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of this populist MAGA wing. And the candidate,</p>
<p>whoever it is, in 24 needs to unite those two wings. And I</p>
<p>think this is really the best argument for DeSantis is he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>widely accepted by both. I think Nikki Haley&rsquo;s problem is that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s very well regarded within the establishment wing of the</p>
<p>Republican Party, but she has no meaningful support within the</p>
<p>populist wing. And so I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s capable of bringing</p>
<p>the party together, at least at this point in time, she would</p>
<p>have to prove let&rsquo;s call it populist bona fides that she</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t have right now. So this is why I think you know,</p>
<p>DeSantis, he does have front runner risk. You&rsquo;re right that</p>
<p>people are going to keep taking shots at him, as long as he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the front runner, but all right, let&rsquo;s be capable of uniting the</p>
<p>party in a way that it desperately needs right now, as</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing with the Kevin McCarthy thing playing out.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay, let&rsquo;s go for our biggest losers. We&rsquo;ll rip</p>
<p>through this last year. I said Biden and Trump and the</p>
<p>extremes. Chamath said the progressive left again, the</p>
<p>extreme sack said Pelosi, who just wrapped up her tenure and</p>
<p>Freeberg said US influence globally was the biggest</p>
<p>political loser. Let&rsquo;s get our predictions for the biggest</p>
<p>political loser of 2023. Freeberg, who do you think will</p>
<p>be the biggest political loser of 2023? The world wants to know</p>
<p>freeberg.</p>
<p>I would continue my US influence, but I am going to</p>
<p>shift. Here&rsquo;s what I think is going to happen this year. My</p>
<p>big prediction is based on I think the world has too much</p>
<p>debt. I think that the economic slowdown coupled with rising</p>
<p>interest rates globally and a dearth of kind of asset capital</p>
<p>inflows means that there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of issues with a</p>
<p>number of debt markets around the world, particularly kind of</p>
<p>emerging sovereign debt. Just to give you guys a sense global</p>
<p>debt is about $235 trillion in public and private. You know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s somewhere between five and $15 trillion of interest</p>
<p>payments a year, depending on what the net rate is on $96</p>
<p>trillion global GDP. And there&rsquo;s another trillion and a half of</p>
<p>unfunded liabilities in the US and pensions and Social Security</p>
<p>and all this other stuff. I think this is the year where a</p>
<p>lot of the debt markets start to unravel. The primary entity that</p>
<p>steps in, or a political loser, I&rsquo;m going to tell it one second.</p>
<p>This is a political Yeah, so the political ramifications. So the</p>
<p>political ramifications for me, I think that the, the entity</p>
<p>that steps in to try and support these unwinding moments is the</p>
<p>IMF. And I think that no matter what the IMF does, they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to look bad. I think that the, you know, it&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>like Jerome Powell, this this past year, right? Like, you</p>
<p>raised rates too late, you raise rates too quickly, no matter</p>
<p>what you do, it has some adverse effect and impact. It&rsquo;s either</p>
<p>inflationary, or it impacts growth. And so I think the IMF</p>
<p>is going to get a lot of heat for either acting not too soon,</p>
<p>or sorry, not fast enough, or, or acting too aggressively and</p>
<p>causing inflation, as a bunch of these markets face credit</p>
<p>risk this year. So my big bet is the IMF is going to play a major</p>
<p>role. And we&rsquo;re going to be talking a lot about the IMF</p>
<p>later this year, I think as a result, the IMF will get a lot</p>
<p>of heat, and you&rsquo;ll end up seeing a lot of pressure and</p>
<p>political, you know, just like we blame NATO, just like we</p>
<p>blame, Jerome Powell, and the Fed will end up blaming the IMF</p>
<p>for a bunch of problems that will arise. But the natural</p>
<p>physics of what&rsquo;s going on is the world has too much debt and</p>
<p>not enough growth to cover the debt, the cost of debt, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Okay, and the IMF will be the political kind of, you know, hit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll that&rsquo;ll result a little complicated of a point of view.</p>
<p>But I think, yeah.</p>
<p>And who do you have, as your biggest political loser</p>
<p>prediction for 2023? Mr. David Sachs?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, Kevin McCarthy may not survive the week. So let me</p>
<p>go in a different direction. I think California is my big</p>
<p>political loser. And I would say in particular, the city of San</p>
<p>Francisco, both are going to have gigantic budget shortfalls.</p>
<p>So you may remember that this is back in 2021. When we had</p>
<p>that asset bubble, California had a surplus of 76 billion.</p>
<p>And then insane. And then 2022 happened. And now the state is</p>
<p>looking at a $24 billion deficit. Well, if we had taken</p>
<p>say, a third of that surplus from 21 and put it in a rainy</p>
<p>day fund, we wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about this deficit. But</p>
<p>that was never done. Newsom started handing that money out</p>
<p>like candy to the electorate to goose his election, his reelect</p>
<p>numbers and to get him past the that recall, remember, okay, so</p>
<p>the state never got a fiscal outlook in order. And now I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s going to be even worse in 2023. And San Francisco,</p>
<p>the city, very similar kind of problem where its tax base is</p>
<p>heavily dependent on commercial real estate, which is really</p>
<p>suffering. So you know, the city of San Francisco in the state of</p>
<p>California, they&rsquo;ve moved their tax base to, to highly volatile</p>
<p>capital gains. And with a really lousy stock market, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how these guys gonna meet their budgets. So a lot of pain is</p>
<p>gonna be a lot of austerity and pain coming. That&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>And these people do not know how to manage a budget. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>incompetent. So you say California freebirds as IMF</p>
<p>Chamath, who do you think the biggest political loser for</p>
<p>2023 will be already gave us your prediction. Okay, and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>in alignment with you. I think to Santa&rsquo;s peaked a little too</p>
<p>early and the forever Trumpers and the in the chaos is going to</p>
<p>be a little too much for him to handle. Okay, now we get into</p>
<p>what everybody wants business, business, business, biggest</p>
<p>business winner for 2023. Who do you have Chamath for your</p>
<p>biggest, biggest business winner of 2023?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pick something out of my portfolio. I think I&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>only non trivially large investor in both SpaceX and</p>
<p>relativity space. Relativity space has a huge SpaceX is</p>
<p>clearly just crushing on all cylinders. And they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>the only game in town with respect to launch capability.</p>
<p>And if you just Google it, you&rsquo;ll see that the Europeans,</p>
<p>you know, have a hit or miss capability and launch, the</p>
<p>Russians are completely unable to do launch now because of all</p>
<p>of these sanctions. The private companies in New Zealand or the</p>
<p>United States have also had fits and starts really</p>
<p>incapable. Relativity, which is really which is now the second</p>
<p>most highly valued space business is about to do a launch</p>
<p>in the third week of January. And the big difference between</p>
<p>it and SpaceX, which is sort of why we did it. This is a early</p>
<p>YC company, I did the series A and kind of went along the whole</p>
<p>way. They have 3d printed everything. And the reason why</p>
<p>3d printing is interesting is you take a so if you if you</p>
<p>think a rocket costs $5 billion, if built by NASA, Elon was able</p>
<p>to take that to 100 to 500 million. And if you 3d print</p>
<p>everything, you can take that cost to like five to 50 million.</p>
<p>And so it allows you to just have this repeatability and</p>
<p>manufacturability. Now SpaceX also has a lot of 3d printed</p>
<p>parts, but relativity is entirely 3d printed. It has a</p>
<p>launch in three weeks at Cape Canaveral, I think. And we have</p>
<p>a like a $10 billion order book that gets unlocked. So I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to see beyond a lot of these market forecasts right</p>
<p>now. So I&rsquo;d rather pick a company, I&rsquo;ll pick something in</p>
<p>my portfolio, if the rocket does not blow up, there&rsquo;s a $10</p>
<p>billion order book. And this company is now on a trajectory</p>
<p>to be as valued as basic. And if it doesn&rsquo;t his book times two,</p>
<p>and if it doesn&rsquo;t, it goes to zero.</p>
<p>Freiburg, go ahead and talk your book times two or three. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see if you can one up Jamal. Which one of your investments</p>
<p>will be the biggest business winner of 2023? Freiburg?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an investor. My big bet is open AI. It&rsquo;s just way too</p>
<p>obvious to be anything else this year. As you guys know, there</p>
<p>are dozens of startups that are being started right now, based</p>
<p>on an open AI demonstration of Dolly and chat GPT. I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing this in the enterprise and consumer markets.</p>
<p>I think open AI will become to some degree, maybe they could</p>
<p>be as many paths they could take the AWS, providing tooling and</p>
<p>infrastructure to all these startups that are building</p>
<p>applications for consumers and business users. Or they will end</p>
<p>up doing a massive deal with Microsoft, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inevitable, they&rsquo;re going to get a billion dollar plus investment</p>
<p>this year, they could power, you know, AI driven Bing search and</p>
<p>voice driven search. They could build their own products and</p>
<p>their own tools. And they&rsquo;re becoming great investors. They</p>
<p>invested in D script, which is a product company we use here for</p>
<p>our podcast, which is an incredible product. And I think</p>
<p>that Sam Altman is a very smart and shrewd investor as well. So</p>
<p>for a lot of reasons, I think open AI could end up having an</p>
<p>amazing year this year and a lot of different paths they could</p>
<p>walk and we&rsquo;re going to come out of this year and say they&rsquo;re one</p>
<p>of the top tech companies in the valley.</p>
<p>Okay, sacks. Open AI has, of course, increased your ability</p>
<p>to talk to other humans. So you&rsquo;re seeing a lot of big wins</p>
<p>there. I know. He&rsquo;s, how do I talk to a child about their</p>
<p>college hopes and aspirations?</p>
<p>No, no, no. How do I talk to a child about their day?</p>
<p>Hello, hello, progeny of mine. How are you faring today in this</p>
<p>complicated</p>
<p>write me a script of talking to a 12 year old about their hopes</p>
<p>and dreams.</p>
<p>Say interesting using GPT for talking points on different</p>
<p>topics. We should try that for the pod, you know? Oh, okay,</p>
<p>here we go. We should have done the GPT predictions. That would</p>
<p>be a great answer for each of these categories.</p>
<p>sacks as a person on the spectrum. I&rsquo;m a big fan of</p>
<p>sacks as a person on the spectrum. Yeah, how delightful</p>
<p>is this chat GPT and you know, your treatment of your</p>
<p>condition?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great. Let me let me get to my answer here. So my answer for</p>
<p>the big business winner of the year is America&rsquo;s natural gas</p>
<p>industry. And I have to admit, this is an aspect of the</p>
<p>Ukrainian war that I didn&rsquo;t fully appreciate until I read</p>
<p>this New York Times article the other day about how natural gas</p>
<p>prices in Europe have now fallen to the level they&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>before the war and everyone thought that there&rsquo;d be this</p>
<p>huge shortage, and they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to heat their homes.</p>
<p>Well, what happened? The answer is that Europe completely cut</p>
<p>off their dependence on Russian gas. And in fact, the Nord</p>
<p>Stream pipelines were blown up. So physically, they separated.</p>
<p>But then on top of it, they basically started importing</p>
<p>liquefied natural gas from the US. And here&rsquo;s the key paragraph</p>
<p>in this article from the New York Times is that Europe</p>
<p>rapidly built terminals to receive liquefied gas, sweeping</p>
<p>away many of the usual bureaucratic obstacles, and</p>
<p>environmental objections. So in other words, what would normally</p>
<p>would have taken decades to get approvals, now was all put on a</p>
<p>fast track. And Europe is now completely dependent on American</p>
<p>natural gas. And I think this is the again, the thing maybe I</p>
<p>underestimated the cold hard American interest in this war is</p>
<p>to basically turn Europe into a vassal of America&rsquo;s natural gas</p>
<p>industry. Previously, they were about to be dependent on Russia</p>
<p>and Nord Stream was going to make that situation permanent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve, you know, somebody blew up Nord Stream now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dependent on American LNG, they&rsquo;re going to pay higher</p>
<p>prices for that. But it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s been a pretty impressive win for</p>
<p>the American natural gas industry. And I think Biden has</p>
<p>really pulled a 180 here. Because you remember when he</p>
<p>first came into office, he canceled Keystone, he canceled</p>
<p>drilling, he was very tough on the oil and gas industry. I</p>
<p>think after he then delivered the hundreds of billions for the</p>
<p>climate, special interest in the Inflation Reduction Act, now he</p>
<p>is taking care of the oil and gas industry. I love it.</p>
<p>Biden. Yeah, not. And so what you&rsquo;re saying is Biden</p>
<p>dynamically change course based on inputs like a great leader</p>
<p>would. Okay, well done.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t listen. I don&rsquo;t know. Well, no, listen, I</p>
<p>think Biden has done something politically smart here. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no question about it. I am giving him credit. Does it mean</p>
<p>that this war was worth it? No, I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t think we should</p>
<p>be engaging in oil wars like we did in the Middle East. So I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not justifying this war. But I am saying that there is a cold</p>
<p>hard American interest undergirding our position, which</p>
<p>is, it&rsquo;s about LNG. It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not just about moral</p>
<p>platitudes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, strong start to 2023. vassal and undergirding.</p>
<p>My biggest predictions I&rsquo;m working backwards from to here,</p>
<p>I think the door dashes, Airbnbs, Ubers, Etsy&rsquo;s of the</p>
<p>world who need entrepreneurs, they need workers, they need</p>
<p>supply, they&rsquo;ve always been supply constrained. As</p>
<p>unemployment becomes, let&rsquo;s call it what it is sticky,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see a lot more people participating in gig</p>
<p>platforms or entrepreneurial platforms that enable them to</p>
<p>make money. So I think they will be huge beneficiaries, especially</p>
<p>if they continue to lay off employees like DoorDash and</p>
<p>Airbnb did to right size their businesses. But my first one, my</p>
<p>number one is laid off tech workers. I think laid off tech</p>
<p>workers who get together in groups of two, three or four</p>
<p>developers, product managers, people who actually build stuff,</p>
<p>and start companies together are going to become extremely</p>
<p>successful. And they&rsquo;re going to make incredible lemonade from</p>
<p>these lemons of these big tech layoffs. So I think the startup</p>
<p>space is again, and these laid off tech workers who choose to</p>
<p>take control of the destiny and starts companies are going to be</p>
<p>the true big winners. If you do it, do it with two or three</p>
<p>friends, because you&rsquo;re going to need developers, you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>need those those talented people in the startups that have three</p>
<p>founders get funded faster than the ones with one. So those are</p>
<p>my two winners. All right. Oh, yeah. And last year, our biggest</p>
<p>business winners were Chamath said SMBs, Sachs said rise to</p>
<p>the rest. Freeberg said Stripe. And I said Disney Millennials</p>
<p>and Gen Z. Let&rsquo;s go on to biggest business loser for 2023.</p>
<p>Friedberg, who do you think will be the biggest business loser in</p>
<p>23 this year? In fact,</p>
<p>okay, so my biggest loser is the general category of capital</p>
<p>intensive series B3D growth businesses in the startup</p>
<p>landscape private companies. As you guys know, there&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>big shift in capital allocation. A lot of the folks</p>
<p>who were writing big checks into growth rounds are retreating</p>
<p>back to writing smaller checks and seed in a rounds, they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to write the $20 million Series B, they want to write the</p>
<p>$5 million seed in a round. No one wants to kind of follow the</p>
<p>valuation. No one wants to set the valuation for these growth</p>
<p>businesses. Particularly if after this round, you know, you</p>
<p>need another big round of capital, and no one&rsquo;s sure if</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s going to be waiting on the other end. As a result,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing tons of these businesses run into capital</p>
<p>infusion walls, they can&rsquo;t pivot. I think we&rsquo;ll see what we</p>
<p>saw in the.com bubble, where 99 and a half percent of these</p>
<p>companies actually die, the half percent that we are going to</p>
<p>emerge as the next $100 billion enterprises, the Googles and the</p>
<p>Amazons of the world. So there will be light at the end of the</p>
<p>tunnel for the winners. But generally, there are hundreds of</p>
<p>companies in hardware, in sin bio in biotech and high growth</p>
<p>enterprise software that require significant sales investment</p>
<p>expense. A lot of these businesses where the capital</p>
<p>intensive nature of the business just doesn&rsquo;t have the market for</p>
<p>it right now. And their end and investors are all retreating,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna be selective. So that&rsquo;s where I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be more capital intensive. By the way, seed seed and a</p>
<p>investing hot as a button. B just kiss. That&rsquo;s what that Yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Okay, sacks biggest business loser for 2023.</p>
<p>Well, I just by the way, 100% agree with what free work said,</p>
<p>but my biggest loser for business in 23 is the consumer.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t understand how the consumer isn&rsquo;t going to finally</p>
<p>tap out in this economy. I mean, they they have a mountain of</p>
<p>personal debt, credit card debts at all time highs. I think the</p>
<p>average credit card rate hit 19.6% last week, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>expected to rise even further. The mortgage rates are above 7%</p>
<p>now. So forget about trying to buy a new home, or sell your</p>
<p>home, and your stock portfolio is down to and now layoffs are</p>
<p>starting to pile up. So I just don&rsquo;t understand how we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to avoid a recession. And you saw, you know, Kashkari</p>
<p>saying that the Fed&rsquo;s gonna keep raising 5.4% his prediction. You</p>
<p>know, I don&rsquo;t understand how if rates are at five and a half</p>
<p>percent, that doesn&rsquo;t finally break the back of this economy.</p>
<p>And we go into a recession.</p>
<p>You think sacks that the economy is actually broken right now, we</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t have the data because the data lag 60 days in most</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s minds, because it does feel like the consumer is just</p>
<p>and real estate has just broken at this very moment.</p>
<p>It seems like I mean, the pain is very unequal, right. But in</p>
<p>the tech industry, we&rsquo;ve been in a recession for a year. I mean,</p>
<p>like the gross stocks are down 80%. What Freeberg said is true,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s going to fund these, you know, high burning</p>
<p>companies, there&rsquo;s an enormous amount of retooling that has to</p>
<p>happen. Look, I think the recession is here. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>very unequally</p>
<p>distributed,</p>
<p>distributed. Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I mean, if you look at it, buy now pay later,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a category starting to break credit card debt, as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying, hitting, you know, big,</p>
<p>bad records in terms of how much we love spending. Also,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s savings are going down. So the consumers back has been</p>
<p>broken. I think we&rsquo;re just going to feel it in the in the first</p>
<p>and second quarter. Chamath, who&rsquo;s your biggest business</p>
<p>loser prediction for 2023? The world wants to know.</p>
<p>Let me just build on what Freeberg and sack said for a</p>
<p>second before I give you my pick. Sure. I this is the</p>
<p>conversation you and I had when we just got on, guys, what I was</p>
<p>telling J Cal is at the end of q4, I did five deals. And four</p>
<p>were pro ratas, one was a new deal. And they were all clean</p>
<p>markups. So the four deals that other people put money into. And</p>
<p>I was looking at them, and I was trying to figure out, okay, what</p>
<p>differentiates these things in free birth, your point, these</p>
<p>were super clean startups with very clean cap tables that had</p>
<p>clear progress. And then conversely, I had seven converts</p>
<p>showed to me for companies whose valuations were anywhere between</p>
<p>three, and I would say 12 billion. And I did none of them.</p>
<p>And not only did I do none of them, nobody else did any of</p>
<p>them. And the problem was the real market clearing price was</p>
<p>80 to 90% down. And so I was like, what is going on here? So</p>
<p>free birth, your point, I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s just cash</p>
<p>intensive startups. I think it&rsquo;s like all growth companies</p>
<p>are in a really bad place. I thought that this growth stuff</p>
<p>would get sorted out in two to three months. And now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>worried it&rsquo;s two to three years. I think it&rsquo;s toxic, toxic.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the definition of Chamath what I think has happened. And</p>
<p>where I think the cutoff is, is when the value the implied</p>
<p>market valuation of the company based on where public comps are</p>
<p>trading is less than the total capital preference in the</p>
<p>company, the total preferred stock. Wow, so many companies</p>
<p>now that raised 400 million or 2 billion valuation, but the</p>
<p>company is actually worth 300 million now, based on public</p>
<p>market comps. So they&rsquo;re worth less than their preference</p>
<p>stack. So how do you sort of do that?</p>
<p>No, that this is why I think all these converts are getting done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the rubber meets the road on all these deals.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. Who does the convert benefit the convert</p>
<p>benefits, the VCs who want to maintain the illusory valuation</p>
<p>that they had before? They do that. They do that to assuage</p>
<p>the limited partner who gave them money, that the marks</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t as bad as they thought. But the people that really get</p>
<p>screwed, as Jason said, are the common shareholders, because</p>
<p>eventually those converts deals that do get done, those people</p>
<p>will end up owning the company, the cap table gets completely</p>
<p>flushed and reset, and the employees get wiped out.</p>
<p>Yeah. And then you got to basically take all the employees</p>
<p>who were there previously, who now hate the founder, and you</p>
<p>got to start over and give everybody new all the other</p>
<p>wiped,</p>
<p>the people to do all the work and fucked and the people who do</p>
<p>none of the work and who just want to maintain this shell game</p>
<p>gets to basically live another day.</p>
<p>Basically, people are investing as you gave in the example</p>
<p>earlier, like, hey, if it&rsquo;s a $3 billion company, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually worth 750 people, instead of taking the valuation</p>
<p>from 3 billion to 750, we&rsquo;ll say, okay, buy one share at the</p>
<p>$3 billion price. And we&rsquo;ll give you three or four shares for</p>
<p>free or for a penny warrants, they&rsquo;re called typically, or,</p>
<p>you know, just different ways to structure this. And then all of</p>
<p>a sudden, nobody knows the actual denominator, they may own</p>
<p>them 10,000 shares, but they don&rsquo;t know how many shares are</p>
<p>actually issued because the warrants are not on the cap</p>
<p>table. They&rsquo;re in some side document in a folder in a lawyer</p>
<p>or CFO&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>So let me let me tell you my biggest business loser. Yes,</p>
<p>please.</p>
<p>I think that the biggest potential business loser this</p>
<p>year is Google search, as measured by your profitability</p>
<p>and engagement. I think it&rsquo;s easier for me to see where the</p>
<p>the usage comes from, as opposed to picking open AI or chat GPT</p>
<p>in terms of where the usage goes to. And the reason is because I</p>
<p>think a lot of people don&rsquo;t still fully understand how</p>
<p>machine learning and AI work, but just 30 second primer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two big buckets of work. There&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called learning,</p>
<p>which is how you learn how to make predictions. And then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called inference, which is when you actually type</p>
<p>something into the search box, you get the answer. The thing</p>
<p>with learning, and what chat GPT is showing is that they have</p>
<p>learned by crawling the entirety of the web. There are five or</p>
<p>six other organizations that are capable of crawling the entire</p>
<p>web, in terms of cost in terms of compute in terms of the</p>
<p>quality of the transformers and the quality of the AI. And so I</p>
<p>find it easier to predict the decay in the quality of Google</p>
<p>search as that much better than everybody else, then I find it</p>
<p>is to predict who will win, because I think that with</p>
<p>enough time and money, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, the Chinese</p>
<p>internet companies can all compete, Facebook. And so I</p>
<p>think that you&rsquo;ll converge on the same training, which will</p>
<p>lead to the same inference. And so I think consumers end up</p>
<p>getting confused, and we&rsquo;ll end up being able to get high</p>
<p>quality search results for many places versus today. You know,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t only think that Google is the only game in town,</p>
<p>quite honestly, for most people. Well, I think that statistic</p>
<p>show that Google could lose 10 or 15% of usage to all these</p>
<p>other sites. And that may not make any of those sites that</p>
<p>relevant, but it&rsquo;ll have a material measurable impact to</p>
<p>Google and Google&rsquo;s fantastic prediction. And I think, you</p>
<p>know, chat, GPT, or these other ones are going to have a very</p>
<p>interesting marketing attack that they can do on Google is</p>
<p>why search when you can get an answer, right? Hey, we&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>give you the answer. You don&rsquo;t have to search. I had so many</p>
<p>losers that I went through here. I&rsquo;m just gonna run backwards to</p>
<p>them. Number five, I thought founders refused to downsize in</p>
<p>2022 could be big losers in 2023. Five and the rest of us</p>
<p>are just I&rsquo;m just going to tell you my thought process. I just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to have a long hair. Number four, I thought VC funds</p>
<p>founded in 2020. Then I thought crypto because Gary Gensler says</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all stock. Then I went with you, Chamath. Number four,</p>
<p>Google, my god, they got so many headwinds against them with a</p>
<p>chat GPT. But I wound up on white collar workers with no</p>
<p>hard skills. Twitter going down to I think, you know, Elon said</p>
<p>a couple 100 people&rsquo;s all you need to run Twitter. And I think</p>
<p>he said he has 2000 employees or something like that. He has</p>
<p>shown everybody, you know, hey, listen, these more can be done</p>
<p>with less, or these things are overstaffed in a massive way. I</p>
<p>think white collar workers now, the idea that you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>four offers, and you&rsquo;re gonna be able to play them off each other</p>
<p>is over.</p>
<p>When we take the show, it&rsquo;s surplus elites.</p>
<p>Sure. White collar workers, aka surplus elites, people who</p>
<p>actually, you know, are mid managers who don&rsquo;t, who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually code or don&rsquo;t actually build a product or sell a</p>
<p>product don&rsquo;t actually do real work. As I think many people</p>
<p>would frame it in the managerial class or the CEO class. Man,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have a hard time. And this week, Andy, Amazon,</p>
<p>Andy cut 18,000 white collar workers, not the blue collar,</p>
<p>the white collar workers in Amazon, that was a big turning</p>
<p>point. And Benny off. You know, he&rsquo;s Ohana. He is Mahalo. He is</p>
<p>Aloha. He does not like to lay people off. He considers sells</p>
<p>for us a family. He laid off 8000.</p>
<p>I predicted that.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I mean, that is</p>
<p>a tweet about that. Well, I mean, the reason is pretty simple,</p>
<p>right? Their gross slowed down by two thirds in the most recent</p>
<p>quarter, but they&rsquo;re still spending the same amount of</p>
<p>sales and marketing. So when that happens, your CAC payback</p>
<p>explodes, right? You go from three years payback to like 10</p>
<p>years. So they have to cut costs in order to rationalize your</p>
<p>unique economics. So and now it cascades, right? Because all of</p>
<p>Salesforce&rsquo;s vendors are gonna be getting less money from</p>
<p>Salesforce. Yes, they&rsquo;re tightening their belts. So then</p>
<p>those companies are gonna have to cut and the cycle just keeps</p>
<p>going and going.</p>
<p>Right. And everybody tightens their belts at the same time,</p>
<p>freezes the economy, aka recession, and and possibly</p>
<p>were so that mine was a surplus elite. So that&rsquo;s a nice little</p>
<p>quartet. In 2022. Just so you know, I picked crypto. Freeberg</p>
<p>also picked crypto, which must have used a MasterCard and sack</p>
<p>said, assets classes that benefit from government dumps</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Yeah. All right, let&rsquo;s go to biggest business deal of 2023</p>
<p>is a prediction. What do we think could be the biggest</p>
<p>business deal? Easy, easy. This one. Okay, come on, go. Let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>right around here. Okay, come off quickly. Starlink will go</p>
<p>public. Oh, SpaceX will cut and paste the cap table. And we will</p>
<p>take yum, yum, it&rsquo;ll be yummy and delicious. And my prediction</p>
<p>is that the Starlink valuation will be at least half of</p>
<p>SpaceX&rsquo;s current private Mark 75 Billy, just 75 billion, it will</p>
<p>be phenomenal. And I think the reason why is that I think in</p>
<p>order for Elon to have complete financial flexibility and do</p>
<p>what he needs to do. And, you know, he talked about this on</p>
<p>our pod about the difficulties and the dangers of margin loans</p>
<p>and all of that stuff. Yes, he&rsquo;s gonna create breathing room for</p>
<p>himself. This is the simplest and most obvious way for him to</p>
<p>do it. It&rsquo;ll give him a ton of more dry powder. Sure. So I</p>
<p>think that this is</p>
<p>an obvious outcome in 2020. They already have a million</p>
<p>subscribers in their better than nothing beta as they call it. I</p>
<p>have two of them. I think this is a great, great. I was I was</p>
<p>the first one to get it for for the global 7500. So okay, I got</p>
<p>it for yeah. Yeah, similar. So they&rsquo;re fighting in your house</p>
<p>in the same size. Yeah, exactly. So there you go. There is a</p>
<p>point. People are underestimating the TAM, I think of this</p>
<p>product. The TAM is not existing broadband connections. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>second connections. It&rsquo;s connections where connections</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t exist. Just so you know, buses, the best in class, the</p>
<p>best in class broadband connection for a plane is called</p>
<p>ka band. And it costs 500 grand a year. That&rsquo;s ridiculous. And</p>
<p>you can replace it for, you know, a 10th of the cost and</p>
<p>Starlink on a plane is dramatically better by</p>
<p>directionally. So I think Starlink is going to go public</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s going to be it&rsquo;s going to be the best chance</p>
<p>that we have of opening up the capital markets in 2023.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another way of saying people who own private jets, if</p>
<p>they are flying 250 hours a year, which will probably be a</p>
<p>reasonable number to 300 hours a year, they&rsquo;re paying $2,000 an</p>
<p>hour for their internet service. That is bonkers. Okay, sax. Who</p>
<p>is your big deal? Biggest business deal prediction</p>
<p>deals. 23 prediction is, there will be a deal between Putin and</p>
<p>G. And they met by satellite late last week to discuss ways</p>
<p>to further help each other in 2023. Putin characterized it as</p>
<p>a no limits partnership. You may remember that the two of them</p>
<p>inked a $175 billion gas deal in early February last year, that</p>
<p>was three weeks before Putin invaded Ukraine. I think now</p>
<p>Russia is even more dependent on China. We&rsquo;ve really driven</p>
<p>Russia into China&rsquo;s arms. And I think there will be a big deal</p>
<p>not just on energy, but on agricultural products, mineral</p>
<p>products, and rare earth minerals that, you know,</p>
<p>Chamath likes to talk about, I think there could be a trillion</p>
<p>dollar deal between Russia and China this year, if I was gonna</p>
<p>go out and live and make prediction.</p>
<p>Okay, so there is your 2023 prediction of the biggest deal,</p>
<p>the legion of dictators is forming. I do think it&rsquo;s it is</p>
<p>like, you know, that the axis of evil, this is more legion of</p>
<p>dictators, like, hey, let&rsquo;s do business together. Freeberg, you</p>
<p>got a prediction for the biggest business deal of 2023. This is</p>
<p>really going out on a limb here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do two real quick. The first was the similar to what</p>
<p>Zack said, but it&rsquo;s kind of echoing what I said earlier,</p>
<p>which is the petro yuan trade. I think that&rsquo;s the Saudi China</p>
<p>trade. If this happens, and oil is sold in yuan, it marks the</p>
<p>beginning of I think, the end of the assumption that the US</p>
<p>dollar is the global reserve and the risk free currency in</p>
<p>reserve for the world. So I think the petro yuan trade, if</p>
<p>you guys, here&rsquo;s the Reuters article covering G&rsquo;s visit to</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia last month, first, second week of December. Once</p>
<p>this gets inked, and signed, it&rsquo;s a real shift. Globally, I</p>
<p>think the other one that I&rsquo;m that I&rsquo;m going to point out that</p>
<p>I think is a bit of a out of left field one, maybe. And maybe</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna look like a total idiot at the end of the</p>
<p>year, but do a wildcard. I like it. This is my wildcard. So my</p>
<p>wildcard is I think Apple ends up buying something completely</p>
<p>out of the ordinary. And here&rsquo;s why I think Apple&rsquo;s core</p>
<p>business, they&rsquo;re facing significant pressure with</p>
<p>respect to their relationship and ties to China. As you guys</p>
<p>may have seen last week, Foxconn announced that they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>going further downstream in terms of their production model.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying to diversify away from being kind of the sole</p>
<p>service provider to Apple. Apple, as you know, is under</p>
<p>such pressure to get out of China, politically, that they</p>
<p>started to try and invigorate activity in Vietnam and</p>
<p>elsewhere. So a lot of pressure on their relationship with their</p>
<p>low cost producer and local cost production partner. They&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>under a lot of political pressure because of the App</p>
<p>Store revenues. You guys know this 30% App Store that they</p>
<p>take, a lot of people are calling it monopolistic and</p>
<p>antitrust is getting involved. So they&rsquo;re feeling that pressure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the pressure with respect to the, you know,</p>
<p>waning consumer demand for high end electronics. Samsung last</p>
<p>yesterday, or last week, or yesterday, I think announced</p>
<p>significant declines in consumer demand for electronics, or</p>
<p>their forecast as such, that has to impact Apple as well. So when</p>
<p>you put all of this together, right, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being pressured to get out of their low cost manufacturing</p>
<p>center, they&rsquo;re being pressured to stop making money on the App</p>
<p>Store, they&rsquo;re being pressured, because the demand may be</p>
<p>waning, they have to do something big to kind of</p>
<p>diversify the business. So I think they might end up doing</p>
<p>something like buying a real content company. Maybe they do</p>
<p>something like buy a Disney, maybe they do something like buy</p>
<p>an automotive company like Fiat Chrysler. I think there are a</p>
<p>number of these kind of like what may seem today outrageous</p>
<p>deals that Apple might end up kind of being pressured into</p>
<p>doing so that they can get ahead of their forecast of the impact</p>
<p>that all these pressures are going to have on their core</p>
<p>business. And so I think this is something interesting to kind</p>
<p>of think may happen this year, I certainly have no insight, or</p>
<p>Intel on anything, or I could be completely wrong on this one.</p>
<p>But it feels like they&rsquo;ve got to do something this year. I</p>
<p>mean, in order to keep that business growing, this is I</p>
<p>think, I love you, your wildcard, because the MBS China</p>
<p>trade, and that relationship, sure, legion of dictators, but</p>
<p>this one is really good. It&rsquo;s hard to buy Disney monopolistic</p>
<p>issues, but buying a car company pretty easy. Because that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fragmented market. I love this prediction. I mean, now with</p>
<p>Tesla, with this depressed stock price, Apple can make a run at</p>
<p>Tesla, they have they could almost buy it with cash. Let</p>
<p>alone BMW, Volvo, one of those brands they could buy easily.</p>
<p>What a great prediction for me. The prediction is Amazon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>three legged stool grows into a sturdy chair chair with a fourth</p>
<p>pillar. For those folks who are not familiar with how Amazon has</p>
<p>built their businesses, there are three pillars in their</p>
<p>stool. ecommerce, obviously, when you buy stuff, prime</p>
<p>memberships, which is kind of considered a separate revenue</p>
<p>stream. And of course, AWS cloud computing, I think the fourth is</p>
<p>going to be this continuation of following the health stream,</p>
<p>not advertising, because that&rsquo;s not a consumer based product.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way they make money. Health is going to be a</p>
<p>big one for them. They obviously acquired one medical, which was</p>
<p>a small purchase. I think they&rsquo;re going to buy Roman hymns,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to buy Peloton, they could buy a whoop, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to go all in on health. And, you know, that</p>
<p>three legged stool becomes a very sturdy chair. And my runner</p>
<p>up is tick tock is going to divest under duress. I think</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to have to go public, and the Chinese are</p>
<p>going to divest their interest in it, and just take their chips,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re going to be faced with the existential</p>
<p>threat during the political debates of the next two years,</p>
<p>there will be unanimous support from Democrats and Republicans</p>
<p>to get tick tock out of the US, therefore they divest.</p>
<p>Can I just test that with your with you guys, because we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>talked about this a lot that hey, we&rsquo;re going to ban tick</p>
<p>tock. How many of your friends, kids or your kids do you guys</p>
<p>know spend hours a week on tick tock 100% lot 90% How do you</p>
<p>get over the political mountain of trying to ban tick tock? If</p>
<p>you try and ban tick tock, whoever raises their hand and</p>
<p>says we should ban tick tock and actually gets it done. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>out of office, there is going to be so much pressure and</p>
<p>backlash because people are hooked and love that app and use</p>
<p>it all the time to take that away from people will feel like</p>
<p>this kind of young kids that don&rsquo;t have phones actually get</p>
<p>everything that tick tock has on YouTube shorts. So I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>tick tock is that important because it is not actually there</p>
<p>is no sticky network effect inside that app. So there isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>usage that&rsquo;s dependent on people, you know, or a graph</p>
<p>that you build. It&rsquo;s a lot of passively consumed content. And</p>
<p>so you know, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re getting pushed a lot of</p>
<p>algorithm algorithmically defined content, you can do that</p>
<p>on YouTube. And so I actually don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>meaningfully important. If tick tock goes away. I think the</p>
<p>content creators stay. It&rsquo;s harder for them to build a</p>
<p>business on YouTube shorts. But if you look at the men measure</p>
<p>the density of content inside tick tock, it exists almost one</p>
<p>to one on YouTube.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting. It&rsquo;s an issue. You think you think it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;ll be okay, if we if we cancel tick tock in the US</p>
<p>and we say that&rsquo;s it, you can&rsquo;t have tick tock anymore to</p>
<p>YouTube, and it&rsquo;ll be disruptive, but people will</p>
<p>just go to YouTube and Instagram. It&rsquo;s not that big of</p>
<p>a deal. In fact, a lot of the fit my favorites if there was a</p>
<p>network effect inside there, then I think people would have a</p>
<p>reason to complain to somebody, whether it&rsquo;s your representative</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s somebody else to say, hey, don&rsquo;t do this, this</p>
<p>would have a deleterious impact on my quality of life or my</p>
<p>quality of experience. And you could make that clear claim on</p>
<p>Instagram, Facebook, you know, Google, YouTube. But tick tock</p>
<p>is is much more brittle that way. And that&rsquo;s why they need to</p>
<p>get public sooner and monetize this bloody thing. Because I</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s very easy, actually, to deconstruct tick</p>
<p>tocks value into these other places. I can tell you my</p>
<p>favorite tick tock is chefs reactions. And I consume him</p>
<p>now on Instagram, because he posts, we just copies one to the</p>
<p>other. And so chefs reactions is a great example where he</p>
<p>actually got banned by tick tock, and then diversified on</p>
<p>his own. And now what he does is he publishes across multiple</p>
<p>streams. And if you look at all the big creators, they all do</p>
<p>that, because it makes no sense to actually give the power to</p>
<p>any one of these things. Why have a dependency? Why have a</p>
<p>dependency? All right, let&rsquo;s keep the trains moving. Most</p>
<p>contrarian belief. This is the Peter Thiel award, your chess</p>
<p>partner, sacks, who&rsquo;s winning in 2022 in chess, how many chess</p>
<p>games do you have going with Peter Thiel right now? And who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>higher rated you demolished me with your Queen&rsquo;s Gambit. I</p>
<p>played one game I got killed in seven moves. I&rsquo;m ranked at 800</p>
<ol start="900">
<li>Right now sacks is at 1800. He just walloped me. Who&rsquo;s</li>
</ol>
<p>higher rated?</p>
<p>You accepted the Queen&rsquo;s Gambit? Well, you know, I just I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know what it was. I was like, what opening is this?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, Queens Gambit, you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to accept the Queen&rsquo;s Gambit. Very pleasant</p>
<p>game for white. I&rsquo;m gonna go on a limb here, you know, and risk</p>
<p>being wrong. My, my prediction or most contrarian belief is</p>
<p>that the bromance between Biden and Zelensky comes to an end at</p>
<p>some point in 2023. And let me state that the part that I think</p>
<p>is conventional wisdom, and everyone agrees with which is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a massive Ukrainian counter offensive in</p>
<p>the spring. And I think that could go one of two ways,</p>
<p>either, it could make limited gains, basically, the Russians</p>
<p>fight them to a stalemate, or it could be successful. And they</p>
<p>could basically push the Russians back to the February</p>
<p>23rd lines and then make it play for Crimea. I predict that in</p>
<p>either one of those circumstances, Zelensky his</p>
<p>interests, and Biden&rsquo;s interest will start to diverge. So in the</p>
<p>case of a stalemate, which I think is probably 5050 here,</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s got to start going into election mode for 2024. And I</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re saying that we&rsquo;re going to be in a recession. So I</p>
<p>think that if there&rsquo;s a stalemate, I think Biden&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to tell Zelensky wrap this thing up, it&rsquo;s time to negotiate, we</p>
<p>need to get this over with. By the same token, if the</p>
<p>counteroffensive successful, I think that the administration</p>
<p>hopefully cooler heads will prevail and not let them take</p>
<p>Crimea, that&rsquo;s basically what they&rsquo;re gunning for, is they not</p>
<p>only want to get back to the February 23rd lines, they want</p>
<p>to go all the way back to the 2014 lines of retaking Crimea. I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s extremely dangerous. I think that could</p>
<p>precipitate a nuclear war. And I think that the cooler heads the</p>
<p>administration will tell Zelensky to stand down. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the right time to make a deal. So I think in either one</p>
<p>of these scenarios, I think you will start to see a divergence</p>
<p>between the Ukrainian and the American interest and that could</p>
<p>create a rift. And I think no one&rsquo;s really predicting that.</p>
<p>I think this is great. This is kind of what I thought the plan</p>
<p>all along was, which was to deplete Putin of resources,</p>
<p>distract him and then get the West off of his oil and, and try</p>
<p>to do regime change, but do it by bleeding him. This would be</p>
<p>proof positive of that strategy, which is bleed him to the end,</p>
<p>and then sell Zelensky out. I think that&rsquo;s actually, I know</p>
<p>that I know it&rsquo;s cynical, but I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing. I</p>
<p>think Ukraine is a tool to deplete Putin and then maybe get</p>
<p>to regime change. I&rsquo;m cynical as it gets with this Chamath. What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your most contrarian belief of 2023?</p>
<p>I will go and pick that inflation, which people expect</p>
<p>to fall off a cliff doesn&rsquo;t fall off a cliff as fast or as</p>
<p>meaningfully as people want. And so I will explain inflation</p>
<p>as three different chapters. And we&rsquo;ve seen the first two</p>
<p>chapters play out. So 2021, chapter one was all about energy</p>
<p>inflation. And you know, we all talked about having almost $10</p>
<p>gas at the pump and what does it mean for everybody and it caused</p>
<p>that initial spike in inflation. And then we had it come off and</p>
<p>sacks called this he said, you know, we&rsquo;re going to have this</p>
<p>sort of double hump. And 2022 was really the story of goods</p>
<p>inflation, right? All these prices and all of these things</p>
<p>went up because the input costs went up, and we all had to bear</p>
<p>the implications of that. But then that started to ebb. Now,</p>
<p>if you look at the tail end of 2022, what I found super</p>
<p>interesting was the number of articles I saw about wage</p>
<p>inflation, whether that was Biden using an 1800s era law to</p>
<p>prevent a railroad strike, the number of states that increased</p>
<p>minimum wage, the trend around unionization. So in general, my</p>
<p>thought is that the pendulum is swinging very markedly away from</p>
<p>capital and towards labor. And as the labor participation rate</p>
<p>stays low and continues to go down. And also it&rsquo;s compounded</p>
<p>by an unemployment rate that may go up, right people are, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be harder and harder to get people to do the work you</p>
<p>need at the company you have, unless you pay them more. And if</p>
<p>that gets exaggerated, then inflation will stay where it is,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t be as muted, and it won&rsquo;t fall off a cliff as people</p>
<p>want to be persistent. That&rsquo;s my big contrarian got a wager for</p>
<p>this year is that we that is inflation. We see wage</p>
<p>inflation that keeps inflation not going down as much as people</p>
<p>want. This is contrarian because everybody&rsquo;s saying, hey, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>over, the consumer&rsquo;s back has been broken, the credit card</p>
<p>debt is high. And everybody&rsquo;s being laid off, yada, yada,</p>
<p>yada. Therefore, goods and services, there&rsquo;ll be more</p>
<p>supply than demand, and the prices will lower. Very</p>
<p>contrarian free break. Do you have a contrarian belief for</p>
<p>2023?</p>
<p>I think my it follows my earlier points about the Saudi</p>
<p>China, Russian, Russia trade this year exiting 2023. It may</p>
<p>be the case that, you know, there&rsquo;s historically been this</p>
<p>belief and this continuing belief that the US dollar will</p>
<p>always be the de facto global reserve currency. And the</p>
<p>current mantra is that it&rsquo;s better than the rest. Everyone</p>
<p>else is worse off than the US Western Europe is in trouble,</p>
<p>Japan is in trouble, China is in trouble, everyone&rsquo;s in trouble.</p>
<p>But if there is a coalition, an economic coalition, a scaled</p>
<p>economic coalition, that starts to shift the balance of power a</p>
<p>little bit, and the US meanwhile, is taking on</p>
<p>extraordinary debt load, spending $1.7 trillion in an</p>
<p>omnibus bill, you know, has this massive unfunded Social</p>
<p>Security problem coming down the pipe, and are trying to manage</p>
<p>multiple funded conflicts around the world. It could be that the</p>
<p>US dollar coming out of 2023 starts to trade more like a risk</p>
<p>asset, and less like a risk free asset. And so I think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my big contrarian bet is that maybe this year marks the</p>
<p>beginning of the end of the US dollar as the kind of global de</p>
<p>facto reserve currency. Based on some of these big trades that I</p>
<p>talked about happening. So that that would be my, my big kind of</p>
<p>contrarian</p>
<p>perfectly said, that&rsquo;s your contrarian bet the accent, the</p>
<p>Legion of dictators, the MBS is etc. They become they form a</p>
<p>global currency. Yeah, my term, not yours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not calling it. Yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t say Legion of dictators</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t say forming a global currency. But I do think</p>
<p>that the fact that that large economic trading models start to</p>
<p>be done in non dollar denominated form, got it, you</p>
<p>know, we can the kind of reserve status of the dollar to some</p>
<p>degree, not fully right, it doesn&rsquo;t happen in a binary way.</p>
<p>And then the dollar starts to trade more like a risk asset</p>
<p>like other currencies do to some degree, not fully. So maybe</p>
<p>maybe this year, we start to see that shift.</p>
<p>Once again, I take the exact opposite of your contrarian</p>
<p>belief. I believe American exceptionalism continues to</p>
<p>soar, as Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, to a lesser extent,</p>
<p>continue to self sabotage themselves with insane wars like</p>
<p>Putin has done, or cutting off the heads of entrepreneurs in</p>
<p>China figuratively, I&rsquo;m saying here, I think you cannot have</p>
<p>exceptionalism without entrepreneurs without people</p>
<p>having freedom. And I think that means American exceptionalism</p>
<p>based on freedom is going to continue and the legion of</p>
<p>dictators, I believe, are going to stab each other in the back</p>
<p>before they change the world or move the currency. Can&rsquo;t trust</p>
<p>them, they&rsquo;ll they&rsquo;ll snip at each other. And or they&rsquo;ll self</p>
<p>sabotage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what do you fall on our opposite?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that America is really feeling its Wheaties</p>
<p>right now. I think that American power is immense. I think that</p>
<p>the superiority of our weapons in Ukraine has been one of the</p>
<p>big surprises of the war.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go Palmer lucky.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the world in the simplistic good guys versus bad</p>
<p>guys frame that Jake out does. However, America is on turbo</p>
<p>right now. And yes, it is true that the bricks would love to</p>
<p>get off of the dollar, because we are now using the dollar and</p>
<p>the financial system of swift as a as a geopolitical tool and a</p>
<p>weapon. And they would very much like to be off of our dependence</p>
<p>on our currency. But I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re anywhere close to</p>
<p>being able to do that yet. And like I said, America is on turbo</p>
<p>right now. Now, one thing one thing I want to mention this</p>
<p>just came out White House correspondent named Jennifer</p>
<p>Jacobs, just reported that the US has agreed to send Bradley</p>
<p>armored vehicles, basically our best tanks to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Previously, US officials had balked at sending armored</p>
<p>vehicles saying heavier weapons be too difficult for Ukraine to</p>
<p>operate and maintain but allies are moving to provide such</p>
<p>weapons. So we keep providing the Ukrainians with more and</p>
<p>more sophisticated weapons, more and more support. Like I said,</p>
<p>this is leading up to a huge Ukrainian counter offensive in</p>
<p>the spring. And I really don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen at</p>
<p>that point. I do think that the Russians will escalate. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they can afford to lose this war. They view it as</p>
<p>existential. And I like I said, I hope cooler heads will</p>
<p>prevail. And if the Ukrainians are successful at breaking</p>
<p>through, I hope that the Biden administration will shut this</p>
<p>down before they try to retake Crimea. Because, you know, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>discussed this before, I think the Russians confronted with a</p>
<p>choice between a total defeat, that includes losing Crimea and</p>
<p>their naval base at Sevastopol, and sees the Ukrainian flag</p>
<p>flying over their base at Sevastopol, if that&rsquo;s a choice</p>
<p>between that, or potentially using a tactical nuke, maybe at</p>
<p>the mouth of the Crimean Peninsula as a firewall, I think</p>
<p>they could choose the nuke option. So it&rsquo;s a very dangerous</p>
<p>situation. And, you know, very, very dynamic, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>possibilities.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s go on to best performing asset of 2023. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going with seed stage investing again. I don&rsquo;t think people want</p>
<p>to get into these toxic cap tables at the late stage, as</p>
<p>Chamath pointed out. So I go with seed stage, you know, and</p>
<p>up to series A, the people brave enough to place bets, the</p>
<p>founders brave enough to start companies, I believe it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best performing asset class of 2023. Chamath, who do you got?</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s still a lot of uncertainty in the world and</p>
<p>in the markets. And so I&rsquo;m generally concerned that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of chop. And so I pick something that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>conservative. But I would have a combination of cash and the</p>
<p>front end of the yield curve. So T bills all the way up to two</p>
<p>year bonds. So you can generate four and a half probably by the</p>
<p>end of this year, 5% pretty safely owning this stuff while</p>
<p>you wait for things to become more certain. And the way that I</p>
<p>think about it is that I would rather miss the first 10 or 15%</p>
<p>of a rally. Once we&rsquo;re really done this stuff, then try to</p>
<p>overcorrect and try to pick a bottom just because I think that</p>
<p>you could lose a lot of money. So I think the goal for this</p>
<p>year is to stay resilient and in the game. And so owning having</p>
<p>a bunch of cash on the sidelines ready to pound it in. Meanwhile,</p>
<p>a portion of it collecting 5% is not such a bad thing while you</p>
<p>wait for the bottom. Fantastic. My answer was actually very,</p>
<p>very similar, which is if Kashkari is right, that rates</p>
<p>are going to 5.4% in q1. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you just put all your</p>
<p>money in short term T bills, you earn five, five and a half</p>
<p>percent risk free? Yeah, like set it and forget it. Yeah. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why capital flows are moving hugely right now from</p>
<p>equities into bonds. Especially if we&rsquo;re going to a recession,</p>
<p>which is inherently deflationary.</p>
<p>What do you got freeberg?</p>
<p>forming asset class 2023.</p>
<p>One of the things so I think it&rsquo;s inevitable that we continue</p>
<p>to have significant infrastructure spending from</p>
<p>both the stimulus and security point of view. So you know, we</p>
<p>kind of want to continue to stimulate the economy and</p>
<p>support growth, we want to continue to create jobs and</p>
<p>support this transition and the risk if the if the recession</p>
<p>predictions play out true in the job market does lucid, it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>tight right now. There&rsquo;s going to be even more of an impetus to</p>
<p>continue to do infrastructure investment. But I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also these big economic transitions happening underway</p>
<p>right now with pharmaceuticals, with semiconductors, with</p>
<p>energy, there&rsquo;s a lot that we&rsquo;ve talked about where there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>security problem, and a redundancy problem. And so, you</p>
<p>know, there are a couple of ways to kind of play this</p>
<p>infrastructure spending thesis in each of those areas. I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>kind of highlighted four of them. One is in semiconductor</p>
<p>capital equipment. Okay, like 10 core applied materials that</p>
<p>range of businesses that provide and sell the equipment into the</p>
<p>the fabs and the and the organizations that build</p>
<p>semiconductor manufacturing facilities. The second is kind of</p>
<p>in oil and gas services. So similar to what Saks said</p>
<p>earlier, Schlumberger Baker Hughes, that class of</p>
<p>businesses, I think benefit in this in this environment. And</p>
<p>this is independent of kind of economic conditions, certainly</p>
<p>because these are big multi year spending projects. The third is</p>
<p>in the equipment to support them. So deer and caterpillar.</p>
<p>And then the fourth, I think is an important one. I&rsquo;ll talk</p>
<p>about this in a minute with respect to my biggest kind of</p>
<p>anticipated thing for next year, which is in a pharmaceutical</p>
<p>infrastructure. So thermo Fisher, and there&rsquo;s some company</p>
<p>and others like them, because there&rsquo;s a lot of build out</p>
<p>happening to support these big transitions happening in the</p>
<p>modalities that are being used in pharmaceutical drugs and</p>
<p>diagnostics. And then I think that there&rsquo;s also a couple of</p>
<p>these businesses that are diversified, like Danaher</p>
<p>Honeywell, thermo Fisher is a good example that play across</p>
<p>multiple of these, these opportunities. So those are</p>
<p>those are all great businesses to own. And you don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>worry about, you know, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re growing cash flow</p>
<p>positive dividend paying companies. And you don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>worry about, you know, am I getting 5% or five and a half</p>
<p>percent based on the equity price this year, these are long</p>
<p>range businesses that are building real value, growing</p>
<p>their top line, and compounding value from within. And then</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re acquiring a lot of smaller businesses very cheap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say what, that&rsquo;s an important trend. I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>across these companies, Danaher Honeywell, thermo Fisher, they</p>
<p>buy small companies, they pay very little, and they immediately</p>
<p>get massive return on invested capital, like they&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>high teens. So why get 5% on T bills, when you can get high</p>
<p>teens ROIC, on the management teams running these incredible</p>
<p>platforms. So that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m most excited for this year.</p>
<p>Okay, now let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>That was like a mad that was like my my mad my mad money</p>
<p>segment. I&rsquo;ve never done the mad money segment before. But there</p>
<p>you guys got</p>
<p>worst performing asset, I went with energy because not that I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s not important, but it just feels like everybody rushed</p>
<p>into it in 2022. So it feels like it&rsquo;s overheated. And if we</p>
<p>are in a recession, people might lower consumption in terms of</p>
<p>energy and be looking for cheaper alternatives. So it</p>
<p>could be overheated. So I went with energy, Chamath worst</p>
<p>performing asset, you got one.</p>
<p>I think that if we&rsquo;ve learned anything from the last three</p>
<p>years, you have to separate the valuation of a company and how</p>
<p>it performs in the stock market with its value in society. So</p>
<p>for example, if you look at zoom, zooms valuation has</p>
<p>cratered, but its value in society has probably continued</p>
<p>to go up, it&rsquo;s still a massively relied upon tool. The point</p>
<p>is that markets do not give you credit for the value in society,</p>
<p>they will give you credit when you are about to over earn. But</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll pull it all back when they think that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to under earn. So in that lens, I think that tech will</p>
<p>have a tough year. I think energy will have a really shit</p>
<p>year. And probably the biggest asset class that is going to get</p>
<p>pressured is going to be junk debt. And the reason is a bunch</p>
<p>of these variable rate loans, when rates are at five and 6%,</p>
<p>that all of a sudden are like 11 1213 14% coupons, a bunch of</p>
<p>companies will have trouble meeting their debt obligations</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have to restructure the debt or we&rsquo;ll have to file</p>
<p>some tech energy performing asset for 2023.</p>
<p>Oh, subcategory of what Chamath just said, I think office towers</p>
<p>in San Francisco are that is some serious toxic debt 27%</p>
<p>vacancy rates and growing as Lisa&rsquo;s role. I think that a lot</p>
<p>of these buildings, maybe virtually all of the San</p>
<p>Francisco downtown is going to be owned by the bank soon,</p>
<p>because no one real estate in San Francisco, specifically the</p>
<p>office towers, because no one wants to be in those those</p>
<p>skyscraper buildings south of market, you know, mired in</p>
<p>homelessness. So yeah, I mean, I think that a lot of those</p>
<p>buildings can be owned by the banks, there&rsquo;s me some major</p>
<p>fire sales. Remember, this is the hottest commercial real</p>
<p>estate market in the country. Yeah, a few years ago, and now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the worst.</p>
<p>Well, look, look what happened to be read. What do you think</p>
<p>about that crazy thing that happened with the Blackstone</p>
<p>read? I mean, that&rsquo;s nuts. You know, what happened? Yeah,</p>
<p>Blackstone has a product called be read. It&rsquo;s like a $70</p>
<p>billion exchange traded fund effectively. And what it is, is</p>
<p>the ability for individual investors don&rsquo;t access to</p>
<p>Blackstone&rsquo;s, you know, commercial real estate</p>
<p>portfolio. And they had such a massive amount of redemptions</p>
<p>that they had to close redemptions at the end of q4.</p>
<p>And they were worried that the redemptions were going to</p>
<p>continue to go up. These are individual investors who</p>
<p>basically sees the writing on the wall, as David said, and</p>
<p>wants their money out. And so they went to the University of</p>
<p>California pension system. And they essentially got a huge</p>
<p>infusion of capital, I think it was about $4 billion, where they</p>
<p>guaranteed 11 and a half percent interest to these guys</p>
<p>for the $4 billion. And they also posted a billion dollars of</p>
<p>their own equity in in the actual REIT to backstop it. So</p>
<p>what does it show you? I think what Saks is saying is really</p>
<p>right. It&rsquo;s it may not just be in San Francisco. But, you know,</p>
<p>with all of these people either getting laid off with all of</p>
<p>these people now working remotely, we may finally start to</p>
<p>see the beginning of the reckoning in commercial real</p>
<p>estate, which has been an unbelievably performant asset</p>
<p>class up until right about now. And on top of that, you have to</p>
<p>factor in these much higher rates. And so these building</p>
<p>owners, if they financed it, which they invariably have</p>
<p>always financed, they have huge variable rate payments that are</p>
<p>due on these buildings, the rent rolls are lower, even people</p>
<p>like Twitter is just refusing to pay the rent. So you have to</p>
<p>take them to court. So it elongates when they have to pay.</p>
<p>And so you could miss a bunch of rent payments. And all of a</p>
<p>sudden, the banks could just go crazy and take ownership of</p>
<p>these things.</p>
<p>Okay. Do you have a worst performing asset class for 2023</p>
<p>prediction? Sultan of science, Queen of quinoa, Dave Friedberg?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s really simple. I&rsquo;ve mentioned it before. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>consumer credit, we assume that raising rising rates and</p>
<p>inflation would taper down consumer demand, meaning</p>
<p>consumers buying goods and stuff. And that certainly hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>happened. I&rsquo;m in Vegas right now. I was in the car yesterday</p>
<p>and the driver grew up in Vegas. He&rsquo;s like, in all the I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lived my whole life in Vegas. He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve never seen a</p>
<p>December, like we just had, it was packed the entire month.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, normally in Vegas, it&rsquo;s dead up until Christmas and</p>
<p>the New Year&rsquo;s people come into town, but it&rsquo;s normally dead.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve never seen such a busy month. And I think we see</p>
<p>this in the numbers consumers are still spending, like it&rsquo;s</p>
<ol start="2021">
<li>They&rsquo;re still spending like interest rates are zero, as</li>
</ol>
<p>we talked about, consumer credit is skyrocketing, while</p>
<p>rates are skyrocketing. And so I think we&rsquo;re going to run into a</p>
<p>real wall with respect to consumer credit in sometime this</p>
<p>year. And you&rsquo;re going to see, as you guys know, this is such a</p>
<p>complicated, interwoven market of assets, that the way that</p>
<p>this this can be traded, there&rsquo;s a lot of different ways to trade</p>
<p>it. But I think it&rsquo;s going to be, in general, consumers are</p>
<p>not going to be able to meet their debt obligations. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>defaults, could be mortgages, credit card debt, defaults are</p>
<p>coming. Yeah, if you&rsquo;re putting the markets, the market has</p>
<p>priced in a bunch of this stuff, obviously, companies like a firm</p>
<p>and you know, the, the, what are they called buy now pay later</p>
<p>companies, but credit card companies, mortgages, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of assets that you can start to kind of pick apart, where do</p>
<p>you think this unravels first? How does it what gets hit</p>
<p>hardest? What&rsquo;s underpriced and overpriced? Probably a lot of</p>
<p>good pair trading to do as Jamal kind of loves to talk about,</p>
<p>with respect to which of these are more likely or less likely</p>
<p>to be sensitive to this dynamic, but there&rsquo;s, I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s going to be a pretty ugly scene. Consumers just have</p>
<p>way too much debt relative to their earnings right now. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty nasty.</p>
<p>And they have some confidence that they&rsquo;ll always have a job</p>
<p>or some way to pay their for easy payment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s muscle memory is serious. You know, you</p>
<p>come out of 2021. When you had, it&rsquo;s not just stimulus checks,</p>
<p>it was the low interest rate and easy credit availability</p>
<p>everywhere. And it&rsquo;s just easy to jump into getting new stuff</p>
<p>and cool stuff. And then when you get used to getting new</p>
<p>stuff every week, or every month, you kind of stick with</p>
<p>it. And you&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t want to give it up just yet. I</p>
<p>just not just yet, not just yet. You know, and so it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>kind of step back from spending when you have a new type of</p>
<p>lifestyle. And I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on. I think this is</p>
<p>an incredible observation. There&rsquo;s a great tick tock of</p>
<p>this guy that runs car dealerships, and he sent them</p>
<p>out on like, how much incredible money like what a significant</p>
<p>percentage of people&rsquo;s income they are spending on their</p>
<p>monthly car payments, and people buy these cars that are well</p>
<p>beyond what should be kind of a reasonable budget. If you were</p>
<p>to go to Susie Orman for a stretch, you should not buy that</p>
<p>freaking stretch. And this the stretching is gonna is gonna</p>
<p>snap this year. Yeah,</p>
<p>absolutely. Which brings us to the most anticipated trend. I</p>
<p>love it. Great one. Most anticipated trend of 2023.</p>
<p>Related to yours, I went with austerity. I have a friend who</p>
<p>sometimes flies private often. And I was talking to him about</p>
<p>his Christmas vacation. This friend of mine, Chamath, instead</p>
<p>of flying private to his vacation, he had to pick up his</p>
<p>kids, he had to go back and forth. He was driving his car.</p>
<p>That was three hour. That was you. Oh, okay. I didn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>tell anyone to click. Yeah.</p>
<p>It was so great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d normally buy private to Lake Tahoe. And he&rsquo;s like, No, I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t go out with your skiing on Friday. I got to pick up my</p>
<p>kids. And then I&rsquo;m driving. I said, Wait a second. How are you</p>
<p>doing that? He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m driving a car. I said, What?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s driving the car? He said, I&rsquo;m driving the car. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why I say austerity is my anticipated trend of 2023.</p>
<p>I agree with you. I actually think this is a really good</p>
<p>opportunity to pull back on so much waste. I haven&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>looked at my household budget and probably two or three years</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even bother. Why? And then and then when I looked at</p>
<p>it, I was like, wow, this is really inflated to a level that</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect. Yes. But it makes a lot of sense to live in</p>
<p>a more heads down austere way. I don&rsquo;t know. Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, look at tonight&rsquo;s menu. You went with duck. I</p>
<p>guess the olive fed Wagyu everything&rsquo;s off the menu now.</p>
<p>No black truffles. We&rsquo;re having duck. We&rsquo;re down to poultry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just next week. We&rsquo;re gonna have pasta. It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Come on. austerity measures for everybody.</p>
<p>They call it foul for a reason. Right? Oh, God.</p>
<p>Saks. Do you buy into austerity where Chamath and I are austerity</p>
<p>belt tightening as our trends? Where were you? What&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>trend for?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a pretty good trend. The trend that I am going</p>
<p>to suggest will be to your great disappointment, J. Cal,</p>
<p>which is Trump&rsquo;s influence in the GOP continues to wane.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing it in real time right now. The headline is</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s endorsement proves worthless to Kevin McCarthy in</p>
<p>the speaker bid. Even the MAGA faithful, like Matt Gaetz, like</p>
<p>Lauren Boebert, they are ignoring Trump&rsquo;s pleas to get</p>
<p>behind my Kevin. And in fact, they&rsquo;re kind of not just defying</p>
<p>him, but making fun of him. Matt Gaetz had a repost Trump</p>
<p>saying sad exclamation point. And Boebert was saying that</p>
<p>Trump needed to get behind her movement. So we have now a level</p>
<p>of open defiance to Trump and the GOP his endorsements just</p>
<p>not are not what they once were. And even if somehow, Kevin</p>
<p>McCarthy pulls us off. I think all that means is that Trump</p>
<p>gets blamed for every swampy rhino compromise that McCarthy</p>
<p>has to make to keep the government running over the next</p>
<p>two years. So it&rsquo;s a lose lose.</p>
<p>Does that mean that populism is on the wane? Do you think like</p>
<p>because the it&rsquo;s the electorate that got him elected in the</p>
<p>first place? He was not very popular with politicians, but he</p>
<p>was kind of an outcast when he got elected the first time. And</p>
<p>that may be the case now, but he still got elected because the</p>
<p>population loved him. People loved him. Is that going to</p>
<p>happen? Do you think that means that the populism is kind of</p>
<p>waning or the interest of the voters is waning on him? Or is</p>
<p>it just the political parties alignment?</p>
<p>Boebert only Boebert only won by a few 1000 votes. She didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exactly crush it in Colorado.</p>
<p>I think a lot of this has to do with Trump&rsquo;s personal standing</p>
<p>after the midterms, the candidates that he personally</p>
<p>picked that were all in tough races, they all basically lost.</p>
<p>It was about the distraction he caused by making the 2020</p>
<p>election such a big deal constantly looking backwards. So</p>
<p>I think the Republican Party doesn&rsquo;t like the antics. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not about the policies. I don&rsquo;t think I think it&rsquo;s 100% about</p>
<p>the about Trump&rsquo;s electability and about his ability to get</p>
<p>things done. And it&rsquo;s not really about the positions per</p>
<p>se. So I think freebird to answer your question, I think</p>
<p>that the future of the GOP will incorporate this populism, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to find a better integration with the</p>
<p>establishment wing of the Republican Party. And future</p>
<p>candidates will have to basically satisfy both of those</p>
<p>wings of the party.</p>
<p>sex was it was a straw that were maybe the two straws that broke</p>
<p>the camel&rsquo;s back for Republicans and Trump in that relationship</p>
<p>was it January six and the election denial? Like for</p>
<p>Republicans? Is it just like, Come on, those are the two</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>this constant focusing on the 2020 election first, it costs</p>
<p>them the cost Republicans that Georgia runoff seat with Purdue</p>
<p>against Warnock. Purdue won on election night, didn&rsquo;t clear 50%</p>
<p>had to go to the runoff. This was happened the day before</p>
<p>January six, this happened on January 5 of 2021. That was the</p>
<p>first race where Trump&rsquo;s antics costume. Then you had this</p>
<p>midterm election, where you know, all the candidates who had</p>
<p>to appease Trump by talking about again, the last election</p>
<p>instead of looking to the future, they got punished by the</p>
<p>voters. I think Republicans want to win. I mean, they&rsquo;re tired of</p>
<p>losing simple. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>
<p>Yeah, the job of a politician is to win freeberg. You got an</p>
<p>anticipated trend of 2023.</p>
<p>I am excited about and want to share the point of view that I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;m selling gene therapies are becoming more mainstream. So</p>
<p>these are pharmaceutical modalities where we use gene</p>
<p>editing systems where you can actually go in and change or add</p>
<p>a genetic material to cells in your body to resolve things like</p>
<p>genetic diseases or change protein deficiencies or</p>
<p>introduce new proteins. And then cell therapies where we</p>
<p>engineer cells put in the body and those cells go and do things</p>
<p>like attack and destroy cancer cells. For example, there are</p>
<p>currently 27 FDA approved cell and gene therapies on the</p>
<p>market. There are over 1000 in clinical trials, many of which</p>
<p>are already showing extraordinary efficacy and</p>
<p>benefit today. These therapies cost upwards of $1 million. So I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a massive and talking about the infrastructure</p>
<p>investment conversation earlier, because of the number of</p>
<p>diseases and the number of conditions and a number of</p>
<p>people that these therapies can treat. I think there&rsquo;s massive</p>
<p>infrastructure investment opportunity coming forward this</p>
<p>year. But also seeing these come to market come out of the</p>
<p>clinical trials, get FDA approved, we have to ramp up and</p>
<p>build up the infrastructure needed because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>traditional, we make a drug in a factory and send it to people</p>
<p>and they get it injected. These are much more complex, they</p>
<p>require a much more complicated delivery mechanism, you have to</p>
<p>have systems to engineer cells and edit them and put them back</p>
<p>in your body. Those systems today take days or weeks and</p>
<p>cost, you know, as a result, $1 million plus per treatment. So I</p>
<p>think that the cell and gene therapy opportunity, you know,</p>
<p>the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference starts this week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the biggest biotech and healthcare conference in the</p>
<p>world starts in San Francisco on Monday. This is one of the</p>
<p>biggest areas of interest and one that everyone&rsquo;s investing</p>
<p>against. But as these come to market, there&rsquo;s, you know, we</p>
<p>talked about this last week, genetic diseases, types of</p>
<p>cancer that are going to be addressed. And I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>excited about seeing more of these products come to market</p>
<p>and seeing the whole kind of infrastructure and delivery</p>
<p>system change.</p>
<p>All right, sorry to interrupt trying to keep the trains moving</p>
<p>gene editing. Very good choice. All right, we end with this is a</p>
<p>little bit fun. Most anticipated media for 2023. These are</p>
<p>things we like to talk about the media here. Sometimes we</p>
<p>talked about White Lotus season two amazing season. And maybe</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re looking forward to next year. I am really looking</p>
<p>forward to in film Oppenheimer Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s movie about</p>
<p>the Manhattan Project. That should be extraordinary. I loved</p>
<p>was Dunkirk his as well. I love Dunkirk. I like everything he</p>
<p>does. And when he this is him becoming like a history uncle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here for it. I&rsquo;m here for Nolan becoming our history</p>
<p>uncle. Instead of Batman. What was the one after inception?</p>
<p>Oh, that was really confusing. The one with Denzel Washington&rsquo;s</p>
<p>son with john Washington. Yes, it was. I couldn&rsquo;t finish it. I</p>
<p>tried twice. I gotta go a third shot on that one. It was Oh,</p>
<p>yeah, it was it was his worst film. It was really difficult.</p>
<p>It was called tenant tenant tenant. Yes, about like time and</p>
<p>reverse. And this it was possible to follow. Did you guys</p>
<p>see his original film, which was incredible memento?</p>
<p>Of course, it was fantastic. Yeah, and then it was great.</p>
<p>It was enough mind mind. Yeah, it was mind bending enough that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, Oh my god, incredible. And then I think</p>
<p>they took it too far tenant. I tried to watch it three times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m generally pretty good with these sorts of films and love</p>
<p>them. But oh my god, it was impossible to follow. He took it</p>
<p>too far. Okay, so hopefully he goes back to his roots.</p>
<p>In terms of TV series. I&rsquo;m looking forward to secession</p>
<p>coming back Ashoka, who is Anakin Skywalker, aka Darth</p>
<p>Vader&rsquo;s Padawan Ted Lasso season three coming up. Those</p>
<p>are for me incredible. And then on the book front, man, the</p>
<p>Michael Lewis book about SPF is going to be next level. I cannot</p>
<p>wait for that sacks. You&rsquo;re a media junkie. What do you got on</p>
<p>your list of things you&rsquo;re looking forward to or should say</p>
<p>what is Tucker&rsquo;s writers? What do they put down?</p>
<p>Well, Jake, I thought you I thought that for movie, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to pick cocaine bear.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for cocaine.</p>
<p>A bear is in the woods. And a, I guess people who are trafficking</p>
<p>in cocaine drop their or crashes and the bear eats the cocaine</p>
<p>and then goes on a rampage. It&rsquo;s kind of like a genre film like</p>
<p>in the crocodile way. By the way, I&rsquo;m listening to Quentin</p>
<p>Tarantino&rsquo;s book, by the way of criticism. Get the audio book.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll like it sacks. He talks about all the films in the 70s.</p>
<p>Very good. Shout out to Quentin. What do you got? What do you got</p>
<p>on your short list? History Uncle?</p>
<p>Me? Yeah. What do you got? I just gave you one. But</p>
<p>cocaine bear top of your list. We&rsquo;ll watch it.</p>
<p>Was on my list. And I think Marvel is doing a good job</p>
<p>developing a new villain to rival Thanos with this with</p>
<p>Kang. I don&rsquo;t know what phase they&rsquo;re on now. But for me</p>
<p>season two, and then the new Ant-Man movie. And, you know, I</p>
<p>thought after Thanos, he wouldn&rsquo;t really be able to top</p>
<p>that. But yeah, they&rsquo;ve come up with a really good concept, I</p>
<p>think, for the next, you know, 20 Marvel movies.</p>
<p>Well, and then it will eventually become Galactus.</p>
<p>Yeah, you guys have completely fucked up. You have missed the</p>
<p>most obvious slam. Here we go. Sade&rsquo;s new album, go.</p>
<p>Dune, part two. Oh, I haven&rsquo;t watched number one yet. I gotta</p>
<p>wait. What? You know, I was kind of boring, wasn&rsquo;t it? My wife</p>
<p>wants to watch it. It is so stylistically beautiful. It is a</p>
<p>little boring. There&rsquo;s not a lot going on slow, but it&rsquo;s so well</p>
<p>shot. It&rsquo;s a fun. It&rsquo;s visually just stunning. I mean, if you</p>
<p>need to watch it on a big screen with big speakers, and but part</p>
<p>two comes out in November this year. Absolutely. That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Right. Freeberg, tell us what documentary on veganism you</p>
<p>recommend and you&rsquo;re anticipating for 2023. What</p>
<p>vegan documentary or animal abuse documentary?</p>
<p>I am excited about the generative AI based media that I</p>
<p>think is going to start to kind of rocket this year. We could</p>
<p>see for example, the first, you know, AI written symphony, the</p>
<p>first kind of AI written published novel, how interesting</p>
<p>would that be like a full novel published by AI, and more maybe</p>
<p>short films based on AI driven script. And maybe even what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really excited about is these AI based interactive video games or</p>
<p>kind of experiences where you the user kind of get to create</p>
<p>and live your own world through some sort of video game type</p>
<p>modality. So I think AI driven media. All right. There you have</p>
<p>it, folks. There are</p>
<p>speaking of pop culture chaos, I guess. Prince Harry has a book</p>
<p>coming out. That&rsquo;s called spare.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair. Like playing bowling.</p>
<p>No, but you know, like in in the English monarchy, they there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the air and the spare. So he&rsquo;s calling himself but to me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a weird self description. Yeah, like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you see yourself as just being self deprecating. He</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t pick that. They paid him so much money. I heard they have</p>
<p>to sell 1.7 million books to break even.</p>
<p>But you know what it reminds me of is when Leonard Nimoy wrote a</p>
<p>book. I think he wrote a book called I am Spock. And then he</p>
<p>wrote a book called I am not Spock. Nice. He could never get</p>
<p>comfortable with the fact that he was just Spock. Yeah. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something weird about calling yourself spare. Like,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re not clearly not comfortable with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the everything. Yeah, everything they taught you</p>
<p>everything I learned at Harvard Business School, and everything</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t teach at Harvard Business School, you can you can</p>
<p>do both books. Alright, listen, this has been great. Breaking</p>
<p>news as we&rsquo;re talking here chat GPT, open AI, doing a tender</p>
<p>offer at 29 billion.</p>
<p>3 billion a day. Oh, my God. It&rsquo;s 29. It&rsquo;s founders fund or</p>
<p>reportedly according to the journal, it&rsquo;s founders fund</p>
<p>thrive capital. So founders fund does not generally do</p>
<p>super overpriced deals. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would buy that. So I mean, come on, dude, are you</p>
<p>kidding me? That&rsquo;s that can be a $300 billion company. That&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tenant, right? But that yeah, it&rsquo;s a 10x from here. I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I would not totally could be. By the way, you guys remember that</p>
<p>the long way of open AI, I don&rsquo;t know what the current situation</p>
<p>is. But it was a nonprofit. Yeah, where they said investors</p>
<p>put money in, but the investors maximum return was 100x on the</p>
<p>dollar invested. No, I don&rsquo;t think nonprofit, but it&rsquo;s up to</p>
<p>100x. No, no, that happened afterwards. It&rsquo;s when they</p>
<p>converted to the original model. Yeah, no, the original model was</p>
<p>a pure</p>
<p>original model was a pure nonprofit where there was no</p>
<p>cap because there was no concept of equity. Yeah, when they</p>
<p>flipped, they kept everybody to 100x on the return. So the</p>
<p>original 100x but not anymore or still, but no, the original</p>
<p>money, which was like Elon&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>Who else put in money? Yeah, all that money came in as a as pure</p>
<p>nonprofit. So I don&rsquo;t know how it converted. But that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>they or did it convert to those people who funded it originally</p>
<p>get any shares in the for profit, we could we could find</p>
<p>out probably they did. I mean, it would make sense that they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ll find out. But I mean, wait, if this is a</p>
<p>tender offer, 27 billion, you wouldn&rsquo;t buy shares at 27. So</p>
<p>again, like the thing that I want to impress upon you is</p>
<p>like, there is an enormous amount of work that they do that</p>
<p>that what their biggest gap to monetizing this will be finding</p>
<p>unique content that they learn on that nobody else has access</p>
<p>to. And this is why I really think it&rsquo;s important to</p>
<p>understand, if you have enough compute, these all of these</p>
<p>unsupervised learning models, if you run them on the same</p>
<p>training set, will converge to the same answer. So you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>getting there first. So in order to be really defensible, you</p>
<p>have to get there in a unique way. And so either you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to hand tune, or you&rsquo;re going to have inputs that are different.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know the answer. That&rsquo;s why, like,</p>
<p>they have to answer that question in their fundraising.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that they did, because these are smart</p>
<p>investors. But that&rsquo;s the big idea that you have to overcome.</p>
<p>And again, you have to think like, you think Google is</p>
<p>sitting on their hands? No, or</p>
<p>29 billion, like what fundamentals is that based on</p>
<p>like, why not 5 billion? Why not 3 billion? I mean, like, why</p>
<p>not 10 billion? Like what makes it double valuation? That&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>it is. It&rsquo;s all this all momentum said nothing to do with</p>
<p>reality, right? I mean, it this would imply at a 30 the public</p>
<p>comps of a Google trades at what 25 or 30 times EBITDA. So this</p>
<p>would imply a billion dollars in EBITDA, a billion dollars in</p>
<p>EBITDA, $3 million a day, they&rsquo;re losing $3 million a day</p>
<p>on computer for reportedly $3 million a day in profit on what</p>
<p>a product? I don&rsquo;t know, they have a</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the issue. I think, look, I mean, my point was, if</p>
<p>these guys open up a set of tools that support all these</p>
<p>applications and services to emerge on top of what they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>built, and they&rsquo;re getting red share getting payments out of</p>
<p>that, it&rsquo;s going to very quickly turn into a real</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the problem. This is why that can&rsquo;t happen. They don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the rights to the data they built the training set on. And</p>
<p>the second they commercialize it, the second anybody pays</p>
<p>them, whoever they base this on to good conversation into</p>
<p>oblivion, I predict suit into oblivion. Let&rsquo;s talk about let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s actually let&rsquo;s talk about that in the next show. Because I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s like the way that AI works. And we should probably</p>
<p>bring someone like Sam on to talk about it. But the way that</p>
<p>AI works on training data, and now people are making claims</p>
<p>that the training data is copyright, therefore, of course,</p>
<p>model output is protected, protects that copyright is, I</p>
<p>think, worthy of a good conversation. What&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>is, you know, the early version of the of the internet was very</p>
<p>simple. It&rsquo;s like you had this file called robux dot txt. And</p>
<p>you would basically be open to a crawl or not. And that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>would allow Google to basically go and spider your pages, right.</p>
<p>And so we have to replace this concept of that with this AI dot</p>
<p>txt. Well, you could make a claim that this is no different</p>
<p>than, you know, a spider crawling a web page, except that</p>
<p>in the in the search case, it was much cleaner, which is we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just going to index your page and redirect people to you. Here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re actually going to create a derivative work because</p>
<p>of you and go. And I do think that that&rsquo;s going to be a very</p>
<p>interesting legal threshold that has to get figured out.</p>
<p>Well, here it is, Chamath, you&rsquo;re nailing it. Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a derivative work. And they did not have permission to use</p>
<p>it. And it impedes upon the original authors, whether it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>photo, it&rsquo;s a song, it&rsquo;s a piece of code, it impedes upon their</p>
<p>ability to do commerce in the world, you are interfering with</p>
<p>their ability to monetize their content. And the percentage</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using is 100%. So when you get to fair use, non</p>
<p>commercial use is very protected, parodies protected</p>
<p>education&rsquo;s protected. But when you dip into using the entirety</p>
<p>of the work, which they&rsquo;re doing, and you impede upon the</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s ability to commerce, and you confuse the public,</p>
<p>well, this is a test that they will fail, fail, fail.</p>
<p>This is why I think that most people don&rsquo;t understand what AI</p>
<p>is. They don&rsquo;t even understand the difference between training</p>
<p>and inference. So hopefully, there is some more understanding</p>
<p>of this. But if you use the same data set, you will eventually</p>
<p>converge to the same outputs absent of hand tuning weights,</p>
<p>which has its own issues, and absent any asymmetrically</p>
<p>different data that you have that nobody else has.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Yes. So if you are Apple, and you have the watch</p>
<p>data, or you&rsquo;re Google, and you have the search data, or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a weather company, you have the weather data, and you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>proprietary, of course, there&rsquo;s a very easy solution to this</p>
<p>Chamath. Number one, citations, when the algorithm gives you an</p>
<p>answer, it should say, what were the top percentage sources of</p>
<p>this information? How did the AI</p>
<p>know? But Jason, just again, look, if you look inside of a</p>
<p>transformer, the problem is, okay, that you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>trillions of ranks, trillions of weights, trillions. And so how</p>
<p>are you going to decide how to basically draw a line under a</p>
<p>threshold, this was actually a useful input, and this was not.</p>
<p>So again, I just think that it&rsquo;s hard, a very few small class of</p>
<p>people actually understand this, like the great person to</p>
<p>actually bring in to talk about this would be Andre Karp, if he</p>
<p>not. And I think his Andre was there, sure. And a Tesla. And but</p>
<p>he can say it in a very dispassionate way to explain</p>
<p>this to people, I think we should, we should ask him to</p>
<p>come on. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I can ask him. I can. I mean,</p>
<p>this is brand is this the law, Sachs, you&rsquo;re an attorney, you</p>
<p>understand fair use copyright, all this stuff. The law, correct</p>
<p>me if I&rsquo;m wrong here, Sachs does not anticipate this.</p>
<p>Like this, a highly specialized area, I don&rsquo;t want to pretend</p>
<p>like I understand the law in this area. You know, I&rsquo;d want to</p>
<p>talk to a specialist.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay. Let&rsquo;s have this conversation. Because I think</p>
<p>yeah, this is a great discussion work for us to talk about</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>this is probably why, by the way, they started as open</p>
<p>source, because it was like a slam dunk thing to make this a</p>
<p>nonprofit and open source everything, because maybe in</p>
<p>part because of these issues, but if you just let the code run</p>
<p>free, you probably don&rsquo;t have to even deal with these issues.</p>
<p>Right? Well, they they closed it. Remember their claim. The</p>
<p>claim was this is too dangerous. Their original claim was it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too dangerous for people to not see the code. Then Sam flipped</p>
<p>on that. And he said, it&rsquo;s too dangerous for people to see the</p>
<p>code. And it started out as a nonprofit, where the idea was</p>
<p>the way to keep this safe is for everybody to see the code. But</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t make any money, whatever private and they flip</p>
<p>the decision. So keep that in mind as well. He&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very, very, very clever business person. He&rsquo;s savvy. And, you</p>
<p>know, Paul Graham, when Paul Graham picked Sam to run YC,</p>
<p>Paul Graham said that this is the most impressive person I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>met since Steve Jobs. Yeah. Remember that on the pot? I do</p>
<p>remember that. He said something similar about Gary Tan is now</p>
<p>running YC starting this week. Sam Altman friend of the pot</p>
<p>come on all in anytime and has played in our poker game several</p>
<p>times. Yes, yes, we we had a tough situation there where you</p>
<p>interfered in a hand if you remember. All right, listen,</p>
<p>this is what happened. There was a Sam and I were in a hand of</p>
<p>poker. He raised I had to pair and I&rsquo;m trying to figure out</p>
<p>does he have a set or is he bluffing me? I think he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>top pair. And you were like, Oh, look at this. And you started</p>
<p>commenting on the hand. Oh, my God, I made the call or not yet.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, God, I&rsquo;m like, come on. For me, LaBouche. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s stop talking here. Because I&rsquo;m trying to unplay</p>
<p>hand. I&rsquo;m like, okay, Sam would get and I basically came to the</p>
<p>conclusion Sam would get delight. Great delight bluffing</p>
<p>me off a hand is a risk taker. He knows I&rsquo;m conservative. He</p>
<p>knows he&rsquo;s a risk taker. I&rsquo;m gonna call here with my I had</p>
<p>bottom two. I&rsquo;m like, does he have a set and there was also</p>
<p>straight on the board. I&rsquo;m like, fuck it. I at best I&rsquo;m you know,</p>
<p>even money here. But there was a lot in the pot. So I was just</p>
<p>doing the pot odds while I&rsquo;m doing the pot odds. You were</p>
<p>like, which is usually me. I&rsquo;m usually the one being</p>
<p>reprimanded for talking. But it was notable. I listen. Love you</p>
<p>besties. Why don&rsquo;t you tell people that there&rsquo;s no comments</p>
<p>and just as a programming note, we turned off comments for a</p>
<p>couple of weeks on the YouTube just to see how it psychologically</p>
<p>affects me. And it&rsquo;s for Chamath to just F with all you</p>
<p>brigadooners. We love you. Besties. This has been a great</p>
<p>episode. And his Twitter is at Chamath and he doesn&rsquo;t read it</p>
<p>so everyone knows that Saks and I voted against turning off</p>
<p>comments. Just just voted in favor of whatever got Chamath</p>
<p>vote for the All in Summit 23. So that&rsquo;s how I vote. This is</p>
<p>divorce trading now, but the podcast has never been better.</p>
<p>Besties spending time together on the slopes is the cure to all</p>
<p>evils. We&rsquo;ll see you next time. Love you besties. Bye bye.</p>
<p>Love you guys. Bye bye.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Saks</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with</p>
<p>it. Love you besties.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this like</p>
<p>sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
