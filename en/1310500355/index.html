    <p>The following is a conversation with Mr. Beast,</p>
<p>the mastermind behind some of the most epic</p>
<p>and popular videos ever made.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got House of Macadamias for a satiating</p>
<p>and delicious snack,</p>
<p>8sleep for, you guessed it, naps,</p>
<p>and BetterHelp for mental health.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>Snacks, naps, or mental health.</p>
<p>And now onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by House of Macadamias.</p>
<p>It seems like it was just yesterday</p>
<p>that they became a sponsor,</p>
<p>and I became aware of their existence</p>
<p>because before they became a sponsor,</p>
<p>they sent a giant box of delicious snacks.</p>
<p>And it seems just like it was yesterday</p>
<p>that I ate all of those snacks over a period of a few days</p>
<p>and was a happier man for it.</p>
<p>This month, I&rsquo;m much stricter on my diet</p>
<p>and trying to be much more responsible</p>
<p>with my consumption of snacks.</p>
<p>I think moderation is key for that.</p>
<p>But in general, I think, first of all,</p>
<p>macadamia, to me, I think,</p>
<p>is one of the more delicious nuts,</p>
<p>but it is definitely the healthiest</p>
<p>or at least one of the most healthy.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty much the healthy.</p>
<p>I remember when I first started keto,</p>
<p>many, many years ago, I did a bunch of research</p>
<p>on which nuts I can and can&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>I guess, if I wanna be ultra low carb.</p>
<p>And everybody recommended macadamias</p>
<p>as the one that has all these nutrients</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of science.</p>
<p>You can look it up.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s omega-7s or whatever,</p>
<p>those different kinds of fats.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The points are delicious.</p>
<p>And the raw ingredient of the macadamia nut</p>
<p>that House of Macadamias provides is just delicious.</p>
<p>And of course, they do all kinds of snacks around that.</p>
<p>And my task, whenever I do an ad read</p>
<p>or talk to anybody, like my neighbors or friends,</p>
<p>about House of Macadamias is not to do any sexual innuendo.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s job number one.</p>
<p>My brain is that of a silly person.</p>
<p>At heart, I&rsquo;m still a child</p>
<p>and I will forever remain a child.</p>
<p>Like that Tom Waits song, I Don&rsquo;t Wanna Grow Up.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s not even the name of the song or the lyrics,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just gonna go with it.</p>
<p>And this is a good chance to mention</p>
<p>that Tom Waits is somebody that I&rsquo;ve dreamed of talking to</p>
<p>on this podcast for a long time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very difficult interview to get.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s dropped a few crumbs to me of hope.</p>
<p>You know, saying like, yes, maybe one day.</p>
<p>So I hold on to that hope.</p>
<p>Like a hold on to the delicious House of Macadamia nuts</p>
<p>with childlike joy in my eyes.</p>

<p>This episode is also brought to you by Eight Sleep</p>
<p>and its new pod three mattress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a few days over the past,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say three weeks where I&rsquo;ve been extremely stressed</p>
<p>because of several things going on in my life.</p>
<p>You know how life is, it&rsquo;s an up and down process.</p>
<p>Both the ups and downs contribute</p>
<p>to the beauty of the whole experience.</p>
<p>Anyway, when things were kind of difficult,</p>
<p>I sought escape in friends, in books,</p>
<p>in moments of simple joy, in moments of peace.</p>
<p>And I think the best escape is a good nap.</p>
<p>A full night&rsquo;s sleep, of course, but also a good nap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of magical how much your mind</p>
<p>can just become completely refreshed.</p>
<p>The beauty of the world can be richly rediscovered</p>
<p>through the process of a nap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible, just 20, 30 minutes, it&rsquo;s kind of amazing.</p>
<p>At least my brain is like that.</p>
<p>So sometimes when I&rsquo;m feeling crappy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give it a nap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give it a good night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>and see how I feel again in the morning.</p>
<p>And almost always, if not right away,</p>
<p>just maybe a couple of times, I&rsquo;ll feel better.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s why you wanna really make sure</p>
<p>that the surface, the mattress, all kinds of technology</p>
<p>that you surround yourself with in terms of sleep,</p>
<p>you use the best stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I look forward to sleeping</p>
<p>on that cool surface that an Asleep cover provides.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>I look forward to naps and sleeps</p>
<p>just because of that Asleep cover.</p>

<p>Speaking of the ups and downs of life,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>you know, the kind of rollercoaster your mind can go on.</p>
<p>At least my mind can go on.</p>
<p>One moment I feel blissful and happy</p>
<p>and everything is beautiful.</p>
<p>And one moment I feel cranky and just a little bit down.</p>
<p>And one of the things I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>is to just kind of allow the passage of time</p>
<p>to cure all things.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s not necessarily the full picture</p>
<p>because you should probably treat your mental health</p>
<p>very seriously and talk through it with a therapist.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some deep ocean of feeling there</p>
<p>that may lay unexplored.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I think, beneficial to explore it</p>
<p>with a good therapist.</p>
<p>I think one of the most accessible, easiest ways</p>
<p>to get access to a good therapist,</p>
<p>a licensed professional therapist, is BetterHelp.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a big supporter of what they do.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s really the first barrier</p>
<p>is make it super easy.</p>
<p>And of course, make it affordable.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Mr. Beast.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here with Mr. Beast, the brilliant mastermind</p>
<p>behind some of the most popular videos ever created.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;ll ever make a video</p>
<p>that gets one billion views?</p>
<p>I think maybe one of the videos we&rsquo;ve already made</p>
<p>might get a billion views.</p>
<p>Probably like the squid game video with Enough Time.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s only a year old</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s already on 300 million.</p>
<p>Or some of the newer ones we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>have gotten like 100 million views in a month.</p>
<p>So those four are projected over 10 years</p>
<p>because YouTube&rsquo;s not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Probably one of those.</p>
<p>So over time, they don&rsquo;t necessarily plateau.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting, we&rsquo;re literally jumping right in.</p>
<p>I love it, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a firm believer that it&rsquo;s much easier</p>
<p>to hypothetically get 10 million views on one video</p>
<p>than 100,000 on 100.</p>
<p>And part of why it&rsquo;s much easier, in my opinion,</p>
<p>is if you make a really good video,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so evergreen and it never dies.</p>
<p>Because YouTube, when you open up YouTube</p>
<p>and look at the videos,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just serving you whatever</p>
<p>they think you&rsquo;ll like the best.</p>
<p>And so if you just make a great video,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s constantly just above every other video,</p>
<p>even two years down the road,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll just keep serving it and never stop.</p>
<p>Which is why it&rsquo;s much easier to make one great video</p>
<p>than a bunch of mediocre ones.</p>
<p>What about one billion subscribers?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve passed PewDiePie as the most subscribed</p>
<p>to YouTube channel.</p>
<p>When do you think you get a billion?</p>
<p>Let me do some math real quick.</p>
<p>So around 120, do you think about this?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t, honestly.</p>
<p>Because one thing you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>if you want to gain subscribers,</p>
<p>if you want to get views, if you want to make money,</p>
<p>almost any metric in this video creation space,</p>
<p>if you want something, it all comes back to,</p>
<p>okay, well then just make great videos.</p>
<p>So instead of focusing on all these</p>
<p>arbitrary vanity metrics,</p>
<p>I just kind of focus on the one thing</p>
<p>that gets me all that, which is make good videos.</p>
<p>And I do think we will one day hit a billion subscribers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a plan on going anywhere.</p>
<p>Even though we&rsquo;re only on 120 million right now</p>
<p>on the main channel,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re doing around 10 million a month now,</p>
<p>and YouTube just, yeah, I just don&rsquo;t see it going anywhere.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see any reason</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;d ever get burnt out or quit.</p>
<p>So I think with enough time, yes.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you those family-friendly questions</p>
<p>before I go to the dark questions.</p>
<p>So now, what is it?</p>
<p>We have dark questions, but if you wanted to hook them,</p>
<p>you would start off with the dark question.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you get them.</p>
<p>Okay, well, let me ask you about a Twitter poll you posted,</p>
<p>a $10,000 death poll.</p>
<p>You tweeted, if someone offered you $10,000,</p>
<p>but if you take it, a random person on Earth dies,</p>
<p>would you take the $10,000?</p>
<p>And 45% of people said yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, at least at the time I checked,</p>
<p>850,000 people committing murder</p>
<p>for just $8.5 billion in total.</p>
<p>So what do you learn about human nature from that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Honestly, it was late at night when I threw that up too.</p>
<p>I was just like, huh, this will be a funny thing.</p>
<p>I assumed it&rsquo;d be 90% no and 10% yes,</p>
<p>but there are a lot of serious people.</p>
<p>For you guys listening, I just did this random Twitter poll</p>
<p>where I was like, would you take 10 grand</p>
<p>if it meant someone random in the world died?</p>
<p>And a lot of the replies on the tweet were like,</p>
<p>hell yeah, why not?</p>
<p>And I was just not expecting that.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>I feel like your take would be better than mine.</p>
<p>Was it disturbing to you, surprising to you?</p>
<p>A little bit, yeah.</p>
<p>But obviously a lot of people were trolling,</p>
<p>but when you read through those replies,</p>
<p>I do think like 10% of them were dead serious.</p>
<p>Well, I think sometimes the trolling and the lulls</p>
<p>reveal a thing we&rsquo;re too embarrassed to admit</p>
<p>about the darker aspects of our nature.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you listen to Dan Carlin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Hardcore History podcast, he has a episode</p>
<p>on painful attainment, which he describes</p>
<p>throughout history how humans have been really attracted</p>
<p>to watching the suffering of others.</p>
<p>So public executions, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And he believes that&rsquo;s in all of us,</p>
<p>that for example, if something like a YouTube</p>
<p>or a different platform streamed a public execution</p>
<p>or streamed the torture of another human being,</p>
<p>a lot of people would say that&rsquo;s deeply unethical,</p>
<p>but they would still tune in and watch.</p>
<p>And that we&rsquo;re attracted to that drama,</p>
<p>and especially the most extreme versions of that drama.</p>
<p>And so I think part of the lulls reveal something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually true in that poll, that like-</p>
<p>Your answer is so much better than mine.</p>
<p>Do you think about that, maybe even with the squid game?</p>
<p>So I think, how many views does the squid game</p>
<p>currently have, 300 million?</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p>So just imagine, thought experiment,</p>
<p>how many views that video would get if it was real.</p>
<p>Yeah, assuming YouTube was like,</p>
<p>ah, we&rsquo;ll turn a blind eye, we won&rsquo;t take it down.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, obviously, it&rsquo;d probably have</p>
<p>billions of views.</p>
<p>How do you think you&rsquo;ll die,</p>
<p>and do you think it&rsquo;ll be during a video?</p>
<p>Probably doing something dumb like going to space</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m older, or trying to go to Mars,</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I know for a fact it won&rsquo;t be on a video.</p>
<p>Every video we do, we have safety experts</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really risk, but yeah, I could see myself,</p>
<p>like after a million people go to Mars</p>
<p>or something like that, I&rsquo;d probably be like,</p>
<p>you know what, let&rsquo;s go, and something like that, maybe.</p>
<p>So not in the name of a video, just for the holiday?</p>
<p>No, heck no.</p>
<p>Are you open to taking risks when you shoot videos?</p>
<p>You just went to Antarctica.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re putting yourself in the line</p>
<p>a little bit, right?</p>
<p>Of course, but we had that video in the works</p>
<p>for three years, and then we consult with tons of experts,</p>
<p>radar the entire path we&rsquo;re gonna walk beforehand</p>
<p>to see if there&rsquo;s crevasses.</p>
<p>So we know there&rsquo;s no crevasses, we do training,</p>
<p>we consult with experts, and we have survival guides</p>
<p>there with us, and monitor the weather and everything.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, any variable where we could get harmed,</p>
<p>we just pre-plan for it.</p>
<p>Same thing with buried alive.</p>
<p>Like, I had David Blaine, spent a week underground,</p>
<p>and so I consulted with him, and consulted with basically</p>
<p>anyone who ever buried themselves alive.</p>
<p>You know, the coffin we used to bury me,</p>
<p>we did so many tests, like that coffin was buried</p>
<p>10 times before I was, for way longer than 50 hours.</p>
<p>It tested the airflow and everything,</p>
<p>to the point where I was safer in that coffin underground</p>
<p>than I was above ground.</p>
<p>So we just tend to just not leave anything up to chance.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Another strange question then.</p>
<p>So you recorded these videos to yourself,</p>
<p>you know, five years, 10 years from now.</p>
<p>Have you recorded a video that&rsquo;s to be released</p>
<p>once you die?</p>
<p>Well, first off, I am just glad that not every one</p>
<p>of your questions have to do with, like, views</p>
<p>or things like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice getting different questions.</p>
<p>So this is good.</p>
<p>No, seriously.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little dark.</p>
<p>No, no, but it&rsquo;s fine, because a lot of people</p>
<p>just be like, how much money do you make?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just something I just,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s always about money now,</p>
<p>when people talk to me.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>But for the videos I&rsquo;ve made, for you guys</p>
<p>who probably don&rsquo;t follow me too closely,</p>
<p>when I had 8,000 subscribers and I was a teenager,</p>
<p>I filmed a bunch of videos and scheduled them</p>
<p>years in the future.</p>
<p>And I said, I filmed one where I was like,</p>
<p>high me in a year, and the video went up a year later.</p>
<p>And it was just like, hey, I think you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>100,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>And then I did one where I was like,</p>
<p>high me in five years.</p>
<p>I was like, hey, in five years,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll have a million.</p>
<p>And then one that hasn&rsquo;t come out yet,</p>
<p>but comes out in two years, was high me in 10 years.</p>
<p>And I tried to predict 10 years later</p>
<p>how many subs I&rsquo;d have.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s referring to.</p>
<p>And yes, there are some that are scheduled</p>
<p>like 20 years in the future.</p>
<p>And so if I don&rsquo;t die, I&rsquo;ll just move them up.</p>
<p>And I remember, because I filmed these though,</p>
<p>like seven years ago, but it was,</p>
<p>I remember saying a line like, you know,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m dead, then I&rsquo;m currently just in a coffin</p>
<p>and like, whatever, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And because the only way the video would go up</p>
<p>is if I&rsquo;m not alive.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m not alive, then I won&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to push back the schedule upload date.</p>
<p>So it will go public automatically.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I have a couple of those.</p>
<p>Like if I knew I was gonna die of like cancer</p>
<p>or something, and I had like three months to live,</p>
<p>I would vlog every day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d film so many videos.</p>
<p>And then I would just schedule upload a video a week</p>
<p>for like the next five years.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m still alive.</p>
<p>And I would completely act like I&rsquo;m still alive</p>
<p>and everything.</p>
<p>And I think something like that would be cool.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but I&rsquo;ve fantasized,</p>
<p>not fantasized, but I&rsquo;ve dreamt about that a lot.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know, if I only had 30 days to live,</p>
<p>what would I do?</p>
<p>And for me, I would try to make like a decade&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>of content and schedule upload it</p>
<p>so they automatically go public in the future.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just like, I never died.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just there.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a kind of immortality,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a kind of troll on the concept of time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That you can die in the physical space,</p>
<p>but persist in the digital space.</p>
<p>I actually, I recorded a video like that</p>
<p>because I had some concerns</p>
<p>and I just thought it&rsquo;s also a good exercise to do.</p>
<p>A video would like to be released if I die.</p>
<p>And it was actually a really interesting exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Like it shows like what you really care about.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s like writing a will,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re younger,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think about that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Mine was just dumb.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m bones in a coffin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yours is probably so serious.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s fun actually.</p>
<p>What you realize is like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no point to be serious at this point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird thing.</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;ve done this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a weird thing to address the world</p>
<p>when you, the physically you, is no longer there.</p>
<p>So like, you know this would only be released</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re no longer there.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a weird exercise.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s funny?</p>
<p>Of all the people listening to this,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re probably the only two people</p>
<p>that have made videos for when we die.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like such a niche thing</p>
<p>and the fact that we&rsquo;re bonding over it&rsquo;s kind of funny.</p>
<p>I think people should think about doing that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about YouTube,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also social media.</p>
<p>Just think about it.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s gonna be a last tweet</p>
<p>and a last, I don&rsquo;t know, Facebook post,</p>
<p>a last Instagram post.</p>
<p>And yeah, I feel like there&rsquo;s some aspects</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s meditative to just even considering</p>
<p>making a post like that.</p>
<p>And also it&rsquo;s a way for the people that love you</p>
<p>to kind of like celebrate.</p>
<p>Do you think that would help them cope or not?</p>
<p>Like if someone randomly watching this did film a video,</p>
<p>you know, for if they accidentally died</p>
<p>in some freak accident to be given to their family,</p>
<p>do you think that would?</p>
<p>And it was like a genuine.</p>
<p>I think it would really help.</p>
<p>I mean, it depends.</p>
<p>Like how would you even intro that?</p>
<p>Like, hey mom, if you&rsquo;re seeing this,</p>
<p>you know, it means I&rsquo;m probably dead.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you intro it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opener.</p>
<p>Oh, I just wanted you to know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I guess you could say in a kind of funny way,</p>
<p>but and just talk about the things</p>
<p>that mean a lot to you.</p>
<p>Because otherwise you&rsquo;re at the risk</p>
<p>of the last post you have is like,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know, talking shit about like McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, 100 years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I do recommend it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Stoics meditate on death every day</p>
<p>in the same way you kind of meditate on your death</p>
<p>when you make a video like that.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s actually not just even talking to yourself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s talking to the world.</p>
<p>And it like, for some reason, at least for me,</p>
<p>they made it very concrete that there&rsquo;s going to be an end.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s almost, it&rsquo;s over for me.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m making the video, it&rsquo;s over for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thought experiment.</p>
<p>I recommend people try it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death, by the way?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard because like, what if you just die</p>
<p>and then you just see nothing forever?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah, the nothingness.</p>
<p>It just fades to blackness and you&rsquo;re just like that</p>
<p>for trillions upon trillions to billions squared years.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>But also before you&rsquo;re born,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t remember those X amount of years either.</p>
<p>So that gives me a little comfort,</p>
<p>but no, it&rsquo;s definitely very scary.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;d rather not think about until I&rsquo;m like 80.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll deal with that problem then.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I told you this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m kind of hopeful that someone like Elon</p>
<p>or one of these like freak smart people</p>
<p>would just like be like, you know what, screw it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to figure out a way where we can slow down aging,</p>
<p>get it where, you know, we can live to be two, 300 years old</p>
<p>and just like set their sights on that.</p>
<p>And then just kind of save us.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be really nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost absurd to think that in our lifetime,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t figure out a way</p>
<p>to just even slightly slow down aging,</p>
<p>where we can live to be like 120 or 130.</p>
<p>And then that extra time,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t figure out some way where we can live to be 200.</p>
<p>Like obviously not immortal,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t see how in my lifetime,</p>
<p>the life expectancy doesn&rsquo;t just expand.</p>
<p>Well, it also could be that the immortality</p>
<p>is achieved in the digital realm.</p>
<p>Like it could be long after you&rsquo;re gone</p>
<p>as a Mr. Beast run by a Chad GPT type system.</p>
<p>Yeah, that consumes everything I ever said,</p>
<p>everything I ever wrote.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>I want to live.</p>
<p>What are you smart people out there?</p>
<p>Figure it out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep you entertained,</p>
<p>but I need you to figure out how to keep me alive.</p>
<p>Give me till 200.</p>
<p>That will make me happy.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Who owns the identity of Mr. Beast</p>
<p>once the physical body is gone?</p>
<p>Like, is it illegal to create another Mr. Beast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s Chad GPT based?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the laws are on that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, once I&rsquo;m dead, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Well, you just said you did care.</p>
<p>I mean, there could be a AI,</p>
<p>like many Mr. Beasts that are created after you&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;d be cool to be able to like train up a model</p>
<p>and let them loose.</p>
<p>So my content lives on, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it somehow feels like it diminishes</p>
<p>the value you contribute.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inauthentic, but it&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some aspect to the finiteness of the art</p>
<p>being necessary for its greatness.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The second that thing starts spamming out videos,</p>
<p>the videos lose all meaning and it&rsquo;s pointless</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a money grab.</p>
<p>If you ran YouTube for, how long should you run it?</p>
<p>For a year, how would you change it?</p>
<p>How would you improve it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard because, you know, obviously I&rsquo;m biased</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re doing really well,</p>
<p>but I feel like when I open up YouTube on my television,</p>
<p>I get the videos I want to watch.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t ever open it and wonder like,</p>
<p>what are these?</p>
<p>What are these 10 videos on my homepage?</p>
<p>When I click on a video, I don&rsquo;t ever wonder</p>
<p>what these are.</p>
<p>Like I, I, and maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m very adamant</p>
<p>about like the kind of videos I watch</p>
<p>and I try not to watch videos</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t want to get recommended more</p>
<p>because I just, that&rsquo;s how I think.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m very happy with how it is at the moment.</p>
<p>I think one thing though, that I just hate</p>
<p>with the passion is the comment section on YouTube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so bad.</p>
<p>But that, I know that&rsquo;s not something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to 10X the growth of the platform.</p>
<p>But if you think about it, you go to Reddit to read comments</p>
<p>and somehow like the, you know, usually the top 20 posts</p>
<p>on a popular Reddit post are not spam.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, have you ever clicked on something</p>
<p>on the front page of Reddit?</p>
<p>And then most upvoted reply to it is like,</p>
<p>go check out my site right here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like trying to scam you out of $1,000.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t even think of one instance</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever had that happen.</p>
<p>So like Reddit, it&rsquo;s so nice to click on posts</p>
<p>and just see what people have to say.</p>
<p>And I almost wish like you had that same feeling</p>
<p>when you read the comments on a YouTube video.</p>
<p>Instead, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s so many people</p>
<p>just copy and pasting, so many bots</p>
<p>that just grab the top comment for your previous video</p>
<p>and paste it over.</p>
<p>So the top comments on every videos are the same.</p>
<p>And the things that break through that</p>
<p>are just scammers trying to get you</p>
<p>to give them $1,000 for a fake ad.</p>
<p>That comment section is one of the most lively</p>
<p>on the internet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be amazing if YouTube invested</p>
<p>in creating an actual community,</p>
<p>like where people could do high effort comments</p>
<p>and be rewarded for it, like on Reddit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like actually write out a long thing.</p>
<p>That would make me so happy.</p>
<p>Cause like when I upload a video,</p>
<p>I usually go to Twitter to see feedback.</p>
<p>Like I read my comments and I&rsquo;ll flip through newest,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just, I feel like Reddit and Twitter</p>
<p>just give me so much better filtered feedback.</p>
<p>Especially now that with Twitter Blue,</p>
<p>because people pay $8 a month,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed like any tweets I get from verified users now,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re usually not just garbage troll takes.</p>
<p>Like these are people paying $8 a month.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re usually relatively sensible.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been pretty nice.</p>
<p>Like after I upload a video,</p>
<p>I just go on the verified tab on Twitter</p>
<p>and just see what people have to say.</p>
<p>And anyways, I live for the day that YouTube&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>What do you think about Twitter?</p>
<p>What do you think about all the fun activity</p>
<p>happening recently since Elon bought Twitter?</p>
<p>I think he should make me CEO.</p>
<p>Like I tweeted.</p>
<p>Well, I should say sort of,</p>
<p>we just like a couple hours ago had a conversation</p>
<p>with Elon and you guys sent an exchange</p>
<p>of some excellent ideas.</p>
<p>So yeah, I legitimately think,</p>
<p>obviously you&rsquo;re exceptionally busy,</p>
<p>but I legitimately think it would be awesome</p>
<p>if you somehow participate in the future of Twitter.</p>
<p>Yeah, it would be fun.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s so much possibility of different ideas</p>
<p>first in the sort of the content,</p>
<p>like dissemination, hosting,</p>
<p>and all the different recommendations,</p>
<p>like the search and discovery,</p>
<p>all the things that YouTube does well.</p>
<p>I think the most exciting thing is he&rsquo;s willing to move fast.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of interesting things</p>
<p>that come out of it because he&rsquo;s just moving quick.</p>
<p>And a lot of these more mature platforms</p>
<p>just take years to do the simplest stuff</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very bureaucratic.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see which way it goes</p>
<p>when you just kind of take a move quick, break things,</p>
<p>whatever type approach to social media.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually pretty curious</p>
<p>to see what features he rolls out.</p>
<p>So what would be your first act as Twitter CEO?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t spoil it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I gotta get hired.</p>
<p>What do you think about video on the platform?</p>
<p>On Twitter?</p>
<p>Yeah, do you think that&rsquo;s an interesting,</p>
<p>or is it like messing with the medium,</p>
<p>the nature of the platform?</p>
<p>I think Twitter will always be closer to TikTok</p>
<p>than it is to YouTube,</p>
<p>at least in its current form.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see 20 minute, one hour long videos or whatever,</p>
<p>even 15 minute videos being watched over there.</p>
<p>I see it more as like the short and snappy stuff</p>
<p>closer to TikTok.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>Twitter is a really good comment section for the internet.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s almost weird why,</p>
<p>like why doesn&rsquo;t Twitter allow you to embed YouTube videos?</p>
<p>Like why does, you should just ask Elon that.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a YouTube thing,</p>
<p>but when a YouTuber posts a video,</p>
<p>why do they have to link to YouTube?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t they just embed it on Twitter</p>
<p>and you just play it there?</p>
<p>I mean, wouldn&rsquo;t that just solve a lot of problems?</p>
<p>Yeah, but then the two companies</p>
<p>would have to agree to integrate each other&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it seems like a win-win.</p>
<p>I mean, well, it&rsquo;s more of a win for Twitter</p>
<p>because then people don&rsquo;t have to leave the platform.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;d be the easiest solution.</p>
<p>But who gets, like when you watch the ads</p>
<p>on a YouTube video that&rsquo;s embedded in Twitter,</p>
<p>who gets the money?</p>
<p>It would still be YouTube, but at least then,</p>
<p>right now, people just post a link</p>
<p>and it takes you off Twitter</p>
<p>and it just kills your session time on Twitter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>But yeah, because the Twitter,</p>
<p>whatever the dynamics of the comments,</p>
<p>especially once the spam bots are taken care of,</p>
<p>Twitter just works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really nice.</p>
<p>So Reddit is a nice comment section for the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like slower paced, more deliberate,</p>
<p>like higher effort.</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s like this high paced,</p>
<p>like ephemeral kind of stream,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s the upvoting and the downvoting</p>
<p>works much better because you can do retweeting, right?</p>
<p>Because the social network is much stronger</p>
<p>than it is on YouTube.</p>
<p>Like the interconnectivity between-</p>
<p>On Reddit, you&rsquo;re gonna get,</p>
<p>the top replies are gonna be the most refined ones,</p>
<p>whereas Twitter, stuff flows to the top</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not super refined.</p>
<p>But like you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more off-the-cuff stream of consciousness,</p>
<p>which a lot of people prefer</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a little more personal.</p>
<p>How do you think Twitter compares to YouTube</p>
<p>in terms of how you see its future on role in 2023?</p>
<p>I mean, I think YouTube&rsquo;s gonna be YouTube</p>
<p>and not much is really gonna change,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna keep growing just because,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just what it does,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s owned by Google.</p>
<p>But Twitter, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s one of those things,</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t predict if a year from now</p>
<p>an economy&rsquo;s gonna be in a recession or booming.</p>
<p>And I think Twitter&rsquo;s kind of the same thing.</p>
<p>One thing&rsquo;s for certain,</p>
<p>a lot of things are gonna be rolled out,</p>
<p>but who knows, honestly.</p>
<p>You responded to Elon saying Twitter&rsquo;s unlikely</p>
<p>to be able to pay creators more money than YouTube.</p>
<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, because I think the tweet I responded to</p>
<p>is one where he was saying that users will jump over</p>
<p>if Twitter can potentially pay more than other platforms.</p>
<p>And I was just saying,</p>
<p>obviously because Google has Google AdWords,</p>
<p>and I mean, that&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s whole thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s putting ads on stuff.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been doing it better than anyone else in the world</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unlikely in the next few years</p>
<p>that Twitter&rsquo;s gonna just magically, or any platform,</p>
<p>give a creator the ability to make higher CPMs</p>
<p>than on YouTube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of crazy.</p>
<p>Like some creators in December,</p>
<p>Q4, because ad rates are higher</p>
<p>because of Christmas and everything,</p>
<p>some creators literally make like $30, $40 per 1,000 views.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s after YouTube&rsquo;s cut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost hard to think about how high the RPMs get.</p>
<p>And even then, once you pull out of finance and cars,</p>
<p>the high CPM niches, and you move into just normal stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still just crazy.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of creators,</p>
<p>and the fact that all of them get these multi-dollar CPMs</p>
<p>at scale, it&rsquo;s pretty beautiful.</p>
<p>So you do, I don&rsquo;t know what you would call them,</p>
<p>but like integrated ads in your videos,</p>
<p>and you do it, I would say, masterfully.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like part of the video.</p>
<p>Are you talking about brand deals?</p>
<p>Brand deals, is that what you would call that?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a brand deal, it&rsquo;s part of the video.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still really exciting to watch,</p>
<p>and yet there&rsquo;s a plug for the brand.</p>
<p>In general, just brand deals, since you brought it up.</p>
<p>Integrating them well.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something a lot of creators don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Like, they&rsquo;ll just do a brand deal out of the blue.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll just be filming a video,</p>
<p>and then around the three minute mark,</p>
<p>just start talking about a random company.</p>
<p>And I feel like if you don&rsquo;t want viewers to click away,</p>
<p>and you want people to not get pissed off,</p>
<p>and call you to sell out,</p>
<p>you gotta find a way to integrate it into content.</p>
<p>And ideally, use the money in the video to make it better.</p>
<p>The easiest thing you do when you do a brand deal</p>
<p>is just tell people how you&rsquo;re using money</p>
<p>from the brand deal to make your content better.</p>
<p>And if you do that, no one cares.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re supporting you for it.</p>
<p>And you go from being a sellout to like,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m doing this to make better videos for you guys.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can share,</p>
<p>but with those brands, when you have discussions with them,</p>
<p>are they strict about how long</p>
<p>you need to be talking about it?</p>
<p>Or is it more about they&rsquo;re leaving control to you</p>
<p>about the artistic element of it?</p>
<p>The problem is the ones who don&rsquo;t give us</p>
<p>the artistic element,</p>
<p>we just don&rsquo;t really work with anymore.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>we get 100 million views a video now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say I know how to entertain them</p>
<p>and convert them better than these random brands.</p>
<p>So yeah, if they don&rsquo;t give us that freedom,</p>
<p>I just won&rsquo;t work with them.</p>
<p>So you have that leverage,</p>
<p>but for smaller creators, it&rsquo;s a lot harder.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they&rsquo;re gonna just say 45 seconds,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you say, take it or leave it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like pretty brutal.</p>
<p>Because I think just in general,</p>
<p>if brands were more accommodating</p>
<p>to let creators tell their story of the brand</p>
<p>and talk about the brand in a way</p>
<p>that felt a little more natural,</p>
<p>I think A, it&rsquo;d be less cringe.</p>
<p>People would be less likely to go,</p>
<p>tap, tap, tap, skip.</p>
<p>And obviously it would convert better.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re just so afraid</p>
<p>and they want this standardized thing.</p>
<p>Say these words in 45 seconds,</p>
<p>right here at this three minute mark.</p>
<p>Yeah, I often think about how to resist that.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t do them though, right?</p>
<p>Not on YouTube, right.</p>
<p>On the audio, I do ads in the very beginning</p>
<p>and I say, you can skip them if you want.</p>
<p>The brand loves that.</p>
<p>Like the point is they,</p>
<p>so the funny thing about podcasts</p>
<p>is different than YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Podcast people actually do listen to ads a lot</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s slower paced</p>
<p>and they like the creator voice,</p>
<p>like talking about the thing.</p>
<p>But in general, I just don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>you should be talking about a thing for a minute exactly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be effective.</p>
<p>I want to see the data for that.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s much more effective is the way you do ads,</p>
<p>which is like integrating to the content,</p>
<p>put a lot of effort into making a part of that,</p>
<p>like doing the brand deals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to have that conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a very strenuous conversation</p>
<p>you have to have with brands.</p>
<p>You have to each one at a time.</p>
<p>And I just wish there was more of a culture to say,</p>
<p>the quality of the ad read matters a lot more</p>
<p>than the silly parameters,</p>
<p>like the timing of it,</p>
<p>how long it is, the placement of it,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What percentage of your viewers</p>
<p>do you think have seen one of my videos before?</p>
<p>What percentage of the viewers on YouTube, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, of your viewers.</p>
<p>Of the viewers on YouTube, though,</p>
<p>because most of the people-</p>
<p>Okay, sure.</p>
<p>Or all of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just interesting</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re speaking very specifically</p>
<p>like about my brand deal process.</p>
<p>And so in my head, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>hmm, I wonder what percentage of these people</p>
<p>even have any idea what he&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I love the thinking about numbers.</p>
<p>The whole time we were having this conversation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all I could think about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, God damn it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably like 50% of these people</p>
<p>have no fucking clue what he&rsquo;s saying,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re about to torture him for five minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, probably.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s something I can&rsquo;t turn off in my brain.</p>
<p>Less than 50%.</p>
<p>Is that a good thing or a bad thing?</p>
<p>Is that exciting to you?</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s like 50% of people</p>
<p>have not watched a MrBeast video.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that an opportunity?</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess it&rsquo;s an opportunity, bro.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Honestly, I was just kind of excited to hang out with you.</p>
<p>Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>Today was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Who cares if there&rsquo;s mics?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it was kind of like having a buddy</p>
<p>to go along the journey</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m just kind of eating shit</p>
<p>and doing my normal grind.</p>
<p>It was like kind of fun.</p>
<p>And also you just say really wise stuff constantly.</p>
<p>So honestly, no, I never even put any thought</p>
<p>into like the demographics or what I could gain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just interesting,</p>
<p>because like my retention brain,</p>
<p>when you talk about something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m instantly like, hmm,</p>
<p>what value are they going to get?</p>
<p>How many of them are going to be interested?</p>
<p>What percentage of people do I think will lose?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like running all those calculations</p>
<p>in the background,</p>
<p>and that whole conversation,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just something I can&rsquo;t turn off.</p>
<p>My like bells are like,</p>
<p>error, error, this is bad.</p>
<p>What are the different strategies for high retention?</p>
<p>For your videos and in general?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how do you cook good food?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the same kind of question.</p>
<p>I see, so there&rsquo;s so many different ways that you,</p>
<p>so it boils down to,</p>
<p>I mean, do you think at the level of a story,</p>
<p>or do you think like literally watching</p>
<p>five seconds at a time,</p>
<p>am I going to tune out here?</p>
<p>Am I going to tune out here?</p>
<p>Am I going to tune out here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of it.</p>
<p>You need the overarching narrative,</p>
<p>and then you also need the micro</p>
<p>where every second needs to be entertaining.</p>
<p>And basically what&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>is the longer people watch something,</p>
<p>the more likely they are to keep watching.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to try as hard</p>
<p>in the hypothetically back half of a video</p>
<p>as you do in the front.</p>
<p>Like even right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so deep into this where a lot of people listening</p>
<p>are probably just going to keep listening</p>
<p>relatively close to the end,</p>
<p>unless we just have a really boring part</p>
<p>of this conversation,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re just in it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re immersed.</p>
<p>And so a big, like to really boil it down</p>
<p>to a simple level,</p>
<p>you just want to get people</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re immersed in the content,</p>
<p>and then just kind of hold them there.</p>
<p>We had this discussion offline.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>I should mention that this is like late at night.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>What time is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>And I only slept one hour last night</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m an idiot,</p>
<p>and I flew to the wrong location.</p>
<p>Well, here, we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s just book you a hotel to fly.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, I got it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, you sure?</p>
<p>We can just do it.</p>
<p>We always do this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, I got it.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to have to rub it in.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>And then today,</p>
<p>come to find out he flew to the wrong airport,</p>
<p>or a city with a similar name to ours.</p>
<p>Same name.</p>
<p>Same name in a different state.</p>
<p>And I was like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you should have let us book it.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s on one hour of sleep,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s literally been dying all day.</p>
<p>Before this podcast,</p>
<p>he downed like two things of coffee.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been going all day hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>I got to interact with you.</p>
<p>I should say that this gave me an opportunity to,</p>
<p>I got a ride from a stranger,</p>
<p>and it was an incredible person.</p>
<p>I got to interact with him.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many kind people around here.</p>
<p>Just like this kind of Southern energy.</p>
<p>And then I got to go to a diner,</p>
<p>because I could,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only one hour between me arriving</p>
<p>and having to fly out.</p>
<p>So I went to a diner.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really kind waitress that called me honey.</p>
<p>So that was a beautiful moment.</p>
<p>I was so confused.</p>
<p>You tweeted about that.</p>
<p>And like,</p>
<p>Steele&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Lex, my assistant,</p>
<p>was like,</p>
<p>Lex isn&rsquo;t here yet.</p>
<p>And I saw your tweet,</p>
<p>and I was like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>Steele&rsquo;s like, no, he&rsquo;s still flying.</p>
<p>I was like,</p>
<p>an hour ago,</p>
<p>he just tweeted about a nice diner.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize you flew to the wrong-</p>
<p>It was a diner.</p>
<p>It was a diner in a different state.</p>
<p>And then you had to fly over here.</p>
<p>And then I called you,</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>I was like, hmm.</p>
<p>I was like,</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s not adding up.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel like it&rsquo;s such an idiot,</p>
<p>because apparently the world</p>
<p>has cities like Springfield, right?</p>
<p>Every single state has a Springfield.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a-</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a Simpsons joke, right?</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s the city in the Simpsons is Springfield,</p>
<p>and I think every single state,</p>
<p>or most of them have a Springfield.</p>
<p>And the same is true for Georgetown.</p>
<p>I think the most popular,</p>
<p>I forget what the most popular one was.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a list of these.</p>
<p>People get,</p>
<p>when they run out of ideas,</p>
<p>they just keep using the same thing over and over.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re your Achilles&rsquo; heel.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got to meet a bunch of people from your team.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just incredible human beings.</p>
<p>So let me just ask on that topic.</p>
<p>How do you hire a great team?</p>
<p>What have you learned about hiring for everything,</p>
<p>for the main channel that you do,</p>
<p>for the React, the gaming channel,</p>
<p>to MrBeastBurger, to Feastables, all that?</p>
<p>The big thing is,</p>
<p>especially in this content creation,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not like anything that&rsquo;s done on Netflix</p>
<p>or different content medians.</p>
<p>I really need people who are coachable</p>
<p>and really see the value in what I care about,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very specific way of going about things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a thing you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no one plug and play.</p>
<p>If Netflix wanted to hire someone to do a documentary,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably tens of thousands of people you could hire</p>
<p>that have worked on documentaries before.</p>
<p>But if you want to hire someone</p>
<p>to make super viral YouTube videos, like we do,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just no one you can really pull from.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll hire people from game shows.</p>
<p>They have all these preconceived notions about pacing</p>
<p>and how a video should be.</p>
<p>And you have to spend the first year</p>
<p>breaking all these habits,</p>
<p>and they think they&rsquo;re better than you.</p>
<p>A lot of people in traditional think they&rsquo;re better,</p>
<p>and they think their way is better than what we do.</p>
<p>And so for me, it&rsquo;s almost easier to hire people</p>
<p>that are just hard workers,</p>
<p>that are obsessed and really coachable,</p>
<p>and just train them how to be good</p>
<p>at content creation and production,</p>
<p>than to hire someone from traditional,</p>
<p>which is the only way to really do it,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not that many YouTube channels</p>
<p>that have scaled up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s a huge talent pool</p>
<p>of people who&rsquo;ve worked on YouTube channels.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easier just to train someone</p>
<p>than just pull them from traditional,</p>
<p>because traditional people just, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>they have all these opinions and things,</p>
<p>and they just think our way of going about things is dumb.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you want people who have the humility</p>
<p>to have a beginner&rsquo;s mind, even if they have experience.</p>
<p>And see the value.</p>
<p>Like, actually, you&rsquo;ll still get it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so crazy, especially some of my other friends</p>
<p>that are scaling up their YouTube channels.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that will come on,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll ask them, like,</p>
<p>what do you want to be doing in five years?</p>
<p>And instead of saying,</p>
<p>oh, I want to be working on this channel,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be like, oh, I hope to be working on movies,</p>
<p>or this or that.</p>
<p>And they see working on a YouTube channel</p>
<p>as a launchpad to go into traditional.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, you just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>This is the future.</p>
<p>This is the end goal.</p>
<p>This is your career.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m just so tired</p>
<p>of having those kinds of conversations.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like people really should be coming around.</p>
<p>Are there, like, recurring interview questions that you ask?</p>
<p>Is there ways to get?</p>
<p>Yeah, but the biggest thing is,</p>
<p>like, what do you want to be doing in 10 years?</p>
<p>And if their answer isn&rsquo;t making content on YouTube,</p>
<p>or if their answer is anything like movies</p>
<p>or traditional stuff like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like just a hell no.</p>
<p>Like, it just won&rsquo;t even remotely work.</p>
<p>Oh, so you really want people</p>
<p>to believe in the vision of YouTube?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, ideally, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, working here, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s less about the medium</p>
<p>and more about just being on a great team</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing epic stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and yeah, the media as well.</p>
<p>Because those, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s hard to put into words,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just two completely different ways</p>
<p>of going about things.</p>
<p>You know, like, our videos aren&rsquo;t scripted.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s a lot more run and gun.</p>
<p>And if we hypothetically blow up a giant car or whatever,</p>
<p>like, you only have one take, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not scripted.</p>
<p>And so you have to over-film, over-shoot things,</p>
<p>over-compensate for, like, the dumb way of going about it.</p>
<p>And a lot of traditional people would be like,</p>
<p>well, just plan what you&rsquo;re gonna say</p>
<p>and just plan the angles.</p>
<p>You can cut the cameras in half.</p>
<p>You can save 50 grand here.</p>
<p>You can save, you know, $75,000 in editing.</p>
<p>This and that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, but that&rsquo;s not authentic.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s, you know, blah, blah.</p>
<p>You get it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost so obvious that it hurts</p>
<p>that I have to, like, constantly have these conversations,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s what we live in.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a detail, like, there&rsquo;s a taste.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve watched a bunch of videos with you</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s clear to you that you&rsquo;ve gotten really good,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right word is, style or taste,</p>
<p>to be able to know what&rsquo;s good and not</p>
<p>in terms of retention, in terms of just stylistically,</p>
<p>visually.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to think.</p>
<p>I can just watch a video and it just screams in my head,</p>
<p>like, this is what should change</p>
<p>based on the, you know, million videos I&rsquo;ve watched</p>
<p>and all these viral videos I&rsquo;ve consumed.</p>
<p>Like, this is blah, blah, blah, what&rsquo;s optimal</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like your brain&rsquo;s like a, you know,</p>
<p>like a neural net.</p>
<p>Like, if you consume enough viral videos</p>
<p>and enough good content that you just kind of start</p>
<p>to, like, train your brain to, like, see it</p>
<p>and see these patterns that happen</p>
<p>in all these viral videos.</p>
<p>And so that, anytime I watch a video or a movie or anything,</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t stop thinking about what is optimal.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, it gives me a headache sometimes</p>
<p>when I watch something too slow or I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s optimal</p>
<p>and obviously my taste isn&rsquo;t the end all be all,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s something that kind of torments me,</p>
<p>if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>Oh, you can&rsquo;t enjoy a slow-moving, like, movie?</p>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not to say there&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Godfather is horrible.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to watch that movie, like, three times,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not to say slow movies are bad.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s an audience for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just obviously not what I&rsquo;ve trained my brain to like.</p>
<p>And social media and YouTube right now,</p>
<p>like, that&rsquo;s just not the meta.</p>
<p>And in general, like you said, in neural network,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re training your brain in part on actual data, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually, it&rsquo;s data-driven.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking at, like, in terms of thumbnails</p>
<p>and titles and different aspects of the first five,</p>
<p>10 seconds, and then throughout the video,</p>
<p>the retention, all of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at all of that for your own videos</p>
<p>to understand how to do it better.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where the neural network is training.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Basically, there are ways you can kind of see, like,</p>
<p>the most viewed videos on YouTube every day</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And I just kind of consume those every single day,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been doing that for way too many years.</p>
<p>And you just start to notice patterns.</p>
<p>Like, the thumbnails on the most viewed videos</p>
<p>or videos that go super viral tend to be clear,</p>
<p>tend to not have much clutter, tend to be pretty simple.</p>
<p>Titles tend to be less than 50 characters.</p>
<p>Intros tend to be this.</p>
<p>Stories tend to be this.</p>
<p>And you just kind of, like,</p>
<p>after you see those thousands</p>
<p>and then tens of thousands at a time,</p>
<p>it just starts to click in your head.</p>
<p>Like, this is what it looks like, you know?</p>
<p>So how are you able to transfer that taste</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve developed to the team?</p>
<p>So for, like, because you&rsquo;ve said, like, broad things,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a million detailed things.</p>
<p>Like, what zoom to use on the face</p>
<p>to use in the thumbnail, right?</p>
<p>The answer is whatever makes the best video.</p>
<p>Because the problem is the more,</p>
<p>I have so many friends who are like this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll make, like, checklists for their editors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll make, you know, this beat and this beat.</p>
<p>And you need to have, like, a three-part arc and then this.</p>
<p>But the problem is that&rsquo;s how you,</p>
<p>the more constraints you put on the team,</p>
<p>the more repetitive and less innovation you get.</p>
<p>And the more, like, you know, after 10 videos,</p>
<p>people are gonna be like, all right, I&rsquo;ve already seen this.</p>
<p>So to me, and I&rsquo;m 24, and, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably, my mindset will change over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>I just haven&rsquo;t been in this industry too long.</p>
<p>But the only way to, like, really make innovative content</p>
<p>and keep things fresh is to not put constraints on,</p>
<p>or put as little as possible.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m very hesitant on all that stuff.</p>
<p>Because the more I say, the more they&rsquo;re gonna be like,</p>
<p>oh, then that&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>And then, you know, I&rsquo;ll say one time, like,</p>
<p>oh, you know, ideally there&rsquo;s a cut every three seconds.</p>
<p>And the next thing you know, every video,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a cut every three seconds or whatever.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard because I try to give as little,</p>
<p>not training, but as little facts as possible</p>
<p>and more just make suggestions, if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>You mean publicly or to your team?</p>
<p>To my team, yeah.</p>
<p>So you talked about sort of teaching your voice</p>
<p>or your style, whatever we want to call it,</p>
<p>to other people on the team so they can be kind of</p>
<p>a Mr. Beast replacement.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the process of teaching that?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to-</p>
<p>No, I got you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more talking about like,</p>
<p>what I would call almost like cloning, right?</p>
<p>Like Tyler and other people like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So when we were hanging out today,</p>
<p>I was showing him how we have multiple people</p>
<p>in the company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like talking to the camera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a habit.</p>
<p>Yeah, you turn slowly to the camera.</p>
<p>I was like, it is a habit.</p>
<p>Is it weird to you to not be looking at the camera?</p>
<p>This whole interview,</p>
<p>I constantly have been turning towards the camera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wait, I&rsquo;m talking to him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a habit.</p>
<p>Because my whole life, I&rsquo;ve just been talking to a camera.</p>
<p>Who are you thinking about when you&rsquo;re looking at the camera?</p>
<p>Do you like imagine somebody?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fully thinking about the person</p>
<p>just sitting watching it.</p>
<p>And I almost, it&rsquo;s weird, when I&rsquo;m looking at the camera,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a camera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like in a haze picturing what the viewer is seeing</p>
<p>when they watch it, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll be saying things</p>
<p>or doing something.</p>
<p>And then like when I&rsquo;m watching,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s not what I want.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll freeze up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very weird when I&rsquo;m filming.</p>
<p>And then for people who haven&rsquo;t worked with me too much,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll think like, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s very weird.</p>
<p>Like how I go about it.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;ll just be doing whatever,</p>
<p>like lighting a firework.</p>
<p>This is a thousand dollar firework.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll go to light it and I&rsquo;ll like freeze.</p>
<p>Cause in my head, I&rsquo;m like this, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like how that flowed or how that shot looked.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I can perfectly picture what I&rsquo;m filming</p>
<p>by just looking at the camera</p>
<p>and then putting myself through the lens of the camera</p>
<p>while making content.</p>
<p>I can do it at the same time.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like real time editing the video.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s something that didn&rsquo;t at the start</p>
<p>come natural to me,</p>
<p>but in the last probably like five years it&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>And so I would say it&rsquo;s one of my greatest strengths,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know how I developed it.</p>
<p>But anytime I&rsquo;m filming anything,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s almost like the right side of my brain.</p>
<p>I can just look at it and I see exactly what I&rsquo;m filming</p>
<p>and I can just picture it.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s probably recording the video,</p>
<p>being the talent for the video,</p>
<p>and then watching the editing</p>
<p>and like analyzing it carefully</p>
<p>and do that over and over and over and over.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do that 10,000 times, yeah.</p>
<p>You do the editing more than being in front of the camera.</p>
<p>So like you start to see yourself</p>
<p>from that third person perspective.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then maybe that actually helps</p>
<p>with the nerves of it too.</p>
<p>Like you see it as creating a video versus performing, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, I&rsquo;ve never been nervous talking to a camera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder for me to talk to a person</p>
<p>than it is to talk to a camera,</p>
<p>which I feel like a lot of people say that though,</p>
<p>that are whatever, make content, right?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that so many times.</p>
<p>Or maybe not, maybe I&rsquo;m just awkward and dumb.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re practiced.</p>
<p>To me, I mean, both are terrifying,</p>
<p>but being in front of the camera by yourself is most-</p>
<p>So much easier.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, so much easier.</p>
<p>I prefer it a million times over.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s my whole life, you know?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve spent more of your time talking to people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It becomes natural.</p>
<p>And I talk to a piece of plastic.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I guess you&rsquo;re talking to a person too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just on the other side of the camera.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s just a pixel on a screen.</p>
<p>So cloning, how do you achieve the-</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>This whole rabbit trail.</p>
<p>So I was showing him that I have a lot of people</p>
<p>in the company who are able to think like me</p>
<p>and basically make decisions like I would make</p>
<p>if I was like, if you were asked,</p>
<p>hey, in this video, should we climb a mountain</p>
<p>or should we dig a hole, right?</p>
<p>And like, you know, they would pick the same answer</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d pick 90 plus percent of the times.</p>
<p>And so like one example is Tyler, who I was showing you</p>
<p>when he was pitching some content.</p>
<p>And you could see like this, he was on point.</p>
<p>And basically for just four or five years,</p>
<p>we just spent an absurd amount of time together</p>
<p>and worked on every single video together</p>
<p>and we worked side by side.</p>
<p>And same thing with my CEO, James.</p>
<p>He literally lived with me for a couple of years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of just like finding people</p>
<p>who are super obsessed and all in and A players that,</p>
<p>you know, they really just want to be great.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just dumping everything I have in them.</p>
<p>And like you were saying,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;d love to find that and develop that.</p>
<p>You were saying you&rsquo;re basically for a long time</p>
<p>just said everything you were thinking to them.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Like James, the guy who&rsquo;s basically my right hand man</p>
<p>right now, for two years, he lived with me.</p>
<p>And we probably talked on average</p>
<p>over those two years, seven hours a day.</p>
<p>I mean, anytime I had a phone call,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d throw it on speaker and I&rsquo;d let him listen.</p>
<p>Anything I was reading, any content I was consuming,</p>
<p>like really just training his brain to think like me.</p>
<p>So that way he could just do things without my input,</p>
<p>without me having to constantly watch over him</p>
<p>or give him advice.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve gotten.</p>
<p>Like, so for the first six months, he didn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>He just studied me and studied everything I cared about</p>
<p>and how I spoke and blah, blah.</p>
<p>And then the next six months,</p>
<p>he started taking on some responsibilities</p>
<p>and now he can just run the company</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t ever really have to check in on him.</p>
<p>Most of the decisions he makes are exactly what I would do.</p>
<p>And so I call that cloning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what other people would,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just like finding people that are really obsessed</p>
<p>and they just kind of really want it</p>
<p>and just being like giving them an avenue to get it,</p>
<p>if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>Another way to see it is you&rsquo;re converging</p>
<p>towards a common vision</p>
<p>and that makes like brainstorming much more productive.</p>
<p>Yeah, it just makes it where I don&rsquo;t have to be so involved</p>
<p>in everything because I just have these people</p>
<p>I know will think like I will,</p>
<p>at least relatively close to it.</p>
<p>So I can kind of almost be in multiple places at once per se.</p>
<p>And so these things that, you know,</p>
<p>I still approve every idea we film and, you know,</p>
<p>everything before we film it, all the creative, I approve it,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have to like be in the weeds and nuances</p>
<p>and do all this minor stuff.</p>
<p>I can just let them handle it.</p>
<p>I can just do the more macro things.</p>
<p>I got a chance to sit in</p>
<p>to a lengthy brainstorming session with Tyler and others.</p>
<p>That was really cool.</p>
<p>Can you talk about the process of that,</p>
<p>of people pitching ideas and you pitching alternatives</p>
<p>or shutting down ideas and just going,</p>
<p>like plowing through ideas very quickly?</p>
<p>I mean, you kind of just described exactly what we did.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, but the ideas are really, really good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just tossing out like different categories of ideas</p>
<p>and then also fine tuning them to see like,</p>
<p>how do I change,</p>
<p>like thinking about the titles and the thumbnails.</p>
<p>I work so well off of inspiration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s something like, give me any word.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like a relative. Space.</p>
<p>Space, yeah.</p>
<p>Like I went to space, you know,</p>
<p>what happens if you blow up a nuke in space</p>
<p>or I went to the moon, I went to Mars, right?</p>
<p>Because you said that one word,</p>
<p>it was able to inspire me to come up with four ideas.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s for me,</p>
<p>if the way to get a hundred million views on videos,</p>
<p>you need something original, creative,</p>
<p>something people really need to see,</p>
<p>ideally never been done before, all these like things.</p>
<p>And so you need like,</p>
<p>if you want to consistently go super well,</p>
<p>you need just a constant stream of ideas.</p>
<p>And the only way I&rsquo;ve really found</p>
<p>that I can consistently come up</p>
<p>with a hundred million view videos</p>
<p>is to intake inspiration and then see what my brain outputs.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s kind of at its core foundation,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m doing there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like intaking a lot of random inspiration</p>
<p>to see what spawns in my mind so I can output it.</p>
<p>But the neural network of your brain</p>
<p>is generating the video, the title,</p>
<p>the thumbnail, all like jointly, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that only comes because I spent 10 years of my life</p>
<p>just obsessively studying all that stuff.</p>
<p>Because you, I mean,</p>
<p>it seems like you would literally</p>
<p>potentially shut down a video</p>
<p>just because you can&rsquo;t come up with a good title.</p>
<p>Yeah. Or a good thumbnail.</p>
<p>Or a thumbnail, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what happened to 70% of those</p>
<p>in that pitch session.</p>
<p>I was just like, oh, what was one of them?</p>
<p>Genius versus a hundred people, or?</p>
<p>Yeah, like maybe average intelligence</p>
<p>versus genius or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was like, what the heck is the thumbnail?</p>
<p>Even if the title is good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many, but yeah,</p>
<p>if people don&rsquo;t click, they don&rsquo;t watch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting, but you developed over time</p>
<p>the ability to kind of give it,</p>
<p>what makes for a good title, short?</p>
<p>Not just short, it&rsquo;s also, I mean,</p>
<p>if someone reads it, do they have to watch it?</p>
<p>Is it just so intrinsically interesting</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just gonna fuck with them</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t click on it, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t have to be short,</p>
<p>but it has to be, like, you almost want to have</p>
<p>a retention to word-by-word reading.</p>
<p>Ideally, it&rsquo;s a title also that,</p>
<p>you know, because the titles don&rsquo;t live in a vacuum, right?</p>
<p>So it has to lead into the content.</p>
<p>So ideally, the title represents content</p>
<p>that you would want to watch for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s a 20-minute video,</p>
<p>and the title is, I stepped on a bug,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna, because it&rsquo;s all of it combined.</p>
<p>The click-through rate is gonna be much lower</p>
<p>than if it was like a five-second video.</p>
<p>People might click it.</p>
<p>Like, even nuances of the length of the video</p>
<p>based against the title</p>
<p>will affect whether people want to click it,</p>
<p>because sometimes they just all add up.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s that, yes.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want it below 50 characters,</p>
<p>because above 50 characters on certain devices,</p>
<p>you run the chance of it going dot, dot, dot.</p>
<p>So like, I took a light pole,</p>
<p>and I saw how many dollar bills I could stack on top,</p>
<p>and they would just go dot, dot, dot,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too long, and it can&rsquo;t finish it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the worst thing,</p>
<p>because then people don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re clicking on,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s gonna do even worse.</p>
<p>Short, simple, ideally,</p>
<p>and just so freaking interesting, they have to click.</p>
<p>And it is a good segue into the content,</p>
<p>and it represents the length of the content.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to convert into words for you,</p>
<p>like, I stepped on a bug,</p>
<p>versus stepping on a bug,</p>
<p>versus Mr. B stepped on a bug,</p>
<p>versus bug stepping video.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, yes, the more extreme the opinion,</p>
<p>typically the higher the click-through rate.</p>
<p>If you can pay it off in the content,</p>
<p>then it just supercharges it.</p>
<p>Oh, so you have a kind of estimate</p>
<p>of the extremeness of the content.</p>
<p>Yeah, like this water, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like, Fiji water sucks, that&rsquo;d do fine.</p>
<p>But if you said Fiji water is the worst water bottle,</p>
<p>or the worst water I&rsquo;ve ever drank in my life,</p>
<p>way more extreme opinion would do way better.</p>
<p>But you have to deliver.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then you have to deliver,</p>
<p>because the more extreme you are,</p>
<p>the more extreme you have to be in the video.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s almost inspiration for you to step up.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you can be more extreme in a positive way.</p>
<p>A lot of people, it&rsquo;s easier though.</p>
<p>Positive, negative click-bait&rsquo;s much easier</p>
<p>than positive click-bait.</p>
<p>It just is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much easier to get negative clicks.</p>
<p>And so a lot of people are just, in my opinion,</p>
<p>you know, a little bit lazier,</p>
<p>and they just take the route like,</p>
<p>oh, well, this one gets the same amount of clicks,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s easier, less effort.</p>
<p>The positive one is doing a large number</p>
<p>of numbers of something.</p>
<p>Like I spent this number of hours doing this,</p>
<p>or whatever, if you just wanted to help people.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s just harder to get 10 million views</p>
<p>on a video helping people</p>
<p>than it is to get 10 million views</p>
<p>on a video tearing down a celebrity.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Or whatever negative video you want to insert there.</p>
<p>Well, that said, most of your videos are pretty positive.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But not a lot of people do those kinds of videos,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re hard.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re hard.</p>
<p>Some of that is giving away money, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the secret to that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, how do you do that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, give away money, or?</p>
<p>In a video to make it compelling.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a number that is better than another number,</p>
<p>the higher number is always better than the lower number.</p>
<p>Yeah, for the most part.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>like some videos will give away a million dollars,</p>
<p>some videos will give away half a million.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not really, I guess,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m retracting what I just said.</p>
<p>I was more joking with that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no difference whether I put 500K or a million.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably not even really a difference</p>
<p>between 100K or a million, I haven&rsquo;t really looked into it.</p>
<p>Like some of our, most of our videos</p>
<p>are not us giving away a million dollars,</p>
<p>and sometimes the million dollar videos</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t do as well as the other ones.</p>
<p>So there is a certain point where a dollar amount</p>
<p>is just a large dollar amount to an average human.</p>
<p>And so I think that point is 100K.</p>
<p>Like anything above 100K,</p>
<p>the average human is just like, that&rsquo;s a lot of money.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, 100K and a million like,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really move the needle, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Which that&rsquo;s a very nuanced piece of information</p>
<p>that applies to very few people, but yeah.</p>
<p>Well no, I think it applies, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating, human,</p>
<p>our relationship with money is fascinating.</p>
<p>Like why is it so exciting to get,</p>
<p>I mean, I, you know, the times I&rsquo;ve found</p>
<p>like 20 bucks in the ground are like incredible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, right, why?</p>
<p>Why are you so happy?</p>
<p>Like what exactly is so joyful about that?</p>
<p>I mean, it depends where you are in life,</p>
<p>what the situation is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a gamified aspect to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I get it,</p>
<p>like why people want to see people win money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just interesting that past 100K,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really seem to make a difference.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the same, basically.</p>
<p>So you found that to be true</p>
<p>with all the money you&rsquo;ve given away?</p>
<p>I just think click-through rate,</p>
<p>like obviously in terms of someone receiving it,</p>
<p>yeah, a million dollars changes their life drastically more.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the difference, like,</p>
<p>oh, if you wanted to, you could really quit your job.</p>
<p>As opposed to 100K, it&rsquo;s like, not really.</p>
<p>You probably do like a scientific study,</p>
<p>like a formula, giving away money to click-through rate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There could be some kind of diminishing return.</p>
<p>It definitely, the returns level off</p>
<p>dramatically after 100K.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically the premise.</p>
<p>What about 10,000?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s 10, 100,000, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>because this is such a small niche thing,</p>
<p>but yeah, 100,000 does, from what I see in our videos,</p>
<p>get more clicks than 10,000,</p>
<p>but the difference between 100,000 and a million</p>
<p>is just so little.</p>
<p>I just, I think big number, big number to a lot of people</p>
<p>past that point.</p>
<p>Yeah, so for 100,000, you can,</p>
<p>like given the average salary,</p>
<p>you can probably live for a year,</p>
<p>given what the average salary is in America.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like a big, that feels-</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s also just more</p>
<p>when they read the title.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s a lot of zeros.</p>
<p>Fuck loads of zeros.</p>
<p>Okay, click.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh man, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So on the thumbnail side, again,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be much harder to say probably,</p>
<p>but you know, offline, you know,</p>
<p>I got a chance to look at a bunch of thumbnails</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fascinating which ones do well</p>
<p>and which ones don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say</p>
<p>about what are the elements of a thumbnail that work well?</p>
<p>Or is this also deeply instinctual?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s where, yeah, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>Like how do you cook good food?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s easier if you pull up a thumbnail</p>
<p>and I can be like, that&rsquo;s why that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Like an example would be like one of my friends,</p>
<p>he just uploaded a video recently and I called him.</p>
<p>I was like, what is this?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s a very, very smart guy.</p>
<p>And in the thumbnail, he&rsquo;s getting chased by cops,</p>
<p>but the cops were wearing yellow vests.</p>
<p>So they didn&rsquo;t look at cops.</p>
<p>So I was like, well, why are the cops</p>
<p>in your thumbnail wearing yellow vests?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that makes it so much more boring.</p>
<p>And he was like carrying a flag,</p>
<p>but the pole and the color of the flag were the same color.</p>
<p>So I was like, it&rsquo;s a lot harder to see the flag.</p>
<p>I was like, also you&rsquo;re wearing like a shirt</p>
<p>with like five different colors.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s hard to tell what even,</p>
<p>what your outline is.</p>
<p>And then in the background, there are cars.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, if you have cops chasing you,</p>
<p>why not make the cars cop cars?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, cause in my head, I&rsquo;m like, dang,</p>
<p>if he just did those like four or five things,</p>
<p>the video probably would&rsquo;ve got like seven X of views.</p>
<p>How much iteration?</p>
<p>Cause I also got a chance to see the number of iterations</p>
<p>you do on a, on just a brand of thumbnails.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a problem now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an addiction.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>So you kind of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of the versions are really good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do you know what to like stop?</p>
<p>I love how you, when we pulled up that,</p>
<p>the burger one and we were flipping through them,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, that&rsquo;s version like one of like a thousand.</p>
<p>But even the sketch, the idea was good.</p>
<p>Like already even the original idea is strong.</p>
<p>Yeah. So we, one of our coming up videos,</p>
<p>we made the world&rsquo;s largest plant-based burger</p>
<p>and the thumbnail we were thinking is like</p>
<p>me standing beside the burger cause it&rsquo;s six feet tall.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>So like just picture a giant six foot tall burger,</p>
<p>super wide thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m beside it.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like eating the world&rsquo;s largest burger.</p>
<p>Like you, that&rsquo;s just something you have to click.</p>
<p>Like, so you were saying like,</p>
<p>how would you describe a good thumbnail?</p>
<p>Like that, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like,</p>
<p>But I think you said the one I noticed first that was good</p>
<p>where you were very small in it relative to the,</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t like that one.</p>
<p>I needed to come forward a little bit.</p>
<p>And also the photo we took was just my upper body.</p>
<p>So they photo manipulated and created my legs,</p>
<p>Photoshop.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I said I didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Cause my right leg was a little like off.</p>
<p>It was like bent the wrong way.</p>
<p>Cause they had to build those legs in Photoshop.</p>
<p>Well, I mean,</p>
<p>does the physics in a thumbnail have to even make sense?</p>
<p>I mean, you can just like exaggerate the head size</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, 100%.</p>
<p>Yeah. Things don&rsquo;t have to be relative.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can have a car in the background</p>
<p>and be three times the size.</p>
<p>Cause yeah, every one of my thumbnails,</p>
<p>my face is in the, you know, left side, very big.</p>
<p>So brand recognition.</p>
<p>So just people know, oh,</p>
<p>especially cause now that a lot of people copy our videos,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just nice to like, you know,</p>
<p>everyone else might make thumbnails like this,</p>
<p>but this is mine.</p>
<p>And obviously we usually over deliver and do bigger stuff.</p>
<p>Would you recommend to other creators</p>
<p>that wanna make it big to,</p>
<p>and they see Mr. Beast and they look up to you,</p>
<p>to copy some elements of you or to really try to be unique?</p>
<p>Unique, 100% unique.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, the next Mr. Beast,</p>
<p>quote unquote, it&rsquo;s weird saying that third person,</p>
<p>but whatever, is not gonna do what I&rsquo;m doing better.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna just invent their own way.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re just not gonna do what I do better than me.</p>
<p>You know, I have so many,</p>
<p>I literally have the best people in the world working here</p>
<p>and I reinvest everything I make, even to this day.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s absurd the amount of money I spend on content</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t care, I&rsquo;ll just stop sleeping</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just film every other day.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re just not gonna beat me at my own game</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s fine, you shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t get where I am</p>
<p>by just beating someone else at their own game.</p>
<p>I just found my own lane and innovated and adapted.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that do copy me</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fine, whatever, do it,</p>
<p>but just know you&rsquo;re not gonna get to where I am doing that.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d advise you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You give away a lot of the secrets,</p>
<p>basically everything about how you operate.</p>
<p>Is there a-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hold anything back, go for it.</p>
<p>How do you think about that?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s pretty rare.</p>
<p>I think, and this is definitely not,</p>
<p>most people in my stance, I don&rsquo;t think would take this,</p>
<p>or my position would take this stance,</p>
<p>but I see every other YouTuber or person on social media,</p>
<p>even, because we&rsquo;re also focused super heavily on YouTube,</p>
<p>but last year we were also the most followed TikTok creator</p>
<p>in the world as well.</p>
<p>Actually, we&rsquo;re the most subscribed</p>
<p>to YouTube channel in the world</p>
<p>and the most followed TikTok account in the world.</p>
<p>But in general, I just see everyone else as collaborators,</p>
<p>not competitors.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think giving advice</p>
<p>and helping other creators do well in any way harms me.</p>
<p>And I think it only brings more value to my life.</p>
<p>How was it jumping on TikTok</p>
<p>and trying to understand that platform from scratch?</p>
<p>So from being a successful YouTuber</p>
<p>to understand a totally different algorithm,</p>
<p>fundamentally different algorithm, what was that like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Well, not even just the algorithm, just the content.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going from basically 15 minute short films</p>
<p>to sub one minute vertical content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole different, just ballpark.</p>
<p>And so the first little while I was doing TikTok</p>
<p>is just kind of figuring out</p>
<p>what does MrBeast look like in this short form content?</p>
<p>But recently we&rsquo;ve really started to catch our stride</p>
<p>and come up with some original concepts</p>
<p>and figure out how to innovate over there</p>
<p>just like we did on YouTube,</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t want it to just be shitty YouTube videos.</p>
<p>And so like an example is we played The Rock for 100K</p>
<p>and Rock Paper Scissors</p>
<p>and the loser had to donate 100K to charity.</p>
<p>We did, we went to random people on a campus</p>
<p>and we offered them.</p>
<p>So I said, I&rsquo;ll give you a hundred dollars</p>
<p>if you fly to Paris and give me a baguette.</p>
<p>And then they said, no.</p>
<p>And I was like, I&rsquo;ll give you $300</p>
<p>if you fly to Paris and give me a baguette.</p>
<p>And I was expecting this person to say no</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;d go up to like 10 grand.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, yes.</p>
<p>And so he flew to Paris, got a baguette</p>
<p>and brought it back and gave it to me.</p>
<p>And that across everything got like 450 million views.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s just really cool just to see this random guy</p>
<p>get on a plane, spend a day in Paris</p>
<p>and we cut it up real nicely and bring it back.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re starting to find just tons</p>
<p>of original content over there.</p>
<p>But it seems like an epic video to make for one minute.</p>
<p>Exactly, no one on short form is doing it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just so funny.</p>
<p>Cause like TikTok&rsquo;s been big for a while now, years.</p>
<p>And then, you know, as we started to really figure out things</p>
<p>on the YouTube channel and get it cranking</p>
<p>where I have some free time, we set our sights on TikTok</p>
<p>and like, okay, what are people not doing?</p>
<p>How do we make it better?</p>
<p>Put in more effort, make it good.</p>
<p>And we did the same thing we did at YouTube,</p>
<p>just different over on TikTok and it worked.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re the fastest growing</p>
<p>or most followed TikTok account in 2022.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just funny that no one else did that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not afraid to do epic stuff,</p>
<p>which also during the brainstorming.</p>
<p>Some of the ideas you were like, that&rsquo;s better as a short.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, can you remember one?</p>
<p>Cause I remember I said that a bunch</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t think of one.</p>
<p>All I remember is that there were like epic videos.</p>
<p>Like really?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to do that for a one minute video?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So like, are you posting similar content</p>
<p>to a YouTube short as a TikTok?</p>
<p>Yeah, those we just double up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard.</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s actually pretty fascinating</p>
<p>and people who do social media listening to this</p>
<p>will probably find this pretty interesting</p>
<p>is picture like the content creation meta three years ago</p>
<p>versus now where you can make sub one minute</p>
<p>vertical content and it go viral on TikTok,</p>
<p>it go viral on YouTube shorts,</p>
<p>go viral on Instagram reels,</p>
<p>it goes viral on Facebook, it goes Reddit.</p>
<p>You know, you swipe through vertical content now</p>
<p>and Twitter when you click on a video</p>
<p>and you flip through it.</p>
<p>So this is actually very weird.</p>
<p>This is the first time in the history of,</p>
<p>I guess, Western social media that one form of content</p>
<p>could actually go super viral on every single platform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never been like that before.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going viral individual.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not like interbreeding or whatever.</p>
<p>I can post something on TikTok</p>
<p>that will get a hundred million views</p>
<p>and then post it on shorts and it&rsquo;ll get 200 million views</p>
<p>and then post it on Instagram and it get 50 million views.</p>
<p>And then, you know, I haven&rsquo;t yet,</p>
<p>but you know, you can then turn around and tweet it</p>
<p>and it get tens of millions of views</p>
<p>and you can post it on Reddit</p>
<p>and it get tens of millions of views</p>
<p>and Facebook can get tens of millions of views.</p>
<p>And that just wasn&rsquo;t a thing.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Twitter didn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>because a lot of you probably don&rsquo;t even know this,</p>
<p>but when you tap on a video now and you swipe down,</p>
<p>it just turns into TikTok.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t a thing even a year ago.</p>
<p>Reddit, that wasn&rsquo;t a thing a year ago.</p>
<p>Probably two years ago, that wasn&rsquo;t a thing on Instagram.</p>
<p>Three years ago, that wasn&rsquo;t a thing on YouTube, right?</p>
<p>With YouTube shorts.</p>
<p>So this is all new.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard a single person talk about it,</p>
<p>but this is the first time where content</p>
<p>can actually go viral on every single platform.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to write or film a video for Facebook,</p>
<p>film a 12 minute video for YouTube,</p>
<p>film a sub 60 second video for TikTok,</p>
<p>write a tweet for Twitter and post this on Reddit.</p>
<p>You can just do the same thing on every platform.</p>
<p>And the fact that your content has gone viral</p>
<p>on multiple platforms regularly means</p>
<p>that virality is not accidental.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be, of course, but it can be engineered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, yeah, so many people say it&rsquo;s luck</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re just lucky or this or that.</p>
<p>But what are we up to?</p>
<p>Probably like a thousand videos over 10 million views.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t ever have a dud.</p>
<p>Like you can call it luck, but I think it can be trained.</p>
<p>I counsel YouTubers all the time</p>
<p>and show them how to go from getting</p>
<p>a couple million views a month</p>
<p>to 10 million views a month very easily.</p>
<p>And from even certain ones, like just one of my friends,</p>
<p>he was just really struggling.</p>
<p>And so I just started showing him basically everything</p>
<p>I know and just doing like once every week,</p>
<p>sometimes once every two weeks calls.</p>
<p>And he went from $10,000 a month on YouTube</p>
<p>to over 400,000, just doing these little counseling calls.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, people can make excuses all they want</p>
<p>and say it&rsquo;s just luck or say, you know, well,</p>
<p>anyways, I don&rsquo;t even want to quote all the other stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just, it is, it is a teachable skill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a learnable skill.</p>
<p>You can study your way to consistently make viral videos,</p>
<p>no matter how small your channel is.</p>
<p>Even if you have zero subscribers,</p>
<p>you could if you actually studied hard enough.</p>
<p>And like, basically if you knew what I knew</p>
<p>and some of these, so I don&rsquo;t sound so arrogant,</p>
<p>also like some of these other friends that have that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say are the smartest people in the world</p>
<p>when it comes to content creation online.</p>
<p>If you had the knowledge that was in our heads,</p>
<p>you could do it very easily.</p>
<p>I see people do it all the time.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s even more interesting is I go on podcasts</p>
<p>and I say everything I know.</p>
<p>And these people are also very open.</p>
<p>Some of them I know, it&rsquo;s all out there.</p>
<p>And a lot of people, instead of just studying that</p>
<p>and trying to absorb and apply it in their own way,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just like, no, it&rsquo;s just luck.</p>
<p>So you do lay it all out there,</p>
<p>but I gotta push back to one interesting thing.</p>
<p>I think a crucial component of your success</p>
<p>is the idea stage, the idea generation,</p>
<p>the brainstorming I heard today,</p>
<p>but getting really good at generating ideas.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the selection of the thumbnail</p>
<p>and the title, that creative process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also just the engine of generating really good ideas.</p>
<p>And getting that, I mean, I would say that</p>
<p>is probably the thing that needs to be trained the most</p>
<p>for most creators, right?</p>
<p>That they just don&rsquo;t put enough ideas on paper.</p>
<p>Yes, but also a lot of creators also just don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t either for the longest time,</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t make good enough content.</p>
<p>Content that&rsquo;s worthy of getting 10 million views.</p>
<p>In the idea or the execution of the idea?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>I mean, think about how many people just make videos</p>
<p>they film in under 20 minutes</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t really put any effort into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like my first 500 videos didn&rsquo;t deserve</p>
<p>to get a million views.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason they did.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re terrible, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>But at the time I thought they did, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the mindset of a lot of small YouTubers</p>
<p>where I thought those videos deserved a million views</p>
<p>and I thought the algorithm hated me.</p>
<p>But I watch them back now and I can tell you exactly why.</p>
<p>The videos were just fucking horrible.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Well, so what was the breakthrough for you</p>
<p>to start realizing, to start having a self-awareness</p>
<p>about these videos aren&rsquo;t good enough?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably still going through that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably still growing to see.</p>
<p>Yeah, every six months you should look back</p>
<p>and hate your videos.</p>
<p>Or at least see things you could improve</p>
<p>and be like, oh, I could have done this better, that better.</p>
<p>If not, then you&rsquo;re not learning quick enough.</p>
<p>In my opinion, at least.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the source of that learning even for you now?</p>
<p>Just look at the metrics?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I just got back from a mastermind</p>
<p>where I just got like 10 of the smartest people I knew</p>
<p>and we just locked ourselves in a cabin</p>
<p>and taught each other stuff.</p>
<p>Constantly, every day, not every day now,</p>
<p>probably every other day I go on a walk</p>
<p>and I just call random people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say, teach me something.</p>
<p>And I mean, it&rsquo;s just, you just have to have</p>
<p>a never-ending thirst for learning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very imperative, especially if you want,</p>
<p>like if you want to get on top and then stay on top.</p>
<p>The only way to do it is just to constantly be learning.</p>
<p>Or someone who is learning is just gonna have a leg up</p>
<p>on you in the knowledge game.</p>
<p>And what kind of stuff are you,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve talked about offline</p>
<p>that you just love learning of all kinds, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But in terms of videos, are you studying videos?</p>
<p>Are you studying?</p>
<p>Recently, not as much.</p>
<p>Because to get to the videos I want,</p>
<p>I have to build this business and scale up and hire.</p>
<p>So more my recent time has been,</p>
<p>like my teenage years were spent studying virality</p>
<p>and studying content creation.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m studying how to build a content company</p>
<p>so I can actually produce the crazy ideas I want to produce,</p>
<p>if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>So yeah, and that&rsquo;s the business side.</p>
<p>We talked about hiring.</p>
<p>Do you have trouble firing people?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m pretty sure almost every person,</p>
<p>yeah, actually every person I&rsquo;ve ever fired,</p>
<p>we just give them severance.</p>
<p>And I like to see it more as, it&rsquo;s no ill will.</p>
<p>Like if I fired you,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s some other job you want me to help you get,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll DM them on Twitter.</p>
<p>Like if you want to go work for, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>insert whatever, MTV, give me someone to DM.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll DM them.</p>
<p>Like I try to make it more like a transition</p>
<p>and do whatever we can to make it as easy as possible.</p>
<p>And if something was just not working for you,</p>
<p>because you want people, like you said, super passionate.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>if you hold someone onto someone</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t see being here in 10 years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just doing them a disservice.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just giving them more ingrained,</p>
<p>more enrooted in where they are.</p>
<p>And the sooner you do it</p>
<p>and help them move on to their new life, the better.</p>
<p>Given all the wisdom you have now,</p>
<p>if you were to give advice to somebody,</p>
<p>or if you were to start over again,</p>
<p>you had no money,</p>
<p>what would be the first 10 videos you tried to make</p>
<p>on a new channel?</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s advice for a new person.</p>
<p>And nobody knows you.</p>
<p>Yeah, and nobody knows me.</p>
<p>Yeah, hypothetically, I have a mask on.</p>
<p>And you also, I guess, don&rsquo;t have the wisdom.</p>
<p>But if I don&rsquo;t have what I have in my head,</p>
<p>then I would say just fail.</p>
<p>A lot of people get analysis paralysis,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll just sit there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll plan their first video for three months.</p>
<p>Any of you listening,</p>
<p>especially if you have zero views on your channel,</p>
<p>your first video is not gonna get views, period.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Your first 10 are not gonna get views.</p>
<p>I can very confidently say that.</p>
<p>So stop sitting there and thinking</p>
<p>for months and months on end,</p>
<p>and just get to work and start uploading.</p>
<p>All you need to do,</p>
<p>this applies to people who have not uploaded videos,</p>
<p>but have dreams of being a YouTuber,</p>
<p>is make 100 videos and improve something every time.</p>
<p>Do that.</p>
<p>And then on your 101st video, we&rsquo;ll start talking.</p>
<p>Maybe you can get some views.</p>
<p>But your first 100 are gonna start.</p>
<p>There are very freak cases,</p>
<p>like Liza Koshy or Emma Chamberlain,</p>
<p>who have really good personalities,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t take them as many videos.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just people who are seven foot five</p>
<p>and making the NBA.</p>
<p>Yes, there are freak cases you can find.</p>
<p>But for the average person like us,</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have these exceptional personalities</p>
<p>and backgrounds in filmmaking,</p>
<p>just make 100 videos, improve something each time,</p>
<p>and then talk to me on your 101st video.</p>
<p>Well, the improve something each time is the tricky one.</p>
<p>How do you improve something each time?</p>
<p>The second one, just, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>put more effort into the script.</p>
<p>The third one, try to learn a new editing trick.</p>
<p>The fourth one, try to figure out a way</p>
<p>that you can have better inflections in your voice.</p>
<p>The fifth one, try to, you know,</p>
<p>study a new thumbnail tip and implement it.</p>
<p>The sixth one, try to figure out a new title.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s infinite ways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of content creation online.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally infinite ways,</p>
<p>from the coloring, to the frame rate,</p>
<p>to the editing, to the filming, to the production,</p>
<p>to the jokes, to the pacing,</p>
<p>to every little thing can be improved.</p>
<p>And they can never not be improved.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally no such thing as a perfect video.</p>
<p>So if you knew everything you know now, but no money?</p>
<p>Step one would, I&rsquo;d just brainstorm, like,</p>
<p>okay, I don&rsquo;t have money.</p>
<p>What are some viral things?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, the first thing that comes to my mind</p>
<p>is something as simple as when I count to 100,000,</p>
<p>which is what I did do when I was poor.</p>
<p>And I like that work.</p>
<p>But like, what&rsquo;s something like that I could do</p>
<p>that would be even more attention-grabbing?</p>
<p>Yeah, you were, as part of the brainstorm,</p>
<p>you would throw out a lot of ideas,</p>
<p>and people would throw out a bunch of ideas,</p>
<p>and one of the questions is, is this even doable, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, first off, come up with ideas</p>
<p>you think would do well,</p>
<p>and then ask yourself later if they&rsquo;re doable.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s different ways</p>
<p>you can accomplish something.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be cynical about the doability of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, because there really are so many different ways</p>
<p>you can accomplish a goal.</p>
<p>Like, when we give away an island,</p>
<p>like we gave our 100 million subscriber an island,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t find private islands</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t look like shit for less than $10 million.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t doable, right?</p>
<p>All right, the idea doesn&rsquo;t exist, not doable, x it off.</p>
<p>But then you dig into it,</p>
<p>and you find different alternatives,</p>
<p>and you find, okay,</p>
<p>what if we just buy a $2 million island that sucks,</p>
<p>and then spend a million dollars importing some sand,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s build a beach, let&rsquo;s import 300 trees,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s build a little bit of canal, let&rsquo;s cut some paths,</p>
<p>boom, now it&rsquo;s a really nice island,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually affordable,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t have $10 million to spend on a video,</p>
<p>but we can afford to spend three and a half,</p>
<p>and lose whatever, a million dollars on that video.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an example of, yeah,</p>
<p>if you just went off the gut test,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be like, this isn&rsquo;t doable.</p>
<p>Every island&rsquo;s $10 million, we&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
<p>If we go cheaper, it&rsquo;s just a terrible island, no.</p>
<p>And so there are so many different ways</p>
<p>you can achieve what you want,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve really got to push through notes,</p>
<p>which not a lot of people do.</p>
<p>You have to have more of a dominant personality,</p>
<p>and just a willingness to,</p>
<p>when people tell you it&rsquo;s not possible,</p>
<p>just actually go through all the variables,</p>
<p>and eliminate them all yourself.</p>
<p>Have a stubbornness, and a resilience to failure, maybe.</p>
<p>For what we do, and creators online,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very imperative that you have,</p>
<p>that a no isn&rsquo;t a no to you,</p>
<p>that you really have to think,</p>
<p>and just, we take personality tests,</p>
<p>and just having a dominant personality</p>
<p>is a better indicator that when someone tells you,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;re gonna build a brick wall</p>
<p>for under 100 grand, you&rsquo;ll be like, okay,</p>
<p>and then still go check the next 10 vendors,</p>
<p>and figure it out.</p>
<p>Yeah, what advice would you give</p>
<p>to an already established channel,</p>
<p>like with one, two, three, four million subscribers,</p>
<p>how to 10x it, increase it, without losing maybe?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s very, channel by channel.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t give general advice.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, because if I do,</p>
<p>millions of creators are gonna see this,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re gonna do it,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna fuck them over.</p>
<p>Oh, I see, I see.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I had two million subscribers</p>
<p>on this podcast,</p>
<p>like how would you 10x that without sacrificing what it is?</p>
<p>10x your stuff.</p>
<p>Does it matter?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked about with success.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s different for everyone.</p>
<p>Like, is 10xing your definition of success?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well then, right off the bat, it&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t give a shit about 10xing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even harder to 10x.</p>
<p>He does this because he likes helping people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve found throughout this day.</p>
<p>Every time I talk data, it&rsquo;s so funny with him,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>you could do this to get more views,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll just be like, blank.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t register anything.</p>
<p>He just doesn&rsquo;t care, which is really cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really nervous about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really nervous about the numbers affecting,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fun to focus on the numbers,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really worried about that,</p>
<p>but at the same time, you should be cognizant of that,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve created not just some</p>
<p>of the most watched videos,</p>
<p>but some of the most amazing videos ever.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a strong correlation there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re selling your soul</p>
<p>to make a highly viewed video.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, if you look at the metrics,</p>
<p>it helps you understand what is compelling and not.</p>
<p>And so I feel like I am,</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s some value to investigate</p>
<p>what work, when people tune on and when not,</p>
<p>to be more data-driven, even on podcasts.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m really afraid of that.</p>
<p>On the flip side, I think part of the appeal</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t care about that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But there could be stuff</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything with that,</p>
<p>and it has to do with stylistic choices</p>
<p>of lighting and cameras,</p>
<p>or maybe with, for example, topics.</p>
<p>Even what you&rsquo;ve asked me here</p>
<p>is different than what most people ask me.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it could be,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;d be nice to understand that,</p>
<p>but again, I&rsquo;m worried about polluting</p>
<p>the creative process.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this is a true case</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s your own intuition.</p>
<p>You know your viewers better than anyone else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s whatever.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;d like to push back on that.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You do.</p>
<p>Who else?</p>
<p>Name one person who knows your viewers better than you.</p>
<p>Somebody that looks at numbers of podcasts?</p>
<p>No, you know your viewers.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re the only,</p>
<p>how many episodes have you done?</p>
<p>350.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not paying attention.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the only one who&rsquo;s watched</p>
<p>every second of all 350 of them, probably.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not, no, I haven&rsquo;t, but the, okay.</p>
<p>Well, because you did it,</p>
<p>so you do know what&rsquo;s in all of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your content, it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, you do,</p>
<p>and this is just one of those moments</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re an intelligent guy</p>
<p>and you just have to trust your instincts.</p>
<p>Just think, what is the typical ex-viewer,</p>
<p>and what do they want?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think like that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all you would have to do,</p>
<p>and whatever your gut tells you,</p>
<p>that would be the best guess.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what the typical viewer is, though.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, because to investigate,</p>
<p>that would be very, very difficult,</p>
<p>and then you have to start looking at the numbers.</p>
<p>You have to start to consider the demographics.</p>
<p>The only way I know that anybody even watches it</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;ll sometimes run into people,</p>
<p>like when I run along the river,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d be like, I love you, Lex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, well, that&rsquo;s a data point,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like cool people,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t have any other,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to know who listens to boxes.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of who&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re so huge that everybody watches.</p>
<p>Yeah, but no, I still do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say if you were to just put a gun to my head</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, all right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna pick a random person</p>
<p>that watched your last video,</p>
<p>and you have to roughly guess what they are,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re not close, we&rsquo;ll kill you.</p>
<p>I would say probably a teenager that plays video games.</p>
<p>That would be probably the typical one,</p>
<p>and then there are people that are maybe</p>
<p>a little bit younger,</p>
<p>a lot of people that are older as well,</p>
<p>but in a random sample size, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a male boy that plays video games.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way I would describe it,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t try to pertain to them.</p>
<p>I just make whatever I think is interesting</p>
<p>and good content,</p>
<p>and this is what we were talking about before.</p>
<p>Even though, hypothetically, 35 to 40% of my audience</p>
<p>is women, which is less than the majority,</p>
<p>if we get 100 million views a video,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still 30 to 40 million females</p>
<p>that watch every video,</p>
<p>which is probably the largest views per video</p>
<p>for women on the whole platform,</p>
<p>which you wouldn&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a single other creator</p>
<p>that gets more women to watch their videos than that,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s just anything,</p>
<p>even people above the age of 30,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s only three or 4%,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still three to 4% of 100 million views</p>
<p>is a lot of people that age,</p>
<p>so we hit a large group of every demographic,</p>
<p>if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>So what if we look at other,</p>
<p>maybe more challenging kinds of channels, or not,</p>
<p>but if we look at educational, for example,</p>
<p>like lectures, or if we look, yeah, educational,</p>
<p>it could be short videos,</p>
<p>like how would you 10x that?</p>
<p>Like something on robotics, on biology,</p>
<p>on science, on engineering, on all of that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more educational focused.</p>
<p>We would honestly just have to pull the,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the same way,</p>
<p>if you went to Gordon Ramsay and you said,</p>
<p>how would a new cook cook better?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, and you gotta-</p>
<p>Oh, so even then, that&rsquo;s not even a specific,</p>
<p>you have to go channel by channel.</p>
<p>You really do, or I&rsquo;m giving horrible advice,</p>
<p>because if there was these just golden rules,</p>
<p>everyone would do it, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like if there&rsquo;s these magical little principles.</p>
<p>How quickly, when you look at a channel,</p>
<p>can you kind of give advice?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like surface level at the start,</p>
<p>and then the more, if we watch 10 videos,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;d have a good profile,</p>
<p>and I could tell you, in my opinion,</p>
<p>especially once I look at the analytics,</p>
<p>and I get more ingrained in like,</p>
<p>okay, the typical viewer&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re from here, here&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re feeling, you know?</p>
<p>Because there are people who make videos for rednecks,</p>
<p>and like the redneck&rsquo;s taste of content</p>
<p>is just so much different than,</p>
<p>obviously, women watching makeup videos,</p>
<p>which are so much different than, you know,</p>
<p>teenage boys watching a Minecraft video.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just all different.</p>
<p>So the biggest thing you have to do</p>
<p>is put your head in the headspace of the viewer,</p>
<p>and see the content how they would.</p>
<p>Because if you just try to only give your taste,</p>
<p>which is what a lot of people do,</p>
<p>and things from your perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very biased, and it&rsquo;s just not gonna work for everyone.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually how you do more harm than good,</p>
<p>which is something I&rsquo;m very careful of.</p>
<p>Yeah, but at the same time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just generating a lot of ideas.</p>
<p>I think the first time I&rsquo;ve talked to you</p>
<p>was on Clubhouse, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I mentioned something about robots,</p>
<p>and like almost immediately,</p>
<p>you went to generating a bunch of ideas around robots.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, easily.</p>
<p>A hundred robots versus a hundred humans.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How far can a robot throw a potato?</p>
<p>I think your idea, like the first idea,</p>
<p>was because you just said so many ideas</p>
<p>I never even thought of,</p>
<p>but it shows the value of basically brainstorming</p>
<p>with people that think differently.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>my ideas are probably, you know,</p>
<p>might lean towards some people</p>
<p>a little bit younger than your audience,</p>
<p>like some of the stuff I&rsquo;ve-</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still ideas,</p>
<p>like I think the first one you said,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about a quadruped,</p>
<p>like robot dogs,</p>
<p>you said to replace a biological dog with a robot dog</p>
<p>and see if the owner notices something.</p>
<p>You were just quickly brainstorming different ideas</p>
<p>of like how-</p>
<p>This was years ago.</p>
<p>I remember it though.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I mean, it&rsquo;s like, oh yeah,</p>
<p>I never really thought about that kind of,</p>
<p>sort of, it&rsquo;s the basic,</p>
<p>the tension between what does it take for a robot</p>
<p>and an AI system to replace the biological systems</p>
<p>that we, the biological creatures that we love</p>
<p>in our lives, yeah.</p>
<p>And, but like, that was like the pace of idea generation</p>
<p>was the thing that struck me today and in general.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s how you get at good videos</p>
<p>is you keep-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to make a video around a good idea,</p>
<p>obviously, than a bad one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just setting yourself up for success.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s for 10xing already popular channel.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hardest number?</p>
<p>You said the numbers that matters,</p>
<p>click-through rate, average view duration, and surveys.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hardest number to optimize for?</p>
<p>Probably surveys, you know.</p>
<p>Do you have any,</p>
<p>do you have an insight into the surveys at all?</p>
<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>But if you just click on a bunch of random videos online,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll eventually get a survey.</p>
<p>Was this video transformative, heartwarming, inspiring?</p>
<p>What people rate does make a difference.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you can get people to click a video,</p>
<p>you can get them to watch it,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t really fake whether or not they&rsquo;re satisfied.</p>
<p>Like, they don&rsquo;t lie, the surveys, you know.</p>
<p>Maybe one person here and there might troll,</p>
<p>but once you aggregate enough,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pretty clear telltale of the video.</p>
<p>So either you&rsquo;re making a great video or you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Minimizing the non-regrettability.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think Elon tweeted that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s trying to do on Twitter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically the survey metric,</p>
<p>how happy you are that you&rsquo;ve been using the platform.</p>
<p>Elon tweeted, we want to limit the amount</p>
<p>of regrettable minutes people spend on Twitter.</p>
<p>And the first thing I thought, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something YouTube already has a lot,</p>
<p>their whole survey system and feedback loop.</p>
<p>How tough is it to take on YouTube, you think?</p>
<p>For Twitter?</p>
<p>Yeah, for Twitter, for anybody else.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna be basically impossible.</p>
<p>I mean, YouTube&rsquo;s not going anywhere.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s gonna do</p>
<p>what YouTube does better than them,</p>
<p>at least not in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>You asked on Twitter, would you rather have $10 million</p>
<p>or 10 million subscribers on YouTube?</p>
<p>What would your own answer be</p>
<p>at various stages in your career?</p>
<p>If I had nothing, I would say $10 million.</p>
<p>Because with $10 million, you can hire some people</p>
<p>and pump out content with like a million or two,</p>
<p>get 10 million subscribers,</p>
<p>and then keep the other eight million.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s if you believe in your ability</p>
<p>to grow a channel, if you&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, if you, yeah, if you don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>in your ability to grow a channel,</p>
<p>then you shouldn&rsquo;t take the 10 million subscribers,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just gonna kill the channel.</p>
<p>So the 10 million is definitely,</p>
<p>a better question would be,</p>
<p>would you rather have a million dollars</p>
<p>or 10 million subscribers?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it gets a little tricky.</p>
<p>Because now it&rsquo;s like, hmm,</p>
<p>you know, a million dollars,</p>
<p>life-changing amount of money.</p>
<p>But you know, if you semi-knew what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably make a million dollars</p>
<p>off a 10 million subscriber channel,</p>
<p>but there is a little bit of risk.</p>
<p>A million dollars might not be enough</p>
<p>to build a strong team,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know how to do it,</p>
<p>so you might waste all of that money.</p>
<p>Yeah, or they just keep it and retire, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah, because 10 million is just so high,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, just never work again, who cares?</p>
<p>For the average human, that&rsquo;s so much money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to me also,</p>
<p>to the value of the subscriber</p>
<p>versus the value of the dollar.</p>
<p>I suppose, how valuable is a subscriber for,</p>
<p>like what percentage of the videos,</p>
<p>like how active are the subscribers</p>
<p>in watching the video for you?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I was actually thinking more about the subscriber to dollar.</p>
<p>Like, if someone has 10 million subscribers,</p>
<p>have they made 10 million dollars?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that kind of popped in my head.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thought.</p>
<p>Do you ever, when you analyze videos,</p>
<p>do you ever analyze videos,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve talked about offline,</p>
<p>of other videos across YouTube in general,</p>
<p>just to understand trends,</p>
<p>to understand social behavior and other things?</p>
<p>Not all, but a lot of the questions are analytics-based.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a giant social experiment, right?</p>
<p>Like what people like to watch, what people share.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a fascinating look.</p>
<p>So, like I said before,</p>
<p>what percentage of your audience</p>
<p>do you think care about this kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Like this deeply about YouTube analytics.</p>
<p>I think a large amount care about</p>
<p>curiosity and exploration of interesting ideas.</p>
<p>So in that sense, yeah, this was fitted.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>This is funny.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t me like trying to,</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>And I actually, I loved your Magnus one.</p>
<p>And even your Hikaru one was really good,</p>
<p>and a bunch of other ones.</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;re getting to the point now</p>
<p>where only analytics junkies</p>
<p>would want to keep hearing more analytics talk.</p>
<p>And the normie is probably like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had their dose of YouTube talk</p>
<p>for the next three years.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>Comment if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>I could be, I don&rsquo;t know your audience.</p>
<p>See, this is where you would tell me,</p>
<p>shut up, I know my audience, you dumb ass.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t at all.</p>
<p>I actually, I just follow the thread of curiosity.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s just a lot of curious humans</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>And to me, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>so the question about analytics</p>
<p>is the question of basically stepping away,</p>
<p>stepping outside of yourself and thinking,</p>
<p>why the hell do I like TikTok so much?</p>
<p>Why do I like Twitter so much?</p>
<p>Why do I like YouTube so much?</p>
<p>And getting, even if you&rsquo;re not a creator,</p>
<p>getting an insight into that is really interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what?</p>
<p>Because all these platforms</p>
<p>are fundamentally changing the nature of content.</p>
<p>People are reading books less.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably going to be watching movies less and less.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably going to be watching Netflix less and less.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about the sort of the darker side</p>
<p>of YouTube and with shadow banning and censorship</p>
<p>and all that kind of topics,</p>
<p>especially if you see it in other platforms like Twitter,</p>
<p>that Elon recently highlighted the shadow banning</p>
<p>that was happening and in general,</p>
<p>the censorship that was happening on those platforms.</p>
<p>Do you think about the role of centralized control</p>
<p>of which information is or isn&rsquo;t made available</p>
<p>through search and discovery?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest.</p>
<p>I never really think about it, so.</p>
<p>You just try to make fun videos that-</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m kind of more in my own lane,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t just specifically think about it.</p>
<p>I just like a lot of stuff in general.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kind of in my own lane,</p>
<p>thinking about my own stuff.</p>
<p>But now that you asked, I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on YouTube and that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m generally against centralized censorship</p>
<p>or shadow banning.</p>
<p>Shadow banning is the worst one</p>
<p>because not that the goal of creating a healthy platform</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re having great conversations</p>
<p>and videos that are not spreading misinformation,</p>
<p>that sounds like an admirable goal,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s too difficult of a job for a centralized entity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too big of a responsibility.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s the misinformation stuff,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s also just like the videos</p>
<p>where they do something that causes,</p>
<p>what happened back in the day, the adpocalypse.</p>
<p>A lot of creators&rsquo; revenue plummets</p>
<p>because people are doing videos</p>
<p>that advertisers don&rsquo;t deem acceptable,</p>
<p>and then now all these big advertisers are pulling,</p>
<p>and the little guys are getting hit</p>
<p>because ad rates dropped by 30%,</p>
<p>and the person who just quit his job</p>
<p>to go full-time content creation now can&rsquo;t sustain it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also, it&rsquo;s like a lot of different variables as well</p>
<p>that makes it so complicated.</p>
<p>Well, I think the big thing is transparency,</p>
<p>especially around shadow banning for people.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>On shadow banning, you should be transparent.</p>
<p>You should let people know.</p>
<p>Obviously, there has to be some type of controls.</p>
<p>People can&rsquo;t just post whatever,</p>
<p>and so if you&rsquo;re pulling those levers,</p>
<p>they should at least know.</p>
<p>Yeah, so they know how to improve their content,</p>
<p>they can understand it, they can-</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a wrong shadow banning,</p>
<p>like as a society,</p>
<p>that we should not shadow ban this kind of content,</p>
<p>that means you should be publicly discussing it</p>
<p>and having that-</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not known, then it&rsquo;s just kind of like,</p>
<p>well, then who&rsquo;s pulling the strings?</p>
<p>And how do we know they&rsquo;re not just manipulating things</p>
<p>to get whatever message they want out there</p>
<p>and silence other ones?</p>
<p>Yeah, and there could be sort of in the background</p>
<p>government influence,</p>
<p>which is where actual freedom of speech comes into play,</p>
<p>that the government should not have any control</p>
<p>or be able to put pressure on censorship of speech.</p>
<p>And it gets weird if none of that is being,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no transparency around it yet.</p>
<p>But to be fair, that&rsquo;s a huge responsibility.</p>
<p>The amount of content that YouTube,</p>
<p>is uploaded on YouTube,</p>
<p>that is shared by YouTube, viewed by YouTube-</p>
<p>But even more of a reason why</p>
<p>it would probably make sense to be transparent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because then people can help fact-check it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But that requires building a platform</p>
<p>that makes that easy, right?</p>
<p>Like to make fact-checking easy,</p>
<p>to make the, like Twitter now has,</p>
<p>like being able to share context</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Crowdsource it.</p>
<p>Crowdsource it the way Wikipedia crowdsource it.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then you open a random Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>But like, you know, people criticize Wikipedia</p>
<p>because there is a political lean</p>
<p>to the editors of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>And then they get, there&rsquo;s some articles</p>
<p>that definitely have a bias to them</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difficult problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>That ultimately, as much as possible,</p>
<p>it would be nice for the viewer to have control of that</p>
<p>versus the entity that&rsquo;s hosting it.</p>
<p>So for the viewer to decide-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you figure that stuff out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to make fun-</p>
<p>Cool videos?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, let&rsquo;s go to Antarctica again.</p>
<p>How was that?</p>
<p>How was going to, you just came back from Antarctica.</p>
<p>That was, I watched the video.</p>
<p>That was, that was fun.</p>
<p>That was a really fun video.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>I can comment about that, but what was that,</p>
<p>what was the hardest part of making that video?</p>
<p>The hardest part was just getting out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so remote.</p>
<p>You know, you land the plane on just this ice runway</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so sketchy.</p>
<p>And then once the plane takes off, you&rsquo;re just there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the most remote place on the planet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s very breathtaking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, if you have the chance to ever go to Antarctica,</p>
<p>I would recommend it.</p>
<p>It was probably like the, in the video,</p>
<p>we climbed a mountain that wasn&rsquo;t named,</p>
<p>so we can name it.</p>
<p>And like standing on top of that mountain</p>
<p>and just seeing kind of like nothing.</p>
<p>Because once you get outside the outskirts</p>
<p>and you get deep in Antarctica,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no penguins, nothing lives there at all.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s just nothing in every direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just snow and these crazy beautiful mountains</p>
<p>and some of them stick into the clouds.</p>
<p>And if you go during summertime, the sun never goes down.</p>
<p>So the sun&rsquo;s up 24 seven and it&rsquo;s just like spinning</p>
<p>in circles at the top of the planet or whatever.</p>
<p>It looks like the top.</p>
<p>Yeah, you guys commented several times how beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so it&rsquo;s just, yeah, it&rsquo;s just very beautiful.</p>
<p>What about shooting itself,</p>
<p>like the technical aspects of shooting it?</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, well, so somehow we lucked out.</p>
<p>One of the days was like the warmest day</p>
<p>in like forever that&rsquo;s been in Antarctica.</p>
<p>It was like, it was positive degrees,</p>
<p>but at certain parts it was also like negative 20,</p>
<p>negative 30.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the cameras,</p>
<p>you constantly have to be switching out the batteries</p>
<p>and heating them up and like putting them basically</p>
<p>in like your pants or they&rsquo;ll just get way too cold.</p>
<p>And we were prepared for much worse,</p>
<p>but it ended up being much better than we thought.</p>
<p>So for that video, but in general,</p>
<p>maybe some other challenging videos,</p>
<p>how do you go from the idea stage</p>
<p>to the actual execution to the final video?</p>
<p>Can you take me through like a full process of,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re talking about some crazy wild ideas today.</p>
<p>How do you go from that to a final video</p>
<p>where you click publish?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, obviously first things first,</p>
<p>you gotta figure out the idea and then it just depends.</p>
<p>I mean, pick any video you can think of on my channel.</p>
<p>I can take you through it.</p>
<p>Well, what about the, in a circle?</p>
<p>You have to stay in a circle for 100 days.</p>
<p>Yeah, so for that one, step one.</p>
<p>One of the most popular.</p>
<p>Yeah, that video did really well.</p>
<p>So we, problem is we have to,</p>
<p>this is where you get really into the nuances of the company</p>
<p>because we have a lot of videos going out.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just in a vacuum be like,</p>
<p>all right, we&rsquo;re not doing anything for 100 days.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only filming this.</p>
<p>So step one is we had to build an independent crew</p>
<p>that could actually do that for 100 days.</p>
<p>That way everyone else could keep working</p>
<p>on the normal videos and not just screw everything up.</p>
<p>So step one, you build that team.</p>
<p>Okay, we got the team.</p>
<p>Now what do we need?</p>
<p>Well, to do this, we need probably like 10 cameras,</p>
<p>at least rolling at all times.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re probably gonna need to get a trailer</p>
<p>and hook up a bunch of storage and stuff</p>
<p>to just carry the sheer volume of footage we&rsquo;re gonna have.</p>
<p>And so get a trailer, set up the cameras,</p>
<p>go out in the field, paint a circle.</p>
<p>Now we need a house, go buy a house, bring it out there.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, oh wait, I think it&rsquo;d be funny</p>
<p>if I brought the house in on the intro.</p>
<p>Find a crane that can lift up a house</p>
<p>so I can drive it in and drop it in the intro.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like an iterative process</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, okay, this would be funnier.</p>
<p>So this is not all up front that you&rsquo;ve written.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Ideally it would be, but as you kind of see things,</p>
<p>you get inspired and then you think of more and more.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>This would be better with a crane.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;d be better if I dropped out of the house.</p>
<p>Drop it, yeah.</p>
<p>That was crazy that you decided to do that.</p>
<p>So fearless in the kind of crazy stuff you&rsquo;re willing to do.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a broken record,</p>
<p>but whatever makes the best video possible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you focus on.</p>
<p>Okay, so what about the delegation of like,</p>
<p>who gets to, what are the cameramen,</p>
<p>like the people operating the cameras?</p>
<p>What, who&rsquo;s responsible for different things?</p>
<p>Is it like a distributed process?</p>
<p>So like-</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s where whoever the lead cam</p>
<p>would be on that video would just decide it.</p>
<p>That one, cause we shot over a hundred days.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t, a lot of it was just Sean</p>
<p>and the guy who was in the circle just vlogging.</p>
<p>We just gave him a camera and he figured it out.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;d have like for him just set hours each day</p>
<p>that a cameraman would come.</p>
<p>So if he had any content, he needed extra hands.</p>
<p>Instead of just having someone on standby 24 seven,</p>
<p>it made more sense to do set hours.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>And yeah, it was hard, but you know,</p>
<p>explaining it in hindsight, it sounds so simple, you know?</p>
<p>And I guess like the more,</p>
<p>cause that one is relatively simple, I guess,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a low number of people.</p>
<p>Yeah, the hard part about that is just the time.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I checked in on them so many different days</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like an hour here, two hours there,</p>
<p>three hours there, over a hundred days</p>
<p>adds up to be a ton of time.</p>
<p>And even then, like, you know,</p>
<p>if you have a 10 person crew, you know,</p>
<p>paying them daily rates for a hundred days,</p>
<p>it just, all of it adds up.</p>
<p>What about like the a hundred versus a hundred,</p>
<p>a hundred adults versus a hundred kids?</p>
<p>What was bringing that to life?</p>
<p>That seems like exceptionally challenging.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically the thought process was</p>
<p>we did a hundred boys versus a hundred girls.</p>
<p>People loved it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d like it</p>
<p>as much as they did.</p>
<p>Video did really, really well.</p>
<p>So the second I saw that video was crushing,</p>
<p>I was like, all right, we&rsquo;re doing it again.</p>
<p>But last time we did it, we did in our studio.</p>
<p>So we built a giant room, put a hundred girls in it.</p>
<p>It sounds bad when I explain it like this.</p>
<p>And then a giant room put a hundred boys</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like, after a hundred hours,</p>
<p>whichever room has the most people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll give them half a million dollars.</p>
<p>So it did well.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like, all right, we&rsquo;re going to do it again.</p>
<p>So we threw out all these different ideas.</p>
<p>It was like a hundred football players</p>
<p>versus a hundred cheerleaders, a hundred this, a hundred that,</p>
<p>a hundred prisoners versus a hundred cops.</p>
<p>Just craziest ideas.</p>
<p>And we settled on a hundred kids versus a hundred adults.</p>
<p>And then the next step was like, how do we make it better?</p>
<p>The kids versus adults, sorry, the boys versus girls,</p>
<p>the first one we did was inside.</p>
<p>The problem was every time it was night</p>
<p>when we did these long time lapses,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t see the sun go up and down.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re like, okay, this time I want to do it outside.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the cubes are outside.</p>
<p>And instead of doing circles, we wanted to make them cubes.</p>
<p>And then, you know, figure out, do we want the, yeah.</p>
<p>Those videos came up at least today</p>
<p>as ones that are like really complicated</p>
<p>in terms of the audio, in terms of how to film it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>We had a lot of audio issues</p>
<p>because in the first one, we didn&rsquo;t have a roof on it.</p>
<p>The second one, there was a roof.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of reverb,</p>
<p>which then in editing made it brutal.</p>
<p>Like half the shots weren&rsquo;t usable</p>
<p>and it really screwed us over.</p>
<p>So we had to do a lot of Frankensteining in the editing</p>
<p>to make up for basically my ignorance.</p>
<p>So you mentioned that you were surprised</p>
<p>how well that one did.</p>
<p>A lot of creators talk about getting depressed</p>
<p>when the videos don&rsquo;t do as well as they kind of expected.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of feeling</p>
<p>you can get really worn out by that.</p>
<p>Do you yourself feel that?</p>
<p>And also, do you have advice for others that feel this?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird because I am a numbers guy,</p>
<p>but also it used to.</p>
<p>It used to very much,</p>
<p>especially when I was like betting</p>
<p>everything I had on a video.</p>
<p>When it did bad, I was devastated, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d cry and I&rsquo;d be depressed for days</p>
<p>and it really would have a severe impact on my mood.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, now it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>If a video does bad, I just look at it and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh, why did this video do bad?</p>
<p>Probably, oh, there&rsquo;s a little retention dip there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people like the thumbnail.</p>
<p>Maybe we should switch it.</p>
<p>And I just look at it objectively, unemotional,</p>
<p>and then just move on.</p>
<p>And I feel like that&rsquo;s a much healthier way</p>
<p>of going about it.</p>
<p>So if a creator is listening,</p>
<p>that is the ideal way to respond to a video</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing bad.</p>
<p>Just remove emotion from the equation</p>
<p>and just look at it and figure out</p>
<p>how you can improve the next one.</p>
<p>Is there tricks to being able to detach yourself</p>
<p>from that because in your case,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s true for creators,</p>
<p>but in your case, there&rsquo;s a lot of money on the line.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s videos costing a lot of money.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, a month of my life and so much time,</p>
<p>but no, I mean, you just, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The only real answer is it&rsquo;s just a conscious effort.</p>
<p>You just have to unemotionally look at the video,</p>
<p>determine the problems, and then move on.</p>
<p>There is no secret, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>And if you really can&rsquo;t bring yourself to do it,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re just screwed.</p>
<p>Honestly, maybe you&rsquo;re not meant for this game.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s part of the development as a creator</p>
<p>is like you&rsquo;re being able to detach yourself from it.</p>
<p>For longevity, yes, yeah.</p>
<p>You have to unemotionally be able to look at videos</p>
<p>that flop and figure it out.</p>
<p>Because if not, just getting,</p>
<p>and not every video can be a one out of 10,</p>
<p>and so when a video does bad,</p>
<p>you know, that just stress and depression,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just gonna eventually get to you in the long run.</p>
<p>So you said you&rsquo;ve failed in a bunch of videos,</p>
<p>sort of taking them to completion.</p>
<p>So what are some of the biggest fails?</p>
<p>Yeah, weirdly enough, as we&rsquo;ve matured</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve done this more,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have that problem as much,</p>
<p>especially now that we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>some multimillion dollar budgets per video.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, failure is not really an option anymore.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a little more particular about what I do.</p>
<p>But back in the day, yeah, like we would do a video</p>
<p>where we spent 24 hours on a deserted island,</p>
<p>and we filmed it, did it all,</p>
<p>and I just, I didn&rsquo;t like it after the edit.</p>
<p>So I just grabbed the voice</p>
<p>and we went back to the deserted island</p>
<p>and spent another 24 hours there and refilmed it.</p>
<p>Or&hellip;</p>
<p>Could that have been caught</p>
<p>and prevented at the idea stage?</p>
<p>Like where&hellip;</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>It was just poor execution.</p>
<p>To be honest, when we were out there, it was hot.</p>
<p>We were just like, we all at one point</p>
<p>just kind of wanted to die.</p>
<p>It was just miserable.</p>
<p>So how do you avoid that these days?</p>
<p>Well, I just went when it was a little cooler,</p>
<p>to be honest.</p>
<p>And then we had, literally,</p>
<p>the amount of fun we had in the video</p>
<p>was like 10 times higher.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So you, like, there&rsquo;s some practical details</p>
<p>that you just learned.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>Videos where it&rsquo;s very hot or it&rsquo;s on water,</p>
<p>because I get super seasick.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a, kind of like 10 things</p>
<p>that if they have these variables,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m down to do it.</p>
<p>But my fun meter is not as high as normal.</p>
<p>Like we tried to&hellip;</p>
<p>Anytime we do anything on a boat,</p>
<p>like when we spent 24 hours in Bermuda Triangle,</p>
<p>or when I tried to spend like,</p>
<p>which it didn&rsquo;t get uploaded,</p>
<p>but I tried to spend like 100 hours at sea or whatever,</p>
<p>just like on a raft.</p>
<p>It just like, it makes me want to throw up</p>
<p>and I get so seasick.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even see straight.</p>
<p>But there are just some videos</p>
<p>that require me to be on a boat.</p>
<p>So I just suck it up.</p>
<p>So when you spend months in creating a video,</p>
<p>I know this is probably stressful to some creators,</p>
<p>like how much stress,</p>
<p>how do you feel when you have to click publish a video?</p>
<p>Now, not much.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re able to detach yourself?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Again, in old me, tons.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d be like scratching and nervous</p>
<p>and like my hands would be sweating</p>
<p>like to the point where I&rsquo;m almost about to puke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I really hope people like this.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s just part of maturing it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different, as a content creator,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s different phases.</p>
<p>You just like, once you get over the fear</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just gonna wake up one day and be irrelevant,</p>
<p>you know, and you just, you know,</p>
<p>accept that like you believe in yourself</p>
<p>and you believe in your content</p>
<p>and that you can continue to be relevant,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>you kinda, it&rsquo;s a little bit easier to detach yourself,</p>
<p>I guess, and that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a much healthier place to be.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do this for 10 years</p>
<p>if every little thing just causes</p>
<p>these huge emotional reactions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s why a lot of creators</p>
<p>go a little, you know, mentally insane.</p>
<p>You know, you have to get out of that game</p>
<p>because it really messes with you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this a little bit,</p>
<p>but how do you define and how do you suggest</p>
<p>others define success on YouTube?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so subjective.</p>
<p>Some people, success is retiring their mom.</p>
<p>You know, for you, success is inspiring people</p>
<p>and educating them and, you know,</p>
<p>whatever, piquing their curiosity.</p>
<p>You know, for other people, it&rsquo;s just quitting their job.</p>
<p>So you have to self-reflect</p>
<p>on what your definition of success is</p>
<p>because I think a lot of creators</p>
<p>kinda don&rsquo;t really think, don&rsquo;t introspect.</p>
<p>Like, they kinda wanna keep getting</p>
<p>more and more subscribers kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but subscribers is just a vanity metric, you know?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, subscribers don&rsquo;t correlate to views.</p>
<p>Sure, or views, what?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, but that&rsquo;s more,</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t directed to you,</p>
<p>that was more directed to people listening</p>
<p>because a lot of people do really care about subscribers</p>
<p>or even followers, like on TikTok.</p>
<p>But if you look, like, your view,</p>
<p>on YouTube, very, very few percent,</p>
<p>if even a percent of your views come from the sub feed,</p>
<p>right, they&rsquo;re almost all home feed or suggested.</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s the last time you clicked</p>
<p>on your sub feed to watch a video?</p>
<p>Oh, almost never, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe five years ago.</p>
<p>It used to be a thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not anymore, no one does.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to find.</p>
<p>I subscribe to way too many channels, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what everyone does.</p>
<p>And you subscribe to 10 channels, they&rsquo;re great,</p>
<p>but two years later, your taste evolves</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a mess.</p>
<p>And so, subscribers don&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>Followers on TikTok don&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>So anyways, they really are the definition</p>
<p>of a vanity metric.</p>
<p>And, but what about views?</p>
<p>They do, obviously,</p>
<p>because if people are showing up time and time again,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what matters.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s a good thing to define a success.</p>
<p>I just feel like that too can be a problem</p>
<p>because I would say, you know,</p>
<p>if I wanted to be successful, like as a young creator,</p>
<p>I might start copying Mr. Beast</p>
<p>or something like that, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s, you start trying to take shortcuts</p>
<p>as opposed to find your own unique voice, right?</p>
<p>So like chasing views is a problem too, it feels like,</p>
<p>or no, as long as you detach yourself from them.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re, it sounds bad, but if you&rsquo;re lazy, yeah,</p>
<p>and you just want to copy someone else</p>
<p>and not experiment and find your own way,</p>
<p>but I mean, you can&rsquo;t make that excuse for them.</p>
<p>If someone just isn&rsquo;t coming up with the original stuff</p>
<p>and putting in the effort, you can&rsquo;t just say,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re chasing views.</p>
<p>We need some different metric for them to chase.</p>
<p>No, they just need to find their own way.</p>
<p>It just feels like unique type of content</p>
<p>will often lead to sacrifice in the number of views</p>
<p>in the short term.</p>
<p>By the long term, you win.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Or if you do win, you win more,</p>
<p>I guess would be a better way of putting it.</p>
<p>Do you think you will IPO MrBeastBurger or Feastables</p>
<p>in the next five, 10 years?</p>
<p>BeastBurger or Feastables, no.</p>
<p>I kind of think they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>so actually, you know what, I just realized,</p>
<p>this is our first time talking about those.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like an hour and a half in, that&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>We started talking about what?</p>
<p>My retention brain kicked in.</p>
<p>I wonder if you have retention brain for like life itself.</p>
<p>Oh, I do.</p>
<p>Every time I&rsquo;m talking to someone, I can, I&rsquo;m like, okay.</p>
<p>What about like loved ones?</p>
<p>Like spending time with loved ones,</p>
<p>thinking like we could be doing something</p>
<p>much better right now.</p>
<p>Yes, no, that is a serious problem with,</p>
<p>well, so we&rsquo;ll pause the BeastBurger question, yes.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why my current girlfriend,</p>
<p>which I was telling you before</p>
<p>when we were talking about this,</p>
<p>is she has a genuine love for learning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I have.</p>
<p>Like I always feel like I need to be learning something</p>
<p>to justify the time I&rsquo;m spending.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s such a nice trait</p>
<p>because I feel like that time is being used optimally</p>
<p>because whether we&rsquo;re watching a documentary</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re going and taking an IQ test</p>
<p>or reading about whatever, just why modern art is a thing,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, whatever weird thing we decide to do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always learning and improving,</p>
<p>so it justifies the time.</p>
<p>So to maximize retention in your relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You want to spend that time learning as much as possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, which conveniently I don&rsquo;t have to force, right?</p>
<p>Or I want to be recharging.</p>
<p>So when I do work, I can hit the ground harder.</p>
<p>And luckily we&rsquo;re into a lot of the same things,</p>
<p>which happen to be learning,</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s not learning,</p>
<p>like maybe watching an anime or something like that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a big believer in you&rsquo;re either,</p>
<p>if you, well, if your goal is to be</p>
<p>like a super successful entrepreneur,</p>
<p>you need to either be working</p>
<p>or you need to be doing something</p>
<p>that decompresses and recharges you</p>
<p>so you can work again,</p>
<p>if your goal is to be like a really kick-ass entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Obviously we&rsquo;re boiling this down to a very basic thing.</p>
<p>And so the things you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re down time when you&rsquo;re not working,</p>
<p>if it doesn&rsquo;t recharge you, you&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just a ticking time bomb waiting to implode.</p>
<p>And so you got to like heavily recharge.</p>
<p>And like, so like watching for me,</p>
<p>anime or whatever it is playing a board game,</p>
<p>like that is actually kind of crucial to my success,</p>
<p>which takes a lot of maturing to come to that conclusion</p>
<p>because I used to be the kind of guy</p>
<p>that wanted to work every hour of the day.</p>
<p>And I would try to train myself to not need that stuff.</p>
<p>And I, you know, and I almost resented like that.</p>
<p>I have to do these kinds of things</p>
<p>and it would piss me off because it&rsquo;s not optimal.</p>
<p>And, you know, I just really want to make content</p>
<p>and entertain people.</p>
<p>But as someone who&rsquo;s gone down that road</p>
<p>and, you know, you just work every day</p>
<p>for two, three months straight and, you know,</p>
<p>every hour of the day,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re just a bomb waiting to explode</p>
<p>and lose your mind.</p>
<p>And the only real sustainable thing is to just like,</p>
<p>give yourself time to recharge in between working.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of balance you have to find.</p>
<p>You have to, even, and I hate it more than anyone else.</p>
<p>Cause I, you know.</p>
<p>You hate not working.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s cause it&rsquo;s just not optimal for time.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, as a human,</p>
<p>I do need to occasionally watch a mindless show</p>
<p>and play a board game.</p>
<p>And it took me a very long time</p>
<p>to like come to peace with that and not,</p>
<p>I would have like borderline panic attacks when I do it.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m like, I just, what am I doing right now?</p>
<p>Why am I doing this?</p>
<p>I should be, you know, like,</p>
<p>what if one day I have to lay off an employee</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not doing so well?</p>
<p>Like, how could I justify watching this show</p>
<p>or whatever I&rsquo;m doing right now?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things like that that go on in your head,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>Before we return to Mr. Beast Burger.</p>
<p>Well, what is like, since we&rsquo;re on the topic,</p>
<p>what is a perfect day in the life,</p>
<p>perfectly productive day in the life</p>
<p>of Mr. Beast look like?</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Or like a standard.</p>
<p>I mean, the perfectly productive day</p>
<p>is we film a main channel video.</p>
<p>Cause those get a hundred million a pop.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t really get any better than that.</p>
<p>What about like the average day when you&rsquo;re not on the set?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re running a lot of things, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. So right now we have our snack brand Feastables.</p>
<p>We have a restaurant chain Beast Burger.</p>
<p>And then we basically,</p>
<p>which we haven&rsquo;t even really launched any products yet,</p>
<p>but we have the data company that I was showing you</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re going to roll out some tools for creators.</p>
<p>And then we have the react channel,</p>
<p>the gaming channel, the main channel.</p>
<p>And then we have my charity, which also has a channel.</p>
<p>And so kind of how I&rsquo;ve structured my life right now</p>
<p>is whatever I have free time,</p>
<p>we just kind of go,</p>
<p>Hey guys, Jimmy&rsquo;s got an hour from 2 PM to 3 PM.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s just like, I need this.</p>
<p>I need this.</p>
<p>And this channel&rsquo;s like, I need this thing filmed.</p>
<p>Or, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>The guy who runs my TikTok&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I need this TikTok filmed.</p>
<p>Or, you know, Beast Burger&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I need this menu item approved.</p>
<p>And we need to talk about this marketing thing.</p>
<p>And then we kind of just look at what everyone needs.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>that one looks like the most important.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>And then, so it&rsquo;s just kind of like, you know,</p>
<p>if I just did that for every company in a day,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s optimal.</p>
<p>If I just kind of,</p>
<p>like an optimal day for me would be going down</p>
<p>to eight companies and just whatever they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>two to three biggest pain points</p>
<p>or things they need from me.</p>
<p>And just doing those.</p>
<p>Based on priority and then trying to keep it</p>
<p>as short as possible to just the things that you need it on.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get more optimal than that.</p>
<p>If I clear the bottlenecks</p>
<p>or some bottlenecks for all my companies,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s, yeah, that&rsquo;s a perfect day.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, even just me,</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re showing me around</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re being a great and gracious host.</p>
<p>But on top of that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just doing all these meetings.</p>
<p>You basically.</p>
<p>I felt bad at some points.</p>
<p>I was like, oh,</p>
<p>I just tricked him into going to meetings with me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like my little meeting buddy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it was fun.</p>
<p>It was fun to see how effectively you&rsquo;ve delegated.</p>
<p>You basically trust the team to do a really good job</p>
<p>on the various things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just a strong team that&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to carry the five on all the different tasks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>From the brainstorming in the main channel</p>
<p>to the reacts and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really interesting what it takes</p>
<p>to build a team like that.</p>
<p>Cause you very quickly build a very large team</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to scale.</p>
<p>Which is very scary.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s my first, you know, I&rsquo;m 24.</p>
<p>You know, and I think I was telling you this earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny cause six years ago,</p>
<p>I had to raise my hand to go use the bathroom.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m in charge of hundreds of people</p>
<p>and entertain hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>And so it is crazy just how quick it comes up.</p>
<p>And I wish I was a little bit older</p>
<p>so I could have ran a couple of companies</p>
<p>and failed a few companies in the past</p>
<p>and like learn from those and apply those here.</p>
<p>Cause I know for a fact, when I&rsquo;m 34, I&rsquo;m 24 now,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m 34, I&rsquo;ll know so much more about running a business</p>
<p>and scaling and hiring and how to lead people</p>
<p>and better effectively communicate</p>
<p>and all these different skill sets</p>
<p>that will make me a better leader.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing that sucks</p>
<p>is I just don&rsquo;t have those</p>
<p>cause I just haven&rsquo;t been through the lessons</p>
<p>and I just have such a lucrative thing</p>
<p>on my plate right now.</p>
<p>And it just sucks that I have to learn the lessons</p>
<p>with the lucrative thing.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, cause you already have so much influence,</p>
<p>so much impact, but you have effectively scaled.</p>
<p>What lessons do you draw from that?</p>
<p>How to effectively scale as a 24 year old?</p>
<p>Like you-</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s something I feel like</p>
<p>I actually could give a lot of value to</p>
<p>to young people who are doing it.</p>
<p>Like older people who&rsquo;ve built five companies</p>
<p>or whatever they do.</p>
<p>I probably couldn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be like, oh, this is so obvious.</p>
<p>But for younger first-time business owners,</p>
<p>you gotta just experiment, to be honest.</p>
<p>And so for us, like it&rsquo;s just a new space.</p>
<p>No one had really ever scaled up 100 person team</p>
<p>to build, make content on YouTube.</p>
<p>So there wasn&rsquo;t no, I spent all this time,</p>
<p>like I hired one person from Disney at one point</p>
<p>to come in and help.</p>
<p>And obviously that was a dumb idea looking back on it.</p>
<p>But, you know, I thought,</p>
<p>oh, they make great stuff people wanna watch.</p>
<p>And they come over here and help me build a team.</p>
<p>And, you know, they build it more the traditional way</p>
<p>and not like how it should be online.</p>
<p>And so then it&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m not trying to trash people.</p>
<p>Like they all tried their best,</p>
<p>but then I hired this one person</p>
<p>who does this different type of media</p>
<p>and runs a 100 person team.</p>
<p>And then you come in here and they try to build it that way.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really listen to you or value</p>
<p>or see the difference.</p>
<p>And I tried basically for building this company</p>
<p>with like four or five different people</p>
<p>who worked in different veins of media.</p>
<p>And, you know, every single time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like, they just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t understand my world.</p>
<p>And the eventual solution was just like</p>
<p>to roll up my sleeves and do it myself,</p>
<p>you know, with like James or him, man,</p>
<p>and just like, no one&rsquo;s ever done this.</p>
<p>And like, no one&rsquo;s gonna just give us a golden carrot</p>
<p>and tell us how to build this company.</p>
<p>We gotta figure it the fuck out ourselves.</p>
<p>And you have to kind of build up people from scratch then.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>All the stuff I was talking about earlier</p>
<p>and all the lessons I learned along the way.</p>
<p>And so for me, that was a big part of like,</p>
<p>stop trying to have someone build this company for me</p>
<p>and just do it myself.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>Like I spent my whole life studying YouTube videos</p>
<p>and virality, not business building.</p>
<p>But fuck it.</p>
<p>I was like, I guess we just gotta do it ourselves then.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where things really start to click.</p>
<p>And we got the exponential growth.</p>
<p>We started getting the right people</p>
<p>and training them the right way.</p>
<p>And, you know, just throwing conventional stuff</p>
<p>out the door and focusing on what&rsquo;s actually practical</p>
<p>for YouTube, which is just completely different</p>
<p>than traditional media.</p>
<p>So you train people and then those people train people</p>
<p>and then so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s just even like, you know,</p>
<p>how you do the lighting on sets</p>
<p>or like how you do the audio or, you know,</p>
<p>not writing scripts.</p>
<p>So, you know, we&rsquo;re just not as efficient with our filming.</p>
<p>Like sometimes I have to have 30 cameras running.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not scripted.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what Chris is gonna do when we start filming.</p>
<p>He might run over there.</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>I have a plan because there&rsquo;s only one shot.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, you know, tell him not to do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the shooting.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s also the editing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then the editing as well</p>
<p>and not having guardrails and kind of, you know,</p>
<p>at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s whatever I want.</p>
<p>The video, their job is to make a video</p>
<p>that they think I&rsquo;ll like because it&rsquo;s my channel.</p>
<p>But, you know, you can achieve that kind of however.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just, everything&rsquo;s just different.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s much more, I guess,</p>
<p>like a startup as opposed to&hellip;</p>
<p>Are you often surprised like with the result?</p>
<p>Like you think a certain,</p>
<p>like we watched a video today that was really nice.</p>
<p>That was different than you would have potentially edited.</p>
<p>Are you sometimes surprised by like a decision</p>
<p>that it makes?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, that&rsquo;s not the way I would have done it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually, this is a cool idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah, the thing, my biggest fear is I don&rsquo;t ever want</p>
<p>to get trapped in like a bubble of, you know,</p>
<p>because we are getting 100 million views a video</p>
<p>on the main channel.</p>
<p>Like, but I don&rsquo;t want to get in this feedback loop</p>
<p>of just my ideas are great or, not feedback loop,</p>
<p>but stop learning and improving.</p>
<p>Because it is easy sometimes to be like,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re doing is working.</p>
<p>We need to just keep doing it.</p>
<p>I want to keep learning and trying new things.</p>
<p>And I guess one way I&rsquo;d put it is like,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t, when you&rsquo;re on a come up or you&rsquo;re growing,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to test new things once you start to plateau</p>
<p>or have a downtrend.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re like, you know, you&rsquo;re skyrocketing,</p>
<p>right, you&rsquo;re up, up, up.</p>
<p>And then you level off and you start to go down</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, oh, this isn&rsquo;t working anymore.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start experimenting.</p>
<p>Well, if you have a bad experiment,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re in like a tailspin, you&rsquo;re nosediving.</p>
<p>And you have one more bad experiment,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, screwed, kind of, I&rsquo;m oversimplifying.</p>
<p>You want to test things while you&rsquo;re still growing</p>
<p>to keep the growing from happening.</p>
<p>Because once you like have, you know, again,</p>
<p>very oversimplifying that like, you know,</p>
<p>kind of level off, you do a couple of tests that go wrong.</p>
<p>In my, you&rsquo;re like, screwed, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already out the door.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re just confirming that you&rsquo;re out the door</p>
<p>and online entertainment.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of how I see it.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s very imperative</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re constantly always experimenting</p>
<p>and trying things, even if you&rsquo;re getting crazy,</p>
<p>unheard of growth.</p>
<p>And so that, outside of the thing</p>
<p>that brought you to the dance,</p>
<p>you just dived right into Mr. Beast Burger and Feastables.</p>
<p>This is a whole nother industry.</p>
<p>Like, what was that like?</p>
<p>Well, so Beast Burger, we kind of,</p>
<p>it was supposed to be like just a pop-up.</p>
<p>Like, we just partnered with someone</p>
<p>who had 300 restaurants and we&rsquo;re just like, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just sell Beast Burgers for a day or two.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really think it would be as big as it was,</p>
<p>but those first, like that first day, you know,</p>
<p>we do six figures in sales and they all sell out</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re running to local Walmarts.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t keep up with the demand.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, okay, well,</p>
<p>maybe let&rsquo;s just leave it open a week, whatever.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just doing crazy revenue.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, okay, well, let&rsquo;s add some more restaurants</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just leave them open for a month.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just still doing six figures a day.</p>
<p>And it kind of just went from this thing</p>
<p>that was, I don&rsquo;t know, it wasn&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really plan on running a restaurant chain,</p>
<p>but here I am.</p>
<p>But didn&rsquo;t that, in some sense,</p>
<p>also open your mind to something like Feastables?</p>
<p>Feastables is something I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do.</p>
<p>Because I think just in general,</p>
<p>American snacks are just full of so much</p>
<p>horrible ingredients, to be honest.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I feel like there also just hasn&rsquo;t been any innovation</p>
<p>in American snacks in quite a while.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been pretty passionate about.</p>
<p>We built that from scratch.</p>
<p>So we hired the CEO and built a team around them.</p>
<p>And we spent probably over two and a half years</p>
<p>before we even launched,</p>
<p>just like building the right team,</p>
<p>figuring things out and making sure</p>
<p>it was actually ran the way I wanted,</p>
<p>which Feastables has just been crushing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve never talked about publicly,</p>
<p>but having products in retail,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like before Feastables,</p>
<p>everything I had done was online.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to, you know,</p>
<p>anything from the quote, quote, peace brand,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to buy it online and ship it to you.</p>
<p>But Feastables, now that, you know,</p>
<p>because our first product, Chocolate Bars,</p>
<p>we started putting that in retail locations.</p>
<p>So like, for example, Walmart, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense how,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re, which I guess it does for,</p>
<p>because we get 100 million views a video.</p>
<p>So a lot of people know us.</p>
<p>If I go stand on Walmart,</p>
<p>those people recognize me and ask for photos.</p>
<p>Like if I stood there long enough,</p>
<p>I could take 150 photos today in Walmart or 200,</p>
<p>whatever it is.</p>
<p>So obviously it makes sense those people go buy Feastables.</p>
<p>But then you just multiply that by every Walmart in America.</p>
<p>And it just gets so crazy.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d be doing the kind of revenue we are.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re about to launch in some other,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m allowed to say it, so whatever,</p>
<p>but other big retail, you know,</p>
<p>locations and convenience stores.</p>
<p>And like by the end of next year,</p>
<p>we could be in like 40, 50,000 locations.</p>
<p>And the numbers just don&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>What are some interesting challenges about scaling there</p>
<p>that surprised you?</p>
<p>The biggest problem, which I didn&rsquo;t think would be,</p>
<p>was just keeping the shelves in Walmart stock,</p>
<p>to be honest.</p>
<p>So that supply chain.</p>
<p>It was brutal.</p>
<p>Well, even then sometimes like, you know,</p>
<p>you get them the stuff and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>it takes them like a day or two to put it out</p>
<p>in that specific location.</p>
<p>And I had to stop promoting it</p>
<p>because every time I&rsquo;d mention it,</p>
<p>like 40% of people would just be like, it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in Walmart or I can&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
<p>And so there was like a three-ish month period</p>
<p>where I just didn&rsquo;t promote Feastables</p>
<p>because I was scared that someone would go buy it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just not there.</p>
<p>And so like, it took us a very long time</p>
<p>to catch up to the demand.</p>
<p>And also, it&rsquo;s not like we have unlimited money.</p>
<p>So, but now we&rsquo;re relatively caught up and keeping up,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s going to be interesting</p>
<p>because now this year in 2023,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to basically, you know,</p>
<p>10X the amount of locations we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re, and we&rsquo;re going to try to launch new products.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in for an interesting ride, but yeah,</p>
<p>I just hate, I hate when I tell people, you know,</p>
<p>like, hey, go try this product.</p>
<p>And then they go in their local Walmart</p>
<p>and eventually other places and it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so brutal, you know,</p>
<p>that they made that whole journey out there</p>
<p>and they couldn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>And so that was really it.</p>
<p>Besides that, no, it&rsquo;s been doing way better</p>
<p>than I ever thought.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked to a couple of places</p>
<p>about maybe doing mobile games</p>
<p>or computer games in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that something you&rsquo;re still considering?</p>
<p>Yes, because, you know,</p>
<p>do you normally talk with people</p>
<p>as much as we talked beforehand?</p>
<p>Is that?</p>
<p>No, no, that was the problem.</p>
<p>We spent all day today talking about stuff.</p>
<p>I just looked in my head,</p>
<p>everything you asked me is stuff we already talked about.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, no, not everything.</p>
<p>I take it back, but sorry.</p>
<p>The last two questions, yes.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just funny because.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, I tried, so good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different style of asking those questions</p>
<p>because I on purpose didn&rsquo;t dig further with you.</p>
<p>I could tell, yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, okay, all right.</p>
<p>Well, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve ever talked to somebody</p>
<p>as much as I did with you beforehand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On the same day.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Not even the same day.</p>
<p>We spent all day together.</p>
<p>And I only slept one hour.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Literally, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>This is a hilarious and awesome social experiment.</p>
<p>I picked him up from his hotel</p>
<p>and I just like harassed him all day to hang out with me.</p>
<p>And then here we are now.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I was secretly recording the whole time,</p>
<p>just so you know, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Anyway, so what was the question?</p>
<p>The mobile game.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the interesting thing is</p>
<p>with Beast Burger and Feastables</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s physical goods as opposed to like</p>
<p>making mobile games or PC game,</p>
<p>whichever one we end up doing, which is software.</p>
<p>And I actually have a giant international audience.</p>
<p>Like most of my audience is obviously outside of America.</p>
<p>And so the problem we&rsquo;re running into</p>
<p>is it just takes time to build up the supply chain</p>
<p>and get Feastables in Southeast Asia,</p>
<p>get Feastables in India,</p>
<p>get Feastables in Brazil and Mexico</p>
<p>and all these other places</p>
<p>where we have giant pockets of our audience.</p>
<p>And same thing with Beast Burger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s gonna take probably years</p>
<p>unless we partner with someone</p>
<p>who already has the distribution,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re figuring out.</p>
<p>But the beauty of software</p>
<p>is I can make a hypothetical game</p>
<p>or whatever we end up doing.</p>
<p>And all my fans can use it tomorrow,</p>
<p>the day I mention it.</p>
<p>And so if I promote something in a video</p>
<p>to 100 million people and it&rsquo;s basically like a game,</p>
<p>they can all download it.</p>
<p>But if I promote a Feastables bar,</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s only in America</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re struggling just to keep up</p>
<p>with the American demand.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t even gotten the chance to go outside of America.</p>
<p>So I alienate a majority of my audience</p>
<p>and it feels sort of shitty</p>
<p>to just mention something that most of them can&rsquo;t buy.</p>
<p>But on the flip side,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just spawn this crazy infrastructure</p>
<p>and just have tens of millions of bars</p>
<p>and all your products in every single store</p>
<p>across the world before you promote it.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t put the egg before the chicken.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m excited about.</p>
<p>I want to get into less physical stuff</p>
<p>and more stuff that everyone in my audience</p>
<p>can actually use.</p>
<p>This is the thought process.</p>
<p>Especially if there&rsquo;s a social element to the gaming too,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not unlike Feastables,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a product you consume.</p>
<p>You missed it.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re setting up for this,</p>
<p>we were doing some,</p>
<p>basically just laying out everything</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re planning for.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re at the phase</p>
<p>where we want to start hiring the team to build it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re kind of just laying out the game.</p>
<p>And I was actually really curious to get your thoughts,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t say it.</p>
<p>Because whatever I say,</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s just going to take it and run with it.</p>
<p>But I have a pretty good idea.</p>
<p>About the kind of games you&rsquo;re thinking about?</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I can imagine.</p>
<p>We also talked a little bit about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super awesome.</p>
<p>So much good ones.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>So much good talks.</p>
<p>I have the juicy talks to have on here.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I got to go set up.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I already heard a lot of awesome stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, but that is a different kind of team</p>
<p>you would need to hire.</p>
<p>Is that a little nerve wracking?</p>
<p>Like going into a new field and trying to&hellip;</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>But then I remind myself like,</p>
<p>like Steve Jobs didn&rsquo;t know how to code, right?</p>
<p>And you know, he just knew what a good product was.</p>
<p>And I feel like as someone who wasted so much</p>
<p>of his life playing video games,</p>
<p>I have a good sense of it.</p>
<p>And that might be ignorance.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s really important, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about coding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about what makes for a good game.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And again, that might genuinely be ignorance.</p>
<p>And maybe I end up, you know,</p>
<p>getting bit in the butt because of what I&rsquo;m saying now.</p>
<p>But I think just like with YouTube,</p>
<p>I just want to obsess over making a great product</p>
<p>and things that I think my audience will love.</p>
<p>And I think as long as I keep that as my north star,</p>
<p>it will do well.</p>
<p>What does the path to being worth 100 billion look like?</p>
<p>What does the path to being worth 100 billion look like?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay, let me just like pause.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re 24 and there&rsquo;s so much awesome scaling.</p>
<p>So many great ideas.</p>
<p>Do you think about different trajectories?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What those possible trajectories might look like?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, if the goal was</p>
<p>to just be worth $100 billion, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, my goal, I&rsquo;m a broken record,</p>
<p>is to make the best video possible</p>
<p>because I know whatever else I want will come, obviously.</p>
<p>So the video is the foundation.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So the path to $100 billion</p>
<p>is to keep getting 100 million views a video.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Or more.</p>
<p>Yeah, or more, exactly, if we can keep growing.</p>
<p>But, you know, if we can keep Feastables growing, right,</p>
<p>and we eventually expand international,</p>
<p>and one day we&rsquo;re in 100,000 retail locations</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re selling the same amount of SKUs per,</p>
<p>or units per SKUs like we&rsquo;re currently doing,</p>
<p>I mean, that would crush.</p>
<p>And then obviously, ideally,</p>
<p>one day we open up hundreds of Beast Burgers.</p>
<p>We get it where we turn out, you know,</p>
<p>like Supercell, a couple hit games.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make dozens or hundreds of games.</p>
<p>I just want to make games that are just great.</p>
<p>And, you know, we rarely drop them,</p>
<p>but when we do, they&rsquo;re bangers.</p>
<p>And just, you know, whatever other stuff we end up doing,</p>
<p>all that combined.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just interesting, because, like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a show that&rsquo;s pulled 100 million views per episode,</p>
<p>basically, like we&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Like, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, the Super Bowl gets praised</p>
<p>because they get 100 million viewers,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t think of a show, maybe in reruns or something.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a show that has a singular kind of figure</p>
<p>that you can now use as a-</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t have a network telling me what to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anyone.</p>
<p>Like, I can do whatever I want.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s a very interesting position,</p>
<p>because I put out content, and 100 million people show up.</p>
<p>And then I also have a gaming channel.</p>
<p>I put out content, and 15 million people show up.</p>
<p>And I have a React channel.</p>
<p>I put out content, and 10 million people show up.</p>
<p>I have a TikTok, and I put out content,</p>
<p>and on average, 20 million people show up.</p>
<p>And like, so, as long as I can keep that going,</p>
<p>and then we build these businesses,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s honestly pretty scary</p>
<p>to see what will happen, you know, over the years.</p>
<p>Because Feastables launched, you know, last year, 2022.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s a relatively new thing.</p>
<p>And BeastBurger, we just started scaling up</p>
<p>the physical side, and we haven&rsquo;t, obviously,</p>
<p>even launched any mobile games yet.</p>
<p>So, I think I&rsquo;m at the antithesis of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a world where my YouTube channel&rsquo;s irrelevant</p>
<p>in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>I just, this is what I live for.</p>
<p>And so, if I can keep that going,</p>
<p>and then really start to expand these businesses</p>
<p>that leverage off of it, then, yeah, I mean.</p>
<p>Hopefully, there&rsquo;s a day when,</p>
<p>where I can give away a billion dollars in a video, honestly.</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be one hell of a video.</p>
<p>Let me ask you the ridiculous question.</p>
<p>Since you went from being broke to being rich,</p>
<p>although you keep spending all your money,</p>
<p>does money buy happiness?</p>
<p>How has money changed, sort of, your contentment,</p>
<p>your happiness in life?</p>
<p>Does money buy happiness?</p>
<p>No, not, I mean, to a point, yes.</p>
<p>Once you can take care of your health,</p>
<p>you can take care of, like, any immediate dangers,</p>
<p>and you can take care of your family, relatively.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like, but those things do.</p>
<p>Like, when I first came into money,</p>
<p>one of the first things I did was retire my mom.</p>
<p>And, like, that brought me tons of happiness,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And, like, you know, if my brother had a medical emergency,</p>
<p>and we couldn&rsquo;t afford it, and I made money to afford it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d bring tons of happiness, you know?</p>
<p>So, once you take care of those basic necessities,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll say make over, hypothetically, a million dollars,</p>
<p>no, it really doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like, adding an extra zero,</p>
<p>going from 10 million to 100 million,</p>
<p>or whatever it is, makes no difference.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re, given that,</p>
<p>are just fearless in spending the money?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, let me reframe.</p>
<p>I guess it could, for some people,</p>
<p>if you really, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>you spent your whole life obsessing over cars,</p>
<p>it probably would bring you a little bit of joy</p>
<p>to buy a nice Lamborghini.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming more from the frame of mind of an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s really obsessed with business building.</p>
<p>For me, and a lot of my friends and people I hang around,</p>
<p>what brings us happiness is winning,</p>
<p>and building companies, and, you know, changing the world.</p>
<p>Like, that is fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complex problem you can wake up every day,</p>
<p>and it gives you something to obsess over</p>
<p>and devote your life to,</p>
<p>whereas just having money doesn&rsquo;t, you know?</p>
<p>Well, one interesting question I have for you,</p>
<p>psychologically, so, because you have become wealthy,</p>
<p>and because you give, like, part of your work</p>
<p>is giving away a lot of money,</p>
<p>do you find it hard to find people you can trust?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Do people see you basically as a source of money,</p>
<p>as opposed to another human being?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, because you would think yes,</p>
<p>but I feel like I also know the right places to look.</p>
<p>But yeah, if I just walked into Target</p>
<p>and tried to make friends with 10 random people, of course.</p>
<p>You gotta, uh.</p>
<p>So, you can kind of sense.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, you can sense.</p>
<p>Who has the right thing in their heart.</p>
<p>So quickly, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s so obvious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even want to go into descriptions,</p>
<p>but honestly, a lot of my friends, like Chandler,</p>
<p>I played Little League with him,</p>
<p>and Tyler, the guy, I mean, I went to school with him.</p>
<p>Chris, he was my first subscriber.</p>
<p>Carl was here after we got big,</p>
<p>but whatever, he&rsquo;s just friends with the boys,</p>
<p>and a lot of my closer friends,</p>
<p>even like my YouTube friends, I knew before I was big.</p>
<p>So, maybe there is some merit to that.</p>
<p>Maybe it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really put too much thought into it,</p>
<p>but maybe there&rsquo;s a reason I hang around</p>
<p>a lot of these people I knew before I got big,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s much easier.</p>
<p>And they help you keep your radar sharp</p>
<p>of who can and can&rsquo;t be trusted,</p>
<p>because you know you can trust them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s difficult when you become richer</p>
<p>and richer and more powerful.</p>
<p>Well, one thing you&rsquo;ll also find when you get rich,</p>
<p>not even richer, but more famous.</p>
<p>One thing I thought is, as I climbed this ladder</p>
<p>of YouTube and got bigger,</p>
<p>I thought there would be tons of people like me.</p>
<p>People that take the kamikaze approach</p>
<p>to building a business.</p>
<p>You just throw all your money in it.</p>
<p>You throw all your time.</p>
<p>You throw all your energy.</p>
<p>You throw everything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like, fuck it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this or I&rsquo;m dead.</p>
<p>I thought there would be hundreds of me.</p>
<p>And there isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s maybe one or two,</p>
<p>and I talk to those motherfuckers every single day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick and tired of talking to them, but I love them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just so interesting,</p>
<p>because every level I got up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d get a million subscribers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, all right, where&rsquo;s all these guys</p>
<p>with a million subscribers that are fucking psychopaths?</p>
<p>And then you don&rsquo;t, you know.</p>
<p>People become conservative as they get more.</p>
<p>Especially as they get bigger, yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, 20 million subscribers, 30.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like every step of the way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I just got more and more lonely to be honest.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s you, you know, it sounds cliche,</p>
<p>and you hear that kind of shit in movies,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, oh, that&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>But it is.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s just not many people</p>
<p>that just want to give up everything,</p>
<p>go all in, then obsess over making</p>
<p>the greatest goddamn videos every single day of their life.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re really hard to find.</p>
<p>And be able to sacrifice everything for that video.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like basically put all the money right back in.</p>
<p>Yeah, or the people doing it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on just a small scale.</p>
<p>And if I talk to them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just 99.9% of the time I&rsquo;m teaching them things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s lonely because there&rsquo;s not too many people,</p>
<p>especially in the creative space,</p>
<p>that are as crazy as you.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is, 100%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, it&rsquo;s not what I was expecting.</p>
<p>I was expecting there&rsquo;d be a lot of people like me.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Well, I guess the guy would talk to Elon Musk</p>
<p>is a bit like you in that sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, just that.</p>
<p>In a different domain.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Just willingness to put it all back in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve found right now,</p>
<p>a lot of the people I relate to</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even make YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m veering more and more away</p>
<p>from fellow content creators and more to just,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just looking for those other people</p>
<p>who just share a little bit of it</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t feel so fucking crazy all the time.</p>
<p>Like, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like people I feel normal around.</p>
<p>And they tend to just be doing the randomest things,</p>
<p>but loving it.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s really inspiring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Bukowski line,</p>
<p>find what you love and let it kill you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really put everything,</p>
<p>put everything into the thing you love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the way to really create special stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the way to live out your life most fully.</p>
<p>I have to be careful giving this advice</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like bodybuilders.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be like, just go to the gym, be disciplined.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disciplined, go to the gym.</p>
<p>But I would argue for those people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not even discipline.</p>
<p>They just enjoy weightlifting, right?</p>
<p>Because there are people who are jacked,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t make much money or run a business, right?</p>
<p>If they were that disciplined,</p>
<p>they would be hitting every area of their life.</p>
<p>They just really like business.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s people like me</p>
<p>who just to an extreme level, love building companies, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even discipline for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just in my blood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I wake up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t push myself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to watch a fucking motivational video</p>
<p>to go work.</p>
<p>I just do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s programmed in me at this point.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t imagine a world</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t wake up and do it every day.</p>
<p>But I think that a little bit of it is genetics</p>
<p>and just how you&rsquo;re hardwired.</p>
<p>Not that it can&rsquo;t be trained or taught.</p>
<p>And obviously the friend group you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>influences these things.</p>
<p>And over time, I think can change it.</p>
<p>But someone&rsquo;s just not gonna be able to flip a switch</p>
<p>and then just start doing a kamikaze approach</p>
<p>to building a business.</p>
<p>Just like a lot of people try to flip a switch</p>
<p>and start bodybuilding and then quit majority of the time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not innate to them.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of us have the capacity</p>
<p>to do that in some domain.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think if you went about it strategically,</p>
<p>if you surrounded yourself with fellow like-minded people</p>
<p>and slowly over time switched it.</p>
<p>But if you just try to like hardcore do it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna lose your mind.</p>
<p>Do you ever worry about your mental health?</p>
<p>Did you take a step to protect it?</p>
<p>To, yeah, to like for the long run,</p>
<p>to make sure you have the mental strength to go on?</p>
<p>Yes, weirdly enough, the best thing for my mental health</p>
<p>was giving into my innate nature to work.</p>
<p>The most depressed I get is when I try to restrict it.</p>
<p>And like, I don&rsquo;t work weekends or I don&rsquo;t work this day.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s best for me is just to work when I feel like working</p>
<p>and then just not work when I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And just have no constraints.</p>
<p>Because there are just some nights</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t want to sleep.</p>
<p>And for whatever reason, I feel compelled to go all night.</p>
<p>Whatever, like just do it.</p>
<p>Do whatever you want is what I tell my like working brain.</p>
<p>And I just give into it and I feel,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I feel the happiest.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s typically like,</p>
<p>but when I&rsquo;m really in the grind mode,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be like seven or eight days,</p>
<p>just nonstop going, going.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ll realize like,</p>
<p>oh, I need some recharge time.</p>
<p>And then go fucking binge a season of anime.</p>
<p>And listen to your body.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>like people will tell you, don&rsquo;t work weekends</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t do this or don&rsquo;t work past this</p>
<p>or blah, blah, give you all these constraints.</p>
<p>But for me, and it&rsquo;s unconventional, I just give into it.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something really to be said for that.</p>
<p>I try to surround myself with people that,</p>
<p>like when I don&rsquo;t, when I pull an all-nighter,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t go like, you should get more sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason I pulled that all-nighter.</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m really passionate about something,</p>
<p>they say, they basically encourage it.</p>
<p>I have no problem getting sleep and getting rest.</p>
<p>What I need in my life is people that encourage you</p>
<p>to kind of keep going,</p>
<p>keep going with the stuff you&rsquo;re passionate about.</p>
<p>Normal people, they don&rsquo;t want that life</p>
<p>and they probably shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not good for you.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you hang around people,</p>
<p>like just whatever, different people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna feel crazy and it&rsquo;s gonna wear on you.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re around similar people,</p>
<p>it just, it&rsquo;s so much easier.</p>
<p>Like if you, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started weightlifting more</p>
<p>and like one thing that&rsquo;s helped</p>
<p>is just having jacked people around.</p>
<p>They naturally just eat healthier.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>They naturally just have freaking grilled chicken</p>
<p>and all this shit and high-protein meals.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like easier for me to just piggyback</p>
<p>and be like, oh, can you just order me</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;re getting?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, oh, I gotta go to the gym.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be like, oh shit, I&rsquo;ll just join you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s cheat codes.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Just surround yourself with people that you wanna be.</p>
<p>And it makes it like 70% easier, in my opinion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that is the cheat code to life.</p>
<p>And I wish, obviously your audience</p>
<p>is definitely a lot older,</p>
<p>but to the older people listening,</p>
<p>like if you are in a place of mentorship</p>
<p>for someone younger or have influence over younger people,</p>
<p>you should really try to drill that in their heads.</p>
<p>Like the people they are around 100% dictates the outcome.</p>
<p>I would not be on 120 million subscribers</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t find, when I was around a million,</p>
<p>I had a couple of friends that were just also psychopaths.</p>
<p>You know, I outgrew them, but at the time it was great.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t be where I am today if it wasn&rsquo;t for them.</p>
<p>And just all along the way,</p>
<p>the friends that I hung out with</p>
<p>had such a dramatic impact on where I am.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d probably have 80 million less subscribers,</p>
<p>you know, if it was, if I wasn&rsquo;t so strategic</p>
<p>about hanging out with people that I add value to</p>
<p>and they also add value to me.</p>
<p>So the advice for young people would be to</p>
<p>be very selective about the people you surround yourself with.</p>
<p>So selective, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Like Chris, you know, he&rsquo;s really funny.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s great for the videos.</p>
<p>And part of why he&rsquo;s so funny</p>
<p>is he consumes copious amounts of cartoons</p>
<p>and just funny content.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll find, like when I spend more time with Chris,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start just quoting these weird cartoons and shows.</p>
<p>Like my speech will literally change</p>
<p>just after like a week of spending more time with him.</p>
<p>It has like, it&rsquo;s like that quick of an effect, you know.</p>
<p>Now picture that over the course of years.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, it has such a huge influence.</p>
<p>Like pluck one of their friends out</p>
<p>and hypothetically put me in there.</p>
<p>And you know, there&rsquo;s no doubt</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re trying to become a content creator,</p>
<p>their odds of success is 10X, right?</p>
<p>Obviously you can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>but you got to find your closest version of it.</p>
<p>And just be selective, yeah.</p>
<p>But this also applies not just to younger,</p>
<p>to older people too.</p>
<p>Agree, but it&rsquo;s even more,</p>
<p>I like when I was a teenager,</p>
<p>I just, you know, I couldn&rsquo;t relate to many people.</p>
<p>I just thought I was like a fucking freaking nature</p>
<p>because no one was obsessed with building businesses</p>
<p>or any of this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And so like back then, you know,</p>
<p>that advice would have been helpful.</p>
<p>Maybe not that particularly,</p>
<p>but just knowing that there are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re a freaking nature,</p>
<p>you just haven&rsquo;t found people that have the same interest.</p>
<p>So the task is not to feel sorry for yourself</p>
<p>or somehow change yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more to find people you fit in with.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, assuming which, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting compliments,</p>
<p>like assume it&rsquo;s not something bad, right?</p>
<p>If your hobby is shooting things,</p>
<p>or shooting things you shouldn&rsquo;t be shooting,</p>
<p>you know, don&rsquo;t find people that encourage that.</p>
<p>But outside of that, for sure.</p>
<p>Actually as an answer to what is the best advice</p>
<p>someone ever gave you, you said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re crazy until you&rsquo;re successful,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re a genius.</p>
<p>100%, all along the way.</p>
<p>People gave me so much, you know,</p>
<p>advice on why I shouldn&rsquo;t be doing it, why I&rsquo;m crazy.</p>
<p>Every step of the way people wanted to tell me</p>
<p>why I shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this and should get a life,</p>
<p>should stop being too obsessed.</p>
<p>Everything, everything under the book.</p>
<p>And then once I&rsquo;m successful,</p>
<p>those same people are like, dang, you&rsquo;re a genius.</p>
<p>Wow, you really, you pulled that off.</p>
<p>Those are probably the same people</p>
<p>that will give you advice now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the most successful video creator of all time,</p>
<p>stick to that.</p>
<p>Anytime you want to do something new, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll like pressure you not to do, you know,</p>
<p>Feastables or mobile gaming or whatever lays beyond.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, honestly, they&rsquo;re the type of people</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t talk to anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even know what they have to say now.</p>
<p>So most people on the team are like, yes and,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, whatever the idea you got, they&rsquo;re with it.</p>
<p>No, I mean, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>We actually have a, my team pushes back on me</p>
<p>pretty hardcore, which I want.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want yes men.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re, James, you know,</p>
<p>the CEO who helped me build all this, he&rsquo;s very adamant.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re not yes men.</p>
<p>And he trains people to really think for themselves.</p>
<p>And even when I give them orders,</p>
<p>like really think like, is this optimal?</p>
<p>Is there context or information Jimmy could be missing</p>
<p>that I can provide that can help him</p>
<p>make a more updated decision?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not God, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m human and I make errors.</p>
<p>And so don&rsquo;t take what I say as the Bible.</p>
<p>So even like in the brainstorming and so on,</p>
<p>they can push back.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can see it.</p>
<p>Like Tyler, anytime I said something,</p>
<p>he would give me feedback and push back,</p>
<p>which is what I want.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want him just to be like,</p>
<p>yes, you&rsquo;re a fucking genius.</p>
<p>Good job, Jimmy.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t need that.</p>
<p>You know, I need negatives.</p>
<p>You talked about being in a relationship.</p>
<p>What role, Jimmy, does love play in the human condition?</p>
<p>I think, well, the big thing is love can be scary</p>
<p>because this is, you know,</p>
<p>the human you&rsquo;re gonna spend the most amount of time with</p>
<p>in your life, you know?</p>
<p>And so for project that over 50 years,</p>
<p>they can be a liability or an asset.</p>
<p>I love the metrics.</p>
<p>You know, I love-</p>
<p>No, but seriously, it&rsquo;s gotta be</p>
<p>someone that makes you better.</p>
<p>For me, I can&rsquo;t truly love someone</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t make me better because-</p>
<p>Yeah, in the long run, across the years.</p>
<p>Because if not, then it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a negative, you know,</p>
<p>to everything I&rsquo;ve spent my life building.</p>
<p>But luckily, I&rsquo;m very happy with the partner I have.</p>
<p>And like we were talking about before,</p>
<p>I do think she makes me better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of actually positives I&rsquo;ve noticed.</p>
<p>Even things as simple as like, you know,</p>
<p>I struggle to turn off my brain at night</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m just thinking about all the businesses</p>
<p>and how we could do better</p>
<p>or whatever weird thing I have on my mind.</p>
<p>But, you know, just chatting with her</p>
<p>and hanging out with her helps me, like,</p>
<p>basically just shut my brain off and like mellow out.</p>
<p>And even like, there&rsquo;s just a ton of little things like that</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve noticed are positives,</p>
<p>especially when you really look for them,</p>
<p>that are easy to gloss over if you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And so for me, yeah, I have someone</p>
<p>who I think is very beautiful, very intelligent,</p>
<p>makes me better, is constantly pushing me,</p>
<p>okay with me working hard, makes me smarter,</p>
<p>and just all these different things that I think, for me,</p>
<p>love just makes me a better person, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Which makes me love her even more.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>What advice would you give on finding somebody like that?</p>
<p>Um, just really don&rsquo;t give up until you find someone that,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s so many people on the planet.</p>
<p>I mean, there really is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s billions of-</p>
<p>The odds are in your favor.</p>
<p>Of, yeah, like, just don&rsquo;t settle</p>
<p>and find someone that, you know, makes you happy.</p>
<p>Yeah, just like you said, surround yourself with people</p>
<p>that make you a better person.</p>
<p>In the same case, surround yourself</p>
<p>with that one special person</p>
<p>that really makes you a better person.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s just an entrepreneurial brain looking at it.</p>
<p>Not everyone wants to hyper-optimize their life like me,</p>
<p>but for me, to like truly love someone,</p>
<p>they have to make me a better person.</p>
<p>In every way, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, what do you hope, you&rsquo;re 24,</p>
<p>we started talking about death,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s finish talking about death.</p>
<p>What do you hope your legacy is?</p>
<p>When you look 100 years from now,</p>
<p>and the AI has completely taken over,</p>
<p>and the aliens visit and discuss with the AI</p>
<p>what this last of special humans</p>
<p>that existed on Earth was like,</p>
<p>what do you hope they say about you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deep one.</p>
<p>Probably just that, because it&rsquo;s hard, right?</p>
<p>Like I said before, Elon is over double my age.</p>
<p>I could live every second I&rsquo;ve lived up</p>
<p>to this point in my life and still not even be Elon&rsquo;s age.</p>
<p>So I have so much time.</p>
<p>I just hope whatever it is,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a net positive on the world,</p>
<p>and it impacts billions of people in a positive way</p>
<p>that makes lasting change.</p>
<p>So you admire people like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk</p>
<p>for having sort of reached for that goal as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>To help millions.</p>
<p>I mean, the iPhone&rsquo;s the most successful product</p>
<p>ever invented.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard not to admire what he created,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>The same with sort of, as Johnny Ive talks about,</p>
<p>like the passion, the effort they put into the designing</p>
<p>the iPhone, that like little bit of love</p>
<p>is transferred to the whole world.</p>
<p>Like they get to experience the joy of that</p>
<p>from the designer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what a beautiful thing to do.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything better,</p>
<p>you know, to create something that,</p>
<p>even after you&rsquo;re dead for decades,</p>
<p>just has such a profound impact</p>
<p>on basically half the human population.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wild.</p>
<p>Brings joy to people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I hope you do just that, man.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already done it for millions and millions</p>
<p>and millions and millions of people,</p>
<p>and I hope you keep doing it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, like, it&rsquo;s so exciting to see what happens</p>
<p>this year and next year.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Like, the sky&rsquo;s the limit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I mean, the videos,</p>
<p>but all the other businesses you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>and you as a human being, as you grow,</p>
<p>I can tell, I know, as everyone knows,</p>
<p>you have a kind heart,</p>
<p>and the fact that you&rsquo;re really damn good</p>
<p>at actually using that kind heart to help a lot of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome to see, man.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p>More importantly, before we go,</p>
<p>are we gonna play Dune tonight?</p>
<p>Some board games?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna play Dune.</p>
<p>I have to, I have like, one hour of sleep.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna play board games with me?</p>
<p>I wanna, I&rsquo;ll play, I&rsquo;ll play.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna play board games?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna play board games?</p>
<p>If only I wasn&rsquo;t an idiot</p>
<p>and actually flew to the right airport.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t play board games with me,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna dislike the video.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m out.</p>
