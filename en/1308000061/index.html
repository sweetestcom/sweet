    <p>Hey, everybody, welcome to another episode of the all in</p>
<p>podcast. And it is our year end episode. It is our 2021 bestie</p>
<p>awards. This is where we give our awards for the best and</p>
<p>worst of what happened in 2021. We did it last year, kind of</p>
<p>halfheartedly, but this year, hopefully we put a little bit</p>
<p>more work into it with me again, of course, David Friedberg, the</p>
<p>sultan of science, the rain man, David Sachs and sweater Jesus</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya. How&rsquo;s everybody doing? Ready to go?</p>
<p>Did anybody do their homework? Oh my god, we are nine away from</p>
<p>episode 69. And where we will have a special guest special</p>
<p>guest who I&rsquo;ve given the choice of coming on episode 69 or 420</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, he has to do 69. He can&rsquo;t do fortune. He can do</p>
<p>both. He can do whatever he wants. Basically, he did no</p>
<p>wrong. Is he committed? What about jack? Can we get jack on?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t talk about that. If you stop grinding jack. Yeah. Yeah,</p>
<p>maybe if you stop dunking on jack for no reason, you</p>
<p>insufferable sacks. Seriously, you&rsquo;d suffer enough that like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve alienated potential guests. Chamath alienated best now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting in on alienating. I guess it would be too much to</p>
<p>have jack and Chris Dixon on together. Who? Who? Oh my god,</p>
<p>that is so cool. Delete that. Oh, don&rsquo;t look at free. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care about my relationship with AC 16. See, we all know who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the other person? Dick Chris Dixon. Chris Dixon. Yeah, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a general partner to Andreessen Horowitz who runs their crypto</p>
<p>fund? Oh, nice. It wasn&rsquo;t just me. I mean, very vocal lately</p>
<p>about web three. Why don&rsquo;t you guys invite the CFO of Greylock</p>
<p>as well while you&rsquo;re at it?</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t get the partner in charge of human capital at</p>
<p>Excel.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting a little bit far afield. Chris posted something</p>
<p>pretty innocuous on web three and jack jumped down his throat</p>
<p>and same thing as well. I saw the C. Dixon quote. It wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just me. Now you&rsquo;re pretending you retweeted a photo of jack</p>
<p>jumping down Chris Dixon&rsquo;s throat and saying, Whoa, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on here? Now you&rsquo;re trying to pretend like he was triggered</p>
<p>by me. He wasn&rsquo;t triggered by jack after dark jack is gone</p>
<p>wild. Chris Dixon did did try a little misappropriation for</p>
<p>which jack jumped down his throat basically. Horowitz is</p>
<p>saying they always culture appropriate, right? Like Jack is</p>
<p>just like any other guy who quits his job and then goes on</p>
<p>a shitposting rampage. And really like you did. Like</p>
<p>Shabbat did after shutting down. I&rsquo;m just one of his casualties.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of people he&rsquo;s got. He was great. I think he</p>
<p>quit. I think it&rsquo;s great to of Twitter so he could tweet. Yeah,</p>
<p>he wanted to get in there. He wants to focus on blockchain.</p>
<p>Clearly, he has religion on this and he believes that it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>future of the internet. And he cares deeply about the</p>
<p>democratization of access to finance. And I think it would be</p>
<p>awesome to hear his views on this. I would love for him to</p>
<p>come on and not be badgered about censorship in the role</p>
<p>that he used to run. How would you like him talking to you</p>
<p>about, you know, being the CEO of Zenefits?</p>
<p>Sacks like, Okay, honestly, I&rsquo;m not trying to badger him. I only</p>
<p>have one question, which is the reason why he loves Bitcoin is</p>
<p>for censorship resistance. So why when he had the opportunity</p>
<p>as CEO of Twitter, didn&rsquo;t he stand tall for resisting</p>
<p>censorship? David, maybe he did. Okay, so just tell us that</p>
<p>read between the lines, dude. I don&rsquo;t think he has to answer to</p>
<p>the Twitter mob and try to say, here&rsquo;s all the hard decisions I</p>
<p>made that you guys didn&rsquo;t see. You know, there&rsquo;s a dynamics of</p>
<p>a board and lawsuits and hundreds of decisions that the</p>
<p>president inciting a riot at the Capitol, you&rsquo;re not supposed to</p>
<p>create a list and publish it and say, Look at me. I&rsquo;m such a good</p>
<p>boy. I mean, it&rsquo;s not reasonable. I just think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>reasonable question for me to ask. Yeah. But the way you asked</p>
<p>it was like, isn&rsquo;t jack at an ashram like praying? Like you</p>
<p>were full dunk mode. I know that&rsquo;s one of your comedy</p>
<p>writers writing those tweets for you. Did you get was that a</p>
<p>punched up tweet or not? It was a punched up.</p>
<p>No, it was not punched up.</p>
<p>funnier than you actually are. Why did you have to throw my</p>
<p>people? Yeah, why do you have to go to the ashram? Yeah. Why are</p>
<p>you in?</p>
<p>Jack has spent years trying to cultivate this like Zen</p>
<p>approach.</p>
<p>My people nothing to do nothing to do with an ashram.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting lost in the weeds here.</p>
<p>Do you have a music intro?</p>
<p>Please welcome everybody to the 2021 Bestie Awards. Now just put</p>
<p>in like everybody like Denzel Washington and you know, like,</p>
<p>can we edit screenshots from like the last Oscars? You know,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s in our audience.</p>
<p>Oscars from the 80s. Like Tom Cruise getting up and cheering</p>
<p>and whooping. Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sacks.</p>
<p>And it said we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone</p>
<p>crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot at stake here, folks. And we&rsquo;re going to start</p>
<p>it off with biggest winner in politics, a very difficult</p>
<p>decision here. Sacks, biggest winner in politics. Who do you</p>
<p>got?</p>
<p>I got Eric Adams, the new mayor of New York City. He was a huge</p>
<p>underdog candidate. He won by not being woke. He rejected the</p>
<p>you know, woke sensibilities of the other Democratic candidates.</p>
<p>He is a former cop who still packs a gun. And he made his</p>
<p>issues, supporting the police, public safety, charter schools,</p>
<p>you know, as an instrument of minority advancement, and he</p>
<p>even pushed to make New York City a tech and crypto hub, he</p>
<p>is going to reverse the damage done under de Blasio. He won</p>
<p>four or five boroughs, the Democratic primary, and</p>
<p>overwhelmingly carried black Latino precincts. If the</p>
<p>Democratic Party has a future after the rejection of woke, it</p>
<p>is Eric Adams.</p>
<p>Okay, free bird, who you got?</p>
<p>Okay, mine&rsquo;s a little esoteric. But my biggest winner for</p>
<p>politics this year is the blockchain. And I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>why I think that the embracing the blockchain as a technology</p>
<p>that enables an evolution away from what folks consider to be,</p>
<p>you know, centralized control systems, and ultimately,</p>
<p>underscores the interest of the populist notion that&rsquo;s sweeping</p>
<p>over the United States is very strong. And I think it&rsquo;s waking</p>
<p>up politicians, and it&rsquo;s going to wake up the political class</p>
<p>to the fact that this system of organizing social, economic and</p>
<p>political action may ultimately evolve us away from the systems</p>
<p>that we run today. And it is a very serious threat to the</p>
<p>current system of politics and economics and social order. And</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s starting to kind of rear its head and politicians</p>
<p>are starting to wake up to it. And they&rsquo;re all thinking very</p>
<p>deeply about what it means. And so I would say the blockchain</p>
<p>has really kind of created a new model for organization amongst</p>
<p>humans, that is waking us up in the political class more than</p>
<p>anything else.</p>
<p>Okay, come off. Who do you got?</p>
<p>I think this is pretty obvious. But I think it&rsquo;s Glenn Youngkin,</p>
<p>the governor of Virginia, here&rsquo;s a guy that was a private equity</p>
<p>executive, who basically had to fade Trump, but still pretend to</p>
<p>feign that he needed his support and ran a pretty centrist, you</p>
<p>know, pro education, anti crime, pro business, pro just</p>
<p>individual, you know, empowerment campaign in</p>
<p>Virginia, which hasn&rsquo;t swung this way for a long time, and</p>
<p>basically beat Terry McAuliffe. And I think that this is the</p>
<p>roadmap, which effectively says, whether you&rsquo;re a democrat or a</p>
<p>republican, grab into the centrist temples, and run with</p>
<p>it. And you&rsquo;re going to get a ton of people in the silent</p>
<p>majority, who are sick of all of this fringe behavior, both on</p>
<p>the left and the right. And so I think Glenn Youngkin was a real</p>
<p>canary in the coal mine for the political future of America.</p>
<p>All right, great selection so far, and a lot of diversity in</p>
<p>the picking. And so I went with Joe mentioned, obviously, the</p>
<p>shadow president who was able to dictate what gets passed and</p>
<p>build back better getting canceled, or cut from six plus</p>
<p>billion down to maybe 1.5 billion, if it ever gets</p>
<p>trillion rather, sorry, thank you, was my</p>
<p>hey, Sam, do you think a rising star or a foiling star after his</p>
<p>decision to denounce the build back better bill this year this</p>
<p>week?</p>
<p>Well, you guys have to remember that the state he&rsquo;s from West</p>
<p>Virginia went for Trump, I like 20 points, it is a deep red</p>
<p>state and mentioned himself as a major anomaly as a blue</p>
<p>politician hanging on in that state. Yeah. So the democrats</p>
<p>instead of alienating him should be thanking their lucky stars</p>
<p>that they even have him for any votes because any other</p>
<p>democratic politician in West Virginia would have gone down to</p>
<p>defeat a long time ago. So they are lucky that mansion can vote</p>
<p>with them at all on anything</p>
<p>to a layman like myself, or I imagine most people who aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>aware of that kind of political circumstance, he looks like a</p>
<p>john mccain maverick kind of guy, like he&rsquo;s coming in and</p>
<p>saying, I&rsquo;m blowing this thing up. And he gets all this</p>
<p>attention. I think that&rsquo;s a fire for him, maybe.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a great analogy, which I think he is the</p>
<p>democrats McCain, you know, he is the guy coming in there</p>
<p>casting that very unpopular vote, the single vote, like</p>
<p>McCain did on the repeal of Obamacare, the single vote that</p>
<p>took that down. But the reality is the republicans on Obamacare</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have a plausible alternative. That&rsquo;s why McCain</p>
<p>voted against that. And I think here, in the same way, I think</p>
<p>mansion may be doing the democrats a favor, because we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t afford all the spent new spending.</p>
<p>Super interesting. Yeah,</p>
<p>here we go. Biggest loser in politics. Who do you got? Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go in reverse order. Now, Chamath, who do you got?</p>
<p>You go first, JL.</p>
<p>My biggest loser is Elizabeth Warren. She wanted everybody to</p>
<p>pay a lot of taxes who were in the billionaires to pay taxes,</p>
<p>she wanted to cancel them. And now the largest tax bill ever</p>
<p>paid by any American has been completed. According to a tweet</p>
<p>from Elon that he paid $11 billion. Every program she</p>
<p>wanted to work for, and fight for has been done just not by</p>
<p>her. It&rsquo;s been done by the private sector. She was</p>
<p>attacking Bezos for pay in factories and getting to a $15</p>
<p>minimum wage. Now Amazon is regularly paying in the 20s and</p>
<p>giving free college something her and Bernie Sanders were not</p>
<p>able to accomplish in their entire careers. And now she</p>
<p>continues to dunk on capitalists, entrepreneurs, as</p>
<p>the country basically says, we&rsquo;re not interested in</p>
<p>socialism, we&rsquo;re not interested in this brand of politics. They</p>
<p>lost the election. Biden won. And now this far left politics</p>
<p>is I think becoming, you know, as as unimportant as the far</p>
<p>right, you know, alt right. She&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;s basically not</p>
<p>important.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll build on your theme. And I actually just said the</p>
<p>progressive left and the alt right. So I think that the</p>
<p>church extremes in America have basically, you know, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>exposed them for the emperor with no clothes. So, you know,</p>
<p>we have tried progressive policies in cities and states in</p>
<p>America that&rsquo;s failed. We&rsquo;ve tried far right politics at the</p>
<p>federal level, that&rsquo;s basically crashed and burned as well. And</p>
<p>now what you see is a wave of normalcy. And so, you know, all</p>
<p>these chortling, you know, fringe classes, get an extreme</p>
<p>amount of attention, because what they say is salacious or</p>
<p>interesting, but underneath, there&rsquo;s no real substance or</p>
<p>follow through or real skill, there&rsquo;s no basic understanding</p>
<p>of anything, economic policy, foreign policy, none of it. And</p>
<p>so they make for great soundbites, but they cannot</p>
<p>govern. And so I think the biggest losers, the progressive</p>
<p>left and the alt right. Sach, you want to go next?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, very much in the same vein, my choices, Kamala</p>
<p>Harris, the vice president, she has a 28% approval rating polls</p>
<p>show her lagging Biden by about 10 points. No vice president has</p>
<p>pulled this poorly since Dan Quayle was the butt of every</p>
<p>late night joke about 30 years ago. And boy, am I really dating</p>
<p>myself with that reference? What&rsquo;s the problem? Yeah,</p>
<p>exactly. A lot of viewers don&rsquo;t even remember what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about. But so the problem here is kind of what Chamath was</p>
<p>saying. She, Harris is an equity scold, the public is tired of</p>
<p>being lectured and hectored about its woke sins. And trying</p>
<p>to compensate for that and showing, you know, warmth with a</p>
<p>fake laughing cackle isn&rsquo;t going to reassure anybody who&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>been called a white supremacist.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, last year on our award show, Jason</p>
<p>calacanis made the prediction that Kamala will be the first</p>
<p>female president of the United States. Just as a gentle</p>
<p>reminder that we had, I love it how you how you called him</p>
<p>calacanis calacanis. Well, he likes to monetize his name.</p>
<p>Okay, fried bird.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, I made because I thought Biden wasn&rsquo;t going to</p>
<p>make it through the first term because he&rsquo;s so old. And then he</p>
<p>might not be able to function.</p>
<p>That was that was right. Yeah, that may still happen. Yeah, I</p>
<p>think I might stand by that prediction. We&rsquo;ll save it for</p>
<p>the prediction show.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ll save it for a prediction show next week. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking no weeks off is the new rule here. All right, moving on.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, I got my biggest loser. Oh, yeah. So sorry.</p>
<p>My biggest political loser is Tony Fauci. I feel like this guy</p>
<p>got totally viced out this year. determinism is a trap, right? In</p>
<p>his role, you have to be deterministic, meaning you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying you got to do x to get y, in order to get people to take</p>
<p>action. And so, you know, in order, determinism was needed</p>
<p>for clarity of action to get people to take the vaccine. And</p>
<p>he said, Hey, this is gonna, you know, ultimately end the</p>
<p>pandemic. And the problem with determinism is it drives binary</p>
<p>outcomes, you&rsquo;re either right or you&rsquo;re wrong. And in this case,</p>
<p>he was wrong, right? He said, Go get the vaccine, the pandemic</p>
<p>will end. Everyone got the vaccine and the pandemic</p>
<p>certainly didn&rsquo;t end and it evolved and it became this very</p>
<p>fuzzy gray map on where we sit today. And I think as a result,</p>
<p>he completely lost credibility with a broad swath of people who</p>
<p>otherwise would have been kind of still standing behind him.</p>
<p>Because I do think he&rsquo;s, you know, he&rsquo;s an honest, just</p>
<p>forthright scientist. But in order to drive outcomes, he had</p>
<p>to be very kind of stated. And it was a bit of a trap this</p>
<p>year. And I think he got screwed. So poor, poor Tony</p>
<p>Fauci. I mean, bless him, but it was a rough year.</p>
<p>All right, biggest political surprise. Saks, what do you got?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the biggest political surprise?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is where I had Glenn Youngkin. And, you know, I just</p>
<p>add to what Schmoth already said, you know, Virginia went</p>
<p>for Biden by 10 points just a short time before. Youngkin, he</p>
<p>secured Trump&rsquo;s endorsement very early and quietly and kept the</p>
<p>kept Trump at bay. And then he ran as a general moderate with</p>
<p>the business pedigree as kind of Schmoth pointed out. But there</p>
<p>was something else going on here as well. I don&rsquo;t think it was</p>
<p>just centrism that would flip a blue state red. It was also that</p>
<p>issue of schools where McAuliffe had that gaffe. In their final</p>
<p>debate, he said that parents shouldn&rsquo;t be telling the</p>
<p>schools what to teach. Basically, McAuliffe was cited</p>
<p>with the teachers unions. And whereas Youngkin sided with</p>
<p>parents, and really, I think a voice their opposition to CRT in</p>
<p>the schools that became the centerpiece of his closing</p>
<p>argument. And that&rsquo;s what allowed him to win win the</p>
<p>election.</p>
<p>My biggest political surprise is Joe Manchin. I think that he</p>
<p>will probably be looked back on in time as our generation&rsquo;s Paul</p>
<p>Volcker. So let me explain what I mean by that. You know, at the</p>
<p>time, Volcker was incredibly unpopular for what he did by</p>
<p>raising interest rates to basically break the back of</p>
<p>inflation. And it really wasn&rsquo;t until 30 or 40 years later</p>
<p>through the, you know, fullness of time that we appreciated that</p>
<p>what he did, took an enormous amount of courage, because in</p>
<p>the moment, it created huge headaches, and a lot of pushback</p>
<p>and a lot of ill will and ire towards Volcker. Similarly, I</p>
<p>think Manchin is just now starting this process of just</p>
<p>getting completely pilloried. And, you know, people will point</p>
<p>to a handful of elements of build back better, like</p>
<p>childcare, that have now expired, and those childcare</p>
<p>credits and what it means to working families. And that is</p>
<p>true, that but there are ways to solve for that, by just going</p>
<p>back and re spending the 7 trillion we already spend a</p>
<p>little bit better. And in time, the idea and the courage to not</p>
<p>pour three more trillion dollars on this dumpster fire, without</p>
<p>getting ourselves better organized will turn out to be an</p>
<p>enormous gift that he gave our kids a profile and courage, even</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t right now see it, and a lot of people can be angry</p>
<p>at it. But that was the biggest political surprise is the desire</p>
<p>for a politician, politician, because like, you have to</p>
<p>remember, Fed chair is elected, right? You&rsquo;re there, you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>your out. But that was a surprise to me that he would go</p>
<p>through this process and what it meant at a national level for</p>
<p>his reputation to get to the other side.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay, freeberg. What do you got?</p>
<p>My biggest political surprise was that that insurrection crowd</p>
<p>made their way into the Capitol building. I mean, do you guys</p>
<p>remember how shocking those images were? Yeah. And what an</p>
<p>incredible day that was. I mean, it was almost a year ago</p>
<p>now. And we watched on screen what felt like the crumbling of</p>
<p>institutions that we always took for being. We always took for</p>
<p>granted and assumed were impenetrable, both politically,</p>
<p>but more importantly, physically, and to see people</p>
<p>physically break into that Capitol building, and cause</p>
<p>mayhem and damage. It really kind of exposed, I think, a</p>
<p>nerve. And it was a really kind of shocking moment, a shocking</p>
<p>day. So, you know, to this day, I still kind of think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been the biggest surprise for me of the year. I</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t think any of us thought that that would</p>
<p>happen, both in terms of like, that we let our defenses down</p>
<p>and let people into that building like that. And that</p>
<p>there was enough of a groundswell to break their way</p>
<p>into that building. Both sides were surprising.</p>
<p>And also just super disturbing to watch a bunch of elected</p>
<p>officials cowering under tables while Secret Service had guns</p>
<p>drawn and doors were being kicked in.</p>
<p>And also, while some elected officials were kind of endorsing</p>
<p>the behavior to some extent, you know, at a distance, the whole</p>
<p>thing was just shocking. And I think a lot of us realize that</p>
<p>maybe our democracy and I think I mentioned this on the show</p>
<p>last year, is not a little more fragile than perhaps we we</p>
<p>think it is.</p>
<p>Trump was the biggest stress test ever. For me, the biggest</p>
<p>political surprise was Kamala Harris being sidelined. Where is</p>
<p>she? What is she working on? I thought that the Democratic</p>
<p>Party was going to want to feature her showcase her with</p>
<p>some great projects in order to maybe prep her for running if</p>
<p>need be in 24. And certainly in 2028. And it seems like they</p>
<p>have sidelined her deliberately. And they don&rsquo;t believe in her</p>
<p>which is they don&rsquo;t believe in the first female vice president</p>
<p>and of color.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that I think that they think what is not</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not they think that she&rsquo;s not electable. And so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>judging. Yeah.</p>
<p>So maybe they&rsquo;re racist jk.</p>
<p>Or maybe they are saving her till after the midterms and then</p>
<p>going to feature her I don&rsquo;t know what the strategy is the</p>
<p>house.</p>
<p>Like a fighter. They&rsquo;re sitting protecting her.</p>
<p>But if she was good enough to get to help get Biden in</p>
<p>office. Why isn&rsquo;t she good enough to feature now? It just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. That she was so</p>
<p>sad. Well, they did give her a task like they sent her to the</p>
<p>border. The problem is she doesn&rsquo;t have anything to say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that will resonate with the American people but also be</p>
<p>acceptable to her progressive base.</p>
<p>For her perceived her perceived progressive biggest because I</p>
<p>actually think that she also has the ability and has in the past,</p>
<p>you know, had the ability to be tough.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an order da I mean, she&rsquo;s ripped.</p>
<p>So she she completely has the ability to just be nails if she</p>
<p>wants to be. But again, she and again, maybe even Biden to some</p>
<p>degree, still believe that the progressive left is the future</p>
<p>of the party. I think that most of us here think that it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>head fake. And until she comes to those terms herself, she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not she&rsquo;s going to continue to be sidelined. But if she tacks</p>
<p>back to the center and actually gets out there, I think she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really capable of doing some stuff here. She&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>articulate. She&rsquo;s very punchy. Anybody she took, you know, she</p>
<p>can really tell the truth. But then she can also really just</p>
<p>shuck and jive and say nothing when she wants to. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just what&rsquo;s that corporal speak isn&rsquo;t working for her.</p>
<p>Did anybody else notice freeberg sacks, that the initial</p>
<p>reaction to mansions vote or saying he wasn&rsquo;t going to vote</p>
<p>for this on Sunday during the talk shows was like dunking on</p>
<p>him. Oh my god, he&rsquo;s horrible. And then immediately Monday,</p>
<p>they were trying to reconcile with him and say, Hey, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>have a reasonable discussion about this. We value your</p>
<p>opinion as a partner.</p>
<p>Well, it was this weird emotional reaction. Like I got</p>
<p>this email I forwarded to you guys from about Yeah, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like crazy in that email, like in that in her press release or</p>
<p>whatever that email that she sent to us, a bunch of us got</p>
<p>it. I mean, Jen&rsquo;s going crazy. Yeah, hysterical.</p>
<p>It was CYA by the administration, like they</p>
<p>wasted everyone&rsquo;s time for six months pushing this bill forward</p>
<p>without checking to see if the swing votes would go for it. So</p>
<p>then the swing votes don&rsquo;t go for it, the bill fails. And</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re blaming those seconds.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s that they just ignored what the swing votes are</p>
<p>saying. He&rsquo;s been saying from the beginning, it&rsquo;s too big.</p>
<p>Totally number was 1.5. And they just said, you know what, we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>wait to the end and then try to high pressure him or something</p>
<p>or flip him at the end. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to push for that big a bill when it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>5050 Senate, they should have gone for something smaller and</p>
<p>more reasonable.</p>
<p>Either either that or they should have made a better</p>
<p>calculation on inflation. Because again, the minute that</p>
<p>we had these big inflation prints, and the Fed basically</p>
<p>changed their tapering posture, that was the bullet in the gun.</p>
<p>And you basically handed mansion a loaded weapon and said, Here</p>
<p>you go, do what you will</p>
<p>with this terrible betting strategy by the Republican</p>
<p>party. Well, he warned them. He warned them that he was very</p>
<p>worried about inflation. And they were saying it was</p>
<p>transitory. And then he turned out to be right. Right. All</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>Biggest winner in business free broke. Who you got? Biggest</p>
<p>winner?</p>
<ol start="2021">
<li>My biggest winner in business goes back to the Game</li>
</ol>
<p>Stop days. And I think it was the retail investor class. You</p>
<p>know, they were always there to trade on the wings and in the</p>
<p>wake of the institutions and the markets prior to I think what</p>
<p>took place this year. And after what happened this year, where</p>
<p>they were able to coalesce and organize to make trades that</p>
<p>move the market against institutions in a really</p>
<p>meaningful way and broke several institutions in the process. It</p>
<p>highlighted that retail has power, retail can organize and</p>
<p>retail in aggregate can act to be a stronger force in the</p>
<p>markets than institutions. And so the retail investor is my</p>
<p>biggest winner for 2021.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s your biggest winner? Chamath in business?</p>
<p>I mean, this is pretty obvious. It&rsquo;s Elon Musk. You know, as a</p>
<p>former owner of Tesla as a current shareholder of SpaceX,</p>
<p>as somebody who sold him a company this year, David and I</p>
<p>did, to see him work is magical. Absolutely magical. And I think</p>
<p>that this guy, you know, you know, there&rsquo;s there are these</p>
<p>impresarios who just have these virtuosos who have these moments</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re just in the zone. Yeah. And he&rsquo;s in the zone. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in his zone of mastery. And to see a guy like that execute, I</p>
<p>think is a privilege. So he&rsquo;s my if not Elon, who would you have?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s pretty obvious. It&rsquo;s Elon. So did you have a</p>
<p>second place consideration, I would actually probably double</p>
<p>down with what Friedberg said, I do think that there was, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more sort of what I would say is the outsider class versus</p>
<p>insiders. I think that whether it&rsquo;s blockchain, or web three,</p>
<p>or NFTs, or GameStop, this was the year, you know, the</p>
<p>Constitution Dow, this was the year that loose affiliations of</p>
<p>individuals could compete on a level playing field with</p>
<p>organized capital. And I think that that&rsquo;s a really important</p>
<p>trend for the future.</p>
<p>Saks, who do you have biggest winner in business? If it is</p>
<p>Elon, who&rsquo;s your runner up?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, can&rsquo;t fault that Elon choice is pretty</p>
<p>obvious. But I would say in our world, the biggest winner was</p>
<p>Tiger Global. They basically productize growth stage capital</p>
<p>by far the biggest deployer of late stage funding, they</p>
<p>productized it. So pretty much founders can just send their</p>
<p>metrics on like a single sheet of paper, and they get a term</p>
<p>sheet within two days, they did by far the most deals. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really the SoftBank strategy done right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great pick 15 billion. I think it&rsquo;s the amount they</p>
<p>deployed this year. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys heard that number.</p>
<p>But yeah, yeah. In a single year to invest 15 billion assume a</p>
<p>five year fund, you know, you&rsquo;re at a $75 billion run rate. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty incredible. I mean, it really is the size of vision</p>
<p>fund. And I heard I don&rsquo;t know if you guys heard, but they are</p>
<p>heavily dependent, not dependent, but they&rsquo;ve built</p>
<p>infrastructure with third parties who source all this</p>
<p>data for them to really kind of measure everything prior to</p>
<p>making investments. They built a machine. It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>My biggest winner in business is the ang not the fang drop the F</p>
<p>and go with the A and G. Amazon has a new CEO and they have a</p>
<p>Mr. Beat. Apple is about to hit 3 trillion. And Susan Wojcicki</p>
<p>and YouTube if you don&rsquo;t know is now at 2 billion users 30</p>
<p>billion in revenue. And this of course is after Elon, because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the obvious choice. So after Elon, Alphabet stock up</p>
<p>66% Apple stock up 31% you guys know what&rsquo;s going on with those</p>
<p>big companies. So I&rsquo;m going to go with the ang biggest loser in</p>
<p>business. The biggest loser in business. Who do you have</p>
<p>Friedberg? Who&rsquo;s your biggest loser?</p>
<p>Well, I went I went to the opposite of my biggest winner. I</p>
<p>went for those institutions that that, you know, got their lunch</p>
<p>eaten by the retail, Gabe Plotkin. And, you know, he lost</p>
<p>so much money, shorting GameStop against these guys, buying</p>
<p>GameStop to the moon, he had to borrow $2.75 billion from</p>
<p>Citadel and .72 just to get through his month. I mean, talk</p>
<p>about embarrassing. Talk about reversal of fortune. You know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s obviously been a renowned investor prior to this. And you</p>
<p>know, there&rsquo;s a few others that that were, you know, casualties</p>
<p>of war, White Square, a firm in London shut down half a billion</p>
<p>AUM. So all these folks who tried to bet against retail</p>
<p>during the GameStop saga, and since thinking that the world</p>
<p>was the way it used to be, I&rsquo;ve had to kind of change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that that and the insurrection bolt happened in</p>
<p>this year, like time is moving so fast.</p>
<p>Oh my god, this year is insane. Yeah, it&rsquo;s been a crazy year.</p>
<p>All of this happened in this past year. It&rsquo;s crazy to think</p>
<p>about we were here and I was up in Tahoe skiing and all this</p>
<p>stuff was breaking. It was crazy that time that was actually our</p>
<p>record episode. When all in had that breakout episode, who do</p>
<p>you have for your biggest loser, David Sachs?</p>
<p>I have Chinese billionaires were the biggest loser this year.</p>
<p>If you guys remember, yeah, exactly. A year ago, we were</p>
<p>all asking, where&rsquo;s Jack Ma? Well, he eventually turned up</p>
<p>looking very thin and kind of broken. But his experience was</p>
<p>just an early sort of manifestation and sort of a</p>
<p>canary in the coal mine of a larger CCP crackdown on all</p>
<p>Chinese billionaires. And the CCP really seems to be</p>
<p>increasing its control and putting these people under its</p>
<p>thumb. And there are a bunch of tech companies there like</p>
<p>Alibaba, DD, Tencent, Baidu, JD.com. They&rsquo;ve all been</p>
<p>targeted for fines and tighter controls. And China&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>much shut down the foreign IPO market for their tech companies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been moving into Hong Kong, right? I mean, yeah,</p>
<p>exactly. They&rsquo;re the CCP has basically brought all the</p>
<p>billionaires under their thumb. Wow.</p>
<p>Chamath, who do you have? And this is amazing, just so the</p>
<p>audience knows. We do not reveal our choices until it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>so great. Yeah, I love hearing some of these things. It makes</p>
<p>me think for sure. Yeah, my my biggest losers big tech. If you</p>
<p>look at this year, and you annotate it not for their stock</p>
<p>price, but for what I think is sort of the the precursor to</p>
<p>longer term success. There was a lot of signs that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pressure building. So whether that&rsquo;s measured in lawsuits,</p>
<p>fines, bad PR, if you put all of that stuff together, I think</p>
<p>the thing that that drives is decaying morale. And when you</p>
<p>have decaying morale, you have human capital flight. So people</p>
<p>leave. There were some articles just recently even about, you</p>
<p>know, an exodus that, you know, novi novi, I don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>pronounce it, the cryptocurrency business of meta. It&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>really, really difficult thing to deal with when folks start</p>
<p>walking out the door, because they&rsquo;re just bummed out from</p>
<p>working there. And if you just, and if you just, you know,</p>
<p>Google search the number of issues that all of these</p>
<p>companies collectively are dealing with, I think that this</p>
<p>is sort of peak, big tech market cap is probably within the next</p>
<p>year or two.</p>
<p>Interesting. This is just so great that we all had different</p>
<p>choices. I picked the Aang as the winner. I&rsquo;m picking the F</p>
<p>in Fang as the loser meta was a complete flop. It was a stupid</p>
<p>idea to change the name of the company. The product they showed</p>
<p>in that big tip off was like every science fiction movie</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen for the last 30 years, the leaks, the Apple</p>
<p>headwinds against their ads, the political headwinds. And my last</p>
<p>point is exactly Chamath&rsquo;s last point, which is no one wants to</p>
<p>work there. It&rsquo;s becoming more and more difficult if you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>Silicon Valley, or you&rsquo;re a tech executive, to see a reason</p>
<p>to go work at that company. I think that their VR efforts, AR</p>
<p>efforts will be beaten handily by Apple and by the metaverse</p>
<p>and, you know, open source slash decentralized solutions. I think</p>
<p>the F in Fang should be replaced with the T of Tesla and be Tang</p>
<p>Facebook. Meta traded up 25% this year. Jekyll.</p>
<p>Listen, I do think it&rsquo;s a juggernaut. And when things go</p>
<p>wrong, it does take a while. So these are forward looking. If</p>
<p>people are leaving now, maybe you&rsquo;d see the impact of that in</p>
<p>three, four or five years, but I would not buy the stock. I&rsquo;d buy</p>
<p>the other three letters, I would buy the Tang, but not the F and</p>
<p>Fang. But I think it&rsquo;s a good counterpoint. Yeah, these things</p>
<p>take a while to unwrap.</p>
<p>Well, I think, you know, I think the better trade is pick the one</p>
<p>that you love in Fang, and short the one that you hate and Fang.</p>
<p>And if you get that right, you can make a lot of money pretty</p>
<p>safe.</p>
<p>Spread there, right? The spread trade like we talked about. All</p>
<p>right. Biggest business surprise. What do you got sex?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your biggest business surprises?</p>
<p>I thought that the biggest business surprise was tech</p>
<p>leaders and startups moving to Miami, its emergence from really</p>
<p>nothing in the tech scene to being a major tech hub. It was</p>
<p>just a year ago, one year ago, last December, that Delian sort</p>
<p>of mused on Twitter about, hey, can we just relocate Silicon</p>
<p>Valley to Miami? The Miami Mayor Francis Suarez jumped in, he</p>
<p>responded, How can I help? And then since then, it&rsquo;s just been</p>
<p>snowballing. And as San Francisco has basically been</p>
<p>sliding into what it&rsquo;s become, Miami just keeps blowing up. And</p>
<p>it helps. I think what&rsquo;s been happening on the state level</p>
<p>there that DeSantis has kept the state open for business, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kept schools open. And of course, the tax rate is zero. The</p>
<p>income tax and the capital gains tax that is are zero. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really pretty amazing how fast it has become a major tech hub.</p>
<p>My answer, which was really surprising to me starting in</p>
<p>January, and I think I started texting you guys in January</p>
<p>saying, I really think we should talk about this on the pod, if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll remember, and it&rsquo;s obviously just become a</p>
<p>crescendo since then as NFTs. And it really has been</p>
<p>incredible to watch how, you know, the individual folks in</p>
<p>crypto have embraced NFTs as a way, you know, to tokenize the</p>
<p>value that creators can bring to the world. And I think, yeah,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of fluff and a lot of noise and a lot of bubbles</p>
<p>going on within this NFT space right now, most of it will die.</p>
<p>And it will look terrible when people lose lots of money and</p>
<p>feel bad about the decisions they made during this phase. But</p>
<p>what I think is really wonderful about it is the opportunity it</p>
<p>creates for creators to monetize their talent in a way that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t require them going through middlemen to get</p>
<p>distribution and middlemen who take, you know, huge slugs or</p>
<p>huge chunks of the margin out of what they create. And this</p>
<p>can ultimately translate into music, into art, into writing,</p>
<p>into all sorts of things. So I&rsquo;m pretty excited, not</p>
<p>necessarily about where NFTs sit today, I think it&rsquo;s disaster</p>
<p>where it sits today. But I think over the long run, I just love</p>
<p>it a disaster. I just think there&rsquo;s too much of this bubbly</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s going on where people are buying into</p>
<p>speculative transactions that are going to lose them money and</p>
<p>then people are gonna be really hurt and really upset. But the</p>
<p>general core tech, I love the fact I love the fact that</p>
<p>creators people that are great at art and people that are</p>
<p>creative, can develop stuff and make money because people will</p>
<p>appreciate it and pay for it. And I just think that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Fantastic. Alright, so for me, it was that dows were able to</p>
<p>raise $40 million in a couple of days for this constitution, and</p>
<p>get and basically captures every capture the entire world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>imagination for, you know, a 72 hour news cycle, much in the way</p>
<p>the day traders did with AMC, and GameStop to freebirds point</p>
<p>earlier in the big winners. And I&rsquo;m, I have a dual one here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely surprised about this, you know, the the Dow that</p>
<p>was able to raise 40 million for the Constitution. But I was also</p>
<p>disappointed that the SEC in your 10 plus of crypto has not</p>
<p>defined the rules of the road yet. So that one group of</p>
<p>people, professional capital allocators play by one set of</p>
<p>rules. And then another group of people dows tokens are playing</p>
<p>by no set of rules, or their interpretation of unclear rules,</p>
<p>I guess, would be the most charitable way. So that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>biggest surprise, we have to have a regulatory framework for</p>
<p>crypto for dows for NFTs for tokens. And it&rsquo;s just crazy that</p>
<p>it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. What do you got?</p>
<p>My big business winner, breakout company, I have two, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the same really is Moderna slash biotech. You know, these were</p>
<p>guys that were kind of swimming at the edges of science and R&amp;D</p>
<p>and somewhat was just incapable of putting one foot in front of</p>
<p>the other until this pandemic and through a bunch of, you</p>
<p>know, emergency use authorizations, these guys have</p>
<p>really shown up to help the world. And in 2020, I think they</p>
<p>cemented themselves as now on a path to not just, you know, be a</p>
<p>vaccine maker for COVID, but a whole bunch of other things,</p>
<p>including cancer treatments and everything else. So I think</p>
<p>these two companies, these two companies really took a big step</p>
<p>forward in 2020. Absolutely. And just as a side note, OpenSea had</p>
<p>8 million a monthly value volume at the beginning of the year in</p>
<p>January and 3.46 billion in August. Give me a little idea of</p>
<p>the scale of that. Okay, best science breakthrough. What do</p>
<p>you got? Freeberg? Everybody wants to know the sultan of</p>
<p>sciences, best science breakthrough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit blinders on this one, because I think I</p>
<p>mentioned this on the show a few weeks ago, and I&rsquo;m spending</p>
<p>quite a bit of time at work on it, which is that starch</p>
<p>synthesis system that was demonstrated by those Chinese</p>
<p>scientists. And the system itself is likely not going to be</p>
<p>the production system that saves the world. But the concept that</p>
<p>we can take proteins that are expressed by different plants</p>
<p>and put them together in a tank, and then that tank can convert</p>
<p>molecules from one form to another by leveraging these</p>
<p>proteins that just interact and move move around in the tank is</p>
<p>really an incredible demonstration. And the</p>
<p>demonstration is inspiring, we can take carbon out of the</p>
<p>atmosphere and make food with a minimal amount of renewable</p>
<p>electricity. And I think that&rsquo;s really a moment that will</p>
<p>inspire a whole new realm of industrial synthetic biology</p>
<p>work. A lot of which I hope to kind of, you know, build and</p>
<p>participate in pretty heavily in the work that we do day to day,</p>
<p>but it was really exciting for me.</p>
<p>So the starch synthesis synthesis system is your best</p>
<p>science breakthrough. What do you got sex?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got these new oral COVID antiviral pills that are coming</p>
<p>out from Pfizer Merck, the FDA is supposed to be approving them</p>
<p>by the end of this week. As you&rsquo;ll recall, last year around</p>
<p>this time, it was these new mRNA vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna,</p>
<p>but we now have to admit that the vaccines have not ended the</p>
<p>pandemic because the virus can mutate its spike proteins around</p>
<p>the the vaccine. So the vaccines by itself cannot end the</p>
<p>pandemic. These new pills have, I think, a very good shot of</p>
<p>doing it next year, because they&rsquo;re protease inhibitors,</p>
<p>they stop the virus from replicating. And just in even if</p>
<p>the spike proteins mutate, it will not prevent these protease</p>
<p>inhibitors from working. So I am hopeful that this will be the</p>
<p>thing hopefully that ends the pandemic next year are these new</p>
<p>antiviral pills.</p>
<p>Right one, I would like to make a counter to sexes. Point, I</p>
<p>would be very cautious about the side effects that are going to</p>
<p>arise from these protease inhibitors. And, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re not as well studied as they normally</p>
<p>would be. But there are, they have a serious biological effect</p>
<p>in normal cells in the human body. And I think as more people</p>
<p>use them, you&rsquo;ll see more crazy stories about side effects that</p>
<p>are really significant effects would be there&rsquo;s a lot that are</p>
<p>well documented, but the way they work biologically is they</p>
<p>disrupt, you know, certain systems. And those are not just</p>
<p>systems related to the virus, their systems in our own cells.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m personally quite nervous about them. I know that</p>
<p>folks are pretty encouraged by them and excited, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>nervous about them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a similar medication that&rsquo;s been developed for HIV,</p>
<p>right? That&rsquo;s called prep, right? Does that cause similar side</p>
<p>effects? Or because people use that prophylactically?</p>
<p>Yeah, to some extent, you know, and the dosage matters. And so</p>
<p>normally, you would go through many more years, I think of</p>
<p>testing on these things to kind of truly quantify, you know,</p>
<p>when you have half a percent or 1% of a population, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, take the most extreme case die, then a million people</p>
<p>use it, you&rsquo;re gonna have a lot of people dying. And I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure we&rsquo;ve really gotten the boundaries of this yet. And the</p>
<p>dosage is pretty significant on them. So yeah, like, let&rsquo;s, you</p>
<p>know, let&rsquo;s keep a watchful eye on this stuff. But I&rsquo;m hopeful,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also nervous.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the number of people who need to take it free bird</p>
<p>correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, if we&rsquo;ve got this many people</p>
<p>vaxxed, who will not need to take it. And then Omicron,</p>
<p>my biggest optimism is just that Omicron is a much less virulent</p>
<p>virus, and it sweeps through the population. And we slowly see</p>
<p>this pandemic kind of, you know, becoming less severe,</p>
<p>which is what was predicted. Do you think herd immunity even</p>
<p>exists</p>
<p>in the way that the virus evolves? No. So there, and by</p>
<p>the way, it&rsquo;s not binary. It&rsquo;s not like, hey, you get herd</p>
<p>immunity, and no one&rsquo;s going to catch this thing. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clearly a spectrum of immunity, meaning like I can maybe get the</p>
<p>virus and be somewhat contagious for half a day or a day, and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know it. And then I&rsquo;m spreading it for that half day,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t even know I had it. That&rsquo;s kind of, you know, not</p>
<p>all the way over to herd immunity and the traditional</p>
<p>kind of definition of the way that we talk about it. But it</p>
<p>reduces the spread and the severity and aggregate. On the</p>
<p>other end is like everyone gets it, it spreads like crazy, no,</p>
<p>no vaccine stops, it changes anything, no amount of</p>
<p>antibodies changes anything, and everyone just dies. And so</p>
<p>somewhere in the middle, I think is where we find our kind of,</p>
<p>you know, our ground, but I don&rsquo;t think that the traditional</p>
<p>definition or the way that people talk about herd immunity,</p>
<p>which is, hey, everyone get the shot and this thing&rsquo;s over, is</p>
<p>going to play out that way at all, this is going to be a slow,</p>
<p>slow wind down.</p>
<p>Okay, and to give Chamath some credit, you said it would be a</p>
<p>nothing burger. And so far, it looks like deaths and</p>
<p>hospitalization, specifically ICUs, admittance has not turned</p>
<p>out to be a major issue yet, knock on wood,</p>
<p>unless something escapes from the lab again, I think that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re gonna be okay. I think this is the end of the</p>
<p>end. So</p>
<p>that would be so great if this was the end of the endgame.</p>
<p>My best science breakthrough is that this year, we actually</p>
<p>were able to inject in vivo. So in the body genetic code for</p>
<p>CRISPR, two cases specifically, one was to basically reduce the</p>
<p>production of this toxic liver protein in a bunch of folks. And</p>
<p>then the second one, moderately improve the vision of some</p>
<p>people who had some form of inherited blindness. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty incredible stuff that you can, you know, make something,</p>
<p>put it into your body. And then you know, your body does the</p>
<p>work of editing out the bad genes. And that&rsquo;s a, I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a pretty incredible breakthrough.</p>
<p>I had the starch on my list, too. But I went with Starship.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know, on March 3, Starship, serial</p>
<p>number 10, SN 10, completed SpaceX third high altitude</p>
<p>flight test of a prototype type, and they were able to ascend and</p>
<p>then reorient themselves and land. If you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Starship is ginormous when compared to the Falcon and the</p>
<p>other rockets that SpaceX has produced, I got to see it</p>
<p>actually, I went to Boca. And when you look inside that nose</p>
<p>cone, you can fit 300 people in it, it is a payload that is</p>
<p>absolutely unprecedented in terms of sending people or</p>
<p>things to space. And the fact that this has succeeded means</p>
<p>all the folks at SpaceX need to do is to scale it. And they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pretty good at scaling things, they just had their hundredth</p>
<p>landing of their smaller rocket. And so when this big boy, this</p>
<p>BFR, big frickin rocket gets going, it&rsquo;s going to change the</p>
<p>nature of our species as multi planetary planetary and being</p>
<p>able to reach and put things in space that we&rsquo;ve never been able</p>
<p>to do. So kind of an engineering feat, but I put it under</p>
<p>science, and also to not pick the same one as freebird.</p>
<p>Do you think Starship is going to be able to orbit Uranus?</p>
<p>Enough to leave it out there. No, no, no. All of this needs to</p>
<p>stay. All right, biggest flash in the pan, biggest flash in the</p>
<p>pan sacks. You pick people I you told me earlier.</p>
<p>No, I love people, please. Yeah, no, that was yours. I had, I</p>
<p>think the the use of the word transitory was my biggest flash</p>
<p>in the pan. It seemed like for a brief moment that every</p>
<p>administration official, every democratic political consultant,</p>
<p>every talking head on TV kept using the word transitory, it</p>
<p>was very much the vocabulary word of the day. But now, it</p>
<p>turned out that the inflation was not transitory. And so the</p>
<p>use of the word transitory, I predict will in fact be</p>
<p>transitory.</p>
<p>My summary. Like that. What do you got? Chama? I picked all</p>
<p>things metaverse and web.</p>
<p>And web three. Yeah, I did three writ large. If you guys were</p>
<p>around in the emergence of web 2.0. There was, there was a</p>
<p>period when where this gaggle of investors were just clamoring</p>
<p>about web 2.0. None of us understood what it is. And we</p>
<p>were building it, it turned out. Yeah. And so I think that these</p>
<p>trends actually have names, and those names are of companies,</p>
<p>and those companies create experiences that people want.</p>
<p>And so I just think that this whole concept of metaverse and</p>
<p>web three goes away. And we replace it with real solutions</p>
<p>for people that give them value, and then we&rsquo;ll be obsessed with</p>
<p>these companies. And this, this too, will be transitory.</p>
<p>I went with the Constitution Dow. While while I believe</p>
<p>Jason, that the concept was inspiring, and will echo for</p>
<p>quite some time with other, you know, kind of improved versions</p>
<p>and different applications. This particular Dow caused a lot of</p>
<p>people to lose a lot of money in gas fees, transferring tokens</p>
<p>over to cover the expense of the ultimate purchase that was not</p>
<p>actually done, it felt a little disorganized, there was</p>
<p>questions around equity and securities and the legality and</p>
<p>misaligned expectations. And while I get that there was a</p>
<p>good intent, and that folks that were involved in it were felt</p>
<p>like it worked, and it did what it was meant to do, which was to</p>
<p>be inspiring. That particular Dow came and went in three days.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not not not to discredit the concept. And I think that</p>
<p>more will come in the future. But it really was such a loud</p>
<p>moment. And then it went silent. Two days later.</p>
<p>Yep. Okay. And I picked the woke socialist leadership of cities,</p>
<p>specifically the once great city of the once great city of San</p>
<p>Francisco, where they thought they had figured it all out and</p>
<p>that they would be able to run roughshod over the citizens of</p>
<p>their own city. And lo and behold, when an investigative</p>
<p>journalist was hired by myself, and Gary Tan did the democratic</p>
<p>recall and sack supported the republican recall. Lo and</p>
<p>behold, London breed has decided that she does not want to get</p>
<p>recalled. And she is fed up with the bullshit in San Francisco,</p>
<p>and Chesa Boudin and all of these whack jobs are all going</p>
<p>to get voted out and recalled. And we&rsquo;ve seen it and it came up</p>
<p>earlier in the program. So I&rsquo;m to beat a dead horse. But these</p>
<p>failed policies of letting people run amok and not having</p>
<p>some base level of protection and not listening to your</p>
<p>citizens belong in a textbook. And in a preschool, you could</p>
<p>talk about them in graduate school. Yes. This is great for a</p>
<p>college dorm to talk about what would life be like as a</p>
<p>communist as a socialist in the real world. People want to be</p>
<p>safe when they take their kids to fucking school, period, end</p>
<p>of story. And if people don&rsquo;t feel safe, you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>get reelected game over. I also think that people have a</p>
<p>reasonable right to have their kids educated, not managed to</p>
<p>some watered down lowest common denominator. So as to not so as</p>
<p>to try to make everybody around them feel better. Yeah, 100%.</p>
<p>All right. I have a feeling that we&rsquo;re going to this is going to</p>
<p>sweep here best CEO. Should we just say 321 and say the name?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go first. I&rsquo;m going to pick Satya Nadella. Oh, well done.</p>
<p>And the reason I say that is that, you know, he if you look</p>
<p>at this track record, and I thought this business could not</p>
<p>get any bigger, but it just is a compounding absolute juggernaut</p>
<p>in a machine. He has completely turned that company around. And</p>
<p>from, you know, big chunky acquisitions, he&rsquo;s unafraid to</p>
<p>pull the trigger and rip the money in LinkedIn, GitHub, this</p>
<p>year, he did nuance. The product portfolio, he you know, we had</p>
<p>to compete with him at Slack when he was, you know, he</p>
<p>decided to turn the the sites on on with teams on to us, we had</p>
<p>no choice but to basically sell to Salesforce. This guy is a</p>
<p>master executor, has kept the entire company out of the press,</p>
<p>has had the least amount of pushback around their growth and</p>
<p>expansion, the least amount of lawsuits, the least amount of</p>
<p>bad PR. So just in terms of a, you know, first class CEO, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great. He&rsquo;s running a masterclass, crushed it,</p>
<p>crushed, crushed, crushed scale. Totally. What can Brown do for</p>
<p>you? That was a UPS logo. And it&rsquo;s now it&rsquo;s now what the</p>
<p>shareholders of Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Twitter,</p>
<p>Palo Alto networks, Adobe have said,</p>
<p>Okay, I can probably do for you. Okay. So much for the curry</p>
<p>ceiling. Okay, free. We have smashed through the curry</p>
<p>ceiling. Absolutely. There&rsquo;s curry. I&rsquo;ve penetrated the</p>
<p>samosa ceiling. There we go. Free broke. We got making me</p>
<p>hungry. I know. I&rsquo;m having crab curry tonight. Can you believe</p>
<p>it? I went fishing. I told you guys this. I went bleep out the</p>
<p>name. I went fishing, fishing. And we caught some crabs. And so</p>
<p>in the Bay of San Francisco Bay, yeah. Oh, did you go up to like</p>
<p>Chrissy field? And no, we go, we go to the pier. And then they</p>
<p>take us out past Golden Gate Bridge to point Reyes. We caught</p>
<p>rockfish, which we ate yesterday. Delicious. This is on</p>
<p>a boat. You did it on a boat. Yeah. Oh, great, great captain.</p>
<p>Awesome. Yeah, it&rsquo;s cool. I would take London. My 12 year</p>
<p>old crabbing when I lived in San Francisco off of Chrissy field</p>
<p>and we bring crabs home and all that. You can get these</p>
<p>incredible. You can get a one day sport license from the state</p>
<p>of California. It&rsquo;s good for 10 fish and 10 crab. It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>All right. So who do you got? freeberg? best CEO? Well, I</p>
<p>like I like the jack and Elon going direct experience this</p>
<p>year. And what I mean by that is it&rsquo;s less about like how well</p>
<p>did the business performed? I mean, so many tech company CEOs</p>
<p>have performed so well this year, it&rsquo;s hard to pick someone</p>
<p>for driving business outcomes. But what I liked about jack and</p>
<p>Elon jack in particular in the last day is, you know, having a</p>
<p>voice and going direct and being inspiring. I think that</p>
<p>leadership is all about defining where you&rsquo;re headed, and then</p>
<p>creating religion in the troops to follow you to go there. And I</p>
<p>think the way that both of these folks speak directly to people</p>
<p>and the way that they speak authentically, and that they</p>
<p>tell a big story about where they believe the world should</p>
<p>go, and why you should follow them to get there, you know,</p>
<p>creates a model that a lot of other CEOs, I think, should and</p>
<p>will start to follow. And I think we&rsquo;ll see a lot more of</p>
<p>this kind of like Twitter going direct type of activity</p>
<p>happening in the in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Saks, what do you got? Best CEO?</p>
<p>I have Brian Armstrong, because it was about this time ago that</p>
<p>he drew a line in the sand and said that he was not going to</p>
<p>allow politics in the workplace, it was going to be a</p>
<p>demilitarized zone for politics. It was pulling people off</p>
<p>mission. And a year later, he gave us an update, it&rsquo;s been the</p>
<p>best thing they ever did. They gave a generous severance</p>
<p>package to anyone who didn&rsquo;t go along with it was only 5% took</p>
<p>it, they then went on to have a very successful IPO. It&rsquo;s now a</p>
<p>$65 billion public company. And a year later, they are more</p>
<p>mission focused, they&rsquo;ve attracted more employees, their</p>
<p>diversity numbers have not gone down. And the reason I picked</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m picking him is not just because of the business success.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a lot of CEOs. In fact, I&rsquo;d say most</p>
<p>CEOs, including some of the bigger names, that we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>kind of talking about, are secretly would love to do what</p>
<p>Brian did, they would love to basically ban politics in the</p>
<p>workplace. But for whatever reason, they just don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>cojones to do it. I applaud Brian for taking the hit of the</p>
<p>New York Times hit piece that then came after him. And to</p>
<p>stick to his guns, he did this policy. And I think Coinbase had</p>
<p>a great year. Amazing choice. Wow. three great choices. Satya</p>
<p>jack Armstrong, I think Ilana clearly is but I&rsquo;m going to pick</p>
<p>somebody else. So it&rsquo;s not all Ilana all the time. I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>go with Frank Slootman from snowflake. This company has</p>
<p>grown incredibly at a incredible velocity, but I just read his</p>
<p>book. I got a pre order of his book pre pre release of his book</p>
<p>called amp it up. And I had him on this week in startups, which</p>
<p>will come out in the new year when the book comes out. And</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a killer. He absolutely like a killer. He seems like an</p>
<p>absolute killer. And the book basically is I do not care</p>
<p>about how you think business works. Here&rsquo;s the zero sum game</p>
<p>of competitive business. And here&rsquo;s 205 pages. It&rsquo;s a must</p>
<p>read. And he just wants to win. And so my hats off to him $100</p>
<p>billion company. And they&rsquo;ve absolutely crushed it. So best</p>
<p>investor, Chamath, are you gonna pick yourself for the third year</p>
<p>in a row? Or do you have somebody else in mind?</p>
<p>This one, this one, I think is a is an absolutely easy one. But</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my dear friend, Dan Loeb. Oh, founder of CIO. When did</p>
<p>that happen? founder and CIO of third point. And as I&rsquo;ve seen, I</p>
<p>talked to him yesterday, actually, I called him just to</p>
<p>wish him a happy birthday, by the way, it&rsquo;s his birthday.</p>
<p>Ah, happy birthday.</p>
<p>But he has shown the widest range this year. And really put</p>
<p>everything together. Yet again, kind of one of these virtuoso</p>
<p>performances, early stage success. So he was a, you know,</p>
<p>early stage investor, I think they did the series A and</p>
<p>Centel. And one that had a big IPO this year, growth investing,</p>
<p>he, you know, was a was a great investor, early investor in</p>
<p>Rivian, that one public this year. He had great public</p>
<p>performance and upstart and a bunch of other ones. activism,</p>
<p>he went after shell. crypto, I think he&rsquo;s an investor in FTX</p>
<p>and a bunch of other things. I mean, just tundid. And to be</p>
<p>able to put together a team that can execute across all of those</p>
<p>business lines, and risk manage, and then where he still sizes,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m telling you, like, it is so hard to size this stuff</p>
<p>properly and get it right. He did an incredible job. And he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a beautiful, lovely human being. So Dan, all right, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>moving with Ohio, we&rsquo;re moving at a nice pace. I picked the</p>
<p>Sequoia fund, the new evergreen Sequoia and the Sequoia fund,</p>
<p>the new evergreen fund. Obviously, over the past two</p>
<p>years, they&rsquo;ve had door dash Airbnb, Snowflake unity, all</p>
<p>these incredible companies worth over $300 billion combined. And</p>
<p>now those LPS get to keep their money in this one vehicle. And I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s going to make Sequoia even more powerful, great</p>
<p>innovation, shout out to my friend Ruloff. And I gave a</p>
<p>runner up to Brad Gerstner, friend of the pod, who obviously</p>
<p>did Snowflake last year, but had the grab IPO this year, which I</p>
<p>think was the largest back in history. And, you know, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it traded particularly well yet. But congratulations to</p>
<p>Brad as my runner up. Who do you got sex?</p>
<p>Well, my first thought was Nancy Pelosi. But</p>
<p>performance?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think it counts, though, if you do it through</p>
<p>insider trading. So I had to roll her out. Okay, sure. So my</p>
<p>actual choice, my actual choice is Ken Griffin, the founder of</p>
<p>Citadel. He generated something like 10% returns on a $500</p>
<p>billion fund. I mean, just mammoth, mammoth amounts of</p>
<p>money. But it wasn&rsquo;t just as economic, he&rsquo;s obviously a cash</p>
<p>generating machine. But it wasn&rsquo;t just that it was also the</p>
<p>way that he came out on this whole Wall Street bets Robinhood</p>
<p>scandal way back in January. Remember, of the whole payment</p>
<p>for order flow is a gigantic scandal with with Robinhood. And</p>
<p>he, along with Vlad and others was hauled up to Capitol Hill,</p>
<p>but they could not lay a glove on him. He demonstrated, I think</p>
<p>in commanding testimony, that all these conspiracy theories</p>
<p>around his role had no merit. And the populist revolt around</p>
<p>this whole payment for order flow Robinhood thing broke</p>
<p>against the rock of Ken Griffin. He comes out as a huge winner,</p>
<p>both economically and politically.</p>
<p>And you left out the most important part. He was the</p>
<p>supervillain in buying the Constitution down. Yeah. And he</p>
<p>got revenge. One extra dollar. Yes. He got he got revenge on</p>
<p>the crypto people. That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. Great, great financial troll. freeberg. Do</p>
<p>we get yours yet best investor of 2021?</p>
<p>I kind of stuck to private markets just because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>illiquid, which means it&rsquo;s harder to source. Not everyone</p>
<p>has the same data. We all have different data and different</p>
<p>points of view. So within that, I kind of said, Look, what makes</p>
<p>the best investor and number one is obviously good returns, you</p>
<p>know, who&rsquo;s got the best returns, but second is how</p>
<p>scalable is your investing machine? And third is how</p>
<p>durable is it? Like does it get worse as you scale? I know</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going with this. So you know, I had three kind of</p>
<p>finalists. One was founders fund. And I would argue they</p>
<p>probably have the best consistent returns in terms of</p>
<p>the multiples on their funds. Tiger Global, which we talked</p>
<p>about earlier, which I would argue is the most scalable and</p>
<p>durable, as we&rsquo;ve seen deploying 15 billion this year.</p>
<p>And then finally, Sequoia, which has near the best returns,</p>
<p>scalable and durable with this new transition you talked about</p>
<p>and ultimately Sequoia one out. So that&rsquo;s my, my tree of</p>
<p>success. One of the first times we&rsquo;ve had two of the same in the</p>
<p>voting. This is incredible. Best turnaround. What do you got for</p>
<p>best turnaround? best turnaround,</p>
<p>I picked Ford.</p>
<p>Enormous performance. This year, the stocks up 130 odd percent.</p>
<p>Good portfolio mix of, you know, gas guzzling cars that still</p>
<p>make a ton of money like the Ford F 150s. But, you know, they</p>
<p>have the Mustang, they have electric versions of the Ford F</p>
<p>150s. They had some great investments, I think they</p>
<p>printed like a $20 billion gain on Rivian. So it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>really, really good turnaround from what that company was,</p>
<p>which was if you&rsquo;ve talked any car company that that could have</p>
<p>been up 132% at the beginning of 2021, it would not have been</p>
<p>Ford. So well done by that team.</p>
<p>Who do you have sex? Are you an investor in Fortuna?</p>
<p>No, no. So I went a little different for this. I said the</p>
<p>best turnaround was Kyle Rittenhouse his reputation. As</p>
<p>you recall, Rittenhouse shot three white attackers, including</p>
<p>two of them were sex offenders at a violent BLM protest in</p>
<p>Kenosha. The media then painted him without any evidence as a</p>
<p>white supremacist terrorist who went there looking to shoot</p>
<p>people like some sort of frustrated school shooter. It</p>
<p>turned out not to be true. There was clear video evidence at the</p>
<p>scene that he acted in self defense. Once there was a jury</p>
<p>trial. All this came out he was acquitted on all charges and the</p>
<p>prosecution was revealed to be politically motivated. I would</p>
<p>say that Rittenhouse now has his freedom and he has a reputation</p>
<p>back in the eyes of all fair observers.</p>
<p>Who do you got freeberg?</p>
<p>Well, I went from who was in the worst shape and came back from</p>
<p>that. And I put WeWork on here, which is an obvious and easy</p>
<p>choice. WeWork to me is like Rocky Balboa. Rocky Balboa could</p>
<p>not win the match. Rocky Balboa got so beat up, goes to his</p>
<p>corner. He gets patched up. He&rsquo;s bleeding from his eyes, bleeding</p>
<p>from his nose. He&rsquo;s literally about to die. His coach gives</p>
<p>him a little smack on the butt and says, get back out there. And</p>
<p>he keeps going. He&rsquo;s not going to win the match. But man, for</p>
<p>WeWork to go from where it was a few years ago, which was days or</p>
<p>weeks away from bankruptcy, billions of dollars of money</p>
<p>injected by SoftBank, and for them to orchestrate, basically</p>
<p>this whole, you know, juggernaut into what looks like a business</p>
<p>now, and get it public via SPAC. And it now has enough capital</p>
<p>and a good game plan. And it looks like maybe a normal, you</p>
<p>know, challenge technology business was really quite a</p>
<p>turnaround. There was no one to sell this thing to they had to</p>
<p>get in there. And they had to rework this whole thing. And</p>
<p>they reworked WeWork and Rocky Balboa is going to make it to</p>
<p>the 10th round. He may not win the match, but you know, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still in it. It was pretty, pretty impressive to see them</p>
<p>get it out this year.</p>
<p>All right, listen, I struggle with this one. I had two</p>
<p>companies that I really wanted to highlight for two different</p>
<p>reasons. One was Twitter, which had no product velocity. And</p>
<p>people thought I&rsquo;m taking out financial performance right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just looking at the product itself. And my Lord, have they</p>
<p>increased their product velocity releasing newsletters, audio</p>
<p>spaces, and countless other features. And so I like them.</p>
<p>But I actually think Disney, which was and it hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>performed well this year, but they had 44 million subs. They</p>
<p>added 44 million paid subs this year. And people thought theme</p>
<p>parks would be a problem, etc. And I think they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have an absolute killer future. If Apple had not, if it hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been for antitrust right now, I think Apple will be looking at</p>
<p>buying Disney if they had any way to get it through there,</p>
<p>because the journey</p>
<p>what do they turn around exactly like turnaround means it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crappy. And then it&rsquo;s not crappy.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t do stock price. But I think they had a major</p>
<p>threat and a major question of could they actually create their</p>
<p>own streaming platform? Would it work? And getting out of the</p>
<p>pandemic? Could the parks rebound, the parks have</p>
<p>rebounded, I see, I think they&rsquo;re going to roll over</p>
<p>Netflix. So the sentiment was like, God, the stock, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. And they&rsquo;ve really, I think, turned it around.</p>
<p>Yeah, the stock&rsquo;s been a dog this year. But yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I said, like, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to pick it. But I</p>
<p>do think like, if you look at the fundamentals of the</p>
<p>business, Twitter is going to go to 300 million,</p>
<p>because they announced so much content from the Star Wars,</p>
<p>Marvel, Pixar, Disney ecosystem, that is coming this year and</p>
<p>next year. And it&rsquo;s going from Book of Boba Fett, Mandalorian,</p>
<p>Obi Wan Kenobi, where, you know, Hayden Christensen, and the guy</p>
<p>who played Obi Wan Kenobi are coming back like this library is</p>
<p>going to have a ridiculous 2022.</p>
<p>I like HBO Max more than Disney Plus. I mean, my kids watch a</p>
<p>little Disney Plus, but they watch all the other streaming</p>
<p>services to Disney Plus doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a monopoly for me.</p>
<p>HBO Max is such a depth of content right now, when that</p>
<p>water media deal gets done. I think that&rsquo;s the juggernaut</p>
<p>stock you want to own. It&rsquo;s gonna have an incredible library</p>
<p>to compete with Disney.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, secession. And just a library, man. They&rsquo;ve so</p>
<p>much in there. They&rsquo;re releasing a soprano releasing the Matrix</p>
<p>tomorrow on HBO Plus, like HBO Max, they redid the Justice</p>
<p>League. And the new the new the new matrix comes out on</p>
<p>HBO Max tomorrow, day and date.</p>
<p>They love that because I love that they did that with Dune. I</p>
<p>love Dune. Totally. Yeah. Dune is an incredible movie. I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>my movie theater right now. So I&rsquo;m gonna watch it on movie</p>
<p>theater this week. Okay, worst human being I&rsquo;m gonna go first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say Elizabeth Warren. I think trying to raise money</p>
<p>off of the back of the person who raised the most money for</p>
<p>our taxes from taxes. It&rsquo;s just lame. If you haven&rsquo;t seen she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>attacking. Elon and Bezos in Facebook ads trying to grift to</p>
<p>get $10 while she&rsquo;s got 12 million equities that she paid</p>
<p>like $0 on because that&rsquo;s how the tax system that she has</p>
<p>operated under for decades works. Worst human being to me</p>
<p>Elizabeth Warren,</p>
<p>I am going to pick Travis McMichael, Gregory McMichael,</p>
<p>William roadie, Brian, Roddy, Brian, and Derek Chauvin, four</p>
<p>white men who killed in two different incidents, an unarmed</p>
<p>black man, they are scumbags, and they should go to jail and</p>
<p>they will for the rest of their lives. They are terrible human</p>
<p>beings. Great job. Saks we got for worst.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve got a name here. I don&rsquo;t know if the audience knows</p>
<p>yet. It&rsquo;s a guy named Peter Daszak, who&rsquo;s a British</p>
<p>zoologist. He&rsquo;s head of a group called the EcoHealth Alliance</p>
<p>that received millions of dollars in NIH grants for gain</p>
<p>of function research in bat viruses. If that sounds</p>
<p>familiar, it&rsquo;s because some of that was given to the lab in</p>
<p>Wuhan from which COVID likely leaked. But that by itself is</p>
<p>not the reason why he&rsquo;s my choice. He then became one of</p>
<p>the leading signers and organizers of a letter that was</p>
<p>published in the Lancet in February of 2020, insisting with</p>
<p>total certainty that the virus had made the leap from animals</p>
<p>and humans rather than being rather than leaking from a lab.</p>
<p>In fact, he basically painted anyone who had put forward the</p>
<p>lab leak theory as a conspiracy theorist. He you know, his</p>
<p>influence made this so called zoonotic theory, the official</p>
<p>narrative that cannot be questioned online for well over</p>
<p>a year, all the social networks and censored on that basis. And</p>
<p>he never disclosed his obvious conflict of interest given that</p>
<p>his millions of research was threatened if the lab leak three</p>
<p>were proven right. So this, you know, this guy not only helped</p>
<p>unleash a plague upon the world, he then lied about it to</p>
<p>cover his ass and protect his millions. That makes him the</p>
<p>worst in my view.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re interested in hearing a point of view on this. Jamie</p>
<p>Metzl did an interview with Lex Friedman on Lex&rsquo;s podcast, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth listening to it&rsquo;s five hours long. But the the section</p>
<p>where they talk about what sex is sharing, I think is around the</p>
<p>one hour mark. And it&rsquo;s a really interesting narrative that Jamie</p>
<p>shares about what this individual did during this</p>
<p>period of time and why</p>
<p>does it support what I&rsquo;m saying? Yes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not gonna listen, but now he feels smug with himself.</p>
<p>Lex, it&rsquo;s a genius.</p>
<p>Yeah, Lex is great. So my source for this has been the reporting</p>
<p>of Glenn Greenwald, who did some pretty good research on a great</p>
<p>I mean, sort of expose on the conflict of interest that was</p>
<p>never disclosed. And it was on this basis that all the social</p>
<p>networking sites then engaged in censorship. So just a whole,</p>
<p>you know, cluster of bad motives by, you know, people looking to</p>
<p>cover their ass.</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s worth hearing Jamie&rsquo;s point of view on this,</p>
<p>which is he tries to identify the motivation and the</p>
<p>incentives that those people had when they made those cover up</p>
<p>decisions along the way. And I think it&rsquo;s really worth everyone</p>
<p>taking that in. That&rsquo;s what I really liked about Lex&rsquo;s</p>
<p>podcast interview with Jamie was, you know, none of these</p>
<p>things come from a place of pure evil. They come from a</p>
<p>place of incentive and motivation where these</p>
<p>individuals think that they&rsquo;re doing the right thing for some</p>
<p>reason. And, and that&rsquo;s what motivated their behavior. But</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also why and just to jump the gun here, I am not giving</p>
<p>you a worst human being answer. Not a virtue signal. Really, I</p>
<p>just go back to this point that I don&rsquo;t think humans are, you</p>
<p>know, intrinsically evil. I think that a lot of people make</p>
<p>decisions for what they consider to be good reasons or the right</p>
<p>reasons or reasons that are in their mind altruistic, but</p>
<p>ultimately have adverse consequences for another</p>
<p>population.</p>
<p>Not not Derek.</p>
<p>Yeah. I would argue that in some cases, people who are selfish</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make it very far in life. And so they generally don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that much of an impact in an evil way. It&rsquo;s very few people</p>
<p>that are purely selfish and make it to scale. But anyway, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my very esoteric</p>
<p>I think Freeburg raised a good point, which is I think we can</p>
<p>judge this not by people&rsquo;s internal motivations, because we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really know, but rather by the consequences of the outcome,</p>
<p>right? Yeah, the adverse consequences.</p>
<p>Okay. So best meme, I&rsquo;ll go first. I love Daniel Craig&rsquo;s The</p>
<p>Weekend, because I&rsquo;ve been so exhausted from this year, that</p>
<p>when Friday rolls around, that&rsquo;s all I can think about is Daniel</p>
<p>Craig saying, Ladies and gentlemen, for weekend, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just exacerbated and exhausted as am I, my runner up was</p>
<p>Anakin and Padme doing their conversation. You know, for the</p>
<p>better, right. And you can look that up online. It&rsquo;s a for pain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those for pain conversation ones. What do you</p>
<p>got your mouth? You have any best memes?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Bernie Sanders inauguration outfit. Amazing.</p>
<p>Always a great go to his little his little mittens. And you</p>
<p>know, he&rsquo;s totally attached. He&rsquo;s detached communist glare.</p>
<p>About that great meme.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s at a sit in at like, some college in Vermont,</p>
<p>in Russia in the wintertime. Exactly. Exactly. Like a little</p>
<p>chipmunk. Yeah. All right. Who do you got sacks? You got a best</p>
<p>meme,</p>
<p>the ever given forklift meme. This was that little forklift</p>
<p>trying to push that gigantic barge out of the canal. And got</p>
<p>hilariously repurposed. And then</p>
<p>like 10 years ago,</p>
<p>I know this year, can you believe it? And a close runner</p>
<p>up was my fall plans versus the Delta variant. Oh, you remember</p>
<p>that one? That was a great one. That was a good one.</p>
<p>Freeberg. Yeah, I know you don&rsquo;t care about pop culture or</p>
<p>consume much of it. But give us your best meme.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t have a meme. Sorry, not have a meme upgrade. I have</p>
<p>no sense of I like to know the good one. I&rsquo;ll take that one.</p>
<p>Enjoy your memes, but not enough. Okay, can we upgrade</p>
<p>his meme subroutine? I love pop culture. This the mean thing. I</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t resonate for me. It just doesn&rsquo;t pop</p>
<p>culture. I am a fan of pop culture. But the memes do not</p>
<p>make sense to me. Chop boys were great. I have trouble processing</p>
<p>imagery and text all at the same time. My subroutine is indexing</p>
<p>all images and GPT three. I&rsquo;m going to produce funny jokes.</p>
<p>My laughing subroutine has been upgraded.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha ha. Sorry, it&rsquo;s too easy. Sorry, Allison. Most</p>
<p>lonesome company live with them. Most most. I don&rsquo;t think she</p>
<p>listens to this, by the way. My wife doesn&rsquo;t listen to it. I was</p>
<p>talking to my wife about sweater care or whatever. She&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>what are you talking about? I&rsquo;m like, the pod that everybody</p>
<p>listens to. None of our wives listen to this crap. Number 40</p>
<p>in the world. No. Okay, most lonesome company. This one is an</p>
<p>absolutely easy one slam dunk. It is PG&amp;E who this year was</p>
<p>charged with felonies and manslaughter in the death of</p>
<p>four people because of the wildfires that they started</p>
<p>because of their inability to maintain their power</p>
<p>infrastructure throughout the state of California. Very rare</p>
<p>that a for profit corporation gets charged with felony murder</p>
<p>and manslaughter. So I think that&rsquo;s pretty easy one. What do</p>
<p>you got freeberg? I think one day the human race will look</p>
<p>back and identify animal agriculture as worse than human</p>
<p>slavery. I do think that that will be a profound realization</p>
<p>over the next century for our species. And you say worse than</p>
<p>human slavery. I believe that that&rsquo;s what we will realize</p>
<p>because the the scale of death caused by animal agriculture.</p>
<p>Okay. Oh, I understand how you&rsquo;re saying the birth to death</p>
<p>cycle that these animals live in, in cages, with no ability to</p>
<p>touch or interact with their families, the the hurt, the pain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extraordinary. And part of my work that I do day to day is</p>
<p>to figure out ways that we can use science to replace animal</p>
<p>agriculture. So the penultimate kind of animal agriculture</p>
<p>processor in the US is Tyson Foods, they are the most lonesome</p>
<p>company to me. And I stick by my my answer.</p>
<p>Can I can I give you a counterpoint?</p>
<p>Yeah. But it&rsquo;s delicious. It&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not cool.</p>
<p>spicy take, I mean, to the human suffering of slavery, and then</p>
<p>equate it, but you added, I mean, honestly, freeberg, like</p>
<p>if you have it, look, you haven&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ve never eaten any</p>
<p>form of animal protein. So how do you know what you&rsquo;re missing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true, but he does know about cruelty.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess I&rsquo;m just saying there&rsquo;s any winners in this</p>
<p>conversation at this point.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a longer pod. We could do this another time.</p>
<p>Fried chicken is really delicious. Oh, man. So is a</p>
<p>good steak.</p>
<p>Okay, we got to stop. I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>
<p>Saks, did you have a besides Tyson Foods? What do you got?</p>
<p>Okay, most</p>
<p>of the first entering you and putting a label on?</p>
<p>No, no, no. So some company I had the New York Times, a new</p>
<p>year in 2021, called the Gray Lady winked. The author Ashley</p>
<p>rinseburg details decades of misinformation and agenda driven</p>
<p>journalism published by the times starting in the 1930s at a</p>
<p>Nazi sympathizer. As their German correspondent, they</p>
<p>covered up Stalin&rsquo;s genocide in Ukraine, they assisted Fidel</p>
<p>Castro&rsquo;s rise to power in Cuba, they lied us into Vietnam and</p>
<p>Iraq. They and they perpetuated the Russian collusion hoax. More</p>
<p>recently, the New York Times has gone all in on woke</p>
<p>journalism and cancel culture, purging anyone from its ranks</p>
<p>who commits a transgression against woke sensibilities. From</p>
<p>Brian Armstrong to Kyle Rittenhouse, they&rsquo;ve routinely</p>
<p>smeared people as racist with no evidence to back it up. Remember,</p>
<p>they are not a nonprofit, they are a corporation and they have</p>
<p>an agenda. New York Times most lonesome company in my</p>
<p>head, David, can I double down on this? I posted Nick, maybe</p>
<p>you can find this. But there was a there was an article in the</p>
<p>Washington Post that I put into the group chat where the</p>
<p>Washington Post article was effectively like Washington</p>
<p>Post forced to revisit journalism practices because of</p>
<p>falling click through rates and lack of viewership. So in a post</p>
<p>Trump era, Trump, yeah, yeah, post Trump era, two years on,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re the number of premium subscribers</p>
<p>that WAPO has, has pretty materially changed, I guess. And</p>
<p>so, you know, they&rsquo;re revisiting what they&rsquo;re trying to write.</p>
<p>And as you can imagine, they&rsquo;re going to air towards more</p>
<p>clickbait. And it&rsquo;s the same for the times. And so, you know, to</p>
<p>your point, we have to remember that these things are not run as</p>
<p>public trusts. They&rsquo;re run as for profit businesses. Yep.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen what other for profit businesses do as it relates to</p>
<p>information and misinformation and disinformation. And so you</p>
<p>have to heavily discount what you read in these places</p>
<p>information after profits trust. And this is why tech leaders and</p>
<p>other people are increasingly going direct as we talked about</p>
<p>all year in the pod, go direct, they are not the paper of record</p>
<p>anymore. Direct is the new the internet paper of record. I mean,</p>
<p>look at this podcast. I mean, I think like we&rsquo;re going direct,</p>
<p>we get more views on this than any other press hit we could ever</p>
<p>do. And we get to try.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve probably eclipsed MSNBC any show that and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably going to pass CNBC and Fox by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Sure. So for me, I would pick the MyPillow guy, but that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a real company. So I just picked meta, which is just so obvious.</p>
<p>I just think</p>
<p>bro, you have these themes, you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re so after</p>
<p>Facebook, you&rsquo;re super tilted about Facebook, you&rsquo;re super</p>
<p>tilted about Senator Karen. Yes, they just keep cropping up in</p>
<p>every category.</p>
<p>I just it&rsquo;s hard for me not to pick meta here. Best New Tech</p>
<p>for me, it&rsquo;s dows. I mentioned it earlier. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phenomenal. I think that they&rsquo;re going to evolve and global</p>
<p>formation. What do you think it is?</p>
<p>dows? No, they&rsquo;re what? global capital formation are</p>
<p>phenomenal. They&rsquo;re phenomenal. I said phenomenal. All right,</p>
<p>stop making fun of the kid from Brooklyn. Okay. Do you think</p>
<p>this podcast we number 40 if I didn&rsquo;t? Okay, enough, enough.</p>
<p>You ungrateful prick. Listen to me now I&rsquo;m trying to get the</p>
<p>show over with 75 minutes in. Okay, so I say dows because I</p>
<p>believe that they will become legal and global capital</p>
<p>formation for the first time on an instant basis will exist. And</p>
<p>I believe 40 million is the dry run for the Constitution 400</p>
<p>million and 4 billion will happen in the next 10 years to</p>
<p>do bigger and bigger challenges the world wants to bet as a unit</p>
<p>together and this is going to be the crowning achievement of web</p>
<p>three dows. What&rsquo;s the best new tech for you, Mr. Polly hop</p>
<p>into you. I have two choices. Okay, one is in the heavens. And</p>
<p>that is human space travel. Okay, we had three different</p>
<p>companies create astronauts this year. Three amazing. That&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>insanity. Mind. So that it&rsquo;s mind blowing. And so if you</p>
<p>think about what the next five to 10 years can bring Jason at</p>
<p>what you said earlier, but, you know, making ourselves a</p>
<p>multi planetary species, what an inspiring thing that these</p>
<p>thousands of employees across these three businesses did. Huge</p>
<p>congrats to all three of them. I found it really inspiring. So I</p>
<p>think human space travel, and then the second which is much</p>
<p>more closer to earth is sub stack, I think really got to a</p>
<p>level of scale this year. That is really profound. I have found</p>
<p>it to be an incredible way to stay connected to the truth. And</p>
<p>there are some unbelievable people who are now able to</p>
<p>create a life for themselves by telling the truth. independent</p>
<p>voices. Yeah. And, and you can support them directly.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>You know, a handful of people, Matt, I be Barry Weiss, Eric</p>
<p>newcomer, just a handful that jump off the top Glenn</p>
<p>Greenwald. But there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s many more. sub stacks going to</p>
<p>learn how to promote these things to you in a better way,</p>
<p>I think over time. But I think that is incredible, you</p>
<p>eventually come off, there&rsquo;ll be some sort of group subscription.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll be able to put Glenn Greenwald and Barry Weiss</p>
<p>and have multiple publishers come in like an aggregated feed</p>
<p>or something to that effect. In other words, you can subscribe</p>
<p>to the New York Times of these independent voices, and they</p>
<p>would split the money across them. It&rsquo;s the closest thing to</p>
<p>truth as a service that we have. And with pot, I&rsquo;d say podcast is</p>
<p>right up there to sacks. I&rsquo;m obviously you&rsquo;re gonna pick</p>
<p>Colin, but after calling what he got for the best.</p>
<p>You know, I originally had the the CRISPR gene or anything, but</p>
<p>you mentioned that. So I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna go with Starlink. It</p>
<p>got Yes, it it just came out at the end of 2020. But this year,</p>
<p>it kept getting better and faster. And now it&rsquo;s reported</p>
<p>that Starlink is faster than the fixed broadband average in</p>
<p>Belgium, Canada, Australia, Germany, the UK, New Zealand and</p>
<p>France. Come on. No way. Really? Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>unbelievable. Wow. Evan Baker just tweeted this earlier today</p>
<p>this morning. That&rsquo;s all I can say all I can say for all of us</p>
<p>who own yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. That&rsquo;s so delicious. Okay, my</p>
<p>best new technology. I think the 2021 was the year of plasma</p>
<p>fusion. There were several iterations and step function</p>
<p>improvements in plasma. Explain what it is to people who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. The concept ultimately for plasma fusion is that you can</p>
<p>generate a controlled nuclear series of nuclear reactions</p>
<p>where energy is released. And as these atoms transform and energy</p>
<p>is released, rather than have a runaway breakthrough effect,</p>
<p>which you would have in a nuclear bomb, for example, you</p>
<p>can actually control it and harness the energy that comes</p>
<p>out. And there are several technologies and techniques that</p>
<p>have been theorized for 50 years that we could do this in a way</p>
<p>that the energy that we put in to create and start the fusion</p>
<p>reaction allows us to get more energy out. And therefore, you</p>
<p>have a net energy crater just by turning atoms into energy in a</p>
<p>way that doesn&rsquo;t cause a runaway breakthrough nuclear reaction</p>
<p>that would be the equivalent of a nuclear bomb. And so, you know,</p>
<p>the MIT CFS collaboration had an excellent breakthrough that we</p>
<p>spoke about on one of our pods, the National Ignition Facility,</p>
<p>which is actually a US DOE funded facility came very close</p>
<p>to energy abundance. And they have a wonderful chart that</p>
<p>shows 20 years of doing this work. And then this year, it</p>
<p>suddenly balloons. And is that how they make energy on the sun?</p>
<p>This one is so so all of this is fusion. That&rsquo;s correct. But</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s how they make energy on the sun. Well, what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing here is, we&rsquo;re basically using lasers to create</p>
<p>the same density that you would get on the sun that triggers</p>
<p>that same sort of nuclear. And what about Uranus?</p>
<p>Different. It&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Bill never stops being funny.</p>
<p>General Fusion had a big breakthrough. And Bill Gates is</p>
<p>a big backer of a company called Terra Power that announced</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re building a new reactor. But I think generally</p>
<p>speaking, we are seeing 2021 is kind of that big step change</p>
<p>where this stuff is starting to move from theory.</p>
<p>When will we have it online?</p>
<p>Still, as everyone&rsquo;s been saying for decades, 10 years. So every</p>
<p>year, every 10 years, we say 10 years.</p>
<p>Best trend, worst trend. Here we go. I&rsquo;m going to go with the</p>
<p>best trend being centrism, purple pills, recalls of DAs,</p>
<p>reasonableness, and maybe the the political class actually</p>
<p>representing what most of the country wants, which is a high</p>
<p>functioning government that gets the hell out of the way. What do</p>
<p>you got sex</p>
<p>best trend hashtag woke lash. We saw this is similar to yours. We</p>
<p>saw a major pushback against woke ideology on several fronts</p>
<p>this year. First, you had parents pushing back on CRT,</p>
<p>leading to a Republican sweep in deep blue Virginia. Then the</p>
<p>whole defund the police initiative was rejected on the</p>
<p>ballot of Minneapolis where it all started. Even the mayor of</p>
<p>San Francisco now wants to refund the police. The attempt</p>
<p>to cancel Dave Chappelle totally fizzled out after the walkout</p>
<p>protests on Netflix. And even Barack Obama told the progressive</p>
<p>left to quote get over their woke purity earlier this year,</p>
<p>they should have listened to him and maybe they finally will next</p>
<p>year after losing more elections.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just repeat something I said earlier, I&rsquo;ll be quick</p>
<p>about it, the creator economy blossoming new models for</p>
<p>monetization for folks that create content, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>video, art, music, and, you know, there&rsquo;s all these new</p>
<p>models for bringing your art to market your content to market</p>
<p>and getting paid for it. And consumers are clearly willing to</p>
<p>pay for it. So it&rsquo;s awesome to see the gatekeepers are falling</p>
<p>away. And the go direct model is working. What do you got your</p>
<p>mouth? I&rsquo;m going to double tap that. I had the creator economy.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incredible what these young creators are</p>
<p>basically. You know, creating, it&rsquo;s incredible, super, super</p>
<p>novel and new forms of content. Tick tock is super addictive.</p>
<p>Stay out of the comments. YouTube is incredible. So this</p>
<p>is a brave new world for for creators.</p>
<p>All right, so worst trend, the worst trend of 2021. I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to go with giving credit for work that hasn&rsquo;t been done yet.</p>
<p>And just straight up founder and investor entitlement. I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>seen it at all time peak here where people expect to be given</p>
<p>huge rewards before they do the work. And I&rsquo;m very concerned</p>
<p>about the lack of governance, the lack of diligence, and</p>
<p>people believing they should get huge rewards before they</p>
<p>actually do the work. What do you got your mouth?</p>
<p>My worst trend is the decaying of the national security of our</p>
<p>supply chains. If you think about some of the really</p>
<p>important things that we&rsquo;re going to have to get done over</p>
<p>the next 10 years, just climate as an example. China has done a</p>
<p>masterful job, they control, you know, a lot of the lithium, a</p>
<p>lot of the nickel, a lot of the cobalt, a lot of the graphite,</p>
<p>they control a lot of the rare earths that go into the</p>
<p>permanent magnets. And we don&rsquo;t have a solution. So that is a</p>
<p>really bad trend that accelerated. This year, we have</p>
<p>some really ambitious programs in America that are unfortunately</p>
<p>stuck because of, you know, lawsuits, claiming that the, you</p>
<p>know, the wood grouse is more important than batteries. And so</p>
<p>unless we undo that stuff, we&rsquo;re in a bad place.</p>
<p>Okay, sacks, what do you got?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the rise of authoritarianism around the</p>
<p>world. And here in the United States, I mean, even in Western</p>
<p>countries, like Australia, it&rsquo;s basically been turned into a</p>
<p>prison colony for months in the name of stopping COVID. Here in</p>
<p>the United States, you&rsquo;ve got governors like Gavin Newsom,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve basically appropriated dictatorial powers through a</p>
<p>bogus state of emergency. You&rsquo;ve now got the unvaccinated treated</p>
<p>as some sort of untouchable class of citizens who aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>able to leave their house except to buy food and medicine. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>even now in Europe, they&rsquo;re splitting, they&rsquo;re forcing</p>
<p>people behind partitions at the supermarket. Boston just</p>
<p>announced they&rsquo;re banning unvaccinated people from going</p>
<p>to all restaurants, bars, nightclubs, sport arenas, fitness</p>
<p>centers, movie theaters, and on and on it goes. On top of that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got censorship, you&rsquo;ve got, you know, the censoring of</p>
<p>speech, you&rsquo;ve got this sort of crackdown on domestic political</p>
<p>enemies. And I think it&rsquo;s also emboldening authoritarian</p>
<p>regimes like China and Russia to crack down harder on their</p>
<p>citizens, because they see what&rsquo;s happening in the West,</p>
<p>and they think they can get away with it. So all around bad</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>I think to your point, Zack, it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why we</p>
<p>will see people in general looking for alternative ways to</p>
<p>govern themselves. And it will only catalyze and accelerate</p>
<p>some of these other trends that I think we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about. My worst trend was the metaverse. I think it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>renaming of something that&rsquo;s been going on for a long time as</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s some new future thing. If anyone&rsquo;s played Fortnite over</p>
<p>the last six years or five years, you know, the metaverse</p>
<p>has been here for a long time. And this notion that you can</p>
<p>kind of take it and make it something that doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>yet. And it&rsquo;s all about the future and make some stupid</p>
<p>video about it. I think it&rsquo;s a little bit lost in what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>already been going on, which is people find value in digital</p>
<p>goods, people find value in digital levels and badging. And</p>
<p>they find honor and progress in their lives by accomplishing</p>
<p>things in a digital universe. And they&rsquo;ve been doing that from</p>
<p>Minecraft to Fortnite, to other places for a long time. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating to watch. But the notion that we call this thing</p>
<p>the metaverse, and everyone&rsquo;s trying to reclassify it as some</p>
<p>future singular universe, and therefore they can own that</p>
<p>singular universe is a pretty misstated and misguided</p>
<p>kind of concept. Let&rsquo;s go on to your favorite book, movie,</p>
<p>podcast, music discovery of 2021. For music, I had war on</p>
<p>drugs for book, Ray Crocks autobiography I listened to on</p>
<p>audible, and it was great. On TV, secession, curb your</p>
<p>enthusiasm and dope sick were my three favorites. I think</p>
<p>Friedberg, what do you got? Considering that you have had</p>
<p>your pop culture? I will tell you guys on time. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very important that everyone on this pod and anyone listening to</p>
<p>this, that has any interest in what&rsquo;s going on in the world</p>
<p>today, broadly, read Ray Dalio&rsquo;s The Changing World Order, it is</p>
<p>my number one, number two, and number three book</p>
<p>recommendation of the year, it is absolutely critical to</p>
<p>understand that the global world order is being reclassified, as</p>
<p>the United States has taken on too much debt, and will</p>
<p>ultimately lose its reserve currency status, as we have</p>
<p>seen with the transition of five or six empires over the past</p>
<p>500 years. And this transition is very predictable. As Ray</p>
<p>Dalio highlights, we are following a pattern that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen over and over again. And, and we are in a moment right</p>
<p>now, where populism, whether it&rsquo;s authoritarianism on the</p>
<p>right, or socialism on the left, is a reaction to what is</p>
<p>effectively a very small number of people controlling a very</p>
<p>large amount of the wealth and the power in this country and in</p>
<p>the world. And we&rsquo;ve seen this play out. And as governments and</p>
<p>societies evolve, eventually, this happens, there&rsquo;s a massive</p>
<p>revolution typically triggered by some new technology emerging,</p>
<p>like the printing press, the radio shipping. And in our case</p>
<p>today, I would argue what we people are calling web three, or</p>
<p>the blockchain as that that triggering technology. And as</p>
<p>that happens, the current dominant empire transitions, and</p>
<p>a new world order emerges. And this is not some conspiracy</p>
<p>theory. It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s an in depth look at the economic, political</p>
<p>and social organizations that have broken apart over the last</p>
<p>500 years. And where we sit today. It&rsquo;s not about politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just about manifestations of human behavior over time.</p>
<p>Done for that. Everyone&rsquo;s got to read it. My second Oh, I got</p>
<p>one more. Come on. Okay. No, of course. Keep going. Wes</p>
<p>Anderson&rsquo;s The French Dispatch is one of the best films I have</p>
<p>seen in like a decade. Have you guys seen it? No, it is friggin</p>
<p>amazing. I feel like every shot is like a cinematography</p>
<p>masterpiece. The writing is incredible. The acting will blow</p>
<p>your mind. If you guys see that film, we could talk about it for</p>
<p>hours. It is just no political agenda, no nonsense in it. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just pure art. It&rsquo;s really beautiful. Oh, and then on</p>
<p>music, I&rsquo;ll give a shout out to a very unknown artist who I</p>
<p>think deserves a little shout out. His name is DK, the</p>
<p>drummer. DK, the drummer did a collaboration with a guy named</p>
<p>Alejandro Arenda, who was on American Idol. My kids cannot</p>
<p>stop listening to his track that they did together. It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Shout out for that guy just figured he deserves it for</p>
<p>putting out an awesome track.</p>
<p>All right, sax, which Steve Bannon episode was your</p>
<p>favorite.</p>
<p>So under a book of the year, I have a very recent choice, which</p>
<p>is San Francisco by Michael Schellenberger. It just came</p>
<p>out, but it&rsquo;s already I think, very influential. It&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>about San Francisco. It&rsquo;s really about how the so called</p>
<p>progressive agenda in cities is not working. I think it is going</p>
<p>to be the blueprint for a major backlash that&rsquo;s already begun</p>
<p>here in San Francisco with London Breed taking on Jason</p>
<p>Boudin. I think that&rsquo;s going to be a recurring theme next year.</p>
<p>Also, other big cultural discoveries. I like Chamath, I</p>
<p>have Red Pill journalists on Substack, Glenn Greenwald, Matt</p>
<p>Taibbi, Antonio Garcia Martinez, all of whom now have shows on</p>
<p>Collins. So those are my choices.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a second plug. Okay, here we go. Chamath, what was</p>
<p>your favorite app besides Colin?</p>
<p>Exactly. Let&rsquo;s see. So my best album is Planet Her by Doja</p>
<p>Cat. danceable, fun. Kids love it. I love it.</p>
<p>And you dance. Okay.</p>
<p>You know that I have rhythm, bro.</p>
<p>All in summit dance party. Here we go.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, from the from the waist down, as you also know,</p>
<p>but just beep that out, please. No, no, no, you cannot hide from</p>
<p>the truth, boys. Best movie is Dune. It was so beautiful.</p>
<p>Cinematically, just gorgeous. Incredible, incredible,</p>
<p>incredible movie. And then book. I&rsquo;ve said this before. But the</p>
<p>way I think about the world is using these models and</p>
<p>frameworks. One of the most useful models that I have found</p>
<p>is this idea of mimesis or mimetic theory, which is that</p>
<p>people copy each other that causes conflict. It was espoused</p>
<p>by a philosopher named Renee Girard. Myself, Peter Thiel,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of us who are pretty deep. Renee Girard</p>
<p>acolytes. The problem is that his stuff can be a little hard</p>
<p>to penetrate. And so there was a book called wanting w a n t ing</p>
<p>by this author named Luke Burgess. superb book, very easy</p>
<p>to read, very accessible explains this really well. One</p>
<p>of the most useful mental models that I have.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just shout out we didn&rsquo;t have best comedian in</p>
<p>here. But I really enjoyed Hassan Minaj is the king&rsquo;s</p>
<p>jester, a new show that is not yet on streaming, but that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doing live. It was hilarious. It was insightful. He&rsquo;s and really</p>
<p>enjoyed going to it.</p>
<p>Did you like Loki?</p>
<p>I enjoyed it. Yeah, well, what is it? What is what is Loki?</p>
<p>He is a cat. He&rsquo;s Thor&rsquo;s stepbrother. And they did a TV</p>
<p>show called Loki, which was like a very challenging metaverse</p>
<p>multiple timeline kind of concept set the stage for the</p>
<p>whole next wave of Marvel movies. Didn&rsquo;t you think that</p>
<p>was the best Marvel product this year? Or no,</p>
<p>definitely was absolutely 100% Spider Man Homecoming, but I</p>
<p>think it sets in line.</p>
<p>Wait, we haven&rsquo;t heard from Saks. Did we hear from Saks?</p>
<p>Yeah, Saks just picked like some right wing book.</p>
<p>It was like San Francisco or something and TV or whatever. I</p>
<p>mean, Saks, did you? You actually love movies, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>made movies. Did you see a film you loved? Were you just</p>
<p>watching like films from the 90s?</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s hard to find like even one movie that I want to</p>
<p>you know, write home about I think it&rsquo;s a lot easier to find</p>
<p>TV shows like we&rsquo;re enjoying Yellowstone right now. Quite a</p>
<p>bit. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys are watching that Kevin</p>
<p>Costner.</p>
<p>Nobody who&rsquo;s on the left knows what Yellowstone is explain to</p>
<p>people this right wing phenomenon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a Kevin Costner show. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right wing. It&rsquo;s about a ranching like family like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re traditional sort of cowboys who live in Wyoming. And</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s Montana. I&rsquo;m not sure. Anyway, there&rsquo;s all these</p>
<p>people trying to go after them to get their land, mostly</p>
<p>developers. And it&rsquo;s fantastic. They&rsquo;re fighting to preserve</p>
<p>their way of life, which is around, you know, raising cows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Taylor Sheridan, who&rsquo;s the guy who did Sicario, which if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never seen Sicario one and two amazing are the most</p>
<p>amazing thrillers you&rsquo;re ever going to see. I mean, very hard</p>
<p>to watch. They&rsquo;re so intense. And I think Yellowstone now is</p>
<p>the reason I say it&rsquo;s right wing is it&rsquo;s doing incredibly well in</p>
<p>the south, and it&rsquo;s not happening in the coastal cities.</p>
<p>So coastal, it&rsquo;s kind of like a leave me alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much to the republic, the traditional republican slash</p>
<p>American sensibility. Well, they&rsquo;re making it into a</p>
<p>universe. So they did a prequel. And it&rsquo;s just off the charts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most viewership of any program. And most people in San</p>
<p>Francisco, New York and LA don&rsquo;t even know what it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s like has an overt political agenda. I</p>
<p>mean, the family who&rsquo;s the subject of the show, the cost</p>
<p>or character, he&rsquo;s just against progress. He does not want</p>
<p>developers coming in there, building airports, building ski</p>
<p>resorts. He just wants to preserve his way of life, which</p>
<p>is how it&rsquo;s been for 150 years rustling cattle. Can&rsquo;t wait to</p>
<p>see. And I don&rsquo;t know how political that is. But they are</p>
<p>like very tough. I mean, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like Sanford, San</p>
<p>Francisco housing. Yeah. Okay, we&rsquo;re gonna keep up with this</p>
<p>one. This is our Rudy Giuliani award for self emulation.</p>
<p>Basically, people who destroy their legacy in some way, or</p>
<p>otherwise just bungled everything. sacks, I got to go</p>
<p>to you first. I know that you&rsquo;ve got your writing team over at</p>
<p>Fox and has something going on here for this one. Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I went with the Cuomo brothers. You know,</p>
<p>grateful. Yes. So first, you have the governor Andrew Cuomo</p>
<p>member at the beginning of COVID. He was giving these</p>
<p>constant press conferences. There was even talk about on the</p>
<p>part of Democrats replacing Biden with him at the 2020</p>
<p>convention. This inspired the term Cuomo sexuals, who saw him</p>
<p>as a sex symbol. And then he got taken down in August by sexual</p>
<p>harassment allegations. Then, a few weeks later, there&rsquo;s a major</p>
<p>scandal at CNN when it leaked documents from the New York AGs</p>
<p>office showed that his brother Chris Cuomo had used his perch</p>
<p>at, you know, at CNN to dig up dirt on some of his brother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>accusers, then he was suspended and ultimately fired. So both</p>
<p>brothers self immolated within a few months of each other.</p>
<p>And Andrew Cuomo had to return his $5 million book advance for</p>
<p>his COVID book. Freeberg we got who lit themselves on fire. And</p>
<p>well, I was a little general, I kind of said, you know, all</p>
<p>these politicians who made claims about the vaccine not</p>
<p>being worth doing, and then they got COVID. And then on the flip</p>
<p>side of the aisle, all the politicians who said take the</p>
<p>vaccine, or you&rsquo;ll get COVID. And then they took the vaccine</p>
<p>and they still got COVID. So you know, I think again,</p>
<p>credibility, institutional credibility and deterministic</p>
<p>statements like that from both sides, damaged a lot of</p>
<p>reputations. And it&rsquo;s just brutal to watch, you know, from</p>
<p>from one day to the next, from Elizabeth Warren to Rand Paul,</p>
<p>people getting COVID making one claim or another about, you</p>
<p>know, the good or the bad of the vaccine. And at the end of the</p>
<p>day, COVID doesn&rsquo;t care, clearly. So anyway,</p>
<p>what do you got your mouth?</p>
<p>Senator Karen, I think Senator Karen is the obvious choice for</p>
<p>me. Kind of proved that she doesn&rsquo;t really know much about</p>
<p>economics is, you know, kind of mean. And just basically wants</p>
<p>to, you know, is a moral absolutist authoritarian just on</p>
<p>the left.</p>
<p>By the way, I just I&rsquo;ll interject, because I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>passionate about this right now, since I&rsquo;ve read this book. But</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;ll hear you&rsquo;ll see in this book, that this populist</p>
<p>diatribe that you hear from both sides, whether it&rsquo;s the right or</p>
<p>the left comes from a place that&rsquo;s driven by an allocation</p>
<p>of a lot of the resources, capital and influence and power</p>
<p>to a small number of people. And whether it&rsquo;s Senator Karen or</p>
<p>Donald Trump, they ultimately end up being this, you know, the</p>
<p>same characters played by different actors over time. And</p>
<p>the left and the right stand up with authoritarianism and</p>
<p>socialism as the answer, and the whole thing cycles over again.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re in this moment right now. And this sort of stuff that</p>
<p>you guys are talking about Senator Karen and others kind of</p>
<p>saying is only going to get louder. I&rsquo;m convinced.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s interesting, because I think she&rsquo;s overplayed</p>
<p>her hand massively. I mean, she&rsquo;s become so shrill and such</p>
<p>a scold that, you know, she can never win that, you know, that</p>
<p>beer test quite remember that question they asked, they pull</p>
<p>people on about presidential candidates is who do you most</p>
<p>want to have a beer with? You know, that that question</p>
<p>actually is important, because I don&rsquo;t think people want to have</p>
<p>a beer with people who are scolding them or these moral</p>
<p>absolutists, like Jamal said, there is a check there. And so I</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;s, I think what she&rsquo;s done is backfired.</p>
<p>And for me, it was Biden. I mean, what a disappointing</p>
<p>performance. He couldn&rsquo;t control the far left of the party. He</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get anybody on the Republican side to give him but</p>
<p>one vote. He declared independence from COVID in July.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not a perfect science or anything like that.</p>
<p>But I think that this presidency is one and done, obviously to</p>
<p>everybody. And yeah, he was supposed to go right into the</p>
<p>middle. And he has not gone anywhere near the middle or led</p>
<p>from the front either way. All right, here we go. My God,</p>
<p>Jason, how much Fox News have you been watching?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just hanging out with you too much. No, I mean, it is</p>
<p>possible. You know, I really wanted a centrist for president</p>
<p>he presented as such, and then he hasn&rsquo;t done that. And now</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s being forced into centrism, kicking and screaming.</p>
<p>He should just started there. That&rsquo;s where that was the</p>
<p>promise. He should have started there. That&rsquo;s where that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s most comfortable. Anyways, that&rsquo;s who he is. Exactly. Like</p>
<p>what a head fake. And now he winds up there anyway, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be too late. So it&rsquo;s just a disaster. He basically took</p>
<p>victory from the jaws of defeat or took defeat from the jaws of</p>
<p>victory, right? Like just terrible. Okay, here&rsquo;s an award.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re gonna make this but who was your favorite</p>
<p>bestie? So this is you picking up the three other besties.</p>
<p>Freeberg, this is your idea. You want to create this division of</p>
<p>why somebody is your favorite bestie on the show.</p>
<p>I was just trying to give you a shout out for coming to my</p>
<p>party. Okay, you know, while the other besties. So I am your</p>
<p>favorite bestie. No, but you know what, yesterday Chamath</p>
<p>served me crepes with Nutella. So he&rsquo;s my favorite bestie now.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re playing? No, and Saks had an incredible party and you</p>
<p>guys all three. Okay, I&rsquo;ll tell you something. All three of you</p>
<p>guys have been incredibly generous. And I feel fortunate</p>
<p>that I know it&rsquo;s a little soft moment. But thank you guys.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. I have had my chip upgraded. Emotion is complete.</p>
<p>I love you. My voice is cracking. This is in my</p>
<p>programming. But I should keep it together. That tier sub</p>
<p>routine has not been installed. Chamath you want to pick your</p>
<p>favorite bestie and or go around the horn and this is just a bad</p>
<p>idea. No, I love all three of you. Thank you. Yeah. I love all</p>
<p>three of you. But for different reasons. I&rsquo;m really lucky to</p>
<p>have all three of you as friends. Oh, very nice. I am</p>
<p>very lucky to have two of the three of you have planes that I</p>
<p>get to fly on around the world. Second homes that I get to</p>
<p>freeload off of. And freeberg. You know, I just say like, you</p>
<p>know, get as I told your mom freeberg at your wonderful</p>
<p>Christmas party. I said, you know, getting to know your son</p>
<p>has been one of the highlights of the last year and a half for</p>
<p>me. So sincerely, you know, I was good friends with Chamath and</p>
<p>sacks. But you know, you and I knew each other from poker, but</p>
<p>you know, not great friends or super close friends yet. And I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s been one of the highlights for me. And I really</p>
<p>have learned to love and respect your opinions or ethos, your</p>
<p>effort in the world and in a world of people who are</p>
<p>complaining and whining and not doing I just feel so honored to</p>
<p>be able to be the moderator here and spend time with you</p>
<p>every week. I would do this if we threw the episode away every</p>
<p>week. Because it&rsquo;s inspiring for me for the next six days until</p>
<p>we meet again. It really fills my bucket, it recharges my</p>
<p>batteries to to be with folks who just aggressively want to</p>
<p>solve problems in the world.</p>
<p>Where are we taping this next week?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like two or three weeks, we&rsquo;re going to be at the</p>
<p>upfront summit on the second day in LA. I think it&rsquo;s somebody</p>
<p>want to give the date? I think it&rsquo;s January.</p>
<p>Any plans to tape from Uranus?</p>
<p>If we can terraform, it&rsquo;s the 24th to 26. But I think we&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the 26th. The last day in the afternoon, all in podcast, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing it. Mark Schuster invited us and then the all in summit</p>
<p>will be in May. In Miami, we have the dates we&rsquo;re about to</p>
<p>announce. But don&rsquo;t email me for free tickets. There&rsquo;ll be 300</p>
<p>tickets to the summit. 250 of them are paid. And then each</p>
<p>bestie gets 12 tickets to give to a bestie. This is how we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to run it. Everybody has to pay and then everything will</p>
<p>be simulcast. All right, everybody. Let&rsquo;s wrap up.</p>
<p>Saks, I know you&rsquo;re not capable of saying anything emotional,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s give it a shot just for the for the audience.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a real question. This effeminate bullshit that</p>
<p>you guys</p>
<p>what is so brutal? You&rsquo;re such an asshole. What a piece of</p>
<p>an ass.</p>
<p>I will say this this group, a few relationships in particular</p>
<p>had a very rocky year. And so it&rsquo;s Yeah. And so it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>YouTube. That is true. It was not it was not public. What all</p>
<p>that went down? Yeah, but but Chamath and I here we are here.</p>
<p>Chamath and I fought very hard to keep the pod together and to</p>
<p>make sure that you guys and you guys are literally like the two</p>
<p>characters from stepbrothers. And</p>
<p>characters you&rsquo;re talking about in this spot. Yeah. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good. It&rsquo;s good. It&rsquo;s good to see</p>
<p>a idiot who crashed the bunk beds. The one on top. Yeah, he</p>
<p>jumps on top. I mean, I don&rsquo;t even know what movie you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about. What is the two of you you Saxon J Cal found a</p>
<p>way to fight to almost break up to destroy everything we built</p>
<p>together. freebrook and I had to step in not once but on two</p>
<p>different occasions amount of time Chamath and I had to spend</p>
<p>mediating the two of you back together was ridiculous.</p>
<p>The time either. Yeah.</p>
<p>Sax could stay in his lane.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no. Don&rsquo;t start. Don&rsquo;t start. Don&rsquo;t start next</p>
<p>reminding me of something. Yeah. He says he said I got so mad at</p>
<p>Jason this year that I threatened to make Nick a</p>
<p>millionaire out of spite.</p>
<p>Nick, I want to make you a millionaire regardless. I know</p>
<p>your uncle&rsquo;s not going to do it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing great. He&rsquo;s doing great. He&rsquo;s got to take it easy</p>
<p>everybody. No, but people still ask me to this day was that whole</p>
<p>few with Jake how real or was it just for ratings? No, it was</p>
<p>all. It was real. The bigger feud was not the bigger feud was</p>
<p>not aired on the air. And right there was a second few. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>under that one was we signed an NDA. I&rsquo;ll let you say the</p>
<p>operating agreement now. Yeah. It&rsquo;s not easy. You know, success</p>
<p>is hard for a band, you know, and I think one of the things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say about this whole brouhaha and the you know, sax</p>
<p>and I having debates about how to run the pod is I think we</p>
<p>came to the right place. I you know, I look at the comments.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;ve become a better moderator. I think sacks, Jamal</p>
<p>Freeberg, you&rsquo;ve all become great at passing the ball and</p>
<p>showing interest in each other&rsquo;s points. And I feel like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>playing, you know, which is always my wish for this is that,</p>
<p>you know, we play this game as intellectually, honestly, and</p>
<p>crisply, and as well with as much discipline with as much</p>
<p>hard work as like, let&rsquo;s say the Warriors do. And I really feel</p>
<p>like even in the last 10 episodes, we hit a high</p>
<p>watermark in the in the audience, and everybody I meet</p>
<p>tells me the same thing. My god, the guys just do a such a great</p>
<p>job. I&rsquo;ll say one thing. One thing that makes it really hard.</p>
<p>I was I was with Chamath yesterday, as you guys know,</p>
<p>yeah, and secret mission. One thing I observed with Chamath is</p>
<p>no matter how much success or wealth Chamath has accumulated,</p>
<p>he is still a hustler. And I think that is true for all of</p>
<p>us. And individually and independently, we all still</p>
<p>hustle, we try and make things happen, we find things that</p>
<p>others aren&rsquo;t doing, we push hard, grind, we grind, we</p>
<p>grind at 5am to the East Coast for a day. And I think all four</p>
<p>of us in the same are in the same vein. And that makes it</p>
<p>really hard for four personalities like that to work</p>
<p>together in a consistent way. And that underlies a lot of what</p>
<p>I think ultimately bubbles up to the surface with some of the</p>
<p>stuff. But, you know, we should be thankful that we can pull it</p>
<p>off, because it&rsquo;s pretty, pretty awesome.</p>
<p>And can I say something nice about Jekyll? Here we go. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true that without Jekyll, this pod never would have</p>
<p>happened. You are the podcaster in this group, you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>skills, you make the pod very entertaining and funny. And so</p>
<p>like, frankly, even though you&rsquo;re not as rich and smart as</p>
<p>the rest of us, you should stop feeling so insecure because you</p>
<p>really are the reason for this pod.</p>
<p>Alright, listen, let me give a compliment. Saks, you bring so</p>
<p>many great notes to the pod. And you are so eloquent, based on</p>
<p>what your team writes for you, ability to read that script, and</p>
<p>the amount of money you spend forming your opinions from</p>
<p>Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s ex writing team is just extraordinary, bring so</p>
<p>much to the table. I can&rsquo;t believe I ever wanted to replace</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s gonna know who I was threatening to replace Saks with.</p>
<p>It was like literally like, we&rsquo;re gonna replace this</p>
<p>guitarist.</p>
<p>Boys, have a wonderful holiday.</p>
<p>Have a great one. I love you besties. Okay, everybody. We&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see you all next week for 2022 predictions. I promise to you no</p>
<p>weeks off for the besties. I&rsquo;m gonna be with you every Friday</p>
<p>night. Bye bye bye bye</p>
<p>know. Let your winners ride. Rain Man David</p>
<p>we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with</p>
<p>it. Love you.</p>
<p>Besties are</p>
<p>a dog taking a notice your driveway.</p>
<p>Oh man, my</p>
<p>we should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just like this like sexual tension that</p>
<p>they just need to release</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re about to be</p>
<p>waiting to get</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going</p>
