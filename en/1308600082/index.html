    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Charles Zucker.</p>
<p>Dr. Zucker is a professor of biochemistry</p>
<p>and molecular biophysics and of neuroscience</p>
<p>at Columbia University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Dr. Zucker is one of the world&rsquo;s leading experts</p>
<p>in perception.</p>
<p>That is how the nervous system converts physical stimuli</p>
<p>in the world into events within the nervous system</p>
<p>that we come to understand as our sense of smell,</p>
<p>our sense of taste, our sense of vision,</p>
<p>our sense of touch, and our sense of hearing.</p>
<p>Dr. Zucker&rsquo;s lab is responsible</p>
<p>for a tremendous amount of pioneering</p>
<p>and groundbreaking work in the area of perception.</p>
<p>For a long time, his laboratory worked on vision,</p>
<p>defining the very receptors</p>
<p>that allow for the conversion of light</p>
<p>into signals that the rest of the eye</p>
<p>and the brain can understand.</p>
<p>In recent years, his laboratory has focused mainly</p>
<p>on the perception of taste.</p>
<p>And indeed, his laboratory is responsible</p>
<p>for discovering many of the taste receptors</p>
<p>leading to our perception of things like sweetness,</p>
<p>sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami,</p>
<p>that is savoriness in food.</p>
<p>Dr. Zucker&rsquo;s laboratory is also responsible</p>
<p>for doing groundbreaking work on the sense of thirst.</p>
<p>That is how the nervous system determines</p>
<p>whether or not we should ingest more fluid</p>
<p>or reject fluids that are offered to us.</p>
<p>A key feature of the work from Dr. Zucker&rsquo;s laboratory</p>
<p>is that it bridges the brain and body.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll soon learn from today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>his laboratory has discovered a unique set</p>
<p>of sugar-sensing neurons that exist</p>
<p>not just within the brain, but a separate set of neurons</p>
<p>that sense sweetness and sugar within the body.</p>
<p>And that much of the communication</p>
<p>between the brain and body leading to our seeking of sugar</p>
<p>is below our conscious detection.</p>
<p>Dr. Zucker has received a large number</p>
<p>of prestigious awards and appointments</p>
<p>as a consequence of his discoveries in neuroscience.</p>
<p>He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences,</p>
<p>the National Academy of Medicine,</p>
<p>and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
<p>He is also an investigator</p>
<p>with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p>
<p>For those of you that are not familiar</p>
<p>with the so-called HHMI, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,</p>
<p>Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators</p>
<p>are selected on an extremely competitive basis.</p>
<p>And indeed, they have to come back every five years</p>
<p>and prove themselves worthy of being reappointed</p>
<p>as Howard Hughes investigators.</p>
<p>Dr. Zucker has been a Howard Hughes investigator since 1989.</p>
<p>What all that means for you as a viewer</p>
<p>and or a listener of today&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>is that you are about to learn about the nervous system</p>
<p>and its ability to create perceptions,</p>
<p>in particular, the perception of taste and sugar sensing</p>
<p>from the world&rsquo;s expert on perception and taste.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that by the end of today&rsquo;s podcast,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just going to come away</p>
<p>with a deeper understanding of our perceptions</p>
<p>and our perception of tastes in particular,</p>
<p>but indeed, you will come away with an understanding</p>
<p>of how we create internal representations</p>
<p>of the entire world around us.</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>how we come to understand our life experience.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Charles Zucker.</p>
<p>Charles, thank you so much for joining me today.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
<p>I want to ask you about many things related to taste.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages that allow you</p>
<p>to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve partnered with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And gustatory perception, but maybe to start off,</p>
<p>and because you&rsquo;ve worked on a number</p>
<p>of different topics in neuroscience, not just taste,</p>
<p>how do you think about perception?</p>
<p>Or rather, I should say, how should the world</p>
<p>and people think about perception,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s different from sensation,</p>
<p>and what leads to our experience of life</p>
<p>in terms of vision, hearing, taste, et cetera?</p>
<p>So, you know, the brain is an extraordinary organ</p>
<p>that weights maybe 2% of your body mass,</p>
<p>yet it consumes anywhere between 25 to 30%</p>
<p>of all of your energy and oxygen.</p>
<p>And it gets transformed into a mind.</p>
<p>And this mind changes the human condition.</p>
<p>It make, it changes, it transforms, you know,</p>
<p>fear into courage, conformity into creativity,</p>
<p>sadness into happiness.</p>
<p>How the hell does that happen?</p>
<p>Now, the challenge that the brain faces</p>
<p>is that the world is made of real things.</p>
<p>You know, this here is a glass, and this is a cord,</p>
<p>and this is a microphone,</p>
<p>but the brain is only made of neurons</p>
<p>that only understand electrical signals.</p>
<p>So how do you transform that reality</p>
<p>into nothing that electrical signals</p>
<p>that now need to represent the world?</p>
<p>And that process is what we can operationally define</p>
<p>as perception.</p>
<p>In the senses, let&rsquo;s say olfactory, odor, taste, vision,</p>
<p>you know, we can very straightforwardly separate</p>
<p>detection from perception.</p>
<p>Detection is what happens when you take a sugar molecule,</p>
<p>you put it in your tongue,</p>
<p>and then a set of specific cells</p>
<p>now sense that sugar molecule.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s detection.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t perceived anything yet.</p>
<p>That is just your cells in your tongue</p>
<p>interacting with this chemical.</p>
<p>But now that cell gets activated</p>
<p>and sends a signal to the brain,</p>
<p>and now detection gets transformed into perception.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s trying to understand how that happens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been the maniacal drive</p>
<p>of my entire career in neuroscience.</p>
<p>How does the brain ultimately</p>
<p>transform detection into perception</p>
<p>so that it can guide actions and behaviors?</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And is a very clear and beautiful description.</p>
<p>A sort of high-level question related to that.</p>
<p>And then I think we can get into</p>
<p>some of the intermediate steps.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think many people would like to know</p>
<p>whether or not my perception of the color of your shirt</p>
<p>is the same as your perception of the color of your shirt.</p>
<p>What an excellent question.</p>
<p>Am I okay to interrupt you as I&rsquo;m guessing what you&rsquo;re going?</p>
<p>All right, very good.</p>
<p>Interruption is welcome on this podcast.</p>
<p>The audience will always penalize me for interrupting you</p>
<p>and will never penalize you for interrupting me.</p>
<p>I like the one-way penalizing.</p>
<p>Now, given what I told you before,</p>
<p>that the brain is trying to represent the world</p>
<p>based in nothing but the transformation</p>
<p>of these signals into electrical languages</p>
<p>that now neurons have to encode and decode.</p>
<p>It follows that your brain is different than my brain.</p>
<p>And therefore it follows that the way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re perceiving the world</p>
<p>must be different than mine,</p>
<p>even when receiving the same sensory cues.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you about an experiment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple experiment, yet brilliant,</p>
<p>that demonstrates how we perceive the world different.</p>
<p>So in the world of vision, as you well know,</p>
<p>we have three classes of photoreceptor neurons</p>
<p>that sense three basic colors, red, blue, and green.</p>
<p>Blue, green, and red, if we go from short to long wavelength.</p>
<p>And these three are sufficient</p>
<p>to accommodate the full visible spectra.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take three light projectors,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna project one into a white screen,</p>
<p>a red light, and the other one, green light.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna overlap the two beams,</p>
<p>and on the screen, there&rsquo;ll be yellow.</p>
<p>Okay, this is the superposition</p>
<p>when you have two beams of red and green.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m gonna take a third projector,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna put a filter</p>
<p>that projects right next to that mixed beam,</p>
<p>a spectrally pure yellow.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna ask you to come to the red</p>
<p>and green projectors and play with the intensity knobs</p>
<p>so that you can match that yellow that you&rsquo;re projecting</p>
<p>to the spectrally pure next to it.</p>
<p>Is this making sense?</p>
<p>Perfect sense.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to write down the numbers</p>
<p>in those two volume intensity knobs.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m gonna ask the next person to do the same.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m gonna ask every person</p>
<p>around this area of Battery Park in New York</p>
<p>to do the same.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna end up with thousands</p>
<p>of different number combinations.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So for all of us, is yellow enough</p>
<p>that we can use a common language?</p>
<p>But for every one of us,</p>
<p>that yellow is gonna be ever so slightly differently.</p>
<p>And so I think that simple psychological experiment</p>
<p>beautifully illustrates how we truly perceive</p>
<p>the world differently.</p>
<p>I love that example.</p>
<p>And yet in that example,</p>
<p>we know the basic elements from which color is created.</p>
<p>If we migrate into a slightly different sense,</p>
<p>let me pick a hard one,</p>
<p>like sound or olfaction.</p>
<p>Very hard then to do an experiment</p>
<p>that will allow us to get that degree of granularity</p>
<p>and beautiful causality</p>
<p>where we can show that A produces and leads to B.</p>
<p>If I give you the smell of a rose,</p>
<p>you can describe it to me.</p>
<p>If I smell the same rose, I can describe it also.</p>
<p>But I have no way whether the two of us</p>
<p>are experiencing the same.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s close enough that we can both</p>
<p>pretty much say that it has the following features</p>
<p>or other determinants.</p>
<p>But no question that your experience</p>
<p>is different than mine.</p>
<p>The fact that it&rsquo;s good enough for us to both survive,</p>
<p>that your perception of yellow and my perception of yellow,</p>
<p>at least up until now,</p>
<p>is good enough for us both to survive.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>It raises a thought about a statement made</p>
<p>by a colleague of ours, Marcus Meister at Caltech.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s never been on this podcast,</p>
<p>but in the review that I read by Marcus at one point,</p>
<p>he said that the basic function of perception</p>
<p>is to divide our behavioral responses</p>
<p>into the outcomes downstream</p>
<p>of three basic emotional responses.</p>
<p>Yum, I like it.</p>
<p>Yuck, I hate it.</p>
<p>Or meh, whatever.</p>
<p>What do you think about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking to establish a debate between you, Marcus,</p>
<p>without Marcus here.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>But what I like about that is that it seems like,</p>
<p>we know the brain is a very economical organ in some sense,</p>
<p>despite its high metabolic demands.</p>
<p>And this variation in perception</p>
<p>from one individual to the next,</p>
<p>at once seems like a problem</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all literally seeing different things.</p>
<p>And yet we function.</p>
<p>We function well enough for most of us</p>
<p>to avoid death and cliffs and eating poisons and so forth,</p>
<p>and to enjoy some aspects of life, one hopes.</p>
<p>So is there a general statement</p>
<p>that we can make about the brain,</p>
<p>not just as a organ to generate perception,</p>
<p>not just as an organ to keep us alive,</p>
<p>but also an organ that is trying to batch our behaviors</p>
<p>into general categories of outcome?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>But again, I think the role of Marcus too,</p>
<p>and I think he&rsquo;s right that broadly speaking,</p>
<p>you could categorize a lot of behaviors</p>
<p>falling into those true categories.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s 100% likely to be the case</p>
<p>for animals in the wild,</p>
<p>where the choices are not necessarily binary,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re very unique and distinct.</p>
<p>Do I wanna eat this?</p>
<p>Do I wanna kill that?</p>
<p>Do I wanna go there or do I wanna go here?</p>
<p>We humans deviated from that world long ago</p>
<p>and learned to experience life</p>
<p>where we do things that we should not be doing.</p>
<p>Some of us more than others.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You know, in my own world of taste,</p>
<p>the likelihood that an animal in the wild</p>
<p>will enjoy eating something bitter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s inconceivable.</p>
<p>Yet we, you know, love tonic water.</p>
<p>We enjoy, we like living on the edge.</p>
<p>We love enjoying experiences</p>
<p>that makes us human.</p>
<p>And that goes beyond that simple set of categories,</p>
<p>which is yummy, yucky, ah, who cares?</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s not a bad palette,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s overly reductionist</p>
<p>for certainly what we humans do.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And since we&rsquo;re here in New York,</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;re here in New York,</p>
<p>I can say that the many options,</p>
<p>the extensive variety of food, flora and fauna in New York</p>
<p>explains a lot of the more nuanced behaviors</p>
<p>that we observe.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about taste</p>
<p>because while you&rsquo;ve done extensive work</p>
<p>in the field of vision,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a topic that I love,</p>
<p>you could spend all day on,</p>
<p>taste is fascinating.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;d like to know why you migrated</p>
<p>from studying vision to studying taste.</p>
<p>And perhaps in that description,</p>
<p>you could highlight to us why we should think about</p>
<p>and how we should think about this sense of taste.</p>
<p>My goal has always been to understand,</p>
<p>as I highlighted before, how the brain does its magic.</p>
<p>You know, what part you might wonder?</p>
<p>Ideally, I&rsquo;d like to help contribute</p>
<p>to understand all of it.</p>
<p>You know, how do you encode and decode emotions?</p>
<p>How do you encode and decode memories and actions?</p>
<p>How do you make decisions?</p>
<p>How do you transform detection into perception?</p>
<p>And the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>But one of the key things in science, as you know,</p>
<p>is ensuring that you always ask the right question</p>
<p>so that you have a possibility of answering it.</p>
<p>Because if the question cannot be tractable</p>
<p>or reduced to an experimental path</p>
<p>that helps you resolve it,</p>
<p>then we end up doing some really fun science,</p>
<p>but not necessarily answering the important problem</p>
<p>that we want to study.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>From a first-person perspective, yes.</p>
<p>The hardest question, the most important question is,</p>
<p>what question are you going to try and answer?</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>And so, for example,</p>
<p>I would love to understand the neural basis of empathy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big market for that.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t even know,</p>
<p>I mean, at the molecular level, that&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>How do the circuits in your brain create that sense?</p>
<p>I have no clue how to do it.</p>
<p>I can come up with ways to think about it,</p>
<p>but I like to understand what in your brain</p>
<p>makes someone a great philanthropist?</p>
<p>What is the neural basis of love?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even know where to begin.</p>
<p>So if I want to begin to study these questions</p>
<p>about brain function</p>
<p>that can cover so many aspects of the brain,</p>
<p>I need to choose a problem that affords me that window,</p>
<p>but in a way that I can ask questions that give me answers.</p>
<p>And among the senses that have the capacity</p>
<p>of transforming detection into perception,</p>
<p>of being stored as memories, of creating emotions,</p>
<p>of giving you different actions and perceptions</p>
<p>as a function of the internal state.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re hungry, things taste very differently</p>
<p>than when you&rsquo;re sated.</p>
<p>How? Why?</p>
<p>When you taste something,</p>
<p>you now remember this amazing meal</p>
<p>you had with your first date.</p>
<p>How does that happen?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So if I want to begin to explore all of these things</p>
<p>that the brain does,</p>
<p>I have to choose a sensory system</p>
<p>that affords some degree of simplicity</p>
<p>in the way that the input-output relationships</p>
<p>are put together.</p>
<p>And in a way that still can be used</p>
<p>to ask every one of these problems</p>
<p>that the brain has to ultimately compute,</p>
<p>encode and decode.</p>
<p>And what was remarkable about the taste system</p>
<p>at the time that I began working on this</p>
<p>is that nothing was known about the molecular basis of taste.</p>
<p>You know, we knew that we could taste</p>
<p>what has been usually defined</p>
<p>as the five basic taste qualities,</p>
<p>sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.</p>
<p>Umami is a Japanese word that means yummy, delicious.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in nearly every animal species,</p>
<p>the taste of amino acids.</p>
<p>And in humans, it&rsquo;s mostly associated</p>
<p>with the taste of MSG, monosodium glutamate,</p>
<p>one amino acid in particular.</p>
<p>Just by way of example,</p>
<p>some foods that are rich in the umami-evoking stimulation.</p>
<p>Seaweed, tomatoes, cheese.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a great, great flavor enhancer.</p>
<p>It enriches our sensory experience.</p>
<p>And so the beautiful thing of the system</p>
<p>is that the lines of input are limited to five.</p>
<p>You know, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.</p>
<p>And each of them has a predetermined meaning.</p>
<p>You are born liking sugar and disliking bitter.</p>
<p>You have no choice.</p>
<p>These are hardwire systems.</p>
<p>But of course you can learn to dislike sugar</p>
<p>and to like bitters.</p>
<p>But in the wild, let&rsquo;s take humans out of the equation.</p>
<p>These are 100% predetermined.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re born with that specific valence value</p>
<p>for each taste.</p>
<p>Sweet, umami, and low salt are attractive taste qualities.</p>
<p>They evoke appetitive responses.</p>
<p>I want to consume them.</p>
<p>And bitter and sour are innately predetermined</p>
<p>to be aversive.</p>
<p>Could I interrupt you just briefly</p>
<p>and ask a question about that exact point?</p>
<p>For something to be appetitive to,</p>
<p>and some other taste to be aversive,</p>
<p>and for those to be hardwired,</p>
<p>can we assume that the sensation of very bitter,</p>
<p>or of activation of bitter receptors in the mouth</p>
<p>activates a neural circuit that causes closing of the mouth,</p>
<p>retraction of the tongue, and retraction of the body,</p>
<p>and that the taste of something sweet</p>
<p>might actually induce more licking?</p>
<p>100%, you got it.</p>
<p>The activation of the receptors in the tongue</p>
<p>that recognize sweet versus the ones that recognize bitter</p>
<p>activate an entire behavioral program.</p>
<p>And that program that we can refer as appetitiveness</p>
<p>or aversion, it&rsquo;s composed of many different subroutines.</p>
<p>In the case of bitter, it&rsquo;s very easy</p>
<p>to actually look at, see them happening in animals,</p>
<p>because the first thing you do is you stop licking,</p>
<p>then you put an unhappy face, then you squint your eyes,</p>
<p>and then you start gagging, right?</p>
<p>And that entire thing happens</p>
<p>by the activation of a bitter molecule</p>
<p>in a bitter-sensing cell in your tongue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, again, the magic of the brain,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s able to encode and decode</p>
<p>these extraordinary actions and behaviors</p>
<p>in response of nothing but a simple,</p>
<p>very unique sensory stimuli.</p>
<p>Now, let me say that this palette of five basic tastes</p>
<p>accommodates all the dietary needs of the organism.</p>
<p>Sweet to ensure that we get the right amount of energy.</p>
<p>Umami to ensure that we get proteins,</p>
<p>another essential nutrient.</p>
<p>Salt, the three appetitive ones,</p>
<p>to ensure that we maintain our electrolyte balance.</p>
<p>Bitter to prevent the ingestion of toxic, nauseous chemicals.</p>
<p>Nearly all bitter-tasting, you know,</p>
<p>things out in the wild are bad for you.</p>
<p>And sour, most likely to prevent ingestion</p>
<p>of spoiled acid, fermented foods.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That is the palette that we deal with.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>between basic taste and flavor.</p>
<p>Flavor is the whole experience.</p>
<p>Flavor is the combination of multiple tastes</p>
<p>coming together, together with smell,</p>
<p>with texture, with temperature, with the look of it,</p>
<p>that gives you what you and I would call</p>
<p>the full sensory experience, eh?</p>
<p>But we scientists need to reduce the problem</p>
<p>into its basic elements so we can begin to break it apart</p>
<p>before we put it back together.</p>
<p>So when we think about the sense of taste</p>
<p>and we try to figure out how these lines of information</p>
<p>go from your tongue to your brain and how they signal</p>
<p>and how they get integrated and how they trigger</p>
<p>all these different behaviors,</p>
<p>we look at them as individual qualities, eh?</p>
<p>So we give the animal sweet or we give them a bitter,</p>
<p>we give them sour.</p>
<p>We avoid mixes because the first stage of discovery</p>
<p>is to have that clarity as to what you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to extract so that you can hopefully,</p>
<p>meaningfully make a difference by being able to figure out</p>
<p>how is it that A goes to B to C and to D.</p>
<p>Does this make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah, almost like the primary colors to create</p>
<p>the full array of the color spectrum.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Before I ask you about the first and second</p>
<p>and third stages of taste and flavor perception,</p>
<p>is there any idea that there may be more than five?</p>
<p>There is, for example.</p>
<p>What about fat?</p>
<p>I love the taste.</p>
<p>I love fat too.</p>
<p>And I love the texture of fat,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s slightly burnt like the&hellip;</p>
<p>In South America, when I visited Buenos Aires,</p>
<p>I found that at the end of a meal, they would take a steak,</p>
<p>the trimming off the edge of the steak, burn it slightly</p>
<p>and then serve it back to me.</p>
<p>And I thought that&rsquo;s disgusting.</p>
<p>And then I tasted it and it&rsquo;s delightful.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing quite like it.</p>
<p>This goes back to this notion before</p>
<p>that we like to live on the edge.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we like to do things that we should not be doing,</p>
<p>Andrew.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, look at those muscles.</p>
<p>The, I don&rsquo;t suggest anyone eat pure fat.</p>
<p>The listeners of this podcast will immediately,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be a YouTube video soon</p>
<p>that I like eating pure fat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not on a ketogenic diet, et cetera,</p>
<p>but fat is tasty.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enhanced by the obesity problem</p>
<p>that exists in this country.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll talk about that in a little bit</p>
<p>about the gut brain axis.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be important to cover it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the other side of the taste system.</p>
<p>And so, so missing tastes, you know, one is fat.</p>
<p>Although like you clearly highlighted,</p>
<p>a lot of fat taste in quotation marks</p>
<p>is really the feeling of fat rolling on your tongue.</p>
<p>And so there is a compelling argument</p>
<p>that a lot of what we call fat taste,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really mechanosensory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somatosensory cells,</p>
<p>cells that are not responding to taste,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re responding to mechanical stimulation</p>
<p>of fat molecules rolling on the tongue</p>
<p>that gives you that perception of fat.</p>
<p>I love the idea that there is a perception of fat</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a dedicated receptor for fat,</p>
<p>mostly because it&rsquo;s evoking sensations</p>
<p>and imagery of the taste of slightly burnt fat.</p>
<p>For example, and another one, you know,</p>
<p>you could argue is metallic taste.</p>
<p>You know, I know exactly what it tastes like.</p>
<p>You know, if you ask me to explain it,</p>
<p>I will have a hard time.</p>
<p>You know, what are the palettes of that color</p>
<p>that can allow me to define it?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be easy,</p>
<p>but I know precisely what it tastes like.</p>
<p>You know, take a penny, put it in your mouth</p>
<p>and you know what it tastes like, yeah?</p>
<p>Or blood.</p>
<p>Or blood, that&rsquo;s another very good example.</p>
<p>And is there really, you know,</p>
<p>a receptor for metallic taste</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s nothing but this magical combination</p>
<p>of the activation of the existing lines.</p>
<p>Think of it as lines of information, yeah?</p>
<p>Separate lines, like the keys of a piano, yeah?</p>
<p>Sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami.</p>
<p>You play the key and you activate that one chord.</p>
<p>And that one chord in the case of a piano</p>
<p>leads to a note, you know, a tune.</p>
<p>And in the case of taste,</p>
<p>leads to an action and a behavior.</p>
<p>But you play many of them together</p>
<p>and something emerges that it&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>than any one of the pieces.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible that metallic, for example,</p>
<p>represents the combination of the activity</p>
<p>just in the right ratio of these other lines.</p>
<p>It makes sense.</p>
<p>And it actually provides a perfect,</p>
<p>your example of the piano provides a perfect segue</p>
<p>for what I&rsquo;d like to touch on next,</p>
<p>which is if you would describe the sequence of neural events</p>
<p>leading to a perceptual event of taste,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m certain that somewhere in there</p>
<p>you will embed an answer to the question</p>
<p>of whether or not we indeed have different taste receptors</p>
<p>distributed in different locations on our tongue</p>
<p>or elsewhere in the mouth.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start by debunking that old tale and myth.</p>
<p>Who came up with that?</p>
<p>There are many views, but the most prevalent</p>
<p>is that there was an original drawing</p>
<p>describing the sensitivity of the tongue</p>
<p>to different tastes.</p>
<p>So imagine I can take a Q-tip.</p>
<p>This is a thought experiment, yeah?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna dip that Q-tip in salt</p>
<p>and in quinine as something bitter</p>
<p>and glucose as something sweet.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna take that Q-tip,</p>
<p>ask you to stick your tongue out</p>
<p>and start moving it around your tongue</p>
<p>and ask you, what do you feel?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to change the concentration</p>
<p>of the amount of salt or the amount of bitter</p>
<p>and ask, can I get some sort of a map of sensitivity</p>
<p>to the different tastes?</p>
<p>And the argument that has emerged</p>
<p>is that there is a good likelihood</p>
<p>that the data was simply mistranslated</p>
<p>as it was being drawn.</p>
<p>And of course, that led to an entire industry.</p>
<p>This is the way you maximize your wine experience</p>
<p>because now we&rsquo;re going to form the vessel</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna drink from</p>
<p>so that it acts maximally on the receptors</p>
<p>which happen, all right.</p>
<p>Now, there is no tongue map, all right?</p>
<p>We have taste buds distributed</p>
<p>in various parts of the tongue.</p>
<p>So there is a map on the distribution of taste buds</p>
<p>but each taste bud has around a hundred</p>
<p>taste receptor cells.</p>
<p>And those taste receptor cells can be of five types,</p>
<p>sweet, sour, bitter, salty, or umami.</p>
<p>And for the most part,</p>
<p>all taste buds have the representation</p>
<p>of all five taste qualities.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s no question that there is a slight bias</p>
<p>for some tastes.</p>
<p>Like bitter is particularly enriched</p>
<p>at the very back of your tongue.</p>
<p>And there is a teleological basis for that,</p>
<p>actually a biological basis for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the last line of defense</p>
<p>before you swallow something bad.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s make sure that the very back of your tongue</p>
<p>has plenty of these bad news receptors</p>
<p>so that if they get activated,</p>
<p>you can trigger a gagging reflex</p>
<p>and get rid of this that otherwise may kill you, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good sense.</p>
<p>But the notion that, you know,</p>
<p>all sweet is in the front and salt is on the side,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>And there, go ahead.</p>
<p>Oh, I was just gonna ask, are there,</p>
<p>first of all, thank you for dispelling that myth.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And we will propagate that information</p>
<p>as far and wide as we can,</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s the number one myth related to taste.</p>
<p>The other one is, are there taste receptors</p>
<p>anywhere else in the mouth?</p>
<p>For instance, on the lips?</p>
<p>Yeah, the palate, the palate, not the lips.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in the pharynx at the very back of the oral cavity,</p>
<p>the tongue and the palate.</p>
<p>And the palate is very rich in sweet receptors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to pay attention to this</p>
<p>the next time I eat something sweet.</p>
<p>When you pull it up, yeah?</p>
<p>Now, the important thing is that, you know,</p>
<p>after the receptors for these five, the detectors,</p>
<p>the molecules that sends sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami,</p>
<p>these are receptors, proteins,</p>
<p>found on the surface of taste receptor cells</p>
<p>that interact with these chemicals.</p>
<p>And once they interact,</p>
<p>then they trigger the cascade of events,</p>
<p>biochemical events inside the cell</p>
<p>that now sends an electrical signal</p>
<p>that says there is sweet here, or there is salt here.</p>
<p>Now, having these receptors,</p>
<p>and my laboratory identify the receptors</p>
<p>for all five basic taste classes,</p>
<p>sweet, bitter, salt, umami, and most recently, sour.</p>
<p>Now, completing the palate,</p>
<p>you can now use these receptors to really map</p>
<p>where are they found in the tongue in a very rigorous way.</p>
<p>This is no longer about using a Q-tip</p>
<p>and trying to figure out what you&rsquo;re feeling,</p>
<p>but rather what you have in your tongue.</p>
<p>This is not a guess.</p>
<p>This is now a physical map that says</p>
<p>the sweet receptors are found here.</p>
<p>The bitter are found here.</p>
<p>And when you do that, you find that in fact,</p>
<p>every taste bud throughout your oral cavity</p>
<p>has receptors for all of the basic taste classes.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>And as it turns out, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll tell us,</p>
<p>important in terms of thinking about how the brain</p>
<p>computes and codes and decodes this thing we call taste.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to inject a quick question</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m sure is on many people&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>before we get back into the biological circuit,</p>
<p>which is many people, including myself,</p>
<p>are familiar with the experience of drinking a sip of tea</p>
<p>or coffee that is too hot and burning my tongue</p>
<p>is the way I would describe it.</p>
<p>Horrible and then disrupting my sense of taste</p>
<p>for some period of time afterward.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>When I experienced that phenomenon,</p>
<p>that unfortunate phenomenon,</p>
<p>have I destroyed taste receptors that regenerate</p>
<p>or have I somehow used temperature</p>
<p>to distort the function of the circuit</p>
<p>so that I no longer taste the way I did before?</p>
<p>Excellent question.</p>
<p>And the answer is both.</p>
<p>It turns out that your taste receptors</p>
<p>only leave for around two weeks.</p>
<p>And this, by the way, makes sense</p>
<p>because here you have an organ, the tongue,</p>
<p>that is continuously exposed</p>
<p>to everything you could range from the nicest</p>
<p>to the most horrible possible things.</p>
<p>Use your imagination.</p>
<p>And so you need to make sure</p>
<p>that these cells are always coming back in a way</p>
<p>that I can re-experience the world in the right way.</p>
<p>And there are other organs</p>
<p>that have the same underlying logic, okay?</p>
<p>Your gut, your intestines are the same way.</p>
<p>Yeah, amazing.</p>
<p>Again, they&rsquo;re receiving everything</p>
<p>that you ingest, God forbid what&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>from the spiciest, you know,</p>
<p>to the most horrible tasting, to the most delicious.</p>
<p>And again, those intestinal cells whose role</p>
<p>is to ultimately take all these nutrients</p>
<p>and bring them into the body,</p>
<p>also renewal in a very, very fast cycle.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Olfactory neurons in your nose is the other example.</p>
<p>So then A, yes, you&rsquo;re burning a lot of your cells</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s over for those.</p>
<p>The good news is that they&rsquo;re gonna come back.</p>
<p>But we know that when you burn yourself with tea,</p>
<p>they come back, you know, within 20 minutes,</p>
<p>30 minutes, an hour.</p>
<p>And these cells are not renewing in that timeframe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not listening to your needs.</p>
<p>They have their own internal clock.</p>
<p>And so you are really affecting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re damaging them in a way that they can recover.</p>
<p>And then they come back and you also damage</p>
<p>your somatosensory cells.</p>
<p>These are the cells that feel things, not taste things.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>And then, you know, you wait half an hour or so,</p>
<p>and then, my goodness, thank God, it&rsquo;s back to normal.</p>
<p>Yeah, and most of the time,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even notice the transition,</p>
<p>realizing as you told me.</p>
<p>And later I&rsquo;ll ask you about the relationship</p>
<p>between odor and taste.</p>
<p>But as a next step along this circuit,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume I ingest some,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s keep it simple, a sweet taste.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make it even simpler,</p>
<p>but at the same time, perhaps more informative.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare and contrast sweet and bitter</p>
<p>as we follow their lines from the tongue to the brain.</p>
<p>So the first thing is that the two evoke</p>
<p>diametrically opposed behaviors.</p>
<p>If we have to come up with two sensory experience</p>
<p>that represent polar opposites,</p>
<p>it will be sweet and bitter.</p>
<p>There are no two colors that represent polar opposites</p>
<p>because, you know, you could say black and white,</p>
<p>they are polar opposites,</p>
<p>one that takes only one thing,</p>
<p>the other one that takes everything.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t evoke different behaviors.</p>
<p>Even political parties have some overlap.</p>
<p>Sweet and bitter are the two opposite ends</p>
<p>of the sensory spectra.</p>
<p>Now, a taste can be defined by two features.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m a reductionist,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m reducing it in a way that I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to follow the signal.</p>
<p>And the two features are its quality and its valence.</p>
<p>And valence, with a little V,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we say in Spanish, with a V,</p>
<p>means the value of that experience, all right?</p>
<p>Or in this case of that stimuli.</p>
<p>And you take sweet, sweet has a quality, an identity,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what you and I will refer to</p>
<p>as the taste of sweet.</p>
<p>We know exactly what it tastes like.</p>
<p>But sweet also has a positive valence,</p>
<p>which makes it incredibly attractive and appetitive.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s attractive and appetitive,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ll tell you in a second,</p>
<p>independent of its identity and quality.</p>
<p>In fact, we have been able to engineer animals</p>
<p>where we completely remove the valence from the stimuli.</p>
<p>So these animals can taste sweet,</p>
<p>can recognize it as sweet, but it&rsquo;s no longer attractive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one more chemical stimuli.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the identity and the valence</p>
<p>are encoded in two separate parts of the brain.</p>
<p>In the case of bitter, again, it has, on the one hand,</p>
<p>its identity, its quality.</p>
<p>And you know exactly what bitter tastes like.</p>
<p>I can taste it now, even as you describe it.</p>
<p>But it also has a valence, and that&rsquo;s a negative valence,</p>
<p>because it evokes aversive behaviors.</p>
<p>Are we on?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And it comes to mind,</p>
<p>I remember telling some kids recently</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to go get ice cream,</p>
<p>and it was interesting.</p>
<p>They looked up and they started smacking their lips,</p>
<p>like, you know, they&rsquo;ll actually evoke-</p>
<p>The anticipatory response, absolutely.</p>
<p>When we talk about the gut brain, maybe we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>So then the signals, if we follow now these two lines,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really like two separate keys</p>
<p>at the two ends of this keyboard.</p>
<p>And you press one key and you activate this cord.</p>
<p>So you activate the sweet cells throughout your oral cavity,</p>
<p>and they all converge into a group of sweet neurons</p>
<p>in the next station, which is still outside the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the taste ganglia.</p>
<p>These are the neurons that innervate your tongue</p>
<p>and the oral cavity.</p>
<p>Where do they sit approximately?</p>
<p>Around there, yeah.</p>
<p>Right here around the lymph nodes, more or less.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>And there are two main ganglia</p>
<p>that innervate the vast majority</p>
<p>of all taste buds in the oral cavity.</p>
<p>And then from there,</p>
<p>that sweet signal goes onto the brainstem.</p>
<p>The brainstem is the entry of the body into the brain.</p>
<p>And there are different areas of the brainstem,</p>
<p>and there are different groups of neurons in the brainstem.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this unique area</p>
<p>in a unique topographically defined location</p>
<p>in the rostral side of the brainstem</p>
<p>that receives all of the taste input.</p>
<p>A very dense area of the brain.</p>
<p>A very rich area of the brain, exactly.</p>
<p>And from there, the sweet signal goes to this other area,</p>
<p>higher up on the brainstem.</p>
<p>And then it goes through a number of stations</p>
<p>where that sweet signal goes from sweet neuron</p>
<p>to sweet neuron to sweet neuron</p>
<p>to eventually get to your cortex.</p>
<p>And once it gets to your taste cortex,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where meaning is imposed into that signal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s then, and only then,</p>
<p>this is what the data suggests,</p>
<p>that now you can identify this as a sweet stimuli.</p>
<p>And how quickly does that all happen?</p>
<p>You know, the timescale of the nervous system, it&rsquo;s fast.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>Within less than a second.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>I rarely mistake bitter for sweet.</p>
<p>Maybe with respect to people and my own poor judgment,</p>
<p>but not with respect to taste.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in fact, we can demonstrate this</p>
<p>because we can stick electrodes</p>
<p>at each of these stations conceptually, yeah?</p>
<p>And we can stimulate the tongue</p>
<p>and then we can record the signals pretty much time log</p>
<p>to stimulus delivery.</p>
<p>You deliver the stimuli and within a fraction of a second,</p>
<p>you see now the response in these following stations.</p>
<p>Now it gets to the cortex, yeah?</p>
<p>And now in there, you impose meaning to that taste.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an area of your brain</p>
<p>that represents the taste of sweet in taste cortex</p>
<p>and a different area that represents the taste of bitter.</p>
<p>In essence, there is a topographic map</p>
<p>of these taste qualities inside your brain.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re gonna do a thought experiment, all right?</p>
<p>Now, if this group of neurons in your cortex</p>
<p>really represents the sense of sweet</p>
<p>and this added different group of neurons in your brain</p>
<p>represents the taste, the perception of bitter,</p>
<p>then we should be able to do two things.</p>
<p>First, I should be able to go into your brain,</p>
<p>somehow silence those neurons,</p>
<p>find a way to prevent them from being activated</p>
<p>and I can give you all the sweet you want</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll never know that you&rsquo;re tasting sweet.</p>
<p>And conversely, I should be able to go into your brain,</p>
<p>come up with a way to activate those neurons</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m giving you absolutely nothing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna think that you&rsquo;re getting that full percept.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely what we have done</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s precisely what you get.</p>
<p>This of course is in the brain of mice, eh?</p>
<p>But presumably in humans, it would work similarly.</p>
<p>Absolutely the same, zeroed out.</p>
<p>I have no questions.</p>
<p>So this attests to two important things.</p>
<p>The first, to the predetermined nature of the sense of taste</p>
<p>because it means I can go to these parts of your brain</p>
<p>in the absence of any stimuli</p>
<p>and have you throw the full behavioral experience.</p>
<p>In fact, when we activate in your cortex,</p>
<p>these bitter neurons, the animal can start gagging.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s drinking only water.</p>
<p>But the animal thinks that it&rsquo;s getting a bitter stimuli.</p>
<p>This is amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the second, just to finish the line</p>
<p>so that it doesn&rsquo;t sound like it teaches two things</p>
<p>and then I only give you one lesson,</p>
<p>is that it substantiates this capacity of the brain</p>
<p>to segregate, to separate in these nodes of action</p>
<p>the representation of these two</p>
<p>diametrically opposed percepts, eh?</p>
<p>Which is sweet, for example, versus bitter.</p>
<p>The reason I say amazing, and that is also amazing,</p>
<p>is the following.</p>
<p>You told us earlier, and you&rsquo;re absolutely correct,</p>
<p>of course, that at the end of the day,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s one group of neurons over here</p>
<p>and another group of neurons over there,</p>
<p>just the way it turns out to be,</p>
<p>electrical activity is the generic common language</p>
<p>of both sets of neurons.</p>
<p>So that raises the question for me</p>
<p>of whether or not those separate sets of neurons</p>
<p>are connected to areas of the brain</p>
<p>that create this sense of valence,</p>
<p>or whether or not they&rsquo;re simply connected, excuse me,</p>
<p>to sets of neurons that evoke distinct behaviors</p>
<p>of moving towards and inhaling more</p>
<p>and licking or aversive.</p>
<p>Are we essentially interpreting our behavior</p>
<p>and our micro-responses,</p>
<p>or are micro-responses in our behaviors</p>
<p>the consequence of the percept?</p>
<p>Excellent, excellent question.</p>
<p>So first the answer is they go into an area of the brain</p>
<p>where valence is imposed.</p>
<p>And that area is known as the amygdala.</p>
<p>And the sweet neurons go to a different area</p>
<p>than the bitter neurons.</p>
<p>Now, I wanna do a thought experiment</p>
<p>because I think your audience might appreciate this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I activate this group of neurons</p>
<p>and the animal increases licking,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m activating the sweet neurons.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s expected because now it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>tasting this water as if it was sugar.</p>
<p>Now, this is Moses transforming water into wine.</p>
<p>In this case, we&rsquo;re gonna, and today&rsquo;s Passover,</p>
<p>so then it&rsquo;s an appropriate, you know, example.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re transforming it into sweet, yeah?</p>
<p>But how do I know?</p>
<p>How do I know that activating them</p>
<p>is evoking a positive feeling inside,</p>
<p>a goodness, a satisfaction, oh, I love it,</p>
<p>versus I&rsquo;m just increasing licking?</p>
<p>Which is the other option because all we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>is that the animal is licking more,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to infer that that means</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s feeling something really good</p>
<p>versus you know what?</p>
<p>That piano line is going back straight into the tongue,</p>
<p>and all he&rsquo;s doing is forcing it to move faster.</p>
<p>Well, we can actually separate this by doing experiments</p>
<p>that allow us to fundamentally distinguish them.</p>
<p>And imagine the following experiment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take the animal,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna put him inside a box that has two sides.</p>
<p>And the two sides have features that make him different.</p>
<p>One has yellow little toys, the other one has green toys.</p>
<p>One has little, you know, black stripes,</p>
<p>the other one has blue stripes.</p>
<p>So the animal can tell the two halves.</p>
<p>I take the mouse, put him inside this arena,</p>
<p>this play arena, and he will explore</p>
<p>and pots around both sides with equal frequency.</p>
<p>And now what I&rsquo;m going to do is I&rsquo;m gonna activate</p>
<p>these neurons, these sweet neurons,</p>
<p>every time the animal is on the side with the yellow stripes.</p>
<p>And if that is creating a positive internal state,</p>
<p>what would the animal now want to do?</p>
<p>It will want to stay on the side with the yellow stripes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no leaking here.</p>
<p>The animal is not extending its tongue</p>
<p>every time I&rsquo;m activating these neurons, okay?</p>
<p>This is known as a place preference test.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s generally used as just one form</p>
<p>of many different tests to demonstrate</p>
<p>that the activation of a group of neurons in the brain</p>
<p>is imposing, for example,</p>
<p>a positive versus a negative valence.</p>
<p>Whereas if I do the same thing</p>
<p>by activating the bitter neurons,</p>
<p>the animal will actively want now to stay away</p>
<p>from the side where these neurons are being activated.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely what you see.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely what we see.</p>
<p>Many people, including myself,</p>
<p>are familiar with the experience of going to a restaurant,</p>
<p>eating a variety of foods,</p>
<p>and then, fortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t happen that often,</p>
<p>but then feeling very sick.</p>
<p>I learned coming up in neuroscience</p>
<p>that this is one strong example of one trial learning,</p>
<p>that from that point on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the restaurant or the waitress or the waiter</p>
<p>or the date, but it&rsquo;s my notion</p>
<p>of it had to have been the shrimp.</p>
<p>That leads me to then want to avoid shrimp in every context,</p>
<p>maybe even shrimp powder.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>For a very long time.</p>
<p>I can imagine all the evolutionarily adaptive reasons</p>
<p>why this such a phenomenon would exist.</p>
<p>Do we have any concept of where in this pathway that exists?</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>We know, actually, a significant amount</p>
<p>at a general level.</p>
<p>In fact, more than shrimp,</p>
<p>oysters are even a more dramatic example.</p>
<p>One bad oyster is all you need</p>
<p>to be driven away for the next six months.</p>
<p>I think because the texture alone</p>
<p>is something that one learns to overcome.</p>
<p>I actually really enjoy oysters.</p>
<p>I despise mussels, despise shrimp,</p>
<p>not the animal, but the taste.</p>
<p>And yet oysters, for some reason,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve yet to have a bad experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like uni, by the way.</p>
<p>Texture is hard to get over,</p>
<p>but once you get over, it&rsquo;s delicious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they tell me.</p>
<p>We were both in San Diego at one point,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll give a plug to Sushi Ota</p>
<p>as kind of the famous little sushi.</p>
<p>And they have amazing uni, and I&rsquo;ve tried it twice,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m O for two.</p>
<p>Somehow the texture outweighs any kind of the deliciousness</p>
<p>that people report.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very acquired taste.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like beer.</p>
<p>You know, I grew up in Chile.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the accent comes from, in case anyone wonder.</p>
<p>And you know, by the time I came here to graduate school,</p>
<p>I was 19, too old to, you know,</p>
<p>overcome my heavy Chilean accent.</p>
<p>So here I am, 40 years, 50 years late, not quite, 40 plus.</p>
<p>We appreciate it.</p>
<p>And I still sound like I just came off the boat.</p>
<p>So in Chile, you don&rsquo;t drink beer when you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>You drink wine.</p>
<p>You know, Chile is a huge wine producer.</p>
<p>So when I came to the US,</p>
<p>all of my, you know, classmates, you know,</p>
<p>were drinking beer.</p>
<p>Because they, you know, they had finished college</p>
<p>where they were all, you know, beer drinking,</p>
<p>and, you know, graduate school,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working 18 hours a day, every day.</p>
<p>The way they, you know, relax, let&rsquo;s go and have some beers.</p>
<p>And beer is cheaper.</p>
<p>And beer is cheap.</p>
<p>And we were being clearly underpaid, may I add.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an acquired taste.</p>
<p>It was too late by then.</p>
<p>And here I am, you know, 60 plus.</p>
<p>And if you take all the beer I&rsquo;ve drunk in my entire life,</p>
<p>I would say they add to less than an eight ounce</p>
<p>glass of water.</p>
<p>Impressive.</p>
<p>Well, your health is probably better for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Your physical health, anyway.</p>
<p>So, you know, it goes back to, you know, acquired taste.</p>
<p>This is the connection to uni and to oysters.</p>
<p>Now, going back to the one trial learning,</p>
<p>you know, this is the great thing about our brains.</p>
<p>Certain things we need to repeat a hundred times</p>
<p>to learn them.</p>
<p>Hello, operator, can I have the phone number</p>
<p>for Sushi Ota, please?</p>
<p>And then she&rsquo;ll give it to you over the phone,</p>
<p>at least in the old days.</p>
<p>And then you need to repeat it to yourself</p>
<p>over and over and over the next minute</p>
<p>so you can dial Sushi Ota.</p>
<p>And five minutes later, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we call working memory.</p>
<p>Then there is the short-term memory.</p>
<p>We park our car and if we&rsquo;re lucky,</p>
<p>by the end of the day, we remember where it is.</p>
<p>And then there is the long-term memory.</p>
<p>We remember the birthdays of every one of our children</p>
<p>for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>Well, there are events that a single event is so traumatic,</p>
<p>that it activates the circuits in a way</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a one trial learning.</p>
<p>And the taste system is literally</p>
<p>at the top of that food chain.</p>
<p>And there is a phenomenon known</p>
<p>as conditioned taste aversion.</p>
<p>You can pair an attractive stimuli with a really bad one.</p>
<p>And you can make an animal begin to vehemently dislike,</p>
<p>for example, sugar.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve conditioned the animals</p>
<p>to now be averse to this otherwise nice taste</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been associated with malaise.</p>
<p>And when you do that, now you could begin to ask,</p>
<p>what is change in the signal as it travels from the tongue</p>
<p>to the brain in a normal animal versus an animal</p>
<p>where you have now transformed sweet</p>
<p>from being attractive to being aversive?</p>
<p>And this is the way now you begin to explore</p>
<p>how the brain changes the nature, the quality,</p>
<p>the meaning of a stimuli as a function of its state.</p>
<p>I have a number of questions related to that,</p>
<p>all of which relate to this idea of context.</p>
<p>Because you mentioned before</p>
<p>that flavor is distinct from taste</p>
<p>because flavor involves smell, texture, temperature,</p>
<p>and some other features, uni, sea urchin</p>
<p>being a good example of, I can sense the texture.</p>
<p>It actually, yeah, I won&rsquo;t describe what it reminds me of</p>
<p>for various reasons.</p>
<p>The ability to place context on,</p>
<p>to insert context into a perception</p>
<p>or rather to insert a perception into context is so powerful.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an element of kind of mystery about it,</p>
<p>but if we start to think about some of the more nuance</p>
<p>that we like to live at the edge, as you say,</p>
<p>how many different tastes on the taste dial,</p>
<p>to go back to your analogy earlier, the color dial,</p>
<p>do you think that there could be</p>
<p>for something as fixed as bitter?</p>
<p>So for instance, I don&rsquo;t think I like bitter tastes,</p>
<p>but I like some fermented foods</p>
<p>that seem to have a little bit of sour</p>
<p>and have a little bit of that briny flavor.</p>
<p>How much plasticity do you think there is there?</p>
<p>And in particular across the lifespan,</p>
<p>because I think one of the most salient examples of this</p>
<p>is that kids don&rsquo;t seem to like certain vegetables,</p>
<p>but they all are hardwired to like sweet tastes.</p>
<p>And yet you could also imagine that one of the reasons</p>
<p>why they may eventually grow to incorporate vegetables</p>
<p>is because of some knowledge</p>
<p>that vegetables might be-</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>Better for them.</p>
<p>So is there a change in the receptors,</p>
<p>the distribution, the number, the sensitivity, et cetera,</p>
<p>that can explain the transition</p>
<p>from wanting to avoid vegetables</p>
<p>to being willing to eat vegetables,</p>
<p>simply in childhood to early development?</p>
<p>I want to take the question slightly differently,</p>
<p>but I think it would illustrate the point.</p>
<p>And I want to just use the difference</p>
<p>between the olfactory system</p>
<p>and the taste system to make the point.</p>
<p>Taste system, five basic palates,</p>
<p>sweet, sour, bitter, salt, and umami,</p>
<p>each of them has a predetermined identity.</p>
<p>We know exactly what, and valence.</p>
<p>These are attractive, these are aversive.</p>
<p>In the olfactory system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s claimed that we can smell millions of different odors.</p>
<p>Yet for the most part,</p>
<p>none of them have an innate predetermined meaning.</p>
<p>In the olfactory system,</p>
<p>meaning is imposed by learning and experience.</p>
<p>Even the smell of smoke?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to give you, I&rsquo;m going to make it differently.</p>
<p>There are a handful of the millions of odors</p>
<p>that were claimed that you could immediately tell me</p>
<p>these are aversive and these are attractive.</p>
<p>Vomit.</p>
<p>So vomit, it&rsquo;s not correct</p>
<p>because I can assure you that there are cultures</p>
<p>and societies where things</p>
<p>which are far less appealing than vomit</p>
<p>do not evoke an aversive reaction.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>Sulfur would be maybe a universal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking pheromones, okay?</p>
<p>Pheromones are in a different category</p>
<p>that trigger innate responses.</p>
<p>But nearly every other is afforded meaning</p>
<p>by learning and experience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you like broccoli.</p>
<p>And I despise broccoli</p>
<p>because I remember my mother forcing me to eat broccoli.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>Same sensory experience.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>This accommodates two important things.</p>
<p>In the case of taste,</p>
<p>you have neurons at every station that are for sweet,</p>
<p>for sour, for bitter, for salty, and umami.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only five classes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not going to take a lot of your brain.</p>
<p>If we can in fact smell a million odors</p>
<p>and every one of those odors</p>
<p>had to have predetermined meaning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not going to be enough brain</p>
<p>just to accommodate that one sense.</p>
<p>And so evolution in its infinite wisdom,</p>
<p>evolve a system where you put together a pathway</p>
<p>and a cortex, olfactory cortex,</p>
<p>where you have the capacity to associate every other</p>
<p>in a specific context that now gives it the meaning.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s go back to the original question then.</p>
<p>So other than clearly plastic, mega plastic,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s fundamental basis and neural organization.</p>
<p>But taste, we just told you that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>predetermined hard wire.</p>
<p>But predetermined hard wire,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s not modulated</p>
<p>by learning or experience.</p>
<p>It only means that you are born liking sweet</p>
<p>and disliking bitter.</p>
<p>And we have many examples of plasticity,</p>
<p>beer being one example.</p>
<p>So why do we learn to love beer?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in coffee.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it has an associated gain to the system.</p>
<p>And that gain to the system,</p>
<p>that positive valence that emerges</p>
<p>out of that negative signal is sufficient</p>
<p>to create that positive association.</p>
<p>And in the case of beer, of course, it&rsquo;s alcohol.</p>
<p>The feeling good that we get after</p>
<p>is more than sufficient to say,</p>
<p>I want to have more of this.</p>
<p>And in the case of coffee, of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s caffeine activating a whole group</p>
<p>of neurotransmitter systems that give you</p>
<p>that high associated with coffee.</p>
<p>So yes, this taste system is changeable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s malleable and is subjected to learning and experience.</p>
<p>But unlike the olfactory system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s restricted in what you could do with it</p>
<p>because its goal is to allow you</p>
<p>to get nutrients and survive.</p>
<p>The goal of the olfactory system is very different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being used, not in our case,</p>
<p>but in every animal species to identify friend versus foe,</p>
<p>to identify mate,</p>
<p>to identify ecological niches they want to be in.</p>
<p>So it plays a very broad role</p>
<p>that then requires that it be set up, organized,</p>
<p>and function in a very different type of context.</p>
<p>Taste is about, can we get the nutrients we need to survive?</p>
<p>And can we ensure that we are attracted</p>
<p>to the ones we need?</p>
<p>And we are averse to the ones that are going to kill us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being overly simplistic and reductionist,</p>
<p>but I think it illustrates a huge difference</p>
<p>between these two chemosensory systems.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re being overly simplistic.</p>
<p>I think it illustrates the key intractable nature</p>
<p>of this system and the way you&rsquo;ve approached it.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important for people to hear that</p>
<p>because everybody, as we are,</p>
<p>is mystified with empathy and love, et cetera.</p>
<p>So in fairness to that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ask a sort of a high-level question</p>
<p>or abstract question.</p>
<p>This was based on a conversation I had</p>
<p>with a former girlfriend,</p>
<p>where we were talking about chemistry between individuals.</p>
<p>Very complicated topic on the one hand,</p>
<p>but on the other hand, quite simple in that certain people,</p>
<p>for whatever reason, evoke a tremendous sense of arousal,</p>
<p>for lack of a better word,</p>
<p>between two people, one would hope.</p>
<p>At least for some period of time.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know this was that kind of a podcast.</p>
<p>No, well, the reason I,</p>
<p>but this has to do with taste because she said something,</p>
<p>I think in part to maybe irritate me a bit,</p>
<p>but we were commenting,</p>
<p>not about our own experience of each other,</p>
<p>but of someone that she was now very excited about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on good terms.</p>
<p>And she said, what do you think it is,</p>
<p>this thing of chemistry?</p>
<p>So maybe she was trying to, you know.</p>
<p>Warn you of what&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>Warn me of what&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>And she said, I have a feeling something about it</p>
<p>is in smell and something about it is actually in taste.</p>
<p>Literally the taste of somebody&rsquo;s breath.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way she described it.</p>
<p>And I thought that was a very interesting example</p>
<p>for a number of reasons,</p>
<p>but in particular,</p>
<p>because it gets to the merging of odor and taste,</p>
<p>but also to the idea that of course,</p>
<p>the context of a new relationship,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming, and in fact,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re both attractive people, et cetera.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole context there,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve had the experience of the odor of somebody&rsquo;s breath</p>
<p>being aversive,</p>
<p>not because I could identify it as aversive.</p>
<p>Because you just didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>But because it just didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s because you associated with other odors</p>
<p>that trigger that negative, you know,</p>
<p>aversive reaction, by the way.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>There are certain perfumes to me that are aversive.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>And there are other scents,</p>
<p>and I can recall scents of skin, of foods, et cetera,</p>
<p>that are immensely appetitive.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve experienced both sides of this equation myself,</p>
<p>and she was describing this.</p>
<p>And to me, more than tasting wine,</p>
<p>which is the typical example,</p>
<p>where people inhale it and then they drink it,</p>
<p>to me, this seems like something</p>
<p>that more people might be able to relate to,</p>
<p>that certain things and people smell delicious.</p>
<p>Even mothers describing the smell of their baby&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Well, you know, a mother.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I mean, you know.</p>
<p>Men too, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Our own babies, when they&rsquo;re in their necks,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the magical place.</p>
<p>Their neck.</p>
<p>The back of their neck.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness.</p>
<p>I have a grandchild now,</p>
<p>so I know exactly what Rio, that&rsquo;s his name, smells like.</p>
<p>Okay, so more beautiful examples.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always more fun to think about the beautiful,</p>
<p>positive, the appetitive examples.</p>
<p>The smell of the back of your grandson&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, you could get more specific than that,</p>
<p>but not a lot more specific.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So what is going on in terms of the combination</p>
<p>of odor and taste,</p>
<p>given that these two systems are so different?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And they come together.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is a place in the brain</p>
<p>where they come together to integrate the two</p>
<p>into what we would call, you know, that sensory experience.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you an experiment that you could do</p>
<p>that demonstrates this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s good for your audience here</p>
<p>to get a sense of how we approach these problems</p>
<p>so that we can get, you know,</p>
<p>meaningful scientific answers, eh?</p>
<p>So we know where the olfactory cortex is in the brain.</p>
<p>We know where the taste cortex is in the brain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in two different places.</p>
<p>We can go to each of these two cortices,</p>
<p>put color traces, we put green in one,</p>
<p>we put red in the other,</p>
<p>and we see where the colors go to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a reflection of where those neurons</p>
<p>are projecting to into their next targets.</p>
<p>Once they get the signal,</p>
<p>where do they send the signal to?</p>
<p>And then we reason that if odor and taste</p>
<p>come together somewhere in the brain,</p>
<p>we should find an area that now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting red and green color.</p>
<p>And we found such an area.</p>
<p>And next, we anticipated, we hypothesized,</p>
<p>that maybe this is the area in the brain of the mouse,</p>
<p>corresponding area in the brain of humans,</p>
<p>that integrates odor and taste.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s known, the term normally used</p>
<p>is multisensory integration.</p>
<p>And if this is true, we could do the following experiment.</p>
<p>We can train a mouse</p>
<p>to lick sweet,</p>
<p>and if they guess correctly</p>
<p>that that is supposed to be sweet,</p>
<p>they should go now to the right port,</p>
<p>to the right side, to get a water reward.</p>
<p>If they go to the left when it was sweet,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re incorrect and they get no reward.</p>
<p>And they actually get a timeout.</p>
<p>Now the mice are thirsty,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re very motivated to perform.</p>
<p>And if you repeat this task a hundred times,</p>
<p>a hundred trials, incredibly enough,</p>
<p>this animal learned to recognize the sweet</p>
<p>and execute the right action.</p>
<p>And by their action,</p>
<p>we now are being told what that animal is tasting.</p>
<p>We can make it more interesting</p>
<p>and we can give them sweet and bitter</p>
<p>and say if it&rsquo;s sweet, go to the right,</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s bitter, go to the left.</p>
<p>And after you train them,</p>
<p>these mice with 90% accuracy will tell you</p>
<p>when you randomize now the stimuli,</p>
<p>what was sweet and what was bitter.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We can now do the same experiment,</p>
<p>but now mix taste with odor.</p>
<p>And say, if you got odor alone,</p>
<p>go to the right or push this lever in mice.</p>
<p>If you get taste alone,</p>
<p>go to this other part or push this other lever.</p>
<p>And if you get the two together,</p>
<p>do this something else.</p>
<p>And if you train the mice,</p>
<p>the mice are able now to report back to you</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s sensing taste alone, odor alone, or the mix.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>We can go to the brain of these mice</p>
<p>and go to this area that we now uncover,</p>
<p>discover as being the site of multi-sensor integration</p>
<p>between taste and odor,</p>
<p>and silence it.</p>
<p>Prevent it from being activated experimentally.</p>
<p>And if that area really represented</p>
<p>the integration of these two,</p>
<p>the animals should still be able</p>
<p>to recognize the taste alone.</p>
<p>They still should be able to recognize the odor alone,</p>
<p>but should be incapable now to recognize the mix.</p>
<p>And exactly as predicted,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what you get.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>The brain is basically a series of engineered circuits.</p>
<p>Complex.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>And our task is to figure out</p>
<p>how can we extract this amazing architecture</p>
<p>of these circuits in a way</p>
<p>that we can begin to uncover the mysteries of the brain.</p>
<p>And why certain people&rsquo;s breath tastes so good</p>
<p>and other people&rsquo;s not so good.</p>
<p>So I never answered that,</p>
<p>but I told you how we can figure out</p>
<p>where in the brain is happening.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve been having this discussion,</p>
<p>I thought a few times about similarities</p>
<p>to the visual system,</p>
<p>or differences to the visual system.</p>
<p>The visual system,</p>
<p>there are a couple of phenomenon</p>
<p>that I wonder if they also exist in the taste system.</p>
<p>In the visual system,</p>
<p>we know, for instance,</p>
<p>that if you look at something long enough</p>
<p>and activate the given receptors long enough,</p>
<p>that object will actually disappear.</p>
<p>We offset this with little micro eye movements, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the principle is a fundamental one,</p>
<p>this habituation or desensitization.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to call it something different,</p>
<p>but you get the idea, of course.</p>
<p>In the taste system,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly familiar with eating something</p>
<p>very, very sweet for the first time in a long time,</p>
<p>and it tastes very sweet.</p>
<p>But a few more licks, a few more bites,</p>
<p>and now it tastes not as sweet.</p>
<p>With olfaction, I&rsquo;m familiar with the odor in a room</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like or I like, and then it disappearing.</p>
<p>So similar phenomenon.</p>
<p>Where does that occur?</p>
<p>And can you imagine a sort of a system</p>
<p>by which people could leverage that?</p>
<p>Because I do think that most people</p>
<p>are interested in eating not more sugar, but less sugar.</p>
<p>I think we have better ways to approach that,</p>
<p>and we can transition from taste into these other circuits</p>
<p>that makes sugar so extraordinarily impossible</p>
<p>not to consume.</p>
<p>Impossible.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So where does this desensitizing happens?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the term that we use, eh?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I think, happening at multiple stations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening at the receptor level,</p>
<p>i.e. the cells in your tongue that are sensing that sugar.</p>
<p>As you activate this receptor</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s triggering activity after activity after activity,</p>
<p>eventually you exhaust the receptor.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m using terms which are extraordinarily loose.</p>
<p>But for sake of this discussion-</p>
<p>For the sake of this discussion,</p>
<p>the receptor gets to a point</p>
<p>where it undergoes a set of changes, chemical changes,</p>
<p>where it now signals far less efficiently,</p>
<p>or it even gets removed from the surface of the cell.</p>
<p>And now what will happen is that the same amount of sugar</p>
<p>will trigger far less of a response.</p>
<p>And that is a huge side of this modulation.</p>
<p>And then the next, I believe,</p>
<p>is the integrated, again, loss of signaling</p>
<p>that happens by continuous activation of the circuit</p>
<p>at each of these different neural stations.</p>
<p>You know, there is from the tongue to the ganglia,</p>
<p>from the ganglia to the first station in the brainstem,</p>
<p>a second station in the brainstem,</p>
<p>to the thalamus, then to the cortex.</p>
<p>So there are multiple steps that this signal is traveling.</p>
<p>Now you might say, why, if this is a label line,</p>
<p>why do you need to have so many stations?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the taste system is so important</p>
<p>to ensure that you get what you need to survive,</p>
<p>that it has to be subjected to modulation</p>
<p>by the internal state.</p>
<p>And each of these nodes provides a new site</p>
<p>to give it plasticity and modulation.</p>
<p>Not necessarily to change the way that something tastes,</p>
<p>but to ensure that you consume more or less,</p>
<p>or differently, of what you need.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you one example</p>
<p>of how the internal state changes</p>
<p>the way the taste system works.</p>
<p>Salt is very appetitive at low concentrations.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because we need it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our electrolyte balance requires salt.</p>
<p>Every one of their neurons uses salt</p>
<p>as the most important of the ions,</p>
<p>you know, with potassium to ensure</p>
<p>that you can transfer these electrical signals</p>
<p>within and between neurons.</p>
<p>But at high concentrations, let&rsquo;s say ocean water,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredibly aversive.</p>
<p>And we all know this because we&rsquo;ve gone to the ocean</p>
<p>and then when you get it in your mouth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that great.</p>
<p>However, if I salt deprive you,</p>
<p>and we can do this in experimental models quite readily,</p>
<p>now this incredibly high concentration of salt,</p>
<p>one molar sodium chloride,</p>
<p>becomes amazingly appetitive and attractive.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on in here?</p>
<p>Your tongue is telling you, this is horrible,</p>
<p>but your brain is telling you, I don&rsquo;t care, you need it.</p>
<p>And this is what we call the modulation</p>
<p>of the taste system by the internal state.</p>
<p>And presumably if one is hungry enough,</p>
<p>even uni will taste good.</p>
<p>Just get to me.</p>
<p>You hit it right on the money.</p>
<p>No, no, this is exactly correct.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re thirsty and hungry,</p>
<p>you suppress hunger so that you don&rsquo;t waste water molecules</p>
<p>in digesting food.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re thirsty and you have no water,</p>
<p>you will die within a week or so.</p>
<p>But you can go on a hunger strike</p>
<p>as long as you have water for months,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna eat up all your energy reserves.</p>
<p>Water is a different story.</p>
<p>So you could see that there are multiple layers</p>
<p>at which the taste system that guides our drive</p>
<p>and our motivation to consume the nutrients we need</p>
<p>has to be modulated in response to the internal state.</p>
<p>And of course, internal state itself has to be modulated</p>
<p>by the external world.</p>
<p>And so that I think is a reason why</p>
<p>what could otherwise would have been</p>
<p>an incredibly simple system from the tongue</p>
<p>to the cortex in one just wire, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Because you have to ensure that each step</p>
<p>you give the system that level of flexibility</p>
<p>or what we call in neuroscience plasticity.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re headed into the gut.</p>
<p>But I have a question that has just been on my mind</p>
<p>for a bit now, because I was drinking this water</p>
<p>and it has essentially no taste.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is there any kind of signal for the absence of taste</p>
<p>despite having something in the mouth?</p>
<p>And here is why I ask, what I&rsquo;m thinking about is saliva.</p>
<p>And while it&rsquo;s true that if I eat a lot</p>
<p>of very highly palatable foods,</p>
<p>that does change how I experience more bland foods.</p>
<p>I must confess when I eat a lot of these</p>
<p>highly processed foods, I don&rsquo;t particularly like them.</p>
<p>I tend to crave healthier foods,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably for contextual reasons</p>
<p>about nutrients, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I could imagine an experiment where-</p>
<p>Is there a taste of no taste?</p>
<p>Right, is there a taste of no taste?</p>
<p>Because in the visual system there is, right?</p>
<p>You close the eyes and you start getting increases</p>
<p>in activity in the visual system as opposed to decreases,</p>
<p>which often surprises people.</p>
<p>But there are reasons for that,</p>
<p>because everything is about signal to noise,</p>
<p>signal to background.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I can tell you that most of our work is trying to focus</p>
<p>on how the taste system works, not how it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Well, but-</p>
<p>I know, I&rsquo;m just being playful.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re being playful.</p>
<p>And I knew when inviting you here today,</p>
<p>I was setting myself up for, actually on a different-</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to learn things, however-</p>
<p>All right, listen, I was weaned in this system of,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll say it here for the second time.</p>
<p>Actually, I recorded a podcast recently</p>
<p>with a very prominent podcast, the Lex Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>and I made reference</p>
<p>to the so-called New York Neuroscience Mafia.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say whether or not we are sitting</p>
<p>in the presence of the New York Neuroscience Mafia member,</p>
<p>but in any event, I know the sorts of ribbing</p>
<p>that they provide.</p>
<p>For those listening, this is the kind of hazing</p>
<p>that happens, benevolent hazing in academia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the target.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sign of love.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to tell me that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always about the science in the end.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t know the answer,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t even know how I would explore it</p>
<p>in a way that it will rigorously teach me,</p>
<p>but-</p>
<p>Let me tell you why I&rsquo;m asking,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll offer an experiment</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d love to see someone in your class do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about saliva.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No, no, no, but that we know,</p>
<p>that we can figure it out easily.</p>
<p>But the question is whether or not the saliva</p>
<p>in a fed state is distinct from the saliva</p>
<p>in an unfed state, such that it modulates-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The sensitivity of the receptors.</p>
<p>That experiment has been done, no.</p>
<p>It has been done.</p>
<p>And so the answer is no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And the way you could do the experiment</p>
<p>is because we use artificial saliva.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s such a thing?</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s artificial tears, but-</p>
<p>No, no, we, I don&rsquo;t mean that you go to Walgreens</p>
<p>and you get, I mean, we in my laboratory,</p>
<p>we know the composition of saliva,</p>
<p>and so you can make such a thing.</p>
<p>And you can take, you know, taste cells in culture</p>
<p>or in a tongue where you wash it out of,</p>
<p>and then you can apply artificial saliva.</p>
<p>And what happens is that the system</p>
<p>is being engineered to desensitize,</p>
<p>to become agnostic for saliva to become invisible.</p>
<p>And there is no difference on the state of the animal.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Well, this is the reason to do experiments.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t defeat any grand hypothesis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a pure curiosity.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Do you know that curiosity kills the cat, eh?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>But saves the career of a scientist.</p>
<p>Every single time.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s what drives us.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Every single time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the story of our lives.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Okay, so if it&rsquo;s not saliva, and apparently it is not,</p>
<p>what about internal state?</p>
<p>And what aspects of this, the internal milieu are relevant?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s autonomic, there&rsquo;s a sleep and awake,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s stress.</p>
<p>One of the questions that I got from hundreds of people</p>
<p>when I solicited questions was,</p>
<p>from hundreds of people when I solicited questions</p>
<p>in advance of this episode was,</p>
<p>why do I crave sugar when I&rsquo;m stressed, for instance?</p>
<p>And that could be contextual, but what are the basic-</p>
<p>Because it makes us feel good, by the way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to that.</p>
<p>Soothing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the answer.</p>
<p>Soothing.</p>
<p>It activates what I&rsquo;m going to generically refer to</p>
<p>as reward pleasure centers</p>
<p>in a way that it dramatically changes our internal state.</p>
<p>This is, you know, why do we eat a gallon of ice cream</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re very depressed?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In fact, this is a good segue to go</p>
<p>into this entirely different world, yeah,</p>
<p>of the body telling your brain what you need</p>
<p>in important things like sugar and fat, yeah?</p>
<p>Okay, but anyways, go ahead.</p>
<p>You were going to ask something.</p>
<p>Well, no, I would like to discuss the most basic elements</p>
<p>of internal state, in particular,</p>
<p>the ones that are below our conscious detection.</p>
<p>And this is a, of course, is a segue</p>
<p>into this incredible landscape,</p>
<p>which is the gut-brain axis,</p>
<p>which I think 15 years ago was almost a,</p>
<p>maybe it was a couple posters at a meeting,</p>
<p>and then now I believe you and others,</p>
<p>there are companies, there are active research programs,</p>
<p>and beautiful work.</p>
<p>Maybe you could describe some of that work</p>
<p>that you and others have been involved in.</p>
<p>And a lot of the listeners of this podcast</p>
<p>will have heard of the gut-brain axis,</p>
<p>and there are a lot of misconceptions</p>
<p>about the gut-brain axis.</p>
<p>Many people think that this means</p>
<p>that we think with our stomach</p>
<p>because of the quote-unquote gut feeling aspect,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love for you to talk about the aspects</p>
<p>of gut-brain signaling that drive our,</p>
<p>or change our perceptions and behaviors</p>
<p>that are completely beneath our awareness.</p>
<p>Yes, excellent.</p>
<p>So let me begin maybe by stating that,</p>
<p>you know, the brain needs to monitor</p>
<p>the state of every one of our organs.</p>
<p>It has to do it.</p>
<p>This is the only way that the brain can ensure</p>
<p>that every one of those organs are working together</p>
<p>in a way that we have healthy physiology.</p>
<p>Now, this monitoring of the brain</p>
<p>has been known for a long time,</p>
<p>but I think what hadn&rsquo;t been fully appreciated</p>
<p>that this is a two-way highway</p>
<p>where the brain is not only monitoring,</p>
<p>but is now modulating back what the body needs to do.</p>
<p>And that includes all the way from monitoring</p>
<p>the frequency of heartbeats</p>
<p>and the way that inspiration and aspirations</p>
<p>in the breathing cycle operate</p>
<p>to what happens when you ingest sugar and fat.</p>
<p>Now, let me give you an example again</p>
<p>of how the brain can take</p>
<p>what we would refer to contextual associations</p>
<p>and transform it into incredible changes</p>
<p>in physiology and metabolism.</p>
<p>Remember Pavlov?</p>
<p>So Pavlov in his classical experiments</p>
<p>in conditioning, you know, associative conditioning,</p>
<p>he would take a bell,</p>
<p>it would ring the bell</p>
<p>every time he was going to feed the dog.</p>
<p>And eventually the dog learned to associate</p>
<p>the ringing of the bell with food coming.</p>
<p>Now, the first incredible finding he made</p>
<p>is the fact that the dog now,</p>
<p>in the presence of the bell alone,</p>
<p>will start to salivate.</p>
<p>And we will call that, you know, neurologically speaking,</p>
<p>an anticipatory response.</p>
<p>Okay, I could understand it.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>You know, neurons in the brain that form that association</p>
<p>now represent food is coming</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re sending a signal to motor neurons</p>
<p>to go into your salivary glands to squeeze them</p>
<p>so you release, you know, saliva</p>
<p>because you know food is coming.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s even more remarkable</p>
<p>is that those animals are also releasing insulin</p>
<p>in response to a bell.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This illustrates one part of this two-way highway,</p>
<p>the highway going down.</p>
<p>Somehow the brain created these associations</p>
<p>and there are neurons in your brain now</p>
<p>that know food is coming</p>
<p>and send a signal somehow all the way down to your pancreas</p>
<p>that now it says release insulin</p>
<p>because sugar is coming down.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>This goes back to the magic of the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a never ending source of both joy and intrigue.</p>
<p>How the hell do they do this?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, the neurons, eh?</p>
<p>I share your delight and fascination.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a day or a lecture</p>
<p>or some talks are better than others</p>
<p>or a talk where I don&rsquo;t sit back</p>
<p>and just think it&rsquo;s absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Now over the past, I don&rsquo;t know, dozen years,</p>
<p>and with great force over the last five years.</p>
<p>Now the main highway that is communicating</p>
<p>the state of the body with the brain,</p>
<p>it has been uncovered as being</p>
<p>what we now refer to as the gut-brain axis.</p>
<p>And the highway is a specific bundle of nerves,</p>
<p>you know, which emerge from the vagal ganglia.</p>
<p>They know those ganglia.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s the vagus nerve</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s innervating the majority</p>
<p>of the organs in your body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s monitoring their function,</p>
<p>sending a signal to the brain,</p>
<p>and now the brain going back down and saying,</p>
<p>this is going all right, do this,</p>
<p>or this is not going so well, do that.</p>
<p>And I should point out, as you well know,</p>
<p>every organ, spleen, pancreas, lungs.</p>
<p>They all must be monitored.</p>
<p>In fact, you know, I now,</p>
<p>I have no doubt that diseases</p>
<p>that we abnormally associated with metabolism, physiology,</p>
<p>and even immunity are likely to emerge</p>
<p>as diseases, conditions, states of the brain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think obesity is a disease of metabolism.</p>
<p>I believe obesity is a disease of brain circuits.</p>
<p>I do as well.</p>
<p>And so this view that we have, you know,</p>
<p>been working on for the longest time,</p>
<p>because, you know, the molecules that we&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>are in the body, not in the head,</p>
<p>you know, led us to view, of course,</p>
<p>these issues and problems as being one</p>
<p>of metabolism, physiology, and so forth.</p>
<p>They remain to be the carriers of the ultimate signal,</p>
<p>but the brain ultimately appears to be the conductor</p>
<p>of this orchestra of physiology and metabolism.</p>
<p>All right, now let&rsquo;s go to the gut, brain, and sugar.</p>
<p>May we?</p>
<p>Please, please.</p>
<p>No, I mean, the vagus nerve has, in popular culture,</p>
<p>has been kind of converted</p>
<p>into this single meaning of calming pathways,</p>
<p>mostly because I actually have to tip my hat</p>
<p>to the yogic community was among the first</p>
<p>to talk about vagus on and on and on.</p>
<p>It, there are calming pathways of, you know,</p>
<p>so-called parasympathetic pathways within the vagus,</p>
<p>but I think that the more we learn about the vagus,</p>
<p>the more it seems like an entire set of neural connections</p>
<p>as opposed to one nerve.</p>
<p>I just wanted to just mention that</p>
<p>because I think a lot of people have heard about the vagus.</p>
<p>It turns out experimentally in the laboratory,</p>
<p>many neuroscientists will stimulate the vagus</p>
<p>to create states of alertness and arousal</p>
<p>when animals or even people, believe it or not,</p>
<p>are close to dying or going into coma.</p>
<p>Stimulation of the vagus is one of the ways</p>
<p>to wake up the brain, counter to the idea</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just this way of calming oneself down.</p>
<p>And also, of course, I mean,</p>
<p>one has to be cautious there in that.</p>
<p>So the vagus nerve is made out of many thousands of fibers,</p>
<p>you know, individual fibers that make this gigantic bundle.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s likely, as we&rsquo;re speaking,</p>
<p>that each of these fibers carries</p>
<p>a slightly different meaning, okay?</p>
<p>Not necessarily one by one, maybe five fibers,</p>
<p>10 fibers, 20 do the, all right.</p>
<p>But they carry meaning that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with their specific task.</p>
<p>This group of fibers is telling the brain</p>
<p>about the state of your heart.</p>
<p>This group of fiber is telling the brain</p>
<p>about the state of your gut.</p>
<p>This is telling your brain about its nutritional state.</p>
<p>This, your pancreas.</p>
<p>This, your lungs.</p>
<p>And they are, again, to make the same simple example,</p>
<p>the keys of this piano, okay?</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right, there is a lot of data</p>
<p>showing that activating the entire vagal bundle</p>
<p>has very meaningful effects in a wide range of conditions.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s being used to treat untractable depression.</p>
<p>Those stimulator.</p>
<p>Epileptic seizures.</p>
<p>But again, there are thousands of fibers</p>
<p>carrying different functions.</p>
<p>So to some degree, you know, this is like</p>
<p>turning the lights on the stadium</p>
<p>because you need to illuminate</p>
<p>where you lost your keys under your seat.</p>
<p>Yet 10,000 bulbs of 1,000 watts each have just come on.</p>
<p>Only one of these is pointing to work.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m lucky enough that one of them</p>
<p>happened to point to my site.</p>
<p>So here you activate the bundle, thousands of fibers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky enough that some of those happen to do something</p>
<p>to make a meaningful difference in depression</p>
<p>or to make a meaningful difference in epileptic.</p>
<p>But it should not be misconstrued</p>
<p>as arguing that this broad activation</p>
<p>has any type of selectivity or specificity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just lucky enough that among all the things</p>
<p>that are being done,</p>
<p>some of those happen to change the biology</p>
<p>of these processes.</p>
<p>Now, the reason this is relevant</p>
<p>because the magic of this gut-brain axis</p>
<p>is the fact that you have these thousands of fibers</p>
<p>really doing different functions.</p>
<p>And our goal, and along with many other great scientists,</p>
<p>including Steve Liverless,</p>
<p>that started a lot of this molecular dissection</p>
<p>on this vagal gut-brain communication line at Harvard,</p>
<p>is trying to uncover what are each of those lines doing?</p>
<p>What are each of those keys of this piano playing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the latest there, just as a brief update?</p>
<p>I know Stephen Lee released,</p>
<p>I think I was there when he got his Howard Hughes</p>
<p>and I did not, so that was fun.</p>
<p>Always great to get beat by excellent people.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m happy you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because that way you can focus on this amazing podcast.</p>
<p>Well, thank you, that&rsquo;s very gracious of you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always feels better, if not good,</p>
<p>to get beat out by excellent people.</p>
<p>Stephen is second to none.</p>
<p>And he is defining, as you said,</p>
<p>the molecular constituents of different elements</p>
<p>of these many, many fibers.</p>
<p>Is there an update there?</p>
<p>Are they finding multiple parallel pathways?</p>
<p>They are, they are.</p>
<p>Some that control heartbeat,</p>
<p>some that control the respiratory cycle,</p>
<p>some that might be involved in a gastric movement.</p>
<p>You know, this notion that you are full</p>
<p>and you feel full in part</p>
<p>because your gut gets distended,</p>
<p>your stomach, for example.</p>
<p>And then there are little sensors that are reading that</p>
<p>and telling the brain, you&rsquo;re full.</p>
<p>So the textbooks will soon change</p>
<p>on the basis of the Lieberle&rsquo;s and other work.</p>
<p>In essence, I think we are learning enough</p>
<p>about these lines</p>
<p>that could really help put together this holistic view</p>
<p>of how the brain, it&rsquo;s truly changing body physiology,</p>
<p>metabolism and immunity.</p>
<p>The part that hasn&rsquo;t been yet developed</p>
<p>and that it needs a fair amount of work,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an exciting, thrilling journey of discovery</p>
<p>is how the signal comes back to now change that biology.</p>
<p>You know, the example I gave you before</p>
<p>with Pavlov&rsquo;s dog, yeah?</p>
<p>All right, I figure out, you know,</p>
<p>how the association created this link between the bell,</p>
<p>but then how does the brain tell the pancreas</p>
<p>to release in the right amount of insulin?</p>
<p>Okay, so tell me, let me tell you</p>
<p>about the gut-brain axis</p>
<p>and our insatiable appetite for sugar and fat.</p>
<p>Insatiable for sugar and quenchable for fat.</p>
<p>And this is a story about the fundamental difference</p>
<p>between liking and wanting.</p>
<p>Liking sugar is the function of the taste system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not really liking sugar, it&rsquo;s liking sweet.</p>
<p>Wanting sugar, our never ending appetite for sugar</p>
<p>is the story of the gut-brain axis.</p>
<p>Liking versus wanting.</p>
<p>And this work is work of my own laboratory,</p>
<p>you know, that began long ago</p>
<p>when we discovered the sweet receptors.</p>
<p>And you can now engineer mice that lack these receptors.</p>
<p>So in essence, these animals will be unable to taste sweet.</p>
<p>A life without sweetness, how horrible, okay?</p>
<p>And if you give a normal mouse a bottle containing sweet,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna put either sugar</p>
<p>or an artificial sweetener, all right?</p>
<p>They both are sweet.</p>
<p>They have slightly different tastes,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s simply because artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>have some off tastes.</p>
<p>But as far as the sweet receptor is concerned,</p>
<p>they both activate the same receptor,</p>
<p>trigger the same signal.</p>
<p>And if you give an animal an option</p>
<p>of a bottle containing sugar or a sweetener versus water,</p>
<p>this animal will drink 10 to one</p>
<p>from the bottle containing sweet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the taste system.</p>
<p>Animal goes, samples each one, licks a couple of licks,</p>
<p>and then says, uh-uh, that&rsquo;s the one I want</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s appetitive and because I love it.</p>
<p>So it prefers sugar to artificial sweetener.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Equally artificial sweetener.</p>
<p>In this experiment, I&rsquo;m gonna put only sweet in one bottle,</p>
<p>and it could be either sugar or artificial sweetener.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which one.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re gonna do the next experiment</p>
<p>where we separate those two.</p>
<p>For now, it&rsquo;s sweet versus water.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And sweet means sweet, not sugar.</p>
<p>Sweet means anything that tastes sweet, all right?</p>
<p>And sugar is one example, and Splenda is another example.</p>
<p>Aspartame, monk fruit.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s some that only humans can taste.</p>
<p>Mice cannot taste because their receptors</p>
<p>between humans and mice are different.</p>
<p>But we have put the human receptor into mice.</p>
<p>We engineer mice, and we completely humanize</p>
<p>this mouse&rsquo;s taste world, all right?</p>
<p>But for the purpose of this conversation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only comparing sweet versus water.</p>
<p>An option, my goodness, they will leak to know</p>
<p>from the sweet side, 10 to one at least versus the water.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re gonna take the mice,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna genetically engineer it</p>
<p>to remove the sweet receptors.</p>
<p>So these mice no longer have in their oral cavity</p>
<p>any sensors that can detect sweetness,</p>
<p>be it a sugar molecule, be it an artificial sweetener,</p>
<p>be it anything else that tastes sweet.</p>
<p>And if you give these mice an option</p>
<p>between sweet versus water, sugar versus water,</p>
<p>artificial sweetener versus water,</p>
<p>it will drink equally well from both</p>
<p>because it cannot tell them apart</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have the receptors for sweet</p>
<p>so that sweet bottle tastes just like water.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re gonna do the experiment with sugar.</p>
<p>From now on, let&rsquo;s focus on sugar.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna give a mouse now sugar versus water.</p>
<p>Normal mouse would drink from the sugar,</p>
<p>sugar, sugar, sugar, very little from the water.</p>
<p>Knock out the sweet receptors, eliminate them.</p>
<p>Mouse can no longer tell them apart,</p>
<p>and it will drink from both.</p>
<p>But if I keep the mouse in that cage</p>
<p>for the next 48 hours,</p>
<p>something extraordinary happens when I come 48 hours later</p>
<p>and I see what the mouse is licking or drinking from.</p>
<p>That mouse is drinking almost exclusively</p>
<p>from the sugar bottle.</p>
<p>How could this be?</p>
<p>He cannot taste it.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have sweet receptors.</p>
<p>During those 48 hours,</p>
<p>the mouse learn that there is something in that bottle</p>
<p>that makes me feel good.</p>
<p>And that is the bottle I want to consume.</p>
<p>Now, how does the mouse identify that bottle?</p>
<p>It does so by using other sensory features.</p>
<p>The smell of the bottle,</p>
<p>the texture of the solution inside.</p>
<p>Sugar at high concentrations is kind of goopy.</p>
<p>The sideness in which the bottle is in the cage,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what,</p>
<p>but the mouse realized there is something there</p>
<p>that makes me feel good, and that&rsquo;s what I want.</p>
<p>And that is the fundamental basis</p>
<p>of our unquenchable desire and our craving for sugar</p>
<p>and is mediated by the gut-brain axis.</p>
<p>The first clue is that it takes a long time to develop.</p>
<p>Immediately suggesting a post-ingestive effect.</p>
<p>So we reason if this is true,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the gut-brain axis</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s driving sugar preference,</p>
<p>then there should be a group of neurons in the brain</p>
<p>that are responding to post-ingestive sugar.</p>
<p>And lo and behold,</p>
<p>we identify a group of neurons in the brain that does this,</p>
<p>and these neurons receive their input</p>
<p>directly from the gut-brain axis.</p>
<p>From other neurons.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s happening is that sugar</p>
<p>is recognized normally by the tongue,</p>
<p>activates an appetitive response.</p>
<p>Now you ingest it,</p>
<p>and now it activates a selective group of cells</p>
<p>in your intestines that now send a signal</p>
<p>to the brain via the vagal ganglia</p>
<p>that says, I got what I need.</p>
<p>The tongue doesn&rsquo;t know that you got what you need.</p>
<p>It only knows that you tasted it.</p>
<p>This knows that you got to the point</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to be used, which is the gut.</p>
<p>And now it sends the signal to now reinforce</p>
<p>the consumption of this thing,</p>
<p>because this is the one that I needed.</p>
<p>Sugar, source of energy.</p>
<p>Are these neurons in the gut?</p>
<p>So these are not neurons in the gut.</p>
<p>So these are gut cells that recognize the sugar molecule,</p>
<p>send a signal, and that signal is received</p>
<p>by the vagal neuron directly.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And this sends a signal through the gut-brain axis</p>
<p>to the cell bodies of these neurons in the vagal ganglia.</p>
<p>And from there to the brain stem</p>
<p>to now trigger the preference for sugar.</p>
<p>Two questions.</p>
<p>One, you mentioned that these cells</p>
<p>that detect sugar within the gut</p>
<p>are actually within the intestine.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t say stomach, which surprised me.</p>
<p>I always think gut as stomach, but of course, intestines.</p>
<p>Their intestine, because that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>all the absorption happens.</p>
<p>So you want the signal.</p>
<p>You see, you want the brain to know</p>
<p>that you had successful ingestion and breakdown</p>
<p>of whatever you consume into the building blocks of life.</p>
<p>And you know, glucose, amino acids, fat.</p>
<p>And so you want to make sure that once they are in the form</p>
<p>that the intestines can now absorb them</p>
<p>is where you get the signal back saying,</p>
<p>this is what I want.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Now, let me just take it one step further.</p>
<p>And this now sugar molecules activates</p>
<p>this unique gut brain circuit</p>
<p>that now drives the development of our preference for sugar.</p>
<p>Now, a key element of this circuit</p>
<p>is that the sensors in the gut that recognize the sugar</p>
<p>do not recognize artificial sweeteners at all,</p>
<p>because their nutrient value is uncoupled from the taste.</p>
<p>Generically speaking, one can make that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a very different type of receptor.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Turns out that it&rsquo;s not the tongue receptors</p>
<p>being used in the gut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a completely different molecule</p>
<p>that only recognizes the glucose molecule,</p>
<p>not artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>This has a profound impact on the effect of ultimately</p>
<p>artificial sweeteners in curbing our appetite,</p>
<p>our craving, our insatiable desire for sugar.</p>
<p>Since they don&rsquo;t activate the gut brain axis,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll never satisfy the craving for sugar like sugar does.</p>
<p>And the reason I believe that artificial sweeteners</p>
<p>are failing the market to curb our appetite</p>
<p>or need our desire for sugar</p>
<p>is because they beautifully work on the tongue,</p>
<p>the liking to recognize sweet versus non-sweet,</p>
<p>but they fail to activate the key sensors in the gut</p>
<p>that now inform the brain,</p>
<p>you got sugar, no need to crave anymore.</p>
<p>So the issue of wanting,</p>
<p>can we relate that to a particular set of neurochemicals</p>
<p>upstream of, so the pathway is,</p>
<p>so glucose is activating the cells in the gut</p>
<p>through the vagus that&rsquo;s communicated</p>
<p>through presumably the no-dose ganglion</p>
<p>and up into the brainstem.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>And from there, where does it go?</p>
<p>Yeah, where is it going?</p>
<p>What is the substrate of wanting?</p>
<p>I, you know, of course I think molecules like dopamine,</p>
<p>craving, there&rsquo;s a book even called</p>
<p>The Molecule of More, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a very diabolical molecule, as you know,</p>
<p>because it evokes both a sense of pleasure-ish,</p>
<p>but also a sense of desiring more, of craving.</p>
<p>So if I understand you correctly,</p>
<p>artificial sweeteners are, and I agree,</p>
<p>are failing as a means to satisfy sugar craving</p>
<p>at the level of nutrient sensing.</p>
<p>And yet if we trigger this true sugar evoked</p>
<p>wanting pathway too much, and we&rsquo;ve all experienced this,</p>
<p>then we eat sugar and we find ourselves</p>
<p>wanting more and more sugar.</p>
<p>Now that could also be insulin dysregulation,</p>
<p>but can we uncouple those?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look,</p>
<p>if we have a mega problem with overconsumption of sugar,</p>
<p>and fat, we&rsquo;re facing a unique time in our evolution</p>
<p>where diseases of malnutrition are due to overnutrition.</p>
<p>I mean, how nuts is that, eh?</p>
<p>I mean, historically, diseases of malnutrition</p>
<p>have always been linked to undernutrition, okay?</p>
<p>And so we need to come up with strategies</p>
<p>that can meaningfully change</p>
<p>the activation of these circuits that control our wanting,</p>
<p>certainly in the populations at risk.</p>
<p>And this gut-brain circuit that ultimately,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s the lines of communication</p>
<p>that are informing the brain,</p>
<p>the presence of intestinal sugar in this example,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very important target in the way we think about,</p>
<p>is there a way that we can meaningfully modulate</p>
<p>these circuits?</p>
<p>So I make your brain think that you got satisfied</p>
<p>with sugar, even though I&rsquo;m not giving you sugar.</p>
<p>So that immediately raises the question,</p>
<p>are the receptors for glucose in these gut cells</p>
<p>susceptible to other things that are healthier for us?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very good, excellent idea.</p>
<p>And I think an important goal will be to come up</p>
<p>with a strategy and identify those very means</p>
<p>that allow us to modulate the circuits in a way</p>
<p>that certainly for all of those where this is a big issue,</p>
<p>it can really have a dramatic impact</p>
<p>in improving human health.</p>
<p>I could be wrong about this, and I&rsquo;m happy to be wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often wrong and told I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>that we have cells within our gut</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t just sense sugar, glucose, to be specific,</p>
<p>but also cells within our gut that sense amino acids</p>
<p>and fatty acids.</p>
<p>I could imagine a scenario where one could train themselves</p>
<p>to feel immense amounts of satiety</p>
<p>from the consumption of foods that are rich</p>
<p>in essential fatty acids, amino acids,</p>
<p>perhaps less caloric or less insulin dysregulating</p>
<p>than sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use myself as an example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed sweets, but in the last few years,</p>
<p>for some reason, I&rsquo;ve started to lose my appetite for them,</p>
<p>probably because I just don&rsquo;t eat them anymore.</p>
<p>At first, that took some restriction.</p>
<p>Now, I just don&rsquo;t even think about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you&rsquo;re not reinforcing the circuits.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re in essence are removing yourself,</p>
<p>but you tend to be the exception.</p>
<p>You know, we have a huge,</p>
<p>a huge, incredibly large number of people</p>
<p>that are being continuously exposed</p>
<p>to highly processed foods.</p>
<p>And hidden, so-called hidden sugars.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even have to be hidden.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s right there.</p>
<p>Hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>So much is made of hidden sugars</p>
<p>that we often overlook that they are,</p>
<p>there are also the overt sugars.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we can have a long discussion</p>
<p>on the importance of coming up with strategies,</p>
<p>that could meaningfully change public health</p>
<p>when it comes to nutrition.</p>
<p>But I wanna just go back to the notion of,</p>
<p>these brain centers that are ultimately</p>
<p>the ones that are being activated</p>
<p>by these essential nutrients.</p>
<p>So sugar, fat, and amino acids are building blocks</p>
<p>of our diets.</p>
<p>And this is across all animal species.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not unreasonable then to assume</p>
<p>that dedicated brain circuits would have evolved</p>
<p>to ensure their recognition,</p>
<p>their ingestion, and the reinforcement</p>
<p>that that is what I need.</p>
<p>And indeed, you know, animals evolve these two systems.</p>
<p>One is the taste system that allows you to recognize them</p>
<p>and trigger this predetermined hardwire</p>
<p>immediate responses, yes?</p>
<p>Oh my goodness, this tastes so good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so sweet.</p>
<p>I personally have a sweet tooth, may I add.</p>
<p>And you know, oh my God, this is so delicious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fatty or umami recognizing amino acids.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the liking pathway, yeah?</p>
<p>But in the wisdom of evolution,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good, but doesn&rsquo;t quite do it.</p>
<p>You wanna make sure that these things get to the place</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re needed.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not needed in your tongue.</p>
<p>They are needed in your intestines</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re going to be absorbed</p>
<p>as the nutrients that will support life.</p>
<p>And the brain wants to know this.</p>
<p>And he wants to know it in a way</p>
<p>that he can now form the association</p>
<p>between that that I just tasted</p>
<p>is what got where it needs to be,</p>
<p>and it makes me feel good.</p>
<p>And so now, next time that I have to choose</p>
<p>what should I eat, that association</p>
<p>now guides me to that&rsquo;s the one I want.</p>
<p>I want that fruit, not that fruit.</p>
<p>I want those leaves, not those leaves,</p>
<p>because these are the ones that activate the right circuits</p>
<p>that ensure that the right nutrients</p>
<p>got to the right place and told the brain,</p>
<p>this is what I want and need.</p>
<p>Are we on?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>One thing that intrigues me and puzzles me</p>
<p>is that this effect took a couple of days,</p>
<p>at least in mice.</p>
<p>And the sensation, sorry, the perception of taste</p>
<p>is immediate, and yet this is a slow system.</p>
<p>And so in a beautiful way,</p>
<p>but in a kind of mysterious way,</p>
<p>the brain is able to couple the taste of a sweet drink</p>
<p>with the experience of nutrient extraction in the gut</p>
<p>under a context where the mouse and the human</p>
<p>is presumably ingesting other things,</p>
<p>smelling other mice, smelling other people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you have to think of it</p>
<p>not as humans.</p>
<p>Remember, we inherited the circuits of our ancestors</p>
<p>and they, through evolutionary, from their ancestors.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t had that many years</p>
<p>to have fundamentally changed</p>
<p>in many of these hard wire circuits.</p>
<p>So forget as humans, let&rsquo;s look at animals in the wild, okay?</p>
<p>Which is easier now to comprehend the logic.</p>
<p>Why should this take a long time of continual reinforcement</p>
<p>given that I can taste it in a second?</p>
<p>You wanna make sure that this source of sugar,</p>
<p>for example, in the wild is the best, is the richest,</p>
<p>is the one where I get the most energy</p>
<p>for the least amount of extraction,</p>
<p>the least amount of work.</p>
<p>I wanna identify rich sources of sugar.</p>
<p>And if the system simply responds immediately</p>
<p>to the first sugar that gets to your gut,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna form the association</p>
<p>with those sources of food,</p>
<p>which are not the ones that you should be eating from.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fall in love with the first person you encounter.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness, exactly.</p>
<p>And so evolutionarily, by having the taste system</p>
<p>giving you the immediate recognition,</p>
<p>but then by forcing this gut-brain axis</p>
<p>to reinforce it only when sustained in a repeated exposure</p>
<p>has informed the brain, this is the one</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna form the association before.</p>
<p>And so, when we remove it from the context of,</p>
<p>we just go to the supermarket,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not hunting there in the wild where I need to form.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s happening is that highly processed foods</p>
<p>are hijacking, co-opting the circuits in a way</p>
<p>that it would have never happened in nature.</p>
<p>And then we not only find these things appetitive</p>
<p>and palatable, but in addition,</p>
<p>we are continuously reinforcing the wanting</p>
<p>in a way that, oh my God, this is so great.</p>
<p>What do I feel like eating?</p>
<p>Let me have more of this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve just forever changed the way</p>
<p>that I think about supermarkets and restaurants.</p>
<p>Their understanding this fast signaling</p>
<p>and this slower signaling and the utility of having both</p>
<p>makes me realize that supermarkets and restaurants</p>
<p>are about the most unnatural thing for our system ever.</p>
<p>Almost the equivalent of living in small villages</p>
<p>with very few suitable mates</p>
<p>versus online dating, for instance.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m not gonna make a judgment call there</p>
<p>because they do serve an important purpose.</p>
<p>I like restaurants too.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so do supermarkets, thank God.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re not the culprits.</p>
<p>I think the culprits, of course,</p>
<p>are reliance on foods that are not necessarily healthy.</p>
<p>Now, going back to the supermarket,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fall in love with the first, they need to work.</p>
<p>You know, you take a tangerine</p>
<p>and you take an extract of tangerine</p>
<p>that you use to cook that spike, let&rsquo;s say with sugar,</p>
<p>and you equalize in both</p>
<p>where they both provide the same amount of calories.</p>
<p>If you eat them both,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have a very different effect</p>
<p>in your gut-brain axis and your system.</p>
<p>Once you make the extract and you process it</p>
<p>and you add it, process sugar, you know,</p>
<p>to use it now to cook, to add,</p>
<p>to make it really sweet tangerine thing.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;re providing now a fully ready-to-use</p>
<p>broken down source of sugar.</p>
<p>In the tangerine, that sugar is mixed in the complexity</p>
<p>of a whole set of other chemical components,</p>
<p>fiber, long chains of sugar molecules</p>
<p>that need a huge amount of work by your stomach,</p>
<p>your gut system, to break it down.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re using a huge amount of energy</p>
<p>to extract energy.</p>
<p>And the balance, it&rsquo;s very different</p>
<p>that when I take this process, highly extracted tangerine,</p>
<p>by the way, I use tangerines</p>
<p>because I had a tangerine just before I came here.</p>
<p>Delicious.</p>
<p>They are delicious.</p>
<p>And so this goes back to the issue of supermarkets.</p>
<p>And so to some degree, you know, A, given a choice,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to eat processed, highly processed foods</p>
<p>because everything&rsquo;s already been broken down for you.</p>
<p>And so your system has no work.</p>
<p>And so you are co-opting, hijacking the circuits</p>
<p>in a way that they&rsquo;re being activated at a timescale</p>
<p>that normally wouldn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>This is why I often feel that,</p>
<p>and I think a lot of data are now starting</p>
<p>to support the idea that while indeed</p>
<p>the laws of thermodynamics apply,</p>
<p>calories ingested versus calories burned</p>
<p>is a very real thing, right?</p>
<p>That the appetite for certain foods</p>
<p>and the wanting and the liking</p>
<p>are phenomena of the nervous system,</p>
<p>brain and gut, as you&rsquo;ve beautifully described,</p>
<p>and that that changes over time</p>
<p>depending on how we are receiving these nutrients.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Look, we have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking as a society.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about you and I.</p>
<p>We also have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>Now, I think understanding the circuits</p>
<p>is giving us important insights</p>
<p>and how ultimately, hopefully,</p>
<p>we can improve human health</p>
<p>and make a meaningful difference.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s very easy to try to connect the dots,</p>
<p>A to B, B to C, C to D.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot more complexity to it,</p>
<p>but I do think that the lessons that are emerging</p>
<p>out of understanding how the circuits operate</p>
<p>can ultimately inform how we deal with our diets</p>
<p>in a way that we avoid what we&rsquo;re facing now,</p>
<p>you know, as a society.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s nuts that overnutrition</p>
<p>happens to be such a prevalent problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I also think the training of people</p>
<p>who are thinking about metabolic science</p>
<p>and metabolic disease is largely divorced</p>
<p>from the training of the neuroscientists and vice versa.</p>
<p>No one field is to blame,</p>
<p>but I fully agree that the brain is the key</p>
<p>or the nervous system, to be more accurate,</p>
<p>is one of the key overlooked features.</p>
<p>Is the arbiter, ultimately is the arbiter</p>
<p>of many of these pathways.</p>
<p>As a final question and one which is simply</p>
<p>to entertain my curiosity</p>
<p>and the curiosity of the listeners,</p>
<p>what is your absolute favorite food?</p>
<p>Oh my goodness.</p>
<p>Taste, I should say.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Taste, to distinguish between taste</p>
<p>and the nutritive value or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Yes, look, we, unlike every other animal species,</p>
<p>eat for the enjoyment of it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen in the wild.</p>
<p>Most animals eat when they need to eat.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t enjoy it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a completely different story, yeah?</p>
<p>I have too many favorite foods</p>
<p>because I enjoy the sensory experience, yeah?</p>
<p>Rather than the food itself, to me, it&rsquo;s the whole thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from the present.</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;ve been these experiments done</p>
<p>in psychophysics, yeah?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take a salad made out of 11 components</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna mix them all up in a potpourri of greens</p>
<p>and other things here.</p>
<p>And in the other one,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna present it in a beautiful arrangement</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna put it behind a glass cabinet</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna sell them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna sell one for $2 and one for $8.</p>
<p>Precisely the same ingredient,</p>
<p>exactly the same amount of each.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you&rsquo;re gonna mix them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all gonna be the same.</p>
<p>And people will pay the $8 because, you know what?</p>
<p>It evokes a different person, okay?</p>
<p>It gives you the feel that, oh my goodness,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna enjoy that salad.</p>
<p>So going back to what is my favorite food.</p>
<p>To me, eating is really a sensory journey.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean the every day, let me have some, you know,</p>
<p>chicken wings because I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>
<p>But every piece, I think,</p>
<p>has an important evoking sensory role.</p>
<p>And so, you know, in terms of food,</p>
<p>and so, you know, in terms of categories of food,</p>
<p>you know, I grew up in Chile,</p>
<p>yes, so meat is always been,</p>
<p>but I eat it so seldom now.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, because, you know,</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s not necessarily the healthiest thing,</p>
<p>red meat I&rsquo;m talking about, yeah?</p>
<p>And so I, you know, I grew up eating it every day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking seven days a week, Chile and Argentina,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s the mainstay of our diet, yeah?</p>
<p>Now maybe I have red meat, I know,</p>
<p>once every four weeks.</p>
<p>And you enjoy it.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it.</p>
<p>Part of it is because I haven&rsquo;t had it in four weeks.</p>
<p>But, you know, I love sushi,</p>
<p>but I love the art of sushi.</p>
<p>You know, the whole thing, you know,</p>
<p>the way it&rsquo;s presented, it changes the way you taste it.</p>
<p>I love ethnic food, in particular.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the right place.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>That was the main reason I wanted to come to New York.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also that Columbia University that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>I came here because I wanted to be with, you know,</p>
<p>people that are thinking about the brain</p>
<p>the same way that I like to think,</p>
<p>which, you know, can we solve this big problem,</p>
<p>this big question?</p>
<p>And certainly you&rsquo;re making amazing strides</p>
<p>in that direction.</p>
<p>And I love your answer because it really brings together</p>
<p>the many features of the circuitries</p>
<p>and the phenomena we&rsquo;ve been talking about today,</p>
<p>which is that while it begins with sensation and perception,</p>
<p>ultimately it&rsquo;s the context,</p>
<p>and that context is highly individual to person,</p>
<p>place, and time, and many, many other things.</p>
<p>On behalf of myself,</p>
<p>and certainly on behalf of all the listeners,</p>
<p>I want to thank you.</p>
<p>First of all, for the incredible work</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been doing now for decades in vision, in taste,</p>
<p>and in this bigger issue of how we perceive</p>
<p>and experience life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly pioneering and incredible work.</p>
<p>And I feel quite lucky to have been on the sidelines</p>
<p>seeing this over the years and hearing the talks</p>
<p>and reading the countless beautiful papers,</p>
<p>but also for your time today to come down here</p>
<p>and talk to us about what drives you</p>
<p>and the discoveries you&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>Thank you ever so much.</p>
<p>It was great fun.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do it again.</p>
<p>Wish all.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me today</p>
<p>for my discussion about perception,</p>
<p>and in particular, the perception of taste</p>
