<p>and the significance</p>
<p>of course is that Eddie Bravo</p>
<p>our guest today actually invented the twister</p>
<p>no I didn&rsquo;t invent it</p>
<p>well you invented the wrestling setup</p>
<p>the setup the setups</p>
<p>yes the finishing move</p>
<p>no you call it wrestling mode</p>
<p>but people used to finish people with it in wrestling</p>
<p>you can but did they do it your way</p>
<p>with the S grip on the forehead</p>
<p>I thought that was all</p>
<p>like your your innovation to turn into a submission</p>
<p>uh no no no</p>
<p>people were cranking</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they were cranking it</p>
<p>exactly the way I crank it</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty sure</p>
<p>did you had you seen other people get submitted with it</p>
<p>before you ever started doing it</p>
<p>we would like to</p>
<p>in high school</p>
<p>I wrestled a couple years</p>
<p>and I wrestled in Santa Ana High</p>
<p>and in 9th grade</p>
<p>a guy named Jesse Barrios</p>
<p>and another guy</p>
<p>his buddy is the one who showed me</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember his name</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t even remember it for my book</p>
<p>but Jesse Barrios is his friend</p>
<p>Santana High School 1985</p>
<p>if anybody out there is from that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Jesse</p>
<p>vario&rsquo;s friend</p>
<p>the other leg rider on that wrestling team</p>
<p>fuck I don&rsquo;t know what his name was</p>
<p>anyways he showed it to me</p>
<p>and both of those</p>
<p>and in wrestling</p>
<p>leg riding is for weak people</p>
<p>and all that means is is we need</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so weak</p>
<p>we need to use our legs</p>
<p>a lot more than the big</p>
<p>strong dudes who were wrestling</p>
<p>and and hitting the weights</p>
<p>and had big chest and shoulders</p>
<p>those guys really didn&rsquo;t rely on their legs</p>
<p>as much as the weak guys like me</p>
<p>I would skip rest</p>
<p>weightlifting practice</p>
<p>I was in the back</p>
<p>where I was hiding</p>
<p>I was weak even back then</p>
<p>I was a terrible athlete</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a great athlete</p>
<p>so I had to rely on using my legs</p>
<p>and I thought you know</p>
<p>they came to me</p>
<p>Jesse came to me</p>
<p>and I go dude</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be perfect for this</p>
<p>you know because they knew I&rsquo;d just get smashed</p>
<p>if I try to go</p>
<p>a heads up with people</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a pinning move</p>
<p>that I learned in wrestling and</p>
<p>I got I got pretty good at it</p>
<p>I would that was my shit</p>
<p>even in high school</p>
<p>that was my</p>
<p>that was the thing</p>
<p>I always tried</p>
<p>I got some cool ass stories that maybe one day</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about them</p>
<p>but I have some cool wrestling stories</p>
<p>but anyways I sucked at wrestling</p>
<p>I only had one take down 2 fucking years I sucked</p>
<p>so I just totally relied on leg riding and</p>
<p>and using the it&rsquo;s actually called the guillotine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually not called the twister</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the guillotine</p>
<p>but when I started doing it in jiu jitsu</p>
<p>Higgin Machado</p>
<p>and Jean Jacques Machado would just call it the twister</p>
<p>because the guillotine already existed</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there that</p>
<p>that think that I&rsquo;d like took this wrestling move</p>
<p>and I said I&rsquo;m gonna try to fool the world</p>
<p>and change the name and say I invented it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s thousands of people that think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>in my books</p>
<p>from day one</p>
<p>I it was it was the</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being a little bit modest</p>
<p>because you invented all these setups</p>
<p>and turned it into a very high percentage finish</p>
<p>yes you invented a lot of setups</p>
<p>from a lot of different places</p>
<p>where it became</p>
<p>I mean none of that stuff existed</p>
<p>but this is the transition</p>
<p>so I ended up quitting wrestling the</p>
<p>work the work ethic</p>
<p>you need to be a good wrestler</p>
<p>something that is just not in my body chemistry</p>
<p>I was not made to work really hard physically</p>
<p>I just I hated work</p>
<p>regular jobs</p>
<p>I knew that&rsquo;s why it was all about Rockstardam</p>
<p>or playing football</p>
<p>I just wanted to be</p>
<p>like a famous dude who just played for a living</p>
<p>and got paid and was a fucking adored by everybody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I wanted</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to work</p>
<p>I hated work</p>
<p>of course who doesn&rsquo;t want oh my God</p>
<p>work actually killed me inside</p>
<p>so it drove my artistic side</p>
<p>so once I realized that Mexicans don&rsquo;t play football</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like oh my God</p>
<p>I was in 9th grade</p>
<p>and I was the slowest motherfucker out there</p>
<p>and that was it</p>
<p>you know I had these dreams of playing football</p>
<p>or making into music</p>
<p>that football was crushed in 9th grade</p>
<p>once everyone starts growing</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>Junior All Americans American and peewee football</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>I played defensive lineman and middle linebacker</p>
<p>in football</p>
<p>I actually thought I was gonna be a defensive lineman</p>
<p>and a middle linebacker</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re 8 and you&rsquo;re 9</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s the same size</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some brainwash going on</p>
<p>that really thought I was gonna be a football player</p>
<p>I really thought I was</p>
<p>until 9th grade</p>
<p>shit oh man</p>
<p>when I was in 6th grade</p>
<p>I was supposed to make the football team</p>
<p>cause in my neighborhood</p>
<p>in my neighborhood</p>
<p>I was pretty</p>
<p>I was a pretty good football player</p>
<p>around Mexicans from like</p>
<p>a really poor neighborhood</p>
<p>I was pretty badass</p>
<p>but when you go to school</p>
<p>when you go</p>
<p>when I went to 6th grade</p>
<p>and in junior</p>
<p>all American</p>
<p>when you know football</p>
<p>peewee football</p>
<p>I was pretty</p>
<p>I was pretty good</p>
<p>but once people start growing and start changing</p>
<p>in 6th grade</p>
<p>I went to 6th grade</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t make the football team</p>
<p>they cut me</p>
<p>I was supposed to be the football star from the</p>
<p>I was so embarrassing</p>
<p>but it was flag football</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t tackle</p>
<p>so in my head</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like wait till 9th grade</p>
<p>when I get to high school</p>
<p>i&rsquo;mma play some tackle</p>
<p>i&rsquo;mma show you</p>
<p>what the fuck&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what I was thinking that</p>
<p>I go fuck this year</p>
<p>fuck 6th grade</p>
<p>so 7th grade</p>
<p>I transferred myself to a far</p>
<p>a school far away</p>
<p>that I only went to cause</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another story</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more stories</p>
<p>where I was driven away from my junior high school</p>
<p>so I went to another school</p>
<p>tried out for the football team</p>
<p>in the 7th grade</p>
<p>I got cut again</p>
<p>but it was flag football</p>
<p>but I was so embarrassed</p>
<p>that I told</p>
<p>I told my friends growing up</p>
<p>all my kids</p>
<p>I told them that</p>
<p>yeah I made the team</p>
<p>second string quarterback</p>
<p>but you know what</p>
<p>I got in a fight</p>
<p>so they had to cut me</p>
<p>man it sucks</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the story</p>
<p>I told them</p>
<p>I told the kids that</p>
<p>I grew up with</p>
<p>thought I made the team</p>
<p>but I got cut</p>
<p>because I got in a fight with a dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>I kept that going</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so I was so embarrassed</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t make the team</p>
<p>I was so embarrassed</p>
<p>and then in the 8th grade</p>
<p>one of my the guys that I grew up with</p>
<p>went to that school too</p>
<p>he made the team</p>
<p>he was awesome</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make the team again</p>
<p>he never brought up the fact that</p>
<p>he never asked anybody</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t he make the team</p>
<p>last year that</p>
<p>never got brought up</p>
<p>they never humiliated me</p>
<p>maybe they were talking behind my back</p>
<p>like like I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I No one ever brought it up</p>
<p>but I did lie about it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m coming clean with it</p>
<p>now I totally lied about it</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think for dudes</p>
<p>that competition like that</p>
<p>any kind of competition</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s football</p>
<p>or wrestling</p>
<p>or anything</p>
<p>is it so important for kids</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re growing up</p>
<p>to know how hard it is</p>
<p>if you really wanna get good at something</p>
<p>oh yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>you gotta tell Mexicans</p>
<p>listen if you&rsquo;re Mexican</p>
<p>and you think you&rsquo;re gonna be a football player</p>
<p>look at reality</p>
<p>listen to me</p>
<p>look at reality</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not that very</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one Mexican</p>
<p>and he plays quarterback</p>
<p>you think you&rsquo;re gonna be him</p>
<p>get out of get out of football</p>
<p>get that shit out of your head</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re Mexican</p>
<p>unless you got some tall motherfuckers in your family</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple Mexicans out there</p>
<p>but what are the odds</p>
<p>can go ask us</p>
<p>could easily made it</p>
<p>as a maybe maybe</p>
<p>you think maybe</p>
<p>dude that could</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot more than just being an athlete</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s an athlete</p>
<p>in football</p>
<p>you gotta have some serious skills</p>
<p>and serious magic</p>
<p>yeah he could have just been a really strong</p>
<p>athletic guy there</p>
<p>look at Matt Mitchell</p>
<p>strong and athletic</p>
<p>not Mitchell</p>
<p>is a fucking athlete</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t so</p>
<p>do you think that</p>
<p>if those guys</p>
<p>came over to the UFC</p>
<p>those super athletes</p>
<p>those NFL dudes</p>
<p>do you think that</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re seeing with</p>
<p>like John Jones</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the talk</p>
<p>that you know</p>
<p>John Jones has 2 brothers</p>
<p>I believe that</p>
<p>are playing</p>
<p>football right now</p>
<p>I mean yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>I mean he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>super athlete</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s dudes that are</p>
<p>super athletes</p>
<p>that are in maybe</p>
<p>other sports</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re starting to see him in the UFC</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a big topic of discussion</p>
<p>like how much</p>
<p>of a difference does like</p>
<p>serious athleticism make</p>
<p>it makes a huge difference</p>
<p>hell yeah John</p>
<p>Jones has been</p>
<p>a fucking doing</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been doing</p>
<p>mixed martial arts</p>
<p>for only 3 years</p>
<p>before that</p>
<p>he was a wrestler</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>happened in boxing</p>
<p>just look at</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>with boxing</p>
<p>culturally look</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting though</p>
<p>that football</p>
<p>and I guess</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just where</p>
<p>the money is</p>
<p>that the high money ones</p>
<p>like football</p>
<p>and basketball</p>
<p>they get the best athletes</p>
<p>yes I mean even though</p>
<p>the ufc&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>around now for</p>
<p>you know since 93</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not been like</p>
<p>a real accepted you know</p>
<p>mainstream thing</p>
<p>but for like</p>
<p>the last 5 or 6 years right</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you say</p>
<p>yes yes you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the super athletes that start</p>
<p>jiu jitsu early</p>
<p>wrestling their whole lives</p>
<p>and striking early</p>
<p>they put it together</p>
<p>like the Ruff o brothers yes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best athletes that start off</p>
<p>like the Ruff o brothers</p>
<p>you know I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some people can start off with jiu jitsu</p>
<p>in wrestling and striking early</p>
<p>and achieve so much physically from it</p>
<p>but still they weren&rsquo;t born with the athleticism</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>I mean you gotta be a natural</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta all come together</p>
<p>you gotta have all the pieces together to make it</p>
<p>in the big sports that we see today</p>
<p>I mean like</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t start playing football when you&rsquo;re 22</p>
<p>and make the NFL</p>
<p>if you do it may have happened once or twice</p>
<p>some African guy</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it may have happened</p>
<p>you know what I mean</p>
<p>you know one of them</p>
<p>Matumbo Mckenbey</p>
<p>guys that started playing basketball for 18 months</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s in the NBA</p>
<p>you know what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>every now and then</p>
<p>you get those freaks</p>
<p>but generally</p>
<p>98 of the time</p>
<p>look at what&rsquo;s going on with all the sport</p>
<p>did they just go and find that dude and say hey</p>
<p>you want to play basketball</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just picking</p>
<p>it up how weird is it</p>
<p>one of those dudes</p>
<p>one of those dudes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure minut</p>
<p>bowle accumbie matumbo</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even say his name</p>
<p>but one of those dudes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure started playing basketball late</p>
<p>do you imagine what it must be like</p>
<p>living like Manute Ball</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re living in dollhouses everywhere</p>
<p>everywhere you go</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re dollhouses</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s building is built for dolls</p>
<p>you have to hunch</p>
<p>everywhere you go</p>
<p>at what height</p>
<p>not naturally for girls</p>
<p>for girls taller</p>
<p>guys naturally</p>
<p>the taller you are</p>
<p>the more attractive</p>
<p>you are naturally</p>
<p>but what what</p>
<p>exactly what</p>
<p>size 6 8 6 7</p>
<p>does it become a turn off to girls</p>
<p>cause there must be a turn off point</p>
<p>or are they turned on by guys that are 7ft 3 do that</p>
<p>does a guy a girl</p>
<p>look at a guy 7ft 3</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s totally attractive</p>
<p>at least 7ft 3 so rare</p>
<p>I love him so much</p>
<p>or is it like hmm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too tall</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like them that tall</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>yeah you know what I mean</p>
<p>what is it well</p>
<p>they would also worry</p>
<p>I think evolutionarily about that</p>
<p>is this real</p>
<p>is that a real word</p>
<p>about the baby</p>
<p>getting too big inside of them</p>
<p>and get stuck</p>
<p>coming out of their pussy</p>
<p>and just blow it all out</p>
<p>if you got a 7ft 3 dude</p>
<p>imagine how big is fucking babies are</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s half his baby</p>
<p>you know you got a 15</p>
<p>Ôø°20 baby inside your hooker you know</p>
<p>what I will say this though I am not attracted to do</p>
<p>like that I&rsquo;m not attracted a real tall chicks I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>yeah that you know and especially when they get fucking</p>
<p>ridiculous of a girl 6ft one</p>
<p>usually they</p>
<p>gotta be they gotta have really pretty faces and</p>
<p>usually their bodies start to</p>
<p>get out of whack you know what I mean it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>but I have looked at big tall ass</p>
<p>chicks and when you see him in public</p>
<p>the thoughts will race through my mind like damn</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be nice just to pump a load into her and</p>
<p>see what my baby would see what my boy</p>
<p>would turn out like you know what I mean</p>
<p>how proud would I be of that fucking kid</p>
<p>you know what I mean he&rsquo;s 6ft 3 and that&rsquo;s my son</p>
<p>can you imagine</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s 6ft 5 and that&rsquo;s my son and he&rsquo;s beating ass</p>
<p>tod Duffy looking dude oh that&rsquo;s my son</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be cool dude how cool would that be</p>
<p>imagine that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you look for in a girl that&rsquo;s how you who cares</p>
<p>what she looks like</p>
<p>I mean just</p>
<p>keep on 2 conversations of the same</p>
<p>imagine that&rsquo;s how you</p>
<p>found girls that&rsquo;s like how you went to go</p>
<p>date girls just by looking at them as a</p>
<p>mother to a</p>
<p>child I like a</p>
<p>super athlete like you only</p>
<p>wanted that&rsquo;s what um</p>
<p>that dude who Zulu</p>
<p>remember Zulu</p>
<p>the guy who fought Hicks and Gracie</p>
<p>he has this</p>
<p>story about</p>
<p>the way he described it</p>
<p>was a large negress</p>
<p>and that he knew</p>
<p>that she would make</p>
<p>great babies for him</p>
<p>so he found her</p>
<p>and he described like</p>
<p>what he did</p>
<p>how he shot loads into her</p>
<p>to make a boy</p>
<p>that he knew that</p>
<p>the way he was doing it</p>
<p>was definitely</p>
<p>to make a boy</p>
<p>he had some method</p>
<p>and then Zulu came out</p>
<p>dude I would pay 50 bucks</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great story</p>
<p>I would pay</p>
<p>50 bucks right</p>
<p>now if you said</p>
<p>I got the DVD</p>
<p>the documentary</p>
<p>of that I would go</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you 50</p>
<p>bucks for that</p>
<p>I would even go</p>
<p>75 bucks but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go your</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>but God damn it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll still pay for it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an awesome story</p>
<p>imagine how much of a pain in the ass it must be</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a kid</p>
<p>and your dad</p>
<p>was some fighter</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re supposed to be a</p>
<p>fighter too</p>
<p>you like goddamn</p>
<p>really I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just have fun</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t just go</p>
<p>hang out no</p>
<p>I gotta go in a</p>
<p>fight oh shit</p>
<p>or like any Zulu</p>
<p>like his son</p>
<p>his son didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really seem like</p>
<p>he wanted to be</p>
<p>doing that right</p>
<p>you know I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like I mean</p>
<p>you almost have to</p>
<p>if your dad is</p>
<p>Zulu you know</p>
<p>your dad is this</p>
<p>famous guy who got in</p>
<p>a bare knuckle cage fight</p>
<p>with fucking</p>
<p>Hicks and Gracie</p>
<p>back in the day</p>
<p>yeah maybe he</p>
<p>maybe he wasn&rsquo;t into</p>
<p>and he kind of</p>
<p>got just like</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to work</p>
<p>a regular job</p>
<p>I got a name</p>
<p>I can actually fight</p>
<p>but he did do</p>
<p>jiu jitsu though</p>
<p>he was all right</p>
<p>as you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>a purple belt</p>
<p>back when he fought</p>
<p>so he was doing</p>
<p>jiu jitsu so</p>
<p>in a weird way</p>
<p>Zulu like jiu</p>
<p>jitsu beat Zulu</p>
<p>but zulu&rsquo;s son</p>
<p>was into jiu jitsu hmm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>cool right yeah</p>
<p>do you remember that</p>
<p>Hixon Gracie footage</p>
<p>for those who don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>hixon vs Zulu</p>
<p>is one of the very</p>
<p>very first like</p>
<p>no rules fights</p>
<p>you know that was</p>
<p>like where they</p>
<p>planned it out</p>
<p>they had a whole arena full</p>
<p>people in Brazil</p>
<p>checking this out</p>
<p>and a young</p>
<p>Hicks and Gracie</p>
<p>he was like 18</p>
<p>I think he was</p>
<p>a representative</p>
<p>of jiu jitsu</p>
<p>fought this giant</p>
<p>super athlete</p>
<p>black dude named Zulu</p>
<p>and this guy&rsquo;s just yoked</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just slamming him</p>
<p>and Hicks and eventually</p>
<p>gets his back</p>
<p>and strangles him</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those all time</p>
<p>great videos</p>
<p>where people</p>
<p>watch it like</p>
<p>jujitsu guys</p>
<p>back in the day</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>this is proof</p>
<p>man this is</p>
<p>proof like look</p>
<p>if you get a good jiu jitsu</p>
<p>you can overcome</p>
<p>a guy like this</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s only 18</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>a big fucking deal</p>
<p>and the footage is so bad</p>
<p>but it looks cool</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like 50th generation</p>
<p>all that footage</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dudes taping it</p>
<p>off VHS somehow</p>
<p>I got the DVD</p>
<p>and then a copy</p>
<p>and it already</p>
<p>started off as</p>
<p>terrible footage</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>like silhouetted</p>
<p>kind of it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a yellow</p>
<p>and black and orange</p>
<p>type thing but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s classic</p>
<p>one of the coolest</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>I ever got out of</p>
<p>being famous</p>
<p>was I got to have</p>
<p>dinner with Hixon</p>
<p>that was one of</p>
<p>the coolest</p>
<p>things ever</p>
<p>I had dinner with Hixon</p>
<p>and then we went</p>
<p>over his house</p>
<p>and we watched fights</p>
<p>and he broke down</p>
<p>what dudes were doing wrong</p>
<p>he was watching</p>
<p>Mario Sperry</p>
<p>fight in Coliseum</p>
<p>and he was just talking</p>
<p>about space</p>
<p>he was talking about</p>
<p>I give no space</p>
<p>I give no space</p>
<p>he was talking</p>
<p>about so like</p>
<p>such an intense dude</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>he was talking about</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>his philosophy on jujutsu</p>
<p>very simple</p>
<p>we started 0</p>
<p>and from 0 we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to one</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going back to 0</p>
<p>and then from one</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to 2</p>
<p>2-3 to checkmate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to go</p>
<p>I was like god damn</p>
<p>you get the chills</p>
<p>talking to him</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m sitting here</p>
<p>talking to Hixon</p>
<p>motherfucking Gracie</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s giving me like</p>
<p>some intense</p>
<p>life philosophy</p>
<p>on how he strangles dudes</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s into it</p>
<p>you know when we were</p>
<p>watching all</p>
<p>these fights</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s breaking</p>
<p>the shit down</p>
<p>and he watched</p>
<p>the Funaki fight</p>
<p>with him and Funaki</p>
<p>those Hixon</p>
<p>fights man god</p>
<p>I wish there were</p>
<p>more of them</p>
<p>so annoying man</p>
<p>so annoying</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get to see the</p>
<p>the best supposed</p>
<p>representative</p>
<p>ever of jujitsu</p>
<p>at the time</p>
<p>fighting those</p>
<p>guys you know</p>
<p>finding all</p>
<p>Mark coleman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>all the fucking guys</p>
<p>that everyone</p>
<p>was scared of</p>
<p>Mark her and</p>
<p>all that shit</p>
<p>how fascinating</p>
<p>would that have been</p>
<p>man yeah fuck</p>
<p>that would have</p>
<p>been awesome</p>
<p>damn that would</p>
<p>freak me out</p>
<p>it really would</p>
<p>it would freak me out</p>
<p>to sit and hang out with Hicks and Gracie</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s cool as fuck</p>
<p>that would freak me out</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a super nice guy</p>
<p>his son is cool as fuck</p>
<p>nobody else in jiu jitsu</p>
<p>they would freak me out like Hixon</p>
<p>you know what I mean</p>
<p>marcella Garcia to me</p>
<p>marcella Garcia is the number one jiu jitsu guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ever lived</p>
<p>I think Marcella Garcia</p>
<p>is the number one guy that&rsquo;s ever lived</p>
<p>you know but Hixon would is the most</p>
<p>mystical and rock star ish</p>
<p>yeah you know what I mean</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like motherfucker</p>
<p>was an Incredible Hulk</p>
<p>you know what I mean</p>
<p>you know the Incredible Hulk with Ed Norton</p>
<p>when Ed Norton</p>
<p>is learning how to calm and control himself</p>
<p>Hicks and Gracie slapping him in the face</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the man</p>
<p>yeah I would freak out if if</p>
<p>if like me and Hixon would just sitting there</p>
<p>talking to jiu jitsu</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s not out of the question</p>
<p>that might happen in the future</p>
<p>for sure it might</p>
<p>it might not</p>
<p>I would love it</p>
<p>I would that would be a fucking dream of mine</p>
<p>to hang out and talk jiu jitsu</p>
<p>and break shit down to the core</p>
<p>for the people who don&rsquo;t know the history</p>
<p>Eddie Bravo tapped hixon&rsquo;s brother</p>
<p>Hoyler and Abu Dhabi 2003</p>
<p>and this giant upset when Eddie was a brown belt</p>
<p>and he caught him with a triangle</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s like this perceived animosity sometimes</p>
<p>because of that</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s none exists</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never been anything</p>
<p>but respectful of any of those guys</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I know that they were trying to do some sort of</p>
<p>a rematch with you and Hoyler</p>
<p>but yeah I guess that was what would happen</p>
<p>is a promoter called or emailed me last</p>
<p>October right</p>
<p>October or November</p>
<p>and it was a guy that I&rsquo;ve done privates for</p>
<p>I know who he is</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s really high up in jiu jitsu in the Middle East</p>
<p>in Abu Dhabi</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re putting together</p>
<p>they were putting together a No Gi</p>
<p>World Championship in Abu Dhabi</p>
<p>they never had a No Gi one</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing Gi World Championships out there</p>
<p>but the No Gi ones</p>
<p>they wanted to have one in April</p>
<p>and they asked me if they wanted to have me and Hoyler</p>
<p>as a super match</p>
<p>but they never contacted him</p>
<p>they told this is what happened</p>
<p>then I emailed him back</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you know me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m down to rematch Hoyler anytime</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been down</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been the one denying it</p>
<p>I want one more match</p>
<p>any other fighters</p>

<p>movie to date but it was terrible</p>
<p>they made it into like the fast and the furious mma</p>
<p>and it was terrible</p>
<p>but the one thing i remember anything is</p>
<p>these days right</p>
<p>everything seems to have the same sort of tone to it</p>
<p>these young</p>
<p>is like they&rsquo;re letting you know and like</p>
<p>these fast and furious</p>
<p>never back down</p>
<p>any of those kind of movies</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re letting you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna get real deep like we&rsquo;re all just</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re agreeing to this</p>
<p>right off the bat what it is is like a music</p>
<p>video what it is is</p>
<p>the people that can make movies and put them right in</p>
<p>the guys that have that power</p>
<p>they really don&rsquo;t know that much about</p>
<p>mma they just got into it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like i&rsquo;m gonna make an mma</p>
<p>movie i&rsquo;m gonna make them</p>
<p>fighting movie man</p>
<p>like this tap out stuff</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the guys with the power</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna let the guys that</p>
<p>could really put together an authentic mma</p>
<p>movie how are they gonna get their movie</p>
<p>this movie company can only</p>
<p>is only pushing</p>
<p>three movies a year</p>
<p>this one&rsquo;s only pushing ten</p>
<p>you know what i mean you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get yours on that spotlight</p>
<p>well someone did</p>
<p>and obviously there were a bunch of</p>
<p>knuckleheads that put that movie together the first one</p>
<p>the first one&rsquo;s really bad</p>
<p>the story is always like the new guy in town</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s really handsome</p>
<p>and all the</p>
<p>other guys that are bad guys in town</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gotta be hot</p>
<p>chips sure oh</p>
<p>and he meets the</p>
<p>girlfriend and you know the guy</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t treat her good and this new guy does and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same formula with a</p>
<p>we could do a</p>
<p>scary movie</p>
<p>we can do an</p>
<p>mma movie now we need to do a race car</p>
<p>movie with that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do a dancing</p>
<p>movie where they like</p>
<p>dance off same</p>
<p>story though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same guys</p>
<p>the guys with the</p>
<p>green light</p>
<p>power they&rsquo;re not idiots</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>sport that well that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>the little things that an mma</p>
<p>expert can just like</p>
<p>pick it apart</p>
<p>like the little</p>
<p>things like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fighting in like in the circle of people</p>
<p>standing like</p>
<p>this it doesn&rsquo;t happen you know</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>when steven</p>
<p>seagal had become really</p>
<p>famous they started</p>
<p>like a search</p>
<p>like different</p>
<p>studios were having</p>
<p>searches of martial artists</p>
<p>all across the country find the next steven seagal</p>
<p>and so they met with me in new york</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t remember what</p>
<p>studio it was</p>
<p>about but i</p>
<p>said the number one problem with martial arts</p>
<p>movies is that a real martial artist is</p>
<p>gonna look at that shit</p>
<p>and go that&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unrealistic and they were like</p>
<p>he got arrogant with me they&rsquo;re like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous no</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna know you and like a few</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>believe me it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter yeah yeah it does</p>
<p>get arrogant</p>
<p>he was really arrogant</p>
<p>about it i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m telling you</p>
<p>as a person like</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a guitar player okay and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching some fucking</p>
<p>movie about the</p>
<p>buddy holly</p>
<p>story and there&rsquo;s a guy playing guitar</p>
<p>and you know he&rsquo;s not really playing guitar</p>
<p>that would drive you</p>
<p>crazy if you saw some guy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s doing this and the</p>
<p>music is coming out but you know this</p>
<p>motherfucker is not playing that music</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the game plan</p>
<p>as a musician</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>drive you fucking nuts totally you</p>
<p>could pick that out yeah i</p>
<p>was crazy yeah</p>
<p>they always</p>
<p>check the technique</p>
<p>yeah and i was telling</p>
<p>these guys i&rsquo;m like look</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some badass shit that you can do that&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>that really does work and i can show you</p>
<p>i can show you some badass shit that really works</p>
<p>but all this</p>
<p>flying double scissor</p>
<p>kick two dudes at the same time that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>silly nonsense</p>
<p>this is silliness</p>
<p>yeah like you&rsquo;re doing silly</p>
<p>stuff i remember walking out of</p>
<p>never back down one going</p>
<p>okay it sucked but at least</p>
<p>they got the</p>
<p>mainstream used to armbars and triangles and at</p>
<p>least they got them</p>
<p>used to looking at</p>
<p>fights movie big movie</p>
<p>fights do you</p>
<p>remember there&rsquo;s a triangle in an armbar that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of lethal weapon</p>
<p>whore yeah that</p>
<p>was a triangle yeah corey</p>
<p>and gracie was a</p>
<p>fight coordinator for lethal weapon</p>
<p>but in movies like that you see</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>every now and then sprinkled in but</p>
<p>like in and</p>
<p>never back down</p>
<p>they explained it they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>training it it&rsquo;s like a new</p>
<p>like a secret weapon so they</p>
<p>focused on it like an</p>
<p>lethal weapon he</p>
<p>gets him in a triangle but they didn&rsquo;t say wow</p>
<p>look what he&rsquo;s actually doing at the brain</p>
<p>most people</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even know that was a technique they&rsquo;re like oh</p>
<p>he had him between his legs</p>
<p>like they don&rsquo;t even see the technique you know i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think triangle without</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>rampage jackson and</p>
<p>arona whenever anybody even mentions the word triangle</p>
<p>all i think</p>
<p>about is that fight</p>
<p>because that</p>
<p>was the craziest end to a triangle attempt ever</p>
<p>yeah rampage picked him up like a pillow and</p>
<p>slammed them</p>
<p>do you remember we were over here</p>
<p>watching that shit</p>
<p>do you remember how</p>
<p>scary that was</p>
<p>that was scary</p>
<p>look if you put that in a</p>
<p>movie you would say bullshit</p>
<p>that could never really happen</p>
<p>but you know what i mean</p>
<p>it hasn&rsquo;t happened since and</p>
<p>you said this i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never forget you said ooh</p>
<p>he might be dead</p>
<p>yeah we were</p>
<p>watching this and you went oh he</p>
<p>might be dead like</p>
<p>that was the cra if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen that slam</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to get</p>
<p>arona is trying</p>
<p>to get rampage in a triangle and rampage defends it</p>
<p>by picking him up over his head</p>
<p>and slamming them down full</p>
<p>force onto the ground and then head butting him</p>
<p>they collided heads accidentally just from the impact</p>
<p>it was a double wham</p>
<p>but if that</p>
<p>would happen on concrete</p>
<p>he would have been a vegetable</p>
<p>if he was lucky</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>mean he was</p>
<p>lucky he was</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>gonna be dead but if you&rsquo;re a vegetable like damn</p>
<p>yeah at least you kept him alive</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how hard his head</p>
<p>hit his head</p>
<p>it would have</p>
<p>exploded i wonder</p>
<p>i wonder if that&rsquo;s affecting his career now and oh</p>
<p>for sure it is</p>
<p>you think unquestionably that was a fucking violent</p>
<p>knockout man</p>
<p>that was an unbelievably violent knockout</p>
<p>and then right</p>
<p>afterwards so</p>
<p>could you knocked him out remember</p>
<p>so that was two in a row</p>
<p>you know when you get bombed out like that</p>
<p>so could you one was brutal too man</p>
<p>so could you out of the gate you remember how</p>
<p>scary that guy was out of the gate</p>
<p>out of the gate</p>
<p>knocks out noguera</p>
<p>hogerio noguera</p>
<p>and then arona two in a row</p>
<p>and does it like he&rsquo;s just gonna</p>
<p>steamroll everyone yeah</p>
<p>looks like a mad destroyer</p>
<p>jesus and and then someone told me you</p>
<p>gotta watch</p>
<p>a fight of his</p>
<p>against glover to shera</p>
<p>you know who was one of the guys from</p>
<p>chuck&rsquo;s camp</p>
<p>from sll do you remember that guy</p>
<p>yeah big really</p>
<p>strong light</p>
<p>heavyweight but he had like visa problems i think</p>
<p>but a really</p>
<p>scary dude dangerous dangerous dude and</p>
<p>he fought sokojo and broke him</p>
<p>he fought socojo</p>
<p>and stopped him with strikes</p>
<p>and then you know that this was all</p>
<p>after that that was apparently</p>
<p>early early on</p>
<p>he said something like one of</p>
<p>those guys that almost</p>
<p>maybe got thrown into the deep end too</p>
<p>quick yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never too late for so</p>
<p>could you so</p>
<p>could you just focused on</p>
<p>on getting really good at jujutsu and not and not</p>
<p>end up like</p>
<p>one of those fighters</p>
<p>you know one of</p>
<p>those olympic</p>
<p>wrestlers that</p>
<p>never learn jujitsu you know</p>
<p>if he falls in love with jujitsu</p>
<p>continues to progress with the striking</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be a</p>
<p>force but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>if he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>learn jujutsu if he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fall</p>
<p>in love with jujutsu his chances are very slim of</p>
<p>getting to the top</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real weird when you see you know</p>
<p>you always like to say well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain amount of losses a</p>
<p>fighter has and then they&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>but every now and then there&rsquo;s a guy who comes</p>
<p>along that just defies</p>
<p>that shit that like loses a</p>
<p>bunch of times but then gets it together and then</p>
<p>starts winning</p>
<p>jorge santiago</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a good example of that</p>
<p>anderson silva was just running the mill</p>
<p>leota machida</p>
<p>for a few years</p>
<p>that were like ah he&rsquo;s all right</p>
<p>so the fighters</p>
<p>right now that you</p>
<p>think yeah but i mean i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about losses i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about bouncing back from losses</p>
<p>machita you know only</p>
<p>bounced back from the</p>
<p>shogun loss</p>
<p>but like alistair</p>
<p>alistair overran</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s been stopped nine times</p>
<p>bobby hoffman stopped him you know</p>
<p>he got submitted by verdoom</p>
<p>haratanoff stopped him</p>
<p>chuck stopped him</p>
<p>a lot of guys stopped him</p>
<p>and if you looked at him on</p>
<p>paper with all</p>
<p>those stoppages you</p>
<p>would say well how is this guy ever</p>
<p>gonna be the best</p>
<p>but then you look at him now</p>
<p>shit he&rsquo;s one of the best man yeah</p>
<p>and his jiu</p>
<p>jitsu is good</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll kill you with a yeah</p>
<p>and his his</p>
<p>striking is</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s close</p>
<p>that motherfucker is the</p>
<p>strike force</p>
<p>grand prix champion</p>
<p>and or the excuse me the k1 grand prix</p>
<p>champion and</p>
<p>the strike force</p>
<p>champion and the</p>
<p>dream champion and</p>
<p>who the fuck</p>
<p>has ever been able to do that do kickboxing</p>
<p>at the highest</p>
<p>level and mma</p>
<p>the thing that saves</p>
<p>ovary is that</p>
<p>he mastered the guillotine</p>
<p>anybody try to take him down</p>
<p>you gotta take him down i mean</p>
<p>most people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna try to</p>
<p>stand with them there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a couple</p>
<p>you know brave</p>
<p>motherfuckers out there that try to</p>
<p>stand with them</p>
<p>there will be an</p>
<p>mma but usually</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna try to take him down</p>
<p>they got to</p>
<p>worry about that guillotine yeah his guillotine&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death he&rsquo;s fucking cemented</p>
<p>veto over there</p>
<p>this is good</p>
<p>and his ground game is good too because his brother</p>
<p>valentine ovarimu</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t had</p>
<p>a successful</p>
<p>career as of yet he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still fighting</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>smart guy and is in love with</p>
<p>jiu jitsu valentine</p>
<p>ovarim&rsquo;s jiu</p>
<p>jitsu is really really good and that&rsquo;s his brother</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s rubbing off on him because</p>
<p>overream i was to one</p>
<p>he run the abu dhabi european</p>
<p>trials didn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>something like that i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t quote me on it but i know</p>
<p>his jiu jitsu is good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the key</p>
<p>all you guys out there i know i</p>
<p>never fought</p>
<p>but in my opinion i&rsquo;ve been in the business</p>
<p>getting paid</p>
<p>since 2000 that&rsquo;s a getting</p>
<p>paid watching</p>
<p>fighters come and go</p>
<p>watching fight camps come and go</p>
<p>meeting all</p>
<p>these guys and get to i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>experiment like i go through</p>
<p>their lives</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s never too late</p>
<p>to get your career together</p>
<p>you have to fall in love with jiu jitsu</p>
<p>of course you need like the mental</p>
<p>state together</p>
<p>you gotta have</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t you know have a fragile ego</p>
<p>and you gotta</p>
<p>you gotta have a warrior&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>but if you have a warrior&rsquo;s mind you love to</p>
<p>fight you love to</p>
<p>train you have a</p>
<p>great work ethic</p>
<p>please fall in love with some jiu jitsu</p>
<p>fall in love with it</p>
<p>then you become dangerous on the ground a wrestler</p>
<p>who is not interested</p>
<p>in learning how to take people out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>basketball player not interested in like</p>

<p>dribble i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna dribble</p>

<p>and bless of course you</p>
<p>some dude just likes to stand</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s good too but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go so far</p>
<p>in what i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>working backstage at all</p>
<p>these goddamn shows for</p>
<p>the ufc for</p>
<p>eight years</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i see</p>
<p>i see the guys come and go</p>
<p>come and go</p>
<p>and the main</p>
<p>thing at the very top</p>
<p>at the very top</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re a brazilian jiu jitsu</p>
<p>black belt and you won the moondials a</p>
<p>bunch of times</p>
<p>what i see i see</p>
<p>the prelims for the last</p>
<p>eight years</p>
<p>a lot of people don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in the prelims</p>
<p>just getting signed if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>under 170 and you get signed to the ufc</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean shit you</p>
<p>gotta get through the prelims to get to the main card</p>
<p>you know how many</p>
<p>fights you gotta win to be</p>
<p>on the main card and your 170</p>
<p>pounds they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna put you on the main card</p>
<p>you gotta win more than two</p>
<p>fights and you better be exciting</p>
<p>so getting signed to the</p>
<p>ufc is like</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve used this before</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like those turtles that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re born they&rsquo;re hatched in the</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re born yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>alive but now you got to get past the seagulls</p>
<p>and all the</p>
<p>crabs attacking you good luck making it to the ocean</p>
<p>the main card</p>
<p>good luck it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>my point is</p>
<p>i see a lot of guys come and</p>
<p>never make it to the preli</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of brazilian jiu jitsu</p>
<p>black belts out there</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t wanna say any names</p>
<p>a lot of them coming through</p>
<p>and they just get</p>
<p>smashed by wrestlers no one ever sees it</p>
<p>no one ever talks</p>
<p>about it it&rsquo;s not on the</p>
<p>underground</p>
<p>and they just disappear</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of them</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been guys that rise and are stars like</p>
<p>charles oliveira</p>
<p>and that rocha guy i like</p>
<p>those guys i want them to</p>
<p>you know their</p>
<p>submissions look</p>
<p>slick no gi</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of guys</p>
<p>that get they can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>to the main card because they couldn&rsquo;t get past the</p>
<p>elite wrestler</p>
<p>even though they were a black belt</p>
<p>in the ghee</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on their back</p>
<p>the guard is okay sometimes</p>
<p>things catch</p>
<p>but overall</p>
<p>i see a lot of guys lose decisions because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on their back</p>
<p>against some average</p>
<p>college wrestler</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t get passed by</p>
<p>i see that a lot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>unless i unless i</p>
<p>dreamed it or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m having delusions</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i thought i see</p>
<p>i see a lot of guys come through</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have the answer for the</p>
<p>elite wrestler</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wrestled your whole life</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wrestled your</p>
<p>whole life guess what</p>
<p>most of the guys at the top have wrestled</p>
<p>and you better have the answer for them that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>worst nightmare you better be</p>
<p>training for that wrestler</p>
<p>right now because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna hit and</p>
<p>every year more and more</p>
<p>wrestlers are quitting</p>
<p>their job at fucking home depot</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching the</p>
<p>ultimate fighter</p>
<p>going i could be</p>
<p>famous too i</p>
<p>wrestle twenty</p>
<p>three years</p>
<p>fuck this life they got</p>
<p>three kids they hate their wife</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>these guys coming they&rsquo;re coming</p>
<p>they want to be</p>
<p>famous too there&rsquo;s a new celebrity in town</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>mma fighter</p>
<p>and these guys they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>bunch of them the judo guys are</p>
<p>going should i</p>
<p>could do it too</p>
<p>i almost went to the olympics in judo</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these guys coming out</p>
<p>what are you</p>
<p>gonna do to them</p>
<p>these guys are used to being on top they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>wrestling since</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>start wrestling now if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t wrestled your</p>
<p>whole life your</p>
<p>guard better be amazing it better be ninja</p>
<p>when they talk</p>
<p>about your guard you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make it to the top of mma</p>
<p>and you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wrestled your whole life</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about your guard like it&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>fucking phenomenal so dangerous stay away from his</p>
<p>guard it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not saying that</p>
<p>about your guard</p>
<p>your chances are slim that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get past the</p>
<p>elite wrestler</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna be on top for sure</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a 50 50 beat em strike</p>
<p>if you beat em striking</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>might win a few</p>
<p>these new young guys man all of them are</p>
<p>super equipped</p>
<p>like this michael</p>
<p>mcdonald kid that fought this weekend you see that</p>
<p>fight i didn&rsquo;t see that</p>
<p>fight oh my</p>
<p>god what a fight</p>
<p>edwin figueroa</p>
<p>michael mcdonald they fought at a hundred and</p>
<p>forty five prelim</p>
<p>one forty five or one</p>
<p>thirty five i</p>
<p>think it was one</p>
<p>forty five forgive</p>
<p>me if i&rsquo;m not sure yeah it was one of the prelims</p>
<p>it aired on like facebook or you know one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>maybe a spike i</p>
<p>think it was facebook though</p>
<p>this fucking kid is</p>
<p>super talented dude</p>
<p>super talented and both of them are the figueroa</p>
<p>took the fight on six days notice and cut</p>
<p>twenty pounds</p>
<p>to to make the weight</p>
<p>class i&rsquo;m pretty sure was one</p>
<p>thirty five</p>
<p>either way um</p>
<p>uh figueroa cut all this</p>
<p>fucking weight and uh was getting his ass kicked in the</p>
<p>first round</p>
<p>but then just gutted it out and</p>
<p>starts going</p>
<p>after him in the</p>
<p>second round and the</p>
<p>third round dude it was just a</p>
<p>crazy fucking fight</p>
<p>but this kid</p>
<p>mcdonald had him in</p>
<p>a triangle armbar combination he had his back he just</p>
<p>it was it was sick sick display of</p>
<p>striking and</p>
<p>jiu jitsu together</p>
<p>at least fucking 20 years old man</p>
<p>all these new guys that are coming up they can do</p>
<p>everything they can wrestle</p>
<p>they can do</p>
<p>jiu jitsu they&rsquo;re good off their back</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all good off their back</p>
<p>that you have to be</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the next</p>
<p>stage there&rsquo;s no getting past that there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>ultimately being</p>
<p>having an average</p>
<p>guard like most</p>
<p>typical mma</p>
<p>fighters just</p>
<p>that average</p>
<p>guard that we&rsquo;re seeing now</p>
<p>if you have that you&rsquo;re gone well i</p>
<p>felt that the days of a guy</p>
<p>not being good at any of the aspects of</p>
<p>mma are on the way out there&rsquo;s not that many</p>
<p>room there&rsquo;s not that much room left</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like every</p>
<p>other sport man</p>
<p>it gets broken down to its bare essentials</p>
<p>and everything</p>
<p>gets exposed and now that we know the bare essentials</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real simple you have to have all of them in</p>
<p>place you have to have</p>
<p>wrestling you have to have</p>
<p>striking you have to be good off your back it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a science it&rsquo;s a science and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve both of us have worked backstage and we see</p>
<p>these guys come and go</p>
<p>it really is a strange perspective for me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m getting to see</p>
<p>what every fight i see in the</p>
<p>truck for the last</p>
<p>eight years</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m analyzing what works and what</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m constantly</p>
<p>doing the research</p>
<p>and talking he&rsquo;s got see him come see him go</p>
<p>i could put careers together like charts</p>
<p>you know and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird arrogance to not wanting to</p>
<p>learn some aspects of this more yes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem basically</p>
<p>if the people you roll with</p>
<p>this you know if you&rsquo;re an mma</p>
<p>fighter and the people you roll with</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t talking</p>
<p>about your jiu</p>
<p>jitsu like it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>man your chances are slim</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people eventually</p>
<p>you see these stars rise</p>
<p>and again this is all coming from a guy</p>
<p>assigned to</p>
<p>studying charts</p>
<p>backstage i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never fought i&rsquo;m not a badass i&rsquo;m not an athlete</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not this tough dude</p>
<p>i just noticed</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>i noticed things</p>
<p>on a hyper level</p>
<p>and i noticed</p>
<p>that the fighters that come and go</p>
<p>the ones that come</p>
<p>if you put them i can&rsquo;t name names that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>you see them come and</p>
<p>then you see them go</p>
<p>if you put them all together</p>
<p>they their jiu jitsu was</p>
<p>never discussed one common denominator</p>
<p>was their jiu</p>
<p>jitsu was probably</p>
<p>never discussed as something lethal</p>
<p>at their own gym</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>probably not</p>
<p>i could go on that</p>
<p>level there&rsquo;s a lot of guys who can get away with just</p>
<p>wrestling and really good</p>
<p>striking for a</p>
<p>while for a</p>
<p>while yeah if you can keep the</p>
<p>fight you gotta be good at</p>
<p>everything and people are leaving out razor</p>
<p>sharp finishing jiu jitsu</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re leaving that out there&rsquo;s a lot of guys that are</p>
<p>spending most of</p>
<p>their time working on the</p>
<p>striking which is</p>
<p>great but i</p>
<p>think the main concern is you know what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be as</p>
<p>tough as i can</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t wanna be exposed i don&rsquo;t wanna get</p>
<p>knocked i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do everything i can</p>
<p>to not get knocked the fuck out in</p>
<p>front of the world</p>
<p>so most people</p>
<p>focus on the</p>
<p>striking i totally</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>but you have if you want to make</p>
<p>if you want to</p>
<p>fight if you want a long career</p>
<p>you want a long</p>
<p>successful career</p>
<p>you have to fall in love</p>
<p>with jiu jitsu and that means you have to get into</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>study the top guys and the top guys are marcelo</p>
<p>hodra gracie</p>
<p>and jeff glover</p>
<p>just the most beautiful</p>
<p>jiu jitsu just watch that</p>
<p>and you gotta</p>
<p>start getting into that if you&rsquo;re not into it</p>
<p>and your career&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going that great</p>
<p>ask yourself that question</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>think about what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m you know</p>
<p>you got to fall in love with</p>
<p>jiu jitsu you have to</p>
<p>not just striking and wrestling</p>
<p>especially if you want look if you like</p>
<p>fighting you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna wanna have</p>
<p>a career that&rsquo;s long and you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>wanna take as little damage as possible</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t have like a really good</p>
<p>submissions if that option isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>in your toolbox at all times</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna engage in longer</p>
<p>fights than necessary you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get more damage than necessary</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s guys that</p>
<p>would see you know you know that have</p>
<p>equal striking</p>
<p>but one guy will see an opening for a</p>
<p>submission and jump on it</p>
<p>even though he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>striking with the guy</p>
<p>because he recognizes it&rsquo;s the correct</p>
<p>thing to do that it&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>but for some</p>
<p>guys they don&rsquo;t have that option in the toolbox</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have that option in your toolbox you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a longer you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have longer fights</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be more brutal you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take more damage</p>
<p>and you have less options</p>
<p>and overall</p>
<p>whoever has the less options is gonna</p>
<p>do not as good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just science and if there&rsquo;s more time</p>
<p>fighting there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>time you&rsquo;re getting hit there&rsquo;s more chances you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting hurt it&rsquo;s that simple it&rsquo;s really that simple</p>
<p>if you want to lengthen</p>
<p>your career you want to be as effective as possible</p>
<p>and if you want to have</p>
<p>the most dynamic career you want to be as effective as</p>
<p>take whatever the fuck is there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why george</p>
<p>saint pierre so good</p>
<p>just george</p>
<p>saint pierre</p>
<p>never commits to doing anything</p>
<p>i mean he might be</p>
<p>he might be</p>
<p>he might decide the game plan is to box you</p>
<p>but if you take him down</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like he hasn&rsquo;t been working on his</p>
<p>guard it&rsquo;s not like he hasn&rsquo;t been working on getting</p>
<p>right back up to his feet and it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>really comfortable</p>
<p>strangle you on the ground if it&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not gonna</p>
<p>stand up and let you</p>
<p>stand up and</p>
<p>start banging it out with you</p>
<p>again if he sees an opening he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take it he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna strangle you</p>
<p>are we ever</p>
<p>gonna see george</p>
<p>singing pierre be put on his back</p>
<p>did he fight some guy that just putting him on his back</p>
<p>at will and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to see how good george</p>
<p>st pierre&rsquo;s</p>
<p>guard is this</p>
<p>fight i think that&rsquo;ll ever happen this</p>
<p>fight easily</p>
<p>could be that jake</p>
<p>shields could easily get a hold of george</p>
<p>you think so i</p>
<p>think yes i</p>
<p>think stand up wise</p>
<p>stand up wise george is very</p>
<p>fluid he&rsquo;s much more fluid</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s more capable his jab is nasty that</p>
<p>he does that superman jab too and fucks you up with it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s nasty on</p>
<p>his feet man who leg kicks george oh for sure</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s nasty yeah so he won</p>
<p>kickboxing contest with</p>
<p>diego alves basically</p>
<p>i mean there were some take downs in that fight</p>
<p>but the kickboxing part of it the</p>
<p>stand up part george won that shit george is a beast</p>
<p>so jake is at a significant disadvantage</p>
<p>standing up</p>
<p>but jake is a</p>
<p>motherfucker dude</p>
<p>if he gets a hold of him</p>
<p>if he gets that fucking double</p>
<p>under hooks on george and really squeezes</p>
<p>if somehow another he finds himself in a position where</p>
<p>you know george ziggs when he</p>
<p>should have zags or he</p>
<p>somehow another gets him pressed up</p>
<p>against the cage and actually gets a hold of them</p>
<p>things get real interesting man</p>
<p>things get real interesting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about how they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>match up i mean</p>
<p>i could see it two ways i can see</p>
<p>jake shields taking</p>
<p>maybe ninety</p>
<p>seconds to pass george&rsquo;s</p>
<p>guard and then he finally passes</p>
<p>and then within</p>
<p>a minute he sinks in a rear naked</p>
<p>choke or some guillotine</p>
<p>and then puts them out and you&rsquo;re like wow man</p>
<p>he took his time but he sort of went through george i</p>
<p>could see that maybe</p>
<p>or i could also see</p>
<p>him not being able to pass george</p>
<p>st pierre&rsquo;s guard</p>
<p>george st pierre&rsquo;s guard</p>
<p>might be insane</p>
<p>like by this time the last time we saw it i</p>
<p>think it was</p>
<p>maybe carl prison or something</p>
<p>i forget the last time we saw it but</p>
<p>he was on his back</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think he did that much</p>
<p>but now who knows</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s preparing for</p>
<p>maybe yeah maybe his</p>
<p>maybe jake shields can&rsquo;t pass george</p>
<p>or he passes the half guard</p>
<p>and then he passed</p>
<p>the side control and then he recovers like damn he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta pass again</p>
<p>one of those battles one of those</p>
<p>chess matches</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>maybe later in the</p>
<p>rounds george</p>
<p>saint pierre has a</p>
<p>child a tired jake</p>
<p>shields jake shields</p>
<p>is able to get like one take down out of</p>
<p>three or four</p>
<p>attempts he&rsquo;s able to get him drag him down but</p>
<p>damn now he can&rsquo;t pass his guard</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>tired now he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>stand and he&rsquo;s tired</p>
<p>that could happen too</p>
<p>or he could go through them fuck</p>
<p>who knows it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>total mystery it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>total mystery it</p>
<p>could go both ways and i&rsquo;d go</p>
<p>oh damn it went that way i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>super excited for</p>
<p>that one man who knows i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>super excited for that</p>
<p>another scenario</p>
<p>is jake shields cannot take down george same pair</p>
<p>not even once</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another scenario sure</p>
<p>i mean if that happened i&rsquo;d be like damn</p>
<p>his wrestling wasn&rsquo;t good enough</p>
<p>cause if you look at josh koschek man josh koschek</p>
<p>on paper was a better</p>
<p>wrestler than</p>
<p>jake shields on</p>
<p>paper he did more in college he was like</p>
<p>an all american</p>
<p>maybe a national</p>
<p>champion once i</p>
<p>think i think he was the best uh huh</p>
<p>chuckle delton and josh costcheck was the best college</p>
<p>wrestler at</p>
<p>all fast yeah</p>
<p>and so he couldn&rsquo;t fuck with gsv</p>
<p>yeah what if jake</p>
<p>shields can&rsquo;t take down gsp that&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible too fuck yeah it&rsquo;s possible or</p>
<p>maybe he takes him down</p>
<p>super easy or</p>
<p>maybe it looks like</p>
<p>if you were you know an interesting thing</p>
<p>with the phil</p>
<p>davis no gara</p>
<p>fight was phil davis</p>
<p>could not take down little nog in that first</p>
<p>round and it looked</p>
<p>it looked like</p>
<p>for me if i was phil</p>
<p>davis&rsquo;s coach i</p>
<p>would have been like man you can&rsquo;t take him down</p>
<p>but you know what phil</p>
<p>davis kept doing</p>
<p>he kept trying</p>
<p>and in the second</p>
<p>round he just kept trying</p>
<p>and then he finally</p>
<p>got him down he</p>
<p>switched it from doubles a single</p>
<p>yes he did that and</p>
<p>he just kept</p>
<p>fucking plugging away with the wrestling</p>
<p>yeah a lot of</p>
<p>wrestlers at that</p>
<p>point would have just</p>
<p>said fuck it i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>stand with them and take my chances there well phil</p>
<p>davis is so confident with his</p>
<p>wrestling yeah he just</p>
<p>stuck with you here his post</p>
<p>fight interview</p>
<p>he had a lot of physical problems coming into his camp</p>
<p>apparently yeah he got injured a couple times and</p>
<p>he was having some real problems</p>
<p>where he wasn&rsquo;t sure he was</p>
<p>gonna go through the fight</p>
<p>you see how fast he</p>
<p>flicks up those head kicks dude yeah holy shit</p>
<p>he landed that</p>
<p>front kick to the face like harrison</p>
<p>does too that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy his legs are so</p>
<p>powerful and so fast he just springs up</p>
<p>you know god</p>
<p>damn he&rsquo;s got the most</p>
<p>ridiculous mesomorphic build ever</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>as far as like you look like the</p>
<p>classic mesomorph you know</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s different body</p>
<p>structures ectomorph</p>
<p>was it what</p>
<p>was the other one</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know any of</p>
<p>those morphs</p>
<p>mesomorph ectomorph</p>
<p>endomorph endomorph</p>
<p>endomorph is like it</p>
<p>never tend to be overweight</p>
<p>ectomorph is like really</p>
<p>skinny and mesomorphs are like</p>
<p>really wide</p>
<p>shoulders heavily muscled</p>
<p>like really like</p>
<p>super athlete builds</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got a perfect mesomorphic</p>
<p>build his like</p>
<p>his his hips are like really narrow</p>
<p>but then it</p>
<p>flares out like big shoulders</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spectacularly</p>
<p>like like the way he looks like he&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>bulldog yeah but no it&rsquo;s like looks like like a fucking</p>
<p>like a comic book</p>
<p>superhero isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>weird that it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like like on the on the fence of being</p>
<p>racist kind of like</p>
<p>if you bring up that you know</p>
<p>that the african</p>
<p>american build huh</p>
<p>oh they&rsquo;ve after you</p>
<p>bring up the african american</p>
<p>athlete this like</p>
<p>just takes over all</p>
<p>sports is like</p>
<p>you know what i even</p>
<p>talk about is guys who are</p>
<p>look guys like phil</p>
<p>davis and john</p>
<p>jones they work</p>
<p>fucking incredibly hard this is not just</p>
<p>a matter of guys who</p>
<p>are just genetically gifted and they don&rsquo;t have to try</p>
<p>no no the thing</p>
<p>that both those guys have in common besides being</p>
<p>black and besides being</p>
<p>super athletes</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>super fucking driven they work really hard</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re both really intelligent guys</p>
<p>who know what</p>
<p>they have to do and go throughout and didn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>so when anybody questions what they&rsquo;ve done to get</p>
<p>where they are they&rsquo;re like well fuck you</p>
<p>you know you know you</p>
<p>have no idea how much work i put in this is not easy</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still better at it than</p>
<p>other people i mean</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like they got all the ingredients like</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have you can&rsquo;t be a natural gifted athlete</p>
<p>and not work hard that&rsquo;s not good enough now you</p>
<p>gotta have both you</p>
<p>gotta work hard</p>
<p>and the edge</p>
<p>is the natural</p>
<p>stuff is the edge i&rsquo;m no</p>
<p>super athlete but when i was doing taekwondo</p>
<p>i know there</p>
<p>were certain people that i had physical advantages over</p>
<p>that they were undeniable</p>
<p>just having</p>
<p>larger bones for my size being able to hit harder</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s certain certain</p>
<p>things that you</p>
<p>know you know</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that weird how it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>racist to talk</p>
<p>about that shit i</p>
<p>could talk about it myself though because i&rsquo;m italian</p>
<p>look you know joey diaz was talking to me</p>
<p>about this on the</p>
<p>phone the other day</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like your</p>
<p>whole family they&rsquo;re fucking masons</p>
<p>masons from italy</p>
<p>those guineas</p>
<p>those guineas make good masons</p>
<p>because everybody else</p>
<p>tapped out everybody else is like fuck this i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>carrying rocks</p>
<p>the guineas like fuck you i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>carry these fucking rocks</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no different in a racist</p>
<p>way than the idea that</p>
<p>you know african americans were at one</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>slaves and they were bred to be larger and stronger</p>
<p>you know why is that why is that</p>
<p>racist is that</p>
<p>people got fired</p>
<p>jimmy the green absolutely</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that like been a proven fact</p>
<p>is it is it a proven fact</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a racist you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t bring yeah it&rsquo;s totally like a</p>
<p>racist to say that they have the fucking</p>
<p>greatest bodies of all time yeah</p>
<p>why that i wish is to say</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>greatest athletes ever</p>
<p>michael jordan i mean</p>
<p>could you stop</p>
<p>who the fuck is a</p>
<p>greater athlete than michael jordan</p>
<p>you remember when we were kids</p>
<p>used to see</p>
<p>those pictures of him flying</p>
<p>through the fucking air</p>
<p>what was the last time a white guy</p>
<p>was flying through the air in a</p>
<p>basketball game like that</p>
<p>i mean he could fly</p>
<p>you remember</p>
<p>those photos</p>
<p>in sports illustrated</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like there&rsquo;s no way that&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way that guy&rsquo;s that high in the air he</p>
<p>could fly it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the reason it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s they think i</p>
<p>think the people that</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s racist</p>
<p>see it as when they say if you</p>
<p>bring it up it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re a better athlete but</p>
<p>you know is because we owned you</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s a direct</p>
<p>you know what i mean it&rsquo;s that kind of feel</p>
<p>like well i</p>
<p>could see that yeah</p>
<p>all my relatives are</p>
<p>from italy and ireland so</p>
<p>nobody owned anybody in my family so</p>
<p>you might be half black joe</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m mostly sicilian</p>
<p>so if you follow the</p>
<p>movie true romance</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>black in my past it&rsquo;s such a beautiful you know what</p>
<p>if i could add a time machine and i can go back</p>
<p>and i could</p>
<p>mess with parallel dimensions and universes</p>
<p>i would choose a life where</p>
<p>i was in a world</p>
<p>where all the mexicans were enslaved</p>
<p>and they got created</p>
<p>like amazing athletes and then i was</p>
<p>a product of that</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t like for me</p>
<p>right now i</p>
<p>think that would be that&rsquo;s a cool</p>
<p>background i</p>
<p>think people were enslaved you know</p>
<p>for me i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand the</p>
<p>like you know cause</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not black so</p>
<p>they have a</p>
<p>whole different feeling i</p>
<p>think if i go back into my history if i</p>
<p>could get a time machine</p>
<p>jean and go back to the history of my dna</p>
<p>i think a long</p>
<p>evolution you know</p>
<p>if evolution is real and if one</p>
<p>point in time we were actually</p>
<p>lower hominids and we</p>
<p>evolved to become</p>
<p>humans and these hairless apes</p>
<p>i think there must be</p>
<p>stages along the way you know</p>
<p>and i think at one</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>one of my great great</p>
<p>ancestors fucked a</p>
<p>monkey probably shouldn&rsquo;t have been fucking anymore</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>one crazy monkey that was probably</p>
<p>gonna die out one</p>
<p>crazy wild monkey</p>
<p>and this more</p>
<p>evolved monkey was like goddamn but i am horny</p>
<p>and he shot a load of that crazy</p>
<p>monkey and that</p>
<p>monkey became like this hybrid</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where i</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my genetic lineage</p>
<p>i definitely came from</p>
<p>i definitely have just a hair more</p>
<p>monkey in them than the regular person</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no doubt about it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no doubt</p>
<p>about it i mean if we if you look at evolution</p>
<p>you know you look</p>
<p>at like evolve people you know who looks evolve to me</p>
<p>asian people do</p>
<p>asian people</p>
<p>they have less hair</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking awesome at math</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re incredibly hard workers</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about having these</p>
<p>these they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have this this</p>
<p>thing in japan</p>
<p>where the the nuclear</p>
<p>power plants have melted down dude</p>
<p>a bunch of people more than fifty are</p>
<p>gonna die for sure</p>
<p>cause they went in there to</p>
<p>clean that shit up</p>
<p>like they sacrifice themselves</p>
<p>yeah that shit would</p>
<p>never happen</p>
<p>if with my people</p>
<p>anybody in my family</p>
<p>anybody with my genetics that&rsquo;s not happening my</p>
<p>culture that&rsquo;s not happening we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna do that who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the japanese to me</p>
<p>that seems to be the most of all so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>racist against me</p>
<p>and i think i&rsquo;m closer to a</p>
<p>monkey than japanese people are i&rsquo;m a racist</p>
<p>against myself</p>
<p>speaking of fucking animals have you seen that</p>
<p>vice guide to</p>
<p>where they fuck donkeys</p>
<p>in colombia</p>
<p>holy shit yeah</p>
<p>that i didn&rsquo;t think they</p>
<p>would actually show it yeah or show like a 12 year old</p>
<p>that was trolling what if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trolled us it was all invented</p>
<p>they would be in</p>
<p>trouble they would be in trouble</p>
<p>already when that the 12 year old goes like i</p>
<p>i like to spread</p>
<p>the pink pussy</p>
<p>apart and it&rsquo;s so red</p>
<p>i love the fuck did</p>
<p>donkey pussy</p>
<p>fuck donkeys</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s so disturbing</p>
<p>who are they just</p>
<p>these get colombians yeah they</p>
<p>catch these guys fucking donkeys it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole bunch of them fucking donkeys</p>
<p>in this part of colombia</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>fucking animals anywhere it&rsquo;s happening in all cultures</p>
<p>with this part of colombia it&rsquo;s kind of well known</p>
<p>in their society that your first</p>
<p>sex is with a donkey</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s normal like</p>
<p>how weird is it that that is</p>
<p>going on the</p>
<p>exact same time</p>
<p>your neighborhood is</p>
<p>going on or your neighborhood</p>
<p>is going on you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>like you know you think</p>
<p>this is all</p>
<p>happening at the same time on this planet there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>parts of this planet</p>
<p>that are in a totally different</p>
<p>frequency than we are</p>
<p>right here yeah if i</p>
<p>lived in columbia in some</p>
<p>third world country</p>
<p>like that i&rsquo;d probably be fucking a donkey</p>
<p>every now and</p>
<p>then for goof</p>
<p>fuck it what else is there to do</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably not enough chicks</p>
<p>all the good ones get</p>
<p>taken up by the dictators</p>
<p>yeah you know what i</p>
<p>mean they all get the best ones they get em swooped up</p>
<p>do you imagine how</p>
<p>much it must suck to be born into some really fucking</p>
<p>crazy little</p>
<p>small country that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super poor and has dirt roads</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even realize how fucked up</p>
<p>everything is</p>
<p>until one day you go somewhere there&rsquo;s a tv</p>
<p>and you look at the tv and you see like manhattan</p>
<p>and shit and</p>
<p>buildings and skyscrapers and people eating dinner and</p>
<p>juicy steaks you like what the fuck</p>
<p>like where&rsquo;s all this happening</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re stuck with no</p>
<p>shoes on you get your</p>
<p>shoes are made out of</p>
<p>water bottles</p>
<p>ever seen those kids</p>
<p>they make flip flops out of</p>
<p>water bottles</p>
<p>have you seen that shit yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on right now man</p>
<p>going on right now in the world</p>
<p>they also said that in that document</p>
<p>that there was</p>
<p>like sometimes there&rsquo;s like that one slutty donkey</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just walking around the streets</p>
<p>and sometimes i was so horny i</p>
<p>would not even use a condom and now fuck</p>

<p>they&rsquo;d have to put it on a</p>
<p>daily motion</p>
<p>is there a website</p>
<p>for bestiality</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s illegal</p>

<p>house if you&rsquo;re watching animals get jacked well</p>

<p>statewide see the weird thing with</p>
<p>states laws is that&rsquo;s how that movie zoo got made</p>
<p>in some states it&rsquo;s still legal to fuck animals</p>
<p>and let animals fuck</p>

<p>crime as long as it looks like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>grown adult</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think that you get in</p>
<p>trouble for that i think damn</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed to be in</p>
<p>possession of it but i don&rsquo;t</p>

<p>every single</p>
<p>breed of dog</p>
<p>or the wildest animal if you can get a polar bear</p>
<p>you know anytime to figure it out anytime</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any sort of a controversial</p>
<p>thing like this</p>
<p>the fbi will</p>
<p>infiltrate these fucking groups</p>
<p>dude can you imagine that they want to fuck animals</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like well you know it</p>

<p>motherfucker you got me this donkey</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an american idol</p>
<p>thing so you</p>
<p>could fuck the craziest animal</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>setups like a chihuahua</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>setups like that like</p>
<p>dogs wouldn&rsquo;t even be in the ball punch</p>
<p>that people</p>
<p>would get into</p>
<p>like trying to get bears and shit</p>
<p>know what i mean the oddest ones</p>
<p>trying to get like a</p>
<p>hippopotamus</p>
<p>you got a rope around its neck</p>
<p>dude if there was a 5 million dollar</p>
<p>grand american idol prize</p>
<p>see you fucking crazy on video</p>
<p>five million dollars all we</p>
<p>would need is</p>
<p>a couple nuclear meltdowns in this country</p>
<p>lower the price of life</p>
<p>and then for sure that</p>
<p>could be a real show</p>
<p>who can fuck the craziest animal</p>
<p>next on spike after top</p>
<p>196 top season</p>
<p>196 because you know what that</p>
<p>first season is</p>
<p>still the ufc</p>
<p>heavyweight</p>
<p>champion cause now they</p>
<p>have genetic engineering he&rsquo;s fucking 200 years old</p>
<p>the first year</p>
<p>a koala bear the</p>
<p>first year they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>crazy wild animals</p>
<p>have to build</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>build like by the</p>
<p>third and fourth season</p>
<p>you you know</p>
<p>what i mean they&rsquo;re getting crazier and crazier</p>
<p>like the craziest</p>
<p>would be like a fucking</p>
<p>killer whale so</p>
<p>realistically there&rsquo;s not much difference between the</p>
<p>human beings of</p>
<p>today and the</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re having people fight</p>
<p>tigers in the</p>
<p>roman empire</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the same fucking people</p>
<p>the only thing</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ve managed to not have a</p>
<p>giant natural disaster between then and now</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve accumulated a</p>
<p>bunch of data on how you shouldn&rsquo;t act</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only reason why we don&rsquo;t have people</p>
<p>fighting tigers</p>
<p>in the middle of a fucking</p>
<p>arena today</p>
<p>cause if somebody put it out today</p>
<p>we would there</p>
<p>would be a bunch of people that</p>
<p>would be into it</p>
<p>and if anything ever happened to the people today</p>
<p>there was some fucking</p>
<p>asteroid impact</p>
<p>that killed off half of us</p>
<p>and the people survived it was all fucking</p>
<p>chaos and made</p>
<p>for sure within 100 years</p>
<p>people would be fighting</p>
<p>tigers in an</p>
<p>arena again it</p>
<p>would start</p>
<p>all over again and</p>
<p>when what year did they</p>
<p>get that bad</p>
<p>how did that come</p>
<p>about cause</p>
<p>they had come a</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>dude we can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t having</p>
<p>it all died off the empire died off</p>
<p>that was the i mean</p>
<p>i think you know probably</p>
<p>today somewhere</p>
<p>if you got enough</p>
<p>money you can get a dude to</p>
<p>fight a tiger</p>
<p>you know yeah was it the fall of the</p>
<p>roman empire yeah yeah</p>
<p>definitely they didn&rsquo;t have it they didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>move it to greece or</p>
<p>you know to england</p>
<p>why not i think the</p>
<p>romans were</p>
<p>the ones who were into the coliseum and all the</p>
<p>crazy fights that they</p>
<p>would set up</p>
<p>they must have been the</p>
<p>gangsterest</p>
<p>family ever to take over</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the head of the</p>
<p>roman empire</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the fucking emperor</p>
<p>of the greatest</p>
<p>like ancient empire</p>
<p>the romans dominated all they</p>
<p>smashed everybody</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the emperor</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having fucking orgies</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>people fight lions in</p>
<p>front of you</p>
<p>you know what that</p>
<p>must have been like back then there was no internet no</p>
<p>television and this guy was the king of rome</p>
<p>the emperor of</p>
<p>board is fuck</p>
<p>stand up and he</p>
<p>would fucking give</p>
<p>speeches to the death</p>
<p>and that was the words thousands of men raising</p>
<p>their spears</p>
<p>cheering for you</p>
<p>i bet that had something to do with getting</p>
<p>elected like this</p>
<p>motherfucker he comes with the</p>
<p>crazy shit at</p>
<p>first it was gladiators</p>
<p>fighting each other</p>
<p>then animals</p>
<p>fighting animals then guys</p>
<p>fighting animals like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a new campaign to get</p>
<p>and i think the</p>
<p>whole royalty</p>
<p>thing probably all</p>
<p>started off because everybody</p>
<p>wants to think</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re the man everybody wants to think that</p>
<p>they could be</p>
<p>the guy running shit</p>
<p>if you think you&rsquo;re around like a regular</p>
<p>dude you&rsquo;re like this dude isn&rsquo;t better than me i</p>
<p>could be better than that guy that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>classic male ego problem</p>
<p>but if you get someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s elevated to the</p>
<p>point of royalty</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t even question you can&rsquo;t get to know them</p>
<p>you are not allowed to get to know them</p>
<p>so you never get to</p>
<p>crack the puzzle</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be sitting</p>
<p>right next to them going this</p>
<p>motherfucker&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy you&rsquo;re running shit</p>
<p>why are you running shit</p>
<p>hey everybody</p>
<p>get over here</p>
<p>so this guy we&rsquo;re calling the king</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy asshole</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s banging his daughters</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s fucking killing people for a goof and</p>
<p>having his wives</p>
<p>executed he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy we gotta stop letting him run shit</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just a regular person</p>
<p>you know but they</p>
<p>never got a</p>
<p>chance to say he&rsquo;s just a regular person you can get</p>
<p>close to him</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only way a person can really rule</p>
<p>they have to rule</p>
<p>as if there&rsquo;s something outside of the human race</p>
<p>they have to rule like a deity they have to</p>
<p>rule like they&rsquo;re a god they have to rule like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even come</p>
<p>close to them</p>
<p>you gotta get on your knees sire</p>
<p>thank you for hearing my words</p>
<p>you know you have</p>
<p>to get on your knees and not make eye contact with him</p>
<p>and then when he put his hand out you</p>
<p>would kiss it</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you had to have that trick</p>
<p>to keep an empire together</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t have access to information</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>ultimate example of how</p>
<p>those empires</p>
<p>the more access to information the more you</p>
<p>realize that the guy in charge is just fucking crazy</p>
<p>the less likely</p>
<p>it is to be able to have something like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why all</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>empires are falling</p>
<p>apart all over the</p>
<p>world man that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>egypt what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in</p>
<p>egypt with mubarak</p>
<p>and while in libya</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to get rid of qaddafi</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of american</p>
<p>black ops involved as well there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of cia shit that</p>
<p>you know forcing</p>
<p>these people out because they&rsquo;re probably sitting on a</p>
<p>giant pool of oil</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t listened</p>
<p>to it because</p>
<p>information because they&rsquo;re getting information</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t listened to the alex</p>
<p>jones version of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in</p>
<p>libya i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole different version</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very interested and i just</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had time alex i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t heard it either i haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard it either i can&rsquo;t when shit is really happening</p>

<p>the last time i want to listen to alex</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;ll get you distracted</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s eugenics</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing</p>

<p>jones rules</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s awesome he&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s out of his mind</p>
<p>i think alex</p>
<p>jones is dead on the</p>
<p>money like 70</p>
<p>of the time that&rsquo;s what scares the shit out of me</p>
<p>all the crazy</p>
<p>stuff that he</p>
<p>throws in there</p>
<p>i mean maybe he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t know seems</p>
<p>crazy to me</p>
<p>but the real</p>
<p>stuff that he&rsquo;s dead on the</p>
<p>money about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>cheapened by all the</p>
<p>other the histronics the craziness he knew</p>
<p>that with the</p>
<p>japan thing</p>
<p>he knew about</p>
<p>those explosions like</p>
<p>days before they</p>
<p>would announce them</p>
<p>they were not</p>
<p>admitting shit</p>
<p>he would get shit like somehow</p>
<p>could have been</p>
<p>a lucky call</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why he&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>alive how come they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t tried to kill him</p>
<p>so powerful man</p>
<p>you know you look you don&rsquo;t have to kill him for what</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not stopping anything</p>
<p>no one stopping anything</p>
<p>and you know what things the</p>
<p>things that get exposed they&rsquo;re supposed to get exposed</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like the perez hilton</p>
<p>of the fucking</p>
<p>the the the political</p>
<p>world that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know he&rsquo;s exposing shit that</p>
<p>you know what you fucked up anyway</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t have been doing it this way anyway stupid</p>
<p>you know this is wrong</p>
<p>and everybody</p>
<p>is in government it&rsquo;s not like everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>evil in government</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of fucking</p>
<p>stupid poor choices that get made</p>
<p>and the better they get exposed the better it is for</p>
<p>everybody even the people that are governing the people</p>
<p>they need to be</p>
<p>checked too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like everybody in government is evil they</p>
<p>have to be evil they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be evil</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>go into government with good intentions but</p>
<p>along the way</p>
<p>they get stifled by corruption and bullshit</p>
<p>so this is all good for everybody</p>
<p>this is good for everybody when shit like this happens</p>
<p>but some of the</p>
<p>stuff that he says</p>
<p>is terrifying</p>
<p>like one thing that got</p>
<p>passed by everybody that you</p>
<p>never hear discussed was during the</p>
<p>world trade organization meetings in seattle</p>
<p>you remember</p>
<p>those imagine</p>
<p>where the people were stopped from protesting</p>
<p>this is what happened there was</p>
<p>peaceful protests</p>
<p>it was a long time ago i</p>
<p>think it was like</p>
<p>i want to say 2001 but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just oh yeah</p>
<p>i just pulled that out of my ass i</p>
<p>think it was actually before that no it was before that</p>
<p>because it was before 9 11 it was</p>
<p>quite a bit</p>
<p>where those</p>
<p>the protesters were</p>
<p>actually cia guys yeah well the protesters were cops</p>
<p>they were paid anarchists</p>
<p>there were people that were sent in</p>
<p>to go in and</p>
<p>cause chaos and</p>
<p>break windows and they all wore</p>
<p>ski masks and they all wore military</p>
<p>issue boots</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>nobody knew them they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t involved in the rest of the protest</p>
<p>the protest was</p>
<p>peaceful and inconvenient</p>
<p>because all</p>
<p>these foreign delegates and all</p>
<p>these people were coming</p>
<p>these representatives of foreign</p>
<p>countries were coming to that one place</p>
<p>and to have all this protest around</p>
<p>was embarrassing</p>
<p>and it was disturbing and it was</p>
<p>causing a lot of press</p>
<p>like they were having to</p>
<p>answer a lot of questions about it</p>
<p>so they turned it into</p>
<p>a violent display</p>
<p>they turned it into a violent</p>
<p>process that</p>
<p>being the government</p>
<p>they came in</p>
<p>with guys that were in military outfits</p>
<p>and they would wear ski masks on and they</p>
<p>broke windows and they</p>
<p>smashed and alex</p>
<p>jones documents</p>
<p>every single aspect of it including these guys</p>
<p>going into a safe</p>
<p>house and being</p>
<p>allowed to negotiate and eventually all being released</p>
<p>he documents all this and</p>
<p>he does it with news reports</p>
<p>and he does it with</p>
<p>video footage</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pretty fucking crazy</p>
<p>because what they did is they shut down a protest</p>
<p>they sent some fucking goons in</p>
<p>and they shut down a protest</p>
<p>and this isn&rsquo;t nazi germany</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>roman empire</p>
<p>this is the united</p>
<p>states of america</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy it&rsquo;s fucking nuts and it&rsquo;s 100</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like this is a conspiracy theory</p>
<p>they stopped people from walking through with</p>
<p>things that said wto with a red line on it</p>
<p>how fucking un american is that anything is possible</p>
<p>after that yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that you can&rsquo;t go in with a pin</p>
<p>that says world</p>
<p>trade organization</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re opposed to it</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have an opinion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not even offensive</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>swears no curses it&rsquo;s not something that</p>
<p>would hurt children</p>
<p>you know you just have a wto</p>
<p>with a red line</p>
<p>through it and you&rsquo;re telling me i can&rsquo;t go to work</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t let people into</p>
<p>buildings they had cops there with guns</p>
<p>they were telling people you have to take that</p>
<p>shirt off you have to take that pin off they have</p>
<p>videos of this in fucking america</p>
<p>they created a no protest zone</p>
<p>so just for the</p>
<p>stuff like that that alex exposes</p>
<p>whether or not he&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>about a missile hitting the pentagon or any of that</p>
<p>other stuff shit i don&rsquo;t know man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough time in the</p>
<p>world to be</p>
<p>dwelling on all this shit</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>about enough he&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>about a couple</p>
<p>things but if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>judge a guy</p>
<p>based on like</p>
<p>oh he was wrong</p>
<p>about this so he can&rsquo;t know anything else</p>
<p>you know then none of us</p>
<p>would have any opinions that mattered</p>
<p>he has fucked up a little bit here and there but</p>
<p>man i believe the shit he tells me i believe</p>

<p>agree on in this planet we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree on shit</p>
<p>every country</p>
<p>even the same religion</p>
<p>it all depends on whether or not by the time the</p>
<p>apocalypse hits we&rsquo;ve created artificial people</p>
<p>if we created like whores</p>
<p>artificial whores</p>
<p>you know soulless mindless</p>
<p>robot whores that you</p>

<p>you know i watch all</p>
<p>those ray kurtz wheel</p>
<p>lectures and</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>read some of his</p>
<p>papers and some of his articles</p>
<p>about the singularity</p>
<p>and the idea of artificial intelligence and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all gonna happen</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna stop i mean we&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>so much between now</p>
<p>and just a couple</p>
<p>hundred years ago the difference between our life now</p>
<p>and like i was</p>
<p>watching the unforgiven the</p>
<p>other day on a plane</p>
<p>still badass bro</p>
<p>still badass from like</p>
<p>1990 whatever the fuck it was</p>
<p>that movie is awesome the clint eastwood is the shit</p>
<p>especially in that</p>
<p>movie that&rsquo;s the best western movie ever</p>
<p>but i looked at the way</p>
<p>these fucking people were living and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>my god that&rsquo;s less than 200 years ago</p>
<p>less than 200 years ago</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re riding</p>
<p>horses and getting rained on and shit</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going into these</p>
<p>places and the</p>
<p>houses are made of wood and they&rsquo;re leaking like</p>
<p>crazy because of the rain</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t even know how to make roofs</p>
<p>right back then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably also just like dramatic</p>
<p>scenes in a</p>
<p>movie don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think back then</p>
<p>if you had a leaky roof like you&rsquo;d be on that</p>
<p>thing not the shower</p>
<p>and not jean hackman</p>
<p>the sheriff</p>
<p>you know what the fuck there&rsquo;s nothing else to do</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no fucking internet</p>
<p>fucking bothers like oh i have a leaky room</p>
<p>movie geeks</p>
<p>right now like that</p>
<p>was part of the character development of gene hackman</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s supposed to be incompetent but yet cocky</p>
<p>and that was the</p>
<p>whole reason why it was so satisfying</p>
<p>the kleenes</p>
<p>would killed him in the end okay dude</p>
<p>i know i know we&rsquo;re just having fun here you fucks</p>

<p>these guys that hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>to be staying in the garage</p>
<p>they just wanted a</p>
<p>place to sleep for the night</p>
<p>before they made it to town</p>
<p>they were literally like going into</p>
<p>knocking on people&rsquo;s doors can you help us they</p>

<p>the same people that</p>
<p>would buy that</p>
<p>fake weed that you see in like high times</p>
<p>that was always the most</p>
<p>disappointing shit ever</p>
<p>about high times</p>
<p>they would always</p>
<p>be down for legalization as down</p>
<p>meanwhile you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>selling fake weed you&rsquo;re ripping people off man</p>
<p>those are the</p>
<p>sponsors yeah but so what</p>
<p>your sponsors are crook</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a problem with your</p>
<p>sponsor only praying on retards</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>sponsor did</p>
<p>if you bought that</p>
<p>stuff you had</p>
<p>to be like a 10 year old boy or a retarded person</p>
<p>there should be something</p>
<p>wrong with you</p>
<p>dude said that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how high times</p>
<p>survives is with our</p>
<p>money because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>every other page there&rsquo;s like i refuse to</p>
<p>admit i refuse to believe that in a nation</p>
<p>of 300 million and who knows how many pot smokers</p>
<p>is there 30 million of us</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 30</p>
<p>million pot smokers in this country i refuse to believe</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t produce a quality</p>
<p>magazine that was interesting</p>
<p>and that had to do with people who</p>
<p>smoke pot who</p>
<p>engage in different</p>
<p>activities and show how much marijuana enhances</p>
<p>their life instead of the same old</p>
<p>stupid shit that they have in</p>
<p>those magazines every week</p>
<p>every week there&rsquo;s a girl in bikinis she&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>a bud in her hand whoa look at the bud it&rsquo;s crazy and</p>
<p>look at the</p>
<p>picture in the middle</p>
<p>amazing leave a</p>
<p>picture of the bud</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not saying</p>
<p>anything different it&rsquo;s all the same goddamn shit</p>
<p>and magazine industry so dead now that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the reason why they have to sell this fucking fake weed</p>
<p>shit that fake weed shit is insulting</p>
<p>you that is like</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>allowing someone to</p>
<p>steal from your fans</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowing someone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like if i had this</p>
<p>thing and if the</p>
<p>flashlight wasn&rsquo;t our</p>
<p>sponsor and i decided to</p>
<p>get some other</p>
<p>like big dick pills</p>
<p>you know a big dick</p>
<p>what a hypocrite</p>
<p>what a creepy person i would be</p>
<p>if i was allowing</p>
<p>these people to get ripped off by something you know</p>
<p>allowing i was</p>
<p>promoting something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got pages of this shit</p>
<p>these fake fucking buds</p>
<p>have you ever tried that</p>
<p>no i haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tried it i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard it actually works get</p>
<p>the fuck out of here that shit</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work i actually</p>
<p>heard it works no the</p>
<p>stuff that k two</p>
<p>stuff that they made illegal that</p>
<p>stuff works</p>
<p>but that shit they&rsquo;ve been selling in high times</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the shit they</p>
<p>smoke in movies man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the shit that mitch hedberg smoked with</p>
<p>peter frampton remember that joke</p>
<p>mm hmm you remember that joke when chadberg did</p>
<p>he goes how does</p>
<p>mcedberg do it he goes</p>
<p>i once smoked fake pot in a movie</p>
<p>with peter frampton</p>
<p>he goes that&rsquo;s way better</p>
<p>than smoking a real pot</p>
<p>with a dude who looks like peter pan</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve done that way more times</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>fucking mitch</p>
<p>he was awesome man he was amazing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a guy that man when he died i went shit</p>
<p>like that that really was like god damn it</p>
<p>we lost a good one do you know what&rsquo;s so fucking weird</p>
<p>about you saying that</p>
<p>whole entire</p>
<p>story because the person</p>
<p>that told me last that that shit worked and she was</p>
<p>his ex oh well</p>
<p>then then well</p>
<p>maybe she was talking</p>
<p>about that k2</p>
<p>stuff that stuffs are</p>
<p>legit how weird that she&rsquo;s talking that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>weird is that just recently</p>
<p>yeah it was like a</p>
<p>month ago guarantee you she&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about the the</p>
<p>synthetic marijuana</p>
<p>which does work</p>
<p>that stuff they&rsquo;re making it illegal</p>
<p>everywhere because it does work they&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>modified it</p>
<p>somehow or another so that it&rsquo;s not technically</p>
<p>the same thing as marijuana it just</p>
<p>becomes you know</p>
<p>they can do that that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they also did with</p>
<p>those bath salts</p>
<p>things remember we thought it was bath salts</p>
<p>but it really was is they were selling it</p>
<p>as bath so they</p>
<p>could sell it in it</p>
<p>but it really was just amphetamines you know</p>
<p>they can change the chemical components of</p>
<p>something and make it something that&rsquo;s not classified</p>
<p>like you know like oh</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s this new</p>
<p>thing what is this this isn&rsquo;t even illegal</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>they have also</p>
<p>some laws in certain</p>
<p>places where</p>
<p>things become illegal if they&rsquo;re related</p>
<p>to other things being illegal</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why five meo dmt was</p>
<p>never classified as a</p>
<p>schedule one but it&rsquo;s the most potent</p>
<p>form of dmt</p>
<p>and you used to be able to buy it online man</p>
<p>you used to</p>
<p>be able to go to american chemical company all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>places and just buy dmt online</p>
<p>but then because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>related to an end dmt</p>
<p>which is illegal</p>
<p>they made it</p>
<p>illegal and they stopped people from selling it online</p>
<p>and they made them very</p>
<p>aware that there were consequences</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s not technically an illegal substance</p>
<p>so what would</p>
<p>happen if you got arrested in for it i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tricky you&rsquo;d be able to</p>
<p>fight it probably</p>
<p>see the real</p>
<p>thing with all these</p>
<p>schedule one substances is the last</p>
<p>thing they want is scrutiny</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want anybody looking</p>
<p>at them they don&rsquo;t want to make a new one illegal</p>
<p>because then people</p>
<p>start looking at</p>
<p>what makes it illegal</p>
<p>and what is</p>
<p>legal and then the argument</p>
<p>comes up well how can that be illegal when this is</p>
<p>legal and that&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>and this is sold at</p>
<p>every pharmaceutical</p>
<p>company all across the</p>
<p>country it&rsquo;s been shown to be incredibly addictive and</p>
<p>this destroys your</p>
<p>liver but doctors prescribe it like</p>
<p>candy you know</p>
<p>they would open up the doors of scrutiny so what they</p>
<p>would rather do</p>
<p>is threaten people</p>
<p>close all these companies down that are</p>
<p>selling all this shit and not change any of the laws</p>
<p>just go hey shut the fuck up sit the fuck down</p>
<p>this is the government here</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what they do</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want everybody looking at it because if you look at it</p>
<p>at a certain</p>
<p>point in time when you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>grown man i am a</p>
<p>43 year old</p>
<p>grown man okay</p>
<p>and if another</p>
<p>grown man my</p>
<p>age or god forbid even younger</p>
<p>is telling me what i can and can&rsquo;t do with my body</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t hurt anybody</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even have research to back it up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>i saw that movie</p>
<p>limitless the other day</p>
<p>pretty fucking interesting</p>
<p>movie is that the one</p>
<p>where he opens up his mind yes he uses</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bradley cooper movie</p>
<p>pretty interesting</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t enjoy the end</p>
<p>spoiler alert</p>
<p>is it hug your ears</p>
<p>effects the</p>
<p>idea pretty</p>
<p>sweet though i thought yes</p>
<p>the end was wack</p>
<p>the end was like oh he&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>all the time now</p>
<p>sorry the end i win you lose</p>
<p>it was so stupid what</p>
<p>about sucker</p>
<p>punch hold on</p>
<p>hold on a second</p>
<p>but the thing</p>
<p>about that is that there were massive consequences</p>
<p>like he would like lose time</p>
<p>it became got people were</p>
<p>dying from it</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just as simple as you take this thing</p>
<p>it accelerates you and then you just</p>
<p>live like an awesome person for the rest of your life</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s consequences now if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>prove consequences then</p>
<p>you have zero</p>
<p>argument and that&rsquo;s the real argument the real problem</p>
<p>with psychedelic drugs being illegal</p>
<p>you have all</p>
<p>these people saying that they&rsquo;ve helped them all</p>
<p>these people that are</p>
<p>going and taking that</p>
<p>ibegain like</p>
<p>ed clay our friend</p>
<p>ed clay who</p>
<p>changed his life who</p>
<p>changed who he is</p>
<p>and became this really fucking</p>
<p>warm open person</p>
<p>after going on</p>
<p>these ibogaine</p>
<p>retreats and that&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>why is it illegal there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>study showing it harms you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only studies</p>
<p>showing that people have benefited from it</p>
<p>and so many people talk</p>
<p>about it glowingly</p>
<p>and yet you have</p>
<p>other grown adults</p>
<p>telling you</p>
<p>what you can and can&rsquo;t experience</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re the same</p>
<p>age as you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous that&rsquo;s nonsense</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lack of reality</p>
<p>and a lack of openness</p>
<p>when it comes to discussing</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>these things are</p>
<p>never discussed</p>
<p>in politics</p>
<p>these are huge issues</p>
<p>the issues of</p>
<p>being able to control your consciousness is a</p>
<p>giant issue</p>
<p>and the fact that that&rsquo;s not discussed ever during</p>
<p>presidential campaigns</p>
<p>show us how infantile we are</p>
<p>at the very least</p>
<p>occasionally it gets breached</p>
<p>mr obama did you ever</p>
<p>smoke marijuana</p>
<p>and if so did you inhale</p>
<p>yes i did i thought that was the</p>
<p>point that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the in</p>
<p>depth version</p>
<p>of the discussion on marijuana</p>
<p>obama admits to</p>
<p>smoking marijuana and inhaling</p>
<p>says that was the</p>
<p>point amazing oh</p>
<p>and everybody</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re little children it&rsquo;s like as a nation</p>
<p>in our entirety</p>
<p>we have the attitude</p>
<p>about drugs</p>
<p>about marijuana</p>
<p>about psychedelics</p>
<p>that an 11 year old has</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we</p>
<p>treat it like</p>
<p>what are you doing with that</p>
<p>what are you doing with that bad</p>
<p>boy yeah we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>little fucking children</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the biggest issues i</p>
<p>think as far as consciousness goes</p>
<p>that is in the</p>
<p>world one of the number one issues</p>
<p>the ability to control your consciousness</p>
<p>the ability to seek personal</p>
<p>evolution through</p>
<p>psychedelic experience</p>
<p>these are huge issues</p>
<p>these are issues that</p>
<p>radically transformed you</p>
<p>radically transformed me</p>
<p>radically transformed you you we&rsquo;ve all been</p>
<p>transformed</p>
<p>by psychedelic</p>
<p>experience a guy named</p>
<p>kelly mullis</p>
<p>who won a nobel</p>
<p>peace prize or</p>
<p>i guess it is a nobel</p>
<p>peace prize for</p>
<p>work in dna</p>
<p>discovery no science nobel science yeah he was the guy</p>
<p>founded on lsd right</p>
<p>yes yeah yes exactly he did it</p>
<p>while he was fucked up</p>
<p>on what yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember what the the the finding was</p>
<p>but that guy actually is a bad example</p>
<p>because something</p>
<p>about the intern</p>
<p>crazy when he got</p>
<p>older really yeah became like real belligerent getting</p>
<p>crazy arguments with people and became a nut case</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of weird</p>
<p>stuff about him</p>
<p>another interesting one is francis crick</p>
<p>francis crick</p>
<p>apparently this is all</p>
<p>hearsay because</p>
<p>the article says very explicitly that francis crick</p>
<p>told this man that if he</p>
<p>printed a word of this he</p>
<p>would sue and they</p>
<p>printed it obviously</p>
<p>after crick</p>
<p>died but crick</p>
<p>the guy who</p>
<p>he said that</p>
<p>he came up with the idea of the double helix for dna</p>
<p>while he was on acid</p>
<p>but again this is a guy who says that crick</p>
<p>said that the problem is with</p>
<p>anything like that is that people are full of shit</p>
<p>why would they lie i don&rsquo;t know but they could have</p>
<p>and they do a lot you know people fucking lie like</p>
<p>crazy man we were talking</p>
<p>about that game show in my head episode that i did</p>
<p>i told you about this shit when we had people</p>
<p>talk about ufos on</p>
<p>video we had a</p>
<p>pretend news camera to tell you</p>
<p>about this the stunt</p>
<p>this is what</p>
<p>we did the game show in my head was a fun ass show</p>
<p>and what was interesting</p>
<p>about it was there was a contestant and i had</p>
<p>a microphone</p>
<p>and i would talk in</p>
<p>their ear with a little earpiece</p>
<p>and i would tell them</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>stunt this is what you</p>
<p>gotta do they didn&rsquo;t know what was</p>
<p>gonna happen they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where they were</p>
<p>we had them in a van</p>
<p>and then we</p>
<p>would open the door and say walk to that mark on the</p>
<p>floor and then joe will be talking to you in your ear</p>
<p>they would walk to that mark</p>
<p>i go all right dude you</p>
<p>ready to do this he goes yeah here&rsquo;s what we got</p>
<p>you are a news reporter</p>
<p>okay there was just a ufo</p>
<p>sighting right here in hollywood</p>
<p>it was huge a</p>
<p>giant flying</p>
<p>saucer was here</p>
<p>and it took off</p>
<p>now you lost your witness</p>
<p>the witness was</p>
<p>gonna go on camera</p>
<p>and he was gonna tell everybody</p>
<p>about this ufo experience</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna look really</p>
<p>stupid because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the camera here and there&rsquo;s no witness</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna try to ask one of</p>
<p>these people to pretend it was them</p>
<p>and that was</p>
<p>their stunt</p>
<p>and every person they got to do it</p>
<p>i think if they got</p>
<p>three people to do it</p>
<p>they won 5 000 bucks</p>
<p>awesome dude</p>
<p>people did it instantly</p>
<p>they did it instantly</p>
<p>they started goes</p>
<p>hey i wonder</p>
<p>if you could do me a</p>
<p>favor there was ufo here</p>
<p>earlier apparently</p>
<p>some people saw it and it was witnesses but i</p>
<p>i guess they chickened</p>
<p>out with the</p>
<p>cameras here like i don&rsquo;t know what to do i mean</p>
<p>do you think you</p>
<p>could pretend that it was you yeah man</p>
<p>yeah but you</p>
<p>could be on a tv</p>
<p>right now yeah yeah yeah okay</p>
<p>people would just</p>
<p>start talking what happened</p>
<p>oh man it was a</p>
<p>black bright light and</p>
<p>then the ufo came and</p>
<p>they just started talking</p>
<p>it was incredible</p>
<p>we were all sitting in the</p>
<p>truck what was happening we were shaking our heads</p>
<p>going wow how full of shit are people</p>
<p>people would just</p>
<p>start talking about shit</p>
<p>that was my</p>
<p>point i mean it&rsquo;s like i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if francis crick</p>
<p>story about dna was true yeah it was a lot of fun man</p>
<p>you were talking</p>
<p>earlier about</p>
<p>ed clay yeah</p>
<p>the way that</p>
<p>changed his life</p>
<p>ed clay was</p>
<p>a very successful</p>
<p>entrepreneur</p>
<p>who got you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>smart guy great guy who got very driven</p>
<p>you know he did jujutsu he</p>
<p>had he has an</p>
<p>mma academy</p>
<p>he was always hurt so</p>
<p>like a lot of</p>
<p>mma athletes</p>
<p>he got addicted to pills</p>
<p>he got it was really bad it really was was a</p>
<p>fucking up his life in a big way</p>
<p>he heard about eyeball</p>
<p>gain and eyeball gain is like the african version</p>
<p>of dmt in a nutshell</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s and what</p>
<p>i will gain does</p>
<p>ayahuasca apparently</p>
<p>cures alcoholism</p>
<p>and ibogaine cures</p>
<p>in a high percentage rate</p>
<p>ibogaine cures addiction a certain pills</p>
<p>and ed clay heard</p>
<p>about it he went it&rsquo;s illegal in the united</p>
<p>states he went to mexico</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this ibogaine retreat in mexico in the city</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>trippers and they&rsquo;ve all done iboga</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve done a</p>
<p>hiawatha all of them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like a city</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>music always said there was music</p>
<p>twenty four</p>
<p>hours you land in mexico city</p>
<p>you drive four</p>
<p>hours you&rsquo;re in this village everyone&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>music there&rsquo;s artists</p>
<p>everywhere there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>music constants</p>
<p>twenty four</p>
<p>seven you hear</p>
<p>people like singing and dancing and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>music and and</p>
<p>he went to this</p>
<p>place he did</p>
<p>the eyeball</p>
<p>gang treatment</p>
<p>which takes</p>
<p>takes you on a trip</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like ayahuasca that last</p>
<p>like two days</p>
<p>or something like that last for a long time and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>you get to see yourself and you get to see the</p>
<p>world for what it is</p>
<p>and what it does is</p>
<p>somehow it does something to your</p>
<p>brain receptors or something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a realization of who you really are and it</p>
<p>resets your</p>
<p>receptors in some</p>

<p>issue in this country</p>
<p>where that thing</p>
<p>which is so helpful</p>
<p>is illegal and</p>
<p>these things that are so</p>
<p>damaging and so</p>
<p>scary are legal</p>
<p>and they lied</p>
<p>about how addictive they are when they got them through</p>
<p>when they made</p>
<p>fucking oxycontins</p>
<p>legal there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of documents that show that they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t being honest about the</p>
<p>possibility of addiction that</p>
<p>stuff&rsquo;s heroin man</p>
<p>that stuff gets so many my friend</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t wanna say his name</p>

<p>that became pill zombies</p>
<p>while i knew them</p>

<p>that if you&rsquo;re out there and you have a pill problem</p>
<p>or you know somebody that has a pill problem</p>
<p>look into ibo game ibo</p>

<p>ed clay if you look him up</p>
<p>um he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>everything he can to to help as many people as possible</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>funny that i will gain was the drug that got hunter</p>
<p>s thompson and in</p>
<p>trouble when he was a</p>
<p>journalist when he was</p>
<p>covering the</p>
<p>hunter s thompson was such a fucking</p>
<p>genius writer and such an interesting guy</p>
<p>and what he did was he was</p>
<p>covering the elections</p>
<p>like 1970 something whatever the fuck it was</p>
<p>and he just decided to</p>
<p>start making shit up</p>
<p>so he started making shit up</p>
<p>about these</p>
<p>candidates and one of the</p>
<p>things that he said was that</p>
<p>ed musky brought in a brazilian doctor</p>
<p>and because he&rsquo;s addicted to ibogaine</p>
<p>and he shows like all the symptoms</p>
<p>of ibogaine addiction and he put this shit and this is</p>
<p>printed in the rolling stone</p>
<p>so everybody thought this was real</p>
<p>everybody thought</p>
<p>so they started asking him</p>
<p>about it and the guy slowly</p>
<p>started breaking down</p>
<p>the guy started going</p>
<p>crazy publicly</p>
<p>like the pressure got to him</p>
<p>and he would give</p>
<p>these public</p>
<p>speeches and everybody</p>
<p>would be accusing him of being on some crazy drug</p>
<p>and so hunters thompson</p>
<p>like literally</p>
<p>drove this guy insane by writing that he was on drugs</p>
<p>the guy there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>video of the guy</p>
<p>in the movie gonzo you see</p>
<p>this video the guy</p>
<p>breaking down at a campaign speech</p>
<p>just loses his mind it was ibogaine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>thompson had said that</p>
<p>he was addicted to and then another guy was addicted to</p>
<p>so he made up a name of</p>
<p>speed called wallet</p>
<p>some exotic</p>
<p>brand of speed</p>
<p>imagine that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking running for president back in the seventies</p>
<p>and that shit happens</p>
<p>you know you get this</p>
<p>crazy asshole</p>
<p>just making shit up</p>
<p>about you and</p>
<p>there was no internet there was no nothing</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t you couldn&rsquo;t go on tv and talk about it</p>
<p>and it was really</p>
<p>funny man it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>interesting shit he goes why didn&rsquo;t i goes there was</p>
<p>there was a rumor</p>
<p>going around milwaukee</p>
<p>that he was addicted to ibegain</p>
<p>and i was one</p>
<p>started to rumor</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like all i said was there was a rumor</p>
<p>he goes i was actually pretty factual</p>
<p>in my i described it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very funny man did you see a sucker</p>
<p>punch at all not yet</p>
<p>i heard it&rsquo;s awesome though</p>
<p>no it looks pretty</p>
<p>badass so bad look you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great did you see it did you see it no i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen it but i only saw i guess the</p>
<p>the teaser preview</p>
<p>yeah in the</p>
<p>past i just saw like the real preview holy shit i</p>
<p>never saw the</p>
<p>whole preview</p>
<p>did you go to see that</p>
<p>movie and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>stoned you should go to jail</p>
<p>why is that</p>
<p>movie not in 3d though</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m pissed it&rsquo;s not i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s in 3d</p>
<p>really yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an imax but it&rsquo;s not an imax 3d you know what man i</p>
<p>gotta be honest</p>
<p>the movie has to be</p>
<p>super special for me to be into it in 3d</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m annoyed wearing</p>
<p>those stupid</p>
<p>glasses those</p>
<p>things bother me</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>i like the visuals i like the</p>
<p>glasses i don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>glasses bug the shit out of me</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>you know i shouldn&rsquo;t say that because it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t bug me in every</p>
<p>movie because in avatar it was so</p>
<p>spectacular that it didn&rsquo;t bug me</p>
<p>i saw battle la and that was the biggest</p>
<p>picture how was that</p>
<p>movie oh my god</p>
<p>it looked like</p>
<p>it looked like to me</p>
<p>it was you know from the</p>
<p>point of view of a</p>
<p>bunch of marines</p>
<p>fighting getting called to</p>
<p>fight these</p>
<p>aliens that landed on in la and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting them through la</p>
<p>it looks like a video game</p>
<p>like infomercial kind</p>
<p>it looked like a</p>
<p>trick it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the plot was so bad it was so bad</p>
<p>it was so bad the gears of war</p>
<p>would have a way better plot oh man the way they got</p>
<p>the way they won and they beat the aliens</p>
<p>oh don&rsquo;t even tell me i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know it&rsquo;s just what we were talking</p>
<p>about earlier with the mma</p>
<p>movie the fast and furious</p>
<p>the same thing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of people making dumbass movies</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the reason</p>
<p>why man this is what you don&rsquo;t realize or</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t realize sometimes either</p>
<p>i like to go on mma</p>
<p>tv or mix martial arts com</p>
<p>i like to go on there because it&rsquo;s a fun</p>
<p>place to talk</p>
<p>about jiu jitsu and fighting</p>
<p>and talk about</p>
<p>mma and ufc shit</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also fun to see how fucking dumb some of</p>
<p>those people are</p>
<p>one guy put</p>
<p>a big post about movies or</p>
<p>when the expendables came out</p>
<p>they were going off dudes were</p>
<p>going off talking</p>
<p>about how great the</p>
<p>expendables was</p>
<p>mixed martial arts com oh okay</p>
<p>okay they were</p>
<p>going off about how</p>
<p>great the expendables</p>
<p>were i thought this has to be ironic</p>
<p>like this has</p>
<p>to be irony like they couldn&rsquo;t have actually</p>
<p>enjoyed this</p>
<p>look i like a good fucking blow em up</p>
<p>movie more than anybody but that was one of the</p>
<p>worst movies of all time</p>
<p>and it was unbelievably bad</p>
<p>and as i&rsquo;m watching them like</p>
<p>holy fuck is this bad</p>
<p>but then i go online and you read people talking</p>
<p>about it and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a fucking amazing</p>
<p>movie i&rsquo;m going to see it</p>
<p>again this weekend with my cousin</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like are they 15 or</p>
<p>is that what it is yes</p>
<p>you gotta remember about</p>
<p>age groups like i keep on forgetting</p>
<p>about this but half</p>
<p>these people on twitter that</p>
<p>that have the bad language</p>
<p>skills and stuff like that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably 12</p>
<p>cause if i was 12 i&rsquo;d be talking</p>
<p>shit non stop all day long yeah very likely but anyway</p>
<p>what was my point</p>
<p>but the guy in the message word</p>
<p>battle la exactly and they were talking just</p>
<p>about battle la the</p>
<p>other day about how fucking awesome it was</p>
<p>five stars amazing movie</p>
<p>and then it would like</p>
<p>four or five dudes would say that i&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be like squeezing my head together and go really</p>
<p>really and then one guy would come on and go</p>
<p>you guys are all retarded that</p>
<p>movie sucked a million cocks you listen</p>
<p>yeah and i&rsquo;ll go that guy&rsquo;s faster</p>
<p>right now but that&rsquo;s also probably the guy that talks</p>
<p>about shit about your music and</p>
<p>about my comedy</p>
<p>you know the guys who are negative man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not always right</p>
<p>negative all the time</p>
<p>but when it comes to movies man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to find like a good</p>
<p>group that you agree with</p>
<p>they were the dumbest</p>
<p>aliens ever</p>
<p>once they got on the ground and they got like these</p>
<p>these tall ass</p>
<p>robot aliens like terminator</p>
<p>they were like dumb</p>
<p>like you got</p>
<p>you went across the fucking galaxy</p>
<p>and these guys are hiding behind a bus</p>
<p>twenty yards away from you</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>scene that last five minutes and they&rsquo;re behind the bus</p>
<p>and all around on these</p>
<p>aliens are fucking everybody up with</p>
<p>these soldiers have like</p>
<p>this little girl</p>
<p>and the fucking cat</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>how long is this</p>
<p>scene the aliens are</p>
<p>still trying to walk they were</p>
<p>totally retarded you</p>
<p>know what looks really bad is that new arthur remake</p>
<p>oh seen that preview of that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like the</p>
<p>exact one why</p>
<p>would you remake that in two</p>

<p>like him i like that did you like get him to the greek</p>
<p>i did like that</p>
<p>movie dude i</p>
<p>did like that</p>
<p>movie it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>movie called the man from earth</p>
<p>this is one of the dumbest</p>
<p>movies that people have been recommended to me lately</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a movie called the man from earth</p>
<p>about a guy who was a fucking caveman</p>
<p>who survived</p>
<p>until today</p>
<p>and he was jesus</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a play like they&rsquo;re over this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house he&rsquo;s leaving he has to</p>
<p>leave cause he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t age</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t want them all to get</p>
<p>suspicious so</p>
<p>every ten years he has to up and leave</p>
<p>it is so bad</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so stupid and the acting is so dumb</p>
<p>but yet all</p>
<p>these fucking people like dude you</p>
<p>gotta watch this it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>so fascinating so intriguing</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>like mike how</p>
<p>could you be intrigued by this dumbass</p>
<p>movie about a caveman who was</p>
<p>jesus who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still alive</p>

<p>know that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be okay</p>

<p>no intervention</p>

<p>those things</p>
<p>where people</p>
<p>are falling</p>
<p>apart and then people have to go and rescue them</p>
<p>people are doing</p>
<p>crack and heroin i love that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best part of celebrity rehab that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my favorite show my favorite part of celebrity rehab is</p>
<p>fucking what&rsquo;s his name eric roberts</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>yeah that guy was</p>
<p>on on celebrity</p>
<p>rehab for weed</p>
<p>yeah it was hilarious he</p>
<p>never had a problem</p>
<p>people were falling</p>
<p>apart all around him</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in the back reading it like on the side</p>
<p>reading a newspaper with his</p>
<p>glasses eating a sandwich</p>
<p>he never had a</p>
<p>story i mean he did have like a rough</p>
<p>childhood that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem with that show and he</p>
<p>cried once he cried once</p>
<p>but like a dr drew talks so much shit on weed that</p>
<p>did when eric</p>
<p>roberts came</p>
<p>to him he&rsquo;s a celebrity he needs a celebrity man</p>
<p>not very many celebrities will go on that show</p>
<p>they go we got eric</p>
<p>roberts goes what&rsquo;s it here for for weed</p>
<p>what are you</p>
<p>going to tell him</p>
<p>i mean he tells every</p>
<p>doctor who tells everybody that weed&rsquo;s bad for you</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s gotta admit him</p>
<p>when really he has no problem</p>
<p>that was the craziest part</p>
<p>he has problems he had nothing to do with the weedling</p>
<p>yeah it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>well he was</p>
<p>using weed as an escape from his life</p>
<p>and it just happened to be weed it</p>
<p>could have been cough</p>
<p>syrup no he</p>
<p>could have found some</p>
<p>other shit to escape</p>
<p>from yeah yeah i</p>
<p>guess but i</p>
<p>think it was just</p>
<p>i think it was</p>
<p>a way to blow up eric</p>
<p>roberts and he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t look bad i mean what an easy way to</p>
<p>rejuvenate the career celebrity rehab is fucking cute</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look bad at all in</p>
<p>the very first day when i analyzed them</p>
<p>he said doc</p>
<p>i smoke from a</p>
<p>vaporizer they show him</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s healthier he&rsquo;s talking about a</p>
<p>vaporizer i was healthier</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke that much at all</p>
<p>and he said</p>
<p>when i smoke</p>
<p>everybody loves me i&rsquo;m in a great mood</p>
<p>you know i flow</p>
<p>but when i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke i get</p>
<p>in a cranky mood and i&rsquo;m pissed off</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he said the problem was that dr drew</p>
<p>goes hmm we</p>
<p>gotta work on that</p>
<p>he showed him that he smoked it out of the</p>
<p>vaporizer so i think that</p>
<p>eric roberts would go this is a perfect way</p>
<p>well no for dr drewman there&rsquo;s no solution</p>
<p>other than sobriety you know</p>
<p>i retweeted something</p>
<p>i think i forget someone tweeted something</p>
<p>about pot and i retweeted it</p>
<p>going suck on that dr drew</p>
<p>you know like to him</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m thinking that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been friends with that guy for years when are we</p>
<p>gonna get him on the</p>
<p>yes he got mad</p>
<p>at me whoa i&rsquo;ve been friends with him for years</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like hey joe i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry i&rsquo;m killing your high what the hell man whoa yeah</p>
<p>you know whoa yeah you know attacking me</p>
<p>or something like that i go whoa dude i&rsquo;m just a joke</p>
<p>i thought you knew my sense of</p>
<p>humor you know i love you</p>
<p>and he writes back i love you too so it was cool</p>
<p>made it all wind up cool but he thought</p>
<p>that i was like really like fuck you dr drew suck it</p>
<p>some guys you can&rsquo;t joke around like that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like you could text me something and say suck on that</p>
<p>bitch and i</p>
<p>would be like ah</p>
<p>i would laugh if you</p>
<p>could do it too</p>
<p>with dr drew</p>
<p>apparently you can&rsquo;t text dr drew</p>
<p>and say suck on it</p>
<p>bitch you texted him or</p>
<p>emailed him</p>
<p>twitter did you think you</p>
<p>never did oh shit on twitter</p>
<p>i twittered it so then everyone saw</p>
<p>yeah but come on man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny hey so so um</p>
<p>the fuck do you</p>
<p>think he would ever</p>
<p>do the show</p>
<p>no but i&rsquo;m gonna do love line</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna do love line</p>
<p>maybe he was kidding</p>
<p>maybe he was</p>
<p>kidding mike is on</p>
<p>dancing with the stars</p>
<p>right now what exactly did he say</p>
<p>again maybe he</p>
<p>no no no he wasn&rsquo;t kidding</p>
<p>he got a little</p>
<p>upset he thought i was actually upset</p>
<p>when i was saying</p>
<p>stuck on that he was like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry i&rsquo;m killing your high with the helmet</p>
<p>it seemed like</p>
<p>he was hurt like his feelings were hurt like i</p>
<p>attacked him okay this is the only</p>
<p>discussion that</p>
<p>he and i have ever disagreed on</p>
<p>i think that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely right</p>
<p>about how much</p>
<p>abuse goes on and</p>
<p>he can nail it when he&rsquo;s talking to people</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with them</p>
<p>what i think is</p>
<p>he discounts</p>
<p>that there are</p>
<p>very healthy people that can benefit from marijuana</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>people that aren&rsquo;t sick</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>addiction problems that don&rsquo;t have substance problems</p>
<p>they can benefit</p>
<p>greatly for marijuana</p>
<p>and the problem is he&rsquo;s dealing with a completely</p>
<p>tainted pool</p>
<p>everyone that he&rsquo;s dealing with is fucked up</p>
<p>he has very</p>
<p>few people that he&rsquo;s dealing with that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an addiction specialist</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s by the time they get to him</p>
<p>their life is</p>
<p>in the goddamn toilet they&rsquo;re fucking falling apart</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>sitting down with people that can say hey dr drew</p>
<p>listen man marijuana has made me a</p>
<p>better person i&rsquo;m a different person because of it okay</p>
<p>so what do you</p>
<p>think it is he&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>you could be a</p>
<p>different person anyway it&rsquo;s either one of two</p>
<p>things either</p>
<p>he actually</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that weed is good for you</p>
<p>or he knows but</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a doctor he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to hurt his</p>
<p>reputation no</p>
<p>look he&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s better for you than alcohol for sure i mean</p>
<p>but does he know the</p>
<p>truth medically he&rsquo;s very honest</p>
<p>about it he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know he believes that it&rsquo;s bad for you and</p>
<p>he believes that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s addictive whether it&rsquo;s physically</p>
<p>addictive or</p>
<p>psychological</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really no</p>
<p>you know when people say there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>marijuana is not addictive</p>
<p>everything you</p>
<p>fucking do can be addictive if your mind is broken</p>
<p>if your mind gets wacky</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen people</p>
<p>you know anybody that&rsquo;s a gambling addict</p>
<p>you ever met people like that</p>
<p>i know a few people personally yeah it&rsquo;s a nutty</p>
<p>thing right they can&rsquo;t help it man</p>
<p>whatever it is you can call it</p>
<p>psychological</p>
<p>addiction whatever it is they are connected to gambling</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t stop gambling they do it all the time i know</p>
<p>a bunch of people from the pool world</p>
<p>my days of playing pool</p>
<p>i met so many people that were gambling</p>
<p>addicts that&rsquo;s an addict addiction to man</p>
<p>marijuana can be addictive absolutely</p>
<p>anything can be addictive if your mind is broken</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that people like us whose</p>
<p>brains aren&rsquo;t broken shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to use it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where it gets</p>
<p>annoying and</p>
<p>when anything</p>
<p>to benefit you and</p>
<p>when you tell</p>
<p>him that it does</p>
<p>there should be some sort of a test</p>
<p>and we tell him that it does</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing that ever annoys me</p>
<p>about dr drew is that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not willing to sort of take that into consideration</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>rigid on his</p>
<p>stance when it comes to</p>
<p>psychedelic drugs</p>
<p>into it that&rsquo;s the only part that i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stand is he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>truth about marijuana</p>
<p>i thought maybe he does know</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s just trying to save his job and he can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about it because technically it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still illegal so i can&rsquo;t promote it</p>
<p>i thought it was that like he did know the</p>
<p>truth but either way that</p>
<p>would still be</p>
<p>something that i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>happy with i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>do the research</p>
<p>get on the internet</p>
<p>dr drew you&rsquo;re a doctor come on look into it it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll actually benefit from it you yourself</p>
<p>you will benefit</p>
<p>from it most certainly if dr drew</p>
<p>started smoking weed</p>
<p>every now and then</p>
<p>your life would change in a better way dr drew</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even know it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a doctor and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on tv man i love you i&rsquo;ve been listening to you</p>
<p>from love line from back when i</p>
<p>in 1989 back in the day</p>
<p>i love dr dre i love 90</p>
<p>of what you say</p>
<p>but the 10 about the</p>
<p>you not knowing the truth</p>
<p>about marijuana that burns me</p>
<p>inside well tom mccormick</p>
<p>schooled him on love line years ago when he was talking</p>
<p>about it you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s definitely not</p>
<p>not objective when it comes to that</p>
<p>but hey you know whatever</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s him that&rsquo;s what you know it&rsquo;s the path he&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unfortunate</p>
<p>i think you</p>
<p>would i think all people can</p>
<p>learn from psychedelic</p>
<p>experiences if you&rsquo;re not fucked up</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>something wrong with you</p>
<p>medically there&rsquo;s not something</p>
<p>wrong with you psychologically</p>
<p>where you really can&rsquo;t go on trips</p>
<p>you know even just trips of eating weed that shit</p>
<p>benefits you</p>
<p>greatly in brazil where</p>
<p>ayahuasca is legal</p>
<p>the people that are part of the</p>
<p>ayahuasca churches and they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>normal loving people</p>
<p>they give ayahuasca to</p>
<p>their kids when they turn 14</p>
<p>to make sure they don&rsquo;t become alcoholics</p>
<p>as iwaska at that</p>
<p>age right when they&rsquo;re hitting puberty</p>
<p>it sets their</p>
<p>brains straight somehow</p>
<p>and iwaska if you know what it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the key</p>
<p>to the other side to the</p>
<p>spirit world it really is</p>
<p>and when you see the</p>
<p>spirit world at 14 somehow</p>
<p>it keeps them</p>
<p>from being alcoholics they do that in brazil</p>
<p>it straightens you out man</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>experiences like the dmt</p>
<p>experience which</p>
<p>if people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>ayahuasca is the dmt experience</p>
<p>ayahuasca is</p>
<p>an orally active version of dmt and the reason</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s orally active as opposed</p>
<p>to the regular version is that dmt when you eat it</p>
<p>is broken down</p>
<p>your stomach by something called monoamine oxidase</p>
<p>and monoamine oxidase</p>
<p>is produced by your stomach and it kills it so</p>
<p>when you eat it nothing happens</p>
<p>so what these people have figured out how to do and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s hundreds of thousands of different</p>
<p>plants in the amazon</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve figured out how to take</p>
<p>the root of one tree</p>
<p>and the leaves of another</p>
<p>and they combine them and one of them has dmt and the</p>
<p>other one has a natural</p>
<p>m a o monoamine</p>
<p>oxidase inhibitor</p>
<p>so it inhibits your stomach&rsquo;s</p>
<p>production of monoamine</p>
<p>oxidase and it</p>
<p>allows the dmt to get into your</p>
<p>bloodstream orally</p>
<p>or and it takes a long time it takes like five or six</p>
<p>hours for the full trip</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like a ride through to the</p>
<p>other side it&rsquo;s like it allows you</p>
<p>during that</p>
<p>brief amount of time</p>
<p>to tune into the</p>
<p>spirit world</p>
<p>which is all around us all the time</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a huge part of</p>
<p>their culture and it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>something that has</p>
<p>been passed on from</p>
<p>generation to generation</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>incredible discovery because they figured out at all</p>
<p>those plants</p>
<p>they figured out how</p>
<p>to take this a little bit of this a little bit of that</p>
<p>mix it together boil it</p>
<p>strain it out drink it</p>
<p>throw up it</p>
<p>tastes like dog shit</p>
<p>tastes terrible it&rsquo;s a long ass process to make this</p>
<p>but they figured out how to do this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really amazing discovery</p>
<p>cause they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>figure out anything else they have dirt</p>
<p>floors and shit they don&rsquo;t even have shoes</p>
<p>yet they&rsquo;re out there</p>
<p>making ayahuasca</p>
<p>connecting to the</p>
<p>spirit world on a regular basis</p>
<p>and you know and you</p>
<p>think you say</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;re advanced</p>
<p>you know those</p>
<p>are those poor people they&rsquo;re not advanced</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re way more advanced</p>
<p>yeah yeah they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>supermarkets but</p>
<p>guess what they live in a</p>
<p>place where food is</p>
<p>everywhere okay</p>
<p>and they go to the</p>
<p>spirit world all the time</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>completely connected to the afterlife</p>
<p>if anybody realizes</p>
<p>this is all just a bullshit good time and just try to</p>
<p>enjoy it as much as you can they do</p>
<p>those fucking people are</p>
<p>knocking on the door</p>
<p>every day they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going back and forth all the time</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not lost in the jungle they&rsquo;re completely</p>
<p>aware of western</p>
<p>civilization and</p>
<p>technology they know all about it</p>
<p>once you go to the</p>
<p>other side apparently</p>
<p>you realize all that matters is being harmonious with</p>
<p>mother nature and</p>
<p>once you see the spirit</p>
<p>world and you see it so clearly</p>
<p>like all the materialistic</p>
<p>stuff in the world</p>
<p>apparently seems to</p>
<p>not be so important anymore your</p>
<p>priorities change up and</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>ayahuasca i did the real</p>
<p>i smoke dmt with</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the 10</p>
<p>minute version of an</p>
<p>eight hour trip</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>much it&rsquo;s very very difficult to get the full</p>
<p>dmt experience when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking ayahuasca it&rsquo;s a long</p>
<p>experience but it&rsquo;s not a slow</p>
<p>mckenna always described it as</p>
<p>like you know iq you compress a file</p>
<p>and then you download it and then you</p>
<p>uncompress it on your hard</p>
<p>drive and it becomes fucking huge</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s what dmt&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re downloading something that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna explode in your brain</p>
<p>yeah and and you</p>
<p>know and and</p>
<p>unhinge and</p>
<p>give you the full</p>
<p>effect in 10 15 minutes as opposed to the</p>
<p>ayahuasca trip it</p>
<p>changed my life</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t want to get into change</p>
<p>mine too and we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about it a bunch of times</p>
<p>i have done it a</p>
<p>bunch times to me it confirmed you know</p>
<p>i grew up very religious</p>
<p>and then at 10 when i</p>
<p>found out that</p>
<p>everybody wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>catholic i thought everybody was catholic everybody</p>
<p>in my neighborhood was catholic we had a couple</p>
<p>protestants</p>
<p>in the school</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know what that was i was a little confused</p>
<p>and then we</p>
<p>had a couple jehovah&rsquo;s witness and i was like hmm</p>
<p>but mostly everybody was catholic</p>
<p>all the sitcoms that the kids</p>
<p>watched back then</p>
<p>coincided with catholic</p>
<p>holidays so we see christmas specials and we see easter</p>
<p>so i just thought everybody was catholic</p>
<p>you know i was</p>
<p>an alter boy i&rsquo;m like i can&rsquo;t wait to get to heaven</p>
<p>cause my life sucks</p>
<p>once i found out that</p>
<p>there was jews out there and i</p>
<p>found i&rsquo;m like what&rsquo;s a jew is that a person</p>
<p>oh no it&rsquo;s a religion and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other religions then</p>
<p>i became atheist once i</p>
<p>found out there</p>
<p>was a thousand religions and i went oh it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>muskly all be bullshit</p>
<p>so then i became</p>
<p>super atheistic</p>
<p>started writing songs about</p>
<p>satan i didn&rsquo;t believe in</p>
<p>satan but i&rsquo;m like i don&rsquo;t believe in anything and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna scare all</p>
<p>these christians and i&rsquo;mma</p>
<p>write about</p>
<p>satan killing priests and</p>
<p>stuff didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t atheist</p>
<p>i mean i was didn&rsquo;t believe in god at all</p>
<p>and then when i was</p>
<p>21 i had an</p>
<p>experience that made me</p>
<p>realize that there</p>
<p>might be some</p>
<p>stuff out there</p>
<p>should i tell the</p>
<p>psychic story</p>
<p>oh tell whatever you want man</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>story i went from atheism to</p>
<p>being an agnostic at 21</p>
<p>i just moved to hollywood to be a rock star</p>
<p>walking up sunset boulevard passing</p>
<p>the roxy and my</p>
<p>buddy john was like 10 15 yards</p>
<p>ahead of me</p>
<p>and in front of the roxy there&rsquo;s his hippie plan</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s playing guitar and he has this sign</p>
<p>about the amazon</p>
<p>rainforest getting</p>
<p>chopped down and all this</p>
<p>stuff and he&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>dirty hippie to me</p>
<p>and i passed by</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s all tree hugging</p>
<p>and i looked at him</p>
<p>and in my mind i&rsquo;m like you know</p>
<p>take a shower but i didn&rsquo;t actually say that</p>
<p>and as if he read my mind he stopped</p>
<p>playing walked up to me looked me in the face and said</p>
<p>if i guess your birthday</p>
<p>will you listen to me</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like yeah</p>
<p>right and he looked at me in the eye and said</p>
<p>he said may</p>
<p>may 15th i&rsquo;m like holy shit</p>
<p>i said john john come here i waved my friend over and i</p>
<p>as if that wasn&rsquo;t enough</p>
<p>he had to do it</p>
<p>again for the confirmation</p>
<p>i said guess his birthday</p>
<p>and john didn&rsquo;t know what that was going on</p>
<p>he looked at john and said march</p>
<p>31st mate mate mate mate it&rsquo;s the probabilities yeah</p>
<p>if you look at probability probability theater</p>
<p>probability theory</p>
<p>remember that conversation</p>
<p>we had a conversation</p>
<p>with a friend of mine yeah at that</p>
<p>point he was telling a</p>
<p>story and the</p>
<p>guy goes mate it&rsquo;s probabilities probability theory</p>
<p>if you follow probability theory</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>to do that you can figure out someone&rsquo;s birthday</p>
<p>what the fuck are you talking</p>
<p>about man you can&rsquo;t just guess</p>
<p>one day and then another guy comes over you</p>
<p>guessed that day too</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not probability theory</p>
<p>probability theory says it&rsquo;s very unlikely that you</p>
<p>would be able to do that yeah so</p>
<p>he started talking</p>
<p>about the rainforest we just</p>
<p>stood there with our jaws</p>
<p>dropped i didn&rsquo;t listen to anything he said</p>
<p>all i kept thinking</p>
<p>about is how the hell did he do that</p>
<p>i was amazing</p>
<p>so i came to a conclusion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to be one of two</p>
<p>things either</p>
<p>he could somehow</p>
<p>read thoughts and if you</p>
<p>think something</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that</p>
<p>could see the thoughts</p>
<p>somehow it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>weird other</p>
<p>sense or there was some</p>
<p>voice whether it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>angel or a demon or a spirit</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>or the akashic records</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something telling him</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>so to me i became agnostic</p>
<p>which met i&rsquo;m like okay</p>
<p>maybe i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on and</p>
<p>how old were you when this happened i was 21</p>
<p>so what do you</p>
<p>think happened you</p>
<p>think that dude was doing ayahuasca</p>
<p>and he just tripped all the time and had some sort of</p>
<p>a constant connection to the</p>
<p>spirit world</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s running around</p>
<p>being selfless</p>
<p>only trying to help people and looking like a bum</p>
<p>because if he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dedicating his life to saving the rainforest</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got like</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s super</p>
<p>over active when it comes to</p>
<p>like loving the planet like he loves the planet so much</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s dedicating his</p>
<p>whole life he&rsquo;s not taking showers</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>sunset playing guitar</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s dedicating his</p>
<p>whole life that guy</p>
<p>that guy nobody loves the planet more than that dude</p>
<p>you know i was listening to a mckenna</p>
<p>podcast i forget</p>
<p>psychedelic cafe i</p>
<p>think is the name</p>
<p>of the podcast and it had a terrence mckenna speech</p>
<p>where he was talking</p>
<p>about everybody so concerned</p>
<p>about the rainforest and everyone so concerned</p>
<p>about the environment</p>
<p>and pollution and toxifications of the ocean</p>
<p>but if just one</p>
<p>just one of</p>
<p>these things that has hit the</p>
<p>earth so many times in the past</p>
<p>came here from outer space</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about anything anymore there&rsquo;d be nothing left</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about the meteor that hit the yucatan</p>
<p>and how that within the first</p>
<p>second and a half it was five miles deep</p>
<p>into the earth fuck</p>
<p>the first second and a half it was five miles deep</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s fuck the ozone layer fuck the</p>
<p>rainforest fuck everything it&rsquo;s all done</p>
<p>and those goddamn</p>
<p>every planet is littered</p>
<p>with these giant craters</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all over jupiter</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen them hit in our lifetime</p>
<p>there was an</p>
<p>amateur astronomer very recently in australia</p>
<p>that caught a big impact in jupiter we&rsquo;ve seen it in</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen them hit jupiter before with</p>
<p>there was one big one i believe in 94</p>
<p>you know shoemaker</p>
<p>levy i think it was a big comment that slammed in</p>
<p>i mean look it&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>scary ass fucking shit</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so many of them out there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many of them</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that incident didn&rsquo;t make me become a tree hugger</p>
<p>but it did make me</p>
<p>it did put me on a quest</p>
<p>to find out</p>
<p>like i just instantly became fascinated</p>
<p>at how we did</p>
<p>that what do you</p>
<p>think i mean you had to be you had to</p>
<p>think about that guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i said it was either to me it was either</p>
<p>he could read thought</p>
<p>either what whatever did you ask her</p>
<p>no i didn&rsquo;t ask whoa</p>
<p>either either he</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t you ask him</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t maybe i did and he said don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about it you know</p>
<p>well what a cock</p>
<p>sucker i just know</p>
<p>hold him back on the ability to read</p>
<p>mind i just know i</p>
<p>heard a voice</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>so to me to me he did it</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t matter how he did it i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>let him talk anymore but come on bitch</p>
<p>yeah spread that shit around</p>
<p>i wanna know numbers</p>
<p>i just knew that</p>
<p>there had to be</p>
<p>something that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand there</p>
<p>has to be like another dimension or something</p>
<p>so i became</p>
<p>obsessed with finding out</p>
<p>what life really</p>
<p>is you know i&rsquo;m just always been on that</p>
<p>quest that&rsquo;s how i became a conspiracy theorist</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you know i&rsquo;m you know</p>
<p>fascinated with ancient</p>
<p>cultures and what they did</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m oh i have</p>
<p>stacks and stacks of dvds just like you</p>
<p>stacks of dvds of conspiracy theories and you know</p>
<p>um documentaries on ancient</p>
<p>cultures and</p>
<p>you know the government</p>
<p>and how the government works and all this stuff</p>
<p>that set me on the course</p>
<p>right there to find out</p>
<p>uh what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>going on is there an</p>
<p>afterlife i mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important it became important to me to find out</p>
<p>if there is</p>
<p>if is there some kind of</p>
<p>higher power</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>that set it off</p>
<p>so i became agnostic and through dmt</p>
<p>and all the the</p>
<p>things that i&rsquo;ve been through</p>
<p>to me i feel i&rsquo;m pretty certain there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>afterlife that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t just die and just we&rsquo;re just done</p>
<p>i believe that</p>
<p>there is the akashic records and</p>
<p>the ancient indians believed</p>
<p>from india they believe</p>
<p>they dubbed it the akashic records</p>
<p>in the after</p>
<p>world there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>river of infinite information that</p>
<p>you can have access to the answers to</p>
<p>everything and</p>
<p>through meditation and just</p>
<p>through controlling your own frequency</p>
<p>people have done it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been done</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>the most famous</p>
<p>on in the west was</p>
<p>edgar casey</p>
<p>he had the knowledge to tap into this information</p>
<p>and no one can figure it out</p>
<p>he has like thirteen or fourteen thousand documented</p>
<p>readings he got huge the president came to him</p>
<p>he was you know</p>
<p>he was a guy with a</p>
<p>third grade education</p>
<p>but when he went</p>
<p>under in his</p>
<p>medium state</p>
<p>he had the answers to everything</p>
<p>he was like this</p>
<p>like this this man</p>
<p>in a in a different voice</p>
<p>and would just have the answers to</p>
<p>everything it was yeah what was it</p>
<p>if anybody debunked</p>
<p>edgar casey or</p>
<p>read any of that shit you can&rsquo;t debunk him really he</p>
<p>smashes just look into him he smashes</p>
<p>he knew in 1920</p>
<p>he knew like the function</p>
<p>of every gland</p>
<p>and no one knew if he was bullshitting</p>
<p>cause they didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>back then we&rsquo;re finding the shit he&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re finding out</p>
<p>the shit now</p>
<p>if he was right</p>
<p>he would rattle off</p>
<p>the pituitary</p>
<p>gland and give you</p>
<p>what vitamins you need to take</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s its function</p>
<p>going through all the glands and people thought he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy but he had documented</p>
<p>mds are going back and studying</p>
<p>his readings</p>
<p>and going holy shit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s you can&rsquo;t debunk him he had the</p>
<p>power he had the</p>
<p>power to reach</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not the only one there&rsquo;s a lot of people that</p>
<p>could do you</p>
<p>know meditation helps</p>
<p>you yourself have even said through</p>
<p>meditating in your tank</p>
<p>that you feel like you have access to information</p>
<p>well i definitely feel like</p>
<p>the closer you get to being</p>
<p>at peace and in the</p>
<p>right frequency</p>
<p>and then you can</p>
<p>direct your</p>
<p>frequency i really do believe that</p>
<p>i believe that with</p>
<p>the tank and with</p>
<p>especially if i go into the tank</p>
<p>under the influence of the sacred plant</p>
<p>and i get into that groove of</p>
<p>completely totally letting go</p>
<p>and trying to abandon</p>
<p>all that is</p>
<p>about me and just try to be</p>
<p>empty and just tune into it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a place that</p>
<p>i get to it&rsquo;s almost like i go on this little journey</p>
<p>and i gotta keep it together</p>
<p>while i&rsquo;m going on this journey because</p>
<p>sometimes when i&rsquo;m on it it</p>
<p>could get a little</p>
<p>weird i start</p>
<p>thinking about myself or</p>
<p>about my life or</p>
<p>about anything else</p>
<p>and then it interrupts my progress</p>
<p>but if i can tune in</p>
<p>and stay in long enough it&rsquo;s like i go through a tunnel</p>
<p>and then when i get through the</p>
<p>tunnel if i can keep it together</p>
<p>i get through the</p>
<p>tunnel and then i</p>
<p>break on through to the</p>
<p>other side and when i</p>
<p>break on through to the</p>
<p>other side it</p>
<p>literally is like i get to another place</p>
<p>and so i go through this tunnel</p>
<p>this tunnel</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>tuning my mind into the perfect</p>
<p>frequency and whether</p>
<p>or not i&rsquo;m willing to let go of all of my control</p>
<p>all my control of my</p>
<p>thinking and if i can</p>
<p>if i can it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally like a</p>
<p>magical event man where</p>
<p>i pop through this</p>
<p>tunnel on the</p>
<p>other side and there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>beautiful incredible</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>world over there</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>world of patterns and communication</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a mushroom trip it&rsquo;s like a dmt trip</p>
<p>yeah so either</p>
<p>a that&rsquo;s imaginary</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all just in your head it&rsquo;s a trip or b</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually some place</p>
<p>well you know the</p>
<p>real one i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there is anything that&rsquo;s imaginary this is my</p>
<p>thinking about the imagination</p>
<p>this is what i think man</p>
<p>your imagination you&rsquo;re a very creative person now</p>
<p>think of all the different</p>
<p>things that you&rsquo;ve thought of whether</p>
<p>you were writing</p>
<p>shit for the man show or whether you&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>jiu jitsu moves</p>
<p>whatever it is you think it</p>
<p>and then it manifests itself in a real form as a real</p>
<p>thing a solid</p>
<p>object it was at one</p>
<p>point in time just a thought like</p>
<p>the ability to put something in a can somebody had to</p>
<p>think this up how to make a fucking can and then</p>
<p>figure out how many coconuts</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to squash</p>
<p>to get all this</p>
<p>coconut juice into this can there&rsquo;s a lot of work</p>
<p>involved in that but you someone has to create it and</p>
<p>think it and</p>
<p>so the imagination</p>
<p>allows you to</p>
<p>think of these</p>
<p>ideas and then they manifest themselves in a real form</p>
<p>so the real question is</p>
<p>what the fuck is the imagination</p>
<p>what is when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking things up</p>
<p>and someone comes up with the idea of nuclear</p>
<p>power i mean</p>
<p>granted there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of steps</p>
<p>along the way a</p>
<p>bunch of other discoveries have to be made a</p>
<p>bunch of things have to be</p>
<p>pieced together to get to a</p>
<p>point where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you know making a nuclear</p>
<p>power plan or</p>
<p>an airplane or fucking anything really complicated but</p>
<p>the bottom line is all of it has come out of nothing</p>
<p>all of it every idea ever</p>
<p>has come out of the air</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the imagination</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>what is it so you&rsquo;re saying be it&rsquo;s someplace</p>
<p>and if you look at the ancient indians and</p>
<p>is there an akashic records</p>
<p>is there proof</p>
<p>yes there&rsquo;s lots of</p>
<p>proof but the undeniable</p>
<p>proof you look at</p>
<p>edgar casey he</p>
<p>proves that</p>
<p>you can somehow</p>
<p>under hypnosis</p>
<p>or in a trance</p>
<p>or in meditation</p>
<p>you can tap into this infinite knowledge</p>
<p>these answers that came from somewhere else</p>
<p>so if there is this infinite</p>
<p>river of knowledge or</p>
<p>what the hell is it who created it</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it for is there</p>
<p>is there consciousness behind it</p>
<p>did something create it is there</p>
<p>do we when we</p>
<p>exist in the spirit world are we like this</p>
<p>super infinite</p>
<p>i mean cause if you listen to the mystics and</p>
<p>ancient cultures</p>
<p>the mediums</p>
<p>if you look at all the things they all agree on</p>
<p>they all say</p>
<p>and even terrence mckenna has said this</p>
<p>that in the afterlife</p>
<p>in the other dimension</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no time there&rsquo;s no past there&rsquo;s no present</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just now</p>
<p>everything happens at the same time</p>
<p>no human can actually</p>
<p>understand that or</p>
<p>understand what that feels they can&rsquo;t wrap their</p>
<p>brain around it</p>
<p>i can say it but i don&rsquo;t really know what it feels like</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what they all say there is no time</p>
<p>and this dimension that we&rsquo;re living in</p>
<p>is an illusion of time</p>
<p>we see time moves in a</p>
<p>linear fashion so</p>
<p>we perceive it as time and like</p>
<p>what does that really mean</p>
<p>this is an illusion</p>
<p>really like what could it mean</p>
<p>and if there is this</p>
<p>river of infinite knowledge god damn it</p>
<p>whatever created that for sure is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some intelligent design going on</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m coming that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>conclusion i&rsquo;m coming to</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just some natural</p>
<p>phenomenon where there&rsquo;s infinite knowledge and</p>
<p>certain people</p>
<p>under meditation could tap into it</p>
<p>that sounds like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some awesome shit that created that</p>
<p>for multiple dimensions</p>
<p>right if it exists</p>
<p>and then you backtrack that it exists</p>
<p>yes there&rsquo;s lots of</p>
<p>proof that it is there</p>
<p>people are taking information the guy who</p>
<p>guessed my birthday and my friend&rsquo;s birthday</p>
<p>he tapped into this</p>
<p>infinite river of knowledge</p>
<p>that ancient</p>
<p>cultures all talk about</p>
<p>do you believe</p>
<p>us do you believe in god</p>
<p>man of course there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good but you can call it not like the bearded man a</p>
<p>lot no creator</p>
<p>like there is a higher power</p>
<p>there is intelligent design</p>
<p>there is this is</p>
<p>if this is of what we know is it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s embarrassing for this universe</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re the smartest</p>
<p>nobody knows shit on this yeah</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not embarrassing because at one</p>
<p>point in time it had to be</p>
<p>lower than us if</p>
<p>the big bang actually created the universe</p>
<p>at one point in time like a day old</p>
<p>was the universe like god you</p>
<p>should be embarrassed with yourself this is it</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even have worms yet you fucking</p>
<p>loser well the</p>
<p>whole universe</p>
<p>if everything evolves</p>
<p>i mean at one</p>
<p>point in time it has to be in a low form</p>
<p>what we are in this</p>
<p>if this is a universe if this is a dimension and</p>
<p>whatever you want to</p>
<p>classify this</p>
<p>space that we dwell in</p>
<p>know whether</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s one part of the</p>
<p>great beyond</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all attached together whatever the fuck it is</p>
<p>this part is at this</p>
<p>stage this is</p>
<p>where it is</p>
<p>as embarrassing as what we are right now</p>
<p>this may very well be as far as it gets maybe</p>
<p>i mean if we</p>
<p>think that there are aliens</p>
<p>and we think that</p>
<p>aliens at one</p>
<p>point in time used to be</p>
<p>like us and then they</p>
<p>evolved and became much better than us</p>
<p>that means they had to be like us at one</p>
<p>point for sure somebody</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>top of the line the</p>
<p>front of the line</p>
<p>had to be like us at one point</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no argument for evolution</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s us</p>
<p>it might be us i believe in</p>
<p>evolution and</p>
<p>higher power and intelligent design at</p>
<p>the same time how trippy</p>
<p>would that be though</p>
<p>we really were</p>
<p>the top of the</p>
<p>line as far as intelligence goes as far as the universe</p>
<p>what if we really are the only one</p>
<p>that would be a trip man that</p>
<p>would be ridiculous it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be incredible</p>
<p>it would i mean</p>
<p>sounds it sounds</p>
<p>ridiculous i mean the</p>
<p>odds that we</p>
<p>oh we&rsquo;re number one we&rsquo;re lucky</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing it had to happen somewhere once right</p>
<p>if it happens here</p>
<p>right if we are the ones</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve gotten to this point</p>
<p>then just because it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying this</p>
<p>right but because it&rsquo;s happening here</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s happening somewhere else</p>
<p>it might literally only be happening here</p>
<p>i believe in evolution</p>
<p>absolutely i mean there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>proof of it</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>like these inconsistencies</p>
<p>with it too and like the missing link</p>
<p>and the chromosome i</p>
<p>think a lot of that is just a lack of</p>
<p>understanding on</p>
<p>honestly i believe in both i believe that there is if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an akashic records if there&rsquo;s an infinite</p>
<p>river of knowledge</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely in my eyes the</p>
<p>the conclusion</p>
<p>would be that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a higher power with</p>
<p>higher intelligence</p>
<p>than what we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>someone else we&rsquo;re not creating that shit</p>
<p>somebody created that we can&rsquo;t fucking make an infinite</p>
<p>river knowledge</p>
<p>where we could just grab it like a</p>
<p>supercomputer</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still on laptops</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying that that</p>
<p>proves that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>way beyond us</p>
<p>way beyond us it</p>
<p>might not be that simple it</p>
<p>might be something like we&rsquo;re moving towards</p>
<p>becoming that</p>
<p>it might be that</p>
<p>it might be that there is no god and</p>
<p>there is no one who&rsquo;s at the</p>
<p>wheel of this whole</p>
<p>thing but that the whole</p>
<p>thing is moving in a direction the way</p>
<p>to move in the correct direction is to move towards god</p>
<p>is to move towards love is</p>
<p>to move towards friendship and happiness and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>when you crack through to the next</p>
<p>stage when you</p>
<p>have that dmt trip and you go over there it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re trying to do is to get there</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re trying to do is to tune in to how they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tuned in you</p>
<p>know and then it&rsquo;s not even that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing behind it but you are it you are that</p>
<p>thing we all</p>
<p>are that thing</p>
<p>water molecules in the ocean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>the conclusions and theories based on</p>
<p>all the shit that i&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>it seems like the</p>
<p>afterworld is like an</p>
<p>ocean it is like god is one god is</p>
<p>ocean but we&rsquo;re all part of it we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>like a water molecule we&rsquo;re all affected it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>ultimate mind fuck it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>ultimate mind fuck to</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>and your own biology is sort of betraying you</p>
<p>into thinking that you&rsquo;re an individual</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re not a part of some gigantic fucking</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s all happening</p>
<p>but one of the</p>
<p>things that you&rsquo;ve realized</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve realized over the course of our friendship</p>
<p>i mean eddie&rsquo;s been my best friend since</p>
<p>i think 2000 we</p>
<p>started hanging out in 2000 and</p>
<p>it comes back to the</p>
<p>story of the</p>
<p>twister because</p>
<p>we became good friends</p>
<p>i was getting</p>
<p>private lessons when i</p>
<p>first started doing</p>
<p>jiu jitsu i was a</p>
<p>blue belt under</p>
<p>this dude i won&rsquo;t say his name he&rsquo;s a very nice guy</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m gonna say something negative and</p>
<p>because i was getting</p>
<p>private lessons from him all</p>
<p>the time he was the only guy that i was rolling with</p>
<p>and i wasn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>learning nearly as much as i thought i thought</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re kickboxing and</p>
<p>you say if you get a chance to work out with rob cayman</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way better to work out with</p>
<p>rob cayman one on one than it is to go to a private</p>
<p>class like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna correct all your technique</p>
<p>so i thought that</p>
<p>would be the case with</p>
<p>jiu jitsu like i</p>
<p>would get real good</p>
<p>going to class</p>
<p>anything like that</p>
<p>eddie was the</p>
<p>first person to tell me and</p>
<p>eddie came to</p>
<p>one of the private lessons that i was</p>
<p>having with silvio and we rolled around a little bit</p>
<p>and right away he got me in a twister</p>
<p>and i had no idea what the fuck he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>all of a sudden he hooks my</p>
<p>knee with his left leg and his left foot goes under his</p>
<p>right knee and he</p>
<p>rolls forward</p>
<p>under his left</p>
<p>shoulder and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>spinning around like a top</p>
<p>the next thing you know he&rsquo;s got my arm</p>
<p>wrapped around his neck</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s fucking pulling on my</p>
<p>neck like this i was like what the fuck did you just do</p>
<p>like i had been</p>
<p>doing jiu jitsu for two years</p>
<p>and i had no idea what the fuck you just did to me</p>
<p>and i was like god damn and you&rsquo;re like i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>teach you all this shit i was like dude</p>
<p>teach me this shit</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how we became friends and that&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>how i started smoking pot</p>
<p>you know i was on the mark marin</p>
<p>podcast the other day</p>
<p>and this came up</p>
<p>you know i thought that marijuana</p>
<p>and all that</p>
<p>stuff was for</p>
<p>losers i thought that it just made you a loser</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna become unmotivated you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get anything done you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be a dummy you just sit and watch tv</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what i wanted man i wanted to make sure</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like our friend bud</p>
<p>we have a good friend bud who&rsquo;s like super</p>
<p>fucking go get her</p>
<p>you know bud is a</p>
<p>great guy he&rsquo;s the one who put together the tv show to</p>
<p>build that car the parakuta</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also the one who did</p>
<p>my garage like an</p>
<p>mma garage he&rsquo;s always got a</p>
<p>bunch of different tv shows going on</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a fucking go getter</p>
<p>and you and i are always like dude</p>
<p>please just let us get you high</p>
<p>how many times</p>
<p>more than anybody more than dr drew</p>
<p>more than anybody how many</p>
<p>times have we been having this conversation with him</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s always like</p>
<p>after i make my</p>
<p>first million</p>
<p>then he makes his</p>
<p>first million like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still i&rsquo;m like i</p>
<p>wanna slow down now</p>
<p>like he just does not</p>
<p>wanna slow down</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like it ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>about slowing down man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about i&rsquo;m not slowing down i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t slowed down at all</p>
<p>i work more now than i ever did before same here man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a busy motherfucker that&rsquo;s not an</p>
<p>annoying goddamn stereotype that potheads are lazy</p>
<p>we get a lot of shit done dude</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing two</p>
<p>podcasts a week i&rsquo;m writing a book i&rsquo;m writing my</p>
<p>stand up comedy i&rsquo;m performing</p>
<p>stand up comedy</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>stand up i&rsquo;m doing the commentary for the number one</p>
<p>mixed martial</p>
<p>arts organization in the fucking</p>
<p>world and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>training jiu</p>
<p>jitsu and i&rsquo;m doing kettlebells</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m raising kids</p>
<p>and i play pool</p>
<p>every night</p>
<p>and i gotta surf the internet and i</p>
<p>gotta beat off there&rsquo;s a lot of shit</p>
<p>going on man there&rsquo;s a lot of goddamn time</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not lazy at all i squeeze it all out every day</p>
<p>so when people say that potheads</p>
<p>you know that it makes you lazy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>stereotype man and that was a stereotype that i thought</p>
<p>before i met you man</p>
<p>i do sleep till</p>
<p>about 10 45</p>
<p>every day so</p>
<p>what what time you go to bed</p>
<p>what time you go to bed two or</p>
<p>three yeah that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>eight hours that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re supposed to get man</p>
<p>most of these people are in bed at 10 o&rsquo;clock at night</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why when they get up at six o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>in the morning they&rsquo;re all impressed with themselves</p>
<p>yeah bitch i</p>
<p>slept till 1 30 in the afternoon</p>
<p>but where were you at 5 am i was writing the</p>
<p>greatest bit i&rsquo;ve ever written in my life</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>write my best shit</p>
<p>i was in the fucking isolation tank</p>
<p>traveling through the universe all right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i was doing</p>
<p>while you were</p>
<p>sleeping so don&rsquo;t give me a hard time because</p>
<p>my time is different</p>
<p>than your time like somehow another</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re fucking doing yoga at 5 a</p>
<p>m so you&rsquo;re the king fuck you</p>
<p>stupid and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>based on farmers anyway</p>
<p>it is based on you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s based on</p>
<p>you have to fucking get up</p>
<p>early that&rsquo;s nonsense</p>
<p>asleep the crazy</p>
<p>thing is a joe and i before we start</p>
<p>smoking weed</p>
<p>we were totally</p>
<p>against it we were bag on</p>
<p>stoners and we thought it made you stupid</p>
<p>i would talk so much shit on</p>
<p>stoners that at 28</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when i</p>
<p>found out the truth</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when i reap the benefits of marijuana</p>
<p>and then when i met joe he was so funny</p>
<p>i thought this guy&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>smoke pot he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny like i&rsquo;d go see him</p>
<p>you know do</p>
<p>stand up at the comedy</p>
<p>store and i&rsquo;m like that&rsquo;s that dude</p>
<p>who trains at</p>
<p>john jacques machado&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he trains at my</p>
<p>school hey what&rsquo;s up dude i</p>
<p>train at your school</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>watch him do comedy i thought he was great he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta smoke yeah</p>
<p>eddie and i had a</p>
<p>bunch of fortuitous meetings just</p>
<p>out of the blue</p>
<p>before we became friends at one time</p>
<p>eddie&rsquo;s eyes aren&rsquo;t so good</p>
<p>and one time we were</p>
<p>at mel&rsquo;s diner</p>
<p>and it was late at</p>
<p>night man it was like one o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like yo eddie</p>
<p>eddie yo eddie</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like man who&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>motherfucker talking to me man i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have to</p>
<p>fight this dude in</p>
<p>front of my chick</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s remember</p>
<p>that oh my god you remember that yeah you thought</p>
<p>i was like some dude who&rsquo;s just fucking with you</p>
<p>i i had it thrust</p>
<p>down i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i thought you were</p>
<p>cause i was with the</p>
<p>chick and i</p>
<p>thought you were saying something to the chick</p>
<p>yeah you didn&rsquo;t hear what i was saying and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see that good so you couldn&rsquo;t see me from a distance</p>
<p>so by the time i came up to your</p>
<p>table you&rsquo;re like who&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re oh hey dude</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t watch newsredo and at that</p>
<p>point it was before fear factor so</p>
<p>i never watched news radio and</p>
<p>so i was like okay i hear he&rsquo;s an actor or something</p>
<p>like i barely remembered</p>
<p>but then when i saw you</p>
<p>at the comedy show that was by luck too</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>there with me you just came there yeah i</p>
<p>was just acting</p>
<p>i would go see come</p>
<p>cause right when i</p>
<p>started smoking weed</p>
<p>i began to appreciate comedy way more because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way better all of a</p>
<p>sudden my mind</p>
<p>figured out how to</p>
<p>write comedy</p>
<p>right when i</p>
<p>started smoking weed</p>
<p>i never under i was fascinated with comedy</p>
<p>but i never</p>
<p>understood how they put bits together i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand the</p>
<p>setup i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand the</p>
<p>structure of comedy</p>
<p>but as soon as i</p>
<p>start smoking weed</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like i know</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing i know what they&rsquo;re doing now they&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re taking that</p>
<p>and then doing so i</p>
<p>understood the</p>
<p>basic formula</p>
<p>so i just became fascinated</p>
<p>and then i saw you i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that dude from my</p>
<p>jiu jitsu school</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an actor</p>
<p>and you killed me you were just</p>
<p>you were all nothing but dick jokes</p>
<p>and like relationship jokes</p>
<p>chick jokes dating joke</p>
<p>but you were killing it</p>
<p>and then when you came you walked off</p>
<p>stage like hey dude</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up dude</p>
<p>i know you fucking were awesome</p>
<p>and then we then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>he invited me to give him a private or something</p>
<p>that was after</p>
<p>you at when i was taking</p>
<p>privates with that dude yeah and then you came down to</p>
<p>class and then and then the pot smoking</p>
<p>began that was it</p>
<p>yeah you know it took me</p>
<p>it i thought you totally smoked weed so</p>
<p>last year let&rsquo;s not tell</p>
<p>about the story</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>illegal oh one</p>
<p>thing the one part</p>

<p>you know he brought me in as a consultant</p>
<p>i ended up getting</p>
<p>a little part i got a couple songs on the</p>

<p>to fill all the holes to make sure that a hardcore</p>
<p>mma fan could come to them and</p>
<p>watch this movie</p>
<p>and couldn&rsquo;t poke any holes</p>
