<p>communicate with my patients based on</p>
<p>what you do to some degree Wow Wow thank</p>
<p>you that&rsquo;s awesome well I&rsquo;m really a</p>
<p>pleasure to meet you meet you in person</p>
<p>or actually sort of through the line</p>
<p>internet lines here you know just for</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s knowledge you&rsquo;re gonna be one</p>
<p>of the main speakers at our next Quito</p>
<p>summit coming up in August at the end of</p>
<p>August August 31st and September 1st</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh I think it&rsquo;s Labor Day weekend</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna have a blast so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really excited to have you come out and</p>
<p>speak you know you you bring to the</p>
<p>table something very unique I mean you</p>
<p>know one of the big things right now hot</p>
<p>topics is this cholesterol thing and the</p>
<p>LDL and people are concerned and you see</p>
<p>these things in the in the news where oh</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t to key though it&rsquo;s gonna raise</p>
<p>your cholesterol and you&rsquo;re gonna die</p>
<p>have a heart attack</p>
<p>yeah I yeah and so I&rsquo;m coming just from</p>
<p>your field I mean I guess that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re taught right in school like</p>
<p>I guess the whole cholesterol dogma has</p>
<p>been pushed so much it&rsquo;s so ingrained in</p>
<p>us that it&rsquo;s sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to look</p>
<p>at the actual data what&rsquo;s your what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your thought on that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like delving right into it and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re doing it that way</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t waste time in</p>
<p>unnecessary stuff exactly but I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>practicing for almost 30 years and as a</p>
<p>cardiologist and the dogma that has been</p>
<p>taught to us is that low cholesterol low</p>
<p>LDL is one of the best things for you to</p>
<p>do and unfortunately if you compile all</p>
<p>information about optimal human</p>
<p>nutrition about human brain size about</p>
<p>what we need to eat and how we need to</p>
<p>behave to reduce our LDL cholesterol C</p>
<p>Nevitt ibly it&rsquo;s going to lead to very</p>
<p>poor health it&rsquo;s gonna lead to obesity</p>
<p>insulin resistance diabetes hypertension</p>
<p>all the chronic diseases that are going</p>
<p>to reduce your quality of life that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make you die earlier and so I was</p>
<p>kind of surprised that there&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>huge paradox between LDL cholesterol and</p>
<p>every other biomarker of health you can</p>
<p>take anyone you know they go in opposite</p>
<p>direction if you want to improve your</p>
<p>insulin resistance your LDL is going to</p>
<p>go up if you want to reduce your weight</p>
<p>your LDL is going to go up interesting</p>
<p>interesting so I started thinking about</p>
<p>this as a paradox but then when you put</p>
<p>everything together you understand that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how our body is probably designed</p>
<p>to behave and so I go out there now for</p>
<p>the last five years it took me time to</p>
<p>understand why LDL goes up on a low-carb</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>and it took me time to understand that</p>
<p>that is not necessarily bad and in some</p>
<p>ways having higher LDL cholesterol with</p>
<p>very good other biomarkers might be</p>
<p>something to celebrate not my own and I</p>
<p>could elaborate on some of that but I</p>
<p>wanted more interaction I wondered you</p>
<p>to kind of chime in and say hey I want</p>
<p>to lead this podcast in this direction</p>
<p>yeah exactly because I wanted to there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some there&rsquo;s some things that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>interested in personally that I would</p>
<p>like to know your viewpoint on you know</p>
<p>cholesterol LDL this is called bad</p>
<p>cholesterol but really it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cargo ship</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a transport ship and it delivers</p>
<p>cholesterol we need cholesterol I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>hoping that most people know that our</p>
<p>body makes cholesterol but what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>interested to just start off with</p>
<p>talking about is your take on LDL</p>
<p>actually carries I think all of the fat</p>
<p>soluble vitamins but I&rsquo;m an a de K k1</p>
<p>and k2 have you seen any data on that</p>
<p>especially even vitamin e to as an</p>
<p>antioxidant I think it does the data on</p>
<p>this is kind of not at least I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>aware of some very good data on that</p>
<p>okay that vitamin D does have its own</p>
<p>carrier protein and that may be the LDL</p>
<p>is a secondary mechanism for carrying</p>
<p>vitamin D around but I guess one of the</p>
<p>other major functions of LDL would be to</p>
<p>carry Co Q 10 because I&rsquo;m not sure all</p>
<p>the muscle cells are capable of making</p>
<p>the Co Q 10 that they need for</p>
<p>mitochondrial function and but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right LDL is a carrier molecule not just</p>
<p>for triglycerides and cholesterol per se</p>
<p>but for many antioxidants fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamins</p>
<p>Co Q 10 yeah and I do know that you have</p>
<p>all these phospholipids as well that our</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a that make up the cell</p>
<p>wall and so we have a transport system</p>
<p>of cholesterol cholesterol doesn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>float around by itself it needs to be</p>
<p>transported and I think that if you</p>
<p>could just touch a little bit on the the</p>
<p>necessary function of LDL that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>area I wanted to want to touch on and</p>
<p>then also I want you to maybe mention a</p>
<p>little bit about statins and what the</p>
<p>problem with statins that you run into</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that you know it&rsquo;s a hot topic</p>
<p>with in your field I mean I&rsquo;m a lot of</p>
<p>cardiologists prescribe them right so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s first talk about cholesterol in</p>
<p>general and then move on to allyl</p>
<p>cholesterol in particular cholesterol in</p>
<p>general is an extremely important</p>
<p>molecule for life there is no life on</p>
<p>earth without cholesterol every living</p>
<p>cell has cholesterol if you go back to</p>
<p>some of the earliest parts of evolution</p>
<p>when we started out as single-celled</p>
<p>beings in this world those single cells</p>
<p>also had cholesterol really if you look</p>
<p>at cholesterol it is an integral part of</p>
<p>every cell membrane the cell membrane</p>
<p>gets its structural integrity the</p>
<p>fluidity so that it acts as a barrier</p>
<p>because cholesterol is connecting the</p>
<p>phospholipids in such a way that it is</p>
<p>providing those functions</p>
<p>the second major way to think about</p>
<p>cholesterol is to look at brain function</p>
<p>because in our brain there are these</p>
<p>cholesterol rafts and these rafts are</p>
<p>locations where neurotransmitters set so</p>
<p>the structural integrity of the</p>
<p>neurotransmitter receptors</p>
<p>is because of these cholesterol rafts</p>
<p>and if you deprive the brain of</p>
<p>cholesterol the integrity of these</p>
<p>neurotransmitter receptors is affected</p>
<p>so there is a lot of data that comes out</p>
<p>and says that there are certain statins</p>
<p>that cross the blood-brain barrier can</p>
<p>have significant cognitive dysfunction -</p>
<p>and in fact cholesterol is so important</p>
<p>for the brain that it does not delegate</p>
<p>the responsibility to any other organ to</p>
<p>make cholesterol it makes its own Wow</p>
<p>and I often joke that I would not be</p>
<p>able to deal with the stress of being a</p>
<p>cardiologist or giving this podcast if</p>
<p>it were not for cholesterol because the</p>
<p>LDL molecule is supplying cholesterol as</p>
<p>raw material to my adrenal gland so that</p>
<p>it can make the stress hormone which is</p>
<p>called cortisone and and that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>absolutely amazing fact that many of the</p>
<p>hormones the backbone of that is a</p>
<p>cholesterol molecule and the carrier</p>
<p>molecule that is supplying that</p>
<p>cholesterol to make that is the LDL and</p>
<p>I often joke to audiences saying that</p>
<p>hey men look handsome because of LDL</p>
<p>cholesterol I like that and the reason</p>
<p>is is because the LDL is the one that is</p>
<p>supplying testes with cholesterol the</p>
<p>raw material to make testosterone and</p>
<p>similarly women look beautiful because</p>
<p>their ovaries also need cholesterol to</p>
<p>convert cholesterol to estrogens so</p>
<p>these are functions that are sometimes</p>
<p>completely skimmed over when we tried to</p>
<p>knock the LDL down like crazy and say</p>
<p>hey we the lowest is better and it made</p>
<p>no sense to me as a cardiologist because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been practicing for 30 years and I</p>
<p>have seen people come in having</p>
<p>extensive three vessels heart disease</p>
<p>with blockages everywhere with</p>
<p>cholesterol levels as low as 50 Wow Wow</p>
<p>and I have seen 90 year old women or</p>
<p>older with LDL cholesterol in the mid to</p>
<p>hundreds who I take them to the cardiac</p>
<p>cath lab and I find that they have the</p>
<p>most beautiful blood vessels that you</p>
<p>and I although maybe several decades</p>
<p>younger would be happy to trade those</p>
<p>blood vessels for them</p>
<p>Wow Wow that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s fascinating so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a bit of a skeptic all my life</p>
<p>about this cholesterol being a causal</p>
<p>factor in coronary artery disease</p>
<p>because it made no sense and if you</p>
<p>really take the trouble to talk to</p>
<p>patients you would find that they</p>
<p>complain of all kinds of side effects on</p>
<p>cholesterol reducing medicines it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that the medical profession has moved in</p>
<p>such a direction that we rely so much on</p>
<p>information coming in from societies</p>
<p>that we have given up our clinical</p>
<p>acumen we have given up our critical</p>
<p>thinking ability we want to just follow</p>
<p>guidelines we don&rsquo;t want to do our own</p>
<p>work we don&rsquo;t listen to patients we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be skeptics as a physician</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s highly necessary for us to</p>
<p>be quite skeptical about every</p>
<p>information and use our clinical</p>
<p>intuition when we are taking care of</p>
<p>patients exactly I also was fascinated</p>
<p>that the LDL cholesterol is so involved</p>
<p>in host defense and this is not</p>
<p>something many people talk about because</p>
<p>host defense that means how we protect</p>
<p>against bacteria and viruses is in some</p>
<p>ways mediated by the LDL cholesterol</p>
<p>put out some elegant information from</p>
<p>different studies that I have looked at</p>
<p>in which like for example there is this</p>
<p>fascinating paper which looked at a</p>
<p>mouse lung and they infected the mouse</p>
<p>lung with bacteria and these bacteria</p>
<p>they elaborate a little protein that</p>
<p>goes in as a pilot to investigate and</p>
<p>see if the milieu is suitable to</p>
<p>establish an infection so the bacteria</p>
<p>themselves is smart they won&rsquo;t go in and</p>
<p>start an infection without checking the</p>
<p>area out first and that marker protein</p>
<p>comes back and gives an information to</p>
<p>the bacteria it&rsquo;s called quorum sensing</p>
<p>protein and it comes back and says hey</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s establish infection and I was</p>
<p>surprised to find that in this paper</p>
<p>this elegant work that shows that it is</p>
<p>the LDL cholesterol that is going in</p>
<p>there and neutralizing this protein so</p>
<p>that bacterial infection cannot gain a</p>
<p>foothold Wow fascinating fascinating I</p>
<p>definitely want to get a copy of that so</p>
<p>um it yes it actually has ability to</p>
<p>attack pathogens it also has the ability</p>
<p>to bring antioxidants into a certain</p>
<p>area and dump vitamin E into an</p>
<p>epithelial wall to help protect against</p>
<p>lesions I mean now most the time from my</p>
<p>viewpoint it seems like people go on a</p>
<p>keto program and it lowers the LDL but</p>
<p>then you have people that have a higher</p>
<p>LDL lets us talk about what would be</p>
<p>some of the reasons why someone would</p>
<p>actually cut the carbs down and their</p>
<p>LDL would go up any reason for that yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of my strengths I think that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a little credit that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the first one to point out in a</p>
<p>national audience now as to the</p>
<p>molecular mechanisms why LDL is going up</p>
<p>and and I&rsquo;m so glad that</p>
<p>you brought that up because this is</p>
<p>something that has bothered me a lot you</p>
<p>know as a cardiologist for the last five</p>
<p>years I have been practicing a low carb</p>
<p>diet myself and recommending it to a lot</p>
<p>of patients and I have been seeing that</p>
<p>as many you know in large majority of</p>
<p>these patients as they lose weight as</p>
<p>their diabetes improves as they come off</p>
<p>diabetic medications as their</p>
<p>triglyceride levels go down as their HDL</p>
<p>level goes up the one troubling finding</p>
<p>that was happening is that the LDL goes</p>
<p>up and it goes up unlike what people</p>
<p>think it goes up almost in everyone it</p>
<p>may go up to a variable degree but it</p>
<p>goes up in everyone so I wanted to</p>
<p>explain why that is happening and in the</p>
<p>final analysis I think this is and</p>
<p>although this is my model and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>being proven in studies yet but I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we should do is that when</p>
<p>you are going on a low-carb diet by</p>
<p>design you&rsquo;re burning fat we have very</p>
<p>limited carbohydrate reserves we run out</p>
<p>of them in a situation in which we stop</p>
<p>eating like intermittent fasting or</p>
<p>going on a fast for several days you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna run out of carbohydrate reserves</p>
<p>in about six to eight hours and then</p>
<p>your body predominantly becomes fat</p>
<p>burning so it&rsquo;s burning triglycerides</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s there are certain tissues that</p>
<p>cannot directly burn triglycerides so</p>
<p>what it does is that the liver takes the</p>
<p>triglycerides and converts them to</p>
<p>ketones</p>
<p>so the liver is the only organ that has</p>
<p>the enzymatic machinery to make ketones</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s taking the triglycerides it</p>
<p>converts the triglycerides to acetyl co</p>
<p>a which then enters the mitochondria and</p>
<p>then the acetyl co it through a series</p>
<p>of enzymatic reaction gets converted to</p>
<p>HMG</p>
<p>Kawai now hmg-coa fascinatingly is a</p>
<p>branch point it&rsquo;s the same raw material</p>
<p>that cholesterol uses to make</p>
<p>cholesterol in the body that means</p>
<p>hmg-coa can go on and make cholesterol</p>
<p>and hmg-coa can also get converted to</p>
<p>ketones that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>interesting so if by design you are</p>
<p>doing better oxidation of fat it just</p>
<p>means that you&rsquo;re burning fat if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>burning fat you are making a lot of</p>
<p>ketones and if you&rsquo;re making a lot of</p>
<p>ketones by design you&rsquo;re going to make a</p>
<p>lot of cholesterol in the liver and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not just basing this on hypotheses there</p>
<p>are a lot of animal studies that are</p>
<p>human studies that give you indirect</p>
<p>evidence that this is what is happening</p>
<p>and if you think it&rsquo;s right I want to</p>
<p>take you through a few of these yeah</p>
<p>yeah I think you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it makes</p>
<p>total sense because ya could go split</p>
<p>off this way and make ketones or</p>
<p>cholesterol so I do remember that</p>
<p>chemistry so like wow I never actually</p>
<p>considered that viewpoint but that that</p>
<p>makes a lot of sense and I think the</p>
<p>this in this day and age the reason it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to collaborate is because a</p>
<p>biochemist is not gonna completely look</p>
<p>at that point and say hey I want to</p>
<p>think about it that way right neither is</p>
<p>a nutritionist and not as a cardiologist</p>
<p>along because they don&rsquo;t understand the</p>
<p>details of the biochemical steps in the</p>
<p>liver but when you put all of these</p>
<p>people together in a podcast like yours</p>
<p>or at a local conference it starts</p>
<p>gelling this information and that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>we would make advanced by collaborating</p>
<p>right so I to go back into this</p>
<p>information so there is there are these</p>
<p>drugs which are being used for diabetes</p>
<p>which are called sglt2 inhibitors in</p>
<p>Kanna is one of them Giardia &ndash;nz is one</p>
<p>of them and basically what these drugs</p>
<p>do is that our body filters sugar in the</p>
<p>kidneys but it reabsorbs most of the</p>
<p>sugar but these drugs poison the kidney</p>
<p>tubules in such a way that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>reabsorb the sugar that you&rsquo;re filtering</p>
<p>so basically you&rsquo;re dumping sugar so</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re dumping sugar and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not eating carbs or if you are let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>fasting the body switches to fat</p>
<p>metabolism because you don&rsquo;t have sugar</p>
<p>available you&rsquo;re going to do now fat</p>
<p>burning so when they started using this</p>
<p>in humans they started noticing that</p>
<p>ketone levels go up they also started</p>
<p>noticing that LDL cholesterol levels go</p>
<p>up and fascinatingly in some of these</p>
<p>studies now that since there is no</p>
<p>conflict here in the sense that the</p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies and I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>for being a skeptic but the</p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies want to show</p>
<p>that hey dumping sugar and reducing your</p>
<p>blood sugar is beneficial for you and by</p>
<p>the way it&rsquo;ll be helpful for you to</p>
<p>prevent heart disease and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they found but they could not explain</p>
<p>hey you&rsquo;re improving heart disease but</p>
<p>your LDL levels are going up and so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an accompanying paper that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>done in a in a hamster which goes into</p>
<p>the biochemical mechanisms with this so</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is that as you are</p>
<p>dumping sugar you are not making more</p>
<p>ketones and as you&rsquo;re making more</p>
<p>ketones the liver is synthesizing more</p>
<p>cholesterol and since the liver has a</p>
<p>higher amount of cholesterol</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t need cholesterol for itself</p>
<p>otherwise what the liver does is that</p>
<p>hey cholesterol is so important for me</p>
<p>let me soak up some cholesterol from</p>
<p>circulation and it has these LDL</p>
<p>receptors</p>
<p>these receptors are there that soak up</p>
<p>the cholesterol from the circulation and</p>
<p>remove it for liver to be able to use it</p>
<p>but since LDL since liver is</p>
<p>synthesizing so much cholesterol it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need that cholesterol from</p>
<p>circulation so it down regulates the LDL</p>
<p>receptors and also since it&rsquo;s making so</p>
<p>much cholesterol and since cholesterol</p>
<p>is not a metabolic fuel in other words</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t burn cholesterol like we can</p>
<p>burn sugar and triglycerides the only</p>
<p>way for us to eliminate it is in bile</p>
<p>well the paper shows that your</p>
<p>cholesterol elimination and bile goes up</p>
<p>so you can see that the feces are now</p>
<p>filled with cholesterol Wow Wow and</p>
<p>another fascinating mechanism that they</p>
<p>talked about is that the LDL cholesterol</p>
<p>is in some way an antioxidant it it is</p>
<p>fighting antioxidant injury and it gets</p>
<p>oxidized in the process when it gets</p>
<p>oxidized in the process it gets picked</p>
<p>up by the macrophages through a certain</p>
<p>receptor so the macrophages go around</p>
<p>and say hey this LDL has done its job</p>
<p>let me just pick it out from circulation</p>
<p>and this paper shows that these</p>
<p>macrophages that are laden with oxidized</p>
<p>LDL cholesterol their elimination</p>
<p>through the gut through feces is</p>
<p>promoted in the setting of fat oxidation</p>
<p>so here is a complete picture you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>burning fat you&rsquo;re making more ketones</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making more cholesterol in the</p>
<p>liver and hence you gonna make more LDL</p>
<p>because the liver has to mobilize that</p>
<p>cholesterol it&rsquo;s going to down regulate</p>
<p>the LDL receptors because it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need cholesterol anymore it&rsquo;s gonna up</p>
<p>regulate cholesterol elimination so your</p>
<p>bile acid production goes up the</p>
<p>elimination of body goes</p>
<p>and it also improves the elimination of</p>
<p>oxidized cholesterol fascinating so so</p>
<p>um a couple things if you&rsquo;re getting an</p>
<p>increase by all production you could</p>
<p>also have could be create a laxative</p>
<p>effect you could have a little diarrhea</p>
<p>maybe some of the side effects but the</p>
<p>question I have is that time so people</p>
<p>are probably understanding this now but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thinking is this extra</p>
<p>cholesterol going to stick and my</p>
<p>arteries and clogged up an artery that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the big question that</p>
<p>they are concerned about so I think that</p>
<p>one thing I would like to humbly submit</p>
<p>is that we don&rsquo;t understand the</p>
<p>molecular mechanisms why we get plaque</p>
<p>in our blood vessels and I almost</p>
<p>hesitate to call it an adverse periodic</p>
<p>plaque because that gives it a</p>
<p>connotation that somehow cholesterol is</p>
<p>the culprit so I want to stay and say</p>
<p>hey it is plaque formation and to say</p>
<p>that the LDL is the primary culprit that</p>
<p>gets on to the vascular wall onto the</p>
<p>sub endothelium and I know I want to be</p>
<p>cognizant on by not using too many</p>
<p>medical terms that is the layer just</p>
<p>beneath the lining of a blood vessel and</p>
<p>then initiate a response in which you</p>
<p>are making plaque is by no means</p>
<p>scientifically agreed that that are the</p>
<p>mechanisms</p>
<p>it is quite equally possible that the</p>
<p>LDL cholesterol is there to help repair</p>
<p>an injury that happened as a result of</p>
<p>oxidative stress which means that</p>
<p>whenever you burn something you create</p>
<p>an injury an oxygen when it is used in a</p>
<p>certain way creates an injury at the</p>
<p>level of the vessel and that could be</p>
<p>from high blood pressure</p>
<p>that would be from result of an</p>
<p>infection that could be because you have</p>
<p>insulin resistant and as a result of</p>
<p>that you have systemic inflammation that</p>
<p>is leading to vascular injury and is</p>
<p>this vascular injury being promoted by</p>
<p>the LDL or is the LDL just there to help</p>
<p>prevent oxidative damage and in the</p>
<p>process you see it around and that does</p>
<p>not mean that it is the culprit and one</p>
<p>of the many people from whom I have</p>
<p>borrowed this line is that if you order</p>
<p>a scene of a fire you&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>firefighters but you&rsquo;re never gonna</p>
<p>blame the firefighters for causing the</p>
<p>fire right right and so is the case with</p>
<p>the LDL I&rsquo;m not sure it is there too</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the culprit I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if it is there to help right</p>
<p>the paradox is that you see vascular</p>
<p>damage in people with very low LDLs and</p>
<p>you see no vascular damage in people</p>
<p>with LDLs in the mid to hundreds and it</p>
<p>simply does not jive that it is a graded</p>
<p>culprit if it is a graded culprit you</p>
<p>should see consistency of effect right</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s a graded culprit you should</p>
<p>see that hey if I reduce my cholesterol</p>
<p>LDL cholesterol down to 30 milligrams</p>
<p>per deciliter since this is my primary</p>
<p>hypothesis that this is what is causing</p>
<p>vascular injury I should see no vascular</p>
<p>injury and I can take you through many</p>
<p>papers in which they have dropped the</p>
<p>LDL down to 30 milligrams and have</p>
<p>changed the event rate either by less</p>
<p>than half a percent or have done it in</p>
<p>the opposite direction so to me that</p>
<p>makes no sense and this is the kind of</p>
<p>critical thinking that I want</p>
<p>physicians who are taking care of</p>
<p>patients to do is that you cannot rely</p>
<p>on relative risk reduction that many of</p>
<p>the papers talk about but you want to</p>
<p>look at absolute risk reduction you want</p>
<p>to look at the integrity of data you</p>
<p>need to be a skeptic and see who is</p>
<p>doing the studies and what is their bias</p>
<p>behind that right right yeah they just I</p>
<p>think they in 2005 they came out with a</p>
<p>rule I&rsquo;m not sure how well drug</p>
<p>companies follow it that they have to be</p>
<p>more transparent upload all the research</p>
<p>on a given drug I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>following that but before 2005 they you</p>
<p>could selectively publish what you</p>
<p>wanted to publish unfortunately so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re if you as a doctor researching</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re only getting half the picture</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just you&rsquo;re gonna see something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not not the true data one thing I</p>
<p>was gonna ask you</p>
<p>being a cardiologist what when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking into an artery looking at plaque</p>
<p>do you find a certain pattern of where</p>
<p>that plaque is located is it always in</p>
<p>the carotid arteries is it in another</p>
<p>artery does it happen in certain high</p>
<p>pressure areas or does it just random</p>
<p>well to a large degree it does happen</p>
<p>with there are where there is shear</p>
<p>stress so you know shear it could be a</p>
<p>medical term so basically at a branch</p>
<p>point the blood flow is not laminar the</p>
<p>you know laminar is smooth blood flow</p>
<p>turbulence is when the blood flow is not</p>
<p>smooth and our areas of branch point</p>
<p>there is possibility of turbulence and</p>
<p>at this point there is a lot of stress</p>
<p>on the vessel wall and that can happen</p>
<p>as a result of high blood pressure that</p>
<p>can happen as a result of the blood</p>
<p>vessels getting constricted which means</p>
<p>getting smaller so you predominantly see</p>
<p>flag buildup</p>
<p>those locations but it can also be found</p>
<p>at other places that are more or less</p>
<p>random that you would say hey this is a</p>
<p>process that you can predict to some</p>
<p>degree that it will happen at branch</p>
<p>points and are places of high shear</p>
<p>stress but it can also happen in other</p>
<p>locations so like for example you</p>
<p>mentioned the carotid arteries the</p>
<p>carotid arteries bifurcate when I say</p>
<p>bifurcate they divide into two blood</p>
<p>vessels right here in the neck and at</p>
<p>this point one blood vessels going and</p>
<p>supplying the brain the other blood</p>
<p>vessel is supplying the face and at that</p>
<p>branch point there is more likelihood of</p>
<p>you getting buildup of plaque and</p>
<p>buildup of blockages and I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>stay away from saying buildup of an</p>
<p>asterisk erotic plaque right because</p>
<p>that implies a certain causation and</p>
<p>then you what about the coronary</p>
<p>arteries that is that more common than</p>
<p>the carotid so both occur concurrently</p>
<p>like if you have coronary artery disease</p>
<p>the likelihood that you can have carotid</p>
<p>artery disease is about 50% and if you</p>
<p>have carotid artery disease the</p>
<p>likelihood of you having coronary artery</p>
<p>disease goes up dramatically and what</p>
<p>goes up even higher a more a further</p>
<p>end-stage that means a more advanced</p>
<p>stage of vascular disease would be</p>
<p>blockages in the blood vessels of the</p>
<p>leg so if you have lock edges in the</p>
<p>blood vessels on the leg the possibility</p>
<p>that you have heart disease which means</p>
<p>blockages carotid disease the blood</p>
<p>supply to the brain and kidney disease</p>
<p>is very high so unfortunately people</p>
<p>with blockages in their blood vessels</p>
<p>that demonstrates that there is a more</p>
<p>advanced vascular disease present in</p>
<p>them and hence you would find it in</p>
<p>other locations as well interesting</p>
<p>the patients that come see you are they</p>
<p>coming with blood pressure or are they</p>
<p>coming because they already been</p>
<p>diagnosed and they need surgery what</p>
<p>type of clients come to see you so in</p>
<p>the first 24 years of my practice I</p>
<p>predominantly tried to work in the</p>
<p>cardiac cath lab so I would see patients</p>
<p>referred to me with blockages in the</p>
<p>blood vessels of the heart and I would</p>
<p>take them to the cath lab and put stents</p>
<p>in them and fix them and these people do</p>
<p>have high blood pressure</p>
<p>many of them are diabetic many of them</p>
<p>have I would say I hate to use the term</p>
<p>high cholesterol I would say poor</p>
<p>quality cholesterol I&rsquo;ve started using</p>
<p>that term and poor quality cholesterol</p>
<p>and my view is somebody who&rsquo;s got high</p>
<p>triglycerides and low HDL and if you</p>
<p>divide or if you evaluate their LDL</p>
<p>cholesterol properly it is the small</p>
<p>dense molecule and launch not the large</p>
<p>and fluffy molecule so they had a number</p>
<p>of these factors and I would open them</p>
<p>up in the in the cardiac cath lab but in</p>
<p>the last five years have gone through a</p>
<p>transformation and I said hey if this</p>
<p>nutrition works and me I should try it</p>
<p>in my patients and so now I spend more</p>
<p>and more time at least 50% of my time or</p>
<p>more in the office and I am surprised</p>
<p>that I on a weekly basis get calls from</p>
<p>people in New York California Arizona</p>
<p>New Mexico and Louisiana saying that hey</p>
<p>we want to come see you Wow for for</p>
<p>nutritional advice for questions that</p>
<p>they have about the LDL and you know and</p>
<p>I tell them that look it&rsquo;s I feel</p>
<p>uncomfortable that you need to travel</p>
<p>all the way to come see me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that you will find a local</p>
<p>practitioner nearby who can give you all</p>
<p>the information that you need because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too much for somebody to travel</p>
<p>take an airplane just to come see a fish</p>
<p>in our short office is it so now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>beginning to see more and more people</p>
<p>who are coming purely for nutritional</p>
<p>advice and I say okay yeah I will do</p>
<p>that but you will be surprised that when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving nutritional advice you</p>
<p>uncover that their poor nutrition has</p>
<p>contributed to insulin resistance high</p>
<p>blood pressure diabetes obesity in so</p>
<p>many different ways and I am surprised</p>
<p>that the impact of nutrition and</p>
<p>lifestyle is so much greater than</p>
<p>medications Wow it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an order</p>
<p>of magnitude greater than medications</p>
<p>without the side effects and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure why people are not working at that</p>
<p>and and and and that&rsquo;s why my opening</p>
<p>slide at low carb Denver said I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>concerned that the medical profession is</p>
<p>gonna get buggy whipped that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>because they are not listening to the</p>
<p>grass root movements that says hey I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing all these things and I am</p>
<p>improving why as a medical professional</p>
<p>are you not looking into this right</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s starting it&rsquo;s like oh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a wild flower flower just</p>
<p>spreading all over the place so yes it</p>
<p>may be if you if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>after all it comes down to the patient</p>
<p>and the patient does want this shift is</p>
<p>they want alternatives they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily like the drugs they want to</p>
<p>get off the drugs so they&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>doctors like you and that can actually</p>
<p>give them a good good information so</p>
<p>yeah things are really really changing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so you you basically you you must</p>
<p>have a lot of actually probably very</p>
<p>enjoyable to take someone where you can</p>
<p>see it&rsquo;s pretty obvious and then</p>
<p>completely shift them but by changing</p>
<p>their diet it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s such a big of</p>
<p>that you can create that probably before</p>
<p>yeah I know in my practicing before I</p>
<p>knew about some of this stuff you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be treating these specific symptoms</p>
<p>with all these different pills people</p>
<p>would go home with a hundred pills and</p>
<p>all these vitamins and stuff but I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work on the basics I didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the eating corrected until I started</p>
<p>doing that like the need for all these</p>
<p>other things go way down so it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>remarkable so I&rsquo;m so happy that I had a</p>
<p>chance to talk to you I and get this</p>
<p>great data and I&rsquo;m excited to have you</p>
<p>come out so those of you that are</p>
<p>watching you should come out and</p>
<p>definitely come to our event it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be at the end I&rsquo;ll put a link down</p>
<p>below and I also want to put a link to</p>
<p>your YouTube channel so people can start</p>
<p>watching your videos I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to release more videos yes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true they come either under my</p>
<p>name which is Nadira lee md and they</p>
<p>also come under eat mostly fats</p>
<p>nutrition all right some of them are</p>
<p>being released by keto fast and look up</p>
<p>down under but if I mean I want to</p>
<p>entice your audience and not that your</p>
<p>your conference is not going to be</p>
<p>completely sold out I heard that last</p>
<p>year you did it on very short notice and</p>
<p>even though you did it on short notice</p>
<p>there were no seats that were unfilled</p>
<p>and people were waiting in line but I</p>
<p>wanted to still entice them to come</p>
<p>because the talk that I am working on</p>
<p>right now and which is very fascinating</p>
<p>is to answer the question as to what is</p>
<p>optimal human nutrition and the way I</p>
<p>want to approach that area is by looking</p>
<p>at these concepts and I&rsquo;ll just leave</p>
<p>you with the concepts I&rsquo;ll not define</p>
<p>them in any particular way one of them</p>
<p>would be what is called the extensive</p>
<p>tissue hypothesis what that simply means</p>
<p>is that we have such an enormous energy</p>
<p>expensive brain that is three times the</p>
<p>size that you would</p>
<p>predict based on our body size or any</p>
<p>primate ancestor there&rsquo;s 2% of our body</p>
<p>mass and it consumes 20% energy so</p>
<p>feeding that brain is very important the</p>
<p>second aspect of that would be that how</p>
<p>our digestive system has modulated and</p>
<p>evolved over these periods what is the</p>
<p>diet that is suitable for us</p>
<p>the third thing would be what is our</p>
<p>pancreas doing our pancreas kind of</p>
<p>evolved without the stresses that the</p>
<p>modern diet is putting on it and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not capable of handling glycemic load</p>
<p>that we are giving to it in this day and</p>
<p>age with the diet that PE and then</p>
<p>finally I want to look at the microbiome</p>
<p>you know we have a gut that has bacteria</p>
<p>in it and how important is the</p>
<p>microbiome how important is is</p>
<p>fermentation and there are many other</p>
<p>concepts that are going to come in play</p>
<p>to evaluate the most optimal human</p>
<p>nutrition Wow you guys you have to come</p>
<p>to learn about this this is gonna be</p>
<p>exciting I can&rsquo;t wait to hear you it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be good thank you I hope I</p>
<p>delivered on my promise I think you will</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re a great presenter and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve filled with gold it&rsquo;s great great</p>
<p>and rate data so thank you so much and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to talking more with</p>
<p>you in a couple of months I absolutely</p>
<p>enjoyed being on your podcast Eric and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honored that I&rsquo;ll be a part of your</p>
<p>conference awesome thank you</p>
