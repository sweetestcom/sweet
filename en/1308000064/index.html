    <p>Look at free bird. He&rsquo;s like, this is so awkward. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got literally brought popcorn.</p>
<p>Did I was watching the show.</p>
<p>You brought popcorn.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I want to see round three.</p>
<p>I have nothing to say today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to sit here and watch.</p>
<p>I brought popcorn.</p>
<p>I got my chili roasted pistachio nuts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to sit back and enjoy the J.</p>
<p>Cal Sacks.</p>
<p>Rain man, David Sacks.</p>
<p>And it said, we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Queen of King Kong.</p>
<p>Are we really going to do this as the top story?</p>
<p>I mean, this is the third time we&rsquo;ve tried to do this story.</p>
<p>Do we give the background sacks or no?</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t have had to do it over and over again if you didn&rsquo;t act so hysterical.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>First one you killed.</p>
<p>No, you killed it.</p>
<p>No, the first one you killed.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it wasn&rsquo;t even on the docket and it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t even newsworthy.</p>
<p>OK, and the second one I killed.</p>
<p>Because you came across like a stark raving lunatic.</p>
<p>I spiked it the second time because I was so infuriated</p>
<p>by your cavalier attitude towards it.</p>
<p>What are you worried about my attitude for?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you just focus on making your own good points?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I was so correct.</p>
<p>I was so correct.</p>
<p>The two of you.</p>
<p>Let him go, Timoth.</p>
<p>Let him go.</p>
<p>You guys got popcorn.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear this idiot try to blame his own hysteria on me.</p>
<p>You said that January six was overblown.</p>
<p>And of course, you know, I said it was a disgrace.</p>
<p>I said it was an embarrassment.</p>
<p>It was an embarrassment to the country.</p>
<p>I said it was wrong.</p>
<p>But you want to inflate it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re engaging in classic Washington threat inflation.</p>
<p>Nope. And and there&rsquo;s two problems with that.</p>
<p>One is you&rsquo;re going to take your eye off the ball of the real issues</p>
<p>facing the country, like inflation, the economy</p>
<p>and economic anxiety, like covid, like crime, like schools.</p>
<p>I mean, these are the issues that Americans care about.</p>
<p>Not, you know, a riot that happened over a year ago.</p>
<p>And if you and the Democrats keep talking about this and focus on it on MSNBC</p>
<p>to the exclusion of the issues that really matter, I&rsquo;ll see you in November</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to get slaughtered in this midterm election.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a landslide.</p>
<p>But the other problem with it is with this threat inflation is that it justifies</p>
<p>the expansion of surveillance powers</p>
<p>and prosecutorial powers by the Justice Department, by the, you know,</p>
<p>by the by the Justice Department, other branches of our government</p>
<p>who want to basically go after, you know, the so-called domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>That will lead to an infringement on civil liberties, just like the expansion</p>
<p>of those agencies did after 9-11.</p>
<p>And so I think we should all be concerned about it.</p>
<p>Now, look, are these Oath Keepers a bunch of idiots?</p>
<p>Yeah, there were 11 Oath Keepers at that rally.</p>
<p>They broke into the wait a minute, wait a minute, you&rsquo;re saying prosecuted.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying an old fat guy with an eyepatch</p>
<p>and a hat that says Oath Keeper lifetime member is not credible to you.</p>
<p>Exactly. I mean, look, this is these guys are they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re not unlike the Antifa</p>
<p>right, you know, people in Portland who are trying to burn down buildings</p>
<p>or or chase of Houdin&rsquo;s parents who are domestic terrorists.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, this is a small number of knuckleheads who broke into the Capitol.</p>
<p>They should be prosecuted.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re guilty of saying this leader is saying intemperate things.</p>
<p>But was this going to be a coup to take over the Capitol?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>OK, let&rsquo;s focus on that to the exclusion of the real issues facing the country.</p>
<p>Like I said, this landslide in November, this red wave is going to be even bigger.</p>
<p>Just to your point about my focus every week here on the number one</p>
<p>tech podcast in the world and on the number six tech podcast in the world</p>
<p>this week in startups, I focus on all of those issues.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s read because we can chew gum and walk at the same time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s read what happened on Thursday.</p>
<p>The FBI arrested 11 members of the Oath Keepers on sedition charges</p>
<p>and the House Committee subpoenaed Facebook, Google, Reddit and Twitter</p>
<p>after insufficient responses to the January six riots or insurrection,</p>
<p>whichever term you prefer.</p>
<p>The leader of the Oath Keepers, which is an organization</p>
<p>that claims over 30,000 members primarily in the military and police.</p>
<p>OK, well, hold on a second.</p>
<p>If this was their big moment to stage a coup and take over the government,</p>
<p>why were only 11 of the 30,000 there?</p>
<p>The 11 were indicted, David.</p>
<p>There were how many were there?</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>But last week, you said last week you said there was no coordinated attack.</p>
<p>And now we have proof.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not what I said.</p>
<p>Look, you can&rsquo;t veto the segment from last week</p>
<p>and then try to claim that I said certain things.</p>
<p>Let me just fit it.</p>
<p>Can I get through the story or keep interrupting?</p>
<p>My God. OK, from the you&rsquo;re complaining about interruption.</p>
<p>OK, that&rsquo;s another interruption.</p>
<p>May I finish it with that before interruption?</p>
<p>Or would you like to just keep monologuing?</p>
<p>What are you reading?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you just give us the link so that the audience can just go</p>
<p>and get the actual story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to do, but you keep interrupting.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>While certain Oath Keeper members and affiliates inside Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>breached the Capitol grounds and buildings,</p>
<p>others remain stationed just outside the city in QRF teams.</p>
<p>These are quick response teams that had weapons</p>
<p>and they transported firearms into Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>And these in support operations were aimed at using force to stop the law</p>
<p>full transfer of presidential power, according to our Department of Justice,</p>
<p>which is majority Republican, obviously law enforcement skews.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s Republican. Yes, it is.</p>
<p>I mean, a portion of the Oath Keepers communication occurred on signal.</p>
<p>You think the FBI is pro-Republican?</p>
<p>Are you going to keep interrupting me?</p>
<p>Oh my God. Can I just read two sentences, Dave?</p>
<p>Get a taste of your own medicine, pal.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>Signal is an encrypted chat app that&rsquo;s not supposed to have any backdoors,</p>
<p>but obviously there are some plant.</p>
<p>Here are some of Rhodes&rsquo;s comments.</p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t getting through this without a civil war.</p>
<p>Too late for that.</p>
<p>Prepare your mind, body and spirit.</p>
<p>It will be a bloody and desperate fight.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have to fight.</p>
<p>This cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>If we want to make the January 6th stuff relevant.</p>
<p>First of all, let me just say I see that primarily as a media story.</p>
<p>What happened happened.</p>
<p>Obviously, it was a disgrace and embarrassment of Black Eye for the country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not supporting or defending anyone.</p>
<p>I tend to think these Oath Keepers, it was not like a super organized,</p>
<p>concerted effort to take over the government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a bunch of loudmouths who engaged in a riot.</p>
<p>Maybe there was more planning and preparation.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>The court case will bear it out.</p>
<p>And if they can prove that it was what you said it was, great.</p>
<p>Let them go to jail.</p>
<p>I have no desire to defend them.</p>
<p>But I also think that in the grand scheme of things,</p>
<p>this whole thing&rsquo;s been blown completely out of proportion.</p>
<p>I mean, if you watch MSNBC, it&rsquo;s all January 6th all the time.</p>
<p>And if Democrats are going to focus on this issue for the next 10 months,</p>
<p>and you know who Roger Stone was photographed on a sidewalk with,</p>
<p>which was the big story the other day, this red wave in November</p>
<p>is going to be an even bigger wave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just telling you right now, because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what the average voter in the country cares about.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right about that.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll agree with that.</p>
<p>I think MSNBC is focused on this, and Fox is focused on fake voter fraud.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been pretty clear here that none of us</p>
<p>agree with either of the extremes of media coverage.</p>
<p>I do think this is an issue worth resolving quickly.</p>
<p>Wait, what fake voter fraud are you talking about?</p>
<p>The guy who&rsquo;s obsessed right now with voter fraud is Biden.</p>
<p>He just gave a speech, a very intemperate speech,</p>
<p>saying that if you don&rsquo;t support his new Voting Rights Act,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re on the side of Bull Connor and Jefferson Davis.</p>
<p>There was some political calculus there.</p>
<p>He had to do that because he was also trying to basically bolster</p>
<p>the ability to get this filibuster thing passed in the Senate.</p>
<p>So he basically had to play a relatively weak hand.</p>
<p>And again, what happened, again, legislatively,</p>
<p>is that his own party said, no, enough.</p>
<p>In this case, it was Kyrsten Sinema who basically said, no, none of this.</p>
<p>Right, well, Sinema and Manchin won&rsquo;t support amending the filibuster.</p>
<p>So this thing was DOA.</p>
<p>We said it was DOA.</p>
<p>When the Build Back Better bill collapsed,</p>
<p>we said they were going to try and pivot to voting rights to change the subject,</p>
<p>even though it was DOA.</p>
<p>But there is something that Biden could do or could have done</p>
<p>that I think would be a bipartisan reform, which is to reform the Electoral Count Act.</p>
<p>I mean, what happened in November, if you&rsquo;re concerned about Trump and,</p>
<p>you know, the potential to subvert the election and the way he tried to influence</p>
<p>Pence to stop the counting of the electors, if you&rsquo;re concerned about all of that,</p>
<p>there is a fix for that, which is the Electoral Count Act of 1887.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely antiquated.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s been around for over 100 years.</p>
<p>There is bipartisan support for fixing that.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal editorial page has come out for months saying&hellip;</p>
<p>Explain what that is to the audience.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just a law that governs how these electors in the Electoral College</p>
<p>get counted up and certified so that, you know, the election gets certified.</p>
<p>So David Brooks had that piece that Chamath shared in the New York Times, which is</p>
<p>the problem we have right now is not in the actual voting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the, if you&rsquo;re worried about what happened in this past November,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the certification of the voting.</p>
<p>And, you know, what Brooks was writing about is there&rsquo;s a lot of social science saying that,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of these rules that Democrats and Republicans are really focused on</p>
<p>around the convenience of the election don&rsquo;t really influence the number of people who vote.</p>
<p>People who want to vote, vote.</p>
<p>People who don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re getting hung up on the wrong thing, which is, you know, these voter ID laws.</p>
<p>What really matters is the certification of the Electoral College.</p>
<p>And you could find, Biden could find, I think there&rsquo;s a number of Republicans</p>
<p>who would support a clarification of that law and updating of it so</p>
<p>that what potentially could have happened in, you know, in January,</p>
<p>if Pence had gone along with this plan to basically reject the accounting of the electors,</p>
<p>I mean, everyone understood that was just ceremonial, right?</p>
<p>What do you think of that plan?</p>
<p>What did you think of Trump&rsquo;s plan?</p>
<p>I think that Trump had a right to air his grievances in court.</p>
<p>But once the court threw out his claims and rejected them,</p>
<p>and once the Supreme Court denied certiorari, it was over.</p>
<p>It was over.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has the final word in our democracy about legal matters.</p>
<p>And so, no, Pence never had the authority or the ability</p>
<p>under the Electoral Count Act to reject the counting of the electors.</p>
<p>That whole process is ceremonial.</p>
<p>But the mere fact that this isn&rsquo;t even an issue suggests that we should fix it.</p>
<p>We should go back and fix the Electoral Count Act of 1887.</p>
<p>So, look, Biden could have gotten 60 votes for that.</p>
<p>You know, I think that was very doable.</p>
<p>He can get votes for that.</p>
<p>He can also get votes to stop the insider trading of members of Congress.</p>
<p>He could get that done too.</p>
<p>So why isn&rsquo;t he focused on things where he can actually get a bipartisan majority?</p>
<p>His one big legislative success as president has been the infrastructure</p>
<p>bill where he got a bunch of Republican support.</p>
<p>Which is a pretty big win, yeah.</p>
<p>Those are the types of issues he should be focused on.</p>
<p>And instead, he&rsquo;s giving these, you know, speeches, saying that anyone who disagrees</p>
<p>with the progressive agenda on voting rights is basically George Wallace or Bull Connor.</p>
<p>Did you guys hear his speech the other day on CNBC about COVID?</p>
<p>I mean, he was so incoherent.</p>
<p>It was kind of scary.</p>
<p>It feels like he&rsquo;s in cognitive, the cognitive decline is, you know, I voted for the guy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t need to get Trump out of office.</p>
<p>I thought that was an existential risk.</p>
<p>But man, he is cognitively declining quickly.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the craziest thing about COVID was this Rachel Walensky interview.</p>
<p>I mean, like, why does it take two years into a pandemic to tell us</p>
<p>what we kind of anecdotally knew?</p>
<p>But if we had known up front, or sooner, we would explain this.</p>
<p>Rachel Walensky does an interview.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the head of the CDC.</p>
<p>And she said, well, it turns out that 75% of all the deaths</p>
<p>because of COVID were people that suffered from at least four comorbidities, at least four,</p>
<p>not three, not two, not one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t all it was, I think it was a subset defined by it might have been like</p>
<p>vaccinated deaths or something like that.</p>
<p>It was it was one study.</p>
<p>But yes, that was basically the conclusion.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s significant comorbidities among people who died.</p>
<p>And so if we if we had known that, don&rsquo;t you think I mean, Friedberg, you tell me,</p>
<p>but wouldn&rsquo;t we have just changed our response to just mask and just kind of like start living</p>
<p>our normal lives and people with four comorbidities or people at a certain age or</p>
<p>immunocompromised should have stayed home.</p>
<p>And we would be in a very different situation.</p>
<p>So, you know, I mean, I understand, Jason, that Biden didn&rsquo;t the last few speeches have</p>
<p>been a little tight.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, I think, look, the Quinnipiac call poll, then Nick, you can post I mean,</p>
<p>look, his ratings are just plummeting, plummeting.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s down to Trump levels, right?</p>
<p>Every week.</p>
<p>And so he is definitely searching for a handful of wins.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s strategically found the right ones.</p>
<p>He could have done something on certifying the electoral college, he could certainly</p>
<p>do something right now on insider trading laws for members of Congress.</p>
<p>But instead, we&rsquo;re focusing on all these random things.</p>
<p>But anyway, so he can get the insider trading thing past Pelosi.</p>
<p>But but but but yeah, I think it is something that would get a huge bipartisan majority.</p>
<p>Look, she&rsquo;s gonna lose anyway.</p>
<p>So he might as well just throw under the bus.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>This is about his political salvation over hers.</p>
<p>By the way, you guys saw this.</p>
<p>I mentioned this in the group chat.</p>
<p>Someone floated the trial balloon of dumping Kamala Harris and replacing her with Liz Cheney.</p>
<p>This is how bad things have gotten for the Democrats.</p>
<p>I mean, we were trying to they floated a trial balloon of of Biden Cheney in 24</p>
<p>crossover ticket.</p>
<p>I we talked about this on the for a couple years in private and poker.</p>
<p>I thought I think a crossover ticket is what the country needs to kind of get back to center.</p>
<p>And I know it&rsquo;s a crazy concept, and it&rsquo;s a 1% chance.</p>
<p>But I, I kind of like the crossover.</p>
<p>But things have gotten so bad for the Democrats now that I sort of said sacks floated this</p>
<p>or pre floated it.</p>
<p>We had a little debate on the Twitter.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if you remember two or three episodes ago,</p>
<p>SAC said, Hey, listen, there&rsquo;s gonna be a new appreciation for Clinton.</p>
<p>And not 10 days later, the Wall Street Journal and a bunch of people are floating Hillary coming</p>
<p>back to run Bill Clinton, I didn&rsquo;t mention Hillary.</p>
<p>I know that.</p>
<p>But I think either you are in your star chamber and doing a pre float on all in.</p>
<p>So then the backups in the can then, you know,</p>
<p>pump Hillary as that, or it just people are listening to you and you&rsquo;re that influential.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m what I&rsquo;m proposing is a Biden engage in Clintonian,</p>
<p>by which I mean Bill Clinton Tony and triangulation,</p>
<p>which is he does not have the votes in Congress to enact a progressive agenda,</p>
<p>he should be looking for bipartisan wins.</p>
<p>He did with the infrastructure bill.</p>
<p>He could do with this insider trading thing.</p>
<p>He could do it on the Electoral Count Act.</p>
<p>These are things that would be, you know, progress.</p>
<p>Yeah, China policy and importantly, momentum, momentum going into 2020 24.</p>
<p>And maybe good for Americans.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, his China policy, the fact that he came out with a statement on the Uyghurs,</p>
<p>I thought was very strong.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s one of the stronger things he did, but it&rsquo;s not coming up in the polls.</p>
<p>And I think that whole Republicans interesting.</p>
<p>Nobody cares.</p>
<p>Nobody cares about what&rsquo;s happening to the Uyghurs.</p>
<p>Okay, you bring it up because you really care.</p>
<p>And I think what do you mean?</p>
<p>Nobody cares.</p>
<p>The rest of us don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just very hard.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying you personally don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you a very hard, ugly truth.</p>
<p>Okay, of all the things that I care about, yes, it is below my line.</p>
<p>Okay, of all the things that I care about, it is below my line.</p>
<p>Disappointing.</p>
<p>Well, we I think people if you if you explain to them what&rsquo;s happening to the Uyghurs in China,</p>
<p>they care, but it&rsquo;s not top of mind for them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not caring right now.</p>
<p>Go to the grocery store, and the shelves are empty.</p>
<p>Sure, that I care about.</p>
<p>Yeah, I care about the fact that our economy could turn on a dime.</p>
<p>If China invades Taiwan, I care about that.</p>
<p>I care about climate change.</p>
<p>You know, I care about a bunch of I care about America&rsquo;s crippling and, you know, decrepit</p>
<p>healthcare infrastructure.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re asking me, do I care about a segment of a class of people in another country,</p>
<p>not until we can take care of ourselves?</p>
<p>Will I prioritize them over us?</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people believe that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sorry if that&rsquo;s a hard truth to hear.</p>
<p>But every time I say that I care about the Uyghurs, I&rsquo;m really just lying if I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really care.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d rather not lie to you and tell you the truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a priority for me.</p>
<p>And my response to that is, I think it&rsquo;s a sad state of affairs when human rights as</p>
<p>a concept globally, you know, falls beneath, you know, tactical and strategic issues that</p>
<p>we have to have, we need to have another luxury belief.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another luxury belief.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe believing in the human declaration of human rights that Eleanor Roosevelt, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a luxury belief to believe that all humans should have a basic set of</p>
<p>human rights.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a luxury belief.</p>
<p>The reason I think it&rsquo;s a luxury belief is we don&rsquo;t do enough domestically to actually</p>
<p>express that view in real tangible ways.</p>
<p>So until we actually clean up our own house, the idea that we step outside of our borders</p>
<p>with, you know, with with us sort of like morally virtue signaling about somebody else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>human rights track record is deplorable.</p>
<p>Look at the number of black and brown men that are far from deplorable.</p>
<p>Look at the number of black and brown men that are incarcerated for for absolutely ridiculous</p>
<p>crimes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this past week, but there was a person that was released from</p>
<p>jail because he couldn&rsquo;t even be protected in jail because in some of these cells, they</p>
<p>run these fight clubs inside of Rikers Island that are basically tacitly endorsed by the</p>
<p>corrections officers that don&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>And the difference so hold on Jason.</p>
<p>So if you want to talk about the human rights of people, I think we have a responsibility</p>
<p>to take care of our own backyard first, first, and then we can go and basically morally tell</p>
<p>other people how they should be running their own countries.</p>
<p>The difference is Chamath saying what you just said in China or Saudi Arabia would put</p>
<p>you in jail and get you 100 lashes and you would be tortured for a decade.</p>
<p>We here in the United States are far from perfect.</p>
<p>We still have the death penalty, which is against the United Declaration of Human Rights,</p>
<p>which we signed, which Eleanor Roosevelt created in the UN.</p>
<p>And we propagated as Americans around the world, we started that Chamath.</p>
<p>And we can have these discussions about being better in this country.</p>
<p>And the what about ism that you&rsquo;re proposing is so disproportional to the equivalent of</p>
<p>the Holocaust going on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a million Uyghurs in concentration camps right now to talk about what we have</p>
<p>here that we need to fix and compare it to that, or to Saudi Arabia, whipping bloggers</p>
<p>and throwing gay people off roofs for being gay.</p>
<p>The these two things are not morally comparable.</p>
<p>They are very far and we need to have open discussions and talk about human rights all</p>
<p>the time.</p>
<p>Because if we do not talk about it all the time, then your position, which is I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have time for that I want to solve my problems, then gives the green light to dictators everywhere</p>
<p>that nobody&rsquo;s watching.</p>
<p>Vigilance and that and that&rsquo;s what I find.</p>
<p>And I think we hold on a second.</p>
<p>Your position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I said.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>You said you can&rsquo;t get up for it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So tell me how are you?</p>
<p>Are you saying that the situation with the Uyghurs is the same as the Holocaust?</p>
<p>People who are Jewish are making that comparison.</p>
<p>You never know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking you, I think there are upwards of a million people in a concentration camp</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>This is getting to numbers that are actually comparable.</p>
<p>It is actually a valid comparison.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying there are a million people in a concentration camp.</p>
<p>That is the numbers that human rights organizations are saying between 300,000 and a million people</p>
<p>are incarcerated right now being tortured, raped, and in doing forced sterilization,</p>
<p>reeducation, and when they&rsquo;re released are being tracked in ghettos.</p>
<p>And so Jewish people are bringing this up.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Are you saying as a comparison?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying the entire world has basically decided that that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You just said you can&rsquo;t get up for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about you specifically.</p>
<p>Who is getting up?</p>
<p>Well, who is getting up for it?</p>
<p>I am very up on it.</p>
<p>I talk about it all the time every week.</p>
<p>What about the US government?</p>
<p>What are they doing about it?</p>
<p>The Biden just said we are going to do a ban, and we are going to sanction companies that</p>
<p>do business in that region.</p>
<p>So Apple and Tesla?</p>
<p>I think there will be increased pressure on all companies that are engaging in China over</p>
<p>human rights.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s goods that are sourced from those areas, right?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not doing business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s if your supply chain comes from that area.</p>
<p>So kind of like we won&rsquo;t we won&rsquo;t buy Nazi goods, but we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;ll sell our iPhones into</p>
<p>Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Well, if you want to have a discussion about this, you know, it&rsquo;s how do we disengage from</p>
<p>China?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had this discussion here.</p>
<p>How what amount of time will it take to disengage from countries that have brutal</p>
<p>dictatorships that are committing human rights atrocities?</p>
<p>My look, look, I think I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time and money actually trying to fortify</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s supply chain.</p>
<p>You guys know about some of the things that I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing that from a moral perspective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing that from a practical capitalist perspective.</p>
<p>I think the jobs are better served for Americans.</p>
<p>And I think that we should have the ability to build our own businesses, just like China</p>
<p>has the right to do for themselves, without the risk of these things being undercut by</p>
<p>policies that we don&rsquo;t understand, which is effectively what you do when you outsource</p>
<p>your supply chain to countries where you&rsquo;re not 100% aligned with them.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they&rsquo;re dictatorships.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not even sure that that China is a dictatorship the way that you want</p>
<p>to call it that.</p>
<p>Again, I think country that&rsquo;s in the name.</p>
<p>Look, you have to understand, Jason, there are a set of checks and balances here on China</p>
<p>that, you know, at the end of the day, I don&rsquo;t think that I have the moral absolutism to</p>
<p>judge China.</p>
<p>And I would say that when NATO is silent, the United Nations is silent, all of Western</p>
<p>Europe is silent, and America&rsquo;s effectively silent, that this issue may be smaller than</p>
<p>small data points being extrapolated in a way to create a narrative that may be not</p>
<p>be true.</p>
<p>And if it is true, Jason, there is a responsibility for those body politics to do something because</p>
<p>that is the early warning signal that the rest of the world uses to say, Okay, hold</p>
<p>on, let me reprioritize my list of things.</p>
<p>So I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is, I am not going to be an armchair journalist on this topic,</p>
<p>nor am I going to be the armchair human rights advocate for the world, because I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, I can focus on the things that I know about, build the things that I know about.</p>
<p>And if something really does get red light status, then other parties will do something.</p>
<p>And again, I just want to be clear, NATO is silent, United Nations is silent, America</p>
<p>is silent, a press release doesn&rsquo;t change the actual technical posture on these topics.</p>
<p>Okay, if that if your position is that human rights matters to you, if government large</p>
<p>government organizations or politicians give you the green light to care about it, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fine.</p>
<p>I care about it intrinsically every day.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine with you doing that.</p>
<p>I thought there was a segue there talking about the Ray Dalio thing that Freiburg cares</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>I mean, this is, I mean, this debate that you&rsquo;re having between kind of realism and</p>
<p>idealism and foreign policy is sort of what Dalio tackles, right, Freiburg?</p>
<p>Look, I mean, it sounds to me like there&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s just say a red herring.</p>
<p>There always needs to be, as Chamath points out, a narrative on framing our enemy when,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re running out of land.</p>
<p>I mean, you guys saw this, was it a journal article or New York Times article that came</p>
<p>out today that US intelligence revealed that Putin had actually put some actors into the</p>
<p>eastern Ukraine to set up for a reason to have a response and therefore an excuse to</p>
<p>invade the Ukraine.</p>
<p>So he was trying to create a bit of a fireworks show to give him an excuse.</p>
<p>We always need a narrative that we can sell to our citizens.</p>
<p>And so, you know, there&rsquo;s not going to be a lot of, you know, patting on the back of</p>
<p>China right now.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve talked about, there is this, you know, overarching multi-hundred year economic</p>
<p>cycle, you know, call it geopolitical cycle that the United States and China are about</p>
<p>to clash on.</p>
<p>And in order for them to clash effectively, we need to get the narrative right, which</p>
<p>is to paint them as the bad guy and to make things evil.</p>
<p>And look, I mean, you may take your ethical framework and say that they are bad.</p>
<p>And you may be able to take other parts of your ethical framework and looking objectively,</p>
<p>call some countries that you consider good, bad as well, depending on what story you want</p>
<p>to tell yourself and what story you want to be told.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on and will continue to go on for a long period of time.</p>
<p>And this Uyghur thing, as Chamath pointed out, how do you measure on an absolute basis</p>
<p>human rights?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s a way to do so.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s one person getting tortured publicly in a street, or 100,000 people being</p>
<p>suppressed economically and not being able to get jobs, it&rsquo;s hard to say what is appropriate,</p>
<p>what is not, what is evil, what is not.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we create narratives and that narrative allows the bigger picture</p>
<p>to kind of play itself out.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on largely.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to hear a lot of good news about China for the next decade</p>
<p>from any politician in the United States or anyone that wants to defend our political</p>
<p>and economic interests globally, which are certainly being challenged by China right now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my diatribe about the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>Look, the Dalai Lama obviously does a great job of kind of simplifying and eloquently</p>
<p>stating what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>But I think this is one of many, many manifestations of it.</p>
<p>You need only read what the UN Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,</p>
<p>the Guardian, the New York Times, you know, this is not up for question.</p>
<p>Why do you think you&rsquo;re so wound up about this?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not wound up about what&rsquo;s going on in Somalia?</p>
<p>Oh, no, you&rsquo;re not wound up about what&rsquo;s going on in Saudi Arabia,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not wound up about what&rsquo;s going on in eastern Ukraine?</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>There are human rights violations all over the world.</p>
<p>I commented on them.</p>
<p>And I have commented on them for decades since I worked at Amnesty International,</p>
<p>Amnesty International, which is where I started my career.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been passionate about this since the age of 18 or 19.</p>
<p>When I worked at Amnesty International, you said that you cannot grade these things,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You just said, like, it&rsquo;s hard to compare these things.</p>
<p>And this is a problem.</p>
<p>Like, you can actually do that.</p>
<p>There are human rights violations, like freedom of speech, which, you know, is a great aspiration.</p>
<p>But we would say torture, murder, systematic rape, and sterilization are more intense and</p>
<p>horrific than just freedom of speech.</p>
<p>So if you look at Hong Kong, when they shut down Apple News, that&rsquo;s one level of human</p>
<p>rights, right?</p>
<p>People have lost their ability.</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;re telling hundreds of these are not stories.</p>
<p>These are facts.</p>
<p>Apple News was shut down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re telling a fact about a particular a particular set of experiences that are particularly</p>
<p>harming a set of people.</p>
<p>Let me give you another fact.</p>
<p>In the United States, where we have a population of let&rsquo;s be generous and say 400 million people,</p>
<p>2.3 million or 40 million 340 million Americans, 2.3 million of whom are incarcerated.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>In China, with a population of 1.4 billion, 1.7 million Chinese are incarcerated.</p>
<p>Absolutely something we have to do.</p>
<p>Where is human rights being violated on an absolute basis?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very difficult conversation to use facts and figures.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day, there&rsquo;s a lot of data that can be pointed the other way.</p>
<p>And so it all comes down to narrative.</p>
<p>And that narrative always has an objective, which is what are you trying to get people</p>
<p>to believe?</p>
<p>And what are you trying to get them to get behind and get to do?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And what are you trying to justify?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the tree where they don&rsquo;t have a drug problem over there, because they killed all</p>
<p>the drug dealers, Mal put him up against the wall and shot him.</p>
<p>So, you know, they just said they&rsquo;re fentanyl here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair enough.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just saying like, look, and it&rsquo;s a very good point, which is you can actually</p>
<p>take the data and you can slice it and tell different stories around it.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s very hard to say there&rsquo;s good and there&rsquo;s evil that</p>
<p>we have to go and attack.</p>
<p>And that is what is I never said attack.</p>
<p>I never said attack.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say invade China over this.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t say invade Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>I think we should talk about the temperature.</p>
<p>Raise the temperature.</p>
<p>No, I did not say that either.</p>
<p>If you want to know what I think should happen, political pressure on that, right?</p>
<p>I think when people are involved in torture, murder, rape, and sterilizing people, that</p>
<p>there should be economic and disengagement that occurs as a first step.</p>
<p>And that that is why when people in our circles in venture capital, take money from somebody</p>
<p>who murdered a journalist, Mohammed bin Salim, MBS from Saudi Arabia, we should disengage</p>
<p>from a country like that.</p>
<p>I believe that that is what we should do.</p>
<p>And I believe like us, I believe people like us who are capital allocators and creators</p>
<p>and who are influencers should be talking about human rights all the time.</p>
<p>And we should be familiar with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and we should</p>
<p>read what&rsquo;s in it.</p>
<p>And we should aspire to hit those notes in our country and everywhere else.</p>
<p>And this me too ism, I&rsquo;m sorry, this, you know, equivalency problem that you guys keep</p>
<p>bringing up.</p>
<p>That is a trap.</p>
<p>That is an intellectual trap.</p>
<p>Because there is no equivalency from putting a detaining a million people, putting hundreds</p>
<p>of 1000s of them and torturing them to what&rsquo;s happening in the United States where we wrote</p>
<p>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and where we can have conversations about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>If you try to have the conversation we are having here with you, we would all be tortured</p>
<p>in Saudi Arabia, we would all be tortured and detained inside of China.</p>
<p>I just think that there&rsquo;s a very dangerous thing that you&rsquo;re doing, which is you are</p>
<p>ranking, and which is essentially assigning some sort of let&rsquo;s just call it economic value</p>
<p>to those things that you just just described torture, rape for sterilization.</p>
<p>But I think then you&rsquo;re ignoring how do you actually economically rank systemic racism</p>
<p>in the United States?</p>
<p>What happens in our inner school system, inner city school system?</p>
<p>What happens to black and brown men?</p>
<p>What happens to the families of those people?</p>
<p>What happens to how the lobbies basically break down the healthcare system?</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is, Jason, if you take your argument to the extreme, you start to get</p>
<p>into all these areas of gray, where it&rsquo;s impossible to assign economic realities to those things</p>
<p>so that you can actually rank and rate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I do economic.</p>
<p>Yeah, because what we&rsquo;re talking about, you&rsquo;re numerically ranking these things.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I never use a numeric.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying one is proportionally different.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not putting economic I never use the term proportion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really bad things happen 10 times.</p>
<p>And these kind of bad things happen 1010 1000 times, which one&rsquo;s worse?</p>
<p>I think if you asked anybody who is in a Uyghur prison being sterilized,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking you if they would rather be Yes, I mean, you could do this test.</p>
<p>Jason, I&rsquo;m asking you a question.</p>
<p>If 10 people 10 Uyghurs were raped or forced sterilized?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Versus 10 million black men falsely incarcerated, which one is worse?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is not the way to do the calculus.</p>
<p>You can do it on an individual basis, you can look at an individual inside of a prison being</p>
<p>tortured and an individual living in the United States, every single person who is inside of that</p>
<p>torture chamber, being raped, being sterilized would say I would absolutely love to come to</p>
<p>America.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why everybody wants to come to this country and live in a free democracy where</p>
<p>they can speak freely.</p>
<p>They can practice whatever religion they want and not be tortured.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re doing by adding up all the tiny pain and suffering that we have here in America,</p>
<p>and then, you know, trying to conflate that with these horrific acts, you have to look at</p>
<p>exactly how horrific these are on an individual basis, just like we did with George Floyd,</p>
<p>we see George Floyd happen.</p>
<p>That is something that is absolutely worth being outraged about at a higher level,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You have to stop for a second and say, Oh, my God, this has to be resolved.</p>
<p>We can do these two things at the same time.</p>
<p>We can refine our education system, George Floyd,</p>
<p>the Uyghurs being sterilized.</p>
<p>I think George Floyd proves my point, because there&rsquo;s been innumerable number of black men</p>
<p>that have been murdered with nary a thing that&rsquo;s ever happened in the United States.</p>
<p>But it happened in an exact moment, where the sum of all of these other things that</p>
<p>happened before, had just compounded to a point where the whole thing spilled over.</p>
<p>And enough people decided to basically say the sum total of this damage.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now is the equivalent of a very meaningful human rights violation.</p>
<p>You can work on both these things at the same time is my point.</p>
<p>And this and this, you&rsquo;re basically giving a pass by by kind of conflating these two</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>In my mind, you can work on both these issues, you could want to stop abhorrent torture,</p>
<p>and murder and rape, while wanting to make our justice system better while wanting to</p>
<p>make our education system better.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to pick one trim off.</p>
<p>I think you do, actually.</p>
<p>No, you do not.</p>
<p>We could absolutely create nothing I can do about the Uyghurs in China.</p>
<p>Absolutely, there is you could not capital allocate to regions or to companies that are</p>
<p>engaged.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t have any shing shanties.</p>
<p>Okay, perfect.</p>
<p>And if you do see one, you could do that.</p>
<p>And you could also speak up because they can&rsquo;t get out of China.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Do you take money from Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p>No, I made a more and did you make a moral decision about that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, if you did get offered a billion dollars, would you take it from them?</p>
<p>And by the way, to be honest, there&rsquo;s a bunch of my companies that have been supported by</p>
<p>folks who have taken money from them.</p>
<p>And I know, that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>When I look what?</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s the bigger problem?</p>
<p>Is it that the solution that these guys are, that they&rsquo;re designing for mental health or</p>
<p>diabetes or, you know, housing or whatever it is this startup does when they take money</p>
<p>from SoftBank or whoever, all of a sudden, they should be cancelled and not be able to</p>
<p>do that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say cancel, just take the money from somebody different.</p>
<p>Nobody said cancelled.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, KOTU, pick another firm, Goldman.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who doesn&rsquo;t take Saudi money.</p>
<p>So should the should the United States create a program where whenever you get a way you</p>
<p>ever get a term sheet from SoftBank or anybody with money from</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>If you should just be able to go and redeem it for some somebody else&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>I never said that either.</p>
<p>I think each individual, a capital allocator like yourself and a CEO should make what they</p>
<p>believe is a morally right decision.</p>
<p>Well, they voted and they don&rsquo;t care about this issue.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re voting with their dollars every day.</p>
<p>That people should care about human rights, and they should care about who they make money</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m a lone voice.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m a lone voice.</p>
<p>But I believe you should care about.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I&rsquo;m not saying Jason, I&rsquo;m just saying something very subtle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that what you believe is wrong.</p>
<p>In fact, I think it&rsquo;s beautiful and wholeheartedly right.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is when everybody else tries to nod their head and agree with you in the</p>
<p>moment, they&rsquo;re just moral leave virtue signaling in a luxury of belief that they themselves</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t exhibit, they don&rsquo;t make any changes towards and it&rsquo;s largely because they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe that this is an issue and I&rsquo;m just putting it on the table as it just is true</p>
<p>based on everybody&rsquo;s behavior, maybe other than you.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>But everybody else is voting.</p>
<p>I would like to change everybody&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>And I think you can offer your opinion.</p>
<p>And maybe you will change some people&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are some people listening here.</p>
<p>And I know there are some founders who would not take money from SoftBank and would not</p>
<p>take money from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>And I know there are some capital allocators will not take money from dictatorships.</p>
<p>I think that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re also forgetting that there&rsquo;s there has been as it seems again,</p>
<p>from very, very far away looking in a lot of things that they have been able to do that</p>
<p>is really constructive.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;ve actually created some pretty decent ties to Israel.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve actually started to create a path to normalize normalized relations in the Middle</p>
<p>East.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;ve organized against what could be the real threat there, which is,</p>
<p>you know, a nuclear empowered Iran.</p>
<p>So just to put things in perspective, Jason, it&rsquo;s kind of like you have to look at the</p>
<p>totality of the situation again, in the United States today, if you just looked at that one</p>
<p>simple thing, you can cherry pick all kinds of reasons why many other companies shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>expect shouldn&rsquo;t accept American capital.</p>
<p>Because, you know, we don&rsquo;t really exactly have our shit together, right?</p>
<p>Proportion of these issues is the</p>
<p>I think I think what what Samantha is saying is the world, the world is complicated.</p>
<p>I mean, we had so under the previous president, they said there could never be like a peace</p>
<p>in the Middle East or a deal between Israel and Arab powers.</p>
<p>And there was the Doha agreement where you had three Arab states signing peace treaties</p>
<p>with Israel, and Saudi Arabia allowing flights between Saudi Arabia and Israel for the first</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all because of MBS.</p>
<p>And there was an article in The Wall Street Journal talking about how King Salman actually</p>
<p>was holding MBS back on this because, you know, he&rsquo;s part of the previous generation</p>
<p>who was backing the Palestinians.</p>
<p>And MBS just wants to move forward and actually get a deal done with Israel.</p>
<p>And if the Palestinians won&rsquo;t make it, then he&rsquo;s willing to move forward without them.</p>
<p>And this is not me saying this, this is The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We need to dig up that piece.</p>
<p>So all I&rsquo;m saying, look, what happened with that journalist was absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>But clearly, like, foreign relations is very complicated, especially in the Middle East.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not clear that like net net Saudi Arabia probably just did the one wrong thing,</p>
<p>which is that every country engages in extra judicial killings, they just got caught.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to say also torture.</p>
<p>They also killed a journalist.</p>
<p>I think that Americans have done that.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ve done that as well as journalists.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you actually have any idea the extent of what we have done</p>
<p>during the course of these wars in all of these countries.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you know.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think I know.</p>
<p>So by saying, and I think you&rsquo;re basically saying nobody knows if we</p>
<p>chopped up a journalist who criticized Do you know who was in Algrave?</p>
<p>Abu Ghraib?</p>
<p>Do you really know?</p>
<p>Do you know of all the other the worst one of the worst things we ever did?</p>
<p>And one of the things we need to aspire to do better.</p>
<p>My brain is that we&rsquo;ve gone blood around the Middle East for 20 years now in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>We supported warlords in Afghanistan who were allies with</p>
<p>who were raping young boys.</p>
<p>I mean, this was like a giant series of articles in the New York Times.</p>
<p>Oliver North Iran Contra.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve been doing this since the 80s.</p>
<p>But even more recently in Libya, we basically got rid of Gaddafi and</p>
<p>plunged that whole country into civil war, and it&rsquo;s never recovered from it.</p>
<p>So look, I actually Jason, I&rsquo;m somewhere in between.</p>
<p>I actually agree with your idealism.</p>
<p>My mind&rsquo;s still blown that you actually work for AMC International.</p>
<p>But I just think that the world is more complicated than that.</p>
<p>And sometimes we have to make choices.</p>
<p>And the thing that concerns me is that that idealism that you&rsquo;re citing has become a</p>
<p>prelude and a pretext for war in the over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>And we can to be clear, I&rsquo;m not advocating we go around the globe,</p>
<p>getting into these conflicts, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, you know,</p>
<p>what good has that done us?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m anti war, you know, I&rsquo;m anti war.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not advocating for invading places.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m advocating that we speak up.</p>
<p>When we see Saudi Arabia, take a blogger, Rafi Badawi.</p>
<p>Everybody did.</p>
<p>I mean, that was universally condemned.</p>
<p>But but the question is, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>for writing blog posts,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the alternative in Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s our alternative there?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get to pick and choose who the leaders of these countries are.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that doesn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m talking specifically about entrepreneurs,</p>
<p>capital allocators, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we need to engage in business and building their chip stack.</p>
<p>If you want the sternly worded press release, you just got it from Biden to hopefully it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it peaks, it satisfies it quenches your thirst, because the only other solution</p>
<p>us talking about actually, if you want to know what I want, I want to see the three of you speak</p>
<p>up for human rights.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would like to say.</p>
<p>I think that human rights in the United States is way more important to me than human rights</p>
<p>anywhere else in the globe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I think that we have an abysmal track record of taking care of colored men and women in this</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree.</p>
<p>And so I have zero patience and tolerance for white men blathering on about shit that happens</p>
<p>outside your own backyard.</p>
<p>Fix your own inside backyard.</p>
<p>Because you guys human rights here as well on because you guys are the ones that get to</p>
<p>diminish me for being white.</p>
<p>No, I understand.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying that you are uniquely in a position of power in a way that the rest of us are not.</p>
<p>And so when you guys clean up the inside, then we can go and fix the outside.</p>
<p>Yeah, I believe we can do both.</p>
<p>I believe we can do the same thing.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can speak about human rights here.</p>
<p>We can speak about it in Saudi Arabia, we can speak about in China.</p>
<p>And we can talk about the same thing.</p>
<p>We can talk about all the human right issues from freedom of speech to murder.</p>
<p>I do I do constantly.</p>
<p>You care so much about journalists.</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t you spoken up in favor of Sonia songs the way that Glenn Greenwald has of</p>
<p>Julian Assange, Assange and Snowden read Glenn Greenwald&rsquo;s reporting on these topics that we</p>
<p>need to get to the bottom of both of those in either case, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve acted with complete certainty on Twitter saying that these guys are traitors,</p>
<p>and should be locked up in US prisons.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, I think we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we know who they&rsquo;re working for.</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t you spent the time to learn?</p>
<p>No, well, I mean, it is a black box.</p>
<p>In that case, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>In both of those cases, what the backstory is, I do think I do have a</p>
<p>you know about what&rsquo;s going on with the Uyghurs because you read a New York Times article.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t you read the New York Times article about Snowden?</p>
<p>We have had people who have we have we have people who have defected</p>
<p>and been on 60 minutes who were in those prisons,</p>
<p>you believe what you want to believe?</p>
<p>No, you literally can believe somebody who escaped from the prison.</p>
<p>You can believe them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>With when it comes to Julian Assange, I don&rsquo;t know what to believe exactly because</p>
<p>he released all those data dumps.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t do it properly like a journalist where he vetted the information with Snowden.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more inclined to think that he was a good actor.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a very nuanced position.</p>
<p>So if you want to try to paint me as like not knowing everything about every human rights</p>
<p>violation in the world, every nuanced position of a leaker.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know everything about everybody.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m going to take that position.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about any of these things, which is why I choose to focus on the things</p>
<p>that I can control.</p>
<p>And I want to believe that I want to improve my own backyard,</p>
<p>which I think is absolutely great.</p>
<p>And I think you can add an end there, which is you should be talking about human rights</p>
<p>and Hong Kong should be talking about it.</p>
<p>Okay, not my problem is the problem.</p>
<p>Not my problem.</p>
<p>I believe that&rsquo;s part of the problem right now.</p>
<p>You said it, you said it perfectly, Chamath.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t care about human rights anymore.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a large group of people I agree with you who do not care about human rights the</p>
<p>way I think they care about the local version of human rights.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think you need to care about all of them and talk about all of them at the same time</p>
<p>international adventurism around human rights.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t support in the least.</p>
<p>And I do feel that a lot of this stuff is like the tip of the spear of people who then</p>
<p>get morally absolute and say, we have to fix this.</p>
<p>And the only solution is to invade these countries.</p>
<p>And instead, I would just rather them if they really care about it, let them stand up and</p>
<p>do what they need to do.</p>
<p>I think we need to fix our own backyard.</p>
<p>I mean, look, not to kind of bolster Chamath&rsquo;s point, but there is a blind eye turned to</p>
<p>that which we don&rsquo;t want to believe or that narrative which we don&rsquo;t want to sell.</p>
<p>And then we point towards the narrative that we do.</p>
<p>And we see this all the time, where the focal point of where should we be addressing human</p>
<p>rights issues is where we have economic and geopolitical interest.</p>
<p>No one seems to be solving the problem in Somalia.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s getting on stage talking about the issues that people are facing in countries</p>
<p>outside of where we have deep rooted trade partnerships, and serious economic interest.</p>
<p>And so, you know, like, we can tell ourselves all day long that we need to be kind of the</p>
<p>absolutists, and absolutely take care of the world because we&rsquo;re the beacon for human</p>
<p>rights.</p>
<p>But the challenge is we end up being forced to choose where we want to spend our time</p>
<p>and our resources, and our resources go to where those resources flow back to us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s often where we have a geopolitical and economic interest.</p>
<p>Now, Jason, I&rsquo;ll say one more thing, like, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s important, J Cal, because</p>
<p>you called us all out.</p>
<p>I am an absolute human rightist, in the sense that I believe every human on Earth should</p>
<p>have a right to do whatever they want within their own sphere of influence, provided their</p>
<p>sphere of influence does not intersect with the sphere of influence of others.</p>
<p>End of story.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see that happening anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>And this ends up being a trade off, you always end up trading off your sphere of influence</p>
<p>for that of the greater good or someone else, because power allocates and power aggregates</p>
<p>to specific places, often to government, sometimes to organize societal decisions that</p>
<p>we say we&rsquo;re going to trade off our individual rights and freedoms for that of the greater</p>
<p>collective.</p>
<p>And it is that judgment, and it is that gray area, where all of these issues that we individually</p>
<p>choose to address and spend our time on arise.</p>
<p>And so I have, you know, just to point out, like, a very absolute point of view on this.</p>
<p>But to me, the challenge is, how do you make a discernment?</p>
<p>How do you make a determination that imprisonment of brown and black people in the United</p>
<p>States versus the treatment of people by militia in Somalia versus the treatment of</p>
<p>the Uyghurs in China versus, you know, and you go on and on and on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very difficult moral judgment.</p>
<p>Or you could just say they&rsquo;re all wrong.</p>
<p>They are all wrong.</p>
<p>They are all wrong.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t care about the other two.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>See, but you work on all of them, you work on none of them.</p>
<p>And I would rather see innovation, enable more people to have access to more free speech,</p>
<p>to have more resources to have more of an ability to climb and have the freedom to do</p>
<p>the things they want to do with their life.</p>
<p>I think that innovation and technology can bring all of these old school ways of thinking</p>
<p>and behaving out of the medieval ages and the dark ages.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where I choose to spend my time.</p>
<p>You know, how can we unleash people&rsquo;s freedom?</p>
<p>We got to make things more available.</p>
<p>We got to make things more accessible.</p>
<p>I just want to make two points.</p>
<p>And then maybe we can move on on this topic.</p>
<p>Point number one is when you&rsquo;re an immigrant, part of what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>voting against the place that you leave to embrace the place that you come to.</p>
<p>And Jason, you know, of all the four of us on this pod, you&rsquo;re the only natural born American,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You started here, you&rsquo;ve lived your entire life here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an incredible blessing that you were given.</p>
<p>And the three of us weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And, you know, in my case, I had to go through an even more circuitous path.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even come to the United States.</p>
<p>First, I had to go through Canada.</p>
<p>But implicitly, you know, when I look at the places that I left, and specifically, you know,</p>
<p>when I look about when I look at Sri Lanka, who, you know, has a very checkered human rights</p>
<p>record, in fact, terrible in some ways, and the way that they ended the war against the</p>
<p>Tamils, atrocious.</p>
<p>I have to make a decision, right?</p>
<p>I have to make a decision about is this something that I&rsquo;m going to wade into or not.</p>
<p>And what I realized through my own life&rsquo;s journey is these are not my battles.</p>
<p>And in many ways, I abdicated my responsibility to vote on that issue when I left.</p>
<p>And instead, I stay here and I focus on the things that I can control here.</p>
<p>And I think that I do have a responsibility to fix the issues of the country that adopted me.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where some of my framework comes from.</p>
<p>Separately, I do want to give all three of us a shout out because I do think that there is</p>
<p>an enormous human rights issue that I do think we did bring up.</p>
<p>And in the last few weeks has become a real groundswell.</p>
<p>And it started on the, you know, year and recap pod where we talked about what&rsquo;s happened to</p>
<p>our kids.</p>
<p>And I just want to call out that in the last few weeks, the amount of press attention that</p>
<p>this issue has gotten, which I do think is a human rights level issue, which is a cognitive</p>
<p>impairment of our children has really come front and center.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s really, really incredible all the way to like, even nature now,</p>
<p>publishing these, you know, and maybe the timing is just coincidental.</p>
<p>But these big longitudinal studies that really show that, you know, we have</p>
<p>driven a level of retardation in our children, we have held them back from a level of learning</p>
<p>and development that we now have thrown our arms up in the air, we don&rsquo;t know what the</p>
<p>real long term impact is.</p>
<p>That I think is a human rights level issue.</p>
<p>And domestically in the United States, I think we&rsquo;re in a position to fix it if we decide to</p>
<p>take care of it.</p>
<p>So, you know, again, I don&rsquo;t mean to offend you when I say that in my prioritization list,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s below the line.</p>
<p>But there are different human rights issues that I care about.</p>
<p>And I think to just to be clear, I know, you know, when you said I called everybody out</p>
<p>here, I&rsquo;m trying to have a productive discussion.</p>
<p>Freeberg, I&rsquo;m not trying to put him in a spot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get offended.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to have a discourse.</p>
<p>But I want to make it clear that I&rsquo;m not trying to call out besties here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to have a productive dialogue.</p>
<p>You take my friend Prince all the weed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like one of the largest investors in the world.</p>
<p>You know, I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s a Saudi.</p>
<p>And so if they&rsquo;re just a citizen of Saudi Arabia, you wouldn&rsquo;t if the money comes from</p>
<p>a dictatorship from an authoritarian country, I would 100% he was locked up.</p>
<p>He was locked up at the Ritz.</p>
<p>And he was forced to give a bunch of his money.</p>
<p>And so it was mostly live out of the country.</p>
<p>Anyway, I mean, like, again, if his money, if you&rsquo;re asking me, let&rsquo;s put it inside of</p>
<p>a specific person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you my my citizen or a former citizen of that country.</p>
<p>He was born there.</p>
<p>JTOW.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>Let me just tell you, I, clearly, I would never take money from an authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>Would you take money from a Chinese billionaire?</p>
<p>No, I would not take it from a Chinese.</p>
<p>No, I would not take it from a Chinese if I if I learned on authoritarian regime, they</p>
<p>they Chinese are not an authoritarian.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a Chinese billionaire.</p>
<p>If the Chinese billionaire was outspoken about human, I would tell you, it&rsquo;s a great thought</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just riffing here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great thought experiment.</p>
<p>If a Chinese billionaire had left China and was</p>
<p>Would you take Chamath&rsquo;s money?</p>
<p>Because Chamath has violated your human rights at the poker table many times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>He has.</p>
<p>He has turned number 27 going all in when I have two pair.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I guess he&rsquo;s got a set.</p>
<p>And he just absolutely tortures me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So but no, I would not.</p>
<p>I would if the person was a reformer.</p>
<p>Yes, I would consider it.</p>
<p>I would consider it.</p>
<p>Jason, but Jason, I guess what you&rsquo;re saying is like you and this is your decision to</p>
<p>make my decision.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s important for you that you understand what people&rsquo;s personal belief systems are.</p>
<p>When you take money from them.</p>
<p>No human rights is important to me.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something like their personal belief system.</p>
<p>Like, you know, you would care less if they were an illicit drug user, right for somebody</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>So for example, I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>So I did take money from a Chinese billionaire when I when I first started social capital.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say who it is.</p>
<p>Nope, no need.</p>
<p>But there was a morality clause.</p>
<p>And there were certain things that were incredibly important to this person.</p>
<p>And they were very easy for me to reflect because they were nothing that I cared about.</p>
<p>But you know, they explicitly didn&rsquo;t want certain kinds of investments in</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s gambling, cannabis, sex, porn,</p>
<p>for me, yeah, the list was gambling, alcohol, can anyone my point is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fine signing up to those moral judgments from an investor.</p>
<p>Am I but not necessarily, you know, silence on I&rsquo;m asking you the question,</p>
<p>you will be fine signing up for those moral obligate for moral delineation of</p>
<p>what you can and can&rsquo;t do, even if it&rsquo;s not against what you believe.</p>
<p>But you have a different issue when it comes to silence on these other topics.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s, here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ll answer the question.</p>
<p>I, if I&rsquo;m taking other people&rsquo;s money to invest it, and they don&rsquo;t want to invest in the adult,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with cannabis.</p>
<p>As an example, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with wagering and gambling.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m building a fund to invest in businesses,</p>
<p>those are that that&rsquo;s not an important issue for me.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s a great venture investment.</p>
<p>And I can also invest outside of it, my own money.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a more nuanced issue there.</p>
<p>Like I have invested in wagering apps.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking about creating a syndicate specifically for gambling and wagering.</p>
<p>And yes, there are LPs who I currently have in my previous fund,</p>
<p>the active fund that do not I do not invest in wagering because of that.</p>
<p>So yes, and it&rsquo;s because they just want clarity in some cases on</p>
<p>not getting sued for investing in a in a in a wagering companies,</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t have a federal mandate yet.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think comparing it&rsquo;s these are great thought experiments.</p>
<p>And I was fine signing out everything for me,</p>
<p>I was fine signing up for no alcohol because my father was an alcoholic.</p>
<p>And so it was it was it was aligned.</p>
<p>And there was a certain investor who</p>
<p>at one point tried to be an LP very well known person who was convicted of</p>
<p>domestic abuse.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t take that money because I was I had been the victim of</p>
<p>domestic abuse as my as my mom.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so that was a moral issue for me.</p>
<p>The point I&rsquo;m trying to make to Jason is that it&rsquo;s very nuanced.</p>
<p>Everybody can be on a bunch of different sides of this thing.</p>
<p>And I tend to think the most consistent,</p>
<p>reliable thing is that these are very local beliefs.</p>
<p>That when they touch you, you have a point of view on them.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, it&rsquo;s much more practical.</p>
<p>And maybe this is just being too practical.</p>
<p>To see a world where people want to fix their own backyard first.</p>
<p>And the and I think a lot of why you may be disappointed that a lot of people don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a stronger view on things like China as people are a little exhausted with having moral views</p>
<p>about things that are so far away, when things in their own backyard are so broken.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I can understand that exhaustion.</p>
<p>And to be clear, I just feel like human rights is such an obvious and easy one to get behind.</p>
<p>For all humans.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was about was we were hoping that</p>
<p>all countries in the United Nations or Eleanor Roosevelt was that we could all just agree that</p>
<p>torture was immoral.</p>
<p>And when the United States, waterboarding,</p>
<p>whether the death penalty is immoral, so and you know what, that&rsquo;s something that,</p>
<p>you know, is our great failing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re riddled with hypocrisy.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Human Rights here is is an ideal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a goal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something to strive towards.</p>
<p>And each country has places where they succeed and fail.</p>
<p>And you can actually measure it.</p>
<p>And we do measure it.</p>
<p>Actually, we do measure which countries have the worst record on human rights violations,</p>
<p>and which ones have the best.</p>
<p>I think these quantifiable scores are crazy.</p>
<p>No, no, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>You can literally talk, look at how many women are raped in prison in one country versus</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>But my point is, when you put a score to that or count it, you&rsquo;re not counting a bunch of</p>
<p>other things that are really bad as well.</p>
<p>The scoring system could be refined.</p>
<p>Sure, I will give you that.</p>
<p>And I think this is the debate we had today, which was an unexpected debate.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t think we would go this deeper, I think is such an important debate for us</p>
<p>to have as humans and as a civilization, because we are getting in the weeds on so many other</p>
<p>issues, whether it&rsquo;s inflation, or, you know, innovation or politics, that human rights,</p>
<p>I feel is something we should all be able to agree on that all people should be able</p>
<p>to definition.</p>
<p>Jekyll, everyone says yes, the definition and the prioritization is where all the noise</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>And how do we deal with fire?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one on earth that&rsquo;s gonna say I don&rsquo;t believe in human rights.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, we all agree with the ideals.</p>
<p>Everyone agrees with the ideals.</p>
<p>The question is how you implement them.</p>
<p>Implementation, prioritization.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Like, for example, in the West, we do.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s a legitimate position for you to say that you&rsquo;re not going to take</p>
<p>money from dictators.</p>
<p>But to then say that any family office from any individual who was born in that country,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to take their money either.</p>
<p>I would have to think about I didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>Unless they they&rsquo;re willing to risk their lives by denouncing their own government.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that they do it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know they have to do it publicly.</p>
<p>I mean, if I talked to this hypothetical Chinese or Saudi person, and they said, I don&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>with this, I&rsquo;m working against I&rsquo;m a reformer, I guess I would have to consider it because</p>
<p>no, no, no, but we would want to make money for the reformer.</p>
<p>But Jason, what if they said, I don&rsquo;t have a point of view, that I would go with people</p>
<p>who would you morally disqualify them?</p>
<p>You disqualify them on moral grounds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the way to make allies J cow, which is important.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not so look, hold on, I need to answer it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re both going to ask me this question and accuse me of you know, this, I would have</p>
<p>to make a nuanced decision on an individual basis.</p>
<p>I would not make a blanket decision.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my position on this hypothetical situation, where somebody is a Saudi citizen has a family</p>
<p>office, I would have to make a very nuanced decision like you did Chamath, where you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take the domestic abusers.</p>
<p>And you did take the person that was an American, but I took the Chinese.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, but it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a human rights violation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a horrible thing that occurred.</p>
<p>And you had to make a nuanced decision.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hoping to promote here is that we have a dialogue about human</p>
<p>rights again, because when I was growing up in the 80s, this was something that the world</p>
<p>was getting consensus on.</p>
<p>And the West had consensus on and I think the West is very weak now.</p>
<p>And the fact that the NBA, that, you know, Apple, whatever companies, I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>call out individuals, because it&rsquo;s not productive, especially if it gets re aggregated.</p>
<p>And, you know, I happen to know some of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s something that the West has to contend with of what is our strategy here</p>
<p>with human rights violators?</p>
<p>Do we engage them?</p>
<p>Do we admonish them?</p>
<p>Or somewhere in between?</p>
<p>Do we disengage, engage or, you know, make our feelings heard and try to shape their</p>
<p>behavior to bend towards human rights.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very complicated, nuanced discussion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad we had it here today.</p>
<p>The time period you&rsquo;re talking about where we supposedly had consensus on this during</p>
<p>the 1980s during the Cold War.</p>
<p>I was talking about in America.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We talked about it a lot in America is my point.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think, actually, I think Ronald Reagan did a really good job with this.</p>
<p>He denounced the evil empire, but said that we should be a shining city on a hill.</p>
<p>And we did actually avoided a bunch of unnecessary foreign wars.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>So, look, I think the best way for us to lead on this issue is just to be an example.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not doing a very good job of that.</p>
<p>I mean, 100% of your ideals are great, but the world doesn&rsquo;t neatly line up with those</p>
<p>ideals and presents us with choices that don&rsquo;t fit those ideals.</p>
<p>I mean, during the Cold War, we had a choice to support either communist regimes, or in</p>
<p>a lot of cases, authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>And we chose the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>I think today, we have choices between do we want to support Islamic fundamentalist</p>
<p>regimes, or we want to support authoritarian regimes are resisting it.</p>
<p>I mean, those are the types of tough choices the world actually presents to us.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what makes it hard to sort of my enemy is my friend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complicated chessboard.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re better at chess than me, Zack.</p>
<p>So I will give you that.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s great that we had this discussion.</p>
<p>I really do appreciate that you guys were willing to talk about this for so long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important discussion.</p>
<p>Because if we don&rsquo;t stand for human rights and basic human rights, what do we stand for?</p>
<p>You know, and I agree that domestic is</p>
<p>I stand for I stand for me.</p>
<p>We know that.</p>
<p>We know that.</p>
<p>Tell us about the sweater.</p>
<p>Tell us about the sweater.</p>
<p>No candle.</p>
<p>I know this is just a symbol.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about the rise of authoritarianism, which actually, this was my one of</p>
<p>my big trends in the prediction episodes.</p>
<p>I am concerned democracy is the most negative trend.</p>
<p>But then I think you should be concerned about this, like rising tide we have here</p>
<p>of censorship and the surveillance.</p>
<p>I care about it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in agreement.</p>
<p>And our federal law enforcement agencies demanding more and more power lockdowns and</p>
<p>lockdowns.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in agreement.</p>
<p>Blowing this whole like January 6 thing out of proportion.</p>
<p>You should be concerned about their attempts to exploit and use that to demand more powers</p>
<p>to surveil and prosecute American citizens.</p>
<p>I do not believe in surveillance.</p>
<p>What I and I think you should understand that the hysteria created around</p>
<p>that event is going to be used.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be exploited.</p>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<p>Politicians are exploiting this on all sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>The right and the left.</p>
<p>The right is diminishing it.</p>
<p>The left is exacerbating it.</p>
<p>The truth in the middle is I think we are in agreement sacks.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of people who went to the Capitol that day were dipshits who</p>
<p>just wanted to protest and they cared about Trump and they went there for the party of</p>
<p>it all.</p>
<p>And then there was a small cohort who intended harm and who are deranged and who could</p>
<p>potentially be dangerous in the way Chamath framed it.</p>
<p>Lone wolves or small packs of wolves like the Oklahoma City bombers who murdered a large</p>
<p>number of people.</p>
<p>And so we have to be very careful in prosecuting one group one way and one the other way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what the Department of Justice has done.</p>
<p>In that case, 700 people got pled deals or very minor sentences.</p>
<p>And then these folks are going to have the book thrown at them and rightfully so because</p>
<p>they could have murdered Pence or they could have murdered Pelosi just like that woman</p>
<p>got murdered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, the woman tragically got stopped and shot and died.</p>
<p>Like that could have been a much different day.</p>
<p>If dozens of people had died, and those cops had not shown restraint, we could be sitting</p>
<p>here having a much different discussion about the Oath Keepers.</p>
<p>If the Oath Keepers had done what the Oklahoma City bombers succeeded in doing, this would</p>
<p>be a much different discussion.</p>
<p>Right, they didn&rsquo;t, which is why it is a different discussion.</p>
<p>Well, thank God for our police and, and for how brave they were in not unloading their</p>
<p>pistols when any reasonable person who was being beaten by that crowd and crushed would</p>
<p>have taken their gun out and started firing.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Thank God those police did not fire.</p>
<p>I think the one thing we can agree on is we don&rsquo;t want something like that to happen again.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s 200 simple things that would prevent it.</p>
<p>One is reform of the Electoral Count Act, like we talked about, that&rsquo;s what Biden should</p>
<p>be going for not making these speeches about Bull Connor and George Wallace, he could actually</p>
<p>get that done.</p>
<p>And the other thing is, if the Capitol Police had just been a little bit more prepared and</p>
<p>had barricades and screens of better security, that also couldn&rsquo;t, it couldn&rsquo;t happen again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we have to do to solve that problem.</p>
<p>Oh no, the third thing we have to do is arrest these Oath Keepers and put them in jail for</p>
<p>what they did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve been indicted.</p>
<p>You tell me if they&rsquo;re going to go to jail.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll convict them of something.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and rightfully so it seems.</p>
<p>Well, hopefully they get their day in court.</p>
<p>Maybe we can transition.</p>
<p>I want to talk about the other side of the coin on inflation, because I think that we</p>
<p>have hammered the point for a long time now that, you know, the government was really</p>
<p>sort of like off piste by printing incompetent trillions and trillions of dollars and injecting</p>
<p>it into the economy.</p>
<p>And what it&rsquo;s really created has been this massive bout of inflation, which then could</p>
<p>cause an ultimate recession because the Fed has to react.</p>
<p>All of those things, I think, are well documented.</p>
<p>I just wanted to put on the record the little element of the counterfactual, which I think</p>
<p>is really important.</p>
<p>And this is an article in The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>And Nick, you can post this if you can, please.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just going to read this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to look down.</p>
<p>The first two rounds of stimulus payments lifted 11.7 million people in America out</p>
<p>of poverty, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p>Americans build up $2.7 trillion in extra savings, and some expect that combined with</p>
<p>rising wages to provide them with lasting stability, despite the return to more normal</p>
<p>spending patterns and rising inflation.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure that all of us have heard that because that&rsquo;s an incredible thing</p>
<p>to be able to say that 11.7 million Americans in poverty are no longer in poverty because</p>
<p>of the stimulus, which I think when you look at the right way of framing what some of these</p>
<p>progressives want to do, I think a lot of the good intentions comes from things like</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>And I just think it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that that did happen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that we should really be proud of.</p>
<p>And especially if those folks can actually stay in the lower middle and then move up</p>
<p>to the middle class.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an incredible outcome.</p>
<p>And, you know, we we all supported that, I think, genuinely.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>We knew it was scary.</p>
<p>We needed to put something into the economy to keep it from crashing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to know what what the right amount was right from off like, how do you</p>
<p>know what the right amount of stimulus is, in a pandemic that happens every 100 years.</p>
<p>And thank God, it feels like Omicron is, you know, leading us out of this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some great examples, by the way, in this article, if you guys if people</p>
<p>want to take the time to read it of some examples of people that have really done</p>
<p>an incredible job in, in like, completely changing their financial picture, which I</p>
<p>mean, a lot of a lot of people went into freelance, a lot of these young people</p>
<p>realize I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this headline, a million less people started college this</p>
<p>year and enrolled.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s happening is so many people who were going into college realized, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if I should go into debt, I figured out a way to make money at home, and more financially</p>
<p>literate, I&rsquo;m going to make a better decision about college and not go 100k into debt.</p>
<p>Well, to be very specific, very resilient, and being better making better judgments about</p>
<p>their own lives, because they&rsquo;ve been forced to be specific.</p>
<p>I think you mean boys.</p>
<p>Because the other thing that&rsquo;s happening is in colleges now, it&rsquo;s becoming very tilted</p>
<p>female versus male, especially in some colleges, in some colleges, it&rsquo;s, you know, two thirds</p>
<p>female, one male 65.</p>
<p>So we were actually creating this weird longitudinal pattern here, where an entire gender is going</p>
<p>to be very miseducated, relative to another one.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;ll be the exact opposite of what it was like in probably the 50s or 60s,</p>
<p>where you had these large swaths of men that are educated women who typically stayed home,</p>
<p>or were undereducated relative to their ability.</p>
<p>Here now, it&rsquo;s the exact opposite, whereas like, you know, women are getting undergrads</p>
<p>and graduate degrees, and boys are learning how to play video games and smoke pot incels,</p>
<p>a very strange time.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what happens when you David&rsquo;s what is that like?</p>
<p>It being an incel.</p>
<p>Tell us you were a pioneer and being an incel.</p>
<p>We made it through the show.</p>
<p>So it was so civil.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get the Friedberg ratio up.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about an exciting scientific paper and the implications of it to science.</p>
<p>Tell us about this new study from Harvard that revealed Epstein Barr virus could be</p>
<p>associated with Ms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do a zoom out then a zoom in.</p>
<p>Yes, bear with me for a moment.</p>
<p>So you know, there are over 80 what are called autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>These are diseases where your body or immune system attacks your own tissue and causes</p>
<p>real problems.</p>
<p>One in 20 people worldwide suffer from some sort of autoimmune condition.</p>
<p>So disease lupus, which affects, you know, your whole system, rheumatoid arthritis, where</p>
<p>your joints get inflamed, Sjogren syndrome, where your eyes and your mouth get messed</p>
<p>up and multiple sclerosis, which we&rsquo;ll talk about here in a second.</p>
<p>But these are all diseases that have a similar ideology, which is that your immune system</p>
<p>attacks some tissue in your body, it dysfunctions and it attacks it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always been this big question about kind of what causes autoimmune conditions</p>
<p>and what causes immune system dysregulation like this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all sorts of different theories and studies and papers, many of which have</p>
<p>been, you know, well documented genetic risk factors, environmental factors, age.</p>
<p>And in particular, as you get older, the thymus, which is supposed to create these helper cells</p>
<p>that go out and keep cells in your immune system from attacking your own body, your</p>
<p>thymus kind of starts to fade away, or sorry, your thalamus starts to fade away and start</p>
<p>to stop working.</p>
<p>And so, you know, one theory that&rsquo;s been talked about a lot is molecular mimicry, which means</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some protein from a virus or that enters your body, or cancer, and that</p>
<p>protein looks a lot like some other protein in your body.</p>
<p>And so, your immune system starts attacking that protein.</p>
<p>And as a result, your immune system gets turned on to that protein.</p>
<p>And it actually attacks a similar looking protein somewhere else in your body.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a, you know, a very kind of broad statement about, you know, some potential</p>
<p>cause of autoimmune conditions.</p>
<p>And you can find protein mimicry theories coming from the gut, where, you know, microbes</p>
<p>in the gut are triggering this, and then also viruses.</p>
<p>So, in particular, you know, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, which we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to talk about here today.</p>
<p>So, multiple sclerosis is this disease, one of the autoimmune diseases, where your immune</p>
<p>system attacks and destroys myelin, which is, you know, found on your nerve cells and</p>
<p>in your brain.</p>
<p>And it can actually cause, you know, when this happens, and your immune system starts</p>
<p>to attack your brain, you end up with these lesions and really debilitating effects over</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>One in 300 people in the US have been diagnosed with MS.</p>
<p>It is a brutal disease.</p>
<p>It lasts your whole life.</p>
<p>And the treatment today, the primary treatment is this drug that destroys B cells in your</p>
<p>body, and your B cells make antibodies.</p>
<p>And so, by destroying the B cells, it gets rid of the cells that are making the antibodies</p>
<p>that are attacking your own brain.</p>
<p>And this is a really effective treatment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been able to reduce the effects of MS significantly, but we still don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>causes it and what triggers MS.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always been this theory, going back to the mimicry question, that one of</p>
<p>these viruses that everyone seems to get as they, you know, age is causing it.</p>
<p>And so, Epstein-Barr virus has always been thought to be one of those viruses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the herpes viruses.</p>
<p>Everyone knows it as mono.</p>
<p>So, you know, you get mono and you get swollen neck, a lot of people do.</p>
<p>Most people that get this virus don&rsquo;t end up having any symptoms that are even though</p>
<p>they have it.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a crazy statistic.</p>
<p>95% of people have Epstein-Barr virus.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s known that Epstein-Barr virus does actually cause some kinds of cancers and lymphoma</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s the paper that was published yesterday.</p>
<p>And again, if you know that Epstein-Barr virus, you know, is doing some other stuff in your</p>
<p>body that&rsquo;s negative, shouldn&rsquo;t this be a reason to look at it for MS?</p>
<p>But how do you get the data to do it given that 95% of people already have Epstein-Barr</p>
<p>virus?</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>These guys at Harvard went to the military, the US military, and the US military basically</p>
<p>had 10 million members of the military take 62 million blood samples over a period of</p>
<p>time from 1993 to 2013.</p>
<p>And when they take these blood samples, they, you know, they run their typical checkup on</p>
<p>these people, on the military members, but they save some of the blood sample in a freezer.</p>
<p>And so, they&rsquo;ve got 62 million blood samples sitting in freezers, the US military does.</p>
<p>And so, these researchers were able to access those blood samples.</p>
<p>And they then found 5% of the people that don&rsquo;t have Epstein-Barr virus, because remember,</p>
<p>95% of people have it.</p>
<p>So, they found the 5% that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And they went through and they found that during this period of time that they have</p>
<p>all this blood data for, they were able to identify 800 people that started out Epstein-Barr</p>
<p>virus negative, and then got MS.</p>
<p>100% of the people that got MS were infected with Epstein-Barr virus during this period</p>
<p>of time.</p>
<p>And for the group of people that didn&rsquo;t get MS, only about half of them got Epstein-Barr</p>
<p>virus infection during this period of time.</p>
<p>And then they looked at this for about 20 other viruses, and basically showed absolutely</p>
<p>no correlation or difference in risk between all the other viruses if you got MS or didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get MS.</p>
<p>And so, it basically creates a 95% probability that you&rsquo;re 32 times more likely to get MS</p>
<p>from Epstein-Barr virus than from anything else.</p>
<p>It is from a racially diverse pool, an age diverse pool, ethnically diverse pool.</p>
<p>So, a lot of other confounding factors like race or ethnicity or genetics, a lot of other</p>
<p>factors like all the other viruses that might be causing MS have been excluded.</p>
<p>And it shows that maybe Epstein-Barr virus is the primary cause of MS that triggers certain</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s immune systems to go nuts and attack the brain.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting because Epstein-Barr virus has a bunch of proteins in it that look</p>
<p>like other human proteins.</p>
<p>So, it makes sense why this might happen.</p>
<p>MS costs 40 grand a year, there&rsquo;s $30 billion a year spent in the US on MS care.</p>
<p>So, if we can go in and get Epstein-Barr virus eliminated from the human body, it would be</p>
<p>an incredibly incredible cost saving and a therapeutic benefit to people with MS.</p>
<p>You should talk about the reason why we don&rsquo;t have a herpes vaccine, though.</p>
<p>So, HSV1, 2, 3, now 4, none of these things have reasonable vaccines.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s for a very specific reason, which is that the herpes virus itself is incredibly,</p>
<p>incredibly difficult to isolate and find until it activates.</p>
<p>And it hides itself and it nests itself inside these nerve cells.</p>
<p>So, you may want to just talk about how complicated it is to produce it.</p>
<p>I mean, the DNA disappears into these nerve cells.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s hard to get, you know, immune system to go and clear them out permanently.</p>
<p>The Epstein-Barr virus hides out in B cells in your body.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s floating around in your body forever.</p>
<p>And as your B cells replicate, the virus replicates with them.</p>
<p>And then when your immune system starts to get weak,</p>
<p>the virus pops out and starts attacking and inflaming your body again.</p>
<p>So, number one, Epstein-Barr virus has never been a great target, a therapeutic target,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not much money to be made.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, who the hell cares about mono?</p>
<p>Once you get mono, you get over it, you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>But if Epstein-Barr virus is in fact causing this problem with</p>
<p>MS, there&rsquo;s a reason to go after it, a lot of money to go after it.</p>
<p>And there are several new technologies and therapeutic strategies that are possible,</p>
<p>one of which is, you know, Chamath sent out over a group text,</p>
<p>a company that&rsquo;s doing T cell therapies, we can actually program a T cell.</p>
<p>And the T cell goes into the body and finds these B cells with Epstein-Barr virus and wipes them out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a steroid, a diuretic steroid that&rsquo;s been shown that&rsquo;s used to treat high blood pressure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been shown to stop Epstein-Barr virus from leaving cells.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an antiviral drug made by Takeda called</p>
<p>Meribavir, which has been shown to have high efficacy in eliminating Epstein-Barr virus.</p>
<p>So there are now therapeutic strategies that are being actively explored</p>
<p>that could unlock the potential of minimizing or eliminating Epstein-Barr virus</p>
<p>for a broader population than we ever thought should be taking these therapies.</p>
<p>Because the implications may be that if you can stop Epstein-Barr virus from replicating or</p>
<p>eliminate it from your body, you can stop all these follow on diseases that occur over time</p>
<p>in your life that are super debilitating and costly.</p>
<p>Yeah, lupus is another one tied to herpes simplex four.</p>
<p>I think the real problem is going to be that two thirds of the adult population</p>
<p>under the age of 55 have herpes simplex four.</p>
<p>So, you know, you&rsquo;re literally talking about inoculating the entire world.</p>
<p>And when we start to think about that grand of a scale,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a cost issue, there&rsquo;s a manufacturability issue, and then there&rsquo;s an ROI issue that</p>
<p>that unfortunately, will be adjudicated.</p>
<p>And that to me is what really, you know, stands out.</p>
<p>And that and that and that is that just the healthcare economics of it,</p>
<p>obviously, the science of it is still really complicated.</p>
<p>Are we doing an mRNA vaccine for Epstein-Barr? And how would that play into this?</p>
<p>Absolutely. So there&rsquo;s a lot of techniques. This is, you know, T cell therapeutics, mRNA,</p>
<p>a chemotherapy type drug, a steroid drug, an antiviral drug.</p>
<p>So, every modality for therapeutics has some candidate or candidates for Epstein-Barr virus.</p>
<p>And so, you know, there may be a bunch of ways that you start to identify risk factors and that</p>
<p>you give someone one particular therapy that might be really affordable, like this antiviral</p>
<p>may be super affordable, you know, if we could make it for 5 cents a pill, you could, you know,</p>
<p>get it out to a lot of people prophylactically that are at high risk.</p>
<p>You know, if there&rsquo;s a group that actually is active with MS, a good treatment may be to try</p>
<p>and give them the T cell therapy and see if that helps. And so, that&rsquo;s the clinical trials that</p>
<p>will start now. Because if you can give people a T cell therapy and eliminate EBV and stop</p>
<p>all future need for MS treatment, that&rsquo;ll save 40 grand a year, it&rsquo;ll start to make sense to</p>
<p>run clinical studies to see if that stuff&rsquo;s possible and is worth doing. So, it opens up</p>
<p>a whole new kind of area of interest. By the way, this isn&rsquo;t novel. People have been talking about</p>
<p>this for a long time. But this paper has such incredible data and such strong signal</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really going to it&rsquo;s really going to catalyze investment.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have the big data based on this study, we would not have gotten here for</p>
<p>once on the show, I will say thank God for the US government. And all of the</p>
<p>the the data that they&rsquo;ve, you know, all of these blood samples that they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I want to get your read on the the human transplant thing that we saw this week,</p>
<p>where genetically modified pig heart was an implant into 57 Jason, you want a 57 year old</p>
<p>man, you want to read that out? Oh, yeah, David Bennett, a 57 year old man requested special</p>
<p>emergency authorization for the experimental surgery from the FDA, FDA, he was dying and</p>
<p>unable to receive a human heart transplant. The surgery was performed on January 7,</p>
<p>in Baltimore. And this happened as the US is facing a major organ shortage.</p>
<p>I mean, we have we have hundreds of 1000s. I mean, people on organ donor registries,</p>
<p>or needing a transplant, you know, my father was on a kidney transplant registry for eight years</p>
<p>until he passed away. These things are just brutalizing for the individuals and the family</p>
<p>around it. And so like, you know, all of a sudden, if you can see a path where you can</p>
<p>genetically modify other sources of organs and implant them without organ rejection into the</p>
<p>human body. That&rsquo;s like, that is that&rsquo;s mine. But it&rsquo;s mind blowing. So it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the availability of these things. But it&rsquo;s about turning off one of the</p>
<p>biggest, the big risk factor of organ transplant is rejection, meaning you&rsquo;re putting all this</p>
<p>foreign matter into your body. It&rsquo;s foreign proteins. And so when your immune system sees</p>
<p>all those foreign proteins, your body goes haywire and tries to kill it. It&rsquo;s like this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s like, imagine getting a billion viruses at once. And so there&rsquo;s all these new</p>
<p>proteins. And so one of the interesting things you can do, you know, if you can grow these,</p>
<p>these organs, and alter the genetics of the cells that are being used to grow the organs,</p>
<p>is you can get those cells to match your own, or to basically downregulate all of the proteins</p>
<p>that might be triggering immune rejection in your body. So theoretically, you could</p>
<p>grow J. Cal&rsquo;s heart with tissue and cells that match your DNA potentially match your</p>
<p>protein structure perfectly. And if Saks had a heart, you could do it with him too.</p>
<p>Right, there you go. Good transition. But no, I mean, and by the way, there may also be a path</p>
<p>here where we grow these organs with your DNA without even using the animal body,</p>
<p>the entirety of the rest of the animal to do so. So there&rsquo;s a lot of really interesting</p>
<p>breakthroughs that are possible, but it&rsquo;s really great to see a highlighted, you know, non,</p>
<p>you know, kind of transplanted organ from another body into the human body,</p>
<p>because it just, again, it opens up what people have been talking about for decades,</p>
<p>which is the possibility of this. Now that we have gene editing and potentially have the ability to</p>
<p>grow biological matter in bioreactors, it&rsquo;s going to be it&rsquo;s going to be tremendous.</p>
<p>J. Cal, what do you think about the democratic person in the SEC saying that they wanted to</p>
<p>basically make the accredited investor laws even stricter?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredibly infuriating.</p>
<p>That was your big prediction.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we really have to get these laws. I mean, I think this is like a Theranos,</p>
<p>or we work over reaction, which is like, Oh my god, there are some bad private companies.</p>
<p>If you take the number of bad private companies, and then look at what is happening in the country</p>
<p>with people wagering on sports and wagering on crypto, slash investing, depending on</p>
<p>we you know how you look at it, we need to have one rule for the road, which is people take a test,</p>
<p>they get accredited, and then they can do what they want with their money, the equivalent of</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m suggesting, people can only invest a fraction of the money they have on their last</p>
<p>two years tax returns, let&rsquo;s pick a number 5% of their two year average on their tax returns 10%,</p>
<p>whatever you want to pick, and they have to take a test with the would be the equivalent</p>
<p>of people having to take a three hour course and a you know, I don&rsquo;t know 50 question test</p>
<p>to go to Vegas and play blackjack. And they could only put on the blackjack table 10% of their total</p>
<p>average yearly income for their household in the past year. You think about how crazy that would be</p>
<p>to tell an American, you got to take a blackjack course and pass a blackjack test and understand</p>
<p>the odds of poker or whatever to play that game. And you can only put if you made $50,000 on hours</p>
<p>last few years, you can only bet 5000 in Vegas at any one time, that&rsquo;s the max chips you can buy in</p>
<p>a year. Those are the two things I&rsquo;m advocating for in private company investing. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really if we want to have people move from, you know, poor to middle class from middle class to</p>
<p>affluent in this country, there has to be equity participation. And equity participation has to</p>
<p>start early. Look at what happened with all these young people betting on crypto, betting on stocks</p>
<p>or stonks. And, you know, doing puts and calls and all kinds of crazy things. You know, in public</p>
<p>markets, we would really rather see those people, or at least in addition, be able to invest on</p>
<p>LinkedIn if they were a recruiter in year two, or they were an Uber driver, be able to buy Uber</p>
<p>shares, or if they were an Airbnb host, be able to buy Airbnb shares as a private company will</p>
<p>change the entire complexion of upward mobility in the United States. And we really have to keep</p>
<p>educating people not limiting their upside. That&rsquo;s my personal belief.</p>
<p>Person who asked you the question stopped paying attention like five minutes ago.</p>
<p>Oh, because we&rsquo;re talking about science and hearts.</p>
<p>No, I asked you a simple question like 15 minutes ago. And like, you just</p>
<p>know, that was a 90 second monologue. Henry Bellcaster, by the way, I got inside information</p>
<p>on sacks. You know, how sacks started like, doing a little bit of artistic direction. You know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got that Scorsese and I&rsquo;m having done the award winning film. Thank you for smoking. And he</p>
<p>he got Henry Bellcaster on his team. You know, the Tick Tock guys, Tick Tock guys,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been making some suggestions. Lightly suggesting sacks has been directing,</p>
<p>not directing talk superfan saying, Hey, you might want to make a Tick Tock out of this monologue.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what happened. There&rsquo;s a quote of a segment that somebody liked, they retweeted,</p>
<p>they got a whole bunch of likes. And so I sent the Tick Tock guy said, this might make a good</p>
<p>talker. Yeah, nobody else doing that. But okay. Okay, we&rsquo;ll go for it. I&rsquo;m not editing, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>lightly suggesting people do think that you have Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s writers writing for you,</p>
<p>because you say it and people don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re clear. I that is a joke.</p>
<p>You do not have Tucker Carlson&rsquo;s current writers writing for you. There may be some</p>
<p>I do admit, I have a special writing team for roasts. You do. I mean, for roasts,</p>
<p>but do you do you keep them on retainer? Like, if you have a roast, like you can just ask them to</p>
<p>punch up some stuff for you. Or Yeah, I&rsquo;ve only done it twice. I did it for you for your</p>
<p>roast Jake Allen. I did it for Phil Helm. This really destroyed Phil. Oh my god. Yeah. This is</p>
<p>hysterical. Oh my god. This was the cheapest roast ever. They rented like a junior suite</p>
<p>that they got for free at some it wasn&rsquo;t rented. Yeah, they got it for free. They got it for free.</p>
<p>They had like 30 people in a room and they&rsquo;re like, Oh, you got to come out for Phil&rsquo;s roast.</p>
<p>It was like 30 people in a junior suite had like a B level hotel. And it was so bad. And</p>
<p>Saxon I came in and we had absolutely a no allegiance to the audience. I lost so much</p>
<p>money that everybody you guys were out of control. It was brutal. Here&rsquo;s the Helmuth</p>
<p>roast. I got I got the material right now. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, my god. To be sure these</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t our jokes. This is what a Comedy Central writer wrote. So we have well, we do not endorse</p>
<p>these. No, what? Well, okay. So if you want to understand how I work, so they basically put</p>
<p>together some material and then I shape it. There&rsquo;s like some back and forth. It&rsquo;s a workshop. You</p>
<p>work. Yeah, we workshop it. Yeah, go ahead. It begins. We&rsquo;re here tonight to roast the poker</p>
<p>player known as the greatest. Unfortunately, Phil Ivey wasn&rsquo;t available. So we sell for Phil Helmuth.</p>
<p>Hello. In the poker world, Phil is known as a poker brat. The rest of the world just calls him</p>
<p>asshole. Phil has mastered the GTO strategy of playing poker for most players. GTO stands for</p>
<p>game theory optimal, but in Phil&rsquo;s case, it stands for grading toxic and obnoxious.</p>
<p>Despite all this, Phil fancies himself a quote unquote, poker ambassador,</p>
<p>not to throw a damper on things, but calling Phil an ambassador for poker is like calling</p>
<p>Bill Cosby an ambassador for quaaludes. Oh, no, you cut that one. Oh, that&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it. Phil is nuts. He&rsquo;s the only poker player sponsored by lithium.</p>
<p>Phil demands silence at the poker table so you can hear the voices in his head.</p>
<p>When Phil was inducted into the poker hall of fame, they retired his straight jacket.</p>
<p>Now Phil is doing what all people in crisis do, write self-help books.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called positivity, which is ironic because the only thing Phil has ever</p>
<p>tested positive for is narcissistic personality disorder.</p>
<p>This inspirational tome is a whopping 84 pages. Oprah has taken inspirational shits bigger than</p>
<p>this. How bad is Phil&rsquo;s book? On Amazon, it says people who enjoyed this book also</p>
<p>enjoy pounding their dick with a meat tenderizer.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a bunch of guys for good. All right, everybody, hope you enjoyed Sax&rsquo;s</p>
<p>excerpt from the Phil Hellmuth Narcissist Roast. And we&rsquo;ll catch you next week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be good. We need to get merch.</p>
