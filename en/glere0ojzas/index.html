this is something that&amp;rsquo;s very common yet can create a lot of problems if you&amp;rsquo;re diagnosed and treated incorrectly not to mention these side effects from all the drugs that you&amp;rsquo;ll be getting unnecessarily so the worst thing that a person get is that you have this disease or this diagnosis yet when it&amp;rsquo;s actually another problem it&amp;rsquo;s never going to be solved if you have the wrong diagnosis to diagnose someone you need to evaluate them with complete data and true data now i&amp;rsquo;m going to give you a little example of a recent situation where i had some people responding to something in the news that said the ketogenic diet now has been proven by scientific studies to cause heart problems okay well there&amp;rsquo;s other data to show that the ketogenic diet helps prevent heart problems right so when you have conflicting information you have to start asking questions you have to start digging into the data and looking at it yourself because sometimes when you look at second-hand information where someone&amp;rsquo;s giving you their opinion about another study it could be slightly flawed so if you actually look at the data and you read it yourself it was a study involving mice and they were on the ketogenic diet so i thought until i found out that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the ketogenic diet at all it was a high fat high carbohydrate diet just because something is high fat doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it keto keto is low carb so the percentage of carbs that they put these mice on were 30 percent well keto is around 5 carbs so that was an example of false data let&amp;rsquo;s give you some other examples let&amp;rsquo;s say we have gerd this is a disorder where the the valve on the top of the stomach doesn&amp;rsquo;t close so you have acid that comes up and so if you read on this they&amp;rsquo;ll talk about genetics maybe some environmental things but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually tell you the actual underlying cause evaluating someone&amp;rsquo;s diet is not looked at very much in the medical profession and unfortunately this data is very very important because if this is not added into the equation and it&amp;rsquo;s not looked at closely you&amp;rsquo;re going to come up with different conclusions and a different treatment and so you also have to understand that some data is more important than others so if you&amp;rsquo;re focusing on the genes which you really can&amp;rsquo;t change too much versus the diet which you can change this would be way way more important let&amp;rsquo;s take a slow metabolism right a lot of times people will say well it&amp;rsquo;s your your thyroid is slow so let&amp;rsquo;s say you do a test and you find out the thyroid is low so then what causes that they just say well you don&amp;rsquo;t your thyroid is deficient and we can just keep treating it right so you&amp;rsquo;re on medication for a very long time and so we&amp;rsquo;re not really actually getting deeper into why first of all when we evaluate this we have to be complete about it and we have to have all the data here&amp;rsquo;s some extra data ninety percent of all hypothyroid cases are hashimoto&amp;rsquo;s that&amp;rsquo;s an autoimmune problem autoimmune problems relate to the gut another piece of data that&amp;rsquo;s rarely evaluated when you&amp;rsquo;re looking at these connections so let&amp;rsquo;s say for example a person doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an autoimmune disease then you have to look at other reasons for a hypothyroid problem well there&amp;rsquo;s a liver problem if there&amp;rsquo;s a gallbladder problem simply because 80% of that conversion from t4 to t3 happens through the liver and the 20% happens through the kidney also if you&amp;rsquo;re high in estrogen that can inhibit the thyroid hormone this is why women sometimes when they go through pregnancy when they get this spike of estrogen end up with a slow thyroid this is just using all the data that&amp;rsquo;s available to evaluate the most likely cause of the problem now they might say a slow metabolism is that you just eat too many calories right this has been completely disproven because how do you explain the skinny people that can eat like a horse and they never gain weight and then you have the conclusion a lot of people make is well you&amp;rsquo;re just eating too many calories but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you the whole picture it&amp;rsquo;s not all about calories usually if someone has a slow metabolism and a problem with their set point so let&amp;rsquo;s say they lose weight and they get down to 150 pounds but they can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get below that that is related to insulin resistance another piece of data that is rarely evaluated or added into the equation if you fix insulin resistance which by the way when you have insulin resistance many times you have high insulin you fix the metabolism you fix the set point okay then you have high blood pressure which is a very common diagnosis which is related to genetics and risk factors and smoking and all these things that are factors but are they the most important pieces of data usually not because the most important data when you&amp;rsquo;re evaluating blood pressure it should be potassium and vitamin d and high insulin these three things will raise blood pressure faster than anything else but if this is not evaluated the person ends up on medication for the rest of their life one last story i had a patient who came in with heart pain she&amp;rsquo;s been to the emergency room other doctors the cost for all the testing was forty thousand dollars okay and so here&amp;rsquo;s another really important tool when you evaluate you wanna get a complete history when did it start this question was never asked okay so i found it happened like i think a week previously on a tuesday i said what time she said five o&amp;rsquo;clock i said then what happened right before this what did you eat well we found out what she ate a huge banana split okay she rarely ever does that i already know when you eat those type of foods you&amp;rsquo;re going to sometimes affect the gallbladder and that sometimes can create the blockage which can create pressure which can then back up in the liver which can then affect the heart so i knew about that link i said lay on the table did some gentle massage in the area of digestion and her heart pain went away and it never came back so this is just using this simple little question right here and so can you imagine if she was actually diagnosed with some heart defect and they actually did surgery that would be devastating and so it&amp;rsquo;s important when you evaluate to get all the data make sure it&amp;rsquo;s true data understand that some data is more important than others and definitely do a complete history thanks for watching hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today'>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>﻿let&rsquo;s talk about the dangers of someone giving 
you the wrong diagnosis this is something that&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>very common yet can create a lot of problems 
if you&rsquo;re diagnosed and treated incorrectly  </p>
<p>not to mention these side effects from all the 
drugs that you&rsquo;ll be getting unnecessarily so the  </p>
<p>worst thing that a person get is that you have 
this disease or this diagnosis yet when it&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>actually another problem it&rsquo;s never going to be 
solved if you have the wrong diagnosis to diagnose  </p>
<p>someone you need to evaluate them with complete 
data and true data now i&rsquo;m going to give you a  </p>
<p>little example of a recent situation where i had 
some people responding to something in the news  </p>
<p>that said the ketogenic diet now has been proven 
by scientific studies to cause heart problems okay  </p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s other data to show that the ketogenic 
diet helps prevent heart problems right so when  </p>
<p>you have conflicting information you have to 
start asking questions you have to start digging  </p>
<p>into the data and looking at it yourself because 
sometimes when you look at second-hand information  </p>
<p>where someone&rsquo;s giving you their opinion about 
another study it could be slightly flawed so if  </p>
<p>you actually look at the data and you read it 
yourself it was a study involving mice and they  </p>
<p>were on the ketogenic diet so i thought until i 
found out that it wasn&rsquo;t the ketogenic diet at all  </p>
<p>it was a high fat high carbohydrate diet just 
because something is high fat doesn&rsquo;t make it keto  </p>
<p>keto is low carb so the percentage of carbs 
that they put these mice on were 30 percent  </p>
<p>well keto is around 5 carbs so that was an example 
of false data let&rsquo;s give you some other examples  </p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say we have gerd this is a disorder where 
the the valve on the top of the stomach doesn&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>close so you have acid that comes up and so if 
you read on this they&rsquo;ll talk about genetics  </p>
<p>maybe some environmental things but it doesn&rsquo;t 
actually tell you the actual underlying cause  </p>
<p>evaluating someone&rsquo;s diet is not looked at very 
much in the medical profession and unfortunately  </p>
<p>this data is very very important because if this 
is not added into the equation and it&rsquo;s not looked  </p>
<p>at closely you&rsquo;re going to come up with different 
conclusions and a different treatment and so you  </p>
<p>also have to understand that some data is more 
important than others so if you&rsquo;re focusing on  </p>
<p>the genes which you really can&rsquo;t change too 
much versus the diet which you can change  </p>
<p>this would be way way more important let&rsquo;s take a 
slow metabolism right a lot of times people will  </p>
<p>say well it&rsquo;s your your thyroid is slow so let&rsquo;s 
say you do a test and you find out the thyroid  </p>
<p>is low so then what causes that they just say 
well you don&rsquo;t your thyroid is deficient and  </p>
<p>we can just keep treating it right so you&rsquo;re on 
medication for a very long time and so we&rsquo;re not  </p>
<p>really actually getting deeper into why first of 
all when we evaluate this we have to be complete  </p>
<p>about it and we have to have all the data here&rsquo;s 
some extra data ninety percent of all hypothyroid  </p>
<p>cases are hashimoto&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s an autoimmune 
problem autoimmune problems relate to the gut  </p>
<p>another piece of data that&rsquo;s rarely evaluated when 
you&rsquo;re looking at these connections so let&rsquo;s say  </p>
<p>for example a person doesn&rsquo;t have an autoimmune 
disease then you have to look at other reasons for  </p>
<p>a hypothyroid problem well there&rsquo;s a liver problem 
if there&rsquo;s a gallbladder problem simply because 80%  </p>
<p>of that conversion from t4 to t3 happens through 
the liver and the 20% happens through the kidney  </p>
<p>also if you&rsquo;re high in estrogen that can 
inhibit the thyroid hormone this is why  </p>
<p>women sometimes when they go through pregnancy 
when they get this spike of estrogen end up with  </p>
<p>a slow thyroid this is just using all the data 
that&rsquo;s available to evaluate the most likely  </p>
<p>cause of the problem now they might say a 
slow metabolism is that you just eat too many  </p>
<p>calories right this has been completely disproven 
because how do you explain the skinny people that  </p>
<p>can eat like a horse and they never gain weight 
and then you have the conclusion a lot of people  </p>
<p>make is well you&rsquo;re just eating too many calories 
but that doesn&rsquo;t give you the whole picture it&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>not all about calories usually if someone has a 
slow metabolism and a problem with their set point  </p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say they lose weight and they get down to 
150 pounds but they can&rsquo;t seem to get below that  </p>
<p>that is related to insulin resistance another 
piece of data that is rarely evaluated or added  </p>
<p>into the equation if you fix insulin resistance 
which by the way when you have insulin resistance  </p>
<p>many times you have high insulin you fix the 
metabolism you fix the set point okay then you  </p>
<p>have high blood pressure which is a very common 
diagnosis which is related to genetics and risk  </p>
<p>factors and smoking and all these things that are 
factors but are they the most important pieces of  </p>
<p>data usually not because the most important 
data when you&rsquo;re evaluating blood pressure  </p>
<p>it should be potassium and vitamin d and high 
insulin these three things will raise blood  </p>
<p>pressure faster than anything else but if this 
is not evaluated the person ends up on medication  </p>
<p>for the rest of their life one last story 
i had a patient who came in with heart pain  </p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been to the emergency room other doctors 
the cost for all the testing was forty thousand  </p>
<p>dollars okay and so here&rsquo;s another really 
important tool when you evaluate you wanna get  </p>
<p>a complete history when did it start this question 
was never asked okay so i found it happened like  </p>
<p>i think a week previously on a tuesday i said 
what time she said five o&rsquo;clock i said then what  </p>
<p>happened right before this what did you eat well 
we found out what she ate a huge banana split okay  </p>
<p>she rarely ever does that i already know when you 
eat those type of foods you&rsquo;re going to sometimes  </p>
<p>affect the gallbladder and that sometimes can 
create the blockage which can create pressure  </p>
<p>which can then back up in the liver which can 
then affect the heart so i knew about that link  </p>
<p>i said lay on the table did some gentle massage 
in the area of digestion and her heart pain went  </p>
<p>away and it never came back so this is just using 
this simple little question right here and so can  </p>
<p>you imagine if she was actually diagnosed 
with some heart defect and they actually  </p>
<p>did surgery that would be devastating and so it&rsquo;s 
important when you evaluate to get all the data  </p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s true data understand that some data 
is more important than others and definitely do  </p>
<p>a complete history thanks for watching hey before 
you go real quick i have a course entitled how to  </p>
<p>bulletproof your immune system it&rsquo;s a free course 
i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why here&rsquo;s you  </p>
<p>here is your environment everyone 
is focused on this over here  </p>
<p>avoiding your environment but what about here 
what about strengthening your immune system  </p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s missing this course will show 
you how to bulletproof yourself and so you  </p>
<p>can tolerate and resist your environment much 
better by strengthening your own immune system  </p>
<p>i put a link down in the description right 
down below check it out and get signed up today</p>
