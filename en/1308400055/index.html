    <p>Hi friends, so shit looks different once again because I moved. It&rsquo;s the same desk. It&rsquo;s the same mic</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same everything same me just a new apartment</p>
<p>And if it echoes, I&rsquo;m so sorry this bitch is big</p>
<p>no, really, I&rsquo;ve been busting my fucking ass since I moved to Houston and I wanted to upgrade my place and</p>
<p>I can do a full episode about</p>
<p>Like why I moved how I moved the whole situation because the way that it lined up was some crazy-ass shit</p>
<p>So I definitely want to talk about it eventually, but I&rsquo;m just gonna shut the fuck up for now and go into</p>
<p>Navigating outgrowing people and outgrowing friends cuz that&rsquo;s something I was not prepared for</p>
<p>When I started my little self-growth self-development journey, like really just getting my fucking life in check starting a business doing my shit</p>
<p>I lost a lot of people and people came and went a lot. It&rsquo;s because I outgrew shit very fast</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna talk about a few situations where you can outgrow people like reef reframe it in your mind for you</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna do like the perspective shifts first. I&rsquo;m gonna talk about situations and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you how to navigate them</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also gonna tell you how to know you&rsquo;ve outgrown someone like what to look for like the main indicator that you&rsquo;ve outgrown someone and</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m also gonna talk about checking you like I&rsquo;m gonna check you because a lot of people</p>
<p>Need to be more considerate with their friends cuz like when you outgrow someone a lot of people just kind of like go on their</p>
<p>New path and do their own thing and forget about the friend like you need to be fucking considerate</p>
<p>You need to communicate so I&rsquo;m gonna teach you how to navigate that and I&rsquo;m also gonna talk about</p>
<p>Dealing with friends having negative reactions to you doing new shit or like anything like that like outgrowing people</p>
<p>They feel it too and they&rsquo;re gonna have a negative reaction</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna teach you how to navigate all of this shit</p>
<p>but the first thing I want to say it&rsquo;s a kick this bitch off is</p>
<p>outgrowing people is</p>
<p>Totally normal. It&rsquo;s an expected thing</p>
<p>Throughout your entire fucking life</p>
<p>It is totally okay to outgrow people and feel like you have outgrown people because the reality is</p>
<p>you have when you meet someone who you were when you met them at that point in time is</p>
<p>Not who you have to be forever. You&rsquo;re gonna change. You&rsquo;re gonna develop you&rsquo;re gonna grow</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have new perspectives new experiences new outlooks on life</p>
<p>Your personality is gonna change your desires are gonna change and the people you meet at one point</p>
<p>Might not be</p>
<p>compatible with the new things that you desire or the new person that you are whether you make a mindset shift and you just see</p>
<p>The fucking world completely different you&rsquo;re immediately gonna like detach and no longer resonate with the people in your life</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very painful and it&rsquo;s very fucking weird and people don&rsquo;t talk about it. So here I am</p>
<p>So I want to throw out a new perspective really quick about</p>
<p>Outgrowing people so think back to like high school or college or work like having a job</p>
<p>When you have friends in these environments, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re forced to be around each other like the friends I had in high school</p>
<p>I always called it like school friends</p>
<p>Like I have friends that I&rsquo;m friends with at school, but I&rsquo;m not hanging out with you outside of school</p>
<p>but my whole point with this is like school work college, whatever it is if you are</p>
<p>Like forced to be around someone, of course, you&rsquo;re gonna feel like you have a friendship</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna feel like you&rsquo;re close to this person</p>
<p>But when that thing ends you quit the job you finish school and you&rsquo;re no longer forced to be around these people</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take a lot of effort to remain friends</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the one thing a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize and I had this whole thing kind of happened when I was in nursing</p>
<p>School like my best friend Heather</p>
<p>She was like older than me. She had like two kids</p>
<p>She has three now, but we were so tight in nursing school</p>
<p>Like we were like it was me her and my friend Brittany and we were like the little trio like everybody knew us together</p>
<p>But like me and Heather were so fucking tight and through nursing school</p>
<p>We were like spent time together all the time. We text every day like we were doing the same thing</p>
<p>We were working toward the same goal. So we were very involved in each other&rsquo;s life very close</p>
<p>Once school ended we were no longer forced to be around each other and then you have to look at am I actually</p>
<p>Compatible with this person outside of what we were forced to be around each other for like she&rsquo;s a grown woman with children</p>
<p>I was 21 when I graduated what the fuck business. Did we have been friends? We&rsquo;re still tight like we still talk</p>
<p>Occasionally like we&rsquo;ll check in on each other</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not involved in each other&rsquo;s life often, but I still care about her very much like I still cherish the memories</p>
<p>We have I still cherish that entire time in my life, but we&rsquo;re not involved in each other&rsquo;s life heavily anymore</p>
<p>We kind of like we literally just went on our own life and they&rsquo;re not compatible like we went in our own direction</p>
<p>And it sucks and it&rsquo;s sad</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re like not friends anymore or you&rsquo;ve outgrown them or anything</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re just different like once that thing that&rsquo;s gluing you together goes away. You&rsquo;re gonna have to assess</p>
<p>Are we actually compatible? That&rsquo;s just a whole perspective. I wanted to throw at you around</p>
<p>Friendship because a lot of people aren&rsquo;t really aware of that. That&rsquo;s not really much about outgrowing people</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just one situation where it&rsquo;s okay to leave people behind. It&rsquo;s okay to close that chapter</p>
<p>of your life and</p>
<p>someone can go from like in your day-to-day life to not in your life barely at all and you text and you talk on the</p>
<p>Phone every once in a while a couple months, whatever like if she ever called me and needed me, I&rsquo;m there</p>
<p>We still have that loyalty and that like love for each other. I</p>
<p>Fucking cherish her. She&rsquo;s like the sweetest heart I&rsquo;ve ever met</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t have compatible lives one the age thing to now the distance</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s so many things that have happened like we weren&rsquo;t compatible like to be bestie booze</p>
<p>But when we had that thing, we were working toward together. It was easy to be bestie booze. You feel me?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just something I want to throw out</p>
<p>Alright, so let&rsquo;s really talk about outgrowing people like for real. So as you have new goals or new desires</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to completely change the way you&rsquo;re living your life and if you&rsquo;re friends with someone and</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re living a certain way and then you have a desire for a new thing or you set a new goal</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to completely change everything about your life</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna give you my personal example of when I started my business and when I started my app positive focus</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>literally</p>
<p>Fucked me up</p>
<p>Psychologically many reasons but I went from having so many friends and such a big social life</p>
<p>to none like I&rsquo;ve I had a big period of my life where I was isolated heavily and then I</p>
<p>Started like I was in a really really bad spot like mentally and what I was dealing with in life</p>
<p>Like I had a lot of shit going on that I couldn&rsquo;t manage at the time</p>
<p>I learned how to manage it eventually, but while I was going through it</p>
<p>I was rolling every fucking weekend like just partying my life away drinking non-stop</p>
<p>Just trying to escape my fucking feelings in my reality and the people I bonded with the people were like my party friends</p>
<p>Were people I saw all the time. I saw them frequently because we were all running from shit</p>
<p>We were all trying to escape our reality</p>
<p>We were all just trying to like feel better and not feel for a second</p>
<p>So when I had the idea to start my app, it required me to change everything about my life. Like I had to stop</p>
<p>partying stop drinking stop drug and stop everything because it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>Expensive to do that shit and I needed to save as much money as possible to put it into my app because my app was</p>
<p>Like $25,000 from start to finish to get everything done and I&rsquo;m gonna make a podcast episode eventually about everything</p>
<p>I wish I knew about business</p>
<p>Before I started my businesses because I can save you a lot of fucking money and a lot of fucking time and headache and heartbreak</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about my biggest heartbreak with like business, too</p>
<p>But when I decided to invest in my app, I was like I need to save as much as possible</p>
<p>I was not like rolling in fucking dough</p>
<p>I literally was like very budgeted very tight</p>
<p>But I was spending any money I had on like</p>
<p>Partying and escaping my fucking life because I didn&rsquo;t want to fucking live it</p>
<p>so my new goal of creating this app and starting this business I had to completely change who I was and how I was</p>
<p>Living and I stopped partying. I stopped going out to eat literally didn&rsquo;t go out to eat for like four months</p>
<p>Stop doing fucking anything and any free time</p>
<p>I had was spent working on the app having it developed thinking about things meetings</p>
<p>Conferences all this fucking shit. Like it&rsquo;s I thought there was so much more that went into an app and I made it so</p>
<p>Fucking difficult for myself, but it&rsquo;s good because it did kind of like save me from like the lifestyle I was in</p>
<p>But I had to change everything and what bonded me to people I had to stop doing</p>
<p>I was no longer in these places hanging around with these people because what I wanted was over here. It was not over here</p>
<p>This is where all my friends were. So for me to go in this direction</p>
<p>of course, we&rsquo;re gonna split and I look at that as outgrowing people because</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>did</p>
<p>But the moment that I split and went after my goals</p>
<p>I went from having all these friends to having nothing and like no one around me and the worst part of it was</p>
<p>The reason I felt so alone with it is because these people did not understand my goals and what I was trying to do</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t understand my discipline</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t understand how much I had to invest and what it was gonna take for me to build what I wanted to build</p>
<p>They just didn&rsquo;t get it. Like their brain was not thinking in that direction. They couldn&rsquo;t fathom the idea</p>
<p>They just they never tried to like throw around ideas and shit and never act on it never do anything</p>
<p>Like when I have an idea I act on it and when I say I&rsquo;m gonna act on it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already five steps into it before I tell anybody but basically they just didn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>What I was doing and why I was changing my life so much and why I was choosing to do the things that I was</p>
<p>Choosing to do instead of hanging out with them and party with them. Like they just saw oh, we&rsquo;re having fun</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re friends. We&rsquo;re so close. We&rsquo;re tight. We have fun every weekend, whatever</p>
<p>but the weekend leads into Thursday plus Friday plus Saturday and then we&rsquo;ll go to brunch on fucking Sunday and then</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little Sunday fun day</p>
<p>It gets a four fucking day party week</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t do that and build a business at the same time</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m sure you could but it was not gonna be up to my standard of excellence for myself</p>
<p>So I quit all that shit. So these friends that I have</p>
<p>Genuinely did not understand what I was doing and I couldn&rsquo;t expect them to like I didn&rsquo;t know if it was gonna work</p>
<p>I was just taking a fucking like shot in the dark and I was kind of faced at a crossroads</p>
<p>It felt like where I had to choose</p>
<p>going for my goal and starting my business starting my app and like doing all my shit over here or go down this road of</p>
<p>these friends and this partying lifestyle that I know was empty and</p>
<p>Was just an escape like I was there was never anything good gonna come from it</p>
<p>and that is one of the biggest moments that you know, you&rsquo;ve outgrown someone is when you feel like you have to sacrifice your goals or</p>
<p>Hold yourself back in order to have them in your life when you feel like that</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve outgrown them. It&rsquo;s time to take some space</p>
<p>Leave them the fuck be allow them to do their thing</p>
<p>You silently go fucking do your shit and you shut up and you fucking stay on track</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hold yourself back for nobody</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s one of the biggest ways I found to know you&rsquo;ve outgrown someone is when I feel like it&rsquo;s my goals or my friendship</p>
<p>With you and to spend time with you is gonna hold me back from what I want</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you know, it&rsquo;s time to do some sorting out and add some distance</p>
<p>But all of that is just like a mindset growth like there&rsquo;s no actual like growth that&rsquo;s happened yet</p>
<p>When you have the idea and you start going in your new direction</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>another way to know that you&rsquo;ve truly outgrown someone is</p>
<p>After I went down this road of like doing my business for six months and like not going out to eat not doing shit</p>
<p>Isolating myself not partying barely seeing these fucking people. I was so different mentally and</p>
<p>When I met this group of people we were all right here. We were all buddy-buddy</p>
<p>We were on the same level the same page. We thought the same we were dealing with the same shit and</p>
<p>Six months time had passed. I had grown I had educated myself. I had been doing other shit. I completely changed my identity</p>
<p>I completely changed the way that I was living. I was on a different level now and</p>
<p>When I went back one night to hang out with everyone and like go out and just party</p>
<p>I was like, I just fucking grinded for like six months</p>
<p>I want to go relax and fucking have some goddamn shots and like party my ass off</p>
<p>I went back to hang out with these people. I saw the disconnect like I felt it. I no longer resonated with it</p>
<p>I no longer understood</p>
<p>Them and the way they were looking at shit</p>
<p>Like I had like broken out of that perspective and that mindset and like climbed a flight of fucking stairs</p>
<p>I just felt like such a disconnect from them and that&rsquo;s gonna happen when you feel such a drastic disconnect</p>
<p>With people that you used to hang out with and the new you that&rsquo;s another big sign</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve outgrown them like it&rsquo;s not a shady fucking thing. It&rsquo;s not mean it&rsquo;s not rude</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you have different goals. You have different priorities</p>
<p>I just want to say you&rsquo;re fully allowed to do this like you&rsquo;re allowed to outgrow people</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed to outgrow friends don&rsquo;t have guilt for it</p>
<p>like I know I repeating myself because I said it&rsquo;s in the beginning, but</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just what I wish someone would have told me is it&rsquo;s okay to grow</p>
<p>Even if it hurts people and let me elaborate a little bit about me saying that like it&rsquo;s okay to grow even if it hurts</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>Because when you start leveling up and you start growing like when I went back and I was hanging out with these friends again after</p>
<p>Not seeing them for a long time</p>
<p>Like I went and leveled up and changed and then I went back and hung out with them</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t interested in the shit. They were talking about. I wasn&rsquo;t interested in the shit that they were doing. I didn&rsquo;t see them as like</p>
<p>Cool people like I once did I didn&rsquo;t respect them. I had no</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t give a fuck to be around them and people can feel that people can literally sense it like people</p>
<p>you know when someone doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck about what you&rsquo;re saying and you know when someone is just like</p>
<p>Like indifferent toward you so</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve grown and leveled up if you try and keep forcing yourself to be around people</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna kind of drive a wedge between you because they&rsquo;re gonna feel it. They&rsquo;re gonna feel the shift</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna feel that you&rsquo;ve lost interest. You don&rsquo;t respect them. You don&rsquo;t care about them</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re gonna think like it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s not a good feeling when there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>Verbalization of it because they&rsquo;re not gonna get it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like your behavior and your attitude is just gonna change and they&rsquo;re left to wonder what switch</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if someone just all of a sudden change how they were acting toward you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be like what the fuck you might get insecure. You might get worried about it, but also</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not nice to yourself to force yourself to go hang out with people and be around people that</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be around</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t have anything in common with someone if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Genuinely enjoy their company if you&rsquo;re just doing it out of like guilt or pity because you feel bad</p>
<p>Like ah, like I have to fucking go be around this friend</p>
<p>Even though they drain the fuck out of me if people drain you and you constantly force yourself to go be around them</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opposite of a self-loving behavior</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say that but you could do whatever you want because some situations you have to granted like you there are certain situations</p>
<p>Where like it is warranted you do need to like go be around certain people even if they feel like they&rsquo;re draining you</p>
<p>But to choose it just to not hurt the other person</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hurting them with your presence because you&rsquo;re treating them different without realizing it</p>
<p>So that makes sense</p>
<p>Like I want to set you free from if you&rsquo;re scared to cut off a certain person or spend less time with a certain person</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re damned if you do and you&rsquo;re damned if you don&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like putting yourself at war with yourself and you&rsquo;re treating them different without realizing like you&rsquo;re gonna hurt them one way or another</p>
<p>So do what&rsquo;s best for both of you because no one likes to be around someone that looks at them</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t give a fuck what they have to say</p>
<p>like I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be around someone that didn&rsquo;t feel like was interested in me or cared about what I had to say and</p>
<p>like wanted to be in my company and</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t force yourself to be around someone and waste your time with someone you don&rsquo;t want to be around it might feel bad</p>
<p>To cut it</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the best situation for both of you to do that and there are gonna be situations where you start</p>
<p>seeing the world different and you start like butting heads with people and having fights and shit and if you notice that</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see things the same as a friend anymore</p>
<p>Like y&rsquo;all are arguing a lot or you&rsquo;re just not seeing eye-to-eye about shit and you just keep bickering</p>
<p>You can agree to just take some space like okay, don&rsquo;t get mad. Don&rsquo;t freak out. Just be like we&rsquo;re not seeing eye-to-eye</p>
<p>Maybe we just need to take some time and like go do our own thing for a minute and then we can readdress this later</p>
<p>But like I know you&rsquo;re tired of the fighting and I know you&rsquo;re tired of the constant disagreements in the bickering</p>
<p>But I think what&rsquo;s best is just for us to take a minute and like go our separate ways get a breather and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t care about you. I don&rsquo;t love you</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re both do we both just need to like respect each other agree to disagree for a minute and then</p>
<p>Part and just see what happens like I&rsquo;m not cutting you off because I&rsquo;m mad at you</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s both. It&rsquo;s stressing both of us out and it&rsquo;s fucking up both of our happiness. So let&rsquo;s just agree to</p>
<p>Kind of do our own thing for a minute. That&rsquo;s a good way to go about that situation</p>
<p>Okay, so the next situation is kind of how to navigate all this like wrapped up in one because it&rsquo;s easy to</p>
<p>deal with outgrowing people who are kind of like just party friends or</p>
<p>superficial friends that you don&rsquo;t really connect with or you&rsquo;re not very very close to</p>
<p>When you have someone you&rsquo;re very close to and you outgrow them. That is a motherfucking disaster</p>
<p>Oh my god for many reasons that I&rsquo;m gonna unpack it all</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna give you example from my life and then tell you kind of what happened</p>
<p>But I had a friend basically who I used to just talk shit with like we would just vent</p>
<p>We would literally just sit down for hours and just bitch and whine and complain about our life and how things were so fucked up</p>
<p>and how people were so fucked up and we would just complain and it was like my venting friend and I was going through a</p>
<p>lot of shit that woke me up and</p>
<p>The more I like got perspective and the more I grew and became aware</p>
<p>The more I realized motherfucker, you&rsquo;re responsible for your life</p>
<p>Like yeah, these circumstances might have been shitty</p>
<p>But look at how you contributed and look at how you reacted and how you handled it</p>
<p>You have a part to play too. You&rsquo;re not just this fucking victim, you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never played the role of the victim</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>like I did a little like I was so like</p>
<p>Giving my power away and not like grabbing life by its fucking nuts and making it what the fuck I want to make it</p>
<p>I decided to do that</p>
<p>I decided to stop making excuses and stop bullshitting and just take everything for what it was</p>
<p>Except this is what it is. This is what&rsquo;s happened. Now. What am I gonna do? That&rsquo;s my biggest thing</p>
<p>Okay, all this happened</p>
<p>What am I gonna do now and it puts you back in your place of power and then you can decide what to do</p>
<p>It brings you back to the moment. You&rsquo;re not dwelling on the past of what could have put different</p>
<p>What wasn&rsquo;t your control what fucked you over what wasn&rsquo;t fair?</p>
<p>What fuck all that get in the place of presence and the power you have right now by saying?</p>
<p>Okay, what now what am I gonna do now and make your fucking decision to keep moving forward?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a time to reflect but it&rsquo;s not fucking that fast. It&rsquo;s not like all the time</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to fucking reflect all the goddamn time. You don&rsquo;t need to sit around and vent and complain and whine</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a waste of time</p>
<p>so I had this giant mental shift and</p>
<p>I looked at complaining as a waste of time because what I wanted to do was act I wanted to change my fucking life</p>
<p>and change shit, so I had this giant mental shift and</p>
<p>The person that I was friends with did not so I switched my entire outlook on life and the way that I behaved</p>
<p>Again like the other situation was starting the business, but it was just like an internal shift</p>
<p>So just the way that I would have conversations the way that I would perceive the world and look at things</p>
<p>No longer matched with this person. I used to vent with so when this person wanted to vent I got fucking annoyed</p>
<p>I felt like I was wasting my time. I didn&rsquo;t want to hear that fucking shit</p>
<p>All I saw was excuses and I no longer accepted excuses from myself</p>
<p>So I did have like a judgmental attitude of this person</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like just shut the fuck up. Like why are you sitting here whining about it?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s brainstorm some ways to fix it or help the situation. Like what can we do now?</p>
<p>What can we say, you know, like let&rsquo;s fucking fix the shit or shut the fuck up and let&rsquo;s just move forward</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>Like I had this giant shift and it completely like I handled it so wrong and I was trying to explain to this friend</p>
<p>Like the new realizations I had the new perspective shifts that I had what I was gonna start doing how I was looking at situations</p>
<p>And it just wasn&rsquo;t working. It was like we were butting heads and every time they would talk</p>
<p>I no longer agreed with some of the shit that they said I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s closed-minded as fuck</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t get it and that&rsquo;s not the fucking way to go about it</p>
<p>But that was a giant situation where I outgrew someone and it was very painful because this person I was very close with and I</p>
<p>had a lot of guilt because I felt like mentally I was leaving them behind and then physically I</p>
<p>Stopped doing the same shit. Like I was no longer just sitting on the couch venting with them anymore</p>
<p>I was up working doing shit and like changing my life. So I stopped spending so much time with them and</p>
<p>I felt really bad for it because I left them mentally</p>
<p>They were still locked in that perspective and I unlocked it and got out like I&rsquo;m in a whole new perspective a whole new reality</p>
<p>mentally and then I was in a whole new life like I was living a physical life that was so different and I did leave</p>
<p>them behind and</p>
<p>Whenever they would talk to me</p>
<p>I was looking at them like just judging them because I&rsquo;m like you don&rsquo;t fucking get it and you&rsquo;re making fucking excuses</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Shake someone you can&rsquo;t rip someone&rsquo;s eyes open</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make people see shit if you try to explain it and you feel yourself getting frustrated</p>
<p>Stop stop bucket explaining people are so resistant to seeing certain things. You can&rsquo;t wake them the fuck up</p>
<p>do not feel bad if</p>
<p>you have to split or like go separate ways, but this person started to feel like I was fighting them and I was against them and</p>
<p>They genuinely felt left behind and a lot of people</p>
<p>Especially if they have a negative reaction</p>
<p>Toward you like if you have this new goal</p>
<p>It is new thing you&rsquo;re working on or working toward if someone has a negative reaction to it. They feel left behind</p>
<p>They feel discarded</p>
<p>They feel like you&rsquo;re too good for them now, and that&rsquo;s one thing a lot of people will say is</p>
<p>Oh, you think you&rsquo;re too good for everybody now, bitch</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just insecure not once that I fucking say anything like that</p>
<p>you know people are gonna have their own insecurities people are gonna see you leveling up and changing your life and doing shit that they</p>
<p>wish they could do and</p>
<p>when they see you living a whole different perspective and just feeling different, they&rsquo;re gonna get jealous and</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna feel more hopeless because you just left them where they were where you used to be</p>
<p>They just saw you get out. So of course they feel left behind they feel abandoned</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna fuck with anybody like there&rsquo;s a lot more that goes on deeper without growing people and why they have such</p>
<p>strange and like</p>
<p>Sometimes intense reactions. There&rsquo;s so much more going on there than just Oh algorithm. They&rsquo;re just better</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to see me do good. No, they&rsquo;re dealing with their own shit</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re feeling that you just doing good reflects them</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re feeling inside and most of the times their reaction is based off of what they&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>But a lot of people are like I&rsquo;m trying to do better for myself and you&rsquo;re being negative</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ruining the experience</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m gonna check you</p>
<p>Alright</p>
<p>Because you need to understand the situation and the reality of what you&rsquo;re doing to this friend</p>
<p>when you outgrow them the way that I did it with my friend that I used to vent with and the way that I</p>
<p>used to just like</p>
<p>Judge them and I was kind of like harsh and mean that was not the fucking way to go about it</p>
<p>Like you have to wake up to the fact of like you are leaving this person</p>
<p>Mentally or physically like whatever it is. This person&rsquo;s gonna feel abandoned this purse</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna fuck with anybody to have that happen</p>
<p>Imagine somebody outgrew you and just went on with their life and you saw them doing so good without you</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna make you feel like fucking dog shit. So don&rsquo;t attack the people</p>
<p>That you feel like you&rsquo;re outgrowing set boundaries with them</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna try and keep them in your life set boundaries with them of like, okay, this is time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dedicating to this every day if I&rsquo;m not as like</p>
<p>Attentive and like hanging out with you as much this is why I&rsquo;m doing XYZ like explain just give an explanation of</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing and why you&rsquo;re not spending time with them so much and this is the biggest part where I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna check everybody and teach you how to be a good fucking friend because I learned by fucking this up</p>
<p>so if you have your priorities change or your outlook change or</p>
<p>Anything that you want to change about your life and start doing different</p>
<p>Fucking communicate it to the person if you&rsquo;re close with someone and you feel like you&rsquo;re outgrowing them</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s a friend parent</p>
<p>Anybody if you feel like you&rsquo;re outgrowing them</p>
<p>you need to communicate that things have shifted inside of you and what you plan to do different and give them the fucking</p>
<p>Reassurance that they have not done anything wrong</p>
<p>You have to explain that there is simply just a difference of compatibility</p>
<p>Like what you want to do and give explanation that you&rsquo;re gonna do it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not up for discussion if you are or aren&rsquo;t gonna pursue your goals. You&rsquo;re fucking doing it</p>
<p>okay, so one way I go about this now is</p>
<p>if I notice that I&rsquo;m gonna start doing a lot of shit different and it&rsquo;s gonna make me have to stop spending so much time</p>
<p>With someone or certain people I give them a heads up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, hey, just letting you know if I seem distant in the future or like soon</p>
<p>I want to give you the assurance that it&rsquo;s not anything to do with you. I just have these couple of projects</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on so I&rsquo;m gonna be very busy. Like I&rsquo;m gonna be very very</p>
<p>Focused and driven. That&rsquo;s where all my time is gonna be. I don&rsquo;t want you to think you&rsquo;ve done anything wrong</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you to think I&rsquo;m mad at you</p>
<p>I just want to let you know</p>
<p>Like this is what&rsquo;s about to happen</p>
<p>make it about your new goal and give them the peace of mind that you&rsquo;re not just abandoning them and just</p>
<p>Pulling back and the big thing I said about I want to give you the reassurance that I&rsquo;m not mad at you</p>
<p>I want you to promise them be like my silence does not mean I&rsquo;m mad at you</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t hear from me for a couple days or whatever like it just means I&rsquo;m very busy</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m mad at you</p>
<p>I want to go ahead and set that up and give that to you now that give you that peace of mind if</p>
<p>Anything ever happens where I am upset I will talk to you</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want you to take my silence as like an attack or make it mean that something is like you&rsquo;ve done something wrong</p>
<p>Or something&rsquo;s gone wrong. I want you to have like peace that I&rsquo;m gonna like be distracted for a minute and</p>
<p>That will do more than you fucking think it&rsquo;s really gonna give people a way to like</p>
<p>Learn to live without you like you&rsquo;re gonna it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a way to kind of drift apart</p>
<p>Without going to someone and being like look, I don&rsquo;t want to be friends with you no more</p>
<p>You can totally do that</p>
<p>If you feel like that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s necessary if you feel like someone is holding you back set boundaries around what you&rsquo;re doing and</p>
<p>push them out or</p>
<p>You can just go go about it and just say hey, I don&rsquo;t wanna be friends no more</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go do my shit you do your shit. Bye, but I do recommend giving explanation because</p>
<p>imagine your friend all of a sudden just</p>
<p>Starts being busy all the time and they start</p>
<p>Doing other things with other people and all their attention is on other shit</p>
<p>And you just they don&rsquo;t have any interest in checking in on you. They don&rsquo;t ask to hang out</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like do anything. Imagine your friend did that to you. You would start second-guessing fucking everything</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be in your head. You&rsquo;d be insecure. You&rsquo;d be worried. Are they mad at me? Do they not like me anymore?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel good for someone to just pull away from you</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re noticing you&rsquo;re growing and you can see that the people closest to you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be around them as much and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re growing apart or you&rsquo;re outgrowing them</p>
<p>Give them some kind of heads up that it&rsquo;s not about them</p>
<p>That is the greatest gift you can give someone is like the mental clarity and reassurance that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with them</p>
<p>Because insecure people will find everything wrong with them if you just leave them and I&rsquo;m someone that that&rsquo;s happened to and</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll like you just save them from taking that fucking knife and sticking it in themselves just</p>
<p>Give them the reassurance that it&rsquo;s not about them</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about you your new goals and what you&rsquo;re gonna be doing and just give them that fucking peace of mind</p>
<p>Be like I still love you. I still care about you</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to catch up and tell you about everything</p>
<p>But I just want to give you a heads up if I seem a little more distant</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it is. If you want to check in on me check in on me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk if I don&rsquo;t text you first all the time</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t get offended. Like I&rsquo;m just really really busy and my focus is like in a hundred different directions. Just give explanation about</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna be happening and what you&rsquo;re noticing don&rsquo;t go to someone and say I&rsquo;ve outgrown you</p>
<p>Okay, don&rsquo;t be a fucking dick</p>
<p>But with that the biggest thing is just give people the reassurance that nothing&rsquo;s gone wrong</p>
<p>Okay, even if you&rsquo;re like looking at them</p>
<p>Like I know I&rsquo;ve fucking outgrown you just give them that because they can&rsquo;t help it if they&rsquo;re not growing too</p>
<p>now if they&rsquo;re giving you shit and they&rsquo;re like berating you and being fucking mean tell them and eat a dick and</p>
<p>Fucking do your thing</p>
<p>but if they&rsquo;re not just be considerate and understand if people are having a negative reaction to you doing other shit and</p>
<p>Spending your time different places. It&rsquo;s not personal. They&rsquo;re not mad at you. Like I said, they feel left behind. They feel insecure</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re worried. They&rsquo;re concerned. They think you don&rsquo;t like them anymore. No one can deal with those feelings easily</p>
<p>They fucking hurt everybody they would hurt the fuck out of me what I react on them</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just very controlled but a lot of people aren&rsquo;t so just understand that if you are outgrowing people and people are like</p>
<p>Attacking you it&rsquo;s not about you might be I don&rsquo;t fucking know your situation</p>
<p>I just want to let you in on the perspective of the other person and kind of like what&rsquo;s going on because I wasn&rsquo;t aware</p>
<p>Of any of this and so I started fucking up friendships. I never fucked nothing up that bad</p>
<p>Okay, I was just a little like inconsiderate like I didn&rsquo;t understand the proper way to navigate it</p>
<p>So this is what I&rsquo;ve learned about it. And if you want to like peacefully just go separate ways with someone</p>
<p>This is the way to fucking do it</p>
<p>like if you just go from talking to someone all the time being close every day spending time together to</p>
<p>Cutting it and like not wanting to be around them. That&rsquo;s gonna be difficult</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna definitely think something&rsquo;s fucking wrong and it&rsquo;s kind of like hard for both of you</p>
<p>so if you wanted to just grow separately start getting busy start having other shit to do and</p>
<p>It will peacefully just allow more distance between you and they&rsquo;ll learn how to deal with the distance like as it grows</p>
<p>Versus if you just split it like it&rsquo;s not gonna feel as like it&rsquo;s such a hole in their life</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna look at you like you&rsquo;ve abandoned them</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve just grown apart</p>
<p>Gracefully and they&rsquo;ve gotten used to</p>
<p>the distance becoming more and more and more if that makes sense like you&rsquo;re teaching them how to live without you and</p>
<p>to fill in the new spots of like what they want to do and</p>
<p>People they want to hang out with like it gives them a chance to like</p>
<p>Gracefully do it if you want to stay on good terms with somebody</p>
<p>But like I said if they&rsquo;re being mean tell them to eat shit and fucking get on your way</p>
<p>But I do want to give you reassurance. You&rsquo;re not a piece of shit. You&rsquo;re not a fuck-up. You&rsquo;re not mean</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not an asshole for growing like being committed to growth</p>
<p>Will hurt those around you as you grow you&rsquo;re going to reflect to people what they are not</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna achieve things that they&rsquo;ve convinced themselves. They can&rsquo;t and when they see you do it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna trigger a lot of shit in them and they might fucking attack you for it</p>
<p>But as you grow prepare for every relationship in your life to be impacted by it</p>
<p>Unless someone is literally committed with you side-by-side to growth me and my sister are both committed to growth</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve both had periods where</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t grow together</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t be in each other&rsquo;s life and grow like we&rsquo;ve had like falling out fucking fights</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on two different pages and we just need to take space take time</p>
<p>But every time we go take space grow on our own when we come back together</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tighter than before it&rsquo;s the same thing with my mom all the times we&rsquo;ve had our like breaks and like come back together</p>
<p>we come back stronger and</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re trying to grow it&rsquo;s like if two plants are trying too hard to grow like next</p>
<p>These are the little fucking leaves are gonna get tangled</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna get all fucked up like you need to go get your space in your garden to go fucking blossom as big as you</p>
<p>Want to get and as wide as you want to be get your fucking leaves everywhere</p>
<p>but like if you&rsquo;re trying to grow with someone it can get like rocky and weird and also</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re with someone who is committed to growth, they&rsquo;ll understand</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna get it</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna understand like the shifts in yourself and the way that you change your fucking life around all of a sudden</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna get it</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re friends with people who are committed to growth are gonna understand and make the process easier for you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be more in touch and more aware of what&rsquo;s going on with themselves. So they&rsquo;re not gonna attack you</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best thing I can fucking recommend is like get people who are with it</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re looking for friends my facebook community everybody in there is with it mentally</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s where we all fucking go to talk shit and hang out and like give each other advice</p>
<p>But having people around you that are also committed to their own growth are gonna understand</p>
<p>Sometimes it goes apart and then you&rsquo;ll come back together or sometimes it just grows apart and you grow in separate directions</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay. So be it and they&rsquo;re gonna support you even though it&rsquo;s sad</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s like heartbreaking to grow apart from someone they&rsquo;re gonna get it</p>
<p>But people that aren&rsquo;t committed to growth people that aren&rsquo;t really aware</p>
<p>Are not gonna get it. They&rsquo;re gonna have a lot harder time</p>
<p>Like having you grow like they&rsquo;re just it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of emotions and a lot of shit fucking everything up</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to talk too much about that. I do want to give you reassurance that</p>
<p>You do not need support</p>
<p>To do what you want to do. You do not need support from others to grow. You don&rsquo;t fucking need anyone</p>
<p>Let me make that very clear</p>
<p>Support is nice to have but you are not dependent on it. You are not crippled by it</p>
<p>You do not need support. You do not need people in your corner</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have people in my corner at certain periods and I still fucking did it</p>
<p>You do not have to have that while it does feel good to have it</p>
<p>It feels good to have your family support you. It feels good to have your friends support you</p>
<p>You can have no one and still get the fuck done</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna suck but that&rsquo;s not a requirement and so many people get so caught up and like when they start growing</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t get it or they don&rsquo;t support their journey. They like hold themselves back from it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, like don&rsquo;t you fucking dare do that to yourself?</p>
<p>You fucking grow through it because on the other side of that is people who are</p>
<p>Also on the other side of that that have grown and who fucking get it like don&rsquo;t be afraid to be alone</p>
<p>Because when you go be by yourself and you transform</p>
<p>And you completely change yourself mentally and like you change the way you behave and live and identify</p>
<p>Who you&rsquo;re gonna be a match to after that is those same fucking people. You&rsquo;re not gonna be isolated for long</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to energetically be a match to new fucking people</p>
<p>But like once you level yourself up, that&rsquo;s now the level you radiate at</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re disconnecting from all these people because you&rsquo;re no longer a fucking match to them</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t experience them in your reality</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not a fucking match like shit&rsquo;s just gonna start fading out shit&rsquo;s just gonna disappear</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna stop thinking of them stop hearing of them. That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s gonna go</p>
<p>You might feel alone until you meet people who are also on this level</p>
<p>You will feel more connected than ever you&rsquo;re gonna feel understood and supported and cared about like</p>
<p>Just trust me. Just goddamn trust me because when I was going through all the shit with my business</p>
<p>And like changing my whole life with that like the friends that I lost</p>
<p>When I isolated myself and I transformed myself</p>
<p>I was a match to new friends who I connected with even fucking deeper and then I kept growing and that group of friends</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still very close to but we don&rsquo;t talk that often. We&rsquo;re not that involved in each other&rsquo;s life because I moved to texas</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>I isolated</p>
<p>Transformed and now the people i&rsquo;m friends with in texas</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it like it&rsquo;s even deeper connections than before. It&rsquo;s like every time you isolate and you level up</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be a match to new people on that same level and it&rsquo;s just gonna keep happening over and over</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad every time you outgrow people</p>
<p>But you do get used to the natural progression of people coming in and out of your life</p>
<p>Like growth is normal. It is normal to progress and to grow</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna grow with people you&rsquo;re gonna grow out of people it&rsquo;s just how it&rsquo;s gonna fucking go</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s normal and you&rsquo;re gonna feel to the emotions. You&rsquo;re gonna be fine, but do not ever hold yourself the fuck back</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>anyone</p>
<p>Trust no one</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not worth it</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s worth holding yourself back for unless it&rsquo;s a child unless you have a child</p>
<p>Your life comes second and we&rsquo;ve talked about that once you bring a child into this world. They&rsquo;re your number one</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not i&rsquo;m not gonna go too much into that. I&rsquo;m very opinionated about it</p>
<p>But i&rsquo;m gonna shut the fuck up and leave it there</p>
<p>All of my links will be in the description if you want to download my app positive focus</p>
