    <p>The following is a conversation with Jamie Metzl,</p>
<p>author specializing in topics of genetic engineering,</p>
<p>biotechnology, and geopolitics.</p>
<p>In the past two years, he has been outspoken</p>
<p>about the need to investigate and keep an open mind</p>
<p>about the origins of COVID 19.</p>
<p>In particular, he has been keeping an extensive</p>
<p>up to date collection of circumstantial evidence</p>
<p>in support of what is colloquially known</p>
<p>as lab leak hypothesis that COVID 19 leaked in 2019</p>
<p>from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>In part, I wanted to explore the idea</p>
<p>in response to the thoughtful criticism</p>
<p>to parts of the Francis Collins episode.</p>
<p>I will have more and more difficult conversations like this</p>
<p>with people from all walks of life</p>
<p>and with all kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>I promise to do my best to keep an open mind</p>
<p>and yet to ask hard questions</p>
<p>while together searching for the beautiful</p>
<p>and the inspiring in the mind of the other person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard line to walk gracefully,</p>
<p>especially for someone like me,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a bit of an awkward introvert</p>
<p>with barely the grasp of the English language</p>
<p>or any language, except maybe Python and C++.</p>
<p>But I hope you stick around, be patient and empathetic</p>
<p>and maybe learn something new together with me.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Jamie Metzl.</p>
<p>What is the probability in your mind</p>
<p>that COVID 19 leaked from a lab?</p>
<p>In your write up, I believe you said 85%.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s just a percentage.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t really be exact with these kinds of things,</p>
<p>but it gives us a sense where your mind is,</p>
<p>where your intuition is.</p>
<p>So as it stands today, what would you say is that probability?</p>
<p>I would stand by what I&rsquo;ve been saying</p>
<p>since really the middle of last year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more likely and not, in my opinion,</p>
<p>that the pandemic stems</p>
<p>from an accidental lab incident in Wuhan.</p>
<p>Is it 90%, is it 65%, I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of arbitrary.</p>
<p>But when I stack up all of the available evidence</p>
<p>and all of it on both sides is circumstantial,</p>
<p>it weighs very significantly toward a lab incident origin.</p>
<p>So before we dive into the specifics at a high level,</p>
<p>what types of evidence, what intuition, what ideas</p>
<p>are leading you to have that kind of estimate?</p>
<p>Is it possible to kind of condense,</p>
<p>when you look at the wall of evidence before you,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s your source, the strongest source of your intuition?</p>
<p>And I would have to say it&rsquo;s just logic</p>
<p>and deductive reasoning.</p>
<p>So before I make the case for why I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s most likely a lab incident origin,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say why it could be,</p>
<p>and still could be a natural origin.</p>
<p>All of this is a natural origin in the sense</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a bat virus backbone, horseshoe bat virus backbone.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m gonna keep pausing you to define stuff.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s useful to say, what do we mean by lab leak?</p>
<p>What do we mean by natural origin?</p>
<p>What do we mean by virus backbone?</p>
<p>Okay, great questions.</p>
<p>So viruses come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Viruses have been around for 3.5 billion years,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been around for such a long time</p>
<p>because they are adaptive and they&rsquo;re growing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re always changing and they&rsquo;re morphing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why viruses are,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve been very successful and we are our victims.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;re beneficiaries.</p>
<p>We have viral DNA has morphed into our genomes,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s certainly in the case of COVID 19,</p>
<p>we are victims of the success of viruses.</p>
<p>And so when we talk about a backbone,</p>
<p>so the SARS CoV2 virus, it has a history</p>
<p>and these viruses don&rsquo;t come out of whole cloth.</p>
<p>There are viruses that morph.</p>
<p>And so we know that at some period,</p>
<p>maybe 20 years ago or whatever,</p>
<p>the virus that is SARS CoV2 existed in horseshoe bats.</p>
<p>It was a horseshoe bat virus and it evolved somewhere.</p>
<p>And there are some people who say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no evidence of this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a plausible theory</p>
<p>based on how things have happened in the past.</p>
<p>Maybe that virus jumped from the horseshoe bat</p>
<p>through some intermediate species.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a bat</p>
<p>and that it infects some other animal.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a pig or a raccoon dog or a civet cat.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all pangolin.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all sorts of animals that have been considered.</p>
<p>And then that virus adapts into that new host</p>
<p>and it changes and grows.</p>
<p>And then according to the quote unquote</p>
<p>natural origins hypothesis,</p>
<p>it jumps from that animal into humans.</p>
<p>And so what you could imagine</p>
<p>and some of the people who are making the case,</p>
<p>all of the people actually,</p>
<p>who are making the case for a natural origin of the virus,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying is it went from bat</p>
<p>to some intermediate species.</p>
<p>And then from that intermediate species, most likely,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some people who say it went directly bat to human,</p>
<p>but through some intermediate species.</p>
<p>And then humans interacted with that species.</p>
<p>And then it jumped from that, whatever it is to humans.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very plausible theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that there&rsquo;s no evidence for it.</p>
<p>And the nature of the interaction is,</p>
<p>do most people kind of suggest this at the wet markets?</p>
<p>So the interaction of the humans with the animal</p>
<p>is in the form of it&rsquo;s either a live animal</p>
<p>as being sold to be eaten or a recently live animal,</p>
<p>but newly dead animal being sold to be eaten.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly one very possible possibility,</p>
<p>a possible possibility, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a word.</p>
<p>But the people who believe in the wet market origin,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>So they had one of these animals,</p>
<p>they were cutting it up, let&rsquo;s say, in a market</p>
<p>and maybe some of the blood got into somebody&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>maybe had a cut on their hand or maybe it was aerosolized</p>
<p>and so somebody breathed it.</p>
<p>And then that virus found this new host</p>
<p>and that was the human host.</p>
<p>But you could also have that happen in, let&rsquo;s say, a farm.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s happened in the past that let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>that there are farms and because of human encroachment</p>
<p>into wild spaces, we&rsquo;re pushing our farms</p>
<p>and our animal farms further and further</p>
<p>into what used to be just natural habitats.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s happened in the past, for example,</p>
<p>that there were bats roosting over pig pens</p>
<p>and the bat droppings went into the pig pens.</p>
<p>The viruses in those droppings infected the pigs</p>
<p>and then the pigs infected the humans.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a plausible theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that there&rsquo;s basically no evidence for it.</p>
<p>If it was the case that SARS CoV2 comes from this type</p>
<p>of interaction, as in most of the at least recent</p>
<p>past outbreaks, we&rsquo;d see evidence of that.</p>
<p>Viruses are messy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly undergoing Darwinian evolution</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re changing and it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re just ready</p>
<p>for prime time, ready to infect humans on day one.</p>
<p>Normally you can trace the viral evolution prior</p>
<p>to the time when it infects humans.</p>
<p>But for SARS CoV2, it just showed up on the scene</p>
<p>ready to infect humans.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no history that anybody has found so far</p>
<p>of that kind of viral evolution.</p>
<p>With the first SARS, you could track it</p>
<p>by the genome sequencing that it was experimenting.</p>
<p>And SARS CoV2 was very, very stable,</p>
<p>meaning it had already adapted to humans</p>
<p>by the time it interacted with us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fully adapted.</p>
<p>So with SARS, there&rsquo;s a rapid evolution</p>
<p>when it first kind of hooks onto a human.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s trying.</p>
<p>Like a virus, its goal is to survive and replicate.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, we&rsquo;re gonna try this.</p>
<p>Oh, that didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll try it exactly like a startup.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t see that.</p>
<p>And so there are some people who say,</p>
<p>well, one hypothesis is you have a totally isolated</p>
<p>group of humans, maybe in Southern China,</p>
<p>which is more than a thousand miles away from Wuhan.</p>
<p>And maybe they&rsquo;re doing their animal farming</p>
<p>right next to these areas where there are these horseshoe bats.</p>
<p>And maybe in this totally isolated place</p>
<p>that no one&rsquo;s ever heard of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not connected to any other place,</p>
<p>one person gets infected.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t spread to anybody else</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so isolated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine that this is the case.</p>
<p>Then somebody gets in a car and drives all night,</p>
<p>more than a thousand miles through crappy roads</p>
<p>to get to Wuhan, doesn&rsquo;t stop for anything,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t infect anybody on the way.</p>
<p>No one else in that person&rsquo;s village infects anyone.</p>
<p>And then that person goes straight</p>
<p>to the Huanan seafood market,</p>
<p>according to this, in my mind, not very credible theory,</p>
<p>and then unloads his stuff and everybody gets infected.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re only delivering those animals</p>
<p>to the Wuhan market, which doesn&rsquo;t even sell very many</p>
<p>of these kinds of animals</p>
<p>that are likely intermediate species and not anywhere else.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s a little bit of a straw man,</p>
<p>but on top of that, the Chinese have sequenced</p>
<p>more than 80,000 animal samples,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no evidence of this type of viral evolution</p>
<p>that we would otherwise expect.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to, at this moment, steel man the argument</p>
<p>for the natural origin of the virus.</p>
<p>So just to clarify, so Wuhan is actually,</p>
<p>despite what it might sound like to people,</p>
<p>is a pretty big city.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that live in it.</p>
<p>11 million.</p>
<p>So not only is there, at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other centers that do work on viruses,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a giant number of markets.</p>
<p>And everything we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>is pretty close together.</p>
<p>So when I kind of look at the geography of this,</p>
<p>I think when you zoom out, it&rsquo;s all Wuhan,</p>
<p>but when you zoom in,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a lot of interesting dynamics</p>
<p>that could be happening and what the cases are popping up</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s being reported, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So I think the people that argue for the natural origin,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a few recent papers</p>
<p>that come out arguing this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating to watch this whole thing,</p>
<p>but I think what they&rsquo;re arguing</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s this Hunan market</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the major markets, the wet markets in Wuhan,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a bunch of cases</p>
<p>that were reported from there.</p>
<p>So if I look at, for example,</p>
<p>the Michael Warby perspective that he wrote in Science,</p>
<p>he argues, he wrote this a few days ago,</p>
<p>the predominance of early COVID cases linked to Hunan market,</p>
<p>and this can&rsquo;t be dismissed as ascertainment bias,</p>
<p>which I think is what people argue,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just kind of focusing on this region</p>
<p>because a lot of cases came,</p>
<p>but there could be a huge number of other cases.</p>
<p>So people who argue against this</p>
<p>say that this is a later stage already.</p>
<p>So he says no, he says this is the epicenter,</p>
<p>and this is a clear evidence, circumstantial evidence,</p>
<p>but evidence nevertheless</p>
<p>that this is where the jump happened to humans,</p>
<p>the big explosion, maybe not case zero,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he argues that, but the early cases.</p>
<p>So what do you make of this whole idea?</p>
<p>Can you steel man it before we talk about the alternative?</p>
<p>And my goal here isn&rsquo;t to attack people on the other side,</p>
<p>and my feeling is if there is evidence that&rsquo;s presented</p>
<p>that should change my view,</p>
<p>I hope that I&rsquo;ll be open minded enough to change my view.</p>
<p>And certainly Michael Warby is a thoughtful person,</p>
<p>a respected scientist,</p>
<p>and I think this work is contributive work,</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s as significant</p>
<p>as has been reported in the press.</p>
<p>And so what his argument is,</p>
<p>is that there is an early cluster in December of 2019</p>
<p>around the Huanan seafood market.</p>
<p>And even though he himself argues</p>
<p>that the original breakthrough case,</p>
<p>the original case, the index case</p>
<p>where the first person infected happened earlier,</p>
<p>happened in October or November, so not in December.</p>
<p>His argument is, well, what are the odds</p>
<p>that you would have this number, this cluster of cases</p>
<p>in the Huanan seafood market,</p>
<p>and if the origin happened someplace else,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you expect other clusters?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not an entirely implausible argument,</p>
<p>but there are reasons why I think</p>
<p>that this is not nearly as determinative</p>
<p>as has been reported.</p>
<p>And I certainly had a lot of,</p>
<p>I and others had tweeted a lot about this.</p>
<p>And that is first, the people who were infected</p>
<p>in this cluster, it&rsquo;s not the earliest known virus</p>
<p>of the SARS CoV2, it began mutating.</p>
<p>So this is, it&rsquo;s not the original SARS CoV2 there.</p>
<p>So it had to have happened someplace else.</p>
<p>Two, the people who were infected in the market</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t infected in the part of the market</p>
<p>where they had these kinds of animals</p>
<p>that are considered to be candidates</p>
<p>as an intermediary species.</p>
<p>And third, there was a bias,</p>
<p>and actually I&rsquo;ll have four things.</p>
<p>Third, there was a bias in the early assessment in China</p>
<p>of what they were looking for.</p>
<p>They were asked, did you have exposure to the market?</p>
<p>Because I think in the early days</p>
<p>when people were figuring things out,</p>
<p>that was one of the questions that was asked.</p>
<p>And fourth, and probably most significantly,</p>
<p>we have so little information</p>
<p>about those early cases in China,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really unfortunate.</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;ll talk about this later</p>
<p>because the Chinese government is preventing access</p>
<p>to all of that information, which they have,</p>
<p>which could easily help us get to the bottom,</p>
<p>at least know a ton more about how this pandemic started.</p>
<p>And so this is, it&rsquo;s like grasping at straws</p>
<p>in the dark with gloves on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But to steel man the argument,</p>
<p>we have this evidence from this market,</p>
<p>and yes, the Chinese government</p>
<p>has turned off the lights essentially,</p>
<p>so we have very little data to work with,</p>
<p>but this is the data we have.</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s to say that this data</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t represent a much bigger data set</p>
<p>that a lot of people got infected at this market</p>
<p>where even at the parts, or especially at the parts</p>
<p>where the infected meat was being sold?</p>
<p>So that could be true, and it probably is true.</p>
<p>The question is, is this the source?</p>
<p>Is this the place where this began?</p>
<p>Or was this just a place where it was amplified?</p>
<p>And I certainly think that it&rsquo;s extremely likely</p>
<p>that the Huanan seafood market was a point of amplification.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just answering a different question.</p>
<p>Basically what you&rsquo;re saying is it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to use the market as evidence for anything</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s probably not even the starting point.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a good place for it to continue spreading.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly my view.</p>
<p>What Michael Warby&rsquo;s argument is, Marco, is that,</p>
<p>well, what are the odds of that?</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re seeing this amplification in the market.</p>
<p>And if we, let me put it this way.</p>
<p>If we had all of the information,</p>
<p>if the Chinese government hadn&rsquo;t blocked access</p>
<p>to all of this, because there&rsquo;s blood bank information,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of information,</p>
<p>and based on a full and complete understanding,</p>
<p>we came to believe that all of the early cases</p>
<p>were at this market.</p>
<p>I think that would be a stronger argument</p>
<p>than what this is so far.</p>
<p>But everything leads to the fact that why is it</p>
<p>that the Chinese government,</p>
<p>which was, frankly, after a slow start,</p>
<p>the gold standard of doing viral tracking for SARS 1,</p>
<p>why have they apparently done so little</p>
<p>and shared so little?</p>
<p>I think it asks, it begs a lot of questions.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s then talk about the Chinese government.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several governments, right?</p>
<p>So one is the local government of Wuhan.</p>
<p>And not just the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about government.</p>
<p>No, let&rsquo;s talk about human nature.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just keep zooming out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about planet Earth.</p>
<p>No, so there&rsquo;s the Wuhan local government.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Chinese government led by Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s governments in general.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to empathize.</p>
<p>So my father was involved with Chernobyl.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to put myself into the mind of local officials,</p>
<p>of people who are like,</p>
<p>oh shit, there&rsquo;s a potential catastrophic event</p>
<p>happening here and it&rsquo;s my ass</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s incompetence all over the place.</p>
<p>Yeah, human nature is such that there&rsquo;s incompetence</p>
<p>all over the place and you&rsquo;re always trying to cover it up.</p>
<p>And so given that context,</p>
<p>I want to lay out all the possible incompetence,</p>
<p>all the possible malevolence,</p>
<p>all the possible geopolitical tensions here.</p>
<p>All right, where in your sense did the coverup start?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this suspicious fact,</p>
<p>it seems like that the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>had a public database of thousands</p>
<p>of sampled bad coronavirus sequences</p>
<p>and that went offline in September of 2019.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>So let me talk about that specific</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll also follow your path of zooming out</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a really important.</p>
<p>Is that a good starting point?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great starting point, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So but there&rsquo;s a bigger story</p>
<p>but let me talk about that.</p>
<p>So the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>and we can go into the whole history</p>
<p>of the Wuhan Institute of Virology either now or later</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s very relevant to the story</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s focus for now on this database.</p>
<p>They had a database of 22,000 viral samples</p>
<p>and sequence information about viruses</p>
<p>that they had collected.</p>
<p>Some of which, the collection of some of which</p>
<p>was supported through funding from the NIH,</p>
<p>not a huge NIH through the EcoHealth Alliance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a relatively small amount, $600,000 but not nothing.</p>
<p>The goal of this database</p>
<p>was so that we could understand viral evolution</p>
<p>so that exactly for this kind of moment</p>
<p>where we had an unknown virus,</p>
<p>we could say, well, is this like anything</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve seen before?</p>
<p>And that would help us both understand what we&rsquo;re facing</p>
<p>and be better able to respond.</p>
<p>So this was a password protected public access database.</p>
<p>In 2019, in September 2019,</p>
<p>it became inaccessible and then the whole,</p>
<p>a few months later, the entire database disappeared.</p>
<p>What the Chinese have said is that because there were</p>
<p>all kinds of computer attacks on this database</p>
<p>but why would that happen in September 2019</p>
<p>before the pandemic, at least as far as we know.</p>
<p>So just to clarify.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It went down to September 2019</p>
<p>just so we get the year straight.</p>
<p>January 2020 is when the virus</p>
<p>really started getting the press.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about December 2019,</p>
<p>a lot of early infections happened.</p>
<p>September 2019 is when this database goes down.</p>
<p>Just to clarify because you said it quickly,</p>
<p>the Chinese government said</p>
<p>that their database was getting hacked.</p>
<p>Therefore, Xu Zhengli, the director of this part</p>
<p>of the Wuhan Institute of Virology said that.</p>
<p>Oh really, she was the one that said it?</p>
<p>She was the one who said it.</p>
<p>Oh boy, I did not even know that part.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, she&rsquo;s an interesting character.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about her.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the excuse is that it&rsquo;s getting cyber attacked a lot</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re gonna take it down without any further explanation</p>
<p>which seems very suspicious.</p>
<p>And then this virus starts to emerge</p>
<p>in October, November, December.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of argument about that, but after.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt, but some people are saying</p>
<p>that the first outbreak could have happened</p>
<p>as early as September.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more likely it&rsquo;s October, November,</p>
<p>but for the people who are saying that the first outbreak,</p>
<p>the first incident of a known outbreak,</p>
<p>at least to somebody, happened in September,</p>
<p>they make the argument, well, what if that also happened</p>
<p>in mid September of 2019?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not prepared to go there,</p>
<p>but there are some people who make that argument.</p>
<p>But I think, again, if I were to put myself</p>
<p>in the mind of officials,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s officials within the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>or Wuhan local officials,</p>
<p>I think if I notice some major problem,</p>
<p>like somebody got sick,</p>
<p>some sign of, oh shit, we screwed up,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you kind of do the slow,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a Homer Simpson meme</p>
<p>where you slowly start backing out,</p>
<p>and I would probably start hiding stuff.</p>
<p>CYA, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then coming up with really shady excuses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re in a relationship</p>
<p>and your girlfriend wants to see your phone,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting attacked by the Russians now.</p>
<p>The cyber security issue, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wish I could.</p>
<p>I wish I could, it&rsquo;s just unsafe right now.</p>
<p>So would it be okay if I give you my kind of macro view</p>
<p>of the whole information space</p>
<p>and why I believe this has been so contentious?</p>
<p>If I had to give my best guess,</p>
<p>and I underline the word guess of what happened,</p>
<p>and your background, your family background with Chernobyl</p>
<p>I think is highly relevant here.</p>
<p>So after the first SARS, there was a recognition</p>
<p>that we needed to distribute knowledge about virology</p>
<p>and epidemiology around the world,</p>
<p>that people in China and Africa and Southeast Asia,</p>
<p>they were the frontline workers,</p>
<p>and they needed to be doing a lot of the viral monitoring</p>
<p>and assessment so that we could have an early alarm system.</p>
<p>And that was why there was a lot of investment</p>
<p>in all of those places in building capacity</p>
<p>and training people</p>
<p>and helping to build institutional capacity.</p>
<p>And the Chinese government,</p>
<p>they recognized that they needed to ramp things up.</p>
<p>And then the World Health Organization</p>
<p>and the World Health Assembly,</p>
<p>they had their international health regulations</p>
<p>that were designed to create a stronger infrastructure.</p>
<p>So that was the goal.</p>
<p>There were a lot of investments,</p>
<p>and I know we&rsquo;ll talk later</p>
<p>about the Wuhan Institute of Virology,</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t go into that right now.</p>
<p>So there was all of this distributed capacity.</p>
<p>And so in the early days, there&rsquo;s a breakout in Wuhan.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, is it September, October, November?</p>
<p>Maybe December is when the local authorities</p>
<p>start to recognize that something&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>But at some point in late 2019,</p>
<p>local officials in Wuhan understand that something is up.</p>
<p>And exactly like in Chernobyl,</p>
<p>these guys exist within a hierarchical system,</p>
<p>and they are going to be rewarded if good things happen,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to be in big trouble</p>
<p>if bad things happen under their watch.</p>
<p>So their initial instinct is to squash it.</p>
<p>And my guess is they think,</p>
<p>well, if we squash this information,</p>
<p>we can most likely beat back this outbreak,</p>
<p>because lots of outbreaks happen all the time,</p>
<p>including of SARS 1,</p>
<p>where there was multiple lab incidents</p>
<p>out of a lab in Beijing.</p>
<p>And so they start their coverup on day one.</p>
<p>They start screening social media.</p>
<p>They send nasty letters to different doctors</p>
<p>and others who are starting to speak up.</p>
<p>But then it becomes clear that there&rsquo;s a bigger issue.</p>
<p>And then the national government of China,</p>
<p>again, this is just a hypothesis,</p>
<p>the national government gets involved.</p>
<p>They say, all right, this is getting much bigger.</p>
<p>They go in and they realize</p>
<p>that we have a big problem on our hands.</p>
<p>They relatively quickly know</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s spreading human to human.</p>
<p>And so the right thing for them to do then</p>
<p>is what the South African government is doing now</p>
<p>is to say, we have this outbreak.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know everything, but we know it&rsquo;s serious.</p>
<p>We need help.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the instinct of people in most governments</p>
<p>and certainly not in authoritarian governments like China.</p>
<p>And so the national government,</p>
<p>they have a choice at that point.</p>
<p>They can do option one,</p>
<p>which is what we would hear called the right thing,</p>
<p>which is total transparency.</p>
<p>They criticize the local officials for having this coverup.</p>
<p>And they say, now we&rsquo;re going to be totally transparent.</p>
<p>But what does that do in a system</p>
<p>like the former Soviet Union, like China now?</p>
<p>If local officials say, wait a second,</p>
<p>I thought my job was to cover everything up,</p>
<p>to support this alternative reality</p>
<p>that authoritarian systems need in order to survive.</p>
<p>Well, now I&rsquo;m gonna be held accountable</p>
<p>for if I&rsquo;m not totally transparent,</p>
<p>like your whole system would collapse.</p>
<p>So the national government, they have that choice</p>
<p>and their only choice according to the logic of their system</p>
<p>is to be all in on a coverup.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they block the World Health Organization</p>
<p>from sending its team to Wuhan for over three weeks.</p>
<p>They overtly lie to the World Health Organization</p>
<p>about human to human transmission.</p>
<p>And then they begin their coverups.</p>
<p>So they begin very, very quickly destroying samples,</p>
<p>hiding records, they start imprisoning people</p>
<p>for asking basic questions.</p>
<p>Soon after they establish a gag order,</p>
<p>preventing Chinese scientists from writing</p>
<p>or saying anything about pandemic origins</p>
<p>without prior government approval.</p>
<p>And what that does means that there isn&rsquo;t a lot of data,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not nearly enough data coming out of China.</p>
<p>And so lots of responsible scientists outside of China</p>
<p>who are data driven say, well,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough information to draw conclusions.</p>
<p>And then into that vacuum step a relatively small number</p>
<p>of largely virologists, but also others,</p>
<p>respected scientists.</p>
<p>And I know we&rsquo;ll talk about the, I think,</p>
<p>infamous Peter Daszak who say,</p>
<p>well, without any real foundation in the evidence,</p>
<p>they say, we know pretty much this comes from nature</p>
<p>and anyone who&rsquo;s raising the possibility</p>
<p>of a lab incident origin is a conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>So that message starts to percolate.</p>
<p>And then in the United States, we have Donald Trump</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s starting to get criticized for America&rsquo;s failure</p>
<p>to respond, prepare for and respond adequately</p>
<p>to the outbreak.</p>
<p>And so he starts saying, well, I know first</p>
<p>after praising Xi Jinping, he starts saying,</p>
<p>well, I know that China did it and the WHO did it</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s kind of pointing fingers at everybody but himself.</p>
<p>And then we have a media here that had shifted</p>
<p>from the traditional model of he said, she said journalism,</p>
<p>so and so said X and so and so said Y</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll present both of those views.</p>
<p>With Donald Trump,</p>
<p>he would make outlandish starting positions.</p>
<p>So he would say, Lex is an ax murderer.</p>
<p>And then in the early days, they would say,</p>
<p>Lex is an ax murderer, Lex&rsquo;s friend says</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not an ax murderer and we have a four day debate,</p>
<p>is he or isn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>And then at day four, someone would say,</p>
<p>why are we having this debate at all?</p>
<p>Because the original point is just is baseless.</p>
<p>And so the media just got in the habit,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what Trump said and here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very complicated to figure out</p>
<p>what is the role of a politician?</p>
<p>What is the role of a leader in this kind of game</p>
<p>of politics?</p>
<p>But certainly in when there&rsquo;s a tragedy,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a catastrophic event,</p>
<p>what it takes to be a leader is to see clearly</p>
<p>through the fog and to make big bold decisions</p>
<p>that does speak to the truth of things.</p>
<p>And even if it&rsquo;s unpopular truth,</p>
<p>to listen to the people, to listen to all sides,</p>
<p>to the opinions, to the controversial ideas</p>
<p>and to see past all the bullshit,</p>
<p>all the political bullshit and just speak to the people,</p>
<p>speak to the world and make bold, big decisions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably what was needed in terms of leadership.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not so willing to criticize whether it&rsquo;s Joe Biden</p>
<p>or Donald Trump on this.</p>
<p>I think most people cannot be great leaders,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why when great leaders step up,</p>
<p>we write books about them.</p>
<p>And I agree.</p>
<p>And even though, I mean, I think of myself</p>
<p>as a progressive person, I certainly was a critic</p>
<p>of a lot of what President Trump did.</p>
<p>But on this particular case,</p>
<p>even though he may have said it in an uncouth way,</p>
<p>Donald Trump was actually, in my view, right.</p>
<p>I mean, when he said, hey, let&rsquo;s look at this lab.</p>
<p>I mean, he said, I have evidence, I can&rsquo;t tell you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he even had the evidence.</p>
<p>But his intuition that this probably comes from a lab,</p>
<p>in my view was a correct intuition.</p>
<p>And certainly I started speaking up</p>
<p>about pandemic origins early in 2019.</p>
<p>And my friends, my democratic friends were brutal with me</p>
<p>saying, what are you doing?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supporting Trump in an election year.</p>
<p>And I said, just because Donald Trump is saying something</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that I need to oppose it.</p>
<p>If Donald Trump says something that I think is correct,</p>
<p>well, I wanna say it&rsquo;s correct,</p>
<p>just as if he says something that I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna speak up about that.</p>
<p>Good, you walked through the fire.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you laid out the story here.</p>
<p>And I think in many ways it&rsquo;s a human story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a story of politics, it&rsquo;s a story of human nature.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about the story of the virus.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s talk about the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>So maybe this is a good time to try to talk about</p>
<p>its history, about its origins,</p>
<p>about what kind of stuff it works on,</p>
<p>about biosafety levels, and about Batwoman.</p>
<p>Yeah, Xu Zhengli, yes.</p>
<p>Xu Zhengli.</p>
<p>So what is the Wuhan Institute of Virology,</p>
<p>when did it start?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So after SARS 1, which was in the early 2000, 2003, 2004,</p>
<p>there was this effort to enhance,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before, global capacity, including in China.</p>
<p>So the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>had been around for decades before then.</p>
<p>But there was an agreement between the French</p>
<p>and the Chinese governments to build the largest BSL4 lab,</p>
<p>BSL4 lab, so biosafety level four.</p>
<p>So in these what are called high containment labs,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s level four, which is the highest level.</p>
<p>And people have seen that on TV and elsewhere,</p>
<p>where you have the people in the different suits</p>
<p>and all of these protections.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s level three, which is still very serious,</p>
<p>but not as much as level four.</p>
<p>And then level two is just kind of goggles and some gloves</p>
<p>and maybe a face mask, much less.</p>
<p>So the French and the Chinese governments agreed</p>
<p>that France would help build the first</p>
<p>and still the largest BSL4 plus some mobile BSL3 labs.</p>
<p>And they were going to do it in Wuhan.</p>
<p>And Wuhan is kind of like China&rsquo;s Chicago.</p>
<p>And I had actually been, it&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been in Wuhan relatively not that long</p>
<p>before the pandemic broke out.</p>
<p>And that was why I knew that Wuhan,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not some backwater where there are a bunch of yokels</p>
<p>eating bats for dinner every night.</p>
<p>This is a really sophisticated, wealthy, highly educated</p>
<p>and cultured city.</p>
<p>And so I knew that it wasn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>that even the one on seafood market</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t like some of these seafood markets</p>
<p>that they have in Southern China or in Cambodia,</p>
<p>where I lived for two years.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a totally different thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to talk to you about some of the,</p>
<p>including the Wuhan market,</p>
<p>just some of the wild food going on here.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve traveled that part of the world.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s not get there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get distracted.</p>
<p>Good, as I was telling you, Lex, before,</p>
<p>and this is maybe an advertisement,</p>
<p>is having now listened to a number of your podcasts</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m doing long ultra training runs</p>
<p>or driving in the mountains.</p>
<p>Like the really, because in the beginning,</p>
<p>we have to talk about whatever it is is the topic.</p>
<p>But the really good stuff happens later.</p>
<p>So stay tuned. So friends,</p>
<p>you should listen to the end.</p>
<p>I have to say, as I was telling you before,</p>
<p>like when I heard your long podcast with J√©r√¥me Lanier</p>
<p>and he talked about his mother at the very end,</p>
<p>I mean, just beautiful stuff.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know whether I can match beautiful stuff,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna do my best.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to find out.</p>
<p>Exactly, stay tuned.</p>
<p>So France had this agreement</p>
<p>that they were going to help design and help build</p>
<p>this BSL4 lab in Wuhan.</p>
<p>And it was going to be with French standards,</p>
<p>and there were going to be 50 French experts</p>
<p>who were going to work there</p>
<p>and supervise the work that happened</p>
<p>even after the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>in the new location started operating.</p>
<p>But then when they started building it,</p>
<p>the French contractors, the French overseers</p>
<p>were increasingly appalled</p>
<p>that they had less and less control,</p>
<p>that the Chinese contractors were swapping out new things,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t built up to French standards,</p>
<p>so much that at the end, when it was finally built,</p>
<p>the person who was the vice chairman of the project</p>
<p>and a leading French industrialist named Marieau</p>
<p>refused to sign off.</p>
<p>And he said, we can&rsquo;t support,</p>
<p>we have no idea what this is,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s safe or not.</p>
<p>And when this lab opened,</p>
<p>remember it was supposed to have 50 French experts,</p>
<p>it had one French expert.</p>
<p>And so the French were really disgusted.</p>
<p>And actually when the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>and its new location opened in 2018, two things happened.</p>
<p>One, French intelligence privately approached</p>
<p>US intelligence saying, we have a lot of concerns</p>
<p>about the Wuhan Institute of Virology,</p>
<p>about its safety, and we don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s operating there,</p>
<p>is it being used as a dual use facility?</p>
<p>And also in 2018, the US embassy in Beijing</p>
<p>sent some people down to Wuhan to go and look at,</p>
<p>well, at this laboratory.</p>
<p>And they wrote a scathing cable that Josh Rogin</p>
<p>from the Washington Post later got his hands on saying,</p>
<p>this is really unsafe,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing work on dangerous bat coronaviruses</p>
<p>in conditions where a leak is possible.</p>
<p>And so then you mentioned Shujing Li,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll connect that to these virologists</p>
<p>who I was talking about.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a very credible thesis</p>
<p>that because these pathogenic outbreaks happen</p>
<p>in other parts of the world,</p>
<p>having partnerships with experts in those parts of the world</p>
<p>must be a foundation of our efforts.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just bring everything home</p>
<p>because we know that viruses don&rsquo;t care about borders</p>
<p>and boundaries, and so if something happens there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to come here.</p>
<p>So very correctly, we have all kinds of partnerships</p>
<p>with experts in these labs,</p>
<p>and Shujing Li was one of those partners.</p>
<p>And her closest relationship was with Peter Daszak,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a British, I think now American,</p>
<p>but the president of a thing called EcoHealth Alliance,</p>
<p>which was getting money from NIH.</p>
<p>And basically, EcoHealth Alliance</p>
<p>was a pass through organization.</p>
<p>And over the years, it was only about $600,000.</p>
<p>So almost all of her funding</p>
<p>came from the Chinese government,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a little bit that came from the United States.</p>
<p>And so she became their kind of leading expert</p>
<p>and the point of contact</p>
<p>between the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>and certainly Peter Daszak, but also with others.</p>
<p>And that was why in the earliest days of the outbreak,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mention that,</p>
<p>I did mention that there were these virologists</p>
<p>who had this fake certainty</p>
<p>that they knew it came from nature</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t come from a lab</p>
<p>and they called people like me conspiracy theorists</p>
<p>just for raising that possibility.</p>
<p>But when Peter Daszak was organizing that effort</p>
<p>in February of 2020,</p>
<p>what he said is we need to rally</p>
<p>behind our Chinese colleagues.</p>
<p>And the basic idea was</p>
<p>these international collaborations are under threat.</p>
<p>And I think it was because of that,</p>
<p>because Peter Daszak&rsquo;s basically his major contribution</p>
<p>as a scientist was just tacking his name</p>
<p>on work that Shujang Li had largely done.</p>
<p>He was defending a lot,</p>
<p>certainly for himself and his organization.</p>
<p>So you think EcoHealth Alliance and Peter</p>
<p>is less about money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more about kind of almost like legacy</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re so attached to this work?</p>
<p>Is it just on a human level?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been criticized for being actually,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly a big critic of Peter Daszak,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been criticized by some for being too lenient.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so easy to say,</p>
<p>oh, somebody they&rsquo;re like an evil ogre</p>
<p>and just trying to do evil</p>
<p>and cackling in their closet or whatever.</p>
<p>But I think for most of us,</p>
<p>even those of us who do terrible, horrible things,</p>
<p>the story that we tell ourselves</p>
<p>and we really believe is that we&rsquo;re doing the thing</p>
<p>that we most believe in.</p>
<p>I mean, I did my PhD dissertation</p>
<p>on the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.</p>
<p>They genuinely saw themselves as idealists.</p>
<p>They thought, well, we need to make radical change</p>
<p>to build a better future.</p>
<p>And what they described as,</p>
<p>that they felt was radical change</p>
<p>was a monstrous atrocities by us.</p>
<p>So the criticism here of Peter</p>
<p>is that he was a part of an organization</p>
<p>that was kind of, well, funding an effort</p>
<p>that was an unsafe implementation</p>
<p>of a biosafety level four laboratory.</p>
<p>Well, a few things.</p>
<p>So what he thought he was doing was,</p>
<p>and then what he thought he was doing</p>
<p>is itself highly controversial</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s one there that in 2011,</p>
<p>there were, I know you&rsquo;ve talked about this</p>
<p>with other guests, but in 2011,</p>
<p>there were the first published papers</p>
<p>on this now infamous gain of function research.</p>
<p>And basically what they did,</p>
<p>both in different labs and certainly in the United States,</p>
<p>in Wisconsin and in the Netherlands,</p>
<p>was they had a bird flu virus</p>
<p>that was very dangerous, but not massively transmissive.</p>
<p>And they had a gain of function process</p>
<p>through what&rsquo;s called serial passage,</p>
<p>which means basically passing advice,</p>
<p>like natural selection, but forcing natural selection</p>
<p>by just passing a virus through different cell cultures</p>
<p>and then selecting for what it is that you want.</p>
<p>So relatively easily, they took this deadly,</p>
<p>but not massively transmissive virus</p>
<p>and turned it into, in a lab,</p>
<p>a deadly and transmissive virus.</p>
<p>And that showed that this is really dangerous.</p>
<p>And so there were, at that point,</p>
<p>there was a huge controversy.</p>
<p>There were some people, like Richard Ebright</p>
<p>and Mark Lipsitch at Harvard,</p>
<p>who were saying that this is really dangerous.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the idea that we need to create monsters</p>
<p>to study monsters.</p>
<p>I think maybe even you have said that in the past.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an unlimited number of monsters.</p>
<p>And so what are we gonna do?</p>
<p>Create an unlimited number of monsters.</p>
<p>And if we do that,</p>
<p>eventually the monsters are going to get out.</p>
<p>Then there was the Peter Daszak camp,</p>
<p>and he got a lot of funding,</p>
<p>particularly from the United States,</p>
<p>who said, well, and certainly Collins and Fauci</p>
<p>were supportive of this.</p>
<p>And they thought, well, there&rsquo;s a safe way</p>
<p>to go out into the world</p>
<p>to collect the world&rsquo;s most dangerous viruses</p>
<p>and to poke and prod them</p>
<p>to figure out how they might mutate,</p>
<p>how they might become more dangerous</p>
<p>with the goal of predicting future pandemics.</p>
<p>And that certainly never happened</p>
<p>with the goal of creating vaccines and treatments.</p>
<p>And that largely never happened,</p>
<p>but that was, so Peter Daszak kind of epitomized</p>
<p>that second approach.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ve talked about in the past,</p>
<p>in 2014, there was a funding moratorium</p>
<p>in the United States, and then in 2017, that was lifted.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t affect the funding</p>
<p>that went to the EcoHealth Alliance.</p>
<p>So when this happened in the beginning,</p>
<p>and again, coming back to Peter&rsquo;s motivations,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, here&rsquo;s the best case scenario for Peter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you what I imagine he was thinking,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll tell you what I actually think.</p>
<p>So I think here&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s thinking.</p>
<p>This is most likely a natural origin outbreak.</p>
<p>Just like SARS one, again, in Peter&rsquo;s hypothetical mind,</p>
<p>just like SARS one, this is most likely a natural outbreak.</p>
<p>We need to have an international coalition</p>
<p>in order to fight it.</p>
<p>If we allow these political attacks</p>
<p>to undermine our Chinese counterparts</p>
<p>and the trust in these relationships</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve built over many years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really screwed because they have</p>
<p>the most local knowledge of these outbreaks.</p>
<p>And even though, and this guy gets a lot more complicated,</p>
<p>even though there are basic questions</p>
<p>that anybody would ask and that Shujing Li herself did ask</p>
<p>about the origins of this pandemic,</p>
<p>even though Peter Daszak, and I&rsquo;ll describe this</p>
<p>in a moment, had secret information that we didn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>that in my mind massively increases the possibility</p>
<p>of a lab incident origin, I, Peter Daszak,</p>
<p>would like to guide the public conversation</p>
<p>in the direction where I think it should go</p>
<p>and in support of the kind of international collaboration</p>
<p>that I think is necessary.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a strong, positive discussion</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s true that there&rsquo;s a lot of political BS</p>
<p>and a lot of kind of just bickering and lies</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very convenient to say, you know what?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just ignore all of these quote unquote lies</p>
<p>and my favorite word, misinformation.</p>
<p>And then because the way out from this serious pandemic</p>
<p>is for us to work together.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s strengthen our partnerships</p>
<p>and everything else is just like noise.</p>
<p>Yeah, so let&rsquo;s, and so then now I wanna do</p>
<p>my personal indictment of Peter Daszak</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s my view, but I wanted to fairly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Because I think that we all tell ourselves stories</p>
<p>and also when you&rsquo;re a science communicator,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t in your public communications</p>
<p>give every doubt that you have or every nuance,</p>
<p>you kind of have to summarize things.</p>
<p>And so I think that he was, again,</p>
<p>in this benign interpretation trying to summarize</p>
<p>in the way that he thought the conversations should go.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my indictment of Peter Daszak.</p>
<p>And I feel like a Brutus here,</p>
<p>but I have not come here to praise Peter Daszak</p>
<p>because while Peter Daszak was doing all of this</p>
<p>and making all of these statements about,</p>
<p>well, we pretty much know it&rsquo;s a natural origin.</p>
<p>Then there was this February, 2020 Lancet letter</p>
<p>where it turns out, and we only knew this later</p>
<p>that he was highly manipulative.</p>
<p>So he was recruiting all of these people.</p>
<p>He drafted the infamous letter calling people like me,</p>
<p>conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>He then wrote to people like Ralph Barak and Linfa Wang,</p>
<p>who are also very high profile virologists saying,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s not put our names on it.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t look like we&rsquo;re doing it,</p>
<p>even though they were doing it.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t disclose a lot of information that they had.</p>
<p>It was a strategic move.</p>
<p>So just in case people are not familiar,</p>
<p>February, 2020, Lancet letter was TLDR,</p>
<p>is a lab leak hypothesis, is a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Essentially, yes.</p>
<p>So like with the authority of science,</p>
<p>not saying like it&rsquo;s highly likely,</p>
<p>saying it&rsquo;s obvious, duh, it&rsquo;s natural origin.</p>
<p>Everybody else is just,</p>
<p>everything else is just misinformation.</p>
<p>And look, there&rsquo;s a bunch of really smart people</p>
<p>that signed this, therefore it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah, not only that, so there were the people</p>
<p>who, 27 people signed that letter.</p>
<p>And then after President Trump cut funding</p>
<p>to EcoHealth Alliance, then he organized 77 Nobel laureates</p>
<p>to have a public letter criticizing that.</p>
<p>But what Peter knew then that we didn&rsquo;t fully know</p>
<p>is that in March of 2018, EcoHealth Alliance,</p>
<p>in partnership with the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>and others, had applied for a $14 million grant to DARPA,</p>
<p>which is kind of like the VC side of the venture capital</p>
<p>side of the Defense Department.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of, where they do kind of big ideas.</p>
<p>By the way, as a tiny tangent,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of funding from DARPA.</p>
<p>They fund a lot of excellent robotics research.</p>
<p>And DARPA is incredible.</p>
<p>And among the things that they applied for</p>
<p>is that we, meaning Wuhan Institute of Virology,</p>
<p>is gonna go and it&rsquo;s gonna collect</p>
<p>the most dangerous bat coronaviruses in Southern China.</p>
<p>And then we, as this group,</p>
<p>are going to genetically engineer these viruses</p>
<p>to insert a furin cleavage site.</p>
<p>So I think when everyone&rsquo;s now seen the image</p>
<p>of the SARS CoV2 virus, it has these little spike proteins,</p>
<p>these little things that stick out,</p>
<p>which is why they call it a coronavirus.</p>
<p>Within that spike protein are these furin cleavage sites,</p>
<p>which basically help with the virus</p>
<p>getting access into our cells.</p>
<p>And they were going to genetically engineer</p>
<p>these furin cleavage sites into these bat coronaviruses,</p>
<p>the serbicoviruses.</p>
<p>And then, and so then a year and a half later,</p>
<p>what do we see?</p>
<p>We see a bat coronavirus with a furin cleavage site</p>
<p>unlike anything that we&rsquo;ve ever seen before</p>
<p>in that category of SARS like coronaviruses.</p>
<p>That, well, yes, I mean, the DARPA very correctly</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t support that application.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s actually, let&rsquo;s like pause on that.</p>
<p>So for a lot of people, that&rsquo;s like the smoking gun.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about this 2018 proposal to DARPA.</p>
<p>So I guess who&rsquo;s drafted the proposal?</p>
<p>Is it EcoHealth, but the proposal is to do research.</p>
<p>EcoHealth is technically a US funded organization.</p>
<p>Primarily.</p>
<p>And then the idea was to do work</p>
<p>at Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>With, yeah, so it was.</p>
<p>With EcoHealth.</p>
<p>Yes, so EcoHealth, basically the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>was gonna go and they were gonna collect these viruses</p>
<p>and store them at Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re also gonna do the actual task.</p>
<p>According, it&rsquo;s a really important point.</p>
<p>According to their proposal, the actual work</p>
<p>was going to be done at the lab of Ralph Barak</p>
<p>at the University of North Carolina,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s probably the world&rsquo;s leading expert on coronaviruses.</p>
<p>And so we know that DARPA didn&rsquo;t fund that work.</p>
<p>We know, I think quite well that Ralph Barak&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>in part because it was not funded by DARPA,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t do that specific work.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t know is, well, what work was done</p>
<p>at the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>because WIV was part of this proposal.</p>
<p>They had access to all of the plans.</p>
<p>They had done, they had their own capacity</p>
<p>and they had already done a lot of work</p>
<p>in genetically altering this exact category of viruses.</p>
<p>They had created chimeric mixed viruses.</p>
<p>They had mastered pretty much all of the steps</p>
<p>in order to achieve this thing that they applied</p>
<p>for funding with EcoHealth to do.</p>
<p>And so the question is, did the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>go through with that research anyway?</p>
<p>And in my mind, that&rsquo;s a very, very real possibility.</p>
<p>It would certainly explain</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re giving no information.</p>
<p>And as you know, I&rsquo;ve been a member</p>
<p>of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Committee</p>
<p>on Human Genome Editing, which Dr. Tedros created</p>
<p>in the aftermath of the announcement</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s first CRISPR babies.</p>
<p>And it was just basically the first time</p>
<p>and it was just basically the exact same story.</p>
<p>So Ho Chiang Kui, a Chinese scientist,</p>
<p>it was not a first tier scientist,</p>
<p>but a perfectly adequate second tier scientist,</p>
<p>came to the United States, learned all of these capacities,</p>
<p>went back to China and said,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s a much more permissive environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be a world leader.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna establish both myself and China.</p>
<p>So in every scientific field, we&rsquo;re seeing this same thing</p>
<p>where you kind of learn a model and then you do it in China.</p>
<p>So is it possible that the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>with this exact game plan was doing it anyway?</p>
<p>Do we, possible?</p>
<p>We have no clue what work was being done</p>
<p>at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>It seems extremely likely</p>
<p>that at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,</p>
<p>and this is certainly the US government position,</p>
<p>there was the work that was being done in Dr. Hsu&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>but that wasn&rsquo;t the whole WIV.</p>
<p>We know, at least according to the United States government,</p>
<p>that there was the Chinese military,</p>
<p>that PLA was doing work there.</p>
<p>Were they doing this kind of work, not to create a bioweapon,</p>
<p>but in order to understand these viruses,</p>
<p>maybe to develop vaccines and treatments?</p>
<p>It seems like a very, very logical possibility.</p>
<p>And then, so we know that the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>had all of the skills.</p>
<p>We know that they were part of this proposal.</p>
<p>And then you have Peter Daszak, who knows all of this,</p>
<p>that at that time, in February of 2020, we didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But then he comes swinging out of the gate,</p>
<p>saying anybody who&rsquo;s raising this possibility</p>
<p>of a lab incident origin is a conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>I mean, it really makes him look, in my mind,</p>
<p>very, very bad.</p>
<p>And yet, not to at least be somewhat open minded on this,</p>
<p>because he knows all the details.</p>
<p>He knows that it&rsquo;s not 0%.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no way in his mind could you even argue that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s potential because of the bias,</p>
<p>because of your focus.</p>
<p>I mean, it could be the Anthony Fauci masks thing,</p>
<p>whereas he knows there&rsquo;s some significant probability</p>
<p>that this is happening.</p>
<p>But in order to preserve good relations</p>
<p>with our Chinese colleagues,</p>
<p>we want to make sure we tell a certain kind of narrative.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not really lying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing the best possible action at this time</p>
<p>to help the world.</p>
<p>Not that this already happened.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how like&hellip;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s quite likely that that was the story</p>
<p>that he was telling himself.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s that lack of transparency, in my mind,</p>
<p>is fraudulent, that we were struggling</p>
<p>to understand something that we didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And that I just think that people who possess</p>
<p>that kind of information, especially when the existence,</p>
<p>like the entire career of Peter Daszak</p>
<p>is based on US taxpayers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a debt that comes with that.</p>
<p>And that debt is honesty and transparency.</p>
<p>And for all of us, and you talked about</p>
<p>your girlfriend checking your phone.</p>
<p>For all of us, being honest and transparent</p>
<p>in the most difficult times is really difficult.</p>
<p>If it were easy, everybody would do it.</p>
<p>And I just feel that Peter was the opposite of transparent</p>
<p>and then went on the offensive.</p>
<p>And then had the gall of joining,</p>
<p>I know we can talk about this,</p>
<p>this highly compromised joint study process</p>
<p>with the international experts</p>
<p>and their Chinese government counterparts.</p>
<p>And used that as a way of furthering</p>
<p>this, in my mind, fraudulent narrative</p>
<p>that it almost certainly came from natural origins</p>
<p>and a lab origin was extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>Just to stick briefly on the proposal to wrap that up,</p>
<p>because I do think, in a kind of John Stewart way,</p>
<p>if you heard that a bit yet,</p>
<p>sort of kind of like common sense way,</p>
<p>the 2018 proposal to DARPA from EcoHealth Alliance</p>
<p>and Wuhan Institute of Virology,</p>
<p>just seems like a bit of a smoking gun to me, like that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this excellent book that people should read</p>
<p>called Viral, The Search for the Origin of COVID 19.</p>
<p>Matt Ridley and Alena Chan, I think Alena is in MIT.</p>
<p>Probably. At the Broad, yeah.</p>
<p>At Broad Institute, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So she, I heard her in an interview</p>
<p>give this analogy of unicorns.</p>
<p>And where basically somebody writes a proposal</p>
<p>to add horns to horses, the proposal is rejected.</p>
<p>And then a couple of years later or a year later,</p>
<p>a unicorn shows up.</p>
<p>In the place where they&rsquo;re proposing to do it.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s so, I had.</p>
<p>And then everyone&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s natural origin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s possible it&rsquo;s natural origin.</p>
<p>Like we haven&rsquo;t detected a unicorn yet.</p>
<p>And this is the first time we&rsquo;ve detected a unicorn.</p>
<p>Or it could be this massive organization</p>
<p>that was planning, is fully equipped,</p>
<p>has like a history of being able to do this stuff,</p>
<p>has the world experts to do it, has the funding,</p>
<p>has the motivation to add horns to horses.</p>
<p>And now a unicorn shows up and they&rsquo;re saying, nope.</p>
<p>Definitely natural.</p>
<p>That connects to your first question</p>
<p>of how do I get to my 85%?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a summary of that answer.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s what I said in my 60 Minutes interview</p>
<p>a long time ago, of all the gin joints</p>
<p>and all the towns and all the world,</p>
<p>the quote from Casablanca.</p>
<p>And so of all the places in the world</p>
<p>where we have an outbreak of a SARS like bat coronavirus,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not in the area of the natural habitat</p>
<p>of the horseshoe bats.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one city in China</p>
<p>with the first and largest level four virology lab,</p>
<p>which actually wasn&rsquo;t even using it.</p>
<p>They were doing level three and level two for this work,</p>
<p>where they had the world&rsquo;s largest collection</p>
<p>of bat coronaviruses,</p>
<p>where they were doing aggressive experiments</p>
<p>designed to make these scary viruses scarier,</p>
<p>where they had been part of an application</p>
<p>to insert a furin cleavage site,</p>
<p>able to infect human cells.</p>
<p>And when the outbreak happened,</p>
<p>we had a virus that was ready for action to infect humans.</p>
<p>And to this day, better able to infect humans</p>
<p>than any other species, including bats.</p>
<p>And then from day one, there&rsquo;s this massive coverup.</p>
<p>And then on top of that,</p>
<p>in spite of lots of efforts by lots of people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s basically no evidence</p>
<p>for the natural origin hypothesis.</p>
<p>Everything that I&rsquo;ve described just now is circumstantial,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a certain point</p>
<p>where you add up the circumstances</p>
<p>and you see this seems pretty, pretty likely.</p>
<p>I mean, if we&rsquo;re getting to 100%,</p>
<p>we are not at 100% by any means.</p>
<p>There still is a possibility of a natural origin.</p>
<p>And if we find that, great.</p>
<p>But from everything that I know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how I get to my 85.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about why this matters</p>
<p>in the political sense, in the human sense,</p>
<p>in the science, in the realm of science,</p>
<p>all of those factors.</p>
<p>But first, as Nietzsche said, let us look into the abyss</p>
<p>and the games we&rsquo;ll play with monsters.</p>
<p>That is colloquially called gain of function research.</p>
<p>Let me ask the kind of political sounding question,</p>
<p>which is how people usually phrase it.</p>
<p>Did Anthony Fauci fund gain of function research</p>
<p>at the Wuhan Institute of Virology?</p>
<p>So it depends.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve obviously been very closely monitoring this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken a lot about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about it.</p>
<p>And it depends on, I mean, not to quote Bill Clinton,</p>
<p>but to quote Bill Clinton, it depends on what</p>
<p>the definition of is is.</p>
<p>And so if you use a common sense definition of gain of function,</p>
<p>and by gain of function, there are lots of things</p>
<p>like gene therapies that are gain of function.</p>
<p>But here, what we mean is gain of function</p>
<p>for pathogens potentially able to create human pandemics.</p>
<p>But if you use the kind of common sense language,</p>
<p>well, then he probably did.</p>
<p>If you use the technical language from a 2017 NIH</p>
<p>document, and you read that language very narrowly,</p>
<p>I think you can make a credible argument that he did not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a question, though, and Francis Collins</p>
<p>talked about that in his interview with you.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s a question that we know from now</p>
<p>that we have the information of the reports submitted</p>
<p>by EcoHealth Alliance to the NIH, and some of which</p>
<p>were late or not even delivered, that some of this research</p>
<p>was done on MERS, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus.</p>
<p>And if that was the case, there is, I think,</p>
<p>a colorable argument that that would be considered</p>
<p>gain of function research even by the narrow language</p>
<p>of that 2017 document.</p>
<p>But I definitely think, and I&rsquo;ve said this repeatedly,</p>
<p>that Rand Paul can be right, and Tony Fauci can be right.</p>
<p>And the question is, how are we defining gain of function?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve always said the question in my mind</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t, was it or wasn&rsquo;t it gain of function,</p>
<p>as if that&rsquo;s like a binary thing, if not, grade,</p>
<p>and if yes, guilty.</p>
<p>The question is just, what work was being done at the Wuhan</p>
<p>Institute of Virology?</p>
<p>What role, if any, did US government funding</p>
<p>play in supporting that work?</p>
<p>And what rights do we all have as human beings</p>
<p>and as American citizens and taxpayers</p>
<p>to get all of the relevant information about that?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try to kind of dissect this.</p>
<p>So who frustrates you more, Rand Paul or Anthony</p>
<p>Fauci in his discussion or the discussion itself?</p>
<p>So for example, gain of function is</p>
<p>a term that&rsquo;s kind of more used just</p>
<p>to mean playing with viruses in the lab</p>
<p>to try to develop more dangerous viruses.</p>
<p>Is this kind of research a good idea?</p>
<p>Is it also a good idea for us to talk about it in public,</p>
<p>in the political way that it&rsquo;s been talked about?</p>
<p>Is it OK that US may have funded gain of function research</p>
<p>elsewhere?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of assumed, just like with Bill Clinton,</p>
<p>there was very little discussion of, I think,</p>
<p>correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>OK for a president, male or female,</p>
<p>to have extramarital sex or is it</p>
<p>OK for a president to have extramarital sex</p>
<p>with people on his staff or her staff?</p>
<p>It was more the discussion of lying, I think.</p>
<p>It was, did you lie about having sex or not?</p>
<p>And in this gain of function discussion,</p>
<p>what frustrates me personally is there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a deep philosophical discussion about whether we</p>
<p>should be doing this kind of research</p>
<p>and what are the ethical lines, research on animals at all.</p>
<p>Those are fascinating questions.</p>
<p>Instead, it&rsquo;s a gotcha thing.</p>
<p>Did you or did you not fund research on gain of function?</p>
<p>And did you fund, it&rsquo;s almost like a bioweapon.</p>
<p>Did you give money to China to develop this bioweapon that</p>
<p>now attacked the rest of the world?</p>
<p>So I mean, all those things are pretty frustrating,</p>
<p>but is there, I think, the thing you</p>
<p>can untangle about Anthony Fauci and gain of function</p>
<p>research in the United States and the EcoHealth Alliance</p>
<p>and Wuhan Institute of Virology that&rsquo;s clarifying.</p>
<p>What were the mistakes made?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So on gain of function, there actually</p>
<p>has been a lot of debate.</p>
<p>I mentioned before in 2011, these first papers,</p>
<p>there was a big debate.</p>
<p>Mark Lipsitch, who&rsquo;s formerly at Harvard now</p>
<p>with the US government working in the president&rsquo;s office,</p>
<p>he led a thing called the Cambridge Group that</p>
<p>was highly critical of this work,</p>
<p>basically saying we&rsquo;re creating monsters.</p>
<p>They had the funding pause in 2014.</p>
<p>They spent three years putting together a framework,</p>
<p>and then they lifted it in 2017.</p>
<p>So we had a thoughtful conversation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where we are now.</p>
<p>So I absolutely think that there are real issues</p>
<p>with the relationship between the United States government</p>
<p>and EcoHealth Alliance, and through that,</p>
<p>the EcoHealth Alliance with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>And one issue is just essential transparency,</p>
<p>because as I see it, it&rsquo;s most likely the case</p>
<p>that we transferred a lot of our knowledge and plans and things</p>
<p>to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m sure that Xiaojiang Li is not herself</p>
<p>a monster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure of that, even though I&rsquo;ve never met her.</p>
<p>But there are just a different set of pressures</p>
<p>on people working in an authoritarian system</p>
<p>than people who are working in other systems.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s entirely different.</p>
<p>And so I absolutely think that we shouldn&rsquo;t give $1</p>
<p>to an organization, and certainly a virology institute,</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have full access to their records,</p>
<p>to their databases.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what work is happening there.</p>
<p>And I think that we need to have that kind of full examination.</p>
<p>So I understand what Dr. Fauci is doing is saying,</p>
<p>hey, what I hear Dr. Fauci saying,</p>
<p>what I hear from you, Rand Paul, is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re accusing me of starting this pandemic.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re using gain of function as a proxy for that.</p>
<p>And we have, when there are Senate hearings,</p>
<p>every senator gets five minutes.</p>
<p>And the name of the game is to translate your five minutes</p>
<p>into a clip that&rsquo;s going to run on the news.</p>
<p>And so I get that there is that kind of gotcha.</p>
<p>But I also think that Dr. Fauci and the National</p>
<p>Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the NIH</p>
<p>should have been more transparent.</p>
<p>Because I think that in this day and age, where</p>
<p>there are a lot of people poking around</p>
<p>and this whole story of COVID origins,</p>
<p>we would not be where we are if it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t for a relatively small number of people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m part of, there are two, as I know, two groups.</p>
<p>One is these internet sleuths known as Drastic.</p>
<p>And a number of them are part of a group</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m part of called, it&rsquo;s not our official name,</p>
<p>but called the Paris Group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about two dozen experts around the world,</p>
<p>but centered around some very high level French academics.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve all been digging and meeting with each other</p>
<p>regularly since last year.</p>
<p>And our governments across the board, certainly China,</p>
<p>but including the United States, haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been as transparent as they need to be.</p>
<p>So definitely mistakes were made on all sides.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why for me from day one,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been calling for a comprehensive investigation</p>
<p>into this issue that certainly obviously looks at China,</p>
<p>but we have to look at ourselves.</p>
<p>We did not get this right.</p>
<p>So do you, I&rsquo;m just gonna put Rand Paul aside here.</p>
<p>Politician playing political games, it&rsquo;s very frustrating,</p>
<p>but it is what it is on all sides.</p>
<p>Anthony Fauci, you think should have been more transparent</p>
<p>and maybe more eloquent in expressing the complexity</p>
<p>of all of this, the uncertainty in all of this.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I get that it&rsquo;s really hard to do that</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s say you have one, you speak a paragraph</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got four sentences.</p>
<p>And one of those sentences is the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be turned into Twitter.</p>
<p>All right, let me put it back.</p>
<p>I get really, so I&rsquo;ll try not to be emotional about this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve heard Anthony Fauci a couple of times now</p>
<p>say that he represents science.</p>
<p>I know what he means by that.</p>
<p>He means in this political bickering,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff that for a lot of people,</p>
<p>he represents science, but words matter.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t just clips.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe I&rsquo;m distinctly aware of that</p>
<p>doing this podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, I talked for hundreds of hours now,</p>
<p>maybe over a thousand hours,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m still careful with the words.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying not to be an asshole</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m aware when I&rsquo;m an asshole</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll apologize for it.</p>
<p>If the words I represent science left my mouth,</p>
<p>which they very well could,</p>
<p>I would sure as hell be apologizing for it</p>
<p>and not because I got in trouble,</p>
<p>I would just feel bad about saying something like that.</p>
<p>And even that little phrase, I represent science.</p>
<p>No, Dr. Fauci, you do not represent science.</p>
<p>I love science, the millions of scientists</p>
<p>that inspired me to get into it.</p>
<p>To fall in love with the scientific method</p>
<p>in the exploration of ideas through the rigor of science,</p>
<p>that Anthony Fauci does not represent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one, I believe, great scientist of millions.</p>
<p>He does not represent anybody.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just one scientist.</p>
<p>And I think the greatness of a scientist</p>
<p>is best exemplified in humility</p>
<p>because the scientific method basically says,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re standing before the fog, the mystery of it all,</p>
<p>and slowly chipping away at the mystery.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s embarrassing, it&rsquo;s humiliating</p>
<p>how little you know, that&rsquo;s the experience.</p>
<p>So the great scientists have to have humility to me.</p>
<p>And especially in their communication,</p>
<p>they have to have humility.</p>
<p>And I mean, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>and some of it is also words matter</p>
<p>because great leaders have to have the poetry of action.</p>
<p>They have to be bold and inspire action</p>
<p>across millions of people.</p>
<p>But you also have to, through that poetry of words,</p>
<p>express the complexity of the uncertainty</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re operating under.</p>
<p>Be humble in the face of not being able</p>
<p>to predict the future or understand the past,</p>
<p>or really know what&rsquo;s the right thing to do,</p>
<p>but we have to do something.</p>
<p>And through that, you have to be a great leader</p>
<p>that inspires action.</p>
<p>And some of that is just words.</p>
<p>And he chose words poorly.</p>
<p>I mean, so I&rsquo;m all torn about this.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s politicians, they&rsquo;re taking those words</p>
<p>and magnifying them and playing games with them.</p>
<p>And of course, that&rsquo;s a disincentive</p>
<p>for the people who do, the scientific leaders</p>
<p>that step into the limelight to say any more words.</p>
<p>So they kind of become more conservative</p>
<p>with the words they use.</p>
<p>I mean, it just becomes a giant mess.</p>
<p>But I think the solution is to ignore all of that</p>
<p>and to be transparent, to be honest, to be vulnerable.</p>
<p>And to express the full uncertainty</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re operating under,</p>
<p>to present all the possible actions</p>
<p>and to be honest about the mistakes they made in the past.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something, even if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>directly responsible for those mistakes,</p>
<p>taking responsibility for them is a way to win people over.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think leaders realize this often</p>
<p>in the modern age, in the internet age.</p>
<p>They can see through your bullshit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really inspiring when you take ownership.</p>
<p>So to do the thought experiment in public,</p>
<p>do a thought experiment if there was a lab leak</p>
<p>and then lay out all the funding, the EcoHealth Alliance,</p>
<p>all the incredible science going on at the Wuhan Institute</p>
<p>of Virology and the NIH.</p>
<p>Lay out all the possible ethical problems.</p>
<p>Lay out all the possible mistakes that could have been made</p>
<p>and say like, this could have happened.</p>
<p>And if this happened, here&rsquo;s the best way to respond to it</p>
<p>and to prevent it in the future.</p>
<p>And just lay all that complexity out.</p>
<p>I wish we would have seen that.</p>
<p>And I have hope that this conversation,</p>
<p>conversations like it, your work,</p>
<p>and books on this topic will inspire young people today</p>
<p>when they become in the Anthony Fauci&rsquo;s role</p>
<p>to be much more transparent and much more humble</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That this is just a relic of the past</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a person, no offense to me,</p>
<p>in a suit that has to stand up and speak</p>
<p>with clarity and certainty.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just a relic of the past.</p>
<p>Is my hope.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you mind if I&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, please.</p>
<p>I agree with a great deal of what you said.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really unfortunate that our,</p>
<p>certainly the Chinese government, as I said before,</p>
<p>our government wasn&rsquo;t as transparent</p>
<p>as I feel they should have been,</p>
<p>particularly in the early days of the pandemic</p>
<p>and particularly with regard to the issue</p>
<p>of pandemic origins.</p>
<p>I mean, we know that Dr. Fauci was on calls</p>
<p>with people like Christian Anderson and Scripps and others</p>
<p>in those early days, raising questions.</p>
<p>Is this an engineered virus?</p>
<p>There were a lot of questions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of sad.</p>
<p>I mean, as I mentioned before, I&rsquo;ve been one,</p>
<p>I mean, and certainly there were others,</p>
<p>but there weren&rsquo;t a lot of us,</p>
<p>of the people who from the earliest days of the pandemic</p>
<p>were raising questions about, hey, not so fast here.</p>
<p>And I launched my website on pandemic origins</p>
<p>in April of last year, April, 2020.</p>
<p>It got a huge amount of attention.</p>
<p>And actually my friend, Matt Pottinger,</p>
<p>who is the deputy national security advisor,</p>
<p>when he was reaching out to people in the US government</p>
<p>and in allied government saying,</p>
<p>hey, we should look into this,</p>
<p>what he was sending them was my website.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t some US government information.</p>
<p>And by the way, people should still go to the website.</p>
<p>You keep updating it and it&rsquo;s an incredible resource.</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, jamiemetzel.com.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really unfortunate that our governments</p>
<p>and international institutions for pretty much all of 2020</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t doing their jobs of really probing this issue.</p>
<p>People were hiding behind this kind of false consensus.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m critical of many people,</p>
<p>even when I heard Francis Collins interview with you,</p>
<p>I just felt, well, he wasn&rsquo;t as balanced</p>
<p>on the issue of COVID origins.</p>
<p>Certainly Dr. Fauci could have in his conversation</p>
<p>with Rand Paul, it wasn&rsquo;t even a conversation,</p>
<p>but in some process in the aftermath,</p>
<p>could have laid things out a bit better.</p>
<p>He did say, and Francis Collins did say</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know the origins and that was a shift</p>
<p>and we need to have an investigation.</p>
<p>So now, but having said all of that,</p>
<p>I do kind of one, I have tremendous respect for Dr. Fauci</p>
<p>for the work that he&rsquo;s done on HIV AIDS.</p>
<p>I mean, I have been vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci was a big part of the story</p>
<p>of getting us these vaccines</p>
<p>that have saved millions and millions of lives.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot to this story.</p>
<p>And then the second thing is it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>to be a public health expert</p>
<p>because you have your mission is public health.</p>
<p>And so, and you have to, if you are leading</p>
<p>with all of your uncertainty,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really hard way to do things.</p>
<p>And so like, even now, like if I go to CVS</p>
<p>and I get a Tylenol, somebody has done a calculation</p>
<p>of how many people will die from taking Tylenol</p>
<p>and they say, well, all right, we can live with that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have regulation.</p>
<p>And so all of us are doing kind of summaries.</p>
<p>And then we have people in public health who are saying,</p>
<p>wow, we&rsquo;ve summed it all up and you should do X.</p>
<p>You should get your kids vaccinated for measles.</p>
<p>You should not drive your car at a hundred miles an hour.</p>
<p>You should, don&rsquo;t drink lighter fluid,</p>
<p>whatever these things are.</p>
<p>And we want them to kind of give us broad guidelines.</p>
<p>And yet now our information world is so fragmented</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re not being honest about something,</p>
<p>something material, someone&rsquo;s going to find out</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to undermine your credibility.</p>
<p>And so I agree with you that there&rsquo;s a greater requirement</p>
<p>for transparency now.</p>
<p>Maybe there always has been,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an even greater requirement for it now</p>
<p>because people want to trust that you&rsquo;re speaking honestly</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re saying, well, here&rsquo;s what I know.</p>
<p>And this is based on what I know,</p>
<p>here are the conclusions that I draw.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s just, and again, I don&rsquo;t think the words,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m science or whatever it was are the right words.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s just, trust me because of who I am,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that flies anywhere anymore.</p>
<p>Can I just ask you about the Francis Collins interview</p>
<p>that I did, if you got a chance to hear that part.</p>
<p>I think in the beginning we talk about the lab leak.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about his response,</p>
<p>basically saying it&rsquo;s worthy of an investigation,</p>
<p>but I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how you would interpret it.</p>
<p>I see, it&rsquo;s funny because I heard it in the moment</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s great for the head of NIH</p>
<p>to be open minded on this.</p>
<p>But then the internet and Mr. Joe Rogan</p>
<p>and a bunch of friends and colleagues told me that,</p>
<p>yeah, well, that&rsquo;s too late and too little.</p>
<p>Yeah, so first let me say, I&rsquo;ve been on Joe&rsquo;s podcast twice</p>
<p>and I love the guy, which doesn&rsquo;t mean that I agree</p>
<p>with everything he does or says.</p>
<p>And on this issue, and I&rsquo;m normally a pretty calm</p>
<p>and measured guy, and when you&rsquo;re just out running</p>
<p>with your AirPods on and you start yelling</p>
<p>into the wind in Central Park,</p>
<p>nobody else knows why you&rsquo;re yelling, but well.</p>
<p>So that you had such a moment?</p>
<p>I had a moment with Collins.</p>
<p>And again, Francis Collins is someone I respect enormously.</p>
<p>I mean, I live a big chunk of my life living in the world</p>
<p>of genetics and biotech and my book, Hacking Darwin</p>
<p>is about the future of human genetic engineering</p>
<p>and his work on the Human Genome Project</p>
<p>and so many other things have been fantastic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the work of NIH.</p>
<p>And he was right to say that the Chinese government</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t been forthcoming and we need to look into it.</p>
<p>But then you asked him, well, how will we know?</p>
<p>And then his answer was,</p>
<p>we need to find the intermediate host.</p>
<p>Remember I said before, and so that made it clear</p>
<p>that he thought, well, we should have an investigation,</p>
<p>but it comes from nature and we just need to find</p>
<p>that whatever it is, that intermediate animal host</p>
<p>in the wild, and that&rsquo;ll tell us the story.</p>
<p>So he already had the conclusion in mind</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just waiting for the evidence</p>
<p>to support the conclusion.</p>
<p>That was my feeling.</p>
<p>I felt like he was open in general, but he was tilting.</p>
<p>And again, your first question was where do I fall?</p>
<p>He was like, I&rsquo;m 85% or whatever it is, 80, 75, 90,</p>
<p>whatever it is in the direction of a lab incident.</p>
<p>It made it feel that he was 90, 10 in the other direction,</p>
<p>which is still means that he&rsquo;s open minded</p>
<p>about the possibility.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, in my view, every single person</p>
<p>who talks about this issue,</p>
<p>I think the right answer in my view is,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know conclusively.</p>
<p>In my, then this is my personal view,</p>
<p>the circumstantial evidence is strongly in favor</p>
<p>of a lab incident origin,</p>
<p>but that could immediately shift</p>
<p>with additional information.</p>
<p>We need transparency, but we should come together</p>
<p>in absolutely condemning the outrageous coverup</p>
<p>carried out by the Chinese government,</p>
<p>which to this day is preventing any meaningful investigation</p>
<p>into pandemic origins.</p>
<p>We have, if you use the economist numbers,</p>
<p>15 million people who are dead as a result of this pandemic.</p>
<p>And I believe that the actions of the Chinese government</p>
<p>are disgracing the memory of these 15 million dead.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re insulting the families and the billions of people</p>
<p>around the world who have suffered</p>
<p>from this totally avoidable pandemic.</p>
<p>And whatever the origin, the fact the criminal coverup</p>
<p>carried out by the Chinese government,</p>
<p>which continues to this day, but most intensely</p>
<p>in the first months following the outbreak,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the reason why we have so many dead.</p>
<p>And certainly, as I was saying before,</p>
<p>I and a small number of others have been carrying this flame</p>
<p>since early last year, but it&rsquo;s kind of crazy</p>
<p>that our governments haven&rsquo;t been demanding it.</p>
<p>And we can talk about the World Health Organization process,</p>
<p>which was deeply compromised in the beginning.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s become much, much better.</p>
<p>But again, it was the pressure of outsiders</p>
<p>that played such an important role in shifting</p>
<p>our national and international institutions.</p>
<p>And while that&rsquo;s better than nothing,</p>
<p>it would have been far better if our governments</p>
<p>and international organizations</p>
<p>had done the right thing from the start.</p>
<p>If I could just make a couple of comments about Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of people in my life</p>
<p>who have inspired me, who have taught me a lot,</p>
<p>who I even look up to, many of them are alive,</p>
<p>most of them are dead.</p>
<p>I wanna say that Joe said a few critical words</p>
<p>about the conversation with Francis Collins,</p>
<p>most of it offline, with a lot of great conversations</p>
<p>about it, some he said publicly.</p>
<p>And he was also critical to say that me asking hard questions</p>
<p>in an interview is not my strong suit.</p>
<p>And I really want to kind of respond to that,</p>
<p>which I did privately as well, but publicly,</p>
<p>to say that Joe is 100% right on that.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that always has to be the case.</p>
<p>And that is definitely something I wanna work on.</p>
<p>Because most of the conversations I have,</p>
<p>I wanna see the beautiful ideas in people&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some times where you have to ask</p>
<p>the hard questions to bring out the beautiful ideas.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a skill.</p>
<p>And Joe is very good at this.</p>
<p>He says the way he put it in his criticisms,</p>
<p>and he does this in his conversations,</p>
<p>which is, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of sense like,</p>
<p>did you just say what you said?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make sure we get to the bottom,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll clarify what you mean.</p>
<p>Because sometimes really big negative or difficult ideas</p>
<p>can be said as a quick aside in a sentence,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s nothing, but it could be everything.</p>
<p>And you wanna make sure you catch that</p>
<p>and you talk about it.</p>
<p>And not as a gotcha, not as a kinda way</p>
<p>to destroy another human being,</p>
<p>but to reveal something profound.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s definitely something I wanna work on.</p>
<p>I also want to say that, as you said,</p>
<p>you disagree with Joe on quite a lot of things.</p>
<p>So for a long time, Joe was somebody</p>
<p>that I was just a fan of and listened to.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now a good friend.</p>
<p>And I would say we disagree more than we agree.</p>
<p>And I love doing that.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I learned from that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like dual, like nobody in this world</p>
<p>can tell me what to think.</p>
<p>But I think everybody has a lesson to teach me.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good way to approach it.</p>
<p>Whenever somebody has words of criticism,</p>
<p>I assume they&rsquo;re right and walk around with that idea</p>
<p>to really sort of empathize with that idea</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lesson there.</p>
<p>And oftentimes, my understanding of a topic</p>
<p>is altered completely or it becomes much more nuanced</p>
<p>or much richer for that kind of empathetic process.</p>
<p>But definitely, I do not allow anybody</p>
<p>to tell me what to think, whether it&rsquo;s Joe Rogan</p>
<p>or Fyodor Dostoevsky or Nietzsche or my parents</p>
<p>or the proverbial girlfriend, which I don&rsquo;t actually have.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s still busting my balls.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>In my imagination, I have a girlfriend in Canada</p>
<p>that I have imagined, exactly, imagining conversations.</p>
<p>So I want to mention that.</p>
<p>But also, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve gotten a chance</p>
<p>to see this, but I&rsquo;d love to also mention</p>
<p>this Twitter feud between two other interesting people,</p>
<p>which is Brett Weinstein and Sam Harris</p>
<p>or Sam Harris and others in general.</p>
<p>And it kind of breaks my heart that these two people</p>
<p>I listen to that are very thoughtful about a bunch of issues.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put COVID aside because people are very emotional</p>
<p>about this topic.</p>
<p>I mean, I think they&rsquo;re deeply thoughtful and intelligent,</p>
<p>whether you agree with them or not.</p>
<p>And I always learn something from their conversations.</p>
<p>And they are legitimately or have been</p>
<p>for a long time friends.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a little bit heartbreaking to me</p>
<p>to see that they basically don&rsquo;t talk in private anymore.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s occasional jabs on Twitter.</p>
<p>And I hope that changes.</p>
<p>I hope that changes in general for COVID,</p>
<p>that COVID brought out the, I would say,</p>
<p>the most emotional sides of people, the worst in people.</p>
<p>And I think there hasn&rsquo;t been enough love</p>
<p>and empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>And to see two people from whom I&rsquo;ve learned a lot,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Eric Weinstein, Brett Weinstein, Sam Harris,</p>
<p>you can criticize them as much as you want,</p>
<p>their ideas as much as you want.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not sufficiently open minded</p>
<p>to admit that you have a lot to learn</p>
<p>from their conversations, I think you&rsquo;re not being honest.</p>
<p>And so I do hope they have those conversations.</p>
<p>And I hope we can kind of,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of repairing to be done post COVID</p>
<p>of relationships, of conversations.</p>
<p>And I think empathy and love can help a lot there.</p>
<p>This is also just a, I talked to Sam privately,</p>
<p>but this is also a public call out</p>
<p>to put a little bit more love in the world.</p>
<p>And for these difficult conversations to happen.</p>
<p>Because Brett Weinstein could be very wrong</p>
<p>about a bunch of topics here around COVID,</p>
<p>but he could also be right.</p>
<p>And the only way to find out</p>
<p>is to have those conversations.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot of people listening</p>
<p>to both Sam Harris and Brett Weinstein.</p>
<p>And if you go into these silos</p>
<p>where you just keep telling each other</p>
<p>that you are the possessors of truth</p>
<p>and nobody else is the possessor of truth,</p>
<p>what starts happening is you both lose track</p>
<p>or the capability of arriving at the truth.</p>
<p>Because nobody&rsquo;s in the possession of the truth.</p>
<p>So anyway, this is just a call out</p>
<p>that we should have a little bit more conversation,</p>
<p>a little bit more love.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>And both of those guys are guys who I respect.</p>
<p>And as you know, Brett, and again, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just a handful of us,</p>
<p>who were the early people raising questions</p>
<p>about the origins of this.</p>
<p>Of this pandemic, right.</p>
<p>He was there also talking.</p>
<p>So people have heard him speak quite a bit</p>
<p>about any viral drugs and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But he was also raising concerns about lab leak early on.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And so, but I completely agree with you</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have to agree with everybody,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s great to have healthy conversations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we grow.</p>
<p>And absolutely, we live in a world where we&rsquo;re kind of,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re not careful,</p>
<p>pushed into these little information pockets.</p>
<p>And certainly on social media,</p>
<p>I have different parts of my life.</p>
<p>One is focusing on issues of COVID origins.</p>
<p>And then I have genetics and biotechnology.</p>
<p>And then I have, which maybe we&rsquo;ll talk about later,</p>
<p>one shared world, which is about</p>
<p>how do we build a safer future?</p>
<p>And when I say critical things like the Chinese government,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d have to demand a full investigation</p>
<p>into pandemic origins.</p>
<p>This is an outreach.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s really popular.</p>
<p>When I say, let&rsquo;s build a better future</p>
<p>for everyone in peace and love,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, wow, three people liked it.</p>
<p>And one was my mother.</p>
<p>And so I just feel like we need to build,</p>
<p>we used to have that connectivity just built in</p>
<p>because we had these town squares</p>
<p>and you couldn&rsquo;t get away from them.</p>
<p>Now we can get away from them.</p>
<p>So engaging with people who are of a different background</p>
<p>is really essential.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on Fox News sometimes three, four times a week.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t, in my normal life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not watching that much of Fox News</p>
<p>or even television more generally.</p>
<p>But I just feel like if I just speak to people</p>
<p>who are very similar to me, maybe it&rsquo;ll be comfortable.</p>
<p>But what have I contributed?</p>
<p>So I think we really have to have</p>
<p>those kinds of conversations and recognize</p>
<p>that at the end of the day, most people want to be happy.</p>
<p>They want to live in a better world.</p>
<p>They maybe have different paths to get there.</p>
<p>But if we just break into camps</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t even connect with each other,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a much more dangerous world.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive back into the difficult pool.</p>
<p>Just like you said, in the English speaking world,</p>
<p>it seems popular, almost easy to demonize China.</p>
<p>The Chinese government, I should say.</p>
<p>But even China, like there&rsquo;s this kind of gray area</p>
<p>that people just fall into.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really uncomfortable with that.</p>
<p>Perhaps because in my mind, in my heart, in my blood</p>
<p>are echoes of the Cold War and that kind of tension.</p>
<p>But it feels like we almost desire conflict.</p>
<p>So we see demons when there is none.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a little cautious to demonize.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you have to be honest.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like honest with the demons that are there</p>
<p>and honest when they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>This is kind of a geopolitical therapy session of sorts.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s keep talking about China</p>
<p>a little bit from different angles.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s return to the director of the Center</p>
<p>of Emerging Infectious Disease</p>
<p>at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Xi Zhengli,</p>
<p>colloquially referred to as Batwoman.</p>
<p>So do you think she&rsquo;s lying?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you think she&rsquo;s being forced to lie?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known a bunch of virologists</p>
<p>in private and public conversation</p>
<p>that respect her as a human being, as a scientist.</p>
<p>I respect her as a human being.</p>
<p>Sorry, as a scientist, not a human being.</p>
<p>Because I think they don&rsquo;t know the human.</p>
<p>They know the scientists.</p>
<p>And they respect her a lot as a scientist.</p>
<p>Yeah, I respect her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met her.</p>
<p>We had one exchange, which I&rsquo;ll mention in a second</p>
<p>in a virtual forum.</p>
<p>But I do respect her.</p>
<p>I actually think that she is somebody</p>
<p>who has tried to do the right thing.</p>
<p>She was one of the heroes of tracking down</p>
<p>the origins of SARS 1.</p>
<p>And that was a major contribution.</p>
<p>But as we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different thing living, being a scientist,</p>
<p>or really kind of anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different being one of those people</p>
<p>in an authoritarian society</p>
<p>than it is being in a different type of society.</p>
<p>And so when Xi Zhengli said that the reason</p>
<p>the WIV database was taken offline in September 19</p>
<p>was because of computer hacks,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the story.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think she thinks that&rsquo;s the story.</p>
<p>When I asked her in March of 2021, March of this year,</p>
<p>in a Rutgers online forum,</p>
<p>when I asked her whether the Chinese military</p>
<p>had any engagement with the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>in any way, and she said, absolutely not, paraphrasing,</p>
<p>I think she was lying.</p>
<p>Do I think that she had the ability to say,</p>
<p>well, either one, yes, but I can&rsquo;t talk about it,</p>
<p>or I know there are a lot of things</p>
<p>that are happening at this institute</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know about, and that could be one.</p>
<p>Could she have said that the personnel</p>
<p>at the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>have all had to go through classification training</p>
<p>so that they can know about what can and can&rsquo;t be said?</p>
<p>Like she could have said all those things,</p>
<p>but she couldn&rsquo;t say all of those things.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why so many, at least in my view,</p>
<p>so many people certainly in the Western world</p>
<p>got this story wrong from the beginning,</p>
<p>because if your only prism was the science,</p>
<p>and you just assumed this is a science question</p>
<p>to be left to the scientists,</p>
<p>should Zhengli is just like any scientist</p>
<p>working in Switzerland or Norway,</p>
<p>the Chinese government isn&rsquo;t interfering in any way,</p>
<p>and we can trust them, that would lead you down one path.</p>
<p>In my view, the reason why I progressed as I did</p>
<p>is I felt like I had two keys,</p>
<p>and I had one key as I live in the science world</p>
<p>through my work with WHO and my books and things like that.</p>
<p>But I also have another part of my life</p>
<p>in the world of geopolitics as an Asia quote unquote expert</p>
<p>and former National Security Council official</p>
<p>and other things.</p>
<p>And I felt for me, I needed both keys to open that door.</p>
<p>But if I only had the science key,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have had the level of doubt and suspicion</p>
<p>that I have.</p>
<p>But if my starting point was only doubt and suspicion,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s coming from China,</p>
<p>it must be that the government is guilty,</p>
<p>like that wouldn&rsquo;t help either.</p>
<p>I wonder what&rsquo;s in her mind,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s fear or habit,</p>
<p>because I think a lot of people in the former Soviet Union,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like Chernobyl, it&rsquo;s not really fear,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a momentum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the reason I showed up to this interview</p>
<p>wearing clothes, as opposed to being naked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just all of us are doing the clothes thing.</p>
<p>Although there was a startup years ago called Naked News.</p>
<p>Did you ever hear about that?</p>
<p>They just would read the exact news.</p>
<p>With naked.</p>
<p>No, after each story, they&rsquo;d take something off</p>
<p>until the end, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea for a podcast.</p>
<p>They have an IPO.</p>
<p>Stay tuned, next time I&rsquo;m with Michael Miles.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what do you think,</p>
<p>I mean, because the reason I asked that question is,</p>
<p>how do we kind of take steps to improve</p>
<p>without any kind of revolutionary action?</p>
<p>You could say, we need to inspire the Chinese people</p>
<p>to elect, to sort of revolutionize the system</p>
<p>from within, but like, who are we to suggest that?</p>
<p>Because we have our flaws too.</p>
<p>We should be working on our flaws as well.</p>
<p>And so, but at the individual scientist level,</p>
<p>what are the small acts of rebellion that could be done?</p>
<p>How can we improve this?</p>
<p>Well, so I don&rsquo;t know about small acts of rebellion,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll try to answer your question</p>
<p>from a few different perspectives.</p>
<p>So right now, actually, as we speak,</p>
<p>there is a special session</p>
<p>of the World Health Assembly going on.</p>
<p>And the World Health Assembly is the governing authority</p>
<p>over the World Health Organization,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s represented by states and territories,</p>
<p>194 of them, tragically not including Taiwan,</p>
<p>because of the Chinese government&rsquo;s assistance.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re now beginning a process</p>
<p>of trying to negotiate a global pandemic treaty</p>
<p>to try to have a better process</p>
<p>for responding to crises exactly like we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, for the exact same reasons</p>
<p>that we have failed, I mean, we had a similar process</p>
<p>after the first SARS, we set up what we thought</p>
<p>was the best available system,</p>
<p>and it has totally failed here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s failed here because of the inherent pathologies</p>
<p>of the Chinese government system.</p>
<p>We are suffering from a pandemic that exists</p>
<p>because of the internal pathologies of the Chinese state.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why on one hand, I totally get this impulse.</p>
<p>Well, we do it our way, they do it their way.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s to say that one way is better?</p>
<p>And certainly right now in the United States,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at each other&rsquo;s throats.</p>
<p>We have a hard time getting anything meaningful done.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there are people who are saying,</p>
<p>well, that model looks appealing.</p>
<p>But just as people could look to the United States</p>
<p>and say, well, because the United States</p>
<p>has such a massive reach, what we do domestically</p>
<p>has huge implications for the rest of the world,</p>
<p>they become stakeholders in our politics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think for a lot of years,</p>
<p>people have just been looking at US politics,</p>
<p>not because it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>but because the decisions that we make</p>
<p>have big implications for their lives.</p>
<p>The same is true for ours.</p>
<p>You could say that the lack of civil and political rights</p>
<p>in China is, I mean, it&rsquo;s up to the Chinese,</p>
<p>not even people, because they have no say,</p>
<p>but to their government.</p>
<p>And they weren&rsquo;t democratically elected,</p>
<p>that they are recognized as the government.</p>
<p>But some significant percentage of the 15 million people</p>
<p>now dead from COVID are dead</p>
<p>because in the earliest days following the outbreak,</p>
<p>whatever the origin, the voices of people</p>
<p>sounding the alarm were suppressed,</p>
<p>that the Chinese government had an,</p>
<p>just like in Chernobyl, the Chinese government</p>
<p>had a greater incentive to lie</p>
<p>to the international community than to tell the truth.</p>
<p>And everybody was incentivized</p>
<p>to pretty much do the wrong thing.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I think one of the big messages</p>
<p>of this pandemic is that all of our fates</p>
<p>are tied to everybody else&rsquo;s fates.</p>
<p>And so while we can say and should say,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s focus on our own communities and our countries,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all stakeholders in what happens elsewhere.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a weird question?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna do a few podcast interviews</p>
<p>with interesting people in Russia, in the Russian language,</p>
<p>because I could speak Russian.</p>
<p>And a lot of those people have,</p>
<p>are not usually speaking in these kinds of formats.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to interview Xi Jinping?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to interview somebody like her</p>
<p>or anyone in the Chinese government?</p>
<p>I think not.</p>
<p>And I think the reason is</p>
<p>because I think they would, one,</p>
<p>be uncomfortable being in any environment</p>
<p>where really unknown questions will be asked.</p>
<p>And I actually, so as you know, on this topic,</p>
<p>the Chinese, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the Chinese government has a gag order on Chinese scientists.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t speak without prior government approval.</p>
<p>Xu Zhengli has been able to speak.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s spoken at a number of forums.</p>
<p>I mentioned this Rutgers event.</p>
<p>What was the nature of that forum, the Rutgers event?</p>
<p>All of them were kind of science conversations</p>
<p>about the pandemic, including the origins issue.</p>
<p>But I think that she, in her response to my question,</p>
<p>it was kind of this funny thing.</p>
<p>So they had this event organized by Rutgers.</p>
<p>And I went on, there was an online event on Zoom,</p>
<p>but I got on there and I just realized</p>
<p>it was very poorly organized.</p>
<p>Like normally the controls that you would have</p>
<p>about who gets to chat to who, who gets to ask questions,</p>
<p>none of them were set.</p>
<p>And so I kind of couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>I was just sitting at home in my neon green fleece</p>
<p>and I just started sending chat messages to Xu Zhengli.</p>
<p>So you could, anybody could send any.</p>
<p>Anybody could, it was insane.</p>
<p>But I thought, wow, this is incredible.</p>
<p>And so then it was unclear who got to ask questions.</p>
<p>And so I was like posting questions</p>
<p>and then I was sending chats to the organizers</p>
<p>of the event saying, I really have a question.</p>
<p>And first they said, well, you can submit your questions</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have submitted questions.</p>
<p>And then if we have time, we&rsquo;ll open up.</p>
<p>So I just, I mean, I just thought, well, what the hell?</p>
<p>I just sent messages to everybody.</p>
<p>And then the event was already done.</p>
<p>They were 15 minutes over time.</p>
<p>And then they said, all right,</p>
<p>we have time just for one question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s Jamie Metzl.</p>
<p>And like, as I&rsquo;m sitting there in my running clothes,</p>
<p>like I wasn&rsquo;t, I was like multitasking and I heard my name.</p>
<p>And so I went diving back and I asked this question</p>
<p>about, did you know all of the work that was happening</p>
<p>at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, not just your work?</p>
<p>And can you confirm that US intelligence has said</p>
<p>that the military played a role,</p>
<p>was engaged with the Wuhan Institute of Virology?</p>
<p>Do you deny that the Chinese military was involved</p>
<p>in any way with the Wuhan Institute of Virology?</p>
<p>And as I said before, she said, this is crazy.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>It got, it actually got,</p>
<p>that one question got covered in the media</p>
<p>because it was like, I think an essential question.</p>
<p>But I just think that since then, to my knowledge,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not been in any public forums,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why most people would be shocked</p>
<p>that to date there has been no comprehensive</p>
<p>international investigation into pandemic origins.</p>
<p>There is no whistleblower provision.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re, my guess is there are at least tens,</p>
<p>maybe hundreds of people in China</p>
<p>who have relevant information</p>
<p>about the origins of the pandemic who are terrified</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t dare share it.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just say somebody wanted</p>
<p>to get that information out, to send it somewhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no official address.</p>
<p>The WHO doesn&rsquo;t have that, nobody has that.</p>
<p>And so I would love, I mean, you may as well ask.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely that there&rsquo;ll be a yes,</p>
<p>but it could well be that there are defectors</p>
<p>who will want to speak.</p>
<p>So let me also push back on this idea.</p>
<p>So one, I want to ask if the language barrier is a thing.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve talked to,</p>
<p>so I understand Russian culture, I think,</p>
<p>or not understand, this is the thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand basically anything in this world.</p>
<p>But I mean, I hear the music that is Russian culture</p>
<p>and I enjoy it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hear that music for Chinese culture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not something I&rsquo;ve experienced.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a beautiful, rich, complex culture.</p>
<p>And from my sense, it seems distant to me.</p>
<p>Like whenever I look, even like we mentioned offline Japan</p>
<p>and so on, I probably don&rsquo;t even understand</p>
<p>Japanese culture.</p>
<p>I believe I kind of do because I did martial arts</p>
<p>my whole life, but even that, it&rsquo;s just so distant.</p>
<p>People who&rsquo;ve lived in Japan, foreigners for like 20 years</p>
<p>say the exact same thing, yeah.</p>
<p>This makes me sad.</p>
<p>It makes me sad because I will never be able</p>
<p>to fully appreciate the literature, the conversations,</p>
<p>the people, the little humor and the subtleties.</p>
<p>And those are all essential to understand</p>
<p>even this cold topics of science.</p>
<p>Because all of that is important to understand.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a question for me if you think</p>
<p>language barriers a thing.</p>
<p>But the other thing I just want to kind of comment on</p>
<p>is the criticism of journalism that somebody like</p>
<p>Shi Zhengli or even Shi Zhengpeng, just anybody in China,</p>
<p>very skeptical to have really conversations</p>
<p>with anybody in the western media.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like what are the odds that they will try</p>
<p>to bring out the beautiful ideas in the person.</p>
<p>And honestly, this is a harsh criticism.</p>
<p>I apologize, but I kind of mean it, is the journalists</p>
<p>that have some of these high profile conversations</p>
<p>often don&rsquo;t do the work.</p>
<p>They come off as not very intelligent.</p>
<p>And I know they&rsquo;re intelligent people.</p>
<p>They have not done the research.</p>
<p>They have not come up and like read a bunch of books.</p>
<p>They have not even read the Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>Meaning put in the minimal effort to empathize,</p>
<p>to try to understand the culture of the people,</p>
<p>all the complexities, all the different ideas in the spaces.</p>
<p>Do all the incredible, not all,</p>
<p>but some of the incredible work that you&rsquo;ve done initially.</p>
<p>Like that, you have to do that work to earn the right</p>
<p>to have a deep real conversation with some of these folks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just disappointing to me</p>
<p>that journalists often don&rsquo;t do that work.</p>
<p>Yeah, so on that, just first I completely agree with you.</p>
<p>I mean, there is just an incredible beauty</p>
<p>in Chinese culture and I think all cultures,</p>
<p>but certainly China has such a deep and rich history,</p>
<p>amazing literature and art and just human beings.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a massive critic of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very vociferous about the really genocide in Xinjiang,</p>
<p>the absolute effort to destroy Tibetan culture,</p>
<p>the destruction of democracy in Hong Kong,</p>
<p>incredibly illegal efforts to seize</p>
<p>basically the entire South China Sea.</p>
<p>And I could go on and on and on.</p>
<p>But Chinese culture is fantastic.</p>
<p>And I mean, I can&rsquo;t speak to every technical field,</p>
<p>but just in terms of having journalists,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll speak to American journalists,</p>
<p>people like Peter Hessler who have really invested the time</p>
<p>to live in China, to learn the language, learn the culture.</p>
<p>Peter himself, who is maybe one of our best journalists</p>
<p>covering China from a soul level,</p>
<p>he was kicked out of China.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very, very difficult.</p>
<p>His stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really, and so for me,</p>
<p>you talked about my website on pandemic origins.</p>
<p>So when I launched it, I had it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a Chinese speaker,</p>
<p>but I had the entire site translated into Chinese</p>
<p>and I have it up on my website just because I felt like,</p>
<p>well, if somebody, I mean, the great firewall</p>
<p>makes it very, very difficult for people in China</p>
<p>to access that kind of information.</p>
<p>But I figured if somebody gets there</p>
<p>and they wanna have it in their own language.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard because the Chinese government</p>
<p>is represented by these quote unquote wolf warriors,</p>
<p>which is, it&rsquo;s like these basic ruffians.</p>
<p>And I personally was condemned by name</p>
<p>by the spokesman of the Chinese foreign ministry</p>
<p>from the podium in Beijing.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really hard because I absolutely think</p>
<p>the American people and the Chinese people,</p>
<p>I mean, maybe all people, but we have so much in common.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, China is an ancient civilization,</p>
<p>but they kind of wiped out their own civilization</p>
<p>in the great leap forward and cultural revolution.</p>
<p>They burned their scrolls, they smashed their artworks.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a very young society,</p>
<p>kind of like America is a young society.</p>
<p>So we have a lot in common.</p>
<p>And if we just kind of got out of our own ways,</p>
<p>we could have a beautiful relationship,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of things that are happening.</p>
<p>Certainly the United States feels responsible</p>
<p>to defend the post war international order</p>
<p>that past generations helped build.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a certain believer in that</p>
<p>and China is challenging that and the Chinese government</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve shared that with that view</p>
<p>with the Chinese people feel</p>
<p>that they haven&rsquo;t been adequately respected.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re building a massive nuclear arsenal</p>
<p>and all these other things to try to position themselves</p>
<p>in the world with an articulated goal</p>
<p>of being the lead country in the world.</p>
<p>And that puts them at odds with the United States.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of real reasons</p>
<p>that we need to be honest about for division.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s all we focus on,</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t say that there&rsquo;s another side of the story</p>
<p>that brings us together,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll put ourselves on an inevitable glide path</p>
<p>to a terrible outcome.</p>
<p>What do you make of Xi Jinping?</p>
<p>So two questions.</p>
<p>So one in general and two more on lab leak</p>
<p>and his meeting with our president Biden</p>
<p>in discussion of lab leak.</p>
<p>So I feel that Xi Jinping has a very narrow goal</p>
<p>articulated of establishing China</p>
<p>as the lead country in the world</p>
<p>by the 100th anniversary of the founding</p>
<p>of the modern Chinese state.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s ruthless and it&rsquo;s strategic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great book called The Long Game by Rush Doshi</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s actually now working in the White House</p>
<p>about this goal and our pretty clearly articulated goal</p>
<p>to subvert the post war international order</p>
<p>and in China&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>And maybe every leader wants to organize the world</p>
<p>around their interest.</p>
<p>But I feel that his vision of what that entails</p>
<p>is not one that I think is shareable</p>
<p>for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>I mean, the strength of the United States</p>
<p>with all of our flaws is particularly</p>
<p>in that post war period,</p>
<p>we put forward a model that was desirable</p>
<p>to a lot of people.</p>
<p>Certainly it was desirable to people in Western Europe</p>
<p>and then Eastern Europe and Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>The United States is deeply flawed.</p>
<p>As articulated to date,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think most people and countries</p>
<p>would like to live in a Sinocentric world.</p>
<p>And so I certainly, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge critic of what Xi Jinping is doing,</p>
<p>the incredible brutality in Xinjiang,</p>
<p>in Tibet and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, the censorship one gives me a lot of trouble</p>
<p>on the science realm and just in journalism</p>
<p>and just the world that prevents us</p>
<p>from having conversations with each other.</p>
<p>Do you know about the Winnie the Pooh thing?</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>So to me, that&rsquo;s such a good illustration</p>
<p>of censorship being petty.</p>
<p>But censorship has to be petty</p>
<p>because the goal of censorship,</p>
<p>maybe you experienced in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>is to get into your head.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s just censorship,</p>
<p>like you say down with the state</p>
<p>and like you can&rsquo;t say that,</p>
<p>but you can say all the other things up to that point,</p>
<p>eventually people will feel empowered</p>
<p>to say down with the state.</p>
<p>And so I think the goal</p>
<p>of this kind of authoritarian censorship</p>
<p>is to turn you into the censor.</p>
<p>And so the&hellip;</p>
<p>Like self censor.</p>
<p>Yeah, because they almost have to have you think,</p>
<p>well, if I&rsquo;m gonna make any criticism,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re gonna come and get me.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s safer to not do it.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve traveled through North Korea</p>
<p>pretty extensively and I&rsquo;ve seen that in its ultimate form,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re trying to do in China too.</p>
<p>Yeah, so for people who are not familiar,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a clear illustration</p>
<p>of just the pettiness of censorship</p>
<p>and leaders, the corrupting nature of power.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a meme of Xi Jinping</p>
<p>with, I guess, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>And the meme is that he looks like Winnie the Pooh</p>
<p>in that picture.</p>
<p>And that was the President Xi Jinping</p>
<p>looks like Winnie the Pooh.</p>
<p>And I guess that became, because that got censored,</p>
<p>like mentions of Winnie the Pooh got censored</p>
<p>all across China.</p>
<p>Winnie the Pooh became the unknowing revolutionary hero</p>
<p>that represents freedom of speech and so on.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just such a absurd&hellip;</p>
<p>Because we spend so much time in this conversation</p>
<p>talking about the censorship</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit more understandable to me,</p>
<p>which is like, we messed up.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t, maybe it&rsquo;s almost understandable errors</p>
<p>that happen in the progress of science.</p>
<p>I mean, you could always argue</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of mistakes along the way</p>
<p>and the censorship along the way caused the big mistake.</p>
<p>You can argue that same way for the Chernobyl.</p>
<p>But those are sort of understandable and difficult topics.</p>
<p>Like Winnie the Pooh.</p>
<p>But in your message, it shows both sides of the story.</p>
<p>I mean, one, how petty authoritarian censors have to be.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the messaging from the Chinese government</p>
<p>is so consistent.</p>
<p>No matter who you are,</p>
<p>you have to be careful what you say.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s the story of Peng Shui,</p>
<p>the tennis player.</p>
<p>She dared raise her voice in an individual way.</p>
<p>Jack Ma, the richest man in China,</p>
<p>had a minor criticism of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>He had basically disappeared from the public eye.</p>
<p>Fan Bingbing, who&rsquo;s like one of the leading</p>
<p>Chinese movie stars,</p>
<p>she was seen as not loyal enough and she just vanished.</p>
<p>And so the message is no matter who you are,</p>
<p>no matter what level,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t mind everything you say,</p>
<p>you could lose everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty hopeful, optimistic about a lot of things.</p>
<p>And so for me, if the Chinese government stays</p>
<p>with its current structure,</p>
<p>I think what I hope they start fixing</p>
<p>is the freedom of speech.</p>
<p>But they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing is if they open up freedom of speech</p>
<p>really in a meaningful way,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t maintain their current form of government.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s connected, as I was saying before,</p>
<p>to the origins of the pandemic.</p>
<p>I mean, if my hypothesis was right,</p>
<p>that was the big choice that the national government had.</p>
<p>Do we really investigate the origins of the pandemic?</p>
<p>Do we deliver a message that transparency is required,</p>
<p>public transparency is required from local officials?</p>
<p>If they do that, the entire system collapsed.</p>
<p>Pretty much everybody in China has a relative</p>
<p>who has died as a result of the actions</p>
<p>of the Communist Party,</p>
<p>particularly in the Great Leap Forward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nearly 50 million people died</p>
<p>as a result of Mao&rsquo;s disastrous policies.</p>
<p>And yet why is Mao&rsquo;s picture still on Tiananmen Square</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s on the money?</p>
<p>Because maintaining that fiction</p>
<p>is the foundation of the legitimacy of the Chinese state.</p>
<p>If people were allowed, just say what you want.</p>
<p>Do you really think Mao was such a great guy,</p>
<p>even though your own relatives are dead as a result?</p>
<p>Do you really buy even on this story</p>
<p>that China did nothing wrong,</p>
<p>even though in the earliest days of the pandemic,</p>
<p>these two, at least Chinese scientists themselves,</p>
<p>courageously issued a preprint paper</p>
<p>that was later almost certainly forcibly retracted,</p>
<p>saying, well, this looks like this comes</p>
<p>from one of the Wuhan labs that we&rsquo;re studying.</p>
<p>Like if you opened up that window,</p>
<p>I think that the Chinese government</p>
<p>would not be able to continue in its current form.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they cracked down at Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why with Feng Shui, the tennis player,</p>
<p>if they had let her accuse somebody</p>
<p>from the Communist Party of sexual assault,</p>
<p>and they said, okay, now people,</p>
<p>you can use social media</p>
<p>and you can have your me too moment</p>
<p>and let us know who in the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>or your boss in a business has assaulted you.</p>
<p>Just like in every society,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s tons of women</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been sexually assaulted, manipulated, abused by men.</p>
<p>And so I certainly hope</p>
<p>that there can be that kind of opening.</p>
<p>But if I were an authoritarian dictator,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing I would be most afraid of.</p>
<p>Yeah, dictator perhaps,</p>
<p>but I think you can gradually increase the freedom of speech.</p>
<p>So I think you can maintain control over the freedom</p>
<p>of press first.</p>
<p>So control the press more,</p>
<p>but let the lower levels sort of open up YouTube, right?</p>
<p>Open up like where individual citizens can make content.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of benefits to that.</p>
<p>And then from an authoritarian perspective,</p>
<p>you can just say that&rsquo;s misinformation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s conspiracy theories, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But at least I think if you open up that freedom of speech</p>
<p>at the level of the individual citizen,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good for entrepreneurship,</p>
<p>for the development of ideas,</p>
<p>of exchange of ideas, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I just think that increased the GDP of the country.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a lot of benefits.</p>
<p>I feel like you can still play,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re playing some like dark thoughts here,</p>
<p>but I feel like you could still play the game of thrones,</p>
<p>still maintain power while giving freedom to the citizenry.</p>
<p>Like I think just like with North Korea is a good example</p>
<p>of where cracking down too much</p>
<p>can completely destroy your country.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s some balance you can strike in your evil mind</p>
<p>and still maintain authoritarian control over the country.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s not obvious,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a big supporter of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems to work really well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the failure cases</p>
<p>for freedom of speech are.</p>
<p>Probably we&rsquo;re experiencing them with Twitter</p>
<p>and like where the nature of truth</p>
<p>is being completely kind of flipped upside down.</p>
<p>But it seems like on the whole,</p>
<p>ability to defeat lies with more,</p>
<p>not through censorship, but through more conversations,</p>
<p>more information is the right way to go.</p>
<p>Can I tell you a little story, true stories</p>
<p>about North Korea?</p>
<p>So a number of years ago, I was invited</p>
<p>to be part of a small six person delegation</p>
<p>advising the government of North Korea</p>
<p>on how to establish special economic zones</p>
<p>because other countries have used these SEZs</p>
<p>as a way of building their economies.</p>
<p>And when I was invited, I thought,</p>
<p>well, maybe there&rsquo;s an opening.</p>
<p>And I certainly believe in that.</p>
<p>So we flew to China across the border into North Korea.</p>
<p>And then we were met by our partners</p>
<p>from the North Korean Development Organization.</p>
<p>And then we zigzagged the country for almost two weeks</p>
<p>visiting all these sites for where they were intended</p>
<p>to create these special economic zones.</p>
<p>And in each site, they had their local officials</p>
<p>and they had a map and they showed us where everything</p>
<p>that was going to be built.</p>
<p>And the other people who were like really technical experts</p>
<p>on how to set up a special economic zone,</p>
<p>they were asking questions, well, like,</p>
<p>should you put the entrance over here</p>
<p>or shouldn&rsquo;t you put it over there</p>
<p>and what if there&rsquo;s flooding?</p>
<p>And I kept asking just these basic questions,</p>
<p>like, what do you think you&rsquo;re going to do here?</p>
<p>Why do you think you can be competitive?</p>
<p>Do you know anything about who you&rsquo;re competing against?</p>
<p>Are you empowering your workers to innovate</p>
<p>because everybody else is innovating?</p>
<p>So at the end of the trip, they flew us to Pyongyang</p>
<p>and they put us in this,</p>
<p>it looked kind of like the United Nations.</p>
<p>They probably had 500 people there</p>
<p>and I gave a speech to them.</p>
<p>I obviously was in English and it was translated</p>
<p>and I figured, you know, I&rsquo;ve come all this way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to be honest.</p>
<p>If they arrest me for being honest, that&rsquo;s on them.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;m here because I believe</p>
<p>we can never give up hope,</p>
<p>that we always have to try to connect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also here because I think that North Korea</p>
<p>connecting to the world economy is an important first step.</p>
<p>But having visited all of your special economic zone sites</p>
<p>and having met with all of your, or many of your officials,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think your plan has any chance of succeeding</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re trying to sell into a global market,</p>
<p>but you need to have market information that,</p>
<p>and I gave examples of GE and others</p>
<p>that the innovation can&rsquo;t only happen at one place.</p>
<p>And if you want innovation to happen</p>
<p>from the people who are doing this,</p>
<p>you have to empower them, they have to have access,</p>
<p>they have to have voice.</p>
<p>I mean, nobody, I mean, the people after,</p>
<p>they kind of had to condemn me</p>
<p>because what I was saying was challenging.</p>
<p>So I certainly agree with you.</p>
<p>And then just one side story of then that night,</p>
<p>and it was just kind of bizarre</p>
<p>because North Korea is, it&rsquo;s so desperately poor,</p>
<p>but they were trying to impress us.</p>
<p>And so we had these embarrassingly sumptuous banquets.</p>
<p>And so for our final dinner that night,</p>
<p>really it looked like something from Beauty and the Beast.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like China and waiters and tuxedos,</p>
<p>and they had this beautiful dinner.</p>
<p>And then afterwards,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;d now spent two weeks</p>
<p>with our North Korean partners,</p>
<p>they brought out this karaoke machine</p>
<p>and our North Korean counterparts,</p>
<p>they sang songs to us in Korean.</p>
<p>And so I said, well, we want to reciprocate.</p>
<p>Do you have any English songs on your karaoke machine?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s North Korea, obviously they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But there was, I said, well, I have an idea.</p>
<p>And so there was one of the women</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d been part of the North Korean delegation.</p>
<p>She was able just to play the piano,</p>
<p>just like you could hum a tune</p>
<p>and she could play it on the piano.</p>
<p>And so I said, all right, here&rsquo;s this tune,</p>
<p>which I whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>When I give you the signal,</p>
<p>just play this tune over and over.</p>
<p>And so I got these, I mean, there were the six of us</p>
<p>and maybe 20 North Koreans,</p>
<p>and we were all in a circle,</p>
<p>so everybody hold hands and then put your right,</p>
<p>just try to put your right foot in front of your left</p>
<p>and then left foot in front of the right, going sideways.</p>
<p>And I said, all right, hit it.</p>
<p>And she played a North Korean version of Hava Nagila.</p>
<p>And I think it was the first</p>
<p>and only horror that they&rsquo;ve ever done in North Korea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>I survived.</p>
<p>Was this recorded or no?</p>
<p>It was not.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Yeah, if they had free YouTube,</p>
<p>this would have been a big one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s return to the beginning</p>
<p>and just patient zero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of always incredible to think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s one human at which it all started.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who do you think was patient zero?</p>
<p>Do you think it was somebody that worked</p>
<p>at Wuhan Institute of Virology?</p>
<p>Do you think there was a leak of some other kind</p>
<p>that led to the infection?</p>
<p>What do we know?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s this December 8th slash December 16th case</p>
<p>of maybe you can describe what that is.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>Michael Warobey has a nice timeline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you have a timeline.</p>
<p>But he has a nice timeline that puts the average</p>
<p>at like November something, like 18th and November 16th</p>
<p>as the average estimate for when the patient zero</p>
<p>got infected, when the first human infection happened.</p>
<p>Yeah, so just two points.</p>
<p>One is it may be that there&rsquo;s infectee zero</p>
<p>and patient zero.</p>
<p>It could be that the first person infected was asymptomatic</p>
<p>because we know there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who are asymptomatic.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the question of, well, who is patient zero?</p>
<p>Meaning the first person to present themselves</p>
<p>in some kind of health facility</p>
<p>where that diagnosis could be made.</p>
<p>So can we actually linger on that definition?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So is that to you a good definition of patient zero?</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff here</p>
<p>because this virus is weird.</p>
<p>So one is who gets infected, one who is infectious</p>
<p>or the first person infect others.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And who shows up to a hospital.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m calling the first person</p>
<p>to show up to a hospital who&rsquo;s diagnosed with COVID 19.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling that person patient zero.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also, there&rsquo;s somewhere the first person</p>
<p>to be infected.</p>
<p>And that person maybe never showed up in a hospital</p>
<p>because maybe they were asymptomatic and never get sick,</p>
<p>so got sick.</p>
<p>So let me start with what I&rsquo;m calling infectee zero.</p>
<p>Here are some options.</p>
<p>I talked before about some person who was a villager</p>
<p>and some remote village.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible to imagine, but possible to imagine</p>
<p>because strange things happen.</p>
<p>And that person somehow gets to Wuhan.</p>
<p>By the way, just to still make that argument,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not an argument, it&rsquo;s a statement,</p>
<p>but strange things happen all the time.</p>
<p>No, I agree.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that logic doesn&rsquo;t apply</p>
<p>and probabilities don&rsquo;t apply, but we all,</p>
<p>I mean, in general principle, everyone, if we were honest,</p>
<p>should be agnostic about everything.</p>
<p>Like I think I&rsquo;m Jamie, but is there a 0.01% chance</p>
<p>or 0.001% chance that I&rsquo;m not?</p>
<p>But it could be.</p>
<p>I mean, how would I know?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a large number of people arguing</p>
<p>about the meaning of the word I</p>
<p>and that I&rsquo;m Jamie.</p>
<p>So exactly.</p>
<p>What is consciousness?</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So we could spend another three hours going into that one.</p>
<p>So one possibility is there&rsquo;s some remote villager.</p>
<p>Another possibility is there&rsquo;s somehow bizarrely,</p>
<p>there are these infected animals</p>
<p>that come from Southern China most likely.</p>
<p>They all, maybe there&rsquo;s only one of them that&rsquo;s infected,</p>
<p>which how could that possibly be?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only sent to Wuhan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not sent anywhere else,</p>
<p>to any of the markets there or whatever.</p>
<p>And then maybe somebody in a market is infected.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one remote possibility, but a possibility.</p>
<p>Another is that researchers</p>
<p>from the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>go down to Southern China.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t, we haven&rsquo;t talked about it yet,</p>
<p>but in 2012, there were six miners were sent</p>
<p>into a copper mine in Southern China and Yunnan province.</p>
<p>All of them got very sick</p>
<p>with what now appear like COVID 19 like symptoms.</p>
<p>Half of them died.</p>
<p>Blood samples from them were taken</p>
<p>to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And then after that, there were multiple site visits</p>
<p>to that mine, collecting viral samples</p>
<p>that were brought to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,</p>
<p>included among those samples were,</p>
<p>was this now infamous RETG 13 virus,</p>
<p>which is among the genetically closest viruses</p>
<p>to SARS CoV2.</p>
<p>There were other nine other or eight other viruses</p>
<p>that were collected from that mine</p>
<p>that were presumably very similar to that.</p>
<p>And again, we have no access to the information</p>
<p>about those and many of the other,</p>
<p>most, almost all of the other viruses.</p>
<p>So could it be that one of the people</p>
<p>who was sent from the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>or the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control,</p>
<p>they went down there to collect</p>
<p>and they got infected asymptomatically and brought it back?</p>
<p>Could it be that they were working on these viruses</p>
<p>in the laboratory and there was an issue</p>
<p>with waste disposal?</p>
<p>And we know that the Wuhan CDC had a major problem</p>
<p>with waste disposal.</p>
<p>And just before the pandemic,</p>
<p>one, they put out an RFP to fix their waste disposal.</p>
<p>And in early 2019, they moved to their new site,</p>
<p>which was basically across the street</p>
<p>from the Huanan Seafood Market.</p>
<p>So could there have been issue of somebody infected</p>
<p>in the lab of waste disposal?</p>
<p>Could a laboratory animal, their experiences</p>
<p>in China, actually China just recently passed a law</p>
<p>saying it&rsquo;s illegal to sell laboratory animals</p>
<p>in the market because there were scientists,</p>
<p>or one scientist who was selling laboratory animals</p>
<p>in the market and people would just come and buy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s so many, there are so many scenarios,</p>
<p>but if I, again, connect it to my 85% number,</p>
<p>I think in the whole category of laboratory related incidents,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s collection, waste,</p>
<p>something connected to the lab,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the most likely,</p>
<p>but there are other credible people</p>
<p>who would say they think it&rsquo;s not the most likely</p>
<p>and I welcome their views</p>
<p>and we need to have this conversation.</p>
<p>So in your write up, but what&rsquo;s the URL?</p>
<p>Because I always find it by doing Jamie Metzl lab leak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the easiest, just Google that.</p>
<p>No, no, but if you just go to jamiemetzl.com,</p>
<p>J A M I E M E T Z L dot com,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re just a thing, it&rsquo;s COVID origins.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s COVID origins.</p>
<p>Or you could just Google Jamie Metzl lab leak.</p>
<p>Google search engine is such a powerful thing.</p>
<p>You mentioned in that write up that you don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>this could be just me misreading it</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just slightly miswritten,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t think that the virus</p>
<p>is from that 2012 mind, which is fascinating,</p>
<p>could be the backbone for SARS COVID too.</p>
<p>So what I mean, just the specific virus,</p>
<p>which I mentioned, RATG13,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a whole history of that</p>
<p>because it had a different name and it looked,</p>
<p>and Xiaojiang Li provided wrong information</p>
<p>about when it had been sequenced.</p>
<p>I mean, there was a whole issue connected to that.</p>
<p>But the genetic difference,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s 96.2% similar to the SARS COVID2 virus,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually a significant difference,</p>
<p>even though that and a virus called Banal 52</p>
<p>that was collected in Laos are the two most similar,</p>
<p>there still are differences.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying RATG13 is the backbone,</p>
<p>but is there, I believe there is a possibility</p>
<p>that other viruses that were collected</p>
<p>either in that mine in Yunnan in Southern China</p>
<p>or in Laos or Cambodia,</p>
<p>because that was with the EcoHealth Alliance</p>
<p>proposals and documents.</p>
<p>Their plan was to collect viruses</p>
<p>in Laos and Cambodia and elsewhere</p>
<p>and bring them to the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>so that there are people.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, just when I was sitting here</p>
<p>before this interview,</p>
<p>I got a message from somebody who was saying,</p>
<p>well, Peter Daszak is telling everybody</p>
<p>that the viral sample, the Banal 52 from Laos</p>
<p>proves that there&rsquo;s not a lab incident origin</p>
<p>of the pandemic.</p>
<p>And it actually doesn&rsquo;t prove that at all</p>
<p>because these viruses were being collected</p>
<p>in places like Laos and Cambodia</p>
<p>and being brought to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>Those are like early, early, like the prequel.</p>
<p>So these are, they&rsquo;re not sufficiently similar</p>
<p>to be a, to serve as a backbone,</p>
<p>but they kind of tell a story</p>
<p>that they could have been brought to the lab</p>
<p>through several processes, including genetic modification</p>
<p>or through the natural evolution processes,</p>
<p>accelerated evolution, they could have arrived</p>
<p>to something that has the spike protein</p>
<p>and the cleavage, the foreign cleavage site</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is the essential point</p>
<p>is if we had access, if we knew everything</p>
<p>that was being, every virus that was being held</p>
<p>at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Wuhan CDC,</p>
<p>we had full access.</p>
<p>We had full access to everybody&rsquo;s lab notes.</p>
<p>And we did just the kind of forensic investigation</p>
<p>that has been so desperately required since day one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be able to say, well, what did you have?</p>
<p>Because if we knew, if it should come out,</p>
<p>that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had in its repository,</p>
<p>prior to the outbreak, either SARS CoV2</p>
<p>or a reasonable precursor to it,</p>
<p>that would prove the lab incident hypothesis.</p>
<p>In my mind, that&rsquo;s almost certainly why they are preventing</p>
<p>any kind of meaningful investigation.</p>
<p>So my hypothesis is not that what RITG13 says</p>
<p>is because as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the genetics of virus are constantly recombinating.</p>
<p>So that what that means is if you have,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have very many total outlier viruses</p>
<p>in a bat community because these viruses</p>
<p>are always mixing and matching with each other.</p>
<p>And so if you have RITG13, which is relatively similar</p>
<p>to SARS CoV2, there&rsquo;s a pretty decent likelihood</p>
<p>there was other stuff that was collected</p>
<p>at this mine called Mojang Mine in Yunnan Province,</p>
<p>maybe in Laos and Cambodia.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we need to have that information.</p>
<p>Do you think somebody knows who patient zero is</p>
<p>within China?</p>
<p>So do you think that is?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s two things.</p>
<p>One is I think somebody and people probably know.</p>
<p>And then two, it&rsquo;s been incredibly curious</p>
<p>that the best virus chasers in the world are in China.</p>
<p>And they are in Wuhan.</p>
<p>And when we can talk about this deeply compromised,</p>
<p>now vastly improved World Health Organization process.</p>
<p>But when they went there, the Chinese,</p>
<p>the local and national Chinese authorities say,</p>
<p>oh, we haven&rsquo;t done, we haven&rsquo;t tested the samples</p>
<p>in our blood center.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t done any of this tracing.</p>
<p>And these deeply compromised people</p>
<p>who were part of the international part</p>
<p>of the joint study tour, when they came out with their,</p>
<p>they had their visit earlier this year</p>
<p>and came out with their report.</p>
<p>They had in my mind, just an absurd letter</p>
<p>to the editor in nature saying,</p>
<p>well, if we don&rsquo;t hurry back,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna know what happened.</p>
<p>Assuming that the people in China are like bumpkins</p>
<p>who on their own don&rsquo;t know how to trace the origin</p>
<p>of a virus and the opposite is the case.</p>
<p>So I think there are people in China</p>
<p>who at least know a lot.</p>
<p>They know a lot more than they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And at the best case scenario is the Chinese government</p>
<p>wants to prevent any investigation, including by them.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is that there are people</p>
<p>who already know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, again, my point from day one has been,</p>
<p>we need a comprehensive international investigation</p>
<p>in Wuhan with full access to all relevant records,</p>
<p>samples and personnel.</p>
<p>When this, again, deeply flawed.</p>
<p>Can I give you a little history of this WHO process?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Who are the, that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s on first?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so funny with the jokes.</p>
<p>Look at me go.</p>
<p>Who are the WHO?</p>
<p>So what is this organization?</p>
<p>What is its purpose?</p>
<p>What role did it play in the pandemic?</p>
<p>It certainly was demonized in the realm of politics.</p>
<p>This is an institution that was supposed to save us</p>
<p>from this pandemic.</p>
<p>A lot of people believe it failed.</p>
<p>Has it failed?</p>
<p>Why did it fail?</p>
<p>And you said it&rsquo;s improving.</p>
<p>How is it improving?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I hope you don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to talk for a little bit of extra time.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>Good, good, good, good.</p>
<p>So the WHO is an absolutely essential organization</p>
<p>created in 1948 in that wonderful period</p>
<p>after the Second World War</p>
<p>when the United States and allied countries</p>
<p>asked the big bold questions,</p>
<p>how do we build a safer world for everyone?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the WHO.</p>
<p>If we, although there are many critics of the WHO,</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t have it, we would need to invent it</p>
<p>because the whole nature of these big public health issues</p>
<p>and certainly for pandemics, but all sorts of things</p>
<p>is that they are transnational in nature.</p>
<p>And so we cannot just build moats.</p>
<p>We cannot build walls.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all connected to it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a political process because the United Nations</p>
<p>and the WHO is part of it,</p>
<p>it exists within a political context.</p>
<p>And so the current director general</p>
<p>of the World Health Organization</p>
<p>who was just reelected for his second five year term</p>
<p>is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</p>
<p>who is from Ethiopia, Tigrayan from Ethiopia.</p>
<p>And in full disclosure, I have a lot of respect for Tedros.</p>
<p>Tedros got his job.</p>
<p>He was not America&rsquo;s candidate.</p>
<p>He was not Britain&rsquo;s candidate.</p>
<p>Our candidate was a guy named David Nabarro</p>
<p>who I also know and have tremendous respect for.</p>
<p>China led the process of putting Tedros in this position.</p>
<p>And in the earliest days of the pandemic,</p>
<p>Tedros, in my view,</p>
<p>even though I have tremendous respect for him,</p>
<p>I think he made a mistake.</p>
<p>The WHO doesn&rsquo;t have its own</p>
<p>independent surveillance network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not organized to have it</p>
<p>and the states have not allowed it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s dependent on member states</p>
<p>for providing it information.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s a poorly funded organization</p>
<p>dependent on its bosses who are these governments,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s natural instinct isn&rsquo;t to condemn its bosses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to say, well, let&rsquo;s quietly work with everybody.</p>
<p>Having said that,</p>
<p>the Chinese government knowingly lied to Tedros.</p>
<p>And Tedros, in repeating the position</p>
<p>of the Chinese government,</p>
<p>which incidentally I&rsquo;ll say Donald Trump</p>
<p>also did the exact same thing.</p>
<p>Donald Trump had a private conversation with Xi Jinping</p>
<p>and then repeated what Xi had told him.</p>
<p>Both of them were wrong.</p>
<p>Dr. Tedros, I think when Chinese government was lying,</p>
<p>knowingly lying,</p>
<p>saying there&rsquo;s no human to human transmission,</p>
<p>Dr. Tedros said that.</p>
<p>And even though within the World Health Organization,</p>
<p>there were private critiques saying</p>
<p>China is now doing exactly what it did in SARS one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not providing access,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not providing information.</p>
<p>Tedros&rsquo;s instinct because of his background,</p>
<p>because of his role and wrongly,</p>
<p>was to have a more collaborative relationship with China,</p>
<p>particularly by making assertions</p>
<p>based on the information that was wrong.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t call people liars,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna be happy with you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna be happy.</p>
<p>And the job of the WHO isn&rsquo;t to condemn states,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to do the best possible job of addressing problems.</p>
<p>And I think that the culture was,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s do the most that we can.</p>
<p>If we totally alienate China on day one,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in even worse shape than if we call them out for.</p>
<p>Not exactly sure, by the way,</p>
<p>that maybe you can also steel man that argument.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not completely obvious that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a terrible decision.</p>
<p>Like if you and I were in that role,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t make that decision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated because like,</p>
<p>you want China on your side to help solve this.</p>
<p>So I would have made a different decision,</p>
<p>which is why I never would have been selected</p>
<p>as the director general.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a selection criteria</p>
<p>that everybody kind of needs to support you.</p>
<p>And so, but let me just, this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Can you also just elaborate or kind of restate,</p>
<p>what were the inaccuracies that you quickly mentioned?</p>
<p>So human to human transmission, what were the things?</p>
<p>So the most important, there were a few things.</p>
<p>One, China didn&rsquo;t report the outbreak.</p>
<p>Two, they had the sequenced genome</p>
<p>of the SARS CoV2 virus,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t share it for two critical weeks.</p>
<p>And when they did share it, it was inadvertent.</p>
<p>I mean, there was a very, very courageous scientist</p>
<p>who essentially leaked it and was later punished</p>
<p>for leaking it, even though the Chinese government</p>
<p>is now saying we were so great by releasing the sequenced.</p>
<p>Wait, I was really confused.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m so clueless about this as most things.</p>
<p>Because I thought, because there was a celebration of,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t this amazing that we got the sequence,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing, and then the scientific community</p>
<p>across the world stepped up and were able to do</p>
<p>a lot of stuff really quickly with that sharing.</p>
<p>Because I thought the Chinese government shared it.</p>
<p>No, no, so they sat on it for two weeks.</p>
<p>When they shared it against their will, it was incredible.</p>
<p>Moderna, 48 hours later after getting the information,</p>
<p>getting the sequenced genome, they had the formulation</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s now the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s two critical weeks.</p>
<p>In those early days, they blocked the World Health</p>
<p>Organization from sending its experts to Wuhan</p>
<p>for more than three weeks.</p>
<p>I said they lied about human to human transmission.</p>
<p>During that time, they were aggressively enacting</p>
<p>their coverup, destroying records, hiding samples,</p>
<p>imprisoning people who were asking tough questions.</p>
<p>They soon after established their gag order.</p>
<p>They fought internally in the World Health Organization</p>
<p>to prevent the declaration of a global emergency.</p>
<p>So China definitely, I mean, I couldn&rsquo;t be stronger</p>
<p>in my critique of China, particularly what it did</p>
<p>in those early days, but it really, what it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>even to today is outrageous.</p>
<p>So that was, so then there was the question of,</p>
<p>well, how do we examine what actually happened?</p>
<p>And the Prime Minister of Australia then and now,</p>
<p>Scott Morrison, was incredibly courageous.</p>
<p>And he said, we need a full investigation.</p>
<p>And because of that, the Chinese government</p>
<p>attacked him personally and imposed trade sanctions</p>
<p>on Australia to try to, not just to punish Australia,</p>
<p>but to deliver a message to every other country.</p>
<p>If you ask questions, we&rsquo;re going to punish you ruthlessly.</p>
<p>And then that certainly was the message that was delivered.</p>
<p>The Australians brought that idea of a full investigation</p>
<p>to the World Health Assembly in May of 2020.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, the WHA is the governing authority</p>
<p>above, of states above the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>And so, but instead of passing a resolution calling</p>
<p>for a full investigation, what ended up ironically</p>
<p>and tragically passing with Chinese support</p>
<p>was a mandate to have essentially</p>
<p>a Chinese controlled joint study,</p>
<p>where half of the team, a little more than half of the team</p>
<p>was Chinese experts, government affiliated Chinese experts,</p>
<p>and half were independent international experts</p>
<p>but organized by the WHO.</p>
<p>And then it took six months</p>
<p>to negotiate the terms of reference.</p>
<p>And again, while China was doing all this coverup,</p>
<p>they delayed and delayed and delayed.</p>
<p>And by the terms of reference that were negotiated,</p>
<p>China had veto power over who got to be a member</p>
<p>of the international group.</p>
<p>And that group was not entitled to access to raw data.</p>
<p>The Chinese side would give them conclusions</p>
<p>based on their own analysis of the raw data,</p>
<p>which was totally outrageous.</p>
<p>So then, and I was a big, I and others,</p>
<p>now friend of mine, although we&rsquo;ve never met in person,</p>
<p>Gilles de Manouf in New Zealand,</p>
<p>he did a great job of chronicling just the letter by letter</p>
<p>of the terms of reference.</p>
<p>So then it took, now it&rsquo;s the January of this year,</p>
<p>January, 2021, this deeply flawed,</p>
<p>deeply compromised international group is sent to Wuhan.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the connection between this group</p>
<p>and the joint study?</p>
<p>So the joint study, it had the Chinese side</p>
<p>and the international side.</p>
<p>So these international experts,</p>
<p>then part of their examination was going</p>
<p>for one month to Wuhan.</p>
<p>And the nature of the flaws of this international group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay, really important point.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sorry, I wasn&rsquo;t clear on that.</p>
<p>Rather, the mandate of what they were doing</p>
<p>was not to investigate the origins of the pandemic.</p>
<p>It was to have a joint study</p>
<p>into the zoonotic origins of the virus,</p>
<p>which means, which was interpreted to mean</p>
<p>the natural origins hypothesis.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t empowered for a single hypothesis,</p>
<p>not so that they weren&rsquo;t empowered</p>
<p>to examine the lab incident origin.</p>
<p>They were there to look at the natural origin hypothesis.</p>
<p>To shop for some meat at some markets.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that was, so then they were there for a month.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So out of the makeup of the team, guess who was?</p>
<p>So the United States government proposed three experts</p>
<p>for this team.</p>
<p>People who had a lot of background.</p>
<p>This was the Trump administration.</p>
<p>People who had a lot of background,</p>
<p>including in investigating lab incidents.</p>
<p>None of those people were accepted.</p>
<p>The one American who was accepted.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s Peter Daszak.</p>
<p>Peter Daszak.</p>
<p>Peter Daszak, who had this funding relationship</p>
<p>for many years with the Wuhan Institute of Virology,</p>
<p>whose entire basically professional reputation</p>
<p>was based on his collaboration with Shujang Li,</p>
<p>who had written the February, 2020 Lancet letter</p>
<p>saying it comes from natural origin.</p>
<p>And anybody who&rsquo;s suggesting otherwise</p>
<p>is a conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>And who, at least according to me,</p>
<p>had been at very, very least the opposite of transparent</p>
<p>and at most engaged in a massive disinformation campaign.</p>
<p>He is the one American who&rsquo;s on this.</p>
<p>So they go there, they have one month in Wuhan.</p>
<p>Two weeks of it are spent in quarantine</p>
<p>just in their hotel rooms.</p>
<p>So then they have two weeks,</p>
<p>but really it&rsquo;s just 10 working days.</p>
<p>One of the earliest, and so then they&rsquo;re kind of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all seen the pictures.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re traveling around Wuhan in little buses.</p>
<p>One of the first visits they have</p>
<p>is to this museum exhibition on the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically a propaganda exhibition on the success,</p>
<p>Xi Jinping and the success in fighting COVID.</p>
<p>And they said, well, we had to show respect</p>
<p>to our Chinese hosts.</p>
<p>But I think what the Chinese hosts were saying is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;m just gonna rub your noses in this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna go where we tell you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna hear what we want you to hear.</p>
<p>So they have that little short time.</p>
<p>They spend a few hours.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t in control of where the bus goes.</p>
<p>No, I mean, they made recommendations.</p>
<p>Many of their recommendations were accepted,</p>
<p>but like when they went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology</p>
<p>and some of them did,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t able to do any kind of audit</p>
<p>when they asked for access to raw data.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t provided that.</p>
<p>They were, it was, as I said in my 60 minutes interview,</p>
<p>it was a chaperoned study tour.</p>
<p>It was not even remotely close to an investigation.</p>
<p>And the thing they were looking at</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t the origins of the pandemic.</p>
<p>It was the single hypothesis</p>
<p>of a quote unquote natural origins.</p>
<p>Then, I mean, it was really so shocking for me.</p>
<p>On February 9 of this year in Wuhan,</p>
<p>the Chinese government sets up a joint press event</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s the Chinese side and the international side.</p>
<p>And during that press event,</p>
<p>a guy named Peter Ben Embarek,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a little confusing.</p>
<p>He was basically the head of this delegation</p>
<p>and he works for the WHO,</p>
<p>even though this was an independent committee,</p>
<p>it was organized by the WHO.</p>
<p>So Peter Ben Embarek gets up there and says,</p>
<p>we think it&rsquo;s most likely it comes from nature.</p>
<p>Then he says, we think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>it comes through frozen food,</p>
<p>which is absolutely outrageous.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s basically preposterous.</p>
<p>Alena Chan calls this popsicle origins,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really, really unlikely.</p>
<p>But then most significantly,</p>
<p>he says that we&rsquo;ve all agreed</p>
<p>that a lab incident origin is quote unquote</p>
<p>extremely unlikely and shouldn&rsquo;t be investigated.</p>
<p>We later learned that the way they came up</p>
<p>with that determination was by a show of hands vote</p>
<p>of the international experts and the Chinese experts.</p>
<p>And the Chinese experts had to do their vote</p>
<p>in front of the Chinese government officials</p>
<p>who were constantly there.</p>
<p>So even if whatever they thought,</p>
<p>there was no possibility that someone raises their hand</p>
<p>and say, oh yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a lab origin.</p>
<p>So that was outrageous thing number one.</p>
<p>Outrageous thing number two,</p>
<p>which I mean, I&rsquo;ll come back to my response in February.</p>
<p>Outrageous thing number two is months later,</p>
<p>Peter Benambarak does an interview on Danish television.</p>
<p>And he says, actually I was lying about extremely unlikely</p>
<p>because the Chinese side,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want any mention of a lab incident origin</p>
<p>anywhere including in the report that later came out.</p>
<p>And so the deal we made, even though he himself thought</p>
<p>that at least some manifestation of a lab incident origin</p>
<p>was likely and that there should be an investigation,</p>
<p>particularly he said, well, that&rsquo;s kind of weird</p>
<p>that the Wuhan CDC moved just across</p>
<p>from the Huanan seafood market</p>
<p>just before the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But he said as a horse trading deal</p>
<p>with the Chinese authorities,</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t be that he agreed to say</p>
<p>it was extremely unlikely and shouldn&rsquo;t be investigated.</p>
<p>So I was in actually in Colorado staying with my parents</p>
<p>and I stayed up late watching this press event.</p>
<p>And I was appalled because I knew after two weeks</p>
<p>there was no way they could possibly come to that conclusion.</p>
<p>So I immediately sent a private message to Tedros,</p>
<p>the WHO director general, essentially saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way they had enough access</p>
<p>to come to this conclusion.</p>
<p>If the WHO doesn&rsquo;t distance itself from this,</p>
<p>the WHO itself is going to be in danger</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to be basically institutional capture</p>
<p>by the Chinese.</p>
<p>This was repeating the Chinese government&rsquo;s</p>
<p>propaganda points.</p>
<p>And Tedros sent me a really, again,</p>
<p>why I have so much respect for Tedros,</p>
<p>sent me a private note saying,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry, we are determined to do the right thing.</p>
<p>And so I got that private message.</p>
<p>And again, I really like Tedros,</p>
<p>but I thought, well, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>Three days later, Tedros makes a public statement.</p>
<p>And he says, I&rsquo;ve heard this thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that this is a final answer.</p>
<p>We need to have a full investigation into this process.</p>
<p>He then released two more statements</p>
<p>saying we need to have a full investigation</p>
<p>with access to raw data.</p>
<p>And we need a full audit of the Wuhan labs.</p>
<p>So then that part was really, really great.</p>
<p>But then this saga continues because,</p>
<p>so I was part of a group, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>this Paris group.</p>
<p>It was about two dozen or so experts.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d been meeting since 2020 and having regular meetings.</p>
<p>And we just present papers, present data,</p>
<p>debate to try to really get to the bottom of things.</p>
<p>And it was all private.</p>
<p>So I went to this group and I said, look,</p>
<p>this playing field is now skewed.</p>
<p>These guys, they&rsquo;ve put out this thing,</p>
<p>lab incident origin, extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in every newspaper in the world.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just be our own little private group</p>
<p>talking to each other.</p>
<p>So I led the political process of drafting</p>
<p>what became four open letters that many of us signed,</p>
<p>most of us signed, that saying, all right,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s why this study group and the report are not credible.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what a full investigation would look like.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a treasure map of all the resources</p>
<p>where people can look.</p>
<p>And we demand a comprehensive investigation.</p>
<p>So those four open letters were in pretty much</p>
<p>every newspaper in the world.</p>
<p>And it played a really significant role</p>
<p>along with some other things.</p>
<p>There was later, there was a letter, a short letter</p>
<p>in Science making basically similar points</p>
<p>in a much more condensed way.</p>
<p>There were some higher profile articles</p>
<p>by Nicholas Wade and Nick Baker and others.</p>
<p>And those collectively shifted the conversation.</p>
<p>And then really impressively, the WHO,</p>
<p>and with Tedros&rsquo;s leadership, did</p>
<p>something that was really incredible.</p>
<p>And that is earlier this year, they,</p>
<p>meaning the leadership of the WHO, not the World Health</p>
<p>Assembly, but the leadership of the WHO,</p>
<p>announced the establishment of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called SAGO, the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins</p>
<p>of Novel Pathogens.</p>
<p>And basically what they did was overrule their own governing</p>
<p>board and say, we&rsquo;re going to create our own entity.</p>
<p>So it basically dissolved that international, deeply flawed</p>
<p>international joint study group.</p>
<p>And a lot of those people, they have become very critical,</p>
<p>like the Chinese of Tedros.</p>
<p>So then they had an open call for nominations</p>
<p>to be part of SAGO.</p>
<p>And so a lot of people put in their nominations.</p>
<p>They selected 26 people.</p>
<p>But our group, we had a meeting, and we</p>
<p>were unhappy with that list of 26.</p>
<p>It still felt skewed toward the natural origin hypothesis.</p>
<p>So again, I drafted, and we worked on together,</p>
<p>an open letter which we submitted to the WHO saying,</p>
<p>we think this list, it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not good enough.</p>
<p>And we call on these three people to be removed,</p>
<p>and we have these three people who we think should be added.</p>
<p>Incredibly, and I was in private touch</p>
<p>with the WHO, after announcing the 26 people,</p>
<p>the WHO said, we&rsquo;re reopening the process, so send in more.</p>
<p>And so then they added two more people, one of whom</p>
<p>is an expert in the auditing of lab incidents.</p>
<p>And then one of the, so they added those two.</p>
<p>And then when they just released the list of people</p>
<p>who are part of SAGO, this one woman,</p>
<p>a highly respected Dutch virologist named Marion Koopmans,</p>
<p>who had been part of that deeply flawed and compromised</p>
<p>international study group, who had called,</p>
<p>who has consistently called a lab incident origin, quote,</p>
<p>unquote, a debunked conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>As of now, her name is not on the list.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t seen any announcements.</p>
<p>So I summary, and I&rsquo;m sorry to go on for so long</p>
<p>and to be so animated about this,</p>
<p>I genuinely feel that the WHO is trying to do the right thing.</p>
<p>But they exist within a political context.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re pushing at the edges,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s only so far that they can go.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we definitely need</p>
<p>to have full accountability for the WHO.</p>
<p>We need to expand the mandate to WHO.</p>
<p>But we need to recognize that states have a big role.</p>
<p>And China is an incredibly influential state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing everything possible to prevent</p>
<p>the kind of full investigation into pandemic origins</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so desperately required.</p>
<p>Well, it sounds like the leadership</p>
<p>made all the difference in the WHO.</p>
<p>So like the way to change the momentum of large institutions</p>
<p>is through the leadership.</p>
<p>Leadership and empowerment, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>the World Health Assembly is meeting now.</p>
<p>And I think that it shouldn&rsquo;t be that we require superhumans.</p>
<p>And there are some people who are big critics of WHO.</p>
<p>The leader of the WHO in SARS 1 was definitely more aggressive.</p>
<p>She had a different set of powers at that time.</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t be entirely, we definitely</p>
<p>need strong willed, aggressive, independent people</p>
<p>in these kinds of roles.</p>
<p>We also need a more empowered WHO.</p>
<p>Like when the Chinese government in the earliest days</p>
<p>of the pandemic said, we&rsquo;re just not</p>
<p>going to allow you to send a team to collect</p>
<p>your own information.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not going to allow you to have</p>
<p>any kind of independent surveillance,</p>
<p>there was very little that the WHO could do because</p>
<p>of the limitations of its mandate.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t just say we&rsquo;re going to have a WHO that only</p>
<p>compromises Chinese sovereignty.</p>
<p>If we want to have a powerful WHO,</p>
<p>we should say we have emergency teams when the director</p>
<p>general says an emergency team needs to go somewhere.</p>
<p>If they aren&rsquo;t allowed to go there that day,</p>
<p>you could say there&rsquo;s an immediate referral</p>
<p>to the Security Council.</p>
<p>There needs to be something.</p>
<p>But we have all these demands, rightfully,</p>
<p>so of the WHO, which doesn&rsquo;t have the authorities.</p>
<p>The WHO itself only controls 20% of its own budget.</p>
<p>So the governments are saying, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to give you money to do this or that.</p>
<p>So we need a stronger WHO to protect us,</p>
<p>but we also have to build that.</p>
<p>So looking a little bit into the future,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s first step into the past, sort</p>
<p>of the philosophical question about China.</p>
<p>If you were to put yourself in the shoes of the Chinese</p>
<p>government, if they were to be more transparent,</p>
<p>how should they be more transparent?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s easier to say, we want to see this.</p>
<p>But from a perspective of government,</p>
<p>and not just the Chinese government,</p>
<p>but a government on WHO&rsquo;s geographic territory,</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s a lab leak, a lab leak occurred</p>
<p>that has resulted in trillions of dollars of loss,</p>
<p>countless of lives, just all kinds of damage to the world.</p>
<p>If they were to admit or show data</p>
<p>that could serve as evidence for a lab leak,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that people could, in the worst case,</p>
<p>start wars over, or in the most likely case,</p>
<p>just constantly bring that up at every turn,</p>
<p>making you powerless in negotiations.</p>
<p>Whenever you want to do something</p>
<p>in geopolitical sense, the United States</p>
<p>will bring up, oh, remember that time</p>
<p>you cost us trillions of dollars because of your fuck up?</p>
<p>So what is the incentive for the Chinese government</p>
<p>to be transparent?</p>
<p>And if it is to be transparent, how should it do it?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of people.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m talking to you, as opposed</p>
<p>to a bunch of other folks, because you</p>
<p>are kindhearted and thoughtful and open minded</p>
<p>and really respected.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of people that are talking about lab leak</p>
<p>that are a little bit less interested in building</p>
<p>a better world and more interested in pointing out</p>
<p>the emperor has no clothes.</p>
<p>They want step one, which is saying, basically,</p>
<p>tearing down the bullshitters.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to do the further steps of building.</p>
<p>And so as the Chinese government,</p>
<p>I would be nervous about being transparent with anybody that</p>
<p>just wants to tear our power centers, our power</p>
<p>structures down.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s a long way to ask,</p>
<p>how should the Chinese government be transparent now</p>
<p>and in the future?</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;ll break that down into a few sub questions.</p>
<p>The first is, what should, in an ideal world,</p>
<p>what should the Chinese government do?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>They should be totally transparent.</p>
<p>The South African government now,</p>
<p>there is an outbreak of this Omicron variant.</p>
<p>And the South African government has done what we would want.</p>
<p>A government to do is say, hey, there&rsquo;s an outbreak.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have all of the information.</p>
<p>We need help.</p>
<p>We want to alert the world.</p>
<p>And in some ways, they&rsquo;re being punished for it</p>
<p>through these travel bans.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a separate topic.</p>
<p>But I actually think short term travel bans actually</p>
<p>are not a terrible idea.</p>
<p>They should have, on day one, they</p>
<p>should have allowed WHO experts in.</p>
<p>They should have shared information.</p>
<p>They should have allowed a full and comprehensive</p>
<p>investigation with international partnerships</p>
<p>to understand what went wrong.</p>
<p>They should have shared their raw data.</p>
<p>They should have allowed their scientists</p>
<p>to speak and write publicly.</p>
<p>Because nobody knows more about this stuff,</p>
<p>certainly in the early days, than their scientists do.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s relatively easy to say what they should do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard question to say, well, what would happen?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say tomorrow, we prove for certain</p>
<p>that this pandemic stems both from an accidental lab</p>
<p>incident and then from what I&rsquo;ve consistently</p>
<p>called a criminal cover up.</p>
<p>Because the cover up has done, in many ways,</p>
<p>as much or more damage than the incident.</p>
<p>Well, what happens?</p>
<p>You could easily imagine Xi Jinping has had two terms</p>
<p>as the leader of China.</p>
<p>And he can now have unlimited terms.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve changed the rules for that.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s got a lot of enemies.</p>
<p>I mean, there are a lot of people who are waiting in line</p>
<p>to step up.</p>
<p>So is there a chance that Xi Jinping could be deposed</p>
<p>if it was proven that this comes from a lab?</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a real possibility.</p>
<p>Would people in the United States Congress, for example,</p>
<p>demand reparations from China?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve had $4.5 trillion of stimulus,</p>
<p>all of the economic losses, and we owe a lot of money</p>
<p>to China from our debt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite certain that members of Congress</p>
<p>would say, we&rsquo;re just going to wipe that out.</p>
<p>It would destroy the global financial system,</p>
<p>but I think they would be extremely likely.</p>
<p>Would other countries, like India,</p>
<p>that have lost millions of people</p>
<p>and had terrible economic damages,</p>
<p>would they demand reparations?</p>
<p>So I think from a Chinese perspective,</p>
<p>starting from now, it would have</p>
<p>major geopolitical implications.</p>
<p>And go back to Chernobyl, there was</p>
<p>a reason why the Soviet Union went to such length</p>
<p>to cover things up.</p>
<p>And when it came out, I mean, there are different theories,</p>
<p>but certainly Chernobyl played some role</p>
<p>in the end of communist power in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So the Chinese are very, very aware of that.</p>
<p>But the difference, of course, with Chernobyl,</p>
<p>the damage to the rest of the world</p>
<p>was not nearly as significant as it was with COVID.</p>
<p>So you say that the coverup is a crime,</p>
<p>but everything you just described,</p>
<p>the response of the rest of the world,</p>
<p>is, I could say, unfair.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not&hellip;</p>
<p>So, okay, if we say the best possible version of the story,</p>
<p>you know, lab leaks happen, they shouldn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>but they happen.</p>
<p>And how is that on the Chinese government?</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s a good example?</p>
<p>Well, the Union Carbide.</p>
<p>Union Carbide, there was this American company</p>
<p>operating in India, they had this leak,</p>
<p>all these people were killed.</p>
<p>The company admitted responsibility.</p>
<p>I was working in the White House</p>
<p>when the United States government, in my view,</p>
<p>which I know to be the case,</p>
<p>but other people in China think differently,</p>
<p>bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.</p>
<p>And so the United States government</p>
<p>allowed a full investigation,</p>
<p>then we paid reparations to the families.</p>
<p>And so to your question, if I were,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say I were the Chinese government,</p>
<p>not, I mean, kind of an idealized version</p>
<p>of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just say that they had come to the conclusion</p>
<p>that it was a lab incident.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just say they knew that even if</p>
<p>they continued to cover it up,</p>
<p>eventually this information would come out.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe there was a whistleblower,</p>
<p>maybe they knew of some evidence</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t know about or something.</p>
<p>What would I do starting right now?</p>
<p>What I would do is I would hold a press conference</p>
<p>and I would say, we had this terrible accident.</p>
<p>The reason why we were doing this research</p>
<p>in Wuhan and elsewhere is that we had SARS one</p>
<p>and we felt a responsibility to do everything possible</p>
<p>to prevent that kind of terrible thing happening again</p>
<p>for our country and for the world.</p>
<p>That was why we collaborated with France,</p>
<p>with the United States in building up those capacities.</p>
<p>We know that nothing is perfect,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re a sovereign country and we have our own system.</p>
<p>And so we had to adapt our systems</p>
<p>so that they made sense internally.</p>
<p>When this outbreak began, we didn&rsquo;t know how it started.</p>
<p>And that was why we wanted to look into things.</p>
<p>When the process of investigating became so political,</p>
<p>it gave us pause and we were worried that our enemies</p>
<p>were trying to use this investigation</p>
<p>in order to undermine us.</p>
<p>Having said that, now that we&rsquo;ve dug deeper,</p>
<p>we have recognized because we have access</p>
<p>to additional information that we didn&rsquo;t have then,</p>
<p>that this pandemic started from an accidental lab incident.</p>
<p>And we feel really terribly about that.</p>
<p>And we know that we were very aggressive</p>
<p>in covering up information in the beginning,</p>
<p>but the reason we were doing that is because we thoroughly,</p>
<p>we fully believe that it came from a natural origin.</p>
<p>Now that we see otherwise, we feel terribly.</p>
<p>Therefore, we&rsquo;re doing a few different things.</p>
<p>One is we are committing ourselves</p>
<p>to establishing a stronger WHO, a new pandemic treaty</p>
<p>that addresses the major challenges that we face</p>
<p>and allows the World Health Organization</p>
<p>to pierce the veil of absolute sovereignty</p>
<p>because we know that when these pandemics happen,</p>
<p>they affect everybody.</p>
<p>We are also putting, and you can pick your number,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s start with five trillion US dollars,</p>
<p>some massive amount, into a fund</p>
<p>that we will be distributing to the victims of COVID 19</p>
<p>and their, and their.</p>
<p>China would do that?</p>
<p>This is a fantasy speech.</p>
<p>But I disagree with your, I mean, okay.</p>
<p>So you think China has a responsibility?</p>
<p>Well, so it&rsquo;s not the, like just a lab leak.</p>
<p>Like if China on day one had said we have this outbreak,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know where it came from,</p>
<p>we want to have a full investigation,</p>
<p>we call on international,</p>
<p>responsible international partners</p>
<p>to join us in that process,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to do everything in our power</p>
<p>to share the relevant information</p>
<p>because however this started, we&rsquo;re all victims.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a totally different story</p>
<p>than punishing Australia, preventing the WHO,</p>
<p>blocking any investigation,</p>
<p>condemning people who are trying to look, and so that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So cover up for a couple weeks,</p>
<p>you can understand maybe,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much uncertainty.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, let&rsquo;s hide all the Winnie the Pooh pictures</p>
<p>while we figure this out.</p>
<p>But the moment you really figure out what happened,</p>
<p>you always, as a Jew I can say this,</p>
<p>always find like a blame the Jews kind of situation</p>
<p>a little bit, just a little bit.</p>
<p>Be like, all right, it&rsquo;s not us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>But be proactive in saying.</p>
<p>Just to start here, but the joke about that is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big problem because a lot of people</p>
<p>have to leave the Jewish socialist conspiracy</p>
<p>to make it for the Jewish capitalist conspiracy meeting.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So I would say not five trillion,</p>
<p>but some large amount,</p>
<p>and I would really focus on the future,</p>
<p>which is every time we talk about the lab leak,</p>
<p>the unfortunate thing is I feel like people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t focus enough about the future.</p>
<p>To me, the lab leak is important</p>
<p>because we want to construct a kind of framework</p>
<p>of thinking and a global conversation</p>
<p>that minimizes the damage done by future lab leaks,</p>
<p>which will almost certainly happen.</p>
<p>And so to me, any lab leak is about the future.</p>
<p>I would launch a giant investment in saying</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to create a testing infrastructure,</p>
<p>like all of this kind of infrastructure investments</p>
<p>that help minimize the damage of a lab leak</p>
<p>here and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So the challenge with that is one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a fully accountable future system</p>
<p>to prevent these kinds of terrible pandemics</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s built upon obfuscation and coverup</p>
<p>regarding the origins of this worst pandemic in a century.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just like that foundation isn&rsquo;t strong enough.</p>
<p>Second, China across the fields of science</p>
<p>is looking to leapfrog the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So China now has current plans to build BSL4 labs</p>
<p>in every of its province.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re scaling up the.</p>
<p>Scaling up everything ends up with the plan on leading.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, again, I was saying before,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of similarity between this story,</p>
<p>at least as I see it, at least the most probable case,</p>
<p>and these other areas where China gets knowledge</p>
<p>and then tries to leapfrog.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with AI and autonomous killer robots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with human genome editing,</p>
<p>with animal experimentations, with so many,</p>
<p>basically all areas of advanced science.</p>
<p>So the question is, would China stop in that process?</p>
<p>And then third, it&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>of a historical background,</p>
<p>but defending national sovereignty</p>
<p>is one of the core principles of,</p>
<p>certainly of the Chinese state.</p>
<p>And the historical issue is,</p>
<p>for those of us who come from the West,</p>
<p>I mean, one of the lessons of the postwar planners</p>
<p>was that absolute national sovereignty</p>
<p>was actually a major feeder</p>
<p>into the first and second world wars,</p>
<p>that we had all these conflicting states.</p>
<p>And therefore the logic of the postwar system</p>
<p>is we need to in some ways pool sovereignty</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the EU and have transnational organizations</p>
<p>like the UN organizations</p>
<p>and the Bretton Woods organizations.</p>
<p>For most Asian states,</p>
<p>and also even for some African,</p>
<p>and the people who were kind of</p>
<p>on the colonized side of history,</p>
<p>sovereignty was the thing that was denied them.</p>
<p>That was the thing that they want,</p>
<p>that the European power is denied.</p>
<p>And so the idea of giving up sovereignty</p>
<p>was the absolute opposite.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why China is,</p>
<p>and again, I mentioned this Rush Doshi book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that China is trying to strengthen</p>
<p>this rules based international order,</p>
<p>which is based on the principle</p>
<p>that while there are certain things that we share</p>
<p>and how do we build a governance system</p>
<p>to protect those things,</p>
<p>what it seems to be doing is trying</p>
<p>to advance its own sovereignty.</p>
<p>And so I think I agree with you,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that we can just go forward</p>
<p>without some accountability for the.</p>
<p>So the coverup was a big problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I often,</p>
<p>I find myself playing devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to sort of empathize</p>
<p>and then I forget that like two or three people</p>
<p>listen to this thing and then they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>look, Lex is defending the Chinese government</p>
<p>with their coverup.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m just trying to understand.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the same reason I&rsquo;m reading Mein Kampf now</p>
<p>is like you have to really understand the minds of people</p>
<p>as if I too could have done that.</p>
<p>You know, you have to understand</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all the same to some degree</p>
<p>and that kind of empathy is required</p>
<p>to figure out solutions for the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just in empathizing with the Chinese government</p>
<p>in this whole situation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure I understand</p>
<p>how to minimize the chance of a coverup in the future,</p>
<p>whether for China or for the United States.</p>
<p>If the virus started in the United States,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure we would be</p>
<p>with all the emphasis we put on freedom of speech,</p>
<p>with all the emphasis we put on freedom of the press</p>
<p>and access to the press,</p>
<p>the sort of all aspects of government.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the US government</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do the similar kind of coverup.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in Texas now doing this interview.</p>
<p>Imagine there&rsquo;s a kind of horseshoe bat</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll call the Texas Horseshoe Bat and the Texas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of bats in Austin,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a whole thing. It&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s just say that the Texas Horseshoe Bats</p>
<p>only exist in Texas, but in Montana,</p>
<p>we have a thing, it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the Montana Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>And at the Montana Institute of Virology,</p>
<p>they have the world&rsquo;s largest collection</p>
<p>of Texas Horseshoe Bats, including horseshoe bats</p>
<p>that are associated with a previous global pandemic</p>
<p>called the Texas Horseshoe Bat pandemic.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just say that people in Montana,</p>
<p>in the same town where this</p>
<p>Montana Institute of Virology is,</p>
<p>start getting a version of this</p>
<p>Texas Horseshoe Bat syndrome</p>
<p>that is genetically relatively similar</p>
<p>to the outbreak in Texas.</p>
<p>There are no horseshoe bats there.</p>
<p>And the government says, it&rsquo;s your same point,</p>
<p>Alina&rsquo;s point about the unicorns,</p>
<p>like nothing to see here, just move along.</p>
<p>Would Joe Rogan and Brett Weinstein and Josh Rogan,</p>
<p>would they say, oh, I guess, I just think that.</p>
<p>No, no, but the point is the government going to say it.</p>
<p>So, Joe Rogan is a comedian.</p>
<p>Brett Weinstein is a podcaster.</p>
<p>The point is, what we want is not just those folks</p>
<p>to have the freedom to speak, that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But you want the government to have the transparent,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t think Joe Rogan is enough</p>
<p>to hold the government accountable.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re going to do their thing anyway.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s our system,</p>
<p>and that was the genius of the founding fathers.</p>
<p>Is that enough?</p>
<p>That the government probably is going to have</p>
<p>a lot of instincts to do the wrong thing.</p>
<p>That was the experience in England before.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why we have free speech,</p>
<p>to hold the government accountable.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m kind of broadly a gun control person,</p>
<p>but the people who say, well,</p>
<p>we need to have broad gun rights.</p>
<p>As somebody who&rsquo;s now in Texas, I am offended.</p>
<p>But their argument is, look,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t fully trust the government.</p>
<p>If the government, just like we fought against the British,</p>
<p>if the government&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>we want to at least have some authority.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s our system, is to have that kind of voice.</p>
<p>And that is the public voice actually balances.</p>
<p>Because every government, as you correctly said,</p>
<p>every government has the same instincts.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have, and it&rsquo;s imperfect here,</p>
<p>but kind of these ideas of separation of powers,</p>
<p>of inalienable rights, so that we can have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a vast market where we can have balance.</p>
<p>So you think if a lab leak occurred in the United States,</p>
<p>what probability would you put some kind of public report</p>
<p>led by Rand Paul would come out saying this was a lab leak?</p>
<p>You have good confidence that that would happen?</p>
<p>I have pretty decent confidence.</p>
<p>And the reason I say, I mentioned that I&rsquo;m a,</p>
<p>I think of myself, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not anymore,</p>
<p>because as I get older, but as a progressive person,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Democrat and I worked in Democratic administrations,</p>
<p>worked for President Clinton on the National Security Council.</p>
<p>But my kind of best friend in the United States Senate,</p>
<p>who I talk to all the time,</p>
<p>is a Senator from Kansas named Roger Marshall.</p>
<p>And Roger, I mean, if you just lined up our positions</p>
<p>on all sorts of things, we&rsquo;re radically different.</p>
<p>But we have a great relationship.</p>
<p>We talk all the time and we share a commitment to saying,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s ask the tough questions about how this started.</p>
<p>And again, if we had,</p>
<p>like what is the United States government?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the executive branch, but there&rsquo;s also Congress.</p>
<p>And Congress, you talk about Rand Paul,</p>
<p>and as a former executive branch worker,</p>
<p>when I was on the National Security Council,</p>
<p>and I guess technically when I was at the State Department,</p>
<p>all of this stuff, all of this process,</p>
<p>it just seems like a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like these Fers, they&rsquo;re just attacking us.</p>
<p>We tried to do this thing with,</p>
<p>we had all the best intentions</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re holding hearings</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to box us in and whatever.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s our process.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like a form of accountability as chaotic,</p>
<p>as crazy as it is.</p>
<p>And so it makes it really difficult.</p>
<p>I mean, we have other problems of just chaos</p>
<p>and everybody doing their own thing,</p>
<p>but it makes it difficult to have</p>
<p>the kind of systematic coverup.</p>
<p>And again, all of that is predicated on my hypothesis,</p>
<p>not fully proven, although I think likely</p>
<p>that there is a lab incident origin of this pandemic.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we&rsquo;re having like several layers</p>
<p>of conversation, but I think whether lab leak hypothesis</p>
<p>is true or not, it does seem that the likelihood</p>
<p>of a coverup, if it leaked from a lab is high.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the more important conversation to be having.</p>
<p>Well, you could argue a lot of things,</p>
<p>but to me arguably, that&rsquo;s the more important conversation</p>
<p>is about what is the likelihood of a coverup.</p>
<p>100%, like in my mind, there is a legitimate debate</p>
<p>about the origins of the pandemic.</p>
<p>There are people who I respect,</p>
<p>who I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with,</p>
<p>people like Stuart Neal, who&rsquo;s a virologist in the UK,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been very open minded, engaged in productive debate</p>
<p>about the origin and you know where I stand.</p>
<p>There is and can be no debate about whether</p>
<p>or not there has been a coverup.</p>
<p>There has been a coverup.</p>
<p>There is in my mind, no credible argument</p>
<p>that there hasn&rsquo;t been a coverup.</p>
<p>And I mean, we can just see it in the regulations,</p>
<p>in the lack of access.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an incredible woman named Zhang Zhan,</p>
<p>who is a Chinese, we have to call her a citizen journalist</p>
<p>because everything is controlled by the state.</p>
<p>But in the early days of the pandemic,</p>
<p>she went to Wuhan, started taking videos and posting them.</p>
<p>She was imprisoned for picking quarrels,</p>
<p>which is kind of a catchall.</p>
<p>And now she&rsquo;s engaged in a hunger strike</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s near death.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no question that there has been a coverup</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no question in my mind</p>
<p>that that coverup is responsible</p>
<p>for a significant percentage of the total deaths</p>
<p>due to COVID 19.</p>
<p>In a pivot, can I talk to you about sex?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s roll.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re the author of a book, Hacking Darwin.</p>
<p>So humans have used sex, allegedly, as I&rsquo;ve read about,</p>
<p>to mix genetic information to produce offspring</p>
<p>and through that kind of process adapted their environment.</p>
<p>Lex, you mentioned earlier about</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re asking tough questions</p>
<p>and people pushing you to ask tough questions.</p>
<p>Is it okay if I just?</p>
<p>So you said, have done this as I&rsquo;ve read about.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve read about on the internet, yeah.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying, as a person sitting with you,</p>
<p>to people who would be open minded in experimenting</p>
<p>of, as I&rsquo;ve read about, to reality,</p>
<p>what I would say is Lex Friedman is handsome, charming.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really a great guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>Thank you, I appreciate that.</p>
<p>So I was reading about this last night.</p>
<p>I was gonna tweet it, but then I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>this is going to be misinterpreted.</p>
<p>But this is why I like podcasts,</p>
<p>because I can say stuff like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of incredible to me that the average human male</p>
<p>produces 500 billion plus sperm cells in their lifetime.</p>
<p>Each one of those are genetically unique.</p>
<p>They can produce unique humans.</p>
<p>Each one of them, 500 billion,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 100 billion people who&rsquo;s ever lived.</p>
<p>Maybe 110, whatever, whatever the number is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s five times the number of people who ever lived</p>
<p>is produced by each male of genetic information.</p>
<p>So those are all possible trajectories of lives</p>
<p>that could have lived.</p>
<p>Those are all little people that could have been.</p>
<p>And all the possible stories.</p>
<p>All the Hitlers and Einsteins</p>
<p>that could have been created.</p>
<p>And all that, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>this kind of, you&rsquo;re painting this possible future,</p>
<p>and we get to see only one little string of that.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose the magic of that</p>
<p>is also captured by the, in the space of physics,</p>
<p>having multiple dimensions</p>
<p>and the many worlds hypothesis of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>the interpretation that we&rsquo;re basically just,</p>
<p>at every point, there&rsquo;s an infinite offspring</p>
<p>of universes that are created.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s just like a magic</p>
<p>of this game of genetics that we&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>And the winning sperm is not the fastest.</p>
<p>The winning sperm is basically the luckiest,</p>
<p>has the right timing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, I also got into this whole,</p>
<p>I started reading papers about like,</p>
<p>is there something to be said</p>
<p>about who wins the race, right, genetically?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating, because there&rsquo;s studies</p>
<p>in animals and so on to answer that question,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s interesting, because I&rsquo;m a winner, right?</p>
<p>I won, I won a race.</p>
<p>And so you want to know, what does that say about me</p>
<p>in this fascinating genetic race against,</p>
<p>I think, what is it, 200 million others, I think.</p>
<p>So one pool of sperm cells is about something</p>
<p>like 200 million, it could be, yes.</p>
<p>But that, millions, I thought it was much lower than that.</p>
<p>So like that, those are all brothers and sisters of mine,</p>
<p>and I beat them all out, I won.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting to know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a temptation to say I&rsquo;m somehow better than them,</p>
<p>right, and now that goes into the next stage</p>
<p>of something we&rsquo;re deeply thinking about,</p>
<p>which is if we have more control now</p>
<p>over the winning genetic code that becomes offspring,</p>
<p>if we have first not even control,</p>
<p>just information and then control,</p>
<p>what do you think that world looks like</p>
<p>from a biological perspective</p>
<p>and from an ethical perspective</p>
<p>when we start getting more information and more control?</p>
<p>Yeah, great question.</p>
<p>So first, on the sperm, there can be up to</p>
<p>about 1.2 billion sperm cells in a male ejaculation.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned in Hacking Darwin,</p>
<p>male sperm, it&rsquo;s kind of a dime a dozen</p>
<p>with all the guys in all the world</p>
<p>just doing whatever they do with it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an open question how competitive,</p>
<p>I mean, there is an element of luck</p>
<p>and there is an element of competition,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an open question how much that competition</p>
<p>impacts the outcome or whether it&rsquo;s just luck,</p>
<p>but my guess is there&rsquo;s some combination</p>
<p>of fitness and luck.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re absolutely right that all of those other</p>
<p>sperm cells in the ejaculation,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s how the union of the sperm and egg is happening,</p>
<p>all of them represent a different future.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a wonderful book called Invisible Cities</p>
<p>by Italo Calvino, and he even talks about a city</p>
<p>as something like this where everybody,</p>
<p>you have your life,</p>
<p>but then you have all these alternate lives</p>
<p>and every time you make any decision,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of, and so, but in this Invisible Cities,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little string that goes toward that alternate life</p>
<p>and then the city becomes this weaving</p>
<p>of all the strings of people&rsquo;s real lives</p>
<p>and the alternate lives that they could have taken</p>
<p>had they made any other different steps.</p>
<p>So that part, it&rsquo;s like a deep philosophical question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just for us, it&rsquo;s for all of,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s baked into evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just what are the different strategies</p>
<p>for different species to achieve fitness?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some of the different corals or other fish</p>
<p>where they just kind of release the eggs into the water</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all different kinds of ways.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re right in my book, Hacking Darwin,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the full title is Hacking Darwin,</p>
<p>Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity.</p>
<p>I kind of go deep into exploring</p>
<p>the big picture implications of the future</p>
<p>of human reproduction.</p>
<p>We are already participating</p>
<p>in a revolutionary transformation,</p>
<p>not just because of the diagnostics that we have,</p>
<p>things like ultrasound, but because now</p>
<p>an increasing number of us are being born</p>
<p>through in vitro fertilization,</p>
<p>which means the eggs are extracted from the mother,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fertilized by the father&rsquo;s sperm in vitro in a lab,</p>
<p>and then reimplanted in the mother.</p>
<p>On top of that, there&rsquo;s a somewhat newer,</p>
<p>but still now older technology</p>
<p>called preimplantation genetic testing.</p>
<p>And so as everyone knows from high school biology,</p>
<p>you have the fertilized egg,</p>
<p>and then it goes one cell to two cells</p>
<p>to four to eight and whatever.</p>
<p>And after around five days in this PGT process,</p>
<p>a few cells are extracted.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you have 10 fertilized eggs,</p>
<p>early stage embryos, a few cells are extracted from each,</p>
<p>and those cells, if they would,</p>
<p>the ones that are extracted</p>
<p>would end up becoming the placenta.</p>
<p>But every one of our cells has, other than a few,</p>
<p>has our full genome.</p>
<p>And so then you sequence those cells</p>
<p>and with preimplantation genetic testing now,</p>
<p>what you can do is you can screen out deadly single gel,</p>
<p>a single gene mutation disorders,</p>
<p>things that could be deadly or life ruining.</p>
<p>And so people use it to determine</p>
<p>which of those 10 early stage embryos</p>
<p>to implant in a mother.</p>
<p>As we shift towards a much greater understanding</p>
<p>of genetics, and that is part of our,</p>
<p>just the broader genetics revolution,</p>
<p>but within that, in our transition from personalized</p>
<p>to precision healthcare, more and more of us</p>
<p>are going to have our whole genome sequenced</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna be the foundation</p>
<p>of getting personalized healthcare.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have already millions, but very soon,</p>
<p>billions of people who&rsquo;ve had their whole genome sequenced.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll have big databases</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s genetic genotypic information</p>
<p>and life or phenotypic information.</p>
<p>And using, coming into your area,</p>
<p>our tools of machine learning and data analytics,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be able to increasingly understand</p>
<p>patterns of genetic expression, even though we&rsquo;re all.</p>
<p>So predict how the genetic information will get expressed.</p>
<p>Correct. Yeah.</p>
<p>Never perfectly perhaps, but more and more,</p>
<p>always more and more.</p>
<p>And so with that information, we aren&rsquo;t going to just be,</p>
<p>even now, we aren&rsquo;t going to just be selecting based on</p>
<p>which of these 10 early stage embryos</p>
<p>is carrying a deadly genetic disorder,</p>
<p>but we can, we&rsquo;ll be able to know everything</p>
<p>that can be partly or entirely predicted by genetics.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of our humanity</p>
<p>that fits into that category.</p>
<p>And certainly simple traits like height and eye color</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>I mean, height is not at all simple,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, if you have good nutrition,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s entirely or mostly genetic.</p>
<p>But even personality traits and personality styles,</p>
<p>there are a lot of things that we see just as the experience,</p>
<p>the beauty of life that are partly have a genetic foundation.</p>
<p>And so whatever part of these traits are definable</p>
<p>and influenced by genetics,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have greater and greater predictability</p>
<p>within a range.</p>
<p>And so selecting those embryos will be informed</p>
<p>by that kind of knowledge.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why in Hacking Darwin,</p>
<p>I talk about embryo selection as being a key driver</p>
<p>of the future of human evolution.</p>
<p>But then on top of that, there is in 2012,</p>
<p>Shinya Yamanaka, an amazing Japanese scientist</p>
<p>won the Nobel Prize for developing a process</p>
<p>for creating what are called induced pluripotent stem cells,</p>
<p>IPS cells.</p>
<p>And what IPS cells are is you can induce an adult cell</p>
<p>to go back in evolutionary time and become a stem cell.</p>
<p>And a stem cell is like when we&rsquo;re a fertilized egg,</p>
<p>like our entire blueprint is in that one cell</p>
<p>and that cell can be anything,</p>
<p>but then it starts to, our cells start to specialize.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have skin cells and blood cells</p>
<p>and all the different types of things.</p>
<p>So with the Yamanaka process,</p>
<p>we can induce an adult cell to become a stem cell.</p>
<p>So the relevance to this story is what you can do.</p>
<p>And it works now in animal models.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, it hasn&rsquo;t yet been done in humans,</p>
<p>but it works pretty well in animal models.</p>
<p>You take any adult cell,</p>
<p>but skin cells are probably the easiest.</p>
<p>You induce this skin cell into a stem cell.</p>
<p>And if you just take a little skin graft,</p>
<p>it would have millions of cells.</p>
<p>You induce those skin cells into stem cells.</p>
<p>Then you induce those stem cells into egg precursor cells.</p>
<p>Then you induce those egg precursor cells into eggs,</p>
<p>egg cells.</p>
<p>Then because we have this massive overabundance</p>
<p>of male sperm, then you could fertilize,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it 10,000 of the mother&rsquo;s eggs.</p>
<p>So you have 10,000 eggs, which are fertilized.</p>
<p>Sounds like a party.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Then you have an automated process</p>
<p>for what I mentioned before</p>
<p>in preimplantation genetic testing,</p>
<p>you grow them all for five days,</p>
<p>you extract a few cells from each, you test them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I had a piece in the New York Times</p>
<p>a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>imagining what it would be like to go to a fertility clinic</p>
<p>in the year 2050.</p>
<p>And the choice is not.</p>
<p>No humans involved.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, there are, but the choice is not,</p>
<p>do you want a kid who does or doesn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it Tay Sachs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole range of possibilities,</p>
<p>including very intimate traits</p>
<p>like height, IQ, personality style.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you can predict everything,</p>
<p>but it means there will be increasing predictability.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re choosing from 10,000 eggs,</p>
<p>fertilized eggs, early stage embryos,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of choice.</p>
<p>And on top of that,</p>
<p>then we have the new technology of human genome editing.</p>
<p>Many people have heard of CRISPR,</p>
<p>but what I say is if you think of human genome editing</p>
<p>as a pie, sorry, human genome engineering as a pie,</p>
<p>genome editing is a slice</p>
<p>and CRISPR is just a sliver of that slice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of our tools for genome editing</p>
<p>and things are getting better and better.</p>
<p>Then you can go in and change.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, I mean, again, it starts simple.</p>
<p>A small number of genes,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve selected from among the one of 10</p>
<p>or the one of 10,000,</p>
<p>but there are a number of changes</p>
<p>that you would like to make to achieve some kind of outcome.</p>
<p>And biology is incredibly complex</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not that one gene does one thing.</p>
<p>One gene does probably a lot of things simultaneously,</p>
<p>which is why the decision about changing one gene</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s causing deathly harm is easier</p>
<p>than when we think about the complexity of biology.</p>
<p>But then the machine learning</p>
<p>gets better and better at predicting</p>
<p>the full complexity of biology.</p>
<p>So as one gets better,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re editing your ability to reliably edit</p>
<p>such that the conclusions are predictable,</p>
<p>it gets better and better.</p>
<p>So those two are coupled together.</p>
<p>You got it, that&rsquo;s exactly it.</p>
<p>And then, so that&rsquo;s why, and people would say,</p>
<p>well, that, I mean, I wrote about that</p>
<p>in my two science fiction novels,</p>
<p>Genesis Code and Eternal Sonata years ago,</p>
<p>and especially with Genesis Code, I wrote about that.</p>
<p>And as a sci fi,</p>
<p>and I had actually testified before Congress,</p>
<p>but now 15 years ago saying,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what the future looks like.</p>
<p>But even I, and in my first edition of Hacking Darwin,</p>
<p>when it was already in production,</p>
<p>and then in November 2018,</p>
<p>this scientist, Hojong Kui, announced in Hong Kong</p>
<p>that the world&rsquo;s first two, and later three,</p>
<p>CRISPR babies had been born,</p>
<p>which he had genetically altered,</p>
<p>and misguided, in my view, and dangerous view,</p>
<p>dangerous goal of making it so they would have</p>
<p>increased resistance to HIV.</p>
<p>And so I called my publisher,</p>
<p>and I said, I&rsquo;ve got good news and bad news.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the bad news,</p>
<p>is that the world&rsquo;s first CRISPR babies have been born,</p>
<p>and so we need to pull my book out of production,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t have a book on the future</p>
<p>of human genetic engineering,</p>
<p>and have it not mention the first CRISPR babies</p>
<p>that had been born.</p>
<p>But the good news is, in the book,</p>
<p>I had predicted that it&rsquo;s going to happen,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to happen in China, and here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>And all we need to do is add a few more sentences,</p>
<p>and that was the hardback,</p>
<p>and then I updated it more in the paperback,</p>
<p>saying, and it happened, and it was announced on this day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, then let&rsquo;s fast forward.</p>
<p>Given your predictions are slowly becoming reality,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about some philosophy,</p>
<p>and ethics, I suppose.</p>
<p>So I can, I&rsquo;m not being too self deprecating here,</p>
<p>and saying if my parents had the choice,</p>
<p>I would be probably less likely to come out the winner.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all weird, and I&rsquo;m certainly a very distinctly</p>
<p>weird specimen of the human species.</p>
<p>I can give the full long list of flaws,</p>
<p>and we can be very poetic of saying those are features,</p>
<p>and so on, but they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>If you look at the menu.</p>
<p>Again, for these women who are listening,</p>
<p>apropos of your thing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all kind of charming individualities.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s beautiful, that&rsquo;s one, yes, thank you.</p>
<p>But anyway, but on the full sort of individual,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say IQ alone, right?</p>
<p>That what do we do about a world</p>
<p>where IQ could be selected on a menu</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re having children?</p>
<p>What concerns you about that world?</p>
<p>What excites you about that world?</p>
<p>Are there certain metrics that excite you more than others?</p>
<p>IQ has been a source of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not sure IQ as a measure,</p>
<p>flawed as it is, has been used to celebrate</p>
<p>the successes of the human species</p>
<p>nearly as much as has been used to divide people,</p>
<p>to say negative things about people,</p>
<p>to make negative claims about people.</p>
<p>And in that same way, it seems like</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a selection, a genetic selection based on IQ,</p>
<p>you can start now having classes of citizenry,</p>
<p>like further divide, you know, the rich get richer.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;ll be very rich people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be able to do kind of fine selection of IQ</p>
<p>and they will start forming these classes</p>
<p>of super intelligent people.</p>
<p>And those super intelligent people in their minds</p>
<p>would of course be the right people</p>
<p>to be making global authoritarian decisions</p>
<p>about everybody else, all the usual aspects of human nature,</p>
<p>but now magnified with the new tools of technology.</p>
<p>Anyway, all that to say is what&rsquo;s exciting to you?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s concerning to you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question and just stepping into the IQ,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll call it a quagmire for now,</p>
<p>it raises a lot of big issues which are complicated.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve listened to Sam Harris&rsquo;s interview</p>
<p>with Charles Murray and then that spawned</p>
<p>kind of a whole industry of debate.</p>
<p>So first, just the background of IQ</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s from the early 20th century</p>
<p>and there was the idea that we can measure</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s general intelligence</p>
<p>and there are so many different kinds of intelligence.</p>
<p>This was measuring a specific thing.</p>
<p>So my feeling is that IQ is not a perfect measure</p>
<p>of intelligence, but it&rsquo;s a perfect measure of IQ.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s measuring what it&rsquo;s measuring,</p>
<p>but that thing correlates to a lot of things</p>
<p>which are rewarded in our society.</p>
<p>So every study of IQ has shown that people</p>
<p>with higher IQs, they make more money,</p>
<p>they live longer, they have more stable relationships.</p>
<p>I mean, that could be something in the testing,</p>
<p>but as Sam Harris has talked about a lot,</p>
<p>you could line up all of these kind of IQ</p>
<p>and IQ like tests correlate with each other.</p>
<p>So the people who score high on one, score high on all</p>
<p>of them and people think that IQ tests are like a thing</p>
<p>like the Earl of Dorchester is coming for dinner.</p>
<p>Does he have two forks or three forks</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that a lot of them are things</p>
<p>that I think a lot of us would recognize are relevant.</p>
<p>Just like how much stuff can you memorize?</p>
<p>If you see some shapes, how can you position them</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>And so IQ, I mean, it really hit its stride</p>
<p>and certainly in the second world war</p>
<p>when our governments were processing a lot of people</p>
<p>and trying to figure out who to put in what jobs.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the starting point.</p>
<p>Let me start first with the negatives.</p>
<p>That our societies, when we talk about diversity</p>
<p>in Darwinian terms, it&rsquo;s not like diversity</p>
<p>is from Darwinian terms.</p>
<p>Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we have some moths</p>
<p>of different colors because it&rsquo;ll be really fun</p>
<p>to have different colored moths.</p>
<p>Diversity is the sole survival strategy of our species</p>
<p>and of every species.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s impossible to predict what diversity</p>
<p>is going to be rewarded.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said this before, if you went down</p>
<p>and you spoke T. rex and you spoke to the dinosaurs</p>
<p>and said, hey, you can select your kids,</p>
<p>what criteria do you want?</p>
<p>And they say, oh, yeah, sharp teeth, cruel fangs,</p>
<p>roar, whatever it is that makes you a great T. rex.</p>
<p>But the answer from an evolutionary perspective,</p>
<p>from an earth perspective was, oh, it&rsquo;s much better</p>
<p>to be like a cockroach or an alligator</p>
<p>or some little nothing or a little shrew</p>
<p>because the dinosaurs are gonna get wiped out</p>
<p>when the asteroid hits.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no better or worse in evolution.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just better or worse suited for a given environment.</p>
<p>And when that environment changes,</p>
<p>the best suited person from the old system</p>
<p>could be the worst suited person for the new one.</p>
<p>So if we start selecting for the things</p>
<p>that we value the most, including things like IQ,</p>
<p>but even disease resistance, I mean, this is well known,</p>
<p>but people who are recessive carrier of sickle cell disease</p>
<p>have increased resistance to malaria,</p>
<p>which is the biggest reason why that trait</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t just disappeared given how deadly</p>
<p>sickle cell disease is.</p>
<p>Biology is incredibly complex.</p>
<p>We understand such a tiny percentage of it</p>
<p>that we need to have, in your words,</p>
<p>just a level of humility.</p>
<p>There are huge equity issues as you&rsquo;ve articulated.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say that it is the case that in our society,</p>
<p>IQ and IQ like traits are highly rewarded.</p>
<p>There is an equity issue, but it works in both ways.</p>
<p>Because my guess is, let&rsquo;s just say that we had a society</p>
<p>where we were doing genome sequencing</p>
<p>of everybody who was born.</p>
<p>And we had some predictive model to predict IQ.</p>
<p>And we had decided as a society that IQ</p>
<p>was going to be what we were going to select for.</p>
<p>We were gonna put the highest IQ people</p>
<p>in these different roles.</p>
<p>I guarantee you the people in those roles</p>
<p>would not be the people who are legacy admissions to Harvard.</p>
<p>They would very likely be people who are born in slums,</p>
<p>people who are born with no opportunity or in refugee camps</p>
<p>who are just wasting away because we&rsquo;ve thrown them away.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s an easy, like it&rsquo;s the idea of just being able</p>
<p>to look under the hood of our humanity</p>
<p>is really scary for everybody.</p>
<p>And it should be.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m also an Ashkenazi Jew.</p>
<p>My father was born in Austria.</p>
<p>My father and grandparents came here as refugees.</p>
<p>After the war, most of that side of the family was killed.</p>
<p>So I get what it means to be on the other,</p>
<p>I mean, you said you&rsquo;re reading Mein Kampf,</p>
<p>on the other side of the story when someone said,</p>
<p>well, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s good and you&rsquo;re not good.</p>
<p>And therefore you&rsquo;re, so I totally get that.</p>
<p>Having said that, I do believe that we&rsquo;re moving toward</p>
<p>a new way of procreating.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to have to decide what are the values</p>
<p>that we would like to realize through that process?</p>
<p>Is it randomness, which is what we currently have now,</p>
<p>which is not totally random</p>
<p>because we have a sort of mating through colleges</p>
<p>and other things.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Wait, mating through what?</p>
<p>Colleges?</p>
<p>Sort of like if you go, if you go to Harvard or whatever,</p>
<p>and your wife also goes to Harvard, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s location based mating.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not location, it&rsquo;s selection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there are selections that are made</p>
<p>about who gets to a certain place.</p>
<p>And when like, it&rsquo;s like Harvard admissions is a filter.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to have to decide what are the values</p>
<p>that we want to realize through this process</p>
<p>because diversity has, it&rsquo;s just baked into our biology.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the first species ever that has the opportunity</p>
<p>to make choices about things that were otherwise baked</p>
<p>into our biology.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a real danger that if we make bad choices,</p>
<p>even with good intentions, it could even drive us</p>
<p>toward extinction and certainly undermine our humanity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I always say, and like I said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deeply involved with WHO and other things,</p>
<p>that these aren&rsquo;t conversations about science.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re conversations.</p>
<p>Science brings us to the conversation,</p>
<p>but the conversation is about values and ethics.</p>
<p>As you described, that world is wide open.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a subtly different world.</p>
<p>That world is fundamentally different</p>
<p>from anything we understand about life on Earth</p>
<p>because natural selection, this random process,</p>
<p>is so fundamental how we think about life.</p>
<p>Being able to program, I mean, it has a chance to,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;ll probably make my question</p>
<p>about the ethical concerns around IQ based selection</p>
<p>just meaningless because it&rsquo;ll change the nature of identity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible it will dissolve identity</p>
<p>because we take so much pride in all the different</p>
<p>characteristics that make us who we are.</p>
<p>Whenever you have some control over those characteristics,</p>
<p>those characteristics start losing meaning.</p>
<p>And what may start gaining meaning is the ideas</p>
<p>inside our heads, for example,</p>
<p>versus like the details of like,</p>
<p>is it a Commodore 64, is it a PC, is it a Mac?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be less important than the software</p>
<p>that runs on it.</p>
<p>So we can more and more be operating in the digital space</p>
<p>and the identity could be something</p>
<p>that borrows multiple bodies.</p>
<p>Like the legacy of our ideas may become more important</p>
<p>than the details of our physical embodiment.</p>
<p>Like it, I mean, I&rsquo;m saying perhaps</p>
<p>ridiculous sounding things, but the point is</p>
<p>it will bring up so many new ethical concerns</p>
<p>that our narrow minded thinking about</p>
<p>the current ethical concerns would not apply.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s important to think about</p>
<p>all this kind of stuff, like actively.</p>
<p>What are the right conversations to be having now?</p>
<p>Because it feels like it&rsquo;s an ongoing conversation</p>
<p>that then continually evolves, like with NIH involved.</p>
<p>Like do you do experiments with animals?</p>
<p>Do you build these brain organoids?</p>
<p>Do you, like through that process you described</p>
<p>with the stem cells, like do you experiment</p>
<p>with a bunch of organisms to see how genetic material,</p>
<p>what form that actually takes,</p>
<p>how to minimize the chance of cancer</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>What are the negative consequences of that?</p>
<p>What are the positive consequences?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a fascinating world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really fascinating world.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then, but those conversations</p>
<p>are just so essential.</p>
<p>Like we have to be talking about ethics.</p>
<p>And then that raises the question of who is the we?</p>
<p>And coming back to your conversation</p>
<p>about science communication,</p>
<p>maybe there was a time earlier</p>
<p>when these conversations needed to be,</p>
<p>were held among a small number of experts</p>
<p>who made decisions on behalf of everybody else.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>is really the future of our species.</p>
<p>And I think that conversation is too important</p>
<p>to be left just to experts and government officials.</p>
<p>So I mentioned that I&rsquo;m a member,</p>
<p>we just ended our work after two years</p>
<p>of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Committee</p>
<p>on Human Genome Editing.</p>
<p>And my big push in that process</p>
<p>was to have education, engagement and empowerment</p>
<p>of the broad public to bring,</p>
<p>not just bring people into the conversation</p>
<p>with the tools to be able to engage,</p>
<p>but also into the decision making process.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a real shift.</p>
<p>And there are countries that are doing it</p>
<p>better than others.</p>
<p>I mean, Denmark is obviously a much smaller country</p>
<p>than the United States,</p>
<p>but they have a really well developed infrastructure</p>
<p>for public engagement</p>
<p>around really complicated scientific issues.</p>
<p>And I just think that we have to,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s great that we have Twitter</p>
<p>and all these other things,</p>
<p>but we need structured conversations</p>
<p>where we can really bring people together</p>
<p>and listen to each other,</p>
<p>which feels like it&rsquo;s harder than ever.</p>
<p>But even now in this process</p>
<p>where all these people are shouting at each other,</p>
<p>at least there are a bunch of people</p>
<p>who are in the conversation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, we have a foundation,</p>
<p>but we just really need to do more work.</p>
<p>And again, and again, and again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about ethics and values</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re at an age,</p>
<p>and this has become a cliche</p>
<p>of exponential technological change.</p>
<p>And so the rate of change is faster going forward</p>
<p>than it has been in the past.</p>
<p>So in our minds, we underappreciate</p>
<p>how quickly things are changing and will change.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re not careful,</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t know who we are and what our values are,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to get lost.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have to know technology.</p>
<p>We have to know who we are.</p>
<p>I mean, our values are hard won over thousands of years.</p>
<p>No matter how new the technology is,</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t jettison our values</p>
<p>because that is our primary navigational tool.</p>
<p>Absurd question.</p>
<p>Because we were saying that sexual reproduction</p>
<p>is not the best way to define the offspring.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;ll be a day when humans stop having sex?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll stop having sex</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so enjoyable,</p>
<p>but we may significantly stop having sex for reproduction.</p>
<p>Even today, most human sex is not for making babies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for other things,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s pleasure or love or pair bonding or whatever.</p>
<p>Intimacy.</p>
<p>I mean, some people do it for intimacy.</p>
<p>Some people do it for pleasure with strangers.</p>
<p>I feel like the people that do it for pleasure,</p>
<p>I feel like there will be better ways</p>
<p>to achieve that same chemical pleasure, right?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s just so many different kinds of people.</p>
<p>I just saw this on television,</p>
<p>but there are people who put on those big bunny outfits</p>
<p>and go and have sex with other people.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just like an unlimited number</p>
<p>of different kinds of people.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>so I remember hearing about this,</p>
<p>I think Dan Savage is a podcast.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re called Furries.</p>
<p>Furries.</p>
<p>Furry parties.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re just&hellip;</p>
<p>I love people.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s like the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, whenever you hear these words,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>What will they think of next?</p>
<p>So, but I do think that,</p>
<p>and I write about this in Hacking Darwin,</p>
<p>that as people come to believe that having,</p>
<p>that making children through the application of science</p>
<p>is safer and more beneficial</p>
<p>than having children through sex,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll start to see a shift over time</p>
<p>toward reproduction through science.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll still have sex for all the same great reasons</p>
<p>that we do it now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just reproduction less and less through the act of sex.</p>
<p>Man, it&rsquo;s such a fascinating future.</p>
<p>Because as somebody, I value flaws.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the good will hunting,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the good stuff.</p>
<p>The flaws, the weird quirks of humans,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what makes us who we are, the weird.</p>
<p>The weird is the beautiful.</p>
<p>And I, there&rsquo;s a fear of optimization that I&hellip;</p>
<p>You should have it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very healthy.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, I was saying before,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the danger of all of this selection</p>
<p>is that we make selections just based on social norms</p>
<p>that are so deeply internal</p>
<p>that they feel like they&rsquo;re eternal truths.</p>
<p>And so we talked about selecting for IQ.</p>
<p>What about selecting for a kind heart?</p>
<p>Like there are lots of them.</p>
<p>You talked about Hitler and Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>Hitler had certainly had a high IQ,</p>
<p>I guess is higher than average IQ.</p>
<p>If we just select,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why I was saying before,</p>
<p>diversity is baked into our biology.</p>
<p>But the key lesson, and I&rsquo;ve said this many times before,</p>
<p>the key lesson of this moment in our history</p>
<p>is that after nearly 4 billion years of evolution,</p>
<p>our one species suddenly has the unique</p>
<p>and increasing ability to read, write,</p>
<p>and hack the code of life.</p>
<p>And so as we apply these godlike powers</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve now assumed for ourselves,</p>
<p>we better be pretty careful</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so easy to make mistakes,</p>
<p>particularly mistakes that are guided</p>
<p>by our best intentions.</p>
<p>To jump briefly back onto lab leak,</p>
<p>and I swear there&rsquo;s a reason for that,</p>
<p>what did you think about the Jon Stewart,</p>
<p>this moment, I forget when it was, maybe a few months ago,</p>
<p>in the summer, I think, of 2021,</p>
<p>where he went on Colbert Report,</p>
<p>or not the Colbert Report, sorry,</p>
<p>the Stephen Colbert&rsquo;s, whatever his show is.</p>
<p>But again, Jon Stewart reminded us</p>
<p>how valuable his wit and brilliance</p>
<p>within the humor was for our culture.</p>
<p>And so he did this whole bit</p>
<p>that highlighted the common sense nature</p>
<p>about what was the metaphor he used</p>
<p>about the Hershey factory in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;d you think about that whole bit?</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>And so not to be overly self referential,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard not to be overly self referential</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing a, however long we are,</p>
<p>five hour interview about yourself,</p>
<p>which it reminds me of when you had Bret Weinstein on,</p>
<p>he said, I have no ego,</p>
<p>but these 57 people have screwed me over,</p>
<p>and I deserve credit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>So I am a person, I will confess, it&rsquo;s enjoyable.</p>
<p>Some people feel different.</p>
<p>I kind of like talking about all this stuff</p>
<p>and talking, period.</p>
<p>So for me, in the earliest,</p>
<p>I remember those early days of when the pandemic started,</p>
<p>I was just sitting down,</p>
<p>it was late January, early February, 2020,</p>
<p>and I just was laying out all of the evidence</p>
<p>just that I could collect,</p>
<p>trying to say, make sense of where does this come from?</p>
<p>And it was just logic.</p>
<p>I mean, it was all of the things that Jon Stewart said,</p>
<p>which in some overly wordy form</p>
<p>were all at that time on my website.</p>
<p>Like, what are the odds of having this outbreak</p>
<p>of a bat coronavirus more than a thousand miles away</p>
<p>from where these bats have their natural habitat,</p>
<p>where they have this largest collection</p>
<p>of these bat coronaviruses in the world,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing all these very aggressive</p>
<p>research projects to make them more aggressive.</p>
<p>And then you have the outbreak of a virus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s primed for human to human transmission.</p>
<p>It was just logic was my first step.</p>
<p>And I kept gathering the information.</p>
<p>But Jon Stewart distilled that</p>
<p>in a way that just everybody got.</p>
<p>And I think that, like, I loved it.</p>
<p>And I just think that there&rsquo;s a way of reaching people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reason why I write science fiction</p>
<p>in addition to thinking and writing about the science</p>
<p>is that we kind of have to reach people where they are.</p>
<p>And I just thought it was just,</p>
<p>there was a lot of depth, I thought,</p>
<p>and maybe that&rsquo;s too self serving,</p>
<p>but like in the analysis,</p>
<p>but he captured that into those things about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the, whatever, the outbreak of chewy goodness</p>
<p>near the Hershey factory.</p>
<p>I wonder where that came from.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s the humor, there&rsquo;s metaphor.</p>
<p>Also the, like, sticking with the joke</p>
<p>when the audience is,</p>
<p>the audience is Stephen Colbert.</p>
<p>He was, like, resisting it.</p>
<p>He was very uncomfortable with it.</p>
<p>Maybe that was part of the bit, I&rsquo;m not sure,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t look like it.</p>
<p>So Stephen in that moment kind of represented</p>
<p>the discomfort of the scientific community, I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting, that whole dynamic.</p>
<p>And I think that was a pivotal moment.</p>
<p>That just, like, highlights the value of comedy,</p>
<p>the value of, like, when Joe Rogan says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a comedian.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s such a funny thing to say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying I&rsquo;m just a podcaster</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m just a writer, I&rsquo;m just a, you know.</p>
<p>That ability in so few words</p>
<p>to express what everybody else is thinking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so refreshing.</p>
<p>And I wish the scientific communicators would do that too.</p>
<p>A little humor, a little humor.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what I love Elon Musk very much.</p>
<p>So, like, the way he communicates is, like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so refreshing for a CEO of a major company,</p>
<p>several major companies, to just have a sense of humor</p>
<p>and say ridiculous shit every once in a while.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so, there&rsquo;s something to that.</p>
<p>Like, it shakes up the whole conversation</p>
<p>to where it gives you freedom to, like, think publicly.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re always trying to say the proper thing,</p>
<p>you lose the freedom to think, to reason out,</p>
<p>to be authentic and genuine.</p>
<p>When you allow yourself the freedom</p>
<p>to regularly say stupid shit,</p>
<p>have fun, make fun of yourself,</p>
<p>I think you give yourself freedom</p>
<p>to really be a great scientist.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think scientists have a lot to learn</p>
<p>from comedians.</p>
<p>Well, for sure.</p>
<p>I think we all do about just distilling and communicating</p>
<p>in ways that people can hear.</p>
<p>Like, a lot of us say things and people just can&rsquo;t hear them</p>
<p>either because of the way we&rsquo;re saying them</p>
<p>or where they are, but.</p>
<p>And like I said before, I&rsquo;m a big fan of Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on his show twice.</p>
<p>And when Francis Collins was in his conversation with you,</p>
<p>he said, which I think makes sense,</p>
<p>is that when somebody has that kind of platform</p>
<p>and people rightly or wrongly who follow them</p>
<p>and look to them for guidance,</p>
<p>I do think that there is some responsibility</p>
<p>for people in those roles to make whatever judgment</p>
<p>that they make and to share that.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned to you when we were off mic,</p>
<p>Sanjay Gupta is a very close friend of mine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been friends for many years</p>
<p>and I fully supported Sanjay&rsquo;s instinct</p>
<p>to go on the Joe Rogan show.</p>
<p>I thought it was great.</p>
<p>At the end of that whole conversation, Joe said,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m just a comedian, what do I know?</p>
<p>And I just felt that, yes, Joe Rogan is a comedian.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say just a comedian among other things.</p>
<p>But I also felt that he had a responsibility</p>
<p>for just saying whatever he believed,</p>
<p>even if he believed or believes as I think is the case</p>
<p>that ivermectin should be studied more,</p>
<p>which I certainly agree.</p>
<p>And that healthy people shouldn&rsquo;t get vaccinated,</p>
<p>healthy young people, which I don&rsquo;t agree.</p>
<p>I just felt at the end of that conversation to say,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m just a comedian, what do I know?</p>
<p>I feel like it didn&rsquo;t fully integrate the power</p>
<p>that a person like Joe Rogan has to set the agenda.</p>
<p>So I think the reason he says I&rsquo;m just a comedian</p>
<p>is the same reason I say I&rsquo;m an idiot,</p>
<p>which I truly believe.</p>
<p>I can explain exactly what I mean by that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more for him, or in this case for me,</p>
<p>to just keep yourself humble.</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s a slippery slope</p>
<p>when you think you have a responsibility</p>
<p>to then think you actually have an authority,</p>
<p>because a lot of people listen to you,</p>
<p>you think you have an authority</p>
<p>to actually speak to those people</p>
<p>and you have enough authority</p>
<p>to know what the hell you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s just the humility</p>
<p>to just kind of make it fun of yourself</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extremely valuable.</p>
<p>And saying I&rsquo;m just a comedian I think is a reminder</p>
<p>to himself that he&rsquo;s often full of shit, so are all of us.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a really powerful way for himself</p>
<p>to keep himself humble.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s really useful</p>
<p>in some kind of way for people in general</p>
<p>to make fun of themselves a little bit,</p>
<p>in whatever way that means.</p>
<p>And saying I&rsquo;m just a comedian is just one way to do that.</p>
<p>Now that coupled that with the responsibility</p>
<p>of doing the research and really having an open mind</p>
<p>and all those kinds of stuff,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something Joe does really well</p>
<p>on a lot of topics, but he can&rsquo;t do that on everything.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s up to people to decide</p>
<p>how well he does it on certain topics and not others.</p>
<p>But how do you think Sanjay did in that conversation?</p>
<p>So I know I&rsquo;m gonna get myself into trouble here</p>
<p>because Sanjay is a very close friend.</p>
<p>Joe, my personal interaction with him</p>
<p>has been our two interviews,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like my interview with now,</p>
<p>sit down with somebody for four hours,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot and great and then private communication.</p>
<p>So I am personally more sympathetic to the arguments</p>
<p>that Sanjay was making or trying to make.</p>
<p>I believe that the threat of the virus</p>
<p>is greater than the threat of the vaccine.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that we can guarantee 100% safety</p>
<p>for the vaccine,</p>
<p>but these are really well tolerated vaccines.</p>
<p>And we know for all the reasons we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>that this is a really scary virus</p>
<p>and particularly the mRNA vaccines,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re basically doing is getting your body</p>
<p>to replicate a tiny little piece of the virus,</p>
<p>the spike protein and then your body responds to that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a much less of an insult to your body</p>
<p>than being infected by the virus.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m more sympathetic to the people who say,</p>
<p>well, everybody should get vaccinated,</p>
<p>but people who&rsquo;ve already been infected,</p>
<p>we should study whether they need to be vaccinated or not.</p>
<p>Having said all of that, I felt that</p>
<p>that Joe Rogan won the debate.</p>
<p>I mean, it was, and the reason that I felt</p>
<p>that he won the debate was they were kind of,</p>
<p>they had two different categories of arguments.</p>
<p>So Sanjay, what he was trying to do,</p>
<p>which I totally respect was saying,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much animosity between the,</p>
<p>on these different sides, let&rsquo;s lower the temperature.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s model that we can have a respectful dialogue</p>
<p>with each other where we can actually listen.</p>
<p>And Sanjay, again, I&rsquo;ve known him for many years.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very empathic, humble,</p>
<p>just an all around wonderful human being,</p>
<p>and I really love him.</p>
<p>And so he was making cases that were based on</p>
<p>kind of averages, studies and things like that.</p>
<p>And Joe was saying, well, I know a guy whose sister&rsquo;s cousin</p>
<p>had this experience.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that it&rsquo;s all true in the sense</p>
<p>that we have millions of people who are getting vaccinated</p>
<p>and different things.</p>
<p>And what Sanjay should have said was,</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s anecdote.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another anecdote of like when Francis Collins</p>
<p>was with you and he talked about the world wrestling guy</p>
<p>who was like 6.6 and a big muscly guy,</p>
<p>and then he got COVID and he was anti vaccine,</p>
<p>and then he got COVID and almost died.</p>
<p>And he said, I&rsquo;m gonna.</p>
<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t know if you know this part.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, this is funny.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s gonna listen to this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna be laughing.</p>
<p>Does Joe listen like to the four hours of this</p>
<p>in addition to the three hours of his interviews every day?</p>
<p>No, not every day, but he listens to a lot of these.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And we talk about it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>We argue about it.</p>
<p>Hi, Joe.</p>
<p>Hey, Joe.</p>
<p>We love you, Joe.</p>
<p>So that particular case,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why Francis said what he said there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not accurate.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>So the wrestler never, he didn&rsquo;t almost die.</p>
<p>He was no big deal at all for him.</p>
<p>And he said that to him.</p>
<p>I think, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I think something got mixed up in Francis&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>There was another case he must&rsquo;ve been like,</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t imagine he would bring that case up</p>
<p>and just like make it up, you know, cause like why?</p>
<p>But he, that was not at all,</p>
<p>like that was a pretty public case.</p>
<p>He had an interview with him, that wrestler,</p>
<p>he was just fine.</p>
<p>So that anecdotal case, I mean,</p>
<p>Francis should not have done that.</p>
<p>So if I have any, so I have a bunch of criticism</p>
<p>of how that went.</p>
<p>People who criticize that interview,</p>
<p>I feel like don&rsquo;t give enough respect</p>
<p>to the full range of things</p>
<p>that Francis Collins has done in his career.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an incredible scientist.</p>
<p>And I also think a really good human being.</p>
<p>But yes, that conversation was flawed in many ways.</p>
<p>And one of them was why,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to present some kind of critical,</p>
<p>like criticize Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>why bring up anecdotal evidence at all?</p>
<p>And if you do bring up anecdotal evidence,</p>
<p>which is not scientific, if you&rsquo;re a scientist,</p>
<p>you should not be using anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>If you do bring it up,</p>
<p>why bring up one that&rsquo;s first not true</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s not true?</p>
<p>So I know, pretend, so you don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>So yes, that would find another case where, exactly.</p>
<p>So the basic thing coming back</p>
<p>to Sanjay and Joe&rsquo;s conversation</p>
<p>was that Sanjay was trying to use statistical evidence</p>
<p>and Joe was using anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>And so I think that for Sanjay,</p>
<p>and there are all kinds of things where there are debates</p>
<p>where often the person who&rsquo;s better at debating</p>
<p>wins the debate regardless of the topic.</p>
<p>So I think what Sanjay could have done,</p>
<p>and Sanjay is such a smart guy,</p>
<p>is to say, well, that&rsquo;s an anecdote,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another anecdote.</p>
<p>And there are lots of different anecdotes.</p>
<p>And there certainly are people who have taken the vaccine</p>
<p>and have had problems that could reasonably be traced</p>
<p>to the vaccines.</p>
<p>And there certainly are lots of people, I would argue,</p>
<p>more people who&rsquo;ve not had the vaccine,</p>
<p>but who&rsquo;ve gotten COVID and have either died</p>
<p>or our hospitals are now full of people</p>
<p>who weren&rsquo;t vaccinated.</p>
<p>And in many ways, I mean, our emergency rooms</p>
<p>are full of unvaccinated people here in the United States.</p>
<p>So I think what Sanjay could have done,</p>
<p>but there was a conflict between wanting to kind of</p>
<p>win the debate and wanting to take the temperature down.</p>
<p>And what he could have done is to say,</p>
<p>well, here&rsquo;s an anecdote, I have a counter anecdote</p>
<p>and we can go on all day,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s what the statistics show.</p>
<p>And I think that was the thing.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a healthy conversation.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t, I mean, there are a lot of people</p>
<p>who are afraid of the vaccine.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who don&rsquo;t trust</p>
<p>the scientific establishment</p>
<p>and lots of them have good reason.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not just people think of like Trump Republicans.</p>
<p>There are lots of people in the African American community</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve had a historical terrible experience</p>
<p>with the Tuskegee and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t trust the messages</p>
<p>that were being delivered.</p>
<p>I live in New York City and we had a piece</p>
<p>in the New York Times where in the earliest days</p>
<p>of the vaccines, there was this big movement,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make sure that the poorest people in the city</p>
<p>have first access to the vaccines</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the ones, they have higher density</p>
<p>in their homes, they&rsquo;re relying on public transport.</p>
<p>So there was this whole liberal effort.</p>
<p>And then in the black community in New York,</p>
<p>according to the New York Times,</p>
<p>there was very low acceptance of the vaccines</p>
<p>and they interviewed people in that article.</p>
<p>And they said, well, if the white people want us</p>
<p>to have it first, there must be something wrong with it.</p>
<p>They must be doing something.</p>
<p>And so we have to listen to each other.</p>
<p>Like I would never, I have a disrespect for everybody.</p>
<p>And if somebody is cautious about the vaccine</p>
<p>for themselves or for their children,</p>
<p>we have to listen to them.</p>
<p>At the same time, public health</p>
<p>is about creating public health.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no doubt, I think Joe was absolutely right</p>
<p>that older people, obese people are at greater risk</p>
<p>for being harmed or killed by COVID 19</p>
<p>than young, healthy people.</p>
<p>But by everybody getting vaccinated,</p>
<p>we reduce the risk to everybody else.</p>
<p>And so I feel like, like with everything,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the individual benefit argument</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the community argument.</p>
<p>And I absolutely think our community.</p>
<p>Expressing that clearly that there&rsquo;s a difference between</p>
<p>the individual health and freedoms</p>
<p>and the community health and freedoms</p>
<p>and steel manning each side of this.</p>
<p>One of the problems that people don&rsquo;t do enough of</p>
<p>is be able to, so how do you steel man an argument?</p>
<p>You describe that argument in the best possible way.</p>
<p>You have to first understand that argument.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the noncontroversial thing like Flat Earth.</p>
<p>Like most people, most colleagues of mine at MIT</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even read about like the full argument</p>
<p>that the Flat Earthers make.</p>
<p>I feel it&rsquo;s disingenuous for people in the physics community</p>
<p>to roll their eyes at Flat Earthers</p>
<p>if they haven&rsquo;t read their arguments.</p>
<p>You should feel bad that you didn&rsquo;t read their arguments.</p>
<p>And like it&rsquo;s the rolling of the eyes that&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t read it.</p>
<p>Your intuition says that these are a bunch of crazy people.</p>
<p>Okay, but you haven&rsquo;t earned the right to roll your eyes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve earned your right to maybe not read it,</p>
<p>but then don&rsquo;t have an opinion.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t roll your eyes, don&rsquo;t do any of that dismissive stuff.</p>
<p>And the same thing in the scientific community</p>
<p>around COVID and so on, there&rsquo;s often this kind of saying,</p>
<p>oh God, that&rsquo;s conspiracy theories, that&rsquo;s misinformation</p>
<p>without actually looking into what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t looked into what they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>then don&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re a scientific leader and the communicator,</p>
<p>you need to look into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that much effort.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>And I think that humility,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a constant theme of your podcasts and I love that.</p>
<p>And so after the conversation debate,</p>
<p>whatever it was between Sanjay and Joe,</p>
<p>I reached out on Twitter to someone I&rsquo;ve never met</p>
<p>in person, but I&rsquo;m in touch privately</p>
<p>to a guy named Daniel Griffin,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a professor at Columbia Medical School</p>
<p>and just so smart there.</p>
<p>He gives regular updates on COVID 19</p>
<p>on a thing called TWIV this week in virology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a critic of TWIV for its coverage of origins.</p>
<p>But on this issue, I&rsquo;m just having regular updates.</p>
<p>Daniel is great.</p>
<p>And so I said to him,</p>
<p>I said, why don&rsquo;t we have an honest process</p>
<p>to get the people who are raising concerns</p>
<p>about the vaccines in their own words</p>
<p>to raise what are their concerns?</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s do our best job of saying,</p>
<p>well, here are these concerns.</p>
<p>And then here is our evidence making a counterclaim</p>
<p>and here are links to if you want to look at the studies</p>
<p>upon which these claims are made, here they are.</p>
<p>And Daniel, who&rsquo;s incredibly busy,</p>
<p>I mean, he reads every, I mean, it seems every paper</p>
<p>that comes out every week and it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>But he sent me a link to the CDC Q&amp;A page</p>
<p>on the CDC website.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t that, it was people who were,</p>
<p>I mean, it was written by people like me</p>
<p>who were convinced in the benefit of these vaccines.</p>
<p>So the questions were framed, they were kind of like,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t really the framing</p>
<p>of the people with the concerns.</p>
<p>They were framing of people</p>
<p>who were just kind of imagining something else.</p>
<p>I mean, you always talk about kind of humility</p>
<p>and active listening.</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t mean, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t stand for something.</p>
<p>Like I certainly am a strong proponent of vaccines</p>
<p>and masks and all of those things.</p>
<p>But if we don&rsquo;t hear other people,</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t let them hear their voice in the conversation,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s just saying, well, you may think this</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s wrong, the argument may be right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll just never break through.</p>
<p>By the way, my interpretation of Joe and Sanjay,</p>
<p>I listened to that conversation without looking at Twitter</p>
<p>or the internet and I thought that was a great conversation</p>
<p>and I thought Sanjay actually really succeeded</p>
<p>in bringing the temperature down.</p>
<p>To me, the goal was bringing the temperature down.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even think of it as a debate.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, cool, this isn&rsquo;t gonna be some weird,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like two friendly people talking.</p>
<p>And then I look at the internet</p>
<p>and then the internet says, Joe Rogan slammed Sanjay</p>
<p>like as if it was a heated debate that Joe won.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, all right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really the temperature being brought down.</p>
<p>Real conversation between two humans.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t really a debate.</p>
<p>It was just a conversation and that was a success.</p>
<p>I definitely think it was a success,</p>
<p>but I also felt that a takeaway,</p>
<p>and again, because this is something that I don&rsquo;t agree with,</p>
<p>even though I have great, as I&rsquo;ve said, respect for Joe,</p>
<p>I think a reasonable person listening to that conversation</p>
<p>would come away with the conclusion</p>
<p>that all in all these vaccines are a good thing,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re young and healthy, you probably don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>And I just felt that there was a stronger case to be made,</p>
<p>even though Sanjay made it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that Sanjay didn&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>It was just that in the flow of that conversation,</p>
<p>I felt that the case for the vaccines</p>
<p>and the vaccines both as an individual choice</p>
<p>and then certainly again, as I said before,</p>
<p>I think that while people can be afraid of the vaccines,</p>
<p>the virus itself is much scarier</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re seeing it now in real time</p>
<p>with these variations and variants.</p>
<p>I just felt that that was kind of the rough takeaway</p>
<p>from that conversation.</p>
<p>And I felt that Sanjay, again, whom I love,</p>
<p>I felt it could have made his case a little bit stronger.</p>
<p>So the thing he succeeded is he didn&rsquo;t come off</p>
<p>as like a science expert looking down at everybody,</p>
<p>talking down to everybody.</p>
<p>So he succeeded in that, which is very respectful.</p>
<p>But I also think sort of making the case</p>
<p>for taking the vaccine when you&rsquo;re a young, healthy person,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sitting across from Joe Rogan</p>
<p>is like a high difficulty on the video game level.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s difficult to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure. It&rsquo;s difficult to do.</p>
<p>And also it&rsquo;s difficult to do</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not as simple as like, look at the data.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of data to go through here.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a lot of non data stuff,</p>
<p>like the fact that, first of all,</p>
<p>questioning the sources of the data,</p>
<p>the quality of the data,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s also disappointing about COVID</p>
<p>is that the quality of the data is not great.</p>
<p>But also questioning all the motivations</p>
<p>of the different parties involved,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s major organizations</p>
<p>that developed the vaccine,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s major institutions like NIH or NIAID</p>
<p>that are sort of communicating to us about the vaccine,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the CDC and the WHO,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the Biden or the Trump administration,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s China and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>you have to, that&rsquo;s part of the conversation here.</p>
<p>I mean, vaccination is not just a public health tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a tool for a government</p>
<p>to gain more control over the populace.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s a lot of truth to that too.</p>
<p>Things that have a lot of benefit</p>
<p>can also be used as a Trojan horse</p>
<p>to increase bureaucracy and control.</p>
<p>But that has to be on the table for a conversation.</p>
<p>I think it has to be on the conversation.</p>
<p>But your parents, when they were in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and here in the United States,</p>
<p>and actually it was a big collaboration</p>
<p>between US and Soviet Union,</p>
<p>when the polio vaccine came out,</p>
<p>there were people all around the world</p>
<p>who had a different life trajectory,</p>
<p>no longer living in fear.</p>
<p>And all of these people who were paralyzed</p>
<p>or killed from polio, smallpox has been eradicated.</p>
<p>It was one of the great successes in human history.</p>
<p>And while it for sure is true that you could imagine</p>
<p>some kind of fraudulent vaccination effort,</p>
<p>but here I genuinely think,</p>
<p>I mean, whatever the number, 15 million, 16 million</p>
<p>is the economist number of dead from COVID 19,</p>
<p>many, many, many more people would be dead</p>
<p>but for these vaccines.</p>
<p>And so I get that any activity</p>
<p>that needs to be coordinated by a central government</p>
<p>has the potential to increase bureaucracy</p>
<p>and increase control.</p>
<p>But there are certain things that central governments do,</p>
<p>like the development, particularly these mRNA vaccines,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s purely a US government victory.</p>
<p>I mean, it was huge DARPA funding</p>
<p>and then the National Institute for Allergy</p>
<p>and Infectious Disease, NIH funding.</p>
<p>I mean, this was a public private partnership throughout</p>
<p>and that we got a working vaccine 11 months was a miracle.</p>
<p>So I, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not purely a victory.</p>
<p>Again, you have to be open minded.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you here playing a bit of devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>but the people who discuss any viral drugs</p>
<p>like ivermectin and other alternatives</p>
<p>would say that the extreme focus on the vaccine</p>
<p>distracted us from considering other possibilities.</p>
<p>And saying that this is purely a success</p>
<p>is distracting from the story</p>
<p>that there could have been other solutions.</p>
<p>So yes, it&rsquo;s a huge success</p>
<p>that the vaccine was developed so quickly</p>
<p>and surprisingly way more effective than it was hoped for.</p>
<p>But there could have been other solutions</p>
<p>and they completely distracted from us from that.</p>
<p>In fact, it distracted us from looking into a bunch of things</p>
<p>like the lab leak.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not a pure victory.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of people that criticize</p>
<p>the overreach of government and all of this.</p>
<p>That one of the things that makes the United States great</p>
<p>is the individualism and the hesitancy to ideas of mandates.</p>
<p>Even if the mandates on mass will have a positive,</p>
<p>even strongly positive result,</p>
<p>many Americans will still say no.</p>
<p>Because in the long arc of history,</p>
<p>saying no in that moment will actually lead</p>
<p>to a better country and a better world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a messed up aspect of America,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a beautiful part.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re skeptical even about good things.</p>
<p>I agree and certainly we should all be cautious</p>
<p>about government overreach, absolutely.</p>
<p>And it happens in all kinds of scenarios</p>
<p>with incarceration with a thousand things.</p>
<p>And we also should be afraid of government underreach</p>
<p>that if there is a problem that could be solved</p>
<p>by governments and that&rsquo;s why we have governments</p>
<p>in the first place is that there&rsquo;s just certain things</p>
<p>that individuals can&rsquo;t do on their own.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we pool our resources</p>
<p>and we, in some ways, sacrifice our rights</p>
<p>for this common thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t have, hopefully,</p>
<p>people, murderers marauding</p>
<p>or people driving 200 miles down the street.</p>
<p>We have a process for arriving at a set of common rules.</p>
<p>And so, while I fully agree that we need to respect</p>
<p>and we need to listen, we need to find that right balance.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve raised the magic I word, ivermectin.</p>
<p>And so, an ivermectin, like my view has always been,</p>
<p>ivermectin could be effective, it could not be effective.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s study it through a full process.</p>
<p>And when you had Francis Collins with you,</p>
<p>even while he was making up stories about this wrestler,</p>
<p>he was saying, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But he was saying that they&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>a full randomized highest level trial of ivermectin.</p>
<p>And if ivermectin works,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s another tool in our toolbox.</p>
<p>And I think we should.</p>
<p>And I think that Sanjay was absolutely correct</p>
<p>to concede the point to Joe,</p>
<p>that it was disingenuous for people,</p>
<p>including people on CNN,</p>
<p>to say that ivermectin is for livestock.</p>
<p>And so, I definitely think that we have to,</p>
<p>like we have to have some kind of process</p>
<p>that allows us to come together.</p>
<p>And I totally agree that the great strength of America</p>
<p>is that we empower individuals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the history of our frontier mentality in our country.</p>
<p>So we, I 100% agree that we have to allow that,</p>
<p>even if sometimes it creates messy processes</p>
<p>and uncomfortable feelings and all those sorts of things.</p>
<p>You are an ultra marathon runner.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What are you running from?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the right, it&rsquo;s the funny thing is,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m an ultra marathoner and I&rsquo;ve done 13 Ironmans.</p>
<p>And people say, oh my God, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>13 Ironmans.</p>
<p>And what I always say, no, one Ironman is impressive.</p>
<p>13 Ironmans, there&rsquo;s something effing wrong with you.</p>
<p>We just need to figure out what it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some demons you&rsquo;re trying to work through.</p>
<p>I mean, well, you&rsquo;re doing the work though.</p>
<p>Most people just kind of let the demons sit in the attic.</p>
<p>No, what have you learned about yourself,</p>
<p>about your mind, about your body, about life,</p>
<p>from taking your body limit in that kind of way</p>
<p>to running those kinds of distances?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And I know that you are also kind of exploring</p>
<p>the limits of the physical.</p>
<p>And so for me in doing the Ironmans and the ultra marathons,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always the same kind of lesson,</p>
<p>which is just when you think you have nothing left,</p>
<p>you actually have a ton left.</p>
<p>There are a lot of resources that are there</p>
<p>if you call on them.</p>
<p>And the ability to call on them has to be cultivated.</p>
<p>And so for me, especially in the Ironman,</p>
<p>and Ironman in many ways is harder than the ultra marathons</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll be at, I mean, it&rsquo;s 140 miles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be at a 100 mile, 120, having done the swim</p>
<p>and then the bike and I&rsquo;ll be whatever,</p>
<p>six miles into the run.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll think, I feel like shit.</p>
<p>I have nothing left.</p>
<p>How am I possibly gonna run 20 miles more?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always more.</p>
<p>And I think that for me, these extreme sports</p>
<p>are my process of exploring what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And I feel like it applies in so many different areas</p>
<p>of life where you&rsquo;re kind of pushing</p>
<p>and it feels like the limit.</p>
<p>And one of my friend of mine,</p>
<p>who I just have so much respect for,</p>
<p>who actually be a great guest</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t already interviewed him is Charlie Angle.</p>
<p>And Charlie, he was a drug addict.</p>
<p>He was in prison, his life was total shit.</p>
<p>And somehow, and I can&rsquo;t remember the full story,</p>
<p>he just started running around the prison yard.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like Forrest Gump.</p>
<p>And he just kept running and running.</p>
<p>And then he got out of prison and he kept running</p>
<p>and he started doing ultra marathons,</p>
<p>started inspiring all these other people.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s written all these books.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we just spoke a few months ago</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s planning on running from the Dead Sea</p>
<p>to somehow to the top of Mount Everest,</p>
<p>from the lowest point to the highest point on earth.</p>
<p>And I said, well, why are you stopping there?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you get whatever camera in</p>
<p>and go down to the lowest part of the ocean,</p>
<p>go to the lowest part of the ocean</p>
<p>and then talk to Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos</p>
<p>and go to the kind of the highest place</p>
<p>than the stratosphere you can get.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s this thing of possibility.</p>
<p>And I just feel like so many of us and myself included,</p>
<p>we get stuck in a sense of what we think is our range.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re not careful, that can become our range.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why for me in all of life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about like we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>challenging the limits, challenging assumptions,</p>
<p>challenging ourselves and hopefully,</p>
<p>we do it in a way that kind of doesn&rsquo;t hurt anybody.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m at the Ironman, they have all these little kids</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll have these little shirts</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll say like, my dad is a hero</p>
<p>and have the little Ironman logo.</p>
<p>And I wanna say, it&rsquo;s like, no,</p>
<p>your dad is actually a narcissistic dick</p>
<p>who goes on eight mile bike rides every Sunday</p>
<p>rather than spend time with you.</p>
<p>And so we shouldn&rsquo;t hurt anybody.</p>
<p>But for me, and also I just find it very enjoyable</p>
<p>and I hope I&rsquo;m not disclosing too much</p>
<p>about our conversation before we went live</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re doing so many different things</p>
<p>with running and your martial arts.</p>
<p>And I encouraged you to do ultra marathons</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many great ones in Texas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually surprisingly a very enjoyable way</p>
<p>to spend a day.</p>
<p>Like how would you recommend?</p>
<p>So yeah, for people who might not know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never actually even run a marathon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve run 22 miles in one time at most.</p>
<p>I did a four by four by 48 challenge with David Goggins</p>
<p>where you run four miles every four hours.</p>
<p>Is it different as less to do with the distance</p>
<p>and more to do with the sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a first time ultra marathon</p>
<p>or like me trying to run 50 or more miles</p>
<p>or for anybody else interested</p>
<p>in this kind of exploration of their range?</p>
<p>What I always tell is the same advice is register.</p>
<p>Pick your timeline of when you think you can be ready.</p>
<p>Make it, depending on where you are now,</p>
<p>make it six months, make a year,</p>
<p>and then register for the race.</p>
<p>And then once you&rsquo;re registered,</p>
<p>just work back from there, what&rsquo;s it going to take?</p>
<p>But one of the things for people who are just getting going,</p>
<p>you really do need to make sure</p>
<p>that your body is ready for it.</p>
<p>And so particularly, and particularly as we get older,</p>
<p>strengthening is really important.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll do a plug for my brother, Jordan Metzl.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a doctor at hospital for special surgery,</p>
<p>but his whole thing is functional strength.</p>
<p>And so, and people know about,</p>
<p>and you can actually even go to his website.</p>
<p>You can just Google Jordan Metzl Iron Strength,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all about like burpees</p>
<p>and just building your muscular strength</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t get injured as you increase.</p>
<p>And then just increase your mileage with,</p>
<p>in some steady way, make sure that you take rest days</p>
<p>and listen to your body because people like you</p>
<p>who are just very kind of mind over matter,</p>
<p>like you were telling me before about you have an injury,</p>
<p>but you kind of run a little bit differently.</p>
<p>And we need to listen to our bodies</p>
<p>because our bodies are communicating.</p>
<p>But I think it was kind of little by little magic is possible.</p>
<p>And what I will say is,</p>
<p>and I also have done lots and lots of marathons,</p>
<p>and I always tell people that the ultra marathons,</p>
<p>at least the ones that I do,</p>
<p>and I shouldn&rsquo;t misrepresent myself.</p>
<p>I mean, there are people who do 500 mile races.</p>
<p>The ones that I do are 50K mountain trail runs,</p>
<p>which is 32 miles.</p>
<p>So I do the kind of the easier side of ultras,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually much easier than a marathon</p>
<p>because some of the mountain ones,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s so steep that you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you have to walk it</p>
<p>because walking is faster than running.</p>
<p>And every four or five miles in the supported races,</p>
<p>you stop and eat blintzes and foiled potatoes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>But as I started to tell you before we went live,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve done for lots of years,</p>
<p>these 50K mountain trail runs,</p>
<p>and I was going to Taiwan a number of years ago</p>
<p>for something else.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun</p>
<p>to do an ultra marathon in Taiwan?</p>
<p>I looked and that the weekend after my visit,</p>
<p>there was a marathon.</p>
<p>It was called the,</p>
<p>every ultra marathon, it was called the Taiwan Beast.</p>
<p>And I figured, oh, beasts, what are they talking about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 50K mountain trail,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done a million of them.</p>
<p>And then I went to register.</p>
<p>And then as part of registration,</p>
<p>they said, you need to have all of this equipment.</p>
<p>And it was all this like wilderness survival equipment.</p>
<p>And I was thinking, God, these Taiwanese,</p>
<p>but what a bunch of wimps.</p>
<p>You have to carry, give me a break, 50K mountain trail.</p>
<p>So I get there and the race starts</p>
<p>at like 4.30 in the morning in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>And you have to wear headlamps</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s carrying all this stuff.</p>
<p>And you kind of go running out into the rainforest.</p>
<p>It was the hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done in my,</p>
<p>it took 19 hours.</p>
<p>There were maybe 15 cliff faces, like a real cliff.</p>
<p>And somebody had dangled like a little piece of string.</p>
<p>And so you had to hold onto the string with one hand</p>
<p>while it was in the pouring rain, climb up these cliffs.</p>
<p>There were maybe 20 river crossings,</p>
<p>but not just like a little stream, like a torrential river.</p>
<p>There were some things where it was so steep</p>
<p>that everyone was just climbing up</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;d slide all the way down and climb up.</p>
<p>And there were people who I met on the way out there</p>
<p>who were saying, oh yeah,</p>
<p>I did the Sahara 500 kilometer race.</p>
<p>And those people were just sprawled out.</p>
<p>A lot of them didn&rsquo;t finish.</p>
<p>So that was the hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever.</p>
<p>So how do you get through something like that?</p>
<p>You just, one step at a time?</p>
<p>Was there, do you remember, is there a?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there a dark moments</p>
<p>or is it kind of all spread out thinly?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t really dark moments.</p>
<p>I mean, there was one thing where I&rsquo;d been running so long</p>
<p>I thought, well, I must almost be done.</p>
<p>And then I found out I had like 15 miles more.</p>
<p>But I guess with all of these things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the messages that we tell ourselves.</p>
<p>And so for me, it&rsquo;s like the message I always tell myself</p>
<p>is quitting isn&rsquo;t an option.</p>
<p>I mean, once in a while you kind of have to quit</p>
<p>if like, listen to the universe,</p>
<p>if whatever, you&rsquo;re gonna kill yourself or something.</p>
<p>But for me, it was just, whatever it takes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m stopping.</p>
<p>And if I have to go up this muddy hill 20 times</p>
<p>because I keep sliding, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a personality flaw.</p>
<p>Where does your love for chocolate come from?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And in both of my Joe Rogan interviews,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first question that he asked.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad that we&rsquo;ve gotten to that.</p>
<p>So one, I&rsquo;ve always loved chocolate.</p>
<p>And I call it like a secret, but now that I keep telling,</p>
<p>if you keep telling the same secret,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually no longer a secret,</p>
<p>that I have a secret, which is not secret</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m telling you on a podcast,</p>
<p>life as a chocolate shaman.</p>
<p>And so when I give keynotes at tech conferences,</p>
<p>I always say, I&rsquo;m happy to give a keynote,</p>
<p>but I want to lead a sacred cacao ceremony in the night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually, believe it or not,</p>
<p>the official chocolate shaman</p>
<p>of what used to be called exponential medicine,</p>
<p>which is part of Singularity University.</p>
<p>Now, my friend Daniel Kraft who runs it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be called NextMed.</p>
<p>And so, but I&rsquo;ll have to go back.</p>
<p>As I was going to Berlin a lot of years ago,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve always loved chocolate,</p>
<p>I was going to Berlin to give a keynote</p>
<p>at a big conference called TOA, Tech Open Air.</p>
<p>And so when I got there, the first night,</p>
<p>I was supposed to give a talk,</p>
<p>but there had been some mix up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d forgotten to reserve the room.</p>
<p>And so the talk got canceled.</p>
<p>And in the brochure, they had all these different events</p>
<p>around Berlin that you could go to.</p>
<p>And one of them was a cacao ceremony.</p>
<p>And so I went there and actually met somebody,</p>
<p>Viviana, who is still a friend,</p>
<p>but I met, going in there,</p>
<p>and there was this cacao ceremony.</p>
<p>These kind of hippie dudes.</p>
<p>And then everybody got the cacao.</p>
<p>And then they said, all right,</p>
<p>as they talked a little bit about the process,</p>
<p>and then they said, all right,</p>
<p>everyone just stand and kind of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to spin around in a circle for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>And so I spun around in the circle for like 10 minutes,</p>
<p>but then I had to leave</p>
<p>because I had to go to something else.</p>
<p>And so that, I thought that was that.</p>
<p>But then I saw Viviana the next day,</p>
<p>and I said, well, how did the cacao ceremony go?</p>
<p>And she showed me these pictures</p>
<p>of all of these people, mostly naked,</p>
<p>like it turned into chaos.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And it was like, oh, and so let me get this straight.</p>
<p>People drank chocolate,</p>
<p>then they spun around in a circle,</p>
<p>and something else happened.</p>
<p>And anyway, so then two days later,</p>
<p>I was invited to another cacao ceremony,</p>
<p>which was also actually part of this Toa.</p>
<p>And that was kind of more structured,</p>
<p>and it was more sane because it was part of this thing.</p>
<p>And at the end of that, I had this,</p>
<p>I thought one, the greatest thing ever,</p>
<p>a sacred cacao ceremony,</p>
<p>like you drink chocolate milk and everybody&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>And I love that idea because I&rsquo;ve never done drugs,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t drink.</p>
<p>But just part of it is because I think whatever,</p>
<p>like I was saying with the ultra running,</p>
<p>all of the possibilities are within us</p>
<p>if we can get out of our own way.</p>
<p>And then I thought, well, you know,</p>
<p>I think I can do a better job</p>
<p>than what I experienced in Berlin.</p>
<p>So I came back and I thought, all right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get accredited as a cacao shaman.</p>
<p>And this will shock you.</p>
<p>Because I know if you&rsquo;re gonna be like a rabbi</p>
<p>or a priest or something, there&rsquo;s some process.</p>
<p>But shockingly, there&rsquo;s no official process</p>
<p>to become a chocolate shaman.</p>
<p>And so I thought, all right, well, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna train myself.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m ready, I&rsquo;m gonna declare my chocolate shamanism.</p>
<p>So I started studying different things.</p>
<p>And when I was ready, I just said,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m a chocolate shaman, self declared.</p>
<p>Self declared.</p>
<p>And so, but I do these ceremonies</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done them at tech conferences.</p>
<p>I did one in Soho House in New York.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it at a place Rancho La Puerta in Mexico.</p>
<p>And every time it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>Because it just, if people are given a license to be free,</p>
<p>just to, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, and what I always say is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re here for a sacred cacao ceremony,</p>
<p>but the truth is there&rsquo;s no such thing as sacred cacao.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no sacred mountains</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no sacred people and there&rsquo;s no sacred plants.</p>
<p>Because nothing is sacred if we don&rsquo;t attribute,</p>
<p>ascribe sacredness to it.</p>
<p>But if we recognize that everything is sacred,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll live different lives.</p>
<p>And for the purpose of this ceremony,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just gonna say, all right,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna focus on this cacao,</p>
<p>which actually has been used ceremonially for 5,000 years.</p>
<p>It has all these wonderful properties.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just people who get that license</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re just free and people are dancing</p>
<p>and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Is the goal to celebrate life in general?</p>
<p>Is it to celebrate the senses, like taste?</p>
<p>Is it to celebrate yourself, each other?</p>
<p>What is there?</p>
<p>I think the core is gratitude and just appreciation.</p>
<p>All the experiences in life?</p>
<p>Yeah, just of being alive,</p>
<p>of just living in this sacred world</p>
<p>where we have all these things</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t even pay any attention to.</p>
<p>My friend, A.J. Jacobs, he had a wonderful book</p>
<p>that I use the spirit of it in the ceremonies,</p>
<p>not the exactly, but he was in a restaurant in New York,</p>
<p>a coffee shop, and his child said,</p>
<p>hey, where does the coffee come from?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like a wonderful big thinker.</p>
<p>And he started really answering that question.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s where the beans come from,</p>
<p>but how did the beans get here</p>
<p>and who painted the yellow line on the street</p>
<p>so the truck didn&rsquo;t crash and who made the cup?</p>
<p>And he spent a year making a full spreadsheet</p>
<p>of all of the people who in one way or another</p>
<p>played some role in that one cup of coffee.</p>
<p>And he traveled all around the world thanking them.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, thank you for painting</p>
<p>the yellow line on the road.</p>
<p>And so for me with the cacao, part of when I do</p>
<p>these ceremonies is just to say like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re drinking this cacao, but there&rsquo;s a person</p>
<p>who planted the seed, there&rsquo;s a person</p>
<p>who watered the plant, there&rsquo;s a person,</p>
<p>and I just think that level of awareness,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s true with anything.</p>
<p>Like you have in front of you a stuffed hedgehog, so.</p>
<p>Somebody made that.</p>
<p>I love it, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But like, if we just said, all right,</p>
<p>where does this stuffed hedgehog come from?</p>
<p>We would have a full story of globalization,</p>
<p>of the interconnection of people all around the world</p>
<p>doing all sorts of things of human imagination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beyond our capacity and our daily,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d go insane if every day,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re speaking into a microphone,</p>
<p>well, what are the hundreds of years of technology</p>
<p>that make this possible?</p>
<p>But if just once in a while, we just focus on one thing</p>
<p>and say, this thing is sacred.</p>
<p>And because I&rsquo;m recognizing that</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m having an appreciation for the world around me,</p>
<p>it just kind of makes my life feel more sacred.</p>
<p>It makes me recognize my connection to others.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the gist of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny, I often look at</p>
<p>things in this world and moments and just am in awe</p>
<p>of the full</p>
<p>universe that brought that to be.</p>
<p>In a similar way as you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t as often think about exactly what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>which is the number of people behind every little thing</p>
<p>we get to enjoy.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, this hedgehog, this microphone,</p>
<p>like directly, like thousands of people involved.</p>
<p>Millions.</p>
<p>And then indirectly, it&rsquo;s millions.</p>
<p>Like, and they&rsquo;re all like this microphone</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s like artists, essentially,</p>
<p>like people who made it their life&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>all the costs, like from the factories to the manufacturer,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s families that the production of this microphone</p>
<p>and this hedgehog are fed because of the skill</p>
<p>of this human that helped contribute to that development.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And like Isaac Newton and John von Neumann</p>
<p>are in this microphone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re standing on the shoulders of giants</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re standing on their shoulders.</p>
<p>And somebody will be standing on ours.</p>
<p>You mentioned One Shared World, what is it?</p>
<p>Well, thanks for asking.</p>
<p>And by the way, what I will say is the people</p>
<p>who are listening, this is so incredible</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so thrilled to have this kind of long conversation.</p>
<p>Hello, person who&rsquo;s listening past the five hour mark.</p>
<p>Thanks, mom.</p>
<p>I salute you.</p>
<p>Somebody was like sleeping for the first four hours</p>
<p>and just woke up.</p>
<p>Now&rsquo;s the good stuff, I&rsquo;ve been saving it.</p>
<p>But, and I have to say that so much of our lives</p>
<p>is forced into these short bursts</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m just so appreciative to have the chance</p>
<p>to have this conversation.</p>
<p>So thank you for that.</p>
<p>Some people would say five hours is short, so.</p>
<p>You know, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>And yeah, that&rsquo;s what my girlfriend says.</p>
<p>Like if I was like captured and tortured</p>
<p>and they were gonna interrogate me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like at the end they&rsquo;d say, all right.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re sick of this guy, we quit.</p>
<p>Let him go.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So background on One Shared World.</p>
<p>I mentioned I&rsquo;m on a faculty for Singularity University.</p>
<p>In the earliest days of the pandemic,</p>
<p>I was invited to give a talk on whether the tools</p>
<p>of the genetics and biotech revolutions</p>
<p>were a match for the outbreak.</p>
<p>And my view was then as now</p>
<p>that the answer to that question is yes.</p>
<p>But I woke up that morning</p>
<p>and I felt that that wasn&rsquo;t the most important talk</p>
<p>that I could give.</p>
<p>There was something else that was more pressing for me.</p>
<p>And that was the realization,</p>
<p>they were asking the question,</p>
<p>well, why weren&rsquo;t we prepared for this pandemic?</p>
<p>Because we could have been, we weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And why can&rsquo;t, and because of that,</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t we respond adequately to this outbreak?</p>
<p>And then there was the thing, well,</p>
<p>if we, even if we respond somehow miraculously</p>
<p>overcome this pandemic, it&rsquo;s a pyrrhic victory</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t prepare ourselves to respond</p>
<p>to the broader category of pandemics,</p>
<p>particularly as we enter the age of synthetic biology.</p>
<p>But if somehow miraculously we solve that problem,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t solve the problem of climate change,</p>
<p>well, kind of who cares?</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have a pandemic,</p>
<p>but we wiped everybody out from climate change.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just say, you get where this is going,</p>
<p>that we organize ourselves and we solve climate change.</p>
<p>And then we have a nuclear war</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s, particularly China now,</p>
<p>but US, the former Soviet Union</p>
<p>are building all these nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Who cares that we solved climate change</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all gone anyway.</p>
<p>And the meta category, bringing all of those things together</p>
<p>was this mismatch between the increasingly global</p>
<p>and shared nature of the biggest challenges that we face</p>
<p>and our inability to solve that entire category of problems.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a historical issue,</p>
<p>which is that prior to the 30 Years War in the 17th century,</p>
<p>we had all these different kinds of sovereignty</p>
<p>and religious and different kinds</p>
<p>of organizational principles and everybody got in this war.</p>
<p>And in this series of treaties</p>
<p>that together are called the Peace of Westphalia,</p>
<p>the framework for the modern,</p>
<p>what we now understand as the modern nation state was laid.</p>
<p>And then through colonialism and other means</p>
<p>that idea of a state is what it is today,</p>
<p>spread throughout the world.</p>
<p>Then through particularly the late 19th</p>
<p>and early 20th century,</p>
<p>we realized how unstable that system was</p>
<p>because you always had these jockeying</p>
<p>between sovereign states and some were rising</p>
<p>and some were falling and you ended up in war.</p>
<p>And that was the genius of the generations</p>
<p>who came together in 1945 in San Francisco</p>
<p>and the planning had even started before then,</p>
<p>who said, well, we can&rsquo;t just have that world,</p>
<p>we need to have an overlay.</p>
<p>And we talked about the UN and the WHO</p>
<p>of systems which transcend our national sovereignties.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get rid of them, but they transcend them</p>
<p>so we can solve this category of problems.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re now reaching a point where our reach as humans,</p>
<p>even individually, but collectively is so great</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a mismatch between, as I said,</p>
<p>the nature of the problems</p>
<p>and the ability to solve those problems.</p>
<p>And unless we can address</p>
<p>that broader global collective action problem,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to extinct ourselves.</p>
<p>And we see these different, what I call verticals,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s climate change</p>
<p>or trying to prevent a nuclear weapons proliferation</p>
<p>or anything else, but none of those can succeed.</p>
<p>And frankly, it doesn&rsquo;t even matter if one succeeds</p>
<p>because all of them have the potential</p>
<p>to lead to extinction level events.</p>
<p>So I gave that talk and that talk went viral.</p>
<p>I stayed up all night the next night and I drafted,</p>
<p>I think it was like an insanity,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of us were manic</p>
<p>in those early days of the pandemics</p>
<p>wanting to do something.</p>
<p>And so I stayed up all night and I drafted</p>
<p>what I called a declaration of global interdependence.</p>
<p>And I posted that on my website, my jamiemuscle.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>And that went viral.</p>
<p>And so then I called a meeting just on the people</p>
<p>on my personal email list.</p>
<p>And so we had people from 25 countries.</p>
<p>There were all of these people</p>
<p>who were having the same thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something wrong in the world.</p>
<p>They wanted to be part of a process of fixing it.</p>
<p>And so it was a crazy 35 days</p>
<p>where we broke into eight different working groups.</p>
<p>We had an amazing team that helped redraft</p>
<p>what became the declaration of interdependence,</p>
<p>which is now in 20 languages.</p>
<p>We laid out a work plan.</p>
<p>We founded this organization called One Shared World.</p>
<p>The URL is oneshared.world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just been this incredible journey.</p>
<p>We now have people who are participating</p>
<p>in one way or another from 120 different countries.</p>
<p>We have our public events exploring these issues,</p>
<p>get millions of viewers.</p>
<p>We have world leaders who are participating.</p>
<p>So the vision is to work on some of these big problems,</p>
<p>arbitrary number of problems that present themselves</p>
<p>in the world that face all of human civilization</p>
<p>and to be able to work together.</p>
<p>Well, that is, but there&rsquo;s a macro, a meta problem,</p>
<p>which is the global collective action problem.</p>
<p>And so the idea is even if we just focus on the verticals,</p>
<p>on the manifestations of the global collective action</p>
<p>problem, there&rsquo;ll be an infinite number of those things.</p>
<p>So while we work on those things,</p>
<p>like climate change, pandemics, WMD and other things,</p>
<p>we also have to ask the bigger questions</p>
<p>of why can&rsquo;t we solve this category of problems.</p>
<p>And the idea is, at least from my observation,</p>
<p>is that whenever big decisions are being made,</p>
<p>our national leaders and corporate leaders</p>
<p>are doing exactly what we&rsquo;ve hired them to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re maximizing for national interest,</p>
<p>even, or corporate interests,</p>
<p>even at the expense of everybody.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not that we wanna get rid of states.</p>
<p>States are essential in our world system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not we wanna undermine the UN,</p>
<p>which is also essential, but massively underperforming.</p>
<p>What we wanna do is to create</p>
<p>an empowered global constituency of people</p>
<p>who are demanding that their leaders at all levels</p>
<p>just do a better job of balancing</p>
<p>broader and narrower interests.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So this is more like a,</p>
<p>make it more symmetric in terms of power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s holding accountable the nations, the leaders.</p>
<p>The leaders.</p>
<p>The problem is nations are powerful.</p>
<p>We talked about China quite a bit.</p>
<p>How do you have an organizations of citizens of Earth</p>
<p>that can solve this collective problem</p>
<p>that holds China accountable?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult, because UN,</p>
<p>you could say a lot of things,</p>
<p>but to call it effective is hard.</p>
<p>You know, the internet almost is a kind of representation</p>
<p>of a collective force that holds nations accountable.</p>
<p>Not to give Twitter too much credit,</p>
<p>but social networks, broadly speaking.</p>
<p>So you have hope that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to build such collections of humans that resist China.</p>
<p>Not necessarily resist China,</p>
<p>but human, I mean, our cultures change over time.</p>
<p>I mean, the idea of the modern nation state</p>
<p>would not have made sense to people</p>
<p>in the 13th or 14th century.</p>
<p>The idea that became the United Nations.</p>
<p>I mean, it had its earliest days in the philosophies of Kant.</p>
<p>It took a long time for these ideas to be realized.</p>
<p>And so the idea, and we&rsquo;re far from successful.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve had little minor successes,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re very proud of.</p>
<p>We got the G20 leaders to incorporate the language</p>
<p>that we provided on addressing the needs</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable populations</p>
<p>into the final summit communique</p>
<p>from the G20 summit in Riyadh.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;re just on the verge</p>
<p>of having our language pat on the same issue,</p>
<p>ensuring everyone on earth has access to safe water,</p>
<p>basic sanitation and hygiene,</p>
<p>and essential pandemic protection by 2030</p>
<p>passed as part of a resolution in the United Nations</p>
<p>General Assembly.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re primarily, I mean, it&rsquo;s young people</p>
<p>all around the world.</p>
<p>And when I told them in the beginning of this year,</p>
<p>this is our goal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get the UN General Assembly</p>
<p>to pass a resolution with our language in it.</p>
<p>I mean, first, I think they all thought it was insane,</p>
<p>but they were too young and inexperienced</p>
<p>to know how insane it was.</p>
<p>But now these young people are just so excited</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s actually happening.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re trying to do is really to create a movement,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t feel that we need to do from scratch</p>
<p>because there are a lot of movements.</p>
<p>Like right now, we just had the Glasgow G20,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sorry, the Glasgow Climate Change Cup 26,</p>
<p>and then Greta Thunberg, who has a huge following</p>
<p>and who is an amazing young woman,</p>
<p>but I was kind of disappointed in what she said afterwards.</p>
<p>It became like a meme on Twitter, which was blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And basically it was like, blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>these old people are just screwing around</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a waste of time.</p>
<p>And definitely the critique is merited,</p>
<p>but young people have never been more empowered,</p>
<p>educated, connected than they are now.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve had a process with One Shared World</p>
<p>where we partnered with the Model United Nations,</p>
<p>the Aga Khan Foundation, the India Sanitation Coalition.</p>
<p>And what we did is say, all right, we have this goal,</p>
<p>water sanitation, hygiene, and pandemic protection</p>
<p>for everyone on earth by 2030.</p>
<p>And we had debates and consultations</p>
<p>using the Model UN framework all around the world</p>
<p>in multiple languages.</p>
<p>And we said, come up with a plan</p>
<p>for how this could be achieved.</p>
<p>And these brilliant young people in every country,</p>
<p>not every country, most countries,</p>
<p>they all contributed, then we had a plan.</p>
<p>Then I recruited friends of mine,</p>
<p>like my friend Hans Carrell in Sweden,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the former chief counsel of the whole United Nations,</p>
<p>and asked him and others to work with these young people</p>
<p>and representatives to turn that</p>
<p>into what looks exactly like a UN resolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just written by a bunch of kids all around the world.</p>
<p>We then sent that to every permanent representative,</p>
<p>every government representative at the UN.</p>
<p>And that was why working</p>
<p>with the German and Spanish governments,</p>
<p>why the language is centralized from that document</p>
<p>is about to pass the UN.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t mean that just passing</p>
<p>a UN General Assembly resolution changes anything,</p>
<p>but we think that there&rsquo;s a model of engaging people,</p>
<p>just like you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>these people who are outside</p>
<p>of the traditional power structures</p>
<p>and who want to have a voice.</p>
<p>But I think we need to give a little bit of structure</p>
<p>because just going, I&rsquo;m a big fan of Global Citizen,</p>
<p>but just going to a Global Citizen concert</p>
<p>and waving your iPhone back and forth</p>
<p>and tweeting about it isn&rsquo;t enough</p>
<p>to drive the kind of change that&rsquo;s required.</p>
<p>We need to come together, even in untraditional ways,</p>
<p>and articulate the change we want</p>
<p>and build popular movements to make that happen.</p>
<p>And popular means scale and movements at scale</p>
<p>that actually, at the individual level, do something</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s then magnified with the scale</p>
<p>to actually have significant impact.</p>
<p>I mean, at its best, you hear a lot of folks talk</p>
<p>about the various cryptocurrencies as possibly helping.</p>
<p>You have young people get involved</p>
<p>in challenging the power structures</p>
<p>by challenging the monetary system.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, some of it is number go up,</p>
<p>people get excited when they can make a little bit of money,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually almost like an entry point</p>
<p>because then you almost feel empowered.</p>
<p>And because of that, you start to think</p>
<p>about some of these philosophical ideas</p>
<p>that I, as a young person, have the power</p>
<p>to change the world.</p>
<p>All of these senior folks in the position of power,</p>
<p>they were, first of all, they were once young</p>
<p>and powerless like me.</p>
<p>And I could be part of the next generation</p>
<p>that makes a change.</p>
<p>Well, all the things I see that are wrong</p>
<p>with the world, I can make it better.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very true that the overly powerful nations</p>
<p>of the world could be a relic of the past.</p>
<p>That could be a 20th century and before idea</p>
<p>that was tried, created a lot of benefit,</p>
<p>but we also saw the problems with that kind of world,</p>
<p>extreme nationalism.</p>
<p>We see the benefits and the problems of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Arguably Cold War got us to the moon,</p>
<p>but there could be other, a lot of other different</p>
<p>mechanisms that inspired competition,</p>
<p>especially friendly competition between nations</p>
<p>versus adversarial competition that resulted</p>
<p>in the response to COVID, for example,</p>
<p>with China and the United States and Russia</p>
<p>and the secrecy, the censorship.</p>
<p>Yeah, and all the things that are basically</p>
<p>against the spirit of science</p>
<p>and resulted in the loss of trillions of dollars</p>
<p>and the cost of countless lives.</p>
<p>What gives you hope about the future, Jamie?</p>
<p>Well, one of the things, you mentioned cryptocurrency</p>
<p>and then as you know better than most,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s cryptocurrency and then underneath</p>
<p>the cryptocurrency, there&rsquo;s the blockchain</p>
<p>and the distributed ledger.</p>
<p>And then like we talked about, there are all these</p>
<p>young people who are able to connect with each other,</p>
<p>to organize in new ways.</p>
<p>And I work with these young people every single day</p>
<p>through One Shared World primarily,</p>
<p>but also other things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much optimism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much hope that I just have a lot of faith</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna figure something out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimist by nature.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we need to be blind</p>
<p>to the dangers.</p>
<p>There are very, very real dangers,</p>
<p>but just given half the chance, people wanna be good.</p>
<p>People want to do the right thing.</p>
<p>And I do believe that there&rsquo;s a role,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a role for the at least near term</p>
<p>for governments, but there&rsquo;s always a role for leadership.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m, I guess like a Gramscian in the sense</p>
<p>that I think that we need to create frameworks</p>
<p>and structures that allow leaders to emerge.</p>
<p>And we need to build norms so that the leaders who emerge</p>
<p>are leaders who call on us, inspire our best instincts</p>
<p>and not drive us toward our worst.</p>
<p>But I really see a lot of hope.</p>
<p>And when you say this all the time in your podcast,</p>
<p>and you may even be more optimistic to me</p>
<p>as you look at the darkest moments of human history</p>
<p>and see hope, but we&rsquo;re kind of a crazy, wonderful species.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, we figured out ways to slaughter each other</p>
<p>at scale, but we&rsquo;ve come up with these wonderful philosophies</p>
<p>about love and all of those things.</p>
<p>And yeah, maybe the Bonobos have some love</p>
<p>in their cultures, but this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re kind of a wonderful magical species.</p>
<p>And if we just can create enough of an infrastructure,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need to be and shouldn&rsquo;t be controlling,</p>
<p>just enough of an infrastructure</p>
<p>so that people are stakeholders,</p>
<p>feel like they&rsquo;re stakeholders</p>
<p>in contributing to a positive story,</p>
<p>I just really feel the sky is the limit.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s young right now,</p>
<p>somebody in high school, somebody in college</p>
<p>listening to you, you&rsquo;ve done a lot of incredible things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re respected by a lot of the elites.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re respected by the people.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re both able to sort of speak to all groups,</p>
<p>walk through the fire, like you mentioned</p>
<p>with the slab leak.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young kids today</p>
<p>that are inspired by your story?</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s one, there&rsquo;s lots of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honored if anybody is inspired,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the same thing as I said with the science</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s all about values.</p>
<p>The core of everything is knowing who you are.</p>
<p>And so yes, I mean, there&rsquo;s the broader thing</p>
<p>of follow your passions, a creative mind</p>
<p>and an inquisitive mind is the core of everything</p>
<p>because the knowledge base is constantly sharing.</p>
<p>So learning how to learn,</p>
<p>but at the core of everything is investing</p>
<p>in knowing who you are and what you stand for.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the way, that&rsquo;s the path</p>
<p>to leading a meaningful life, to contributing,</p>
<p>to not feeling alienated from your life as you get older.</p>
<p>And just like you live, it&rsquo;s an ongoing process</p>
<p>and we all make mistakes</p>
<p>and we all kind of travel down wrong paths</p>
<p>and just have some love for yourself</p>
<p>and recognize that just at every,</p>
<p>like I was saying with the Ironman,</p>
<p>just when you think there&rsquo;s no possibility</p>
<p>that you can go on, there&rsquo;s a 100% possibility</p>
<p>that you can go on.</p>
<p>And just when you think that nothing better</p>
<p>will happen to you, there&rsquo;s a 100% chance</p>
<p>that something better will happen to you.</p>
<p>You just gotta keep going.</p>
<p>Jamie, I&rsquo;ve been a fan of yours.</p>
<p>I think first heard you on Joe Rogan Experience,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been following your work,</p>
<p>your bold, fearless work with speaking about the lab leak</p>
<p>and everything you represent</p>
<p>from your brilliance to your kindness.</p>
<p>And the fact that you spent your valuable time with me today</p>
<p>and now I officially made you miss your flight.</p>
<p>And the fact that you said that</p>
<p>whether you were being nice or not,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that you will be okay with that</p>
<p>means the world to me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really honored that you spent your time with me today.</p>
<p>Well, really, it&rsquo;s been such a great pleasure</p>
<p>and thank you for creating a forum</p>
<p>to have these kinds of long conversations.</p>
<p>So I really enjoyed it and thank you.</p>
<p>And if anybody has now listened for,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it been, five and a half hours?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>Welcome to Five Hour Club.</p>
<p>Represent.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jamie.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Jamie Metzl.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you some words from Richard Feynman</p>
<p>about science and religion,</p>
<p>which I think also applies to science and geopolitics</p>
<p>because I believe scientists have the responsibility</p>
<p>to think broadly about the world</p>
<p>so that they may understand the bigger impact</p>
<p>of their inventions.</p>
<p>The quote goes like this,</p>
<p>In this age of specialization,</p>
<p>men who thoroughly know one field</p>
<p>are often incompetent to discuss another.</p>
<p>The old problems,</p>
<p>such as the relation of science and religion,</p>
<p>are still with us</p>
<p>and I believe present as difficult dilemmas as ever,</p>
<p>but they are not often publicly discussed</p>
<p>because of the limitations of specialization.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
