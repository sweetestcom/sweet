    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Emily Balcedis.</p>
<p>Dr. Balcedis is a professor of psychology</p>
<p>at New York University.</p>
<p>Her laboratory studies motivation, goal setting,</p>
<p>and tools for successful goal completion.</p>
<p>I learned about Dr. Balcedis&rsquo; work some years ago</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a vision scientist.</p>
<p>That is, I study the visual system.</p>
<p>And I heard about this incredible psychologist</p>
<p>at New York University who was studying how vision,</p>
<p>that is, how we visualize problems,</p>
<p>can predict whether or not</p>
<p>we will successfully overcome challenges</p>
<p>and how we strategize in order to set and meet goals.</p>
<p>And in 2020, I learned of Dr. Balcedis&rsquo; book,</p>
<p>which was written for the general public,</p>
<p>entitled, Clearer, Closer, Better,</p>
<p>How Successful People See the World.</p>
<p>And I read both the hard copy of the book</p>
<p>and listened to the audio book.</p>
<p>And I absolutely loved the material.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll learn directly from Dr. Balcedis today,</p>
<p>how people visualize a problem,</p>
<p>that is, whether or not they think of a goal or a problem</p>
<p>as residing at the top of a very steep hill</p>
<p>or on the top of a shallower hill,</p>
<p>or whether or not they visualize a goal or a problem</p>
<p>as far off in the distance</p>
<p>or closer to them in the distance,</p>
<p>visually, in their mind,</p>
<p>strongly dictates whether or not they will arrive</p>
<p>at the challenge of meeting a goal</p>
<p>or overcoming a problem with more energy or less energy.</p>
<p>Indeed, it dictates whether or not</p>
<p>they can push to immediate milestones</p>
<p>or whether or not they will think they have to overcome</p>
<p>the entire task all at once.</p>
<p>Basically, Dr. Balcedis&rsquo; work has discovered</p>
<p>that how we visualize a problem or a goal in our mind</p>
<p>has everything to do with how we lean into that goal,</p>
<p>whether or not we think of it as overwhelming or tractable,</p>
<p>whether or not we think that we can overcome that goal</p>
<p>and then it will lead to yet more possible rewards and goals</p>
<p>or whether or not we feel</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to arrive at the finish line</p>
<p>and then just be overwhelmed with fatigue.</p>
<p>In other words, how you visualize things in your mind,</p>
<p>and when I say visualize,</p>
<p>I mean literally how you visualize them as a visual problem</p>
<p>or a visual goal,</p>
<p>has everything to do with whether or not</p>
<p>you will be able to meet those goals</p>
<p>and whether or not they will lead to still greater goals</p>
<p>that you will be able to achieve.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is an especially important one, I believe,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to learn</p>
<p>about quality peer-reviewed science</p>
<p>from the expert in this field</p>
<p>of goal-setting motivation and pursuit.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re also going to learn an immense number</p>
<p>of practical tools that you can apply</p>
<p>toward your educational goals, your career goals,</p>
<p>relationship goals, goals of any sort.</p>
<p>By the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will be better equipped to set and achieve your goals.</p>
<p>Dr. Balcedas also shares with us her own experiences</p>
<p>of how to set, visualize, and achieve goals.</p>
<p>And she does that within the context of her role as a parent</p>
<p>as somebody navigating relationships of various kinds</p>
<p>and a demanding career.</p>
<p>So again, I think that you&rsquo;ll find the information today</p>
<p>to be both extremely academically grounded</p>
<p>in terms of research,</p>
<p>extremely practical, and realistic</p>
<p>in terms of how you might apply it in your own life.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Emily Balcedas.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for being here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my pleasure.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to this for a long time</p>
<p>because as a vision scientist</p>
<p>who is also very interested in real life tools</p>
<p>and goal setting and motivation,</p>
<p>your work lands squarely in the middle of those interests.</p>
<p>So just to kick things off,</p>
<p>you could tell us just a little bit</p>
<p>about the relationship between perception</p>
<p>and in particular how we see the world</p>
<p>and goal setting and goal retrieval.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vast landscape, but you&rsquo;re the expert.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll turn that over to you.</p>
<p>And then as time goes on,</p>
<p>I may have some additional questions</p>
<p>as it relates to different kinds of vision.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the deal with vision and motivation?</p>
<p>How do those two things link up?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>When psychologists ask people,</p>
<p>like, what are you doing to help make progress on your goals?</p>
<p>They say all kinds of things.</p>
<p>A couple of things always pop to the top,</p>
<p>which is, you know,</p>
<p>try to shock myself in encouraging ways,</p>
<p>you know, self-pep talks,</p>
<p>or I remind myself of how important it is to do this job,</p>
<p>or, you know, I&rsquo;ll put up Post-it notes around</p>
<p>to like constantly be nagging me about what I need to do.</p>
<p>So those are common tactics that people use.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;ll notice is that those are really effortful,</p>
<p>having to constantly remind yourself,</p>
<p>having to constantly talk to yourself,</p>
<p>having to create those Post-it notes,</p>
<p>remember to look at them.</p>
<p>All of that takes a lot of time and effort and commitment.</p>
<p>And so what a surprise that people burn out, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to work on a goal.</p>
<p>When you first set it,</p>
<p>you might make some initial progress,</p>
<p>but then eventually we get, you know,</p>
<p>not even to the halfway point,</p>
<p>but before things get real,</p>
<p>things are challenging and we fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think,</p>
<p>because those tactics that are our go-to strategies</p>
<p>are themselves a goal to maintain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you know, double-sided.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re putting so much on ourselves</p>
<p>to try to advance the thing</p>
<p>that we originally set out to accomplish.</p>
<p>So then I, you know, with my team,</p>
<p>I was trying to think of like,</p>
<p>well, what are strategies that don&rsquo;t require as much effort</p>
<p>that we can automate,</p>
<p>that we can take advantage of what&rsquo;s already happening</p>
<p>within ourselves, within our body, within our mind</p>
<p>that might overcome one of those challenges</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be easier, more automated.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when we started to land on the idea of vision.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>We look at the world without even thinking of it</p>
<p>for those of us that are sighted.</p>
<p>And we thought, you know what?</p>
<p>There are strategies that we can use</p>
<p>to look at the world in a different way</p>
<p>and that we can automate</p>
<p>that might help us to overcome some obstacles,</p>
<p>to make progress on our goals,</p>
<p>to maybe literally see opportunities</p>
<p>that we hadn&rsquo;t been able to see before.</p>
<p>So we started playing around</p>
<p>with the idea of visual illusions to see,</p>
<p>like, do people even know</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s other ways of seeing things around them?</p>
<p>Can we tweak that?</p>
<p>Or is there room for intervention?</p>
<p>Can we encourage people to take a new way of looking</p>
<p>to see things that they hadn&rsquo;t seen before?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what really opened us up</p>
<p>to trying to look at that intersection</p>
<p>between vision science and motivation science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And I always say in here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m strongly biased as a vision scientist</p>
<p>that vision is the dominant sense</p>
<p>by which we navigate the world and survive.</p>
<p>I love this idea of real world, real time access to vision.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certainly familiar with how goal setting</p>
<p>or post-its and magnets on refrigerators</p>
<p>can have an immediate impact,</p>
<p>but then over time they become</p>
<p>so part of the visual landscape that you overlook them.</p>
<p>And we know as vision scientists,</p>
<p>if something is stably in your environment,</p>
<p>eventually you&rsquo;re blind to it.</p>
<p>So that makes good sense.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve published a number of studies in this area,</p>
<p>but maybe you could highlight some of the more,</p>
<p>what you would consider important findings</p>
<p>in the area of how people can adjust their vision</p>
<p>in order to meet goals more quickly and more efficiently.</p>
<p>And perhaps also how we all arrive at goals</p>
<p>with different visual perceptions</p>
<p>and that in some way may divide us</p>
<p>into highly motivated and less motivated people.</p>
<p>In other words, what&rsquo;s the link</p>
<p>between vision and motivation</p>
<p>and how can we leverage that</p>
<p>in order to better reach our goals?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So, we started thinking about</p>
<p>what are the goals that are most important to people</p>
<p>that they struggle with the most?</p>
<p>So we asked hundreds, thousands of people</p>
<p>what their new year&rsquo;s resolutions are.</p>
<p>We looked to all the other polls</p>
<p>that do the same kind of work.</p>
<p>And regardless of where you look or who you ask</p>
<p>or when you ask it,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s number one goal</p>
<p>is something related to their health, right?</p>
<p>To lose weight, to exercise more,</p>
<p>to get out, get more steps for mental wellbeing,</p>
<p>physical wellbeing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the number one goal every January 1st.</p>
<p>So if we were able to accomplish that goal,</p>
<p>we think it would drop a little bit in the rankings,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>So we thought, I wonder if there&rsquo;s a way for us</p>
<p>to make some progress on that,</p>
<p>on helping people to exercise better, more often,</p>
<p>stick to it longer and make some progress there.</p>
<p>We know diets don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t diets work?</p>
<p>For the same reason that that self-talk doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>is that we go in it full bore, hardcore,</p>
<p>and it requires a major commitment</p>
<p>and effort to a lifestyle change.</p>
<p>So again, we were looking for something</p>
<p>that might be easier than that,</p>
<p>that could produce big, big payoff, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the golden ticket,</p>
<p>something that requires less effort for a bigger payoff.</p>
<p>So one of the first things that I did</p>
<p>was go over to Brooklyn to this old armory building.</p>
<p>It used to be a military armory space.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know that building.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful building now</p>
<p>that houses a lot of businesses, right?</p>
<p>With plants on the walls.</p>
<p>Is that the one?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s businesses.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of armories all around the boroughs here,</p>
<p>around New York City.</p>
<p>And the one in Brooklyn in particular is now YMCA, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a family YMCA</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s within this beautiful old red brick building</p>
<p>that used to be a military establishment long, long ago.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really cool is that one winter afternoon,</p>
<p>somebody had invited me, a physical therapist,</p>
<p>said, hey, you should come out</p>
<p>and check out what&rsquo;s happening here</p>
<p>with your interest in exercise</p>
<p>and trying to find new ways of helping people,</p>
<p>new tactics that they can add to their tool belt.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re gonna find some interesting people</p>
<p>that are working out there.</p>
<p>So I showed up, I look around,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s families, there&rsquo;s new moms,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kids that are,</p>
<p>mom&rsquo;s trying to get kids to burn off</p>
<p>some winter energy that they have.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that look like they&rsquo;re just there</p>
<p>for their, every couple of days going out for a run.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some people that look like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re training with a team.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s who this physical therapist introduced me to</p>
<p>is that it was the coach of this team.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of people that were sitting down</p>
<p>on the ground and I would be hard pressed to know</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the high school student that&rsquo;s in this group</p>
<p>and then who, as it turns out,</p>
<p>are some of the fastest runners in the world.</p>
<p>Like one of the people that was in the last Olympics</p>
<p>before I showed up won the gold medal for the 400 meter.</p>
<p>And from the looks of them,</p>
<p>I mean of course their bodies are in better shape than mine,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s nothing so pretentious,</p>
<p>of course they&rsquo;re not wearing their medals,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing pretentious about how they&rsquo;re walking around</p>
<p>or anything like that that would lead me to know</p>
<p>this person&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And they probably have some insight that I don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So once I got introduced to them</p>
<p>and knew who are these people that were part of this,</p>
<p>pretty elite training team that happened to work out</p>
<p>at this family gym, I had the chance to talk with them</p>
<p>about what strategies do you use.</p>
<p>Now I am not an elite runner and having recently had a baby,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really a runner right now at all,</p>
<p>but I thought when these people are running,</p>
<p>I bet they are like hyper aware of everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on in their surroundings.</p>
<p>Where are they relative to the competition?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening in their peripheral vision?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on on the side?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s behind them?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s in front of them?</p>
<p>They probably have this like master sense,</p>
<p>this master visual plan at any point in time</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what probably makes them elite.</p>
<p>So when I started asking them, is that the case?</p>
<p>Do you really pay attention to what&rsquo;s in your surroundings?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s behind you?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s on the side?</p>
<p>They said no, like all of them said no.</p>
<p>And sometimes when I do do that, it&rsquo;s a mistake.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>So that was surprising.</p>
<p>It totally went against my intuition about what they do</p>
<p>that likely contributes to their success.</p>
<p>What they said instead was that they are hyper focused.</p>
<p>They assume this narrowed focus of attention,</p>
<p>almost like a spotlight is shining on a target.</p>
<p>Now, when they&rsquo;re running a short distance,</p>
<p>that target might literally be the finish line,</p>
<p>the line that they&rsquo;re trying to cross.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a longer distance, they set sub goals,</p>
<p>like the person, the shorts on the person up ahead</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re trying to beat,</p>
<p>or they choose some sort of stable landmark,</p>
<p>like a sign that they would pass by.</p>
<p>And like a spotlight is shining just on that,</p>
<p>or like they have blinders on the sides of their face.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;re paying attention to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really narrowed scope of attention.</p>
<p>And that was a strategy that all of these elite athletes</p>
<p>said that they used, and those that were better</p>
<p>rather than slower were ones that used it more.</p>
<p>And I thought, oh, that&rsquo;s something we can play with.</p>
<p>They are elite and they are accomplished,</p>
<p>but that visual strategy isn&rsquo;t necessarily something</p>
<p>that you have to be in the perfect physical condition</p>
<p>to be able to adopt.</p>
<p>And so I wonder, can that help the rest of us</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t competing for an Olympic gold</p>
<p>and who have no chance of ever getting one,</p>
<p>but who want to exercise better,</p>
<p>have a better time doing it and maintain a commitment</p>
<p>to that exercise goal that they might have</p>
<p>that they might otherwise, by February or March,</p>
<p>be giving up on if they had said it</p>
<p>at the beginning of January.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really where the work started</p>
<p>was what you might call focus groups</p>
<p>or case studies of these incredible athletes.</p>
<p>And then we did other studies looking at people</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t Olympic athletes, but who are competitive</p>
<p>New York road runners, and how are they running in races?</p>
<p>And what we found is that those people</p>
<p>who have better pace, faster pace, better time,</p>
<p>they use that narrowed strategy more often</p>
<p>than this more expansive or open scope of attention.</p>
<p>And there seemed to be a correlation</p>
<p>between that better performance among a wider swath</p>
<p>of hundreds of runners who are doing it competitively,</p>
<p>but still could be like the person</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re sitting next to in the office or yourself, right?</p>
<p>And the more often that they did it,</p>
<p>and the more consistently they had adopted that,</p>
<p>that technique of the narrowed focus of attention,</p>
<p>it seemed that they were doing better in their runs.</p>
<p>So then we started thinking like,</p>
<p>okay, what about people who aren&rsquo;t competitive runners?</p>
<p>What about like my mom?</p>
<p>Can she do that?</p>
<p>Or me when I&rsquo;m trying to get back on the bandwagon</p>
<p>and exercise more?</p>
<p>Is this a tactic we can teach people?</p>
<p>The answer is yes.</p>
<p>You can tell people about what these Olympic athletes</p>
<p>are doing.</p>
<p>You can tell them about what the New York Road Runners</p>
<p>are doing.</p>
<p>And just using the same language</p>
<p>that I just used with you, right?</p>
<p>Imagine that there&rsquo;s a spotlight shining just on a target.</p>
<p>Choose something up ahead,</p>
<p>the stop sign two blocks up that you can just see.</p>
<p>And imagine that you have blinders on</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re not really paying attention</p>
<p>to the people that are passing by</p>
<p>or the buildings or the garbage cans</p>
<p>or the trucks that are on the road.</p>
<p>Tune those out and focus in on that target</p>
<p>until you hit it and then choose another one, right?</p>
<p>Sort of recalibrate, choose the next goal.</p>
<p>And so we would test like, can people do that?</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re listening right now,</p>
<p>you probably are imagining that experience too.</p>
<p>And the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Like I can imagine that.</p>
<p>I know what those words mean and I can do that.</p>
<p>And our work found that too, that people can do that.</p>
<p>We have them say out loud,</p>
<p>what is it that&rsquo;s captured your attention?</p>
<p>And of course, sometimes something in the periphery</p>
<p>like movement captures our gaze</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re pulled there for an instant,</p>
<p>but then we can refocus up again</p>
<p>and adopt that narrowed attention.</p>
<p>Now, one of the first studies that we did</p>
<p>was teach that strategy and juxtapose or compare it</p>
<p>against a group that we said, just look around naturally.</p>
<p>You might see that finish line up ahead</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s things on the periphery.</p>
<p>Whatever your eyes want to do,</p>
<p>whatever you think is gonna work best,</p>
<p>feel free to do that and tell us what you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>Then we gave them a finish line.</p>
<p>We created sort of an exercise</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s moderately challenging, but possible.</p>
<p>We put ankle weights on that accounted</p>
<p>for about 15% of their body weight,</p>
<p>told them to lift their knees up,</p>
<p>sort of high stepping to a finish line.</p>
<p>So this would be challenging for them to do,</p>
<p>but we said it&rsquo;s an indicator of overall health and fitness.</p>
<p>Some of these people had narrowed their focus of attention</p>
<p>and some were just looking more expansively or naturally.</p>
<p>And what we found is that those people that we trained,</p>
<p>just everyday normal people</p>
<p>doing this moderately challenging exercise,</p>
<p>they were able to move 27% faster.</p>
<p>They could do the exercise more quickly</p>
<p>and they said it hurt 17% less.</p>
<p>The exercise was exactly the same for all the people.</p>
<p>We set the weight and we set the distance.</p>
<p>It was in our lab space,</p>
<p>so it was a constrained environment.</p>
<p>Everybody was in the same sort of circumstance,</p>
<p>but yet their experience was really different.</p>
<p>We helped them to move faster,</p>
<p>burn calories at a higher rate, right?</p>
<p>Exercise more efficiently.</p>
<p>The amount of time they put in</p>
<p>is gonna produce a better physical outcome.</p>
<p>And it also, it didn&rsquo;t hurt them, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying it doesn&rsquo;t hurt as much.</p>
<p>So we were really excited about that, right?</p>
<p>Because it meant that this strategy,</p>
<p>we could use it on people who are not elite athletes.</p>
<p>It could be easily adopted.</p>
<p>A quick training session can teach people</p>
<p>to look at the world in a different way.</p>
<p>Again, this narrowed attention was different</p>
<p>than whatever they do naturally, the comparison group,</p>
<p>but it had a big outcome.</p>
<p>It had a big difference on the way</p>
<p>that they were engaged in the exercise.</p>
<p>It was like some of the first work that we did</p>
<p>and then since then we&rsquo;ve done, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>dozens more studies to look at, well, what happens with that</p>
<p>and what else can we do with playing around with this?</p>
<p>Yeah, those are impressive differences</p>
<p>as a consequence of narrowing visual attention.</p>
<p>Couple of questions about the actual practice</p>
<p>of narrowing attention.</p>
<p>Is there any indication of whether or not</p>
<p>subjects are constantly updating their visual attention?</p>
<p>So for instance, if let&rsquo;s say the goal line is in view,</p>
<p>literally from the beginning,</p>
<p>I could imagine just holding visual attention</p>
<p>on the goal line, but if it&rsquo;s a oval track</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a trajectory along a trail or through a city,</p>
<p>how often do you think they are updating</p>
<p>their visual aperture and setting a visual goal?</p>
<p>And I could imagine that there&rsquo;s some energetic expense</p>
<p>to that, meaning you wouldn&rsquo;t wanna do every crack</p>
<p>on the sidewalk unless those cracks on the sidewalk</p>
<p>were very far apart because I think at some point</p>
<p>that itself would be exhausting.</p>
<p>So is there an optimal strategy or a semi-optimal strategy?</p>
<p>Yeah, so those Olympic athletes that we started</p>
<p>by interviewing, they tended to be sprinters.</p>
<p>They were more often sprinters, short distance sprinters.</p>
<p>So when they said like, yes, I narrow in</p>
<p>more than I assume an expansive focus,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re not going that far, right?</p>
<p>They have to do it as fast as humanly possible,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not going that far.</p>
<p>And so we started asking that question too</p>
<p>about like, well, wouldn&rsquo;t that be tiring?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes.</p>
<p>So when we start to look at, well, people</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t sprinters, who are accomplished,</p>
<p>but who are more long distance runners,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we find that they do is that they&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>that narrowed attention strategy strategically</p>
<p>and it increases in use.</p>
<p>They use it more often as the race progresses.</p>
<p>And they really start to do this major switch</p>
<p>about the halfway point of say like a 10 kilometer run.</p>
<p>So people who are seasoned runners,</p>
<p>they really start making a switch</p>
<p>with what they&rsquo;re looking at about halfway through.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where they more often, more frequently</p>
<p>and are more intentionally adopting</p>
<p>a narrowed focus of attention</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re in the last couple miles of a run,</p>
<p>when maybe their resources are starting to get more thin,</p>
<p>maybe their motivation is starting to fade.</p>
<p>That tipping point in the middle is with any kind of goal</p>
<p>where people struggle the most.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re like doubling down</p>
<p>on a strategy that they know to be effective.</p>
<p>So, at first, longer distance runners</p>
<p>are not using that narrowed strategy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking more expansively</p>
<p>because I think that, well, first of all,</p>
<p>distraction is a thing, it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>Not necessarily that they&rsquo;re distracting themselves</p>
<p>because people are still trying to hold pace</p>
<p>and jostle among probably a more concentrated</p>
<p>group of runners.</p>
<p>But it is a strategy that they use</p>
<p>and then sort of wean off of as the race goes through.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s particularly effective</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re looking for that last push, right?</p>
<p>The last push to get over the finish line</p>
<p>when like you might be literally neck and neck</p>
<p>with somebody that you&rsquo;re trying to just beat out</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re most tired, but you know,</p>
<p>like that last push, you don&rsquo;t wanna drop off.</p>
<p>And when you wanna push through hard</p>
<p>through that finish line,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when people are using it</p>
<p>at its peak level of intensity.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Yeah, to me, this makes total sense why it would work</p>
<p>without going down the rabbit hole of visual neuroscience</p>
<p>of something for another time,</p>
<p>that when we do these virgin sign movements,</p>
<p>when we bring our eyes to a visual target,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that some of the brainstem circuitry</p>
<p>for alertness gets engaged to a greater degree.</p>
<p>The other thing is that we know that when we focus</p>
<p>on an object that the optics of the eye change</p>
<p>and narrow the visual field.</p>
<p>So that brings about, this is a very detailed question,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure the audience is wondering,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m focused on a goal line or an intermediate goal</p>
<p>are they focusing on a specific point</p>
<p>or is it kind of the entire horizon of that goal?</p>
<p>Because the finish line is indeed a line.</p>
<p>So, and of course this is, it&rsquo;s impossible to know</p>
<p>what someone is actually doing in their mind&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p>but how do people report this?</p>
<p>Do they see it literally as a spotlight?</p>
<p>And if so, how broad is that spot?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, you know, what is the length of their aperture</p>
<p>rather than the, maybe the diameter or the sphere,</p>
<p>the sphere size of it?</p>
<p>You know, in our interviews with people,</p>
<p>our sort of focus group studies,</p>
<p>it seems like it&rsquo;s more like a circular point.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in fact what we&rsquo;re teaching people,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re training them to do.</p>
<p>So rather than going broadly looking across a line</p>
<p>from left to right, we are encouraging them</p>
<p>to like imagine a circle of light</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s shining on some target.</p>
<p>Now, of course the finish line is a line,</p>
<p>but if they&rsquo;re staying in their lane,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re on a track, right,</p>
<p>you can imagine that there is a circle shining</p>
<p>just on where in their lane they&rsquo;ll cross that finish line.</p>
<p>Or if it&rsquo;s a stop sign,</p>
<p>you could imagine a circle of light illuminating that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re teaching people to use.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what seems to be effective</p>
<p>to maintain that focus rather than sort of being pulled</p>
<p>to engage with peripheral vision.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some amazing people,</p>
<p>some runners in history like Joan Benoit Samuelson.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s one of the first female marathon competitors</p>
<p>who has won multiple marathons.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s Canadian.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s won, feel free to correct me,</p>
<p>like 10 marathons in her life.</p>
<p>And she talks about sort of not assuming this wide,</p>
<p>but narrow, wide, but not deep or tall attentional focus.</p>
<p>She talks about like finding the shorts on somebody</p>
<p>ahead of me and focusing on those shorts</p>
<p>until she passes them and then resetting that goal.</p>
<p>So in her interviews that she&rsquo;s done with runners magazines,</p>
<p>she talks about it in terms of this circle of attention.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve experienced this a little bit</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re visiting New York now to do this interview</p>
<p>and runners here seem more competitive.</p>
<p>Recreational runners here seem more competitive.</p>
<p>People walking on the street seem competitive.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re walking at near pace to somebody,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll quickly speed up.</p>
<p>If you speed up, they&rsquo;ll speed up.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;ve been some studies about walking speed</p>
<p>in different cities and New York ranks</p>
<p>among the fastest walkers around.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t mention the slowest walking cities</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t want to cast any judgments,</p>
<p>but fascinating.</p>
<p>And again, makes total sense based on the way</p>
<p>the visual system measures both space and time,</p>
<p>something maybe we&rsquo;ll get into a little bit later.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m curious whether or not this,</p>
<p>the whole thing works in reverse as well.</p>
<p>Meaning, do people who are very motivated to exercise,</p>
<p>do they think this way naturally?</p>
<p>People who are averse to exercise</p>
<p>or who find it hard to get motivated to exercise,</p>
<p>do they view the world differently, literally?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have so much that I can say about this.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ll humor me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a couple different stories</p>
<p>about how we can answer that.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to do a deep dive into vision science,</p>
<p>which of course you are capable of doing.</p>
<p>But what I can share with you is some like animal studies</p>
<p>where this work kind of first started.</p>
<p>This is in the 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice labs.</p>
<p>And they were looking,</p>
<p>those were the first models of human behavior</p>
<p>that people were trying to understand motivation,</p>
<p>motivation science within.</p>
<p>So they would deprive these poor rats and mice</p>
<p>of food or water so that they were motivated to get it.</p>
<p>They were hungry and they were thirsty</p>
<p>and they had practice running a maze</p>
<p>so they knew where they could find that food or water,</p>
<p>whatever that they were looking for.</p>
<p>And what these researchers were studying</p>
<p>was the pace of movement through the maze.</p>
<p>So as the rats were like going through the maze,</p>
<p>they found that even though these rats were hungry</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re having to expend limited caloric energy</p>
<p>to make it to the finish line,</p>
<p>they actually ran faster the closer they got</p>
<p>to that finish line.</p>
<p>So once that finish line became nearer to them,</p>
<p>they actually used their resources probably suboptimally</p>
<p>to make sure that they crossed the finish line</p>
<p>and got their reward.</p>
<p>So that was like some of the first early work</p>
<p>that was showing that proximity to a goal</p>
<p>increases the investment in resources</p>
<p>that animals use to meet that goal,</p>
<p>even when they don&rsquo;t have that much to spare.</p>
<p>And with the mice, the same kind of thing,</p>
<p>they actually had these little harnesses on them.</p>
<p>They were looking at how hard do the mice pull</p>
<p>to try to make it to the food or the water</p>
<p>that they were trying to get.</p>
<p>And same deal, the closer they got to getting their reward,</p>
<p>the harder they were pulling,</p>
<p>even though they didn&rsquo;t have that much energy to spare</p>
<p>and they had already used some up</p>
<p>getting to that finish line.</p>
<p>So that was that early animal research</p>
<p>from the 1940s, 1950s,</p>
<p>then spurred a whole wave of work in humans.</p>
<p>Do humans do the same thing?</p>
<p>Even when they&rsquo;re tired,</p>
<p>but they can see or they can feel that their goal is close,</p>
<p>do they double down and work even harder</p>
<p>to cross that finish line?</p>
<p>Either like a literal finish line</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re talking about exercise</p>
<p>or a metaphorical finish line</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re talking about any other kind of goal</p>
<p>that people might have.</p>
<p>And the answer is yes.</p>
<p>They called that the goal gradient hypothesis.</p>
<p>The closer you get to the goal,</p>
<p>generally the harder people and animals work</p>
<p>to finish that goal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what led us then to think,</p>
<p>okay, those rats, those mice,</p>
<p>those people are seeing a finish line, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re maybe seeing that finish line,</p>
<p>seeing that reward,</p>
<p>seeing the goal they&rsquo;re hoping to accomplish,</p>
<p>that is what&rsquo;s leading them to try harder,</p>
<p>to invest more so that they can finish it off.</p>
<p>What if we induce that illusion of proximity?</p>
<p>What if we can induce a visual illusion,</p>
<p>a visual experience that approximates</p>
<p>what the real rats and mice were actually experiencing</p>
<p>as they got closer?</p>
<p>So that is what is happening.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening visually</p>
<p>when we create that narrowed focus of attention.</p>
<p>When we tell people,</p>
<p>imagine there&rsquo;s a spotlight</p>
<p>on the shorts of the person up ahead</p>
<p>or the stop sign that you&rsquo;re seeing,</p>
<p>it induces an illusion of proximity</p>
<p>that then is responsible for people trying harder,</p>
<p>walking faster,</p>
<p>feeling that it defied their expectations</p>
<p>and that it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as they thought it would be.</p>
<p>So we do things like measure,</p>
<p>like measure their visual experience.</p>
<p>How far away is that finish line?</p>
<p>Of course, we can ask them to report in feet.</p>
<p>How many feet is it?</p>
<p>Oh, but that&rsquo;s challenging, right?</p>
<p>Like nobody really knows what three feet</p>
<p>versus four feet really looks like, but they do.</p>
<p>So we can ask them how many feet it is.</p>
<p>We also use these other measures</p>
<p>of visual matching measures</p>
<p>to know like that distance of the finish line</p>
<p>looks about as far away as this other target.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re matching up their visual experiences.</p>
<p>So what we know is that</p>
<p>inducing that narrowed focus of attention</p>
<p>is creating an illusion of proximity.</p>
<p>That goal looks closer to them.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s all kinds of downstream</p>
<p>motivational, psychological effects that happen</p>
<p>from feeling like you&rsquo;re closer.</p>
<p>By visually misperceiving that space,</p>
<p>it can have a really positive consequence.</p>
<p>So your first question was,</p>
<p>which way does it go?</p>
<p>Does it go both ways?</p>
<p>That people who are better runners</p>
<p>like happen to do this thing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Some of our research shows that,</p>
<p>that if they, you know, for whatever reason</p>
<p>happened upon this strategy and continue to practice it,</p>
<p>they tend to be the better runners.</p>
<p>But we also know from our experiments in the lab</p>
<p>where we take people who don&rsquo;t know about these strategies</p>
<p>and by a flip of the coin,</p>
<p>we randomly assign them to either learn the strategy</p>
<p>and use it or do whatever comes naturally to them.</p>
<p>We can create that illusion of proximity</p>
<p>that has a direct and causal impact</p>
<p>on improving the performance when they&rsquo;re exercising.</p>
<p>So yes, it goes both ways,</p>
<p>but you can also teach yourself</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to just rely on luck,</p>
<p>luck of the draw for being a person</p>
<p>who happens to be better at exercising</p>
<p>or whose eyes happen to do this on their own.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>The most pressing question I have in my mind is,</p>
<p>can we, I, all of us, use this strategy</p>
<p>to make the starting line a goal point?</p>
<p>Because for a lot of people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about going from start to finish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about getting to start.</p>
<p>And I would say, here I&rsquo;m estimating,</p>
<p>but 15% of the content on social media is about motivation</p>
<p>and how to get motivated to do things.</p>
<p>Neurochemicals like dopamine, of course,</p>
<p>being at the heart of motivation,</p>
<p>in my mind, I&rsquo;m making strong links</p>
<p>between some of these visual aperture effects</p>
<p>and goal lines and dopamine that we could also dive into.</p>
<p>But the simple question is,</p>
<p>can I use this finish line strategy</p>
<p>to make the start line a goal</p>
<p>and get my system more engaged or motivated?</p>
<p>And is there any physiology or physiological changes,</p>
<p>I should say, to reflect the idea</p>
<p>that maybe just visually focusing on the start line</p>
<p>would actually get me more excited</p>
<p>as opposed to make me less excited to engage in effort?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly vision science that&rsquo;s tied up</p>
<p>in that very first stage of goal setting,</p>
<p>like identifying what that goal is in the first place</p>
<p>and taking those first steps.</p>
<p>A lot of people&rsquo;s go-to strategies</p>
<p>that involve vision are vision boards or dream boards</p>
<p>or Post-it notes, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re creating some sort of visual representation</p>
<p>of what it is that they want to accomplish.</p>
<p>Where is it that I want to be in five years,</p>
<p>10 days, 10 years, whatever that timeline is</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re working under.</p>
<p>The idea of vision boards or dream boards</p>
<p>is that you, almost like a scrapbook,</p>
<p>collect visual icons that reflect where you want to be</p>
<p>to motivate yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really common tactic that people use.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not bad to do that, right?</p>
<p>For some people, just even knowing what they want in life</p>
<p>is a major accomplishment.</p>
<p>Defining the goal can be really challenging for people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a strategy that works</p>
<p>and involves our visual experience, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, people aren&rsquo;t saying like,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you just sit around and imagine</p>
<p>what you want your life to be like in 10 years?</p>
<p>The strategy that people are suggesting is like,</p>
<p>no, cut out the pictures, put it on a board</p>
<p>and stick it by your bathroom mirror</p>
<p>so you see it every day, right?</p>
<p>Or make a list.</p>
<p>Or make a list, yeah.</p>
<p>People are big on these lists.</p>
<p>I have a lot of friends who are like,</p>
<p>have you made your list?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The list of things that you insist on having</p>
<p>in the context of fitness, relationship, job,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>This seems more and more common now.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>And the idea, like write it down, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re telling you, write it down.</p>
<p>Or create a visual manifestation of it.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, that&rsquo;s effective</p>
<p>for identifying what you want.</p>
<p>But it may not actually be effective</p>
<p>for helping you to meet the goal, to get the job done.</p>
<p>So colleagues of mine at New York University</p>
<p>have probed, well, why?</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Why is just thinking about what you want in your life</p>
<p>and sort of putting yourself vicariously into those shoes,</p>
<p>imagining what my life will be like</p>
<p>if I can accomplish everything on this list?</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t that work?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, does it work?</p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<p>And why does it not work?</p>
<p>Because what happens, these colleagues,</p>
<p>Gabrielle Oettingen and her research team have found,</p>
<p>is that going through and dreaming about</p>
<p>or visualizing how great my life will be</p>
<p>when I get X, Y, and Z done,</p>
<p>that is like a goal satisfied.</p>
<p>I have identified what it is that I want.</p>
<p>I have experienced it, even if just in an imaginary way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that positive experience of thinking about</p>
<p>how great my life is gonna be when I get this thing done.</p>
<p>And they start to sort of rest on their laurels.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s actually measured systolic blood pressure</p>
<p>and heart rate.</p>
<p>And they found that people who do that,</p>
<p>who go through that experience of visualizing</p>
<p>how great my life will be when I get X, Y, and Z done,</p>
<p>their systolic blood pressure,</p>
<p>the bottom number on your blood pressure reading, decreases.</p>
<p>Okay, now I&rsquo;m all about finding ways to relax,</p>
<p>especially in New York, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re constantly living at a high level of stimulation.</p>
<p>And so like, cool, great.</p>
<p>So maybe I should just like think about</p>
<p>how awesome my life will be when I get my bucket list done.</p>
<p>But motivation scientists know that systolic blood pressure</p>
<p>is actually an indicator of our body&rsquo;s readiness</p>
<p>to get up and act, to do something.</p>
<p>Now that can be the going out for a walk,</p>
<p>going out for a run, hitting the gym.</p>
<p>It can also be things like doing math problems, right?</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s just mental,</p>
<p>systolic blood pressure actually goes up</p>
<p>in anticipation of your body or your mind</p>
<p>needing to do something, taking the first steps on a goal.</p>
<p>So then it helps us to understand of like,</p>
<p>okay, if I&rsquo;ve just created this dream board,</p>
<p>this vision board, and put myself psychologically</p>
<p>in that space of a goal satisfied,</p>
<p>why is it bad that blood pressure goes down?</p>
<p>Because it means your body is chilling out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, cool.</p>
<p>I just accomplished something pretty major.</p>
<p>I actually now don&rsquo;t have the physiological resources</p>
<p>at the ready to take the first step right now</p>
<p>to do something about that.</p>
<p>So that was a pretty monumental finding</p>
<p>for motivation scientists to understand</p>
<p>that creating these dream boards, these vision boards,</p>
<p>or to-do lists might actually backfire</p>
<p>because in and of itself is the creation of a goal</p>
<p>and the satisfaction of the goal.</p>
<p>And then people understandably give themselves some time</p>
<p>to just enjoy that positive experience.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s so much for the secret.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>I guess now the secret folks will come after me</p>
<p>with pitchforks, but-</p>
<p>I try to never say the name, right?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not afraid to say the name.</p>
<p>I mean, I imagine that certain strategies</p>
<p>might work for other people,</p>
<p>but everything you&rsquo;re saying, again,</p>
<p>is consistent what we know about the physiology</p>
<p>of dopamine circuits for motivation.</p>
<p>I have a good friend who perhaps incidentally,</p>
<p>perhaps not, is a cardiologist at a major university,</p>
<p>said that one of the major errors</p>
<p>that people make with book writing and completion</p>
<p>is they will tell people they&rsquo;re going to write a book</p>
<p>and people will say,</p>
<p>oh, you definitely should write a book.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s going to love your book.</p>
<p>And they never ended up writing it.</p>
<p>And his theory is that they get so much dopamine reward</p>
<p>from that immediate feedback</p>
<p>with all the protection of never having the book criticized</p>
<p>that they never write the book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are exceptions to this,</p>
<p>but I guess it raises the question,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the better strategy?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m not saying that people</p>
<p>who enjoy a dream board creation</p>
<p>should stop what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the take home message here.</p>
<p>Nightmare board.</p>
<p>Oh, definitely not that, no.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough anxiety and fear in the world.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to encourage more of it.</p>
<p>But the process of goal setting shouldn&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>with articulating what the goal is.</p>
<p>So at that same point that we&rsquo;re trying to figure out</p>
<p>what do we want to do?</p>
<p>What is my vision for the future?</p>
<p>In those planning sessions,</p>
<p>we need to simultaneously think about a couple other things.</p>
<p>One is how are we going to get there?</p>
<p>So take it out of the abstract,</p>
<p>take it out of this idyllic visual iconography</p>
<p>and start thinking about the practical day-to-day.</p>
<p>We need to break it down into more manageable goals,</p>
<p>not just my 10-year plan for myself, but my two-week plan.</p>
<p>What can I accomplish in the next two weeks</p>
<p>and the two weeks after?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to set me on the right trajectory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably not surprising to anybody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been thinking about how do I set goals better?</p>
<p>Plan big picture, think big picture abstractly,</p>
<p>but then also break it down more concretely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably not surprising,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an important aspect of the goal-setting process.</p>
<p>Then again, Gabrielle Otenjin in my department</p>
<p>has identified a third often overlooked</p>
<p>or underappreciated stage that has to happen</p>
<p>in the goal-setting process.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s thinking about the obstacles</p>
<p>that stand in your way of success.</p>
<p>And that will actually help improve motivation</p>
<p>in the long run.</p>
<p>And sometimes people think that that is counterintuitive.</p>
<p>If I want to increase my motivation,</p>
<p>have more motivation than I need to think about</p>
<p>how hard it&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>all the ways that I&rsquo;m going to fail,</p>
<p>how is that going to jazz me up?</p>
<p>How is that going to help me get through</p>
<p>when things get hard?</p>
<p>But it does because it&rsquo;s like coming up with a plan B,</p>
<p>a plan C, plan D in advance of actually experiencing that.</p>
<p>If you were on a boat and the boat started to sink,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the time you want to start</p>
<p>looking for life jackets.</p>
<p>You already want to know where one is</p>
<p>so you can go to it right away.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same thing with goal-setting</p>
<p>is that you want to know what am I working towards?</p>
<p>How am I going to get there?</p>
<p>And if I experience this obstacle,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do about it.</p>
<p>You may never experience that obstacle,</p>
<p>but if you do, you&rsquo;re probably going to be shy on time,</p>
<p>thin on resources, maybe experiencing an anxiety</p>
<p>that hijacks your brain so you&rsquo;re not functioning</p>
<p>at that optimal level of judgment and decision-making.</p>
<p>You want to already have like the snap next step in place</p>
<p>so you can just hop to it, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to do our best thinking</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re in crisis mode,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have to if we have used,</p>
<p>if we have already used our resources in advance</p>
<p>to come up with that plan B or that plan C.</p>
<p>Michael Phelps, like incredible athlete, right?</p>
<p>This is something that he and his coach</p>
<p>have routinely incorporated into their training.</p>
<p>So I love this story that like back in 2008,</p>
<p>he was hot for the first time on the international stage.</p>
<p>It was the Beijing Olympics.</p>
<p>Michael Phelps was on the brink of doing something</p>
<p>that no one else in the history of the Olympic games</p>
<p>has ever done, which is win eight gold medals</p>
<p>in a single Olympiad.</p>
<p>At the time of this story, he had already won seven</p>
<p>and he had just the 200 fly in front of him</p>
<p>before he could do what no one else has ever done,</p>
<p>win the eighth gold medal.</p>
<p>And like the fly is his thing, right?</p>
<p>This should have been easy, like a no brainer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to win this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to break Olympic history.</p>
<p>As soon as he dove into the pool,</p>
<p>his goggles started to leak.</p>
<p>And by the time he had done three lengths of the pool,</p>
<p>he just had to flip around and come back</p>
<p>to the starting line slash finish line, back to the edge.</p>
<p>By the time that happened,</p>
<p>his goggles were completely filled with water</p>
<p>and he was swimming blind.</p>
<p>I would have panicked.</p>
<p>I would have sunk to the bottom of the pool.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have even been in the pool, to be honest.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not a swimmer.</p>
<p>Definitely not going to be in the Olympics,</p>
<p>but for him, he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a moment of panic.</p>
<p>Like it probably would have been for nearly</p>
<p>every other person in that situation</p>
<p>because he had foreshadowed that kind of possible failure.</p>
<p>He had imagined that obstacle hitting him in advance</p>
<p>and not even just imagined it, but practiced it.</p>
<p>What will we do?</p>
<p>He routinely practiced swimming with his goggles,</p>
<p>not fully secured on his face.</p>
<p>His coach notoriously would rip the goggles off of his head,</p>
<p>smash them on the ground</p>
<p>for maybe dramatic effect or something</p>
<p>so that he didn&rsquo;t even have any goggles possible</p>
<p>to grab as he&rsquo;s in practice.</p>
<p>So because he had foreshadowed that possibility</p>
<p>and the solution, if my goggles start to leak,</p>
<p>then I will do, in his case, start counting my strokes,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll make it through.</p>
<p>He knew exactly how many strokes it would take</p>
<p>from him to get from one end of the pool to the other.</p>
<p>He started counting his strokes.</p>
<p>He won that race, the 200 fly.</p>
<p>He won his eighth gold medal</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d go on to win 15 more in his career.</p>
<p>So we might not all be swimmers.</p>
<p>We might not all aspire to Olympic level performance,</p>
<p>but I love that example because I think it helps</p>
<p>sort of demystify or give us an alternative perspective</p>
<p>on the importance and the motivational reasons why,</p>
<p>thinking about obstacles in advance,</p>
<p>thinking about the ways, the two, three, four ways</p>
<p>that your plan might go awry is actually effective</p>
<p>at helping us to overcome the obstacle</p>
<p>that might otherwise lead us to throw in the towel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to springboard off that example</p>
<p>to ask a question that has also been on my mind,</p>
<p>which is, is there really anything special about vision?</p>
<p>Because in the example you just gave,</p>
<p>it was indeed vision that Michael Phelps was deprived of</p>
<p>and it was counting strokes.</p>
<p>Counting is another form of incremental measurement</p>
<p>in the nervous system, obviously.</p>
<p>There are others.</p>
<p>They could be the sensation of the hands smacking the water</p>
<p>or breaking the surface of the water.</p>
<p>So there are any number of different variables</p>
<p>or metrics that one could use.</p>
<p>I could imagine that setting out on a,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a three-mile run,</p>
<p>which for me is a decent distance run.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one I do a few times a week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not a runner,</p>
<p>but I try and complete some runs a few times a week</p>
<p>at very slow pace just for my health.</p>
<p>I could count every step.</p>
<p>That would be kind of exhausting.</p>
<p>But if I knew that three miles was,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to estimate here, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a couple thousand steps, I could count backward.</p>
<p>I could count forward.</p>
<p>I count every 10.</p>
<p>I confess I spend every morning trying to find sunlight</p>
<p>to get sun in my eyes to set my circadian rhythm</p>
<p>and I do a hundred jumping jacks.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m the guy that people are looking at strange</p>
<p>on the street, but sometimes I count every 10.</p>
<p>Sometimes I count backward.</p>
<p>Sometimes I count forward.</p>
<p>Is there any indication that it matters</p>
<p>or is it simply that we attach some sort of meaning</p>
<p>to that increment and the mode of reaching that increment?</p>
<p>Because it does seem like there&rsquo;s something special</p>
<p>about vision and we could maybe dive into a little bit more</p>
<p>of why that is, but at a very basic level,</p>
<p>how broadly or finely should one set the increments?</p>
<p>And does it matter if you&rsquo;re counting steps</p>
<p>or counting strokes, if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s every other song,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to listen to an entire album.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that I don&rsquo;t know if people do anymore,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to listen to a whole playlist</p>
<p>and then listen to it again.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to run as long</p>
<p>as the playlist is completed twice.</p>
<p>You can obviously see what I&rsquo;m getting at,</p>
<p>but I know people are going to want to implement these tools</p>
<p>and I have to guess that the nervous system</p>
<p>is somewhat indiscriminate when it comes to these things,</p>
<p>but that there might also be some specificity.</p>
<p>I think vision is special and I think you do too.</p>
<p>So for a variety of reasons, when you start,</p>
<p>you can really nerd out on how cool the brain is</p>
<p>and how cool vision is within the brain.</p>
<p>And when you do, then you start to find some things</p>
<p>that make vision unique, right?</p>
<p>More real estate, more neurological cortex,</p>
<p>real estate is taken up by the visual sense</p>
<p>than any other sense, more than taste, touch, smell, right?</p>
<p>Vision gets more real estate,</p>
<p>gets more neurological processing space</p>
<p>than any other sense.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Well, because evolution has led us</p>
<p>to prioritize that visual, the visual experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some cool illusions</p>
<p>where like maybe somebody&rsquo;s mouth</p>
<p>is doing something different than what you&rsquo;re hearing.</p>
<p>When people sort of create these like, you know,</p>
<p>weird tricks that might go on YouTube and go viral.</p>
<p>And people are trying to figure out what did I hear?</p>
<p>What did I see his mouth doing?</p>
<p>And what comes up is that people prioritize what they see</p>
<p>over what they&rsquo;re hearing,</p>
<p>when the two are incompatible or kind of like out of sync.</p>
<p>Every time.</p>
<p>Yeah, every time, right?</p>
<p>If you had to bet on it,</p>
<p>bet on what it is that you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>rather than what you&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>And why is that?</p>
<p>Well, I guess a couple other things too, right?</p>
<p>Like we can see super far.</p>
<p>You can see like a flickering candle on a horizon</p>
<p>if it was a totally, you know, clear sky.</p>
<p>Several miles away,</p>
<p>you can see the International Space Station</p>
<p>floating up in the night sky, right?</p>
<p>Like hundreds of miles away.</p>
<p>Our eyes are amazing.</p>
<p>And we prioritize what we see that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s because we never,</p>
<p>we rarely get the experience</p>
<p>of having our visual experience second guessed.</p>
<p>You know, oftentimes we&rsquo;re having a conversation</p>
<p>maybe in a loud restaurant</p>
<p>and we know that we didn&rsquo;t hear the person right.</p>
<p>And so we say like, oh, did you say that?</p>
<p>Or like, oh, I thought you said this.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, no, I didn&rsquo;t say that, right?</p>
<p>So people will correct us when our ears get it wrong.</p>
<p>Or we&rsquo;re tasting something amazing</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t quite figure out what spices were in here.</p>
<p>And so we know that our tongue</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t quite picking up the taste the right way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we read the menu</p>
<p>to see what are the ingredients.</p>
<p>Or we ask the chef, like, what did you put in this?</p>
<p>It tastes amazing.</p>
<p>So we know that our tongue is getting it wrong.</p>
<p>Or you might be touching something</p>
<p>and you look at the tag to see what sort of textile</p>
<p>was used in this really amazing piece of clothing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re looking to buy.</p>
<p>So we know that our sense of touch</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t quite getting it right.</p>
<p>But rarely do we have that experience</p>
<p>of having our eyes get updated.</p>
<p>Where we&rsquo;re looking at something,</p>
<p>oh, I think I&rsquo;m looking at my mom.</p>
<p>Oh, no, actually, it was actually my husband.</p>
<p>Like, okay, like that never happens, right?</p>
<p>That we have gotten vision as wrong</p>
<p>as we might get any other thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re experiencing through any other sense.</p>
<p>We trust our visual experience.</p>
<p>We have a sort of a naive realism</p>
<p>that what we see reflects the world the way it actually is.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s never really fully tested.</p>
<p>We never get the input or the feedback</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve seen something wrong</p>
<p>until a visual illusion pops up on social media, right?</p>
<p>Like the dress example, or the last week or so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been that horse seal line drawing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been all over social media too.</p>
<p>What do you see?</p>
<p>I see a horse.</p>
<p>Someone says, I see a seal.</p>
<p>And then like, you know, chaos erupts.</p>
<p>Or I thought the dress was blue.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I thought it was gold.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>The options, because I see it as blue, so, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like dividing up families and friendships</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve like seen something</p>
<p>that the other person just literally cannot see.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we love those examples</p>
<p>when they pop up in social media when they do.</p>
<p>Is because it defies all of our previous expectations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really amazing, if this interests you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor,</p>
<p>who plays with these ideas too.</p>
<p>And his installations are just fascinating.</p>
<p>I saw one at a museum once where, you know,</p>
<p>I walked down this long hall</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a big black rectangle</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s painted on the wall.</p>
<p>And I was like, this guy&rsquo;s super famous.</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a big black rectangle painted on the wall.</p>
<p>What is this about?</p>
<p>Like, what hoax?</p>
<p>You know, this museum paid how much, what, whatever.</p>
<p>But then as you get closer, you get closer</p>
<p>and your eyes start to settle in</p>
<p>and they adapt to the different visual lighting.</p>
<p>You realize it&rsquo;s not a black square painted on the wall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge hole he&rsquo;s carved into the wall.</p>
<p>And there is a whole other world that&rsquo;s back behind there</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t see right away</p>
<p>until your eyes adapt to the different lighting conditions.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>As a vision scientist, I have to see,</p>
<p>where is this exhibit?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not up right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen, there was a retrospective several years ago</p>
<p>that was done in Sydney,</p>
<p>but his work is all over the place.</p>
<p>So Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up</p>
<p>because like the dress example</p>
<p>or the horse seal line drawing</p>
<p>or artists like Anish Kapoor&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>that is a moment that gives us a different,</p>
<p>unexpected insight about the world,</p>
<p>that it challenges us to see something</p>
<p>that we hadn&rsquo;t seen before,</p>
<p>or it induces or tricks us into seeing something</p>
<p>that we wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise have seen.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s those rare moments</p>
<p>that I think are actually really important</p>
<p>for understanding what do our eyes normally do</p>
<p>because we wouldn&rsquo;t find these examples so surprising,</p>
<p>so engaging, so shocking</p>
<p>if we had routinely gotten the experience</p>
<p>of realizing we&rsquo;re not seeing the world the way that it is.</p>
<p>So that is why I think vision is special</p>
<p>and why it can be thought of as a tool</p>
<p>that we can add to our toolkit</p>
<p>for how to better accomplish our goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that we should just only focus</p>
<p>on imagining the world through an attentional spotlight,</p>
<p>but maybe that&rsquo;s something that we can employ strategically</p>
<p>on occasion when we think it&rsquo;s gonna best help us,</p>
<p>when we need an extra little push</p>
<p>to cross that literal or metaphorical finish line,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the only tactic that we use.</p>
<p>Just like it&rsquo;s not bad to use vision boards,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s use something else also.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bad to talk to ourselves in encouraging ways,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s try adding another tool to our tool belt</p>
<p>in case that&rsquo;s not enough to get the job done.</p>
<p>So I do think that there&rsquo;s great power</p>
<p>in thinking about our visual experience</p>
<p>alongside other tactics that we might use</p>
<p>for meeting our goals.</p>
<p>And another one of those tactics</p>
<p>might be like the numerics that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Do I think about my jumping jacks in terms of groups of 10</p>
<p>or as a set of 100?</p>
<p>You do it routinely.</p>
<p>So you might be able to set a goal of 100</p>
<p>and have that sustain you through number 60, number 70,</p>
<p>when maybe it&rsquo;s starting to get harder.</p>
<p>But for somebody who&rsquo;s just starting out</p>
<p>and wants to be able to make it to 100,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably not gonna work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be maybe really,</p>
<p>that could be quite challenging for them</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s the first time that they&rsquo;re trying it.</p>
<p>And so instead, setting those micro goals of groups of 10</p>
<p>is gonna be useful</p>
<p>because as we start to get to number eight or nine</p>
<p>or number 88 or 89, and it&rsquo;s really getting hard,</p>
<p>we need that extra little hedonic hit</p>
<p>of pleasure, of accomplishment,</p>
<p>the micro dopamine rush that you might get</p>
<p>by hitting another 10, another decade milestone,</p>
<p>another group of 10 milestone.</p>
<p>And once we get that little hit of pleasure, excitement</p>
<p>or self-congratulations,</p>
<p>that might be enough to sustain us</p>
<p>through the next challenging physical obstacle,</p>
<p>the next group of 10 that we might experience.</p>
<p>So there isn&rsquo;t any like prescription that I would give</p>
<p>and say, every person should decide</p>
<p>that 25 jumping jacks is the goal.</p>
<p>No, we have to be idiosyncratic and introspect</p>
<p>about where are we at with this goal,</p>
<p>this thing that I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish</p>
<p>and set those goals realistically,</p>
<p>but inspirationally as well.</p>
<p>We wanna set a goal that will challenge us,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t impossible.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t wanna set goals that are too easy</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not gonna trick ourselves</p>
<p>into like feeling so great about doing one jumping jack.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m pretty sure most people,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s a goal, they can do one.</p>
<p>So are you gonna feel so great when you hit that goal?</p>
<p>No, because it was too easy.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have any doubt that you could do that one,</p>
<p>but what about 25?</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, I might feel pretty good about that.</p>
<p>Well, what about the next group of 25?</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m at 50.</p>
<p>Those are goals that might seem just beyond the brink</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s possible, but I will feel good when I hit that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna give me the next sort of boost of energy</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna need to go a little bit further,</p>
<p>either that time or the next time.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think vision is special.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m strongly biased here.</p>
<p>The reason I initially learned about your work was,</p>
<p>well, now you have this amazing book,</p>
<p>but at the time there wasn&rsquo;t the book.</p>
<p>There were just the scientific papers.</p>
<p>And of course, upon which the book rests</p>
<p>and those papers are really important,</p>
<p>but was the relationship between vision</p>
<p>and obviously is our sense of space,</p>
<p>but how the sense of space and time are related.</p>
<p>And to make the idea quite simple for those listening,</p>
<p>when you narrow your visual window,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re measuring the time bin also gets smaller, right?</p>
<p>Which makes sense when you hear it.</p>
<p>Whereas if you take on a huge visual landscape,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually carving up time differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like moving from a slow frame rate</p>
<p>to a fine frame rate.</p>
<p>Slow motion camera is actually taking</p>
<p>a lot more snapshots, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re measuring distance over time more finely.</p>
<p>And so whereas strobe would be the other example,</p>
<p>which is strobe is very low frequency.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going here, here, here,</p>
<p>as opposed to slow motion, right?</p>
<p>Strobe gives a coarse view into the time domain</p>
<p>and high speed photography gives a fine view</p>
<p>in the time domain.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m almost certain without any knowledge</p>
<p>of underlying data, but knowledge of the mechanism,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost certain if not certain</p>
<p>that by placing a narrow visual aperture,</p>
<p>we change the way we perceive time.</p>
<p>Now, I have a question and to be honest,</p>
<p>I know the answer in advance,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love for you to tell us a bit</p>
<p>about how some of this works still further in reverse,</p>
<p>meaning how unfit people view the world</p>
<p>versus how fit people view the world</p>
<p>or how unmotivated people visually see the world</p>
<p>as opposed to highly motivated people.</p>
<p>You talked about these elite runners,</p>
<p>you give them Michael Phelps&rsquo;s example,</p>
<p>but maybe you could describe that study.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a particularly important one,</p>
<p>mostly because yes, it identifies perhaps a physiological</p>
<p>or psychological differences between motivated</p>
<p>and unmotivated or fit and unfit people,</p>
<p>but it also provides a path to remedy that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s out of my lab,</p>
<p>but also out of several other labs,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been work looking at that relation</p>
<p>between states of the body and visual experiences.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t necessarily tried</p>
<p>to integrate the motivation science element to it,</p>
<p>but they were looking to see the visual experiences change</p>
<p>as a function of different states of our body.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve looked at people who experienced chronic fatigue,</p>
<p>elderly, people who are overweight,</p>
<p>those that are wearing heavy backpacks</p>
<p>and so who are sort of put into that experience</p>
<p>of being overweight,</p>
<p>what happens to their perceptions of the environment?</p>
<p>Well, what they find is that distances look further</p>
<p>to those that are overweight, chronically tired,</p>
<p>older rather than younger, weighted down with extra baggage.</p>
<p>Distances look farther and hills look steeper.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done some of those studies too,</p>
<p>where we try to like give people more energy</p>
<p>or deprive them of energy</p>
<p>and see does that change their perception of space.</p>
<p>And we did that by sort of a classic technique</p>
<p>of a double blind study</p>
<p>where the participant doesn&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna say a double espresso.</p>
<p>Oh, that is also a good psychological experience</p>
<p>to give people.</p>
<p>Yeah, so a double blind experiment</p>
<p>where the participant doesn&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>the full extent of what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>or what they&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>
<p>And the researcher who&rsquo;s interacting with them also doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They do this a lot in medical studies.</p>
<p>You give somebody a drug</p>
<p>and you give somebody a placebo, a sugar pill.</p>
<p>And then importantly, nobody really knows who&rsquo;s got what</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;ve analyzed all the data</p>
<p>and the results are revealed</p>
<p>that these are the people that had the drug,</p>
<p>the active agent.</p>
<p>Same idea in the psychological research.</p>
<p>In this case, what we did was give people Kool-Aid to drink.</p>
<p>And for some people that Kool-Aid was sweetened with sugar,</p>
<p>an actual caloric entity.</p>
<p>It could give them energy.</p>
<p>Other people drank Kool-Aid sweetened with Splenda.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s sweet,</p>
<p>but it actually doesn&rsquo;t have any caloric value.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not giving people energy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just giving them that experience of sweetness.</p>
<p>Now, some people of course are really good at identifying</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s real sugar and what&rsquo;s Splenda.</p>
<p>But when you put it in a Kool-Aid, a pretty noxious powder,</p>
<p>it actually masked it for everybody</p>
<p>and nobody had any idea.</p>
<p>Because it tastes like garbage to everybody.</p>
<p>It tastes like garbage.</p>
<p>Sorry Kool-Aid.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure there are many people that love Kool-Aid.</p>
<p>I guess the sales of Kool-Aid will reveal the data.</p>
<p>Yeah, I grew up in Nebraska actually where Kool-Aid is from.</p>
<p>It originated in Nebraska.</p>
<p>So I do feel like I&rsquo;m betraying my roots slightly</p>
<p>by casting some shade on Kool-Aid.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how it worked is that,</p>
<p>we asked them to guess what they got.</p>
<p>We tested them afterwards and they were wrong.</p>
<p>So nobody is able to guess with accuracy</p>
<p>what was your drink sweetened with.</p>
<p>Which is important because they were blind.</p>
<p>The way that scientists use it.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know what it was that they were drinking.</p>
<p>We give it, you know, we give them about 10 to 15 minutes</p>
<p>for that sugar to metabolize.</p>
<p>And we measured their circulating blood glucose levels</p>
<p>to make sure that we had in fact given their body</p>
<p>a circulating glucose energy</p>
<p>that they might use in the next activity.</p>
<p>And the researcher again didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>whether they had just served sugar or Splenda.</p>
<p>Then we asked people to estimate distance.</p>
<p>So we gave some people more energy</p>
<p>or we kept others sort of at</p>
<p>like whatever their normal level was.</p>
<p>And what we found is that those people</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t even know it,</p>
<p>but who had been given more energy</p>
<p>by drinking Kool-Aid sweetened with sugar,</p>
<p>perceived their space as more constricted.</p>
<p>That visual illusion of proximity was induced.</p>
<p>They felt that their finish line,</p>
<p>again in the context of an exercise task,</p>
<p>was closer to them.</p>
<p>So in just the same way that these other physiology labs,</p>
<p>vision science physiology labs,</p>
<p>found that people who are chronically tired,</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t feel like they have as much energy,</p>
<p>or those that are physically weighted down</p>
<p>and for whom, you know,</p>
<p>moving within an environment is more costly,</p>
<p>we could create that experience for people.</p>
<p>We did an experimental version of that,</p>
<p>that if you have more energy, the world looks easier.</p>
<p>The distances to a finish line don&rsquo;t look as far.</p>
<p>So that was some of the experimental evidence that we had</p>
<p>to show that people&rsquo;s states of their body</p>
<p>do impact their visual experience.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a motivation researcher.</p>
<p>So for me, the big question is,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s the point of that study then,</p>
<p>besides just showing this connection</p>
<p>between the body and the eyes and the visual experience?</p>
<p>We think that that&rsquo;s fundamental</p>
<p>to one of the reasons that people experience difficulty</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re exercising.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s really harder for your body</p>
<p>because of its physical state to move within a space,</p>
<p>you might say like, well, why don&rsquo;t they just go exercise?</p>
<p>Because the world looks harder to them.</p>
<p>Because that distance that they&rsquo;re supposed to walk</p>
<p>because a doctor tells them to,</p>
<p>or that a partner encourages them to,</p>
<p>or a hill that they should hike up</p>
<p>because someone told them</p>
<p>that would be good for their health,</p>
<p>it looks more challenging to them</p>
<p>than it does to somebody who is in better physical health.</p>
<p>Now, if it looks that way, if it looks harder,</p>
<p>if it feels like it might be harder,</p>
<p>then psychologically we know that it is.</p>
<p>When you have set yourself up psychologically, mentally,</p>
<p>for that kind of failure experience,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know that I have the resources</p>
<p>to get this job done, this looks really hard,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already motivationally in a place</p>
<p>for this task to be closer to impossible for you.</p>
<p>So to put it all together then,</p>
<p>what we know is that people whose bodies</p>
<p>might make it more challenging for them to exercise</p>
<p>are seeing the world in a more challenging way,</p>
<p>and that is having these downstream motivational</p>
<p>and psychological effects that makes it less likely</p>
<p>for them to try to take on the task in the first place</p>
<p>or to experience it as harder</p>
<p>than other people would or do.</p>
<p>Is the solution the same, however?</p>
<p>Meaning if these people are taught</p>
<p>to adjust their visual goal line</p>
<p>or to set a visual spotlight on an intermediate goal,</p>
<p>can they overcome some of this challenge</p>
<p>that they face simply by virtue of their skewed perception?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So in all of the studies that we have done,</p>
<p>looking at that connection</p>
<p>between this narrowed focus of attention</p>
<p>and improvements in exercise,</p>
<p>we do not find that it only works</p>
<p>for the people who are in shape</p>
<p>or that it backfires for people who are out of shape.</p>
<p>It works for everybody.</p>
<p>This is a strategy that everybody can adopt</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just simply about like,</p>
<p>what do you allocate attentional resources to?</p>
<p>What do you sort of ignore and what do you focus on?</p>
<p>And that visually induces the same kind of illusion</p>
<p>for everybody, regardless of whether you&rsquo;re overweight</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re at your target weight,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re struggling to get there</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve already accomplished where you wanna be.</p>
<p>That visual illusion can be induced for everybody</p>
<p>and it has the same kinds of consequences.</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
<p>Earlier, I made a joke about double espresso,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;ll make a serious statement about double espresso</p>
<p>which is that it contains caffeine</p>
<p>and caffeine as a stimulant, like all other stimulants,</p>
<p>cause a change in our visual world.</p>
<p>The most salient one is the one</p>
<p>that police officers look for,</p>
<p>or parents suspecting that their kids</p>
<p>have ingested substances of any kind look for,</p>
<p>which is if somebody&rsquo;s pupils are unusually large</p>
<p>for a given visual environment,</p>
<p>that is an indication of high levels of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>In the street drug translation of this,</p>
<p>people who take amphetamine or cocaine</p>
<p>will have very big pupils.</p>
<p>People who are very relaxed have small pupils.</p>
<p>However, everyone should know that pupil size</p>
<p>also is dynamically regulated</p>
<p>by how bright a visual environment.</p>
<p>So there are multiple things controlling pupil size.</p>
<p>However, we know that when we are very stressed</p>
<p>or very aroused in any way, positive or negative,</p>
<p>the pupils get big, but within the visual system,</p>
<p>what that equates to is a narrowing of the visual aperture.</p>
<p>So rather than ingesting sugar,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m guessing most of the world,</p>
<p>certainly the US needs to ingest less sugar,</p>
<p>at least that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re hearing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are a few sugar,</p>
<p>you know, sucranistas out there, sucrosanistas,</p>
<p>who will also come after me with pitchforks,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s face it, most people will probably be better off</p>
<p>ingesting less simple sugar.</p>
<p>But caffeine is a great motivator</p>
<p>because of the internal sense of arousal,</p>
<p>but it also narrows our visual window.</p>
<p>I could imagine using healthy amounts of caffeine</p>
<p>combined with maybe even blinders</p>
<p>of the sort that horses wear,</p>
<p>maybe like a hoodie and a hat,</p>
<p>maybe even blinders in order to get over</p>
<p>some of those more challenging milestones.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence that people are doing this</p>
<p>without, well, obviously people are doing it</p>
<p>without knowledge of how it works,</p>
<p>but are there any studies looking at how adrenaline</p>
<p>or epinephrine or any other stimulants impact motivation?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, honestly, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, energy drinks are a big thing now.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, for sure they are.</p>
<p>And you know, if you actually are</p>
<p>more physiologically aroused or jazzed or whatever,</p>
<p>you know, amped up, or you just think you are,</p>
<p>in our studies, we have found that they work</p>
<p>in the same way, that it can produce</p>
<p>the same kinds of consequences.</p>
<p>So, and I like that because it tells us</p>
<p>like you can actually change the state of your body</p>
<p>to induce these kinds of experiences,</p>
<p>or you can try to, you can just think that,</p>
<p>you can trick yourself, you can placebo effect yourself out</p>
<p>and produce the same kinds of effects.</p>
<p>I had to give up coffee like 12 years ago,</p>
<p>not because, not for any-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>I love the taste, and so decaf is my jam,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t drink the caffeine</p>
<p>because it didn&rsquo;t actually do the thing</p>
<p>that it does for so many other people,</p>
<p>like make me feel more energized and more awake.</p>
<p>I just got sweaty and jittery and anxious</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t focus.</p>
<p>Yeah, some people who already have</p>
<p>a fairly high baseline level of attention and motivation,</p>
<p>they find that it puts the autonomic seesaw too far</p>
<p>in the sympathetic tone.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>And I happen to marry the same kind of person.</p>
<p>He also can&rsquo;t drink caffeine, but loves the taste of coffee.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that we both have to have coffee</p>
<p>in the morning to feel like we&rsquo;re ready to go for the day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just part of our routine or whatever</p>
<p>to have that taste and have that sensation</p>
<p>to feel like I&rsquo;m ready to take on the day,</p>
<p>even though, I mean, yeah,</p>
<p>decaf still has some caffeine in it,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not drinking that much of it</p>
<p>to probably actually create a caffeinated experience</p>
<p>in our body, but we&rsquo;re tricking ourselves psychologically</p>
<p>into doing that thing that in years past</p>
<p>used to work for us both.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Like, you might have a hoodie that you can wear</p>
<p>to induce that visual illusion,</p>
<p>or you can take advantage of the power of your mind.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I&rsquo;m a psychologist</p>
<p>and I believe that we have some non-zero power</p>
<p>over what our mind is doing, what we&rsquo;re thinking about,</p>
<p>what we allocate our attention to,</p>
<p>that can do the same kind of thing that a hoodie might do</p>
<p>or that a cup of caffeine might do.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>The visual aperture is under our conscious control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an amazing feature of our visual system.</p>
<p>We can narrow or expand it.</p>
<p>It takes a little bit of practice, I think,</p>
<p>for people to learn how to do this</p>
<p>without moving their head around</p>
<p>to expand their visual aperture and how to narrow it.</p>
<p>But what I always tell people is just imagine</p>
<p>a really troubling text message</p>
<p>or a really exciting text message coming in.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, you forget about the world around you.</p>
<p>So it can be triggered by these outside events</p>
<p>and we can learn how to anchor our visual attention.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to ask about other kinds of goals,</p>
<p>meaning non-physical goals,</p>
<p>because many people are trying to read more, I would hope,</p>
<p>or learn music or a language</p>
<p>or things that really involve cognitive goal lines</p>
<p>or internal goal lines.</p>
<p>Reading one chapter out of a book each night</p>
<p>is a tangible goal.</p>
<p>The other that I&rsquo;ve often wondered about</p>
<p>are these systems that allow you to highlight</p>
<p>individual lines or even words on a page.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very visual, obviously,</p>
<p>and everything else is ruled out except that word.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wished for books</p>
<p>that would naturally highlight each page.</p>
<p>And as I say this, someone will put in the comments,</p>
<p>this probably existed for 10 years</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just showing how, what a Luddite I am.</p>
<p>But is there any example or tactic</p>
<p>that people could use to better approach cognitive goals,</p>
<p>school, work, recreational too,</p>
<p>but that don&rsquo;t exist in the kind of fitness</p>
<p>and sports domain?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Yeah, so just a shout out to my brother-in-law</p>
<p>who has done some of that research</p>
<p>where it does highlight different parts of words</p>
<p>in paragraphs and he&rsquo;s found it to be an effective way</p>
<p>for English as a second language learners to pick it up,</p>
<p>that tying that vision to the process</p>
<p>of learning language is effective.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a whole cool body of work</p>
<p>and researchers looking at that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right about that.</p>
<p>If you want to mention what he does,</p>
<p>is there a place that people can learn more about that?</p>
<p>We can provide links.</p>
<p>Yeah, let me.</p>
<p>Okay, we will provide links to those resources</p>
<p>because I want those resources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn a second language for a long time.</p>
<p>I speak Spanish pretty weakly,</p>
<p>but I would love to get better at it.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll approach you later.</p>
<p>My five-year-old son speaks Spanish</p>
<p>better than I do at this point.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>And clearly better than I do too.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, you know, I was thinking that too,</p>
<p>you know, we started this work</p>
<p>within the context of exercise,</p>
<p>but of course that&rsquo;s not people&rsquo;s only goal</p>
<p>that they have in life.</p>
<p>And it isn&rsquo;t mine either, you know,</p>
<p>I have interests outside of improving my exercise game.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago when I was writing the book,</p>
<p>I also had a child, the same month</p>
<p>that I had the opportunity to like pull</p>
<p>all this research together,</p>
<p>is the same month that my son came to be.</p>
<p>And I started to realize like,</p>
<p>I became a lot less interesting once he was around.</p>
<p>He was fascinating, but I was changing diapers</p>
<p>and feeding him and like, that was it.</p>
<p>People would come over, like, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>Where have you been?</p>
<p>Like, tell me something that&rsquo;s going on in your life.</p>
<p>And like, all I had to talk about was this,</p>
<p>what was boring.</p>
<p>And I just felt like I&rsquo;ve lost myself.</p>
<p>I used to pride myself on like crazy adventures</p>
<p>and problems I would get myself in.</p>
<p>And I was a great storyteller.</p>
<p>And that all of a sudden disappeared</p>
<p>as soon as he came into the world</p>
<p>because he became my world.</p>
<p>So then I started thinking like,</p>
<p>I need to pull back some coolness</p>
<p>and if I ever had it in the first place,</p>
<p>but I need to be a cooler person</p>
<p>than I&rsquo;m coming across right now.</p>
<p>So I decided I wanna learn to play drums.</p>
<p>And I wanna be like a one hit wonder</p>
<p>as a rockstar drummer.</p>
<p>I only want one song</p>
<p>because I know I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to do more than that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not coordinated at all, you know,</p>
<p>like from the beginning of time in fifth grade,</p>
<p>I have this really vivid like flashbulb memory</p>
<p>of playing basketball for the very first time.</p>
<p>I lost my footing.</p>
<p>I knocked into my own teammate,</p>
<p>pushed her out of bounds while she had the ball.</p>
<p>We lost the game and I was not invited back</p>
<p>on the team for the next season.</p>
<p>And so that, you know,</p>
<p>fomented my self-definition of uncoordinated.</p>
<p>I am a musician, but I am not a drummer.</p>
<p>And the idea of coordinating four limbs in real time</p>
<p>was like, if I could do that, I would be so proud.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a goal that I set for myself</p>
<p>at the same time that my son came into this world</p>
<p>when I was also trying to think about goal setting</p>
<p>and how to improve my ability</p>
<p>and all of our ability to get a job done</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re faced with some pretty big obstacles.</p>
<p>So I got to practice all these techniques</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about on myself and see for myself.</p>
<p>When I tell people, hey, try this thing,</p>
<p>like narrowed focus of attention,</p>
<p>does that help with something like becoming a better drummer?</p>
<p>And the answer is, yeah, these tactics</p>
<p>at least work for me sometimes under some circumstances</p>
<p>and they do for other people who try them for other goals</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t necessarily about exercise.</p>
<p>You know, one that I found particularly helpful</p>
<p>was overcoming my bad memory.</p>
<p>That everybody&rsquo;s memories are faulty, right?</p>
<p>Everybody has sort of a warped perception of the past.</p>
<p>It might be skewed more positively than maybe we deserve</p>
<p>or it might be skewed more negatively.</p>
<p>If you feel that, you know,</p>
<p>what looms large in your mind</p>
<p>as you reflect on something from the past</p>
<p>or the mistakes that you&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>or the things that the social faux pas that you had</p>
<p>or, you know, challenges that you faced at work</p>
<p>when you got in trouble with a boss or with a colleague,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what really stands out in your mind</p>
<p>or the good side of all of those possibilities,</p>
<p>we probably aren&rsquo;t getting the world right.</p>
<p>And that is something that our brain has evolved</p>
<p>to give us a faulty memory to level and sharpen,</p>
<p>to not encode and remember and be able to recall</p>
<p>everything that we&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>with accuracy and precision.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>when it comes to assessing our own goal progress,</p>
<p>when we want to be our own accountant</p>
<p>and try to determine how are we doing?</p>
<p>If I want to become a drummer,</p>
<p>am I on track for getting there before X,</p>
<p>before my time runs out?</p>
<p>Am I going to make it or not?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an experience,</p>
<p>whether they want to be a drummer or not,</p>
<p>that a lot of people can resonate with,</p>
<p>of like trying to determine, is this trajectory,</p>
<p>is this rate of progress going to get the job done</p>
<p>by X amount of time?</p>
<p>Will I have my swimsuit body by summer</p>
<p>or will I save enough for retirement</p>
<p>by the time I hit 65?</p>
<p>For these goals where time is involved</p>
<p>and there is a deadline,</p>
<p>we do take moments to assess our trajectory.</p>
<p>And if we just rely on our memory,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re probably going to do a bad job</p>
<p>of assessing that trajectory,</p>
<p>of knowing whether we&rsquo;re on pace to meeting our deadline.</p>
<p>And I found that to be the case as I was thinking about,</p>
<p>am I actually going to be able to learn this song?</p>
<p>I mean, I know that it&rsquo;s going a lot slower</p>
<p>than it probably would for anybody else,</p>
<p>but to give myself a deadline and a commitment,</p>
<p>I decided I was going to put on a show.</p>
<p>I was going to invite everybody I knew</p>
<p>and also people I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I was going to play my one song for them.</p>
<p>This is while writing a book and having just had a child.</p>
<p>Yeah, so when you read the book,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see my story and it&rsquo;s the real truth of it.</p>
<p>I mean, I did play that show and it was fine.</p>
<p>Because I wrote about it in the book,</p>
<p>then some other opportunities to play it publicly</p>
<p>have come up and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>all right, I told people I can play drums.</p>
<p>I better show them that I actually still can play this song.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s been fun.</p>
<p>I have become a one hit wonder.</p>
<p>If you ask me to play the song again,</p>
<p>like encore, it&rsquo;s just going to get that same song</p>
<p>a second time, so literally one hit wonder.</p>
<p>So in the process of figuring out,</p>
<p>am I going to be able to play this show?</p>
<p>I sent out invitations, the date is committed.</p>
<p>People are coming to listen to my one song.</p>
<p>God bless them.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it going to go?</p>
<p>And it felt awful.</p>
<p>It just felt like I am not making progress here</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot more things</p>
<p>that actually are pressing, right?</p>
<p>Like the kid does need to get fed.</p>
<p>I do have to go to my day job.</p>
<p>The editor is asking for the next draft of this book</p>
<p>and that is going to take precedence</p>
<p>like it does for so many people,</p>
<p>that things command your bandwidth,</p>
<p>even when you have this goal that you&rsquo;ve committed to</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ve got on the books.</p>
<p>And so I just felt this looming anxiety</p>
<p>about this goal that would require,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have to be daily practice,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t cram that kind of a goal.</p>
<p>It does take committed investment</p>
<p>for a sustained period of time.</p>
<p>And so I had this looming anxiety</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not making good enough progress.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s because I was relying on my memory</p>
<p>and my brain to recall,</p>
<p>how many times did you practice?</p>
<p>What was it like the last time you practiced?</p>
<p>What was it like when you tried to play this bit,</p>
<p>or this riff like two weeks ago?</p>
<p>Have you gotten any better since then?</p>
<p>And it just felt like, no, I haven&rsquo;t practiced enough.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember when the last time I played was,</p>
<p>but it definitely doesn&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m getting any better.</p>
<p>Then I thought, you know what?</p>
<p>I should stop relying on my brain</p>
<p>to tell me where am I at</p>
<p>and am I on an upward slope here?</p>
<p>I need to look at the data.</p>
<p>I love data, scientists love data.</p>
<p>So I started to collect data on myself.</p>
<p>What I did was download this app</p>
<p>that a friend had told me about called the Reporter app.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of these kinds of things out there.</p>
<p>Basically, it just like sets up your phone</p>
<p>to randomly ping you</p>
<p>with whatever questions you want your phone to ask.</p>
<p>It records your answers.</p>
<p>You can download the data.</p>
<p>You can make pretty graphs to see,</p>
<p>am I getting, what&rsquo;s my change</p>
<p>and how I&rsquo;ve answered these questions over time.</p>
<p>So I did that for a month.</p>
<p>For a month, I had my phone ask me,</p>
<p>you know, a couple times a day,</p>
<p>oh, maybe twice a day, really.</p>
<p>Did you practice?</p>
<p>Since last time I asked you,</p>
<p>my phone says, did you practice?</p>
<p>If mostly it was no.</p>
<p>And if yes, then it would funnel a couple other questions.</p>
<p>Like, how did you do?</p>
<p>How do you feel?</p>
<p>Check a couple of different emotion words now</p>
<p>about your experience when you played.</p>
<p>So when I, and I did that for a month.</p>
<p>After a month, went into my office,</p>
<p>downloaded the data</p>
<p>and first took stock before I looked at the numbers.</p>
<p>Like, how do I think I did over the last month?</p>
<p>And I thought, same as every other month.</p>
<p>I like, I didn&rsquo;t really get anywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, I practiced, but I still feel awful.</p>
<p>And I cried.</p>
<p>I cried having to practice.</p>
<p>I like was upset with myself for setting this goal</p>
<p>and feeling like so anxious about it.</p>
<p>All I remember is that I cried.</p>
<p>Cried too much about this personal conquest</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t matter to anybody else.</p>
<p>Honestly, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>in the scope of things anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna become a drummer professionally.</p>
<p>So who cares if I embarrass myself publicly?</p>
<p>But what I found from the data</p>
<p>was my memory was totally wrong.</p>
<p>I actually had practiced far more times than I remembered.</p>
<p>When I looked at my emotion words that I used,</p>
<p>it was a clear upward trajectory.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did cry.</p>
<p>That part I hadn&rsquo;t misremembered or made up.</p>
<p>But by the end of that month,</p>
<p>I had gotten a compliment from my husband</p>
<p>who actually is a drummer</p>
<p>and said like, hey, that wasn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>
<p>And then there was like one expletive,</p>
<p>you were effing amazing</p>
<p>at that one thing you&rsquo;ve been practicing at.</p>
<p>But like, okay, fine, he&rsquo;s my husband, right?</p>
<p>So at the moment, it didn&rsquo;t really feel that great.</p>
<p>And I downplayed it</p>
<p>and as a result, it didn&rsquo;t stick in my brain.</p>
<p>I remember how stupid it felt that I cried</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t make progress.</p>
<p>And I downplayed in my mind</p>
<p>the thing that actually should have been</p>
<p>a legitimate indicator that progress is being made.</p>
<p>So all of which is to say,</p>
<p>I needed to collect that data on myself</p>
<p>and to look at it objectively, accurately, and completely</p>
<p>because my brain wasn&rsquo;t doing that for me.</p>
<p>That visual experience of downloading that data</p>
<p>and looking at like what was my actual experience</p>
<p>gave me a better insight</p>
<p>as I was trying to assess the trajectory of my progress.</p>
<p>I became a more accurate accountant of my own progress,</p>
<p>which is important for setting goals or resetting them</p>
<p>when you need to calibrate in light of what&rsquo;s left to do</p>
<p>and how much time do you have to do it in.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So basically, if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>when the intermediate goals of say daily practice</p>
<p>or twice a day practice or reading or math, et cetera,</p>
<p>are not a visual goal line,</p>
<p>it really does help to visualize some aspect</p>
<p>related to that non-visual goal line.</p>
<p>In this case, the Reporter app was a useful tool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of it.</p>
<p>I plan to use it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a number of people will be interested in it.</p>
<p>It sounds like there are others out there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the one that you found most useful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s another one too</p>
<p>that is even more visual than that, than the Reporter app,</p>
<p>although that has visual components</p>
<p>and is really effective if you like data</p>
<p>and want to collect numbers on yourself or your experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another one called the One Second Every Day app.</p>
<p>This is really awesome because the app is a mechanism</p>
<p>to record one second of your life.</p>
<p>The goal, there&rsquo;s such an awesome community of people</p>
<p>that just live by this and love having these experiences.</p>
<p>And the creator of it, I got a chance to talk with,</p>
<p>and he has done this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s taken a one second video of some aspect of his life</p>
<p>every day for 12 years, 13 years or something.</p>
<p>One second?</p>
<p>Yeah, one second.</p>
<p>And then what the app does is smash them together</p>
<p>and give you a chronology of what your year or your month</p>
<p>or your last decade of life has been like</p>
<p>and presents it as a streamlined video for you.</p>
<p>So you just see these flashes of your life</p>
<p>over however long you tell the app</p>
<p>to create a montage for you.</p>
<p>And so when you see these videos that people have made,</p>
<p>especially those that have been doing it</p>
<p>for a really long time, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I did that for myself too.</p>
<p>I tried it, one second of today&rsquo;s drumming performance</p>
<p>and another second, it&rsquo;s not enough to capture it.</p>
<p>Am I actually doing a good job of drumming</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s my trajectory for drumming?</p>
<p>But the guy who made it says one of the most like awesome</p>
<p>one second videos that he ever made is of a brick wall.</p>
<p>I was like, well, you didn&rsquo;t need a video of that.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the wall doing?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not crumbling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like an earthquake land or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, you know, slightly jittery</p>
<p>one second of a brick wall.</p>
<p>And I was like, how is that motivating or exciting to you?</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been doing this for 13 years, every day, one second.</p>
<p>Why is that the one second that matters to you most?</p>
<p>And he says, because when it comes up in my montage,</p>
<p>it reminds me of like a really horrific moment in my family.</p>
<p>That was the first wall that I saw</p>
<p>when I walked out of the room,</p>
<p>having heard that my sister-in-law had this awful,</p>
<p>awful experience.</p>
<p>Her intestines started to twist up on themselves and not up.</p>
<p>And she was on the brink of death.</p>
<p>And we had just found this out.</p>
<p>She had just gotten into the hospital.</p>
<p>They diagnosed this issue that required like immediate surgery</p>
<p>and our family was there to hear about this.</p>
<p>And we were all stunned that she might die, like right now,</p>
<p>she might die.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the first thing that I saw.</p>
<p>And it reminds me of how precious life is,</p>
<p>how important family is,</p>
<p>and how the rest of whatever we were doing that day</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t matter because we all needed</p>
<p>to be here together right now.</p>
<p>And that is like all of this emotion</p>
<p>and like purpose in life is conjured up or reminded</p>
<p>when he looks at one second of a brick wall</p>
<p>as it pops into his video feed.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re visually oriented</p>
<p>and you do want ways to like remember what was life like,</p>
<p>what has my year in review, what does it look like?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an awesome app, One Second Every Day,</p>
<p>that can help you do that.</p>
<p>These are great recommendations.</p>
<p>And a couple of reflections.</p>
<p>First of all, the brick wall example</p>
<p>is a beautiful way of highlighting this other feature</p>
<p>of the visual system,</p>
<p>which is that the brain largely thinks in symbols.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very efficient.</p>
<p>It batches entire experiences into symbols.</p>
<p>In this case, the brick wall can be attached</p>
<p>to a whole set of experiences</p>
<p>that are very meaningful to this individual</p>
<p>that brick walls don&rsquo;t mean that</p>
<p>or didn&rsquo;t mean that to me until hearing this.</p>
<p>So I think that it highlights the fact</p>
<p>that the actual symbol is less relevant</p>
<p>than what we attach to that symbol,</p>
<p>but that symbols are so efficient</p>
<p>that even in a one second view of something</p>
<p>we can attach to it for better or for worse.</p>
<p>The other is that I&rsquo;m a absolute,</p>
<p>almost rabid proponent of people getting morning sunlight</p>
<p>in their eyes as the fundamental layer</p>
<p>of setting their circadian rhythms</p>
<p>and sleep and health as a zero cost practice</p>
<p>that believe it or not can be done</p>
<p>any time of year anywhere.</p>
<p>But it does take a little bit of effort.</p>
<p>You have to get outside,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do it through a window or a windshield</p>
<p>for it to be efficient,</p>
<p>but it has huge outsize effects on human health.</p>
<p>This has now been demonstrated again and again and again.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m gonna just do a sort of call to action</p>
<p>if people aren&rsquo;t already doing this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start using the One Second app</p>
<p>to record my morning sunlight viewing</p>
<p>and prove that even through cloud cover,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting more photons than you are indoors</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s worthwhile.</p>
<p>I also would love to do this for my next dog</p>
<p>to go from puppy to a full-sized dog</p>
<p>and maybe even to the end, who knows?</p>
<p>Great, these are wonderful tools.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve given us a huge number of practical tools,</p>
<p>which frankly isn&rsquo;t always the case on these podcasts.</p>
<p>We always strive to do science and science-based tools</p>
<p>is our kind of mantra,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve given a rich set of tools here to apply.</p>
<p>I just want to briefly backtrack to something</p>
<p>and then a final question.</p>
<p>Earlier, we were talking about how unfit people</p>
<p>see the world as more challenging,</p>
<p>maybe even hills as steep or distances as further</p>
<p>and how shifting people into a state of energy</p>
<p>either cognitively or through the ingestion</p>
<p>of real glucose to get an energetic lift</p>
<p>or maybe through caffeine if that&rsquo;s within their practice</p>
<p>and span of healthy behaviors, they could do that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many people who are suffering from depression,</p>
<p>which one of the key features of depression</p>
<p>is a lack of energy,</p>
<p>even though there can be anxiety associated with depression.</p>
<p>I have to wonder whether or not some of these tools</p>
<p>are being deployed or will be deployed</p>
<p>in the context of mental health</p>
<p>because depression is this vicious loop, right?</p>
<p>People feel a lack of energy and hopelessness</p>
<p>and then things just look harder</p>
<p>and so then it just verifies their negative worldview</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a downward spiral.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why medication in some cases</p>
<p>and social support, et cetera, can be helpful</p>
<p>because they feel more energized.</p>
<p>The side effects often are a problem, however.</p>
<p>Have there been any efforts to implement</p>
<p>some of these visual tools to create this increase</p>
<p>in systolic blood pressure and a kind of readiness</p>
<p>and willingness to lean into what people perceive</p>
<p>as immense challenge?</p>
<p>And if not, for anyone listening,</p>
<p>I know we have a lot of listeners</p>
<p>in the mental health space</p>
<p>and in the helping space, so to speak.</p>
<p>I can imagine these are zero cost, right?</p>
<p>They, we all provide, people are cited,</p>
<p>have the apparati to do it.</p>
<p>Are you aware of any studies like this</p>
<p>or is your laboratory involved in any studies?</p>
<p>Because I just see an immense value</p>
<p>of implementing the sorts of tools that you&rsquo;ve developed.</p>
<p>Yeah, we haven&rsquo;t explored those ideas directly.</p>
<p>So call to all the scientists that are out there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great opportunity to start looking at these tools</p>
<p>within the mental health space, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Other researchers though have,</p>
<p>not this use of narrowed,</p>
<p>like inducing a narrowed attentional focus</p>
<p>and can they now feel more energized to go for a run,</p>
<p>but they have looked at the relationship</p>
<p>between anxiety, depression and visual experience</p>
<p>and found over decades,</p>
<p>evidence that people with depression or with anxiety,</p>
<p>what their attention is captured by</p>
<p>within the bigger global surrounding world</p>
<p>are those things that are negative</p>
<p>or reinforcing of their worldview.</p>
<p>Now that happens for everybody.</p>
<p>The things that are on our mind tend to like pop out</p>
<p>that if whatever we&rsquo;re thinking about,</p>
<p>we might start seeing some version of it</p>
<p>showing up in the world around us.</p>
<p>It captures our attention.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an idea called priming.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re thinking about might then lead us</p>
<p>to attend to the world,</p>
<p>to see things in a way that aligns</p>
<p>with what we&rsquo;re already thinking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that what we&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>are those depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts.</p>
<p>When that is what is cognitively accessible,</p>
<p>when that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going through our mind,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s also what captures our visual gaze.</p>
<p>So when we think like the world is hard,</p>
<p>the world is full of sadness</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the thought in our mind</p>
<p>and then we start seeing the people</p>
<p>with frowns on their faces or who are experiencing anxiety</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what captures our attention,</p>
<p>even when there&rsquo;s other people around</p>
<p>that might not be seeing the world</p>
<p>or experiencing the world that way,</p>
<p>it becomes reinforcing.</p>
<p>When I think that the world is threatening</p>
<p>and then I notice the threats that are around me,</p>
<p>that confirms what I&rsquo;m thinking,</p>
<p>which heightens my anxiety or my fear</p>
<p>and then it further leads me to narrowly focus</p>
<p>on those elements of the environment</p>
<p>that are aligned with that worldview,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to get out of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the vicious cycle can come from.</p>
<p>So that has been really well established</p>
<p>within the medical community,</p>
<p>this selective attention relating</p>
<p>to states of mental unwellness,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been pretty well established.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s been some interventions done</p>
<p>with people that have depression or anxiety,</p>
<p>trying, saying like, here&rsquo;s an array,</p>
<p>a photograph of a bunch of different faces.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s artificial,</p>
<p>it kind of looks like a page from a yearbook,</p>
<p>a high school yearbook,</p>
<p>but look for the faces that are smiling,</p>
<p>look at the faces that are smiling,</p>
<p>try right now, spend 10 minutes having your eyes focus</p>
<p>on those and look at those people,</p>
<p>that it is an effective intervention</p>
<p>at improving people&rsquo;s sense of self-efficacy</p>
<p>of what can I accomplish next,</p>
<p>they feel a little bit more energized,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t cure depression,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t cure anxiety.</p>
<p>And these are literal physical afflictions that we have,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s not a quick fix,</p>
<p>but it can produce a temporary change</p>
<p>that might be a way to start getting out of that rut.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think nowadays there&rsquo;s an increasing attention</p>
<p>on tools that will help people orient</p>
<p>as they start to veer towards suicidal depression</p>
<p>or veer back into a depressive episode or anxiety episode.</p>
<p>I mean, trying to reverse an entire syndrome</p>
<p>or set of syndromes is far more complicated.</p>
<p>Likewise in the health space,</p>
<p>just trying to get people to deploy real-time tools</p>
<p>to adjust their anxiety or to exercise more often and so on.</p>
<p>As a kind of a final, but also kind of high-level question,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m imagining that,</p>
<p>and I plan to use this visual goal setting of spotlighting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it actually for some time on runs,</p>
<p>it works really well.</p>
<p>Yesterday I took a run near the waterfront here</p>
<p>and the entire, I think I did it somewhat incorrectly,</p>
<p>the entire run I was thinking about getting back</p>
<p>to the statue, which I started,</p>
<p>but I did find that I ran fastest in the final 20 meters,</p>
<p>which I admittedly wasn&rsquo;t fast at all,</p>
<p>but it was faster than what preceded it.</p>
<p>So it works and it makes perfect sense as to how it works.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done other studies exploring</p>
<p>some of the other features of vision,</p>
<p>like the luminosity, how bright something is</p>
<p>and how people perceive it.</p>
<p>That was in a completely different context,</p>
<p>but is there a kind of a higher level,</p>
<p>a kind of a black belt version</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;re talking about here,</p>
<p>where not only am I focusing on a specific visual location</p>
<p>as an intermediate or a long-term goal,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m using an app to ask me a question</p>
<p>and tap into how I&rsquo;m feeling,</p>
<p>create a visual representation of my motivational state,</p>
<p>but that I&rsquo;m also making my phone as bright as possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also trying to take that visual window</p>
<p>and actually pay attention to more of the details</p>
<p>at that location, or is it simply a matter of kind of,</p>
<p>in geek speak, visual neuroscience,</p>
<p>we would just call this like low spatial frequency,</p>
<p>just sort of grabbing a black and white snapshot</p>
<p>of something here or there in my mind.</p>
<p>If I attach more detail and effort</p>
<p>to the specific thing that I&rsquo;m focused on,</p>
<p>is there any evidence that that&rsquo;s more effective?</p>
<p>It certainly changes what our brains are doing.</p>
<p>So, how do we define effectiveness?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a question for philosophers</p>
<p>and that scientists will always-</p>
<p>Will it keep me running?</p>
<p>Yeah, it will when you use it towards the end of your run,</p>
<p>just like you&rsquo;ve picked up on.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s cool studies that neuroscientists,</p>
<p>not I, not coming from my lab,</p>
<p>that neuroscientists have done looking at,</p>
<p>what is it doing to your brain</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve decided that you&rsquo;re going to focus</p>
<p>your attention on this element of the world</p>
<p>and not pay attention to something else?</p>
<p>Is that just sort of like tricking your thoughts,</p>
<p>or is it doing something different</p>
<p>to something more basic, more low level?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s an area of the brain, the fusiform face area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of our brain that&rsquo;s really specialized</p>
<p>for making sense of faces.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important as a social species</p>
<p>to pay attention to other people,</p>
<p>pay attention to their faces,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re trying to communicate through their face.</p>
<p>So, our brain has developed a really specialized</p>
<p>central area for doing that.</p>
<p>So, these neuroscientists will present a face to somebody,</p>
<p>but superimposed over that is a house or something else</p>
<p>that is less special to us as a social human species.</p>
<p>And so, both of those things,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s sort of like both images</p>
<p>are sort of transparent, overlaid over one another,</p>
<p>our eyes are getting both of those images in,</p>
<p>and our brain is getting both of those images in,</p>
<p>but we can will ourselves to focus on the house,</p>
<p>just really pay attention to the features of the house,</p>
<p>even though everything about that face is still there too,</p>
<p>or pay attention to the face.</p>
<p>And just tell me, what is it that you are deciding</p>
<p>that you wanna hold on to,</p>
<p>that you wanna look at right now?</p>
<p>And you can see that the brain is responding to that.</p>
<p>So, when people are saying, I&rsquo;m really seeing that face,</p>
<p>the details of the face, I&rsquo;m paying attention to the face,</p>
<p>even though we know their eyes are also looking at,</p>
<p>engaged with the contents of the house,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right there, smacked on top,</p>
<p>the fusiform face area lights up.</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re saying like,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m really focused on the house now,</p>
<p>we see activation of the fusiform face area decline,</p>
<p>and other areas of the brain&rsquo;s neurological real estate</p>
<p>start to engage.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think there&rsquo;s something to it</p>
<p>that we can, at a high level,</p>
<p>our brains are responding to our psychology as well.</p>
<p>And we have that great power to really,</p>
<p>with intention, with practice,</p>
<p>decide how do I wanna engage with the world?</p>
<p>And can it produce real change in our bodies</p>
<p>and in the way that we experience the world?</p>
<p>The answer is yes.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve given us a ton of mechanistic</p>
<p>and conceptual and practical information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking for a lot of people when I say,</p>
