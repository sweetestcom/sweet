what&amp;rsquo;s really interesting is that heart disease starts when you&amp;rsquo;re really young like i&amp;rsquo;m talking seven years old it&amp;rsquo;s incredible they have found lesions in the aorta in virtually a hundred percent of children between the ages of seven and nine so i wanted to do this video to increase your awareness on how early this condition actually starts and also to understand the cascade effect uh from very very early stages into later stages because you don&amp;rsquo;t want to wait until you have heart attack symptoms you want to understand the mechanism you don&amp;rsquo;t want to wait till you have calcium building up an artery or some type of clot to then make a change in your life there&amp;rsquo;s a test a very important test i highly recommend everyone get it it&amp;rsquo;s called a cac test it stands for coronary artery calcification test and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take that long it&amp;rsquo;s not very expensive but it measures calcium in your arteries and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best predictors of mortality so definitely get that test and i&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down below for more information also on a video showing my test results but you want the results to be zero you don&amp;rsquo;t want any calcium in your arteries because that already tells us that you&amp;rsquo;ve had inflammation you had oxidative stress you had breakdown of the smooth muscle and that&amp;rsquo;s been going on a long time so let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the cascade of effect and what happens first second third and fourth the very start of heart disease starts with something called oxidative stress and this is a situation where you have an imbalance of too much oxidation versus not enough antioxidants to protect you from the oxidation if that occurs if it&amp;rsquo;s out of balance you have oxidative stress and what oxidative stress does it&amp;rsquo;s very similar to rusting out your car you&amp;rsquo;re starting to get a breakdown in the surface and that&amp;rsquo;s what happens in the smooth muscle either on the inner part of the artery or the next layer deep it&amp;rsquo;s called necrosis okay you&amp;rsquo;re getting a breakdown of those cells caused by oxidation then the body starts turning on all its different wound healing mechanisms and you get inflammation and you get the immune system coming in with macrophages start cleaning up the damage and as part of the band-aid you get micro-calcification tiny amounts of calcium that are coming in there to act as a kind of a band-aid so the cell walls get thicker you start getting more calcification you get more fibrosis that&amp;rsquo;s uh the protein that lays down with cholesterol and that&amp;rsquo;s what makes up plaque so plaque is basically a band-aid so the most important thing to know of this cascade effect is about oxidation and what really causes oxidation higher levels of glucose in the blood is probably the the number one cause of oxidation so you must reduce the amount of carbohydrates in your body okay that&amp;rsquo;s number one and also the omega-6 fatty acids very inflammatory there&amp;rsquo;s been a big push in the last 20-30 years to replace the saturated fats with unsaturated fats unfortunately that led to a lot more omega-6 fatty acids which creates a lot of oxidation in center arteries inside our organs in the eye so number one as a preventative thing you want to cut those out of your diet number two you want to start increasing your antioxidants where those come from well plant foods cruciferous other healthy foods but your own body makes antioxidants it has networks of antioxidants and it needs certain trace minerals to make these antioxidants like selenium and zinc and so on and so forth the most important vitamin for the inside of your arteries as an antioxidant is vitamin e if you have any weakness or a history of having a lot of oxidative foods you should probably start taking vitamin e in the form of tocotrienols and it works like 50 times stronger than tocopherols and it can go into your arteries and start to really protect you the next thing to focus on is fasting fasting helps to heal the inside of the arteries and it can also help build up the natural antioxidant networks of the body so fasting is one of the best things you can do to help reverse heart disease and there&amp;rsquo;s another thing you can get ordering on amazon or some other place it&amp;rsquo;s called edta this is a chelator and it helps to pull out excess calcium from the arteries i did a video on this very very powerful there&amp;rsquo;s a certain method or way that you would take it because it&amp;rsquo;s going to pull out other minerals you&amp;rsquo;d want to put back the minerals that you want and allow this product to take out the minerals that you don&amp;rsquo;t want but it&amp;rsquo;s a great chelator it&amp;rsquo;s great for circulation and many other things number five having enough potassium in the diet very very important because if you&amp;rsquo;re low on potassium which many people are because they don&amp;rsquo;t eat a lot of salad your body will start to pull in more calcium deposits okay i did a whole video on that i&amp;rsquo;ll put a link down below but potassium will keep your arteries very elastic very flexible and they can prevent the buildup of calcium in your arteries and lastly vitamin k2 now this is rare but it can happen where people can start building up not just calcium in the arteries but actual bone in the arteries and that&amp;rsquo;s because they&amp;rsquo;re missing vitamin k2 vitamin k2 keeps the calcium in your bone and it keeps the calcium and the calcium formation from occurring in your arteries all right thanks for watching i will see you in the next video hey before you go if you&amp;rsquo;re benefiting from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link

disease starts when you&rsquo;re really young like i&rsquo;m  </p><p>talking seven years old it&rsquo;s incredible they have 
found lesions in the aorta in virtually a hundred  </p><p>percent of children between the ages of seven and 
nine so i wanted to do this video to increase your  </p><p>awareness on how early this condition actually 
starts and also to understand the cascade effect  </p><p>uh from very very early stages into later stages 
because you don&rsquo;t want to wait until you have  </p><p>heart attack symptoms you want to understand the 
mechanism you don&rsquo;t want to wait till you have  </p><p>calcium building up an artery or some type of 
clot to then make a change in your life there&rsquo;s  </p><p>a test a very important test i highly recommend 
everyone get it it&rsquo;s called a cac test it stands  </p><p>for coronary artery calcification test and it 
doesn&rsquo;t take that long it&rsquo;s not very expensive  </p><p>but it measures calcium in your arteries and 
it&rsquo;s one of the best predictors of mortality  </p><p>so definitely get that test and i&rsquo;ll put 
a link down below for more information  </p><p>also on a video showing my test results but you 
want the results to be zero you don&rsquo;t want any  </p><p>calcium in your arteries because that already 
tells us that you&rsquo;ve had inflammation you had  </p><p>oxidative stress you had breakdown of the smooth 
muscle and that&rsquo;s been going on a long time so  </p><p>let&rsquo;s talk about the cascade of effect and what 
happens first second third and fourth the very  </p><p>start of heart disease starts with something 
called oxidative stress and this is a situation  </p><p>where you have an imbalance of too much oxidation 
versus not enough antioxidants to protect you  </p><p>from the oxidation if that occurs if it&rsquo;s out 
of balance you have oxidative stress and what  </p><p>oxidative stress does it&rsquo;s very similar to rusting 
out your car you&rsquo;re starting to get a breakdown in  </p><p>the surface and that&rsquo;s what happens in the smooth 
muscle either on the inner part of the artery  </p><p>or the next layer deep it&rsquo;s called necrosis 
okay you&rsquo;re getting a breakdown of those cells  </p><p>caused by oxidation then the body starts 
turning on all its different wound healing  </p><p>mechanisms and you get inflammation and you get 
the immune system coming in with macrophages  </p><p>start cleaning up the damage and as part of the 
band-aid you get micro-calcification tiny amounts  </p><p>of calcium that are coming in there to act as a 
kind of a band-aid so the cell walls get thicker  </p><p>you start getting more calcification you get more 
fibrosis that&rsquo;s uh the protein that lays down  </p><p>with cholesterol and that&rsquo;s what makes up 
plaque so plaque is basically a band-aid so  </p><p>the most important thing to know of this cascade 
effect is about oxidation and what really causes  </p><p>oxidation higher levels of glucose in the 
blood is probably the the number one cause  </p><p>of oxidation so you must reduce the amount of 
carbohydrates in your body okay that&rsquo;s number one  </p><p>and also the omega-6 fatty acids very inflammatory 
there&rsquo;s been a big push in the last 20-30 years to  </p><p>replace the saturated fats with unsaturated fats 
unfortunately that led to a lot more omega-6 fatty  </p><p>acids which creates a lot of oxidation in center 
arteries inside our organs in the eye so number  </p><p>one as a preventative thing you want to cut those 
out of your diet number two you want to start  </p><p>increasing your antioxidants where those come from 
well plant foods cruciferous other healthy foods  </p><p>but your own body makes antioxidants it has 
networks of antioxidants and it needs certain  </p><p>trace minerals to make these antioxidants 
like selenium and zinc and so on and so forth  </p><p>the most important vitamin for the inside of 
your arteries as an antioxidant is vitamin e  </p><p>if you have any weakness or a history of having a 
lot of oxidative foods you should probably start  </p><p>taking vitamin e in the form of tocotrienols 
and it works like 50 times stronger than  </p><p>tocopherols and it can go into your arteries 
and start to really protect you the next thing  </p><p>to focus on is fasting fasting helps to heal the 
inside of the arteries and it can also help build  </p><p>up the natural antioxidant networks of the body 
so fasting is one of the best things you can do  </p><p>to help reverse heart disease and there&rsquo;s another 
thing you can get ordering on amazon or some other  </p><p>place it&rsquo;s called edta this is a chelator and it 
helps to pull out excess calcium from the arteries  </p><p>i did a video on this very very powerful there&rsquo;s 
a certain method or way that you would take it  </p><p>because it&rsquo;s going to pull out other minerals 
you&rsquo;d want to put back the minerals that you want  </p><p>and allow this product to take out the minerals 
that you don&rsquo;t want but it&rsquo;s a great chelator  </p><p>it&rsquo;s great for circulation and many other things 
number five having enough potassium in the diet  </p><p>very very important because if you&rsquo;re low on 
potassium which many people are because they don&rsquo;t  </p><p>eat a lot of salad your body will start to pull 
in more calcium deposits okay i did a whole video  </p><p>on that i&rsquo;ll put a link down below but potassium 
will keep your arteries very elastic very flexible  </p><p>and they can prevent the buildup of calcium in 
your arteries and lastly vitamin k2 now this is  </p><p>rare but it can happen where people can start 
building up not just calcium in the arteries  </p><p>but actual bone in the arteries and that&rsquo;s 
because they&rsquo;re missing vitamin k2 vitamin k2  </p><p>keeps the calcium in your bone and it 
keeps the calcium and the calcium formation  </p><p>from occurring in your arteries all right thanks 
for watching i will see you in the next video  </p><p>hey before you go if you&rsquo;re benefiting 
from any of my content i would love  </p><p>to hear about your success story 
please share it in the link down below</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
