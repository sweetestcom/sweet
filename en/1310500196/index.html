    <p>The following is a conversation with Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, co founder</p>
<p>of Ethereum, and a mathematician who is one of the most well read and knowledgeable people</p>
<p>on the technical side of cryptocurrency that I&rsquo;ve ever spoken to.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors, Galila Games, Allform, Indeed, ExpressVPN, and Asleep.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that Charles is not just a mathematician or cryptocurrency</p>
<p>innovator, but also a Colorado based farmer of bison and mushrooms, a gamer, a fisherman,</p>
<p>and a world traveler.</p>
<p>When I asked him if he has a nice professional picture of himself, he sent me a picture of</p>
<p>him in Mongolia with a hawk on his shoulder, meeting the Mongolian president.</p>
<p>That to me pretty much says it all, speaking to the humor and the intelligence of a man</p>
<p>who is bold, innovative, and does not shy away from a bit of fun and a bit of controversy,</p>
<p>which makes him a fascinating human being to explore ideas with.</p>
<p>I do want to say in terms of ideas that, at least to me, cryptocurrency is much bigger</p>
<p>than just a way for a few Americans to make a quick buck through meme driven speculation.</p>
<p>It is technology that enables freedom from oppression, from suffering in the world, because</p>
<p>money is power.</p>
<p>Mongolia, for example, was a reminder of that for me.</p>
<p>Next day, after talking with Charles, I spoke with Wyoming Park, who is a North Korean defector,</p>
<p>and who spent time in Mongolia, as many defectors do, in her and their escape from North Korea.</p>
<p>Her story, the story of North Korea, the story of atrocities throughout the 20th century</p>
<p>committed by Hitler, Stalin, and others, is a reminder that the world is full of darkness,</p>
<p>but it is also full of beauty and love, and it is a world worth fighting for, in every</p>
<p>way we know how.</p>
<p>This is the Lux Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Charles Hoskinson.</p>
<p>If you</p>
<p>self evolve, almost like gnomic.</p>
<p>And then you have Wolfram running around saying,</p>
<p>hey, we can come up with these like very simple rules</p>
<p>and we can reconstruct all of reality</p>
<p>at some arbitrary point.</p>
<p>So I have absolutely no idea what&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You know, I look at it kind of like a formal system</p>
<p>and I say, well, if you&rsquo;re stuck within the system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to actually understand</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re inside the system.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s kind of like an object language</p>
<p>to a metal language.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s this thing that is outside of it,</p>
<p>but because you&rsquo;re constrained and limited by the simulation,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really understand the nature of the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s outside of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like Minecraft.</p>
<p>You can build these redstone computers within Minecraft</p>
<p>and simulate and emulate things within it,</p>
<p>but you really can&rsquo;t go outside of that environment.</p>
<p>The people outside of it can formally prove</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s correct or whatever,</p>
<p>but the creatures inside of the system</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t hope to perfectly understand it</p>
<p>and prove something about it.</p>
<p>Well, also the question is, it&rsquo;s a computation question.</p>
<p>You know, does P equal NP?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;d have to be able to emulate all of these.</p>
<p>How long will it take?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And so I have no clue what type of language</p>
<p>it would have to look like,</p>
<p>but it would probably not be anything we&rsquo;re used to</p>
<p>at the moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d have to be something else.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d have to have some more fundamental resolution</p>
<p>of the relationship of these formal systems</p>
<p>and how they get extended.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like a 22nd century question</p>
<p>instead of a 21st century.</p>
<p>Do you like, do you find the Stephen Wolfram idea compelling?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very different way of programming,</p>
<p>which is you set some rules,</p>
<p>you set some initial conditions,</p>
<p>and let it run and see what happens.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s not a new concept.</p>
<p>I mean, like the Santa Fe Institute&rsquo;s been doing that</p>
<p>for a long time and you can use it for economic modeling</p>
<p>and you can show that in certain cases,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this concept of simple rules</p>
<p>evolving into a complex system</p>
<p>is somewhat more predictive</p>
<p>than trying to build a complex top down model for things.</p>
<p>And I guess there&rsquo;s some analogies to these things in AI</p>
<p>where you start with some simple things</p>
<p>and then somehow it just figures stuff out</p>
<p>in its environment over time</p>
<p>and much better than if you actually tried to model it</p>
<p>with prologue or something like that.</p>
<p>So that is exciting</p>
<p>because you get to just do a few things,</p>
<p>let the thing run and then see what happens.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>In fact, it got so exciting, Wolfram came to us and he said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s do an NFT marketplace.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>I said, &lsquo;&lsquo;What do you wanna do?&rsquo;&rsquo;,</p>
<p>and he said, &lsquo;&lsquo;I got all these universes to sell.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And I said, &lsquo;&lsquo;Okay, well that&rsquo;s gonna be fun.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna set up an auction system</p>
<p>or something like that with him.</p>
<p>And I think maybe end of this month or next month,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll figure out how to do NFTs on Cardano</p>
<p>with Wolfram universes.</p>
<p>So as soon as we can sell one, I&rsquo;ll give you one</p>
<p>and then we can all just claim</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re living in some sort of Wolfram simulation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much money I have,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna give everything I have to get rule 30,</p>
<p>which is one of his universes that he&rsquo;s created.</p>
<p>One of the first ones where he discovered</p>
<p>some interesting complexities.</p>
<p>I think rule 30 is Turing complete or is that 45?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember which one.</p>
<p>You know your stuff.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m not sure if they proved anything</p>
<p>about rule 30 in terms of whether it&rsquo;s Turing complete</p>
<p>or not, but there&rsquo;s fun competitions on it,</p>
<p>which is trying to predict something about rule 30,</p>
<p>about the way it evolves.</p>
<p>And so far, nobody&rsquo;s been able to do it.</p>
<p>Just like looking at the middle column,</p>
<p>try to predict as the system evolves,</p>
<p>say anything like conclusive about the future</p>
<p>of the system as it evolves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both beautiful that simple rules</p>
<p>can create that kind of complexity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also sad that we can&rsquo;t like make perfect sense</p>
<p>of it, like perfectly predict the future.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s all simple and deterministic,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t say something conclusive about like</p>
<p>when the thing will end.</p>
<p>When will this little cellular automata</p>
<p>like evolve in a certain way</p>
<p>and then nuclear weapons will be invented</p>
<p>and they blow each other up</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll just be this empty 1D cellular automata.</p>
<p>Well, doesn&rsquo;t that make it fun though?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fun, but when you&rsquo;re trying to create</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about something that operates the economy</p>
<p>and the way humans transact and cooperate</p>
<p>and fall in love and work together,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;d like to be a little bit more formal</p>
<p>and try to say something conclusive.</p>
<p>If this entire universe is just cellular automata,</p>
<p>then being conclusive is kind of hopeless,</p>
<p>generally speaking.</p>
<p>And the hope is, I guess, that there&rsquo;ll be pockets</p>
<p>of which within the cellular automata</p>
<p>where you could be predictive,</p>
<p>where you can formally show that something is true</p>
<p>and then you can rely on that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be resilient and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>even though the rest of the thing is a giant mess</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unpredictable.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t they call that Laplace&rsquo;s demon?</p>
<p>Yes, I wonder what the demons up to these days.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you for entertaining me with that.</p>
<p>But sticking on philosophy, you&rsquo;ve also mentioned,</p>
<p>among others, that Bertrand Russell and Saul Kripke</p>
<p>are two of your favorite philosophers.</p>
<p>Maybe you can comment on what ideas of theirs</p>
<p>you find insightful and also what do you use the difference,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re both an engineer and a thinker,</p>
<p>so what do you use the difference</p>
<p>between philosophy and computer science?</p>
<p>Yeah, so yeah, there&rsquo;s both a deeply human element</p>
<p>to both Russell and Saul.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this, of course, amazing work</p>
<p>that they did in the late 19th and 20th century.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t really talk about Russell or Saul</p>
<p>without also mentioning Wittgenstein and Tarski.</p>
<p>Because when you actually look at these guys</p>
<p>and you put them together, what they were attempting to do</p>
<p>was increase the level of precision we had</p>
<p>in analyzing both formal languages</p>
<p>and also language in general.</p>
<p>And so Wittgenstein makes no sense at all to me.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s amazing people out there</p>
<p>that somehow can parse that, but.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t make sense to himself either.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right about that.</p>
<p>However, Kripke has Kripkenstein.</p>
<p>He has his whole building on that, right?</p>
<p>And he built a whole hierarchy.</p>
<p>And at least there I have modal logic</p>
<p>and I have the little boxes and I have the diamonds</p>
<p>and I can do a computation and I can kind of reason</p>
<p>about things that people are saying.</p>
<p>But really it was all just about precision</p>
<p>and the nature of truth, precision,</p>
<p>the nature of necessity and possibility.</p>
<p>And the magic of these statements</p>
<p>is that you can then start getting a better understanding</p>
<p>of basically how far a formal language can take you.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the work of it.</p>
<p>David Hilbert also did the same thing.</p>
<p>And Russell, he got his career started</p>
<p>working with Alfred North Whitehead.</p>
<p>He was a logician and there was this whole desire</p>
<p>in late 19th century mathematics to formalize mathematics</p>
<p>in a completely new and better way.</p>
<p>And they started with geometry</p>
<p>and Hilbert&rsquo;s geometry was like a complete system,</p>
<p>although recently we&rsquo;ve discovered</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few holes in that.</p>
<p>But for the most part it was complete</p>
<p>and the axioms are independent and they&rsquo;re consistent.</p>
<p>And they said, oh, well now we can do this</p>
<p>for all of mathematics.</p>
<p>And Russell and Whitehead wrote this huge set of books,</p>
<p>like two big books,</p>
<p>Principia Mathematica, a thousand pages</p>
<p>and the conclusion is one plus one equals two.</p>
<p>So they linked set theory and arithmetic and logic</p>
<p>all in these beautiful ways.</p>
<p>Then little by little, as we entered the 20th century,</p>
<p>logicians started chipping away at this idea</p>
<p>that you could actually construct</p>
<p>a complete system of mathematics.</p>
<p>First with G√∂del and then later with the work of Turing</p>
<p>and Church and others.</p>
<p>They said, oh, you&rsquo;re not complete, you&rsquo;re not decidable.</p>
<p>And so suddenly Russell was left in this really bad position</p>
<p>where his early life&rsquo;s work was basically forgotten.</p>
<p>So he had to kind of reinvent himself.</p>
<p>And so he went into ethics</p>
<p>and he went into different fields of philosophy.</p>
<p>He became this titan in analytic philosophy</p>
<p>and he was also a great pacifist</p>
<p>and he was just a phenomenal writer.</p>
<p>If you read Why I&rsquo;m Not a Christian</p>
<p>or any of his other attacks on metaphysics,</p>
<p>he said, look, I can only deal with the world I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>in the senses that I have</p>
<p>and if I can deduce it, I believe it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s outside of that,</p>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t make meaningful statements about it.</p>
<p>And he said it in a lovely English prose</p>
<p>that you would expect of a man of his stature.</p>
<p>Now, Sol Cryptry, it was like the complete opposite.</p>
<p>This guy&rsquo;s really down to earth dude,</p>
<p>not aristocratic at all.</p>
<p>And he was one of those guys</p>
<p>that just could have done anything</p>
<p>because he was so, he&rsquo;s so brilliant.</p>
<p>I guess he&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s 80 something.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s getting up there, man.</p>
<p>But I mean, literally, when he was in high school,</p>
<p>he wrote these papers in logic and Harvard contacted him,</p>
<p>said, hey, could you teach graduate courses at Harvard?</p>
<p>And he said, no, I really would like to finish high school</p>
<p>first before I go and teach grad school at Harvard.</p>
<p>And so this is just one of those guys</p>
<p>that you can see through his work</p>
<p>that he can think deeply about anything.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like the Galois of philosophy</p>
<p>and he chose to try to clean up a lot of the messes</p>
<p>that Tarski and others couldn&rsquo;t resolve.</p>
<p>He said, let&rsquo;s really get serious</p>
<p>about the nature of truth.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s really try to resolve paradoxes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s really try to build things in such a way</p>
<p>that the work that we leave behind</p>
<p>can actually be built upon</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not thrown away every 50 years or 100 years.</p>
<p>And it was the same for Tarski.</p>
<p>He comes in and he says,</p>
<p>we mathematicians love this concept of truth,</p>
<p>but yet we&rsquo;ve never really created</p>
<p>a nice rigorous definition</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have paradoxes embedded inside of it.</p>
<p>So he had to invent metal languages and object languages,</p>
<p>all these notions and so forth.</p>
<p>So I really liked those four, if you think about them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of great lessons.</p>
<p>And where it&rsquo;s relevant today is,</p>
<p>you have human beings and you have computers</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to understand each other.</p>
<p>And computers live in the formal world</p>
<p>and human beings live in the natural language world.</p>
<p>And those bridges between those two</p>
<p>are still not completely clear.</p>
<p>And so a lot of the work that these guys were doing</p>
<p>in the 20th century, 19th century</p>
<p>had nothing at all to do with that,</p>
<p>but gives you hope that perhaps a bridge can exist</p>
<p>between those two worlds.</p>
<p>And maybe there are some nice tools</p>
<p>for that bridge to be built upon.</p>
<p>And maybe that in some way will allow computers</p>
<p>to better understand us.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve even created languages,</p>
<p>natural spoken languages that are completely ambiguity free</p>
<p>like Lojban and things like that.</p>
<p>What? Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Wait, what? L O J B A N, Lojban.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on a language called Loglan</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a spoken language</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s equivalent to first order predicate calculus.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>So no ambiguities, it&rsquo;s logically consistent.</p>
<p>Yeah, Lojban.</p>
<p>But can you still have fun in it?</p>
<p>You can get very.</p>
<p>Can you write poetry or what?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who actually write poetry in Lojban.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna switch to that and start tweeting in it.</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just fun to study and think about.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, if you go down that rabbit hole,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll spend way, way too much time</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Now, the second question you asked</p>
<p>was one on theoretical computer science to,</p>
<p>I guess, engineering.</p>
<p>Philosophy, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>So first step, you said humans and computers.</p>
<p>So theoretical computer science</p>
<p>is theory of the computer</p>
<p>and philosophy is the theory of the human.</p>
<p>And then we can dissect different stuff about the computer,</p>
<p>but in terms of these two worlds</p>
<p>of the theory of the human,</p>
<p>which is philosophy and the theory of the computer,</p>
<p>which is computer science,</p>
<p>what do you think is the difference?</p>
<p>Like, as we try to bridge that gap, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>what is going to be the biggest challenge?</p>
<p>Like, can we formalize love?</p>
<p>Can we formalize music, art, poetry,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Or is that human nonsense that we need to get rid of?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s human nonsense at all.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s even attempts</p>
<p>to create algorithmically generated music.</p>
<p>And the question is,</p>
<p>is love just strictly a chemical phenomena?</p>
<p>Is there something like metaphysical about it</p>
<p>or transcendent of some sort of formal system?</p>
<p>I mean, computer science is just saying,</p>
<p>hey, we have this notion of computing.</p>
<p>We have this brain that we&rsquo;ve constructed,</p>
<p>this formal system that we&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>And given that we have it, what can we do with it?</p>
<p>And so some people worry</p>
<p>about the roots of the tree of knowledge,</p>
<p>the great Yggdrasil of computer science.</p>
<p>They worry about the roots and say,</p>
<p>how far can we grow them?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s keep adding these new models of computation.</p>
<p>And other people worry about the trunk of the tree.</p>
<p>And some people worry about the leaves of the tree.</p>
<p>And the more advanced the field gets,</p>
<p>the closer and closer it gets</p>
<p>to the people who constructed it, us.</p>
<p>We have better image processing.</p>
<p>We have better ways of handling speech to texts.</p>
<p>And we have better ways of computers</p>
<p>kind of understanding the intent</p>
<p>of what a human being is saying.</p>
<p>And then the question is, well,</p>
<p>how will a computer understand love or poetry or music?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;ll understand it the same way we understand it.</p>
<p>You have to get a computer to grow up to a point,</p>
<p>work and learn the way we learn</p>
<p>or as close to it as possible.</p>
<p>Then you just expose it to the things</p>
<p>that we were exposed with.</p>
<p>And then at some point,</p>
<p>the computer will start creating things.</p>
<p>So the question is, well, how do you quantify creativity?</p>
<p>And I have no clue about that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>You make it into an NFT and see how much it excels for it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But basically, yeah, there&rsquo;s so much of it is subjective.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fascinating whole area of,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m fascinated with this human robot interaction</p>
<p>is how do we create compelling experiences</p>
<p>that are subjectively compelling,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s art or just two humans talking</p>
<p>or two humans interacting in some kind of way</p>
<p>to maximize the richness of the subjective experience.</p>
<p>And I think that could be an optimization problem</p>
<p>that could be solved.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re solving it all the time.</p>
<p>Human civilization is constantly trying to&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly trying to impress each other.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re younger, trying to get laid,</p>
<p>whatever, fall in love, impress your boss at work</p>
<p>by all the awesome stuff you do.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re trying to optimize that problem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s purely, for the most part, is subjective.</p>
<p>Right, did you ever watch Blade Runner 2049?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, did you remember the whole relationship</p>
<p>between Joy and Kay?</p>
<p>And did she really love him, the hologram or not?</p>
<p>Was it like fake love or real love?</p>
<p>Fake it till you make it is my view on love.</p>
<p>No comment from Charles.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go to the difference between</p>
<p>theoretical computer science and software engineering.</p>
<p>Or I don&rsquo;t know if you draw a distinction,</p>
<p>but if we look into this computer world now,</p>
<p>is there a difference between theory,</p>
<p>things you can say formally,</p>
<p>and the pragmatic implementation of that theory</p>
<p>into actual systems that people use,</p>
<p>which I guess we&rsquo;ll call software engineering?</p>
<p>So the engineer, they&rsquo;re obsessed with the domain of,</p>
<p>well, what do you want to accomplish</p>
<p>and who are you accomplishing it for?</p>
<p>So they live in the world of people,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re good engineers.</p>
<p>And they say, okay, what&rsquo;s the experience?</p>
<p>How are we going to use this?</p>
<p>Why are we going to do this?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the commercial application?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the noncommercial application?</p>
<p>And you collect all these business requirements.</p>
<p>And once you&rsquo;ve done all of that,</p>
<p>the better job you do, the more self evident it is</p>
<p>of how do we apply the toys and tools of computer science</p>
<p>and other such things to actually resolve that.</p>
<p>And the point of theoretical computer science</p>
<p>from the software engineering domain</p>
<p>is it can tell you kind of where your guardrails are.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t make perfect programs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no such thing as that,</p>
<p>but rather it can give you a good notion and sense</p>
<p>that your program has some desirable properties.</p>
<p>Like maybe you can prove that it can terminate.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re dealing with total programs</p>
<p>or maybe you can prove you&rsquo;ll never have a buffer overflow</p>
<p>or you won&rsquo;t divide by zero somewhere or something like that.</p>
<p>Some event won&rsquo;t occur</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll cause a catastrophic failure in your system.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always this combinatorial explosion</p>
<p>between what you can test and think about</p>
<p>and what you can actually code.</p>
<p>So the stuff on the left hand side</p>
<p>lives in a different cardinality, a different universe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something significantly larger there.</p>
<p>And the tools on the right hand side,</p>
<p>we have property based testing and these SAT solvers.</p>
<p>We have all this great stuff here in formal methods land</p>
<p>and computer science theory land,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s only a small subset of things</p>
<p>that they actually give you good answers about.</p>
<p>So the balance of the two things is basically saying,</p>
<p>well, what do you care about?</p>
<p>And what are you okay throwing away?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the art of engineering</p>
<p>and building these types of things.</p>
<p>So, you know, cryptocurrencies,</p>
<p>we deal with these complex distributed systems</p>
<p>that have cryptography and game theory</p>
<p>and Byzantine actors.</p>
<p>So the balance there is saying,</p>
<p>okay, what can&rsquo;t fail in that system?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of stuff that you want to apply</p>
<p>as heavy a tool set as you can,</p>
<p>because when that stuff fails,</p>
<p>you either have a loss of billions of dollars,</p>
<p>privacy, or potentially even life,</p>
<p>depending on how these systems get adopted.</p>
<p>But then other things, you know, what can fail?</p>
<p>Is it okay if the block doesn&rsquo;t get made every now and then?</p>
<p>Is it okay if your latency goes up</p>
<p>or your network suddenly becomes asynchronous</p>
<p>and you disconnect from it and you have to restart</p>
<p>the computer or something like that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an inconvenience and burden to the user.</p>
<p>And if you actually try to chase that tail,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll end up spending 10 years chasing phantoms and ghosts.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, the whole world moves on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really figuring out those balance of the two.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really beautiful is that the formal methods tools</p>
<p>have gotten so much better</p>
<p>over the last 20 years in particular,</p>
<p>mostly because of incredibly high investments</p>
<p>from Microsoft and Google and big universities,</p>
<p>because these guys are building these gargantuan systems.</p>
<p>If you look at the Googleplex</p>
<p>or what Amazon has or others,</p>
<p>and they have so much value, so many users,</p>
<p>so many things going on,</p>
<p>and no person can keep that in their head.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re talking about systems</p>
<p>may have 10 million lines of code,</p>
<p>15 million lines of code,</p>
<p>millions of nodes connecting,</p>
<p>faulty processes happening all the time,</p>
<p>hackers breaking in on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re trying to model all of that,</p>
<p>trying to ask yourself,</p>
<p>what formal guarantees and properties can I get</p>
<p>to simplify this system as much as possible?</p>
<p>So instead of the applications of formal methods</p>
<p>slowing you down, in many cases,</p>
<p>it actually massively reduces your debugging time</p>
<p>and your ability to find where errors occur.</p>
<p>In some cases, you can&rsquo;t find where errors occur</p>
<p>inside these massive concurrent systems.</p>
<p>And you say, well, where are cryptocurrencies going?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about just the same thing.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>a much more hostile operating environment,</p>
<p>where instead of it running in a pristine data center</p>
<p>in California somewhere,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s running on your cell phone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s running on your mom&rsquo;s phone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s running your dad&rsquo;s phone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s running on some computer in Mongolia</p>
<p>that may have good internet on Tuesday,</p>
<p>but not any other day.</p>
<p>So when you live in that kind of environment,</p>
<p>you really do need to think carefully</p>
<p>about a whole new class of protocols.</p>
<p>And then you need to think carefully</p>
<p>about a whole new class of tools and techniques</p>
<p>to test the reliability of those systems.</p>
<p>And you need to separate the world and say,</p>
<p>what is high assurance and cannot fail?</p>
<p>Because if it fails, people lose money.</p>
<p>And what is low assurance?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s okay if that falls apart.</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;ll mention</p>
<p>is there are perverse financial incentives in our industry.</p>
<p>Because the reality is when something blows up,</p>
<p>the people who built those things that blow up</p>
<p>usually get paid upfront.</p>
<p>So what they&rsquo;re focusing on is time to market,</p>
<p>speed to market, and getting tokens out</p>
<p>and getting them liquid.</p>
<p>And then people come in, they buy it,</p>
<p>but if there&rsquo;s a nascent bug in some DeFi protocol,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll probably be discovered six months later</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>It blows up, who suffers?</p>
<p>The users.</p>
<p>The people that created that already got paid.</p>
<p>Exactly, that&rsquo;s why you pay the guy</p>
<p>who makes the breaks software for your train last.</p>
<p>And you make sure he rides the train every day.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically describing the complexity</p>
<p>of a distributed system that&rsquo;s fundamentally game theoretic.</p>
<p>And like, if we think about turtles all the way down,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s humans all the way down.</p>
<p>I mean, at the very bottom is still human nature.</p>
<p>Is there something you can say formally about human nature</p>
<p>to try, you said you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain parts of the system that can&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<p>Some people talk about nuclear war in that same kind of way,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this game theoretic construction</p>
<p>of mutually assured destruction.</p>
<p>Oh, that rhymes, see, I&rsquo;m a poet.</p>
<p>That system can&rsquo;t fail because you&rsquo;re gonna blow everyone up</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t formally say for sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to fail.</p>
<p>So like, you&rsquo;re basically trying to chase,</p>
<p>like statistically reduce the probability</p>
<p>that these particular critical aspects will fail.</p>
<p>And then you test, I guess, by deploying in the real world</p>
<p>at small scale to see where things go wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And the problem with game theory and mechanism design</p>
<p>is that you can develop this concept of a rational actor.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think in my life</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever met a rational actor.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a rational actor on Tuesday,</p>
<p>but any other day of the week, who the hell knows?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s even, I think there was a book Freakonomics</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a few of these things</p>
<p>where it just shows again and again</p>
<p>where people behave in ways</p>
<p>that are against their best interest.</p>
<p>So then you have these protocol designers and they say,</p>
<p>well, we need an honest majority for this thing to work.</p>
<p>And they say, okay, well, we&rsquo;ll create this incentive model</p>
<p>and rational actors will behave with that incentive model.</p>
<p>And they say, well, the individual won&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>but the firm, the government, the entity will.</p>
<p>The problem with that is we have a lot of counter examples</p>
<p>where the system was actually behaving in weird ways.</p>
<p>Like we almost completely eradicated the human population</p>
<p>twice in the 20th century,</p>
<p>once during the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
<p>And again, in the 1980s, there was a Russian Colonel</p>
<p>and they installed a new satellite system and it said,</p>
<p>hey, the Americans are launching missiles at us.</p>
<p>You need to turn the key in,</p>
<p>launch all the missiles in the silo.</p>
<p>And he said, oh, that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t seem right.</p>
<p>And he was reprimanded for not launching the missiles.</p>
<p>So in both cases, a single person stood</p>
<p>against the systems of superpowers</p>
<p>between us and nuclear annihilation.</p>
<p>So in general, we&rsquo;re really bad</p>
<p>at building these types of things.</p>
<p>So what you look for instead is say,</p>
<p>can the system be self correcting?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about avoiding a problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about can the problem be resolved?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how nature engineers things.</p>
<p>It gives you an immune system.</p>
<p>It gives you the ability to heal.</p>
<p>If a rainforest has a fire or some catastrophic event,</p>
<p>the ecosystem will find a way to patch things up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a better question of how do you align</p>
<p>the incentives over the longterm of a system</p>
<p>where all the actors within the system,</p>
<p>when an event occurs that disrupts it,</p>
<p>have an incentive to push it back</p>
<p>into a healthy, productive, useful state,</p>
<p>which is going back kind of to that complexity theory stuff</p>
<p>that we began with and a little bit about,</p>
<p>how do you handle modern economics?</p>
<p>Like for example, we knew this coming into the COVID crisis</p>
<p>that there would be catastrophic economic disruption</p>
<p>throughout the entire world.</p>
<p>In the developed world, it was print lots of money</p>
<p>and hope to God it works.</p>
<p>In the developing world is try not to starve to death.</p>
<p>Over 100 million people were pushed into acute starvation.</p>
<p>So acute hunger, it&rsquo;s a terrible situation.</p>
<p>But every economist knew we were going into that.</p>
<p>So the question is how do you restart the system?</p>
<p>How do you realign the system and so forth</p>
<p>and make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t collapse at some point.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an imperfect, inexact science.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually one of the things</p>
<p>that makes our industry so much fun</p>
<p>is that these are kind of like micro experiments</p>
<p>for the macro.</p>
<p>In the years past, you never got a chance to experiment</p>
<p>with monetary policy.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like every 20 years, 30 years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have some conference,</p>
<p>usually in a cool island like Jamaica</p>
<p>and be like, okay, let&rsquo;s go talk about monetary policy</p>
<p>and like amend the Bretton Woods Agreement.</p>
<p>And these would be nation states, invitation only.</p>
<p>And now you have over 8,000 cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>floating around all with their own monetary policy</p>
<p>and their rules and it&rsquo;s very Darwinian.</p>
<p>A lot are dying, some are succeeding.</p>
<p>Anomalies happen like Dogecoin and you say,</p>
<p>God, is this temporary, is this permanent?</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t this horrible thing die?</p>
<p>And then other things you think</p>
<p>would be absolutely successful</p>
<p>and just take off and be in the top 10</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really get as much traction.</p>
<p>Like Al Grant is a great example of that.</p>
<p>I mean, Silvio, he&rsquo;s an incredibly bright guy.</p>
<p>Every time I go to MIT, we have dinner</p>
<p>and his work is legendary</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just beautiful and elegant</p>
<p>and he literally has all the people.</p>
<p>He went and hired Tal Robin</p>
<p>and she got at IBM Research and Craig Gentry,</p>
<p>the guy who did homomorphic encryption</p>
<p>under Dan Boneh is there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these amazing people on that team</p>
<p>and they have money in the VCs.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d say, okay, that&rsquo;s a contender.</p>
<p>But if you look at market adoption,</p>
<p>Ethereum Classic sometimes is above it</p>
<p>and other things are above it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this weird Darwinian evolution produced</p>
<p>Dogecoin organism that&rsquo;s just stomping all around.</p>
<p>Evolution doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Exactly, but maybe it&rsquo;s worth the problem, not evolution,</p>
<p>because the market&rsquo;s the market</p>
<p>and you can scream and cry and pout</p>
<p>and stamp your foot and say this makes no sense,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the way the world works.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of mountain climbers</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t want gravity to apply to them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same situation here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of people in these marketplaces</p>
<p>that had the best of intentions, the best team,</p>
<p>the best technology, and for whatever reason,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t get that adoption.</p>
<p>So the question isn&rsquo;t the local,</p>
<p>it should be the longterm and will the system over time</p>
<p>converge to a state that actually is useful</p>
<p>and meaningful to society and actually solve problems</p>
<p>for it and that&rsquo;s what we try to figure out</p>
<p>is how do we perturb these things in a way</p>
<p>to kind of push them in that direction.</p>
<p>So before we go into this fascinating</p>
<p>Darwinian evolution of cryptocurrencies,</p>
<p>let me ask you sort of a basic programming question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fascinating aspect to your work with Cardano</p>
<p>that use Haskell to build the infrastructure,</p>
<p>but even stepping back more, looking at this landscape,</p>
<p>another place where Darwinian evolution operates,</p>
<p>looking at this landscape of programming languages,</p>
<p>you as an engineer, you as a philosopher, both,</p>
<p>what programming languages do you think are interesting</p>
<p>and more practically, what programming languages,</p>
<p>if you were to advise like students today, should they learn?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s the pedagogy of learning how to program</p>
<p>and to express the theory of computer science.</p>
<p>Like you have to learn how to write algorithms,</p>
<p>you have to learn what data structures are,</p>
<p>you have to be able to do analysis of these things</p>
<p>and that probably the, I think the debate is over Python</p>
<p>is probably the best language or JavaScript</p>
<p>to get started with because they&rsquo;re very useful,</p>
<p>the libraries are amazing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just tons of online materials,</p>
<p>even MIT is now teaching their introduction</p>
<p>to computer science in Python and they used to do Lisp,</p>
<p>I mean, these guys were hardcore.</p>
<p>I still love Lisp.</p>
<p>Oh man, it&rsquo;s great, these are your father&rsquo;s parentheses,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re elegant weapons from a time long ago.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a great starting point</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not about falling in love with a language,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just falling in love with computing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about falling in love with having a dialogue</p>
<p>with a computer and thinking about,</p>
<p>well, how would I solve that?</p>
<p>How would I interact with that?</p>
<p>What does this need to look like?</p>
<p>Functional programming is what we&rsquo;ve chosen to use</p>
<p>for Cardano mostly because we&rsquo;re living in the academic</p>
<p>world, we&rsquo;ve written 105 papers and the problem is</p>
<p>you have to translate that work into code</p>
<p>and the gap between an imperative language</p>
<p>like a C++ or C and these academic rigorous papers</p>
<p>is extremely large and so there&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>a lot of semantical ambiguity between those two</p>
<p>and what I mean by that is that you might end up</p>
<p>implementing a wrong thing.</p>
<p>You might think that what you&rsquo;ve built is the paper</p>
<p>but the computer&rsquo;s not going to tell you that</p>
<p>because the paper&rsquo;s written in prose</p>
<p>and maybe typed up in LaTeX or something</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no proof chain, evidence chain</p>
<p>that you can show that there&rsquo;s no ambiguity.</p>
<p>When you look at a functional language,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a little closer to math and so as a consequence,</p>
<p>the translation of the papers that we spent</p>
<p>so damn long writing and writing proofs about</p>
<p>and so forth to code is much smaller.</p>
<p>Now the downside is these functional languages</p>
<p>tend to be a bit more academic and they tend to have</p>
<p>not necessarily the best Windows support</p>
<p>and the libraries aren&rsquo;t so good</p>
<p>and also they tend to be a little slower</p>
<p>when compared as a whole on average</p>
<p>to languages like C for example.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really a question of okay,</p>
<p>what are you designing for for version one?</p>
<p>Are you designing for performance</p>
<p>and are you designing for developer accessibility</p>
<p>or are you designing for correctness</p>
<p>and are you designing for a high fidelity representation</p>
<p>of the protocol?</p>
<p>Okay, so Haskell was chosen as kind of the version one</p>
<p>because we knew that the kinds of people</p>
<p>who think about that are also the kinds of people</p>
<p>that would have an easy time reading a paper</p>
<p>like Ouroboros and working their way through all of this</p>
<p>and they would do a pretty good job</p>
<p>running a formal specification</p>
<p>and then translating that into running code.</p>
<p>Then once you have that, you have a blueprint</p>
<p>that you can actually reason about, maintain</p>
<p>and if you really wanted to,</p>
<p>you could then turn that into a Rust code base</p>
<p>or into a Java code base.</p>
<p>Going the other way around would be kind of pointless</p>
<p>and counterproductive.</p>
<p>The other side of it is that Haskell code</p>
<p>or functional code tends to be significantly more concise</p>
<p>and I actually have a real life example of that.</p>
<p>So if you take a look at Mantis,</p>
<p>we implemented a full Ethereum node in Scala.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only about 14 or 15,000 lines of code</p>
<p>and you compare that with like C++ Bitcoin,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s 120, 150,000 lines of code.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost 10 times smaller</p>
<p>and so less code, less to read</p>
<p>and you tend to read code significantly more</p>
<p>than you would read write code.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always an advantage for a maintenance,</p>
<p>understandability, documentation and other sort of things</p>
<p>when you have more concise code bases</p>
<p>and also it&rsquo;s a lot easier for you to apply stronger tools</p>
<p>to a functional code base like static analysis</p>
<p>or property based testing or these types of things</p>
<p>than an imperative code base.</p>
<p>But the thing is, it&rsquo;s almost like a religion</p>
<p>or language, it&rsquo;s like saying,</p>
<p>French versus Russian versus English,</p>
<p>everybody has their adherence.</p>
<p>They say, oh, they have the best poetry here.</p>
<p>Russian, yeah, wins.</p>
<p>There you go, always a Russian.</p>
<p>Everybody has their favorite tools</p>
<p>and their favorite languages,</p>
<p>but it just comes down to what problems</p>
<p>are you trying to solve</p>
<p>and what problem domain do you live in?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re inventing new protocols based on science,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna take the time to write a paper,</p>
<p>go through the peer review process</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve done personally,</p>
<p>you know how hard it can be to get into a conference</p>
<p>and go through that and get your ass kicked.</p>
<p>Then you also have to apply the exact same level of care</p>
<p>to the engineering side in terms of implementation of that</p>
<p>or else you will make a mistake</p>
<p>and that mistake will probably be an exploit in the system</p>
<p>that destroys the security properties of the system.</p>
<p>So we really had no choice</p>
<p>but to go to some notion of functional.</p>
<p>The question was, what&rsquo;s the Goldilocks language?</p>
<p>Do you use a hybrid language like Scala and F Sharp</p>
<p>or Clojure where you still have some connection</p>
<p>to understandable things like.NET or the JVM?</p>
<p>Or do you go to an overly academic language like Idris</p>
<p>or Agda or, you know, Isabel?</p>
<p>And there you can really dial up the correctness</p>
<p>and write all kinds of crazy proofs.</p>
<p>But by the way, it&rsquo;s like the seven people</p>
<p>who write your code, they go on vacation a lot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never get anything done.</p>
<p>So Haskell kind of felt like a nice mill ground</p>
<p>between those two where if we needed to pull into the left,</p>
<p>we could, if you wanted to pull into the right,</p>
<p>you could as well.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s really amazing to see</p>
<p>what the hybrid languages have done.</p>
<p>If I was a new student in computer science</p>
<p>and I said, you know, learn any language</p>
<p>to grow your career from,</p>
<p>Scala 3 is probably the language to go with.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s great,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like you want it to be like Java, it&rsquo;s Java.</p>
<p>And it looks kind of like a Java program.</p>
<p>You want it to be like Python and scripted</p>
<p>and you reuse a REPL, you can do that.</p>
<p>You want to go hardcore dot, you know,</p>
<p>dependent object types and do like weird proofs and stuff</p>
<p>and the functional, you do all that.</p>
<p>You have access to all of these things</p>
<p>and Martin Niederski is a brilliant guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done some phenomenal work basically,</p>
<p>because he was one guy who created the JVM</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s worked on compilers for over 20 years.</p>
<p>He did a lot of really hardcore work</p>
<p>in trying to build a concise, nice, modern language</p>
<p>that does a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got great applications in data science and AI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also heavily used in modern companies,</p>
<p>like Netflix uses Scala</p>
<p>for all of their microservice architecture.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s a great language and it&rsquo;s easy to pick up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s easy to hire people into it.</p>
<p>You just find these Eastern European guys</p>
<p>who were Java programmers for 10 years, 15 years,</p>
<p>they got tired of making $20 an hour,</p>
<p>so they picked up Scala so they can make $35 an hour</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really good at it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a great gateway drug</p>
<p>because you have like QuickCheck and Haskell,</p>
<p>you have ScalaCheck and Scala.</p>
<p>You can also do model checking.</p>
<p>You can also go and use a TLA spec</p>
<p>and make it work with Scala and so forth.</p>
<p>So it gets you a little bit of everything</p>
<p>and you can then move around that entire design space</p>
<p>in a beautiful way.</p>
<p>So the recommendation is maybe if you wanna go vanilla,</p>
<p>you go Python and JavaScript.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re getting started.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the getting started.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll get you everything.</p>
<p>You can do web scrapers and anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just fun.</p>
<p>All this experiment with drugs in undergrad,</p>
<p>this was where Scala 3 comes in, it&rsquo;s a gateway drug</p>
<p>to then potentially more hardcore functional languages</p>
<p>like Haskell.</p>
<p>Do you think C and C++, C++ still has a role?</p>
<p>No, I think Rust is completely replaced, a need for them.</p>
<p>Go and Rust, those are the two twins of doom.</p>
<p>I mean, Google created Go just to get rid of C.</p>
<p>They hated C that much.</p>
<p>And then Rust is just a phenomenal language as well.</p>
<p>Hate can be a great motivator.</p>
<p>Let me ask a question from Reddit on this topic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going depth first today.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>As a developer, why should I be incentivized</p>
<p>to create Cardano based applications?</p>
<p>What is on the Cardano developer roadmap?</p>
<p>Any other language, I guess this is the key question</p>
<p>I wanna ask.</p>
<p>Any other language support other than Haskell?</p>
<p>The example this person gives is TypeScript,</p>
<p>Go, Java, Python, et cetera.</p>
<p>Also, have you considered a yearly conference</p>
<p>focused around developers?</p>
<p>Ha ha, yeah, we saw the Plutus Fest.</p>
<p>And we did the first one in 2018, 2019, I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>And we were gonna do one last year, but then COVID hit.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll bring it back and we&rsquo;ll probably do it annually</p>
<p>at the University of Wyoming for their hackathon there.</p>
<p>In fact, it just so happens that coincides</p>
<p>with the Goguen Summit.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re doing that, I think the third week of September.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s great to do an annual conference.</p>
<p>You can bring a lot of cool people together</p>
<p>and you can do hackathons and awards and so forth.</p>
<p>But to the question in particular,</p>
<p>Plutus is like any other language.</p>
<p>Plutus core, you can compile things into it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s entirely possible to write a Scala</p>
<p>to Plutus core compiler or TypeScript compiler</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a big believer of separation of concerns</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t live in a single chain model anymore.</p>
<p>So you have a situation where you probably wanna have</p>
<p>different execution environments and different chains.</p>
<p>So you have different virtual machines there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we work so closely</p>
<p>with the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign,</p>
<p>Kagori Roshu&rsquo;s team at runtime verification.</p>
<p>What they did is they said,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start with something very familiar, LLVM,</p>
<p>which has been around for a really long time</p>
<p>and they happened to have created it there with Apple.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s take that and translate that</p>
<p>into the blockchain space.</p>
<p>Okay, then once you have it,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s very easy to modify compilers</p>
<p>of standard languages like the C&rsquo;s and C++&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and other things that do compile to LLVM already</p>
<p>and have them run there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a different execution model</p>
<p>than what we tried to build for Plutus,</p>
<p>which focuses on correctness, okay?</p>
<p>So then all you have to really do is say,</p>
<p>can both of these models coexist within the same ecosystem?</p>
<p>Because then you kind of, and I did a video,</p>
<p>it was called like the island, the ocean, the pond.</p>
<p>And the basic idea was say,</p>
<p>you have an island where everything&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>Calypso lives there, life is great.</p>
<p>People feed you grapes every day,</p>
<p>but maybe you can&rsquo;t do everything on the island.</p>
<p>And the ocean&rsquo;s big, it has everything,</p>
<p>but the ocean&rsquo;s got sea monsters and sharks</p>
<p>and Boaty McBoatface and all kinds of crazy stuff, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what Yella is about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically this bring LLVM into our world.</p>
<p>And at some point in the next three to five year time</p>
<p>horizon, we can bring modern programming languages in,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re gonna come in with all their flaws</p>
<p>and their warts and their problems.</p>
<p>And then the pond was the idea</p>
<p>of the Ethereum virtual machine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some network effect around it</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some great tooling</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s materialized and evolved.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not clear if that&rsquo;s the standard yet,</p>
<p>or if like MySpace or Blackberry</p>
<p>or all of these other things, it&rsquo;ll fade away.</p>
<p>Well, if it becomes the standard, okay,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t fight nature, just support it.</p>
<p>And the same thing that gives you the ability</p>
<p>to bolt on the LLVM will also give you the ability</p>
<p>to bolt on the EVM and they can run with their own models</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re encapsulated, bulkheaded, separated systems,</p>
<p>but you can move ADA applications,</p>
<p>information between those two systems.</p>
<p>And so your main chain will always stay</p>
<p>somewhat conservative and have the minimum viable amount</p>
<p>of expressiveness required on it</p>
<p>to do all kinds of interesting things.</p>
<p>And also for interoperability,</p>
<p>be able to talk to all kinds of interesting things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not trying to be everything to everyone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never gonna be an ice cream store in the island.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have the grapes and the beautiful women,</p>
<p>but no ice cream.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re just like distracting me with the ice cream.</p>
<p>So just for, because we&rsquo;ll throw around a bunch of terms,</p>
<p>for the record, what is Plutus?</p>
<p>So Plutus is a programming language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a DSL that we built on top of Haskell.</p>
<p>And basically we wrote it after spending about three years</p>
<p>thinking about all smart contracts.</p>
<p>We were trying to figure out like,</p>
<p>what is the ideal language to express a smart contract?</p>
<p>And then we started thinking, well,</p>
<p>what is a smart contract?</p>
<p>Is it the whole application,</p>
<p>or is it just like a sub module within an application?</p>
<p>And usually it&rsquo;s the latter more than the former.</p>
<p>You can build a self contained program like a script,</p>
<p>but usually what&rsquo;s happening is you&rsquo;ll have it</p>
<p>like a video game, let&rsquo;s say World of Warcraft</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>You say, hey, maybe I wanna actually create gold</p>
<p>in World of Warcraft that&rsquo;s actually a currency.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m gonna issue a token.</p>
<p>Well, and then maybe I wanna create some mechanics</p>
<p>behind how people are gonna trade that amongst each other.</p>
<p>So that would be like a smart contract layer</p>
<p>and issue an asset.</p>
<p>So you have this centralized server running</p>
<p>and proprietary software controlled by a single company,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;ve opened your application up</p>
<p>to a broader world.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;ve done now is added a blockchain layer</p>
<p>and the blockchain handles the accounting of that asset</p>
<p>and the spending policy of that stuff.</p>
<p>So that is a much smaller program</p>
<p>than what Blizzard is doing with World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>So the point of Plutus was let&rsquo;s create a language</p>
<p>where you can write these small to midsize programs</p>
<p>and have a high degree of confidence</p>
<p>that they behave with correctness</p>
<p>and also they give you deterministic results</p>
<p>on the consumption of resources.</p>
<p>You can run things locally</p>
<p>and you actually understand what it costs to run</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t change when you deploy it on the system.</p>
<p>If you dial up the expressiveness of the system</p>
<p>and like Ethereum does</p>
<p>and these big mutable account systems,</p>
<p>the problem is you have to have global state.</p>
<p>So whatever you test locally</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t actually necessarily translate</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;ve deployed, okay?</p>
<p>So we spent a long time asking</p>
<p>like where&rsquo;s the Goldilocks zone?</p>
<p>Bitcoin script was too restrictive</p>
<p>and every single time Satoshi tried to dial it up,</p>
<p>it led to mega problems.</p>
<p>Like there was a beautiful thing</p>
<p>called the value overflow incident in 2010,</p>
<p>which led to the creation of billions of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>They had to quickly clean that up</p>
<p>and sweep it under the rug</p>
<p>and pretend like it didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>But that was mostly because of an issue</p>
<p>with how the scripting language was implemented.</p>
<p>And when you look at Ethereum,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this pure game</p>
<p>of stomping down these skirmishers</p>
<p>where every update there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>they have to change or tune</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s not clear how you shard such a model.</p>
<p>So we said, let&rsquo;s build something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the middle of this</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what Plutus basically is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really designed to play very nicely</p>
<p>with off chain infrastructure</p>
<p>as much as on chain infrastructure.</p>
<p>So you can look at all those different examples,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Wolfram wants to auction off</p>
<p>their universes or Blizzard wants</p>
<p>to issue an in game currency</p>
<p>or your Uber and you wanna start putting</p>
<p>peer to peer dynamics inside your system,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna gracefully connect to that on chain code.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very clear how those two things connect together.</p>
<p>Just so happens Haskell&rsquo;s really good for this.</p>
<p>They have template Haskell</p>
<p>and it makes it very easy</p>
<p>to embed domain specific languages.</p>
<p>And it makes it very easy to wire your Haskell code</p>
<p>onto off chain infrastructure.</p>
<p>So in the future,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to have your off chain run a node</p>
<p>or the Java virtual machine or a.NET application</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll just be this beautiful interface</p>
<p>and then it can talk to all your on chain code</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s written in that DSL</p>
<p>and you have a high degree of assurance that it&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Is there like a Hello World program in Plutus</p>
<p>that reveals the beauty of this balance</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re referring to?</p>
<p>Sort of simple but not too simple, the Einstein idea?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we did do our first Hello World program</p>
<p>actually today.</p>
<p>Yeah, I heard about this.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you know,</p>
<p>there you&rsquo;d want to have the whole round trip.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d like to have an interaction</p>
<p>and I think a video game would probably show it the best.</p>
<p>Like if we could re implement CryptoKitties</p>
<p>or something like that on it</p>
<p>and you have this off chain infrastructure</p>
<p>and you have your GUI in your front end,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s running on your phone or a browser</p>
<p>and most of that lives off chain.</p>
<p>And then, but your CryptoKitties,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d live on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The whole round trip end to end</p>
<p>with relatively low fees and low latency</p>
<p>and high availability of service, it never goes down.</p>
<p>That would probably be the best thing to do</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have something like that by August.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty easy to build this stuff.</p>
<p>So what kind of off chain interactions</p>
<p>are supported with Plutus?</p>
<p>What are the limits you want to put on the thing</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t get chaotic?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beautiful thing.</p>
<p>When you have a less expressive model on chain,</p>
<p>it means you can do anything you want off chain.</p>
<p>So you started talking about smart contracts,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s zoom back out</p>
<p>and ask the big question here is what is a blockchain</p>
<p>and what is a cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>So a blockchain is just a ledger</p>
<p>and really it has three nice properties.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re timestamped, you&rsquo;re immutable and auditable,</p>
<p>either in a global or a local sense.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s all kinds of things mankind has invented</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>that when you put some information down,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t change and other people can see it</p>
<p>and that you know when it was put down.</p>
<p>For example, a property ledger.</p>
<p>So when you buy land or you have rights associated with land</p>
<p>like mineral rights or water rights or these things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d like to transitively see how does it go</p>
<p>from Alice to Bob to Charlie to Jim</p>
<p>and so forth and what was the state of these things</p>
<p>as they were transitioning?</p>
<p>So how much did they pay, when did it occur,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera, the metadata that follows that.</p>
<p>Okay, well normally these types of ledgers</p>
<p>are so important that they&rsquo;re managed either by governments</p>
<p>or regulated entities.</p>
<p>And the issues are that while they can be efficient,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re generally brittle to political manipulation</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re brittle to geopolitical events.</p>
<p>For example, when Syria fell apart,</p>
<p>the very first thing ISIS did, they started saying,</p>
<p>hey, the ownership of the land,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna fundamentally change.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve decided that this guy over here</p>
<p>now owns all these things and then when peace comes,</p>
<p>how do you unwind all of that, put it all back together?</p>
<p>So the power of a blockchain is that it gives you</p>
<p>a transnational way of sorting all these details out,</p>
<p>putting all together in a place that you know</p>
<p>that even if it&rsquo;s inconvenient to a very powerful actor,</p>
<p>that it will still stay preserved.</p>
<p>This is an asymmetry we haven&rsquo;t had as a society.</p>
<p>Usually kings and empires,</p>
<p>they have the ability to decide what&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And then suddenly you have this asymmetrical thing</p>
<p>that is above them, kind of like a synthetic laws of physics</p>
<p>and once something goes in there,</p>
<p>you know that that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s the first part of it.</p>
<p>The second part of it is that it&rsquo;s auditable,</p>
<p>meaning that instead of saying only the high cleric</p>
<p>or the president or some very special club of people</p>
<p>get to see what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>suddenly now all the people can actually see</p>
<p>who owns what where.</p>
<p>Like imagine a tax system where the public club</p>
<p>just leaked the taxes of all these different billionaires</p>
<p>and said, well, how much do they make</p>
<p>and how much do they pay?</p>
<p>Well, imagine a tax system where that&rsquo;s just done by default</p>
<p>or other social systems where this type of information</p>
<p>is put in by default.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s tremendously useful, this type of structure</p>
<p>and all kinds of things, medical records, supply chains,</p>
<p>just a good thought experiment is I travel a lot,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to 52 countries in the last five years.</p>
<p>Imagine if I got sick in Zimbabwe,</p>
<p>I get hit by a car or something and I&rsquo;m unconscious</p>
<p>and a Zimbabwean doctor calls my doctor in Colorado</p>
<p>and says, hey, I need all Charles&rsquo;s medical records.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s unconscious right now, but I need it to treat him</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s quite ill.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d say, who is this person in Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know you, I can&rsquo;t give you his records,</p>
<p>I need his consent.</p>
<p>Oh no, he&rsquo;s unconscious in the hospital, I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Well, a broker system that would allow the movement</p>
<p>of medical records would be an example</p>
<p>of what a blockchain could potentially do</p>
<p>in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is just an application</p>
<p>that runs on top of blockchain</p>
<p>because it turns out that when you issue property,</p>
<p>you also can issue tokens of value</p>
<p>and then you could have a monetary policy,</p>
<p>it could be inflationary or deflationary,</p>
<p>you know, demurrage where it decays over time</p>
<p>or whatever have you.</p>
<p>And the very same mechanics that would ensure</p>
<p>your property records are secure,</p>
<p>your medical record access is secure,</p>
<p>could also be applied for the ownership</p>
<p>of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>And again, you can either be completely transparent</p>
<p>and everybody can see what everybody owns</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what Bitcoin does,</p>
<p>or you can be as opaque as you seek to be,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what Zcash basically attempts to do.</p>
<p>It says, hey, let&rsquo;s keep these things</p>
<p>as private as possible.</p>
<p>But they have relatively the same mechanics</p>
<p>in terms of those properties of auditability</p>
<p>and timestamping and immutability.</p>
<p>You know things won&rsquo;t be reversed,</p>
<p>you know, that people aren&rsquo;t gonna manipulate</p>
<p>the timestamps and you can audit at least enough</p>
<p>to know that the ownership is right.</p>
<p>But the way, if you think about physics and the universe,</p>
<p>the universe has figured out a way</p>
<p>to update the ledger of physics</p>
<p>in a way where like a lot of people can be updating it</p>
<p>and it stays consistent.</p>
<p>Is there something you can say about the task</p>
<p>of updating the ledger when a bunch of people</p>
<p>are trying to do it or a bunch of entities</p>
<p>are trying to do it?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s the whole point of a consensus algorithm.</p>
<p>So whatever ledger you&rsquo;re running,</p>
<p>there has to be some mechanism to decide who&rsquo;s in charge.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what proof of work does</p>
<p>and proof of stake does and all these other systems.</p>
<p>And you break them down to basically three steps.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ll use Eve for kind of step number one.</p>
<p>Hi, Eve, how are you doing?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna use Wally for step number two.</p>
<p>And I need the monkey, give me the monkey.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the monkey&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p>Daisy.</p>
<p>Daisy the monkey, okay.</p>
<p>I like Daisy.</p>
<p>Daisy is a very confused monkey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pondering its own mortality.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so anyway, the first step is all about</p>
<p>basically deciding who&rsquo;s in charge for that moment.</p>
<p>So blockchain is just a sequence of events.</p>
<p>The heart has to beat, the metronome has to click.</p>
<p>So somebody has to be in charge.</p>
<p>And so generally you have this notion of a resource.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some pool of resource out there</p>
<p>and it can be a token.</p>
<p>And in that case, it&rsquo;s a plutocratic system</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what proof of stake does</p>
<p>or it can be computation, but there can be other resources.</p>
<p>But computation is what proof of work does.</p>
<p>And so you make so many hashes</p>
<p>and then eventually somebody wins.</p>
<p>And that person who wins is now the person</p>
<p>who basically gets to decide the order of transactions</p>
<p>and put them all together</p>
<p>from their perspective in the system.</p>
<p>Then once that person wins, they&rsquo;ll make the block.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s step two.</p>
<p>And after it&rsquo;s made, transmit it</p>
<p>and it gets validated and accepted.</p>
<p>So actually it&rsquo;s quite fortuitous</p>
<p>you have the magnifying glass</p>
<p>because at this stage people are trying to decide</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m looking at correct or not.</p>
<p>Now, there are other ways to potentially conceive of this,</p>
<p>but this particular model gives you a kind of a way</p>
<p>of thinking of all consensus algorithms in one setting.</p>
<p>You can be Algorand, you can be a classic BFT protocol,</p>
<p>you can be Paxos, you can be Raft,</p>
<p>you can be proof of work, you can be proof of stake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the same idea.</p>
<p>You have to find someone or some group to be in charge.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll reach a consensus on order.</p>
<p>They have to then do some work,</p>
<p>change the state of the system, update it,</p>
<p>and then the network has to accept that that&rsquo;s valid.</p>
<p>So even if this process works well,</p>
<p>this side will say,</p>
<p>oh, you created a Bitcoin at a thin air,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed to do that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s rejected.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s checks and balances and guards all the way through.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a meta question of fairness in all of this.</p>
<p>So the proof of work people, they&rsquo;re kind of a cult</p>
<p>and they say that this is the only truth</p>
<p>and everything out here,</p>
<p>any other resource is not legitimate or valid.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not a lot of evidence to that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what they believe.</p>
<p>The proof of stake people,</p>
<p>the downside and weakness they have</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a plutocratic model.</p>
<p>The more ownership of the system you have,</p>
<p>the more control you have over that system.</p>
<p>And it suffers from the same thing</p>
<p>that shareholder models suffer from,</p>
<p>whereas you may maximize short term gain</p>
<p>over the long term viability of the system.</p>
<p>So a really cool question is,</p>
<p>can you build systems that are multi resource?</p>
<p>So instead of just pulling from one resource</p>
<p>to select who wins,</p>
<p>this 25% of the time and maybe this 25%, you can do that.</p>
<p>In fact, the cryptocurrency space did that a long time ago.</p>
<p>There was a cryptocurrency called Peercoin in 2011,</p>
<p>and it was a hybrid proof of work proof of stake.</p>
<p>So some of the blocks were made</p>
<p>with the token ownership distribution</p>
<p>and some of the blocks were made with proof of work,</p>
<p>but you could keep adding.</p>
<p>You could put in like, hey, I want hard disk in my thing.</p>
<p>You can put Permacoin in or something like that.</p>
<p>So it created incentive for hard drives.</p>
<p>And then you could say, oh no,</p>
<p>I want to do like a human system, like a proof of merit.</p>
<p>Oh my God, now we&rsquo;re up to four.</p>
<p>And you just keep adding.</p>
<p>And each of these pools will have different adherence</p>
<p>and actors, and then you can actually balance out</p>
<p>the whole thing.</p>
<p>So as opposed to having one cult, you have many cults.</p>
<p>Exactly. And they argue.</p>
<p>And the cults argue with each other</p>
<p>and we call that a government.</p>
<p>By the way, not all cults are bad.</p>
<p>Physics is a cult too.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sometimes bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s honest at least.</p>
<p>Nature is a cult.</p>
<p>Nature is metal, I saw it on Instagram.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really the crux of it.</p>
<p>You have a ledger and the ledger is just all about saying,</p>
<p>hey, we need to put some stuff in here.</p>
<p>And once it&rsquo;s put in here, you can&rsquo;t turn it back.</p>
<p>And you know when it was put in and everybody can see it</p>
<p>or some group can see it.</p>
<p>And then you need to pick somebody to modify that.</p>
<p>So all this chaos will happen.</p>
<p>All these transactions are all around the world</p>
<p>and our perception of them are different.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful paper from Lamport</p>
<p>that kind of talks about this from the 70s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one of the most classic papers ever</p>
<p>in computer science.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s been cited like 50,000 times</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a crazy paper.</p>
<p>But basically you have to figure out,</p>
<p>okay, well, somebody has to be in charge.</p>
<p>Some group has to be in charge.</p>
<p>And you can do it with a meritocratic,</p>
<p>hashocratic computation thing.</p>
<p>You can say, well, if you have coins 25% of supply,</p>
<p>25% of the time on average,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be selected to have the right to do this</p>
<p>or give it to somebody else.</p>
<p>Or you could search for other resources.</p>
<p>And they can even be human resources,</p>
<p>like some notion of merit or social benefit.</p>
<p>Maybe you get a token for that</p>
<p>and you can weight it with these other systems.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where kind of where everything&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting to a point where we&rsquo;ve really optimized</p>
<p>all the properties here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve proven all these nice things about it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of competition</p>
<p>to basically build like the perfect proof of stake system,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re Polkadot or Algorand</p>
<p>or any of these other guys.</p>
<p>But now the next step is say, well,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we just have one?</p>
<p>We should have multiple resources.</p>
<p>And the point is each of these</p>
<p>has different trade off profiles.</p>
<p>And so they balance each other</p>
<p>and you end up building a much more resilient system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not winner take all with one particular demand.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a million questions</p>
<p>that spring up right there.</p>
<p>But first linger on this topic and say,</p>
<p>what is proof of work?</p>
<p>What is proof of stake?</p>
<p>Just zooming in on each of those.</p>
<p>And what are the differences?</p>
<p>Okay, so they all have the same three properties</p>
<p>of pick someone in charge, do something and validate it.</p>
<p>The difference is that the picking mechanism for proof</p>
<p>of work is you have to solve a puzzle.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically like buying lottery tickets</p>
<p>and you can buy a certain amount every second</p>
<p>with your computing devices.</p>
<p>And some of them are ASIC resistant.</p>
<p>So you run them on like a laptop or a GPU.</p>
<p>And some of them are you specialized hardware</p>
<p>that you have to either manufacturer</p>
<p>or buy from someone who sells it to you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just how many tickets per second you can get.</p>
<p>And eventually you hit those magic numbers.</p>
<p>When you do, it means you have the right to make the block</p>
<p>and generally you bundle the block making</p>
<p>with the proof of work system.</p>
<p>Now you can do this looking for a single</p>
<p>or you can do this to actually shard it</p>
<p>and look for multiple block makers at the same time.</p>
<p>So there are sharded proof of work protocols</p>
<p>like Prism is an example of that.</p>
<p>And actually Ethereum got started this way</p>
<p>with Spectre and Ghost and Phantom,</p>
<p>the Aviz Ahar&rsquo;s work and Yonatan Sonlopinsky.</p>
<p>But the basic idea is you pick some collection of people,</p>
<p>they make some collection of things</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some way to sort it all out,</p>
<p>serialize it and prevent double spends, great.</p>
<p>Proof of stake is the same, but it&rsquo;s a synthetic resource.</p>
<p>So instead of doing things, they say,</p>
<p>well, if you had 25% of the hash power on average</p>
<p>over a long period of time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably win 25% of the time.</p>
<p>Well, why don&rsquo;t we just introduce some randomness in</p>
<p>from some source and then 25% of the time on average</p>
<p>over a long period of time, you&rsquo;ll win.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a synthetic resource,</p>
<p>but you still have to do the other two things.</p>
<p>You still have to make the block</p>
<p>and you still have to validate the block.</p>
<p>The big difference is this step in the proof of work world</p>
<p>is horrendously expensive.</p>
<p>You use more energy than the nation of Switzerland.</p>
<p>And the problem with that is that you have less resources</p>
<p>for the other two.</p>
<p>And the other problem with that is that</p>
<p>if this is horrendously expensive,</p>
<p>you have an economy of scale kick in.</p>
<p>So what ends up happening is the system becomes</p>
<p>less decentralized over time</p>
<p>because you have these vertically integrated operations.</p>
<p>I mean, not everybody can go build a mining facility</p>
<p>on a volcano in El Salvador.</p>
<p>Not everybody can go to Mongolia</p>
<p>and set up a five gigawatt power plant</p>
<p>and a huge data thing.</p>
<p>Not everybody has access to the patented basics</p>
<p>that people produce.</p>
<p>Because what if I don&rsquo;t sell it to you</p>
<p>and I have the patent on it?</p>
<p>Or what if I control the supply chain for these things?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll end up having centralization around maybe 10</p>
<p>or five major operations as we&rsquo;ve seen historically</p>
<p>with proof of work.</p>
<p>And that means you end up having like a ruling class</p>
<p>of a mining oligarchy in the system.</p>
<p>Proof of stake, if you design the parameters correctly,</p>
<p>you actually get more decentralized over time</p>
<p>because as the currency goes up in value,</p>
<p>the distribution of the currency</p>
<p>tends to get more egalitarian.</p>
<p>For example, Bill Gates, when he started Microsoft,</p>
<p>he had 64% of the shares.</p>
<p>Now he has less than 5% of the shares.</p>
<p>So this founder drift over time,</p>
<p>as the value goes up, divestment occurs,</p>
<p>you have more and more and more people coming in.</p>
<p>That means there&rsquo;s more people</p>
<p>who can participate in the consensus.</p>
<p>You can even tune economic parameters.</p>
<p>And this is what we did with Cardano and Ouroboros.</p>
<p>We created this concept of K in the system</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a parameter.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a forcing factor</p>
<p>that tends to accumulate a certain amount of stake pools.</p>
<p>So you can set it to 200 and then 500 and 1000 and so forth.</p>
<p>But the basic idea is as the price of ADA goes up,</p>
<p>you make K larger and then you end up in practical terms</p>
<p>having a larger and larger set of actors making blocks</p>
<p>that are unique and distinct.</p>
<p>And the other good thing is this is a virtual resource</p>
<p>instead of a physical resource,</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s portable by the click of a button.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say China says, mining is bad,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna shut it all down.</p>
<p>And it looks like they&rsquo;re moving in that direction.</p>
<p>You have all these people in WeChat,</p>
<p>just like trying to sell miners</p>
<p>or trying to figure out how the hell do I move miners,</p>
<p>because they have these huge data centers</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve constructed.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t exactly go and grab a server</p>
<p>and like take it with you, it&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of work.</p>
<p>And if the government sees it,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s their property now.</p>
<p>A virtual resource, you can click a button</p>
<p>and redeploy it to a different jurisdiction.</p>
<p>So to me, for a virtual asset,</p>
<p>it makes a lot more sense to try to tie your security</p>
<p>to something endogenous, something within the system,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just like the asset,</p>
<p>it can move anywhere at a click of a button</p>
<p>and human beings have a much harder time</p>
<p>attacking something like that.</p>
<p>Well, so people, maybe you could sort of play devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p>and say, what is the strength of proof of work system?</p>
<p>Because some people would argue that proof of work has,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s outside the system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tied to physical resources, it&rsquo;s more secure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less prone to attack by large groups of people.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And the first question we had was,</p>
<p>could proof of stake actually work or not?</p>
<p>So the problem was that the engineers kind of led</p>
<p>when the science should have led.</p>
<p>And so there were all these POS protocols</p>
<p>that came out in the early 2010s,</p>
<p>like Peercoin was the first and then NXT and others came out.</p>
<p>And there they had suffered from things</p>
<p>like the random number generation wasn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>They had grinding attacks and nothing at stake</p>
<p>and all these other things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of beautiful properties</p>
<p>for proof of work from a theoretical sense.</p>
<p>We even wrote a paper called GKL,</p>
<p>named after the authors, Juan Gray, Niko Leonardis</p>
<p>and Agelos Gassis, our chief scientist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got 1100 citations now and it was published in 2015.</p>
<p>But basically all it did is just model the blockchain</p>
<p>and created some security properties for it.</p>
<p>And then it started talking about,</p>
<p>well, what does proof of work actually do for you?</p>
<p>And it turns out it does a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an asynchronous system.</p>
<p>You can bootstrap from Genesis.</p>
<p>So if Eve joins the network and Wally joins the network</p>
<p>and Daisy joined the network,</p>
<p>then you give them some different chains,</p>
<p>like five or 10 different chains.</p>
<p>They can run a calculation</p>
<p>and they will always pick the longest chain,</p>
<p>the heaviest chain inside the system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great property of proof of work.</p>
<p>Until we published Ouroboros Genesis in 2018,</p>
<p>you actually needed to solve that in proof of stake</p>
<p>with a trusted checkpoint.</p>
<p>So some actor had to be observing,</p>
<p>watching the whole thing and creating checkpoints.</p>
<p>And then when new people joined in,</p>
<p>they would only be able to distinguish between a chain</p>
<p>based upon a checkpoint telling them that.</p>
<p>So you have to do a lot of really wonky, crazy math</p>
<p>to show and create this notion of like density</p>
<p>to be able to show that that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of properties of proof of work</p>
<p>that were super hard to replicate and emulate</p>
<p>in the proof of stake world.</p>
<p>Macaulay kind of revolutionized the whole VRF thing.</p>
<p>There was a group out of Cornell</p>
<p>that talked about better network conditions.</p>
<p>They wrote a paper called Sleepy.</p>
<p>We did Genesis.</p>
<p>We also did the very first proofably secure protocol,</p>
<p>but that was six years of work and like 12 papers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still not done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a few polishing things</p>
<p>that have to be cleaned up</p>
<p>because this is a physical resource</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a flaw to proof of work</p>
<p>that is a little problematic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a winner take all type of a system.</p>
<p>So maximalism is kind of philosophically</p>
<p>and computationally built into it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have two proof of work systems</p>
<p>and they have roughly the same market cap and hash rate.</p>
<p>And they use the same algorithm.</p>
<p>Then the problem is if the miner comes in</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say the miner has enough resources</p>
<p>to have 51% for any of these chains,</p>
<p>they actually have a perverse incentive</p>
<p>to come and destroy one chain</p>
<p>and short sell the asset, it&rsquo;s called a gold finger attack,</p>
<p>and then go mine the other asset</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not bound to that asset.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not loyal to it.</p>
<p>And they can make just as much profit mining this</p>
<p>as they can make mining the other system</p>
<p>and the markets allow them to profit</p>
<p>from the destruction of a system.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that proof of stake doesn&rsquo;t suffer from</p>
<p>because the only way you can participate</p>
<p>in a proof of stake system</p>
<p>is you have to actually own equity</p>
<p>and you have to have ownership in that system.</p>
<p>So if you go and destroy Daisy&rsquo;s chain, it would just be</p>
<p>a net loss for the most part,</p>
<p>unless you have really messed up markets</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always trade offs and all these things.</p>
<p>And this is why I like this concept of going one to end</p>
<p>and having multiple resources,</p>
<p>because why not have proof of work</p>
<p>and proof of stake together?</p>
<p>If the proof of work is useful, not wasted computation,</p>
<p>and why not add other things</p>
<p>like create incentives for network relay?</p>
<p>Right now there&rsquo;s no incentives in the system</p>
<p>for you to run peer to peer nodes and the shared data.</p>
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s not a problem,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re running like Amazon web services</p>
<p>level of bandwidth,</p>
<p>it could cost you like $5,000 a month in bandwidth</p>
<p>just to run a full node or something like that.</p>
<p>No one would do it.</p>
<p>So then your system will centralize along the weakest link,</p>
<p>whether it be the storage layer, the computation layer,</p>
<p>or the network layer of the system.</p>
<p>So if you can incentivize the resources differently,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll be in a beautiful position</p>
<p>where you end up having a resilient system</p>
<p>that pays its own bills.</p>
<p>So how does Cardano solve the consensus problem?</p>
<p>Do you tend to eventually wanting to solve it</p>
<p>in the hybrid approach of proof of stake and proof of work?</p>
<p>Yeah, this was a philosophical difference</p>
<p>between Vitalik and myself.</p>
<p>The problem with the people in the Ethereum side</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re really bright.</p>
<p>And these really bright people,</p>
<p>what they do is they try to do everything all at once</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re really, really smart</p>
<p>and they keep going until they run up against the wall</p>
<p>and they realize the problem is a lot harder.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re more experienced,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why we brought in proper academics</p>
<p>like Aggelos and others, because they&rsquo;ve been beaten up</p>
<p>through life, Aggelos worked with David Chom</p>
<p>and these other, it&rsquo;s really hard work with those guys.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d already been humiliated and yelled at</p>
<p>and had chalk thrown at them and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And so they were humble enough to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not smart enough to solve the big problem.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t even try.</p>
<p>What you do is you decompose it and you say, okay,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the first problem to solve in a chain of problems</p>
<p>that you can compose your way up to a working system?</p>
<p>And once you get far enough along,</p>
<p>you have something that&rsquo;s pretty good</p>
<p>and then you have an obvious path forward</p>
<p>of how do you iterate and improve that system?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we started with GKL 15,</p>
<p>because it was just saying,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what a fucking blockchain is.</p>
<p>This is, what is this thing, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the security properties of this stuff?</p>
<p>Like, what did we really mean?</p>
<p>Then we did Ouroboros Classic,</p>
<p>the original Ouroboros protocol in 2017.</p>
<p>And that protocol was like a synchronous system</p>
<p>and it assumed the nodes were always on and it worked,</p>
<p>but it was useless because that&rsquo;s not real life.</p>
<p>Then Prowse came out and then suddenly we relaxed things.</p>
<p>So these are all, by the way,</p>
<p>names for consensus algorithms.</p>
<p>Yeah, papers that we published</p>
<p>and they were all peer reviewed.</p>
<p>Like GKL was EuroCrypt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very hard conference to get into.</p>
<p>And Ouroboros Classic was Crypto</p>
<p>and Prowse was EuroCrypt and Genesis was CCS.</p>
<p>So basically every step of the way</p>
<p>was first an academic validation</p>
<p>that there was some merit to the work that was done.</p>
<p>Second, it solved a particular class of problems,</p>
<p>either showing the feasibility of the entire problem.</p>
<p>Because when I said, let&rsquo;s do the model first</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s see if we can do an FLP thing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can get them a possibility theorem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great because you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like those short math papers</p>
<p>were like, I found a counterexample.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, okay, this whole thing has fallen apart</p>
<p>because you have a two line proof, thank you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we were looking for</p>
<p>in the beginning of the agenda was,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s either prove it&rsquo;s possible in a straw man case</p>
<p>or show that there exists an impossibility result,</p>
<p>in which case we can just abandon the entire inquiry.</p>
<p>Proof of stake is impossible.</p>
<p>And then once you&rsquo;ve gotten past that threshold,</p>
<p>it goes from theory to practicality.</p>
<p>What actual network conditions are you looking at?</p>
<p>Are you okay with living with an external clock</p>
<p>or do you wanna build time from within?</p>
<p>How are you generating random numbers, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And every step of the way, each paper,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re solving one particular class of problems.</p>
<p>With Prism, it said, probably shouldn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>ahead of time who Eve is.</p>
<p>You probably shouldn&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s making those blocks.</p>
<p>That should be something after the fact.</p>
<p>But if you know ahead of time, you can attack them.</p>
<p>You can DDoS them, you cause all kinds of problems.</p>
<p>So adaptive security, also we moved from an MPC,</p>
<p>random number generation, which was great,</p>
<p>but very heavy and very slow.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t scale to large amounts of people</p>
<p>to a VRF based system, which is super fast,</p>
<p>but a little dirtier.</p>
<p>Because Algorand actually did some great work there.</p>
<p>There was some good knowledge there.</p>
<p>What are the really hard problems that you,</p>
<p>maybe if you just linger on a little bit,</p>
<p>what are some of the really hard problems</p>
<p>you have to solve along this chain of papers, ideas,</p>
<p>the evolution of the consensus algorithm?</p>
<p>Yeah, not only are they really hard problems,</p>
<p>they actually require different cryptographers</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re moving from mathematician style cryptographers</p>
<p>like the Neil Koblitz&rsquo;s and the Addie Shamir&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and the people that like start as proper mathematicians.</p>
<p>They really love theory and that&rsquo;s their thing.</p>
<p>And the proofs are dense and they&rsquo;re thick</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re beautiful to practical applied work</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re saying, okay,</p>
<p>now this is something an engineer can look at</p>
<p>and say, I know how to build that.</p>
<p>I know how to think about that.</p>
<p>So that transition from GKL to Ouroboros Classic</p>
<p>to Prowse, I&rsquo;d say the biggest leap was Classic to Prowse</p>
<p>because that was going from a system</p>
<p>that would only work in a consortium chain like Fabric</p>
<p>to a system that would actually work and is working.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s implementing Cardano today,</p>
<p>50 billion dollar cryptocurrency and all these people.</p>
<p>That was a huge leap, but that paper alone wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>We also had to layer on the economic model</p>
<p>because we said, well, hang on a second here.</p>
<p>Not everybody&rsquo;s gonna be online all the time</p>
<p>to be available to make a block.</p>
<p>So you need some notion of delegation.</p>
<p>The minute you have a notion of delegation,</p>
<p>you have these stake pools, what the hell does that mean?</p>
<p>And so this is a beautiful kind of interdisciplinary notion</p>
<p>that layers computer science and biology together.</p>
<p>And minute that complexity starts going up,</p>
<p>you start seeing cell specialization.</p>
<p>So you go from single cell organisms to organisms</p>
<p>where you have eyeballs and brains and hearts</p>
<p>and each of these tissues do different things.</p>
<p>Well, analogously, complex distributed systems</p>
<p>start getting specialization.</p>
<p>You move from the single cell thing, Bitcoin,</p>
<p>where everything&rsquo;s a full node,</p>
<p>they all have the same rights and responsibilities,</p>
<p>a lot of homogeneity in that system,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re only as good as your weakest link,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only as capable as whatever the basic cell can do</p>
<p>to a specialized system where you start having</p>
<p>these actors in the system that are actually</p>
<p>a little different than the other actors.</p>
<p>So you introduce this concept of the stake pool</p>
<p>and suddenly now you have this actor</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re probably gonna be online 24 seven.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably gonna have extra relay infrastructure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a trust relationship where you don&rsquo;t own the ADA,</p>
<p>but you have a right to use it for something.</p>
<p>And a person&rsquo;s made that choice to endow you with that.</p>
<p>The minute that you introduce specialization though,</p>
<p>the system gets more complicated,</p>
<p>the game theory gets more complicated.</p>
<p>And then you start having to think really deeply</p>
<p>and carefully about, okay, well,</p>
<p>can this now introduce a new attack vector</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t have before?</p>
<p>So that leap from classic to Prowse</p>
<p>and adding in stake pools and figuring out</p>
<p>how to handle the game theory there was exceedingly hard.</p>
<p>It took two years to do that.</p>
<p>So stake pools allow for multiple parties</p>
<p>to delegate their staking capabilities to others.</p>
<p>Can you describe a little bit how this works?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a super simple concept.</p>
<p>So you register a pool and then the pool is there</p>
<p>and basically they advertise</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually registered on chain with a certificate.</p>
<p>And then in the wallet software itself,</p>
<p>you can see all of the pools that have registered.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s over 3000 of them now inside the system.</p>
<p>And then you can click a little tile</p>
<p>and it shows you all the metadata that&rsquo;s in the certificate</p>
<p>and says, hey, I have my own pool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called rats, king of the rats.</p>
<p>So you can see all this stuff that&rsquo;s described there</p>
<p>and pools have an operating fee</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re like a business.</p>
<p>And they say, well, if you delegate to me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll charge this much.</p>
<p>So if you get like a hundred bucks in rewards,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you 90 and I&rsquo;ll take 10 or something like that.</p>
<p>And then you make your decision</p>
<p>and whichever one you select, you click delegate,</p>
<p>push the button and then you have now given</p>
<p>your staking rights to them until revoked.</p>
<p>Okay, so it lives there.</p>
<p>And then the stake pools weight in the system</p>
<p>is proportional to the amount of stake</p>
<p>that they have delegated to them.</p>
<p>And then we have this other limiting factor K,</p>
<p>which says that you get diminishing returns</p>
<p>with the more stake you have.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like an S function.</p>
<p>So you kind of go up and up and then eventually caps</p>
<p>and then at some point you get no rewards</p>
<p>beyond a certain threshold.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an incentive to split pools</p>
<p>to different owners after some point.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so that&rsquo;s a complex thing</p>
<p>and you have to actually model the game theory out</p>
<p>to understand where those parameters should be set.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t know how to do that.</p>
<p>So what we did is we bought talent.</p>
<p>We went to Oxford and we hired this guy</p>
<p>named Elias Kasupis, he&rsquo;s an algorithmic game theorist.</p>
<p>We said, hey, would you like to do some game theory work</p>
<p>in crypto?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, that sounds fun.</p>
<p>So he spent a year and a half,</p>
<p>we built all these beautiful models</p>
<p>and we kind of figured out what those curves</p>
<p>needed to look like.</p>
<p>So figure out like the S curve that would result</p>
<p>in a nice distribution of responsibility.</p>
<p>So not everybody delegates to the king of the rats.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>How does it feel to be royalty, by the way?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a very impressive kingdom,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re nevertheless a king.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it, because I think it&rsquo;s the kindest thing</p>
<p>people call me in this space.</p>
<p>Yeah, people love you.</p>
<p>So, okay, so that, I mean, so is that,</p>
<p>would you say a solved problem?</p>
<p>The game theory of stake pools?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the starting, and I was getting back</p>
<p>to my original point that you build things in iterations.</p>
<p>Every step, if you&rsquo;ve done it right,</p>
<p>is an invitation for 10 more sexy, fascinating,</p>
<p>fun problems.</p>
<p>And this is why we have such a great time building labs.</p>
<p>We started in Edinburgh, now we&rsquo;re at Tokyo Tech</p>
<p>and University of Wyoming and Athens,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re setting up more labs this year.</p>
<p>And all these academics wanna work with us,</p>
<p>hey, because we write a lot of really fascinating papers,</p>
<p>but B, because we&rsquo;re focused on all these really cool,</p>
<p>sexy, interdisciplinary problems.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually running into problems</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t even know where to publish the paper.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ll have this paper where there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>these PL guys working with crypto guys,</p>
<p>working with systems guys, working with economists.</p>
<p>And you put it all together</p>
<p>and you have this Frankenstein paper monster,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like, where do we submit this?</p>
<p>Where does this go?</p>
<p>Nature.</p>
<p>Yeah, there we go.</p>
<p>Nature or quanta or something, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll write a nice little.</p>
<p>So the sexy problems multiply exponentially.</p>
<p>Exactly, and we&rsquo;ve now gotten to a point</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re starting to work on refinements to the system</p>
<p>rather than fundamental things that are like,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t solve it, the system just simply doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>For example, you can run all of this with NTP</p>
<p>as your clock server,</p>
<p>but you actually can create a notion of time with N.</p>
<p>We wrote a paper called the Workforce Chronos for that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not necessary for the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a nice to have thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice property.</p>
<p>Optimization of the random number generation</p>
<p>is another example of that.</p>
<p>You can run it with a heavier thing.</p>
<p>You just have more blockchain bloat</p>
<p>and slower time and transition.</p>
<p>We have this concept in Epic.</p>
<p>So you elect leaders to run the system</p>
<p>every five days with Cardano,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s been derivative work.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t even do this.</p>
<p>This work occurred at University of Illinois.</p>
<p>And that derivative work said,</p>
<p>well, you don&rsquo;t actually need to do that.</p>
<p>You can do it on a block by block basis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, ooh, that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the other point about doing things</p>
<p>in a very rigorous way is that that way</p>
<p>creates a lingua franca for what you&rsquo;re trying to solve</p>
<p>with the totality of the academic community.</p>
<p>So suddenly people that you&rsquo;ve never met,</p>
<p>you know nothing about have read your papers,</p>
<p>cited your papers and start writing their own papers,</p>
<p>either to try to attack and destroy things you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>or to build on top of the things that you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>So people are trying to figure out ways to attack this.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>As rigorous as you are trying to build up.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have to pay them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beautiful thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to try to destroy</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how we grow stronger.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s how you build your career too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of people that they&rsquo;ve gotten tenure</p>
<p>just kicking the hell out of Intel SGX.</p>
<p>You go to CCS every year, there&rsquo;s some guy there</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s having a hell of a time making Intel cry.</p>
<p>Can we pull back historically speaking</p>
<p>and in terms of the big picture</p>
<p>of cryptocurrency real quick</p>
<p>and ask the question, what is Cardano?</p>
<p>We started talking about already</p>
<p>the consensus algorithm Cardano takes.</p>
<p>But maybe when you look at the history books,</p>
<p>you know, sort of a Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</p>
<p>and Cardano will have one sentence.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that one sentence going to be?</p>
<p>And in general, what&rsquo;s like the vision</p>
<p>in the context of the history of cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>You have like this whiteboard overview video</p>
<p>that you talk about the three generations of cryptocurrency</p>
<p>where Cardano is the third.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like five different questions</p>
<p>way of asking the exact same thing you can answer</p>
<p>however the hell you want.</p>
<p>You know, I always termed Cardano as like a FOSS,</p>
<p>a financial operating system and nobody likes it</p>
<p>and everybody picks on me for using that term.</p>
<p>But basically the idea is that, you know,</p>
<p>the world runs on systems, especially the financial world.</p>
<p>You have, you know, the BIS and Swift</p>
<p>and all this other stuff.</p>
<p>And these protocols allow you to move value around</p>
<p>and represent things like identity.</p>
<p>And allow you to express yourself in some way.</p>
<p>And those protocols for the most part work well</p>
<p>for people in rich countries.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t work so well</p>
<p>for people who aren&rsquo;t in rich countries.</p>
<p>And so the point of what we do, or at least what I do</p>
<p>and what my company does is we think a lot about</p>
<p>how do we build a universal protocol</p>
<p>that does all the stuff the legacy system has</p>
<p>but just does it better, faster and cheaper</p>
<p>for everybody in the world.</p>
<p>And everybody has equal access to it, you know?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the people&rsquo;s protocol.</p>
<p>You know, you have a situation where the guy in Senegal</p>
<p>has the same access that I do or Bill Gates does</p>
<p>or someone else who&rsquo;s kind of higher</p>
<p>on the spectrum of wealth and power.</p>
<p>And so that is what we seek to achieve.</p>
<p>But then the question is well, is Cardano the solution?</p>
<p>You know, is that that thing?</p>
<p>And the answer is no,</p>
<p>because you need a lot more evolution.</p>
<p>You need decades of evolution</p>
<p>to kind of work your way there.</p>
<p>And in many ways the work is never quite done</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s better than what came before.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you have a realization that first</p>
<p>the control of the system needs to be more balanced</p>
<p>and nuanced and it needs to be more democratic.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this sustainability component</p>
<p>of who&rsquo;s in charge and how do you pay for things?</p>
<p>Well, the system can print its own money</p>
<p>so it always has the ability to have a budget.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a treasury idea.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a voting thing.</p>
<p>Well, the same things that allow you to move money around</p>
<p>allow you to represent votes.</p>
<p>So you can do eVoting with the type of system, okay.</p>
<p>And you know, if you played Gnomic in the 1980s</p>
<p>or Peter Superfan or any of these things,</p>
<p>you can build a self evolving system.</p>
<p>You can actually create a game</p>
<p>where the rules can be voted on and changed</p>
<p>in the game itself, great.</p>
<p>Okay, so that exists there.</p>
<p>And then you say, okay, well,</p>
<p>but this thing still has to touch the legacy world.</p>
<p>There has to be cash in and cash out</p>
<p>and these types of things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just this interoperability thing</p>
<p>that you need a wifi or a Bluetooth moment for the industry</p>
<p>because nothing understands each other right now.</p>
<p>There are all these chains are blind, deaf</p>
<p>and dumb to each other.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this thing that it has to work</p>
<p>at a huge scale, like billions of people.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done that, but we&rsquo;ve done that</p>
<p>with large multinational trillion dollar companies</p>
<p>with centralized infrastructure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never really done that with one master protocol</p>
<p>that somehow does it for everyone.</p>
<p>The closest approximation is probably BitTorrent.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, you know, there was, it&rsquo;s a cool protocol,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have all the oomph necessary to,</p>
<p>necessary to do something like this.</p>
<p>So Cardano is just our first approximation</p>
<p>and like any good system,</p>
<p>we wanted it to be self evolving.</p>
<p>So once you get the philosophy out of where&rsquo;s the target</p>
<p>of what do you want to do, then you build a community.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s over a million people strong</p>
<p>and that community keeps growing</p>
<p>and they keep pushing the system</p>
<p>in that particular direction.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s nice about it is if you build the right philosophy</p>
<p>within the system, it doesn&rsquo;t need founders.</p>
<p>This is the great lesson of Satoshi.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need founders to be able to get there.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you look at the academic side,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very decentralized.</p>
<p>We have more than 30 different contributors</p>
<p>for the 105 papers and that set keeps growing</p>
<p>within the next five years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll probably be two, three, 400 different scientists</p>
<p>from all across the world, some from Russia</p>
<p>and some from India, some from China and some from Japan</p>
<p>and America and Africa and South America.</p>
<p>And the faces change, the languages change,</p>
<p>the cultures change, but the process stays the same.</p>
<p>And that is a permanent organ</p>
<p>within what we have constructed as a system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same situation entering marketplaces.</p>
<p>Like we entered Ethiopia, what are we doing there?</p>
<p>We have 5 million people in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting them digital identity</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re dragging that digital identity into the system.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s the most fundamental thing</p>
<p>of a financial operating system.</p>
<p>You need to know who people are</p>
<p>in order to be able to do business with them,</p>
<p>give them credit, be able to give them economic agency</p>
<p>and so the thing.</p>
<p>But once they&rsquo;re there,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to grow up with that system.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to deploy applications on that system.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to build on that system</p>
<p>or use it every day for getting a loan</p>
<p>or payments and so forth.</p>
<p>And if they have pain points,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re going to do is evolve that system</p>
<p>to be able to mitigate,</p>
<p>manage those particular pain points</p>
<p>to a point where the system is competitive for it.</p>
<p>So my job is to be,</p>
<p>we have this tagline in our company, cascading disruption.</p>
<p>My job is to be the first domino.</p>
<p>Just kind of knock it over and watch the cascade</p>
<p>and it kind of blows and blows and blows up</p>
<p>until eventually it gets to where we need to go.</p>
<p>And what I was trying to think about with Cardano</p>
<p>was how do you build the minimum viable set</p>
<p>of tools and social processes</p>
<p>that once we push the domino,</p>
<p>the system will just evolve to a point</p>
<p>where eventually you can grow to fill that need,</p>
<p>not out of charity, but out of self interest.</p>
<p>People want things better, faster, cheaper.</p>
<p>People want to have economic agency,</p>
<p>especially when they lack it.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to grow up in a world where they&rsquo;re unbanked</p>
<p>and they have no access to marketplaces.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna seek it.</p>
<p>Look at Mpesa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the great example of that, like cell phone minutes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using as a currency.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>And I say a few more years,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll have that rate minimum viable set of dynamics</p>
<p>inside the system.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s inevitable in my view</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;ll kind of grow and consume and become this concept.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really cool is there&rsquo;s competition</p>
<p>in the systems and concepts.</p>
<p>So China is trying to do the same thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying, how do we de dollarize the world</p>
<p>and create a digital Yuan?</p>
<p>So they have a very top down notion</p>
<p>of how to apply this technology and bring it in.</p>
<p>And they even have an identity system</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re building in parallel called social credit.</p>
<p>We have an identity system,</p>
<p>a talaprism that we&rsquo;re putting in.</p>
<p>Ours is bottom up and you own your own identity,</p>
<p>social credit.</p>
<p>You have no idea.</p>
<p>You just have a number and some computers giving it to you,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re both trying to do the exact same thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna be this clash of cultures at some point</p>
<p>between the open fosses</p>
<p>and the top down authoritarian fosses</p>
<p>and probably some Hegelian dialectic action to happen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll create some sort of somewhat closed,</p>
<p>somewhat authoritarian, libertarian utopia.</p>
<p>Yeah, most likely it would be AIs battling</p>
<p>in the space of fosses.</p>
<p>So I really like this idea of financial operating system,</p>
<p>but the letter F, so financial,</p>
<p>is this just a basic mechanism</p>
<p>with which you can have social interaction</p>
<p>therefore or all kinds of interactions</p>
<p>therefore have an identity?</p>
<p>Like is F essential to this?</p>
<p>Yeah, because that&rsquo;s how people care.</p>
<p>You need resources to survive.</p>
<p>And finances is kind of like this field</p>
<p>of managing your resources in an intelligent way.</p>
<p>And you could call it SOFI too, social finance.</p>
<p>The nomenclature hasn&rsquo;t exactly been settled</p>
<p>for our industry and that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>But basically the concept is that you have something</p>
<p>and you wanna be able to store it, transform it,</p>
<p>trade it and use it to survive.</p>
<p>And the question is what rails do you do that on?</p>
<p>Do you do those on centralized controlled rails</p>
<p>where there are these third parties</p>
<p>that are basically able to live off those things,</p>
<p>become very fat and nepotistic?</p>
<p>Or do you wanna do it on rails where there&rsquo;s no middleman?</p>
<p>You have a direct relationship</p>
<p>with whoever you&rsquo;re doing business</p>
<p>and if you invite more people into the transaction,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re middlemen of value, not necessity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the, I would like to say</p>
<p>the resident detra of our space,</p>
<p>that the reason we exist is to try to figure out a way</p>
<p>to kill the middleman and try to figure out a way</p>
<p>that we can better quantify value and transform it,</p>
<p>move it, manipulate it.</p>
<p>And in many ways we&rsquo;ve actually discovered</p>
<p>some amazing things in the last 10 years as an industry.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve kind of created the financial stem cell.</p>
<p>This idea of a token can now is just as well</p>
<p>be a national currency as a CBDC</p>
<p>as it can represent a crypto kitty.</p>
<p>The same architecture can do stuff at the nation scale,</p>
<p>can do stuff for a 12 year old kid in Texas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty amazing to see that.</p>
<p>But sort of in that whiteboard presentation,</p>
<p>you gave these three phases and you&rsquo;re kind of implying</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;ll be end phases to this whole evolution.</p>
<p>And Cardano is just like the cutting edge.</p>
<p>But if you look back to Bitcoin,</p>
<p>how would you compare Cardano versus Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Sort of where we are, how we started and how it&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>Okay, so what I did in that video and I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>in a lot of media interviews,</p>
<p>because I think it really helps people understand</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re at in the clock is face things</p>
<p>in terms of generations.</p>
<p>And so I said, well, the first generation is Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And really the problem Bitcoin was trying to solve</p>
<p>is saying every time we wanna represent or move value,</p>
<p>we need some sort of trusted third party to facilitate that.</p>
<p>So can we build some sort of system</p>
<p>where we can create some notion of value</p>
<p>that can be teleported around the world</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t require a trusted third party?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s done in a beautiful way</p>
<p>because it didn&rsquo;t try to be anything else.</p>
<p>It just was, you only have Bitcoin,</p>
<p>you can only do one type of thing, you can only push it.</p>
<p>You can do some things on the encumbrances</p>
<p>of like multi SIG and other things,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a one trick pony as a system.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t really clear if that was gonna work or not</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>It took several years to build up enough network effect</p>
<p>and for Bitcoins to actually become valuable.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say the inflection point was 2013.</p>
<p>And at that point it became a billion dollar market cap.</p>
<p>There were like Silicon Valley startups,</p>
<p>real exchanges performing.</p>
<p>And it got to a point where there was legitimacy</p>
<p>behind the concept and people started getting,</p>
<p>this is a really incredible idea</p>
<p>because I can evade capital controls with it.</p>
<p>I can like move $10 billion of something</p>
<p>from one country to another country in five minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I could never do that before.</p>
<p>And you know, this is incredible.</p>
<p>Okay, the problem is the minute that people validate</p>
<p>the idea, they immediately want something they don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So like the minute Elon can land a rocket,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the next big thing, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve landed the Falcon 9, now you&rsquo;re on the Starship.</p>
<p>Similarly, you say, okay,</p>
<p>I want programmability with this thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like when JavaScript came to the web browser,</p>
<p>you went from these static, perhaps pretty,</p>
<p>but ultimately static non interactive pages</p>
<p>to YouTube and Google and Facebook</p>
<p>and these amazing, rich, incredible experiences,</p>
<p>because now you can actually interact with the user.</p>
<p>You can program things, stuff runs on their side,</p>
<p>stuff runs on your side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful two way relationship.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what Ethereum effectively did.</p>
<p>They bolted a programming language onto a blockchain</p>
<p>and they went from a certain use case</p>
<p>to whatever your imagination can have,</p>
<p>you know, like sunshine and rainbows and unicorns</p>
<p>and these types of things.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is Bitcoin is HTML</p>
<p>and Ethereum is JavaScript?</p>
<p>Basically, yeah, it was like when JavaScript came</p>
<p>and with like JavaScript,</p>
<p>it has all kinds of problems and issues.</p>
<p>I wonder who&rsquo;s flash in this analogy, this metaphor,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s not go there.</p>
<p>Well, actually there were plenty of active Xs and flashes.</p>
<p>NXT was an example of a failed to start</p>
<p>and BitShares was another example.</p>
<p>There were a lot of people who tried to add some notion</p>
<p>of programmability in or a different view</p>
<p>of how these things should be done</p>
<p>and they were not as competitive.</p>
<p>Ethereum kind of came out at that JavaScript moment.</p>
<p>Okay, the minute you have that,</p>
<p>and suddenly you have ICOs and DeFi and STOs and NFTs</p>
<p>and all these word salads of things</p>
<p>and then people start using it, they get frustrated.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s too slow, it&rsquo;s too expensive,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t talk to the things they want it to talk to</p>
<p>and also it gets too big to manage itself.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re small, you have founders and foundations</p>
<p>and you have trusted actors and core developers</p>
<p>and you can feed them with pizzas.</p>
<p>You know them, you can meet them,</p>
<p>you can shake their hands at conferences.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re a multi billion person system,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re too large to be able to do that.</p>
<p>For example, we had the Shelley Summit last year,</p>
<p>we invited Vint Cerf to come to the summit.</p>
<p>Vint&rsquo;s a brilliant guy and he created the internet</p>
<p>with Bob and the rest of the gang</p>
<p>and back in those days, it was such a simple small system</p>
<p>that one of their students, they said,</p>
<p>hey, you need to test it.</p>
<p>He created a video game just to kind of test the thing.</p>
<p>You could call the guy on the other side and say,</p>
<p>are you seeing this?</p>
<p>Are you getting the signal?</p>
<p>They used to have a actual address book for email addresses.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;d open up the book and look it up</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll look at the internet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, who&rsquo;s in charge of that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this gargantuan network</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no group of people you can bring in</p>
<p>and thus the internet evolves very slowly, you see?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the problem is that you have this situation</p>
<p>where you wanna do lots of utility,</p>
<p>you wanna do a lot of things,</p>
<p>you wanna be a financial operating system</p>
<p>and be everything to everyone</p>
<p>but then your rate of evolution slows down</p>
<p>as your rate of adoption speeds up.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the other design goals</p>
<p>of the third generation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not good enough just to do things better, faster,</p>
<p>cheaper and have consistent cost</p>
<p>with your population growing</p>
<p>or talk to everything, your wifi moment.</p>
<p>You also need a system that can govern itself</p>
<p>at a scale of millions to billions of people</p>
<p>who have divergent interests.</p>
<p>Some cases ice pick an eye divergent interest.</p>
<p>They really hate each other and they don&rsquo;t get along.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what we termed</p>
<p>a third generation cryptocurrency</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of people attempting to compete</p>
<p>in that space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Tezos and Algran and ICP and Polkadot and so forth.</p>
<p>And each and every one of them kind of brings</p>
<p>a different blend of things that they value.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not completely equal</p>
<p>between scalability, interoperability and sustainability.</p>
<p>Some people were very focused on high throughput,</p>
<p>lots of transactions perspective.</p>
<p>Other people very focused on governance</p>
<p>like Tezos is like the governance chain</p>
<p>and they were one of the first</p>
<p>to do a self amending ledger.</p>
<p>And other people are like Aeon or Polkadot.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really thinking carefully</p>
<p>about how do we build a nice interoperable ecosystem.</p>
<p>With Cardano, we tried to actually tackle all three</p>
<p>at the same time, which was one of the reasons</p>
<p>why we were a little slower out of the gate.</p>
<p>We had to write a lot more protocols</p>
<p>but we think we&rsquo;ve kind of come up</p>
<p>with a beautiful interlocking design for all of them.</p>
<p>And again, the point is not to get it perfect</p>
<p>but rather get those just right set of evolutionary factors</p>
<p>that when you click the domino,</p>
<p>it just self evolves into what you need it to get to.</p>
<p>Allow me to stretch the metaphor farther.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin is HTML, there&rsquo;s HTML5.</p>
<p>If Ethereum is JavaScript, JavaScript with V8</p>
<p>has become quite fast, quite, you know,</p>
<p>it runs much of the internet.</p>
<p>So the argument could be that eventually everything</p>
<p>will be JavaScript or maybe you could say</p>
<p>eventually everything will be HTML</p>
<p>and it should be a bunch of different tools</p>
<p>that generate that HTML.</p>
<p>So is it possible that just like Rousseau,</p>
<p>we eventually return to generation one Bitcoin</p>
<p>or we return to generation two Ethereum</p>
<p>at the end of this journey?</p>
<p>Yeah, the problem is your tail is wagging the dog there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, you have a situation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re so focused on the technology</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re failing to understand</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s still Daisy here.</p>
<p>You still have the user and where&rsquo;s the app store?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the one click install?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the use and utility?</p>
<p>You know, all these layer two protocols</p>
<p>and these DeFi applications in five years,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re completely protocol and blockchain agnostic</p>
<p>because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>they care about liquidity, operating cost</p>
<p>and user experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so a preposterous and absurd for somebody to say,</p>
<p>oh, well, I&rsquo;m gonna go build my application,</p>
<p>get on the Apple store</p>
<p>and I am gonna use Amazon as my web host.</p>
<p>And no matter what happens, I will always use Amazon</p>
<p>even if the operating cost is crazy.</p>
<p>I see. You see?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re just in a unique period of history</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a network effect</p>
<p>around some initial infrastructure</p>
<p>and people tend to be building around that,</p>
<p>but every single one of the top DeFi providers</p>
<p>are if they&rsquo;re getting successful</p>
<p>into a certain network effect,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re having the multi chain conversation.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t really believe in a winner takes all</p>
<p>maximums view of, well, there&rsquo;s gonna be some protocol</p>
<p>that becomes the God protocol first</p>
<p>because they evolved too quickly.</p>
<p>Second, the incentives aren&rsquo;t aligned for that.</p>
<p>TCPIP didn&rsquo;t have a token connected to it.</p>
<p>There was no financial incentive</p>
<p>where if TCPIP got adopted over something else,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d make some big company crazy amounts of money.</p>
<p>It was a useful piece of infrastructure.</p>
<p>So I think that the third generation is gonna be as defined</p>
<p>by the social components and the usability components</p>
<p>as it is by the technological capabilities of the system.</p>
<p>Really what these technological capabilities gave you</p>
<p>was the ability to demonstrate a proof of concept</p>
<p>and say these things are possible.</p>
<p>Kind of like Xerox PARC, when Steve and Bill came in,</p>
<p>they said, wow, you have networked computers,</p>
<p>object oriented programming and a GUI.</p>
<p>And this is like, what was it, 70s?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wow, it&rsquo;s like incredible.</p>
<p>But none of that was an actual product.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t a Macintosh, but it was enough to get the idea.</p>
<p>And then it was a race to how do we productize</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>And in that case, it actually took several decades</p>
<p>to roll out that vision that those guys had.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what Bitcoin and Ethereum did.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s unique about this is normally you throw away</p>
<p>the prior experiments.</p>
<p>With these things, these are self evolving systems.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s entirely possible to, Joe Rogan quote,</p>
<p>to evolve Bitcoin to a point where it could become</p>
<p>a third generation system if desired,</p>
<p>as some amalgamation of layer one and layer two protocols.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same for Ethereum.</p>
<p>In fact, Vitalik is throwing away Ethereum</p>
<p>and replacing with Ethereum too,</p>
<p>because he recognizes he needs to upgrade</p>
<p>and evolve the system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes it fun because the techniques</p>
<p>and methodologies that they&rsquo;ve chosen to evolve</p>
<p>and upgrade this system are distinctly different</p>
<p>from the ones that we&rsquo;ve chosen.</p>
<p>And we have no idea which one&rsquo;s actually going to win,</p>
<p>but we learn from each other and we co evolve</p>
<p>from each other.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re running like all these experiments in real time</p>
<p>in a giant marketplace, and maybe they&rsquo;ll consolidate,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;ll stay divergent.</p>
<p>I mean, look at big tech, you have Google, Apple,</p>
<p>Microsoft, Facebook, they all coexist</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trillion dollar companies.</p>
<p>Some cases with TCP, it consolidates to one standard.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we ended up using.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your intuition with Cardano having the proof</p>
<p>of stake, and then eventually smart contracts</p>
<p>versus the Bitcoin with layer two technologies,</p>
<p>this kind of evolving creature.</p>
<p>Again, you said you can&rsquo;t really predict the future,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s your intuition why one might be more successful</p>
<p>than the other?</p>
<p>So the problem with Bitcoin is it is so slow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the mainframe programming of the past.</p>
<p>And the only reason it&rsquo;s still around is because</p>
<p>there was so much invested in keeping it around</p>
<p>that we just kind of have to leave it there</p>
<p>and one day Cobalt will die.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing about it from a collection of USPs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s particularly desirable.</p>
<p>You have extremely long settlement time,</p>
<p>you have extremely low programmability.</p>
<p>It is not aware of any other system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no native way of issuing an asset in that system.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even do a pull transaction.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do anything that&rsquo;s interesting or unique there.</p>
<p>And yeah, all due respect, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>mafia, all due respect, Tom.</p>
<p>You got some problems.</p>
<p>You need to lose some weight.</p>
<p>You come to me on the day of my daughter&rsquo;s wedding.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>So, you know, all due respect to the Bitcoin people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an amazing, incredible first generation thing.</p>
<p>And it really, we&rsquo;re all here because of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>But the problem is you have to upgrade the damn thing.</p>
<p>You know, just because you were a high school football star</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that 30 years later you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>a high school football star in the same shape.</p>
<p>You got the beer belly, you&rsquo;re old,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not doing this thing again.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Bitcoin has to do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s fundamental improvements</p>
<p>that I think Bitcoin can make at the protocol level</p>
<p>that would actually make it an incredibly competitive system.</p>
<p>Like if they wanted to keep Nakamoto consensus,</p>
<p>proof of work, there&rsquo;s ways to enhance proof of work.</p>
<p>I mean, Minkun Sir did this with BitcoinNG,</p>
<p>Promotivus Wanus did this with Prism.</p>
<p>Make it 10,000 times faster</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t compromise the fundamental security assumptions</p>
<p>that the system has.</p>
<p>You can add programmability to it.</p>
<p>Blockstream created a language called Simplicity.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s actual ways to extend.</p>
<p>And we did this with Cardano with the extended UTXO model.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ways to extend what Bitcoin has.</p>
<p>Keep the philosophy, the accounting,</p>
<p>the way of thinking about transactions.</p>
<p>But then suddenly you can now do DeFi and other things.</p>
<p>But what they&rsquo;ve done is said,</p>
<p>we will not evolve the base layer at all.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just gonna build all this layer two stuff,</p>
<p>which is usually highly fragile and centralized</p>
<p>and requires enormous effort at the base level</p>
<p>to do anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a coincidence Vitalik started as a color coins guy</p>
<p>and a master coin guy hanging out in those circles.</p>
<p>He was trying to innovate and do things in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And it was so hard and difficult</p>
<p>that he started diverging and going and doing things</p>
<p>in a different system entirely.</p>
<p>I knew the master coin guys,</p>
<p>JR and all these people, they were maximalists.</p>
<p>They really wanted to build something cool</p>
<p>and exciting for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And anything they did, the developers would attack them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re misusing op return, you&rsquo;re doing this,</p>
<p>that it was a holy war anytime you wanted to evolve.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s its own worst enemy.</p>
<p>It has the network effect, it has the brand name,</p>
<p>it has the regulatory approval,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no way to change the system,</p>
<p>even correcting obvious downsides in that system.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s really cool is Ethereum</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t suffer from that problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting to a point</p>
<p>where it has a similar network effect to Bitcoin,</p>
<p>but the community there is completely different in culture.</p>
<p>They love evolving, they love upgrading,</p>
<p>sometimes a little too much.</p>
<p>And so that means that if you look at the trajectory</p>
<p>of things, if I had to bet just those two systems,</p>
<p>Bitcoin or Ethereum, I would say nine times out of 10,</p>
<p>Ethereum is going to win the fight against Bitcoin</p>
<p>if it was the only competitor.</p>
<p>But obviously we&rsquo;re here and a lot of other people are here.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s different things going on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a much more complex game.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s always a key,</p>
<p>zooming out a little bit, set the technology aside</p>
<p>and the word salad of cryptography aside</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>What you have to always do is say,</p>
<p>what incentive does the system have to evolve?</p>
<p>And when you look at things like Android and the App Store</p>
<p>and these analogous platforms,</p>
<p>you say, ah, the evolution is user driven</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a financial incentive</p>
<p>for the user to participate.</p>
<p>So if I had to look at the trajectory of this thing,</p>
<p>come back 10 years later,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably gonna have millions of applications</p>
<p>and lots of stuff going on</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the way the system was constructed.</p>
<p>Okay, it makes sense.</p>
<p>When you look at Bitcoin, you say,</p>
<p>what is the incentive to evolve the system?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s none.</p>
<p>What is the incentive for the system</p>
<p>to get more competitive?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s none.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve turned it into a religion.</p>
<p>I was in Miami at this Bitcoin conference there.</p>
<p>I had a toilet paper roll thrown at me</p>
<p>that had shit coin written on it.</p>
<p>You have Max Keiser out on the stage,</p>
<p>doing his best Rick James impression.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see the guy that did the F Elon, fuck Elon.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re watching this stuff and you say,</p>
<p>okay, first, why would anybody wanna join that?</p>
<p>And then second, where is the conversation</p>
<p>about how do we achieve something?</p>
<p>I started with Cardano, the end in mind.</p>
<p>I said, we really wanna sit down</p>
<p>and build this financial operating system.</p>
<p>And the definition of success is</p>
<p>the poorest person in the world</p>
<p>has access to the same system</p>
<p>as the richest person in the world</p>
<p>and they both get treated fairly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never had that happen before.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>You can agree with it, disagree with it,</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s boiling the ocean, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>At least I have something.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t for the life of me understand</p>
<p>what the hell is the point of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>When I joined the Bitcoin space way back in the day,</p>
<p>it was, hey, we hate the dollar.</p>
<p>And hey, we like gold a lot.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create digital gold.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build a payment system.</p>
<p>And then it just kind of went all these different directions</p>
<p>and nobody can actually tell you what Bitcoin is for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a store of value, okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some proof of work thing</p>
<p>where maybe you&rsquo;re like incentivizing</p>
<p>alternative energy to be produced.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Nobody really knows the philosophy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no direction.</p>
<p>And they say, but don&rsquo;t worry, just buy and hold</p>
<p>and everything will sort its way out.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s HODL.</p>
<p>Yeah, HODL.</p>
<p>What about the idea of digital gold?</p>
<p>So trying to replace that particular physical material</p>
<p>that is gold to transfer into the digital space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s do that then.</p>
<p>And just say that&rsquo;s all it does.</p>
<p>Then why are we doing lightning?</p>
<p>Why are we doing any of these other things?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really need with a commodity,</p>
<p>a digital commodity, high throughput.</p>
<p>You can have slow settlement.</p>
<p>You can have high transaction fees,</p>
<p>all these types of things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s something, pick it.</p>
<p>Well, the idea is to try to come up with technology</p>
<p>like the lightning network</p>
<p>that could have something like gold,</p>
<p>but then still build an economy around it.</p>
<p>Something with a high throughput transactions.</p>
<p>And have we ever built a successful banking credit system</p>
<p>off of gold?</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>It never works because there&rsquo;s too much volatility</p>
<p>in the underlying asset.</p>
<p>Would you take a gold denominated loan for something?</p>
<p>If somebody says, all right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you five bars of gold to go buy this car</p>
<p>and pay me back five and a half bars of gold.</p>
<p>Nobody would know in five years where they come out</p>
<p>in that kind of a range.</p>
<p>The idea is that the gold is used</p>
<p>for the settlement of transactions</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re operating,</p>
<p>the actual economy is operating outside of gold.</p>
<p>And then you kind of connect back to gold.</p>
<p>So we had to go back to the gold reserve</p>
<p>and we tried that for a long time.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t really work in a modern global economy.</p>
<p>We had the Brentwood&rsquo;s agreement and all these other things.</p>
<p>And so I understand what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>and maybe there&rsquo;s some merit to that,</p>
<p>but if that was really an earnest where they want to go,</p>
<p>then the conversation should be about,</p>
<p>well, how do we make it easy for layer two protocols</p>
<p>to interact with Bitcoin?</p>
<p>So why is simplicity not built into it?</p>
<p>Why is it taking so long to do SnoreSigs?</p>
<p>Why is it taking so long to do all these obvious upgrades,</p>
<p>which are cryptographically low danger?</p>
<p>Also NipaPals, not interactive proofs of proof of work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no cost to doing that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a property of proof of work</p>
<p>where certain puzzles are more special than other puzzles.</p>
<p>And by noticing that you can create these beautiful proofs</p>
<p>that allow you to have side chains and like clients.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not compromising security of the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something you get for free with proof of work.</p>
<p>Those came out in 2016.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s derivative work fly client floating around.</p>
<p>Where the hell is it?</p>
<p>This is the frustration that I have is like,</p>
<p>if you really are serious about this whole lightning</p>
<p>and gold economy thing, I love choice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a libertarian by nature.</p>
<p>I love competition.</p>
<p>And I read all those books.</p>
<p>I read Ludwig von Mises&rsquo;s work and Murray Rothbard&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>I love what Hayek had to say about private currencies.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go try it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But then you have to have some focus and commitment</p>
<p>as an ecosystem.</p>
<p>And the excuse they use is, well, no, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re decentralized.</p>
<p>And because we&rsquo;re decentralized, we don&rsquo;t need that.</p>
<p>As if there&rsquo;s some sort of guiding swarm intelligence</p>
<p>that will naturally push the system</p>
<p>in that particular direction.</p>
<p>But then you ask, well,</p>
<p>how do people measure the success of Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Is it the fact that they&rsquo;ve actually achieved</p>
<p>lots of transactions and lots of actual economic activity</p>
<p>and lots of businesses accepting Bitcoin?</p>
<p>That will go up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the price.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only thing they pay attention.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why this is the most attended Bitcoin conference</p>
<p>in history.</p>
<p>Not because somehow Bitcoin got so much more adoption,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because this is the highest price point Bitcoin</p>
<p>has ever been this year, over 30,000.</p>
<p>So first of all, let me state that, Charles,</p>
<p>for the most part is purely objective.</p>
<p>The bias that comes in, for the record, I want to say,</p>
<p>that I have heard, because you mentioned the mafia,</p>
<p>that you prefer Goodfellas over the Godfather.</p>
<p>So a man who prefers Goodfellas over Godfather,</p>
<p>you take it for that opinion for what it is.</p>
<p>I actually had to think about that one for quite a bit.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>Joe Pesci was so good in that movie.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I also love Casino and those big glasses on De Niro.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>With Sharon Stone.</p>
<p>But we could talk about that for hours.</p>
<p>But let me ask you about the Bitcoin conference,</p>
<p>because it is kind of, I would say,</p>
<p>an important moment in human history.</p>
<p>It was quite exciting in terms of size</p>
<p>and kind of turmoil and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And you were there in, what is it?</p>
<p>Hot and humid Miami.</p>
<p>I believe that&rsquo;s the way you introduced it.</p>
<p>So what do you make of the community of Bitcoin</p>
<p>or that particular event in human history?</p>
<p>What makes me sad is I remember the old Bitcoin community</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen what it&rsquo;s become.</p>
<p>And the old community was really fun,</p>
<p>like the San Jose conference in 2013</p>
<p>or subsequent conferences.</p>
<p>You know, there was just a lot of people,</p>
<p>they had no money and they just really loved this idea</p>
<p>of decentralized money.</p>
<p>They loved this idea of decentralization in particular.</p>
<p>And you could strike up a conversation with everyone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no ego at all.</p>
<p>But what was really fun is you could really get</p>
<p>intimate friendships and relationships,</p>
<p>great conversations with people there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the early days of AI.</p>
<p>They all met in Dartmouth and all these other places.</p>
<p>Very intimate, there was no egos.</p>
<p>Everybody was just trying to do some really cool stuff.</p>
<p>Now, just like those early days,</p>
<p>there was an overestimate of how robust</p>
<p>the solutions would be.</p>
<p>So we believed, oh yeah, 10 years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna rule the whole world, right?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t exactly happen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Bitcoin grew from nothing</p>
<p>in just 11 years to I&rsquo;m in Mongolia riding camels</p>
<p>and the camel herder has Bitcoin in the Coby desert.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s telling you that&rsquo;s a pretty pervasive technology</p>
<p>if you have that level of adoption that quickly.</p>
<p>When I went to Miami, it was unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Everything was so commercial.</p>
<p>Half of the vendors at the conference were like watches</p>
<p>that cost half a million dollars</p>
<p>and they were covered in diamonds.</p>
<p>So when you see that kind of materialism leak its way in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s first is repulsive.</p>
<p>The other thing was there was no,</p>
<p>like I remember one of the first conferences,</p>
<p>Mo Levin&rsquo;s conference in January of 2014,</p>
<p>the North American Bitcoin Conference ironically in Miami,</p>
<p>there was a Bitcoin help center booth.</p>
<p>Dima ran it and a few of the other Bitcoin OGs ran it.</p>
<p>The core developers actually came over like Jeff</p>
<p>and others who were there and sat at the booth</p>
<p>and anybody come up, ask a question,</p>
<p>anything you wanna ask about Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It was like, that was the culture,</p>
<p>just help people welcome in.</p>
<p>There was no help booth there.</p>
<p>There was no notion of that.</p>
<p>There were six hour lines and superstars</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>And again, again, it was always the same thing.</p>
<p>Look how much money all these people have made.</p>
<p>And the whole point of Bitcoin</p>
<p>was to redefine the notion of money,</p>
<p>redefine the notion of value, these types of things.</p>
<p>So it just, I&rsquo;m no longer part of that.</p>
<p>And it made me sad because I really enjoyed being part of it.</p>
<p>How I got started was the Bitcoin education project.</p>
<p>I did a class on Udemy.</p>
<p>I gave it away for free.</p>
<p>I had 80,000 students and they would email me.</p>
<p>I got 5,000 emails before I stopped answering them.</p>
<p>And everyone come in and ask me some question</p>
<p>about something, sometimes arcane, sometimes trivial.</p>
<p>And I take the time to sit down and answer the question</p>
<p>or forward the email to somebody I knew</p>
<p>who could answer that particular type of question.</p>
<p>And there were some amazing people in the early days</p>
<p>like Mike Hearn and Gavin and others.</p>
<p>And they were just super committed.</p>
<p>And Mike&rsquo;s case, he knew Satoshi.</p>
<p>He actually emailed them back and forth</p>
<p>because he was around 2009, 2010.</p>
<p>He did the Bitcoin Java client.</p>
<p>And Satoshi was all excited.</p>
<p>He said, oh, wow, Bitcoin can come to a cell phone.</p>
<p>This is really cool and exciting.</p>
<p>And then what happened?</p>
<p>Mike left Bitcoin in 2013</p>
<p>over the whole big block debate that happened.</p>
<p>They just treated him like dirt,</p>
<p>like he was subhuman or something.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, the culture has changed a lot.</p>
<p>And if they like it, it&rsquo;s good for them.</p>
<p>They can enjoy their religion, but it&rsquo;s not for me.</p>
<p>And where I like being is, like I had a guy</p>
<p>who used to work for me, Alex Cherpanoi,</p>
<p>and he created this beautiful project called Ergo.</p>
<p>To me, that is the spiritual successor to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Ergo is really special because it has the same culture.</p>
<p>It has the same mentality.</p>
<p>And the technology is kind of like a natural evolution</p>
<p>of what you would do if you knew about Bitcoin</p>
<p>and you wanted to build the next big thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still a proof of work system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a UTXO system,</p>
<p>but he added UTXO with some smart contracts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this Sigma protocol idea.</p>
<p>On the proof of work side,</p>
<p>Satoshi had this one CPU, one vote idea.</p>
<p>So Alex tried to create non outsourceable puzzles</p>
<p>to make it impossible to have mining pools.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all these other beautiful little things.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s this brilliant Russian programmer,</p>
<p>and he surrounded himself</p>
<p>with all these other brilliant people.</p>
<p>He has zero ego.</p>
<p>He has negative ego.</p>
<p>When you put him with a person with ego,</p>
<p>your ego goes down, right?</p>
<p>And everything about Alex is always like,</p>
<p>how do I solve this?</p>
<p>How do I do that?</p>
<p>And he gets legitimately excited when he meets somebody</p>
<p>that he can collaborate with or learn from.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Bitcoin was in the beginning.</p>
<p>Everybody set their egos aside,</p>
<p>whether it was Hal Finney or whatever,</p>
<p>and they would just say, how can I help?</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>And it was all about coming up with some cool new thing</p>
<p>or solving some cool new problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any of that in Bitcoin today.</p>
<p>So quite a few people are excited about Ergo</p>
<p>and excited about the fact</p>
<p>that you kind of appreciate Alex and Ergo.</p>
<p>Do you see Cardano potentially utilizing</p>
<p>the proof of work mechanism from Ergo</p>
<p>as part of this pool for the consensus mechanism?</p>
<p>I mean, anything&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of evolution Ergo has to go through.</p>
<p>And Ergo, it was kind of like,</p>
<p>when the Xbox 360 first came out,</p>
<p>while they were prototyping it,</p>
<p>Microsoft needed a development environment.</p>
<p>They ironically purchased a lot of Apple computers</p>
<p>to do that,</p>
<p>because Apple was moving away from the PowerPC to Intel,</p>
<p>and Microsoft was moving towards the PowerPC,</p>
<p>just this weird intersection of history.</p>
<p>So at that time,</p>
<p>the largest order of Mac computers made</p>
<p>was done by Microsoft,</p>
<p>and they were using it for Xbox stuff.</p>
<p>So Ergo, we viewed the same way.</p>
<p>So we said, well, we have this extended UTXO model.</p>
<p>The only thing that&rsquo;s sufficiently close to it</p>
<p>where we can beta test contracts is actually with Ergo.</p>
<p>And Alex just was a little faster</p>
<p>in getting certain things out,</p>
<p>because we were doing things</p>
<p>in a slightly more rigorous way</p>
<p>and slightly more expressive way.</p>
<p>So we actually tested a stable coin and Oracle</p>
<p>and other things on Ergo,</p>
<p>and it has just incredible community.</p>
<p>When we said, hey, we&rsquo;re coming here to work and build,</p>
<p>he said, oh yeah, we&rsquo;d love to work with you guys.</p>
<p>This is so cool.</p>
<p>The other thing is Alex used to work for us,</p>
<p>and he had this lovely project called Scorex,</p>
<p>and it was all about like a pedagogical framework</p>
<p>for building blockchains.</p>
<p>And if you want to do prototyping or academic research,</p>
<p>it was great.</p>
<p>It was super modular,</p>
<p>and it separated the consensus network</p>
<p>and transaction layer from each other</p>
<p>in just the right way,</p>
<p>so that you can make it modular and mix and match things.</p>
<p>So you can put secure academia in,</p>
<p>or maybe a different network layer</p>
<p>and a different consensus protocol,</p>
<p>a proof of work to another proof of work and so forth.</p>
<p>So we loved having that kind of IP sitting around</p>
<p>because it gave us the ability</p>
<p>to kind of play around with ideas in a matter of weeks</p>
<p>instead of months or years.</p>
<p>And then he just took that concept and he gave it away.</p>
<p>The wave protocol was built on it.</p>
<p>That was Sasha Ivanov, he did that.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s two or three other cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>that were launched from Scorex,</p>
<p>and then Alex took that and built Ergo from it.</p>
<p>So there was a nice intersection</p>
<p>where there was overlapping technology</p>
<p>with Ergo with our technology.</p>
<p>And the other thing was that the community</p>
<p>was so open and friendly, it was just a no brainer.</p>
<p>Just go in and start building some things there.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of evolving ideas,</p>
<p>the whole Sigma protocol idea is very different</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a guy at Boston University,</p>
<p>his name will come to me in a second,</p>
<p>who came up with this stuff.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s some merit there,</p>
<p>especially as we start moving closer to this idea</p>
<p>of blockchains being used to validate proofs</p>
<p>instead of running computations.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Sigma protocol, by the way?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a way of expressing scripts.</p>
<p>And basically, you get these concise representations</p>
<p>of proofs, and then you can say,</p>
<p>okay, the script is correct,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to run the whole program.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot, I&rsquo;m not doing the topic justice,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot more to it, but that&rsquo;s the basic concept.</p>
<p>And in a Redeemer validator model,</p>
<p>you need stuff like that,</p>
<p>because as your model gets more complex</p>
<p>and a lot more things happen,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to have a situation</p>
<p>where I have to run, replay a huge amount of the UTXO graph</p>
<p>to be able to get to a point</p>
<p>where I have the state of the system.</p>
<p>You need some mathematical artifact</p>
<p>that gives you the state of the system quickly.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re saying, okay, I now know</p>
<p>what computation thread I need to run</p>
<p>to be able to get enough</p>
<p>to be able to redeem this transaction.</p>
<p>So he just found a more compressed representation of it,</p>
<p>and the math doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What matters is there&rsquo;s a whole beautiful field</p>
<p>that thinks about this type of stuff,</p>
<p>and it was never once linked before into our industry.</p>
<p>The brilliance of Alex was to actually realize</p>
<p>you could do that and pull those things together,</p>
<p>and it may actually have some merit,</p>
<p>but by no means is he the only guy that does this stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually other approaches in verified computing</p>
<p>that have explored that.</p>
<p>Like my favorite came out of Microsoft research</p>
<p>is a project called Pinocchio,</p>
<p>and there was a followup called Geppetto.</p>
<p>And the basic idea was that it&rsquo;s fortuitous</p>
<p>that you have these computer science problems</p>
<p>like hashing where you can do all this computation,</p>
<p>and once you&rsquo;ve done all of it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve found this magic number</p>
<p>that you can verify that the computation was done correctly.</p>
<p>So the proof of work works this way.</p>
<p>Hard to do the proof of work,</p>
<p>easy to check the proof of work.</p>
<p>Cryptography also works this way.</p>
<p>You have some trap door</p>
<p>where you can verify something&rsquo;s correct,</p>
<p>but to get that thing done,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing it brute force,</p>
<p>it takes an enormous amount of computation.</p>
<p>Well, not all problems are like this,</p>
<p>like protein folding, to verify the protein</p>
<p>is folded correctly, you have to fold the protein.</p>
<p>So you have to redo the work.</p>
<p>But what if for arbitrary computation,</p>
<p>you could take a problem,</p>
<p>and then you could generate a proof</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve done that computation correctly,</p>
<p>and the proof validates in logarithmic time</p>
<p>or constant time.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s incredible, right?</p>
<p>Well, Microsoft actually wrote a paper on how to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Pinocchio.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another example of these types of things,</p>
<p>these rollups of things</p>
<p>where instead of doing the computation on chain</p>
<p>or trying to create some sort of replicated machine</p>
<p>that does all this stuff,</p>
<p>you instead just say,</p>
<p>okay, only thing I&rsquo;m gonna use the blockchain for</p>
<p>is to check your proof.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna turn it into a distributed computing problem,</p>
<p>and any person in the world can do the problem</p>
<p>on any server, untrusted server even,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have to trust the output,</p>
<p>you trust the proof, and the proof is deterministic.</p>
<p>It tells you these things.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re using zero knowledge</p>
<p>or Sigma protocols or some other mechanism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s moving you in that particular direction</p>
<p>to turn it from a replicated to a distributed problem</p>
<p>and go from I&rsquo;m doing the work to I&rsquo;m checking</p>
<p>that the work was done correctly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, we&rsquo;re back to the P equals NP thing</p>
<p>where for many very interesting problems,</p>
<p>the checking is efficient,</p>
<p>is much more efficient than the solving.</p>
<p>Right, and also do you want complete determinism</p>
<p>or is it probabilistic?</p>
<p>Because if you relax that requirement a little bit,</p>
<p>then suddenly actually you have a broader class of things</p>
<p>you can construct this stuff for.</p>
<p>You mentioned UTXO.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a paper titled the Extended UTXO Model.</p>
<p>It writes in the introduction,</p>
<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum hosting the two currently most valuable</p>
<p>and popular cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>use two rather different ledger models</p>
<p>known as the UTXO model and the account model respectively.</p>
<p>At the same time, these two public blockchains</p>
<p>differ strongly in the expressiveness</p>
<p>of the smart contracts that they support.</p>
<p>This is no coincidence.</p>
<p>Ethereum chose the account model</p>
<p>explicitly to facilitate more expressive smart contracts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Bitcoin chose UTXO also for good reasons,</p>
<p>including that its semantic model stays simple</p>
<p>in a complex concurrent</p>
<p>and distributed computing environment.</p>
<p>This raises the question of whether it is possible</p>
<p>to have expressive smart contracts</p>
<p>while keeping the semantic simplicity of the UTXO model.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the fuck that mean?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What is UTXO, what is the account model,</p>
<p>and what is the idea of the Extended UTXO model?</p>
<p>So I guess the easiest way of visualizing it</p>
<p>is that UTXO is kind of like cash register accounting.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s assume you don&rsquo;t have credit cards,</p>
<p>you just have cash.</p>
<p>And so when you go and buy some milk and potatoes</p>
<p>or whatever and you go to the cashier,</p>
<p>you pull out your $20 bill, you give it to them,</p>
<p>unless it comes up to 17.50, they have to make change.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t tear your $20 bill,</p>
<p>cut a piece of it off and say, here&rsquo;s part of my 20.</p>
<p>You give them the entire $20 bill</p>
<p>and then they give you something back.</p>
<p>And the things that they give you back</p>
<p>are also atomic units, they don&rsquo;t cut those things up.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of what UTXO is all about in a nutshell</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s inputs and outputs,</p>
<p>your inputs that 20 and your outputs will be</p>
<p>the 17.50 that goes to them</p>
<p>and then the remaining change that goes back to you, okay?</p>
<p>The problem with this particular model</p>
<p>is that the way it was implemented with Bitcoin,</p>
<p>there was no notion of how do we run complex predicates,</p>
<p>complex contracts on this thing,</p>
<p>where instead of just saying, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna push value to you,</p>
<p>I wanna put lots of terms and conditions</p>
<p>into the movement of that value.</p>
<p>Like you only get this if I mow your lawn on Tuesday</p>
<p>or you only get this if some event happens</p>
<p>like the Broncos win the Super Bowl or something like that.</p>
<p>Okay, so you need some notion of programmability with it.</p>
<p>So a lot of people are trying to figure out</p>
<p>in the early days of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>how could we improve the expressiveness of the system?</p>
<p>And one of ways of doing it is you can go</p>
<p>to a different accounting model, bank style accounting.</p>
<p>So in a bank ledger, every time you do a withdrawal,</p>
<p>a deposit, it&rsquo;s a mutable system.</p>
<p>With the cash register accounting,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t tear up the bills,</p>
<p>but the bank you can deduct or add ledger all the time.</p>
<p>So Ethereum kind of works in that bank accounting system</p>
<p>where you just, you send messages, you send transactions</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going up or down.</p>
<p>And so you can trigger programs the same way.</p>
<p>So what we did is we said, okay,</p>
<p>if you take the UTXO model and you have some data to it,</p>
<p>and instead of saying it&rsquo;s just a digital signature,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in a script, you can basically create something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still the same as cash register,</p>
<p>but now you have programmability</p>
<p>and the big difference is local versus global.</p>
<p>So in the case of UTXO, your scripts are your concerns.</p>
<p>So whatever&rsquo;s going on in that cash register</p>
<p>has no bearing or impact on the other cash registers.</p>
<p>But when you look at bank accounting,</p>
<p>you have to know the state of the entire banking world</p>
<p>to be able to make that work.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because if that transaction is inbound,</p>
<p>that wire transfer is inbound,</p>
<p>you have to know those funds are actually there,</p>
<p>that thing is actually happening.</p>
<p>So when you have a global state for a program,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you could do a lot more with it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a lot more dangerous.</p>
<p>And so you have to build all these mechanisms</p>
<p>to try to protect yourself from it.</p>
<p>So what we did is we said, okay, add data,</p>
<p>add a programmability,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of in this nice Goldilocks zone</p>
<p>between what Ethereum did with an account style model</p>
<p>and a global state system.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not as restrictive as Bitcoin,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still in a Turing complete world,</p>
<p>you can still run all kinds of things.</p>
<p>And then any standard mathematician, they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>okay, well, is it isomorphic?</p>
<p>Is there a mapping between this?</p>
<p>What type of function can I actually take something</p>
<p>expressed in one structure</p>
<p>and transmit it to the other structure</p>
<p>and properties are preserved?</p>
<p>So we wrote a paper, it&rsquo;s called Climatic Ledgers,</p>
<p>where we actually showed that UTXO,</p>
<p>Extended UTXO and accounts are somewhat similar</p>
<p>in that you could map things that happen in one system</p>
<p>to the other system,</p>
<p>the properties are preserved between the two.</p>
<p>So in practice, what&rsquo;s nice about Extended UTXO</p>
<p>is that you can put infrastructure on top of it</p>
<p>to make the development experience relatively similar</p>
<p>to the development experience</p>
<p>of what you would do with Ethereum,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to worry about this global state.</p>
<p>So when you talk about sharding,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot easier to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more conceivable to that.</p>
<p>And also you get determinism in the system.</p>
<p>So when I have a Plutus smart contract,</p>
<p>whatever I run locally is exactly what I expect to run</p>
<p>in the system.</p>
<p>When you have a concept of this mutable global state</p>
<p>in the system, whatever you run locally</p>
<p>is not necessarily what you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>when you actually push it into the system.</p>
<p>So you may misprice things and the contract will fail.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t ever happen in the Plutus world.</p>
<p>So you got a lot of advantages with this particular model.</p>
<p>The downside is that it&rsquo;s a little bit less expressive</p>
<p>on the boundaries and a little bit harder</p>
<p>to write certain types of software with it.</p>
<p>But again, how you resolve that is you kind of build</p>
<p>higher level languages and other such things</p>
<p>that compensate for these types of things</p>
<p>and design patterns that compensate</p>
<p>for these types of things.</p>
<p>The other advantage that we have that&rsquo;s really fun</p>
<p>and exciting is that Bitcoin lives in this model</p>
<p>and there are other UTXO based systems.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re all talking about smart contracts as well.</p>
<p>And they would like to continue working in the UTXO model.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a Bitcoin contract developer or other things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually already a group of people</p>
<p>that understand this very well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s still a fairly large part</p>
<p>of the mindshare of the entire space.</p>
<p>So there are no silver bullets.</p>
<p>And anytime you pick a particular model,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an upside and a downside.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different ways of doing things</p>
<p>from cash register accounting or bank accounting.</p>
<p>You can even do different accounting models.</p>
<p>But we felt this was kind of the best first step</p>
<p>to go into because we started with something very familiar</p>
<p>that had a long history behind it.</p>
<p>And it maps very beautifully</p>
<p>to functional programming principles.</p>
<p>This concept of immutability and these things</p>
<p>and much more strict management of state</p>
<p>and no notion of having this global concept</p>
<p>that you have to kind of manage as you break up the system.</p>
<p>Now in practice, what does this mean to the developer</p>
<p>when they actually start real writing an application?</p>
<p>Not too much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a little bit of retooling</p>
<p>and some new patterns you have to learn.</p>
<p>But in practice, you can still do the same things.</p>
<p>You can implement a Uniswap style thing.</p>
<p>In fact, we even wrote that code</p>
<p>with the Plutus Pioneers program.</p>
<p>So you can go to YouTube and watch a lecture</p>
<p>and see how that&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>You can do a stable coin.</p>
<p>You can do an Oracle.</p>
<p>You can do interactive contracts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it has to be done a little differently</p>
<p>than the way that you would do it in an account style model.</p>
<p>Just like you could run an application in Java,</p>
<p>you can run an application in Haskell.</p>
<p>They both can do the same thing,</p>
<p>but the code is gonna look different.</p>
<p>And the canonical way of looking at things is different.</p>
<p>So in terms of Oracle, Oracle networks,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts about chain link</p>
<p>and external off chain data sources?</p>
<p>And everything we&rsquo;ve been talking about now</p>
<p>with the external, with the extended UTXO model.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, trying to do smart contracts without Oracle</p>
<p>is like trying to have sex with your pants on.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not really fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly the best of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;ve been doing it all these years.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>For any other person, Lex,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t believe you, but for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m single.</p>
<p>This makes so much sense now.</p>
<p>Okay, so anyway, you need the outside world</p>
<p>to be injected into your system, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to keep a straight face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You need the outside world to make your system useful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all the kinds of things that you care to do</p>
<p>with a smart contract usually involve human beings</p>
<p>and information streams aggregating and doing something.</p>
<p>So the Oracle is a super important component in practice</p>
<p>for any smart contract involving any notion of value.</p>
<p>You need to know when things have happened,</p>
<p>how they happen, who won, who lost, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So first, where do you get the data from?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the aggregator?</p>
<p>This is why we love our relationship with Wolfram</p>
<p>because one of the things you&rsquo;ll know about Wolfram</p>
<p>as you get to know the guy is he&rsquo;s a data pack rat.</p>
<p>Every email, every communication, every interaction,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s archived somewhere.</p>
<p>Like last time I talked to him,</p>
<p>oh, yeah, I have emails from you from 2012.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you still have those?</p>
<p>Yeah, every keystroke is written down</p>
<p>and stored somewhere.</p>
<p>So if you use Wolfram Alpha,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a simulacrum of the way his mind thinks.</p>
<p>And so you can query the system and be like,</p>
<p>oh, how many shipwrecks have happened in Florida</p>
<p>between 1950 and 2000 that have resulted</p>
<p>more than a billion dollars of cargo loss</p>
<p>and at least one fatality?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll return an answer.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an incredible source of data that&rsquo;s computable.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know, Wolfram Alpha</p>
<p>is more than just the thing that assists you</p>
<p>with your math homework in high school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually this giant network of data</p>
<p>of like weather data, of location data,</p>
<p>just statistic, all kinds of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s doing the aggregation in a way</p>
<p>that you can query across data sets.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s exactly this kind of idea.</p>
<p>It basically represents the very kind of thing</p>
<p>you would hope to be able to query off chain</p>
<p>as part of the smart contracts.</p>
<p>Right, but the only downside is it&rsquo;s centralized.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always the Achilles heel of Wolfram</p>
<p>is he tends to like proprietary things</p>
<p>and he tends to like centralizing things</p>
<p>and mostly because he likes running the things.</p>
<p>And everybody can have an opinion on that.</p>
<p>The thing though is that after you&rsquo;ve done aggregation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a question of injection.</p>
<p>How do you get that data into the system?</p>
<p>And you can do that in a very naive way</p>
<p>where you can say, oh, I&rsquo;m just gonna attach a public key</p>
<p>to it and it&rsquo;ll sign for that data feed, that injection.</p>
<p>And then somehow I&rsquo;ll just trust it as it is.</p>
<p>Or you could try to make it more complicated.</p>
<p>You could wait data feeds from different sources</p>
<p>and have some notion of truthiness</p>
<p>or a veracity metric or something like that.</p>
<p>So Chainlink is just one of many different philosophies</p>
<p>that was born out of the academy.</p>
<p>I believe Ari Jewell was connected to it</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some good people on that side.</p>
<p>And it has a philosophy about how do you aggregate,</p>
<p>a philosophy about how do you inject</p>
<p>and how do you create incentives</p>
<p>so that that process over time gets more federated</p>
<p>or more decentralized instead of centralizing</p>
<p>around one particular setup.</p>
<p>Now, closely related corollary to this</p>
<p>is computation off chain.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned, smart contracts</p>
<p>are intimately connected to our Oracle.</p>
<p>The question is how much pre processing</p>
<p>and state management are you gonna do outside of the system</p>
<p>versus what do you do inside of the system?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very interesting balance between these two.</p>
<p>And they were thinking about this stuff for a long time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great paper called Town Crier,</p>
<p>came out way back in the day at Cornell.</p>
<p>And that was all about using like SGX to scrape things</p>
<p>and you can rely on trusted hardware to give you good data.</p>
<p>But you could also use those SGX cores</p>
<p>to do contract processing,</p>
<p>because if it runs in trusted hardware,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s very unlikely to be tampered with or manipulated.</p>
<p>And because of that, you don&rsquo;t have to federate it</p>
<p>or decentralize it, you can run it on a single device</p>
<p>as if it was running on a cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>So there seems to be a desire in that community</p>
<p>to capture more and more of the smart contract stack</p>
<p>and pull more and more of that stack</p>
<p>into that layer two infrastructure</p>
<p>from running on layer one.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you have cost reduction</p>
<p>and potentially because your trust model collapses</p>
<p>to whatever Chainlink is offering,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gaining anything</p>
<p>by doing the computation on Ethereum or another platform.</p>
<p>Because you ever watched The Simpsons?</p>
<p>There was this beautiful episode where Mr. Burns</p>
<p>wants to turn the power off in Springfield.</p>
<p>It is the perfect analogy for information security.</p>
<p>So he and Smithers,</p>
<p>they go through this elaborate series of doors</p>
<p>and secret passages and guard dogs and robots and shit</p>
<p>to get to the center of the power plant</p>
<p>to turn off the power.</p>
<p>And when they arrive at the center of the plant,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like this stray dog that&rsquo;s inside the room.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this wicker screen door that leads to the outside.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, well, why the hell did you go</p>
<p>through this elaborate series of doors and things</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s like a backdoor into your system?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s basically a real life analogy</p>
<p>of the relationship between the Oracle</p>
<p>and the smart contract.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only as good in your infrastructure model</p>
<p>as your weakest link.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t matter if all of your computation</p>
<p>is decentralized, if you&rsquo;re at the mercy of your data feed.</p>
<p>Because I can just manipulate that</p>
<p>and break the entire security model of the system, okay?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll perfectly execute the wrong answer.</p>
<p>So they say, well, if you&rsquo;re trusting us anyway,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you pull more of what you&rsquo;re doing on chain</p>
<p>into our stack, which creates more transaction fees for them</p>
<p>and more value for them.</p>
<p>But there are many different ways you can do oracles.</p>
<p>And earlier I was talking about the biology of these things,</p>
<p>the cell differentiation.</p>
<p>The minute that you admit heterogeneity in your system</p>
<p>and you start having cells like stake pools</p>
<p>or things that are on 24 seven,</p>
<p>then you can start asking the what if question.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you guys just also provide data feeds?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you guys also provide state channels</p>
<p>or payment channels or generate random numbers</p>
<p>from here or whatever?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re now a service provider.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making the blockchain full time,</p>
<p>but part time you&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re making bagels,</p>
<p>you could probably make donuts, that type of a concept.</p>
<p>So I think that type of competition</p>
<p>is going to be very difficult</p>
<p>for a lot of these layer two protocols</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t tightly coupled with the protocol</p>
<p>because the ones that are tightly coupled with the protocol,</p>
<p>they have a built in trust advantage.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve already built a commercial reputation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s already an increasingly more decentralized set.</p>
<p>The other thing is you don&rsquo;t need a token.</p>
<p>You can just use ADA.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need an oracle coin</p>
<p>for these types of things to work.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s just for the injection component</p>
<p>and the veracity attestation.</p>
<p>So is it true or not?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not about the aggregation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still a tremendously time intensive,</p>
<p>expensive proposition.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only a few people in the world</p>
<p>that have what Steve has with Wolfram.</p>
<p>And those guys by just cutting off those supply</p>
<p>to replicate what they have is something</p>
<p>that would cost hundreds of millions</p>
<p>or billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s an interesting question</p>
<p>of how do you incentivize</p>
<p>decentralized aggregation of information?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of what town crier</p>
<p>and other protocols we&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>So maybe you can say how town crier works</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s your vision?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now partnering with Wolfram and Wolfram Alpha</p>
<p>in sort of exploring this partnership of data</p>
<p>and the blockchain.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your vision for a possible distributed version</p>
<p>of Wolfram Alpha?</p>
<p>Well, the first step is just say,</p>
<p>can we use this as a feed?</p>
<p>And they can be what Bloomberg is to the financial markets.</p>
<p>So you have a terminal and you have something</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s always a value of at least offering choice.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re anti chain link</p>
<p>or picking winners and losers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an open protocol, it&rsquo;s an open system.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re successful, chain link will migrate</p>
<p>or it will at least support us</p>
<p>because they like money.</p>
<p>They like users, they like liquidity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a disservice to their community</p>
<p>not to support a potential customer set,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna have a spectrum</p>
<p>from the desire to do a completely decentralized</p>
<p>aggregation, curation, injection and veracity attestation</p>
<p>to a completely centralized vertically integrated set.</p>
<p>You need to be able to have that whole spectrum</p>
<p>and offer that to the smart contract developer</p>
<p>to decide what makes sense.</p>
<p>By the way, a lot of cases,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be their own Oracle.</p>
<p>So for example, the World of Warcraft example that I gave,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s a completely centralized thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a video game run by a single company.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no sense in saying</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re somehow going to decentralize that.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re just trying to do is extend their currency</p>
<p>or NFTs or whatever into new marketplaces.</p>
<p>So the minting of that is controlled by a single entity</p>
<p>and the world state of that,</p>
<p>you just have to trust Blizzard</p>
<p>to inject that into the system.</p>
<p>You could try to imagine some sort of like,</p>
<p>Sentinel group of people within the game</p>
<p>who keep Blizzard honest,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s completely unnecessary</p>
<p>because they can change the rules</p>
<p>of the system arbitrarily.</p>
<p>So in that case, you&rsquo;re optimizing around efficiency</p>
<p>and cost reduction.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d want a single feed that gets injected</p>
<p>into the system from them.</p>
<p>If you look at a stable coin that&rsquo;s algorithmic</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basing its value on the aggregation</p>
<p>of many different exchanges,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the polar opposite example.</p>
<p>Because there you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>okay, what&rsquo;s the price of my asset relative to some basket?</p>
<p>But how do I know that the price feeds I&rsquo;m looking at</p>
<p>are accurate?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to look at Binance and Bittrex</p>
<p>and all these other things,</p>
<p>or maybe there&rsquo;s conventional Forex exchanges</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Okay, well, how do you weight that?</p>
<p>And how do you clip outliers and these types of things?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a completely different conversation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more mechanics you have to put in</p>
<p>for that bundling and attestation of the veracity</p>
<p>of the data feed.</p>
<p>And what happens if you get it wrong?</p>
<p>Your stable coin gets mispriced and everything goes to hell.</p>
<p>And the markets will eventually correct it</p>
<p>for arbitrage seeking behavior,</p>
<p>but anything that was built on that will fail</p>
<p>in the short term.</p>
<p>So Oracle is really just a game of,</p>
<p>you have to build a standardized interfaces</p>
<p>and make it as easy as possible for people to do that.</p>
<p>And then let people choose how they wanna inject data</p>
<p>and what level of assurance do they need behind that?</p>
<p>And the question is, how much do you leave to the user</p>
<p>versus how much does the protocol take care of for you?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a difficult design question.</p>
<p>For our part, we love working with Steve and Wolfram</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re a great company</p>
<p>and they really have some bright people there.</p>
<p>And we know on the data set, they&rsquo;re second to none</p>
<p>because not only do they have it, it&rsquo;s computable.</p>
<p>You can do all kinds of things</p>
<p>and manipulate with a very rich query language.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>
<p>And we wanna make sure that that&rsquo;s accessible</p>
<p>to developers and Cardano.</p>
<p>Remember, they&rsquo;re like Bloomberg.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a centralized speed in that respect.</p>
<p>So if you wanna build a Chainlink S competitor,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other protocols you could do for that.</p>
<p>Now you asked about Tom Cryer</p>
<p>and that was an attempt to kind of sweep the oceans</p>
<p>with the net, get the data through a decentralized way.</p>
<p>And that was just saying, hey, let&rsquo;s use trusted hardware</p>
<p>to go read all kinds of websites and other things.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s trusted hardware,</p>
<p>the scraping is nonbiased.</p>
<p>If you find something inconvenient to whatever</p>
<p>the person who&rsquo;s scraping is,</p>
<p>trusted hardware will still do it and it can&rsquo;t be changed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to manipulate SGX to do that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s great, but you still run into the problem</p>
<p>of how do you wire that together?</p>
<p>The underlying websites still don&rsquo;t have any notion</p>
<p>of veracity or reputation behind them.</p>
<p>And then you also have the issue of storage.</p>
<p>Where the hell do you put all of it?</p>
<p>If you have exabytes of data,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the incentive for that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dream of the Semantic Web.</p>
<p>I still think is a fascinating idea</p>
<p>how to basically convert the internet into a core,</p>
<p>like a knowledge base that you can query,</p>
<p>you can integrate in the same way you did</p>
<p>with Wolfram Alpha, but much bigger.</p>
<p>But that means basically revolutionizing</p>
<p>the way we put the internet together,</p>
<p>which I think these ideas of off chain data</p>
<p>will motivate people, because there&rsquo;s a lot of money</p>
<p>to be made.</p>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s money to be made with the Semantic Web.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;ll be an interesting kind of future.</p>
<p>I do want to ask you about video games really quick</p>
<p>as a small tangent, because you said this really</p>
<p>interesting idea of Blizzard being centralized control.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have items in the game</p>
<p>that are not controlled by Blizzard?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Being controlled in a decentralized fashion</p>
<p>that you can, like what is it,</p>
<p>the grandfather sword in Diablo?</p>
<p>Hmm, what was it really?</p>
<p>Somebody was criticizing me.</p>
<p>I was saying all these kinds of nice things</p>
<p>about Diablo III, and they said Diablo II Resurrected</p>
<p>is coming out, they need to check it out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of camps and wars that need to be done.</p>
<p>Come on, we both know that Diablo II</p>
<p>is far better than Diablo III.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>This is the war that they&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ll play it, it&rsquo;s coming out soon,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll play it, fine.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, those items are owned by Blizzard.</p>
<p>Is it possible to create video games</p>
<p>where items are owned by the people outside of Blizzard,</p>
<p>and do you think in like a half century from now</p>
<p>we will all live in those games,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll forget the physical space even exists?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, that&rsquo;s definitely possible.</p>
<p>I look at CryptoKitties, that&rsquo;s a great example of that.</p>
<p>Can you explain what CryptoKitties is?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s basically just a video game</p>
<p>that kind of lives on a blockchain,</p>
<p>and the creatures within the game</p>
<p>can breed with each other and create new CryptoKitties,</p>
<p>and you can own them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like some sort of dystopian Tamagotchi</p>
<p>with lots of money behind it.</p>
<p>But anyway, the thing is those assets</p>
<p>actually have a blockchain based representation.</p>
<p>And so whether the infrastructure</p>
<p>that hoists up that game off chain goes on or off,</p>
<p>because that ledger exists outside of the game,</p>
<p>any person can come in and replicate it, restore it,</p>
<p>and turn it back on sans intellectual property.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s completely possible</p>
<p>to break your architecture up</p>
<p>where you have a notion of the player part,</p>
<p>and then you have a notion of the experience part,</p>
<p>and you can interchange experiences,</p>
<p>almost like you do cascading style sheets or something</p>
<p>for different presentations,</p>
<p>and the ownership of the underlying layers, the players.</p>
<p>So yeah, that&rsquo;s definitely doable.</p>
<p>And frankly, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna happen in the gaming world,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much value in that.</p>
<p>I mean, everybody wants play,</p>
<p>and right now the model is you make a game,</p>
<p>you sell licenses, and you have a huge surge of people</p>
<p>at the beginning of the game buying the video game,</p>
<p>and then you have this long tail,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve gotten almost 95% of your value</p>
<p>in the first six months, and you have a huge churn rate.</p>
<p>The odds are the vast majority of people</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be playing the game within 12 months.</p>
<p>But if you can create an interactive game</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s an actual economy inside the game,</p>
<p>then you have EVE Online, or Second Life,</p>
<p>or any of these things,</p>
<p>where you have people playing for 10 years,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like people buying virtual real estate</p>
<p>and all these other things.</p>
<p>You as the game developer actually don&rsquo;t have to create</p>
<p>a lot of content.</p>
<p>So your long tail gets a lot fatter,</p>
<p>and it generates a lot more revenue,</p>
<p>and your cost of operating the system</p>
<p>is fairly fixed or diminishing.</p>
<p>So the economics align for doing exactly</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re talking about, and I think it&rsquo;ll get done.</p>
<p>Well, I just saw recently sort of this calculation</p>
<p>that people played WoW and Fortnite for 140 billion hours.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s without the economic incentives there.</p>
<p>So do you think it&rsquo;s possible that like most of our economy</p>
<p>in the future, people playing video games essentially?</p>
<p>Like, okay, so one vision of the future,</p>
<p>especially with AI and automation,</p>
<p>that people like, that we get wealthier and wealthier,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this kind of rising GDP for the entire world,</p>
<p>and then people are losing their jobs,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re still well off enough</p>
<p>to be able to have a high quality of life.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all looking for meaning,</p>
<p>and the meaning we&rsquo;ll find is by playing video games,</p>
<p>and now there&rsquo;s this extra levels,</p>
<p>like you can be a Bill Gates within a video game world,</p>
<p>in the digital world as opposed to the physical world.</p>
<p>Is that, do you think that&rsquo;s the future?</p>
<p>You just wanna have the Westworld</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t tell the difference, does it matter?</p>
<p>Lion uttered to you.</p>
<p>Did you ever interview Yuval Harari?</p>
<p>Not yet, eventually.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but yeah, I guess, you know,</p>
<p>Homo Dias, that&rsquo;s kind of like the roadmap there, right?</p>
<p>This hedonistic dystopia where everybody just lives</p>
<p>wired into some simulation,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some movies about that,</p>
<p>Ready Player One, and the other one was Surrogate,</p>
<p>and so forth, so yeah, Hollywood has certainly visualized</p>
<p>what this could be, but you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so pessimistic in that respect.</p>
<p>I do believe that the video game world</p>
<p>is evolving at an amazing pace,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re looking at where Unreal is at,</p>
<p>is just incredible, the latest Unreal Engine,</p>
<p>and within one or two more ticks of that clock,</p>
<p>the iteration, so five to 10 years,</p>
<p>the photorealism will be so good that it&rsquo;ll be hard</p>
<p>to distinguish between real life and video games,</p>
<p>and you know, the hardware is almost there,</p>
<p>so the question is then,</p>
<p>when you have photorealistic experiences</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve successfully traversed the uncanny valley</p>
<p>to a point where it&rsquo;s good enough,</p>
<p>then will virtual reality be more desirable</p>
<p>than actual reality?</p>
<p>And for the vast majority of people,</p>
<p>the answer&rsquo;s probably yes,</p>
<p>because actual reality&rsquo;s tough, it&rsquo;s hard, you know,</p>
<p>but then your knowledge that you live in a virtual world</p>
<p>actually becomes a problem for you,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s gonna be this kind of sad, dark industry</p>
<p>where people try to create amnesia,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re not aware that they&rsquo;re inside</p>
<p>the virtual world, and so that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Why is it sad?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s almost like a&hellip;</p>
<p>Because you know it&rsquo;s not real,</p>
<p>but if you could forget that it&rsquo;s not real,</p>
<p>then you believe what you&rsquo;re experiencing is real.</p>
<p>Yeah, but yeah, so what?</p>
<p>You forget, like you forget all the ugly parts of life,</p>
<p>which is the physical, the meat space,</p>
<p>and then you get to enjoy video games.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s always lurking in the back of your mind</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re in the matrix.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s&hellip; You have to not be in the matrix.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just why the bald dude in the matrix was like,</p>
<p>I wanna be rich and have a beautiful wife</p>
<p>and eat a steak every day.</p>
<p>You know, he didn&rsquo;t wanna know he was in the matrix.</p>
<p>So you would take the red pill, not the blue pill.</p>
<p>Well, no, hang on, it depends on how good</p>
<p>the virtual world is, Lex.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to tell you,</p>
<p>is I mean, isn&rsquo;t that what most of the beautiful experiences</p>
<p>about human life are, is forgetting for a moment,</p>
<p>for a time, like the mess of it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what love is, is you forget.</p>
<p>Like all of a sudden everything is beautiful,</p>
<p>but like the reality is you&rsquo;re gonna lose that person</p>
<p>and most likely love will fade.</p>
<p>And no matter what, even if it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re both gonna be dead soon.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m taking the blue pill on that one.</p>
<p>You went full Ernest Becker on me, man.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But you know, I get what you&rsquo;re saying though,</p>
<p>and then actually, but then it begs the question,</p>
<p>how do we, and it goes back to the very first question</p>
<p>you asked in this interview, which is like,</p>
<p>how do we know we&rsquo;re not in a simulation?</p>
<p>Or, you know, is this Bostrom&rsquo;s concepts</p>
<p>or these ideas like real?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that we are</p>
<p>and that we desire to be because the real world</p>
<p>is horrifically dystopian or bad,</p>
<p>or maybe we actually don&rsquo;t exist, we&rsquo;re completely virtual</p>
<p>and does it matter?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d argue that it probably doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>at some certain point.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at the end of your life</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re 90s dying of cancer,</p>
<p>the fact that you can live out being young, healthy,</p>
<p>and 25 is probably a desirable thing</p>
<p>and no one would ever complain about that.</p>
<p>Where it becomes problematic is if the vast majority</p>
<p>of society enters this virtual simulacra of reality</p>
<p>and as a consequence, nothing works</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no one to do anything,</p>
<p>society falls apart in that respect.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no desire to do anything in the real world.</p>
<p>Innovation stops, the desire to actually do real work stops</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re always inside this virtual economy.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s an interesting question,</p>
<p>but drawing it back more to where we&rsquo;re at today,</p>
<p>the evolution factors are there.</p>
<p>VR is evolving at a very rapid rate.</p>
<p>The game engines are just incredible today</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really doing amazing things.</p>
<p>And there seems to be an overwhelming desire</p>
<p>for people to escape the harshness of where they live,</p>
<p>just by evidence by how many billions of hours</p>
<p>have been spent playing video games.</p>
<p>People still play Skyrim.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a good game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably my favorite game</p>
<p>of the whole Elder Scrolls series.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fascinating because smart contracts</p>
<p>is actually the mechanism by which we take a lot</p>
<p>of the meatspace stuff and move it to the digital world.</p>
<p>So all the stuff we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>is really probably the mechanisms which take us there,</p>
<p>which I find that world not dystopian.</p>
<p>I find that world quite dystopian</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many opportunities</p>
<p>to create beautiful experiences.</p>
<p>But since we&rsquo;re talking about the future,</p>
<p>let me ask you a timeline question,</p>
<p>or even just like definitional.</p>
<p>What is Alonzo?</p>
<p>You mentioned some fun Hello World experiments going on.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And how and when will Cardano get smart contracts?</p>
<p>Yeah, so Alonzo Church is a famous, famous mathematician,</p>
<p>computer science guy, and he was a contemporary of Turing.</p>
<p>And there was like these three different views</p>
<p>of computing, recursive functions from G√∂del</p>
<p>and Turing machines from Turing,</p>
<p>and Church had lambda calculus, and they&rsquo;re all equivalent,</p>
<p>and they all give you the ability to build a computer.</p>
<p>So we like functional programming, so we decided.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your favorite Church.</p>
<p>So we had to name something after Church,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just weird that we never did.</p>
<p>So we said, okay, Alonzo is a good release name.</p>
<p>Basically, it was bringing smart contracts to Cardano.</p>
<p>Took us a long time to get here,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll be there in the next 90 days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everything we do, there&rsquo;s a process,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s all the colors of the rainbow.</p>
<p>We start with Alonzo blue, and then white, and purple.</p>
<p>And each step, you do some more things.</p>
<p>You bring more users in, and then eventually,</p>
<p>you get to a threshold where you say,</p>
<p>okay, everything works the way intended,</p>
<p>and you push a button, and we initiate</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called a hard fork combinator event,</p>
<p>and boom, the system has smart contracts.</p>
<p>You just wake up, and it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s in your house.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna be a hard fork.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when I got my blue check mark on Twitter,</p>
<p>I woke up, and I had it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you were never the same.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, yeah, like hard fork.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard fork of Charles.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You got blue mark.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I think you can take it away, but.</p>
<p>Can they take my check mark away, Flex?</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Oh, but that&rsquo;d be like a hard fork backwards, I guess.</p>
<p>Okay, so great.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, but currently, there&rsquo;s a testing procedure</p>
<p>going on to see what does that look like,</p>
<p>and what will give you confidence</p>
<p>that things are working well.</p>
<p>Yeah, so first, you start with the marry era,</p>
<p>which is where we&rsquo;re right now multi assets.</p>
<p>So you can do metadata and issue tokens on Cardano,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d have limited programmability on chain.</p>
<p>Alonzo adds the programmability in,</p>
<p>but we already have most of the foundations</p>
<p>of the extended UTXO model,</p>
<p>and the smart contract model is just,</p>
<p>those things aren&rsquo;t ready.</p>
<p>So the first step is, say, fork it,</p>
<p>so all those rules are now there, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we did with Alonzo Blue.</p>
<p>We forked a testnet base layer, and it successfully survived</p>
<p>going from marry to Alonzo,</p>
<p>which means that you can move transactions</p>
<p>from one side to the other.</p>
<p>Both systems work.</p>
<p>And then the next step is, say, okay, well,</p>
<p>are the stake pool operators, people who run</p>
<p>the infrastructure, able to run this testnet</p>
<p>just like they run Cardano?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing right now with Blue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re bringing all these SPOs in,</p>
<p>and then are we able to submit and run smart contracts</p>
<p>on the system?</p>
<p>And they actually return a round trip.</p>
<p>You send something, you get something back.</p>
<p>Yay, okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>And then what you do is each step,</p>
<p>so the next is white, you go from like 50 people</p>
<p>to several hundred, and then purple&rsquo;s an open testnet</p>
<p>where we want every single person in the entire ecosystem</p>
<p>to use it, and it&rsquo;s also a DevNet.</p>
<p>So that means that people who are writing</p>
<p>with Pluse Playground and local interpreters,</p>
<p>their smart contracts can actually start testing them now</p>
<p>on the public infrastructure.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like releasing dev kits to the Xbox</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>You send them out to game developers</p>
<p>before you release the Xbox,</p>
<p>so they can test their video games in anticipation</p>
<p>of the release of the system.</p>
<p>So you run that for at least a month,</p>
<p>and as long as it doesn&rsquo;t blow up in your face,</p>
<p>and oh God, what have we done, Hindenburg,</p>
<p>oh the humanity, you release it and you ship it.</p>
<p>The problem is it&rsquo;s no longer in our control.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s over 100 exchanges that have listed Cardano.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of wallet infrastructure.</p>
<p>There are thousands of different constituencies.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s less of a technological problem now,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more of a coordination problem.</p>
<p>So you have to evolve in a very methodical way,</p>
<p>and each step of the way you bring new actors in,</p>
<p>they get ready for it.</p>
<p>They upgrade their infrastructure to it,</p>
<p>and then like shells, eventually,</p>
<p>you get to the outer shell,</p>
<p>which is the hard fork for the general public.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;ve done it right, like that blue check mark,</p>
<p>they wake up and it&rsquo;s exactly the same.</p>
<p>They just get a little update thing, update your client.</p>
<p>And they start demanding Wagyu beef.</p>
<p>Is there stuff you&rsquo;re worried about</p>
<p>in terms of like when something&rsquo;s this tricky,</p>
<p>you know, goes up several orders of magnitudes</p>
<p>in terms of scale?</p>
<p>Are there problems that you foresee?</p>
<p>Is there, like we said, there&rsquo;s game theoretic aspects,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Like what worries you the most?</p>
<p>I mean, I sleep like a baby.</p>
<p>I wake up every two hours crying.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>And what makes no sense, I slept like a baby.</p>
<p>But go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly, right.</p>
<p>Messing your whole world up right now, Alex.</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>No, I mean, there&rsquo;s so much that keeps me up at night.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re in a cold sweat everyday</p>
<p>when you have an ecosystem like this,</p>
<p>cause you, you, the other thing is you&rsquo;re judged</p>
<p>as much by the applications people build on the platform</p>
<p>as you are by the platform you&rsquo;ve constructed.</p>
<p>So, you know, one of the most unfair things</p>
<p>that happened in our industry was blaming Vitalik</p>
<p>for the DAO hack.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t write the code, he wasn&rsquo;t responsible for it.</p>
<p>It was a completely independent, different team.</p>
<p>And because it blew up,</p>
<p>a lot of people just developed this idea,</p>
<p>Ethereum is not secure, the EBM is fundamentally broken.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true, there are some issues there,</p>
<p>but come on, that&rsquo;s like saying,</p>
<p>oh, well, Photoshop didn&rsquo;t work, fuck Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the issue is you get,</p>
<p>as a platform developer,</p>
<p>coupled with the wins and losses</p>
<p>of your application developer.</p>
<p>So if they go do amazing things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, Windows is great, we love it.</p>
<p>And if they go do terrible things, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh man, I guess he&rsquo;s trying to kill all of us.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re kept up a night about</p>
<p>is not just what we&rsquo;ve constructed,</p>
<p>but also how do we curate an ecosystem</p>
<p>and foster the development of an ecosystem</p>
<p>where you have assurance baked into the application,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s somehow expressible to the user.</p>
<p>So when you download your smart contract</p>
<p>or you click your one click install,</p>
<p>you use your unit swap clone</p>
<p>or whatever the hell it is that&rsquo;s deployed on Cardano,</p>
<p>you have a little green check mark</p>
<p>or something that indicates to you</p>
<p>that somebody audited the code</p>
<p>or followed a specification.</p>
<p>The lack of that is problematic</p>
<p>because then first there&rsquo;s impersonations,</p>
<p>the whole MyEtherWallet thing,</p>
<p>like your videos or my videos are the same.</p>
<p>Every comment, there&rsquo;s a bot that says,</p>
<p>hey, give me some money or something like that.</p>
<p>That kind of stuff happens.</p>
<p>But then just protocol level flaws,</p>
<p>like what happened with the DAO hack,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night.</p>
<p>How do you resolve that problem?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t hire these people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tell them what to do.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t tell them how to build things on the platform.</p>
<p>They may have tons of experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>They could be Simon Payton Jones</p>
<p>or they could have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever</p>
<p>and they read one tutorial</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve written three lines of code their entire life</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve deployed something horribly broken, copy paste,</p>
<p>and suddenly it all goes to hell.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m judged by both.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what really keeps me up at night.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re, as a company, trying to figure out,</p>
<p>and as the ecosystem, trying to figure out standards.</p>
<p>Like at University of Wyoming,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re setting up the Smart Contract Engineering Institute.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re negotiating with them right now.</p>
<p>And the goal there is just to create some standards</p>
<p>for how to certify smart contracts</p>
<p>so that you can get that green check mark</p>
<p>and know that it actually has some assurance level</p>
<p>behind it.</p>
<p>But God, that&rsquo;s a huge coordination problem</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a huge information presentation problem</p>
<p>and incentives problem and so forth.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, people who value being first to market</p>
<p>will kind of piss in the pool for everybody else.</p>
<p>In terms of, maybe you can comment</p>
<p>on the topic of decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>What kind of decentralized exchanges, DEXs,</p>
<p>what are they, first of all,</p>
<p>and what kind would you like to see built around Cardano?</p>
<p>Yeah, so people want to create exchanges</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have custodial risk.</p>
<p>The point of exchange is to build you a marketplace</p>
<p>where bids and asks can find each other,</p>
<p>people can meet and trade.</p>
<p>You can find a price and you can get liquidity.</p>
<p>So you got gold, you wanna turn your gold into dollars.</p>
<p>Okay, well, somebody has to create a marketplace for that.</p>
<p>So like Coinbase is an example of a marketplace.</p>
<p>Exactly. But it&rsquo;s centralized.</p>
<p>But the problem is you have custodial risk.</p>
<p>So when you put your gold and your dollars</p>
<p>or your digital representations of these things</p>
<p>into the exchange, what if Wally,</p>
<p>Eve broke up with him and now he&rsquo;s really sad</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s gone to the dark side</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s become Wally the hacker.</p>
<p>Okay, so he can go and sneak his way in</p>
<p>and hack into Coinbase and steal all your gold</p>
<p>and your tokens.</p>
<p>So instead of you actually being able to swap these things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve lost all your money.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s other problems too.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s say Daisy has now come in</p>
<p>and become a regulator and said,</p>
<p>oh, I don&rsquo;t like these exchanges anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna shut them all down.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then you have no access to it.</p>
<p>So you have sovereign risk, you have the risk of threat,</p>
<p>you have regulatory risk, you have the issue of banks</p>
<p>maybe cutting you out.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been in our industry for more than 10 years.</p>
<p>Mt. Gox was the most famous example of that.</p>
<p>They collapsed, I believe in 2013</p>
<p>and hundreds of millions of dollars was lost</p>
<p>over the course of a while.</p>
<p>So the point of a DEX is saying,</p>
<p>can we do what a marketplace does,</p>
<p>but not have Coinbase, not have a central actor</p>
<p>run this thing?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of problems with that</p>
<p>because exchanges are generally creatures of latency.</p>
<p>You know, high frequency trading, for example,</p>
<p>the things that nanosecond,</p>
<p>they co locate their infrastructure</p>
<p>with the exchange software</p>
<p>just so they can front run orders over other people.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s crazy the amount of technology that they put in.</p>
<p>So the traditional Wall Street version of an exchange</p>
<p>is very centralized, very fast, very optimized</p>
<p>and kind of behaves by a very closed set of rules.</p>
<p>When you look at a DEX, you have to accept</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna have to have slightly different rules</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re operating in a global systems latency</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re operating in a system</p>
<p>that has different behaviors.</p>
<p>However, that said, there&rsquo;s a lot of great protocols</p>
<p>that have been built for it.</p>
<p>You know, Uniswap has kind of evolved a lot over the years</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve seen a huge competition</p>
<p>and a lot of evolution to basically build out protocols</p>
<p>that kind of excuse some of these security problems,</p>
<p>enjoy high liquidity</p>
<p>and then also have this beautiful concept of openness.</p>
<p>One of the gatekeepers to crypto</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a cryptocurrency developer are the exchanges.</p>
<p>I remember when we first created Cardano,</p>
<p>you know, the Bitfinex guys</p>
<p>reached out to the Cardano Foundation.</p>
<p>They said, oh, we&rsquo;d be happy to list ADA.</p>
<p>And I said, okay.</p>
<p>And they said, yeah, we want $5 million to do it.</p>
<p>You know, so there was kind of some Italian for go fuck</p>
<p>yourself in those email conversations.</p>
<p>Fuck, hula is what I said.</p>
<p>But anyway, that kind of back and forth</p>
<p>happens all the time.</p>
<p>And because these guys are gatekeepers,</p>
<p>they have this nepotistic control information asymmetries</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>So having a DEX, you don&rsquo;t have that problem.</p>
<p>You have open listing</p>
<p>and you basically just put the asset into it.</p>
<p>And if anybody wants to trade it, they will.</p>
<p>And if it seems like it&rsquo;s a good idea,</p>
<p>a natural market will form, market making will occur</p>
<p>and you get liquidity with it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no barrier to entry for that type of system.</p>
<p>The biggest existential problem for DEXs right now</p>
<p>is the concept of regulation.</p>
<p>So basically right now, when you use Binance or Coinbase</p>
<p>or these other guys, you have to go through KYC and AML,</p>
<p>know your customer and anti money laundering.</p>
<p>So basically who are you and you know,</p>
<p>is your money real or not,</p>
<p>or are you a drug dealer or something?</p>
<p>So normally you do that by saying, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give them my copy of my passport</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;re gonna request some tax records</p>
<p>or whatever the best practices are</p>
<p>for the particular jurisdiction.</p>
<p>And then that exchange is liable if that&rsquo;s fucked up.</p>
<p>So if the government comes in and says,</p>
<p>hey guys, you know, pull your compliance records</p>
<p>and they find discrepancies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll actually put the exchange out of business</p>
<p>or fine them very heavily.</p>
<p>JP Morgan Chase got $19 billion in fines</p>
<p>over the last 20 years for various compliance issues</p>
<p>amongst other things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s expensive, very difficult thing.</p>
<p>And at DEX, it&rsquo;s open system.</p>
<p>You just have value coming in, not identity.</p>
<p>And so all these things are trading</p>
<p>amongst anonymous accounts.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no notion of compliance right now for that.</p>
<p>So a lot of regulators are coming in and saying,</p>
<p>oh, well, this is just a cesspool for terrorism</p>
<p>and drug dealing and bad stuff.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re word salad of bullshit.</p>
<p>But you know, it is what it is.</p>
<p>You have to deal with these guys.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s been a lot of discussions of,</p>
<p>can we take DEXs and keep the openness</p>
<p>and keep the liquidity</p>
<p>and no counterpart or custodial risk?</p>
<p>And can we add some notion of compliance to that</p>
<p>in a decentralized way</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require a single actor to be a gatekeeper?</p>
<p>So I think actually by combining DIDs,</p>
<p>decentralized identifiers, that&rsquo;s the way to do it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s actually the next generation of the technology</p>
<p>is the regulated DEX and who regulates that,</p>
<p>how does that work and so forth.</p>
<p>But I think ultimately those are gonna be</p>
<p>the only marketplaces that end up surviving</p>
<p>in this current environment</p>
<p>if your desire is to exit to a dollar.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t really care about the fiat side,</p>
<p>like a traditional legacy currency,</p>
<p>you can always do things in a shadowy, unregulated way.</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s a personal preference</p>
<p>and a business preference.</p>
<p>Can we kind of return to proof of work and proof of stake?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so many topics I wanna talk to you about.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll jump around a little bit.</p>
<p>But at the Bitcoin conference, Jack Dorsey spoke,</p>
<p>I think I believe he said Bitcoin changes everything.</p>
<p>I think he made a video for Jack</p>
<p>trying to explain different ideas to him.</p>
<p>I guess describing the difference between proof of work</p>
<p>and proof of stake as we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>What do you hope Jack Dorsey comes to understand</p>
<p>about the difference between proof of work</p>
<p>and proof of stake?</p>
<p>Well, I hope he understands it&rsquo;s just a resource.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the entire point of the video I was trying to make</p>
<p>is like, dude, you&rsquo;re like in this cult</p>
<p>where you think the only way to be secure</p>
<p>is proof of worker and somehow proof of stake</p>
<p>is less secure than proof of work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how you put those inequalities there</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re talking about apples and oranges.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making different trade offs</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s different assumptions</p>
<p>about the nature of the people involved,</p>
<p>but the mechanics are the same.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really more of a question of</p>
<p>what type of system do you prefer?</p>
<p>Do you want mercenaries guarding Rome</p>
<p>or do you want Roman citizens guarding Rome?</p>
<p>Okay, and as the Romans learn,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better to have citizens usually doing that.</p>
<p>Okay, and that&rsquo;s the only point I was trying to make</p>
<p>to Dorsey and I don&rsquo;t think he watched it</p>
<p>or particularly cared,</p>
<p>but it was more of a video for everyone.</p>
<p>And to start that dialogue of realizing</p>
<p>that the real game is not,</p>
<p>is proof of stake better than proof of work?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how do we go from one to end and what should end be?</p>
<p>You just mentioned that semantical addressable web,</p>
<p>going back to IPFS and these other concepts.</p>
<p>Well, how do you pay for the enormous burden</p>
<p>of storing that much data?</p>
<p>You can create a consensus protocol for it.</p>
<p>There actually is one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Permacoin, came out in 2014, 15.</p>
<p>Andrew Miller wrote it and a few other authors.</p>
<p>I think John Katz may have been an author as well.</p>
<p>But basically it was just a throwaway</p>
<p>proof of work style algorithm</p>
<p>that only works if you have large amounts of data.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s like your miner</p>
<p>is like a hard drive effectively.</p>
<p>Proof of storage, I think you call it.</p>
<p>Yeah, this type of stuff.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been since then many iterations,</p>
<p>evolutions of that type of protocol.</p>
<p>Okay, so what if you throw that into your resource back?</p>
<p>Now you have a capacity in your system</p>
<p>for storing huge amounts of information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incentivized by the way the system works.</p>
<p>And you can balance that with a proof of stake system.</p>
<p>And you can balance that with,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you have proof of useful computation.</p>
<p>We may have a paper on that, who knows, coming soon.</p>
<p>And what if you have a proof of useful computation</p>
<p>where maybe you can do walk stat or something, who knows?</p>
<p>With something like that, okay,</p>
<p>well now you have three resources inside your system</p>
<p>and those three things keep your system secure.</p>
<p>They keep each other balanced.</p>
<p>And they just so happen to create</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s largest supercomputer that&rsquo;s programmable.</p>
<p>And it just so happens to create</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s largest database that&rsquo;s programmable.</p>
<p>In addition to having a shareholder style model</p>
<p>for ownership inside of it,</p>
<p>to kind of balance these things out.</p>
<p>So people care about the appreciation of value</p>
<p>inside the system.</p>
<p>So that was my point to Jack is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a business guy, why are you betting all your eggs?</p>
<p>And one crazy model that&rsquo;s a cult step away</p>
<p>and realize that that does something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tool, but saws aren&rsquo;t the only tool in the toolbox.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s hammers and screwdrivers and other things.</p>
<p>Go to end resources.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s have a real conversation about</p>
<p>what would a world computer or a world infrastructure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s useful for your business domain,</p>
<p>in his case, Twitter, require?</p>
<p>And what type of resources would you need</p>
<p>for such a thing?</p>
<p>Well, in this case, Square, more importantly.</p>
<p>Currently, if you look at Square and Cash App,</p>
<p>they support Bitcoin.</p>
<p>He is kind of all in on the proof of work idea.</p>
<p>Not all in, but currently kind of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one supported idea.</p>
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s not just a tip in proof of work.</p>
<p>I love you so much, Charles.</p>
<p>Thank you, I appreciate this.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not gonna run with that,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;m tempted to.</p>
<p>But looking forward, do you hope Cardano</p>
<p>becomes part of Cash App?</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a business guy, or at least I&rsquo;d hope he is,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not about what I want or what he wants,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about what markets want.</p>
<p>When you run a publicly traded company,</p>
<p>you have fiduciary obligation to your shareholders</p>
<p>to maximize the utility, sustainability,</p>
<p>and value of your company.</p>
<p>And so if he&rsquo;s running a company</p>
<p>that makes money off of these things,</p>
<p>it makes absolutely no sense to be a maximalist.</p>
<p>You want transaction volume,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you make your damn money.</p>
<p>Coinbase was the same way.</p>
<p>They were very maximalist in the beginning.</p>
<p>Very quickly, they started realizing,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re losing a lot of money.</p>
<p>If we wanna IPO, we kinda need to be a bit more diverse.</p>
<p>Eric Voorhees was also a maximalist way back today.</p>
<p>Now look at Eric, he&rsquo;s got ShapeShift</p>
<p>and all these other pieces of infrastructure.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a lot more friendly with us alties.</p>
<p>So Jack will make that decision,</p>
<p>his people will make that decision, I think,</p>
<p>based on market dynamics, transaction volume,</p>
<p>and value to the user.</p>
<p>And if the concern is actually legitimately security,</p>
<p>then the only question I&rsquo;d ask their team is,</p>
<p>can you please provide me a definition of what?</p>
<p>Doing POW is more secure than proof of stake as a tweet</p>
<p>is not really a proof, okay?</p>
<p>You need to actually come out and sit down</p>
<p>and say, what is your security model?</p>
<p>What do you care about?</p>
<p>What do you value?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the problems you&rsquo;re concerned about proof of stake?</p>
<p>And they never really get there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I call this maximalist like a religion</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just like saying,</p>
<p>the angels descended from the heavens.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, how do you know?</p>
<p>Well, because the Bible said so, or this doctrine said so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, that&rsquo;s your evidence?</p>
<p>Somebody wrote something down.</p>
<p>Can you please give me a little bit more?</p>
<p>They say, no, you&rsquo;re challenging the word of God.</p>
<p>In this case, you&rsquo;re challenging the word of Satoshi.</p>
<p>And all I ask for is just what is the burden of proof?</p>
<p>We wrote the papers, we have security models,</p>
<p>we went through the peer review process.</p>
<p>God, that was not easy.</p>
<p>We wrote formal specifications.</p>
<p>In some cases, we formalize those specifications</p>
<p>with Isabel, for God&rsquo;s sakes, which is not easy to do.</p>
<p>And then we implemented it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s running in production with a million users</p>
<p>at a $50 billion market cap.</p>
<p>I mean, at what point do you start saying,</p>
<p>well, maybe there&rsquo;s something there?</p>
<p>And they say, no, there&rsquo;s nothing there,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not secure, it can&rsquo;t be secure.</p>
<p>And you say, okay, then why do you believe what you believe?</p>
<p>And they never come back to me with an answer, ever.</p>
<p>Well, I believe God didn&rsquo;t go through a peer review process</p>
<p>when he wrote the 10 commandments.</p>
<p>So sometimes it works out, sometimes not.</p>
<p>Let me ask on that same thread,</p>
<p>Tesla, SpaceX, Elon Musk currently invested in Bitcoin,</p>
<p>but are openly looking</p>
<p>to explore other cryptocurrency investments.</p>
<p>What case would you make for Cardano?</p>
<p>Well, if they truly care about alternative energy</p>
<p>and sustainability, carbon reduction or carbon neutrality,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be in a system</p>
<p>where there is no built in mechanism</p>
<p>to constrain the energy consumption.</p>
<p>With proof of stake, energy consumption is a negative.</p>
<p>You wanna minimize it.</p>
<p>If you can get the same amount of stuff done</p>
<p>on a Raspberry Pi as you can a big server,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do it on the Pi</p>
<p>because ultimately that server cost</p>
<p>and that energy cost is coming out of your budget.</p>
<p>With proof of work, any innovation you come up with</p>
<p>to optimize power, you just build more ASICs</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s always 30% more power efficient.</p>
<p>Great, buy 30% more.</p>
<p>You keep adding to the work set</p>
<p>because you want more hash power,</p>
<p>more hash power, more share of the Pi.</p>
<p>So you have no energy savings component.</p>
<p>I know these people are saying,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s a lot of wasted energy in the grid</p>
<p>and this is kind of incentivizing</p>
<p>using that wasted energy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a better way of storing it than batteries</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re now storing it as a Bitcoin</p>
<p>instead of storing it as energy.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe there&rsquo;s some truth to that,</p>
<p>but anyway, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>The energy is a critical point for you.</p>
<p>Like the&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>The energy is a critical point for me with Tesla</p>
<p>because they assert to be an alternative energy company.</p>
<p>And unless they can make the case</p>
<p>that somehow the proliferation of Bitcoin</p>
<p>is legitimately going to proliferate batteries,</p>
<p>solar and wind or other things,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s probably good for them to just focus</p>
<p>on the most efficient,</p>
<p>energy efficient cryptocurrency possible.</p>
<p>Otherwise you&rsquo;re exacerbating global warming,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exacerbating the ecological consequences of it.</p>
<p>The other thing is Bitcoin is the least programmable</p>
<p>of all the cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>And if you wanna do interesting, sexy, unique things,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say Tesla, for example,</p>
<p>they wanna start doing V to I and V to V</p>
<p>for autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>and have the vehicles start talking to each other</p>
<p>and connect it to 5G.</p>
<p>Well, imagine if you wanna build a telco coin</p>
<p>or some sort of 5G coin</p>
<p>and you wanna build an IOT layer network,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just no real way to do that on Bitcoin</p>
<p>with the way it&rsquo;s designed.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d need fundamentally different infrastructure</p>
<p>to create such a token and regulate such a system</p>
<p>and have these things autonomously negotiate</p>
<p>and do business with each other.</p>
<p>You need DEXs and stable coins and all kinds of mechanics</p>
<p>to make something like that possible.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s really beneficial to Tesla</p>
<p>if they could figure that out</p>
<p>because they could create</p>
<p>like an information sharing incentive scheme</p>
<p>where if the cars talk to each other,</p>
<p>including other branded cars, like GM cars and Fords,</p>
<p>they can now actually get data from those cars</p>
<p>through a marketplace in exchange</p>
<p>for the benefit of autonomous driving</p>
<p>or for the benefit of understanding road conditions</p>
<p>or safety enhancement and so forth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just depending, are you just here to speculate?</p>
<p>Are you here to actually use it as another medium of exchange</p>
<p>or do you actually wanna build infrastructure</p>
<p>on this thing?</p>
<p>The more closely you get to utility,</p>
<p>the further down the road you get there,</p>
<p>then the more programmability you need.</p>
<p>And so it makes a lot more sense to be an Ethereum fan</p>
<p>or a Cardano fan than to be a Bitcoin fan.</p>
<p>So to be both proof of stake</p>
<p>and have the smart contracts capabilities.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we went over to Ethereum</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re proof of work.</p>
<p>You mentioned God, God spelled backwards as dog.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that for a transition?</p>
<p>And Elon Musk and Tesla are at least a little bit curious</p>
<p>about a coin called Dogecoin.</p>
<p>You made a video directed to Elon</p>
<p>on how to improve Dogecoin.</p>
<p>What are your ideas for making Dogecoin even better</p>
<p>than it already is?</p>
<p>Well, Dogecoin is just based,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that Nine Inch Nails song,</p>
<p>a copy of a copy of a copy.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just a copy of a copy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Bitcoin gave Litecoin Litecoin.</p>
<p>Bitcoin gave Litecoin Litecoin gave Dogecoin.</p>
<p>And it was kind of a parody cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>And I think Jackson was trying to do it</p>
<p>to like prove a point about altcoins.</p>
<p>And then true to form, it&rsquo;s like nobody got the doctrine</p>
<p>and completely perverted the entire religion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the emperor of man and Warhammer 40K.</p>
<p>It was like this atheist don&rsquo;t worship me.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s like this whole religion</p>
<p>built around the emperor.</p>
<p>So Dogecoin has become a thing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s become such a large thing</p>
<p>that it is a reasonable target for somebody</p>
<p>to fix it up and repair it,</p>
<p>make it an interesting cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The point of the video was to show</p>
<p>what a modern third generation cryptocurrency</p>
<p>really would require.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a major overhaul.</p>
<p>And there are already people doing this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Solanas and the Harmony Ones</p>
<p>and the Cardanos, Neoses and all these other guys.</p>
<p>And they have billions of dollars and huge dev teams</p>
<p>and all these innovative protocols.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really serious about this thing,</p>
<p>sticking around, being useful in doing stuff,</p>
<p>then the point of the video was to show</p>
<p>the types of things you&rsquo;d have to think about</p>
<p>and the types of papers that are all open source,</p>
<p>patent free and don&rsquo;t have any notion</p>
<p>of intellectual property behind them</p>
<p>that his engineers could grab and go and do.</p>
<p>And he did mention on Twitter</p>
<p>that he was looking for feedback on how to improve Doge.</p>
<p>And so I said, all right,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ll just put all these things together.</p>
<p>It was a little tongue in cheek</p>
<p>because I figured he&rsquo;d ignore it,</p>
<p>but it was also showing how hard it is</p>
<p>to innovate in this entire space.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just go and say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go build a battery powered car</p>
<p>or rocket or enter a new industry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to do that.</p>
<p>You spend years and lots of effort.</p>
<p>You have to do series of small learning steps.</p>
<p>You have to pick up destroyed rockets</p>
<p>on the side of the beach and things like that</p>
<p>before you get to the rocket landing itself.</p>
<p>Well, analogously,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to build a cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Satoshi probably spent years thinking carefully</p>
<p>and that work was a derivative of 30 years of work</p>
<p>in the digital asset space starting in the 1980s,</p>
<p>working its way through.</p>
<p>So, and then Bitcoin only did very limited things</p>
<p>relative to what Ethereum can do</p>
<p>or Cardano can do and so forth.</p>
<p>So the minute that you extend that complexity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about years of R&amp;D,</p>
<p>years of engineering effort that needs to be done.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the point of Doge?</p>
<p>Is it just a meme?</p>
<p>Is it actually contending to be useful?</p>
<p>Or is it competing as a store of value against Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Now, if it&rsquo;s competing as a store of value against Bitcoin,</p>
<p>why the hell does it have the monetary policy it does?</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s predatory distribution</p>
<p>of the underlying asset.</p>
<p>Over 90 some percent is consolidated,</p>
<p>less than 1% of the holders for Dogecoin</p>
<p>at a very, very low price point.</p>
<p>So they can sell at almost any price point</p>
<p>and make a profit.</p>
<p>So it hits 50 cents, they&rsquo;re billionaires</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not like 20,000 people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably less than 100 wallets</p>
<p>that have that distribution.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this existential ticking time bomb</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in Doge that once the guys who are invested</p>
<p>start selling, they can just keep selling</p>
<p>and keep selling and ride it all the way down</p>
<p>and make windfall profits regardless</p>
<p>of what price they sell at.</p>
<p>And who are they selling against?</p>
<p>The retail investors.</p>
<p>People make $500, spare money a month</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And it bothers me because I see it in my community.</p>
<p>So I live in Longmont, Colorado,</p>
<p>and I was at a restaurant and I was talking to the waitress</p>
<p>and she asked me what business I was in.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, what is that?</p>
<p>And I started explaining all of it.</p>
<p>And she goes, oh, yeah, I own some Dogecoin.</p>
<p>I said, you own anything else?</p>
<p>No, no, I just bought some Doge.</p>
<p>Why did you buy Doge?</p>
<p>Oh, I saw Elon tweeting about it</p>
<p>and I thought it was a good deal.</p>
<p>So when you see stuff like that</p>
<p>where people have no clue what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really understand the supply dynamics,</p>
<p>the ownership dynamics and these types of things.</p>
<p>And then when the clock stops,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the ones who get hurt.</p>
<p>And then the regulator comes in,</p>
<p>the Elizabeth Warrens of the world,</p>
<p>and they say, see, this is an evidence</p>
<p>these guys can&rsquo;t regulate themselves, control themselves.</p>
<p>We need to control everything.</p>
<p>Either let&rsquo;s ban it or let&rsquo;s just announce</p>
<p>that the only three are legitimate</p>
<p>and every one of them has to be connected</p>
<p>to identity and rah, rah, rah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just very concerned that that&rsquo;s a bad thing to do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been so vocal about this topic.</p>
<p>And my hope is that a compromise can be made</p>
<p>where real developers come in and they start working on Doge</p>
<p>and they find a way to create some sort of use</p>
<p>and utility for it.</p>
<p>So at least it has a value floor and it won&rsquo;t collapse.</p>
<p>Is it possible for Cardano and Dogecoin</p>
<p>to work together somehow?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;d be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not adverse to the idea of cleaning up the code base,</p>
<p>but legitimately, whoever comes in,</p>
<p>be two years or three years of work,</p>
<p>because you have to do real stuff.</p>
<p>And that code is like Litecoin circa 2012, 2013.</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing about Elon,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve got to interact with him quite a bit,</p>
<p>that combination of humor and extreme ambition,</p>
<p>like in the face of impossible odds</p>
<p>is something he does really well.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s the spirit of Dogecoin</p>
<p>is fun and almost like bold, ambitious innovation.</p>
<p>And so I think you can&rsquo;t discount the power of that.</p>
<p>But where&rsquo;s the innovation?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the agenda?</p>
<p>Well, this is step one.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to Mars for Dogecoin?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, he came in the same way to Ruckus.</p>
<p>He came in the same way to Electric Cars.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible at first,</p>
<p>but you step in and you solve the problems,</p>
<p>first principles one at a time.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you a little bit on this,</p>
<p>because I think he had some trends</p>
<p>that he was very smart to recognize.</p>
<p>In the case of battery powered cars,</p>
<p>he said, hang on, everybody has tablets and cell phones</p>
<p>and these other things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an incentive to make batteries better,</p>
<p>faster, cheaper, and charge faster.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s connected to mobile computing.</p>
<p>So regardless if you want battery powered cars or not,</p>
<p>every year you have billions of dollars of R&amp;D</p>
<p>being pushed to force this capacity to evolve.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just getting on the train</p>
<p>and piggybacking on that.</p>
<p>So that was a brilliant business acumen to recognize that.</p>
<p>In the case of SpaceX, it was just an obvious question.</p>
<p>If every time you get on a plane,</p>
<p>you have to throw the plane away, no one would fly.</p>
<p>So reusability is like a fundamental thing</p>
<p>that if you solve that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve now opened space up</p>
<p>to a complete new class of commercialization.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the problem in Dogecoin,</p>
<p>because if he was looking for it,</p>
<p>then why not look at a real platform</p>
<p>actually trying to solve a real problem?</p>
<p>There are so many of them.</p>
<p>He can throw a rock, he can hit 15 of these guys</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d all die to work with you at Musk.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, so first I could continue pushing back</p>
<p>on your intuition about electric cars</p>
<p>and batteries and so on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s more obvious in retrospect</p>
<p>than it is at the time, I would say,</p>
<p>because I would agree with you on the batteries front,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily agree with you with the electric car</p>
<p>because first of all,</p>
<p>nobody started a successful car company for decades.</p>
<p>Well, but it was the loyalty,</p>
<p>the EV4 guys or whatever it was with GM,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t wanna give them back</p>
<p>when they hit the lease program.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some basic intuition</p>
<p>that there is some hunger here,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not obvious that you can do it successfully.</p>
<p>And with relaunching rockets for cheap,</p>
<p>that sounds good on paper, but to do it well,</p>
<p>NASA is spending way more money for this.</p>
<p>And the Russians were assholes, not selling any rocket.</p>
<p>Like you said, you have to do it all yourself from scratch.</p>
<p>How do you build the team?</p>
<p>How do you launch rockets when if you fail a few times,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna go bankrupt?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just business wise,</p>
<p>I would rather build an app like Angry Birds.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, he&rsquo;s got it.</p>
<p>Launch rockets.</p>
<p>You gotta give him credit.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got boulders for balls.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good picture.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you for that.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, maybe that&rsquo;s what, I mean,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s not enough first principle thinking</p>
<p>on the cryptocurrency side.</p>
<p>I think I agree with you on that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some aspect to which the seriousness</p>
<p>of the cryptocurrency world is paralyzing.</p>
<p>So in some way, the innovation that you spoke to</p>
<p>requires taking risks,</p>
<p>requires not taking everything so seriously,</p>
<p>like being afraid to take those bold risks</p>
<p>in the space of ideas, not in the space of financials.</p>
<p>So in that way, I think that&rsquo;s one pro for Bitcoin</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s room, it&rsquo;s hungry for innovation.</p>
<p>But I think Cardano in that same way</p>
<p>is hungry for innovation, just like as you said,</p>
<p>with some more rigor and formalism behind it.</p>
<p>I mean, even Ethereum has a hunger for innovation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Bitcoin is a little bit more,</p>
<p>I would say conservative in terms of how much innovating</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re willing to do,</p>
<p>in terms of the incentives they built into the systems</p>
<p>for the evolution of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s difficult to psychoanalyze</p>
<p>why Dogecoin is the thing that excites Elon so much.</p>
<p>But at the same time, there&rsquo;s some power to the fun.</p>
<p>It sounds ridiculous to say.</p>
<p>But the fun, this idea that</p>
<p>the most entertaining outcome is the most likely.</p>
<p>There could be something built into the physics</p>
<p>of the universe that makes that true.</p>
<p>Because the viral nature of fun has power.</p>
<p>A fun has power.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a neuroscience thing.</p>
<p>We like dopamine, we like these chemicals in our brain.</p>
<p>And when we have fun, we want more of it.</p>
<p>So you tend to gravitate towards work activities</p>
<p>and play activities that are enjoyable to you.</p>
<p>And it is nice sometimes to kind of come in</p>
<p>and troll an entire industry.</p>
<p>I can imagine he&rsquo;s probably at the time of his life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same as like taking Tesla private at 420.</p>
<p>That kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one thing when you do it with friends.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another thing when you do it with the whole industry</p>
<p>and it hurts people financially.</p>
<p>And also I understand he hates short sellers</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some things there.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t speak for him</p>
<p>because I only know the guy from a distance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I live in this space</p>
<p>and I have to deal with the consequences</p>
<p>and clean up the mess.</p>
<p>You feel the pain.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this results in a regulatory event.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m the guy who has to put on a suit</p>
<p>and go to Washington and go and sit in a Senate inquiry</p>
<p>and all this stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the guy that just like laugh with his friends</p>
<p>about how he crashed the crypto market</p>
<p>and how easy it was to do it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my only umbrage about this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it brings a lot of cool,</p>
<p>new, interesting things and people into the space,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a net positive.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not universally bad or universally good.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to give people the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m really hopeful to see what comes about</p>
<p>this recent surge of interest</p>
<p>and if Elon actually puts his money where his mouth is</p>
<p>and take some of his enormous engineering talent</p>
<p>and capital and starts contributing</p>
<p>and building something in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>Be really cool to see that happen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of different technical aspects</p>
<p>I wanna ask you about on the Cardano side.</p>
<p>So first maybe on the scaling side, what is Hydra?</p>
<p>How does Hydra compare to other different ideas</p>
<p>for scalability like rollups,</p>
<p>main trade offs with respect to security, UX,</p>
<p>and anything else you wanna talk about?</p>
<p>You have to have a little bit more energy, Lex, come on.</p>
<p>You know what I need?</p>
<p>I need that Coke machine that you mentioned,</p>
<p>the thing that converts water to cocaine.</p>
<p>Water to cocaine from Director Bullock.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll leave this in, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Isomorphic state channels, that&rsquo;s a great topic, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a word salad of cryptographic terms.</p>
<p>Whether lightning, Hydra, rollups, any of these things,</p>
<p>really what you&rsquo;re trying to do is say,</p>
<p>okay, if I do it on layer one, it&rsquo;s slow and expensive.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m gonna do is batch something somehow, some way,</p>
<p>and then do it in a different system</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s fast and cheap.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m doing with that is I&rsquo;m losing</p>
<p>some of the security guarantees of the base layer</p>
<p>and admitting a slight higher degree of centralization,</p>
<p>but then I get super fast settlement,</p>
<p>I get super low cost transactions,</p>
<p>and potentially I may even be able</p>
<p>to get distributed computing.</p>
<p>Meaning that instead of having the smart contracts</p>
<p>run in a replicated system,</p>
<p>they could run on a single node, like a stake pool,</p>
<p>and their stuff is different from the other guy&rsquo;s stuff.</p>
<p>So you go from a system of capacity of whatever it is</p>
<p>to a system of N for the totality of all the stake pools.</p>
<p>So basically Hydra is just the next generation of that.</p>
<p>When you have the ability to tinker with the accounting model</p>
<p>and the layer two solution is co designed</p>
<p>with the layer one solution.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like what Lightning would have been</p>
<p>had Lightning been co developed when Bitcoin came out.</p>
<p>There would have been special provisions made in Bitcoin,</p>
<p>specifically to accommodate Lightning,</p>
<p>and it would have made it very easy for you then</p>
<p>to move inside the system, outside of the system,</p>
<p>and have security properties preserved,</p>
<p>like availability, for example, or fraud resistance,</p>
<p>say, oh, you can&rsquo;t steal the money or these types of things.</p>
<p>Where things get really complex,</p>
<p>and this is why Hydra&rsquo;s novel over Lightning,</p>
<p>is when you wanna move beyond payments to state management.</p>
<p>Okay, so payments are just,</p>
<p>I wanna move between Alice to Bob as quickly as possible,</p>
<p>as low cost as possible.</p>
<p>So for example, I have a micro tipping application,</p>
<p>like change tip on Twitter, or like a video,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching YouTube video,</p>
<p>like maybe this video in the future,</p>
<p>and people really like it, and they click tip,</p>
<p>and you get five cents or something like that.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s an example of a perfect payment application,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s great, but what happens</p>
<p>when you actually have a rich smart contract,</p>
<p>like a DEX, or you wanna do a video game,</p>
<p>or something like that, you wanna run that off chain,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s some reconciliation on chain that happens.</p>
<p>So a state channel basically lets you do that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a lot more complicated,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot more to think about.</p>
<p>So Hydra basically just has in its design,</p>
<p>a collection of ideas of how to do that.</p>
<p>And the current paper is for a single head.</p>
<p>The next thing you do is composition.</p>
<p>So you go multiple heads,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a routing protocol between them.</p>
<p>And then eventually create these tail protocols</p>
<p>for when things get asynchronous.</p>
<p>So instead of always being aligned,</p>
<p>and always being available,</p>
<p>what happens if they die for a bit,</p>
<p>and then they come back?</p>
<p>And you can create all kinds of guarantees</p>
<p>that your funds won&rsquo;t be lost, or locked forever,</p>
<p>or things like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a failure recovery mode for this type of stuff.</p>
<p>And basically the idea is leverage what Lightning</p>
<p>has already achieved with Bitcoin,</p>
<p>but then take advantage of the fact</p>
<p>that you have a more expressive accounting model,</p>
<p>and a more expressive programming model,</p>
<p>so you can just physically do more,</p>
<p>and you can put more crypto into that thing.</p>
<p>Now contrast it with rollups,</p>
<p>really that is just saying,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna take some thing,</p>
<p>batch a bunch of transactions together,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna generate a proof.</p>
<p>And then what you can do is whenever you see</p>
<p>some part of that history,</p>
<p>you can check it against that proof that&rsquo;s rolled up.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re closely related concept of recursive snarks</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll see a lot.</p>
<p>Things like the MENA protocol, or other things.</p>
<p>And basically the idea is that whenever you see something,</p>
<p>you can always generate two proofs.</p>
<p>An existential proofs that the coins exist,</p>
<p>and a non existence of a double spend.</p>
<p>So you can always check those two properties.</p>
<p>And the proof is verifiable in logarithmic time, ideally.</p>
<p>So you can have giant amounts of data,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very small.</p>
<p>The actual proof is concise, okay?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re just different boats for different floats.</p>
<p>The advantage of a layer two network</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s actual channels,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s interaction, and there&rsquo;s service providers,</p>
<p>is the channels can eventually scale</p>
<p>in the collection of things that they can do.</p>
<p>And eventually they can become interoperability networks</p>
<p>between cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>So at some point, we could modify the bolt spec,</p>
<p>and make it somewhat interoperable with Hydra.</p>
<p>And then what you could happen is you could use it</p>
<p>as a bridge to actually do cross chain traffic,</p>
<p>and send transactions between the systems.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really think about that too much</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about roll ups.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more of optimizing what you have within the system.</p>
<p>Within the chain, so can you elaborate</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s possible to do cross chain traffic?</p>
<p>Well, you already have the intermediary,</p>
<p>you have the channel operator,</p>
<p>and you already have lightning protocol, right?</p>
<p>And you just build a dex that runs within that system,</p>
<p>and they can swap assets, or you can do wrapped assets.</p>
<p>So you lock it. So it would be like low cost?</p>
<p>I guess you could just switch low.</p>
<p>Yeah, the same thing lets you batch things on one,</p>
<p>will let you batch the other.</p>
<p>So if lightning works on Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and Hydra works on Cardano,</p>
<p>you can eventually bridge these two together,</p>
<p>and create a way of moving back and forth.</p>
<p>And the same things that make transactions</p>
<p>in and out of that network cheap,</p>
<p>will make creating wrapped assets cheap.</p>
<p>At least on the Bitcoin to Cardano side,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t create assets on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Another flaw of Bitcoin that they&rsquo;ve never fixed.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your thought about layer two technologies in general?</p>
<p>Is there stuff you&rsquo;re excited about?</p>
<p>We talked quite a bit about Lightning Network, Hydra,</p>
<p>and these ideas.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;ll be somebody that wins out,</p>
<p>or is this gonna be this kind of dynamic thing</p>
<p>that we just keep building different ideas,</p>
<p>and they all interact with each other?</p>
<p>It goes back to biology,</p>
<p>that cell differentiation concept,</p>
<p>is you have to build specialized tissue to do these things.</p>
<p>The point of layer two is to extend the network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s adding a foot, it&rsquo;s adding an arm,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s adding a brain, it&rsquo;s adding a heart, it&rsquo;s adding eyes,</p>
<p>giving you additional senses, you have ears now.</p>
<p>So when you add these layer two protocols,</p>
<p>like Atala Prism is a perfect example of that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have identity at the base layer of Cardano.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real bad deal to do that,</p>
<p>because then China will come in,</p>
<p>or US will come in and tell you how to do that.</p>
<p>What you do is you build a layer two protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s blockchain agnostic,</p>
<p>and then the user can decide</p>
<p>when and where they need an identity,</p>
<p>and then bring that identity into the system.</p>
<p>And if you designed it right, when they bring it in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy, very fluid,</p>
<p>and suddenly the experience enhances.</p>
<p>Everything just gets better.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, okay, now I can use all these regulated things.</p>
<p>They go from gray to green in the App Store.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>Or, oh, wow, now I can send to human readable addresses,</p>
<p>because if I have an identity and you have an identity,</p>
<p>we can alias them with some namespace,</p>
<p>and now I sent a Lex instead of some</p>
<p>horrible back 32 address structure.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s really what you need to do with layer two</p>
<p>is say, okay, each layer two protocol</p>
<p>is meant to do something.</p>
<p>Either it gives me payments, or lower cost smart contracts,</p>
<p>or interoperability, or identity,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s a marketplace.</p>
<p>So you should have blockchain agnosticism</p>
<p>with your layer two solutions.</p>
<p>And so you can mix and match</p>
<p>and choose whichever collection of services you need.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually how IT works these days</p>
<p>with microservices and these other things,</p>
<p>and cloud software, you know.</p>
<p>Every firm is an aggregation of dozens of providers,</p>
<p>and basically that composition of them</p>
<p>is your software stack.</p>
<p>Jumping around back to proof of work.</p>
<p>What are non interactive proofs of proof of work?</p>
<p>NIPOPOWS.</p>
<p>NIPOPOWS.</p>
<p>NIPOPOWS, it&rsquo;s fun to say, right?</p>
<p>NIPOPOWS.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of those things that you notice</p>
<p>that certain proofs of work, when you solve them,</p>
<p>come up less frequently than other ones.</p>
<p>And just by that nature, you can sample them</p>
<p>and then construct proofs from them.</p>
<p>So you can, with that just set,</p>
<p>have a more concise representation</p>
<p>of an amount of work for a range of the chain.</p>
<p>So that works.</p>
<p>Can you say that again?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was gonna say that word salad,</p>
<p>basically the idea is, okay, so let&rsquo;s say that this block,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just simplifying the concept a lot.</p>
<p>This block, you get a regular green type of proof of work,</p>
<p>and then this block, you get a green,</p>
<p>and you keep going, and then suddenly you get a red one.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still a valid proof of work,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more rare than the other ones.</p>
<p>So if you notice that particular pattern,</p>
<p>what you can do is you can just start</p>
<p>not caring so much about the green ones,</p>
<p>and you can just bookend your chain with red.</p>
<p>And then you can just repeat that, and repeat that,</p>
<p>repeat that, and you can collect,</p>
<p>and you can create this really compressed representation</p>
<p>of these things.</p>
<p>So what does it mean?</p>
<p>It means that suddenly when you have that,</p>
<p>now you have a way of representing a long range of history</p>
<p>with a very small proof.</p>
<p>So you can use it for light wallets,</p>
<p>and you also can use it for side chains,</p>
<p>if both side chains use proof of work.</p>
<p>So when you see a transaction come in,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a copy of the side chain,</p>
<p>but you have a copy of the proof of work,</p>
<p>and it has the same algorithmic weight</p>
<p>as the normal longest chain,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have all the greens,</p>
<p>but the reds only occur with a certain sampling frequency.</p>
<p>So this is the brainchild of Dionysus Zintros and Agelos,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just an amazing paper,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s so cool about it is it doesn&rsquo;t require</p>
<p>any structural changes to proof of work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something you notice</p>
<p>as an off gas of proof of work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re watching an engine operate,</p>
<p>and you notice like every 500 times a piston</p>
<p>will do a certain weird thing,</p>
<p>and so you take advantage of that.</p>
<p>You say, well, if I count 10 of them,</p>
<p>now I have 5,000 pistons, strikes,</p>
<p>as I observed that pattern.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s the same concept there,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a property of the engine.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t really need to hard fork it in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just there, and because you can build proofs that way,</p>
<p>now you can use those proofs to do like clients,</p>
<p>and you can use those proofs to do other things,</p>
<p>because you can just use that as something</p>
<p>that comes with the history.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have the whole blockchain.</p>
<p>Now, is this a weird property</p>
<p>of multiple proof of work chains?</p>
<p>It has to be key to the particular consensus algorithm,</p>
<p>but usually there&rsquo;s some portability in this type of thing.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re right now exploring,</p>
<p>can you do NIPA piles with Prism</p>
<p>or any of these sharded proof of work protocols,</p>
<p>but it looks like you can.</p>
<p>The closely related is log space mining.</p>
<p>So you can use this concept,</p>
<p>and instead of having the entire blockchain</p>
<p>to be able to mine,</p>
<p>you can use a compressed representation of it.</p>
<p>We wrote a paper called Log Space Mining</p>
<p>that basically explains how to do that.</p>
<p>So your miner only has this very small micro ledger</p>
<p>as opposed to the entire ledger.</p>
<p>How does it connect back to the entire ledger?</p>
<p>How does the compressed?</p>
<p>Because you have those red blocks.</p>
<p>You have those special things,</p>
<p>and so you know that the state you&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>is actually legitimate, right?</p>
<p>So the map goes both ways?</p>
<p>Yep, it&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, and Denis is a genius.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a really, really smart kid,</p>
<p>and he got his PhD under us.</p>
<p>He went to University of Athens,</p>
<p>and he was Agelos&rsquo;s graduate student,</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s doing a postdoc at Stanford under David Shi,</p>
<p>and this is literally the only thing he does.</p>
<p>He does interoperability, sidechain stuff,</p>
<p>NIPA piles and so forth,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s written a lot of great papers on it.</p>
<p>And that was a testimony to hard work</p>
<p>for getting the paper published,</p>
<p>because the paper came out in 2016,</p>
<p>but I think it took three or four years</p>
<p>for it to go through peer review.</p>
<p>He kept trying to push it one conference</p>
<p>after another rejection, after another rejection,</p>
<p>but he got it through.</p>
<p>Real proud of that kid.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s just doing all this beautiful</p>
<p>derivative work now, like lock space mining and so forth.</p>
<p>So, Reddit.</p>
<p>Any sentence that starts with Reddit,</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s gonna be fun.</p>
<p>The top question on the Cardano subreddit,</p>
<p>which is quite a wonderful place, by the way,</p>
<p>was can you get Charles to play devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p>against Cardano?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s going to fail, what would failure look like</p>
<p>and what are the most likely reasons it would fail?</p>
<p>Okay, well there&rsquo;s the failure.</p>
<p>For example, I said one of the project goals</p>
<p>was to achieve self evolution.</p>
<p>So if it doesn&rsquo;t achieve that,</p>
<p>where it can evolve itself iteration by iteration,</p>
<p>then obviously the product didn&rsquo;t do what was intended.</p>
<p>If it continuously required the supervision of custodians</p>
<p>in order for it to succeed, the system just won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>The good news is we have a lot of data showing the opposite.</p>
<p>You know, we used to run a federated model</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re completely decentralized</p>
<p>for block production,</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t just happen overnight.</p>
<p>I mean, there was a whole process</p>
<p>with the incentivized test net</p>
<p>and the stake pool pioneers program</p>
<p>and the launch of Shelley</p>
<p>and the decrementing of the decentralization parameter.</p>
<p>And every step of the way people showed up</p>
<p>and had to do things.</p>
<p>And we went from several to thousands of people</p>
<p>who were regularly maintaining the infrastructure,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no guarantee that that would be sustainable.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the next step,</p>
<p>the smart contract step will achieve what we want.</p>
<p>And the next step, the governance step</p>
<p>will achieve what we want.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an experiment and all these types of things.</p>
<p>All cryptocurrencies, all companies are in a sense,</p>
<p>experiments when they are evolving the business model.</p>
<p>And as our case, our businesses systems and society,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re offering to the world a vision</p>
<p>of how to run humanity in a different way.</p>
<p>And the only way the system can do that</p>
<p>is by millions of people joining the system,</p>
<p>self evolving the system</p>
<p>and growing it in that particular direction.</p>
<p>Another failure scenario would be the system evolves</p>
<p>in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s self evolving,</p>
<p>but it goes into a more centralized dystopian way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s problematic as well.</p>
<p>What would that look like?</p>
<p>What would dystopia,</p>
<p>self evolution toward dystopia look like?</p>
<p>A small group of actors have total control</p>
<p>over who gets to use the system</p>
<p>and how they get to use the system.</p>
<p>And your use of the system is monitored</p>
<p>and shared with that small group of actors.</p>
<p>So social credit in China is a great example of that.</p>
<p>A small group of people have access to that.</p>
<p>And then your experience in Chinese society</p>
<p>is determined by it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an example of a failure mode.</p>
<p>And then another could be just network effect.</p>
<p>We start experiencing a churn rate</p>
<p>and the inputs don&rsquo;t match the outputs</p>
<p>and that you lose more than you gain.</p>
<p>And then over time, the system dies off.</p>
<p>However, that&rsquo;s really hard in practice.</p>
<p>Once you reach a certain network effect,</p>
<p>even if you become stagnant and stale,</p>
<p>you tend not to lose your users.</p>
<p>And our evangelism is unbelievable</p>
<p>in the Cardano community.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re number one for tattoos.</p>
<p>And if you think about that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a strange metric to have,</p>
<p>but there are brands that associate that way,</p>
<p>like Apple and Harley Davidson and so forth.</p>
<p>People tend to actually tattoo the logo.</p>
<p>Those people don&rsquo;t leave.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually walk away from the ecosystem.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fanboys to the core.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are here for life.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s dollar ADA, two cent ADA.</p>
<p>They believe in the mission, vision and value</p>
<p>of what we wish to achieve.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve become evangelists in that respect.</p>
<p>So the question is, does that community sustain itself?</p>
<p>And also does that community not make the same sins</p>
<p>and mistake of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>where they become toxic and maximalistic</p>
<p>and they start becoming highly religious</p>
<p>about whatever beliefs they have?</p>
<p>My hope is our community will be open and Socratic</p>
<p>and love the scientific method</p>
<p>and be willing to entertain ideas without adopting them</p>
<p>and discard ideas that are proven to be wrong.</p>
<p>If we become dogmatic and embrace an orthodoxy</p>
<p>that is a counterproductive innovation,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;ll stall out the ecosystem.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice I never said price in any of this.</p>
<p>I never said, hey, failure is if the price goes way down</p>
<p>and success is if the price goes way up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unfortunately the metric that most people use,</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t care less about it.</p>
<p>Because the reality is if you construct a system</p>
<p>that encompasses the entire globe</p>
<p>and has billions of users,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably gonna be a pretty valuable system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a secondary thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an after effect of having success</p>
<p>in adoption, use and utility.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most people on Reddit and Twitter</p>
<p>and other channels,</p>
<p>they tend to just judge your entire success based on that.</p>
<p>I had very few people when Shelley launched,</p>
<p>even though it took us four years to get there,</p>
<p>a lot of work, say congratulations on Shelley.</p>
<p>But I had a lot of people when Ada reached the dollar</p>
<p>say, we&rsquo;re so proud of you, amazing work,</p>
<p>congratulations and so forth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably the most disheartening thing</p>
<p>about the whole being around and doing this stuff</p>
<p>where all the things you do only matter</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s making someone else rich.</p>
<p>And in a way I feel almost like a failure</p>
<p>because that mindset means that we haven&rsquo;t yet</p>
<p>inculcated the community in a proper way,</p>
<p>saying, hey guys, this is about more than money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about more than the value of Ada.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re attempting to do here</p>
<p>is reengineer the way society works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like your voting to be different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like your property to be different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you on your cell phone to have a universal wallet.</p>
<p>And when you go to Starbucks or wherever,</p>
<p>you can buy your coffee with silver or gold</p>
<p>or airline miles or something like that.</p>
<p>And they get paid whenever the hell they wanna get paid.</p>
<p>And I want those rails to be done with a system</p>
<p>that puts you in charge, not someone else.</p>
<p>And they say, yeah, that&rsquo;s all fine and great.</p>
<p>As long as Ada&rsquo;s $5, we&rsquo;re all happy.</p>
<p>You see, so that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>There are of course other things that could fail,</p>
<p>like we could lose project cohesion,</p>
<p>lots of people could quit and die.</p>
<p>But again, there&rsquo;s so much momentum.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things here.</p>
<p>The ideas are already out there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no intellectual property.</p>
<p>When you publish a hundred papers,</p>
<p>you read a million lines of code,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something and it&rsquo;s permanent.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in the commons now.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just as much yours as it is mine.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no notion that somehow,</p>
<p>if the core development company disappeared,</p>
<p>then that concept is lost forever,</p>
<p>like the library of Alexandria burning to the ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And someone else will take it, fork it and get it done.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>The self evolution,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know which trajectories that&rsquo;s gonna take,</p>
<p>but also there&rsquo;s could be singular events</p>
<p>like bugs in the system create an opportunity</p>
<p>to hack the system.</p>
<p>Is that something that you see</p>
<p>as a potential failure case?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s always a possibility.</p>
<p>Bugs can exist.</p>
<p>There can be flaws in the protocol design.</p>
<p>Zcash was a great example of that,</p>
<p>where there was a subtle flaw</p>
<p>and it damaged the fidelity of the cryptocurrency</p>
<p>in ways no other cryptocurrencies ever experienced.</p>
<p>Normally when you have a bug,</p>
<p>the bug you can see it like the Bitcoin overflow,</p>
<p>the value overflow incident.</p>
<p>Yes, Bitcoin can be created,</p>
<p>but we can verify they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So the monetary policy is preserved.</p>
<p>When you have a bug with a private system like Zcash</p>
<p>and it exists on the shielded side,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no guarantee unless you can audit</p>
<p>the total supply inside that shielded side.</p>
<p>My understanding is you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that somebody didn&rsquo;t exploit the bug</p>
<p>and create trillions of these coins out of thin air</p>
<p>and just hiding them on that system and dripping them out.</p>
<p>And so the monetary policy is forever damaged</p>
<p>as a consequence of bug like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the worst type of bug you can have</p>
<p>for these types of products.</p>
<p>So no matter how good of a job you do,</p>
<p>they have great scientists,</p>
<p>there are great people there, great engineers there.</p>
<p>You can always have something like that,</p>
<p>seep its way in, leak its way in,</p>
<p>and that lurks in the distance.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s a problem shared</p>
<p>with every one of your neighbors,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like everybody working on a nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, you can all die of radiation poisoning.</p>
<p>Well, we all kind of knew that, didn&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t really think too much about it.</p>
<p>I think the context of the question was more,</p>
<p>what is Cardano specific over Ethereum or Bitcoin</p>
<p>or any of these other things?</p>
<p>And yeah, okay, existential lurking bug could happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lower probability for us than the other systems</p>
<p>because we use formal methods</p>
<p>and we use peer review inside the protocol design.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been more eyeballs and tools and techniques</p>
<p>used to check things.</p>
<p>And we actually have discovered</p>
<p>a lot of weird wonky bugs before production</p>
<p>and resolve those bugs.</p>
<p>So it shows you the system works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>What about close kind of competitors?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you would put it that way,</p>
<p>but if you look in the space of ideas,</p>
<p>competitor cryptocurrencies like Polkadot,</p>
<p>what are some interesting difference</p>
<p>between Cardano and Polkadot?</p>
<p>Technically, philosophically, historically,</p>
<p>is that something you think about</p>
<p>when you think about the future of Cardano?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we do.</p>
<p>We actually have a whole group of people</p>
<p>that do business intelligence and comparative analysis.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re getting to a point</p>
<p>where we wanna start eventually forking their code</p>
<p>and running private versions of it</p>
<p>and just playing around with things.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Getting better at it.</p>
<p>Consensus actually does this.</p>
<p>They actually did it with EOS.</p>
<p>And they wrote this lovely report like trashing EOS,</p>
<p>saying, hey, by the way,</p>
<p>all those claims these guys made are just not true.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s nice to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to use your competitor&rsquo;s technology</p>
<p>or competing protocol technology</p>
<p>because you learn a lot along the process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all bad.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always something there</p>
<p>because they have different trade offs and customers</p>
<p>that potentially are more interesting.</p>
<p>Like right now we&rsquo;re grokking,</p>
<p>how do we wanna do the side chain model of Cardano?</p>
<p>Polkadot&rsquo;s actually a tremendously useful piece</p>
<p>of infrastructure for that conversation</p>
<p>because they copied part of our infrastructure.</p>
<p>Gavin&rsquo;s a trained computer scientist.</p>
<p>He got his PhD from York and he read our papers obviously.</p>
<p>And he realized that Ouroboros was a really good</p>
<p>starting place for building a proof of stake system.</p>
<p>So Polkadot&rsquo;s consensus is very similar to ours.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>hey, how do you do a good side chain model</p>
<p>with an Ouroboros style proof of stake?</p>
<p>Well, we already have this parachain thing, right?</p>
<p>And so now by just looking at that,</p>
<p>I can kind of get an idea of how, one way of doing it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just beautiful that we live in a space</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s open source,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>You just say, okay, well, we&rsquo;ll just take that</p>
<p>and adopt that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no shame.</p>
<p>The other side of it is that Polkadot</p>
<p>really has focused a lot on commercial adoption,</p>
<p>Silicon Valley adoption, getting real use and utility.</p>
<p>I say in a much more sustainable way</p>
<p>than Ethereum is focused on.</p>
<p>Ethereum was kind of a spray and pray thing.</p>
<p>Polkadot was more of like,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s go ahead and actually</p>
<p>curate our ecosystem more carefully.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna build it in a way</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s predictable or as predictable a cost</p>
<p>as possible with the rollout of the infrastructure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so important for a business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily important for an experiment</p>
<p>or a startup where they&rsquo;re just trying</p>
<p>to get populations quickly as possible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll figure out later.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re actually sitting there saying,</p>
<p>I need to know what my expenses are three years,</p>
<p>five years, 10 years into the future,</p>
<p>you need predictability there.</p>
<p>I think they have a better shot of it than anything</p>
<p>in F2 or with currently Ethereum.</p>
<p>Now, the big contrast between the two systems,</p>
<p>those we actually have native multi asset,</p>
<p>we have a different accounting model.</p>
<p>I think our base ledger is far more expressive.</p>
<p>Our rate of evolution was proof of stake</p>
<p>is much faster than theirs</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re based on derivative work</p>
<p>and we already have Ouroboros Omega and other things there.</p>
<p>I think we have a better,</p>
<p>ultimately a better side chain model will come</p>
<p>because we have something called Mythril for that.</p>
<p>But we learned a lot from their work.</p>
<p>The other thing is that we thought about governance</p>
<p>a lot more carefully in my view.</p>
<p>And we have Catalyst and Voltaire</p>
<p>and really the key there is saying,</p>
<p>how do we make sure that every single person</p>
<p>who holds data can participate in the network?</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t a high design priority of Polkadot.</p>
<p>It was more a fast commercial adoption.</p>
<p>The acquisition of customers will come to governance later.</p>
<p>And those were just different business philosophies.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s nice to have a competitor like that.</p>
<p>And oftentimes I&rsquo;ve said that Polkadot&rsquo;s like Ethereum 1.5.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what F2 probably should have been.</p>
<p>There was what Vitalik wanted to do,</p>
<p>which was incredibly aggressive and brilliant,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so much execution risk in that plan.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;ve had like six years</p>
<p>of playing around with it.</p>
<p>Had they gone down the Polkadot road,</p>
<p>they probably would have been a market with it</p>
<p>in 2018.</p>
<p>And because they already had the network effect,</p>
<p>they would have had years of building on that,</p>
<p>iterating that.</p>
<p>And they already had a path to it too.</p>
<p>All they had to do was just give Elaine Chi</p>
<p>and her cohorts at Cornell,</p>
<p>five, $10 million grants.</p>
<p>Snow White would have been the dominant protocol,</p>
<p>not Ouroboros in the proof of stake space.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really fascinating historically</p>
<p>when you look at these things and the rivalries</p>
<p>and what they did and what they didn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>And Gavin had a chance to have C++ Ethereum</p>
<p>be used as IBM&rsquo;s enterprise blockchain.</p>
<p>The only reason they didn&rsquo;t do it is it was licensed GPL.</p>
<p>And I think they wanted to relicense Apache.</p>
<p>If you ever talked to Bob Summerwall,</p>
<p>he was there at the time and he had this amazing story</p>
<p>about like these terrible fights where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>guys, just relicense the goddamn code.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure out a way to make this happen</p>
<p>so that we can get this huge network effect</p>
<p>of being basically IBM&rsquo;s play.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t do it, they created Fabric,</p>
<p>these types of things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of lore and stories in that respect.</p>
<p>But the space is better because of Polkadot.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of good people there.</p>
<p>Web3 is a good concept.</p>
<p>And we run into their people in Germany and Zurich a lot.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve always been cordial and friendly</p>
<p>and really affable.</p>
<p>Before I talk to you about governance,</p>
<p>which is one of the most fascinating things about Cardano,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff to untangle there.</p>
<p>Since you mentioned some humans</p>
<p>in this wonderful story,</p>
<p>you did make a video before we talked directed to me.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for that.</p>
<p>It came from a place of love.</p>
<p>But it was basically saying, as we have been,</p>
<p>you would love to talk about the technology,</p>
<p>about the future that you&rsquo;re creating with Cardano</p>
<p>and just the future of the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re kind of worried</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll be talking to a journalist</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s looking for clickbait content, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m fascinated by human beings.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re all, from an outsider perspective,</p>
<p>incredible human beings.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about personal intentions,</p>
<p>all those kinds of stuff,</p>
<p>but I think you&rsquo;re changing the world together</p>
<p>in different ways.</p>
<p>And I just wanted to sort of give you an opportunity.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s, in the name of love and friendship,</p>
<p>is there something from your history</p>
<p>over the past decade or so,</p>
<p>outside of technology and the human side of things</p>
<p>that you draw inspiration from, you draw insight from,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just proud that happened?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like asking Paul McCartney about John Lennon.</p>
<p>Tell us about John Lennon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know.</p>
<p>How much do you hate Yoko?</p>
<p>For almost eight years now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, it&rsquo;s just been this reoccurring pattern</p>
<p>every interview.</p>
<p>Tell us about your time at Ethereum.</p>
<p>Those six months you spent there</p>
<p>that were so pleasant and enjoyable.</p>
<p>Tell us all about it.</p>
<p>And tell us about your relationship with Vitalik.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I barely talk to the guy.</p>
<p>I see him every now and then.</p>
<p>Like, every two years we say, hey.</p>
<p>He says, hey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>Maybe 10, 20 years in the future,</p>
<p>Walt Mossberg or Robo Walt will bring us together</p>
<p>like he did Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.</p>
<p>And we can kind of talk about, you know.</p>
<p>That was a tense conversation, by the way.</p>
<p>The 2007 interview?</p>
<p>Yeah, the 2007.</p>
<p>Oh, it was great though, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was the body language.</p>
<p>That was art.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was fascinating.</p>
<p>That was a fascinating study of human nature.</p>
<p>Yeah, so maybe that&rsquo;ll be us.</p>
<p>In like 10 or 20 years.</p>
<p>Who the hell knows?</p>
<p>The robot versions of all three of you.</p>
<p>Yeah, my only point though is that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a closed chapter and it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I was there for six months.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been building Cardano for years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done all this stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to 52 countries.</p>
<p>I love talking about those experiences.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met heads of state.</p>
<p>You know, I went to Mongolia, like eagle hunting</p>
<p>and, you know, being bucked off horses</p>
<p>and riding the sand dunes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve invented all this new cool technology</p>
<p>that the space itself is using.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had a chance to sit on government panels,</p>
<p>pass laws, 24 laws in Wyoming.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s like all this amazing stuff that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a fun conversation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many superheroes in that conversation,</p>
<p>like Cailin Long and Taylor Limholm.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s Alex Sherpanoi, who we already mentioned</p>
<p>that I met along the travels.</p>
<p>I met Ralph Merkle.</p>
<p>Cool, I met all these amazing people along the way.</p>
<p>I have fond memories of,</p>
<p>by the way, you should interview him, by the way.</p>
<p>Amazing guy, does nanotech now.</p>
<p>You know, I met, you know, I was hanging out</p>
<p>with Sylvia McCauley.</p>
<p>And I remember before we launched Yalgrant,</p>
<p>I said, you should really just do a Bitcoin cash style play</p>
<p>and airdrop Bitcoin.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing distributing this?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, trust me, I know what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>You know, so it&rsquo;s like so many great conversations</p>
<p>and so many great people.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;ve really noticed in this industry,</p>
<p>when you separate the tribalism, the maximum side,</p>
<p>there really is a love of creativity and building.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like no other industry like it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in many different places in life.</p>
<p>And here, people just love art.</p>
<p>They love beauty.</p>
<p>They love the unknown.</p>
<p>They love pushing things.</p>
<p>They love, you know, really, you know, in some cases,</p>
<p>not necessarily the most socially beneficial way,</p>
<p>but they really love the challenge, right?</p>
<p>And that has been fun.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for anything in the world.</p>
<p>The dark side of the industry is that people love labels.</p>
<p>They love saying this person&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>This person&rsquo;s evil.</p>
<p>This person&rsquo;s a sociopath.</p>
<p>This person&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And by the way, they&rsquo;ve never met that person.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never interacted with that person.</p>
<p>And they just say, well, I heard from this person,</p>
<p>I read this book, or I did that.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, so some books written by a journalist</p>
<p>makes $50,000 a year who&rsquo;s looking for a movie deal,</p>
<p>say that somebody said this or did this</p>
<p>in an unconfirmed way.</p>
<p>What can you do, sue them for slander?</p>
<p>I mean, so you just let it ride and you let it roll.</p>
<p>And if it was just ending there, that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>But the problem is it cascades and people just repost it</p>
<p>and they relive it again and again and again.</p>
<p>And then what do you do about it?</p>
<p>You eventually just say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna talk about it anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done with it.</p>
<p>And you move on and you say, you know what?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s your problem, it&rsquo;s your problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your reality that you wanna live in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be defined by the things that I achieve and do</p>
<p>and the people that we help and the things that we build.</p>
<p>And, you know, since I started in this industry,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to a point where not only do we have</p>
<p>this amazing company with these incredible people</p>
<p>who work at this company,</p>
<p>but we also have the ability to pursue</p>
<p>amazing different interests.</p>
<p>Like I met Ben Gortzell.</p>
<p>And Ben and I are gonna do an AGI project together.</p>
<p>And of all places, Rwanda.</p>
<p>And he gave me this 85 fucking page paper.</p>
<p>He was wearing that damn hat that he always wears.</p>
<p>I think he showers with the hat on.</p>
<p>He never takes that thing off.</p>
<p>I think he refused, I interviewed him</p>
<p>and he refused to tell me the story of the hat.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t tell me either.</p>
<p>I interviewed him as well in Wyoming.</p>
<p>And every time I call him, he&rsquo;ll have his shirt off.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll have the fucking hat on.</p>
<p>And now all I can think about is the hat.</p>
<p>I wonder what the story there is.</p>
<p>I know, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s gotta be.</p>
<p>That might be the AGI.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But anyway, he gives me this 80 page paper</p>
<p>and he says, Charles, it&rsquo;s like the combination</p>
<p>of everything.</p>
<p>This is how we&rsquo;re gonna do AGI.</p>
<p>And I said, that&rsquo;s crazy, Ben.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;ll throw some money at it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna hire some developers.</p>
<p>I have no idea where it&rsquo;s gonna go,</p>
<p>but I mean, I get to hang out with Ben Corson.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the really cool side of the space.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what I enjoy.</p>
<p>And the Vitalik rivalry thing, the Ethereum thing,</p>
<p>I try my best not to mention it.</p>
<p>I hate the fact that still when Bloomberg</p>
<p>or anybody else writes a story about me,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say Ethereum co founder.</p>
<p>Like, can you say something else?</p>
<p>Well, I think if I&rsquo;ve learned anything from the internet,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t resist that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You just have to, this is Elon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the joke, joke it away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this, this is already starting</p>
<p>to happen with me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, people just make up stuff.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t made up anything interesting yet,</p>
<p>but they could.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen that with Bill Gates, for example,</p>
<p>just stuff being made up.</p>
<p>I mean, probably half of it is true.</p>
<p>Sorry, internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>But like, I guess what I realized,</p>
<p>this is the dark side of memes,</p>
<p>is you can just make something up and it&rsquo;ll spread.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>But then, and the problem is half the world will believe it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be good stuff, it could be bad stuff.</p>
<p>So I guess the hope is it bounces off in the end.</p>
<p>I tend to believe you almost want to play with that</p>
<p>and not take it seriously.</p>
<p>Just kind of laugh it off and enjoy life</p>
<p>and keep creating, keep doing awesome stuff.</p>
<p>Operating both in the physical space with other humans</p>
<p>and in the digital space with humans and AI systems</p>
<p>and just have fun.</p>
<p>Because most of us in the long arc of history</p>
<p>will be completely forgotten and will matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll all be some kind of,</p>
<p>just like H Hacker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</p>
<p>will just be one sentence that summarizes</p>
<p>all of our existence.</p>
<p>And the sad thing is most of us will not be part</p>
<p>of that sentence or all of us.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for all the fish, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the fish.</p>
<p>The dolphins are running this thing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re talking to the UFOs recently,</p>
<p>which is very interesting.</p>
<p>Because the UFOs keep going to the water.</p>
<p>So we humans assume that the UFOs are here to visit,</p>
<p>the aliens are here to visit us,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably the fish.</p>
<p>No, I just think it&rsquo;s next generation aircraft</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>Oh, that we&rsquo;re just not aware of.</p>
<p>But why are they talking to the fish?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the place you test hypersonic aircraft</p>
<p>is over oceans.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the Russians with their hypersonic nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a lot.</p>
<p>Rods from God, man, rods from God.</p>
<p>So let me try to transition from UFOs to Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>Lincoln said that nearly all men can stand adversity,</p>
<p>but if you want to test a man&rsquo;s character, give him power.</p>
<p>Do you think power and money can corrupt most people?</p>
<p>And if so, do you worry of this corrupting force</p>
<p>on your own mind?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the leading minds in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the leader of the Cardano project.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the king of the rats.</p>
<p>Does this corrupt your mind,</p>
<p>both the power and the money of it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you see this most pervasively</p>
<p>with people who inherit a large amount of money</p>
<p>or title like dynasties, like the Melons or the Rockefellers</p>
<p>or other people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the worst thing you can do to somebody</p>
<p>is just hand them an enormous amount of power</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not prepared for.</p>
<p>And the challenge with this space is like,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s young and we&rsquo;re all billionaires now</p>
<p>and we have these cult followings</p>
<p>and do all these things, right?</p>
<p>Nobody really says no to you.</p>
<p>Like, for example, I have this ranch up in Wyoming</p>
<p>and it has 400 bison on it.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m a bison rancher.</p>
<p>Like, if somebody was like monitoring, auditing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be like, Charles, do you have any experience</p>
<p>raising, taking care of bison?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, no.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s really a good idea</p>
<p>to have this ranch with 400 bison running around.</p>
<p>What the hell are you gonna do with bison?</p>
<p>I just have to figure out</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m gonna do with these bison.</p>
<p>So, and I, you know, we&rsquo;ll make a video game.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do crypto, we&rsquo;ll do crypto.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll make a video game, we&rsquo;ll do crypto bison.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re gonna get one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not pulling, thank you, I&rsquo;d love to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not pulling at that string just yet.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m wondering how you&rsquo;re gonna connect</p>
<p>this back to power.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so, but my point is that when you are unrestrained,</p>
<p>like literally no one can say no,</p>
<p>or you have the ability to distort reality around yourself</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not constrained by social customs,</p>
<p>it creates a situation where you start losing perspective.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not grounded anymore, I think.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s less of a question of, will you become evil or not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a question of,</p>
<p>will you lose so much touch with humanity</p>
<p>that you just can&rsquo;t relate or understand people?</p>
<p>And then you inadvertently, by your actions,</p>
<p>start harming people, either through the policies</p>
<p>that you pursue or, you know,</p>
<p>the things that you start building and so forth.</p>
<p>So I think the best inoculation against that</p>
<p>is to surround yourself with activities</p>
<p>that are utterly divorced from your reputation and status.</p>
<p>The best thing are animals and gardening.</p>
<p>Because, you know, a donkey doesn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a billionaire or a baroque,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll shit on you exactly the same way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a humility behind these types of activities</p>
<p>and these things, and there&rsquo;s a honest work component.</p>
<p>Like when you grow hay or whatever, you have to plant,</p>
<p>you have to actually water, you have to irrigate,</p>
<p>you have to actually be there.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t use some excuse,</p>
<p>well, I was meeting the president of El Salvador,</p>
<p>I was doing this, and the hay doesn&rsquo;t give a shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hay, right?</p>
<p>So it grounds and connects you.</p>
<p>The other thing is you have to get used to giving away.</p>
<p>All the best things in my life have come</p>
<p>as a consequence of first giving.</p>
<p>Like I got started in the cryptocurrency space</p>
<p>by giving away a free class.</p>
<p>Bitcoin or how we learn to stop worrying or love crypto.</p>
<p>You did a free podcast, right?</p>
<p>In life, if you give and you develop that mindset</p>
<p>of I&rsquo;m not attached to the things I have,</p>
<p>and if push comes to shove, it goes away,</p>
<p>usually you get more back.</p>
<p>Like I gave away all my ether, I never received any of it.</p>
<p>293,000 ether at the all time high over $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>I gave it to my secretary.</p>
<p>I had no idea if it was gonna be worth anything or not,</p>
<p>but he kind of got shafted.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, they don&rsquo;t like me,</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t like you by the transitive property</p>
<p>of relationships, so you&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, I&rsquo;m gonna go back</p>
<p>and my wife is probably gonna divorce me</p>
<p>and all this stuff, and what do I do?</p>
<p>And I said, well, I&rsquo;ll give you my ether.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna be worth anything.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s still pretty good.</p>
<p>But then again, regardless of doing that,</p>
<p>I now have Cordano, I have this great career,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done all these amazing things.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the single best way of handling power</p>
<p>is you have to do things to keep yourself grounded.</p>
<p>Case of Washington, he was deeply connected to Mount Vernon</p>
<p>during the Revolutionary War, he was like sending letters,</p>
<p>talking about the irrigation ditches and the barn</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>He was always connected to that.</p>
<p>And then also develop a mindset</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re only here temporarily.</p>
<p>Everything you have is finite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to go away at some point.</p>
<p>No matter how much you want to keep it, you will die</p>
<p>and somebody else will have it.</p>
<p>So you live for the next generation.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t live for yourself.</p>
<p>You look to the future and you say,</p>
<p>what am I going to leave behind?</p>
<p>What am I going to transmit?</p>
<p>And then in that kind of mindset always forces you</p>
<p>to be more gracious, cooperative</p>
<p>and collaborative with people.</p>
<p>All these dictators, they are egomaniacs</p>
<p>and they connected these fantasies</p>
<p>and they live for themselves.</p>
<p>Look at Xi in China, he&rsquo;s unraveling a power structure</p>
<p>that was what made China, China today.</p>
<p>After Mao, they said, we probably shouldn&rsquo;t have another</p>
<p>one of those guys.</p>
<p>And so they said, let&rsquo;s build something</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s checks and balances</p>
<p>and no one person is going to run the whole show</p>
<p>or else it&rsquo;ll descend and regress and we&rsquo;ll have problems.</p>
<p>And then what he&rsquo;s done, he&rsquo;s thinking only about himself,</p>
<p>not the best interest of China.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s systematically unraveling a system</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been embracing for over 40 years.</p>
<p>And to what end?</p>
<p>After he dies, the next guy who comes in,</p>
<p>even as he&rsquo;s super competent,</p>
<p>the next guy is going to horrifically abuse</p>
<p>that power structure.</p>
<p>And the same thing happened with the Romans.</p>
<p>After Augustus, the great emperor,</p>
<p>then suddenly down the line you have Caligula</p>
<p>and Nero and all these other terrible emperors</p>
<p>that just destroyed everything that the Republic</p>
<p>and the empire sought to achieve.</p>
<p>So you have to think for the future,</p>
<p>you have to think in institutions and systems,</p>
<p>you have to have things that ground yourself</p>
<p>and you have to be fully prepared to lose everything</p>
<p>and give up everything.</p>
<p>After I left Ethereum, I had nothing, okay?</p>
<p>Reputation was damaged, not a lot of money,</p>
<p>nobody really wanna work with me,</p>
<p>no one pick up a phone for two whole years, it was horrible.</p>
<p>And so I was at bedrock in that experience.</p>
<p>And now look at where I&rsquo;m at.</p>
<p>I built all the way up to that.</p>
<p>And so that wasn&rsquo;t by accident,</p>
<p>it was I had to surround myself with amazing people.</p>
<p>Why would amazing people wanna surround themselves</p>
<p>with me if I was this narcissistic asshole</p>
<p>who just was like, it&rsquo;s me, me, me,</p>
<p>everything would be a transactional relationship.</p>
<p>It would be okay, we&rsquo;ll get as much as we can</p>
<p>and then run away as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Instead it was, I&rsquo;m going to invest in you</p>
<p>and maybe I&rsquo;ll win, maybe I won&rsquo;t win,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll be the last guy to leave the boat.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re freezing to death, you get my coat</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just deal with the cold, that kind of mindset.</p>
<p>You have to have that, I got that from my dad,</p>
<p>he got it from his father.</p>
<p>My grandfather and great grandfather,</p>
<p>my dad said, I grew up in Montana</p>
<p>and they were products of the Homestead Act.</p>
<p>Very rough, Montana.</p>
<p>A lot of people died and froze to death up there</p>
<p>or eaten by animals or something</p>
<p>or shot by their neighbors.</p>
<p>And nobody investigates anything because it&rsquo;s Montana.</p>
<p>So the only way you survive is by taking care</p>
<p>of each other and being a good member of that community.</p>
<p>And if somebody gets big, you have this implicit desire</p>
<p>to go and give back and take care of the community</p>
<p>that you came from and invest in that community.</p>
<p>Like I came from the mathematical community.</p>
<p>I never completed a PhD, but one of the things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m doing is I&rsquo;m going to put $20 million</p>
<p>and set up a center to do automated theorem proving</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to heavily invest in lean</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m super excited about mechanizing math</p>
<p>and making machine understandable.</p>
<p>I know all these guys who do this work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like all these mathematicians</p>
<p>and computer scientists and no one pays attention to them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of like the redheaded stepchildren</p>
<p>of mathematics and they live on the boundaries</p>
<p>and periphery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they&rsquo;re super passionate</p>
<p>and they absolutely love what they do.</p>
<p>And if only they had the right resources,</p>
<p>within 50 or 100 years, what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>can probably become the dominant model</p>
<p>of how to do mathematics.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m now in a position where I have the financial means</p>
<p>to take care of these guys.</p>
<p>So all I have to do is just call them up and say,</p>
<p>hey, would you like to work with, oh, absolutely</p>
<p>and cut a check and it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>So the interesting tension here,</p>
<p>so we talked about ways to prevent power</p>
<p>from corrupting a human being</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in a leadership position.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting case in the cryptocurrency space</p>
<p>of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically doesn&rsquo;t have a leader.</p>
<p>So the benefit of a leader is somebody that perhaps</p>
<p>even when they don&rsquo;t carry power,</p>
<p>maintains a little bit of a flame of a vision.</p>
<p>I suppose Bitcoin has that with the original work</p>
<p>by Satoshi Nakamoto and the sort of that,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s anonymous,</p>
<p>the idea still lives on through the community,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, the leader is anonymous.</p>
<p>Do you think this is an interesting case study</p>
<p>about leadership is for the leader to maintain anonymity?</p>
<p>It was a saying from Sun Tzu, paraphrasing it,</p>
<p>the best leaders are felt but never seen.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>The less the leader can be in the room</p>
<p>and the more the principles of the leader are in the room,</p>
<p>the better for the firm</p>
<p>because what you&rsquo;re doing is creating more leaders that way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re inspiring the next generation,</p>
<p>the next wave, the next circle out</p>
<p>to act with those principles,</p>
<p>but contribute in their own way and their own flair.</p>
<p>And so you gain collective intelligence</p>
<p>inside the organization</p>
<p>instead of just constraining yourself</p>
<p>to however the great the leader can be.</p>
<p>The other side of it is if the leader&rsquo;s principles</p>
<p>are too strong, so this is the dark side of it,</p>
<p>you end up having Disney with Walt Disney after he died.</p>
<p>For 20 years, people said, we don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>because Walt Disney wouldn&rsquo;t do it that way.</p>
<p>Or to a lesser extent, Apple is the only don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>because Steve Jobs wouldn&rsquo;t do it that way.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s dead, he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Move on.</p>
<p>So somebody, I think, asked you whether you&rsquo;re a clone</p>
<p>or a deep fake, and you said that you admitted,</p>
<p>you slipped up on video saying that you&rsquo;re a deep fake.</p>
<p>So on that talk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually a poker playing robot that escaped a lab.</p>
<p>The truth finally comes out,</p>
<p>but I said on that topic,</p>
<p>who do you think is Satoshi Nakamoto?</p>
<p>Is it possible that you are, in fact, Satoshi Nakamoto?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If you have a preponderance of the evidence,</p>
<p>I think the most likely candidate would be Adam Back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Occam&rsquo;s razor candidate.</p>
<p>And mostly because he&rsquo;s the right place, right time,</p>
<p>right age, right skillset.</p>
<p>If you look at the design of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>the types of decisions,</p>
<p>like the use of fourth, the scripting language,</p>
<p>it was pretty common in English and European pedagogy</p>
<p>in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>It was like an example language for a stack based assembly</p>
<p>and like little stuff like that, little quirks like that.</p>
<p>Also, he created Hashcash,</p>
<p>which was the predecessor of proof of work.</p>
<p>He just kind of got a chip on his shoulder</p>
<p>that Microsoft never did anything with it.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s probably looking for something.</p>
<p>He grew up with all the cypherpunks.</p>
<p>He knew of Hal Finney.</p>
<p>He knew of all these people.</p>
<p>He knew Phil Zimmerman.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s Hal Finney?</p>
<p>Well, no, because the code was not good enough.</p>
<p>Hal was a Unix, Linux guy.</p>
<p>He was a talented programmer.</p>
<p>He was a talented developer.</p>
<p>The initial code for Bitcoin was developed</p>
<p>to look like on a Windows machine.</p>
<p>Adam worked at Microsoft, go figure.</p>
<p>And also it was very academic and it had to be cleaned up</p>
<p>and a lot of things had to be patched up and fixed.</p>
<p>If a guy like Hal developed it,</p>
<p>they probably had less of the,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s use secp256k1 and these types of things</p>
<p>and more of like, hey,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s build this cool engineering thing</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll figure out the protocol design later on.</p>
<p>It just stinks of an older academic,</p>
<p>the initial design of Bitcoin</p>
<p>and the initial rollout of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And then brilliant people like Greg Maxwell and others,</p>
<p>they came and cleaned it all up.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, where&rsquo;s Adam?</p>
<p>Like the CEO of the largest Bitcoin development company</p>
<p>in the space who&rsquo;s trying to keep working on</p>
<p>and building out Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And where the hell was Adam when Satoshi was around?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there was any overlap</p>
<p>where they were both together at the same period of time.</p>
<p>But I mean, if you really care, you could even do this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lovely paper written by the US Army.</p>
<p>If you just Google like code stalometry US Army,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a technique where you can use ML</p>
<p>and a few other things to actually kind of develop</p>
<p>a fingerprint for the way that people write code.</p>
<p>So all you gotta do is take the original Bitcoin source code</p>
<p>and then take all the open source repos</p>
<p>from around that time period and before</p>
<p>and see if there&rsquo;s a match between those two.</p>
<p>Now, if he&rsquo;s really good at creating an alias,</p>
<p>probably not so good at obfuscating the code</p>
<p>that was written.</p>
<p>So the odds are that you&rsquo;d probably find a match</p>
<p>to a repo that&rsquo;s connected to a real life human identity</p>
<p>or at least a weaker opsec because you&rsquo;re younger,</p>
<p>you have weaker opsec.</p>
<p>Do you know if people have tried that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody&rsquo;s actually done it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s actually a beautiful paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 94% accurate, the code stalometry.</p>
<p>The code stalometry.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve, for various reasons, I&rsquo;ve worked with people</p>
<p>that work on stalometry of natural language.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I think it matches closest to Nick Sabo</p>
<p>if you actually do the written stalometry analysis</p>
<p>of Satoshi&rsquo;s writings to Sabo&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So I meant stalometry as a field.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t actually look for application</p>
<p>for this particular problem.</p>
<p>But so you&rsquo;re saying Nick Sabo is the closest match.</p>
<p>Yeah, somebody did it years.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t look at if the model was sound or not,</p>
<p>but I just remember reading on a Bitcoin talk</p>
<p>and Sabo was another one of the common candidates.</p>
<p>How many Sabo and Adam are probably the top three things</p>
<p>that people could list.</p>
<p>What do you think about this idea of anonymity,</p>
<p>of publishing something anonymously?</p>
<p>Would you ever consider publishing a paper?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been part of, I mean, the Cardano ecosystem</p>
<p>has published a lot of incredible papers.</p>
<p>Is there ever a value to publish anonymously?</p>
<p>Well, every paper that goes through the referee process,</p>
<p>the authors are ripped off.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t actually see the authorship</p>
<p>when you submit to the conference.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just best practice.</p>
<p>But the question is, do you preserve the anonymity</p>
<p>post conference and actually not reveal</p>
<p>the author of the paper?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a detriment for the deals we make</p>
<p>because the whole premise of working with our company</p>
<p>as an academic is that you&rsquo;re gonna have amazing coauthors</p>
<p>and your work is gonna appear in great conferences,</p>
<p>great journals, and as a consequence, you get tenure.</p>
<p>If you publish anonymously, it&rsquo;s like doing clearance work</p>
<p>in high energy physics or something like that.</p>
<p>After 30 years of this amazing career</p>
<p>working on nuclear weapons and classified reactors,</p>
<p>you finish and then you go to apply for a job</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, so what have you done</p>
<p>for the last 30 years?</p>
<p>Stuff.</p>
<p>Where is it on your CV?</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t really talk about it.</p>
<p>Okay, welcome to community college.</p>
<p>So you get really screwed if you do that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a misalignment of incentives</p>
<p>in the academic world towards anonymity.</p>
<p>And generally it&rsquo;s only done when you&rsquo;re doing something</p>
<p>very controversial or there&rsquo;s a whistleblowing</p>
<p>type of a component.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not typically done for foundational work.</p>
<p>And Satoshi was really one of the first things</p>
<p>because like if there was a, Satoshi docks themselves,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible anymore,</p>
<p>but if he or she did that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a Nobel Prize in economics likely.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on the short list for that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s enormous accolades that would come</p>
<p>beyond the monetary incentives</p>
<p>of being able to docks yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be cool if they give a Nobel Prize in economics</p>
<p>to an anonymous, to Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been proposed and it was turned down.</p>
<p>Yeah, so yeah, I mean, there are a few people</p>
<p>in our company that have done pseudonymous publications.</p>
<p>Like the, if you look at the Chimerical Edgers paper,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s not a real name, it&rsquo;s a crazy name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pseudonymous publication.</p>
<p>And you know, but that&rsquo;s usually for throwaway work.</p>
<p>There is one project we inherited from an anonymous person,</p>
<p>which is fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Cueditas.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically a extension of the Cued manifesto</p>
<p>from the 90s.</p>
<p>And the pseudonym is Bill White.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s some anonymous mathematician,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t figure out which one it is.</p>
<p>But basically it&rsquo;s a marketplace for deduction.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like this magic machine</p>
<p>where you can create incentives for people</p>
<p>to write mathematical proofs in a theorem prover</p>
<p>and make some money from it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some cool work that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad that Bill stayed anonymous</p>
<p>because I think that could have been easily published.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of really cool things</p>
<p>that could have been done with Cueditas.</p>
<p>So you did say the success of Cardano,</p>
<p>sort of the vision you have is for you to have less</p>
<p>and less power over time.</p>
<p>So this idea of governance, what&rsquo;s your vision</p>
<p>for a decentralized secure governance system?</p>
<p>So the first thing you have to do is you&rsquo;ve got to look</p>
<p>at meaningful metrics, not vanity metrics.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to have legitimacy</p>
<p>in a governance system?</p>
<p>You can build any governance system you want.</p>
<p>You can have a dictator, right?</p>
<p>Like Bob is in charge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like whether you like Bob or not, he&rsquo;s in charge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not very legitimate.</p>
<p>And you can have pure democracy</p>
<p>where every single person votes</p>
<p>and then nothing ever gets done.</p>
<p>County dog catcher is like a six year election</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a spectrum there between absolute power to one</p>
<p>and perfectly egalitarian power</p>
<p>to every single potential participant inside the system.</p>
<p>And then the question is, okay,</p>
<p>well, how do you handle choice architecture in that?</p>
<p>So are you asking your people about every question</p>
<p>or are you asking your people about a subset</p>
<p>of questions related to a particular set of topics,</p>
<p>but then they&rsquo;re not allowed to talk about other topics?</p>
<p>Like for example, are they allowed</p>
<p>to change the tax rate,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t change freedom of speech,</p>
<p>that kind of a thing.</p>
<p>So the first thing you have to do</p>
<p>when you build these types of systems</p>
<p>and they get to a certain scale</p>
<p>is you have to build some mechanism</p>
<p>for people who are interested in governance</p>
<p>to self select and participate.</p>
<p>Just create a collection bucket.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, we had Bitcoin talk</p>
<p>and Bitcoin Reddit and these things.</p>
<p>And eventually the GitHub repos and these things,</p>
<p>there was a place to go if you were interested.</p>
<p>And you need some sort of change management system</p>
<p>where people who want to evolve the system</p>
<p>can write it down in a very careful way.</p>
<p>So in Bitcoin&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>it was Bitcoin Improvement Proposal on Ethereum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Ethereum Improvement Proposal.</p>
<p>And for us, it&rsquo;s the SIP, the Cardano Improvement Proposal.</p>
<p>But just a structured way of discussing</p>
<p>how you wish to change.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a question of,</p>
<p>do you want to do this implicitly or explicitly?</p>
<p>The case of Bitcoin in Ethereum, it&rsquo;s an implicit system.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no on chain voting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no like five people said this</p>
<p>and four people said this, so we do this.</p>
<p>The case of Cardano, we&rsquo;re actually explicitly inviting.</p>
<p>This is one of the biggest differentiators</p>
<p>between Cardano, Polkadot, and these other things</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re really serious about governance</p>
<p>to the extent that we&rsquo;re actually doing foundational</p>
<p>research in eVoting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re building new voting systems,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re exploring preference voting and quadratic voting.</p>
<p>And the long and the short is that we want</p>
<p>more and more people to participate in voting for things.</p>
<p>And you just have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>So our hypothesis is we can bootstrap the system</p>
<p>with the treasury system.</p>
<p>So in Cardano, some of the inflation goes</p>
<p>to the block producers, just like any other cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>but some goes into a decentralized treasury,</p>
<p>which now has over a billion dollars of ADA in it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a lot of money.</p>
<p>And that treasury is not under my control</p>
<p>or the foundation&rsquo;s control,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually controlled by the community as a whole</p>
<p>through a program called Catalyst.</p>
<p>And so all these people can come together</p>
<p>and they can submit spending ballots</p>
<p>and other people who hold ADA can vote to approve that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s nice about it is you have a growth engine</p>
<p>to improve two accesses.</p>
<p>One is absolute participation.</p>
<p>So increase the amount of people</p>
<p>who hold ADA participating.</p>
<p>So the absolute number of people participating.</p>
<p>And the other is meaningful participation.</p>
<p>So the depth of participation.</p>
<p>Did you just show up and vote?</p>
<p>Or did you spend hours debating things on idea scale,</p>
<p>the innovation management platform,</p>
<p>interacting with the funding proposal,</p>
<p>going back and forth.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s dozens of little things like that.</p>
<p>Now, my hypothesis is if you run this</p>
<p>with enough iterations,</p>
<p>eventually you get to a certain critical mass,</p>
<p>like over 50% absolute participation</p>
<p>and a high level of meaningful participation,</p>
<p>where you can move beyond funding</p>
<p>and you can start actually having meaningful questions</p>
<p>about protocol design and improvement proposals</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>And then what you can do is you can roll out</p>
<p>new voting systems and new social structures,</p>
<p>and you can let them start voting on training wheels</p>
<p>like system parameters.</p>
<p>Like for example, the minimum transaction fee</p>
<p>or that K parameter for the amount of stake pools</p>
<p>or these types of things.</p>
<p>Then they build enough competency there</p>
<p>and they move up a next level.</p>
<p>And they actually start talking about hard forks</p>
<p>using the update system, the hard fork combinator system.</p>
<p>See, so that&rsquo;s how you.</p>
<p>Voting on a hard fork.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do it unless your social dynamics are right</p>
<p>and your voting system is right.</p>
<p>And by the way, you also need to write a constitution</p>
<p>around the same time</p>
<p>because not all hard forks are created equally.</p>
<p>The kinds of things that would add support</p>
<p>for a new cryptographic primitive</p>
<p>are distinctly different from the kinds of things</p>
<p>that would change your monetary policy of the system.</p>
<p>So the constitution would be written,</p>
<p>and maybe you can comment on</p>
<p>what is the innovation management proposal system?</p>
<p>So we partnered with a company called Ideascale</p>
<p>and they run a kind of a side platform.</p>
<p>So people who are interested,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of our version of a forum.</p>
<p>They sign up and there&rsquo;s special tools in that platform</p>
<p>for discussions that are productive.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t descend into kind of like</p>
<p>trolly Reddit style conversations,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re much more focused around</p>
<p>how is your product building out.</p>
<p>And by the way, we&rsquo;re gonna add more infrastructure</p>
<p>over time.</p>
<p>Our chief of staff, Tamara Hasson,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s working on setting up an incubator and accelerator.</p>
<p>And we have lots of cool partners</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked with in that space.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same concept.</p>
<p>Your idea comes in,</p>
<p>what enters the system should not be</p>
<p>what gets approved on the other side.</p>
<p>It should go through some sort of gauntlet,</p>
<p>some sort of crucible where you iterate your way through</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all kinds of optimizations and upgrades</p>
<p>and evolutions and combinations</p>
<p>and destructions that occur.</p>
<p>And then by the time you get to the other side,</p>
<p>either the idea just dies on the vine</p>
<p>because it was a bad idea,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a significantly stronger, far more fundable thing</p>
<p>and potentially even gets attached with accountability.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t just fund the idea,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d actually fund the auditor at the same time</p>
<p>who actually holds the person accountable</p>
<p>because the blockchain is not a real company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ethereal thing.</p>
<p>You need a counterparty to hold someone accountable</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s real for that type of stuff and that type of funding.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing this year.</p>
<p>So we have a whole team of people,</p>
<p>partners like Governance Live and IdeaScale</p>
<p>and papers we&rsquo;ve written and about 30, 40,000 people</p>
<p>regularly participating in this.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a huge social experiment</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re learning an enormous amount.</p>
<p>And then our goal is by the end of the year</p>
<p>to have a meaningful percentage</p>
<p>of the entire Cardinal population inside of it,</p>
<p>like 40, 50%.</p>
<p>Then once you&rsquo;re at that threshold,</p>
<p>now you have democratic majority of the entire system</p>
<p>and you can have a real conversation about,</p>
<p>okay, how do we write a constitution</p>
<p>for this type of a system?</p>
<p>And sorry to interrupt, but so the constitution,</p>
<p>people still argue about it because natural language,</p>
<p>much like poetry, lends itself to multiple interpretations.</p>
<p>Is it possible to formalize some of these ideas</p>
<p>that reduce the ambiguity?</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s old is new again.</p>
<p>We were talking about Lojban back in the day, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s definitely formal languages you can use</p>
<p>to express these things.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m so interested in things like Idris and Koch</p>
<p>and Acta and theorem proving,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re attempting to do</p>
<p>is to express some concept or desire or construction</p>
<p>in a language that&rsquo;s machine understandable</p>
<p>and manipulatable.</p>
<p>In particular, how does the system know its own design?</p>
<p>So what is the reference of a cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>Usually it&rsquo;s a canonical code base,</p>
<p>like here&rsquo;s Bitcoin core and the C++ code</p>
<p>is that is the canonical code base.</p>
<p>But actually that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>You should have specifications, blueprints</p>
<p>that are implementation agnostic</p>
<p>as your canonical code base.</p>
<p>And can your system know those specifications,</p>
<p>understand those specifications,</p>
<p>and can your change management system be for that?</p>
<p>And then can you provide a proof</p>
<p>that your client is by similar to that specification?</p>
<p>So yeah, that&rsquo;s 10 years in the future,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where you would go with that kind of a concept.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re tending towards a formalism.</p>
<p>Eventually, but that&rsquo;s not necessary</p>
<p>for the system in the short term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good enough just to have,</p>
<p>I know in a winter and say the Haskell client is that,</p>
<p>and then what you basically do is you vote on a SIP</p>
<p>and then once it&rsquo;s approved,</p>
<p>then you go and implement that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some mechanism to trigger the update system,</p>
<p>to update the reference client.</p>
<p>Do you have an example of a SIP,</p>
<p>a Cardano Improvement Proposal?</p>
<p>Yeah, like the Curb Benefit Pledge, SIP 007.</p>
<p>So the&hellip;</p>
<p>007.</p>
<p>Yeah, everybody loves that.</p>
<p>Yeah, key.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna change my luggage code now, Lex.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>So basically it just has to do with the pledge.</p>
<p>So a pledge is a certain amount of ADA</p>
<p>that a stake pool operator will set aside</p>
<p>and connect to his pool in order to be listed</p>
<p>in the registry.</p>
<p>And actually it&rsquo;s connected to how much income you make</p>
<p>as a pool operator.</p>
<p>So if you set it too high, you have a consolidation,</p>
<p>you have lots of pools.</p>
<p>If you set it too low, what will happen is larger pools</p>
<p>will tend to fragment</p>
<p>and actually run multiple instances of themselves.</p>
<p>And so this is delicate parameter that you have to tweak.</p>
<p>And so we have a formula for it,</p>
<p>our formal specification that&rsquo;s quite involved.</p>
<p>And so one of the community members came and said,</p>
<p>well, I think we can massively simplify this design</p>
<p>and actually get a better result</p>
<p>for smaller stake pool operators.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s SIP 007.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a lot of conversation</p>
<p>and people are thinking about it.</p>
<p>And it was just stunning for me</p>
<p>because to understand how to write a SIP like this,</p>
<p>you actually have to read like a hundred pages</p>
<p>of mathematical prose in the formal specification.</p>
<p>So the guys who wrote it, I was like, fuck yeah.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say an example of a SIP,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one thing, but it could be as big as,</p>
<p>hey, I wanna add like quantum resistance to the system.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s how you do that,</p>
<p>like quantum VRF and I wanna put XMSS</p>
<p>and all this other stuff.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot you can do</p>
<p>and you can do it indirectly or implicitly</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s some social process outside of the system</p>
<p>where you eventually approve a SIP,</p>
<p>or you can do it explicitly where you directly vote</p>
<p>or some representative democracy,</p>
<p>some group of representatives directly votes.</p>
<p>And then once you&rsquo;ve decided it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>The constitution is necessary</p>
<p>because you need to know the decision threshold.</p>
<p>Is it super majority or majority?</p>
<p>And also the voting process.</p>
<p>Like a lot of policy experts believe</p>
<p>that if Brexit was a multi stage vote,</p>
<p>it would have never passed</p>
<p>because people would have done the initial stage</p>
<p>and all the horrors of Brexit</p>
<p>would have been broadcast to society.</p>
<p>And then there would have been some reluctance</p>
<p>and buyer&rsquo;s remorse on it.</p>
<p>And then the second round would have failed</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But because it was just a singular event,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they passed it now,</p>
<p>British are all passive aggressive about it with no sign.</p>
<p>Very well, we shall remove from Europe.</p>
<p>And so your voting system has a lot to do</p>
<p>with the outcome you get.</p>
<p>The other thing is, what type of voting?</p>
<p>Is it just an absolute or is it a preference voting?</p>
<p>So you pick your favorite SIP,</p>
<p>follow your second favorite SIP or something like that.</p>
<p>So Condorcet or Borda are two examples of systems like that.</p>
<p>Are you a fan of those, like the ranked choice vote?</p>
<p>I love them so much, especially for political diversity</p>
<p>because this whole concept of throwing your vote away,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s Alice or Bob, you&rsquo;re always gonna get a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s South Park did it best, right?</p>
<p>The giant.</p>
<p>Turd.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you know the one.</p>
<p>Turd versus I forget what else, Douche versus Turd.</p>
<p>Douche versus Turd, South Park.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s ranked order or preference voting,</p>
<p>you never have that situation</p>
<p>because you always pick your favorite</p>
<p>and you get a lot more diversity on the ballot.</p>
<p>But then you have arrows paradox</p>
<p>and all these other things that come up.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no perfect system.</p>
<p>And really you have to be comfortable with governance</p>
<p>in a game of inches.</p>
<p>And you start by some guiding principles.</p>
<p>And the guiding principles is more is better</p>
<p>and productive interactions are better</p>
<p>than destructive interactions.</p>
<p>And you have to be able to quantify those things.</p>
<p>As long as you have an engine that allows you</p>
<p>to grow in those directions,</p>
<p>then you have a lot more people on for the ride</p>
<p>when you actually start talking about these bigger</p>
<p>and bigger things.</p>
<p>The other challenge was that we had</p>
<p>to decentralize development of the protocol</p>
<p>and the brain of the protocol.</p>
<p>We have fully decentralized the brain of the protocol.</p>
<p>The peer review academic process means</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s now an academic incentive</p>
<p>for graduate students, postdocs, and professors</p>
<p>to spend enormous amounts of time writing papers</p>
<p>in our ecosystem because they want tenure.</p>
<p>And we showed that you can get it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of people who&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>great academic careers from working with us.</p>
<p>So yeah, keep adding to that pile of 105 papers.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t need Charles Hoskinson.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need IOHK funding or anything like that thereon.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already seeing unfunded derivative work</p>
<p>from people who are completely disconnected</p>
<p>from us writing papers about stuff in our ecosystem.</p>
<p>So just continue to develop that, but that&rsquo;s looking good.</p>
<p>Decentralized development, we&rsquo;re working on that as well.</p>
<p>Our goal is sometime in the next few years</p>
<p>to make sure there&rsquo;s at least three independent clients,</p>
<p>so three completely independent dev teams and code bases,</p>
<p>and also to get a separation of the commercial clients</p>
<p>from the reference code and turn the reference code</p>
<p>into like a formal specification, a formal blueprint,</p>
<p>and then have that change management</p>
<p>be completely decentralized.</p>
<p>The core developers are actually voted on,</p>
<p>and the SIP process is used to change that,</p>
<p>and then some way of proving that your client</p>
<p>follows the specification as a use of the protocol.</p>
<p>Is there, beyond the Cardano ecosystem,</p>
<p>these ideas of distributed governance,</p>
<p>do you see ways it could revolutionize politics?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Governments.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, like the Ethiopia deal, for example.</p>
<p>We have five million people that we brought in</p>
<p>with the did system there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna follow them throughout their whole life.</p>
<p>Right now they&rsquo;re high school students,</p>
<p>but when they&rsquo;re in their 20s, 30s,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna wanna use that for eVoting</p>
<p>and for payments and so forth.</p>
<p>Can you describe the Ethiopia project,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we spent four years in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>I went there in 2017 and shook a lot of hands,</p>
<p>kissed a lot of babies, and they said,</p>
<p>oh yeah, we&rsquo;ll have it all done in six months.</p>
<p>Everything is a lot of fun there,</p>
<p>but it takes a little bit longer than you&rsquo;d think</p>
<p>to get anything done, and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I really love Ethiopia, it&rsquo;s a beautiful country.</p>
<p>So we spent four years,</p>
<p>we trained a whole cohort of developers,</p>
<p>and then we started a relationship</p>
<p>with the Ministry of Education,</p>
<p>and they care a lot about proper credentials.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems they have is,</p>
<p>when someone graduates, it&rsquo;s really hard for them</p>
<p>to prove the quality of the credentials that they have,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really hard for them</p>
<p>to prove the knowledge that they have.</p>
<p>So if you wanna be an ICT outsourcer,</p>
<p>how does somebody know that this is a real program,</p>
<p>or how does somebody really know that this is a real doctor,</p>
<p>or whatever the hell you&rsquo;re outsourcing?</p>
<p>So they said, can you come and build</p>
<p>a digital identity system for credentials?</p>
<p>So every student in the country at some point</p>
<p>will get a DID, a decentralized identifier,</p>
<p>and then you can prove all sorts of things about them,</p>
<p>like GPA, or what particular diploma they hold,</p>
<p>or blah, blah, blah, and then the beautiful thing is,</p>
<p>the way we designed it is it&rsquo;s extensible</p>
<p>to include payments, extensible to include proofs</p>
<p>about themselves, like are you over the age of 21,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff, and then eventually it can be used</p>
<p>to link into a cryptocurrency system.</p>
<p>In this case, we built it for Cardano.</p>
<p>So Atala Prism is the framework we&rsquo;re using for it.</p>
<p>Every student will get one, and then those students</p>
<p>will be able to use those credentials</p>
<p>in the Cardano ecosystem, eventually for DeFi,</p>
<p>like lending and so forth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the largest blockchain deal of its kind,</p>
<p>and it probably will grow to 20 million people</p>
<p>over the next 24 months.</p>
<p>The other beautiful thing about Ethiopia</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t know is the prime minister</p>
<p>is a cryptographer, and he&rsquo;s in his like 40s, 50s,</p>
<p>a young guy, and he can actually read the papers</p>
<p>we write, and so he&rsquo;s a really bright guy,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s written this beautiful agenda</p>
<p>called Digital Ethiopia 2025, and one of his things</p>
<p>in the agenda is digital identity.</p>
<p>He wants every person in the country</p>
<p>to have a digital identity by 2025,</p>
<p>and he wants to implement an eVoting system</p>
<p>at some point for that.</p>
<p>So when you ask about governance,</p>
<p>all these governance tools that we&rsquo;re constructing</p>
<p>for Cardano are completely reusable for a nation state.</p>
<p>A company, and by the way, if you create</p>
<p>a Cardano application, will eventually be reusable for you,</p>
<p>because if you have a DeFi protocol,</p>
<p>you need a voting system, why the fuck</p>
<p>do you have to reimplement that?</p>
<p>Native multiasset, anything that works on ADA</p>
<p>works with a native multiasset.</p>
<p>You can use our voting system for your asset.</p>
<p>So you get a government in a box</p>
<p>that you can parameterize any way you want,</p>
<p>and similarly, when a government does something</p>
<p>with Cardano, not only do they get</p>
<p>all this amazing infrastructure, but wait, there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>They actually get this amazing voting system</p>
<p>that they can use for smaller, large scale decisions</p>
<p>that they wanna do.</p>
<p>On the US side, we&rsquo;re thinking about trying</p>
<p>to roll something like this out in the state of Wyoming.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been tons of laws that are passed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very friendly crypto place.</p>
<p>At the very least, it&rsquo;d be fun to see</p>
<p>if we can do the Republican, Democrat primaries</p>
<p>with preference voting and voter registration this way,</p>
<p>and do it completely online with an eVoting system.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll be pursuing in 2022.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s some openness to that?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one good thing about the craziness of Trump</p>
<p>is you made half of America think the election system</p>
<p>is completely, irreparably broken.</p>
<p>So you walk in, it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re gonna go kill Dominion,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, yay, that&rsquo;s great, let&rsquo;s go do that.</p>
<p>Whether you believe that or not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s created a market opportunity,</p>
<p>created a lack of faith and credibility in the system.</p>
<p>To improve the system.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>What do you think about El Salvador</p>
<p>becoming the first country to approve a cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>Bitcoin in this case, as a legal currency?</p>
<p>And where&rsquo;s this trend going?</p>
<p>First of all, this event,</p>
<p>if you mentioned the Bitcoin conference,</p>
<p>the Bitcoin folks believe that this is a monumental event.</p>
<p>Do you think this is a start of something new?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re both right, the critics and the pro people.</p>
<p>So the critics are saying this is a nothing burger,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a publicity event for El Salvador.</p>
<p>And then the people say this is the most monumental event.</p>
<p>They may actually be right, because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>reciprocal agreements.</p>
<p>When a country issues a currency,</p>
<p>other countries honor that, usually,</p>
<p>and it trades on forex exchanges.</p>
<p>So if Bitcoin becomes a recognized currency of a country,</p>
<p>then it may be the case that the United States</p>
<p>and European Union and others can&rsquo;t actually stop them</p>
<p>from trading on forex exchanges</p>
<p>and being treated as a currency</p>
<p>from a regulatory perspective.</p>
<p>So it was like a really clever backdoor</p>
<p>into the League of Nations.</p>
<p>And actually, we had this crazy harebrained idea years ago.</p>
<p>We were down in Mexico at the Satoshi Roundtable,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like, hey, let&rsquo;s go buy a country.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to Tuvalu and get them to do something</p>
<p>with the cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>because they sell everything in Tuvalu,</p>
<p>like the.tv extension and their fishing rights,</p>
<p>and Taiwan pays them money to recognize them and so forth.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, man, maybe we can convince Tuvalu</p>
<p>to do something with crypto.</p>
<p>And that didn&rsquo;t work out so well.</p>
<p>But now El Salvador is actually playing the game,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a real country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got like 5 million people and so forth.</p>
<p>So we know the president&rsquo;s brother,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve had some conversations there.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;ll go in the next few months</p>
<p>and see what&rsquo;s going on there,</p>
<p>and do a state visit and talk to the president.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an interesting development.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of those things that it can&rsquo;t quite be ignored</p>
<p>because the nation state&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you have to manage expectations.</p>
<p>Is the central bank taking a position in Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Are they actually switching over to a cryptocurrency</p>
<p>as their unit of account?</p>
<p>Are they now getting off of BIS</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all using the settlement rails of central banks?</p>
<p>Are they actually block chaining the entire country</p>
<p>and they have some broad, ambitious agenda</p>
<p>to go and do all that?</p>
<p>That remains to be seen.</p>
<p>And so it really is a commitment there.</p>
<p>The other thing is that if you&rsquo;re autocratic,</p>
<p>these systems are not so good for you.</p>
<p>Because the minute you adopt these types of systems,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pushing a lot of power to the edges.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a world of difference between optics</p>
<p>and actual commitment.</p>
<p>And actual commitment is I&rsquo;m prepared</p>
<p>to accept the consequences that the state</p>
<p>is going to lose a lot of power along the way.</p>
<p>And the problem is it&rsquo;s not clear to me</p>
<p>some of these politicians who are pro blockchain,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not making a statement on El Salvador in particular,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying in general, are fully aware of that reality.</p>
<p>A lot of them seem to think that somehow</p>
<p>they can contain their blockchain genie in the bottle</p>
<p>and blockchain their whole country,</p>
<p>but stay president for life.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Once they have that power, they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>So do you think once they realize that this is one</p>
<p>of the failure cases, one of the things</p>
<p>that people are concerned about</p>
<p>is governments banning cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s China case, right?</p>
<p>They started realizing this was a legitimate threat</p>
<p>to capital controls and to the autocratic system</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve constructed there.</p>
<p>And then suddenly China started to build its own</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s Bank of China blockchain,</p>
<p>and Bitcoin is now the redheaded stepchild.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t really care too much</p>
<p>because it was great for corruption.</p>
<p>You could evade capital controls,</p>
<p>and so all the well connected people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re, oh yeah, Bitcoin&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>but then they&rsquo;d have Bitcoin of their own,</p>
<p>and they could use it to send money around.</p>
<p>But now the government has gotten very serious about it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying like, okay, we wanna control</p>
<p>and dominate this whole thing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a threat to our plan for the digital yuan</p>
<p>to become the world standard to displace the dollar.</p>
<p>But so the moment you have El Salvador</p>
<p>and just more and more countries,</p>
<p>say there&rsquo;ll be a country in Europe, for example,</p>
<p>that accepts Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, Cardano,</p>
<p>the idea is it would put a lot of pressure on you.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ll be like this kind of ripple effect</p>
<p>that you, and then the individual governments</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be able to help,</p>
<p>and eventually there&rsquo;ll be a superpower like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Russia or the United States,</p>
<p>and or, I don&rsquo;t know, Canada.</p>
<p>So do you see that sort of an inevitable trend</p>
<p>where cryptocurrency takes over the world</p>
<p>as a store of value and as a method of payments?</p>
<p>Yeah, probably.</p>
<p>I mean, you can do just so much more</p>
<p>with programmable finance.</p>
<p>You know, transactions in general have five properties.</p>
<p>You know, you have the asset that runs on the rail.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we always think about.</p>
<p>And you can transact that, you know,</p>
<p>and then you have the identity,</p>
<p>and you transact that either like one to one,</p>
<p>one to many, many to one, or many to many.</p>
<p>And then you have metadata.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the story of the transactions,</p>
<p>like where did it take place, these types of things.</p>
<p>And then you have the contractual relationship.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the smart contract component.</p>
<p>And then you embed that within regulation.</p>
<p>So transactions always live within jurisdictions.</p>
<p>This is relevant to the conversation</p>
<p>that digital currencies take over</p>
<p>because those things are right now done separately</p>
<p>in a very fragmented and fractured way,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not completely globalized.</p>
<p>And so super expensive to hoist up this entire system</p>
<p>and automate things like compliance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually a huge part of every bank&rsquo;s balance sheet.</p>
<p>So when you look at the concept of a digital currency,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying all five of those things are programmable.</p>
<p>And so they could be like library driven.</p>
<p>You say, oh, I wanna be in compliance</p>
<p>with the Eritrea, okay, pull up the Eritrean library.</p>
<p>Now you are, it&rsquo;s built into the transaction.</p>
<p>Previously, it&rsquo;s like, go hire some lawyers</p>
<p>and go figure out the entire code</p>
<p>and translate some things and rah, rah, rah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So just the orders of magnitude efficiency gains</p>
<p>that you get and the increased liquidity you get</p>
<p>and the fact that you can now represent all assets</p>
<p>with a universal way, that financial stem cell,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an inevitability to the victory of our industry.</p>
<p>The challenge is how do we deal with this</p>
<p>with the squabbling of superpowers?</p>
<p>China wants to be the new world standard,</p>
<p>America wants to preserve that,</p>
<p>and the rest of the world is trying to figure out</p>
<p>how do we create something that&rsquo;s a bit more fair</p>
<p>and balanced?</p>
<p>And so crypto comes in and it potentially is both an ally</p>
<p>and a competitor to those desires.</p>
<p>Because if you do too much crypto,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need a nation state anymore.</p>
<p>If you do too little crypto, well, it&rsquo;s China or America.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that sweet spot?</p>
<p>Do you hope that in the process of cryptocurrency</p>
<p>pushing power to the edges to the people</p>
<p>that we would be able to alleviate</p>
<p>some of the suffering in the world</p>
<p>caused by centralized power and the abuses of power,</p>
<p>corruption, all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>I made a very angry video months ago.</p>
<p>I make angry videos.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t drink, Clex.</p>
<p>Maybe you should drink more.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, right?</p>
<p>It depends on who you ask.</p>
<p>I made a video a little while.</p>
<p>I said, our industry is an industry of frustration.</p>
<p>It exists because we weren&rsquo;t the industry</p>
<p>that charged 85% interest to the poorest people</p>
<p>in the world for loans.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t the industry that charged 15% to move money</p>
<p>for a maid sending money home to mom in Manila.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t the industry that laundered</p>
<p>hundreds of billions of dollars of drug money</p>
<p>and funded arms dealers in Africa and all these things</p>
<p>or permitted oil for food to exist and so forth.</p>
<p>And the people who did these things aren&rsquo;t in jail.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re rich.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re billionaires.</p>
<p>They fly private jets.</p>
<p>So our industry is the antidote to these types of things.</p>
<p>And we say, guys, we want a system that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And we want everybody to be treated equally.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean everybody&rsquo;s gonna win.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that when you lose,</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s gonna come on a white horse and bail you out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have winners and losers, but it&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we want.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ve ever wanted.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no coincidence that Bitcoin was created</p>
<p>right around the same time as the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like these were just unrelated events.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re highly correlated to each other, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say perhaps even causal, go figure.</p>
<p>And everything we&rsquo;ve done as an industry</p>
<p>from that moment to today and beyond</p>
<p>has been about that endless, relentless desire</p>
<p>to make things a little bit less corrupt,</p>
<p>a little bit less nepotistic and a bit more open.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gotten so insane</p>
<p>that they have these things in Wyoming called speedy banks,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re full reserve banks.</p>
<p>They have 100% of their balance sheet is accounted for.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t lend.</p>
<p>And then you have the people in the banking community</p>
<p>saying, well, those are a risk to banking.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re scared that these speedy banks are gonna default.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what world are you living in?</p>
<p>You have fractional reserves,</p>
<p>sometimes like 2% assets on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re worried that the guys</p>
<p>who actually have a dollar for every dollar</p>
<p>they say they have are the ones that are gonna collapse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the 1984 level doublespeak</p>
<p>when you see the system and negative interest rates</p>
<p>and all these other things.</p>
<p>And so I absolutely believe the direction course</p>
<p>of this industry is to make things more honest and fair.</p>
<p>And also by its very existence,</p>
<p>it exposes double standards, hypocrisy and corruption.</p>
<p>Just the fact that it&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one thing to say that, well,</p>
<p>it just can&rsquo;t be because of the nature of global finance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to do it otherwise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another thing to see it there as an example</p>
<p>and say, well, that thing is doing it.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you guys be this way?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so passionate about Africa</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t like the systems they have</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s really young.</p>
<p>And they are gonna throw all the systems out</p>
<p>in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna replace them with something else.</p>
<p>If we get this stuff into Africa,</p>
<p>1.2 billion people will be living</p>
<p>in a considerably better system than the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And then everybody else will look at that and say,</p>
<p>why the hell are those guys so rich?</p>
<p>Why are those guys making the money?</p>
<p>Why are those guys doing so well?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not satisfying to hear,</p>
<p>well, Africa is just better.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s gonna say that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna say, okay, yeah, it&rsquo;s nepotism and corruption</p>
<p>and lack of transparency and these types of things.</p>
<p>So I think absolutely it has the potential</p>
<p>to improve the human condition,</p>
<p>but humans have to get out of the way.</p>
<p>Humans have ingrained in themselves selfishness</p>
<p>and it is a desire to maximize for themselves</p>
<p>and their family and not thinking systems.</p>
<p>And so we have to evolve capitalism at the same time.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is right now you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to maximize the amount of resources you get today.</p>
<p>What we need to do is start thinking about</p>
<p>how do we create future versions of ourselves in 2100</p>
<p>and create a resource for that time period.</p>
<p>And then the name of the game is to maximize that</p>
<p>or balance that with what you get in the short term.</p>
<p>And then suddenly you&rsquo;re saying to yourself,</p>
<p>well, if I&rsquo;m doing things that are good for me today,</p>
<p>but compromising then I make less money.</p>
<p>So capitalism as an engine is okay.</p>
<p>The problem is it&rsquo;s misparameterized.</p>
<p>Right, almost like inject longterm incentives</p>
<p>into the capitalist system.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And cryptocurrency space is the only economic system</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s actually possible.</p>
<p>You can create a tokenomic scheme</p>
<p>where doing things that are beneficial for people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never meet because you&rsquo;re long dead</p>
<p>actually makes you money today.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that in a legacy financial system and so forth.</p>
<p>So I think that that&rsquo;s the real impact capital conversation</p>
<p>that has to be had as you explore these things</p>
<p>is you have to talk to people and say,</p>
<p>look, it&rsquo;s not about communism</p>
<p>or socialism versus capitalism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about, hey, let&rsquo;s donate and save the world</p>
<p>or try to be charity and make things better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about how do you use the fact</p>
<p>that we have a better toolkit to create a different system,</p>
<p>a different incentive model</p>
<p>where the default configuration of the system</p>
<p>is longterm thinking.</p>
<p>And the default consideration of system</p>
<p>is get rid of all these negative externalities</p>
<p>that marketplaces have and judge the success of society,</p>
<p>not by how the greatest of society are doing,</p>
<p>but by how the least of society are doing.</p>
<p>HDI, not GDP, this kind of thinking.</p>
<p>And I think crypto can actually be the vanguard</p>
<p>that kind of pushes us there.</p>
<p>And the first countries to adopt that</p>
<p>are gonna be just significantly better places to live.</p>
<p>And the people who envy them</p>
<p>will force the other countries to change.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be a ripple effect.</p>
<p>So when you wake up in the morning</p>
<p>or as you sleep like a baby,</p>
<p>wake up multiple times in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>do you feel the burden of this kind of future</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in your hands and not to mess it up?</p>
<p>Like, what is it, Big Lebowski?</p>
<p>Her life is in your hands, dude.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re nihilists, Tony.</p>
<p>Do you feel the burden of like,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about all these 100 plus papers</p>
<p>and the academic beauty of the algorithms</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s millions of human lives at stake here.</p>
<p>I mean, you always feel the burden,</p>
<p>especially in my own company.</p>
<p>I mean, I have all these people work for me</p>
<p>and they eat because I pay them, right?</p>
<p>So if I can&rsquo;t pay them, then that&rsquo;s my fault.</p>
<p>So you have to, as a leader,</p>
<p>you always have to be cognizant</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s all these people</p>
<p>who have signed up for your crazy vision</p>
<p>and you have to be larger than life.</p>
<p>You always have to be good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to have a bad day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to feel like shit.</p>
<p>You always have to show up.</p>
<p>You always have to be pushing for it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a huge burden in many respects</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s Charles the person</p>
<p>and then Charles the CEO,</p>
<p>and these are very different things</p>
<p>in terms of expectations, at the very least.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s heavy in that respect.</p>
<p>That said, what gives you solace</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re not in it alone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lonely, but you&rsquo;re not alone.</p>
<p>You have so many amazing people around you</p>
<p>that are willing to help</p>
<p>and actually take some of that burden.</p>
<p>My life has gotten considerably better</p>
<p>when I learned how to delegate and trust.</p>
<p>And even if people screw up and fail,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth the risk</p>
<p>because ultimately you&rsquo;re amplifying yourself.</p>
<p>The other thing is that it&rsquo;s okay not to get all the way.</p>
<p>You want to, you wanna push there,</p>
<p>but make sure whatever the hell you do,</p>
<p>you leave something for somebody else</p>
<p>to pick up and carry on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we care so much about the publication process</p>
<p>and open source.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll never file a patent in our entire history</p>
<p>because whatever we do, it&rsquo;s yours as much as it is mine.</p>
<p>And maybe I can only get you 70% of the way</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll plop over dead from a heart attack</p>
<p>or get killed by an eagle or something like that.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody brings the.</p>
<p>Eagle.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody brings the hast eagle back and it kills me.</p>
<p>So it could happen.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re bringing the woolly mammoth back.</p>
<p>Talk to George Church about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good way to go.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Even the eagle or the mammoth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather be crushed by a mammoth</p>
<p>because eagles actually fly you up and drop you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Oh, so you won&rsquo;t die via slow death</p>
<p>and they probably peck at you.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You just be grievously wounded on the ground</p>
<p>and the eagle is like slowly devouring you.</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t go down that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost my train of thought.</p>
<p>The point is you feel deeply great</p>
<p>with a bunch of people around you and then you give.</p>
<p>Yeah, you delegate, you delegate.</p>
<p>And somebody fights the eagle</p>
<p>and then other people takes care of that</p>
<p>and this, that and the other.</p>
<p>You just do the best you can.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the arena.</p>
<p>You fight as hard as you can.</p>
<p>You leave nothing for home.</p>
<p>You could put it all on the field</p>
<p>and then when you go home,</p>
<p>you have pride in what you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>and you know that you&rsquo;ve at least made a slight difference.</p>
<p>You know, one person can make a huge difference.</p>
<p>Look at Norman Borlaug.</p>
<p>I mean, he just went around the whole world</p>
<p>teaching people how to grow crops.</p>
<p>He saved a billion lives over the course of his life.</p>
<p>Billion people didn&rsquo;t starve to death because of one guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing the asymmetry</p>
<p>and the returns on that type of a thing</p>
<p>just for the knowledge transfer of all things</p>
<p>and yet not a household name.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the other side of it, of the burdens.</p>
<p>People always want something or something.</p>
<p>So they say, oh, if I endured all these burdens,</p>
<p>I should be given something.</p>
<p>I entered into this space fully expecting</p>
<p>that probably the most likely outcome was jail.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what my dad told me and other people told me.</p>
<p>And it was because it&rsquo;s like, look at where we came from.</p>
<p>The Liberty Dollar, eGold, all these things.</p>
<p>Anybody tries to innovate the monetary system,</p>
<p>either end up like Gaddafi or they end up in prison</p>
<p>or they end up like nepotistic corrupt banker</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And so the financial regulations</p>
<p>are not built for rapid innovation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not built for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason Satoshi was anonymous.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t because he enjoyed the anonymity.</p>
<p>There was legitimate criminal risk</p>
<p>for this type of activity.</p>
<p>So the fact that I&rsquo;ve gotten this far</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing pretty good, that&rsquo;s a win.</p>
<p>You take that, life is good.</p>
<p>What does a productive day in the life</p>
<p>of Charles Hoskinson look like?</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re getting to the details here.</p>
<p>Diet, like fasting or not maybe,</p>
<p>coffee, non coffee, exercise, sleep,</p>
<p>scheduling like periods of deep work, programming,</p>
<p>then the social media stuff that you do.</p>
<p>You clearly enjoy being on social media</p>
<p>and also live streaming, educating, inspiring the world</p>
<p>or getting drunk and ranting at the computer.</p>
<p>Well, first off you do a wet year and a dry year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what prevents you from becoming an alcoholic.</p>
<p>So unfortunately the way that schedule worked,</p>
<p>2020 was my dry year.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t drink the entire year.</p>
<p>Not a single sip of alcohol.</p>
<p>It was the worst.</p>
<p>On purpose.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do a dry year and then you do a wet year.</p>
<p>Oh, so this is one of your ideas about life</p>
<p>is you alternate.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to alternate.</p>
<p>Never do too much of any one thing.</p>
<p>Well, Churchill never alternated.</p>
<p>He just kept drinking throughout his life.</p>
<p>He did pretty good.</p>
<p>Just to push back against the year.</p>
<p>Yeah, he had an Alfred North Whitehead.</p>
<p>Although didn&rsquo;t Churchill get kicked out</p>
<p>as prime minister at some point?</p>
<p>So maybe he took one dry year.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was a sober, happy, in shape Churchill.</p>
<p>He would have led a Britain for 30 fucking years.</p>
<p>But you know, see Lex, that&rsquo;s why we can&rsquo;t have nice things.</p>
<p>Conor S. Thompson, maybe you&rsquo;re onto something.</p>
<p>Oh, you know, it&rsquo;s really crazy if you go to Aspen</p>
<p>and see the bar he used to go to.</p>
<p>I actually met a waitress who knew him really well</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d go in there like two, three times a day</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like, yeah, he&rsquo;d do cocaine</p>
<p>right here on the table and he&rsquo;d come in with lots of pills</p>
<p>and just put them all out on the table</p>
<p>and be taking them at different hours</p>
<p>and they were all clearly illegal substances</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;d just give him coffee or whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a great guy.</p>
<p>But anyway, that&rsquo;s the day in the life of Charles.</p>
<p>I fast, I tried to do intermittent fasting, 16, eight.</p>
<p>The longest fast I ever did for a long term fast</p>
<p>was two weeks, which was just crazy.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Oh my God, I was.</p>
<p>Can you take me through the journey of like philosophically</p>
<p>what was going on in your mind?</p>
<p>Well, so normally when I do an extended fast</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about three, four days</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the sweet spot before you start losing</p>
<p>muscle mass and other things start happening</p>
<p>and people know so much more about this than I do</p>
<p>but I just feel pretty good</p>
<p>and you kind of get addicted to the fast high.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to eat, you have no downtime,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going, your energy never dips</p>
<p>and so I used to do like three, five days,</p>
<p>maybe three, four was the sweet spot</p>
<p>but then after about a week I was like,</p>
<p>how long do I, can I make this go?</p>
<p>And so I started talking to some people,</p>
<p>I said, well, Angus Barbary did 384 days,</p>
<p>of course I&rsquo;m not as fat as Angus</p>
<p>so I said, oh, I can do two weeks.</p>
<p>So I just kept going and kept going and kept going</p>
<p>and kept going and right around the two week mark</p>
<p>I fainted for a little bit in a chair</p>
<p>and I was like, okay, maybe I should start eating again</p>
<p>but then I was legitimately worried</p>
<p>about like refeeding syndrome and this stuff,</p>
<p>like, okay, how do I take care of that?</p>
<p>So my brother&rsquo;s a doctor and I called him</p>
<p>and I said, hey, Willie, I haven&rsquo;t eaten in two weeks,</p>
<p>how do I start eating again?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, what?</p>
<p>Slowly.</p>
<p>Slowly, yeah, so the usual routine intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>although I haven&rsquo;t been as good about it as I should be</p>
<p>and I used to work out, I don&rsquo;t do as much as that,</p>
<p>the stress and the work life balance has been horrible</p>
<p>the last 24 months and I&rsquo;ve gained a lot of weight</p>
<p>and all that stuff but I&rsquo;ll fix that</p>
<p>but I do try a lot of things,</p>
<p>like I used to call map and I do meditation,</p>
<p>recently I started doing photobiomodulation,</p>
<p>you ever heard of that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a crazy headset called a Vlite,</p>
<p>you saw that picture of me with like the weird thing</p>
<p>with the red lights on,</p>
<p>it actually shoots lights into your brain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really cool stuff but it improves blood flow</p>
<p>and actually there&rsquo;s some peer reviewed studies</p>
<p>that show that it does neurogenesis</p>
<p>so you actually generate new neurons and things like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really cool stuff so I do that</p>
<p>and it actually helps a lot</p>
<p>and every day&rsquo;s a little different.</p>
<p>Do you get a few hours of like alone time to work, to think?</p>
<p>Yeah, deep work is so important,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s even a book on that, like Deep Work.</p>
<p>Yeah, by Cal Newport.</p>
<p>I think you interviewed him, didn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Yeah, everyone should listen to this podcast,</p>
<p>Deep Questions, he&rsquo;s awesome,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a mathematician, theoretical computer scientist</p>
<p>so those guys really need their time</p>
<p>and want to really think.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one thing I deeply miss,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a CEO, you&rsquo;re the master of the five minute deal,</p>
<p>you come in, you talk to people,</p>
<p>you make a decision, you move on to the next thing,</p>
<p>you move on to the next thing</p>
<p>and I used to be used to like really deep focus,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d sit down and think about something</p>
<p>for 10 hours, 15 hours, 20 hours and that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>and I enjoyed it, it was just so beautiful</p>
<p>to get lost into something and just go and go and go</p>
<p>and then you become a CEO and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you never can go and go,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re lucky if you read a four page thing</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something else that comes up,</p>
<p>you have to travel, you have to do that</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve been trying lately to have</p>
<p>and actually our chief of staff recommended</p>
<p>like Fridays is do not disturb day</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s for deep work, you don&rsquo;t have meetings,</p>
<p>none of these things</p>
<p>and so far I have not committed to that</p>
<p>but everybody else in the organization</p>
<p>has started to move there</p>
<p>but my hope is next month</p>
<p>that I can actually get serious about that.</p>
<p>The other time I&rsquo;m lost in thought</p>
<p>is I do a lot of float tanks,</p>
<p>have you ever done isolation tanks?</p>
<p>But I really want to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most amazing things you can do,</p>
<p>you come out on the other side</p>
<p>and all your stress worries, they&rsquo;re just gone</p>
<p>and you have so much productivity and clarity,</p>
<p>if you combine that with daily naps, that&rsquo;s the way to go.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of naps</p>
<p>so what about the social media stuff</p>
<p>and like you doing the live streams,</p>
<p>do you ever dread those?</p>
<p>Are you energized by those?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re exceptionally good</p>
<p>at communicating all the different kinds of ideas</p>
<p>and being very transparent with the community,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the live streams,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun, it&rsquo;s never been a chore</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s for them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a chance for people in the community</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been loyal and they really love it</p>
<p>to actually just be there, ask some questions</p>
<p>and I try to make it as entertaining as possible</p>
<p>and you have your trolls and you have your love</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually nice to have a mixture of the two</p>
<p>because sometimes you can beat down trolls just for fun,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff and it&rsquo;s grown to a cult following,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s like 40, 50,000 people</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost like Fight Club in a certain respect.</p>
<p>So I was in Vancouver years ago</p>
<p>and I was in Air Canada checking in,</p>
<p>just about to fly back to Colorado</p>
<p>and I was getting this weird vibe</p>
<p>from the guy that was checking me in</p>
<p>and then right after he takes my bag,</p>
<p>he kind of leans over to me, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I love Ada and I was like, really?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, I watch your live streams</p>
<p>and then I was flying into London,</p>
<p>I was in London Heathrow Airport</p>
<p>and the passport control guy was there</p>
<p>and I was just about to take my passport out</p>
<p>and he says, welcome to London, Mr. Hoskinson.</p>
<p>I was like, oh God, am I going to jail in London?</p>
<p>Why does the border patrol guy know who I am?</p>
<p>This is a bad deal for me</p>
<p>and it turned out he watched my live streams</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s a lot of that and that&rsquo;s so much fun.</p>
<p>In fact, here in Austin, I was at a Mexican restaurant</p>
<p>just down in the closest place</p>
<p>and while eating there, two different people recognized me</p>
<p>and I took a picture with one of them</p>
<p>and again, they watched the live streams.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Well, if it&rsquo;s anything like Fight Club,</p>
<p>you have to wonder if some of those people</p>
<p>or all of them are just figments of your imagination.</p>
<p>Right, I would.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an answer for that.</p>
<p>I could be a figment of your imagination</p>
<p>which just proves that yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, but honestly,</p>
<p>if I was capable of that level of delusion,</p>
<p>why the hell don&rsquo;t I look like Brad Pitt?</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>Okay, so on this topic, let me ask you about mushrooms.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re interested in mushrooms, growing mushrooms.</p>
<p>I believe you are also interested</p>
<p>in the mind expanding capabilities of psychedelics.</p>
<p>At least you mentioned kind of the interesting place</p>
<p>where your interest in non psychedelic mushrooms might go.</p>
<p>Can you explain the nature of your interest in mushrooms?</p>
<p>Is it personal, is it business, is it both?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just an underexplored area</p>
<p>of science and botany that ought to be explored</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much cool, interesting stuff there.</p>
<p>Mushrooms do so much.</p>
<p>Like they have these things called cordyceps</p>
<p>and they are like a zombie fungus that infects insects,</p>
<p>takes them over and then it will have them</p>
<p>kind of get to other insects</p>
<p>and then burst out of their head like an alien</p>
<p>and spray spores on them and repeat the process.</p>
<p>I mean, they even made a damn game about this.</p>
<p>The Last of Us or something like that.</p>
<p>And this is a real thing.</p>
<p>Like you can Google it and see like these dead ants</p>
<p>with these fungal stabs coming out of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, holy God, this is crazy.</p>
<p>And in the same topic, you go all the way to Lion&rsquo;s Mane</p>
<p>and it could actually help treat Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and treat depression and Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and regrow nerves and so forth.</p>
<p>Other things, they&rsquo;ve shown some effectiveness</p>
<p>against COVID, you know, it&rsquo;s just so crazy</p>
<p>the diversity in the mushroom kingdom</p>
<p>of the medicinal applications, the pesticide applications.</p>
<p>You can use it a lot to kind of save hay and trees.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do</p>
<p>to combat all kinds of invasive species.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true, there&rsquo;s a lot of cool stuff</p>
<p>with psychedelic mushrooms and there&rsquo;s a great book</p>
<p>from Michael Pollan, How to Change Your Mind,</p>
<p>where he was really the first journalist</p>
<p>a long time to go and Roland Griffiths</p>
<p>work his way through the Johns Hopkins studies.</p>
<p>But the long and short for me when I read that book,</p>
<p>like, okay, mind expansion is great,</p>
<p>but look at the effectiveness of psychedelics,</p>
<p>psilocybin mushrooms with SSRIs,</p>
<p>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</p>
<p>for the treatment of depression.</p>
<p>They showed in the Johns Hopkins studies</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re equal or better in effectiveness</p>
<p>in many cases for the treatment of depression</p>
<p>than a drug that you have to take forever.</p>
<p>And this is just one or two treatments</p>
<p>and then you desist from it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a miracle because there&rsquo;s so many people</p>
<p>suffer from severe depression and it&rsquo;s a lifetime ailment.</p>
<p>And the fact that we have something in the toolbox</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve underexplored is a very powerful thing.</p>
<p>The other thing was end of life issues.</p>
<p>A lot of people get cancer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost people in the family from cancer.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so hard those last two, three months</p>
<p>because they kind of have this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in a horrific pain, they&rsquo;re trying to find meaning</p>
<p>and why is this happening to me?</p>
<p>And if you can just give them a substance</p>
<p>that on the other side of it, there&rsquo;s a good chance</p>
<p>they can come to peace with everything</p>
<p>and die with a lot more dignity and happiness.</p>
<p>That alone justifies an enormous amount of study</p>
<p>and the fact that these things are super cheap</p>
<p>and they grow pretty much anywhere, it&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>Now on the commercial side,</p>
<p>you can make a lot of money from mushrooms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working with a company called Farmbox Foods</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one of the,</p>
<p>they do both vertical hydropartic farming,</p>
<p>they also do mushroom and they put these amazing labs</p>
<p>and shipping containers</p>
<p>that are kind of like controlled environments.</p>
<p>You grow 400 pounds of gourmet mushrooms</p>
<p>a single week off of that.</p>
<p>And your margins can be up to 30% per year.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just selling them for food consumption,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing supplements,</p>
<p>they can be even higher than that.</p>
<p>So it just kind of made sense</p>
<p>from a diversification of assets to say,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s do some stuff in hydroponics</p>
<p>and aquaponics and mushrooms.</p>
<p>But the more I do and the more I learn that community,</p>
<p>just the cooler that community is.</p>
<p>Like I went to this beautiful mushroom festival</p>
<p>in Cape Springs down in Georgia.</p>
<p>And I met this guy named Bill Yule</p>
<p>and he just looks like a druid.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just like he lives in a tree</p>
<p>and he opens up the tree and goes out and everything.</p>
<p>And I was like, Bill, what do you do?</p>
<p>He said, I go and I try to study beetles and boletes</p>
<p>and a very particular type of beetle.</p>
<p>And they mate in the most crazy way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this beetle will fuse on top of another beetle</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll vibrate.</p>
<p>And if they make the right harmony,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll mate with them, otherwise they&rsquo;ll kick her off.</p>
<p>And you can only make the harmony</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on a specific type of bolete mushroom.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s anywhere else, the harmony doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, who the fuck does this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 20 years, 30 years just thinking</p>
<p>about goddamn beetles and bolete mushrooms,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s that community.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re the happiest people you&rsquo;ll ever meet.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just so much fun to talk to.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just so much lore there that&rsquo;s not discovered.</p>
<p>The other thing is there&rsquo;s a ton of undiscovered mushrooms.</p>
<p>So, you go to my ranch up in Wyoming,</p>
<p>go out that national forest next to it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably discover six or seven new species</p>
<p>just doing some gene sequencing and things like that.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s like a gold rush for new things to discover,</p>
<p>to treat all kinds of things.</p>
<p>So, I love mushrooms, love that community.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of wonderful medicinal properties</p>
<p>and everybody there is just a lot of fun to hang out with.</p>
<p>The other passion is aquaponics and hydroponics.</p>
<p>And I got a lot more serious after COVID.</p>
<p>I go to the supermarket, all the store shelves are barren.</p>
<p>I say, guys, can you imagine if we had a real big thing,</p>
<p>what this would be like?</p>
<p>We need to have domestic food production.</p>
<p>We need to have resilience at the community level.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s go build a $40, $50 million aquaponics facility</p>
<p>next to every major city.</p>
<p>So, at least you have some local production of food</p>
<p>and people won&rsquo;t starve to death.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s very bad.</p>
<p>And again, the margins are phenomenal there, 20%, 30%,</p>
<p>if you actually do it right</p>
<p>and alternate your crops properly and so forth.</p>
<p>And you create a lot of high paying jobs with it as well.</p>
<p>And so, you kind of draw a lot of value</p>
<p>from staying close to nature in all of these kinds of ways</p>
<p>that are keeping you humble.</p>
<p>Like you said, what is it?</p>
<p>The goat is still gonna crap on you.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, the donkeys will shit on you</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re broke or a billionaire.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the line you&rsquo;ll be remembered for</p>
<p>if the universe has a sense of humor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a neo Yogi Berra.</p>
<p>So, I think mushrooms is a good place to ask</p>
<p>about my friend, Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>So, I keep folks from the Cardano community</p>
<p>kept saying, keep saying things like,</p>
<p>Lex podcasts first, then Joe Rogan experience.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m the moon and Joe is Mars in this metaphor.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m a CS person, I can talk a little bit</p>
<p>more fluently about cryptocurrency</p>
<p>because fundamentally cryptocurrency</p>
<p>is a computational idea.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s somebody like Joe</p>
<p>who is more like an everyman.</p>
<p>He does not necessarily know the technical intricacies</p>
<p>of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s had a cryptocurrency person on.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t he interview Andreas on Todopolis?</p>
<p>Oh, he did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>But that was almost like the cryptocurrency space</p>
<p>goes through phases.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re in a new era of some kind.</p>
<p>And how do you talk to Joe about Cardano?</p>
<p>How do you talk to Joe about what the heck?</p>
<p>I remember somebody tried to explain to him</p>
<p>what Dogecoin is.</p>
<p>How do you explain this whole space?</p>
<p>Of where Bitcoin is, of where Ethereum is,</p>
<p>of where Cardano and smart contracts</p>
<p>and some of this proof of work,</p>
<p>with this proof of stake ideas</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What you do is you start with applications</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s an elk hunter.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s probably interested in elk tags, right?</p>
<p>So you start there and you say,</p>
<p>that whole system can be put on a blockchain</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s gonna be better for you.</p>
<p>You say, that&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>You always connect it to something they know and love.</p>
<p>And then once they get that, they say,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>And then they ask, what else can you do with it?</p>
<p>What else can you sell me on it?</p>
<p>And you kind of work your way outwards there.</p>
<p>Problem technologists make is they&rsquo;re so damn in love</p>
<p>with the technology.</p>
<p>They have that tail wagging the dog</p>
<p>where they just wanna talk about the technology</p>
<p>and how incredibly cool it is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like talking about math.</p>
<p>Oh God, let&rsquo;s talk about cool boardisms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>All right, yeah.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s eyes glows over.</p>
<p>No, you always have to connect it</p>
<p>to the interest of the particular person</p>
<p>and what they care about, what they love, what they need.</p>
<p>Royalty payments.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a big guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got the Spotify thing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got all these things going on.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is probably pretty important, Joe,</p>
<p>at some juncture.</p>
<p>So NFTs.</p>
<p>We could talk about this concept of perpetual royalties.</p>
<p>So for example, let&rsquo;s say that you create a piece of art.</p>
<p>You can build into the token itself</p>
<p>a perpetual royalty to something you care about.</p>
<p>Maybe every time it sells, it pays it back to you.</p>
<p>Or maybe every time it sells,</p>
<p>it donate to some clean water charity</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>The point is that the actual acquisition</p>
<p>of the NFT requires adherence to that smart contract.</p>
<p>So people can&rsquo;t deviate from your desire even after you die.</p>
<p>So stuff from Andy Warhol or from Picasso,</p>
<p>that can still be generating some donation</p>
<p>every time a Picasso sells to something else.</p>
<p>You can do that with NFTs.</p>
<p>And so he starts thinking, God, what else can I do?</p>
<p>I do shows.</p>
<p>Maybe I can do my tickets with these types of things.</p>
<p>Maybe I can do loyalty points for my fans.</p>
<p>So now you got him engaged,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s thinking of all the opportunities for him,</p>
<p>and it gives him an incentive to anchor</p>
<p>and connect to those concepts.</p>
<p>And then over time, he starts asking the question,</p>
<p>well, how do we know it&rsquo;s secure?</p>
<p>Then we can talk about proof of work or proof of stake</p>
<p>or these types of things.</p>
<p>Well, so this is how it stays secure</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really interested.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an incentive to have the attention span</p>
<p>necessary to do the homework,</p>
<p>eat the broccoli and get over that hill.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also an opportunity, at least it was for me,</p>
<p>especially with Bitcoin a while ago,</p>
<p>is to take another look at the monetary system.</p>
<p>Even look at the, I&rsquo;ve been looking quite a bit</p>
<p>at the history of the 20th century</p>
<p>and sort of look at that history</p>
<p>through the perspective of the monetary system,</p>
<p>the gold standard and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And you just add that little layer of consideration</p>
<p>of how much money,</p>
<p>of how money can be used by people in power</p>
<p>to control the populace.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating to look at the history</p>
<p>from that perspective,</p>
<p>and then that allows you to look at the future</p>
<p>of how we can change that in order to empower people.</p>
<p>And then of course, the governance thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re working on is fascinating</p>
<p>because I mean, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but it seems like deeply broken aspect of our government</p>
<p>is just the voting system.</p>
<p>And discussing how that could be revolutionized</p>
<p>is fascinating.</p>
<p>Because a lot of conversations end up being on the internet</p>
<p>about like number go up, which is like financial side.</p>
<p>And to me personally at least, I think that&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>for Joe is that&rsquo;s just boring.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the investing, the financial side of it,</p>
<p>I know it has a lot of impact, but it&rsquo;s kind of boring.</p>
<p>Cause longterm is not gonna have any impact.</p>
<p>If the idea is a strong longterm, it&rsquo;s going to win.</p>
<p>The idea is a weak, longterm is gonna lose.</p>
<p>The ups and downs of the short term don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like casino games that you play.</p>
<p>Speaking of games, video games,</p>
<p>gotta ask you about those.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You mentioned Diablo, maybe you&rsquo;re a fan of Diablo.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, and Diablo 2 was great.</p>
<p>Do you like Skyrim?</p>
<p>Skyrim was great too.</p>
<p>Like the Elder Scrolls.</p>
<p>I actually bought the game that the Elder Scrolls</p>
<p>was based on, do you know that?</p>
<p>So way back in the day, the Elder Scrolls series</p>
<p>was inspired by a game called Legends of Valor</p>
<p>that I played when I was a little kid.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t actually have an ending.</p>
<p>They ran out of money before they finished it.</p>
<p>So they just kind of like put this little thing on</p>
<p>and said, okay, but you never finish it.</p>
<p>So I actually bought all the intellectual property</p>
<p>of the game.</p>
<p>I saw that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know there was a connection</p>
<p>between Legends of Valor and Arena.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I forget the name.</p>
<p>The guy, was it Todd something at Bethesda?</p>
<p>He played it and he was inspired by it</p>
<p>and then he created Arena right after playing it.</p>
<p>That was such a good game.</p>
<p>Arena, Daggerfall.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I had a copy of Daggerfall when I was a kid,</p>
<p>but it had a bug and so when you left the dungeon,</p>
<p>it would crash.</p>
<p>And this was before, like you can get an easy patch for it.</p>
<p>So I never actually played Daggerfall.</p>
<p>I entered in through Morrowind.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, the Daggerfall was the fascinating thing.</p>
<p>We were just jumping all over,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll return to Legends of Valor</p>
<p>because I want to ask you about that.</p>
<p>But Daggerfall was fascinating</p>
<p>because I think of all the other scroll games,</p>
<p>it was like the largest</p>
<p>because it was like randomly generated.</p>
<p>It would like randomly generate the worlds,</p>
<p>the dungeons and so on,</p>
<p>which is fascinating to think about like,</p>
<p>how big can you make the world both in actuality and feel?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s incredible to have a video game,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many video games do this well,</p>
<p>where the feeling is you can be lost here forever.</p>
<p>You can live here because most video games</p>
<p>have like a bottom.</p>
<p>It feels like you can run out of stuff.</p>
<p>When Daggerfall was like, I can just keep doing this.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s what I felt at the time.</p>
<p>But yeah, what the heck Legends of Valor?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the idea there?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there&rsquo;s really nothing about it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super compelling today.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a nostalgia of youth that&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>but I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t even have a class system,</p>
<p>a level system, the combat system is terrible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no journal,</p>
<p>the magic system is terrible and so forth.</p>
<p>And so I just wanted to start somewhere</p>
<p>and I felt like that would be</p>
<p>an incredibly fun overhaul project.</p>
<p>I kind of got the idea from Beamdog Studios</p>
<p>when they did another one of my favorite games,</p>
<p>remember Baldur&rsquo;s Gate?</p>
<p>Yeah, they did the enhanced.</p>
<p>I love that Baldur&rsquo;s Gate too.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the enhanced edition was great.</p>
<p>They should have never just done thrown a ball,</p>
<p>they should have done an actual proper sequel</p>
<p>and gone down that whole road.</p>
<p>But anyway, I got the idea there.</p>
<p>I said, well, take some old piece of IP</p>
<p>and then you can kind of retrofit it and clean it up.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s nice about Legends of Valor</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a blank slate.</p>
<p>You can do your own Elder Scrolls,</p>
<p>you can create your own class system</p>
<p>and level system and so forth.</p>
<p>You could write some beautiful,</p>
<p>exciting, fun narratives for that.</p>
<p>And also it gives me a chance to explore a lot of things</p>
<p>I think should be dragged into game development,</p>
<p>like algorithmically generated music</p>
<p>is one example.</p>
<p>The problem with games, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>you play lots and lots of hours,</p>
<p>but your sound content is much smaller.</p>
<p>So you have tons of repetition in the soundtrack.</p>
<p>So what if you could connect the music</p>
<p>to the state of the game world</p>
<p>and it automatically through some process</p>
<p>will generate music.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually people who study this.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one dimension.</p>
<p>The other thing is you have things like GPT3 and so forth.</p>
<p>There was a great game, Event Zero,</p>
<p>and it came out like 2016 where you could actually</p>
<p>have a dialogue with an AI and you&rsquo;re like a marooned</p>
<p>astronaut on a space station that&rsquo;s abandoned.</p>
<p>And you have to somehow work with this AI</p>
<p>through communicating with it to convince you</p>
<p>to take you home.</p>
<p>But the AI is a bit duplicitous.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna spoil the plot of the game</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a cool game,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually like a paint by numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like Zork where you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>preselected dialogue.</p>
<p>You actually type in the terminal</p>
<p>and the AI will reply to you back and forth.</p>
<p>And this was 2016 and it&rsquo;s like things have gotten</p>
<p>an order of magnitude better.</p>
<p>So the evolution of that tech,</p>
<p>I think within the next five years,</p>
<p>brought into video games could give you</p>
<p>incredibly cool dialogue inside the game.</p>
<p>So algorithmically generated music,</p>
<p>better dialogue, better gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;d love to explore alternative physics systems,</p>
<p>alternative geometries like hyperbolic geometry</p>
<p>or these types of things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually Hyperbolica is a game that does that.</p>
<p>And you can do down the Euclidean geometry as well</p>
<p>and bring those elements into a game design.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do with Legends of Valor.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be kind of like Skyrim,</p>
<p>but with a lot of really cool new shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like, I saw Aerosmith years ago</p>
<p>and he was out there, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>do you like the old shit?</p>
<p>Do you like new shit?</p>
<p>Kind of middle shit, you know?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going for the middle.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna try to do some of the old</p>
<p>and some of the new and bring it in.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;ll be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s nice about it is that there is a lot of</p>
<p>new play in the market</p>
<p>because of the Microsoft acquisition of Bethesda.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been losing employees like crazy</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of belief that Elder Scrolls 6</p>
<p>will not live up to expectations</p>
<p>because Microsoft will kill it.</p>
<p>I will tweet.</p>
<p>Okay, listen to me.</p>
<p>I will go into, I&rsquo;m all about love on the internet,</p>
<p>but I will go hard at you Microsoft</p>
<p>if you screw up Elder Scrolls.</p>
<p>Well, we might have to do a spiritual successor, right?</p>
<p>It might have to happen with Legends of Valor.</p>
<p>You never know.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a passion project,</p>
<p>so I have no time for it at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like solo on my list of things to do.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll probably do it in 2022, 2023</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll build a nice crew and we&rsquo;ll do it in Wyoming,</p>
<p>probably in Wheatland or some really small town</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll import everybody</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll have to build the whole city up</p>
<p>like Elon is doing here in Texas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a fun project.</p>
<p>Well, I like programmatically generated music.</p>
<p>You mentioned Baldur&rsquo;s Gate.</p>
<p>By the way, Haskell frameworks for that.</p>
<p>Euterpe is one.</p>
<p>For generating music?</p>
<p>Yeah, for doing it.</p>
<p>I wonder how successful that could be</p>
<p>because I remember Baldur&rsquo;s Gate was the first game</p>
<p>where I realized music is so important to the game.</p>
<p>It was the thing I remembered about the game.</p>
<p>It was the reason that,</p>
<p>it was the thing I thought about</p>
<p>when I was away from the game</p>
<p>is like the feeling it created, that music.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember the music anymore,</p>
<p>but I remember the music.</p>
<p>Bum, bum, dum, dum.</p>
<p>Jeremy Soule, I think was the composer.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>And actually getting like Raman Juwadi</p>
<p>or Bear McCready in to do that, that would be so cool.</p>
<p>Okay, this is awesome.</p>
<p>Ridiculous question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, maybe let&rsquo;s say top three</p>
<p>graded video games of all time?</p>
<p>Yeah, Baldur&rsquo;s Gate is definitely in the top three.</p>
<p>Arcanum is my favorite game.</p>
<p>And Arcanum was, Troika Games was just this amazing studio</p>
<p>where they took the time to build probably</p>
<p>the most compelling game worlds.</p>
<p>In the case of Arcanum, it takes place</p>
<p>in kind of like a 19th century Victorian England play.</p>
<p>So steampunk, but then there&rsquo;s also magic</p>
<p>inside this game world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this crazy juxtaposition</p>
<p>between magic and technology.</p>
<p>And the more technology you have, magic stops working.</p>
<p>The more magic you have, it disrupts technology.</p>
<p>So all the people on the magic side</p>
<p>hate the technology people and vice versa.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re just this character in this game world</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just trying to figure out like where do you fit?</p>
<p>And it has this incredible plot</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re kind of just a stowaway on a zeppelin</p>
<p>that gets shot down and you get dragged</p>
<p>into this conspiracy and you have to kind of figure out</p>
<p>the conspiracy as you go through the whole game world.</p>
<p>And you meet all these different races</p>
<p>like the elves and the dwarves and so forth.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve all been impacted by the proliferation</p>
<p>of technology in different ways.</p>
<p>Like the humans use steam engines</p>
<p>to clear cut all the forest and it caused a lot of problems.</p>
<p>The dwarves leaked that technology to the humans</p>
<p>and so they kind of got exiled for it and so forth.</p>
<p>And you have to decide like where do you fit in all of this?</p>
<p>And you have a lot of choices as a player.</p>
<p>You can be on the magic side, the technology side,</p>
<p>kind of be neutral.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like 40 different endings for the game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>And this is all like 2000.</p>
<p>And then you talk about a procedurally generated world.</p>
<p>You have a quick travel, but if you want,</p>
<p>you can just walk and the world randomly generates.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like Daggerfall</p>
<p>where there was interesting things along the way.</p>
<p>So it was really ahead of its time</p>
<p>and it was kind of the last of a generation of games.</p>
<p>It was based on the same framework</p>
<p>that Interplay used for Fallout,</p>
<p>the original Fallout and Fallout 2.</p>
<p>So that was really a cool setup.</p>
<p>How were the graphics that were not essential to the game?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s isometric, top down.</p>
<p>So kind of like the Fallout look.</p>
<p>And so it doesn&rsquo;t hold up super well today,</p>
<p>but that was never the point.</p>
<p>It was more of a story driven game.</p>
<p>But it was one of the very few games</p>
<p>where at the very end of the game,</p>
<p>you can actually talk the villain into killing himself</p>
<p>instead of fighting you.</p>
<p>If you, and you had to really work at it,</p>
<p>you had to become a master of persuasion</p>
<p>and get your charisma score maxed out</p>
<p>and learn all this stuff along the way.</p>
<p>And you have this philosophical debate</p>
<p>over the nature of life and death with him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>by the way, you&rsquo;re wrong and here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, you got a point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna kill myself.</p>
<p>I was like, wow, this is great.</p>
<p>Planescape Torment is the other one,</p>
<p>I think is probably the greatest.</p>
<p>Was it called Planescape?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s another one on the Infinity Engine,</p>
<p>which was what was used for Baldur&rsquo;s Gate.</p>
<p>So it looks like Baldur&rsquo;s Gate.</p>
<p>And God, that was such an incredibly well written game.</p>
<p>You play this character called the Nameless One,</p>
<p>this little blue guy, and you wake up in a morgue.</p>
<p>And it turns out that you&rsquo;re a mortal.</p>
<p>And every time you die, you lose all your memories.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve just been apparently living this life</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>And you meet all these people</p>
<p>in this crazy city called Sigil who know you,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know yourself.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to figure out your name, your identity,</p>
<p>and why do you have this curse where you live forever,</p>
<p>but you keep forgetting every time you get killed.</p>
<p>And it turns out you weren&rsquo;t such a nice person</p>
<p>throughout this entire game world.</p>
<p>But then again, there&rsquo;s this question of,</p>
<p>well, if you can start over and you lose all your memories,</p>
<p>do you have a chance for redemption or not?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an incredible game, Planescape Torment.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually another one of those games</p>
<p>where you can never actually have a fight.</p>
<p>You can just kind of talk your way out of everything.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably like a thousand pages of dialogue</p>
<p>inside the game.</p>
<p>You guys had a lot of fun and a lot of drugs</p>
<p>making that game.</p>
<p>Do you think these three games are the kinds</p>
<p>that would still be okay to play today</p>
<p>or are they forever lost in time</p>
<p>because we sort of got desensitized</p>
<p>to the richness of computer graphics</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things in modern games?</p>
<p>I think you can enhance these games</p>
<p>because your storytelling medium is so much more engaging.</p>
<p>I was at the movie theater before COVID</p>
<p>and the person to the left of me</p>
<p>was looking at their cell phone during the movie.</p>
<p>And the person to the right of me</p>
<p>was looking at their cell phone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not engaged anymore.</p>
<p>Everybody is attention starved.</p>
<p>And the video game is one of the last mediums</p>
<p>where you have undivided attention of people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really into it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all into that thing.</p>
<p>And so I think the fact that you have VR and AR</p>
<p>and enhanced graphics and all these new gameplay mechanics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a value add instead of a value negative</p>
<p>because ultimately what are you doing?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re telling stories</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to connect people to something.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the nature of life and death</p>
<p>or are we truly real?</p>
<p>Or are we in a simulation or not or something like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be great to do 13th floor as a game</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And the question is, well, how good of a story can you tell?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re constrained</p>
<p>by your storytelling tools and technology.</p>
<p>The fact that games are so much more advanced now</p>
<p>means that you now have many more dimensions</p>
<p>of storytelling available to you.</p>
<p>And actually with AI now coming in</p>
<p>and really good AI coming in the next five or 10 years,</p>
<p>your storytelling is not static anymore.</p>
<p>The person can actually majorly participate</p>
<p>and change the outcome in ways</p>
<p>that were previously unpredictable.</p>
<p>The other thing is they&rsquo;re still educational.</p>
<p>You can teach people concepts that they never knew before.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, if you wanna teach people</p>
<p>about bizarre geometries or like Minecraft</p>
<p>is a great example.</p>
<p>A lot of people learned how computers work from Redstone.</p>
<p>Think about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, yeah, as we said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re more and more going to be living</p>
<p>in a video game worlds might as well</p>
<p>sort of as opposed to just make it fun,</p>
<p>also expand our knowledge,</p>
<p>expand our ability to think,</p>
<p>like explore different ideas</p>
<p>and do education broadly defined</p>
<p>within those video game worlds.</p>
<p>So we do the entirety,</p>
<p>the entirety of life in the video game worlds.</p>
<p>Hopefully it doesn&rsquo;t look like Minecraft, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people today</p>
<p>aside from playing lots of video games?</p>
<p>You know, high schoolers, college students,</p>
<p>thinking about their career, thinking about life.</p>
<p>Well, we no longer live in a world</p>
<p>where you get one skill set,</p>
<p>you do it for 40 years and retire.</p>
<p>I mean, that ship has sailed a long time ago.</p>
<p>So learn how to learn and learn an appreciation</p>
<p>and love for learning.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first thing, you know,</p>
<p>Josh Waitzkins wrote this beautiful book,</p>
<p>The Art of Learning, if you ever read it.</p>
<p>Stuff like that.</p>
<p>So good study skills, you know,</p>
<p>slip box notes, these things.</p>
<p>What was it, Zettelkasten or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of little techniques</p>
<p>that you can pick up along the way.</p>
<p>And basically they teach you how to process</p>
<p>lots of information very quickly,</p>
<p>retain it and then decide what&rsquo;s useful to you</p>
<p>for that moment.</p>
<p>The second thing is do not undervalue EQ,</p>
<p>emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve lived for a long time in a society</p>
<p>where IQ was dominant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how smart you are excuses everything else.</p>
<p>You can be a horrible human being,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a really bright guy, right?</p>
<p>The asshole mathematician or physicist.</p>
<p>We now live in a world where the balance</p>
<p>is far more important.</p>
<p>You have to be smart, but you also have to be a nice guy.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t undervalue that.</p>
<p>So learn things like closed circuit communication</p>
<p>and active listening.</p>
<p>These skillsets will always pay enormous dividends</p>
<p>along the way.</p>
<p>Third, remember that you&rsquo;re judged for the things</p>
<p>that you have and what you do with those things.</p>
<p>You know, if you have very little,</p>
<p>you still have to do something.</p>
<p>When you have a lot, you have to do even more.</p>
<p>So learn how to give and do that early on.</p>
<p>Learn how to give back, volunteerism, charity,</p>
<p>mentoring, these types of things.</p>
<p>Those are so incredibly valuable to a person who&rsquo;s developed.</p>
<p>The people that you mentored in the academic world,</p>
<p>you learn this, you have graduate students.</p>
<p>They one day will be professors.</p>
<p>And it might just so happen, they might eclipse you.</p>
<p>Remember Gauss had a doctoral advisor.</p>
<p>Never forget that, you know, and so did Feynman.</p>
<p>Make sure that you mentor people, you give back</p>
<p>and you learn how to learn and you learn how to teach.</p>
<p>Super important for your development as a person.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice all those things are agnostic</p>
<p>to whatever domain you happen to have chosen.</p>
<p>You could be in medicine or law or technology, whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your fancy, whatever your passion happens to be.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t conflate your earning in your career.</p>
<p>If people try to keep putting these things together,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re increasingly becoming decoupled.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of cases where people do their passions</p>
<p>and they do it for free or, you know, for sustenance,</p>
<p>but then they have something else they do on the side</p>
<p>to also augment or supplement their income.</p>
<p>Probably best that way.</p>
<p>When you conflate the two, you tend to get</p>
<p>burned out terribly.</p>
<p>You see this a lot with musicians or other people.</p>
<p>They just, they want to make music,</p>
<p>but they have to tour or whatever,</p>
<p>because they gotta pay bills.</p>
<p>Stuff like that happens.</p>
<p>Other than that, I mean, I&rsquo;m not a guru.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in any particular position to&hellip;</p>
<p>You showed up in a robe, which I thought was kind of weird.</p>
<p>And you had a crown and you kept calling yourself king.</p>
<p>King of the rats.</p>
<p>And that was in a robe that was a yukata.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you for clarifying.</p>
<p>Audience, he&rsquo;s joking.</p>
<p>I read it.</p>
<p>I heard somebody who&rsquo;s gonna write blog posts.</p>
<p>Charles Hoskinson walks around with a crown.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a ridiculously big</p>
<p>and the most important question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of this whole thing, of life?</p>
<p>Well, I got a story for that.</p>
<p>Does this have something to do with a farm?</p>
<p>Well, no, no, no, it&rsquo;s from Japan.</p>
<p>I used to live in Japan.</p>
<p>I live in Osaka, right next to Namba, beautiful area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if you&rsquo;re gonna live anywhere in Japan,</p>
<p>I live in Osaka.</p>
<p>You live anywhere in Osaka,</p>
<p>live next to the restaurant district.</p>
<p>Four o clock in the morning, you can get good ramen.</p>
<p>These are the things in life that make you who you are.</p>
<p>So there was a shogun and he was kind of a bad ass.</p>
<p>He was really good killing people,</p>
<p>really good at running his empire.</p>
<p>And then he got a bit disgruntled in his late 40s.</p>
<p>And he said, you know, I&rsquo;m just gonna give it all to my son</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna wander around Japan</p>
<p>until I find the perfect cherry blossom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna do.</p>
<p>Everybody thought he went crazy.</p>
<p>He said, no, no, no, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna do.</p>
<p>And he took his whole entourage with him.</p>
<p>And so his son is now the shogun.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s just wandering throughout Japan</p>
<p>and having all these incredible crazy adventures</p>
<p>as he&rsquo;s wandering throughout Japan,</p>
<p>fighting bandits and loving beautiful women and so forth.</p>
<p>And then 30 years later, he&rsquo;s passing these two geisha gals</p>
<p>and one of them turns around</p>
<p>and they notice him slumped over next to a cherry tree.</p>
<p>And so she goes over to try to rouse him and he&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>And in his hands is a wilted cherry blossom.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a very Japanese story, right?</p>
<p>The point is that it&rsquo;s not the actual blossom</p>
<p>finding the perfection that matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the things you do on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>The places you go, the people you meet,</p>
<p>the experiences you have and the joy you take</p>
<p>in the things that you do here in the moment now.</p>
<p>You have to get there.</p>
<p>You know, if you look at Jiro dreams of sushi,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this guy 70 years of his life</p>
<p>making the same damn piece of sushi</p>
<p>again and again and again.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the happiest guy around.</p>
<p>Albert Camus and his story of Sisyphus.</p>
<p>You know, Sisyphus should be miserable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Greek curse.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s happy.</p>
<p>He has total clarity of purpose.</p>
<p>And every day he gets to basically roll that stone</p>
<p>just a little bit better than the day before,</p>
<p>a different way than the day before.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the destination.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t getting the stone up</p>
<p>to the top of the hill that matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that the act,</p>
<p>you find that joy in that act, that ikigai,</p>
<p>that way of life, that purpose of life.</p>
<p>That I think is the closest thing</p>
<p>a human can get to a meaning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a blip.</p>
<p>You know, you didn&rsquo;t exist, you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>And if you compare it to the size of the universe</p>
<p>in that time, it&rsquo;s just a little blip.</p>
<p>So all you can do with what you have</p>
<p>is just find meaning in the things</p>
<p>that you do on a daily basis.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t predict the macro.</p>
<p>We have all this wealth and power in America.</p>
<p>What if a world war breaks out?</p>
<p>We could be destitute like Walmart Germany.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you could be a big guy.</p>
<p>You could be now living on the street side.</p>
<p>Would you be miserable?</p>
<p>The point of life is getting to a point</p>
<p>that no matter what comes your way,</p>
<p>what misfortune comes your way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a position where you can find</p>
<p>a modicum of happiness and love and empathy</p>
<p>for others in that moment.</p>
<p>And then the highest pursuit of life</p>
<p>is the ability to share that mindset with other people</p>
<p>and give it to them somehow.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really hard, you know,</p>
<p>because everybody comes in, they&rsquo;re always Eeyore,</p>
<p>oh, doom and gloom and cynical,</p>
<p>and but this and that and reputation this and that.</p>
<p>You have to somehow transcend all of it and say,</p>
<p>you know, that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Look at the cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t they beautiful today?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s find a better one tomorrow.</p>
<p>See, you&rsquo;re also a fan of fishing, I read somewhere.</p>
<p>And one of my favorite books is Old Man and the Sea,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s an old man sort of battling a big fish</p>
<p>and basically closing out the last chapter of his life</p>
<p>in this battle.</p>
<p>So I think another aspect of life with this boulder,</p>
<p>it feels like the boulder gets bigger and bigger</p>
<p>as we get closer to death.</p>
<p>And, you know, you find yourself married</p>
<p>to a particular struggle in life</p>
<p>that eventually just kind of overtakes</p>
<p>the entirety of meaning of your existence.</p>
<p>Do you think, I know what it is for me.</p>
<p>Do you have something like that?</p>
<p>The broader vision that unites your work with Cardano</p>
<p>and everything you&rsquo;ve done in life,</p>
<p>the big fish that you&rsquo;re going to end up</p>
<p>in the dark of night,</p>
<p>struggling with the last chapter of your life,</p>
<p>like the big problem you&rsquo;re taking on?</p>
<p>Well, in mathematics, it was the Goldbach conjecture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to prove that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably not gonna work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really big fish.</p>
<p>So do you still have a love for mathematics?</p>
<p>Oh God, yeah, of course I do.</p>
<p>You never lose that.</p>
<p>You lose the ability to do deep work</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have the creativity</p>
<p>and the raw inspiration.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;ve gotten to automated theorem proving</p>
<p>because what I lack and because I&rsquo;m getting older,</p>
<p>I can now have computers understand it</p>
<p>and use AI to just solve this stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the cheat codes for math.</p>
<p>Fuck those guys, we&rsquo;ll still do that.</p>
<p>But you know, mathematics still has those last passions</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all kinds of cool things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to see done.</p>
<p>Like quota complexes allow you to unify topology</p>
<p>and number theory in really novel ways.</p>
<p>And there are all kinds of cool things, but who cares?</p>
<p>Everybody has those white whales.</p>
<p>Another thing I love to do is bring back the woolly mammoth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s George Church&rsquo;s hidden pleasure.</p>
<p>In five to 10 years, it&rsquo;s actually gonna happen.</p>
<p>And I have this beautiful ranch in Wyoming</p>
<p>and I gotta find a way to convince George</p>
<p>to let me raise his clone mammoth fence on my ranch.</p>
<p>Among the bison.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d probably get along really well.</p>
<p>And then I have to learn all these cool things</p>
<p>about woolly mammoths.</p>
<p>Like do you shave them in the summertime</p>
<p>and let them get shaggy during the winter</p>
<p>or do you just let that coat go and then it falls?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an undiscovered country.</p>
<p>I just had the image of Charles Hoskinson alone</p>
<p>on a bison farm trying to raise a woolly mammoth.</p>
<p>Just start wearing a white suit</p>
<p>and say welcome to Hoskinson&rsquo;s ranch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have a cane with amber on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, with a chalkboard that you keep scrambling on</p>
<p>like the beautiful mind in the movie</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have voices.</p>
<p>All the schizophrenia&rsquo;s already come.</p>
<p>You guys are all figments of my imagination anyway.</p>
<p>Now one of my goals though, I love catfish</p>
<p>and they live a long time.</p>
<p>They get really damn big if you see those guys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to catch one now and be in my 60s</p>
<p>and catch the same fish twice and recognize it.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll lift a scar or something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be really cool, going back to the fish thing.</p>
<p>Because both the fish has gone through a lot,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through a lot.</p>
<p>We can just be like old friends.</p>
<p>Reminisce.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>About a life well lived.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll die of a heart attack and my mammoths will eat me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something to look forward to.</p>
<p>Charles, this is one of the most amazing conversations</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly an honor that you would spend</p>
<p>your valuable time with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you exist in the cryptocurrency</p>
<p>and the technology space.</p>
<p>I can see your love for mathematics and your love for life</p>
<p>just radiate through everything you do.</p>
<p>Thank you for being you</p>
<p>and thank you for talking to me today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Charles Hoskinson.</p>
<p>Thank you to Gala Games, Allform, Indeed, ExpressVPN,</p>
<p>and Eight Sleep.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description</p>
<p>to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from William Faulkner.</p>
<p>You cannot swim for new horizons</p>
<p>until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
