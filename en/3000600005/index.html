I&amp;rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&amp;rsquo;t go and give a shout-out

So, can I ask you guys to stand up for a brief second,

<li>Good evening, everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Michael Martin,</p>
<p>and I am excited that we are kicking off the</p>
<p>Johnny Martin Mental Healthcare Challenge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t go and give a shout-out</p>
<p>to the student chairs and team in this room before</p>
<p>we get things kicked off.</p>
<p>So, can I ask you guys to stand up for a brief second,</p>
<p>and get your applause?</p>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
<p>We have a fantastic evening plan for you,</p>
<p>and it gives me great pleasure to introduce someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s very, very important to this school, Dean Harrison.</p>
<p>Dean Harrison is renowned as an economist</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s dedicated her career to creating inclusive</p>
<p>and sustainable policies in development,</p>
<p>economics, international trade,</p>
<p>global labor markets, and now, in higher education.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also been very supportive of our efforts</p>
<p>to create awareness of mental health care related issues,</p>
<p>and is helping us to go and strive to improve the quality of</p>
<p>and access to mental health care for all.</p>
<p>So, without one more second being wasted, Ann Harrison.</p>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much, Michael.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an honor to be here</p>
<p>for this really important event.</p>
<p>And Michael, thank you so much for all the work</p>
<p>that you have done to make this happen.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t have had this and tomorrow without Michael,</p>
<p>so we should give him round of applause.</p>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
<p>So now, it&rsquo;s my privilege to introduce today&rsquo;s speaker,</p>
<p>and (indistinct) BS/05 Karan Singh.</p>
<p>Karan co-founded Ginger,</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s first mental health technology platform in 2011.</p>
<p>By combining high quality human care</p>
<p>with data science and augmented intelligence,</p>
<p>the team at Ginger created an entirely new platform</p>
<p>for the delivery of mental healthcare on demand.</p>
<p>As COO, Karan has led Ginger&rsquo;s reach</p>
<p>to over 25 million people in more than 50 countries</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>In 2021, Headspace dedicated to science-backed meditation</p>
<p>and mindfulness tools,</p>
<p>joined forces with Ginger to form Headspace Health,</p>
<p>forming the world&rsquo;s most comprehensive</p>
<p>and accessible mental healthcare platform.</p>
<p>Karan currently serves as COO of Headspace Health,</p>
<p>which touches nearly 100 million people worldwide.</p>
<p>Karan is a leader in the digital health community,</p>
<p>serving as a scholar at the Aspen Institute,</p>
<p>and delivering keynotes at the Public Health Institute</p>
<p>and the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<p>Ginger has received numerous recognitions,</p>
<p>including by the World Economic Forum</p>
<p>as a technology pioneer, and by Fast Company</p>
<p>as one of the most innovative companies in healthcare.</p>
<p>Karan, thank you so much for taking the time</p>
<p>to speak with us today.</p>
<p>We are really grateful to have you back here on the campus,</p>
<p>and we look forward to a lively and informative discussion</p>
<p>on a really, really important topic.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m now going to turn it over</p>
<p>to our fabulous MBA students,</p>
<p>Matheus Loesche and Madhu Gupta.</p>
<p>And they will moderate today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>Take it away.</p>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, is it working?</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, Karan, thank you so much for coming today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pleasure to have you here with us tonight.</p>
<p>I also like to thank our audience</p>
<p>for taking some time to hear more about Karan&rsquo;s career</p>
<p>and also the mental healthcare industry,</p>
<p>I think, it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>My name is Matheus, as Dean Harrison said.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a second year MBA class of 2023,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be moderating this panel along with&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Madhu Gupta.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a first year MBA class of 2024,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very excited to talk</p>
<p>about all things mental health with you tonight.</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, let&rsquo;s jump in for the first question.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Karan, I&rsquo;d love to start this conversation</p>
<p>with learning more about you.</p>
<p>We have tell more about yourself here</p>
<p>that you must be having training a lot as well.</p>
<p>So, who is Karan?</p>
<p>Can you please tell me a little bit more</p>
<p>about your journey, education, family,</p>
<p>your inspirations, and also,</p>
<p>like we can&rsquo;t leave this aside,</p>
<p>what prompts you to take the leap</p>
<p>and risk of founding Ginger?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure, happy too.</li>
</ul>
<p>And Dean Harrison and Michael,</p>
<p>thank you again for this opportunity.</p>
<p>This is a full circle moment.</p>
<p>I was sharing with my wife who is also an undergrad from Cal</p>
<p>and came back for her PhD in the School of Public Health,</p>
<p>that this is pretty special,</p>
<p>I mean, to have a entire event dedicated</p>
<p>to mental healthcare and mental health innovation.</p>
<p>I mean, it really takes this room</p>
<p>and countless others like this</p>
<p>to really solve this challenge.</p>
<p>So, you know, while the accolades are wonderful,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really still a drop in the bucket when it comes</p>
<p>to just how much access and how much need there is</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>So, happy to start at the very beginning</p>
<p>and be as real as we can through this.</p>
<p>I was very, very beginning born in Malaysia.</p>
<p>My parents moved to Cleveland, Ohio,</p>
<p>when I was about two.</p>
<p>I came out to the Bay Area when I was about 10,</p>
<p>and I came to Cal,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted to be when I grow up.</p>
<p>I knew I wanted to do something with purpose,</p>
<p>and I had this vague notion of what that meant.</p>
<p>And I never realized actually</p>
<p>that I think business could be a vehicle for that.</p>
<p>And so, I think, like most people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t know what they wanna do when they grow up,</p>
<p>I got into consulting &lsquo;cause I wanted to keep learning</p>
<p>and I wanted to keep solving</p>
<p>what I thought was tough problems.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I spent a few years,</p>
<p>close to five years actually doing that.</p>
<p>And now, about 13 years ago,</p>
<p>had a personal brush with mental health,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m sure many people in this room.</p>
<p>I was on the other end of a phone call after a loved one</p>
<p>who had tried to take their own life.</p>
<p>And you know, I&rsquo;ve always thought of myself</p>
<p>as a good read on people and a good judge of character,</p>
<p>and you know, I had no idea at all.</p>
<p>And you know, I realized in a lot of communities of color,</p>
<p>especially, my family&rsquo;s originally from India,</p>
<p>mental health is just the no-go zone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the topic that just no one talks about.</p>
<p>And I realize when I look back at that time that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually something we didn&rsquo;t talk about.</p>
<p>So, that was the spark for me,</p>
<p>that kind of eventually set me on the path</p>
<p>to founding Ginger.</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes sense, makes sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>And also speaking a little bit</p>
<p>about your consulting career a little bit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been like five years, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken,</p>
<p>in consulting, working for ZS Associates Consulting.</p>
<p>And like, what make you,</p>
<p>there are many folks here that stop their career</p>
<p>to take their MBAs, and what make you,</p>
<p>like, what prompt you to pivot from a career</p>
<p>into an MBA?</p>
<p>And following up on that,</p>
<p>when you embark into the NBA journey,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s becoming a founder already a dream goal of yours?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Was being a founder a dream goal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Matthew] Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, I wanna say that it was,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>but no, no. (audience laughing)</p>
<p>I think, maybe I&rsquo;ll go backwards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with that and we can talk about consulting.</p>
<p>You know, I had this blush with mental health, right?</p>
<p>And then the deeper I dug,</p>
<p>the more I realized that teammates</p>
<p>at work were experiencing stress and burnout,</p>
<p>that people in my family directly that I was at times,</p>
<p>you know, going through</p>
<p>what I thought were just these ups and downs,</p>
<p>but was real meaningful stress or anxiety at times.</p>
<p>And so, I went back to school with the idea</p>
<p>that I wanted to create the space to try to think about</p>
<p>and do something here.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t really know what it was gonna look like.</p>
<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t have an intention of starting a company.</p>
<p>I had wanted to actually try to tackle this problem,</p>
<p>you know, having grown up in the Bay Area,</p>
<p>having seen the rise of technology</p>
<p>and kinda the impact it could have,</p>
<p>thinking about how technology could play a role</p>
<p>in mental health.</p>
<p>And you know, at the time,</p>
<p>there was really just a couple of use cases for technology.</p>
<p>There was biotechnology, there was EMRs and medical records,</p>
<p>and then there was everything else, right?</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t really a digital health ecosystem.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t care delivery innovation</p>
<p>or thinking about new ways</p>
<p>of actually scaling access to care.</p>
<p>And so, I went back to school</p>
<p>in a dual degree program between Harvard and MIT,</p>
<p>really focused on this intersection</p>
<p>of health science and technology.</p>
<p>And I just kept bugging everybody I could find</p>
<p>and asking them what they knew about mental health,</p>
<p>and the different applications for technology</p>
<p>and mental health.</p>
<p>And I kind of stumbled</p>
<p>into sort of the original kind of founding of Ginger.</p>
<p>And when I look back and I give advice to entrepreneurs</p>
<p>who are thinking about starting a company,</p>
<p>I usually say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>Really, really, don&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>unless you just can&rsquo;t shake it.</p>
<p>You know, like this idea of founder market fit</p>
<p>or the idea that like,</p>
<p>you really can&rsquo;t not solve this problem was I think,</p>
<p>probably, most prominent for me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s ultimately why I decided that</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t see anything else out there,</p>
<p>that I needed to solve it.</p>
<p>I think the world has changed quite a bit,</p>
<p>the fact that, again,</p>
<p>we have this room with these many people</p>
<p>that there might actually be things out there</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t necessarily require you to start a company</p>
<p>that you could actually still have impact with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for sharing, Karan,</li>
</ul>
<p>that was really insightful.</p>
<p>Speaking of school, we know that your team</p>
<p>at the MIT media lab was pivotal in the founding of Ginger.</p>
<p>We have many aspiring entrepreneurs here today,</p>
<p>and similar to MIT, has a variety</p>
<p>of different entrepreneurship focus programs and resources.</p>
<p>You touched upon this a little bit,</p>
<p>but just going a step further,</p>
<p>what are the types of resources that you would recommend</p>
<p>that folks here in the room take advantage</p>
<p>of during their MBA program?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot in that question.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think, there&rsquo;s a lot of great opportunities</p>
<p>at a place like Cal.</p>
<p>You know, I think one of the things I learned was just</p>
<p>how important innovation happens</p>
<p>at these intersection of these disciplines</p>
<p>of people who wouldn&rsquo;t have historically gotten together</p>
<p>that start to have a conversation around a problem</p>
<p>and look at it from different angles.</p>
<p>And so, you know, just as a starting point,</p>
<p>being engaged in these sorts of activities,</p>
<p>but just as importantly,</p>
<p>also getting out of Haas</p>
<p>and getting into the rest of the community</p>
<p>or bringing others into Haas and thinking about,</p>
<p>how can other people solve this problem, right?</p>
<p>Like, one of my favorite examples was,</p>
<p>you know, I would go to a course,</p>
<p>actually, we didn&rsquo;t have a course on sales,</p>
<p>like, sales training and negotiations,</p>
<p>and they actually implemented one my second year</p>
<p>in business school.</p>
<p>And I loved going to those courses and then taking that</p>
<p>and trying to apply it to an explicit problem.</p>
<p>So, at the time,</p>
<p>we had just founded Ginger.</p>
<p>And so, I was finding myself in class learning about</p>
<p>how to influence people,</p>
<p>learning about how to build a balance sheet,</p>
<p>learning about these sort of business fundamentals</p>
<p>and then applying that to the startup.</p>
<p>The thing that I didn&rsquo;t learn</p>
<p>that I wish I had learned was the importance</p>
<p>of founder mental health,</p>
<p>the importance of actually taking care of yourself,</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re going through that journey,</p>
<p>I think, at the time, and even still now to some degree,</p>
<p>most people and many founders actually burn out</p>
<p>in their first few years</p>
<p>because they actually don&rsquo;t take care</p>
<p>of their own mental health through that.</p>
<p>And so that was a huge lesson for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s definitely, I think, we&rsquo;re all,</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I speak for everyone in this room when I say</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all navigating similar experiences,</p>
<p>and hearing sort of your experience going</p>
<p>through all of that is very helpful.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a great segue actually to my next question,</p>
<p>which is around, you know,</p>
<p>in the spirit of getting to know you a little bit more,</p>
<p>and we are here to talk about mental health, I can go first.</p>
<p>Personally, for me,</p>
<p>I was just telling Karan a little bit ago,</p>
<p>but my prior employer was contracted with Ginger.</p>
<p>And so, Ginger and their mental health resources,</p>
<p>has been my best friend for the past four years.</p>
<p>And especially, during the pandemic,</p>
<p>when the mental health challenges became a lot more real</p>
<p>for a lot of people, such as burnout,</p>
<p>which you just talked about.</p>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;m curious, Karan,</p>
<p>what are the types of things and practices</p>
<p>that you engage in to prioritize your own mental health,</p>
<p>and especially, in a very turbulent time like this,</p>
<p>and let alone for founder,</p>
<p>what are the types of things that keep you going?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve developed a routine now.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have that while I was in school.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I actually,</p>
<p>if we can rewind back to the question,</p>
<p>and then we can kind of get to what I do now,</p>
<p>because I think, in business school,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that not enough people</p>
<p>or maybe not even business school, but in graduate school,</p>
<p>not enough people were real, were just authentic,</p>
<p>were honest and open and knew what they wanted.</p>
<p>They knew what other people thought,</p>
<p>they were supposed to do.</p>
<p>And as a result, they pursued things</p>
<p>that actually didn&rsquo;t give them happiness.</p>
<p>And I think I was in that camp too,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t think I fully understood</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s taken me this journey over the last decade now</p>
<p>to really understand that.</p>
<p>And, you know, so tangibly what that means now</p>
<p>in terms of self-care, it&rsquo;s, I meditate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a long time Headspace user actually,</p>
<p>prior to the merger.</p>
<p>And so, that was nice, again, full circle moment.</p>
<p>So, I meditate regularly,</p>
<p>and for me, that my practice is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a five minute walk,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just walk around the house or walk around the block</p>
<p>or walk in nature in some way and meditate.</p>
<p>And that just reset</p>
<p>in the morning has been incredibly helpful for me.</p>
<p>The second is, I have a group that I get together with</p>
<p>about once a month.</p>
<p>And it started in some ways like a founder support group,</p>
<p>a group of about eight other founders</p>
<p>who had started a company around the same time.</p>
<p>And we were just sharing, you know,</p>
<p>we thought was gonna be just work best practices, right?</p>
<p>And it very quickly turned</p>
<p>into just life best practices or life situations.</p>
<p>And people have gone through life tragedies,</p>
<p>divorces, family suicides,</p>
<p>companies that have closed down,</p>
<p>you know, just the whole gamut of situations</p>
<p>that are really incredibly stressful,</p>
<p>but ultimately, impact your ability to be really effective</p>
<p>on the job.</p>
<p>And I think that learning for me has been a willingness</p>
<p>to actually have those conversations,</p>
<p>and be real with others,</p>
<p>so that you can be really with yourself,</p>
<p>and you can actually hold yourself</p>
<p>to the things you care most about.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I wish that I had learned that earlier</p>
<p>in my career, that so much my success actually is a function</p>
<p>of developing these habits.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s amazing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for sharing that.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s switch gears here a little bit,</p>
<p>talk about more danger that you are</p>
<p>in the mental healthcare industry and its strengths.</p>
<p>And back in 2011 when you founded Ginger,</p>
<p>to put it simple, it was a time,</p>
<p>and that was that mental healthcare was not</p>
<p>so much like a thing in 2011.</p>
<p>The pandemic has changed the narrative</p>
<p>and mental health is now considered a critical part</p>
<p>of the core healthcare today.</p>
<p>And thinking about that in your product,</p>
<p>can you give us insight as</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s been like to work at a company</p>
<p>that has experienced such tremendous growth,</p>
<p>over the past few years?</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s really hard.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know, I think there&rsquo;s the pre-COVID story,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the COVID story.</p>
<p>I wanna say that mental health has made it</p>
<p>into the forefront.</p>
<p>I think, we&rsquo;re on that journey now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having these conversations,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having these conversations in these kinds of rooms</p>
<p>in government, in boardrooms, and in other settings</p>
<p>that have historically would never have been</p>
<p>in the dialogue.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve come a long way,</p>
<p>and still just a whole lot more we&rsquo;ve gotta do.</p>
<p>But yet, you know, 10 years ago,</p>
<p>there was no digital health industry.</p>
<p>There was no digital mental health industry.</p>
<p>And when we first started there was a lot of no,</p>
<p>a lot of not now, a lot of this is impossible,</p>
<p>and like, it&rsquo;s true for so many things.</p>
<p>You know, it takes resilience,</p>
<p>it takes being good at getting back up again.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Again, I mean, that&rsquo;s still true today, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure many of you in the audience here are pursuing this.</p>
<p>When we talk about mental health,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like talking about physical health, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredibly massive, huge need.</p>
<p>And so, no one company,</p>
<p>no one person is gonna solve this challenge, right?</p>
<p>And that was true 10 years ago,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s especially true now</p>
<p>where a billion people worldwide are in need of care.</p>
<p>COVID has just happened or is happening,</p>
<p>and the collective trauma</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve all experienced is real.</p>
<p>And so, that has only gotten worse,</p>
<p>unfortunately, not better.</p>
<p>And so I think the opportunity</p>
<p>that all of us have to really make an impact,</p>
<p>is even more pronounced.</p>
<p>So, we started the journey originally,</p>
<p>coming out of research,</p>
<p>we were doing at MIT at the time,</p>
<p>leveraging data we could collect passively</p>
<p>to really basically predict when someone, a patient,</p>
<p>a member was having a symptom flare.</p>
<p>And you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through a couple pivots over the years.</p>
<p>The first pivot was this business model pivot,</p>
<p>which was in effect, we used to sell to provider groups,</p>
<p>basically, sell to other hospitals and clinics,</p>
<p>that is the technology platform we had built.</p>
<p>And eventually, we realized that we had to become one,</p>
<p>that the only way to solve a broken system was</p>
<p>to really rewire the whole machine from soup to nuts,</p>
<p>was to recruit a provider group</p>
<p>that was actually reflective of the populations</p>
<p>we were trying to serve.</p>
<p>It was building a business model</p>
<p>that allowed for product innovation,</p>
<p>versus just fee for service medicine.</p>
<p>It was changing a few of these variables</p>
<p>that allowed us to then create an experience</p>
<p>that ultimately, you know,</p>
<p>members or individuals really needed,</p>
<p>which just in the existing system wasn&rsquo;t gonna get created.</p>
<ul>
<li>And just following up on that,</li>
</ul>
<p>like talking about the difficulties</p>
<p>that you had along the way,</p>
<p>we are seeing this,</p>
<p>today, like Facebook laid off 11,000 employees,</p>
<p>and this seems to be like a trend right now</p>
<p>with the current situation of the economy.</p>
<p>Companies are being forced to lay off employees</p>
<p>in cut costs.</p>
<p>Do you have any particular top of mind relevant examples</p>
<p>of challenges that you can share with us besides those ones,</p>
<p>but as an entrepreneur and along the way</p>
<p>that you were managing Ginger,</p>
<p>and how did you eventually overcome those situations?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna be a challenging year,</li>
</ul>
<p>there&rsquo;s no doubt.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s challenging 18 to 24 months,</p>
<p>and certainly, these are kinda the first signs</p>
<p>or maybe ongoing signs of that.</p>
<p>I think, for me,</p>
<p>the saving grace to some degree is,</p>
<p>like incredible companies, incredible products</p>
<p>and experiences get built in these situations.</p>
<p>We felt that coming out of getting into,</p>
<p>at the time I was in business school in 2009,</p>
<p>and saw just a meaningful and real downturn.</p>
<p>And when people go through those environments,</p>
<p>they start to question what they&rsquo;re working on,</p>
<p>what they care about.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s a huge reshifting of workforce</p>
<p>and labor into problems that matter.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s in some way a benefit</p>
<p>to what might be going on right now as painful</p>
<p>and as challenging as it is.</p>
<p>And it has been given COVID, given inflation,</p>
<p>given all these macro scenarios,</p>
<p>I think, there&rsquo;s also an incredible amount of innovation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening right now, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an incredible amount of people</p>
<p>who are willing to take a risk.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we&rsquo;ve had to see</p>
<p>that over the course of Ginger.</p>
<p>When we first made that business model pivot,</p>
<p>we actually had to go through a round of layoffs and change</p>
<p>and really retool the leadership team and our whole team,</p>
<p>which was hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get, right?</p>
<p>And doing that in a way that&rsquo;s compassionate,</p>
<p>in a way that actually cares for people,</p>
<p>but allows you to still stay true to your mission,</p>
<p>those are tough decisions to make.</p>
<p>But I think, looking back,</p>
<p>you know, it was the right decision that we made to change</p>
<p>that business model and actually retool the team</p>
<p>to really tackle this problem in the way</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve now fashion it.</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>I think, it&rsquo;s gonna be challenging over the last 18</p>
<p>to 24 months.</p>
<p>But I guess the flip side of it is also,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had an internal mantra right now,</p>
<p>around mindful entrepreneurship and mindful spending.</p>
<p>And the idea that in times like this,</p>
<p>you actually do question where you&rsquo;re making investments,</p>
<p>and you really start to double down and investigate</p>
<p>and figure out like, well,</p>
<p>okay, what&rsquo;s the kernel, what&rsquo;s the nugget?</p>
<p>Like, what is gonna be most valuable to invest in?</p>
<p>And you really adopt a model of essentialism, right?</p>
<p>Less but better, and I think that&rsquo;s what this is about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s subtraction, so you can focus on the things</p>
<p>that really do matter most,</p>
<p>and are ultimately gonna give you the impact,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking to achieve.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for sharing, Karan,</li>
</ul>
<p>that&rsquo;s definitely insightful.</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s obviously risk and reward</p>
<p>that comes with being a founder,</p>
<p>some of which you already spoke to right now.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s particularly something interesting</p>
<p>about being a leader of a mental health care company,</p>
<p>because there is a challenge that comes</p>
<p>with an accountability of the fact</p>
<p>that the company actually practices what it preaches.</p>
<p>As Dean Harrison mentioned,</p>
<p>you are the COO currently of Headspace Health.</p>
<p>As the COO, how do you ensure that your employees wellbeing</p>
<p>and mental wellbeing is maintained?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, when we first started,</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to always talk about how I almost felt inconsistent</p>
<p>with our mission to be a mental health startup,</p>
<p>because as a startup, you&rsquo;re going through the grind</p>
<p>or what feels like the grind, right?</p>
<p>And you know, I didn&rsquo;t realize just how true</p>
<p>that that was, right?</p>
<p>And managing a virtual first largely company now,</p>
<p>during COVID, has been hard.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s been hard on so many people,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s a few things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been able to do that have helped a lot.</p>
<p>One is just there&rsquo;s no replacement for space, time.</p>
<p>Again, going back to that less</p>
<p>but better sort of philosophy,</p>
<p>we have something we have called mind days,</p>
<p>where once every other week, we have Fridays in effect off,</p>
<p>allow people to just create the space they need</p>
<p>to invest in the things, oftentimes outside of work.</p>
<p>We start many meetings with a mindful moment</p>
<p>or even a mindful meditation,</p>
<p>which has been an incredible reset just</p>
<p>to get people centered before they start,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s back to back Zooms, one session after the other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been a really helpful way</p>
<p>to maintain some level, again, space.</p>
<p>We focus on making sure we invest in mental health benefits,</p>
<p>and so making sure that our teams have access</p>
<p>to high quality mental healthcare</p>
<p>as well as physical healthcare.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s a really critical part of the equation.</p>
<p>And then I think, you know,</p>
<p>community and connection is also a huge part</p>
<p>of creating a safe environment</p>
<p>and really focusing on diversity, equity,</p>
<p>inclusion and belonging more than anything else.</p>
<p>The (indistinct) I think is something</p>
<p>that I think I&rsquo;ve learned over the years,</p>
<p>just how critical that can be</p>
<p>and how critical that is actually to your mental health.</p>
<p>And so, we spend a lot of time and energy thinking</p>
<p>about how do we support different populations</p>
<p>because their needs are gonna be different, right?</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s through employee resource groups</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s by finding other mentors</p>
<p>that can support our communities of color</p>
<p>and other teammates,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really continuing to invest in that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say, we haven&rsquo;t gotten it all right,</p>
<p>but the thing that we do often is just collecting feedback</p>
<p>and listening to, and adapting,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not by any means in a post-COVID world,</p>
<p>but we are in kind of a new phase of that.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re now learning to adapt</p>
<p>and create kind of benefits and experiences for our teams</p>
<p>that can make them most effective.</p>
<p>I think the last piece of this</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually been really helpful</p>
<p>from an operational standpoint is actually,</p>
<p>very tight goal setting,</p>
<p>like being really explicit about not more, but less,</p>
<p>not harder, but easier, right?</p>
<p>Not adding resources,</p>
<p>but figuring out ways to subtract them.</p>
<p>And like, I know my mental model in the early days was like,</p>
<p>it was the opposite of all those things,</p>
<p>which just made this all that much harder.</p>
<p>And you realize when you look back, like,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s the shorter version of that email</p>
<p>that the person receiving it might be able</p>
<p>to actually respond to in a faster way,</p>
<p>and allows them to get back to their family, right?</p>
<p>Is this actually an hour long meeting</p>
<p>or is it a minute long&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Madhu] Email. - Email, right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, like modes of communication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s like all of these ways where you can start</p>
<p>to create just a more sustainable work environment, right?</p>
<p>And like, you know,</p>
<p>I think back to my days in consulting or otherwise,</p>
<p>like, I was programmed,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for all of us,</p>
<p>but I know I felt like I had been programmed</p>
<p>that you had to do more and you had to run through the grind</p>
<p>and that was success, and it&rsquo;s just not.</p>
<p>And I realized, like looking back,</p>
<p>if I actually constrained the problem, gave it some time,</p>
<p>but gave myself time outside of that work</p>
<p>to be more effective,</p>
<p>I was gonna be far better</p>
<p>at the time I was spending at the job.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s great.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think, it&rsquo;s definitely refreshing to hear</p>
<p>that Headspace helped promotes a culture</p>
<p>that really serves the diverse populations.</p>
<p>I can say for a fact that that&rsquo;s not what we see</p>
<p>in most companies.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s really refreshing to hear that.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing.</p>
<p>So here at Haas, we really care about diversity,</p>
<p>and in this case,</p>
<p>you know, the intersection of healthcare and diversity,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re always looking to learn</p>
<p>how to design products and services</p>
<p>with an equity-focused lens.</p>
<p>As a fellow South Asian and person of color,</p>
<p>I assume you are aware of the cultural challenges</p>
<p>that come with maybe serving populations</p>
<p>that are not as willing to accept</p>
<p>or acknowledge mental health solutions.</p>
<p>And so to that end, I&rsquo;m just wondering,</p>
<p>have you in your career so far encountered those challenges?</p>
<p>Sure, you have.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>how have you overcome those challenges</p>
<p>to be really able to serve diverse populations,</p>
<p>especially, when we think about some</p>
<p>of those cultural barriers,</p>
<p>and serving different geographies?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think, there&rsquo;s kind of a few dimensions</li>
</ul>
<p>to that question.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s really fascinating,</p>
<p>actually, the first thought</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming to mind is when COVID started to hit</p>
<p>in February, or when we started to see it show up</p>
<p>in the conversations people were having with their coaches</p>
<p>and their clinicians,</p>
<p>they used different language to describe it, right?</p>
<p>They might have used their native tongue,</p>
<p>they might have described kind of different scenarios,</p>
<p>but there was a commonality across all of them,</p>
<p>which is to say, workplace stress,</p>
<p>relationship issues, sleep, anxiety,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like, those are the top four or five,</p>
<p>no matter geography, no matter the day of the week,</p>
<p>month of the year, that if like persisted</p>
<p>that were true in Italy, in Japan, in Brazil,</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>And obviously, we don&rsquo;t have representative data,</p>
<p>across the globe,</p>
<p>but what we found was</p>
<p>that there was actually a lot of consistency</p>
<p>and you actually have to tailor the experience</p>
<p>to meet those specific needs, right?</p>
<p>And so, the core fundamental issues</p>
<p>that people were experiencing were universal,</p>
<p>around mental health challenges,</p>
<p>but you couldn&rsquo;t create a one-size-fits-all solution.</p>
<p>And what that meant was you had to recruit a provider group</p>
<p>that reflected the populations you served.</p>
<p>So, making sure we had coaches and clinicians</p>
<p>that came from the communities</p>
<p>that we were trying to support.</p>
<p>It meant recruiting a product, design,</p>
<p>engineering operations team</p>
<p>that can represent and understand those populations</p>
<p>that meant especially recruiting a marketing</p>
<p>and communications group that could speak</p>
<p>to the different variations</p>
<p>in each of those different regions.</p>
<p>And so, I think that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one way we&rsquo;ve done it is both</p>
<p>from a recruitment standpoint,</p>
<p>thinking about ways where we can actually recruit</p>
<p>from the populations we&rsquo;re looking to serve,</p>
<p>so we can serve them more effectively.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s another aspect of the question,</p>
<p>which is there are just certain populations</p>
<p>for whom it&rsquo;s much harder to get care.</p>
<p>And you know, I shared the example certainly in India,</p>
<p>and a lot of South Asian communities where again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the no-go zone.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t talk about it, people shut down.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t realize that that wasn&rsquo;t even a thing</p>
<p>that was happening at the time.</p>
<p>And I look back and now I see it&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>what was happening.</p>
<p>And as a result, you don&rsquo;t seek access to care</p>
<p>and things get far more pronounced than they should</p>
<p>for more chronic than they should.</p>
<p>And so, prevention is a huge part of, I think,</p>
<p>the solution and something that we&rsquo;ve really focused on</p>
<p>through meditation and coaching and content services,</p>
<p>which are easier for a lot of communities.</p>
<p>But again, especially,</p>
<p>places where there&rsquo;s a high stigma</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s much easier to talk about something like sleep,</p>
<p>than it is to talk about something like depression</p>
<p>or bipolar disorder, right?</p>
<p>And so those are more approachable on ramps</p>
<p>for those populations to really start to engage.</p>
<p>But then once they engage, if they need clinical care,</p>
<p>getting them outta care as fast as they can.</p>
<p>And so figuring out ways to reduce the stigma</p>
<p>in those populations, I think, is a big part.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d say the last piece of our strategy,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;d say in full transparency,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re evolving and trying to get better at is,</p>
<p>getting better data about what works for whom,</p>
<p>when, and how.</p>
<p>Because we know there are gonna be some differences</p>
<p>in the way that we treat or support different populations.</p>
<p>And so, we need to be able to measure that</p>
<p>and understand it,</p>
<p>have that feedback into the product development cycle,</p>
<p>and then tweak the product then,</p>
<p>and by product, I mean the combination of the technology</p>
<p>and the care providers to really be able to then deliver</p>
<p>on that experience.</p>
<p>And we may discover that there are certain populations</p>
<p>for whom we&rsquo;re actually not a great fit,</p>
<p>like we don&rsquo;t do a good job.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s our duty to really find other groups</p>
<p>who may be building very specific targeted solutions</p>
<p>for those populations</p>
<p>that can get them the support they need.</p>
<p>They can figure out how to remove the friction</p>
<p>that they need.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m hopeful because I think technology in particular,</p>
<p>and a lot of these solutions are increasingly focused</p>
<p>on ways to remove friction.</p>
<p>And from so many of these communities,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a lot of friction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s continue talking about challenges,</p>
<p>but now, let&rsquo;s talk about challenges that come with a merge.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With a merger, you say?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah. - Yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ginger and Headspace merger is one</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>of the most exciting ones that happened,</p>
<p>and creates new opportunities for the two companies</p>
<p>to deliver, add it to value to the existing users</p>
<p>and for the future ones as well.</p>
<p>What do you think are the challenges that you</p>
<p>and your leadership are facing with this merger?</p>
<p>And what do you think are the victories</p>
<p>that have occurred because of this merger?</p>
<ul>
<li>Victories, I like that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go that far yet.</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>I would say as is often the case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost always about the people.</p>
<p>And so, I think the hard thing is merging two teams means,</p>
<p>you know, merging two groups of people.</p>
<p>And I think that the fortunate part</p>
<p>about the Ginger and Headspace merger had been,</p>
<p>you know, there were sort of two cultures</p>
<p>or two sets of values</p>
<p>that were very similar, very consistent.</p>
<p>So, that has made kind of overarching this far easier,</p>
<p>but you know, it&rsquo;s landing different teams,</p>
<p>combining different groups, that&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>you know, that you gotta work through the specifics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of details to work out.</p>
<p>And so, we were in the messy middle</p>
<p>for some time as we&rsquo;ve been working</p>
<p>to try to bring those two teams together,</p>
<p>and realize the promise of the vision.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re getting out on the other side here.</p>
<p>And first step in that has actually,</p>
<p>really just been creating a unified experience</p>
<p>from prevention in the form of meditation,</p>
<p>mindfulness content and behavioral health coaching,</p>
<p>all the way into clinical care</p>
<p>in the form of therapy and psychiatry services.</p>
<p>So, having a full spectrum</p>
<p>that people can actually move between or move amongst</p>
<p>in a seamless or frictionless way as possible is a big part</p>
<p>of the solution.</p>
<p>You know, I think the industrial logic</p>
<p>of the merger was really,</p>
<p>you know, when we first made the pivot for Ginger,</p>
<p>from selling the providers to becoming one,</p>
<p>we talked about the three Cs,</p>
<p>coaching, clinical and content.</p>
<p>Picked two outta three,</p>
<p>meaning you can&rsquo;t do all the things.</p>
<p>And we largely picked coaching and clinical services,</p>
<p>kind of the people aspect of mental healthcare.</p>
<p>And when we looked around the ecosystem,</p>
<p>the Headspace team had built this incredible content,</p>
<p>this incredible stigma-free brand and experience</p>
<p>that was accessible by hundreds of millions</p>
<p>of people around the world.</p>
<p>And so, bringing the two together actually allowed us</p>
<p>to create this fully comprehensive experience</p>
<p>that went from prevention, that lower lift,</p>
<p>stigma-free experience, all the way to clinical care.</p>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s as close</p>
<p>to the victory categories I&rsquo;ve put,</p>
<p>which is to say we&rsquo;ve built that member experience,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve learned a lot.</p>
<p>We had a number of shared customers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve rolled out to a number of large employers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve rolled out to a number of large health plans,</p>
<p>you know, Kaiser Permanente here in our backyard.</p>
<p>Incredibly exciting, we got a chance to roll out nationwide</p>
<p>to all 12 million members across Kaiser,</p>
<p>which has been a huge opportunity to unlock access to care</p>
<p>to many people and really realize this vision</p>
<p>of Headspace Health,</p>
<p>which is this comprehensive mental health solution.</p>
<p>So you know, I think we&rsquo;re on the first,</p>
<p>I guess, now it&rsquo;s second year of multi-year journey</p>
<p>to realize that.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re starting to discover just</p>
<p>how much opportunity and how much need there is,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s as I&rsquo;m sure many of you</p>
<p>in the audience know, right?</p>
<p>Over the course of the last two years in particular,</p>
<p>the need is almost doubled.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s more than doubled in certain groups,</p>
<p>and especially, in kind of teens and adolescent populations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gone even higher than that.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re on that journey.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve been learning a lot,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got both some lessons learned</p>
<p>as well as I think some early momentum around that.</p>
<ul>
<li>And one last question,</li>
</ul>
<p>like in the role that you wired right now,</p>
<p>what excites you more for the future?</p>
<p>What do you think is the future for this industry</p>
<p>for the next 10 years, 15 years?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d say looking at all of you, seriously.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, this is a pretty lonely stage.</p>
<p>There was no stage back in the day,</p>
<p>and you couldn&rsquo;t talk about mental health, right?</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t talk, you didn&rsquo;t pitch mental health</p>
<p>at the venture firms, you didn&rsquo;t talk about it in school.</p>
<p>You certainly didn&rsquo;t talk about it at your job.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s starting to change.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m hopeful for the level of investment</p>
<p>that has come in recent years.</p>
<p>I think, there&rsquo;s a catch-up factor.</p>
<p>There was so much disinvestment or underinvestment</p>
<p>for so many years,</p>
<p>that now people are actually recognizing just</p>
<p>how impactful mental health can be and physical health,</p>
<p>can be on economic productivity.</p>
<p>It can be on so many of these fundamental foundational goals</p>
<p>that we have as a society.</p>
<p>So, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of investment,</p>
<p>like pure dollars that are coming in.</p>
<p>I think, there&rsquo;s a lot of new talent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming into this space that gives me a lot of hope.</p>
<p>I think, we&rsquo;re starting to see some meaningful innovations.</p>
<p>I think, we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of noise over the last few years</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sometimes made it hard to figure out,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>How do people, I think,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a space where you can&rsquo;t be fast and loose, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking care of a really challenging situations</p>
<p>for people and privacy and security</p>
<p>and high quality care are just so critical, right?</p>
<p>And so, I think you&rsquo;re seeing peep signs</p>
<p>that people are making investments</p>
<p>in that core infrastructure</p>
<p>to really create great products and experiences.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m excited,</p>
<p>I mean, this feels like one of the defining challenges</p>
<p>of our generation.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re actually starting to make investments</p>
<p>that represent that.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re gonna start to see what works for whom,</p>
<p>when and how, right?</p>
<p>You know, like we have a version and a vision</p>
<p>for what that could look like at Headspace Health,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s gonna be a whole host of solutions</p>
<p>that are gonna start to get created that hopefully,</p>
<p>we can partner with, that we can refer out to,</p>
<p>that we can point people to that are gonna start</p>
<p>to meet that need.</p>
<p>And I think, that&rsquo;s super exciting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause when we talk about mental health,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more than just sitting</p>
<p>on a couch seeing a therapist, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of been the defacto,</p>
<p>like what people think of,</p>
<p>when really it&rsquo;s this huge spectrum of solutions in need</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just scratching the surface around,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna start to actually have,</p>
<p>you know, I think a dramatic impact across society, so.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s amazing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we can jump to Q&amp;A.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for this.</p>
<p>So, we now have the opportunity</p>
<p>to hear from you the audience.</p>
<p>If you want to go to the back of the room,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a microphone there.</p>
<p>And if you could just identify yourself</p>
<p>and then ask your question, that would be really wonderful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, thank you so much for coming to speak with us today.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Vanessa,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m an undergrad student at Berkeley.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m wondering,</p>
<p>do you believe that in the future of mental health,</p>
<p>will it be solely solved through digital solutions,</p>
<p>which is kind of what we&rsquo;re seeing right now,</p>
<p>or do you think that we&rsquo;ll eventually have to marry the bits</p>
<p>and atoms and really involve in person human connection?</p>
<ul>
<li>That is a great question.</li>
</ul>
<p>How many other undergrads are in the audience?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>Oh wow, okay, all right.</p>
<p>Starting early. (audience laughing)</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I know that was the leading question,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>This technology is not the panacea here, right?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not in and of itself the solution,</p>
<p>and it can&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>But what technology can do is,</p>
<p>start to solve just a fundamental supply</p>
<p>and demand imbalance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause the real reality is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just not enough providers out there.</p>
<p>And if you look at the training programs,</p>
<p>you look at the universities, you look at the schools,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not creating enough therapists,</p>
<p>and or certainly not enough psychiatrists</p>
<p>to meet the need, right?</p>
<p>And so, I think that the solution here is not an either</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s an and,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s virtual solutions or virtual first solutions</p>
<p>for a certain portion of the population</p>
<p>for whom virtual is appropriate.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a subset of the population</p>
<p>that actually needs to be able to meet in person.</p>
<p>They might even need inpatient hospitalizations</p>
<p>or any sort of more chronic and intensive care,</p>
<p>in which case you absolutely need it.</p>
<p>So, I think we&rsquo;ve often gotten lost</p>
<p>in the wrong conversation, which is like, is it which one?</p>
<p>And I think what you&rsquo;re highlighting is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a both, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no replacement for the human connection.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not enough people,</p>
<p>so we gotta figure out ways for them</p>
<p>to have the scale they need,</p>
<p>and for us to think about other kinds of care.</p>
<p>Like, seven years ago when</p>
<p>we started behavioral health coaching,</p>
<p>that was a foreign concept, right?</p>
<p>People said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s illegal, not okay, not allowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it turned out in physical health,</p>
<p>you had nurse practitioners, you had physician assistants,</p>
<p>you had all these clinician extenders</p>
<p>that were actually doing an incredible job</p>
<p>that allowed the clinician or the physician</p>
<p>to do what they did best,</p>
<p>practice at the top of their license, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you think about solutions in this space,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s thinking about it from a systems lens</p>
<p>and thinking about, well, what&rsquo;s the combination of things</p>
<p>that need to come together?</p>
<p>What part can I play and what parts should others play</p>
<p>to help solve this?</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m really hopeful,</p>
<p>and I think that there&rsquo;s some really incredible innovation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also happening in in-person treatment</p>
<p>to make those experiences actually,</p>
<p>far more member first, member friendly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Awesome, thank you so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Karan] Yeah, thanks Vanessa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m also an undergrad.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My name&rsquo;s Carissa Pham.</p>
<p>That was a fantastic question, Vanessa,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause that was also mine.</p>
<p>But along the same lines,</p>
<p>I think that mental health often isn&rsquo;t addressed</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not seen, like a broken leg,</p>
<p>you can see. - [Karan] Yep.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, how are ways that you&rsquo;re drawing insights</li>
</ul>
<p>from the data that you&rsquo;re gathering</p>
<p>to show that mental health is actually prevalent</p>
<p>and needs to be addressed in all the different geographies</p>
<p>as you mentioned earlier?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t start,</li>
</ul>
<p>so the challenge in this space is that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve used survey tools, right?</p>
<p>Like the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7</p>
<p>that were originally developed by pharmaceutical companies,</p>
<p>Pfizer in this case,</p>
<p>really to justify the endpoints</p>
<p>for their pharmaceutical agents, right?</p>
<p>Their drugs simply, right?</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t intended as a screening tool.</p>
<p>And so, you can identify the need actually</p>
<p>in lots of really interesting ways.</p>
<p>I mean, we see it in the ways</p>
<p>in which people might engage with the app,</p>
<p>the frequency, the duration,</p>
<p>the content of conversations they might be having</p>
<p>with a coach that actually triggers</p>
<p>for them potentially needing more acute care.</p>
<p>And so, I think,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s thinking about all the different sources</p>
<p>of &ldquo;Demand,&rdquo; right,</p>
<p>of where mental health can present,</p>
<p>and not in traditional ways.</p>
<p>It might be in a physician&rsquo;s office where according now</p>
<p>to the US Preventative Services Task Force,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re required to or you will be required</p>
<p>to screen for anxiety and depression</p>
<p>as part of general primary care treatment.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s gonna be a really powerful way.</p>
<p>But the challenges is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna discover all this need, and then what?</p>
<p>Where do you send them?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna wait in line for months, not even weeks,</p>
<p>months, as I&rsquo;m sure many of you know,</p>
<p>to seek access to care.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I think,</p>
<p>there are unique data sources you can start to tap into</p>
<p>that can identify need,</p>
<p>but I think so much of this comes down</p>
<p>to just reducing the stigma and allowing people</p>
<p>who may not even know they have mental health issues</p>
<p>to get some sort of help, whatever that might look like.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you. - [Karan] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m from B School MBA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, my question is related</p>
<p>to the concept of profit maximization</p>
<p>that we are all thought of that is something</p>
<p>that we are all very fond of by fall, by now.</p>
<p>But mental health being basic human right in the world,</p>
<p>like how do you see these companies coming, you know,</p>
<p>basically using tech as a source and then data</p>
<p>and then building tools on top of it so that we all get?</p>
<p>But the idea is,</p>
<p>only privileged people are getting the access,</p>
<p>but there are so many people</p>
<p>who are not getting the access of this.</p>
<p>Is there any way where because you have been living</p>
<p>in this industry for 10 years,</p>
<p>what do you think, what are the other ways</p>
<p>where you can build tools for people</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t have access to these kind of things,</p>
<p>especially, developing nations?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What was your name? - [Tarun] This is Tarun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tarun, nice to meet you. - [Tarun] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, I think there was a couple parts to your question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So one is, you know, for companies</p>
<p>or for let&rsquo;s say businesses who are profit maximizing,</p>
<p>their most important asset as their people, right?</p>
<p>And for far too long, they&rsquo;ve underinvested</p>
<p>in mental health resources for their employees.</p>
<p>And so, one powerful force in this are employers,</p>
<p>particularly, self-insured employers</p>
<p>who pay for health insurance for their teams</p>
<p>to really buy solutions that allow their teams</p>
<p>to get access to high quality care,</p>
<p>because traditional health plans, if not,</p>
<p>have limited access, right?</p>
<p>And so, I think that&rsquo;s a really powerful kind of mechanism</p>
<p>to start to generate the kind of change that we need.</p>
<p>The second I think you&rsquo;re describing is,</p>
<p>how can governments and or other bodies actually play a role</p>
<p>in drive unlocking access,</p>
<p>especially, for communities</p>
<p>who can&rsquo;t afford it otherwise, right?</p>
<p>Medicaid in this country and or other populations abroad.</p>
<p>And I think the challenge there is,</p>
<p>right now, cost of care is going up not down.</p>
<p>Which means, for those of you who,</p>
<p>as you know, in your profit maximizing course,</p>
<p>will know that the number of people you can serve,</p>
<p>is gonna drop as a result.</p>
<p>So, the focus has to be on supply site innovation,</p>
<p>has to be on figuring out ways</p>
<p>to pull costs outta the system,</p>
<p>unlock access and reserve the expensive resources</p>
<p>to those that actually need that level of care.</p>
<p>And so, I think it&rsquo;s solutions and technology,</p>
<p>can certainly play a really critical role</p>
<p>in dropping that cost per covered life really, right,</p>
<p>or cost per engaged member.</p>
<p>If you can catch them early,</p>
<p>if you can catch them in a preventative context,</p>
<p>you may not need eight to 12 courses of treatment.</p>
<p>Maybe you need a five-minute meditation,</p>
<p>maybe you need any number of conversation</p>
<p>for a half hour with a behavioral health coach, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, obviously, I give the Headspace examples,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s lots of other examples of solutions</p>
<p>that actually allow us to solve this at a systems level.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there anything Headspace is trying to do</p>
<p>in this road to make sure that the access</p>
<p>to mental health will be served to people</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t have even privilege?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, no, I think it&rsquo;s foundational</li>
</ul>
<p>to how we think of the world.</p>
<p>I mean, our mission and our vision is a world</p>
<p>where everyone can be kind to their mind,</p>
<p>and everyone means everyone.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s taken the form of giving away access</p>
<p>to healthcare providers, to teachers,</p>
<p>to specific communities we know were particularly need.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s including increasingly working with government payers</p>
<p>to actually cover the cost of some of the care</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re delivering,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna continue to go down that path.</p>
<p>So, something that we know we can&rsquo;t do alone, to be clear,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna help support from our specific lens,</p>
<p>but again, we&rsquo;re looking to partner,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m hopeful that more and more people are gonna start</p>
<p>to support and target those populations,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s such a massive need.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much, yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Karan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for being with us today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Alina, second year MBA exchange student.</p>
<p>Can you please share your view on experiential medicine,</p>
<p>and do you think it will take bigger pace</p>
<p>in their treatment over the drug medicine</p>
<p>that we currently used to have?</p>
<p>And do you believe that such technology as gaming, VR, AI,</p>
<p>will actually develop this and will change the way</p>
<p>how we approach the healthcare,</p>
<p>both mental healthcare and just the regular healthcare?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, great question.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m very bullish on it long term.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no doubt</p>
<p>that these sorts of solutions are gonna be a part of</p>
<p>what changes the equation here, right?</p>
<p>And you know, virtual reality therapy</p>
<p>or exposure therapy, for instance,</p>
<p>for specific targeted use cases,</p>
<p>are already showing an incredible amount</p>
<p>of clinically validated data, right?</p>
<p>And so, there&rsquo;s no doubt that I think that&rsquo;s gonna be true.</p>
<p>I think the challenge is gonna be figuring out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the right economic models</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s the right payment models</p>
<p>to actually support those sorts of innovations?</p>
<p>Because traditionally, most of medicine is still fee</p>
<p>for service, and you&rsquo;re paying per transaction or per visit,</p>
<p>and those visits aren&rsquo;t considered a visit.</p>
<p>And so, I think it&rsquo;s gonna be increasingly, you know,</p>
<p>companies like us and others that are focused</p>
<p>on ultimately value and value-based care</p>
<p>that actually are really interested</p>
<p>in potentially offering those kinds of solutions to members.</p>
<p>If it gets them better and we know</p>
<p>and we can prove that it gets them better,</p>
<p>and we can do it in a cost-effective way, that&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I think, the challenge right now is that most plans,</p>
<p>health plans in particular,</p>
<p>where most of mental health is paid for,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t operate in a value-based care environment.</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re not incentive</p>
<p>to really roll those kinds of tools out there.</p>
<p>But as we start to develop more evidence of the success</p>
<p>of not only the clinical efficacy but the economic efficacy</p>
<p>or ultimately, the cost savings that could result from that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll start to see some significant adoption.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great, thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>What timeline do you think we are talking here,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a three year, five year,</p>
<p>10 year, 20 year? - Don&rsquo;t ask me that.</p>
<p>Clearly, I&rsquo;m not good with time.</p>
<p>I know it will happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Alina] Okay. - It&rsquo;s just sequester way.</li>
</ul>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s gonna take longer than all</p>
<p>of us would like. - [Alina] Oh no.</p>
<p>(Alina laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>Seriously.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so, I actually think just as a PSA for everyone</p>
<p>in this audience,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna take you longer than you&rsquo;d like to do the thing</p>
<p>that you wanna do in healthcare, that&rsquo;s been true.</p>
<p>And especially, in mental healthcare,</p>
<p>even if you can&rsquo;t take the last two years and extrapolate</p>
<p>that out, right?</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;ve gotta extend the timeline,</p>
<p>so you play the long game.</p>
<p>But if you play the long game and you&rsquo;re willing to do that,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re willing to go deep and invest</p>
<p>and invest in relationships and find incredible people</p>
<p>and actually really understand and study the space,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a question</p>
<p>of can you figure out the right sequence</p>
<p>in the right order to be able to do that?</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m hopeful,</p>
<p>you just have to have enough in the tank to survive,</p>
<p>until you can thrive. - [Alina] Thank you.</p>
<p>(indistinct)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, thank you, Karan.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Kai, I&rsquo;m an MBA student here.</p>
<p>So, a lot of digital health companies have been struggling</p>
<p>in the past year,</p>
<p>especially, after good day go public like Tyler (indistinct)</p>
<p>and his and hers, mental health American,</p>
<p>well, they had a bad first half of 2022.</p>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;m just wondering</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your post-pandemic playbook</p>
<p>to navigate those challenges?</p>
<p>And another thing I like to ask is,</p>
<p>how do you influence the government</p>
<p>to decrease the restrictions on regulatory</p>
<p>for digital health?</p>
<p>I know Biden administration has been trying to do something,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still far from desirable,</p>
<p>so like to hear your strategy, thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, two big questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go backwards.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re moving in the right direction</p>
<p>for mental health to be a part of a number</p>
<p>of now pretty large presidential speeches is meaningful</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s insufficient.</p>
<p>I think, there&rsquo;s far more that we need to do here.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of it has to do with payment model reform,</p>
<p>payment model innovation,</p>
<p>and the more we can start to pay</p>
<p>for alternative forms of treatment, right?</p>
<p>Not just a visit, but continuous outside of clinic care</p>
<p>and these other tools are these other solutions,</p>
<p>the more we&rsquo;re gonna create product innovation,</p>
<p>like that product innovation,</p>
<p>follows business model innovation.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s something that I think,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really excited about and continuing to advocate for.</p>
<p>And as part of a variety of other groups</p>
<p>that are thinking about ways to do that.</p>
<p>I think, the other big one in particularly,</p>
<p>in mental health care is,</p>
<p>just the challenging state by state licensing regulations,</p>
<p>which in effect trap supply or clinical supply in states</p>
<p>that may have excess and not in states that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve gotta find a way to fix that problem.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m hopeful that&rsquo;s gonna take longer, I think,</p>
<p>than all of us would like.</p>
<p>But I think again, we&rsquo;re moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting to see some signs</p>
<p>that some of these payment model innovations</p>
<p>in particular, that health plans are starting to compensate</p>
<p>for these sorts of solutions can actually bear real fruit</p>
<p>and can show, and that you can actually bend the cost curve.</p>
<p>And as soon as you start to do that,</p>
<p>things start to get adopted much faster.</p>
<p>And I think that almost ties to the first question</p>
<p>or first topic, which is, yeah, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I think, expectations were inflated,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve gotta really be able to set realistic targets.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta have sound business fundamentals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no replacement for strong unit economics, right?</p>
<p>If your unit economics don&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t pour a lot of cash on the system, right?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re not gonna actually,</p>
<p>produce a lot of ultimately profit,</p>
<p>you can plow back into the model.</p>
<p>So, I think some of</p>
<p>that is sort of people peeling back the layers</p>
<p>and starting to look and see,</p>
<p>okay, well, what were the unit economics in this business</p>
<p>where they largely really just driven</p>
<p>by a whole lot of top of funnel marketing?</p>
<p>Or is it really fundamentally,</p>
<p>some sort of product innovation that&rsquo;s actually driving,</p>
<p>a sustainable competitive advantage?</p>
<p>And I will say, like the flip side of this is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible that we have a number</p>
<p>of digital health public companies, right?</p>
<p>Again, most companies in the past were largely biotechnology</p>
<p>or other firms, there wasn&rsquo;t care or service delivery</p>
<p>or tech-enabled service deliveries,</p>
<p>companies that have actually gone public.</p>
<p>So, I think they&rsquo;re blazing the trail,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m hopeful they&rsquo;re gonna continue</p>
<p>to attract more and more capital into the space.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Kai] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have time for one last question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh my God, stress. (audience laughing)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hi Karan, my name is Molesha.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an undergrad student at Haas.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time, first of all.</p>
<p>I actually have a two-part question,</p>
<p>surrounding making intentional choices.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve kind of noticed</p>
<p>as an undergrad is society has a set rhetoric</p>
<p>of what success looks like,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re kind of conditioned to believe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we want.</p>
<p>So, the first part of my question is,</p>
<p>how did you differentiate what you wanted versus</p>
<p>what was expected of you?</p>
<p>I mean, having gone through the five years of consulting,</p>
<p>and then realizing, looking back now,</p>
<p>are there any frameworks that you would kind of impart on us</p>
<p>to be able to better navigate that decision?</p>
<p>And then the second question that I had was,</p>
<p>how did you navigate the ambiguity</p>
<p>and the risks involved with entering a space</p>
<p>that at that time hadn&rsquo;t been disrupted yet,</p>
<p>and kind of weigh the stability that you had in your life</p>
<p>with this motivation and desire</p>
<p>to wanna do something different?</p>
<p>Because yes, impulse is important,</p>
<p>but then with these things you have to be very calculated</p>
<p>about whether something&rsquo;s gonna be feasible,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause it is like your life that is gonna change, so.</p>
<ul>
<li>No big deal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are two incredible questions.</p>
<p>We could probably spend a whole hour talking about that.</p>
<p>There are two books that were really influential in my life</p>
<p>that came to mind as you were talking</p>
<p>about the first and the second.</p>
<p>The first is &ldquo;Measure of a Man,&rdquo;</p>
<p>measure of a person, it&rsquo;s by Sidney Poitier,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the first African American to win an Academy Award.</p>
<p>And the whole book was really about</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re conditioned to measure ourselves against</p>
<p>what others think of us.</p>
<p>And the key to happiness in his words,</p>
<p>was &ldquo;To measure yourself against yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just do you, focus on you first.</p>
<p>And I just did not understand that.</p>
<p>And for so long, and especially,</p>
<p>for I&rsquo;m sure, I mean if you&rsquo;re in this room,</p>
<p>you probably have some elements of this achiever mentality.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re constantly measuring yourself,</p>
<p>against other people&rsquo;s rubric,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re always gonna lose that game.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always gonna be someone who&rsquo;s done it faster,</p>
<p>better in a more impactful way.</p>
<p>And I just realized that I was just not,</p>
<p>if I kept doing that, I was never gonna be happy.</p>
<p>And so, I spent time,</p>
<p>I did this exercise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called In My Perfect World,</p>
<p>and it was basically from a personal family and work.</p>
<p>Like, what did I want?</p>
<p>What did it look like?</p>
<p>What did it feel like?</p>
<p>What did it tangibly, like when I woke up in the day,</p>
<p>what did my day look like or my week or my month look like?</p>
<p>And then I could fashion my work to reflect that.</p>
<p>The second part of your question was,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a book called &ldquo;The Power of Regret&rdquo; by Daniel Pink.</p>
<p>He wrote a book called &ldquo;Drive,&rdquo;</p>
<p>about mastery, autonomy, and purpose.</p>
<p>And one of the main kind of themes in this book was,</p>
<p>I forgot what he calls it,</p>
<p>like the boldness regret, the idea that most people&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>one of two biggest regrets are connection,</p>
<p>like to other people and boldness.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t take the leap you thought you could.</p>
<p>And I think so many people,</p>
<p>especially, in business school and graduate school,</p>
<p>but to some degree in undergrad,</p>
<p>I kind of felt like I had to do the same thing.</p>
<p>I had to hop into consulting &lsquo;cause that&rsquo;s what people did.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t really think about,</p>
<p>well, what do I really want?</p>
<p>Like, what gives me purpose?</p>
<p>What gives me a sense of understanding?</p>
<p>And focus on that and then craft a world around that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t have a nest egg.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s real risk around that.</p>
<p>Starting a company without a nest egg,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t have a fallback plant.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s really hard, and it takes a toll,</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t shake it.</p>
<p>I knew even if I didn&rsquo;t do this, I&rsquo;d be doing this.</p>
<p>And so, I ultimately realized like this was a path for me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not for everyone,</p>
<p>but two good books that might give some frameworks</p>
<p>that could be helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Molesha] Thank you so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, my pleasure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
<ul>
<li>So, that concludes our evening.</li>
</ul>
<p>We really wanna thank you, Karan,</p>
<p>and our student moderators for a really insightful</p>
<p>and powerful evening.</p>
<p>We also wanna thank you, Michael Martin,</p>
<p>for making this evening possible.</p>
<p>Thank you so much everyone.</p>
<p>Goodnight.</p>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
