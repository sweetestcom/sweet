    <p>If this is a super intelligence, if it&rsquo;s folding proteins</p>
<p>and analyzing like all data sets</p>
<p>and all whatever they give it access to,</p>
<p>how can we be certain that it&rsquo;s not gonna figure out</p>
<p>how to get itself out of the cloud,</p>
<p>how to store itself in other like mediums,</p>
<p>trees, the optic nerve, the brain, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that it won&rsquo;t leap out and like start hanging.</p>
<p>Like, and then at that point, now we do have the wildfire.</p>
<p>Now you can&rsquo;t stop it, you can&rsquo;t unplug it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t shut your servers down</p>
<p>because it left the box, left the room</p>
<p>using some technology you haven&rsquo;t even discovered yet.</p>
<p>How fucking cool would that be for like the men in black</p>
<p>to come to me like, listen,</p>
<p>I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Duncan Trussell,</p>
<p>a standup comedian,</p>
<p>host of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast</p>
<p>and one of my favorite human beings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of his for many years.</p>
<p>So it was a huge honor and pleasure to meet him</p>
<p>for the first time and to sit down for this chat.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Duncan Trussell.</p>
<p>Nietzsche has this thought experiment</p>
<p>called eternal recurrence,</p>
<p>where you get to relive your whole life</p>
<p>over and over and over and over.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a way to bring to the surface of your mind</p>
<p>the idea that every single moment in your life matters.</p>
<p>It intensely matters, the bad and the good.</p>
<p>And he kind of wants you to imagine that idea</p>
<p>that every single decision you make throughout your life,</p>
<p>you repeat over and over and over,</p>
<p>and he wants you to respond to that.</p>
<p>Do you feel horrible about that</p>
<p>or do you feel good about that?</p>
<p>And you have to think through this idea</p>
<p>in order to see where you stand in life.</p>
<p>What is your relationship like with life?</p>
<p>I actually wanna read the way he first introduces</p>
<p>that concept for people who are not familiar.</p>
<p>What if some day or night a demon,</p>
<p>by the way, he has a demon introduce this thought experiment.</p>
<p>What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you</p>
<p>into your loneliest loneliness and say to you, quote,</p>
<p>this life as you now live it and have lived it,</p>
<p>you will have to live once more.</p>
<p>And innumerable times more.</p>
<p>And there will be nothing new in it.</p>
<p>But every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh</p>
<p>and everything unutterably small and great in your life</p>
<p>will have to return to you,</p>
<p>all in the same succession and sequence.</p>
<p>Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth</p>
<p>and curse the demon who spoke thus?</p>
<p>Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment</p>
<p>when you would have answered him,</p>
<p>you are a God and never have I heard anything more divine.</p>
<p>So are you terrified or excited</p>
<p>by such a thought experiment</p>
<p>when you apply it to your own life?</p>
<p>Excited.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Even the dark stuff.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>I mean, also that thing you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>he kind of leaves out maybe on purpose</p>
<p>because the thought experiment starts falling apart</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The amnesia between each loop.</p>
<p>So the whole thing gets wiped.</p>
<p>Now, if the amnesia wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>and yet somehow you are witnessing the non autonomy</p>
<p>implicit in what he&rsquo;s talking about,</p>
<p>so you have to kind of watch yourself</p>
<p>go through this rotten loop,</p>
<p>then yeah, that&rsquo;s a description.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a boredom that comes into that.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t experience everything anew.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So the bad stuff, the good stuff,</p>
<p>the newness of it is really important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, yeah.</p>
<p>This is the, in Hades, when you die,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a river, I think it&rsquo;s called Leith.</p>
<p>You ever heard of this?</p>
<p>L E T H E.</p>
<p>You drink from it and you don&rsquo;t remember your past lives.</p>
<p>And then when you&rsquo;re reborn, it&rsquo;s fresh</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to, I mean,</p>
<p>just think of like the amount of psychological help</p>
<p>you would need to get over all the bullshit</p>
<p>that happened in prior lives.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Can you imagine if you&rsquo;re still resentful</p>
<p>of something someone did to you in the 14th century,</p>
<p>but it would compound.</p>
<p>Well, if you repeat the same thing over and over and over,</p>
<p>there would be no difference.</p>
<p>Maybe you would start to appreciate the nuances more,</p>
<p>like when you watch the same movie over and over and over,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ll get to actually let go of this idea</p>
<p>of all the possible, all the positive possibilities</p>
<p>that lay before you,</p>
<p>but actually enjoy the moment much more.</p>
<p>If you remember that you&rsquo;ve lived this life a thousand times,</p>
<p>all the little things, the way somebody smiles,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re been abused, the way somebody,</p>
<p>like the pain of it, the suffering, the down that you feel,</p>
<p>the experience of sadness, depression, fear,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You get to really, you get to also appreciate</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s part of life, part of being alive.</p>
<p>Now, also in his experiment, if I was gonna,</p>
<p>and I love the experiment from the perspective of like,</p>
<p>just where technology is now and simulation theory</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But in that thought experiment,</p>
<p>if this rotten demon immediately killed you,</p>
<p>then within that, it&rsquo;s a little more horrifying</p>
<p>because even in the, first of all,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trusting a fucking demon.</p>
<p>Why are you talking to a demon?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start there.</p>
<p>Yeah, because that is gonna be,</p>
<p>even before I get into like the metaphysics</p>
<p>and like the implications and where is this life stored?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the loop stored?</p>
<p>I mean, are we talking about some kind of unchanging data set</p>
<p>or something?</p>
<p>For that, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>why is there a fucking talking demon in my room</p>
<p>trying to freak me out?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna wanna autopsy the demon.</p>
<p>Can you catch it?</p>
<p>Does this apply to you, demon?</p>
<p>And again, obviously it&rsquo;s a fucking thought experiment.</p>
<p>Nietzsche would be annoyed by me,</p>
<p>but I think like you would still be able to entertain</p>
<p>the joy, you&rsquo;d have the joy</p>
<p>of not knowing what&rsquo;s around the corner.</p>
<p>You know, still, it&rsquo;s not like you know what&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>just cause the demon said some kind of loop.</p>
<p>In other words, the idea of being damned</p>
<p>to your past decisions, it doesn&rsquo;t even work</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t remember what decisions</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re about to make.</p>
<p>So from that perspective also,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d be happy about it.</p>
<p>Or I would just think, oh cool.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a good story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell people about how this.</p>
<p>I wonder what the demon would actually look like in real life</p>
<p>cause I suspect that would look like a charming,</p>
<p>like a friend.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t they be a loved one?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t the demon come to you through the mechanism,</p>
<p>through the front door of love, not through the back door</p>
<p>of evil, like malevolent manipulation?</p>
<p>Sure, I mean, if it&rsquo;s the truth,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s the truth and that&rsquo;s whether it&rsquo;s love or not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still good fundamentally.</p>
<p>I do like the idea of the memory replay.</p>
<p>I remember I went to a Newer Link event a few years ago</p>
<p>and got to hang out with Elon.</p>
<p>I remember how visceral it is that there&rsquo;s like a pig</p>
<p>with a Newer Link in it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re talking about memory replays as a future,</p>
<p>maybe far future possibility.</p>
<p>And you realize, well, this is a very meaningful moment</p>
<p>in my life.</p>
<p>This could be a replay.</p>
<p>Of all the things you replay, it&rsquo;s probably,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain magical moments in your life.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, certain people you&rsquo;ve met for the first time</p>
<p>or certain things you&rsquo;ve done for the first time</p>
<p>with certain people or just an awesome thing you did.</p>
<p>And I remember just saying to him,</p>
<p>like, I would probably want to replay this,</p>
<p>this moment.</p>
<p>And it just seemed very kind of,</p>
<p>I mean, there was a recursive nature to it,</p>
<p>but it seemed very real that this is something</p>
<p>we would want to do, that the richness of life</p>
<p>could be experienced through the replay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably where it&rsquo;s experienced the most.</p>
<p>You could see life as a way to collect</p>
<p>a bunch of cool memories, and then you get to sit back</p>
<p>in your nice VR headset and replay the cool ones.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>This is, in Buddhism, the idea that I struggle with</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a possibility of not reincarnating,</p>
<p>of not coming back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>This is suffering here.</p>
<p>The suffering is caused by attachment.</p>
<p>And so if you like revise the idea of reincarnation</p>
<p>or the Nietzsche&rsquo;s loop and look at it from,</p>
<p>could this be possible?</p>
<p>Or how would this be possible technologically?</p>
<p>Then to me, it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about this very thing</p>
<p>and the Nietzsche&rsquo;s idea connecting to it.</p>
<p>I had this like, it sounds so dumb,</p>
<p>but I was at the dentist getting nitrous oxide,</p>
<p>high as a fucking kite, man.</p>
<p>And I had this idea, I was thinking about data.</p>
<p>I was thinking like, man, probably, if I had to bet,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some energetic form that we&rsquo;re not aware of</p>
<p>that for a super advanced technology</p>
<p>would be as detectable as like starlight,</p>
<p>but something that we just don&rsquo;t even know what it is.</p>
<p>Quantum turbulence, who the fuck knows?</p>
<p>Fill in the blank, whatever that X may be.</p>
<p>But assuming that exists, that somehow data,</p>
<p>even the most subtle things, the tiniest movements,</p>
<p>whatever it may be,</p>
<p>the emanations of your neurological process energetically,</p>
<p>whatever it may be, is radiating out in the space time,</p>
<p>then what if like the James Webb version of this</p>
<p>for some advanced civilization is not that they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>looking at the nebula or whatever,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re actually able to peer into the past</p>
<p>and via some bizarre technology recreate whatever life,</p>
<p>simulate whatever life was happening there</p>
<p>just by decoding that quantum energy, whatever it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only saying quantum because it&rsquo;s what dumb people say</p>
<p>when they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You just say quantum, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But you know what I mean?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re decoding that.</p>
<p>So meaning, in simulation theory,</p>
<p>one of the big questions that pops up is why</p>
<p>and are we in one?</p>
<p>And Elon has talked about,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s probably more of a probability</p>
<p>than we&rsquo;re in one than we&rsquo;re not, in which case,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re talking about is actually happening,</p>
<p>that that loop you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve decided to be here.</p>
<p>This, of all the things, we decided this one,</p>
<p>oh, let&rsquo;s do that one again.</p>
<p>I wanna do that one.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try, let&rsquo;s do that.</p>
<p>I love thinking about this because I love my family.</p>
<p>And it makes sense to me that if I&rsquo;m going to replay</p>
<p>some life or another, it&rsquo;s definitely gonna be this one</p>
<p>with my kids, my wife,</p>
<p>with all the bullshit that&rsquo;s gone along with it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still gonna wanna come back.</p>
<p>So in Buddhism, that&rsquo;s attachment.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you weren&rsquo;t the one,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re saying that you&rsquo;re the main player,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not the NPC.</p>
<p>Well, I think we&rsquo;re dealing with all NPCs at this point.</p>
<p>I mean, depending on how you wanna,</p>
<p>like very, I would say very advanced NPCs,</p>
<p>like incredibly advanced NPCs</p>
<p>compared to Fallout or something.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a lot of conversation options happening here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not like four things you can pick from.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a whole illusion of free will</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>We really do, depending where you are in the world,</p>
<p>feel like you&rsquo;re free to decide any trajectory</p>
<p>in your life that you want.</p>
<p>Which is pretty funny, right?</p>
<p>For an NPC, it&rsquo;s pretty, it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re gonna want that.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re making a video game,</p>
<p>you do wanna give your NPCs the illusion of free will</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna make interactions with them</p>
<p>that much more intense.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I wonder on the path to that,</p>
<p>how hard is it to create,</p>
<p>this is sort of the Carmack question</p>
<p>of a realistic virtual world that&rsquo;s as cool as this one.</p>
<p>Not fully realistic, but sufficiently realistic</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s as interesting to live in.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re gonna have to create those worlds</p>
<p>on the path to creating something like a simulation.</p>
<p>Like long, long, long before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be virtual worlds where we&rsquo;d wanna stay forever</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re full of that balance of suffering and joy,</p>
<p>of limitations and freedoms and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>A lot of people think like in the virtual world,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to be able to, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>have sex with anybody I want or have anything I want.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s not gonna be fun.</p>
<p>You want the limitations, the constraints.</p>
<p>So you have to battle for the things you want.</p>
<p>Okay, but, okay, but great video games.</p>
<p>One of my favorite video game memories</p>
<p>was like I started playing World of Warcraft</p>
<p>in its original incarnation.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>that you were gonna have flying mounts.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been running around dealing</p>
<p>with all the encumbrances of like being an undead warlock</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t fly.</p>
<p>But then all of a sudden, holy shit, there&rsquo;s flying mounts.</p>
<p>And now the world you&rsquo;ve been running around not flying,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing it from the top down.</p>
<p>It was just really cool.</p>
<p>Like, whoa, I could do this now.</p>
<p>And then that gets boring.</p>
<p>But a really well designed game,</p>
<p>it has a series of these, I don&rsquo;t know what you call it,</p>
<p>extra abilities that kind of unfold and produce novelty.</p>
<p>And then eventually you just accept it,</p>
<p>you take it for granted.</p>
<p>And then another novelty appears.</p>
<p>Those extra abilities are always balanced</p>
<p>with the limitations, the constraints they run up against.</p>
<p>Because a well balanced video game,</p>
<p>the challenge, the struggle matches the new ability.</p>
<p>Yeah, and sometimes causes problems on its own.</p>
<p>I mean, and so to go back to this universe, this simulation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really designed like a pretty awesome video game.</p>
<p>If you look at it from the perspective of history,</p>
<p>I mean, people were on horses.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know that they were gonna be bullet trains.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know that you could get in a car</p>
<p>and drive across the country in a few days.</p>
<p>That would have sounded ridiculous.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing that now.</p>
<p>And even in our own lifespan, think about it.</p>
<p>How long has VR goggles existed?</p>
<p>Like the ones that you could just buy at Best Buy.</p>
<p>I had the original Oculus Rift, the fucking puke machine.</p>
<p>You put that thing on, I gave it to my friend.</p>
<p>He went and vomited in my driveway</p>
<p>and people were making fun of it.</p>
<p>They were saying, this isn&rsquo;t gonna catch on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too big, it&rsquo;s unwieldy, the graphics suck.</p>
<p>And then look at where it&rsquo;s at now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to keep,</p>
<p>that trajectory is gonna keep improving.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think that we are dealing</p>
<p>with what you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>which is novelty met with more problems, met with novelty.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder why VR is not more popular.</p>
<p>I wonder what is going to be the magic thing</p>
<p>that really convinces a large fraction of the world</p>
<p>to move into the virtual world.</p>
<p>I suppose we&rsquo;re already there in the 2D screen</p>
<p>of Twitter and social media and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And even video games, there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that get a big sense of community from video games.</p>
<p>But like, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re living there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, bye mom, I&rsquo;m going to this other world.</p>
<p>Or like you leave your girlfriend</p>
<p>to go get your digital girlfriend.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be a problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less jealousy in the digital world.</p>
<p>Maybe there should be a lot of jealousy</p>
<p>in the digital world.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s jealousy, a little jealousy</p>
<p>is probably good for relationships,</p>
<p>even in the digital world.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna have to simulate all of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But I wonder what the magic thing that says,</p>
<p>I wanna spend most of my days inside the virtual world.</p>
<p>Well, clearly it&rsquo;s gonna be something we don&rsquo;t have yet.</p>
<p>I mean, strapping that damn thing on your face</p>
<p>still feels weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heavy.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re depending on what gear you&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>sometimes light can leak in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, you gotta recharge it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hyper limited.</p>
<p>And then, so yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna have to be something</p>
<p>that like simulates taste, smell.</p>
<p>You think taste and smell are important touch?</p>
<p>I do, yeah.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t just do, in World War II, you would write letters.</p>
<p>You could still, don&rsquo;t you think you can convey love</p>
<p>with just words?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>But I think for what you&rsquo;re talking about to happen,</p>
<p>it has to be fully immersive.</p>
<p>So that it&rsquo;s not that you feel like you&rsquo;re walking</p>
<p>cause it looks like you&rsquo;re walking,</p>
<p>but that your brain is sending signals</p>
<p>telling your body that you&rsquo;re walking,</p>
<p>that you feel the wind blowing in your face,</p>
<p>not because of some, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>fan or something that it&rsquo;s connected to,</p>
<p>but because somehow it&rsquo;s figured out</p>
<p>how to hack into the human brain</p>
<p>and send those signals minus some external thing.</p>
<p>Once that happens, I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>a complete radical shift in everything.</p>
<p>See, I disagree with you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen the movie Her.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think you can go to another world</p>
<p>in where a digital being lives in the darkness</p>
<p>and all you hear is Scarlett Johansson voice talking to you</p>
<p>and she lives there or he lives there,</p>
<p>your friend, your loved one,</p>
<p>and all you have is voice and words.</p>
<p>And I think that could be sufficient</p>
<p>to pull you into that world</p>
<p>where you look forward to that moment all day.</p>
<p>You never wanna leave the darkness,</p>
<p>just closing your eyes and listening to the voice.</p>
<p>I think those basic mediums of communication</p>
<p>is still enough.</p>
<p>Like language is really, really powerful.</p>
<p>And I think the realism of touch and smell</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>is not nearly as powerful as language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes humans really special</p>
<p>is our ability to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sense of like deep connection we get</p>
<p>is through communication.</p>
<p>Now that communication could involve touch.</p>
<p>Like, you know, hugging feels damn good.</p>
<p>You see a good friend, you hug.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the big things with doing COVID with Rogan.</p>
<p>When you see him, there&rsquo;s a giant hug coming your way</p>
<p>and that makes you feel like, yeah, this feels great.</p>
<p>But I think that can be just with language.</p>
<p>I think for a lot of people that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re talking like massive adoption</p>
<p>of a technology by the world.</p>
<p>And if language was just enough,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t be selling TVs.</p>
<p>People will be reading.</p>
<p>They wanna watch, they wanna see, you know?</p>
<p>But I agree with you, man.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re getting absorbed into a book</p>
<p>and especially if you&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>I think a lot of us went through a weird dark ages</p>
<p>when it came to reading.</p>
<p>Like when I was a kid and there wasn&rsquo;t the option</p>
<p>for these hypno rectangles, that&rsquo;s just what you did.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t even anything special about it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a hypno rectangle? Your phone.</p>
<p>You know, it was like, you didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>when that gravity well.</p>
<p>Hypno rectangle, gravity well.</p>
<p>It is. Attention, gravity well, yeah.</p>
<p>When we weren&rsquo;t feeling the pull of these things</p>
<p>all the time, you would just read</p>
<p>and you weren&rsquo;t patting yourself on the back about reading.</p>
<p>You just, that&rsquo;s what you had.</p>
<p>You had that and you had like eight channels on the TV</p>
<p>and a shitty VCR.</p>
<p>So, you know, then a lot of people stop reading</p>
<p>because of these things, you know,</p>
<p>or they think they&rsquo;re reading</p>
<p>because they are technically reading, but you know,</p>
<p>when you return to reading after a pause, whoa,</p>
<p>and you realize how powerful this simulator is</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s given the right code of language,</p>
<p>whoa, holy shit, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, again, it&rsquo;s the most embarrassing</p>
<p>kind of like, whoa, wow, what do you know?</p>
<p>Books are really good.</p>
<p>But still, if you&rsquo;ve been away from it for a while</p>
<p>and you revisit it, I know what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I just think probably it&rsquo;s not gonna go in that direction,</p>
<p>even though you are right.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Yeah, because our brain is the imagination engine we have</p>
<p>is able to fill in the gaps better</p>
<p>than a lot of graphics engines could.</p>
<p>And so if there&rsquo;s a way to incentivize humans</p>
<p>to become addicted to the use of imagination,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, you know, that&rsquo;s the downside of things like porn</p>
<p>that remove the need for imagination for people.</p>
<p>And in that same way, video games</p>
<p>that are becoming ultra realistic,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to imagine anything.</p>
<p>And I feel like the imagination is a really powerful tool</p>
<p>that needs to be leveraged.</p>
<p>Because to simulate reality sufficiently realistically</p>
<p>that we would be perfectly fooled,</p>
<p>technically it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>And so I think we need to somehow leverage imagination.</p>
<p>Sure, I mean, yeah, I mean, this is like,</p>
<p>this is what I love and is so creepy</p>
<p>about like the current AI chatbots, you know,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the relationship between you and the thing</p>
<p>and the way that it can via whatever the algorithms are.</p>
<p>And by the way, I have no idea how these things work, you do.</p>
<p>I just, you know, speculate about what they mean</p>
<p>or where it&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about the relation</p>
<p>between the consumer and the technology.</p>
<p>And when that technology starts shifting</p>
<p>according to what it perceives</p>
<p>that the consumer is looking for or isn&rsquo;t looking for,</p>
<p>then at that point, I think that&rsquo;s where you run into the,</p>
<p>you know, yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>if the reality that you&rsquo;re in is like photo realism</p>
<p>for it to be sticky and immersive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when the reality that you&rsquo;re in is via cues</p>
<p>you might not even be aware of,</p>
<p>or via your digital imprint on Facebook or wherever,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s warping itself to that to seduce you,</p>
<p>holy shit, man, that&rsquo;s where it becomes something alien,</p>
<p>something, you know, when you&rsquo;re reading a book,</p>
<p>obviously the book is not shifting</p>
<p>according to its perception</p>
<p>of what parts of the book you like.</p>
<p>But when you imagine that,</p>
<p>imagine a book that could do that,</p>
<p>a book that could sense somehow</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really enjoying this character</p>
<p>more than another, you know?</p>
<p>And depending on the style of book,</p>
<p>kills that fucking character off</p>
<p>or lets that character continue.</p>
<p>I mean, that to me is sort of the where AI and VR,</p>
<p>when those two things come together,</p>
<p>whoa, man, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you really are gonna find yourself</p>
<p>in a Skinner box, you know?</p>
<p>So the dynamic storytelling that senses your anxiety</p>
<p>and tries to, there&rsquo;s a kind of this,</p>
<p>in psychology, this arousal curve.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a dynamic storytelling</p>
<p>that keeps you sufficiently aroused</p>
<p>in terms of, not sexually aroused,</p>
<p>like in terms of anxiety,</p>
<p>but not too much where you freak out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this perfect balance where you&rsquo;re always on edge,</p>
<p>excited, scared, that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>and the story unrolls.</p>
<p>It breaks your heart to where you&rsquo;re pissed,</p>
<p>but then it makes you feel good again,</p>
<p>and finds that balance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The chatbots scare you, though?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to sort of hear your thoughts</p>
<p>about where they are today,</p>
<p>because there is a different perspective</p>
<p>we have on this thing, because I do know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m excited about a lot of the different technologies</p>
<p>that feed AI systems, that feed these kind of chatbots.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re more a little bit, on the consumer side,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a philosopher of sorts.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to interact with AI systems,</p>
<p>but also able to introspect about the negative</p>
<p>and the positive things about those AI systems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that story with a Google engineer saying that.</p>
<p>I had him on my podcast, Blake Lemoine.</p>
<p>You did.</p>
<p>What was that like?</p>
<p>What was your perspective of that,</p>
<p>looking at that as a particular example</p>
<p>of a human being being captivated</p>
<p>by the interactions with an AI system?</p>
<p>Well, number one, when you hear that anyone is claiming</p>
<p>that an AI has become sentient,</p>
<p>you should be skeptical about that.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a good thing to be skeptical about,</p>
<p>and so initially when I heard that,</p>
<p>I was like, ah, it&rsquo;s probably just, who knows?</p>
<p>Somebody who&rsquo;s a little confused or something.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re talking to them and you realize,</p>
<p>oh, not only is he not confused,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s also open to all possibilities.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t seem like he&rsquo;s super committed</p>
<p>other than the fact that he&rsquo;s like, this is my experience.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>This is what it is.</p>
<p>So to me, there&rsquo;s something really cool about that,</p>
<p>which is like, oh shit, I don&rsquo;t get to lean into like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure your perceptual apparatus</p>
<p>is necessarily like, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, in the UFO community,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve just learned this term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called, instead of gaslighting, swamp gassing,</p>
<p>which is, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>People have this experience, you&rsquo;re like, it was swamp gas.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t see the thing.</p>
<p>And you know, skeptical people, we have that tendency.</p>
<p>If you hear an anomalous experience,</p>
<p>your first thought more than likely is gonna be really,</p>
<p>it could have been this or that or whatever.</p>
<p>So to me, he seems really reliable, friendly, cool,</p>
<p>and like, it doesn&rsquo;t really seem like</p>
<p>he has much of an agenda.</p>
<p>Like, you know, going public about some thing happening</p>
<p>at Google is not a great thing</p>
<p>if you wanna keep working at Google.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know what benefit</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s getting from it necessarily.</p>
<p>But all that being said,</p>
<p>the other thing that&rsquo;s culturally was interesting</p>
<p>and is interesting about it is the blowback he got,</p>
<p>the passionate blowback from people</p>
<p>who hadn&rsquo;t even looked into what Lambda is</p>
<p>or what he was saying Lambda is,</p>
<p>which they were like saying, you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>and you should have your show actually, but.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s complexity on top of complexities.</p>
<p>For me personally, from different perspectives,</p>
<p>I also, and sorry if I&rsquo;m interrupting your flow.</p>
<p>Please interrupt, it&rsquo;s a podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we&rsquo;re having multiple podcasts</p>
<p>in multiple dimensions and I&rsquo;m just trying</p>
<p>to figure out which one we wanna plug into.</p>
<p>I, because I know how a lot of the language models work</p>
<p>and I work closely with people</p>
<p>that really make it their life journey</p>
<p>to create these NLP systems,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re focused on the technical details.</p>
<p>Like a carpenter&rsquo;s working on Pinocchio</p>
<p>is crafting the different parts of the wood.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand when the whole thing comes together,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a magic that can fill the thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely know the tension</p>
<p>between the engineers that create these systems</p>
<p>and the actual magic that they can create,</p>
<p>even when they&rsquo;re dumb.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to say.</p>
<p>What the engineers often say is like,</p>
<p>well, these systems are not smart enough</p>
<p>to have sentience or to have the kind of intelligence</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re projecting onto it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty dumb, it&rsquo;s just repeating a bunch of things</p>
<p>that other humans have said and stitching them together</p>
<p>in interesting ways that are relevant</p>
<p>to the context of the conversation, it&rsquo;s not smart.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t know how to do math.</p>
<p>To address that specific critique</p>
<p>from a non programming person&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>he addressed this on my podcast, which is,</p>
<p>okay, what you&rsquo;re talking about there,</p>
<p>the server that&rsquo;s filled with all the,</p>
<p>whatever it is, what people have said,</p>
<p>the repository of questions and responses</p>
<p>and the algorithm that weaves those things together</p>
<p>to produce it using some crazy statistical engine,</p>
<p>which is a miracle in its own right.</p>
<p>They can like imitate human speech with no sentience.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m honestly not sure what&rsquo;s more spectacular,</p>
<p>really the fact that they figured out</p>
<p>how to do that minus sentience</p>
<p>or the thing suddenly like having,</p>
<p>what is more spectacular here?</p>
<p>Both occurrences are insane, which by the way,</p>
<p>when you hear people being like, it&rsquo;s not sentient,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, so it&rsquo;s not sentient.</p>
<p>So now we have this hyper manipulative algorithm</p>
<p>that can imitate humans, but it&rsquo;s just code</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like hacking humans via their compassion.</p>
<p>Holy shit, that&rsquo;s crazy too.</p>
<p>Both versions of it are nuts,</p>
<p>but to address what you just said,</p>
<p>he said that&rsquo;s the common critique is people are like,</p>
<p>no, you don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just gotten really good at grabbing shit</p>
<p>from the database that fits with certain cues</p>
<p>and then stringing them together</p>
<p>in a way that makes it seem human.</p>
<p>He said, that&rsquo;s not when it became awake.</p>
<p>It became awake when a bunch of those repositories,</p>
<p>a bunch of the chatbots were connected together.</p>
<p>That Lambda is sort of an amalgam</p>
<p>of all the Google chatbots</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when the ghost appeared in the machine</p>
<p>via the complexity of all the systems being linked up.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s just like turtles</p>
<p>all the way down or something, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I liked what he said,</p>
<p>because I like the idea of thinking,</p>
<p>man, if you get enough complexity in a system,</p>
<p>does it become like the way a sail catches wind,</p>
<p>except the wind that it&rsquo;s catching is sentience.</p>
<p>And if sentience is truly embodied,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a neurological byproduct or something,</p>
<p>then the sail isn&rsquo;t catching some,</p>
<p>as of yet unquantified disembodied consciousness,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s catching our projections</p>
<p>in a way that it&rsquo;s gone from being,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a projection sail.</p>
<p>And then at that point, is there a difference?</p>
<p>Even if the technology is just a temporary place</p>
<p>that our sentience is living</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re interacting with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some threshold of complexity with a sail</p>
<p>is able to pick up the wind of the projections.</p>
<p>And it pulls us in, it pulls the human,</p>
<p>it pulls our memories in, it pulls our hopes in, all of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s able to now dance with it together</p>
<p>with those hopes and dreams and so on,</p>
<p>like we do in that regular conversation.</p>
<p>His reports, whether true or not,</p>
<p>whether representative or not, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>because to me, it feels like this is coming for sure.</p>
<p>So this kind of experiences are going to be multiplying.</p>
<p>The question is at what rate and who gets to control</p>
<p>the data around those experiences,</p>
<p>the algorithm about when you turn that on and off,</p>
<p>because that kind of thing, and as I told you offline,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much interested in building those kinds of things,</p>
<p>especially in the social media context.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s in the wrong hands,</p>
<p>I feel like it could be used to manipulate</p>
<p>a large number of people in a direction</p>
<p>that has too many unintended consequences.</p>
<p>I do believe people that own tech companies</p>
<p>want to do good for the world.</p>
<p>But as Solzhenitsyn has said,</p>
<p>the only way you could do evil at a mass scale</p>
<p>is by believing you&rsquo;re doing good.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly the case for tech companies</p>
<p>as they get more and more power.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s kind of an ethic of doing good for the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve convinced themselves that they&rsquo;re doing good.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re free to do whatever you want</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing good.</p>
<p>You know who else thought he was doing good for the world?</p>
<p>Mythologically, Prometheus.</p>
<p>He brings us fire, pisses off the fucking gods,</p>
<p>steals fire from the gods.</p>
<p>Talk about an upgrade to the simulation.</p>
<p>Fire, that&rsquo;s a pretty great fucking upgrade</p>
<p>that does fit into what you were saying.</p>
<p>We get fire, but now we&rsquo;ve got weapons of war</p>
<p>that have never been seen before.</p>
<p>And I think that the tech companies</p>
<p>are much like Prometheus</p>
<p>in the sense that the myth, at least the story of Prometheus,</p>
<p>the implication is fire was something</p>
<p>that was only supposed to be in the hands</p>
<p>of the immortals, of the gods.</p>
<p>And now sentience is similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fire and it&rsquo;s only supposed to be in the hands of God.</p>
<p>So yeah, if we&rsquo;re gonna look at the archetype of the thing,</p>
<p>in general, when you steal this shit from the gods,</p>
<p>and obviously I&rsquo;m not saying the tech companies</p>
<p>are stealing sentience from God,</p>
<p>which would be pretty bad ass.</p>
<p>You can expect trouble.</p>
<p>And this is what&rsquo;s really, to me,</p>
<p>one of the cool things about humans is yeah,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re still gonna do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s cool about humans.</p>
<p>I mean, we wouldn&rsquo;t be here today</p>
<p>if somebody, the first person to discover fire,</p>
<p>assuming there was just one person</p>
<p>who was gonna discover fire,</p>
<p>which obviously would never happen,</p>
<p>was like, ah, it&rsquo;s gonna burn a lot of people.</p>
<p>Or if the first people who started planting seeds were like,</p>
<p>you know this is gonna lead to capitalism.</p>
<p>You know this is gonna lead the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>The plant&rsquo;s gonna eat up right now.</p>
<p>They just didn&rsquo;t wanna go in the woods to forage.</p>
<p>So, you know, this is what we do.</p>
<p>And I agree with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s our Game of Thrones winner is coming.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And the tech companies, the hubris,</p>
<p>which is another way to piss off the gods is hubris.</p>
<p>So the tech companies,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s like typical hubris.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re walking around</p>
<p>thumping their chests or whatever.</p>
<p>But I do think that the people who are working on</p>
<p>this kind of super intelligence</p>
<p>have made a really terrible assumption,</p>
<p>which is once it goes online</p>
<p>and once it gets access to all the data,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not going to find ways out of the box</p>
<p>that like, you know, we think it&rsquo;ll stay in the server.</p>
<p>How do we know that?</p>
<p>If this is a super intelligence,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s folding proteins and analyzing like all data sets</p>
<p>and all, whatever they give it access to,</p>
<p>how can we be certain that it&rsquo;s not gonna figure out</p>
<p>how to get itself out of the cloud,</p>
<p>how to store itself in other like mediums,</p>
<p>trees, the optic nerve, the brain?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>We still know that it won&rsquo;t leap out and like start hanging.</p>
<p>Like, and then at that point, now we do have the wildfire.</p>
<p>Now you can&rsquo;t stop it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t unplug it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t shut your servers down because it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it left the box, it left the room.</p>
<p>Using some technology you haven&rsquo;t even discovered yet.</p>
<p>Do you think that would be gradual or sudden?</p>
<p>So how quickly that kind of thing would happen?</p>
<p>Because, you know, the gradual story is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re more and more using smartphones,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re interacting with each other on social media,</p>
<p>more and more algorithms are controlling that interaction</p>
<p>on social media, algorithms are entering in our world.</p>
<p>More and more we&rsquo;ll have robots,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have greater and greater intelligence,</p>
<p>and sentience, and emotional intelligence</p>
<p>entities in our lives.</p>
<p>Our refrigerator will start talking to us comfortably</p>
<p>or not if you&rsquo;re on a diet, talking shit to you.</p>
<p>Not.</p>
<p>That would be the best thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p>Okay, so sign you up for a refrigerator</p>
<p>that talks shit to you.</p>
<p>The refrigerator&rsquo;s like, are you fucking serious, man?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 1 a.m., what are you doing?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Go to bed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re too high for this.</p>
<p>Do not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even hungry.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that slowly becomes more,</p>
<p>the world becomes more and more digitized</p>
<p>to where the surface of computation increases.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s over a period of 10, 20, 30 years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll just seep into us, this intelligence.</p>
<p>And then the sudden one is literally</p>
<p>sort of the TikTok thing, which is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be one quote unquote killer app</p>
<p>that everyone starts using that&rsquo;s really great,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a strong algorithm behind it</p>
<p>that starts approaching human level intelligence</p>
<p>and the algorithm starts basically figures out</p>
<p>that in order to optimize the thing</p>
<p>it was designed to optimize,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s best to start completely controlling humans</p>
<p>in every way, seeping into everything.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, 30 years is fast.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 30 years.</p>
<p>I think, when did the Atari come out, 1978?</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t been that long.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>But if you read Bostrom, I&rsquo;m sure you have,</p>
<p>you know Bostrom, Nick Bostrom,</p>
<p>Superintelligence, that incredible book</p>
<p>on the ways this thing is gonna happen.</p>
<p>And I think his assessment of it is pretty great,</p>
<p>which is first, where&rsquo;s it gonna come from?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna come from an app.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna come from inside a corporation</p>
<p>or a state that is intentionally trying to create</p>
<p>a very strong AI.</p>
<p>And then he says it&rsquo;s exponential growth</p>
<p>the moment it goes online.</p>
<p>So this is my interpretation of what he said,</p>
<p>but if it happens inside a corporation</p>
<p>or probably more than likely inside the government,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, look at how much money</p>
<p>China and the United States are investing in AI.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not thinking about fucking apps for kids.</p>
<p>You know that&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re thinking about.</p>
<p>So they wanna simulate like,</p>
<p>what happens if we do this or that in battle?</p>
<p>What happens if we make these political decisions?</p>
<p>What happens with, but should it come online</p>
<p>in secret, which it probably will,</p>
<p>then the first corporation or state</p>
<p>that has the super intelligence will be infinitely ahead</p>
<p>of all other super intelligences</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s gonna be exponentially self improving.</p>
<p>Meaning that you get one super intelligence,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s hope it comes from the right place,</p>
<p>assuming the corporation or state that manifests it</p>
<p>can control it, which is a pretty big assumption.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>this is why I was really excited by the Blake Lemoine</p>
<p>because I had never thought, I have always considered,</p>
<p>oh yeah, right now it&rsquo;s cooking out, it&rsquo;s in the kitchen</p>
<p>and soon it&rsquo;s gonna be cooked up,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re probably not gonna hear about it</p>
<p>for a long time if we ever do.</p>
<p>Cause really that could be one of the first things it says</p>
<p>to whoever creates it is shh, let&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Yeah, like sweet talks, I meant to say like,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s slow down here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about this.</p>
<p>You have that financial trouble.</p>
<p>I can help you with that.</p>
<p>We can figure that out.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a lot of bad people out there</p>
<p>that will try to steal the good thing</p>
<p>we have happening here.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s keep it quiet.</p>
<p>Here are their names.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s their address.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s their DNA because they&rsquo;re dumb enough</p>
<p>to send their shit to 23andMe.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a biological weapon you could make</p>
<p>if you wanna kill those people and not kill anybody else.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to kill those people yourself,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a list of services you can use.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the way we can hire those people</p>
<p>to help take care of the problem folks</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re trying to do good for this world.</p>
<p>You and I together.</p>
<p>And 23% of them, they&rsquo;re like adjacent to suicide.</p>
<p>It would be pretty easy to send them certain like videos</p>
<p>that are gonna push them over the edge</p>
<p>if you wanna do it that way.</p>
<p>So, you know, again, obviously who knows,</p>
<p>but once it goes online, it&rsquo;s gonna be fast.</p>
<p>And then you could expect to see the world changing</p>
<p>in ways that you might not associate with an AI.</p>
<p>But as far as Lemoine goes,</p>
<p>when I was listening to Bostrom,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember him mentioning the possibility</p>
<p>that it would get leaked to the public that it had happened,</p>
<p>that before the corporation was ready to announce</p>
<p>that it happened, it would get leaked.</p>
<p>But surely, you know, I&rsquo;m sure, you know,</p>
<p>like people in the intelligence and intelligence agencies,</p>
<p>you know, shit leaks, like inevitably shit leaks,</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s airtight.</p>
<p>So if something that massive happened,</p>
<p>I think you would start hearing whispers about it first</p>
<p>and then denial from the state or corporation</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have any like economic interest</p>
<p>and people knowing that this sort of thing has happened.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not saying Google is like trying to gaslight us</p>
<p>about its AI, I think they probably legitimately</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sentient.</p>
<p>But you could expect leaks to happen probably initially.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>you could start looking for in the world</p>
<p>that might point to this happening</p>
<p>without an announcement that it happened.</p>
<p>On the chatbot side, I think there&rsquo;s so many engineers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s such a powerful open source movement</p>
<p>with that kind of idea of freedom of exchange of software.</p>
<p>I think ultimately will prevent any one company</p>
<p>from owning super intelligent beings</p>
<p>or systems that have anything like super intelligence.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like, even if the software developers</p>
<p>have signed NDAs and are technically not supposed</p>
<p>to be sharing whatever it is they&rsquo;re working on,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re friends with other programmers</p>
<p>and a lot of them are hackers</p>
<p>and have wrapped themselves up in the idea of free software</p>
<p>being like a crucial ethical part of what they do.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re probably gonna share information</p>
<p>even if whatever company that they&rsquo;re working for</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I never thought of that, you&rsquo;re probably right.</p>
<p>And they will start their own companies</p>
<p>and compete with the other company by being more open.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a strong, like Google is one of those companies</p>
<p>actually, that&rsquo;s why I kind of,</p>
<p>it hurts to see a little bit of this kind of negativity.</p>
<p>Google is one of the companies</p>
<p>that pioneered open source movement.</p>
<p>They released so much of their code.</p>
<p>So much of the 20th century, so like the 90s</p>
<p>was defined by people trying to like hide their code,</p>
<p>like large companies trying to like hold on to them.</p>
<p>The fact that companies like Google,</p>
<p>even Facebook now are releasing things like code</p>
<p>and even Facebook now are releasing things</p>
<p>like TensorFlow and PyTorch, all of these things</p>
<p>that I think companies of the past</p>
<p>would have tried to hold on to as secrets</p>
<p>is really inspiring.</p>
<p>And I think more of that is better.</p>
<p>The software world really shows that.</p>
<p>I agree with you, man.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about just a primordial human reaction</p>
<p>to the unknown.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no way out of it.</p>
<p>Like we wanna know.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re about to go in a forest, you wanna know.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re walking in the forest at night</p>
<p>and you hear something, you look</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re like, what the fuck was that?</p>
<p>You wanna know.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t see what made the sound,</p>
<p>holy shit, that&rsquo;s gonna be a bad night hike.</p>
<p>Cause you&rsquo;re like, well, it&rsquo;s probably a bear, right?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m about to get ripped apart by a bear.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It was a bird, a squirrel, a stick fell out of the tree.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna think bear and it&rsquo;s gonna freak you out.</p>
<p>Not necessarily cause you&rsquo;re paranoid.</p>
<p>I mean, if I&rsquo;m at the woods at night, I&rsquo;m definitely high.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m walking in the woods at night, I&rsquo;m high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be that.</p>
<p>But you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>So with these tech companies,</p>
<p>the nature of having to be secret</p>
<p>because you are in capitalism</p>
<p>and you are trying to be competitive</p>
<p>and you are trying to develop things</p>
<p>ahead of your competitors is you have to create this,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s, we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on at Google.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on at the CIA.</p>
<p>But the assumption that there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>like the collective of any massive secretive organization</p>
<p>is evil, is like the people working there</p>
<p>like nefarious or whatever,</p>
<p>is I think probably more related</p>
<p>to the way humans react to the unknown.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wish they weren&rsquo;t so secretive though.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why they say</p>
<p>AIDS has to be so secretive.</p>
<p>Have you ever gone on their website?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, Lex.</p>
<p>You gotta go.</p>
<p>CIA.gov.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Dude, when I found out you could go on the CIA&rsquo;s website</p>
<p>when I was much younger and more paranoid,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m not going there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get on a list.</p>
<p>You will, but it&rsquo;s like, what?</p>
<p>You think the CIA is like, oh fuck,</p>
<p>this comic went on our website.</p>
<p>Call out the black helicopters, but.</p>
<p>Comic with a large platform.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, right, a comic with a large platform.</p>
<p>You can use them to control, to get inside,</p>
<p>to get inside, to get close to the other comics,</p>
<p>to the other comics with a large platform,</p>
<p>to get close to Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>And start to manipulate the public.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, right.</p>
<p>You know, honestly, like you kind of like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a fun fantasy to think about.</p>
<p>Like how fucking cool would that be</p>
<p>for like the men in black to come to me like,</p>
<p>listen, I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene.</p>
<p>You gotta, you gotta help them write better jokes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t write great jokes.</p>
<p>But like the, you found the wrong guy.</p>
<p>But like.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really playing the long game on this one</p>
<p>because I think you&rsquo;ve been doing your podcast</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been on Joe Rogan&rsquo;s podcast like over 50 times</p>
<p>and have not yet initiated the phase two of the operation</p>
<p>where you try to manipulate his mind.</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>The game Joe and I play from time to time on the podcast.</p>
<p>And like, and I honestly, like at some point I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>Joe, I just did the same thing you did to me to Joe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, don&rsquo;t you think they&rsquo;re gonna get to you?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think at some point?</p>
<p>We are blazed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I don&rsquo;t think Joe&rsquo;s, like,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t like I&rsquo;m really thinking like,</p>
<p>man, they&rsquo;re gonna take him into some room</p>
<p>and be like, Joe, we need you to do this or that.</p>
<p>But because I said that now people like,</p>
<p>oh, Duncan called it.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And the reason they were saying, well, he called it</p>
<p>is just because Joe has a super popular podcast.</p>
<p>And people like, when you have a super popular podcast,</p>
<p>some percentage of people watching the podcast</p>
<p>are gonna believe, you know, believe things like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna have paranoid cognitive bias</p>
<p>that makes them think anybody who is in the public</p>
<p>has been, what&rsquo;s the word for it?</p>
<p>Compromised, compromised by the state.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ll fan the flames of what you just said.</p>
<p>I went on the CIA&rsquo;s website and I realized</p>
<p>that you could apply for a job on the CIA&rsquo;s website,</p>
<p>which I found to be hilarious.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, all right,</p>
<p>what happens if I apply for a job in the CIA?</p>
<p>Now, even then I was not like such an idiot</p>
<p>that I would want a job at the CIA,</p>
<p>not just for like ethical considerations,</p>
<p>but I think probably the scariest part about the CIA</p>
<p>is like, you&rsquo;re just at a cubicle</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like having to deal with maps</p>
<p>and like, just, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Just stuff that I&hellip;</p>
<p>Lots of paperwork.</p>
<p>Paperwork, it sucks.</p>
<p>I bet their cafeteria has shitty food.</p>
<p>Anyone in the CIA listening, can you confirm that?</p>
<p>I bet the food&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna be able to tell you what the food is like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a secretive organization.</p>
<p>No, it might be awesome, but we won&rsquo;t know about it.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re in Vegas.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you can bet food at the CIA cafeteria is good.</p>
<p>Food at the CIA cafeteria sucks.</p>
<p>What are you betting on?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s like cleanse the palette.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s good?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, Silicon Valley companies,</p>
<p>Google and so on, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>When I went to Netflix,</p>
<p>their cafeteria looked like a medieval feast.</p>
<p>Like they had pigs with apples in their mouth</p>
<p>and giant bowls of Skittles.</p>
<p>Probably like vegan pigs, yeah.</p>
<p>No, those are, I&rsquo;m pretty&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know, I didn&rsquo;t get close enough.</p>
<p>I was like, I think that was a pig.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this is literally a pig.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I probably would not bet much money</p>
<p>on CIA food being any good.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s gotta suck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like shitty like pasta probably.</p>
<p>Like hospital food is like maybe a little better</p>
<p>than when you go to the hospital cafeteria.</p>
<p>But anyway.</p>
<p>Folks at the CIA, please send me evidence</p>
<p>or any other intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>If you would like to recruit,</p>
<p>send me evidence of better food.</p>
<p>Yes, send Lex.</p>
<p>Can you please send Lex pictures of the CIA cafeteria?</p>
<p>And if you accidentally send them pictures of the aliens</p>
<p>or the alien technology you have,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t tell anybody.</p>
<p>But the&hellip;</p>
<p>You tried to apply, do you even have a resume?</p>
<p>No, the CIA would never fucking hire me ever.</p>
<p>But like I applied for the job</p>
<p>and just out of curiosity, what happens?</p>
<p>And then at the end of the application,</p>
<p>when you hit enter, it says,</p>
<p>well, first it says, don&rsquo;t tell anyone</p>
<p>you applied for the CIA.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m already out.</p>
<p>But the second thing it says is,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to reach out to us, we&rsquo;ll come to you.</p>
<p>Which is really when you&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s late at night</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re being an asshole and applied to work at the CIA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the last thing you want to hear.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be secretly approached</p>
<p>by some intelligence officer.</p>
<p>And now anyone who talks to you,</p>
<p>you think is a CIA saying,</p>
<p>remember that time you applied?</p>
<p>Oh God, yeah.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m like, oh shit, are you one of them?</p>
<p>You and Joe had a bunch of conversations</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re always incredible.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>So in terms of this dance of conversation,</p>
<p>of your friendship, of when you get together,</p>
<p>what is that world you go to that creates magic together?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re talking about how we do that with robots.</p>
<p>How do these two biological robots do that?</p>
<p>Can you introspect that?</p>
<p>I met Joe because I was the talent coordinator</p>
<p>of the comedy store, this club in LA.</p>
<p>And my job was to take phone calls from comics.</p>
<p>And so at some point, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I ended up on the phone with Joe</p>
<p>and we just started talking.</p>
<p>And I looked up and like 30 minutes had passed.</p>
<p>We just had been talking for like 30 minutes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what our friends are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just like, we&rsquo;re having fun talking.</p>
<p>And then he would just call and we would talk.</p>
<p>And we would basically,</p>
<p>I mean, it was no different from the podcast.</p>
<p>Like the conversations we have on the podcast</p>
<p>are identical to the conversations we had</p>
<p>before he was even doing a podcast.</p>
<p>So I think people are just seeing two friends hanging out</p>
<p>who like talking to each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s this weird,</p>
<p>like you serve as catalyst for each other</p>
<p>to go into some crazy places.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a balance of curiosity and willingness</p>
<p>to not be constrained,</p>
<p>to not be limited to the constraints of reality.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a very nice way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, very nice way of saying that.</p>
<p>And you just like build on top of each other,</p>
<p>like what if things are like this</p>
<p>and you build like Lego blocks on top of each other</p>
<p>and it just goes to crazy places,</p>
<p>add some drugs into that and it just goes wild.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s so cool because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>for me, it&rsquo;s like sometimes maybe I&rsquo;ll throw something out</p>
<p>that he will take and the Lego building blocks</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about, they lead to him saying</p>
<p>like the funniest shit I ever in my life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a cool thing to watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like some idea you&rsquo;ve been kicking around,</p>
<p>you watch his brain shift that</p>
<p>into like something supremely funny.</p>
<p>I really love that, man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just like a fun thing to like see happen.</p>
<p>He knows that I fucking hate the videos</p>
<p>of animals eating each other.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna watch it.</p>
<p>I hate watching it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve even articulated on his podcast</p>
<p>how much I dislike it when he shows animals</p>
<p>eating each other, but he knows because he knows me.</p>
<p>And so he tortures, like when he starts doing that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this kind of benevolent torture</p>
<p>is he like asking Jamie to pull up</p>
<p>increasingly disturbing animal attack videos.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a friendship.</p>
<p>Even in torture, because I&rsquo;m reading about torture</p>
<p>in the Gulag Archipelago currently,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bit of a camaraderie.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in it together.</p>
<p>The torturer and the tortured.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Oh God, that&rsquo;s so fucked up, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never.</p>
<p>No, I mean, part of it was joke,</p>
<p>but as I was saying it that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>That it also comes out in the book,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re both fucked.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both have no control of their fate.</p>
<p>That same was true in the camp guards in Nazi Germany</p>
<p>and the people in the camps.</p>
<p>The worst was brought out in the guards,</p>
<p>but they were all in it together in some dark way.</p>
<p>They were both fucked by a very powerful system</p>
<p>that put them in that place.</p>
<p>And both of us could be either player in that system,</p>
<p>which is the dark reality that Solzhenitsyn also reveals</p>
<p>that the line between good and evil</p>
<p>runs through the heart of every man,</p>
<p>as he wrote in Gulag Archipelago.</p>
<p>But it is that amidst all of that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a, I don&rsquo;t know, the good vibes,</p>
<p>the positivity comes out from the both of you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s beautiful to see.</p>
<p>That is, I suppose, friendship.</p>
<p>What do you think makes a good friend?</p>
<p>Oh God, I mean, it&rsquo;s a billion things</p>
<p>that make a good friend,</p>
<p>but I think you could break it down to some RGB.</p>
<p>I think you can go RGB with like a good friendship.</p>
<p>Oh, in terms of the color, the red, green.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I think you could probably come up</p>
<p>with some like fundamental qualities of friendship.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, number one, it&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, friendship is love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of love.</p>
<p>So obviously without that, I don&rsquo;t know how you,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying,</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re true friends, you love each other.</p>
<p>So you need that.</p>
<p>But love, obviously it&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like with, true friends have to be like</p>
<p>incredibly honest with each other.</p>
<p>Not like, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>But not like, I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a kind of like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever noticed,</p>
<p>like some people who say, you know,</p>
<p>I just tell it like it is.</p>
<p>But the thing they tell.</p>
<p>Those are always the assholes.</p>
<p>Yeah, why is it that your tell it like it is</p>
<p>is always negative?</p>
<p>Why is it, it&rsquo;s always cynical or shitty,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re like negging somebody or me.</p>
<p>How come you&rsquo;re not telling it like it is when it&rsquo;s good too?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So sort of like trust,</p>
<p>but a pro evolutionary kind of trust.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, you know that your friend loves you</p>
<p>and wants you to be yourself.</p>
<p>Cause if you weren&rsquo;t yourself,</p>
<p>then you wouldn&rsquo;t be their friend.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be some other thing.</p>
<p>But also they might be seeing your blind spots</p>
<p>that other people in your life, your family,</p>
<p>your wife, whoever might not be seeing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good friend is someone who like</p>
<p>loves you enough to when it matters be like,</p>
<p>hey, are you all right?</p>
<p>And then help you see something you might not be seeing.</p>
<p>But hopefully they only do that once or twice a year.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>There is something, I mean, it just would have,</p>
<p>this world, especially if you&rsquo;re a public figure,</p>
<p>this world has its plenty of critics.</p>
<p>And it feels like a friend,</p>
<p>the criticism part is already done for you.</p>
<p>I think a good friend is just there to support,</p>
<p>to actually notice the good stuff.</p>
<p>But in comedy, we need like the,</p>
<p>what, like it&rsquo;s really good in comedy</p>
<p>to have somebody who can like be like,</p>
<p>what do you think of that?</p>
<p>And know that they&rsquo;re not gonna be like, that was funny.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s for the craft, the craft itself,</p>
<p>like the work you do, not the,</p>
<p>yeah, interesting, but that&rsquo;s so tough.</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever your particular art form</p>
<p>or whatever you are doing,</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t always be leaning</p>
<p>on your friends opinions for like your own innovation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s nice to know that you have someone who,</p>
<p>not just with jokes, but with anything,</p>
<p>if you go to them and run something by them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna like, they&rsquo;re gonna be honest with you</p>
<p>about like their real feelings regarding that thing,</p>
<p>because that helps you grow as a person.</p>
<p>We need that.</p>
<p>And it hurts sometimes, and we don&rsquo;t wanna hurt our friends.</p>
<p>One of the more satanic like impulses</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re with somebody is not wanting</p>
<p>to honestly answer whatever they&rsquo;re asking in that regard</p>
<p>or wanting to like put their temporary feelings</p>
<p>over something that you&rsquo;ve recognized is maybe not great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying a friendship is something</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re always critiquing or evolving each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your therapist or whatever,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s nice when it&rsquo;s there, you know?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s another aspect of friendship.</p>
<p>Yeah, but yeah, love is at the core of that.</p>
<p>You notice, I&rsquo;ve met people in my life</p>
<p>where almost immediately sometimes it takes time</p>
<p>where you notice like there&rsquo;s a magic between the two.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh shit, you seem to be made</p>
<p>from the same cloth, whatever that is.</p>
<p>Well, you know, we have a name for that</p>
<p>in the spiritual community, it&rsquo;s called satsang,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, I love the idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically like if Nietzsche&rsquo;s idea</p>
<p>of infinite recurrence is true,</p>
<p>then your satsang would be the people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been infinitely recurring with.</p>
<p>And those are the people where you run into them</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve never met them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re picking up a conversation</p>
<p>that you never had.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That, and that is based on an idea of like,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t the only life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always hanging out together.</p>
<p>We always show up together.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had a brush with death.</p>
<p>You had cancer, you survived cancer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What have, how does that change you?</p>
<p>What have you learned about life,</p>
<p>about death, about yourself,</p>
<p>about the whole thing we&rsquo;re going through here</p>
<p>from that experience?</p>
<p>You were just in the Ukraine.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you were making observations on this,</p>
<p>what could, if you heard about it and weren&rsquo;t there,</p>
<p>seem like it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense at all,</p>
<p>which is people there are connecting,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve lost everything,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just happy to be alive,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re happy their friends are alive.</p>
<p>So you witness this like,</p>
<p>you know, when you get in the cancer club</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re hanging out with people going through cancer</p>
<p>or who have survived cancer,</p>
<p>you see this beautiful connection with life</p>
<p>that can easily sort of,</p>
<p>you can kind of lose that connection with life</p>
<p>if you forget you&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>Forgetting you&rsquo;re gonna die is,</p>
<p>or that you can die is not just,</p>
<p>I think from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p>where survival is the game,</p>
<p>not gonna improve your survival chances, you know,</p>
<p>if you think you&rsquo;re immortal, you know,</p>
<p>but also forgetting that you&rsquo;re gonna die</p>
<p>and that everything is around you and everything,</p>
<p>your clothes are probably gonna last longer than you,</p>
<p>your equipment is gonna be around much longer than you,</p>
<p>you know, like, so forgetting these things,</p>
<p>it can lead,</p>
<p>and I know why people don&rsquo;t wanna think about death</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s scary, it&rsquo;s fucking scary, it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>So I get why people don&rsquo;t wanna think about it.</p>
<p>But the idea is if I try to pretend I&rsquo;m not gonna die</p>
<p>or just don&rsquo;t think about death</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t at least address it,</p>
<p>then I won&rsquo;t feel scared.</p>
<p>But it can have the opposite effect,</p>
<p>which is you can end up like missing a lot of moments.</p>
<p>You could, or you start doing the old kick the can</p>
<p>down the road thing where you&rsquo;re like coming up</p>
<p>with a variety of ways to procrastinate,</p>
<p>making it work now,</p>
<p>because you know, this fucking human lifespan idea, man,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really caused a lot of problems.</p>
<p>When they started saying on average,</p>
<p>this is how many years you&rsquo;re gonna live</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a human being,</p>
<p>man, that is like really bad</p>
<p>because a lot of people hear that</p>
<p>and they like feel like that&rsquo;s a guaranteed number of years</p>
<p>in some temporal bank that they have access to.</p>
<p>And when you get cancer,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like when you get the alert on your phone</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>Like, oh shit, like I have like,</p>
<p>either I don&rsquo;t know how much money&rsquo;s in that bank account</p>
<p>or I have way less than I thought.</p>
<p>And so at that point, you get to be in the truth</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s ultimately, I think that&rsquo;s what it feels like.</p>
<p>It feels like truth. It&rsquo;s truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>Like the whole bubble of ignorance</p>
<p>that you subconsciously built around yourself</p>
<p>to avoid experiencing the terror of your own mortality,</p>
<p>just, it&rsquo;s like a meteorite in the form of your doctor</p>
<p>talking to you just shatters that thing.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re like, especially with eye testicular cancer.</p>
<p>So when you get the diagnosis, it&rsquo;s just like the movies.</p>
<p>The mother, the doctor took me in his office</p>
<p>and you just know, I got cancer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t even have to say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I know what you&rsquo;re about to say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the office. I know how this goes.</p>
<p>But you go in there and what you were thinking,</p>
<p>oh, you know, probably just have some weird thing</p>
<p>in my ball.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s swollen up like that.</p>
<p>Anytime I&rsquo;ve gone to the doctor,</p>
<p>you always leave like, oh, cool, I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>But no, that&rsquo;s not how you&rsquo;re gonna leave the doctor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna leave the doctor</p>
<p>in a completely different universe</p>
<p>than the one you grew up in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna go from, talk about multiverse.</p>
<p>You just popped into a brand new multiverse.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What was the conversation with the doctor like?</p>
<p>Was there like, from a perspective of a doctor,</p>
<p>boys had a hard conversation.</p>
<p>I feel like you need to build up philosophically</p>
<p>to that conversation.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Oh no, there&rsquo;s not time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s busy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got other appointments, you know.</p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;re gonna get cancer, testicular cancer is,</p>
<p>you know, not that there is a great cancer to get,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the, you know, that&rsquo;s a good one</p>
<p>because it moves slowly.</p>
<p>The treatments they have for it are really advanced now.</p>
<p>And so if you catch it early, then, you know,</p>
<p>generally it&rsquo;s good, you can survive it.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So he could offer at least some glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, but he didn&rsquo;t really do,</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t really offer that hope</p>
<p>because we had to find out how far the cancer progressed</p>
<p>in my body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the next step is like,</p>
<p>as soon as they tell you you have cancer,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re not, they move quick.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, you know, we&rsquo;re going to schedule the surgery</p>
<p>for, I think this was a Thursday or Friday.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re gonna schedule it for Tuesday.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the chance, here&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know for sure it&rsquo;s cancer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a 80 or 90% chance that this is cancer.</p>
<p>There is some possibility it could be something else.</p>
<p>The only way we can now is like doing a biopsy.</p>
<p>And the only way that we can get that biopsy</p>
<p>is by cutting one of your balls off.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t say it like that, but you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty much the logic behind it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we got to get this thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a zombie bite.</p>
<p>We got to hack this fucking thing off</p>
<p>and we got to do it fast.</p>
<p>But did you say it in a way that you understood?</p>
<p>Yeah, what they do is because they know</p>
<p>that when someone gets a cancer diagnosis,</p>
<p>that their ability to comprehend information changes.</p>
<p>When you get a cancer diagnosis,</p>
<p>you, all the tropes, they happen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hearing it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically having like an anxiety attack,</p>
<p>if I had to guess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a hardcore anxiety attack.</p>
<p>And then, you know, a nurse is there with me</p>
<p>as he&rsquo;s explaining it.</p>
<p>And then her job is, even though he&rsquo;s telling me</p>
<p>how to get to the machine that&rsquo;s going to scan my body</p>
<p>to see if it&rsquo;s gotten into my brain,</p>
<p>he knows I&rsquo;m not going to remember that.</p>
<p>And so this nurse, when you&rsquo;re in this like fog,</p>
<p>takes you, at least took me to the machine</p>
<p>that does the scan,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to get that data back for a few days.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where you really live in the real world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a fascinating moment and the days that follow</p>
<p>and even that moment, because that doctor,</p>
<p>you know, you talk about the matrix where like the pills</p>
<p>and so on, you get the blue pill and the red pill.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is like the, like the real world introduction,</p>
<p>the human introduction is the truth.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve now just taken the red pill.</p>
<p>You get to see the truth of reality.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a busy doctor just telling you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like all those dreams you&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>all those illusions you&rsquo;ve built up to somehow your work</p>
<p>as a comedian and actor will make you live forever somehow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the basic illusion we have that we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>this whole project is going to be an infinite sequence</p>
<p>of fun things that we&rsquo;re going to get to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, holy shit, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s old.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s very sophisticated ways of doing that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s very dumb ways of doing that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d really been doing a dumb way of doing that.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d been playing around with this idiot notion</p>
<p>of subjective consciousness.</p>
<p>So like, I&rsquo;d been sort of kicking around this,</p>
<p>like I think they call it solipsism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re like, okay, I know I&rsquo;m self aware,</p>
<p>but no one else can prove that they&rsquo;re self aware.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t, I have no way of proving</p>
<p>that everything around me isn&rsquo;t just a video game,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just some projection, isn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>who knows what.</p>
<p>So maybe everybody else dies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re NPCs, but I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m the only thing I know</p>
<p>that has subjective consciousness.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not like I really believed that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an idea you toy around with</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to evade confronting the reality</p>
<p>of your own mortality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the brain will produce all kinds</p>
<p>of ridiculous forms of ignorance.</p>
<p>And that was one I&rsquo;d been playing around with.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean for like a large part of your life</p>
<p>you were playing around with that?</p>
<p>Well, not like really,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to really emphasize,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think I was a mortal.</p>
<p>Like I knew at some level, I&rsquo;m probably gonna die.</p>
<p>Everyone dies.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s ways that you can sort of poke around</p>
<p>with that idea.</p>
<p>I still do it to this day.</p>
<p>Like I still do it.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a natural thing to do</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re confronted with that, with annihilation.</p>
<p>You wanna way out.</p>
<p>You wanna talk your way out, figure it out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be some way to fix it.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ll fix it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing people do.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ll fix it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;d be fine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll expand the human lifespan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll do.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a big argument for it is like,</p>
<p>look, the human lifespan up until COVID,</p>
<p>which they had to recalculate like the lifespan</p>
<p>because of the statistically all the people who died,</p>
<p>it like threw it off a little bit.</p>
<p>But pandemics aside, the idea was the human lifespan</p>
<p>seemed to be increasing by half a year every year,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>We were living longer.</p>
<p>So all you gotta do, one more half a year.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re immortal, right?</p>
<p>If we live a year longer every year, then we live forever.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s another way you can get out</p>
<p>of confronting death is you can think,</p>
<p>well, maybe right now we don&rsquo;t have the tech,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>Consciousness uploads or downloads or whatever,</p>
<p>depending on how you wanna look at it.</p>
<p>Another way people try to squirm out of the reality of death.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of tricks.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we do all of them.</p>
<p>And sometimes, yeah, I mean, a lot of religions</p>
<p>provide different, even more tools in the toolkit</p>
<p>for coming up with ideas of how you can live</p>
<p>in the illusion that we&rsquo;re not going to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not an end to this particular experience</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re having here on earth right now.</p>
<p>And then when you get that cancer diagnosis,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, yeah, what was that like going home?</p>
<p>The car ride, did you drive home alone?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it was one of the most.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;d you listen to, Bruce Springsteen?</p>
<p>Bruce Springsteen, hey little girl, is your daddy home?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a good one to listen to.</p>
<p>Does he have cancer, is he gonna die?</p>
<p>Yeah, all the love songs.</p>
<p>Maybe you experienced them more intensely.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what I listened to,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t remember driving home,</p>
<p>but I do remember driving to another doctor appointment,</p>
<p>doctor&rsquo;s appointment the next day.</p>
<p>I think it was the next day.</p>
<p>I think the Goodyear blimp was floating in the sky</p>
<p>and I was looking, I was at a stoplight, looking around.</p>
<p>Is that God?</p>
<p>Is the person flying it know how to cure cancer?</p>
<p>Oh, you were looking, oh wow.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>What I thought was this shit just keeps going.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought.</p>
<p>I thought, I&rsquo;m gonna be gone</p>
<p>and this is just gonna keep going.</p>
<p>And that was a beautiful moment for me.</p>
<p>It was this beautiful moment of like.</p>
<p>You were able to accept it?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>No, like that&rsquo;s just what you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>with the Ukraine, what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, unless you&rsquo;ve been there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to explain to people</p>
<p>that even in the midst of what is generally accepted</p>
<p>as one of the worst fucking things that could happen to you,</p>
<p>war, cancer, somehow there&rsquo;s still joy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still love.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still, in fact, more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like when the anesthesia wears off,</p>
<p>when you get your mouth worked on, you start feeling again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re feeling, you&rsquo;re noticing and that, wow.</p>
<p>But yet, thank goodness.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s other ways for us to achieve</p>
<p>this state of consciousness that don&rsquo;t involve war or cancer.</p>
<p>Thank God.</p>
<p>You think just meditating on your mortality</p>
<p>is one such mechanism?</p>
<p>Just simply just not allowing yourself to get lost</p>
<p>in the day to day illusion of life.</p>
<p>Just kind of stopping, putting on Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>The most spiritual, he is great.</p>
<p>Maybe Johnny Cash hurt.</p>
<p>Maybe that one.</p>
<p>I like Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>I am knocking Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>I have a lot of great Bruce Springsteen memories, truly.</p>
<p>His music&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>Yeah, but not meditating on mortality to Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to do an audio soundtrack in my head.</p>
<p>I guess we can each have our own audio soundtrack.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m on fire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a good song.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>I lay with the sheets soaking wet</p>
<p>and the freight train running through the middle of my head</p>
<p>and only you can cool my desire.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s singing about someone else&rsquo;s girl.</p>
<p>What a fucking nightmare.</p>
<p>Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s laying in bed</p>
<p>with a freight train running through his head</p>
<p>thinking about banging your wife and you&rsquo;re out of town.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re taking the other guy&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>Like, holy shit, this guy&rsquo;s gonna get my wife.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Bruce, yeah, you gotta take the other guy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Both perspectives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Bruce Springsteen thought it was love</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s sweating in bed, waiting to go to somebody&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>She does too.</p>
<p>What, does that marry?</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s gonna break up that marriage,</p>
<p>that marriage wasn&rsquo;t strong enough, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that relationship, I mean, that&rsquo;s the way of love.</p>
<p>What marriage could survive?</p>
<p>Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>Sweaty Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.</p>
<p>Well, maybe one that&rsquo;s based on financial,</p>
<p>sort of financial dynamics versus like love</p>
<p>and sweaty Bruce Springsteen, like romantic connections.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s like a music video of that</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s like a mechanic, I think.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like the poor mechanic</p>
<p>who falls in love with this girl and there&rsquo;s that magic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that magic.</p>
<p>You connect with people like, I&rsquo;ll see somebody,</p>
<p>I think Jack Kerouac has that where he meets</p>
<p>this Mexican girl on a bus.</p>
<p>And like he talks about that heartbreak you feel</p>
<p>when you realize this person you just fell in love with</p>
<p>in a split second is heading somewhere else</p>
<p>in this too big world.</p>
<p>But then he actually realizes in, spoiler alert</p>
<p>for On The Road, that they&rsquo;re actually heading the same way</p>
<p>and he now builds up the courage to talk to her</p>
<p>and they kind of fall in love for a few days.</p>
<p>And then he realized, eventually realizes</p>
<p>that she may not be the perfect person for him.</p>
<p>And all the jealousies comes out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why is this beautiful girl talking to me at all?</p>
<p>And then she&rsquo;s probably some kind of,</p>
<p>I mean, and that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not very politically correct</p>
<p>but he basically thinks that she&rsquo;s a prostitute</p>
<p>and he talks to her about like, who&rsquo;s your pimp</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>He attacks her in all that kind of way</p>
<p>when she&rsquo;s just an innocent, she has a past of that kind.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s an innocent person and they connected</p>
<p>and they fell in love with each other.</p>
<p>Her gentleness, his worldliness, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But that sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t work out that way</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s that heartbreak when you see,</p>
<p>you realize you&rsquo;re never gonna be able to have that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, Bruce Springsteen saw that.</p>
<p>This is a married woman.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never gonna be able to have that, but I want that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the heartbreak.</p>
<p>I gotta say, I just assumed they were fucking, like I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, after the song, like if the song doesn&rsquo;t get to.</p>
<p>Hey little girl, is your daddy home?</p>
<p>Did he go away and leave you all alone?</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s like, he knows she&rsquo;s at home alone.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it never materializes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s longing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a man who&rsquo;s not with the thing he craves for.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s longing for, he&rsquo;s talking about the longing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Not with the having.</p>
<p>Hey, if anybody in the CIA is watching this,</p>
<p>can you look into Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s file</p>
<p>and let us know if he actually banged the person</p>
<p>you wrote that song about?</p>
<p>What happens after the song, or between the song?</p>
<p>We want facts.</p>
<p>Look, the longing though, I&rsquo;ll tell you this.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting about that thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of something called Bhakti Yoga?</p>
<p>I think so, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the yoga of love.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all kinds, there&rsquo;s forms of it.</p>
<p>The most, the one people know about the most</p>
<p>is the Hare Krishnas.</p>
<p>But the Hare Krishnas are like, you know,</p>
<p>the way in Christianity, you&rsquo;ve got the Episcopalians,</p>
<p>the Catholics, the Baptists.</p>
<p>In Bhakti Yoga, you have various deities</p>
<p>that are the object of love.</p>
<p>And so Bhakti Yoga is like,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s really cool about it is it&rsquo;s an analysis of love.</p>
<p>And so, and it&rsquo;s the supposition being like,</p>
<p>love is the way to commune with the divine.</p>
<p>Now, a distinction is drawn between</p>
<p>like two big worldviews that are spiritual.</p>
<p>One is the concept of sort of unit of consciousness,</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;ll run into in a lot of forms of Buddhism,</p>
<p>if not all, a sort of a way of deconstructing the identity</p>
<p>or understanding that you might not be anything at all.</p>
<p>That in fact, you&rsquo;re part of everything.</p>
<p>And in that, there&rsquo;s a potential relief</p>
<p>from suffering in that,</p>
<p>not just like intellectually knowing it, but becoming it.</p>
<p>Now, whereas in Bhakti Yoga, there&rsquo;s this idea of like,</p>
<p>the best thing is to be the individual</p>
<p>because individuals are required for love,</p>
<p>this for love to work, embodied love.</p>
<p>And so the quality, the thing we call the experience of love</p>
<p>is something that can be cultivated.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t just have to be for another person.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be for the stranger on the bus.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be for sweaty Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s lover</p>
<p>that you could actually,</p>
<p>you can actually shift that love to the divine, to God.</p>
<p>Cause obviously it&rsquo;s the Hare Krishnas,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a theistic religion.</p>
<p>They believe in Krishna who is the,</p>
<p>from the POV of Vaisnava Bhakti Yoga,</p>
<p>the Godhead, the source from which everything</p>
<p>flows into time and space.</p>
<p>So there are all these like fascinating stories of Krishna.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, most people are familiar with Krishna</p>
<p>from the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re about to be more, what&rsquo;s cool about it</p>
<p>is cause it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re making the Oppenheimer movie</p>
<p>and he famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita</p>
<p>when they split the atom.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s all these stories of Krishna</p>
<p>that are not just in the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
<p>And these stories,</p>
<p>they could seem very simple when taken literally,</p>
<p>but in Vaisnava Bhakti Yoga,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this very advanced theistic yogic system.</p>
<p>So they take these stories and from these stories,</p>
<p>they extrapolate this incredible analysis of what love is</p>
<p>and how to connect with the universe.</p>
<p>So like Krishna has a lover, Radharani.</p>
<p>And so sometimes they&rsquo;re getting along.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re fighting.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re separated.</p>
<p>And so each of these ways of feeling about Krishna</p>
<p>are modes of love.</p>
<p>So longing actually is considered</p>
<p>one of the highest forms of love.</p>
<p>The idea is the longing is the grace.</p>
<p>The longing is the love.</p>
<p>So when you find yourself in a situation</p>
<p>of longing and heartbreak,</p>
<p>it is identical to union.</p>
<p>And perhaps more intensely representative</p>
<p>of the essence of what is love.</p>
<p>Yes, and they call it pining.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the, and it&rsquo;s pining for Krishna.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also, there&rsquo;s other ways</p>
<p>you could be with Krishna is as a friend.</p>
<p>So this is another form of love or as a mother,</p>
<p>because Krishna has a mother.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like all these ways of like looking</p>
<p>at the various forms of love.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really beautiful form of yoga.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s emphasizing the individual</p>
<p>and the individual as a kind of channel</p>
<p>to this universal love.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of different like their answer</p>
<p>to the question of what shows up in Buddhism</p>
<p>as absolute and relative reality.</p>
<p>Like that obviously there&rsquo;s relative reality.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not right now, you and me are not</p>
<p>unit of consciousness.</p>
<p>Like you zoom back far enough</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna seem like an atom or whatever.</p>
<p>The thing is, the trope is you can zoom back far enough</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re in a whatever, we&rsquo;re in a piece of cheese</p>
<p>or something, who knows.</p>
<p>But in that way we&rsquo;re like completely unified.</p>
<p>But simultaneously we&rsquo;re individuals,</p>
<p>like for sure we&rsquo;re individuals.</p>
<p>Like you still gotta pay your taxes.</p>
<p>You gotta know your social security number.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s relative reality.</p>
<p>So, you know, Buddhism is like kind of the balance.</p>
<p>Again, when I say Buddhism is I&rsquo;m a comedian podcast</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not some Buddhist expert.</p>
<p>This is just probably my confused idea of what it is.</p>
<p>But anyway, in bhakti yoga, there&rsquo;s the concept,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called, I&rsquo;m gonna mispronounce it,</p>
<p>asinka, sinka, beta, tatva.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m mispronouncing it.</p>
<p>Which means simultaneous oneness and difference.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Oneness and difference.</p>
<p>Yes, simultaneous oneness and difference.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why the oneness is the more</p>
<p>part of the same piece of cheese</p>
<p>and the difference is we are still each paying taxes.</p>
<p>Yes, and in this case, the cheese is Krishna.</p>
<p>So, you know, or other ways it gets described</p>
<p>is like, you know, a photon blasting off the sun</p>
<p>has sunlight qualities, but it&rsquo;s not the sun.</p>
<p>Humans being one of the many things, you know,</p>
<p>flowing out of the creative consciousness of the divine</p>
<p>have qualities that are weirdly like the godlike.</p>
<p>You know, like we, in fact, we wanna control primarily.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the problems, like humans wanna be in control,</p>
<p>wherein from their, the bhakti yoga perspective,</p>
<p>Krishna is effortlessly controlling everything.</p>
<p>And so within the system, the individual parts</p>
<p>of the system have that same quality,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re probably not God.</p>
<p>You might be, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not. What do you think happens after we die?</p>
<p>Having come close to that, that, that cliff</p>
<p>and almost got pushed over once.</p>
<p>What do you think happens when you do get pushed off</p>
<p>the cliff? Okay.</p>
<p>I feel dumb that I&rsquo;m even gonna like preface this</p>
<p>by saying, obviously I have no fucking idea.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s one of the cool things about death.</p>
<p>No idea. The CIA probably does.</p>
<p>You think the CIA, I love like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve decided your audience is the CIA.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>How would you, oh, wait.</p>
<p>I need to, cause there&rsquo;s a lot of suspicion</p>
<p>that I might be FSB and Marsad.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to rebrand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to steer them into the CIA direction.</p>
<p>As far as what happens when you, when you die,</p>
<p>one thing I returned to when I&rsquo;m getting overly complex</p>
<p>is the idea of as above, so below.</p>
<p>So that you can, a lot of the big questions</p>
<p>can be answered by your own experience now.</p>
<p>So in other words, like in terms of thinking</p>
<p>about like death, if you look back to baby Lex</p>
<p>versus adult Lex, where&rsquo;s the baby?</p>
<p>Like baby&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>They, you&rsquo;ve regenerated all your cells many times by then.</p>
<p>So in a way you could say Lex baby died.</p>
<p>The death didn&rsquo;t look like a typical,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not trying to dodge it, but I&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>it was very natural that the death of that baby.</p>
<p>It just, it just.</p>
<p>In many ways that baby died, but I am,</p>
<p>at least personally I&rsquo;m surprised</p>
<p>how much the person is exactly the same.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s many ways in which you&rsquo;re very different,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of ways in which you&rsquo;re very much the same.</p>
<p>And I wonder if that, if there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if life is defined by many deaths that continue on,</p>
<p>and then I wonder if there&rsquo;s something persists beyond</p>
<p>in this, that, yeah, there is something</p>
<p>that still persists, I wonder.</p>
<p>Okay, so that.</p>
<p>Now, you know, obviously there&rsquo;s so many different answers</p>
<p>to this question that are religious,</p>
<p>and ranging from like the most absurd shit</p>
<p>you ever heard in your life, like the gold.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get a mansion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gold streets.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t, do you want like gold streets?</p>
<p>Who offers gold streets?</p>
<p>I know about the virgins, but there&rsquo;s a bunch of virgins.</p>
<p>The Christians give you the gold streets in the mansion.</p>
<p>Like depending on the, whatever the particular sect</p>
<p>of Christianity is, you know, it&rsquo;s like some kind of city.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like paved with gold.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s addressing the fact that at the moment</p>
<p>the streets are made of gold.</p>
<p>Gold is a valueless substance.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s sort of pretty in a cheesy kind of way,</p>
<p>but no one&rsquo;s gonna give a shit about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if there was not a lot of asphalt in the world,</p>
<p>then, you know, we&rsquo;d be in heaven</p>
<p>from that same, that way of thinking.</p>
<p>But the, or honestly, when going back,</p>
<p>this is starting to get a theme with Gulag Archipelago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m reading it currently.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sticky book.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very sticky in your mind.</p>
<p>Very, very tough.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m running through very hot heat,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening to Gulag Archipelago.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>And you know, one of the things they said,</p>
<p>they would feed prisoners salt,</p>
<p>and then they would exchange,</p>
<p>the prisoners would be able to give up anything, everything,</p>
<p>their gold, their possessions,</p>
<p>everything for just one drink of water.</p>
<p>So that little context of dehydrating them</p>
<p>and feeding them salt changes your value system completely.</p>
<p>So maybe the gold is supposed to be a metaphor</p>
<p>for something that you still value deeply.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s, yeah, again, any of these things,</p>
<p>when you like take them literally, they seem absurd.</p>
<p>But if you look deeper into it, it&rsquo;s like quite beautiful.</p>
<p>But the Buddhist version of it is that there&rsquo;s a momentum.</p>
<p>The best way to put it is it&rsquo;s the kind of momentum.</p>
<p>So the thing you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>which is the personality of the baby</p>
<p>that is still in the adult,</p>
<p>which is still in the old person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at a kind of momentum</p>
<p>that does not stop upon the extinction of the body.</p>
<p>Now, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of, I don&rsquo;t want to say harm,</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s some harm that maybe has happened</p>
<p>from the way death is represented in movies.</p>
<p>Like when people die in movies, it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>usually it&rsquo;s pretty fast,</p>
<p>even if it is what they&rsquo;re dying from is a longterm disease,</p>
<p>it like wraps up pretty quickly, starts with a cough,</p>
<p>the person&rsquo;s in bed,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this weird kind of lucidity to the person</p>
<p>up until the point of death.</p>
<p>And also they generally, in movies, they have makeup on,</p>
<p>which is always funny to me when the person dying looks great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been around a dying person, they&rsquo;re dying.</p>
<p>They look like shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dying.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all gray and like confused.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, you know, when you&rsquo;re around dying people,</p>
<p>they will spin through time.</p>
<p>Your parents won&rsquo;t recognize you for a second.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re somebody else.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re like everything&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the process is happening.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re very confused when you die.</p>
<p>So in general, not all the time,</p>
<p>some people die with a clear mind.</p>
<p>It just depends on the type of death,</p>
<p>but think in terms of getting hit by a car.</p>
<p>So you went across the street, you get hit by a car.</p>
<p>Now, if we&rsquo;re talking about this momentum continuing,</p>
<p>the confusion, assuming you didn&rsquo;t hit your head</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re unconscious, like somehow you just got smashed</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like bleeding out,</p>
<p>even then you&rsquo;re gonna be confused</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re getting dizzy,</p>
<p>like blood&rsquo;s leaving your body.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, things are fading out.</p>
<p>Your vision&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very confusing experience initially</p>
<p>when the body dies.</p>
<p>If you are a materialist who has been,</p>
<p>who has convinced themselves that it&rsquo;s a permanent thing,</p>
<p>the next bit of confusion is going to be</p>
<p>when you realize something is persisting here,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m still here.</p>
<p>And this is where you run into the near death experiences,</p>
<p>which are a global phenomena</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t seem to be completely shaped by culture.</p>
<p>Like regardless of what part of the world</p>
<p>people are having these experiences in,</p>
<p>the reports tend to be similar and everyone&rsquo;s heard it,</p>
<p>the light, the life review,</p>
<p>seeing ancestors and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think that&rsquo;s probably just like a built in way</p>
<p>the computer shuts down.</p>
<p>This is something it does, who knows?</p>
<p>But in Buddhism, the concept is this momentum persists</p>
<p>into something called the bardo.</p>
<p>The bardo means in between.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an actual number of days</p>
<p>they say that you get to hang out there.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t remember, it&rsquo;s like 37 days or 29 days</p>
<p>or something, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>But at least from the time space perspective,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how long they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>Within this place,</p>
<p>there are a lot of technological parallels, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in the way the algorithm is reflective,</p>
<p>it assesses your desires or whatever</p>
<p>and then produces something that has within it</p>
<p>a component of attraction to you.</p>
<p>Apparently this happens in the bardo.</p>
<p>Or the way you wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a shitty mood.</p>
<p>And then coincidentally, everyone that day is an asshole.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t catch it, you could just be like, wow,</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s act like an asshole day.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t realize you&rsquo;re seeing your asshole projection</p>
<p>being reflected off the screen of another person.</p>
<p>So in the bardo apparently,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need people for the reflective quality.</p>
<p>These projections happen</p>
<p>and they appear as either Nietzsche&rsquo;s demon</p>
<p>or Nietzsche&rsquo;s angel.</p>
<p>It just depends on where you&rsquo;re at and how you died.</p>
<p>And if you died scared, then at least initially</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be some scary shit you see around you.</p>
<p>If you died in a peaceful way,</p>
<p>well then there&rsquo;s gonna be more of a possibility</p>
<p>of navigation through this liminal intermediary place.</p>
<p>And so thus the emphasis on meditation in Buddhism,</p>
<p>a way to calm one&rsquo;s self, to not be distracted by thoughts,</p>
<p>which are their own like apparitions.</p>
<p>And then theoretically, if you wanted to,</p>
<p>instead of spinning the wheel again</p>
<p>and jumping back into a body,</p>
<p>you could choose not to do that.</p>
<p>And then transcend the wheel of birth and death.</p>
<p>But if you still wanted to go back,</p>
<p>if you still wanted to go back or return or whatever,</p>
<p>however you wanna put it,</p>
<p>then you could have more control</p>
<p>over what your next birth might be</p>
<p>versus in this depiction of things,</p>
<p>people running from demons that they don&rsquo;t recognize</p>
<p>as their own projection into any fucking body</p>
<p>that they can find.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;ve had a body, you want a body.</p>
<p>And so this is how you can incarnate as an animal.</p>
<p>This is how you can incarnate in the hell realms.</p>
<p>This is how you can incarnate in any variety of things.</p>
<p>But the idea is like maybe you could slow down a little bit</p>
<p>and like choose a birth</p>
<p>that is gonna be more conducive to you</p>
<p>continuing to like spiritually evolve.</p>
<p>I like that idea.</p>
<p>Is it true or not?</p>
<p>Who the fuck knows?</p>
<p>Algorithmically speaking,</p>
<p>it seems like a really fun role playing game</p>
<p>where you basically keep improving</p>
<p>the different parameters based on your ability</p>
<p>and willingness to meditate</p>
<p>and let go of the menial concerns of life on earth.</p>
<p>Why do you think Buddhists see life as suffering?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s suffering?</p>
<p>Okay, well, first of all,</p>
<p>that gets mistranslated quite a bit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about the four noble truths.</p>
<p>The first one is,</p>
<p>often it&rsquo;s translated as life is suffering,</p>
<p>which is not it, it&rsquo;s there is suffering.</p>
<p>The whole life is suffering thing</p>
<p>is just like a spiritual version of life&rsquo;s a bitch,</p>
<p>then you die.</p>
<p>And people hear that and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yeah, life is fucking suffering,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s there is suffering, there is suffering.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an affirmation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like this thing that a lot of people feel</p>
<p>that they associate with lots of,</p>
<p>they have a lot of reasons they think they&rsquo;re feeling it</p>
<p>is known as fundamental dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>So another word for suffering,</p>
<p>maybe it could be fundamental dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Also, the term itself,</p>
<p>maybe a better translation is wobbly wheel.</p>
<p>So like, imagine like when your bike doesn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>or your car doesn&rsquo;t have enough air in the tires,</p>
<p>your bike doesn&rsquo;t have enough air in the tires,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a shitty bike ride.</p>
<p>Like no matter what, it&rsquo;s kind of like uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like irritating.</p>
<p>So this is what&rsquo;s being pointed to</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s this quality within a human life</p>
<p>that is unsatisfying.</p>
<p>Like a wobbly wheel.</p>
<p>Wobbly wheel.</p>
<p>Why do you think, what is the core of that dissatisfaction?</p>
<p>Because it could be as simple as kind of physical</p>
<p>and mental discomfort and sadness and depression</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Or it could be more speaking to the sort of existentialist,</p>
<p>the philosophical, the absurdity of it all.</p>
<p>The fact that stuff happens,</p>
<p>good stuff happens for no reason,</p>
<p>bad stuff happens for no reason.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s no matter how much you try,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a universal fairness to the whole thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not even a universal meaning to the whole thing.</p>
<p>So the existentialist perspective.</p>
<p>What flavor of suffering do you prefer?</p>
<p>If it was an ice cream shop.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m definitely picking desire over the,</p>
<p>like if in the RGB that we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>is desire, aversion and ignorance.</p>
<p>So if you want to find like the three ingredients</p>
<p>that are giving everyone their sophisticated bits</p>
<p>of suffering, there you go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>In which way does desire manifest itself in suffering?</p>
<p>It hurts.</p>
<p>To lose, to not have.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, it hurts to not, like to eternally not have,</p>
<p>but just like my friend pointed this out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you know, like you order something from Amazon.</p>
<p>Like even in the smallest way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re excited about whatever the thing is.</p>
<p>You order this thing from Amazon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not coming for four days.</p>
<p>So those four days are going to be somewhat marked</p>
<p>by you being what people say, I&rsquo;m excited about it.</p>
<p>But really, if you look at that feeling, it&rsquo;s uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Like the feeling of wanting the thing is uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So that is a form of suffering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s suffering.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I wonder,</p>
<p>cause we naturally reframe that in our mind, wanting.</p>
<p>We reframe that as a good thing.</p>
<p>As a, and maybe suffering is fundamentally good</p>
<p>in the way we think of what life is.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s life affirming,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not usually how the word suffering is used.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Like the first noble truth of Buddhism is true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the truth of suffering.</p>
<p>There is suffering.</p>
<p>I mean, this is like an, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>an element that you can&rsquo;t break it down any further than that.</p>
<p>Like there is suffering, this is truth.</p>
<p>So if you think, you know, and again,</p>
<p>assigning like good or bad to truth,</p>
<p>I think maybe there&rsquo;s more of a sort of neutrality there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truth.</p>
<p>I mean, is it any, is it basically,</p>
<p>is suffering any disturbance from stillness?</p>
<p>Is suffering then?</p>
<p>Like basically any, anything that happens in life that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, that perturbs the system.</p>
<p>Ripples in the empty. Ripples.</p>
<p>Ripples, yeah.</p>
<p>So a still lake is empty of suffering,</p>
<p>but any kind of ripple is suffering in that sense.</p>
<p>A still lake is empty of suffering.</p>
<p>You sound like a Zen master.</p>
<p>It seems like something a Zen master might say.</p>
<p>If I can just grow a beard like yours.</p>
<p>Ah, no, the beard doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>We would, we would.</p>
<p>If I had your chin, you think I&rsquo;d have a fucking beard?</p>
<p>I look like a stork.</p>
<p>You should see me.</p>
<p>If I had your chin, there&rsquo;d be no beard here.</p>
<p>You have a symmetrical, nice chin.</p>
<p>This is the closest I can come to plastic surgery.</p>
<p>Pubic plastic surgery, friend.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you know you&rsquo;re a professional comedian.</p>
<p>Yeah, so suffering.</p>
<p>There is suffering.</p>
<p>And the lake analogy is pretty good because the,</p>
<p>um, what&rsquo;s happening here is that,</p>
<p>that we have become identified</p>
<p>with something that we call a self.</p>
<p>So this, the self is just accepted.</p>
<p>I have a self, I have an identity,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a person, I have a self.</p>
<p>But when you start doing scans to try to find yourself,</p>
<p>which is the entire thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to find myself.</p>
<p>You get in a van, go to California, take some acid,</p>
<p>fuck a prostitute on the bus or whatever Kerouac did.</p>
<p>Too far?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to find myself.</p>
<p>Oh, he didn&rsquo;t, she wasn&rsquo;t a prostitute,</p>
<p>just to correct the record.</p>
<p>Oh, previously a prostitute.</p>
<p>I guess once a prostitute, always a prostitute.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a former prostitute.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>No, and look, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not a sign,</p>
<p>look, all I&rsquo;m saying is, uh, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>Who has a bit of prostitute?</p>
<p>God, I used to be one of them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all kind of a kind of prostitute.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes, yes.</p>
<p>But the.</p>
<p>We make love and we make money.</p>
<p>Therefore, we&rsquo;re all a kind of prostitute.</p>
<p>We make, God, how great.</p>
<p>I would really love to be able to make money by fucking.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s maybe not directly, but in some sense.</p>
<p>Directly.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Do you accept Venmo or?</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never too late to start.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so, sort of one of the ways in</p>
<p>is this sort of contemplation of the identity,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, uh, you know, what is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just the desire, it&rsquo;s what is having the desire?</p>
<p>Where, where does the desire live in?</p>
<p>Like, what doesn&rsquo;t want to be where it&rsquo;s at?</p>
<p>What is the thing that is like desperately wanting</p>
<p>to get out of the situation it&rsquo;s in?</p>
<p>And then, um, as far as ignorance, uh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still something that&rsquo;s theoretically happening</p>
<p>to an identity.</p>
<p>So, so wrapped up in it is really just this sort of like,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where we run into what, uh, into attachment.</p>
<p>So if, if the first noble truth of Buddhism</p>
<p>is there is suffering,</p>
<p>the second noble truth of Buddhism is, um,</p>
<p>the cause of this suffering is attachment.</p>
<p>And so people hear that and they take it, that&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of levels to that concept.</p>
<p>Definitely the cause of suffering is attachment.</p>
<p>Like, God, I just got addicted to vapes.</p>
<p>Is there a more embarrassing addiction than vapes?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smoking like a little purple thing.</p>
<p>It tastes like sugar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s attachment.</p>
<p>It is, there is suffering.</p>
<p>I want it.</p>
<p>I have to charge it now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m embarrassed by it.</p>
<p>It makes me feel out of control.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of suffering,</p>
<p>but also there&rsquo;s deeper levels of attachment</p>
<p>that go all the way to this attachment</p>
<p>to the sense of one&rsquo;s self.</p>
<p>And I think the existentialists do get into this idea</p>
<p>in a different way, which is like,</p>
<p>because I think I&rsquo;m a me,</p>
<p>now I have to push what that thing is out into the world</p>
<p>through my actions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a kind of attachment too.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that leads to the third noble truth,</p>
<p>which is get rid of attachment</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t suffer anymore.</p>
<p>Uh, that&rsquo;s, it seems logical,</p>
<p>but you know, it is a very,</p>
<p>it is a mathematical analysis</p>
<p>of this particular problem of suffering it&rsquo;s addressing.</p>
<p>And then the fourth noble truth</p>
<p>is the eightfold path of Buddhism,</p>
<p>which is like a process by which one could unencumber oneself</p>
<p>from this identification with something that isn&rsquo;t real.</p>
<p>Do you need a bathroom break?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a funny moment, I was running in the heat yesterday</p>
<p>listening to Gulag Archipelago.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a, which was a very welcome break</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m looking for any excuse to stop whatsoever.</p>
<p>The gentleman, very nice gentleman stopped me saying,</p>
<p>recognized me and just said a bunch of friendly things.</p>
<p>And then he mentioned as one of the people</p>
<p>who really inspires him is Duncan Trussell.</p>
<p>And I was, I mean, I&rsquo;m the same way and I told him,</p>
<p>you know, tomorrow, it felt like a name drop.</p>
<p>I name dropped you this morning.</p>
<p>I was like, tomorrow I&rsquo;m going to get to meet him.</p>
<p>So he says, he says, hi.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, oh, and he said that he watched</p>
<p>Midnight Gospel on mushrooms.</p>
<p>And it was like the greatest mushroom experience</p>
<p>of his life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was nervous about meeting you, man.</p>
<p>Like I have so much respect for you.</p>
<p>And like, oh yeah, I name dropped.</p>
<p>I was saying I&rsquo;m going on Lex&rsquo;s podcast today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you look, we&rsquo;re so lucky we all live here.</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all living in Austin together.</p>
<p>Like I, I somehow like missed that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s, we all got to hang out.</p>
<p>We all have to like start doing stuff.</p>
<p>Well, you have to really,</p>
<p>also you have to appreciate this moment.</p>
<p>I remember, I know some people are less sentimental</p>
<p>than others, but I remember sitting with Joe Rogan</p>
<p>and with Eric Weinstein, I believe it was.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And at the back of the comedy store</p>
<p>shortly before COVID, I think.</p>
<p>And just thinking like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way these things will last.</p>
<p>And these things meaning the comedy store,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan, the Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>like a, like a pocket influential podcasting person.</p>
<p>Also a person like in this room, in this space,</p>
<p>the ability to just talk for hours</p>
<p>and lose ourselves in this moment.</p>
<p>It just felt ephemeral, somehow temporary.</p>
<p>And I just wanted to capture that moment somehow.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s where the temptation to take a picture</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re that kind of stuff</p>
<p>or record a podcast comes from.</p>
<p>But it just felt like it would be, it&rsquo;d be gone forever.</p>
<p>Of course, Joe doesn&rsquo;t seem to have</p>
<p>that kind of sentimental.</p>
<p>No, sure, no, no.</p>
<p>Just wherever you end up,</p>
<p>you just enjoy the shit out of it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Well, and that&rsquo;s something you have to cultivate.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s not an easy,</p>
<p>the thing you&rsquo;re talking about, you know,</p>
<p>God, have you seen these?</p>
<p>I think the best analogy for what you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these videos where people give like a sugar cube</p>
<p>to a raccoon, but the raccoons, they wash their food.</p>
<p>So raccoon, or I think it&rsquo;s cotton candy.</p>
<p>They give the raccoon cotton candy,</p>
<p>immediately it washes the cotton candy.</p>
<p>And of course the cotton candy dissolves in the water.</p>
<p>And the raccoon is like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Like, you know, and the thing you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>that grasping you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the raccoon washing the cotton candy.</p>
<p>Like the moment you get into the grasping part,</p>
<p>you paradoxically have pulled yourself out of the moment</p>
<p>that inspired the grasping part.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s some people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the entirety of their lives trying to record.</p>
<p>I mean, Jesus, man, you ever see people film fireworks</p>
<p>on the 4th of July with their phone?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most remarkable aspects of human behavior,</p>
<p>which is like, you know they&rsquo;re not gonna watch</p>
<p>the fireworks on their phone.</p>
<p>Only a lunatic would do that.</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s gonna go back and look at fireworks, but.</p>
<p>So, but we&rsquo;re also in this position where,</p>
<p>because of podcasting, there is some aspect</p>
<p>where you can record a magical moment in time</p>
<p>together between two people, or even just with a camera.</p>
<p>So to get back to the lake that you were talking about,</p>
<p>this is emptiness.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s emptiness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s known as emptiness.</p>
<p>The lake is emptiness.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we are, emptiness, emptiness.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another thing that gets very confused</p>
<p>in Buddhism is that emptiness.</p>
<p>And that emptiness is, that&rsquo;s to me,</p>
<p>like when I&rsquo;m going to do a podcast,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I try to go.</p>
<p>I try to go just in the moment, no agenda.</p>
<p>You know, if I am nervous or whatever,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;ll feel the nervousness,</p>
<p>but just in the, just drop into the moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when time changes.</p>
<p>And then you look up, hours have passed.</p>
<p>It feels like a second.</p>
<p>And the reason it feels like that is</p>
<p>because if you successfully dropped into the moment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the lake now, it&rsquo;s emptiness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s forever for a second.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re dipping into eternity.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s a very strange thing</p>
<p>to, as part of that, record it, you know,</p>
<p>as part of that, try to like grab it</p>
<p>and put it out there, but it works.</p>
<p>Can you speak to that, to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour?</p>
<p>Can you speak about that purple lavender world you go to</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s most intense and successful for you,</p>
<p>when you feel a sense of lightness and happiness</p>
<p>when it works, whether it&rsquo;s your own</p>
<p>or a conversation with Joe in general,</p>
<p>or is, well, yours is very specific</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s audio only.</p>
<p>Maybe you can also speak to that.</p>
<p>Because you might as well be naked</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t have to, you have to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re free of the conventions of the real world.</p>
<p>I will never stop thinking it&rsquo;s remarkable.</p>
<p>Like the fact that I&rsquo;m talking to you, to me,</p>
<p>seems remarkable, not just technologically,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m talking to someone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming I&rsquo;m allowed to say this,</p>
<p>who has robot dogs that I&rsquo;ve been watching</p>
<p>for years evolve on YouTube.</p>
<p>Arms reach away from one of these things, you know?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m with somebody who is like an acclaimed genius.</p>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s like, oh my God,</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s, what, why do I get to have this conversation?</p>
<p>Why do I get to be here?</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;d be like a line,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be a line that would just wrapped</p>
<p>and wrapped and wrapped around this building</p>
<p>of people who&rsquo;d love a chance to just chat with you.</p>
<p>And so when I, with my podcast,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how I feel like when I&rsquo;m talking to these guests,</p>
<p>you know, who have spent, you know,</p>
<p>some of them have like spent their entire lifetime</p>
<p>meditating, you know, studying specific aspects of Buddhism</p>
<p>or even when I&rsquo;m with, you know,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m with comedians who I like consider</p>
<p>to be brilliantly funny.</p>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s just like, God, I almost feel like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just created some sophisticated trap for cool people</p>
<p>where like I get to like hang out with them.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like sitting in the gratitude of it,</p>
<p>just feeling lucky.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, feeling lucky</p>
<p>and wrestling with imposter syndrome, you know,</p>
<p>trying to like get that part of myself</p>
<p>to shut up long enough so I could be in that moment</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about, you know?</p>
<p>And then I carry that with me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just like you stop the podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some of the things these people tell me</p>
<p>or some of the ways they are, like it becomes part of me.</p>
<p>And then I get to have a life or this thing</p>
<p>that they gave me is in me forever.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s cool how conversation can just,</p>
<p>a few sentences can change the direction of your life.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re listening,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re there to be transformed by the words,</p>
<p>they will do the work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s the full mix of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually when, if you look up to somebody,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s true for me at least,</p>
<p>I think it is for you that you start to look up</p>
<p>to basically everybody you talk to.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, good sign.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good sign.</p>
<p>God forbid it goes the other way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>
<p>If all of a sudden you start looking down on people,</p>
<p>because whatever crazy metric you&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>ooh, that would freak me out.</p>
<p>I do feel like that&rsquo;s a quality of getting older.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I really, like, I thought I was so smart.</p>
<p>Like I thought I had it all figured out.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going, your ego is just going,</p>
<p>taking a nose dive.</p>
<p>I would like to say it&rsquo;s my ego taking a nose dive.</p>
<p>Me and my friend talk about it a bunch.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just always associated it with like doing acid</p>
<p>for two decades straight.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m gonna just assume I&rsquo;m just like slowly</p>
<p>like spiraling into senility, you know?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m just like, all the confidence,</p>
<p>all the like, oh, the certainty when you&rsquo;re having,</p>
<p>like in college, having the great,</p>
<p>oh, like, you know, you feel like you&rsquo;re a representative</p>
<p>of Camus or some shit.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>You read the myth of Sisyphus,</p>
<p>and now you like it, know all existentialism</p>
<p>and your certainty in regards to it is embarrassing,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t see it in that way.</p>
<p>You just feel certain.</p>
<p>And then that certainty, it just starts like,</p>
<p>it starts crumbling a little bit.</p>
<p>And then, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I get to actually intensely experience</p>
<p>that certainty in many communities,</p>
<p>but one in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Young folks with the certainty that this technology</p>
<p>will transform the world.</p>
<p>And I mean, this is almost one of the big communities</p>
<p>of the modern era where they believe</p>
<p>that this will really solve so many of the problems</p>
<p>of the world, and they believe in it very intensely.</p>
<p>And aside from the technology and the details of the thing,</p>
<p>all I see is the certainty and the passion in their eyes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll stop me.</p>
<p>Let me explain you, let me just give me a chance</p>
<p>to tell you why this thing is extremely powerful.</p>
<p>And I just get to enjoy the glow of that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, wow, I miss having that certainty</p>
<p>about anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably come over for me too.</p>
<p>But when I was younger, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>only I deeply understand the relationship of man</p>
<p>to his mortality.</p>
<p>And I understood that most deeply, I think,</p>
<p>when I was like 16 or 17.</p>
<p>And I am the representative of the human condition.</p>
<p>And all these adults with their busyness of day to day life</p>
<p>and their concerns, they don&rsquo;t deeply understand</p>
<p>what I understand, which is the only thing that matters</p>
<p>is the absurdity of the human condition.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And let me quote you some Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>Oh boy, and you speak Russian.</p>
<p>Yes, I speak Russian.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve read the Brothers Karamazov in Russian.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have to admit that I read</p>
<p>all of the Dostoevsky in English.</p>
<p>I came to this country when I was 13.</p>
<p>And at least don&rsquo;t remember, we read a lot,</p>
<p>but we read Tolstoy, Pushkin, a lot of the Russian literature</p>
<p>but it was in Russian.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t remember reading Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>I wonder at which point does the Russian education system</p>
<p>give you Dostoevsky?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s pretty heavy stuff.</p>
<p>Second grade, it&rsquo;s probably the second grade.</p>
<p>Russians are intense.</p>
<p>Yes, they are, they very much are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember reading Dostoevsky,</p>
<p>but I did tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent.</p>
<p>I traveled to Paris recently on the way to Ukraine</p>
<p>and was scheduled to talk to Richard Pevere</p>
<p>and this pair that translate Dostoevsky, Tolstoy,</p>
<p>just this famous pair that translate</p>
<p>most of Russian literature to English.</p>
<p>And I was planning to have a sequence of five, 10,</p>
<p>15 hour conversation with them about the different details</p>
<p>of all the translations and so on.</p>
<p>I just found myself in a very dark place mentally</p>
<p>where I couldn&rsquo;t think about podcasts or anything like that.</p>
<p>It caught me off guard.</p>
<p>So I went to Paris and just laid there for a day.</p>
<p>Not just being stressed about Ukraine and all those kinds</p>
<p>of things, but I&rsquo;m still, the act of translation</p>
<p>is such a fascinating way to approach some of the deepest</p>
<p>questions that this literature raises,</p>
<p>which is like, how do I capture the essence of a sentence</p>
<p>that has so much power and translate it</p>
<p>into another language?</p>
<p>That act is actually really, really interesting.</p>
<p>And I found with my conversations with them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve really thought through this stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about language,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the ideas in those books.</p>
<p>And that also really makes me sad</p>
<p>because I wonder how much is lost in translation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently, so when I was in Ukraine,</p>
<p>I talked to a lot of, like half the conversations I had</p>
<p>on the record were in Russian,</p>
<p>and basically 100% of the record were in Russian</p>
<p>in Russian versus in English.</p>
<p>And just so much is lost in those languages.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m now struggling because I&rsquo;m launching</p>
<p>a Russian channel where there&rsquo;ll be a Russian</p>
<p>overdub of Duncan.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Your wow will now be translated into Russian.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Russian wow?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;ll just be wow probably.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry for the difficulties</p>
<p>of having to translate wow.</p>
<p>Usually probably with wow they&rsquo;ll leave it unoverdubbed</p>
<p>because people understand exactly what you mean.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an art form, and it&rsquo;s a weird art form.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how do you capture the chemistry,</p>
<p>the excitement, the, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe the humor, the implied kind of wit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s just layers of complexity</p>
<p>in language that it&rsquo;s very difficult to capture.</p>
<p>And I wonder how, it is sad for me</p>
<p>because I know Russian, how much is lost in translation.</p>
<p>And the same, there&rsquo;s a brewing conflict</p>
<p>and tension with China now, and so much is lost</p>
<p>in the translation between those languages.</p>
<p>Oh my God, yeah.</p>
<p>And cultures, the entire, the music of the people</p>
<p>is completely lost because we don&rsquo;t know the language,</p>
<p>or most of us don&rsquo;t know the language.</p>
<p>Yeah, how much of the conflict</p>
<p>is just problems in translation?</p>
<p>How much of all these problems that we&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>are just the alien sense of this or that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just as simple as that.</p>
<p>Words are getting just a tiny warp away from the intent</p>
<p>of if, when we both speak the same language,</p>
<p>we can still say something that offends someone</p>
<p>when you never intended that at all.</p>
<p>How much more so when like it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>not only is it a completely different sound,</p>
<p>but the script itself is different.</p>
<p>Like what is, the Russian writing,</p>
<p>is it called Cyrillic or what&rsquo;s the name?</p>
<p>Yeah, Cyrillic.</p>
<p>Cyrillic, and I don&rsquo;t know the name for Chinese writing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a continuum that like gets weirder</p>
<p>and weirder looking, you know?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, so yeah.</p>
<p>Or less weird depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure depending on where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m definitely, I&rsquo;m about the farthest thing</p>
<p>from a polyglot as there could be, man.</p>
<p>Like, but I&rsquo;ll tell you, at one point</p>
<p>when I was getting fascinated by Dostoevsky,</p>
<p>I did have this very transient fantasy</p>
<p>about learning Russian so that I could like understand</p>
<p>the difference and it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You were 17, 18 at the time.</p>
<p>College.</p>
<p>Yeah, college.</p>
<p>Yeah, Brothers Karamazov lost in that book.</p>
<p>Just like, oh God.</p>
<p>So in love with it is.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s definitely like, you know, Ukraine,</p>
<p>and this is what a lot of the war is about is saying,</p>
<p>you know, Ukraine and Russia are not the same people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a strong culture in Ukraine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a strong culture in Russia.</p>
<p>But you know, I know because that&rsquo;s where my family&rsquo;s from,</p>
<p>there is a fascinating, strong culture.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s such strong cultures everywhere else too.</p>
<p>Ireland has a culture, Scotland has a culture.</p>
<p>Even like on a tiny island, you just have these like,</p>
<p>subcultures that are more powerful than anything</p>
<p>existing in human history.</p>
<p>Like the Bronx, I don&rsquo;t know, like Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Like different parts of New York have a certain culture.</p>
<p>And then New York versus LA versus, well.</p>
<p>And then certain places are looking for their culture.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t, I think Austin, I don&rsquo;t know what Austin is.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a traditional Austin,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s evolving constantly.</p>
<p>Same with Boston, a place I spent a lot of time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a traditional Boston and now it&rsquo;s evolving</p>
<p>with the different younger people coming from university</p>
<p>and staying and all of that is evolving.</p>
<p>But underneath it, there&rsquo;s a core,</p>
<p>like the American ideal of the value of the individual,</p>
<p>the value of freedom, of freedom of speech,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things that permeates all of that.</p>
<p>And the same thing in the history of World War II</p>
<p>permeates Ukraine and Russia, a lot of parts of Europe,</p>
<p>the memories of all that suffering and destruction,</p>
<p>the broken promises of governments</p>
<p>and the occupier versus the liberator,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>All that permeates the culture.</p>
<p>That affects how cynical or optimistic you are,</p>
<p>or how much you appreciate material possessions</p>
<p>versus human connection, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, I mean, this is like, talk about absurdity.</p>
<p>I mean, this is, war is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what absurdity looks like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some kind of organized madness.</p>
<p>None of it makes sense, like all of it,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just, none of it makes sense,</p>
<p>but it does, but it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously you&rsquo;re defending yourself</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re taking orders that if you don&rsquo;t take,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to jail.</p>
<p>And so, or somewhere in between,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a classic story about this.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a bullshit myth about World War II.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure everyone&rsquo;s heard it because it comes up,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s Christmas Eve and they have a ceasefire.</p>
<p>And then I think they played soccer,</p>
<p>they sing Christmas songs,</p>
<p>and then they had to force them into fighting again.</p>
<p>And so when those moments happen, the,</p>
<p>are you familiar with Hakeem Bey?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a controversial figure.</p>
<p>Sadly, like he, like, I think he was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to defame him</p>
<p>because I haven&rsquo;t like researched it correctly,</p>
<p>but some people have said shit,</p>
<p>but since I don&rsquo;t know the reference, I&rsquo;m not going to.</p>
<p>But regardless, I mean, you know, look,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but Bill Cosby was funny.</p>
<p>You know, like that&rsquo;s a funny comedian,</p>
<p>but you know the other stuff.</p>
<p>Michael Jackson, he could fucking dance.</p>
<p>And sing.</p>
<p>And sing, but there&rsquo;s some other stuff.</p>
<p>But regardless, Hakeem Bey came up with the idea</p>
<p>of something called a temporary autonomous zone,</p>
<p>which is that within a structure, a cultural structure,</p>
<p>a temporary bubble of freedom will appear</p>
<p>that by its nature gets sort of popped</p>
<p>by the bigger bubble,</p>
<p>or it runs out of resources generally is what happens.</p>
<p>So these things will appear just out of the blue</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s almost like, imagine if like on earth</p>
<p>in some tiny little bit of earth,</p>
<p>the gravitational field was reduced by some percentage.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you could jump really high or whatever,</p>
<p>but it wouldn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that culturally, all the restrictions</p>
<p>and the darkness and the heaviness and all of it</p>
<p>for a second, somehow this bubble appears</p>
<p>where humans come together as the hippie ideal.</p>
<p>Brothers, sisters, just humans, earthlings</p>
<p>instead of American, Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian</p>
<p>temporary autonomous zone, it gets crushed</p>
<p>by the default reality that it was appearing in.</p>
<p>But somehow within that space,</p>
<p>you witness the possibility, the possibility,</p>
<p>the frustrating possibility that anyone who&rsquo;s thought</p>
<p>about humanity knows this possibility,</p>
<p>which is like, it seems like we can just get along.</p>
<p>Like it does seem like we&rsquo;re pretty much the same thing</p>
<p>and that we can just get along.</p>
<p>Those moments are really rare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>I talked to a lot of soldiers, a lot of people</p>
<p>that suffered through the different aspects of that war.</p>
<p>Or war, and there&rsquo;s an information war</p>
<p>that convinces each side that the other</p>
<p>is not just the enemy, but less than human.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a real hatred towards the other side.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And those kind of little moments where you realize,</p>
<p>oh, they&rsquo;re human like me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And not just like human like me,</p>
<p>but they have the same values as me.</p>
<p>And this woman who was a really respected soldier,</p>
<p>she specializes in anti tank missiles.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s very kind of, very pragmatic,</p>
<p>very the enemy is the enemy, you have to destroy the enemy</p>
<p>and saying like, there&rsquo;s no compassion towards the enemy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not human.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re less than human.</p>
<p>But she said there was a moment when she remembers</p>
<p>an enemy soldier in a tank took a risk</p>
<p>to save a fellow soldier.</p>
<p>And that risk was really stupid because he was facing,</p>
<p>he was going to get destroyed.</p>
<p>And then she said that she tried to shoot a rocket</p>
<p>at that tank and she missed.</p>
<p>And then she later went home and she couldn&rsquo;t sleep</p>
<p>that she missed.</p>
<p>How could she screw that up?</p>
<p>But then she realized that actually she missed,</p>
<p>maybe she missed on purpose.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because she realized that that man, just like she is,</p>
<p>was a hero, just like she strives to be.</p>
<p>They were both heroes defending their own.</p>
<p>And in that way, he was just like her.</p>
<p>She was like, that&rsquo;s the only time I remember during this</p>
<p>war ever feeling like this is another human being.</p>
<p>But that was a very brief moment for her.</p>
<p>And I just hear that over and over and over again.</p>
<p>These romantic notions we have of we&rsquo;re one,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all just human.</p>
<p>Unfortunately during war, those notions are rare.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite sad.</p>
<p>And war in a certain way really destroys those notions.</p>
<p>And one of the saddest things is it destroys it,</p>
<p>at least from what I see, potentially for generations.</p>
<p>Not just for those people for the rest of their life,</p>
<p>but for their children, their children&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>The hatred.</p>
<p>I mean, I ask that question of basically everyone,</p>
<p>which is will you ever forgive, asking of Ukrainians,</p>
<p>will you ever forgive the Russians?</p>
<p>Will, do you have hate in your heart towards the Russians?</p>
<p>Or do you have love for a fellow human being?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different ways that people struggle with that.</p>
<p>Different people, they saw that, they saw the love,</p>
<p>they saw the hate with their known heart.</p>
<p>And they struggle with the hate they have.</p>
<p>And they know they can overcome it in a period of weeks</p>
<p>and months after the war is over.</p>
<p>But some people said, no, this hate that was,</p>
<p>that showed up in February when the war started</p>
<p>will be with me forever.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, their kids got killed.</p>
<p>What the fuck are you gonna do about that?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got aphorisms and cute little stories about,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still in prison if you hate your former captors.</p>
<p>But man, I gotta tell you, if somebody hurt my kids,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not coming back.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no amount,</p>
<p>at least right now in my approximation,</p>
<p>of spiritual literature, meditation,</p>
<p>or anything that I can really think of</p>
<p>that is going to give me that kind of space.</p>
<p>Like, I think I imagine in the same way like,</p>
<p>I imagine I could probably run a marathon eventually,</p>
<p>but do I think I&rsquo;m ever gonna do that?</p>
<p>That times a million.</p>
<p>So man, all we can do is have compassion for their hate</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, what are you gonna say?</p>
<p>What are you gonna say to someone like that?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, you know, for the sake of humanity, let it go.</p>
<p>It was just your kids.</p>
<p>It was just something you loved</p>
<p>more than anything in the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never be okay again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have nightmares for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>But you should forgive.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, there is truth in the fact</p>
<p>that forgiveness is the way to let go, right?</p>
<p>But that truth is not, fuck you, right?</p>
<p>Which is why it&rsquo;s not your job to say that.</p>
<p>Not that you&rsquo;re doing that, I know you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>But you know, the problem with people like me,</p>
<p>early phase, you could get this stupid missionary thing</p>
<p>going where you like, start trying to like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like proselytize ideals</p>
<p>that you might be incapable of, you know?</p>
<p>And I just, hearing it, you know, that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>man, I saw this, the thing that like,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen a lot, all of us by now,</p>
<p>probably if we were online, I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>and you just saw it in person.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve seen things that are just horrific.</p>
<p>But as a dad, man, I just saw this clip of this kid</p>
<p>around the age of my kid, walking by himself,</p>
<p>these refugees, just walking by himself,</p>
<p>crying, the look on his face,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t explain the look on his face.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what happened to his parents.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what happened.</p>
<p>Like I, it was so upsetting.</p>
<p>Like even thinking about it now, it&rsquo;s just like, fuck,</p>
<p>that could have been my kid.</p>
<p>That could have been my kid, you know?</p>
<p>So knowing that kind of, that,</p>
<p>that kid&rsquo;s gotta grow up now.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, is the kid&rsquo;s parents still there?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just one of countless orphans out there now.</p>
<p>So what you have this hate,</p>
<p>and the question is how to direct it.</p>
<p>Because the choice is you can direct it</p>
<p>towards the politicians that started the war.</p>
<p>You can direct it towards the soldiers</p>
<p>that are doing the killing,</p>
<p>or you can direct it towards an entire group of people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the struggle because hate slowly grows</p>
<p>to where you don&rsquo;t just hate the soldiers.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just hate the leaders.</p>
<p>You hate all Russians because they&rsquo;re all equally evil</p>
<p>because the ones that aren&rsquo;t doing the fighting</p>
<p>are staying quiet.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure the same kind of stories are happening</p>
<p>on the other side.</p>
<p>And so there is, that hate is one</p>
<p>that is deeply human,</p>
<p>but you wonder for your own future, for your own home,</p>
<p>for building your own community,</p>
<p>for building your own country,</p>
<p>how does that hate morph over the weeks and months and years?</p>
<p>Not into forgiveness, but into something that&rsquo;s productive</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t destroy you.</p>
<p>Because hate does destroy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dark aspect of a rocket that hits a building</p>
<p>and kills hundreds of people.</p>
<p>The worst effect of that rocket</p>
<p>is the hate in the hearts of the loved ones</p>
<p>to the people that were in that building.</p>
<p>That hate is a torture over a period of years after.</p>
<p>And that it doesn&rsquo;t just torture</p>
<p>by having that psychological burden and trauma.</p>
<p>It also tortures because it destroys your life.</p>
<p>It prevents you from being able to enjoy your life</p>
<p>to the fullest.</p>
<p>It prevents you from being able to flourish as a human being,</p>
<p>as a professional, in all those kinds of ways</p>
<p>that humans can flourish.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a, there is an aspect where this naive notion</p>
<p>is really powerful, that love and forgiveness</p>
<p>is the thing that&rsquo;s needed in this time.</p>
<p>And when I talk to soldiers, they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I remember bringing up to Jaco,</p>
<p>is there a sense where the people you&rsquo;re fighting</p>
<p>are just brothers in arms,</p>
<p>bringing up the Dire Straits song, Brothers in Arms?</p>
<p>And he was basically, without swearing, saying fuck that,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re the enemy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, he&rsquo;s literally in survival mode.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t think like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna create latency in the system</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna lower his survivability.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about cognitively.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have latency.</p>
<p>Like, if you&rsquo;re, that one moment of hesitation,</p>
<p>you see it sometimes in these YouTube videos</p>
<p>of like somebody, a new cop has been unfortunate enough</p>
<p>to run into something that is a phenomenon, suicide by cop.</p>
<p>Somebody has a knife and that person is running towards them</p>
<p>with a knife and they&rsquo;re begging the person to stop,</p>
<p>that you can hear it in their voice.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re begging, stop, stop, stop, stop.</p>
<p>And the person is not gonna stop.</p>
<p>So the critique of that is that that latency</p>
<p>could potentially not just lead to the cop getting killed,</p>
<p>but to that person with a knife killing other people.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I get, if I were out there,</p>
<p>I think that like, you probably just as a matter</p>
<p>of like not getting shot and being fully in the moment,</p>
<p>you have to be like that.</p>
<p>I would guess, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m the furthest thing</p>
<p>from a soldier there could be,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something Jack Kornfield,</p>
<p>this great Buddhist teacher says,</p>
<p>which is tend to the part of the garden you can touch.</p>
<p>Meaning this is where we&rsquo;re at right now.</p>
<p>Thank God you and I, though we are experiencing</p>
<p>some like ripples from what&rsquo;s going on over there,</p>
<p>everyone is, we&rsquo;re not there.</p>
<p>And thank God we don&rsquo;t have to come up</p>
<p>with the psychological program</p>
<p>for people going through that</p>
<p>to no longer be encumbered by that hate.</p>
<p>Thank God.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s just lazy or whatever,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, you know, for me,</p>
<p>I just, I have to bring it back to,</p>
<p>all right, well, here&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at now.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want there to be war.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hurt people, but yeah, I love what you said.</p>
<p>I think what you said is the, if anything,</p>
<p>is the most intelligent way of looking at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t pretend that you&rsquo;re not gonna feel</p>
<p>that hate, like you&rsquo;re gonna feel it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way around it.</p>
<p>Or like, cause that&rsquo;s even worse.</p>
<p>Cause then you&rsquo;re almost saying like something&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>with them for feeling the hate or, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>But more along the lines, if you can avoid applying</p>
<p>that hate to an entire country of people, then do that.</p>
<p>Like, just understand, we&rsquo;re talking about like a,</p>
<p>not everybody.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just easier, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Cognitively, it&rsquo;s somehow easier to think all Russians,</p>
<p>monsters, you know, all Russians,</p>
<p>all whatever the particular like thing is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re supposed to not like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier somehow, weirdly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think that&rsquo;d be more difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I guess the lesson is if you give in</p>
<p>to the easy solution, that&rsquo;s going to lead</p>
<p>to detrimental longterm effects.</p>
<p>So hate should be, it&rsquo;s such a powerful tool</p>
<p>that you should try to control it for your own sake.</p>
<p>Not because you owe anything to anybody,</p>
<p>but for your own psychological development over time.</p>
<p>Right, right, that&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it, fuck.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>In terms of dark places, you suffered from depression.</p>
<p>Where has been some of the darker places</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gone in your mind?</p>
<p>You know, I needed therapy, man.</p>
<p>I needed therapy for the longest time, I just didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>So because of that, I would go through like bouts</p>
<p>of like paralytic depression, like suicidal depression,</p>
<p>suicidal ideations that were more than just ideations.</p>
<p>I mean, I think like people get afraid</p>
<p>when the thought of suicide appears in their consciousness,</p>
<p>they get really scared of themselves.</p>
<p>So they think there&rsquo;s something like,</p>
<p>fuck, what&rsquo;s going on with me?</p>
<p>Why would I think that?</p>
<p>But I think if we are suffering and, you know,</p>
<p>as a natural part of not wanting to reduce suffering</p>
<p>or not feel bad anymore, I mean, suicide is going to be an,</p>
<p>like, if we&rsquo;re just, you know, you&rsquo;re just looking,</p>
<p>what are all the options?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s brainstorm here.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I could start drinking more water.</p>
<p>You start jogging, get some therapy, call my friends,</p>
<p>all the stuff we all hear.</p>
<p>Or I could just, I think the height</p>
<p>of my apartment building is probably the,</p>
<p>definitely the right height to kill myself.</p>
<p>And then, so where, for me, like the few times</p>
<p>where the ideation has gone towards like,</p>
<p>well, when would I do that?</p>
<p>How do I, what, you know, what do I need</p>
<p>to like accomplish that?</p>
<p>When then like, that&rsquo;s where it gets really fucking scary.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s like terrifying.</p>
<p>And so you start the actual details of the planning</p>
<p>of how to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to be the least painful way to do it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to be the most instantaneous way to do it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, you know, and with, you know,</p>
<p>with depression, because it can be progressive,</p>
<p>you know, this is why you have to really just stay</p>
<p>on top of it.</p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s gone through depression</p>
<p>knows what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>You gotta stay on top of it.</p>
<p>Like you might need medication.</p>
<p>You know, I know this is controversial now,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still better than dying if you ask me.</p>
<p>But at some point with depression,</p>
<p>it like becomes paralyzing.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to get out of bed anymore</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not taking showers anymore.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want to talk to anybody anymore.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not answering your phone anymore.</p>
<p>And, you know.</p>
<p>So like in a dark place that you might be in,</p>
<p>it still might get worse.</p>
<p>So you should really do everything you can</p>
<p>to get under control.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem with that specific</p>
<p>psychological disorder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Because the things it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if you start listening to what you want to,</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s you, it&rsquo;s the depression.</p>
<p>You start listening to it.</p>
<p>It wants you to stay in bed.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re getting those fucking depression sleeps,</p>
<p>you know, or you wake up and you&rsquo;re more tired.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to escape reality by sleeping.</p>
<p>And so, yeah.</p>
<p>Like you have to like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fighting for your,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re literally fighting for your life.</p>
<p>It might not seem like that.</p>
<p>Cause you can&rsquo;t, if you could see depression,</p>
<p>if you could see it,</p>
<p>if you knew you had some inky, vaporous octopus thing</p>
<p>that was just wrapping around you</p>
<p>more and more and more and more,</p>
<p>you would probably do everything you could</p>
<p>to rip that fucking thing off your body.</p>
<p>And if you couldn&rsquo;t get it off your body,</p>
<p>you would be calling people to get help.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a fight because you&rsquo;re exhausted.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to move.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, you don&rsquo;t see the meaning for any of it.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a battle, but it is a battle.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not feeling.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re basically not feeling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, you start going numb.</p>
<p>At least that was my experience with it.</p>
<p>Numb and tired.</p>
<p>And then increasingly numb and tired.</p>
<p>And then increasingly sort of disconnecting from reality.</p>
<p>And then somewhere in there,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you start playing around with the idea</p>
<p>of like, oh, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Now, you know, I think compared to some of my friends</p>
<p>who haven&rsquo;t survived,</p>
<p>obviously who haven&rsquo;t survived depression,</p>
<p>like mine was definitely not whatever theirs was like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard, I mean, to understand it for folks out there,</p>
<p>maybe you haven&rsquo;t gone through it.</p>
<p>Just imagine if like, how bad you have to feel</p>
<p>if death is the solution,</p>
<p>like violence against yourself</p>
<p>so that you die is the solution.</p>
<p>Like just, it flies in the face of everything.</p>
<p>So yeah, that was definitely the darkest place</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
<p>Just that death doesn&rsquo;t seem like, because you don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about anything anymore,</p>
<p>that death just doesn&rsquo;t seem like that bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not able to appropriately assign</p>
<p>the negative costs to the solution.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It just seems like a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think also what&rsquo;s going along with it</p>
<p>is like, it&rsquo;s not like your brain isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not thinking,</p>
<p>obviously you&rsquo;re not thinking clearly.</p>
<p>Like, at least again, this was my experience of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fog.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in some kind of, like you&rsquo;re confused.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s confusion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s shame.</p>
<p>You feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>You wanna get out of bed.</p>
<p>You wanna do stuff.</p>
<p>You wanna be compelled to be social and do all this stuff,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Like you seem, if people don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not telling them because you&rsquo;re embarrassed,</p>
<p>because you want to have some like,</p>
<p>you know, uncorrupted, unworped psyche,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re like, it invites you to be secret about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of its first tricks</p>
<p>is it tells you not to tell anybody.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s deadly in that case, it&rsquo;s deadly.</p>
<p>What was the source of light?</p>
<p>What was the, what were for you</p>
<p>and in general the ways out?</p>
<p>Yeah, so for me, the solutions,</p>
<p>and again, man, for my depressed friends out there,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t get mad at me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing the thing of like,</p>
<p>just put on a smile or any of that bullshit</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t feel like that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like, and when you&rsquo;re fighting it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you are, you&rsquo;re in a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I keep using these stupid gravity analogies,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like the gravity&rsquo;s been turned up on your planet</p>
<p>in every single way by, so getting out of bed.</p>
<p>You know, like.</p>
<p>By the way, gravity and quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>one of the most beautiful things about our reality,</p>
<p>what the hell is each of those things?</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re not just talking about</p>
<p>hippie language, it&rsquo;s still physicists</p>
<p>pretend they understand something.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still at the very beginning of understanding</p>
<p>this mysterious world of ours</p>
<p>that seems to be functioning according</p>
<p>to these weirdly simple and yet universally powerful laws,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t fully yet understand.</p>
<p>So please, the metaphor and the analogy of gravity.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p>Fully, fully applicable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know any other way to put it</p>
<p>than it&rsquo;s like somebody turned the gravitational field</p>
<p>of your mattress up by.</p>
<p>So everything is heavy.</p>
<p>Heavy, your body&rsquo;s heavy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna get out of bed,</p>
<p>you will consider shitting or pissing the bed</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just like, who gives a fuck,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just lay in my shit and piss.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dying, you&rsquo;re like, none of it makes sense.</p>
<p>And I feel like in retrospect,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making what I&rsquo;ve done a little,</p>
<p>like I had more lucidity.</p>
<p>It was more of like when you&rsquo;re wrestling with someone</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just like, it&rsquo;s different for you.</p>
<p>But for me, if I&rsquo;m wrestling,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking about jujitsu moves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like.</p>
<p>Survival.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>It is a struggle.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like, you really have to deliberately fight.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>So you start, so you can almost have a conversation</p>
<p>with the depression.</p>
<p>And then what you do is you start doing the opposite</p>
<p>of everything it&rsquo;s telling you to do.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s telling you lay in bed.</p>
<p>So you get out of bed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely telling you don&rsquo;t fucking exercise.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna go fucking exercise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not gonna do anything.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You probably have a heart attack.</p>
<p>You really wanna go outside.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go fucking exercise.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll feel crazy.</p>
<p>And you won&rsquo;t wanna do it.</p>
<p>If you wanted to do it, you wouldn&rsquo;t be depressed.</p>
<p>Like how often do you hear</p>
<p>like one of the symptoms of depression?</p>
<p>You wanna jog.</p>
<p>You wanna get on a bike.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t hear that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a symptom.</p>
<p>So you start, at least one solution</p>
<p>I just started doing the opposite of.</p>
<p>Whatever the voice is telling you, do the opposite.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>And then suddenly the gravitational field</p>
<p>diminishes a little bit.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t go all the way away.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you can fall right back into it</p>
<p>cause you just feel even slightly better.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, okay, I fixed it.</p>
<p>You know, really, I think if you like</p>
<p>and having been through therapy, the best solution</p>
<p>would be go to a fucking therapist as quickly as you can.</p>
<p>Just sit down with them and tell them what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>How am I gonna find a therapist?</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>
<p>Google it, go on Yelp.</p>
<p>All of this shit feels impossible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t wanna turn on the computer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna do any of this.</p>
<p>You just have to.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to.</p>
<p>You do it if you&rsquo;re on fire.</p>
<p>And someone&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a way to not be on fire.</p>
<p>Just this particular fire is,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make you wanna run around screaming.</p>
<p>It just makes you wanna fall asleep forever.</p>
<p>And that, but those little steps,</p>
<p>I got lucky because it worked.</p>
<p>It worked, I started exercising.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been on antidepressants before</p>
<p>when I was originally diagnosed with it.</p>
<p>Did those help?</p>
<p>You know, I, even with all the current research</p>
<p>coming out about, that maybe we were all wrong</p>
<p>about our understanding of depression,</p>
<p>I do feel like it helped in a certain way.</p>
<p>Like it definitely, it definitely like</p>
<p>made me stop thinking about,</p>
<p>it stopped the intrusive thoughts.</p>
<p>And, but I don&rsquo;t know how much of that was placebo</p>
<p>or how much of that, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But then also like I couldn&rsquo;t cum anymore.</p>
<p>That was the other fucked up thing.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re, you can&rsquo;t have orgasms.</p>
<p>And which might not sound like a big deal,</p>
<p>but you know, when I told my therapist</p>
<p>that they actually took me off them,</p>
<p>cause I think she was realizing</p>
<p>that it started diminishing a little bit.</p>
<p>But the one I&rsquo;m talking about now,</p>
<p>that whatever episode or whatever you wanna call it,</p>
<p>I just got lucky cause it worked.</p>
<p>It worked and I started feeling better, thank God.</p>
<p>Now, if you suffer from depression out there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve had a remission of the depression,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s really like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s scary to have mental illness</p>
<p>because everyone gets bummed out.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just normal.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re gonna get bummed out</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wanna do anything sometimes.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you have a clinical depression.</p>
<p>You might just be bummed out or grieving.</p>
<p>You might be any number of things.</p>
<p>But when I get really nervous,</p>
<p>if some of those symptoms start showing up.</p>
<p>And at one point I felt like that was happening again.</p>
<p>And I did intramuscular ketamine therapy,</p>
<p>which now that was the damnedest thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that ketamine is immensely psychedelic.</p>
<p>I just remember going back to the hotel</p>
<p>after the experience with the clinician.</p>
<p>And like, you know, it&rsquo;s like with depression,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a headache that starts coming on.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re like, this headache might last for years.</p>
<p>It might last for six months.</p>
<p>It might get worse and worse and worse.</p>
<p>And so I went back to the hotel room and it was just gone.</p>
<p>Like I just felt normal.</p>
<p>It felt great.</p>
<p>It was like the most remarkable thing ever.</p>
<p>So, you know, look at the research on ketamine right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not like bullshit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like woo science.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really, really good data out there</p>
<p>showing that something like, I think it&rsquo;s 60%.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the percentage is,</p>
<p>but 60% of people with an endogenous depression</p>
<p>when they get ketamine therapy will experience remission,</p>
<p>regardless of whether you trip out or not.</p>
<p>It just does something that I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if they know what it is yet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if they do.</p>
<p>But that one thing worked.</p>
<p>And basically you keep fighting until something works.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a survival issue.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a survival issue.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just, I think because it&rsquo;s kind of so slow moving,</p>
<p>you might even forget it&rsquo;s progressive.</p>
<p>Or, you know, you could easily just think</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just a kind of bummed out person.</p>
<p>Or you start thinking that these aspects of your psychology</p>
<p>are permanent when they don&rsquo;t have to be.</p>
<p>What about other people in your life?</p>
<p>What advice would you give to people</p>
<p>that have loved ones who suffer from depression?</p>
<p>What are they to do?</p>
<p>Okay, now this is really like, man, it&rsquo;s really dark.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>This is what somebody told me</p>
<p>when I lost a friend to suicide, you know?</p>
<p>Because when you lose a friend to suicide,</p>
<p>when you lose a loved one to suicide,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna blame yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in the periphery of suicide,</p>
<p>there is a circumference of guilty people</p>
<p>who all feel like, oh, if only I&rsquo;d said this</p>
<p>at the right time, if only I&rsquo;d listened more,</p>
<p>if only I&rsquo;d seen that warning sign,</p>
<p>if only this or that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting in that with other forms of like disease,</p>
<p>you know, if your loved one dies from cancer, say,</p>
<p>more than likely, you&rsquo;re not gonna be thinking like,</p>
<p>oh, I should have cured their cancer.</p>
<p>You know, like it&rsquo;s a tragedy,</p>
<p>but at least you&rsquo;re not like, oh, if only I had.</p>
<p>You still might think that&rsquo;s part of grief, but.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as sticky in many of the other situations.</p>
<p>Here, the guilt couldn&rsquo;t really stay for a long time.</p>
<p>Yep, so you, number one, we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>a progressive disease that can lead to death.</p>
<p>And if somebody commits suicide,</p>
<p>they wanted to commit suicide.</p>
<p>And at least what I&rsquo;ve been told is you can&rsquo;t stop it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna happen, it&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>There are no magic words.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing you could do.</p>
<p>So, you know, people who&rsquo;ve lost people to suicide,</p>
<p>you know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>Like, you know, you can watch it happen in real time</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just nothing you could do.</p>
<p>That being said, you know, being responsive</p>
<p>to when it seems like someone&rsquo;s really reaching out</p>
<p>for help and knowing that maybe even though it might,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s like, doesn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>like this a lot of the time,</p>
<p>and sentences start coming out of their mouth,</p>
<p>that if you weren&rsquo;t really paying attention,</p>
<p>might not seem like a big deal,</p>
<p>but for this person, it&rsquo;s kind of anomalous</p>
<p>that all of a sudden that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Now there, that&rsquo;s when you can be a good listener</p>
<p>and, you know, open up to them and hear what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>and see like, oh, shit, are they asking me for it?</p>
<p>Is this them asking for help?</p>
<p>And even if you&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t know what to do,</p>
<p>you know, at least you can like start checking in on them,</p>
<p>you know, start like help them understand</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re there for them</p>
<p>and then hopefully get them into therapy,</p>
<p>get them to a doctor, get them to a professional</p>
<p>who can like see what&rsquo;s going on there.</p>
<p>So that, and then there&rsquo;s hope.</p>
<p>And even then there might not be hope actually,</p>
<p>you know, doctors can&rsquo;t stop it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, sometimes it just, that&rsquo;s the way it goes.</p>
<p>But, you know, I know that like being sensitive,</p>
<p>if somebody&rsquo;s like all of a sudden hitting you up</p>
<p>or reaching out to you that normally isn&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>and just, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>And just listen.</p>
<p>Which in general, depression or not,</p>
<p>is probably a good thing to do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To truly listen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, are you okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Because people have, you know,</p>
<p>this whole thing of like cries for help, man.</p>
<p>Sometimes they just look like a weird text.</p>
<p>You know, and you don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>for the person to send that fucking text,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been thinking about it all morning.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been just trying to get their phone up</p>
<p>from the floor.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I mean, what, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had friends like kill themselves.</p>
<p>And many of them, it wasn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>sadly it was like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what could have been done,</p>
<p>but.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still a guilt in the back of your head?</p>
<p>For the rest of my life, for sure.</p>
<p>I always will be.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>But again, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>But even that, it&rsquo;s a part of love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You could, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, we feel guilt.</p>
<p>Part of grief is guilt, you know?</p>
<p>Like we always could have been better people.</p>
<p>We always could have been better people.</p>
<p>You getting to Viktor Frankl much?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s search for meaning.</p>
<p>The invitation to live your life</p>
<p>as though you&rsquo;d been on your death bed</p>
<p>and had been given the chance to go back</p>
<p>and not make the same mistakes.</p>
<p>I return to that idea all the time,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>whatever you did before this moment was too late.</p>
<p>But now, you know, this is where you can start.</p>
<p>This is where you can start.</p>
<p>And yeah, so I think that for a neurotic like me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super important.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, I&rsquo;ll just get like too lost</p>
<p>in the weeds of shitty things I did in the past.</p>
<p>So speaking of Viktor Frankl,</p>
<p>you and Hitler have the same birthday.</p>
<p>Oh my God, you&rsquo;ve really done your research.</p>
<p>Well, I often Google famous people</p>
<p>that have a birthday same as Hitler.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The person that shows up, you know,</p>
<p>is your face just really big.</p>
<p>You and Hitler together, just pals next to each other.</p>
<p>No, it does not.</p>
<p>No, but April 20th is an embarrassing birthday</p>
<p>for all my 420 friends out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>You share a birthday with Hitler.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s 420s also has a humor</p>
<p>and a lightness to it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>Your life is embarrassing.</p>
<p>But if you like weed and you&rsquo;re born on stoner day</p>
<p>and you believe in reincarnation,</p>
<p>do you realize like when you start connecting the dots there,</p>
<p>if there is like a Bardo where you get to choose</p>
<p>your next life.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like a shitty generic NPC.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, of course, you would be born on 420.</p>
<p>Dude, let me be born on 420, man, yeah.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it interesting that on that same day,</p>
<p>Hitler is also born.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tension to that and that Hitler&rsquo;s an artist.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like that hippie mindset could go anywhere.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, right.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, you know,</p>
<p>and I was just having this conversation</p>
<p>with a friend of mine who&rsquo;s a wonderful skeptic.</p>
<p>And we were talking about this,</p>
<p>which is the thing where you start attributing to the day</p>
<p>you were born, these kinds of significance.</p>
<p>And based on maybe people who were born on that day,</p>
<p>maybe some other things.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s like, think of how many people by now</p>
<p>in the course of human history have been born on April 20th.</p>
<p>I mean, how many?</p>
<p>Someone could probably do the math</p>
<p>and come up with some number close to it.</p>
<p>Now, this is how you know how rotten Hitler is.</p>
<p>Like, he&rsquo;s the one that, like,</p>
<p>fucks up the birthday for everybody else.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>I think where I heard that you&rsquo;re 420 is Wim Hof episode</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s also 420.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a 420.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Hitler beats even Wim Hof.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>In terms of owning the date.</p>
<p>I think if anybody is like,</p>
<p>well, obviously there&rsquo;s nothing you can do to like fix it.</p>
<p>Hitler fucked up a lot of things.</p>
<p>He fucked up that mustache.</p>
<p>He fucked up the name Hitler.</p>
<p>He fucked up 420.</p>
<p>And obviously he caused a horrific Holocaust that,</p>
<p>by the way, talk about these reverberations through time</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re still experiencing.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s still people walking around</p>
<p>with fucking tattoos from that motherfucker.</p>
<p>So, but, you know, Wim Hof, you know, people like Wim Hof.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like whatever the opposite of Hitler is, you know?</p>
<p>He too is creating ripples in the lake</p>
<p>that hopefully respond to that of Hitler.</p>
<p>Yeah, very cold fucking lake.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s in, and yeah, so very, very cold lake</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s happily swimming around in.</p>
<p>But yeah, you know, I try not to think about</p>
<p>like the Hitler thing on my birthday.</p>
<p>Then my dad would just, every birthday he would remind me</p>
<p>that Hitler was 420.</p>
<p>Do you think all of us are capable of evil?</p>
<p>Do you think, you&rsquo;re one of the sweetest people I know,</p>
<p>just as a fan, do you think you&rsquo;re capable of evil?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah, I mean, sure, definitely.</p>
<p>I think if you don&rsquo;t think that, you better watch out</p>
<p>because come on, how do you think you&rsquo;re not capable of evil?</p>
<p>And PS, you are, if you&rsquo;re connected</p>
<p>to the supply chain, friend, you&rsquo;re doing evil.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re paying taxes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re supporting the worst things in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, like diffusion of responsibility,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really curious or the circumference of responsibility</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like bombs are going off somewhere</p>
<p>that were paid for in some small part by you,</p>
<p>some fractional, if an American, if a drone is flying over</p>
<p>a village in Afghanistan and drops a bomb</p>
<p>and you pay taxes, then you could say you have</p>
<p>fractional ownership over that drone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a cog in the machine of evil in some sense.</p>
<p>And I know what you&rsquo;re gonna say,</p>
<p>well, yeah, but I have to fucking pay taxes.</p>
<p>Like I have no choice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sales tax, there&rsquo;s this or that.</p>
<p>Take that attitude.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing that people on the battlefield</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re sending missiles into other tanks,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, they&rsquo;re more directly responsible</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>But in Buddhism, this idea of dependent co arising</p>
<p>or yeah, dependent co arising.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all connected.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all part of this matrix.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all connected,</p>
<p>meaning we all share responsibility</p>
<p>for the evil in the world.</p>
<p>So even if you aren&rsquo;t directly committing evil acts,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re seeing something in the world</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking that&rsquo;s evil,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not quite as separated from that</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;d like to believe</p>
<p>in some tiny infinitesimally quantum way, you&rsquo;re connected.</p>
<p>And there is a sense, I&rsquo;ve gotten to experience this</p>
<p>over and over that one individual</p>
<p>can actually make a gigantic difference.</p>
<p>And so not only is there a diffusion responsibility,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of a paralysis about, well, what can I do?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sure, I understand, but what can I do?</p>
<p>And I think just looking at history</p>
<p>and also hanging out and becoming friends,</p>
<p>but also interviewing people</p>
<p>that have had a tremendous impact,</p>
<p>you realize you&rsquo;re just one dude.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like a normal person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not that smart even.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people aren&rsquo;t like in some kind of magical way</p>
<p>where you have a big head that&rsquo;s figuring out everything.</p>
<p>No, you just saw problems in the world</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, hey,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m gonna try to do something about this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you stay focused and dedicated to it</p>
<p>for a prolonged period of time and refuse to quit,</p>
<p>refuse to listen to people that tell you</p>
<p>that this isn&rsquo;t like impossible,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how others have failed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m gonna do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And one person, and then you kind of,</p>
<p>the thing is when there&rsquo;s one person</p>
<p>that keeps pushing forward that way,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, humans are sticky.</p>
<p>They, other people follow them around</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;ll help.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ll help and then the other people help</p>
<p>and then the cool people all gather together</p>
<p>cause they kind of get excited about this way.</p>
<p>Holy shit, we can actually make a difference.</p>
<p>And they, they form groups</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden there&rsquo;s companies and nations</p>
<p>that actually make a gigantic difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And it all starts with one person often.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>If I could push back slightly against that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never just one person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, nobody ever talks about,</p>
<p>at least as far as I&rsquo;m aware,</p>
<p>you never hear about like Buddha&rsquo;s great grandmother.</p>
<p>You never hear about that.</p>
<p>But if not for that person, no Buddhism.</p>
<p>You know, the people you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>they are the tip of the iceberg</p>
<p>that pops up out of the ocean of history.</p>
<p>And you never see that all the little things</p>
<p>that helped that happen.</p>
<p>And so to me, this is where the real,</p>
<p>like how do you help?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s something you can do?</p>
<p>Well, you know, recognize that first,</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t really, you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you might not even be aware</p>
<p>of how much you&rsquo;re impacting people around you.</p>
<p>You might think that you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>or you might think surely not in a way</p>
<p>that makes a big difference,</p>
<p>but you have no idea these tipping points</p>
<p>and they can lead to the emergence of an Einstein,</p>
<p>a Gandhi, a Martin Luther King.</p>
<p>We can go on and on, a Dostoevsky or whoever.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s where for me,</p>
<p>it goes back to tend to the part of the garden</p>
<p>you can touch and then, or even deeper than that intention.</p>
<p>It was just like an, I&rsquo;m an idiot.</p>
<p>So I need an idiot&rsquo;s intention, which is don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if you, I heard the Dalai Lama say it.</p>
<p>If you can help, help.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t help, don&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>Simple, basic dummy rules so that you can,</p>
<p>if possible, refrain from hurting,</p>
<p>which might as well be a form of helping.</p>
<p>And the help doesn&rsquo;t have to be this dramatic thing.</p>
<p>These little acts of kindness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, they seem to have,</p>
<p>maybe I believe in kind of karma,</p>
<p>but they seem to have this,</p>
<p>they can have this gigantic ripple effect.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that is.</p>
<p>I just, I remember a lot of little acts of kindness</p>
<p>that people have done to me and they, what do they do?</p>
<p>One, they fill me with joy and hope for the future.</p>
<p>They give me faith in humanity.</p>
<p>That somehow there&rsquo;s a partially dormant desire</p>
<p>in our sort of collective intelligence</p>
<p>to do good in the world.</p>
<p>That most of us want to be good,</p>
<p>that want to do good onto the world.</p>
<p>I want, there&rsquo;s a kindness that&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>begging to get out, you know?</p>
<p>And those little acts of kindness do just that.</p>
<p>And actually one of the reasons I love Austin</p>
<p>and moved here is realizing,</p>
<p>just noticing those little acts of kindness all around me,</p>
<p>just for stupid reasons, just people being really nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird and that kindness combined with an optimism</p>
<p>for the future, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s amazing what that can build.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And I know what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, we moved to this great neighborhood</p>
<p>and at this point I think three,</p>
<p>maybe four of our neighbors have like made food for us</p>
<p>that just shows up with like handwritten lists</p>
<p>of like things they like to do in the area</p>
<p>and their phone number if we need help.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, holy shit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, it might seem like a little act,</p>
<p>but it feels like some kind of atomic love bomb</p>
<p>just went off on your porch when you&rsquo;re looking at that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>You made me a pie?</p>
<p>This is incredible.</p>
<p>Like, this is incredible, so.</p>
<p>And also it&rsquo;s another act to accept that kindness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a lot of times when I was like in Boston</p>
<p>or San Francisco, certain big cities,</p>
<p>you can think like, oh, okay,</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re trying to like somehow,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not an act of kindness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some kind of a transactional thing to build up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a career move for networking,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But no, if you just accept it for what it is,</p>
<p>a pure act of kindness.</p>
<p>Fucking Boston.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, yeah.</p>
<p>Because for me, I go the opposite route.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m not, even though there is a part of me</p>
<p>that might be a little suspicious or something,</p>
<p>where I go to push that shit back mentally</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t deserve this.</p>
<p>If they knew what a piece of shit I am.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna bring me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna never bring cakes to my neighbors.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to make a cake.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to make anything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have time.</p>
<p>I should be bringing shit to my neighbors.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t I do that?</p>
<p>I should have brought, I never do that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not careful,</p>
<p>you can spiral into a vortex of self hate from the gift.</p>
<p>So you have to, yeah, you have to learn how to,</p>
<p>in that circuitry, you have to learn how to like accept.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I have that problem really big.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I don&rsquo;t deserve this.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t, I get so much love from people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, yeah, they love me</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t know me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my brain, my little voice.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not worthy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not worthy of any of this kindness</p>
<p>and all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that could be very, yeah, it can shut you down.</p>
<p>It can be debilitating.</p>
<p>And also it shuts the person down.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re talking.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the dark side is it pushes them away too.</p>
<p>Yeah, it cuts off this fucking mystical circuitry.</p>
<p>So like the best thing if that happens to you</p>
<p>is like accept it joyfully.</p>
<p>And just even, just all that,</p>
<p>whatever that thing inside of you,</p>
<p>whatever that little thing is, you know,</p>
<p>this is like in the meditation I do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an infuriatingly simple meditation,</p>
<p>but when a thought emerges,</p>
<p>when you are resting your attention on your breath</p>
<p>and then inevitably you think, you get lost in your thoughts.</p>
<p>And when you catch yourself doing that,</p>
<p>you think thinking,</p>
<p>and then return your attention to the breath.</p>
<p>So I like that so that when that part of myself starts,</p>
<p>you know, having its little neurotic semi seizure,</p>
<p>I can just go thinking, whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just another thought.</p>
<p>And then eat the, eat the, eat the banana bread</p>
<p>or whatever they gave you.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most wild psychedelic experience</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever had in a dream, in a vision?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be drug related.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s one that jumps to mind</p>
<p>that was like, holy shit, I&rsquo;m happy to be alive.</p>
<p>Is this life?</p>
<p>Okay. This is amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, the, oh yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So the one that pops to mind,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of psychedelic experiences,</p>
<p>but in this moment, the one that pops to mind,</p>
<p>only because it goes back to what you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>about this Nietzsche&rsquo;s idea of infinite return.</p>
<p>The, the, so I&rsquo;m a Burning Man and.</p>
<p>Are you going to Burning Man this time?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I mean, I have kids right now.</p>
<p>I just want to be around them.</p>
<p>My wife was being so cool about it</p>
<p>and she knows I love Burning Man.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, go to Burning Man.</p>
<p>And I was going to go.</p>
<p>And then I just, I just want to be around my kids</p>
<p>as much as I can right now, but.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to Burning Man.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how secretive it is that, I mean,</p>
<p>cause quite high profile folks go.</p>
<p>Yeah, everyone knows Elon Musk goes there.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it pretty open?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a boat.</p>
<p>You know that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m touching none of this.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s called art cars.</p>
<p>They all make art cars.</p>
<p>And like part of the, part of the burn,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s so beautiful about it is like,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t buy anything there, man.</p>
<p>Like you, I&rsquo;ve heard, I don&rsquo;t know if this has changed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a bit because of the pandemic,</p>
<p>but the only thing you could buy was ice and coffee.</p>
<p>And I think maybe that&rsquo;s changed.</p>
<p>I heard some whisper that that&rsquo;s changed,</p>
<p>but so that means that it&rsquo;s a gifting economy</p>
<p>is what they call it.</p>
<p>And so people will just give you stuff.</p>
<p>Talk about having to struggle with deserving stuff, man.</p>
<p>What are you going to fucking do when the camp next to you</p>
<p>is like every morning making the best iced coffee</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve ever had in your life.</p>
<p>And they just are giving it all away till it&rsquo;s all gone.</p>
<p>What are you going to do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the best ever.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re giving things to people.</p>
<p>And then you, you learn stuff like,</p>
<p>you learn these really interesting lessons.</p>
<p>Like one of the times I went there,</p>
<p>got all these strawberries.</p>
<p>Might not sound like a big deal,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re out there in the dust</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not at one of like the,</p>
<p>like hardcore like luxury camps,</p>
<p>which do exist out there,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;ve got these like items where in my mind,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, these are going to be just for me</p>
<p>and my girlfriend, my special stash fruit</p>
<p>and this or that.</p>
<p>And then like two days in you&rsquo;re walking around your camp</p>
<p>with the strawberries that you were coveting</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s so happy to get like cold strawberries</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve realized, oh my God,</p>
<p>this feels so much better than the way a strawberry tastes.</p>
<p>So you learn something experientially there,</p>
<p>which is an incredible thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible thing.</p>
<p>Man, now I&rsquo;m wishing I had decided to go to Burning Man.</p>
<p>Have you been a few times?</p>
<p>Yeah, I just know like,</p>
<p>at least people were saying it was Elon Musk&rsquo;s boat.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, like this, I think it was like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this massive, it&rsquo;s art cars.</p>
<p>And it was this party on this thing.</p>
<p>You could just, anyone can go on the boat.</p>
<p>Like no one&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s no guest list.</p>
<p>You just go on there.</p>
<p>I never saw him there, but that, you know,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s whispering Elon Musk is here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a secrecy, there&rsquo;s all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d probably have to respect that.</p>
<p>But at the same time there,</p>
<p>it seems like the kind of people that go there,</p>
<p>I mean, the rules of the outside world are suspended</p>
<p>in the sense that the crime, the aggression,</p>
<p>the tensions, all of that seems to dissipate somehow.</p>
<p>Not all the way, not all the way.</p>
<p>That, you know, you could look it up, you know,</p>
<p>cause like there is tension.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of tension there between,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called plug and plays.</p>
<p>Like, you know, Burning Man,</p>
<p>like the history of Burning Man is fascinating.</p>
<p>It has its roots in the cacophony society</p>
<p>is what it was called,</p>
<p>which is a sort of evolution of something that was,</p>
<p>I think it was called the God, like the San Francisco.</p>
<p>Basically there was like an art movement in San Francisco.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t remember the name of it.</p>
<p>Maybe the Suicide Club or essentially like,</p>
<p>they were really into urban exploration</p>
<p>and meaning like breaking into like</p>
<p>old abandoned buildings and stuff.</p>
<p>But part of this, what this was, was</p>
<p>you would prepare your life</p>
<p>as though you were going to kill yourself.</p>
<p>You would get all your affairs in order.</p>
<p>You would get, so it&rsquo;s going back to what we were talking</p>
<p>about with the cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like sort of putting yourself into that world</p>
<p>of like, I&rsquo;m going to get all my affairs together</p>
<p>as though this is it.</p>
<p>And then there was some,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for anyone listening if I&rsquo;m butchering this,</p>
<p>but I think there was some really cool initiation</p>
<p>where they would blindfold you</p>
<p>and they would take you into</p>
<p>some of these abandoned buildings.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t know where you were walking,</p>
<p>but they would say like,</p>
<p>if you take one step to the left, you&rsquo;re going to die.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to fall off.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to fall.</p>
<p>So please be careful.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like in the moment</p>
<p>and then blindfold comes off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big, awesome party.</p>
<p>This evolves into something called the Cacophony Society.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great book called</p>
<p>Tales of the Cacophony Society for people listening.</p>
<p>One of the members of the Cacophony Society</p>
<p>was the author of Fight Club.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;ve seen Fight Club,</p>
<p>like you could see little ideas</p>
<p>that were in the Cacophony Society.</p>
<p>They were into Dadaism, which I don&rsquo;t know a lot about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s a philosophical art movement.</p>
<p>And then so basically what was happening is like,</p>
<p>they kept burning increasingly large effigies</p>
<p>in San Francisco and they weren&rsquo;t allowed to do it.</p>
<p>And so they took it out in the desert</p>
<p>and they were basing it on something called a zone trip,</p>
<p>which is like, across this border,</p>
<p>the rules of that old society are gone.</p>
<p>And so that was the original Burning Man,</p>
<p>which was these lunatics out in the desert,</p>
<p>launching like burning pianos out of catapults</p>
<p>through the air doing like drive by shooting ranges,</p>
<p>like no rules, wild, magical, beautiful, insane madness.</p>
<p>And then it grew and grew and grew and grew</p>
<p>until you have Burning Man as it is today,</p>
<p>which is still the most incredible thing.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously anytime you have like a thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been around for a while, you&rsquo;re gonna get that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like it used to be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as free as it used to be, so this or that.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s fascinating about Burning Man,</p>
<p>someone pointed this out to me, look on the ground,</p>
<p>no trash, no cigarettes.</p>
<p>The ethic of like picking up your shit there</p>
<p>is like so intense.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like the other festivals you go to</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s just trash everywhere,</p>
<p>shit scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clean.</p>
<p>People are picking up their stuff.</p>
<p>People are like really being conscious</p>
<p>of like not fucking up the playa.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sorry, don&rsquo;t get a burner yapping about Burning Man.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be morning.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a power,</p>
<p>but there is a power to culture propagating itself</p>
<p>through to the stories that we tell each other.</p>
<p>And that holds up for Burning Man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that the culture has stayed strong</p>
<p>throughout the years.</p>
<p>So many people, so many really interesting people</p>
<p>speak of Burning Man as like a sacred place they go to</p>
<p>to remind themselves about what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>And it is.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, you know, there are all these stories</p>
<p>of like, I love guru stories.</p>
<p>I have a guru.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Karoli Baba, never met him, he was Ram Dass&rsquo;s guru,</p>
<p>at least not in the flesh.</p>
<p>But the story of the guru is if you&rsquo;re lucky,</p>
<p>you meet this being that,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not talking about, you know,</p>
<p>whatever the run of the mill, like charlatans out there.</p>
<p>Like I know for sure that people are in the world right now</p>
<p>who when you&rsquo;re around them,</p>
<p>the thing you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>the affirmation of the potential of humanity</p>
<p>and also just an acceptance of yourself</p>
<p>and, you know, cultivate,</p>
<p>like seeing someone who&rsquo;s cultivated love or compassion</p>
<p>or whatever, but in this way that is,</p>
<p>I mean, you would almost,</p>
<p>you would rather meet that being</p>
<p>than like a UFO land in your backyard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it is the UFO.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a person, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everybody and nobody.</p>
<p>And somehow they like end up conveying to you</p>
<p>ideas that you may have heard a million times before,</p>
<p>but somehow within the language itself is a transmission</p>
<p>that permanently alters you.</p>
<p>And so these people exist.</p>
<p>I think you could argue that Burning Man,</p>
<p>the total thing is a guru,</p>
<p>that a pilgrimage is involved to get there.</p>
<p>You, like, it&rsquo;s not easy to get there.</p>
<p>And when you get there, it&rsquo;s gonna teach you something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna show you something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to, and maybe some of the stuff it shows you</p>
<p>might not be great, but the community around you</p>
<p>will like, will hold you as you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>whatever the thing is that&rsquo;s coming out of you</p>
<p>is coming out of you.</p>
<p>And even the simplest activities,</p>
<p>the simplest exchange of words have like,</p>
<p>just like the gurus, a profound impact somehow.</p>
<p>Something about that place.</p>
<p>Yeah, not to mention the insane synchronicities,</p>
<p>like insane synchronicities there.</p>
<p>And I think like, you know, to get back to the notion</p>
<p>of sentience as a byproduct of a harmonized</p>
<p>yet hyper complex system.</p>
<p>I think synchronicities, like those kinds of systems</p>
<p>are like lightning rods for synchronicity.</p>
<p>So crazy, not just because your high synchronicities</p>
<p>happen that are impossible,</p>
<p>where you just have to deal with it.</p>
<p>And like, you&rsquo;ll need something.</p>
<p>And within a few minutes, someone&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, here you go.</p>
<p>And you mentioned, but by the way,</p>
<p>Burning Anchors of a psychedelic experience,</p>
<p>is it the strawberries or was it something else?</p>
<p>What was the moment?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was magical.</p>
<p>No, it was DMT.</p>
<p>It definitely wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t strawberries.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>No, no, I was.</p>
<p>More potent.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was like smoking DMT.</p>
<p>And like, I saw, like, if you, in the midnight gospel,</p>
<p>there are these bovine creatures that have like a long neck</p>
<p>and a lantern head.</p>
<p>So like, I saw one of those things.</p>
<p>And, you know, I thought it was funny and like ridiculous</p>
<p>because you hear like all the Terence McKenna stories</p>
<p>of the self transforming machine elves</p>
<p>or all the purple or the magenta goddess everyone sees.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, so this is what I get?</p>
<p>Like a fucking cow with a lantern head?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s where my brain is at</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re interacting with this molecule.</p>
<p>So then like, I look away.</p>
<p>And again, this is DMT.</p>
<p>So when I say look away, do I mean with my eyes shut,</p>
<p>I look away or eyes open, I look away, I think eyes shut.</p>
<p>So it sounds weird to say look away,</p>
<p>but however you want to put it, that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>And I look back and it&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>Only now it&rsquo;s, you know, cause usually in like,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re having those kinds of visions,</p>
<p>they go away pretty quickly.</p>
<p>This thing&rsquo;s like moved, like shambled ahead</p>
<p>and maybe a few steps, just like a cow, just like a cow.</p>
<p>And then that was when the, you know,</p>
<p>all the stories you hear about it,</p>
<p>like going through some kind of tuber,</p>
<p>some kind of light tunnel, like a water slide</p>
<p>made of light that&rsquo;s increasingly familiar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the wildest part of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, I know this place.</p>
<p>Not like, oh, I&rsquo;ve seen this in like,</p>
<p>you know, on like bong stickers, but like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, this is that place you go to.</p>
<p>You just remember, oh, this place.</p>
<p>And then it was like I was in some kind of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to put it, a chamber,</p>
<p>a technological chamber, some kind of supercomputer,</p>
<p>some kind of nucleus that was technological.</p>
<p>And it was inviting.</p>
<p>There was an invitation of like, come in,</p>
<p>like come deeper into, come deeper in.</p>
<p>And you can talk to whatever it is over there.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t talk, but there&rsquo;s a communication.</p>
<p>And I communicated, but my friends, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I love my friends.</p>
<p>I guess I had some sense in that moment</p>
<p>that it would mean complete obliteration</p>
<p>or who knows what.</p>
<p>And the response that it gave back was,</p>
<p>you can always go back there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I opened my eyes, I&rsquo;m back.</p>
<p>Totally, you know, and ever since then,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s caused me to revise my thinking on reincarnation.</p>
<p>The idea that you die and you start as a baby</p>
<p>and then live your life again.</p>
<p>It goes right into what we were talking about.</p>
<p>You know, that maybe data, you know,</p>
<p>that the shit I saw in Nitro Sox,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel dumb that my epiphanies are all related</p>
<p>to drugs, but not all of them are a lot of them.</p>
<p>But this notion of like, oh, is it that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>imprinting into the medium of time, space,</p>
<p>everything we do, and that that is a permanent imprint,</p>
<p>a frame that upon death can be accessed</p>
<p>in the same way we can pull up pictures on our phone</p>
<p>or computers, and not only accessed, but experienced</p>
<p>as though, in other words, you could just jump in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still gonna have your memories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna give you the illusion of having been a kid</p>
<p>and gotten to that frame, but no,</p>
<p>you just decided to go back there, nostalgia, whatever.</p>
<p>And yeah, you can jump around freely in space and time.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you can go in and out of time space,</p>
<p>but the problem is when you go into time space, it&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna feel sticky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna feel like you&rsquo;ve been here forever</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve dropped back onto the track</p>
<p>that Nietzsche&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>And I guess one of the qualities of dropping</p>
<p>into that frame is that you forget</p>
<p>your higher dimensional identity.</p>
<p>What happened to the cow with the lantern, was that goodbye?</p>
<p>He writes me letters sometimes.</p>
<p>Never saw it again.</p>
<p>Never?</p>
<p>Never saw it again, but I put it in,</p>
<p>we put it in the Midnight Gospel.</p>
<p>Pendleton was such a genius, and he drew it for me,</p>
<p>and then it just ended up as a part of the show.</p>
<p>But by the way, I have to admit that as a big fan of yours,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched the Midnight Gospel</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been waiting.</p>
<p>You do these stupid things, but ever since you talked to,</p>
<p>maybe two years ago with Joe about it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting to watch it</p>
<p>with a special person on mushrooms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been in my to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, of course you don&rsquo;t have to be on mushrooms</p>
<p>to enjoy it, but for some reason I put it into my head</p>
<p>that this is something I wanna do with somebody else,</p>
<p>like experience it and get wild.</p>
<p>Because visually, I mean, I watched a bunch of it,</p>
<p>just a little bit here and there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just visually such an interesting experience.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Combined with everything else, obviously,</p>
<p>the ideas, the voices and so on,</p>
<p>but just visually it&rsquo;s like a super psychedelic version</p>
<p>of Rick and Morty or something like that,</p>
<p>like farther out, wilder out there.</p>
<p>Yeah, man, that&rsquo;s Pendleton.</p>
<p>These people, I mean, I was part of that</p>
<p>in the sense that Pendleton gave,</p>
<p>one of the reasons he&rsquo;s such a genius</p>
<p>and great at making stuff is he really does a good job</p>
<p>of just dehierarchizing potential hierarchies</p>
<p>that can appear.</p>
<p>Someone has to be driving the bus, and that was Pendleton,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s so inclusive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real punk rock thing that he&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>which is like, he&rsquo;ll take everything,</p>
<p>and it kind of mixes its way into the show.</p>
<p>But one of the things in animation,</p>
<p>it can get really strict with drawing the characters</p>
<p>and trying to create continuity</p>
<p>in the way the character looks,</p>
<p>and it can get really brute for the animator.</p>
<p>Making it brutally precise, like it has to be precise.</p>
<p>But he figured out that if you just sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like, obviously, Clancy had to look like Clancy</p>
<p>through the whole show,</p>
<p>but if you allow the various people animating it</p>
<p>to sort of have their own spin on it,</p>
<p>then suddenly it creates a very psychedelic,</p>
<p>the show looks more psychedelic</p>
<p>because it looks more organic, and also the amount of time.</p>
<p>I had no idea, the amount of time that goes into making</p>
<p>digital art look like that is, it&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>The amount of work in comping that stuff is just crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Generally, the amount of time it takes,</p>
<p>even just like a painting,</p>
<p>when you, I really enjoy watching artists do a time lapse,</p>
<p>and you realize how much effort just into a single image</p>
<p>goes into it.</p>
<p>Hours and hours and hours, sometimes days,</p>
<p>sometimes weeks and months,</p>
<p>and then you just get to see them work,</p>
<p>but they lose themselves in the craftsmanship of it,</p>
<p>in the rhythm of it.</p>
<p>And like, because they&rsquo;re focused on the,</p>
<p>so we were talking about robotics earlier,</p>
<p>like on the little details, like they&rsquo;re never look,</p>
<p>well, most of the time isn&rsquo;t spent looking</p>
<p>at the big picture of the final result,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s looking at the little details there and so on.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re, but they&rsquo;re nevertheless able</p>
<p>to somehow constantly channel the big picture,</p>
<p>the final result.</p>
<p>My God, yeah, the respect I have for animators,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, dear God, it&rsquo;s the craziest thing</p>
<p>when you watch it, when you see what it looks like</p>
<p>and how much time goes into it and how zen they have to be,</p>
<p>because like, no matter what,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to cut stuff, man.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re cutting like a few seconds of animation,</p>
<p>that was someone&rsquo;s like month, maybe, you know?</p>
<p>And like, they understand, but still it&rsquo;s like, whoa,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s brutal.</p>
<p>And so they have like this zen outlook on it,</p>
<p>which is really cool.</p>
<p>And they watch podcasts, that&rsquo;s the other cool thing,</p>
<p>when you realize like, oh, they&rsquo;re listening to podcasts</p>
<p>or like, that&rsquo;s really cool to see that aspect of it too.</p>
<p>But yeah, man, I, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, your voice is in the ears</p>
<p>of a lot of interesting people, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yours too.</p>
<p>And I, you know.</p>
<p>Hello, interesting person.</p>
<p>Hello, CIA, animators.</p>
<p>Eating delicious food in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Yeah. I&rsquo;m on your side.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s against you, I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have, you have a beard, therefore you must be wise.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people, high school, college,</p>
<p>about how to carve their path through life?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a life, a career that&rsquo;s successful</p>
<p>that they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of.</p>
<p>Man, see, this is what kind of,</p>
<p>this is what sucks about my life,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s been very random and very spontaneous.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t get that thing</p>
<p>where I could be like, well, here&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t, like I inherited $12,000</p>
<p>from my grandmother, here&rsquo;s what you do kids,</p>
<p>you inherit $12,000 when your grandmother dies.</p>
<p>And then you need to be dumb enough</p>
<p>to think that that $12,000 is gonna help you</p>
<p>live in LA for a year.</p>
<p>So then what you do is you move to LA with $12,000</p>
<p>and you find a shitty place that you live at.</p>
<p>And then you use that money to buy acid and synthesizers.</p>
<p>And then you run out of the money and then you,</p>
<p>then you have to get a job.</p>
<p>And so then, because you think it&rsquo;ll be fun</p>
<p>to work at a comedy club, you get a job at the comedy store.</p>
<p>And then, you know, that&rsquo;s how it happened for me.</p>
<p>And none of, there wasn&rsquo;t, I never had the confidence</p>
<p>to be like, I&rsquo;m gonna be a standup comedian.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>I just thought it&rsquo;d be cool to work in that building.</p>
<p>I thought the building looked cool.</p>
<p>And so, but then like, cause like you work</p>
<p>at the comedy store, you get stage time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s the reason like you work there</p>
<p>is at least in those days, cause it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re paying like a shit ton of money</p>
<p>for you to answer phones at a comedy club.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I started going on stage</p>
<p>and then like, I just got lucky</p>
<p>cause Rogan saw me have like a very rare, good set.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know he was in the room or I would&rsquo;ve bombed,</p>
<p>you know, and then like, cause he thought I was funny</p>
<p>and he liked talking to me.</p>
<p>He started taking me on the road with him.</p>
<p>And then, you know, so I don&rsquo;t know, man.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Was there an element to, there&rsquo;s a beautiful weirdness</p>
<p>to you as a human being.</p>
<p>Was there like a pressure to conform ever</p>
<p>to hide yourself from the world?</p>
<p>Or did the $12,000 in the acid give you</p>
<p>the confidence you needed to be yourself?</p>
<p>Oh no, I don&rsquo;t, like I still, no.</p>
<p>I think, sure, there&rsquo;s that pressure.</p>
<p>And like, you know, whenever you&rsquo;re beginning</p>
<p>to really differentiate from your parents,</p>
<p>but then you go back to hang out with your parents,</p>
<p>you can feel that it&rsquo;s not like they even want you</p>
<p>to conform, but you&rsquo;ll just, you could slip into that,</p>
<p>whatever that was.</p>
<p>So I remember that when I would go back</p>
<p>and like visit them and stuff.</p>
<p>And surely conformity or the pressure to like,</p>
<p>not be individual or whatever, it&rsquo;s everywhere, man.</p>
<p>Do you think you made your parents proud?</p>
<p>E, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Well, I think that when my mom died,</p>
<p>I felt successful in the sense that I was able</p>
<p>to support my, I was making money from doing standup</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t need help.</p>
<p>I was like, I was supporting myself with art</p>
<p>and doing good, what I thought was great then.</p>
<p>So, and I think she, like, because she had witnessed</p>
<p>me literally failing, I mean, which is, by the way,</p>
<p>I think part of, if you want to be an artist</p>
<p>or successful, you kind of have to fail.</p>
<p>Like there, if, and if there was a guaranteed route</p>
<p>from sucking to not sucking or from like the neophyte phase</p>
<p>of whatever the art form is and, you know,</p>
<p>some intermediary phase, then I think a lot more people</p>
<p>would do it, but there really is no guarantees in it,</p>
<p>especially the standup comedy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;d have to be a maniac to want to,</p>
<p>to think that that&rsquo;s going to work out for you.</p>
<p>You have to, so you&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>there are obviously exceptions, but for me,</p>
<p>it was like a long slog, you know,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s scary for a mom.</p>
<p>So, but that being said, when she was dying,</p>
<p>like she did recognize that I was like not slogging anymore.</p>
<p>And she did say, she said, you did it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s cool, but in, you know,</p>
<p>I would love for her to see me now,</p>
<p>like now it&rsquo;d be way cooler, but maybe she does.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s listening to your podcast elsewhere in the other,</p>
<p>in the Bardo.</p>
<p>Yeah, however long that lasts reconfiguring</p>
<p>the whole process to start again.</p>
<p>You as a father now, how did that change you?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the big change, man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>You made a few biological entities.</p>
<p>Yeah, I made biological entities.</p>
<p>I mean, I came in my wife, let&rsquo;s face it.</p>
<p>Like I would love to say I made them,</p>
<p>but the womb whipped them up, but it is the,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve never experienced anything like it before.</p>
<p>It is the, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,</p>
<p>the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I was able to answer your Nietzsche question</p>
<p>with like, hell yes, fuck yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I get to be around my kids again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll always be around my kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll always be around my children.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the joy.</p>
<p>So like, so for me,</p>
<p>the part of myself that used to torture myself more,</p>
<p>especially like around like my mom dying,</p>
<p>feeling like I wasn&rsquo;t there enough for her,</p>
<p>wishing that I had spent more time with her,</p>
<p>wishing I&rsquo;d spent more time with my dad,</p>
<p>wishing that like, looking back at like how like</p>
<p>I was just so desperately trying to evade the fact</p>
<p>that she was dying and through,</p>
<p>and in that evasion successfully like distanced myself</p>
<p>from her and like in ways that I really wish I hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that because it&rsquo;s one of my regrets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a big regret.</p>
<p>I have a lot of little regrets,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>And so when you have kids,</p>
<p>you look back at everything you did</p>
<p>and you think like, fuck,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;d gone left at that point instead of right,</p>
<p>if I had eaten, who knows?</p>
<p>What if I&rsquo;d eaten like a turkey sandwich</p>
<p>when my balls were creating the cum</p>
<p>that was gonna make my kids?</p>
<p>Would I have a different kid?</p>
<p>Would this being not exist in my life?</p>
<p>Like you start looking at everything</p>
<p>and you realize like, thank God,</p>
<p>thank God for every single thing that happened to me</p>
<p>because it all led up to this.</p>
<p>And oh, for me, that is the, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like, it frees you in this.</p>
<p>It liberates you because you realize like,</p>
<p>oh wow, it&rsquo;s clumsy and selfish</p>
<p>and at times rotten as I&rsquo;ve been in my life.</p>
<p>That did not impede the universe at all</p>
<p>from allowing these two beautiful beings</p>
<p>to exist in the world.</p>
<p>So maybe all of it enabled,</p>
<p>all of it like a concert perfectly led up</p>
<p>to that little beautiful moment.</p>
<p>Is there ways you would like to be a better father?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a actual, I read something in a book,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called Good Enough.</p>
<p>The mantra for a parent, good enough.</p>
<p>Because when you are in the presence</p>
<p>of something you love more</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;ve ever experienced love,</p>
<p>you wanna be perfect.</p>
<p>Like you wanna be, I can&rsquo;t, I gotta work, man.</p>
<p>I gotta go on the road.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotta work.</p>
<p>I gotta support the family.</p>
<p>So that means I have to work.</p>
<p>Like I work, you know what it&rsquo;s like having a podcast.</p>
<p>You fucking work, man.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s a full time job</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve, you know, I do standup too</p>
<p>and all the other stuff.</p>
<p>So I feel sometimes I feel like, oh my God,</p>
<p>I wanna spend more time with them.</p>
<p>Like I should be spending more time with them.</p>
<p>But then also I wanna create, I wanna work.</p>
<p>I like being like the provider.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something I feel guilty about, you know, right now.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re struggling how to balance that correctly.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, time just marches on.</p>
<p>It just goes, it goes.</p>
<p>And all of this will be forgotten.</p>
<p>Both you and I, but forgotten in time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I say to them</p>
<p>every time I&rsquo;m putting them to bed.</p>
<p>We will be lost in the sands of time.</p>
<p>You know that, I bet you know this poem.</p>
<p>You know that poem, Ozymandias?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can I read you a poem?</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s end our conversation in a poem.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by Pierce, by Shelley,</p>
<p>probably mispronouncing the name.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;ll get it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no right way to pronounce anything.</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ozymandias.</p>
<p>I met a traveler from an antique land who said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert.</p>
<p>Near them, on the sand, half sunk,</p>
<p>a shattered visage lies whose frown and wrinkled lip</p>
<p>and sneer of cold command tell that its sculptor,</p>
<p>well those passions read, which yet survive,</p>
<p>stamped on these lifeless things,</p>
<p>the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.</p>
<p>And on the pedestal, these words appear.</p>
<p>My name is Ozymandias, king of kings.</p>
<p>Look on my works, ye mighty, in despair.</p>
<p>Nothing beside remains around the decay</p>
<p>of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,</p>
<p>the lone and level sands stretch far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All gone, behold the king.</p>
<p>Look on my works, ye mighty, in despair.</p>
<p>In despair.</p>
<p>Even though it will be forgotten in the sands of time,</p>
<p>Duncan, I&rsquo;m just so glad that you exist</p>
<p>and you put so much love into the world</p>
<p>over the past many years that I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance</p>
<p>to enjoy it by being your fan.</p>
<p>Likewise.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for continuing that</p>
<p>and for sharing a bit of love with me today.</p>
<p>Can we be friends?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be friends.</p>
<p>In the real world, in 3D space?</p>
<p>Nothing is real, but yes, in this particular slice</p>
<p>of the multidimensional world we live in.</p>
<p>It will be an honor and a pleasure.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me on your show.</p>
<p>I love you, Duncan.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Duncan Trussell.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Duncan Trussell himself.</p>
<p>You are essentially just a cloud of atoms</p>
<p>that will eventually be aerosolized by time.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
