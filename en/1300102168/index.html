<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>we are live</p>
<p>live on the podcast</p>
<p>with the voice</p>
<p>yeah baby michael</p>
<p>shivelo a meeting of the minds</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>to mix martial arts</p>
<p>connoisseurs if you will together on a podcast</p>
<p>sponsored by the way by the flashlight</p>
<p>as always now they</p>
<p>have a new avatar version now it&rsquo;s not really avatar</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t say avatar but you know what you&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>explode into</p>
<p>blue vagina</p>
<p>these are like they&rsquo;ve got in</p>
<p>tokyo they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>called tengas over there they&rsquo;re huge sellers at don</p>
<p>coyote stores</p>
<p>which for us</p>
<p>mixed martial arts fans don</p>
<p>coyote is also the</p>
<p>major sponsor of sengoku</p>
<p>really so therefore what</p>
<p>is don coyote</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a store</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s a store</p>
<p>where you can buy</p>
<p>everything from fashion</p>
<p>to food to fucking</p>
<p>sex shit like this and they sell these</p>
<p>things called tenga</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s similar to this but a bit</p>
<p>smaller because the japanese have really</p>
<p>small cocks</p>
<p>sorry it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about japanese fans but you do rude</p>
<p>how rude and yeah the guys buy these</p>
<p>things tenders and they rip the</p>
<p>leaves off in it</p>
<p>well this is</p>
<p>this is the only</p>
<p>sponsor i have for the show well i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>counted a couple</p>
<p>other ones but</p>
<p>you know in the</p>
<p>mp3 versions but this</p>
<p>this company</p>
<p>was sponsored by a guy whose wife was pregnant and</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t fuck her obviously</p>
<p>so he invented something that</p>
<p>came up with something to fuck</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s rich</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like his own personal like they came up with all</p>
<p>these patents for what makes it feel the most like a</p>
<p>pussy it&rsquo;s really fantastic</p>
<p>shit like if you feel it i</p>
<p>feel you fucking</p>
<p>stuck your cock in there no i didn&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do that to you promise me i</p>
<p>have the one the</p>
<p>fucking schlongery have not done that i</p>
<p>would not do that to you</p>
<p>i would only give you a</p>
<p>clean one oh you spit and</p>
<p>two fingered it oh i feel dirty damn</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s pretty pretty cool nice</p>
<p>man well you know what i like the most</p>
<p>about it though that there&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>bunch of controversy</p>
<p>about it i think my him people have called</p>
<p>me dude when he was doing the he wasn&rsquo;t here</p>
<p>he just got this i just got this last week</p>
<p>may have touched one i</p>
<p>might give them one</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll give you one if you want i got some</p>
<p>extra that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right i got my</p>
<p>girlfriend here when she</p>
<p>goes shazam</p>
<p>on the road then</p>
<p>i know what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everything lonely times brother</p>
<p>lonely times on the road cantalobes in the microwave</p>
<p>you know i only discovered like</p>
<p>12 months ago that</p>
<p>the japanese toilets all have</p>
<p>a chute water into your ass</p>
<p>right so i haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wiped my ass in</p>
<p>japan for the last 10</p>
<p>months because it</p>
<p>shoots water in your ass and</p>
<p>cleans your ass out but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really the way to do it it&rsquo;s a way to go and it</p>
<p>warms the seat</p>
<p>warms and the seat tilts from side to side but</p>
<p>if you shift back</p>
<p>a little bit more</p>
<p>it goes from your ass and</p>
<p>shoots onto your balls</p>
<p>so the japanese toilets can fondle your balls</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re lonely</p>
<p>nights on the road and</p>
<p>get your balls fondled and</p>
<p>get the moisturizer</p>
<p>out so that&rsquo;s what you do</p>

<p>many black people in australia</p>
<p>but every so that word doesn&rsquo;t even exist</p>
<p>no it wouldn&rsquo;t say it really no</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like americans calling someone an a bow</p>
<p>a bow right</p>
<p>aboriginal aboriginal</p>
<p>right see a bow is</p>
<p>about it doesn&rsquo;t exist over here you call</p>
<p>someone hey you fucking a bow and i go yeah</p>
<p>fuck all black on american a bow he goes right</p>
<p>right what&rsquo;s that how come</p>
<p>a nigger is gonna kill me but if you call an</p>
<p>aborigine anabo it&rsquo;s the same thing as calling them and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll pull petrol on you and set you on fire whoa</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t understand but that&rsquo;s just a short</p>
<p>version of aborigine</p>
<p>yo you gotta turn that shit off son dismiss</p>
<p>alarm i don&rsquo;t know why it sounded like</p>
<p>five in the afternoon it&rsquo;s time to get</p>

<p>clock you sick fuck</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re right it&rsquo;s an abbreviation it&rsquo;s like</p>

<p>wrong with that but a bows</p>

<p>bow i made a</p>
<p>statement once</p>
<p>saying the japs have created some insane shit</p>
<p>and this guy goes do you know how</p>
<p>racist that</p>
<p>you just said that i&rsquo;m like what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about nsxs we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about engineering like japanese race car engineering</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ve invented some</p>
<p>incredible shit</p>
<p>their cars are so reliable</p>
<p>and so i said</p>
<p>the japs have invented some incredible shit</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s like do you know</p>
<p>racist that is like dude i had this argument</p>
<p>last year with someone because</p>
<p>i called someone a jack back home and it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>world war ii</p>
<p>alliance thing that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>racist to call jap</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>past that i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>working around japanese</p>
<p>people for years and i&rsquo;m sure i&rsquo;ve called them jap to</p>
<p>their face and they don&rsquo;t mind</p>
<p>and my mate&rsquo;s like dude it&rsquo;s so fuckin</p>
<p>racist it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>wrong you can&rsquo;t say jap</p>
<p>blah blah blah</p>
<p>so i went to</p>
<p>japan and i</p>
<p>asked my producer</p>
<p>i said dude if i call you a jap</p>
<p>are you offended he goes no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>short for japanese</p>
<p>i got no offence yeah you don&rsquo;t fucking stop</p>
<p>thinking pearl harbor and</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>a bombs on hiroshima</p>
<p>and people thought the nips was far too effective but</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>the japanese say</p>
<p>japan they don&rsquo;t say japan</p>
<p>they say nippon</p>
<p>some people are retarded man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a strange</p>
<p>thing where people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to step on people&rsquo;s toes over nonsense</p>
<p>like an abbreviation of a name is bad</p>
<p>in australia intent</p>
<p>is the only</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s back</p>
<p>intent all and</p>
<p>how do you feel like you say</p>
<p>these japs are fucking badass they make some cool shit</p>
<p>or do you say</p>
<p>these japs these little tiny</p>
<p>cock yellow</p>
<p>motherfuckers coming over here to fuck all the</p>
<p>white women and take all the land and you</p>
<p>start getting</p>
<p>angry well then japs is a bad</p>
<p>thing but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the intent behind it that&rsquo;s bad it&rsquo;s an abbrevy</p>
<p>fucking nation man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pretty</p>
<p>fucking nation so</p>
<p>people are always looking for</p>
<p>a reason to be pissed off people are so pissed off just</p>
<p>about life itself</p>
<p>about traffic and bullshit</p>
<p>and bills and the constant not me at</p>
<p>work everybody has a fuckin</p>
<p>opinion this day man why can&rsquo;t some people just shut</p>
<p>the fuck up</p>
<p>like the fuckin</p>
<p>cocksuckers i read on the internet sometimes it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what qualifies you to have a fuckin opinion that i</p>
<p>should pay attention for</p>
<p>are you sitting behind your website</p>
<p>fuckin getting paid to put your opinion on there</p>
<p>no well even the ones</p>
<p>who are there&rsquo;s a lot of websites out there that are</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of bloggers in my opinion that</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t nearly</p>
<p>as good as some of the commentary guys who post on like</p>
<p>mixed martial arts com</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>fucking intelligent guys that i&rsquo;ve been reading</p>
<p>their post for years and</p>
<p>i know that if there&rsquo;s a post</p>
<p>about anything like serious</p>
<p>well this guy if he posts something</p>
<p>about it this is</p>
<p>gonna be an interesting opinion i want to read this</p>
<p>but how many writers can you say that</p>
<p>about how many</p>
<p>mma writers</p>
<p>very few well i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s more talented people on forums now the</p>
<p>other thing with</p>
<p>mma rod is is</p>
<p>they are blinded to anything outside of the ufc</p>
<p>and i love the ufc</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;m a fucking huge mma fan</p>
<p>josh grosses</p>
<p>josh pretty</p>
<p>oh rush one of</p>
<p>the rare ones a few that aren&rsquo;t but a lot of them are</p>
<p>blinded to anything that is not</p>
<p>ufc they might</p>
<p>be scared yeah they</p>
<p>might be scared</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re scared they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be yanked</p>
<p>their credentials from dana</p>
<p>you know fucking</p>
<p>careful with dana</p>
<p>dana was a play</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s creepy</p>
<p>but a lot of them don&rsquo;t even know anything</p>
<p>about martial arts bro you</p>
<p>could not sit down and have</p>
<p>a conversation and really out</p>
<p>martial arts with them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>dana is so competitive</p>
<p>that he does have this environment where</p>
<p>he feels like they</p>
<p>should pay attention to ufc first</p>
<p>and then if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not very</p>
<p>happy with that</p>
<p>you know i would say</p>
<p>yours is the one</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the promotion it is the one you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>pay attention wise</p>
<p>first and foremost</p>
<p>that attitude in the</p>
<p>pushing it like that is the reason why this fucking</p>
<p>sports is gigantic</p>
<p>the reason why it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going australia exactly he&rsquo;s not lazy</p>
<p>all right he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking on all</p>
<p>fronts you know</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s tough for</p>
<p>journalists you know in that</p>
<p>sense you know</p>
<p>but there are some fucking talented guys out there</p>
<p>like josh gross is a talented journalist</p>
<p>you know and he&rsquo;s honest about shit</p>
<p>sometimes he&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>hypercritical</p>
<p>sometimes guys get like critical</p>
<p>about dudes abilities and characters</p>
<p>and they try to say something bitchy</p>
<p>because if someone puts in a bad performance</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just they feel like you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their job to be critical and to be</p>
<p>shit you better</p>
<p>better to fucking</p>
<p>right about</p>
<p>i did the k one show</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>perfect piece</p>
<p>of you what do you say</p>
<p>about like a crow cop and a mere</p>
<p>fight when crow cop and mere</p>
<p>fight man there&rsquo;s not a lot of positive</p>
<p>things to say</p>
<p>the positive</p>
<p>thing to say is the end of the</p>
<p>fight of course</p>
<p>frank mere landed a perfect knee and put crow cop</p>
<p>away and then</p>
<p>finished them</p>
<p>you know jumped all over him</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing to say but for</p>
<p>everything up before that what</p>
<p>could a writer say</p>
<p>you know so they just</p>
<p>start going off about</p>
<p>just the worst</p>
<p>possible shit that they</p>
<p>could think of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with</p>
<p>frank meer and how</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got this attitude and crow cops</p>
<p>should hang it up and they&rsquo;ll just write</p>
<p>the most bitter fucked up shit</p>
<p>you know i think that the</p>
<p>human drama is far more compelling the real</p>
<p>drama of that</p>
<p>fight you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that was a strange</p>
<p>fight man the</p>
<p>thing with that</p>
<p>fight though is</p>
<p>i liked each</p>
<p>other or something</p>
<p>milko came out and he said even if i lose i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna get cut from ufc</p>
<p>so when i read that i&rsquo;m like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna fucking see this did he</p>
<p>say that he</p>
<p>came out and said one of the websites like miriko</p>
<p>says even if i lose i can&rsquo;t get cut</p>
<p>well if that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t wanna fucking watch that</p>
<p>fight man because</p>
<p>already i know that i&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>that back of your head</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure if he really said that</p>
<p>these words were</p>
<p>maybe misconstrued</p>
<p>very could be</p>
<p>taken out of context</p>
<p>if you lose this</p>
<p>fight do you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ll be kicked out of the</p>
<p>ufc i hope not</p>
<p>merco says he won&rsquo;t be kicked out of the</p>
<p>ufc if he loses his</p>
<p>fight you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>journalism sometimes is that bad yeah it&rsquo;s misconstrued</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be exactly and then</p>
<p>the wrong way i supposedly said i was</p>
<p>like i didn&rsquo;t say it like that you know you&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>that has been the big difference bro</p>
<p>between commentating</p>
<p>outside of america</p>
<p>and then recently coming on to the american scene</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you get</p>
<p>people that sit there and</p>
<p>watch the broadcast</p>
<p>and analyze</p>
<p>every fucking word</p>
<p>and pause and breath you take</p>
<p>and then dissect</p>
<p>it down to the new</p>
<p>creative line it&rsquo;s bad and it&rsquo;s negative but i also</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>for me personally it&rsquo;s good i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned a lot from shitty people</p>
<p>online sing shitty things</p>
<p>because you know</p>
<p>worst case scenario</p>
<p>what can they attack you on is there any</p>
<p>validity in this</p>
<p>total piece of shit who&rsquo;s saying terrible things</p>
<p>about you but do they have a point</p>
<p>and if they do have a point</p>
<p>then you can like</p>
<p>snatch victory from the all</p>
<p>their negative bullshit by</p>
<p>using whatever</p>
<p>and improving it in why if you use it positively</p>
<p>it acts as a</p>
<p>watchdog for your own abilities</p>
<p>and your own</p>
<p>appearances on a</p>
<p>total cunts though</p>
<p>i get personal freedom</p>
<p>out of like</p>
<p>reading the shittiest nastiest</p>
<p>things that like i know just some desperate</p>
<p>angry fuckhead says</p>
<p>and turning it into a positive</p>
<p>thing for me</p>
<p>like i have this little</p>
<p>game that i play with because it&rsquo;s very difficult to do</p>
<p>i want to do like sullen</p>
<p>bob and jstar</p>
<p>like hunt the fuck is</p>
<p>i get mad when you read shit</p>
<p>about yourself to get mad</p>
<p>you get used to it man</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>and i tend not to read a lot of it because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what am i gonna</p>
<p>do sit there and read it and go wow i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>super and fantastic</p>
<p>because people are giving you</p>
<p>these compliments</p>
<p>and then you read people that will bag you</p>
<p>why well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good to know that people are</p>
<p>enjoying what you do it&rsquo;s good to know</p>
<p>to know and to connect with them</p>
<p>and i saw you did that recently on the</p>
<p>underground</p>
<p>you made a yeah</p>
<p>my first time on</p>
<p>the ground yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s plenty of cool</p>
<p>people in there i post on there all the time yes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s plenty of cool people there there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be douchebags</p>
<p>no matter what when you have anonymous</p>
<p>scream names</p>

<p>their own bullshit yeah like</p>
<p>yeah man yeah man</p>
<p>yeah man back they never saw shit and if it got in a</p>
<p>magazine they approved it you know if they</p>
<p>got a newspaper</p>
<p>it had to be like big news like</p>
<p>roman polanski</p>
<p>type news to make it in the newspaper</p>
<p>now man they&rsquo;re all up in your shit</p>
<p>everyday man</p>
<p>everything is just</p>
<p>taken apart and dissected twitter i&rsquo;m getting used</p>
<p>to twitter when twitter is not big in australia dude</p>
<p>like two people in australia who</p>
<p>know about twitter</p>
<p>no one tweeted</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s on fuckin facebook</p>
<p>oh no no one</p>
<p>tweeted in australia</p>
<p>some people are</p>
<p>still stuck on myspace well twitter and facebook online</p>
<p>are connected so if i said something on twitter it goes</p>
<p>to facebook it says it there too</p>
<p>dude i so don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about technology</p>
<p>your house is like fucking nasa</p>
<p>in here man</p>
<p>shuttles and shit</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m a technology junkie dude</p>
<p>unbelievable</p>
<p>fascinated by</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on with technology and then</p>
<p>can you seriously live any higher up on a fucking</p>
<p>mountain or whatever you</p>
<p>hear man when i was living in</p>
<p>colorado i got a</p>
<p>nosebleed drawing up here man</p>
<p>dude this ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>shit this is</p>
<p>civilization compared to</p>
<p>where i was living</p>
<p>i was living</p>
<p>down i was living</p>
<p>eight miles</p>
<p>down a dirt road on the top of a mountain in boulder</p>
<p>man that&rsquo;s why i like to live i like to live up and</p>
<p>above so that when like</p>
<p>waves of water or waves</p>
<p>either waves of</p>
<p>water or waves</p>
<p>of retards you see him coming up the hill i</p>
<p>just like being away i think</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very sensitive to people&rsquo;s energy</p>
<p>and people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thoughts and</p>
<p>their lives and</p>
<p>their bullshit so i like to be as</p>
<p>when i sleep and when i&rsquo;m at home</p>
<p>and when i&rsquo;m riding when i&rsquo;m by myself i like to be as</p>
<p>far away from people as possible i like man it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>cause all the</p>
<p>houses here are different than all the same</p>
<p>and all the</p>
<p>guarded communities i&rsquo;ve seen here in the</p>
<p>states cause we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>guarded communities in oz</p>
<p>the houses look</p>
<p>all the same though and up here they&rsquo;re all different</p>
<p>and on the guard gate there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>guards how&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>two guards named ralph</p>
<p>at once on judy i read the on judy sign there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>three of them</p>
<p>two of them</p>
<p>are named ralph</p>
<p>when you ever get</p>
<p>through ralph&rsquo;s together and</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a conspiracy</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a rule man in the</p>
<p>world like those</p>
<p>coca cola inventors that had to be at</p>
<p>least 50 feet</p>
<p>apart from each</p>
<p>other at all times you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>never see two ralphs</p>
<p>in the coca</p>
<p>cola inventors had to be 50 feet</p>
<p>apart from each</p>
<p>other you never hear that</p>
<p>urban legend as a kid no</p>
<p>like the inventors</p>
<p>of coca cola or the inventors of kfc kentucky</p>
<p>fried chicken with the</p>
<p>secret recipe</p>
<p>that they carry around on them all the time</p>
<p>must at least be 50</p>
<p>feet apart of</p>
<p>one of them dies the</p>
<p>other so if</p>
<p>one of them dies from</p>
<p>the other one survives wow</p>
<p>could you imagine if a recipe was that valuable the kfc</p>
<p>secret living</p>
<p>herbs and spices</p>
<p>nothing will fuck up your kfc</p>
<p>appetite like</p>
<p>watching one of those peta</p>
<p>videos i love fucking children&rsquo;s urban legends man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i told you about</p>
<p>about being a</p>
<p>black belt when the kids said to me in</p>
<p>grade five we&rsquo;re talking about martial arts</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be any more than a</p>
<p>third damn black belt</p>
<p>in australia or you&rsquo;ve got to get out of the country</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re then</p>
<p>lethal weapon</p>
<p>and have a license to kill</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i believe that for years man</p>
<p>i would probably believe it too i</p>
<p>believe wow you just can&rsquo;t get too deadly i guess</p>
<p>speaking about</p>
<p>urban legends</p>
<p>do you get the same ones that</p>
<p>we do here did you guys get the richard gear gerbil</p>
<p>rumor oh in the ass yes</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t get that man</p>
<p>cause i we didn&rsquo;t know what gerbils were</p>
<p>cause we call them</p>
<p>um i think it&rsquo;s what we call guinea pig and no</p>
<p>we have guinea</p>
<p>pigs too guinea pigs are much bigger though</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a drill gerbil&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>rat it&rsquo;s almost like yeah it&rsquo;s like a mouse</p>
<p>now people genuinely stick</p>
<p>mice up there if you</p>
<p>look if you thought of it someone&rsquo;s put it up their ass</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fact</p>
<p>and i knew about this i didn&rsquo;t want to know</p>
<p>about this but i knew</p>
<p>my buddy steve graham who</p>
<p>is a friend of</p>
<p>mine from back when i was like 15 years old and still</p>
<p>still good friends</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a doctor and he did his residency</p>
<p>in miami and</p>
<p>he got to see</p>
<p>everything oh dude my students</p>
<p>tell me about</p>
<p>gunshot wounds and</p>
<p>every day they&rsquo;d be pulling some new</p>
<p>thing out of dude&rsquo;s</p>
<p>asses doctor</p>
<p>nicolet back in melbourne so doctor friend of mine</p>
<p>great doctor to go to dinner with</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;ll tell you our stories for hours</p>
<p>right he has</p>
<p>people to a working dildo the dildo was</p>
<p>still on in a guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>colon it was lodged</p>
<p>it went so far fucking</p>
<p>up his inside</p>
<p>and he had to milk it</p>
<p>out of the guy&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>colon and shoot it out of his ass and the dildo was</p>
<p>still on some</p>
<p>other guy went there and had a fucking brim a fish</p>
<p>up his ass a brim</p>
<p>a fucking brim up his ass</p>
<p>the thing that</p>
<p>shocked my friend the most was glass</p>
<p>he said a lot of them have</p>
<p>glass up their ass they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>stick bottles and</p>
<p>jars and the jars</p>
<p>breaking oh no the</p>
<p>freakiest one what dr nick</p>
<p>told me was</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t about</p>
<p>us was two gay guys that came to see him no one gay</p>
<p>guy came to see him and he had problem with his cock</p>
<p>his cock out of this person</p>
<p>shit coming out of it</p>
<p>so dr nick&rsquo;s had a look at his cock you know he&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what i&rsquo;m seeing here dude it&rsquo;s like what have</p>
<p>what have you been doing</p>
<p>would the reason for this be</p>
<p>so the gay guy</p>
<p>proceeded to tell him he thought well this</p>
<p>might be the reason what him and his gay</p>
<p>lover were doing</p>
<p>that were getting</p>
<p>thin pieces of pipe thin</p>
<p>pieces of piping like this</p>
<p>thing right</p>
<p>long pipes he would</p>
<p>stick it into his urethra</p>
<p>and then connect the</p>
<p>other end to his gay</p>
<p>lovers urethra</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>would piss back</p>
<p>and forth they</p>
<p>would piss between</p>
<p>their cocks</p>
<p>so he was pissing into his</p>
<p>lover&rsquo;s cock</p>
<p>and then his</p>
<p>lover pissing back into his cock</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s going to the doctor saying doc</p>
<p>my cocks will fucking</p>
<p>pass over it why</p>
<p>and doctor nick&rsquo;s like why the fuck do you</p>
<p>think you were sharing</p>
<p>urine with another</p>
<p>human being you</p>
<p>dirty with a</p>
<p>metal through your dick</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably the</p>
<p>metal rod through the dick that fucked him up more</p>
<p>than the piss he seemed back and forth this piss is</p>
<p>basically sterile oh and what was the other</p>
<p>oh the other</p>
<p>story he told me</p>
<p>about this fat</p>
<p>chick that came in one day like mega fat like</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s eating gilbert</p>
<p>grape that fucking big fat chicken five hundred</p>
<p>pounds that&rsquo;s huge</p>
<p>what do you guys use kilos use kilos kilos it</p>
<p>should be like</p>
<p>two hundred and eighty kilos</p>
<p>two hundred i</p>
<p>can bono size five hundred pounds</p>
<p>sounds better though</p>
<p>yeah five hundred</p>
<p>pounds that&rsquo;s like your kazoo size</p>
<p>helos are just too big</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s listen</p>
<p>to this fucking gargantuan</p>
<p>behemoth comes in</p>
<p>right and she came in</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d stuck her tampon</p>
<p>too far up her pussy</p>
<p>so she asked dr</p>
<p>nick to get it out so he had to get like</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>pliers the tongs</p>
<p>and go in this girl&rsquo;s fucking cavern</p>
<p>right but she got through all the fat in her thighs</p>
<p>and pulled out her tampon</p>
<p>she came back the next</p>
<p>month with the very same problem</p>
<p>and she was coming back for four</p>
<p>months in a row</p>
<p>with the same problem</p>
<p>sticking her tampon</p>
<p>too far per cunt</p>
<p>to be able to pull it out</p>
<p>so eventually dr nick realized that when he was</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;d never looked her in the face</p>
<p>cause you don&rsquo;t look her</p>
<p>in the face when you&rsquo;re pulling shit out of her tampon</p>
<p>this time he had he had an inkling</p>
<p>so i was like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s sticking tongues up her pussy</p>
<p>and because this girl&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>animal a fucking beached</p>
<p>whale no one&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>gonna touch her veg right</p>
<p>clit&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>never been touched</p>
<p>since she was born</p>
<p>so that felt good</p>
<p>so for her he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going inside she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>oh yeah like that oh my god and he realized</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s realized that should be</p>
<p>tampons up her</p>
<p>pussy so that he&rsquo;ll go get him</p>
<p>so who&rsquo;d go fucking fish in there</p>
<p>and get the tampons</p>
<p>see for a girl like that there</p>
<p>should be a place</p>
<p>where you go</p>
<p>where guys are just finger you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m all for that you know when i talk</p>
<p>about being for prostitution</p>

<p>dudes eating girls pussies and</p>
<p>fingering them</p>

<p>never understood what the big deal is</p>
<p>about getting a hand job</p>

<p>girl though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way more of a big deal</p>
<p>for a girl what i&rsquo;m saying for girls is</p>
<p>that would be a</p>
<p>sweet spot for them like a</p>
<p>store where they</p>
<p>could just anger</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like a hole</p>
<p>in the wall and hands</p>
<p>just go through and just that way</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to go out with some dude just because you need</p>
<p>you can just fucking</p>

<p>yeah there was like a</p>
<p>karate tournament there yeah</p>
<p>yeah and then there was i</p>
<p>think it might have been i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if it was there&rsquo;s like two parts of the garden just a</p>
<p>smaller part</p>
<p>in the bigger part i don&rsquo;t know you know how much they</p>
<p>how much space they had i was</p>
<p>young i barely remember it</p>
<p>but when i came back to do as a</p>
<p>stand up i was you know</p>
<p>know much more</p>
<p>aware of what was</p>
<p>going on and when i drove up</p>
<p>i drove up the west on highway and saw it for the</p>
<p>first time i remember</p>
<p>going god damn</p>
<p>how fucking big is this like why did they keep</p>
<p>building here have you been to</p>
<p>tokyo no you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been yet</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna come with me to k1 and when you see tokyo</p>
<p>it is fucking insane it&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>sochi can drive for 40 minutes</p>
<p>or an hour and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still built up skyscrapers they</p>
<p>never fuckin end</p>
<p>you look out your window and all the way to the fuckin</p>
<p>horizon all you see</p>
<p>is concrete</p>
<p>it is fucking it the</p>
<p>tokyo is insane is</p>
<p>that is it bigger than new york</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s bigger land wise</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more people there&rsquo;s 30 million people in</p>
<p>13 million of the fuckers</p>
<p>in tokyo man</p>
<p>and still nobody jaywalks can you imagine</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got shibuya</p>
<p>crossing the busiest</p>
<p>crossing in the world</p>
<p>and fucking thousands upon thousands of people</p>
<p>but in japan no one jaywalks</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been walking to</p>
<p>breakfast at four</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock in the morning when i&rsquo;m jet lagged four four</p>
<p>thirty in the morning there&rsquo;s not a car in sight</p>
<p>for fucking</p>
<p>miles and i&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>standing next to a businessman and he</p>
<p>still will not jaywalk</p>
<p>even at 4 30 in the morning we&rsquo;ll wait</p>
<p>for the little man to turn green</p>
<p>why is that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>weird like zombies over there</p>
<p>everything is regimented</p>
<p>on the streets</p>
<p>no one screams</p>
<p>no one swears</p>
<p>no one beeps</p>
<p>their horns</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no graffiti</p>
<p>everyone smiles to each</p>
<p>other everyone is</p>
<p>courteous to each other</p>
<p>it is like a fucking mind boggling overly polite</p>
<p>utopia if you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing</p>
<p>if you could</p>
<p>speak english it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be amazing</p>
<p>if they spoke english</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t insane</p>
<p>the culture</p>
<p>is insane at the</p>
<p>fight shows you&rsquo;ve seen the</p>
<p>fight you hear a</p>
<p>pin drop yeah</p>
<p>you can hear a pin drop</p>
<p>sixty thousand people</p>
<p>forty five thousand of dynamite last year</p>
<p>we used to do eighty thousand for k one eighty thousand</p>
<p>sixty thousand were in osaka</p>
<p>and still they</p>
<p>appreciate moves and get golf clap</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>get a fucking golf clap it&rsquo;s an amazing</p>
<p>culture amanda</p>
<p>the tokyo experience i want</p>
<p>you to come with me one day in your fucking life well i</p>
<p>would love to to go see k1 i&rsquo;ve always want to see</p>
<p>k1 grand prix</p>
<p>live i&rsquo;ve always want to see that yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be i&rsquo;m a big fan</p>
<p>of it and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why i love hd net</p>
<p>fights you know it&rsquo;s like fuck</p>
<p>you know finally</p>
<p>you know mayhem and i were talking</p>
<p>about it when we did</p>
<p>inside mma i saw that</p>
<p>you may have</p>
<p>not cuban on that it was great</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about how it used to be if you wanted to</p>
<p>watch k1 you had to get</p>
<p>these fucking grainy vhs tapes or</p>
<p>get some shit off the internet</p>
<p>but now you can</p>
<p>watch it in high def you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>awesome scary</p>
<p>witching some of the</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>exciting that is who</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know k1 you have no</p>
<p>idea but you know because most of</p>
<p>what people like in the ufc</p>
<p>is striking that&rsquo;s what the average person like</p>
<p>striking like</p>
<p>people boo and</p>
<p>shit goes to the ground happens all the time</p>
<p>for those people that are just like they just want to</p>
<p>watch some violence</p>
<p>what the fuck is more violent than k1</p>
<p>and who the fuck is more violent than alistar</p>
<p>ovary man fucking</p>
<p>scary yeah somebody in</p>
<p>cracked crack com</p>
<p>wrote that he looks like</p>
<p>he was genetically engineered to fuck your girlfriend</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pretty sure it was</p>
<p>crack com i hope i&rsquo;m crediting the</p>
<p>right people oh man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what he looks like dude he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>freak which leads me to the question now</p>
<p>cause when we spoke</p>
<p>last time on the</p>
<p>voice verses</p>
<p>the whole rage then was phaidor</p>
<p>versus brock and we</p>
<p>spoke a lot</p>
<p>about fatal</p>
<p>versus brock yeah</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>after fatal losing a verdsum that fights</p>
<p>lost its luster completely</p>
<p>yeah so now everyone is like</p>
<p>over in versus brock</p>
<p>yeah what do you</p>
<p>think over i want to see over</p>
<p>in versus fade or two</p>
<p>i want to see that</p>
<p>alice wants that</p>
<p>fight badly</p>
<p>like he is all over we did the</p>
<p>voice versus</p>
<p>alistair over him we shot it in</p>
<p>korea and man he</p>
<p>really wants to</p>
<p>fight fight you know what here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing with alstar</p>
<p>over him you got to fucking take him down</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all that talk of</p>
<p>standing there&rsquo;s all out the window now</p>
<p>it used to be the guys could</p>
<p>stand without</p>
<p>alstar like chuck</p>
<p>stood with him for a bit</p>
<p>chuck actually shot in for a takedown with him</p>
<p>you know the problem with</p>
<p>alstar was always that he was trying to make 205</p>
<p>yeah that was always the problem yeah</p>
<p>and he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>dedicated like he is now but once that</p>
<p>motherfucker went up to</p>
<p>heavyweight and</p>
<p>started getting</p>
<p>dedicated he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s scary as fuck the</p>
<p>thing is like last weekend</p>
<p>he knocked out ben edwards</p>
<p>ben&rsquo;s an aussie</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been commentating him for like 16 years</p>
<p>tough fucker though</p>
<p>right tough</p>
<p>fucker very</p>
<p>tough guy alistair</p>
<p>dropped him</p>
<p>three times but three</p>
<p>clean shots and the</p>
<p>thing is that</p>
<p>usually alistair</p>
<p>would get away</p>
<p>with a lot because of his strength and his size alone</p>
<p>but now his technique is just</p>
<p>superb man and</p>
<p>you know he was</p>
<p>training in thailand for like</p>
<p>three weeks at the golden</p>
<p>glory gym in thailand</p>
<p>doing proper muay thai</p>
<p>training though the thai</p>
<p>train is there helping them out</p>
<p>and you can</p>
<p>tell that he&rsquo;s just lifted his game to another fuckin</p>
<p>level dude he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spooky right now oh</p>
<p>spooky his stand up is</p>
<p>spooky yeah</p>
<p>you know i love the fact that he goes</p>
<p>back and forth though i love the fact that he goes into</p>
<p>mma and to respect</p>
<p>a man back and forth probably</p>
<p>the only god doing it at that high</p>
<p>level no one else of course</p>
<p>at that highest</p>
<p>level for sure not even no question</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no one even that</p>
<p>compares the</p>
<p>level of k1 that he&rsquo;s achieved and the</p>
<p>level of mma</p>
<p>i mean cause we&rsquo;ve always had guys who say like oh</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>striker and you know they are for mma</p>
<p>but alstar is a really good</p>
<p>striker for k1 exactly but who can adjust to</p>
<p>mma striking</p>
<p>which is very</p>
<p>impressive man</p>
<p>cause you know the distancing</p>
<p>the footwork is all</p>
<p>completely different from</p>
<p>mma striking</p>
<p>k1 striking so</p>
<p>to swing between them at the two highest</p>
<p>levels is this is an</p>
<p>incinertory dude when he put it to brett</p>
<p>rogers i was like</p>
<p>he threw it man he fucking</p>
<p>threw him it</p>
<p>was it was that</p>
<p>but it was before he</p>
<p>threw him he was fucking him up on his feet</p>
<p>yeah he hit brett</p>
<p>rogers with</p>
<p>he ducked under a</p>
<p>right hand and hit him with a leg kick</p>
<p>and then and then popped out of the way and you</p>
<p>could see the look on</p>
<p>rogers face he was like</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>roger was like what the fuck</p>
<p>am i doing here</p>
<p>it was a joke</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>oh shit like you know nobody ever kicked him</p>
<p>like that before dude to me it was just like you know</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;ll just bend over you can fuck me in the ass</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s gonna be less painful</p>
<p>than the beating you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to put on</p>
<p>motherfucker dude</p>
<p>digs that shin</p>
<p>into that meat ba boom</p>
<p>and there was that yeah that look on</p>
<p>roger&rsquo;s face like for a</p>
<p>second you saw this flash like</p>
<p>god damn he just got hit by</p>
<p>lightning fuck</p>
<p>alice is a freak</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be cleans up on the</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big problem to me that there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these organizations if there was just the ufc</p>
<p>we would know who is the best but alstar</p>
<p>would not have gotten to become alstar if it wasn&rsquo;t for</p>
<p>fighting all</p>
<p>these other organizations you know</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>fights in the</p>
<p>ufc there&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>enough shows there&rsquo;s only so many shows like we need</p>
<p>other organizations</p>
<p>but i just wish they</p>
<p>could fucking just</p>
<p>figure out a way to work it out</p>
<p>where they get to fight each</p>
<p>other just all come together as friends for one</p>
<p>night for one</p>
<p>night the problem</p>
<p>is and then</p>
<p>maybe you and i</p>
<p>could come and take together finally for once it</p>
<p>would have to</p>
<p>be one night</p>
<p>the problem is that</p>
<p>ufc is such a much</p>
<p>bigger name and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worth so much more</p>
<p>money and it</p>
<p>would lend respectability to straightforward</p>
<p>which would</p>
<p>build up the enemy</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t really do it unfortunately</p>
<p>business wise fuck</p>
<p>but yeah i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>rock you know brock is like</p>
<p>the perfect guy to like sell</p>
<p>as like a heavyweight</p>
<p>champion oh fucking no the fucking</p>
<p>skull you know what</p>
<p>worried me man</p>
<p>brock they think brock</p>
<p>fighting alistair</p>
<p>and the way that he turned on</p>
<p>those punches from karwin</p>
<p>oh my god what if yeah if that was alistair</p>
<p>and how about</p>
<p>those knees</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s got knees like alstar alstar</p>
<p>knees you into fucking porn</p>
<p>the one he fucked</p>
<p>fujita with on new</p>
<p>year&rsquo;s eve moved to</p>
<p>gta into a mini coma</p>
<p>yeah he was out</p>
<p>for how long he was fucking out for 10 minutes at least</p>
<p>then they took him to</p>
<p>the hospital and he went in the mini coma at hospital</p>
<p>he was fucked</p>
<p>and lsd said to me</p>
<p>cause i said to him</p>
<p>dude do you ever feel</p>
<p>any remorse</p>
<p>for just fucking</p>
<p>smashing people&rsquo;s faces and</p>
<p>brains with</p>
<p>those knees</p>
<p>and he goes yeah he goes fujita</p>
<p>he goes i actually felt really bad</p>
<p>after i did it</p>
<p>wow i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>what about to</p>
<p>share a man you almost killed that</p>
<p>fucker in the</p>
<p>grand prix i thought to</p>
<p>share it was dead</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like yeah to</p>
<p>share it was</p>
<p>harsh he goes but fujita</p>
<p>he actually</p>
<p>was troubled by it he felt really</p>
<p>sorry well i</p>
<p>think it was cause</p>
<p>fujita had already</p>
<p>been knocked out and been</p>
<p>stopped a few times and he was old it&rsquo;s a legend and</p>
<p>i respected</p>
<p>the hell out of him</p>
<p>man that his body</p>
<p>clearly didn&rsquo;t look the same anymore he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look like an athlete anymore i was just fucking violent</p>
<p>and you remember when he ford</p>
<p>james thompson in</p>
<p>dream yeah the</p>
<p>standing guillotine yeah</p>
<p>he just say the muscles and</p>
<p>he walked him back well he&rsquo;s fucking what&rsquo;s up with you</p>
<p>man he tab v</p>
<p>tour fucking</p>
<p>awesome who else is tab v</p>
<p>tour that with a guiting</p>
<p>you know all stars</p>
<p>nasty bro he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nasty he&rsquo;s nasty</p>
<p>you know what brock lesnar</p>
<p>versus alistar</p>
<p>would be a dream</p>
<p>match but brock&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta get past kane</p>
<p>velasquez dude</p>
<p>that is ripe for</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t call it an</p>
<p>upset i was</p>
<p>gonna say is</p>
<p>right for an</p>
<p>upset but i don&rsquo;t call it an</p>
<p>upset if cain</p>
<p>beats brock</p>
<p>because cain</p>
<p>has all the weapons</p>
<p>to be able to beat brock</p>
<p>cain might be the</p>
<p>motherfucker yeah</p>
<p>he might be the</p>
<p>motherfucker yeah</p>
<p>you know i think brock is a is</p>
<p>a handful for any man on the planet</p>
<p>he proved in that last</p>
<p>fight that he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>like a serious ability to overcome adversity and still</p>
<p>got it out and make it through he didn&rsquo;t tap he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>freak out he</p>
<p>covered himself up he protected himself</p>
<p>and he was getting bombed on by</p>
<p>other than him the biggest</p>
<p>strongest fucking guy in the division</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely the best</p>
<p>puncher in the division and no one</p>
<p>punches as hard as carl and</p>
<p>carl he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>wrecking balls you</p>
<p>know he just</p>
<p>dropped bumps</p>
<p>he got through all that</p>
<p>made it through that first</p>
<p>round and then came out and won it immediately into the</p>
<p>second so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s overcome adversity</p>
<p>believes in himself he&rsquo;s a winner</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all well and good though</p>
<p>kane velasquez is a fucking</p>
<p>storm that you know here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something something that bob cook said they were</p>
<p>they were talking</p>
<p>about one of the</p>
<p>fights that</p>
<p>came to just fucking</p>
<p>i think was rothwell</p>
<p>just ran him over</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>he said well you know</p>
<p>the thing with</p>
<p>fighting kane is</p>
<p>you always think that you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna ride out the storm</p>
<p>he goes but the</p>
<p>storm doesn&rsquo;t end</p>
<p>that is what that guy does when the</p>
<p>storm doesn&rsquo;t end it just</p>
<p>punches and kicks and punches and kicks</p>
<p>and fucking takedowns and</p>
<p>punches and kicks and punches kicks</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>where is this motherfucker getting all this cardio from</p>
<p>he does it all with</p>
<p>power man that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>scary thing it&rsquo;s all fucking with power and he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fade</p>
<p>yeah he doesn&rsquo;t fade he comes out strong in the third</p>
<p>when he molested</p>
<p>check congo</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what that match was that was a</p>
<p>three round molestation</p>
<p>i mean he took bombs bomb big shots on the jaw</p>
<p>knees buckle</p>
<p>almost goes down and then</p>
<p>three seconds</p>
<p>later he&rsquo;s executed to take down his inside control</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s smashing them</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>that was just like that was overwhelming</p>
<p>man there was overwhelming what he did to that guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a motherfucker</p>
<p>dude i can&rsquo;t wait for that i can&rsquo;t wait to see</p>

<p>star i mean i</p>
<p>would like to see</p>
<p>alice our clean out</p>
<p>strike force to</p>
<p>i would like i</p>
<p>think if alstar can</p>
<p>beat verdun that</p>
<p>would be a huge rematch i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s anyone in</p>
<p>strike force honestly that will touch him</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>man verduum gets him on the ground i bet verduum</p>
<p>has a saying that i bet he</p>
<p>would try to tap</p>
<p>alstar i bet he</p>
<p>thinks he can</p>
<p>he did you know he&rsquo;s capable</p>
<p>of doing it didn&rsquo;t he do it before didn&rsquo;t he tap</p>
<p>alstar he did like what</p>
<p>pride 2007 or</p>
<p>2005 he&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>guy man that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>but guess what</p>
<p>different verdoom too</p>
<p>verduum just getting off of that</p>
<p>victory over phaedor he</p>
<p>thinks he can tap any buzz</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll jump and fucking guard</p>
<p>you he&rsquo;ll fly and</p>
<p>guard on you</p>
<p>just to try</p>
<p>to lock you up in his legs you know i was there that</p>
<p>night and its</p>
<p>strike force when fatal</p>
<p>tap that was surreal</p>
<p>shit dude watching that ring side</p>
<p>that was surreal i&rsquo;m bad</p>
<p>i would have like</p>
<p>to have seen that one it</p>
<p>was sad it was crazy</p>
<p>why sad no big deal just got caught i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s happy it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happy that we&rsquo;re doing pulled it off</p>
<p>verduum&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>for the doom man and he&rsquo;s awesome but it</p>
<p>was sad to actually be present at the</p>
<p>one night where fader actually loses now</p>
<p>as opposed to</p>
<p>never have been present in any of his other</p>
<p>fights yeah nah it&rsquo;s not sad though you were there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no big deal you can</p>
<p>appreciate all the</p>
<p>other ones too yeah</p>
<p>you know i mean he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a special athlete he&rsquo;s a very very interesting guy to a</p>
<p>very fascinating</p>
<p>personality but</p>
<p>the bottom line is the only way to get through a</p>
<p>guard like verdoom</p>
<p>is you got to</p>
<p>train with a guy like verdoom</p>
<p>if he was training with guys like verdoom we would hear</p>
<p>about it we</p>
<p>would hear oh</p>
<p>you know he just went down and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know spending</p>
<p>three weeks with minotaur</p>
<p>minotaro is</p>
<p>gonna work on his guard</p>
<p>yeah you know you don&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>about all that shit so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically working with</p>
<p>these guys that are pretty good they&rsquo;re decent and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got so much</p>
<p>confidence because he&rsquo;s undefeated in 10 years</p>
<p>and he thinks he can just fall into verdun</p>
<p>guard you&rsquo;ll be just</p>
<p>punch them in the face you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do that with verdun</p>
<p>yeah it was a cattle</p>
<p>mistake man and i</p>
<p>could just last night</p>
<p>on another level yeah</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t appreciate</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve rolled with guys like for doom before</p>
<p>and not that</p>
<p>level but like jean jacques machado</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s that level as far as international</p>
<p>and they just run through you i mean</p>
<p>just slap shit on you and if you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t felt that</p>
<p>level if you&rsquo;re not in there all the time</p>
<p>training with that</p>
<p>you can get overconfident</p>
<p>i bet anybody that phaidor</p>
<p>puts in his</p>
<p>guard or they get in</p>
<p>when phaidor gets in someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>guard in his camp</p>
<p>i bet he just runs through him</p>
<p>he postures up</p>
<p>breaks free</p>
<p>nobody probably taps him with triangles</p>
<p>but he slaps that shit on like like a fucking</p>
<p>octopus from hell</p>
<p>just like bitch you ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going nowhere</p>
<p>fucking just attacks and adjusts and attacks and</p>
<p>every time fade or defends he gets deeper in the hole</p>
<p>the fight was held on for as long</p>
<p>as he could man</p>
<p>but when he</p>
<p>was like oh my god he&rsquo;s fucking tapping</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna get his arm broken</p>
<p>his arms were</p>
<p>about to go</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker but he just made a mistake yeah</p>
<p>everybody needs to work</p>
<p>with the best guys it used to be that everybody was</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>could be able to have</p>
<p>like this little camp and it was just you and a couple</p>
<p>other guys that you</p>
<p>trained with but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you can rock it like that anymore</p>
<p>i think the</p>
<p>levels just gotten too high</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s got to</p>
<p>train with the</p>
<p>best guys well this is the reason why golden glory</p>
<p>in holland have so much</p>
<p>success in k1 and also</p>
<p>mixed martial arts because the best guys are there</p>
<p>not only and they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>fight each other and they&rsquo;ll fight each</p>
<p>other and like semi</p>
<p>shot now so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fight each</p>
<p>other they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fight each</p>
<p>other and they&rsquo;ll go for broke</p>
<p>errol zimmerman</p>
<p>fought semi schlt</p>
<p>earlier this year and he went for</p>
<p>went for broke on</p>
<p>semi you know they&rsquo;re both from the same gym</p>
<p>and when they spa together over in holland</p>
<p>their sparring sessions are as hard as k1 fights</p>
<p>they have like this day they call meet wednesday</p>
<p>and everyone on wednesday</p>
<p>just goes in the gym just beats the fuck out of each</p>
<p>other like a k1</p>
<p>style fight</p>
<p>and these guys are best mates asaki</p>
<p>will beat on zimmerman</p>
<p>the two best mates</p>
<p>would beat the fuck out of each other</p>
<p>smart you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how they</p>
<p>trained in holland</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not only a golden</p>
<p>glory that&rsquo;s at every</p>
<p>dutch gym it&rsquo;s always been the</p>
<p>dutch style the</p>
<p>ties go hard</p>
<p>a completely opposite</p>
<p>the ties will go late into</p>
<p>barring the</p>
<p>ties will go</p>
<p>light inspiring</p>
<p>heavy on pad work</p>
<p>ties are always ferocious on</p>
<p>pads and on bags</p>
<p>but inspiring the</p>
<p>ties spa light</p>
<p>the dutch go</p>
<p>light on the bags and the pads</p>
<p>but they fucking cane each</p>
<p>other inspiring</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>dutch way of approaching</p>
<p>things it&rsquo;s just a mate and then you got guys like</p>
<p>you know one of the sparring partners is ramon</p>
<p>deckers man</p>
<p>right i mean ramon</p>
<p>deckers maybe the</p>
<p>greatest moyed tie</p>
<p>fighter ever</p>

<p>chalkboard you can buy</p>
<p>it all man big chalkboard like one of those dry erase</p>
<p>boards filled with like different</p>
<p>strains and this is how much it is announced</p>
<p>as much as an eighth</p>
<p>amazing they have</p>
<p>50 60 varieties</p>
<p>everywhere all the time</p>
<p>like sativas very difficult</p>
<p>to grow there it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s harder to grow than indica</p>
<p>sativa sativas</p>
<p>like spaceweed yeah</p>
<p>well you go to the</p>
<p>place near my</p>
<p>house ten different varieties oh really that&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>different varieties of sativa</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>sativa and when you&rsquo;re living in the east</p>
<p>coast where it&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>hard as fuck to get a</p>
<p>good sativa you&rsquo;ve got to know somebody who&rsquo;s a grower</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s willing to take a chance</p>
<p>to make a superior weed it&rsquo;s like it</p>
<p>takes more time and so it cost more</p>
<p>money and the yield is</p>
<p>smaller dude when i</p>
<p>was in amsterdam i smoked a</p>
<p>vaporized bong</p>
<p>and it fucked me because</p>
<p>peter goes hey</p>
<p>thank you try this try this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bong and i hate smoking but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke much anyway</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve smoked</p>
<p>bongs a couple of times but to me they feel</p>
<p>dirty right</p>
<p>right so you put this</p>
<p>thing to my</p>
<p>mouth and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>computer i can&rsquo;t see anything here</p>
<p>no effect nothing goes no no this do it again</p>
<p>peter i can&rsquo;t fucking i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s lit nothing about</p>
<p>oh fuck almost like what the fuck was</p>
<p>that it comes out it&rsquo;s miss</p>
<p>right you couldn&rsquo;t say it it&rsquo;s invisible</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t know what a vapor is</p>
<p>does is it heats the thc</p>
<p>to a point where it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t burn the plant material</p>
<p>but it burns off the thc and makes a</p>
<p>vapor out of it invisible</p>
<p>you cannot see it well</p>
<p>you can sort of see it i didn&rsquo;t know i was breathing</p>
<p>exhaling any</p>
<p>smoke nothing you</p>
<p>sort of see it but it looks like not much</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t like you get used to like see</p>
<p>smoke a joint</p>
<p>take a deep breath</p>
<p>blow it out there&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>cloud in front of you this is not a big cloud i was</p>
<p>expecting big cloud i was like fucking i wanted her</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pure sensation too it was</p>
<p>crazy man it was like</p>
<p>crazy there&rsquo;s something in the burning of the</p>
<p>plant too i wonder if that has a psychoactive effect</p>
<p>like i wonder if there&rsquo;s a psychoactive</p>
<p>effect from the actual burning of the leaves</p>
<p>like maybe together</p>
<p>those things like</p>
<p>maybe it calms you a bit or something</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s like hundreds of different</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>leaves do you think there are</p>
<p>leaves out there though</p>
<p>on shit out there that no one has thought to</p>
<p>smoke that is yet to be discovered as smokeable</p>
<p>do you think like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like mud or dirt out there that someone could</p>
<p>maybe roll into a fuckin</p>
<p>piece of paper and smoke it</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s like smoked that mud</p>
<p>or that fucking seashell</p>
<p>or that fucking a sea</p>
<p>urchin that you can</p>
<p>smoke it there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be shit out there that no one had discovered</p>
<p>you could smoke yet</p>
<p>for sure plants</p>
<p>i mean if you look at the amazon</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t marijuana</p>
<p>discovered like we discovered from goats eating it</p>
<p>really like fucking</p>
<p>in ancient days goats were eating it and then goats</p>
<p>were swaying in the paddocks</p>
<p>so the farmers are like hmm</p>
<p>the goats eat this strange looking</p>
<p>weird and they stumble in paddock</p>
<p>we must try to eat it</p>
<p>where the hell do you hear that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what one of my friends was telling</p>
<p>it might be another aussie</p>
<p>urban legend but i</p>
<p>heard it was goats discovered weed</p>
<p>yeah that doesn&rsquo;t even make</p>
<p>sense the goats</p>
<p>would hi on</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t fucking know man you telling me there&rsquo;s ten</p>

<p>all i know is when i did that</p>
<p>vaporized bong</p>
<p>twenty minutes</p>
<p>later i was in a</p>
<p>place called banana bar</p>
<p>and some fucking</p>
<p>dirty hooker was</p>
<p>shooting these</p>
<p>giant dildos out of her</p>
<p>pussy and hitting me in the chest</p>

<p>boat ride from hong kong it&rsquo;s between</p>
<p>china and hong kong</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a tiny casino island</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like the vegas of asia it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy madhouse casino</p>
<p>island it&rsquo;s fucking insane</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve seen some dirty ass sex shows in macau</p>
<p>with this one chick had the darts</p>
<p>the darts in her pussy</p>
<p>and there were balloons up on the ceiling and with</p>
<p>pinpoint fuckin sniper precision</p>
<p>she would lean back fire a dart</p>
<p>pop the balloons one after the other jesus</p>
<p>christ another chick had</p>
<p>razor blades</p>
<p>right strung together</p>
<p>and she reaches into her vag</p>
<p>and pulls out</p>
<p>this line of razor blades one after the</p>
<p>other and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bullshit that it&rsquo;s made of plastic or something</p>
<p>then she grabs the razor</p>
<p>blades and to show one of the ones that came out of her</p>
<p>pussy gets a</p>
<p>piece of paper</p>
<p>slices a piece of paper</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like that&rsquo;s fucking sick yeah you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s funny that you just brought that up because</p>
<p>there was a conversation we had on here last week</p>
<p>about the hookers in vietnam</p>
<p>whether or not they really did put</p>
<p>razor blades up the</p>
<p>pussy i&rsquo;ve seen it</p>
<p>i have seen it well you see a</p>
<p>razor blade</p>
<p>razor blades come out of the</p>
<p>pussy so they easily</p>
<p>could have done that to gi&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>stuck a razor</p>
<p>blade in there and then the guy fucks them and it cuts</p>
<p>their dick in half</p>
<p>man one of my</p>
<p>mates in australia fingered a girl on a club once and</p>
<p>he went to finger her and he felt scabs inside her</p>

<p>fucking touching that hand put a fucking</p>
<p>glove on oh my</p>
<p>scabs in her</p>
<p>pussy are you</p>
<p>stick it in your box</p>
<p>honey yeah exactly</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s some evil shit</p>
<p>going on down there</p>
<p>girls say the guys balls look disgusting and</p>
<p>wrinkled and shit</p>
<p>but man i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>some girls sometimes need to get a mirror and</p>
<p>stand over it and look down and see how fucked up</p>
<p>their vegs look</p>
<p>some girls got some fucked up pussies happening man</p>
<p>really the ones that the big flappy fucking lot on the</p>
<p>fucking lips</p>
<p>like that you get a like</p>
<p>i like dude</p>
<p>i like that man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen ones that fucking hang</p>
<p>down like that man it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>the trippiest</p>
<p>thing ever is when you look at female bodybuilders and</p>
<p>you see the little dicks that they&rsquo;re growing the clit</p>
<p>because of the</p>
<p>roids cause i used to edit</p>
<p>a bodybuilding</p>
<p>magazine back in the day so i used to</p>
<p>interview a lot of female</p>
<p>bodybuilders</p>
<p>and their clit</p>
<p>comes like that like a</p>
<p>small dick but</p>
<p>they are i never</p>
<p>i never fucked any bodybuilders before i was told</p>
<p>being in the industry</p>
<p>is like they are the horniest fucking cunts out there</p>
<p>female bodybuilsters</p>
<p>right and because all you need to do is</p>
<p>touch their big</p>
<p>penis clitoris</p>
<p>and i basically have an orgasm like</p>
<p>insanely sexually</p>
<p>sexually excited</p>
<p>creatures all the time</p>
<p>get sometimes the doctor a doctor will put a</p>
<p>woman on testosterone for something like we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>some sort of an ailment you know</p>
<p>usually they got skin disease</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re young</p>
<p>the girls will go on</p>
<p>on on steroids on</p>
<p>testosterone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a shame because one of my friends</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a photographer back home and when she was</p>
<p>young i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>photos of her</p>
<p>she was a beautiful beautiful young girl</p>
<p>but then she</p>
<p>started to develop</p>
<p>skin problems and bad acne that was something hormonal</p>
<p>and she had to go on steroids to get rid of it and then</p>
<p>now she&rsquo;s fucking fucked up ugly like bad the poor</p>
<p>thing she&rsquo;s fucked up she looks like a man</p>
<p>our nickname for her behind her back is unimar</p>
<p>she looks like a fucking animal wow but yeah she used</p>
<p>to be beautiful</p>
<p>she was hot when she was young</p>
<p>and then unfortunately how young</p>
<p>uh you know when</p>
<p>she was fucking</p>
<p>eight nine years old</p>
<p>what the fuck hot</p>
<p>cute kid what the fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with you know</p>
<p>well there are some girls though that</p>
<p>start out really pretty and something some</p>
<p>monkey wrench</p>
<p>goes along the way and then the</p>
<p>the design of the universe decides to take it back</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re not hot anymore</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;ve seen that happen</p>
<p>girls were really</p>
<p>pretty when they were like thirteen or fourteen</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>graduate high</p>
<p>school and you run into when they&rsquo;re like</p>

<p>of years how old you have to be in australia no no</p>
<p>you can fuck at 16</p>
<p>but you can only fuck someone who is</p>
<p>under 18 oh</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be over 18 and fuck a 16 year old</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s smart</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s good move yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s you can</p>
<p>stop 16 year olds from fucking</p>
<p>sorry come on</p>
<p>but you guys have a more</p>
<p>relaxed attitude towards a lot of</p>
<p>things over there yeah it&rsquo;s much more relaxed</p>
<p>when you got out of high</p>
<p>school let me ask</p>
<p>you this because this is the big</p>
<p>thing in america&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know america</p>
<p>well i grew up in newton massachusetts and newton was</p>
<p>a you know a lot of</p>
<p>successful people</p>
<p>lived there</p>
<p>know a lot of people who were like</p>
<p>you know doctors and lawyers and they were very</p>
<p>into their kids academic careers and like you know it</p>
<p>was like it was a</p>
<p>school where</p>
<p>was like it was a very good</p>
<p>school like really</p>
<p>highly rated</p>
<p>and everybody was</p>
<p>super ambitious</p>
<p>to get out there and to go to college and to get</p>
<p>things done</p>
<p>when you guys</p>
<p>graduated do you feel like this</p>
<p>enormous pressure</p>
<p>to go make something</p>
<p>of your life no not really the college</p>
<p>system that you have in the</p>
<p>states doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist in australia</p>
<p>what is how do you guys do it</p>
<p>so we go high</p>
<p>school right</p>
<p>then after high</p>
<p>school go to university</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have frets we don&rsquo;t live on</p>
<p>campus and we don&rsquo;t move into</p>
<p>state to go to</p>
<p>university in fact</p>
<p>in america wherever i go no one is ever from the</p>
<p>state where i meet them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>massachusetts or boston</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re originally</p>
<p>from massachusetts yeah</p>
<p>okay so you&rsquo;re from massachusetts you live in in</p>
<p>california right everyone is from a different</p>
<p>state to where they were born</p>
<p>whereas in australia</p>
<p>everyone pretty much remains wherever you&rsquo;re born</p>
<p>really you grow up you&rsquo;re born in melbourne</p>
<p>you grow up in melbourne you work in melbourne</p>
<p>have a family in melbourne went to</p>
<p>university melbourne you&rsquo;ll die in melbourne</p>
<p>no one ever goes to much the</p>
<p>university&rsquo;s interstate and moves around everyone is</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not really that that feel of i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotta go out and conquer the</p>
<p>world and become a politician or</p>
<p>change the world in any way it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>fuck it i finished high</p>
<p>school i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>relax it&rsquo;s not even so much go out and conquer the</p>
<p>world is don&rsquo;t be a fuckin loser</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of pressure</p>
<p>go out and you know get a fucking job let&rsquo;s go get</p>
<p>no the problem</p>
<p>is in australia because</p>
<p>our economy is really good at the moment yours is</p>
<p>now is really good ours really</p>
<p>strong against</p>
<p>against the us dollar</p>
<p>but the thing</p>
<p>in australia</p>
<p>the doll is that</p>
<p>easy to get</p>
<p>the doll is easy to get by</p>
<p>so you can be a bludger and just</p>
<p>claim the doll</p>
<p>every two doll</p>
<p>meaning welfare oh doll meaning welfare</p>
<p>yeah and it&rsquo;s decent the dolls</p>
<p>i know people that live solely off the doll</p>
<p>really that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>how much you get</p>
<p>maybe a fortnight</p>
<p>man you know</p>
<p>for tonight what are you oh sorry</p>
<p>double stills kid</p>
<p>fortnite you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that word in america</p>
<p>beer motherfucker</p>
<p>fortnite fortnite is too loud</p>
<p>maybe if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>my chicks watching the</p>
<p>tutors and i&rsquo;m trying to get some</p>
<p>pussy of fortnite</p>
<p>you might get</p>
<p>like two hundred and</p>

<p>fuck you in a fortnite</p>
<p>in the ass darling yes</p>
<p>maybe two hundred bucks</p>
<p>every two weeks two hundred and</p>
<p>twenty bucks</p>
<p>every two weeks</p>
<p>highly livable</p>
<p>you can live</p>
<p>off that yeah i</p>
<p>guess if you had</p>
<p>to and that&rsquo;s for doing nothing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing for what we call in australia a dull bludger</p>
<p>wow yeah and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>those a lot of</p>
<p>dull bludger does that keep everybody calm so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always something even if you&rsquo;re a fucking loser</p>
<p>you always have something you don&rsquo;t have to rob and</p>
<p>steal and yeah do you know is</p>
<p>there an argument for that</p>
<p>is there an argument for the</p>
<p>idiots are always</p>
<p>gonna be idiots</p>
<p>losers are always</p>
<p>gonna be losers</p>
<p>just if you give a little bit</p>
<p>money you know who cares this is this way at</p>
<p>least they have something you</p>
<p>hope that they&rsquo;re invested back into the economy</p>
<p>but no it&rsquo;s usually invested well</p>
<p>unless you in your</p>
<p>yeah drug dealer were</p>
<p>purchasing the alcohol</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s far too easy this</p>
<p>is too many</p>
<p>is that a strategy though</p>
<p>that you know like let&rsquo;s let people be fucking</p>
<p>losers and just take care of them</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;ll be less crime</p>
<p>does that make</p>
<p>sense yeah i</p>
<p>can ask him</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a strategy the dole didn&rsquo;t come in</p>
<p>until like 1975</p>
<p>when it was a life</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have it then if people are forced to catch up</p>
<p>right people are forced to</p>
<p>pay their own way and you know yeah</p>
<p>and the bad</p>
<p>thing is though i know a guy who&rsquo;s on the doll</p>
<p>and he will not get off his</p>
<p>ass to get a job he will not even go for job interviews</p>
<p>he claims that he&rsquo;s got some</p>
<p>disability or whatever</p>
<p>which he hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>dude my fucking</p>
<p>taxes that i work hard for my</p>
<p>money and i&rsquo;ve got to give</p>
<p>money to the government pay fucking taxes</p>
<p>then go in your pocket to pay you to</p>
<p>drink alcohol i sit at home all day but i</p>
<p>would rather</p>
<p>give my tax</p>
<p>money to losers and</p>
<p>drunks and idiots</p>
<p>and people with no ambition whatsoever than to war</p>
<p>i would rather</p>
<p>oh look i don&rsquo;t</p>

<p>and the vatican</p>
<p>and the catholic church as a</p>
<p>institution</p>
<p>but immediately before you set foot in the door of the</p>
<p>vatican on the</p>
<p>street there are</p>
<p>the most disgusting disfigured</p>
<p>nailed up beggars you will ever see</p>

<p>has cleaned up all the beggars and the</p>
<p>gypsies and move them but i want</p>
<p>to know even where</p>

<p>one million people one million were relocated</p>
<p>suddenly to build</p>
<p>the ibc the international broadcast center for the</p>
<p>media and the car park</p>
<p>whoa one million people lost</p>
<p>their homes</p>
<p>virtually overnight</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they wake up one morning and they go</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re out of here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s insane one million</p>
<p>how the fuck did they more</p>
<p>than the entire</p>
<p>population of san francisco that&rsquo;s moved</p>
<p>virtually overnight</p>
<p>dude you have an idea</p>
<p>after going to the</p>
<p>olympic games and</p>
<p>spending three weeks in beijing</p>
<p>i came back and i told everyone</p>
<p>if the fuckin chinese ever</p>
<p>wanna take over the world</p>
<p>they will do it in the</p>
<p>space of a fucking month</p>
<p>the way they the amount of people they have</p>
<p>and the organisation they have</p>
<p>and the manpower and the ability and the</p>
<p>technology and</p>
<p>having seen that in</p>
<p>japan as well that</p>
<p>whole region</p>
<p>korea japan</p>
<p>china they will fucking take over the world</p>
<p>easily in a</p>
<p>month and we may as well just bend over</p>
<p>take the fuckin rice up the ass and go okay</p>
<p>we are your</p>
<p>slaves cause</p>
<p>seriously the</p>
<p>olympic games was phenomenal</p>
<p>it was incredible what is it</p>
<p>about them that makes them so dangerous why is it</p>
<p>their willingness to work hard</p>
<p>yes sacrifice</p>
<p>their life for</p>
<p>their for their job it is</p>
<p>their pride</p>
<p>self pride and national pride do</p>
<p>willingness to work extremely hard for very little</p>
<p>money and just for</p>
<p>self satisfaction and</p>
<p>add to that the sheer</p>
<p>number the numbers they have the manpower is</p>
<p>extraordinary</p>
<p>dude you go to one of</p>
<p>those yeah that is</p>
<p>kinda just on our</p>
<p>level that we can relate to you go to one of</p>
<p>those k1 shows in japan</p>
<p>and the amount of people they employ to set up the</p>
<p>arena and set up the ring and</p>
<p>the cameras</p>
<p>it is insane</p>
<p>people that i see set up jobs for fox</p>
<p>sports back home</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll take two guys to set up a</p>
<p>particular camera</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll use 10 guys to set up</p>
<p>a camera and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll get it done in like a</p>
<p>quarter of the time</p>
<p>and the ring is</p>
<p>taken apart not by</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a</p>
<p>group of 15 people like a show in australia</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll get 300 guys and as soon as the show ends</p>
<p>they come in in helmets</p>
<p>and little cars</p>
<p>and that ring is</p>
<p>taken down in 10 minutes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like vultures</p>
<p>going in and</p>
<p>stripping the flesh off</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because they they have so many people there</p>
<p>that they work harder like what is it so many people</p>
<p>they work hard</p>
<p>but they work diligently and they work together</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like a colony of</p>
<p>ants all the</p>
<p>ants are pulling together for the colony</p>
<p>no one ant is just on his own working on his own agenda</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re all pulling together</p>
<p>and therefore we form</p>
<p>one giant colony of just</p>
<p>take over wherever we want it&rsquo;s fucking amazing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s scary it&rsquo;s amazing well what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to do with getting people to work incredible</p>
<p>hours and live in dorms and shit i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spooky as fuck</p>
<p>the japanese</p>
<p>if you ever been inside a</p>
<p>tokyo apartment</p>
<p>this room here</p>
<p>would be considered a fuckin mansion</p>

<p>a room in tokyo a</p>
<p>tokyo apartment the bed</p>
<p>was in where the</p>
<p>kitchen was</p>

<p>studios you know you can get a</p>
<p>studio that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically that&rsquo;s it it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>spot to live from the end of the bed to the front door</p>
<p>was from here to</p>
<p>where that knee is on you wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how much room you had to move</p>
<p>and the stove is there</p>

<p>hotel room down</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>swing a cat in there</p>

<p>in australia everybody</p>
<p>still lives like you do here in a</p>
<p>house with a backyard in suburbs</p>
<p>and the whole high rise</p>
<p>apartment thing</p>
<p>slowly building in</p>
<p>popularity but</p>

<p>the extent of</p>
<p>these papers</p>

<p>you look no yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you that west side highway</p>
<p>drive is gonna</p>

<p>stacked you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have pets you know you can go and ring to pet in tokyo</p>
<p>just to pat one just so you can you can go rent a</p>
<p>cat or a dog for an hour so you can take it to the park</p>
<p>throw a fuckin</p>
<p>little fuckin park</p>
<p>throw a little frisbee</p>
<p>feed it take</p>
<p>it for a walk and then you return it to the shop</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous yeah</p>
<p>what if don&rsquo;t you get attached</p>
<p>to the dog don&rsquo;t you develop a relationship to the dog</p>
<p>then you can</p>
<p>maybe rent it for two</p>
<p>hours but yeah</p>
<p>you just rent a pet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a strange world man</p>
<p>they almost are like an alien race</p>
<p>it really is</p>
<p>i mean that</p>
<p>their writing is so different so</p>
<p>completely unrelated</p>
<p>you know if you look at like the writing of</p>
<p>all the european</p>
<p>countries except for you</p>
<p>know except for</p>
<p>hungary or russia</p>
<p>yeah the hungary</p>
<p>a couple of</p>
<p>they all share</p>
<p>the arabic alphabet</p>
<p>that we use yeah they all</p>
<p>share it and when you</p>
<p>go to china and</p>
<p>korea and japan it&rsquo;s like whoa</p>
<p>you guys are</p>
<p>aliens this is</p>
<p>alien stuff</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t even related to</p>
<p>like this grew</p>
<p>completely independent</p>
<p>of the european</p>
<p>style writing it&rsquo;s so different</p>
<p>what a better</p>
<p>world the place</p>
<p>would be if everyone</p>
<p>spoke one fucking language would it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know man i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s cool to</p>
<p>watch all the different branches</p>
<p>no man i think it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>people could actually reason with each</p>
<p>other in one single language dude people</p>
<p>would go to war over eye</p>
<p>color people are</p>
<p>retards all you have to get this</p>
<p>fucking blue eyed cocksuckers to try to take our land</p>
<p>dude people are dumb they find</p>
<p>they want to be on teams no matter what they</p>
<p>always want to find</p>
<p>i try to invent</p>
<p>one universal language ones wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>something called esperenza</p>
<p>or something like that</p>
<p>maybe someone can clarify and</p>
<p>tweet it to us</p>
<p>hmm it was like years ago they</p>
<p>tried to invent</p>
<p>a language called esperanda or esperanza</p>
<p>and it was meant to be one global language</p>
<p>and it never</p>
<p>took off obviously i don&rsquo;t remember that yeah yeah that</p>
<p>would take a long ass time you have to get it to the</p>
<p>tribes in the african forest it would take</p>
<p>generations because you&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>school generations</p>
<p>three or four</p>
<p>generations</p>
<p>to get it down patted</p>
<p>inconculted</p>
<p>among the masses yeah</p>
<p>most countries in the</p>
<p>world you know</p>
<p>a good percentage of the people are</p>
<p>bilingual in america people are</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>english or spanish that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s like english</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s of course</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s immigrants in here that</p>
<p>speak all kinds of languages but as far as like</p>
<p>people learning things</p>
<p>very few people</p>
<p>how do you know</p>
<p>how bad the immigration problem here was to</p>
<p>i was driving</p>
<p>to do a king of the cage show in new mexico</p>
<p>and the driver was telling me</p>
<p>about it cause we&rsquo;re driving along the</p>
<p>the border there from el paso to like mescalero</p>
