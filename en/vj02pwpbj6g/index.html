i&amp;rsquo;m sorry your cravings now this is a very important topic because if you have cravings you&amp;rsquo;re going to have a hard time sticking with keto you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be consistent so you have this little tiny gland in the brain called the hypothalamus and within that hypothalamus you have a tiny little group of cells that control appetite and feeling satisfied with foods and so there&amp;rsquo;s information coming from your eyes from your smell from your taste from your stomach all these perceptions and they&amp;rsquo;re coming in through the body up to that little center and giving it certain information and based on what&amp;rsquo;s happening it&amp;rsquo;ll send down signals to the body to tell when you had enough food or when you should start eating and so let&amp;rsquo;s say there&amp;rsquo;s some reason why you need food it will start creating the sensation of hunger which is kind of like a an emptiness an uncomfortableness feeling very unsatisfied so we have various hormones that are affecting this we have leptin which tells the brain to stop eating it&amp;rsquo;s like a turn off switch now your fat cells make this hormone the stomach makes it your muscles make it and so it decreases hunger then you have another hormone called ghrelin which does the opposite it increases hunger it tells the body it&amp;rsquo;s time to eat and then so they work together and when you eat you stimulate insulin and insulin triggers leptin eventually causing you to feel satisfied but here&amp;rsquo;s the thing there are other sensors in your hypothalamic computer that regulate glucose amino acids fatty acids salts vitamins and even minerals so based on how many nutrients you&amp;rsquo;re consuming coming in the body that information will go into the brain and then tell the body um to crave certain things to try to get these nutrients but this is where it breaks down because sometimes when you crave certain nutrients your body&amp;rsquo;s not going to crave like kale it might crave other things that don&amp;rsquo;t have that nutrient in it unfortunately now you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of people who who have craved like dirt for example to get iron or ice but mainly people are craving things like bread pasta cereal crackers candy sweets things like that and maybe sometimes you&amp;rsquo;d be craving chocolate which has magnesium and one of the reasons why you might crave these grain flour products is because you&amp;rsquo;re low in b vitamins but here&amp;rsquo;s the problem when you consume these grains you usually consume them in the form of a refined carbohydrate which basically has its empty nutrition there&amp;rsquo;s empty calories so when you eat that food you not only trigger insulin and crad issues like insulin resistance but there&amp;rsquo;s no turn off in the hypothalamus we don&amp;rsquo;t have the ability to turn that thing off so you&amp;rsquo;re never going to be satisfied and you may already know this because it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to consume just a little bit of sweet or refined carbs and as a way for your brain to cause you to consume certain foods it&amp;rsquo;s going to give you sometimes a pleasure sensation okay and that works through dopamine and serotonin can increase the happiness sensation and these foods tend to raise your mood make you feel better decrease stress and pressure for a minute until the blood sugars start going down and this whole cycle starts over and over again so junk food including like things with msg give you this artificial sensation and people literally live for sensation unfortunately the sensation they get is an artificial sensation it&amp;rsquo;s not long-lasting it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from things that give you real good healthy sensations now it&amp;rsquo;s really a trap because refined carbohydrates raise the insulin and cause insulin resistance and when you get insulin resistance now you can&amp;rsquo;t absorb your nutrients anymore what is that going to do it&amp;rsquo;s going to make you want that food but not really become satisfied so that actually keeps the cravings there and keeps you hungry and then we have foods that are void of nutrition so we never have a chance to satisfy that hypothalamus and then stop that hunger feedback loop if you have low bile if your gallbladder is missing or you have a sluggish gallbladder or you have a fatty liver and you can&amp;rsquo;t produce enough bile you&amp;rsquo;re going to have a difficulty absorbing the fat soluble nutrients from the foods that you eat and the fat soluble nutrients usually are very satisfying to your brain and especially the hypothalamus and this is why some people when they start taking purified bile salts they start feeling more satisfied after they&amp;rsquo;re eating it&amp;rsquo;s also why people when they start keto and intermittent fasting get rid of their insulin resistance and they become very very satisfied in fact their hunger goes away their cravings go away and they&amp;rsquo;re very very satisfied because they&amp;rsquo;re absorbing more nutrients if you&amp;rsquo;re consuming too many carbs your body won&amp;rsquo;t let you tap into your own fat that means you&amp;rsquo;re running on your your sugars your stored sugar constantly so it&amp;rsquo;s going to go up and down up and down up and down another reason why you&amp;rsquo;re going to be very unsatisfied and you just won&amp;rsquo;t have the ability to go for any period of time without needing some carbs and this relates to the next one which is low blood sugar so anytime you have low blood sugars you&amp;rsquo;re going to want sugar okay so one very important tip relating to cravings is not only do you need to cut down your carbs but you need to raise the nutrients you need to eat nutrient-dense foods especially the foods that are high in the fat soluble vitamins okay cod liver oil is a really good thing fatty salmon fatty fish and leafy greens and vegetables high in potassium magnesium folate in vitamin c another important thing would be your environment if you&amp;rsquo;re in an environment that you&amp;rsquo;re visually seeing food all the time or you&amp;rsquo;re smelling food or it&amp;rsquo;s just around and you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about all the time those can all trigger the pleasure neurotransmitter called dopamine and it&amp;rsquo;s triggered by the anticipation of eating something not when you eat it so when you&amp;rsquo;re looking at a donut for example you&amp;rsquo;re anticipating eating it you&amp;rsquo;re not getting any of those particles in your eyes that are going into your stomach or when you&amp;rsquo;re smelling some pizza cooking oven you&amp;rsquo;re getting some particles in your body but it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to satisfy you but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely going to increase dopamine so it&amp;rsquo;s very important that you avoid these temptations by changing your environment and not having pictures of food not seeing food not smelling certain junk foods or temptations going to just be too high and once you start consuming fast food it is so difficult to stop because of the msg which is going to trigger hunger it&amp;rsquo;s going to definitely not make you satisfied and it&amp;rsquo;s going to increase insulin it can increase the insulin by 300 percent they use msg to fatten mice in their obesity studies by the way so it&amp;rsquo;s very important to address all the issues that we talked about the difference between a craving an addiction is a craving is a strong desire but an addiction is not only a strong desire but the inability to stop or resist or control that temptation all right thanks for watching i have quite a few videos on this topic i put them down below check them out hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today'>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>﻿today we&rsquo;re going to talk about how to get a grip 
on your addictions i&rsquo;m sorry your cravings now  </p>
<p>this is a very important topic because if you 
have cravings you&rsquo;re going to have a hard time  </p>
<p>sticking with keto you&rsquo;re not going to be 
consistent so you have this little tiny gland in  </p>
<p>the brain called the hypothalamus and within that 
hypothalamus you have a tiny little group of cells  </p>
<p>that control appetite and feeling satisfied 
with foods and so there&rsquo;s information coming  </p>
<p>from your eyes from your smell from your taste 
from your stomach all these perceptions and  </p>
<p>they&rsquo;re coming in through the body up to that 
little center and giving it certain information  </p>
<p>and based on what&rsquo;s happening it&rsquo;ll send down 
signals to the body to tell when you had enough  </p>
<p>food or when you should start eating and so let&rsquo;s 
say there&rsquo;s some reason why you need food it will  </p>
<p>start creating the sensation of hunger which is 
kind of like a an emptiness an uncomfortableness  </p>
<p>feeling very unsatisfied so we have various 
hormones that are affecting this we have leptin  </p>
<p>which tells the brain to stop eating it&rsquo;s like 
a turn off switch now your fat cells make this  </p>
<p>hormone the stomach makes it your muscles make it 
and so it decreases hunger then you have another  </p>
<p>hormone called ghrelin which does the opposite 
it increases hunger it tells the body it&rsquo;s time  </p>
<p>to eat and then so they work together and when 
you eat you stimulate insulin and insulin triggers  </p>
<p>leptin eventually causing you to feel satisfied 
but here&rsquo;s the thing there are other sensors  </p>
<p>in your hypothalamic computer that 
regulate glucose amino acids fatty acids  </p>
<p>salts vitamins and even minerals so based on how 
many nutrients you&rsquo;re consuming coming in the body  </p>
<p>that information will go into the brain and 
then tell the body um to crave certain things  </p>
<p>to try to get these nutrients but this is where 
it breaks down because sometimes when you crave  </p>
<p>certain nutrients your body&rsquo;s not going to crave 
like kale it might crave other things that don&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>have that nutrient in it unfortunately now 
you&rsquo;ve probably heard of people who who have  </p>
<p>craved like dirt for example to get iron or 
ice but mainly people are craving things like  </p>
<p>bread pasta cereal crackers candy sweets things 
like that and maybe sometimes you&rsquo;d be craving  </p>
<p>chocolate which has magnesium and one of the 
reasons why you might crave these grain flour  </p>
<p>products is because you&rsquo;re low in b vitamins but 
here&rsquo;s the problem when you consume these grains  </p>
<p>you usually consume them in the form of a 
refined carbohydrate which basically has  </p>
<p>its empty nutrition there&rsquo;s empty calories so when 
you eat that food you not only trigger insulin and  </p>
<p>crad issues like insulin resistance but there&rsquo;s 
no turn off in the hypothalamus we don&rsquo;t have the  </p>
<p>ability to turn that thing off so you&rsquo;re never 
going to be satisfied and you may already know  </p>
<p>this because it&rsquo;s very difficult to consume just 
a little bit of sweet or refined carbs and as a  </p>
<p>way for your brain to cause you to consume certain 
foods it&rsquo;s going to give you sometimes a pleasure  </p>
<p>sensation okay and that works through dopamine and 
serotonin can increase the happiness sensation and  </p>
<p>these foods tend to raise your mood make you feel 
better decrease stress and pressure for a minute  </p>
<p>until the blood sugars start going 
down and this whole cycle starts  </p>
<p>over and over again so junk food including like 
things with msg give you this artificial sensation  </p>
<p>and people literally live for sensation 
unfortunately the sensation they get is an  </p>
<p>artificial sensation it&rsquo;s not long-lasting 
it doesn&rsquo;t come from things that give you  </p>
<p>real good healthy sensations now it&rsquo;s really 
a trap because refined carbohydrates raise the  </p>
<p>insulin and cause insulin resistance and when 
you get insulin resistance now you can&rsquo;t absorb  </p>
<p>your nutrients anymore what is that going to do 
it&rsquo;s going to make you want that food but not  </p>
<p>really become satisfied so that actually keeps 
the cravings there and keeps you hungry and then  </p>
<p>we have foods that are void of nutrition so we 
never have a chance to satisfy that hypothalamus  </p>
<p>and then stop that hunger feedback loop if you 
have low bile if your gallbladder is missing or  </p>
<p>you have a sluggish gallbladder or you have a 
fatty liver and you can&rsquo;t produce enough bile  </p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a difficulty absorbing the 
fat soluble nutrients from the foods that you eat  </p>
<p>and the fat soluble nutrients usually are 
very satisfying to your brain and especially  </p>
<p>the hypothalamus and this is why some people 
when they start taking purified bile salts  </p>
<p>they start feeling more satisfied after they&rsquo;re 
eating it&rsquo;s also why people when they start keto  </p>
<p>and intermittent fasting get rid of their insulin 
resistance and they become very very satisfied in  </p>
<p>fact their hunger goes away their cravings go 
away and they&rsquo;re very very satisfied because  </p>
<p>they&rsquo;re absorbing more nutrients if you&rsquo;re 
consuming too many carbs your body won&rsquo;t let you  </p>
<p>tap into your own fat that means you&rsquo;re running 
on your your sugars your stored sugar constantly  </p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s going to go up and down up and down up and 
down another reason why you&rsquo;re going to be very  </p>
<p>unsatisfied and you just won&rsquo;t have the ability 
to go for any period of time without needing some  </p>
<p>carbs and this relates to the next one which is 
low blood sugar so anytime you have low blood  </p>
<p>sugars you&rsquo;re going to want sugar okay so one very 
important tip relating to cravings is not only do  </p>
<p>you need to cut down your carbs but you need to 
raise the nutrients you need to eat nutrient-dense  </p>
<p>foods especially the foods that are high in the 
fat soluble vitamins okay cod liver oil is a  </p>
<p>really good thing fatty salmon fatty fish and 
leafy greens and vegetables high in potassium  </p>
<p>magnesium folate in vitamin c another important 
thing would be your environment if you&rsquo;re in  </p>
<p>an environment that you&rsquo;re visually seeing 
food all the time or you&rsquo;re smelling food  </p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just around and you&rsquo;re thinking 
about all the time those can all trigger the  </p>
<p>pleasure neurotransmitter called dopamine and it&rsquo;s 
triggered by the anticipation of eating something  </p>
<p>not when you eat it so when you&rsquo;re looking at a 
donut for example you&rsquo;re anticipating eating it  </p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting any of those particles in 
your eyes that are going into your stomach  </p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re smelling some pizza cooking oven 
you&rsquo;re getting some particles in your body but  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not enough to satisfy you but it&rsquo;s definitely 
going to increase dopamine so it&rsquo;s very important  </p>
<p>that you avoid these temptations by changing 
your environment and not having pictures of food  </p>
<p>not seeing food not smelling certain junk 
foods or temptations going to just be too  </p>
<p>high and once you start consuming fast food 
it is so difficult to stop because of the msg  </p>
<p>which is going to trigger hunger it&rsquo;s going to 
definitely not make you satisfied and it&rsquo;s going  </p>
<p>to increase insulin it can increase the insulin by 
300 percent they use msg to fatten mice in their  </p>
<p>obesity studies by the way so it&rsquo;s very important 
to address all the issues that we talked about  </p>
<p>the difference between a craving an addiction is a 
craving is a strong desire but an addiction is not  </p>
<p>only a strong desire but the inability to stop 
or resist or control that temptation all right  </p>
<p>thanks for watching i have quite a few videos on 
this topic i put them down below check them out  </p>
<p>hey before you go real quick i have 
a course entitled how to bulletproof  </p>
<p>your immune system it&rsquo;s a free course 
i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why  </p>
<p>here&rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone 
is focused on this over here avoiding  </p>
<p>your environment but what about here what about
