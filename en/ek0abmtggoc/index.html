﻿you know recently um i was sitting down on a table and i was looking over and i noticed someone um someone&amp;rsquo;s right ankle was completely swollen okay the foot was swollen the lower leg was swollen but the left foot wasn&amp;rsquo;t swollen and i was very very tempted to go up to her and start asking questions because typically what happens when your right ankle or foot is swollen you have edema that&amp;rsquo;s usually a liver problem cirrhosis of the liver and i looked down and to see if there was a protruded belly like called ascites and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t that it was it was definitely a belly but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t protruded now that&amp;rsquo;s not the only way to diagnose the liver but it was just one indication if there&amp;rsquo;s advanced liver problems but sometimes i get into trouble because i tend to want to evaluate the person and figure things out when they might not want to be evaluated but based on where someone is holding fluid edema wise you can tell a lot about what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the body so if the right ankle and foot is more swollen think liver if the left foot and ankle is swollen think more heart if both of the ankles and feet are swollen think more of a blood sugar situation like diabetes now there&amp;rsquo;s many other reasons why you might have edema it could be you have something called chronic venous insufficiency or you have lymphedema or you have a kidney problem or even you have an advanced lung problem but the most common reasons for edema in your ankles is going to be usually in the area of blood sugar issues like diabetes or pre-diabetes or you&amp;rsquo;re just low in potassium and you&amp;rsquo;re very high in sodium i remember in practice i would just simply have people either juice some greens or take some potassium and all this fluid would just come right out the next day so potassium is very very important and it just tells you that they&amp;rsquo;re just not consuming enough greens they&amp;rsquo;re just doing heavy salt and i don&amp;rsquo;t actually recommend cutting down your salt i just recommend increasing your potassium by consuming more greens like a really large salad every single day would be great now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about diabetes but what happens when you&amp;rsquo;re diabetic is you get destruction of your vascular system especially in the capillaries so all the blood that comes through your arteries it comes down to the capillaries it has to then go through this little exchange process then you have the lymphatic system which handles the excess fluid and comes back around and if your circulation is damaged from high levels of sugar you&amp;rsquo;re not going to get this exchange it&amp;rsquo;s going to back up into fluids and you&amp;rsquo;re going to just hold a lot of fluids in your feet and your ankles and this is actually a pretty big problem because think about what&amp;rsquo;s happening to your heart it&amp;rsquo;s having to work really really hard and so when someone has edema in the ankles it gives you a good prediction of what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen down the road and so unfortunately when people go to the doctor for edema they give them a diuretic they&amp;rsquo;re treating this symptom the symptom is not the problem it just tells you there&amp;rsquo;s a problem there and just by getting rid of fluid you never you never change the diet you never get the potassium in there you don&amp;rsquo;t correct the blood sugars and unfortunately when you suppress the symptom you&amp;rsquo;re hiding the symptom and you&amp;rsquo;re lowering the awareness that the problem is still there because you&amp;rsquo;re taking these diuretics every day and you&amp;rsquo;re just getting rid of the fluid and you&amp;rsquo;re thinking oh yeah i&amp;rsquo;m fine so if you&amp;rsquo;re watching this right now and you have swelling in the ankles or the feet definitely start asking questions start to investigate an underlying cause if you&amp;rsquo;re on medications definitely also find out the root of this problem and start to correct it so you don&amp;rsquo;t end up down the road with a bigger problem hey before you go if you&amp;rsquo;re benefiting from any of my content i would love to hear about your success story please share it in the link down below"><meta property="og:url"

and i was looking over and i noticed someone um  </p><p>someone&rsquo;s right ankle was completely swollen okay 
the foot was swollen the lower leg was swollen but  </p><p>the left foot wasn&rsquo;t swollen and i was very very 
tempted to go up to her and start asking questions  </p><p>because typically what happens when your 
right ankle or foot is swollen you have edema  </p><p>that&rsquo;s usually a liver problem cirrhosis of the 
liver and i looked down and to see if there was  </p><p>a protruded belly like called ascites and there 
wasn&rsquo;t that it was it was definitely a belly but  </p><p>it wasn&rsquo;t protruded now that&rsquo;s not the only way to 
diagnose the liver but it was just one indication  </p><p>if there&rsquo;s advanced liver problems but sometimes 
i get into trouble because i tend to want to  </p><p>evaluate the person and figure things out when 
they might not want to be evaluated but based  </p><p>on where someone is holding fluid edema wise you 
can tell a lot about what&rsquo;s going on in the body  </p><p>so if the right ankle and foot is more swollen 
think liver if the left foot and ankle is swollen  </p><p>think more heart if both of the ankles and feet 
are swollen think more of a blood sugar situation  </p><p>like diabetes now there&rsquo;s many other reasons 
why you might have edema it could be you have  </p><p>something called chronic venous insufficiency or 
you have lymphedema or you have a kidney problem  </p><p>or even you have an advanced lung problem but 
the most common reasons for edema in your ankles  </p><p>is going to be usually in the area of blood 
sugar issues like diabetes or pre-diabetes  </p><p>or you&rsquo;re just low in potassium and you&rsquo;re 
very high in sodium i remember in practice  </p><p>i would just simply have people either juice 
some greens or take some potassium and all  </p><p>this fluid would just come right out the next day 
so potassium is very very important and it just  </p><p>tells you that they&rsquo;re just not consuming enough 
greens they&rsquo;re just doing heavy salt and i don&rsquo;t  </p><p>actually recommend cutting down your salt i just 
recommend increasing your potassium by consuming  </p><p>more greens like a really large salad every single 
day would be great now let&rsquo;s talk about diabetes  </p><p>but what happens when you&rsquo;re diabetic is you get 
destruction of your vascular system especially in  </p><p>the capillaries so all the blood that comes 
through your arteries it comes down to the  </p><p>capillaries it has to then go through this little 
exchange process then you have the lymphatic  </p><p>system which handles the excess fluid and comes 
back around and if your circulation is damaged  </p><p>from high levels of sugar you&rsquo;re not going to get 
this exchange it&rsquo;s going to back up into fluids  </p><p>and you&rsquo;re going to just hold a lot of fluids in 
your feet and your ankles and this is actually  </p><p>a pretty big problem because think about what&rsquo;s 
happening to your heart it&rsquo;s having to work  </p><p>really really hard and so when someone has edema 
in the ankles it gives you a good prediction  </p><p>of what&rsquo;s going to happen down the road and so 
unfortunately when people go to the doctor for  </p><p>edema they give them a diuretic they&rsquo;re treating 
this symptom the symptom is not the problem  </p><p>it just tells you there&rsquo;s a problem 
there and just by getting rid of fluid  </p><p>you never you never change the diet you never get 
the potassium in there you don&rsquo;t correct the blood  </p><p>sugars and unfortunately when you suppress 
the symptom you&rsquo;re hiding the symptom and  </p><p>you&rsquo;re lowering the awareness that the problem is 
still there because you&rsquo;re taking these diuretics  </p><p>every day and you&rsquo;re just getting rid of the 
fluid and you&rsquo;re thinking oh yeah i&rsquo;m fine so  </p><p>if you&rsquo;re watching this right now and you 
have swelling in the ankles or the feet  </p><p>definitely start asking questions start to 
investigate an underlying cause if you&rsquo;re on  </p><p>medications definitely also find out the root of 
this problem and start to correct it so you don&rsquo;t  </p><p>end up down the road with a bigger problem hey 
before you go if you&rsquo;re benefiting from any of my  </p><p>content i would love to hear about your success
