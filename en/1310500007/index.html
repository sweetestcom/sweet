    <p>The following is a conversation with Jeff Atwood.</p>
<p>He is the cofounder of Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange,</p>
<p>websites that are visited by millions of people</p>
<p>every single day.</p>
<p>Much like with Wikipedia, it is difficult to understate</p>
<p>the impact on global knowledge and productivity</p>
<p>that these networks of sites have created.</p>
<p>Jeff is also the author of the famed blog Coding Horror</p>
<p>and the founder of Discourse, an open source software</p>
<p>project that seeks to improve the quality of our online</p>
<p>community discussions.</p>
<p>This conversation is part of the MIT course</p>
<p>on artificial general intelligence</p>
<p>and the artificial intelligence podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,</p>
<p>or your podcast provider of choice,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman,</p>
<p>spelled F R I D.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Jeff Atwood.</p>
<p>Having co created and managed for a few years</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s largest community of programmers in Stack Overflow</p>
<p>10 years ago, what do you think motivates most programmers?</p>
<p>Is it fame, fortune, glory, process of programming itself,</p>
<p>or is it the sense of belonging to a community?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s puzzles, really.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s this idea of working on puzzles</p>
<p>independently of other people and just solving a problem,</p>
<p>sort of like on your own almost.</p>
<p>Although, nobody really works alone in programming anymore.</p>
<p>But I will say there&rsquo;s an aspect of hiding yourself away</p>
<p>and just beating on a problem until you solve it,</p>
<p>like brute force basically to me is</p>
<p>what a lot of programming is.</p>
<p>The computer&rsquo;s so fast that you can</p>
<p>do things that would take forever for a human,</p>
<p>but you can just do them so many times and so often</p>
<p>that you get the answer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying just the pure act of tinkering with the code</p>
<p>is the thing that drives most problems.</p>
<p>The struggle balance within the joy of overcoming,</p>
<p>the brute force process of pain and suffering</p>
<p>that eventually leads to something that actually works.</p>
<p>Well, data&rsquo;s fun, too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this thing called the shuffling problem.</p>
<p>The naive shuffle that most programmers write</p>
<p>has a huge flaw, and there&rsquo;s a lot of articles</p>
<p>online about this because it can be really bad</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a casino and you have an unsophisticated programmer</p>
<p>writing your shuffle algorithm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s surprising ways to get this wrong,</p>
<p>but the neat thing is the way to figure that out</p>
<p>is just to run your shuffle a bunch of times</p>
<p>and see how many orientations of cards you get.</p>
<p>You should get an equal distribution of all the cards.</p>
<p>And with the naive method of shuffling,</p>
<p>if you just look at the data, if you just brute force it</p>
<p>and say, OK, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen,</p>
<p>you just write a program that does it a billion times</p>
<p>and then see what the buckets look like of the data.</p>
<p>And the Monty Hall problem is another example of that,</p>
<p>where you have three doors and somebody gives you</p>
<p>information about another door.</p>
<p>So the correct answer is you should always</p>
<p>switch in the Monty Hall problem, which is not intuitive,</p>
<p>and it freaks people out all the time.</p>
<p>But you can solve it with data.</p>
<p>If you write a program that does the Monty Hall game</p>
<p>and then never switches, then always switches, just compare,</p>
<p>you would immediately see that you don&rsquo;t have to be smart.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to figure out the answer algorithmically.</p>
<p>You can just brute force it out with data and say, well,</p>
<p>I know the answer is this because I ran the program</p>
<p>a billion times, and these are the data buckets</p>
<p>that I got from it.</p>
<p>So empirically find it.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the joy of that?</p>
<p>So for you, for you personally, outside of family,</p>
<p>what motivates you in this process?</p>
<p>Well, to be honest, I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>write a lot of code anymore.</p>
<p>What I do at Discourse is managery stuff,</p>
<p>which I always despised.</p>
<p>As a programmer, you think of managers</p>
<p>as people who don&rsquo;t really do anything themselves.</p>
<p>But the weird thing about code is you</p>
<p>realize that language is code.</p>
<p>The ability to direct other people</p>
<p>lets you get more stuff done than you</p>
<p>could by yourself anyway.</p>
<p>You said language is code?</p>
<p>Language is code.</p>
<p>Meaning communication with other humans?</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>You can think of it as a systematic.</p>
<p>So what is it like to be, what makes,</p>
<p>before we get into programming, what makes a good manager?</p>
<p>What makes a good leader?</p>
<p>Well, I think a leader, it&rsquo;s all about leading by example,</p>
<p>first of all, sort of doing and being the things</p>
<p>that you want to be.</p>
<p>Now, this can be kind of exhausting,</p>
<p>particularly when you have kids, because you</p>
<p>realize that your kids are watching you all the time,</p>
<p>even in ways that you&rsquo;ve stopped seeing yourself.</p>
<p>The hardest person to see on the planet is really yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot easier to see other people</p>
<p>and make judgments about them.</p>
<p>But yourself, you&rsquo;re super biased.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually see yourself the way other people see you.</p>
<p>Often, you&rsquo;re very, very hard on yourself in a way</p>
<p>that other people really aren&rsquo;t going to be.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the insights is you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got to be really diligent about thinking,</p>
<p>am I behaving in a way that represents</p>
<p>how I want other people to behave,</p>
<p>like leading through example?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of examples of leaders</p>
<p>that really mess this up, like they make decisions that</p>
<p>are like, wow, it&rsquo;s a bad example for other people.</p>
<p>So I think leading by example is one.</p>
<p>The other one I believe is working really hard.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean working exhaustively,</p>
<p>but showing a real passion for the problem,</p>
<p>not necessarily your solution to the problem,</p>
<p>but the problem itself is just one that you really believe in.</p>
<p>Like with discourse, for example,</p>
<p>the problem that we&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>which is my current project, is how do you get people</p>
<p>in groups to communicate in a way that doesn&rsquo;t break down</p>
<p>into the howling of wolves?</p>
<p>How do you deal with trolling?</p>
<p>Not like technical problems.</p>
<p>How do I get people to post paragraphs?</p>
<p>How do I get people to use bold?</p>
<p>How do I get people to use complete sentences,</p>
<p>although those are problems as well?</p>
<p>But how do I get people to get along with each other</p>
<p>and then solve whatever problem it is they set out to solve,</p>
<p>or reach some consensus on discussion,</p>
<p>or just not hurt each other even?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a discussion that doesn&rsquo;t really matter,</p>
<p>but are people yelling at each other?</p>
<p>And why?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s not the purpose of this kind of communication.</p>
<p>So I would say leadership is about setting an example,</p>
<p>doing the things that represent what you want to be,</p>
<p>and making sure that you&rsquo;re actually doing those things.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a trick to that too,</p>
<p>because the things you don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>also say a lot about what you are.</p>
<p>Yeah, so let&rsquo;s pause on that one.</p>
<p>So those two things are fascinating.</p>
<p>So how do you have as a leader that self awareness?</p>
<p>So you just said it&rsquo;s really hard to be self aware.</p>
<p>So for you personally, or maybe for other leaders</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen or look up to,</p>
<p>how do you know both that the things you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>are the wrong things to be doing,</p>
<p>the way you speak to others, the way you behave,</p>
<p>and the things you&rsquo;re not doing?</p>
<p>How do you get that signal?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s two aspects to that.</p>
<p>One is like processing feedback that you&rsquo;re getting, so.</p>
<p>How do you get feedback?</p>
<p>Well, right, so are you getting feedback, right?</p>
<p>So one way we do it, for example, with discourse,</p>
<p>we have three cofounders,</p>
<p>and we periodically talk about decisions</p>
<p>before we make them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like one person can make a mistake,</p>
<p>or like, wow, there can be misunderstandings, things like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s part of like group consensus of leadership</p>
<p>is like it&rsquo;s good to have,</p>
<p>I think systems where there&rsquo;s one leader,</p>
<p>and that leader has the rule of absolute law</p>
<p>are just really dangerous in my experience.</p>
<p>For communities, for example,</p>
<p>like if you have a community that&rsquo;s run by one person,</p>
<p>that one person makes all the decisions,</p>
<p>that person&rsquo;s gonna have a bad day.</p>
<p>Something could happen to that person, something,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of variables.</p>
<p>So like first, when you think about leadership,</p>
<p>have multiple people doing leadership</p>
<p>and have them talk amongst each other.</p>
<p>So giving each other feedback about the decisions</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re making.</p>
<p>And then when you do get feedback,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s that little voice in your head, right?</p>
<p>Or your gut or wherever you wanna put it in your body.</p>
<p>I think that voice is really important.</p>
<p>Like I think most people who have any kind of moral compass</p>
<p>or like want to do,</p>
<p>most people want to do the right thing.</p>
<p>I do believe that.</p>
<p>I mean, there might be a handful of sociopaths</p>
<p>out there that don&rsquo;t, but most people,</p>
<p>they want other people to think of them as a good person.</p>
<p>And why wouldn&rsquo;t you, right?</p>
<p>Like, do you want people to despise you?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just weird, right?</p>
<p>So you have that little voice</p>
<p>that sort of the angel and devil on your shoulder</p>
<p>sort of talking to you about like what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re doing, how does it make you feel</p>
<p>to make these decisions, right?</p>
<p>And I think having some attunement to that voice</p>
<p>is important.</p>
<p>But you said that voice also for,</p>
<p>I think this is a programmer situation too,</p>
<p>where sometimes the devil on the shoulder</p>
<p>is a little too loud.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a little too self critical</p>
<p>for a lot of developers,</p>
<p>and especially when you have introverted personality.</p>
<p>How do you struggle with a self criticism</p>
<p>or the criticism of others?</p>
<p>So one of the things of leadership</p>
<p>is to do something that&rsquo;s potentially unpopular</p>
<p>or where people doubt you</p>
<p>and you still go through with the decision.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that balance like?</p>
<p>I think you have to walk people</p>
<p>through your decision making, right?</p>
<p>Like you have to, this is where blogging</p>
<p>is really important and communication is so important.</p>
<p>Again, code language is just another kind of code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, here is the program</p>
<p>by which I arrived at the conclusion</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna reach, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to say like,</p>
<p>this is a decision, it&rsquo;s final, deal with it, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not usually satisfying to people.</p>
<p>But if you say, look,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been thinking about this problem for a while.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some stuff that&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we think is right.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s our goals.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we wanna achieve.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve looked at these options</p>
<p>and we think this available options is the best option.</p>
<p>People will be like, oh, okay, right?</p>
<p>Maybe I don&rsquo;t totally agree with you,</p>
<p>but I can kind of see where you&rsquo;re coming from</p>
<p>and I see it&rsquo;s not just arbitrary decision</p>
<p>delivered from a cloud of flames in the sky, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a human trying to reach</p>
<p>some kind of consensus about goals.</p>
<p>And their goals might be different than yours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s completely legit, right?</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re making that clear, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, well, the reason we don&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>is because we have totally different goals, right?</p>
<p>Like, how could we agree?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re a bad person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that we have radically different goals in mind</p>
<p>when we started looking at this problem.</p>
<p>And the other one you said is passion.</p>
<p>So, or hard work, sorry.</p>
<p>Well, those are tied together in my mind.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say hard work and passion.</p>
<p>Like for me, like I just really love</p>
<p>the problem discourse is setting out to solve</p>
<p>because in a way it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a vision of the world</p>
<p>where it all devolves into Facebook</p>
<p>basically owning everything and every aspect</p>
<p>of human communication, right?</p>
<p>And this has always been kind of a scary world for me.</p>
<p>First, cause I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I think Facebook is really good at execution.</p>
<p>I got to compliment them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very competent in terms of what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but Facebook has not much of a moral compass</p>
<p>in terms of Facebook cares about Facebook, really.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really care about you and your problems.</p>
<p>What they care about is how big they can make Facebook,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Is that you talking about the company</p>
<p>or just the mechanism of how Facebook works?</p>
<p>Kind of both really, right?</p>
<p>Like, and the idea with discourse,</p>
<p>the reason I&rsquo;m so passionate about it</p>
<p>is cause I believe every community</p>
<p>should have the right to own themselves, right?</p>
<p>Like they should have their own software that they can run</p>
<p>that belongs to them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their space where they can set the rules.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>they can move to different hosting or,</p>
<p>you know, whatever they need to happen can happen.</p>
<p>But like this idea of a company town</p>
<p>where all human communication is implicitly owned</p>
<p>by WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really disturbing too,</p>
<p>cause Facebook is really smart.</p>
<p>Like I said, they&rsquo;re great at execution.</p>
<p>Buying in WhatsApp and buying Instagram</p>
<p>were incredibly smart decisions.</p>
<p>And they also do this thing, I don&rsquo;t know if you know,</p>
<p>but they have this VPN software</p>
<p>that they give away for free on smartphones</p>
<p>and it indirectly feeds all the data</p>
<p>about the traffic back to Facebook.</p>
<p>So they can see what&rsquo;s actually getting popular</p>
<p>through the VPNs, right?</p>
<p>They have low level access to the network data</p>
<p>because users have let them have that.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a small pause here.</p>
<p>First of all, discourse.</p>
<p>Can you talk about, can you lay out the land</p>
<p>of all the different ways you can have communities?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s Stack Overflow that you&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s discourse.</p>
<p>So Stack Overflow is kind of like a Wiki,</p>
<p>Wikipedia you talk about.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very specific scalpel, very focused.</p>
<p>So what is the purpose of discourse</p>
<p>and maybe contrast that with Facebook?</p>
<p>First of all, say, what is discourse?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Well, let me start from the very beginning.</p>
<p>So Stack Overflow is a very structured</p>
<p>Wiki style Q and A for programmers, right?</p>
<p>And that was the problem we first worked on.</p>
<p>And when we started, we thought it was discussions</p>
<p>because we looked at like programming forums</p>
<p>and other things, but we quickly realized</p>
<p>we were doing Q and A, which is a very narrow subset</p>
<p>of human communication, right?</p>
<p>Sorry, so when you started Stack Overflow,</p>
<p>you thought you didn&rsquo;t even know the Q and A.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know it would be Q and A.</p>
<p>Well, we didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We had an idea of like, okay, these are things</p>
<p>that we see working online.</p>
<p>We had a goal, right?</p>
<p>Our goal was there was this site, Experts Exchange,</p>
<p>with a very unfortunate name.</p>
<p>Thank you for killing that site.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, right?</p>
<p>Like a lot of people don&rsquo;t remember it anymore,</p>
<p>which is great.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the measure of success</p>
<p>when people don&rsquo;t remember the thing</p>
<p>that you were trying to replace, then you&rsquo;ve totally won.</p>
<p>So it was a place to get answers to programming questions,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t clear if it was like focused Q and A,</p>
<p>if it was a discussion.</p>
<p>There were plenty of programming forums.</p>
<p>So we weren&rsquo;t really sure.</p>
<p>We were like, okay, we&rsquo;ll take aspects of dig and Reddit,</p>
<p>like voting were very important.</p>
<p>Reordering answers based on votes.</p>
<p>Wiki style stuff of like being able to edit posts,</p>
<p>not just your posts, but other people&rsquo;s posts</p>
<p>to make them better and keep them more up to date.</p>
<p>Ownership of blogging of like, okay, this is me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying this in my voice, this is the stuff that I know.</p>
<p>And your reputation accrues to you</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s peer recognition.</p>
<p>So you asked earlier, like what motivates programmers?</p>
<p>I think peer recognition motivates them a lot.</p>
<p>That was one of the key insights of Stack Overflow</p>
<p>was like recognition from your peers is why things get done.</p>
<p>Not necessarily money, not necessarily your boss,</p>
<p>but like your peers saying, wow,</p>
<p>this person really knows their stuff, has a lot of value.</p>
<p>So the reputation system came from that.</p>
<p>So we were sort of Frankensteining a bunch of stuff together</p>
<p>in Stack Overflow, like stuff we had seen working</p>
<p>and we knew worked and that became Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>Over time, we realized it wasn&rsquo;t really discussion.</p>
<p>It was very focused questions and answers.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a lot of room on the page</p>
<p>for let me talk about this tangential thing.</p>
<p>It was more like, okay, is it answering the question?</p>
<p>Is it clarifying the question?</p>
<p>Or could it be an alternative answer to the same question?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s usually more than one way to do it</p>
<p>in programming, there&rsquo;s like say five to 10 ways.</p>
<p>And one of the patterns we got into early on</p>
<p>with Stack Overflow was there were questions</p>
<p>where there would be like hundreds of answers.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, wow, how can there be a programming question</p>
<p>with 500, 200, 500 answers?</p>
<p>And we looked at those and we realized</p>
<p>those were not really questions in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>They were discussions.</p>
<p>It was stuff that we allowed early on</p>
<p>that we eventually decided wasn&rsquo;t allowed such as</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your favorite programming food?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the funniest programming cartoon you&rsquo;ve seen?</p>
<p>And we had to sort of backfill a bunch of rules</p>
<p>about like, why isn&rsquo;t this allowed?</p>
<p>Such as, is this a real problem you&rsquo;re facing?</p>
<p>Like nobody goes to work and says, wow, I can&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t know what the funniest programming cartoon is.</p>
<p>So sorry, can&rsquo;t compile this code now, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a real problem you&rsquo;re facing in your job.</p>
<p>So that was run rule.</p>
<p>And the second, like, what can you really learn from that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what I call accidental learning</p>
<p>or Reddit style learning.</p>
<p>Where you&rsquo;re just like, oh, I&rsquo;ll just browse some things</p>
<p>and oh, wow, you know, did you know</p>
<p>tree frogs only live three years?</p>
<p>I mean, I just made that up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t really set out to learn that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to know that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s accidental learning.</p>
<p>It was more intentional learning where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>okay, I have a problem.</p>
<p>And I want to learn about stuff</p>
<p>around this problem having, right?</p>
<p>And it could be theory, it could be compiler theory,</p>
<p>it could be other stuff, but I&rsquo;m having a compiler problem.</p>
<p>Hence, I need to know the compiler theory,</p>
<p>that aspect of it that gets me to my answer, right?</p>
<p>So kind of a directed learning.</p>
<p>So we had to backfill all these rules</p>
<p>as we sort of figured out what the heck it was we were doing.</p>
<p>And the system came very strict over time.</p>
<p>And a lot of people still complain about that.</p>
<p>And I wrote my latest blog entry,</p>
<p>what does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?</p>
<p>Celebrating the 10 year anniversary, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so 10 years.</p>
<p>And the system has trended towards strictness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a variety of reasons for this.</p>
<p>One is people don&rsquo;t like to see other people</p>
<p>get reputation for stuff as they view as frivolous,</p>
<p>which I can actually understand.</p>
<p>Because if you saw a programmer got like 500 upvotes</p>
<p>for funniest programming cartoon</p>
<p>or funniest comment they had seen in code,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, why do they have that reputation?</p>
<p>Is it because they wrote the joke?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>I mean, if they did, maybe, or the cartoon, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting a bunch of reputation</p>
<p>based on someone else&rsquo;s work that&rsquo;s not even programming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a joke, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to programming.</p>
<p>So you begin to resent that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, well, that&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>And it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>At some level, they&rsquo;re correct.</p>
<p>I mean, I empathize.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not correct to get reputation for that.</p>
<p>Versus here&rsquo;s a really gnarly regular expression problem.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a really clever, insightful, detailed answer</p>
<p>laying out, oh, here&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing the behavior that you&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>Here, let me teach you some things about how</p>
<p>to avoid that in the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gold, right?</p>
<p>You want people to get reputation for that,</p>
<p>not so much for, wow, look at this funny thing I saw, right?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this very specific Q&amp;A format.</p>
<p>And then take me through the journey towards discourse</p>
<p>and Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>So you started at the beginning that Stack Overflow</p>
<p>evolved to have a purpose.</p>
<p>So what is discourse, this passion</p>
<p>you have for creating community for discussion?</p>
<p>When was that born and how?</p>
<p>Well, part of it is based on the realization</p>
<p>that Stack Overflow is only good for very specific subjects</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s based on data, facts, and science,</p>
<p>where answers can be kind of verified to be true.</p>
<p>Another form of that is there&rsquo;s the book of knowledge,</p>
<p>like the tome of knowledge that defines whatever it is.</p>
<p>You can refer to that book and it&rsquo;ll give you the answer.</p>
<p>There has to be, it only works on subjects</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like semi clear answers to things</p>
<p>that can be verified in some form.</p>
<p>Now again, there&rsquo;s always more than one way to do it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s complete flexibility and system around that.</p>
<p>But where it falls down is stuff like poker and LEGO.</p>
<p>Like we had, if you go to stackexchange.com,</p>
<p>we have an engine that tries to launch</p>
<p>different Q&amp;A topics, right?</p>
<p>And people can propose Q&amp;A topics, sample questions,</p>
<p>and if it gets enough support within the network,</p>
<p>we launched that Q&amp;A site.</p>
<p>So some of the ones we launched were poker and LEGO</p>
<p>and they did horribly, right?</p>
<p>Because I mean, they might still be there lingering on</p>
<p>in some form, but it was an experiment.</p>
<p>This is like a test, right?</p>
<p>And some subjects work super well on the stack engine</p>
<p>and some don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But the reason LEGO and poker don&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re so social, really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about what&rsquo;s the rule here in poker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, what kind of cigars</p>
<p>do we like to smoke while playing poker?</p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s a cool set of cards to use when I&rsquo;m playing poker?</p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s some strategies?</p>
<p>Say I have this hand come up with some strategies</p>
<p>I could use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a discussion around what&rsquo;s happening with LEGO.</p>
<p>Same thing, here&rsquo;s this cool LEGO set I found.</p>
<p>Look how awesome this is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, that&rsquo;s freaking awesome, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a question, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these social components and discussions</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t fit at all.</p>
<p>We literally have to disallow those in Stack Overflow</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not about being social.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about problems that you&rsquo;re facing in your work</p>
<p>that you need concrete answers for.</p>
<p>You have a real demonstrated problem that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>blocking you in something.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s blocked by, what should I</p>
<p>do when I have a straight flush?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a blocking problem in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an opportunity to hang out and discuss.</p>
<p>So discourse was a way to address that and say, look,</p>
<p>discussion forum software was very, very bad.</p>
<p>And when I came out of Stack Overflow in early 2012,</p>
<p>it was still very, very bad.</p>
<p>I expected it improved in the four years since I last looked,</p>
<p>but it had not improved at all.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, that&rsquo;s kind of terrible</p>
<p>because I love these communities of people talking about things</p>
<p>that they love.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just communities of interest, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no good software for them.</p>
<p>Startups would come to me and say, hey, Jeff,</p>
<p>I want to have this startup.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my idea.</p>
<p>And the first thing I would say to them</p>
<p>is, well, first, why are you asking me?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know your field necessarily.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you asking the community,</p>
<p>the people that are interested in this problem,</p>
<p>the people that are using your product,</p>
<p>why aren&rsquo;t you talking to them?</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;d say, oh, great idea.</p>
<p>How do I do that?</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when I started playing sad trombone</p>
<p>because I realized all the software involving</p>
<p>talking to your users, customers, audience, patrons,</p>
<p>whatever it is, it was all really bad.</p>
<p>It was stuff that I would be embarrassed</p>
<p>to recommend to other people.</p>
<p>And yet, that&rsquo;s where I felt they could get the biggest</p>
<p>and strongest, most effective input</p>
<p>for what they should be doing with their product, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from their users, from their community, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we did on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re talking about with forums,</p>
<p>the, what is it, the dark matter of the internet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s still,</p>
<p>but for the longest time,</p>
<p>it has some of the most passionate</p>
<p>and fascinating discussions.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the usual structure?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually, it&rsquo;s linear, so it&rsquo;s sequential.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re posting one after the other</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s pagination, so it&rsquo;s every,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 10 posts and then you go to the next page.</p>
<p>And that format still is used by,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m, we&rsquo;re doing a lot of research</p>
<p>with Tesla vehicles and there&rsquo;s a Tesla Motors Club forum,</p>
<p>which is extremely.</p>
<p>We really wanted to run that actually.</p>
<p>They pinged us about it, I don&rsquo;t think we got it,</p>
<p>but I really would have liked to gotten that one.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve started before even 2012, I believe.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve been running for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still an extremely rich source of information.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s broken about that system</p>
<p>and how are you trying to fix it?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of power in connecting people</p>
<p>that love the same stuff around that specific topic.</p>
<p>Meaning Facebook&rsquo;s idea of connection is</p>
<p>just any human that&rsquo;s related to another human, right?</p>
<p>Like through friendship or any other reason.</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s idea of the world</p>
<p>is sort of the status update, right?</p>
<p>Like a friend of yours did something,</p>
<p>ate at a restaurant, right?</p>
<p>Whereas discussion forums were traditionally</p>
<p>around the interest graph.</p>
<p>Like I love electric cars,</p>
<p>specifically I love Tesla, right?</p>
<p>Like I love the way they approach the problem.</p>
<p>I love the style of the founder.</p>
<p>I just love the design ethic.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot to like about Tesla.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw the oatmeal,</p>
<p>he did a whole love comic to Tesla.</p>
<p>And it was actually kind of cool</p>
<p>because I learned some stuff.</p>
<p>He was talking about how great Tesla cars were specifically,</p>
<p>like how they were built differently.</p>
<p>And he went into a lot of great detail</p>
<p>that was really interesting.</p>
<p>And to me, that oatmeal post, if you read it,</p>
<p>is the genesis of pretty much all interest communities.</p>
<p>I just really love this stuff.</p>
<p>So like for me, for example, there&rsquo;s yo yos, right?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m into the yo yo communities.</p>
<p>And these interest communities</p>
<p>are just really fascinating to me.</p>
<p>And I feel more connected to the yo yo communities</p>
<p>than I do to friends that I don&rsquo;t see that often, right?</p>
<p>Like to me, the powerful thing is the interest graph.</p>
<p>And Facebook kind of dabbles in the interest graph.</p>
<p>I mean, they have groups,</p>
<p>you can sign up for groups and stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really about the relationship graph.</p>
<p>Like this is my coworker, this is my relative,</p>
<p>this is my friend, but not so much about the interest.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the linchpin</p>
<p>of which forums and communities are built on</p>
<p>that I personally love.</p>
<p>Like I said, leadership is about passion, right?</p>
<p>And being passionate about stuff</p>
<p>is a really valid way to look at the world.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a way a lot of stuff in the world</p>
<p>gets done.</p>
<p>Like I once had someone describe me as,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, Jeff, you&rsquo;re a guy who,</p>
<p>you just get super passionate about a few things at a time,</p>
<p>and you just go super deep in those things.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, that&rsquo;s kind of right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of what I do.</p>
<p>I get into something and just be super into that</p>
<p>for a couple of years or whatever,</p>
<p>and just learn all I can about it,</p>
<p>and go super deep in it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I enjoy experiencing the world, right?</p>
<p>Like not being shallow on a bunch of things,</p>
<p>but being really deep on a few things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>
<p>So forums kind of unlock that, right?</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want a world</p>
<p>where everything belongs to Facebook, at least I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I want a world where communities can kind of own themselves,</p>
<p>set their own norms, set their own rules,</p>
<p>control the experience.</p>
<p>Because community is also about ownership, right?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re meeting at the Barnes and Noble every Thursday</p>
<p>and Barnes and Noble says, get out of here,</p>
<p>you guys don&rsquo;t buy enough books.</p>
<p>Well, you know, you&rsquo;re kind of hosed, right?</p>
<p>Barnes and Noble owns you, right?</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But if you have your own meeting space,</p>
<p>you know, your own clubhouse,</p>
<p>you can set your own rules,</p>
<p>decide what you want to talk about there,</p>
<p>and just really generate a lot better information</p>
<p>than you could like hanging out at Barnes and Noble</p>
<p>every Thursday at 3 p.m., right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the vision of Discourse,</p>
<p>is a place where it&rsquo;s fully open source.</p>
<p>You can take the software, you can install it anywhere,</p>
<p>and, you know, you and a group of people</p>
<p>can go deep on whatever it is that you&rsquo;re into.</p>
<p>And this works for startups, right?</p>
<p>Startups are a group of people</p>
<p>who go super deep on a specific problem, right?</p>
<p>And they want to talk to the community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, install Discourse, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we do at Discourse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I did at Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time on Meta Stack Overflow,</p>
<p>which is our internal, well, public community feedback site,</p>
<p>and just experiencing what the users were experiencing,</p>
<p>right, because they&rsquo;re the ones</p>
<p>doing all the work in the system.</p>
<p>And they had a lot of interesting feedback.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that 90, 10 rule of, like,</p>
<p>90% of the feedback you get is not really actionable</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>It might be bad feedback, it might be crazy feedback,</p>
<p>it might be feedback you just can&rsquo;t act on right now.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s 10% of it that&rsquo;s like gold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like literally gold and diamonds,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like feedback of really good improvements</p>
<p>to your core product that are not super hard to get to</p>
<p>and actually make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>And my favorite is about 5% of those stuff</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even see coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh my God, I never even thought of that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a brilliant idea, right?</p>
<p>And I can point to so many features of Stack Overflow</p>
<p>that we derive from Meta Stack Overflow feedback</p>
<p>and Meta discourse, right?</p>
<p>Same exact principle of discourse, you know?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting ideas from the community.</p>
<p>I was like, oh my God, I never thought of that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s fantastic, right?</p>
<p>Like, I love that relationship with the community.</p>
<p>From having built these communities,</p>
<p>what have you learned about?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the process of getting a critical mass of members</p>
<p>in a community?</p>
<p>Is it luck, skill, timing, persistence?</p>
<p>What is, is it the tools, like discourse,</p>
<p>that empower that community?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the key aspect of starting for one guy or gal</p>
<p>and then building it to two and then 10</p>
<p>and a hundred and a thousand and so on?</p>
<p>I think when you&rsquo;re starting with an N of one,</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s persistence</p>
<p>and also you have to be interesting.</p>
<p>Like somebody I really admire once said something</p>
<p>that I always liked about blogging.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s how you blog.</p>
<p>You have to have something interesting to say</p>
<p>and have an interesting way of saying it, right?</p>
<p>And then do that for like 10 years.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the genesis,</p>
<p>is like you have to have sort of something interesting</p>
<p>to say that&rsquo;s not exactly what everybody else is saying</p>
<p>and an interesting way of saying it,</p>
<p>which is another way of saying,</p>
<p>kind of entertaining way of saying it.</p>
<p>And then as far as growing it, it&rsquo;s like ritual.</p>
<p>You know, like you have to, like say you&rsquo;re starting a blog,</p>
<p>you have to say, look, I&rsquo;m gonna blog every week,</p>
<p>three times a week,</p>
<p>and you have to stick to that schedule, right?</p>
<p>Because until you do that for like several years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never gonna get anywhere.</p>
<p>Like it just takes years to get to where you need to get to.</p>
<p>And part of that is having the discipline</p>
<p>to stick with the schedule.</p>
<p>And it helps, again, if it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re passionate</p>
<p>about, this won&rsquo;t feel like work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I love this.</p>
<p>I could talk about this all day, every day, right?</p>
<p>You just have to do it in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting to other people.</p>
<p>And then as you&rsquo;re growing the community,</p>
<p>that pattern of participation within the community</p>
<p>of like generating these artifacts</p>
<p>and inviting other people to help you</p>
<p>like collaborate on these artifacts,</p>
<p>like even in the case of blogging,</p>
<p>like I felt in the early days of my blog,</p>
<p>which I started in 2004,</p>
<p>which is really the genesis of Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>If you look at all my blog, it leads up to Stack Overflow,</p>
<p>which was, I have all this energy in my blog,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t, like 40,000 people were subscribing to me.</p>
<p>And I was like, I wanna do something.</p>
<p>And then I met Joel and said, hey, Joel,</p>
<p>I wanna do something,</p>
<p>take this ball of energy from my blog and do something.</p>
<p>And all the people reading my blog saw that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, cool.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re involving us.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, look, you&rsquo;re part of this community.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build this thing together.</p>
<p>Like they pick the name.</p>
<p>Like we voted on the name for Stack Overflow on my blog.</p>
<p>Like we came up, and naming is super hard.</p>
<p>First of all, the hardest problem in computer science</p>
<p>is coming up with a good name for stuff, right?</p>
<p>But you can go back to my blog.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the poll where we voted</p>
<p>and Stack Overflow became the name of the site.</p>
<p>And all the early beta users of Stack Overflow</p>
<p>were audience of my blog plus Joel&rsquo;s blog, right?</p>
<p>So we started from, like, if you look at the genesis,</p>
<p>okay, I was just a programmer who said,</p>
<p>hey, I love programming,</p>
<p>but I have no outlet to talk about it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just gonna blog about it,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have enough people to work</p>
<p>to talk to about it.</p>
<p>Because at the time I worked a place where,</p>
<p>you know, programming wasn&rsquo;t the core output</p>
<p>of the company, it was a pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>And I just love this stuff, you know, to an absurd degree.</p>
<p>So I was like, I&rsquo;ll just blog about it.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll find an audience</p>
<p>and eventually found an audience,</p>
<p>eventually found Joel,</p>
<p>and eventually built Stack Overflow</p>
<p>from that one core of activity, right?</p>
<p>But it was that repetition of feeding back in feedback</p>
<p>from my blog comments, feedback from Joel,</p>
<p>feedback from the early Stack Overflow community.</p>
<p>When people see that you&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>they will follow along with you, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, cool, you&rsquo;re here in good faith.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually, you know, not listening to everything</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s impossible, that&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re actually, you know,</p>
<p>waiting our feedback and what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And why wouldn&rsquo;t I?</p>
<p>Because who does all the work on Stack Overflow?</p>
<p>Me, Joel?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the other programmers</p>
<p>that are doing all the work.</p>
<p>So you gotta have some respect for that.</p>
<p>And then, you know, discipline around,</p>
<p>look, you know, we&rsquo;re trying to do a very specific thing</p>
<p>here on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not trying to solve all the world&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to solve this very specific Q and A problem</p>
<p>in a very specific way.</p>
<p>Not cause we&rsquo;re jerks about it,</p>
<p>but because these strict set of rules</p>
<p>help us get really good results, right?</p>
<p>And programmers, that&rsquo;s an easy sell for the most part</p>
<p>because programmers are used to dealing</p>
<p>with ridiculous systems of rules like constantly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically their job.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very, oh yeah, super strict system of rules</p>
<p>that lets me get what I want.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s programming, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Stack Overflow is, so.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re making it sound easy,</p>
<p>but in 2004, let&rsquo;s go back there.</p>
<p>In 2004, you started the blog, Coding Horror.</p>
<p>Was it called that at the very beginning?</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>One of the smart things I did,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from a book by Steve McConnell, Code Complete,</p>
<p>which is one of my favorite programming books,</p>
<p>still probably my number one programming book</p>
<p>for anyone to read.</p>
<p>So one of the smart things I did back then,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t always do smart things when I start stuff.</p>
<p>I contacted Steve and said, hey, I really like this.</p>
<p>It was a sidebar illustration</p>
<p>indicating danger in code, right?</p>
<p>Coding Horror was like, watch out.</p>
<p>And I love that illustration because it spoke to me.</p>
<p>Because I saw that illustration go, oh my God, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m always my own worst enemy.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the key insight in programming is</p>
<p>every time you write something,</p>
<p>think how am I gonna screw myself?</p>
<p>Because you will, constantly, right?</p>
<p>So that icon was like, oh yeah,</p>
<p>I need to constantly hold that mirror up and look,</p>
<p>and say, look, you&rsquo;re very fallible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna screw this up.</p>
<p>Like how can you build this in such a way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not gonna screw it up later?</p>
<p>Like how can you get that discipline around</p>
<p>making sure at every step I&rsquo;m thinking through</p>
<p>all the things that I could do wrong</p>
<p>or that other people could do wrong?</p>
<p>Because that is actually how you get to be</p>
<p>a better programmer a lot of times, right?</p>
<p>So that sidebar illustration, I loved it so much.</p>
<p>And I wrote Steve before I started my blog and said,</p>
<p>hey, can I have permission to use this</p>
<p>because I just really like this illustration?</p>
<p>And Steve was kind enough to give me permission to do that</p>
<p>and just continues to give me permission, so yeah.</p>
<p>Really, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>But in 2004, you started this blog.</p>
<p>You know, you look at Stephen King, his book on writing,</p>
<p>or Stephen Pressfield, War of Art book.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like writers suffer.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a hard process of writing, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be suffering.</p>
<p>I mean, I won&rsquo;t kid you.</p>
<p>Well, the work is suffering, right?</p>
<p>Like doing the work, like even when you&rsquo;re every week,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, okay, that blog post wasn&rsquo;t very good</p>
<p>or people didn&rsquo;t like it or people said disparaging things</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>You have to like have the attitude like, you know,</p>
<p>no matter what happens, I wanna do this for me, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about you, it&rsquo;s about me.</p>
<p>I mean, in the end, it is about everyone</p>
<p>because this is how good work gets out into the world.</p>
<p>But you have to be pretty strict about saying like,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m selfish in the sense</p>
<p>that I have to do this for me.</p>
<p>You know, you mentioned Stephen King,</p>
<p>like his book on writing.</p>
<p>But like one of the things I do, for example,</p>
<p>when writing is like, I read it out loud.</p>
<p>One of the best pieces of advice for writing anything</p>
<p>is read it out loud, like multiple times</p>
<p>and make it sound like you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>because that is the goal of good writing.</p>
<p>It should sound like you said it</p>
<p>with slightly better phrasing</p>
<p>because you have more time to think about what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>but like, it should sound natural when you say it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s probably the single best</p>
<p>writing advice I can give anyone.</p>
<p>Just read it over and over out loud,</p>
<p>make sure it sounds like something you would normally say</p>
<p>and it sounds good.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s your process of writing?</p>
<p>See, there&rsquo;s usually a pretty good idea</p>
<p>behind the blog post.</p>
<p>So ideas, right.</p>
<p>So I think you gotta have the concept</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s so many interesting things in the world.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, my God, the world is amazing, right?</p>
<p>Like you can never write about everything that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so incredible.</p>
<p>But if you can&rsquo;t come up with like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say one interesting thing per day to talk about,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not trying hard enough</p>
<p>because the world is full of just super interesting stuff.</p>
<p>And one great way to like mine stuff</p>
<p>is go back to old books</p>
<p>cause they bring up old stuff that&rsquo;s still super relevant.</p>
<p>And I did that a lot</p>
<p>cause I was like reading classic programming books</p>
<p>and a lot of the early blog posts were like,</p>
<p>oh, I was reading this programming book</p>
<p>and they brought this really cool concept</p>
<p>and I wanna talk about it some more.</p>
<p>And you get the, I mean,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not claiming credit for the idea</p>
<p>but it gives you something interesting to talk about</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of evergreen, right?</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t have to go, what should I talk about?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll just go dig up some old classic programming books</p>
<p>and find something that, oh, wow, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Or how does that apply today?</p>
<p>Or what about X and Y or compare these two concepts.</p>
<p>So pull a couple of sentences from that book</p>
<p>and then sort of play off of it,</p>
<p>almost agree or disagree.</p>
<p>So in 2007, you wrote that you were offered</p>
<p>a significant amount of money to sell the blog.</p>
<p>You chose not to.</p>
<p>What were all the elements you were thinking about?</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;d like to take you back.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a lot of nonlinear decisions</p>
<p>you made through life.</p>
<p>So what was that decision like?</p>
<p>Right, so one of the things I love</p>
<p>is the Choose Your Own Adventure books,</p>
<p>which I loved as a kid</p>
<p>and I feel like they&rsquo;re early programmer books</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re all about if then statements, right?</p>
<p>If this, then this.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also very, very unforgiving.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s all these sites that map</p>
<p>the classic Choose Your Own Adventure books</p>
<p>and how many outcomes are bad, a lot of bad outcomes.</p>
<p>So part of the game is like, oh, I got a bad outcome.</p>
<p>Go back one step, go back one further step.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how did I get here, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a sequence of decisions.</p>
<p>And this is true of life, right?</p>
<p>Like every decision is a sequence, right?</p>
<p>Individually, any individual decision</p>
<p>is not necessarily right or wrong,</p>
<p>but they lead you down a path, right?</p>
<p>So I do think there&rsquo;s some truth to that.</p>
<p>So this particular decision,</p>
<p>the blog had gotten fairly popular.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of RSS readers that I had discovered.</p>
<p>And this guy contacted me out of the blue</p>
<p>from this like bug tracking company.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh, I really wanna buy your blog</p>
<p>for like, I think it was around,</p>
<p>it was $100,000, it might have been like 80,000,</p>
<p>but it was a lot, right?</p>
<p>Like, and that&rsquo;s, you know, at the time,</p>
<p>like I would have a year&rsquo;s worth of salary all at once.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t really think about like, well, you know,</p>
<p>and I remember talking to people at the time,</p>
<p>I was like, wow, that&rsquo;s a lot of money.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;m like, I really like my blog, right?</p>
<p>Like, do I wanna sell my blog?</p>
<p>Cause it wouldn&rsquo;t really belong to me anymore at that point.</p>
<p>And one of the guidelines that I like to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to give advice to people a lot,</p>
<p>but one of the pieces of advice I do give,</p>
<p>cause I do think it&rsquo;s really true and it&rsquo;s generally helpful</p>
<p>is whenever you&rsquo;re looking at a set of decisions,</p>
<p>like, oh gosh, should I do A, B or C,</p>
<p>you gotta pick the thing that&rsquo;s a little scarier</p>
<p>in that list because not, you know,</p>
<p>not like jump off a cliff scary,</p>
<p>but the thing that makes you nervous.</p>
<p>Cause if you pick the safe choice,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually, you&rsquo;re not really pushing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not pushing yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not choosing the thing that&rsquo;s gonna help you grow.</p>
<p>So for me, the scarier choice was to say no.</p>
<p>I was like, well, no, let&rsquo;s just see where this is going.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Because then I own it.</p>
<p>I mean, it belongs to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my thing.</p>
<p>And I can just take it</p>
<p>and tell some other logical conclusion, right?</p>
<p>Because imagine how different the world would have been</p>
<p>had I said yes and sold the blog.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there probably wouldn&rsquo;t be Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of other stuff would have changed.</p>
<p>So for that particular decision,</p>
<p>I think it was that same rule.</p>
<p>Like what scares me a little bit more.</p>
<p>Do the thing that scares you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So speaking of which, startups.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a specific, some more general questions</p>
<p>that a lot of people would be interested in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve started Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>You started this course.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the, it was one, two, three guys,</p>
<p>whatever it is in the beginning.</p>
<p>What was that process like?</p>
<p>Do you start talking about it?</p>
<p>Do you start programming?</p>
<p>Do you start, like, where&rsquo;s the birth</p>
<p>and the catalyst that actually.</p>
<p>Well, I can talk about it in the context</p>
<p>of both Stack Overflow and Discourse.</p>
<p>So I think the key thing initially is there is a problem.</p>
<p>Something, there&rsquo;s some state of the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unsatisfactory to the point that, like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re upset about it, right?</p>
<p>Like, in that case, it was experts exchange.</p>
<p>I mean, Joel&rsquo;s original idea,</p>
<p>because I approached Joel as like,</p>
<p>look, Joel, I have all this energy behind my blog.</p>
<p>I want to do something.</p>
<p>I want to build something.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know what it is,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m honestly not a good idea person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like the execution guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really good at execution,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not good at, like, blue skying ideas.</p>
<p>Not my forte.</p>
<p>Which is another reason why I like the community feedback,</p>
<p>because they blue sky all day long for you, right?</p>
<p>So when I can just go in and cherry pick</p>
<p>a blue sky idea from community,</p>
<p>even if I have to spend three hours reading</p>
<p>to get one good idea, it&rsquo;s worth it, man.</p>
<p>But anyway, so the idea from Joel was,</p>
<p>hey, experts exchange, it&rsquo;s got great data,</p>
<p>but the experience is hideous, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to trick you.</p>
<p>It feels like used car salesman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just bad.</p>
<p>So I was like, oh, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>It feeds into community.</p>
<p>It feeds into, like, you know,</p>
<p>we can make creative comments.</p>
<p>So I think the core is to have a really good idea</p>
<p>that you feel very strongly about in the beginning,</p>
<p>that, like, there&rsquo;s a wrong in the world,</p>
<p>an injustice that we will write</p>
<p>through the process of building this thing.</p>
<p>For Discourse, it was like, look,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no good software for communities</p>
<p>to just hang out and, like, do stuff, right?</p>
<p>Like, whether it&rsquo;s problem solving, startup, whatever.</p>
<p>Forums are such a great building block of online community,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re hideous.</p>
<p>They were so bad, right?</p>
<p>It was embarrassing.</p>
<p>Like, I literally was embarrassed</p>
<p>to be associated with this software, right?</p>
<p>I was like, we have to have software that you can be proud of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is competitive with Reddit.</p>
<p>This is competitive with Twitter.</p>
<p>This is competitive with Facebook, right?</p>
<p>I would be proud to have the software on my site.</p>
<p>So that was the genesis of Discourse,</p>
<p>was feeling very strongly about there needs to be</p>
<p>a good solution for communities.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s step one.</p>
<p>Genesis of an idea you feel super strongly about, right?</p>
<p>And then people galvanize around the idea.</p>
<p>Like, Joel was already super excited about the idea.</p>
<p>I was excited about the idea.</p>
<p>So with the forum software, I was posting on Twitter.</p>
<p>I had researched, as part of my research,</p>
<p>I start researching the problem, right?</p>
<p>And I found a game called Forum Wars,</p>
<p>which was a parody of forum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still very, very funny, of forum behavior,</p>
<p>circa, I would say, 2003.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s aged some, right?</p>
<p>Like, the behavior&rsquo;s a little different in there of Twitter.</p>
<p>But it was awesome.</p>
<p>It was very funny.</p>
<p>And it was like a game.</p>
<p>It was like an RPG.</p>
<p>And it had a forum attached to it.</p>
<p>So it was like a game about forums with a forum attached.</p>
<p>I was like, this is awesome, right?</p>
<p>This is so cool.</p>
<p>And the founder of that company, or that project,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t really a company, contacted me,</p>
<p>this guy Robin Ward from Toronto.</p>
<p>He said, hey, I saw you&rsquo;ve been talking about forums.</p>
<p>And I really love that problem space.</p>
<p>He was like, I&rsquo;d still love to build really good forum</p>
<p>software, because I don&rsquo;t think anything out there&rsquo;s any good.</p>
<p>And I was like, awesome.</p>
<p>At that point, I was like, we&rsquo;re starting a company.</p>
<p>Because I couldn&rsquo;t have whooshed for a better person</p>
<p>to walk through the door and say, I&rsquo;m excited about this,</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>Same thing with Joel, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Joel is a legend in the industry, right?</p>
<p>So when he walked through and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about this problem, I was like, me too, man.</p>
<p>We can do this, right?</p>
<p>So that, to me, is the most important step.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, having an idea you&rsquo;re super excited about,</p>
<p>and another person, a cofounder, right?</p>
<p>Because again, you get that dual leadership, right?</p>
<p>Am I making a bad decision?</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to have checks of like,</p>
<p>is this a good idea?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>So those are the crucial seeds.</p>
<p>But then starting to build stuff,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s you programming or somebody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There is prototyping.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s tons of research.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tons of research, like, what&rsquo;s out there that failed?</p>
<p>Because a lot of people look at the successes.</p>
<p>Oh, look at how successful X is.</p>
<p>Everybody looks at the successes.</p>
<p>Those are boring.</p>
<p>Show me the failures, because that is what&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where people were experimenting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where people were pushing.</p>
<p>And they failed, but they probably</p>
<p>failed for reasons that weren&rsquo;t directly</p>
<p>about the quality of their idea, right?</p>
<p>So look at all the failures.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just look what everybody looks at, which is like, oh,</p>
<p>gosh, look at all these successful people.</p>
<p>Look at the failures.</p>
<p>Look at the things that didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Research the entire field.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the research that I was doing</p>
<p>that led me to Robin, right?</p>
<p>Was that.</p>
<p>And then when we, for example, when we did Stack Overflow,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like, okay, well, I really like elements</p>
<p>of voting and dig and read it.</p>
<p>I like the Wikipedia, everything&rsquo;s up to date.</p>
<p>Nothing is like an old tombstone</p>
<p>that has horrible out of date information.</p>
<p>We know that works.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is an amazing resource.</p>
<p>Blogging, the idea of ownership is so powerful, right?</p>
<p>Like, oh, I, Joe wrote this,</p>
<p>and look how good Joe&rsquo;s answer is, right?</p>
<p>All these concepts were rolling together.</p>
<p>Researching all the things that were out there</p>
<p>that were working and why they were working</p>
<p>and trying to fold them into, again,</p>
<p>that Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster of what Stack Overflow is.</p>
<p>And by the way, that wasn&rsquo;t a free decision</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s still a ton of tension</p>
<p>in the Stack Overflow system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s reasons people complain about Stack Overflow</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so strict, right?</p>
<p>Why is it so strict?</p>
<p>Why are you guys always closing my questions?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s so much tension</p>
<p>that we built into the system</p>
<p>around trying to get good, good results out of the system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a free.</p>
<p>That stuff doesn&rsquo;t come for free, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we, we all have perfect answers</p>
<p>and nobody will have to get their feelings heard</p>
<p>or nobody will have to get downvoted.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work that way, right?</p>
<p>So this is an interesting point and a small tangent.</p>
<p>You write about anxiety.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve posted a lot of questions</p>
<p>and written answers on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>On the question side, you usually go to</p>
<p>something very specific to something I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>And this is something you talk about</p>
<p>that really the goal of Stack Overflow isn&rsquo;t about,</p>
<p>is to write a question that&rsquo;s not about you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the question that will help</p>
<p>the community in the future.</p>
<p>Right, but that&rsquo;s a tough sell, right?</p>
<p>Because people are like, well,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care about the community.</p>
<p>What I care about is my problem.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fair, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of that, again, that tension,</p>
<p>that balancing act of we wanna help you,</p>
<p>but we also wanna help everybody that comes behind you.</p>
<p>The long line of people are gonna come up and say,</p>
<p>oh, I kinda have that problem too, right?</p>
<p>And if nobody&rsquo;s ever gonna come up and say,</p>
<p>I have this problem too,</p>
<p>then that question shouldn&rsquo;t exist on Stack Overflow</p>
<p>because the question is too specific.</p>
<p>And even that&rsquo;s tension, right?</p>
<p>How do you judge that?</p>
<p>How do you know that nobody&rsquo;s ever gonna have</p>
<p>this particular question again?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of tension in the system.</p>
<p>Do you think that anxiety of asking the question,</p>
<p>the anxiety of answering,</p>
<p>that tension is inherent to programmers,</p>
<p>is inherent to this kind of process?</p>
<p>Or can it be improved?</p>
<p>Can it be happy land</p>
<p>where that tension is not quite so harsh?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Stack Overflow</p>
<p>can totally change the way it works.</p>
<p>One thing they are working on finally</p>
<p>is the ask page had not changed since 2011.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still kind of bitter about this</p>
<p>because I feel like you have a Q&amp;A system</p>
<p>and what are the core pages in a Q&amp;A system?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, the question,</p>
<p>all the answers and also the ask page,</p>
<p>particularly when you&rsquo;re a new user</p>
<p>or someone trying to ask a question,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the point at which you need the most help.</p>
<p>And we just didn&rsquo;t adapt with the times.</p>
<p>But the good news is they&rsquo;re working on this,</p>
<p>from what I understand,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be a more wizard based format.</p>
<p>And you could envision a world</p>
<p>where as part of this wizard based program,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re asking questions,</p>
<p>okay, come up with a good title,</p>
<p>what are good words to put in the title?</p>
<p>One word that&rsquo;s not good to put in the title</p>
<p>is problem, for example.</p>
<p>I have a problem.</p>
<p>Oh, you have a problem.</p>
<p>Okay, a problem, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You need specifics.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s trying to help you make a good question title,</p>
<p>for example, that step will be broken out, all that stuff.</p>
<p>But one of those steps in that wizard of asking</p>
<p>could say, hey, I&rsquo;m a little nervous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done this before.</p>
<p>Can you put me in a queue for special mentoring?</p>
<p>You could opt in to a special mentor.</p>
<p>I think that would be fantastic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any objection to that at all</p>
<p>in terms of being an opt in system.</p>
<p>Because there are people that are like,</p>
<p>I just wanna help them.</p>
<p>I wanna help a person no matter what.</p>
<p>I wanna go above and beyond.</p>
<p>I wanna spend hours with this person.</p>
<p>It depends what their goals are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>Who am I to judge?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not precluded from happening.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a certain big city ethos</p>
<p>that we started with.</p>
<p>Like, look, we&rsquo;re in New York City.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t come to New York City</p>
<p>and expect them to be, oh, welcome to the city, Joe.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p>Come on in.</p>
<p>Let me show you around.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how New York City works.</p>
<p>Again, New York City has a reputation for being rude,</p>
<p>which I actually don&rsquo;t think it is,</p>
<p>having been there fairly recently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not rude.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like going about their business.</p>
<p>Like, look, I have things to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m busy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a busy professional, as are you.</p>
<p>And since you&rsquo;re a busy professional,</p>
<p>certainly when you ask a question,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna ask the best possible question.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re a busy professional</p>
<p>and you would not accept anything less</p>
<p>than a very well written question</p>
<p>with a lot of detail about why you&rsquo;re doing it,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing, what you researched,</p>
<p>what you found,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a professional like me.</p>
<p>And this rubs people sometimes the wrong way.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wrong to say,</p>
<p>look, I don&rsquo;t want that experience.</p>
<p>I want just a more chill place for beginners.</p>
<p>And I still think Stack Overflow</p>
<p>is not, was never designed for beginners, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this misconception that,</p>
<p>even Joel says sometimes,</p>
<p>oh yeah, Stack Overflow for beginners.</p>
<p>And I think if you&rsquo;re a prodigy, it can be.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But for the most part, not.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not really representative, right?</p>
<p>Like, I think as a beginner,</p>
<p>you want a totally different set of tools.</p>
<p>You want like live screen sharing, live chat.</p>
<p>You want access to resources.</p>
<p>You want a playground,</p>
<p>like a playground you can experiment in</p>
<p>and like test and all this stuff</p>
<p>that we just don&rsquo;t give people</p>
<p>because that was never really the audience</p>
<p>that we were designing Stack Overflow for.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>And I think it would be awesome</p>
<p>if there was a site like that on the internet,</p>
<p>or if Stack Overflow said,</p>
<p>hey, you know, we&rsquo;re gonna start doing this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine too.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making those decisions.</p>
<p>But I do think the pressure,</p>
<p>the tension that you described is there for people to be,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m a little nervous</p>
<p>because I know I gotta do my best work, right?</p>
<p>The other one is something you talk about,</p>
<p>which is also really interesting to me,</p>
<p>is duplicate questions or it&rsquo;s a really difficult problem</p>
<p>that you highlight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super hard.</p>
<p>Like you could take one little topic</p>
<p>and you could probably write 10, 20, 30 ways</p>
<p>of asking about that topic</p>
<p>and there will be all different.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there should be one page</p>
<p>that answers all of it.</p>
<p>Is there a way that Stack Overflow can help disambiguate,</p>
<p>like separate these duplicate questions</p>
<p>or connect them together?</p>
<p>Or is it a totally hopeless, difficult, impossible task?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very, very hard computer science problem.</p>
<p>And partly because people are very good</p>
<p>at using completely different words.</p>
<p>It always amazed me on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have two questions that were functionally identical</p>
<p>and one question had like zero words in common</p>
<p>with the other question.</p>
<p>Like, oh my God, from a computer science perspective,</p>
<p>how do you even begin to solve that?</p>
<p>And it happens all the time.</p>
<p>People are super good at this, right?</p>
<p>Accidentally at asking the same thing</p>
<p>in like 10, 20 different ways.</p>
<p>And the other complexity is we want some</p>
<p>of those duplicates to exist</p>
<p>because if there&rsquo;s five versions with different words,</p>
<p>have those five versions point</p>
<p>to the one centralized answer, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, this is a duplicate, no worries.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the answer that you wanted over here</p>
<p>on the prime example that we want to have,</p>
<p>rather than having 10 copies of the question and the answer.</p>
<p>Because if you have 10 copies of the question and answer,</p>
<p>this also devalues the reputation system,</p>
<p>which programmers hate, as I previously mentioned.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting reputation for an answer</p>
<p>that somebody else already gave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, it&rsquo;s an answer,</p>
<p>but somebody else already gave that answer.</p>
<p>So why are you getting reputation for the same answer</p>
<p>as the other guy who gave it four years ago?</p>
<p>People get offended by that, right?</p>
<p>So the reputation system itself adds tension to the system</p>
<p>in that the people who have a lot of reputation</p>
<p>become very incentivized to enforce the reputation system.</p>
<p>And for the most part, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I know it sounds weird, but for most parts,</p>
<p>like look, strict systems, I think to use Stack Overflow,</p>
<p>you have to have the idea that, OK, strict systems ultimately</p>
<p>work better.</p>
<p>And I do think in programming, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>familiar with loose typing versus strict typing, right?</p>
<p>The idea that you can declare a variable,</p>
<p>not declare a variable, rather, just start using a variable.</p>
<p>And OK, I see it&rsquo;s implicitly an integer.</p>
<p>Bam, awesome.</p>
<p>Duck equals 5.</p>
<p>Well, duck is now an integer of 5, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, cool, awesome, simpler, right?</p>
<p>Why would I want to worry about typing?</p>
<p>And for a long time, in the Ruby community,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, yeah, this is awesome.</p>
<p>You just do a bunch of unit testing,</p>
<p>which is testing your program&rsquo;s validity after the fact</p>
<p>to catch any bugs that strict typing of variables</p>
<p>would have caught.</p>
<p>And now you have this thing called</p>
<p>TypeScript for Microsoft from the guy who</p>
<p>built C Sharp Anders, who&rsquo;s one of the greatest</p>
<p>minds in software development, right,</p>
<p>like in terms of language design.</p>
<p>And says, no, no, no, we want to bolt on a strict type</p>
<p>system to JavaScript because it makes things better.</p>
<p>And now everybody&rsquo;s like, oh my god, we deployed TypeScript</p>
<p>and found 50 latent bugs that we didn&rsquo;t know about, right?</p>
<p>Like, this is super common.</p>
<p>So I think there is a truth in programming</p>
<p>that strictness, it&rsquo;s not the goal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not saying be super strict because strictness is correct.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s no, no.</p>
<p>Strictness produces better results.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying, right?</p>
<p>So strict typing of variables, I would</p>
<p>say you almost universally have consensus now</p>
<p>is basically correct.</p>
<p>Should be that way in every language, right?</p>
<p>Duck equals five should generate an error</p>
<p>because no, you didn&rsquo;t declare.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t tell me that duck was an integer, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bug, right?</p>
<p>Or maybe you mistyped.</p>
<p>You typed deck instead of duck, right?</p>
<p>You never know.</p>
<p>This happens all the time, right?</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I will say that the strictness</p>
<p>of the system is correct.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean cruel.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean mean.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean angry.</p>
<p>It just means strict, OK?</p>
<p>So I think where there&rsquo;s misunderstanding</p>
<p>is people get cranky, right?</p>
<p>Like, another question you asked is like, why are programmers</p>
<p>kind of mean sometimes?</p>
<p>Well, who do programmers work with all day long?</p>
<p>So I have a theory that if you&rsquo;re at a job</p>
<p>and you work with assholes all day long,</p>
<p>what do you eventually become?</p>
<p>An asshole.</p>
<p>And what is the computer except the world&rsquo;s biggest asshole?</p>
<p>Because the computer has no time for your bullshit.</p>
<p>The computer, the minute you make a mistake,</p>
<p>everything is crashing down, right?</p>
<p>One semicolon has crashed space missions, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>So you begin to internalize that.</p>
<p>You begin to think, oh, my coworker, the computer,</p>
<p>is super strict and kind of a jerk about everything.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of how I&rsquo;m going to be.</p>
<p>Because I work with this computer,</p>
<p>and I have to exceed to its terms on everything.</p>
<p>So therefore, you start to absorb that.</p>
<p>You start to think, oh, well, being really strict arbitrarily</p>
<p>is really good.</p>
<p>An error of error code 56249 is a completely good error message</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what the computer gave me, right?</p>
<p>So you kind of forget to be a person at some level.</p>
<p>And you know how they say great detectives internalize</p>
<p>criminals and kind of are criminals themselves,</p>
<p>like this trope of the master detective</p>
<p>is good because he can think like the criminal.</p>
<p>Well, I do think that&rsquo;s true of programmers.</p>
<p>Really good programmers think like the computer</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s their job.</p>
<p>But if you internalize it too much, you become the computer.</p>
<p>You kind of become a jerk to everybody</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve internalized.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re almost not a jerk, but you have no patience</p>
<p>for a lack of strictness, as you said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not out of a sense of meanness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s accidental.</p>
<p>But I do believe it&rsquo;s an occupational hazard</p>
<p>of being a programmer is you start</p>
<p>to behave like the computer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very unforgiving.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very terse.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very, oh, wrong, incorrect, move on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, can you help me?</p>
<p>What could I do to fix?</p>
<p>No, wrong, next question.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s normal for the computer.</p>
<p>Just fail, next.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember in Saturday Night Live,</p>
<p>in the 90s, they had this character who was an IT guy.</p>
<p>The move guy.</p>
<p>Move.</p>
<p>Was that Jimmy Fallon?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Who played him?</p>
<p>OK, yeah, I remember.</p>
<p>Move.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>He had no patience for it.</p>
<p>Might have been Mad TV, actually.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it Mad TV?</p>
<p>Might have been.</p>
<p>But anyway, that&rsquo;s always been the perception.</p>
<p>You start to behave like the computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, you&rsquo;re wrong, out of the way, you know?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written so many blog posts about programming,</p>
<p>about programs, programming, programmers.</p>
<p>What do you think makes a good, let&rsquo;s start with,</p>
<p>what makes a good solo programmer?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think you should be a solo programmer.</p>
<p>I think to be a good solo programmer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like what I talked about, well, not on Mike,</p>
<p>but one of the things John Carmack, one of the best</p>
<p>points he makes in the book Masters of Doom, which</p>
<p>is a fantastic book, and anybody listening to this</p>
<p>who hasn&rsquo;t read it, please read it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a great book, is that at the time,</p>
<p>they were working on stuff like Wolfenstein and Doom.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have the resources that we have today.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have Wikipedia.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have discourse forums.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have places to go to get people to help them.</p>
<p>They had to work on their own.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it took a genius like Carmack</p>
<p>to do this stuff, because you had</p>
<p>to be a genius to invent from first principles.</p>
<p>A lot of the stuff he was like, the hacks he was coming up</p>
<p>with were genius, genius level stuff.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t need to be a genius anymore,</p>
<p>and that means not working by yourself.</p>
<p>You have to be good at researching stuff online.</p>
<p>You have to be good at asking questions, really good</p>
<p>questions that are really well researched, which implies,</p>
<p>oh, I went out and researched for three hours</p>
<p>before I wrote these questions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you should be doing, because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to make you good.</p>
<p>To me, this is the big difference</p>
<p>between programming in the 80s versus programming today,</p>
<p>is you kind of had to be by yourself back then.</p>
<p>Where would you go for answers?</p>
<p>I remember in the early days when</p>
<p>I was learning Visual Basic for Windows,</p>
<p>I would call the Microsoft Helpline on the phone</p>
<p>when I had programming.</p>
<p>Because I was like, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>So I would go and call, and they had these huge phone banks.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, can you imagine how alien that is now?</p>
<p>Who would do that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>So there was just nowhere else to go when you got stuck.</p>
<p>I had the books that came with it.</p>
<p>I read those, studied those religiously.</p>
<p>I just saw a post from Steve Sanofsky</p>
<p>that said the C++ version 7 came with 10,000 pages</p>
<p>of written material.</p>
<p>Because where else were you going to figure that stuff out?</p>
<p>Go to the library?</p>
<p>I mean, you didn&rsquo;t have Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have Reddit.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have anywhere to go to answer these questions.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked about, through the years,</p>
<p>basically not having an ego and not</p>
<p>thinking that you&rsquo;re the best programmer in the world.</p>
<p>So always kind of just looking to improve,</p>
<p>to become a better programmer than you were yesterday.</p>
<p>So how have you changed as a programmer</p>
<p>and as a thinker, designer around programming</p>
<p>over the past, what is it, 15 years, really,</p>
<p>of being a public figure?</p>
<p>I would say the big insight that I had is, eventually,</p>
<p>as a programmer, you have to stop writing code</p>
<p>to be effective, which is kind of disturbing.</p>
<p>Because you really love it.</p>
<p>But you realize being effective at programming,</p>
<p>at programming in the general sense,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean writing code.</p>
<p>And a lot of times, you can be much more successful by not</p>
<p>writing code and writing code in terms of just solving</p>
<p>the problems you have, essentially hiring people</p>
<p>that are really good and setting them free</p>
<p>and giving them basic direction on strategy and stuff.</p>
<p>Because a lot of the problems you encounter</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t necessarily solved through really gnarly code.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re solved by conceptual solutions, which can then</p>
<p>be turned into code.</p>
<p>But are you even solving the right problem?</p>
<p>So I would say, for me, the main insight I have</p>
<p>is, to succeed as a programmer, you eventually</p>
<p>kind of stop writing code.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to sound discouraging, probably,</p>
<p>to people hearing.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t mean it that way.</p>
<p>What I mean is that you&rsquo;re coding</p>
<p>at a higher level language.</p>
<p>Eventually, like, OK, so we&rsquo;re coding in assembly language.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beginning, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hardcoded to the architecture.</p>
<p>Then you have stuff like C, where it&rsquo;s like, wow,</p>
<p>we can abstract across the architecture.</p>
<p>We can write code.</p>
<p>I can then compile that code for ARM</p>
<p>or whatever x86 or whatever else is out there.</p>
<p>And then even higher level than that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at Python, Ruby, interpreted languages.</p>
<p>And then, to me, as a programmer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, OK, I want to go even higher.</p>
<p>I want to go higher than that.</p>
<p>How do I abstract higher than the language?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, you abstract in spoken language</p>
<p>and written language, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sort of inspiring people to get things done,</p>
<p>giving them guidance, like, what if we did this?</p>
<p>What if we did this?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re writing in the highest level language</p>
<p>that there is, which is, for me, English,</p>
<p>whatever your spoken language is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all about being effective, right?</p>
<p>And I think Patrick McKenzie, patio11 on Hacker News</p>
<p>and works at Stripe, has a great post about this,</p>
<p>of how calling yourself a programmer</p>
<p>is a career limiting move at some level</p>
<p>once you get far enough from your career.</p>
<p>And I really believe that.</p>
<p>And again, I apologize.</p>
<p>This is sound discouraging.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean it to be, but he&rsquo;s so right.</p>
<p>Because all the stuff that goes on around the code,</p>
<p>like the people, that&rsquo;s another thing,</p>
<p>if you look at my early blog entries, is about, wow,</p>
<p>programming is about people more than it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about code, which doesn&rsquo;t really make sense.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s about, can these people even get along together?</p>
<p>Can they understand each other?</p>
<p>Can you even explain to me what it is you&rsquo;re working on?</p>
<p>Are you solving the right problem?</p>
<p>PeopleWare, another classic programming book,</p>
<p>which, again, up there with Code Complete,</p>
<p>please read PeopleWare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that software is people.</p>
<p>People are the software, first and foremost.</p>
<p>So a lot of the skills that I was working on early</p>
<p>in the blog were about figuring out the people</p>
<p>parts of programming, which were the harder parts.</p>
<p>The hard part of programming, once you</p>
<p>get a certain skill level in programming,</p>
<p>you can pretty much solve any reasonable problem that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>put in front of you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not writing algorithms from scratch.</p>
<p>That just doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So any sort of reasonable problem put in front of you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be able to solve.</p>
<p>But what you can&rsquo;t solve is, our manager is a total jerk.</p>
<p>You cannot solve that with code.</p>
<p>That is not a code solvable problem.</p>
<p>And yet, that will cripple you way more than, oh, we</p>
<p>had to use this stupid framework I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>or Sam keeps writing bad code that I hate,</p>
<p>or Dave is off there in the wilderness writing</p>
<p>God knows what.</p>
<p>These are not your problems.</p>
<p>Your problem is your manager or a co worker</p>
<p>is so toxic to everybody else in your team</p>
<p>that nobody can get anything done,</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s so stressed out and freaked out.</p>
<p>These are the problems that you have to attack.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And so as you go to these higher level abstractions,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve developed as a programmer</p>
<p>to higher and higher level abstractions</p>
<p>and go into natural language, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also the guy who preached building it, diving in</p>
<p>and doing it, and learn by doing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you worry that as you get to higher and higher level</p>
<p>abstractions, you lose track of the lower level of just</p>
<p>building?</p>
<p>Do you worry about that, even not maybe now,</p>
<p>but 10 years from now, 20 years from now?</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>I mean, there is always that paranoia around, oh, gosh,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s valuable since I&rsquo;m not writing code.</p>
<p>But for me, when we started the discourse project,</p>
<p>it was Ruby, which I didn&rsquo;t really know Ruby.</p>
<p>I mean, as you pointed out, and this</p>
<p>is another valuable observation in Stack Overflow,</p>
<p>you can be super proficient in, for example, C Sharp,</p>
<p>which I was working in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we built Stack Overflow in and still</p>
<p>is written in.</p>
<p>And then switch to Ruby, and you&rsquo;re a newbie again.</p>
<p>But you have the framework.</p>
<p>I know what a for loop is.</p>
<p>I know what recursion is.</p>
<p>I know what a stack trace is.</p>
<p>I have all the fundamental concepts to be a programmer.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know Ruby.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m still on a higher level.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like a beginner beginner, like you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, I need to apply my programming concepts I already</p>
<p>know to Ruby.</p>
<p>Well, so there&rsquo;s a question that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So looking at Ruby, how do you go about learning enough</p>
<p>that your intuition can be applied, carried over?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was trying to get to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what I realized, particularly when I started</p>
<p>with just me and Robin, I realized if I bother Robin,</p>
<p>I am now costing us productivity.</p>
<p>Every time I go to Robin, rather than building our first alpha</p>
<p>version of discourse, he&rsquo;s now answering my stupid questions</p>
<p>about Ruby.</p>
<p>Is that a good use of his time?</p>
<p>Is that a good use of my time?</p>
<p>And the answer to both of those was resoundingly no.</p>
<p>We were getting to an alpha, and it was pretty much just,</p>
<p>OK, we&rsquo;ll hire more programmers.</p>
<p>We eventually hired Neil, and then eventually Sam,</p>
<p>who came in as a cofounder.</p>
<p>Actually, it was Sam first, then Neil later.</p>
<p>But the answer to the problem is just</p>
<p>hire other competent programmers.</p>
<p>Now I shall pull myself up by my bootstraps</p>
<p>and learn Ruby.</p>
<p>But at some point, writing code becomes a liability to you</p>
<p>in terms of getting things done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many other things that</p>
<p>go on in the project, like building the prototype.</p>
<p>You mentioned, well, how do you, if you&rsquo;re not writing code,</p>
<p>how does everybody keep focus on what are we building?</p>
<p>Well, first, basic mockups and research.</p>
<p>What do we even want to build?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of that that goes on.</p>
<p>But then very quickly, you get to the prototype stage.</p>
<p>Like, build a prototype.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s iterate on the prototype really, really rapidly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we do with discourse.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we demoed to get our seed funding</p>
<p>for discourse was the alpha version of discourse</p>
<p>that we had running and ready to go.</p>
<p>And it was very, it was bad.</p>
<p>I mean, it was, I&rsquo;ll just tell you it was bad.</p>
<p>We have screenshots of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just embarrassed to look at it now.</p>
<p>But it was the prototype.</p>
<p>We were figuring out what&rsquo;s working, what&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s such a broad gap between the way</p>
<p>you think things will work in your mind or even on paper</p>
<p>and the way they work once you sit and live in the software,</p>
<p>like actually spend time living and breathing in software,</p>
<p>so different.</p>
<p>So my philosophy is get to a prototype.</p>
<p>And then what you&rsquo;re really optimizing</p>
<p>for is speed of iteration, like how you can turn the crank.</p>
<p>How quickly can we iterate?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the absolutely critical metric</p>
<p>of any software project.</p>
<p>And I had a tweet recently that people liked.</p>
<p>And I totally, this is so fundamental to what I do,</p>
<p>is like if you want to measure the core competency of any</p>
<p>software tech company, it&rsquo;s the speed at which somebody</p>
<p>can say, hey, we really need this word in the product.</p>
<p>Change this word, right?</p>
<p>Because it will be more clear to the user.</p>
<p>Like, instead of respond, it&rsquo;s reply or something.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some, from the conception of that idea</p>
<p>to how quickly that single word can be changed in your software</p>
<p>and rolled out to users, that is your life cycle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your health, your heartbeat.</p>
<p>If your heartbeat is like super slow, you&rsquo;re basically dead.</p>
<p>No, seriously.</p>
<p>Like, if it takes two weeks or even a month</p>
<p>to get that single word changed, everybody&rsquo;s like, oh my god,</p>
<p>this is a great idea.</p>
<p>That word is so much clearer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about like a super, like everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on board for this change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, let&rsquo;s just change a word because we&rsquo;re bored.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is an awesome change.</p>
<p>And then it takes months to roll out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t iterate.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, how are you going to do anything, right?</p>
<p>So anyway, about the heartbeat, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, get the prototype and then iterate on it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I view as the central tenet of modern software</p>
<p>development.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating that you put it that way.</p>
<p>So I work and I build autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>And when you look at what, maybe compare Tesla</p>
<p>to most other automakers, the heart beat for Tesla</p>
<p>is literally days now in terms of they can over the air</p>
<p>deploy software updates to all their vehicles, which</p>
<p>is markedly different than every other automaker, which takes</p>
<p>years to update a piece of software.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s reflected in everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the final product.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s reflected in really how slowly they</p>
<p>adapt to the times.</p>
<p>And to be clear, I&rsquo;m not saying being a hummingbird</p>
<p>is the goal either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t want a heartbeat that&rsquo;s like so fast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re just freaking out.</p>
<p>But it is a measure of health.</p>
<p>You should have a healthy heartbeat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to people listening to decide what that means.</p>
<p>But it has to be healthy.</p>
<p>It has to be reasonable.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, you&rsquo;re just going</p>
<p>to be frustrated because that&rsquo;s how you build software.</p>
<p>You make mistakes.</p>
<p>You roll it out.</p>
<p>You live with it.</p>
<p>You see what it feels like and say, oh, God,</p>
<p>that was a terrible idea.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh, this could be even better if we did Y, right?</p>
<p>You turn the crank.</p>
<p>And then the more you do that, the faster</p>
<p>you get ahead of your competitors ultimately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rate of change, right?</p>
<p>Delta V, right?</p>
<p>How fast are you moving?</p>
<p>Well, within a year, you&rsquo;re going to be miles away</p>
<p>by the time they catch up with you, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way it works.</p>
<p>And plus, as a software developer and user,</p>
<p>I love software that&rsquo;s constantly changing.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t understand people who get super pissed off</p>
<p>when like, oh, they changed the software on me.</p>
<p>How dare they?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yes, change the software.</p>
<p>Change it all the time, man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes this stuff great</p>
<p>is that it can be changed so rapidly</p>
<p>and become something that is greater than it is now.</p>
<p>Now, granted, there are some changes that suck.</p>
<p>I admit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it many times.</p>
<p>But in general, that&rsquo;s what makes software cool, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that it is so malleable.</p>
<p>Fighting that is weird to me.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, well, you&rsquo;re fighting</p>
<p>the essence of the thing that you&rsquo;re building.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>You want to really embrace that.</p>
<p>Not to be a hummingbird, but embrace it</p>
<p>to a healthy cycle of your heartbeat, right?</p>
<p>So you talk about that people really don&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why probably a lot of the stuff you write about in your blog</p>
<p>probably will remain true.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a flip side of the coin.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>Like, investing and understanding people</p>
<p>is like learning Unix in 1970.</p>
<p>Because nothing has changed, right?</p>
<p>All those things you&rsquo;ve learned about people</p>
<p>will still be valid 34 years from now.</p>
<p>Whereas if you learn the latest JavaScript framework,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be good for like two years, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But if you look at the future of programming,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a people component, but there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>the technology itself.</p>
<p>What do you see as the future of programming?</p>
<p>Will it change significantly, or as far as you can tell,</p>
<p>people are ultimately programming,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s not something that you foresee changing</p>
<p>in any fundamental way?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve got to go look back on sort</p>
<p>of the basics of programming.</p>
<p>And one of things that always shocked me</p>
<p>is like source control.</p>
<p>Like, I didn&rsquo;t learn anything about source control.</p>
<p>Granted, I graduated from college in 1992.</p>
<p>But I remember hearing from people as late as like 1998,</p>
<p>1999, like even maybe today, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not learning source control.</p>
<p>And to me, it&rsquo;s like, well, how can you not</p>
<p>learn source control?</p>
<p>That is so fundamental to working with other programmers,</p>
<p>working in a way that you don&rsquo;t lose your work.</p>
<p>Just basic software, the literal bedrock of software</p>
<p>development is source control.</p>
<p>Now, you compare it today, like GitHub, right?</p>
<p>Like Microsoft bought GitHub, which</p>
<p>I think was an incredibly smart acquisition move</p>
<p>on their part.</p>
<p>Now they have anybody who wants reasonable source control</p>
<p>to go sign up on GitHub.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all set up for you, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tons of walkthroughs, tons of tutorials.</p>
<p>So from the concept of like, has programming</p>
<p>advanced from, say, 1999, it&rsquo;s like, well, hell, we have GitHub.</p>
<p>I mean, my god, yes, right?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s massively advanced over what it was.</p>
<p>Now, as to whether programming is significantly different,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say no.</p>
<p>But I think the baseline of what we view as fundamentals</p>
<p>will continue to go up and actually get better,</p>
<p>like source control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the fundamentals that has gotten hundreds</p>
<p>of orders of magnitude better than it was 10, 20 years ago.</p>
<p>So those are the fundamentals.</p>
<p>Let me introduce two things that maybe you can comment on.</p>
<p>So one is mobile phones.</p>
<p>So that could fundamentally transform what programming is,</p>
<p>or maybe not.</p>
<p>Maybe you can comment on that.</p>
<p>And the other one is artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>which promises to, in some ways, to do</p>
<p>some of the programming for you is one way to think about it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really what a programmer is,</p>
<p>is using the intelligence that&rsquo;s inside your skull</p>
<p>to do something useful.</p>
<p>The hope with artificial intelligence</p>
<p>is that it does some of the useful parts for you</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have to think about it.</p>
<p>So do you see smartphones, the fact that everybody has one,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting more and more powerful as potentially</p>
<p>changing programming?</p>
<p>And do you see AI as potentially changing programming?</p>
<p>OK, so that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>So smartphones have definitely changed.</p>
<p>I mean, since, I guess, 2010 is when they really</p>
<p>started getting super popular.</p>
<p>I mean, in the last eight years, the world</p>
<p>has literally changed, right?</p>
<p>Everybody carries a computer around, and that&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>I mean, that is such a huge change in society.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re still dealing with a lot</p>
<p>of the positive and negative ramifications of that, right?</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s connected all the time.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s on the computer all the time.</p>
<p>That was my dream world as a geek, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, be careful what you ask for, right?</p>
<p>Like, wow, now everybody has a computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite the utopia that we thought it would be, right?</p>
<p>Computers can be used for a lot of stuff that&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>great.</p>
<p>So to me, that&rsquo;s the central focus of the smartphone,</p>
<p>is just that it puts a computer in front of everyone.</p>
<p>Granted, a small, touch screen, smallish,</p>
<p>touch screen computer.</p>
<p>But as for programming, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;ve kind of, over time,</p>
<p>come to subscribe to the Unix view of the world</p>
<p>when it comes to programming.</p>
<p>You want to teach these basic command line things,</p>
<p>and that is just what programming</p>
<p>is going to be for, I think, a long, long time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any magical visual programming</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, over time, have become a believer in that Unix</p>
<p>philosophy of just, you know, they kind of had</p>
<p>to write with Unix.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be the way it is for a long, long time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll continue to, like I said, raise the baseline.</p>
<p>The tools will get better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll get simpler.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still fundamentally going</p>
<p>to be command line tools, fancy IDEs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of it for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not seeing any visual programming stuff</p>
<p>on the horizon.</p>
<p>Because you kind of think, like, what</p>
<p>do you do on a smartphone that will be directly</p>
<p>analogous to programming?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m trying to think, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s really not much.</p>
<p>So not necessarily analogous to programming,</p>
<p>but the kind of things that, the kind of programs</p>
<p>you would need to write might need to be very different.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the kind of languages.</p>
<p>I mean, but I probably also subscribe to the same,</p>
<p>just because everything in this world</p>
<p>might be written in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s already happening.</p>
<p>I mean, discourse is a bet.</p>
<p>Discourse itself, JavaScript, is another bet</p>
<p>on that side of the table.</p>
<p>And I still try and believe in that.</p>
<p>So I would say smartphones have mostly a cultural shift more</p>
<p>than a programming shift.</p>
<p>Now, your other question was about artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and sort of devices predicting what you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>And I do think there&rsquo;s some strength to that.</p>
<p>I think artificial intelligence is kind of overselling it</p>
<p>in terms of what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like, people are predictable, right?</p>
<p>People do the same things.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>One check we put in a discourse that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been a lot of big commercial websites is,</p>
<p>say you log in from New York City now.</p>
<p>And then an hour later, you log in from San Francisco.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, hmm, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>How did you get from New York to San Francisco in one hour?</p>
<p>So at that point, you&rsquo;re like, OK, this</p>
<p>is a suspicious login at that point.</p>
<p>So we would alert you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, OK.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not AI, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a heuristic of like, how did you, in one hour,</p>
<p>get 2,000 miles, right?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re grand.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re on a VPN.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other ways to happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a basic prediction based on the idea</p>
<p>that people pretty much don&rsquo;t move around that much.</p>
<p>They may travel occasionally.</p>
<p>But nobody, unless you&rsquo;re a traveling salesman that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally traveling the world every day,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much repetition and predictability</p>
<p>in terms of things you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>And I think good software anticipates your needs.</p>
<p>For example, Google, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called Google Now or whatever that Google thing is</p>
<p>that predicts your commute and predicts,</p>
<p>based on your phone location, where are you every day?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s probably where you work, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I do think computers can get a lot better at that.</p>
<p>I hesitate to call it full blown AI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just computers getting better at like, first of all,</p>
<p>they have a ton of data because everybody has a smartphone.</p>
<p>Now, all of a sudden, we have all this data</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t have before about location,</p>
<p>about communication, and feeding that into some basic heuristics</p>
<p>and maybe some fancy algorithms that turn it</p>
<p>into predictions of anticipating your needs,</p>
<p>like a friend would, right?</p>
<p>Like, oh, hey, I see your home.</p>
<p>Would you like some dinner, right?</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s go get some food, because that&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>what we do at this time of day, right?</p>
<p>In the context of actually the act of programming,</p>
<p>do you see IDEs improving and making</p>
<p>the life of programming as better?</p>
<p>I do think that is possible, because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of repetition in programming, right?</p>
<p>Oh, you know, Clippy would be the bad example of, oh, I see.</p>
<p>It looks like you&rsquo;re writing a for loop.</p>
<p>But there are patterns in code, right?</p>
<p>And actually, libraries are kind of like that, right?</p>
<p>Rather than go code up your own HTTP request library,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, you&rsquo;d use one of the existing ones</p>
<p>that we have.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s already a troubleshot, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not AI, per se.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just building better LEGO bricks, bigger LEGO bricks,</p>
<p>that have more functionality in them,</p>
<p>so people don&rsquo;t have to worry about the low level</p>
<p>stuff as much anymore.</p>
<p>Like, WordPress, for example, to me,</p>
<p>is like a tool for somebody who isn&rsquo;t a programmer</p>
<p>to do something.</p>
<p>I mean, you can turn WordPress into anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of crazy, actually, through plugins, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not programming, per se.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just LEGO bricks stacking WordPress elements, right?</p>
<p>And a little bit of configuration glue.</p>
<p>So I would say, maybe in a broader sense, what I&rsquo;m seeing,</p>
<p>like, there&rsquo;ll be more gluing and less actual programming.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good thing, right?</p>
<p>Because most of the stuff you need</p>
<p>is kind of out there already.</p>
<p>You said 1970s, Unix.</p>
<p>Do you see PHP and these kind of old remnants</p>
<p>of the early birth of programming</p>
<p>remaining with us for a long time?</p>
<p>Like you said, Unix in itself.</p>
<p>Do you see, ultimately, this stuff just being there</p>
<p>out of momentum?</p>
<p>I kind of do.</p>
<p>I mean, I was a big believer in Windows early on.</p>
<p>And I was a big, you know, I was like,</p>
<p>Unix, what a waste of time.</p>
<p>But over time, I&rsquo;ve completely flipped on that,</p>
<p>where I was like, okay, the Unix guys were right.</p>
<p>And pretty much Microsoft and Windows were kind of wrong,</p>
<p>at least on the server side.</p>
<p>Now, on the desktop, right, you need a GUI,</p>
<p>you need all that stuff.</p>
<p>And you have the two philosophies,</p>
<p>like Apple built on Unix, effectively, Darwin.</p>
<p>And on the desktop, it&rsquo;s a slightly different story.</p>
<p>But on the server side, where you&rsquo;re gonna be programming.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s a question of where the programming&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a lot more like client side programming,</p>
<p>because technically, discourse is client side programming.</p>
<p>The way you get discourse,</p>
<p>we deliver a big ball of JavaScript,</p>
<p>which is then executed locally.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re really using a lot more local computing power.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll still retrieve the data, obviously,</p>
<p>we have to display the posts on the screen and so forth.</p>
<p>But in terms of like sorting and a lot of the basic stuff,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re using the host processor.</p>
<p>But to the extent that a lot of programming</p>
<p>is still gonna be server side, I would say, yeah,</p>
<p>the Unix philosophy definitely won.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ll be different veneers over Unix,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still, if you peel away one or two layers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be Unixy for a long, I think Unix won.</p>
<p>I mean, so definitively.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to hear you say that,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve done so much excellent work</p>
<p>on the Microsoft side in terms of backend development.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the future hold for Jeff Atwood?</p>
<p>I mean, the discourse, continuing the discourse</p>
<p>in trying to improve conversation on the web?</p>
<p>Well, discourse is what I&rsquo;ve viewed as a,</p>
<p>and originally I called it a five year project,</p>
<p>then really quickly revised that to a 10 year project.</p>
<p>So we started in early 2013,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when we launched the first version.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re still five years in.</p>
<p>This is the part where it starts getting good.</p>
<p>Like we have a good product now.</p>
<p>Discourse, there&rsquo;s any project you build in software,</p>
<p>it takes three years to build what you want it</p>
<p>to build anyway.</p>
<p>Like V1 is gonna be terrible, which it was.</p>
<p>But you ship it anyway,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how you get better at stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about turning the crank.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about V1 being perfect,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about V1, then let&rsquo;s get really good at V1.1,</p>
<p>1.2, 1.3, like how fast can we iterate?</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re iterating like crazy on discourse,</p>
<p>to the point that like, it&rsquo;s a really good product now.</p>
<p>We have serious momentum.</p>
<p>And my original vision was,</p>
<p>I wanna be the WordPress of discussion.</p>
<p>Meaning someone came to you and said,</p>
<p>I wanna start a blog.</p>
<p>Although the very question is kind of archaic now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, who actually blogs anymore?</p>
<p>But I wanted the answer to that to be,</p>
<p>it would be WordPress normally,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the obvious choice</p>
<p>for blogging most of the time.</p>
<p>But if someone said, hey, I need a group of people</p>
<p>to get together and do something,</p>
<p>the answer should be discourse, right?</p>
<p>That should be the default answer for people.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s open source, it&rsquo;s free,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t cost you anything.</p>
<p>You control it, you can run it.</p>
<p>Your minimum server cost for discourse</p>
<p>is five bucks a month at this point.</p>
<p>They actually got the VPS prices down.</p>
<p>It used to be $10 a month for one gigabyte of RAM,</p>
<p>which we have a kind of heavy stack.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff in discourse.</p>
<p>You need Postgres, you need Redis, you need Ruby,</p>
<p>and Rails, you need a sidekick for scheduling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a trivial amount of stuff</p>
<p>because we were architected for like,</p>
<p>look, we&rsquo;re building for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about shared PHP hosting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my model.</p>
<p>My idea is like, hey, eventually,</p>
<p>this is gonna be very cheap for everybody</p>
<p>and I wanna build it right.</p>
<p>Using again, higher, bigger building block levels, right?</p>
<p>That have more requirements.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a WordPress model of WordPress.org,</p>
<p>WordPress.com.</p>
<p>Is there a central hosting for discourse or no?</p>
<p>There is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not strictly segmenting into the open source</p>
<p>versus the commercial side.</p>
<p>We have a hosting business.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how discourse makes money</p>
<p>is we host discourse instances</p>
<p>and we have really close relationship with our customers</p>
<p>of the symbiosis of them giving us feedback on the product.</p>
<p>We definitely wait feedback from customers</p>
<p>a lot heavier than feedback from somebody</p>
<p>who just wanders by and gives feedback.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s where we make all our money.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t have a strict division.</p>
<p>We encourage people to use discourse.</p>
<p>Like the whole point is that it&rsquo;s free, right?</p>
<p>Anybody can set it up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be the only person that hosts discourse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely not the goal.</p>
<p>But it is a primary way for us to build a business</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually kind of a great business.</p>
<p>I mean, the business is going really, really well</p>
<p>in terms of hosting.</p>
<p>So I used to work at Google Research.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a company that&rsquo;s basically funded on advertisements.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s Facebook.</p>
<p>Let me ask if you can comment on it.</p>
<p>I think advertisement is best.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d be extremely critical on what ads are</p>
<p>but at its best, it&rsquo;s actually serving you.</p>
<p>In a sense, it&rsquo;s giving you, it&rsquo;s connecting you</p>
<p>to what you would want to explore.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like related posts or related content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same, that&rsquo;s the best of advertisement.</p>
<p>So discourse is connecting people based on their interests.</p>
<p>It seems like a place where advertisement at its best</p>
<p>could actually serve the users.</p>
<p>Is that something that you&rsquo;re considering thinking about</p>
<p>as a way to bring, to financially support the platform?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting because I actually have</p>
<p>a contrarian view of advertising,</p>
<p>which I kind of agree with you.</p>
<p>I recently installed AdBlocker reluctantly</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t like to do that.</p>
<p>But the performance of the ads, man,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so heavy now and it&rsquo;s just crazy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like a performance argument</p>
<p>more than like, I actually am pro ads</p>
<p>and I have a contrarian viewpoint.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>If you do ads right, it&rsquo;s serving you stuff</p>
<p>you would be interested in anyway.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind that, that actually is kind of a good thing.</p>
<p>So plus I think it&rsquo;s rational to wanna support</p>
<p>the people that are doing this work</p>
<p>through seeing their ads.</p>
<p>But that said, I run AdBlock now,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t wanna do, but I was convinced</p>
<p>by all these articles, like 30, 40 megabytes of stuff</p>
<p>just to serve you ads.</p>
<p>Yeah, it feels like ads now are like the experts exchange</p>
<p>of whenever you start a stock overflow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit, it&rsquo;s overwhelming.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s so many companies in ad tech</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>Like you can do that, have you seen those logo charts</p>
<p>of like just the whole page?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t even see them, they&rsquo;re so small.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many companies in the space.</p>
<p>But since you brought it up, I do wanna point out</p>
<p>that very, very few discourse sites actually run</p>
<p>using an ad supported model.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not effective.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s too diluted, it&rsquo;s too weird,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t pay well, and like users hate it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a combination of like users hate it,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t actually work that well in practice.</p>
<p>Like in theory, yes, I agree with you.</p>
<p>If you had clean, fast ads that were exactly</p>
<p>the stuff you would be interested in, awesome.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so far from that though, right?</p>
<p>Like, and Google does an okay job.</p>
<p>They do retargeting and stuff like that,</p>
<p>but in the real world, discourse sites</p>
<p>rarely can make ads work.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t work for so many reasons.</p>
<p>But you know what does work is subscriptions,</p>
<p>Patreon, affiliate codes for like Amazon,</p>
<p>of like just, oh, here&rsquo;s a cool yo yo, click,</p>
<p>and then you click and go to Amazon,</p>
<p>they get a small percentage of that,</p>
<p>which is fair, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, because you saw the yo yo on that site</p>
<p>and you clicked through and you bought it, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair for them to get 5% of that</p>
<p>or 2% of that, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Those things definitely work.</p>
<p>In fact, a site that I used to participate on a lot,</p>
<p>I helped the owner.</p>
<p>One of the things, I got them to switch to discourse.</p>
<p>I basically paid them to switch to discourse</p>
<p>because I was like, look, you guys got to switch.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t come here anymore on this terrible software.</p>
<p>But I was like, look, and on top of that,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re serving people ads that they hate.</p>
<p>Like you should just go full on Patreon</p>
<p>because he had a little bit of Patreon.</p>
<p>Go full on Patreon, do the Amazon affiliates thing</p>
<p>for any Amazon links that get posted and just do that</p>
<p>and just triple down on that stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s worked really well for them</p>
<p>and this creator in particular.</p>
<p>So that stuff works, but traditional ads,</p>
<p>I mean, definitely not working, at least on discourse.</p>
<p>So last question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve created the code keyboard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve programmed most of my adult life on a Kinesis keyboard.</p>
<p>I have one upstairs now.</p>
<p>Can you describe what a mechanical keyboard is</p>
<p>and why is it something that makes you happy?</p>
<p>Well, you know, this is another fetish item, really.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not required.</p>
<p>You can do programming on any kind of keyboard,</p>
<p>even like an onscreen keyboard.</p>
<p>Oh, god, that&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>But you could.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look back at the early days of computing,</p>
<p>there were chiclet keyboards, which are awful.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s a chiclet keyboard?</p>
<p>Oh, god.</p>
<p>OK, well, it&rsquo;s just like thin rubber membranes.</p>
<p>Oh, the rubber ones, oh, no.</p>
<p>Super bad, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a fetish item.</p>
<p>All that really says is, look, I care really about keyboards</p>
<p>because the keyboard is the primary method of communication</p>
<p>with the computer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just like having a nice mic for this podcast.</p>
<p>You want a nice keyboard, right?</p>
<p>Because it has a very tactile feel.</p>
<p>I can tell exactly when I press the key.</p>
<p>I get that little click.</p>
<p>So, oh, and it feels good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also kind of a fetish item.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wow, I care enough about programming</p>
<p>that I care about the tool, the primary tool,</p>
<p>that I use to communicate with the computer,</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s as good as it feels good to use for me.</p>
<p>And I can be very productive with it.</p>
<p>So to be honest, it&rsquo;s a little bit of a fetish item,</p>
<p>but a good one.</p>
<p>It indicates that you&rsquo;re serious.</p>
<p>It indicates you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
<p>It indicates that you care about the fundamentals.</p>
<p>Because you know what makes you a good programmer?</p>
<p>Being able to type really fast, right?</p>
<p>This is true, right?</p>
<p>So a core skill is just being able to type fast enough</p>
<p>to get your ideas out of your head into the code base.</p>
<p>So just practicing your typing can make you</p>
<p>a better programmer.</p>
<p>It is also something that makes you,</p>
<p>well, makes you enjoy typing, correct?</p>
<p>The actual act, something about the process.</p>
<p>Like I play piano.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tactile.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tactile feel that ultimately feeds the passion,</p>
<p>makes you happy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, totally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I mean, and it&rsquo;s funny because artisanal keyboards have</p>
<p>exploded.</p>
<p>Like Massdrop has gone ballistic with this stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably like 500 keyboard projects</p>
<p>on Massdrop alone.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some other guy I follow on Twitter.</p>
<p>I used to write for the site The Tech Report way</p>
<p>back in the day.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, every week he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>posting what I call keyboard porn of just cool keyboards.</p>
<p>Like, oh my god, those look really cool, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how many keyboards does this guy have, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like me with yo yos.</p>
<p>How many yo yos do you have?</p>
<p>How many do you need?</p>
<p>Well, technically one, but I like a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>So same thing with keyboards.</p>
<p>So yeah, they&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>Like, I highly recommend anybody that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a mechanical to research it, look into it,</p>
<p>and see what you like.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s ultimately a fetish item.</p>
<p>But I think these sort of items, these religious artifacts</p>
<p>that we have, are part of what make us human.</p>
<p>Like, that part&rsquo;s important, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of what makes life worth living.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessary in the strictest sense,</p>
<p>but ain&rsquo;t nothing necessary if you think about it, right?</p>
<p>Like, so yeah, why not?</p>
<p>So sure.</p>
<p>Jeff, thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
