    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History Addendum.</p>
<p>When I was designing this Hardcore History Addendum format, I knew that we were going</p>
<p>to want to do interviews.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good way for us to get out content quickly that&rsquo;s interesting and that it involves</p>
<p>other people, other voices, people that you might want to know more about.</p>
<p>And I knew that we would have authors on because there&rsquo;s always a lot of good people writing</p>
<p>intriguing books because I&rsquo;m reading them.</p>
<p>I knew we would want to have experts on from time to time because, after all, it&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>use of the medium, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>And I was hoping that we could get some primary source people on from time to time, participants</p>
<p>in the events that we were talking about.</p>
<p>In other words, you know, I&rsquo;m not a historian because historians chronicle, you know, things</p>
<p>for history and for footnotes and stuff and books, but maybe we could do a little bit</p>
<p>of that if we were interviewing people, you know, who were participants in these sorts</p>
<p>of events.</p>
<p>And today I have somebody that is sort of the trifecta of interviews for this program</p>
<p>because he meets all three of those specifications.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an author, he&rsquo;s an expert, and he&rsquo;s a primary source and participant.</p>
<p>His name is Merrill McPeak.</p>
<p>He happens to be a four-star Air Force general.</p>
<p>He flew with the Thunderbirds, the acrobatic team for the Air Force.</p>
<p>He is a commander, a chief of staff in the Air Force, and did so during the first Gulf</p>
<p>War, and he flew more than 250 combat missions in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Imagine that for a second.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a noted author who&rsquo;s got a brand new book out to add to his catalog of books.</p>
<p>His new book is called Roles and Missions, which goes over his time as the 14th Air Force</p>
<p>chief of staff.</p>
<p>By the way, sort of a bipartisan guy, worked for the Bob Dole Republican campaign, also</p>
<p>supported and was in the Barack Obama administration in terms of a military capacity.</p>
<p>He writes about his time in Vietnam in his book called Hangar Flying.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got another one called Below the Zone, another one called The Vietnam Chapters.</p>
<p>If you like military history, especially Air Force history, Merrill Tony McPeak is somebody</p>
<p>whose books should be on your bookshelf.</p>
<p>We talk to the four-star general now, who was nice enough to come and talk with us.</p>
<p>By the way, you may have recently seen him in Ken Burns&rsquo; recent multi-part documentary</p>
<p>on the Vietnam War as well.</p>
<p>Welcome to the show, General McPeak.</p>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s get started by suggesting, you know, the person we were contacting, your</p>
<p>publicist or whatever, was discussing the 50th year of the Tet Offensive.</p>
<p>When I was thinking about how to start this, I thought, you know, I grew up in that generation</p>
<p>where we weren&rsquo;t in the war.</p>
<p>We were in the early 80s, middle 80s.</p>
<p>We were the ones learning about the war in college, and the veterans would come and speak</p>
<p>in our classes.</p>
<p>I remember 60 Minutes did a whole big thing on how here we were studying the lessons of</p>
<p>Vietnam and what did we learn.</p>
<p>I thought, now here we are decades later, and I thought I would ask you, 50 years after</p>
<p>the Tet Offensive, what do you think we learned, and do you think the things we learned, for</p>
<p>example, by the 1970s or 1980s, do you think those lessons stuck?</p>
<p>Well, speaking as a professional military guy, we learned a lot in Vietnam.</p>
<p>We learned, for instance, just as an Air Force, just as a fighter pilot, we learned we had</p>
<p>to hit what we were aiming at.</p>
<p>You know, we missed most of the targets.</p>
<p>I think our average missed distance in Vietnam was like 100 meters, you know, and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not good enough if you&rsquo;re going after a target like a bridge or a rugged vehicle like a tank</p>
<p>or a truck.</p>
<p>So we invented precision-guided munitions, and you&rsquo;ve seen the results of that in the</p>
<p>years since.</p>
<p>We learned we had to be able to operate at night, and we now are‚Äînobody wants to fight</p>
<p>us at night nowadays.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to fight us in the daytime either, but we really dominate night fighting</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>We learned that we had to be invisible on radar, so we invented stealth aircraft.</p>
<p>So I mean, from the standpoint of the professional military, we learned a lot and we improved</p>
<p>a lot because the war lasted so long.</p>
<p>You know, 10-year war, all of us got to go there at least once.</p>
<p>We all saw what needed to be fixed, and we fixed it.</p>
<p>If you now ask what did we learn politically or socially, I think that by and large the</p>
<p>lessons were not learned at all, or if they were, they were forgotten.</p>
<p>We repeat the same mistakes, you know, war after war, it seems to me.</p>
<p>So technically we learned a lot, but big-picture-wise, I think we missed the boat.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m thinking about the concept in business of, like, institutional memory, right?</p>
<p>The idea is that, you know, you have the fact that the people can come and go in a large</p>
<p>corporation, but theoretically when new people come in, they&rsquo;re trained with the lessons</p>
<p>learned by the previous generation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about institutional memory in the military, so if you get a guy like William</p>
<p>Westmoreland, who&rsquo;s a Second World War veteran, knows how to fight that kind of war, has to</p>
<p>deal with this counterinsurgency situation in Vietnam, theoretically learns what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to learn there, but then Westmoreland retires, the people who were right below him</p>
<p>retire.</p>
<p>Is institutional memory in the military sphere a little like something like a bush in front</p>
<p>of your yard that you have to keep cut back because every generation comes up, we have</p>
<p>to relearn some of those same things?</p>
<p>Is there, you know, when you read, like, the Peloponnesian War and the stuff from ancient</p>
<p>Athens, there&rsquo;s the hubris element.</p>
<p>Is hubris something that a good punch in the nose can teach you permanently, or do you</p>
<p>need to be reminded every now and then?</p>
<p>I mean, I look at the dominance we have right now on the battlefield, and I worry that if</p>
<p>we got into a major conflict right now, we don&rsquo;t have anyone in the institutions at the</p>
<p>higher levels now that have fought, for example, in a real war against another First World</p>
<p>military.</p>
<p>Would they almost have to do, like, the reverse of what Westmoreland had to do, where he had</p>
<p>to learn to go from a World War II mentality to a counterinsurgency mentality?</p>
<p>If we ever had to fight China in some islands off, you know, in the East China Sea, is that</p>
<p>relearning a kind of warfare that Westmoreland understood, but we haven&rsquo;t done in so long,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know how to do anymore?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, that&rsquo;s a really long question.</p>
<p>Dan, but it&rsquo;s a wonderful question because, you know, you&rsquo;ve always heard that we practiced</p>
<p>to fight the last war, you know.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s even giving too much credit.</p>
<p>Look, your question is, are military organizations learning organizations that can benefit through</p>
<p>experience?</p>
<p>I think they are, but remember we fought Vietnam with a draft E force, conscripted army, and</p>
<p>it was only after that that Nixon was really forced to abandon the draft and to create</p>
<p>the all-volunteer force.</p>
<p>The all-volunteer force is a different kind of army from a citizen-based army.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s probably true that a professional force can be a learning organization, whereas</p>
<p>by and large, citizen-based armies are not, because they&rsquo;re constantly taking in new guys</p>
<p>for short term of service, and they have to, you know, train them from the beginning every</p>
<p>six months.</p>
<p>But look, it&rsquo;s a good question, it&rsquo;s a profound question, it goes back to the Peloponnesian</p>
<p>Wars or before that, as you say, and I&rsquo;m not sure, you know, that I have a totally</p>
<p>good answer to it.</p>
<p>I know that the army coming out of Vietnam was not happy with its performance, Westmoreland&rsquo;s</p>
<p>failures in particular, and guys like Norm Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell set about rebuilding</p>
<p>the culture of the army.</p>
<p>And the army we have today I think is considerably better than the one we had in Vietnam, which</p>
<p>was guilty of fragging its own officers and senior NCOs and drug abuse and other forms</p>
<p>of indiscipline on the front lines.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you see that kind of army anymore.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have to say I think that we did learn, you know, from that experience.</p>
<p>For me, the larger lessons, though, are the policy level lessons, the political lessons,</p>
<p>that there I see no evidence that we&rsquo;ve learned very much, and there I see that this ancient</p>
<p>Greek problem of hubris still around, you know, in space.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it seem like, and again, this may just be one person shooting an arrow and painting</p>
<p>a bullseye around it afterwards, but it seems to me that there&rsquo;s always this wonderful out,</p>
<p>that people who want to do something, like I want to invade Russia, and I&rsquo;m the Nazi</p>
<p>Wehrmacht and someone who comes up to me and says, well, you know, that didn&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>very well for Charles XII, didn&rsquo;t work out very well for Napoleon, but I want to invade</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>So I say, yes, but they didn&rsquo;t have the Luftwaffe, and they didn&rsquo;t have the Wehrmacht, therefore</p>
<p>those historical lessons from the past are not applicable.</p>
<p>And I feel like there&rsquo;s a human tendency to do that even now.</p>
<p>For example, to say, if our military today went and rethought the Vietnam War in the</p>
<p>21st century, we could do that and we could win because of all this stuff we have that</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have back then.</p>
<p>In other words, we can go into Afghanistan and it won&rsquo;t be the graveyard of empires because</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have smart bombs in those old days.</p>
<p>Do you think that there&rsquo;s any validity to that way of thinking?</p>
<p>Is that a little bit of a human nature sort of thing, or is there something you can do</p>
<p>institutionally that says, listen, this is how human beings behave, so let&rsquo;s insulate</p>
<p>ourselves from that typical human tendency?</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah, it does.</p>
<p>There is an element of Shakespearean tragedy to all this.</p>
<p>I mean, man is a failed creature, right?</p>
<p>And so you see these foibles pop up time and again.</p>
<p>I will say this, Dan.</p>
<p>I think the professional military, especially at the senior level, are reluctant fighters.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s been my experience.</p>
<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t know George Patton, but by and large, from my experience in the JCS and at</p>
<p>senior Washington levels, there&rsquo;s nobody looking for a fight there.</p>
<p>Their advice uniformly has been slow down.</p>
<p>It really didn&rsquo;t work for Napoleon.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s on the civilian side.</p>
<p>In the case of the Middle East, the problems that we&rsquo;re having still today, the neocons,</p>
<p>the guys who had never worn a uniform.</p>
<p>Rick Cheney had seven excuses for not going to Vietnam, and the people around him at those</p>
<p>levels were anxious to go back and do Iraq again, to really get Saddam Hussein this time.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t military.</p>
<p>Those were political people.</p>
<p>And so the hubris that I have seen has been wearing dark blue suits, not uniforms.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I had met General Mattis once, and he had basically said something similar.</p>
<p>He was very cognizant of the limitations of military power when I was talking to him.</p>
<p>So then let me ask you this, then.</p>
<p>It seems to me that there&rsquo;s an institutional bias in this country, and it&rsquo;s a human thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame anyone against, let&rsquo;s call it the can&rsquo;t-do general as opposed to the can-do</p>
<p>general.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re talking about the 50th anniversary of Tet and we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>Vietnam and Johnson or Nixon brings in a couple of military advisors, and out of the</p>
<p>five of them, four of them say, of course we can win this war.</p>
<p>Let me tell you how to do it.</p>
<p>Put me in charge and I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>And one guy says, no, no, no, you&rsquo;re not going to win this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure out a way to get out of here with honor.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a natural tendency to say, listen, the can&rsquo;t-do guy, I&rsquo;m not going to go with</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go with somebody who tells me he can get it done.</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t there a sense in the military of, I don&rsquo;t want to be the guy that says we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be thought of as the guy who says this is unwinnable.</p>
<p>Of course, you put me in charge and I&rsquo;ll get it done.</p>
<p>Seems to me that it&rsquo;s tough for someone to stand up in that sort of situation and say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not do this.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t be successful.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be prudent.</p>
<p>Does that have any, when you&rsquo;re talking about the institutional failures with the people</p>
<p>who wear suits, is that a problem that they&rsquo;re going to run into?</p>
<p>You know, Dan, again, you put a very deep question to me here, but let me just say that</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t the way I have seen the problem formulated during my time in Washington.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure this changes as the cast of characters changes in Washington, but typically</p>
<p>the president doesn&rsquo;t ask advice of five guys and four of them say, yeah, I can do it.</p>
<p>One says, no.</p>
<p>What the president says is, hey, we&rsquo;ve got a problem here.</p>
<p>What are my options?</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not looking for a yes, no answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a binary problem.</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s looking for is, you know, give me a half a dozen things I might do here.</p>
<p>Tell me the pros and the cons of each thing and let me make a decision.</p>
<p>So in that case, if you&rsquo;re opposed to taking a military action, you just put it in the</p>
<p>cons.</p>
<p>You say, here&rsquo;s the cons.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re going to lose friends around the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to lose international standing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to dry up or whatever.</p>
<p>You can put any con in you want, but the proper approach from the military advisor standpoint</p>
<p>is to say, OK, if you want to do this, here are a set of options and the pluses and minuses</p>
<p>that go with them, and then it&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little different formulation than the one you put.</p>
<p>OK, so if you&rsquo;re the military advisor and you&rsquo;ve been in a role of you&rsquo;ve been a chief</p>
<p>of staff before you, you&rsquo;ve been the Air Force four star general here, I mean, if somebody</p>
<p>comes to you, the president, I need your advice on this.</p>
<p>And he says something to the effect of, oh, God, I&rsquo;m losing my train of thought, General.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting old now.</p>
<p>Fifty two.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a little old.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m getting there, aging quickly.</p>
<p>If.</p>
<p>OK, here&rsquo;s what I wanted to get with that.</p>
<p>So the old line about the Vietnam War was the political nature of the president, for</p>
<p>example, operating as a person who&rsquo;s picking tactical targets for aircraft to bomb.</p>
<p>And yet the old argument that we learned back in military history class for why that might</p>
<p>have been necessary was the president&rsquo;s got to worry about Soviet involvement, the threats</p>
<p>of nuclear war, other things happening, including maybe funding the very people you&rsquo;re fighting</p>
<p>at a higher level to compensate.</p>
<p>Whereas the guys on the ground, the military leaders are worried about, OK, how do I get</p>
<p>victory in this theater of operations?</p>
<p>What is the proper balance in your mind between a president who&rsquo;s got to worry about the grand</p>
<p>strategy across the world and the general who&rsquo;s got to say, listen, if you just take</p>
<p>your hands off of me, I&rsquo;ll win this theater for you.</p>
<p>How do you see the balance of the general says, you know, General McPeak, if the president</p>
<p>says, General McPeak, help me out here.</p>
<p>What do you tell them to do vis-a-vis allowing generals to have a free hand versus a Lyndon</p>
<p>Johnson who&rsquo;s maybe more worried about the Soviet Union than he is about making sure</p>
<p>no more resupply ships get into Haiphong Harbor?</p>
<p>Well, this is a problem which is at the heart of limited warfare.</p>
<p>If for instance, you asked Kurt LeMay what to do about Vietnam, he would say bomb them</p>
<p>back into the Stone Age.</p>
<p>In fact, he did say that.</p>
<p>And we could have won.</p>
<p>I mean, had we nuked Hanoi, the war would have been over, right?</p>
<p>So the war was always winnable.</p>
<p>It was just a question of how limited are the means you want to use here.</p>
<p>So you go to the president and say, okay, I&rsquo;m assuming you don&rsquo;t want to use nuclear</p>
<p>weapons.</p>
<p>I mean, we have an instance case right now that&rsquo;s very relevant, North Korea.</p>
<p>So if we seek to intervene in North Korea, the first question we should ask ourselves</p>
<p>is, is this a limited war?</p>
<p>Are the means we&rsquo;re going to use limited?</p>
<p>Not just the means, do we have a limited amount of time?</p>
<p>Are you going to put a limit on the amount of money we&rsquo;re going to spend here?</p>
<p>So you have to decide all of the boundaries of the limitations you&rsquo;re going to put on</p>
<p>warfare.</p>
<p>And then that has to be bought by the president.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to tell President Johnson, okay, if I have to worry more about the Soviet</p>
<p>Union than I do winning, in quotes, in South Vietnam, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Just tell me that.</p>
<p>And that means I can&rsquo;t mine Hanoi Harbor and blow up some Soviet boat.</p>
<p>Now are you willing to live with that?</p>
<p>So the president has to understand the nature of the war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be limited.</p>
<p>And that means we may or may not win.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s unlimited, I know we can beat North Vietnam or North Korea anytime.</p>
<p>So the first question you have to ask are, what limitations are you going to put on me?</p>
<p>So we understand all that.</p>
<p>Now, typically today, we don&rsquo;t talk in terms of limited war.</p>
<p>We talk in terms of rules of engagement.</p>
<p>What rules of engagement is the president or the secretary of defense or the theater</p>
<p>commander or whatever going to impose on operations?</p>
<p>And we need to be eyes wide open about that up front.</p>
<p>Now inside the rules of engagement, I would argue you ought to give the military guy as</p>
<p>much flexibility as possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want the president picking targets in the basement of the White House, you know,</p>
<p>because he doesn&rsquo;t know much about targeting.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s going to pick the wrong targets, or he&rsquo;s going to tell me to attack them from</p>
<p>the wrong direction, or he&rsquo;s going to tell me to use the wrong munitions, or he&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to tell me to send too few airplanes or too many airplanes.</p>
<p>Those are questions that he knows very little about.</p>
<p>And what he needs to do is impose rules of engagement, tell me what the limitations are,</p>
<p>and leave me alone.</p>
<p>And then as long as I operate inside the limitations, he should never have any kind of a quibble</p>
<p>or complaint about how I&rsquo;m doing and what the result is or the consequence.</p>
<p>You know, the fact is we never lost a battle in Vietnam.</p>
<p>We just lost the war.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a big fan of Westmoreland.</p>
<p>I regard him as rather dumb.</p>
<p>I mean, what he tried to do was stupid, in my opinion.</p>
<p>And not much improved when he was succeeded by Abrams, although there&rsquo;s a big school of</p>
<p>thought that says Abrams was a much more talented officer and we were on the right track once</p>
<p>we got rid of Westmoreland.</p>
<p>But in any case, you know, the point is that there are things that politicians are expert</p>
<p>in and there are things that professional military are expert in.</p>
<p>And we need to understand who does what here.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re picking targets in the basement of the White House, you&rsquo;re on the wrong track</p>
<p>and you are going to lose, in my opinion, because you got the wrong guy doing the wrong</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about on the right track.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a key point.</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m watching Ken Burns&rsquo; Vietnam documentary, one of the things that just screams at you</p>
<p>I was reminded once again of the veterans coming into the class I was in in the 1980s</p>
<p>screams at you is that you don&rsquo;t have any real way of determining how you&rsquo;re doing at</p>
<p>any given time.</p>
<p>I mean, the classic way that was used was body count.</p>
<p>But we understand that if you don&rsquo;t have body counts, it&rsquo;s even with how do you measure</p>
<p>progress in a way that&rsquo;s helpful to the heads of the military, the political heads and the</p>
<p>population as a whole?</p>
<p>And we could apply this to the situation in the Middle East, for example, right now.</p>
<p>I mean, how do you gauge progress?</p>
<p>And if progress isn&rsquo;t going the way you want, do you double down on the efforts or do you</p>
<p>determine that maybe I mean, are we even capable of cutting loose?</p>
<p>Was there ever another choice in Vietnam?</p>
<p>We act like we could have just said, listen, we&rsquo;re losing the war, so let&rsquo;s get out.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t the most difficult thing in the world to disengage from combat with an enemy</p>
<p>strategic level or tactical level?</p>
<p>So I guess what I&rsquo;m asking is, how do you gauge progress, whether or not you&rsquo;re winning</p>
<p>or losing?</p>
<p>And then do you notice if it&rsquo;s not in your interest to notice that you&rsquo;re, for example,</p>
<p>not winning?</p>
<p>You know, can you get because in this Vietnam War, you&rsquo;re looking at these people that just</p>
<p>seem in retrospect, they look like they know the war is over, but they can&rsquo;t say it.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t prove it.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t they can&rsquo;t operate or do anything about it.</p>
<p>They seem frozen in the condition.</p>
<p>So there seems to me to be a real need to be able to measure progress and then have</p>
<p>some sort of reaction to the data you&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>Can you can you suggest a way maybe we could do that in the Middle East right now?</p>
<p>And if we decided it wasn&rsquo;t going well, what do you do then?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the crux of the issue, right?</p>
<p>Are we winning or losing?</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re winning or losing, what do you do about it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going well in the Middle East, just to get quickly to the answer.</p>
<p>But, you know, there used to be a way of judging that was pretty easy, and that is territory.</p>
<p>You won if if you prevailed, if you held the battlefield at the end and the other guy left,</p>
<p>you were winning.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So Churchill could be very worried about what was going on in North Africa because Rommel</p>
<p>pushed all the way to Alamein, you know, he was inside Egypt, right?</p>
<p>So Cairo and the Suez Canal was threatened because the geography told Churchill that</p>
<p>he was losing.</p>
<p>So he replaced whoever it was with Montgomery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so in a linear war where armies face each other, you can tell who&rsquo;s winning by</p>
<p>where the front line is and what direction it&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>Or at least that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one gross approximation.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re fighting in Gettysburg, you&rsquo;re not in good shape.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>OK, so you&rsquo;ve got to be fighting in Chancellorsville or someplace down south.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not so easy anymore with stateless actors like ISIS or, you know, suicide bombers.</p>
<p>How can you tell if you&rsquo;re winning?</p>
<p>I mean, the guy doesn&rsquo;t have any territory to capture.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have a national treasury that you can loot.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t even really have a life worth living, otherwise he wouldn&rsquo;t be in the suicide bombing</p>
<p>business.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t even care about his own life.</p>
<p>So in this in this kind of war, how do you judge where you are?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have a ready answer to that.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s there if we had a sort of an index of violence, you&rsquo;d say, well, the</p>
<p>violence is down and we kind of have that.</p>
<p>But in Afghanistan now, we have the Taliban bombing again inside Kabul, right?</p>
<p>And so the number you can plot the number of incidents on a graph and say, well, there</p>
<p>are more incidents this month than there were last month.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not doing very well.</p>
<p>And in fact, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing in the Middle East now, sort of subjectively.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t you know, I don&rsquo;t have a chart in my office that I keep track of this specifically.</p>
<p>But it seems to me I have the sense that we&rsquo;re not doing very well in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>And you know, I don&rsquo;t know how to come unstuck from it.</p>
<p>This is a tar baby kind of deal where you say, gee, I wish I could figure out how to</p>
<p>get out of here with my pride and, you know, reputation and shape.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a way to do it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re kind of stuck to the problem in the Middle East and who knows how to judge whether</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing better or poorer than we were, you know, a month ago, a year ago, five years</p>
<p>ago.</p>
<p>Hard to say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just you know, it&rsquo;s funny you say that.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting that answer because it leads you to the next question, which is if</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t figure out how you&rsquo;re doing and if you really don&rsquo;t have any options, if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>totally stuck.</p>
<p>You know, I remember being told a long time ago by my stepfather who was trying to explain</p>
<p>to me that the wide range of presidential actions that I always assumed was possible</p>
<p>was a myth and that when you actually got into the office, it was really much more constrained</p>
<p>by what your predecessor left you, a bunch of other things like, you know, I can&rsquo;t fight</p>
<p>the Vietnam War the way I want because the Soviet Union might get involved.</p>
<p>When you look at the current, let&rsquo;s call it the war on terror situation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>I mean, how do you get out of that when I mean, you know, the old the old equation,</p>
<p>which is it costs these elements that we&rsquo;re fighting pennies on the dollar compared to</p>
<p>what it costs for us to counter them.</p>
<p>I mean, the long term graphing out of that situation looks horrible.</p>
<p>If you know, I feel like we could be doing a documentary with Ken Burns, 150 year old</p>
<p>Ken Burns, years from now having the same conversation about the current situation we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in in the war on terror that I just saw the other night when I was watching the Vietnam</p>
<p>War documentary.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s the case, you know, you get this feeling like deja vu all over again or</p>
<p>a train wreck that you&rsquo;ve seen before and that it&rsquo;s happening in slow motion.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re finding out exactly how limited the people in the late 60s were in terms of</p>
<p>their options.</p>
<p>Does it feel like that to you at all or does it seem like because the context of the Cold</p>
<p>War and all that is so different.</p>
<p>How similar to you would you feel if you were a president in office in Lyndon Baines Johnson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>chair versus Donald Trump&rsquo;s chair?</p>
<p>Oh, boy, don&rsquo;t ask me that one.</p>
<p>OK, we can go back and it makes it easier this look.</p>
<p>A key issue is how do you define victory?</p>
<p>Another way of saying that or what are what&rsquo;s our purpose here, what&rsquo;s our goal?</p>
<p>If you tell me what our purpose is in the Middle East, I&rsquo;ll tell you how we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You tell me how to define victory in the Middle East and I&rsquo;ll tell you whether we&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>10 yard line, the 15 yard line, the 50 yard line where we are.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t recall anybody ever saying, here&rsquo;s our objective.</p>
<p>You know, here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s how we would define victory.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have a definition of victory, then you don&rsquo;t know when to quit or when to</p>
<p>retire or how to get out.</p>
<p>You know, because you can&rsquo;t tell, you know, we we&rsquo;d like to I mean, George W.</p>
<p>Bush famously went on a aircraft carrier and stood under a sign that said mission</p>
<p>accomplished. Remember that?</p>
<p>That was how many years ago?</p>
<p>So at least 15, we&rsquo;re still in Iraq.</p>
<p>If our mission was accomplished when George W.</p>
<p>Bush went on that boat.</p>
<p>And declared victory, what the heck are we still doing in Iraq?</p>
<p>Well, then you get back to we get to the same question, though, about I mean, OK, is this</p>
<p>is everything we&rsquo;re facing now sort of a bit of blowback.</p>
<p>I mean, did did we stir up a hornet&rsquo;s nest and we&rsquo;re still dealing with individual</p>
<p>hornets? And it would have been better had we left, you know, the Hornet in chief, Saddam</p>
<p>Hussein in charge, because at least we weren&rsquo;t the ones who had to pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess, you know, what amateur armchair historians like yours truly do, General,</p>
<p>as you almost certainly know, is we look at these and we try to find meaning from the</p>
<p>past, which is this this this horrible fool&rsquo;s game.</p>
<p>But but I mean, when you look at this, you go, I mean, you almost get to a point where</p>
<p>you say, would Saddam Hussein and the Middle East we had in 1991 be an applicable</p>
<p>trade that a modern politician would would trade today if they could get back to that?</p>
<p>Yes, in fact, I would have traded at the time I wrote op ed pieces and made</p>
<p>speeches against Iraq, too.</p>
<p>It drove me out of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>You know, I ended up supporting Obama in 2008.</p>
<p>I would in fact, I was the national co-chair of its presidential campaign.</p>
<p>And the issue for me was how badly that whole Iraq, too, thing had been handled,</p>
<p>including my buddy Colin Powell going in front of the General Assembly and making</p>
<p>outrageous claims, claims that I I thought I knew, in fact, at the time were wrong</p>
<p>about Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s having weapons of mass destruction or the other lies that</p>
<p>were told. You know, Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden were good buddies, baloney.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t any al Qaeda in Iraq as long as Saddam Hussein was alive.</p>
<p>They hated each other or that we would be welcomed as liberators.</p>
<p>You know, people would throw bouquets of roses as our guys going into Baghdad baloney, as</p>
<p>it turned out. So I said that at the time and, you know, a trillion dollars later and</p>
<p>thousands of lives later, we&rsquo;re stuck with an Iraq that is much worse than what it was</p>
<p>when Saddam Hussein was running it.</p>
<p>So, you know, the real issue here is what are our purposes?</p>
<p>How do we define victory?</p>
<p>What limitations are we going to put on our use of violence to achieve these purposes?</p>
<p>These are very deep questions, very hard questions to answer.</p>
<p>And and frankly, most most presidents need as much help as possible to get to these</p>
<p>answers. And they need help from, you know, wise and good military advisors, which I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they they always get.</p>
<p>Now, you know, we were just you were just talking a second ago about Colin Powell, respected</p>
<p>military authority, but using that authority as part of an effort to sell the American</p>
<p>people and the world on on a particular foreign policy move.</p>
<p>And it occurs to me, you know, one of the things that that watching the Ken Burns Vietnam</p>
<p>documentary really brings home is the context of what a different America it was back in</p>
<p>the days when Vietnam was first heating up the early 1960s.</p>
<p>I was born during the Yadrang battle.</p>
<p>I mean, so 1965, when things are really heating up with ground troops, the government at that</p>
<p>time was assumed to be telling the truth by just about everyone.</p>
<p>It was a black and white, good and evil world.</p>
<p>You know, I always tell young people when I&rsquo;m talking to them.</p>
<p>I always bring up the First World War and I talk about a generation of people that could</p>
<p>watch a unit in front of them step out of the trenches and go over the top and be machined</p>
<p>gun within 10 yards of the trench.</p>
<p>And then the next wave will do the same thing.</p>
<p>And I said, we wouldn&rsquo;t do that today in the same way that much of the stuff that a 1962</p>
<p>era American would have considered a truism would be met much more skeptically by a 21st</p>
<p>century American.</p>
<p>How much did the so-called credibility gap over several administrations in that era do</p>
<p>lasting the boy who cried wolf type damage to our government&rsquo;s ability to be trusted</p>
<p>with statements like how the war is going or anything else?</p>
<p>Did we sort of lose?</p>
<p>Did we lose our innocence?</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s a classic phrase from my 1980s Vietnam War military history class.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Well, I think in particular, the Pentagon Papers represented a sea change.</p>
<p>You know, after they were published in the New York Times and later in the Washington</p>
<p>Post, Americans came to understand that a succession of administrations, both Democrat</p>
<p>and Republican, had systematically lied to the American people.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that our country has ever been the same again.</p>
<p>The skepticism which that whole episode properly aroused has been with us ever since.</p>
<p>And frankly, it is a loss of innocence for us.</p>
<p>And if you look at our history, we were never a great power until after World War I.</p>
<p>So our experience on the world stage was pretty limited.</p>
<p>Maybe 50 years of experience as a real actor in international affairs.</p>
<p>And then finally, we woke up a bit.</p>
<p>We saw how that sort of thing happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that governments weren&rsquo;t cynical before.</p>
<p>I think the British government has been cynical, you know, for a long time.</p>
<p>But Americans were truly children of the frontier, you know, with a sort of</p>
<p>Western heritage, a frontier heritage.</p>
<p>And we wanted to believe that our government was telling us the truth.</p>
<p>But we learned in the Pentagon Papers that that&rsquo;s not so.</p>
<p>And ever since, we&rsquo;ve been, I think, properly skeptical.</p>
<p>Why do you, I guess the logical question is, why do you think they lied?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I think the tendency would be to blame some president from the opposite</p>
<p>political party and demonize them.</p>
<p>But as you said, this was a multi-administration effort to keep from the people who are supposed</p>
<p>to understand what&rsquo;s going on so they can be informed voters from really knowing what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on.</p>
<p>And it started with, you know, Eisenhower, even, but even to the end with Nixon and Christmas</p>
<p>bombings that were secret.</p>
<p>I mean, what was I guess, was it kept secret in your mind for for military reasons, or</p>
<p>was it kept secret because the reaction of the American people to their own policies</p>
<p>was what the government was worried about?</p>
<p>I think it was the latter.</p>
<p>Really, the government didn&rsquo;t, the president didn&rsquo;t want to be embarrassed.</p>
<p>Embarrassment is the worst possible, right, situation for a public figure.</p>
<p>And so the bombing of Cambodia, for instance, was secret from the American people.</p>
<p>It sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t secret from the Cambodians, you know, or the North Vietnamese.</p>
<p>Or the North Vietnamese army, which was using Cambodia for sanctuaries.</p>
<p>They knew all about it.</p>
<p>So secrecy, there wasn&rsquo;t a military necessity at all.</p>
<p>The enemy quite understood what was going on.</p>
<p>The secrecy was required to keep the American people in the dark.</p>
<p>And the only, you know, the only reason for that is the government would have been embarrassed</p>
<p>to admit what was going on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the worst possible reason to classify any information is to protect yourself from</p>
<p>embarrassment.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s exactly what was going on.</p>
<p>Do you think that the efforts of the media today are, I want to compare them to the media</p>
<p>efforts in Vietnam, which were, you know, so scrutinized and yet perhaps so influential</p>
<p>on what went on.</p>
<p>And I just, I&rsquo;m not even sure we&rsquo;re talking apples and oranges here in the ability to</p>
<p>compare them.</p>
<p>But how would you compare today&rsquo;s media coverage of America&rsquo;s conflicts and that, for example,</p>
<p>take 1967, 68, because it was very different in 62.</p>
<p>But how would you, how would you compare the media&rsquo;s job, how they cover with the restrictions,</p>
<p>by the way, that we understand?</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t have the same kind of ability to show this.</p>
<p>I mean, the combat footage that, not to change the subject, but the thing that rocked me</p>
<p>in Ken Burns&rsquo;s documentary the most, and I have no idea how he did it, is there&rsquo;s segments</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ll see 35 seconds in a row of footage that looks like it was shot yesterday, high</p>
<p>definition stuff.</p>
<p>And, you know, for people like me who&rsquo;ve seen a lot of that footage, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s computer enhanced or what.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re looking at what the media is able to show back then and the difference</p>
<p>in the coverage today, can you compare in your mind&rsquo;s eye the pros and cons of the way</p>
<p>we did it then and how we do it now?</p>
<p>The media coverage in Vietnam was by and large positive, in my opinion, except for</p>
<p>photo coverage.</p>
<p>You know, the impact of a photograph or today video is so much more pervasive or influential</p>
<p>or shocking.</p>
<p>You know, you got a photograph of a police general in Saigon shooting a guy in the head</p>
<p>or a very young girl running away from a village that&rsquo;s been napalmed with her skin on fire.</p>
<p>These pictures convey a message in a way that written journalism or broadcast journalism</p>
<p>cannot.</p>
<p>And they were very negative.</p>
<p>I mean, Buddhist monks, you know, emulating themselves in the streets of Saigon.</p>
<p>When you show that, you show it on television, it just is merciless in the message it conveys.</p>
<p>And so for my money, until Walter Cronkite came on CBS News and said, hey, we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>winning, guys, after Ted, the coverage was pretty universally supportive, the written</p>
<p>coverage.</p>
<p>But the photographic coverage just undermined everything that was being said in print.</p>
<p>Now, today it&rsquo;s the coverage is much more visual, much more video oriented and photo</p>
<p>oriented.</p>
<p>And so the bad news hits earlier, I think.</p>
<p>Because, you know, you don&rsquo;t see a photograph of ribbon cuttings as downtown Baghdad is</p>
<p>liberated.</p>
<p>You see these awful scenes of devastated towns that we&rsquo;re creating in the Middle East.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no getting around it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a large scale destructive mode there in the Middle East.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what people are seeing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not seeing any upside.</p>
<p>You know, you can talk about upside all you want and how well we&rsquo;re doing and so forth.</p>
<p>But what we are seeing is awful, the consequences of the combat there.</p>
<p>And so I think the coverage today is much more pessimistic and skeptical and even perhaps</p>
<p>cynical, but because they are showing, not just telling.</p>
<p>And from now on, I expect that&rsquo;s the way the coverage will be.</p>
<p>Because this, you know, younger generation is much more video oriented and won&rsquo;t read</p>
<p>the New York Times, watch it on, you know, on Facebook.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, it used to be Radio Free Europe trying to get a little teeny signal,</p>
<p>you know, over the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>Now, if we were fighting the North Vietnamese army, they would have a troll of people on</p>
<p>Twitter, you know, giving their side of the story or pretending to be Americans.</p>
<p>Complete with photographs taken with their eyes.</p>
<p>And maybe fake photographs.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly right.</p>
<p>Well, then let me ask you a little bit and not really changing subjects, but I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a four star general on here without mining you a little bit for some knowledge and wisdom</p>
<p>myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at Syria and I&rsquo;m looking, you had talked about, you know, in destructive</p>
<p>mode right now.</p>
<p>But to an armchair person like me, it looks like a terribly small theater to have that</p>
<p>many different forces operating in and us hoping to keep everything clean with no major</p>
<p>mistakes and whatnot.</p>
<p>You had talked about North Korea as well.</p>
<p>Can you talk to me a little about those two hot spots?</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s a third one you would add to the mix of places, we need to be careful right</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>Well, I think Korea is the most important and threatening problem that we face anywhere</p>
<p>in the world or have faced for a long time.</p>
<p>I really think we&rsquo;re up against a sort of a Cuban missile crisis.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been that long, you know, since we&rsquo;ve really looked down the barrel, gun barrel.</p>
<p>As far as Syria goes, it is an awfully small theater of operations, especially on the air</p>
<p>side.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about aircraft like the F-22 that supercruise.</p>
<p>In other words, they&rsquo;re supersonic, they&rsquo;re running around the sky at 1.7, 1.8 Mach all</p>
<p>the time.</p>
<p>And that makes Syria a pretty small country to even do a 180, do a 180 degree turn in,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>And the Russians are there sharing that airspace with us.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve so far been able to coordinate that air activity pretty well, even though</p>
<p>the Russians did lose a fighter to Turkish ground fire.</p>
<p>So, but the less, you know, we&rsquo;re running head to head against each other in a very</p>
<p>small airspace.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a tribute to the professionalism of our Air Force that we haven&rsquo;t already shot</p>
<p>down a few of those guys.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s terribly dangerous.</p>
<p>We could be any day involved in a head to head fight with Russian aircraft and where</p>
<p>that, you know, that&rsquo;s got the potential to escalate, to go anywhere.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it&rsquo;s less dangerous than the situation in North Korea, where we have</p>
<p>apparently a crazy guy in charge of a government that is, that does possess nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and is rapidly developing the capability, if it doesn&rsquo;t already have them, to deliver</p>
<p>those nuclear weapons against American cities.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an awful situation.</p>
<p>I think we can&rsquo;t allow that to continue.</p>
<p>I believe we must intervene and do something there.</p>
<p>Now, what should we do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in favor of using all the tools, you know, in the toolbox.</p>
<p>If you think diplomacy will work, by all means, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>If you think we can, you know, economic sanctions will work, let&rsquo;s impose them.</p>
<p>If you think the Chinese can help us or the Russians can help us, by all means, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>involve them.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I think we&rsquo;ve tried just about everything here.</p>
<p>Nothing has worked so far, because what we have to do is dismantle this nuclear capability.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t allow, in my opinion, North Korea to continue to develop</p>
<p>threats against American homeland property and citizens and institutions and so forth.</p>
<p>That has to be dismantled, and I believe it has to be dismantled relatively quickly.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have forever to deal with this problem, or we&rsquo;ll get to a point where we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>deal with it.</p>
<p>Now, I think we should deal with it with conventional weapons, rather than use nuclear</p>
<p>weapons against North Korea.</p>
<p>And I think we still have the capability to do that, to help them dismantle this capability.</p>
<p>But we need to get with it pretty soon, because, you know, time&rsquo;s running out on us here.</p>
<p>What if, to go back to some of the constraints maybe that a guy like Johnson was operating</p>
<p>under, what if the Chinese or Putin&rsquo;s government tell us, no, don&rsquo;t do that?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think, well, we&rsquo;d know that already, first of all.</p>
<p>But remember, the North Korean nuclear capability is a bigger threat to Beijing,</p>
<p>a bigger threat to Vladivostok, than it is to Honolulu or Chicago.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s every reason, I believe, that they would wish to cooperate with us.</p>
<p>If not, then so be it.</p>
<p>We have the means to deter China and Russia.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve shown that already.</p>
<p>Well, the question is, we don&rsquo;t, I think, know for sure or with great enough probability</p>
<p>that we can deter North Korea.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard it argued that this guy, Kim Jong-un, is a rational person.</p>
<p>All he wants to do is hold power.</p>
<p>Therefore, he has something to lose.</p>
<p>Therefore, he&rsquo;s deterrable.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s probably right.</p>
<p>My question is, what if it&rsquo;s wrong?</p>
<p>What are the odds that he&rsquo;s not deterrable?</p>
<p>Say it&rsquo;s only 10%.</p>
<p>So do we want to make a bet?</p>
<p>We want to bet Chicago or New York City that he&rsquo;s deterrable when the odds are 10% say</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s not deterrable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we want to take that bet.</p>
<p>And by the way, the overview ought to be here about nuclear proliferation.</p>
<p>Where are we going to draw the line?</p>
<p>Is it OK for Nigeria or Honduras or Belize to have nuclear weapons?</p>
<p>What is the point at which we&rsquo;re going to put our foot down and say, no, we&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>far enough?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough that 10 or so countries that are acting responsibly so far have nuclear</p>
<p>weapons.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>The world is dangerous enough without Estonia having a full up nuclear delivery capability.</p>
<p>But in any case, we now have a case which I think is as clear as can be that says we</p>
<p>need to stop this process here.</p>
<p>If America possesses armed forces for any reason, it is to protect the property and</p>
<p>the institutions and the lives of Americans against threats like North Korea, a nuclear</p>
<p>armed North Korea.</p>
<p>I believe we ought to draw the line and we ought to give a deadline by 1 January next</p>
<p>year.</p>
<p>Either the North Koreans are dismantling this capability under international inspection</p>
<p>or we will help dismantle it.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny you jumped the gun and went right to my next question, which was</p>
<p>about nuclear nonproliferation, because I wanted to ask you, is it specifically a North</p>
<p>Korean problem or is it you mentioned Belize, right?</p>
<p>OK, is it a Belize problem?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my question, though.</p>
<p>This reminds me a little of like certain naval treaties between the two world wars</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re telling certain powers, listen, this is 70 plus year old technology, the basis</p>
<p>for nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re telling other countries that they can never develop that capability, isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that the equivalent of locking them into second power status permanently in the way that the</p>
<p>Japanese had to have six battleships to every 10 British battleships?</p>
<p>I mean, is that it seems to me the farther we get away from from when that technology</p>
<p>was invented, the weirder it gets to tell people, listen, you can have anything but</p>
<p>something that was invented darn near 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Is that should the foreign policy of the country be that no nuclear powers that aren&rsquo;t currently</p>
<p>nuclear powers should be allowed to become nuclear powers?</p>
<p>No, the foreign policy of this government ought to be that a nuclear zero.</p>
<p>That we would like to see a world without nuclear weapons, we would be much safer.</p>
<p>I mean, our superiority in conventional warfare is so pronounced that if nuclear weapons disappeared</p>
<p>everywhere in the world, it would improve the safety and security of the American people</p>
<p>enormously.</p>
<p>So our policy ought to be zero nuclear weapons for anybody.</p>
<p>Now, how do we get there?</p>
<p>I have no idea because a country like, say, Israel, which commonly is understood to possess</p>
<p>an inventory of nuclear weapons, is not going to renounce them, given its security situation</p>
<p>in the geography that it lives.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know of a practical way to get to zero.</p>
<p>I think it ought to be our objective, and I think we ought to work on it and try to</p>
<p>get there.</p>
<p>And eventually, hopefully, we can get there.</p>
<p>But that ought to be our policy objective.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, we ought to say, yes, nobody else that doesn&rsquo;t have them now is</p>
<p>going to get them, and it&rsquo;s going to reduce them to second-class status, and that&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>bad.</p>
<p>Going to have to live with it.</p>
<p>But the world is increasingly dangerous the more people get that capability.</p>
<p>And so it does freeze people into a sort of a formulaic position, like we tried to do</p>
<p>with capital ships at one time.</p>
<p>Remember, though, this is not the first time we&rsquo;ve outlawed chemical munitions, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Worldwide, hopefully.</p>
<p>And we ought to enforce that.</p>
<p>So we can put certain limitations that we hope are universal on the kind of munitions</p>
<p>that are available for use in hostile engagements.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What about a conventional situation, then, of a change in power?</p>
<p>So you look at something like in Iran, in their region.</p>
<p>All of us history nuts know that traditionally Iran or Persia is one of the‚Äîwe&rsquo;ll call</p>
<p>them the regional superpowers, right?</p>
<p>And they wax and wane, but sometimes they dominate the region.</p>
<p>It seems like the policy sometimes is we&rsquo;re not going to let anyone change the power</p>
<p>relationships that are currently in place.</p>
<p>Is that a viable‚Äîit seems to me a hegemonic power sort of way of looking at it, but is</p>
<p>that a viable way to look at something like the Middle East and say, no, you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to expand your influence into Syria, even if that&rsquo;s a traditional Persian area of expansion?</p>
<p>Do you see where I&rsquo;m going with this?</p>
<p>How much can we‚Äîwe&rsquo;ll call it the United States at the tip of the spear, but we all</p>
<p>represent a bunch of major powers.</p>
<p>How much can we be the Congress of Vienna, but constantly making sure that things stay</p>
<p>stable?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll call them stable, for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>So nuclear stability, you&rsquo;re all for.</p>
<p>What about even regional power-shifting stability?</p>
<p>We are, no doubt, a status quo power because we&rsquo;re the top dog, right?</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t want that to change, and hopefully‚ÄîI hope it never changes.</p>
<p>I mean, if this country lasts 1,000 years and we all pray it will, we want to be at</p>
<p>the top of the heap for that whole period of time.</p>
<p>However, you can&rsquo;t stand at the beach&rsquo;s edge and order the tide not to get your feet</p>
<p>wet, you know?</p>
<p>So change is inevitable, and what we have to do is to find constructive ways to allow</p>
<p>change to occur that doesn&rsquo;t threaten our position.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s every reason, by the way, that we ought to be able to do that.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly the technical change that we see in the last couple of decades has been</p>
<p>led by us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve created the instability on the technological front, so it serves our purposes to be in</p>
<p>the vanguard of change where it&rsquo;s positive.</p>
<p>We just have to figure out when&rsquo;s it positive, when&rsquo;s it negative, and that&rsquo;s what we</p>
<p>have to do.</p>
<p>We just have to figure out when&rsquo;s it positive, when&rsquo;s it negative.</p>
<p>Now, in the case of Iran, I think it&rsquo;s been a long time since Darius the Great, so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how much Persian influence.</p>
<p>You know, Syria recently has certainly been‚ÄîI mean, the Ottoman Empire was not Persian.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Syria was an Ottoman province.</p>
<p>It was hacked up by Sykes-Picot at the end of World War I, and by the way, Lebanon was</p>
<p>created separately.</p>
<p>I mean, Syria considers Lebanon a Syrian province.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Christian-French enclave, right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So the question you ask requires sophistication in the answering.</p>
<p>It requires sophistication in the asking.</p>
<p>So statesmen are judged by their ability to recognize what change is coming anyway and</p>
<p>running around and getting in front of it, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we define statesmanship.</p>
<p>And cheap politicians are defined as people who don&rsquo;t understand precisely that problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sat here, and mind you, for wisdom on current affairs and wisdom on the Vietnam</p>
<p>War.</p>
<p>At no point did I ask you about the drama, though, of flying hundreds of missions into</p>
<p>that situation, and what I would assume was a more tense situation as anti-air defenses</p>
<p>got stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>This is the understated question of all time, but can you describe to me just for a second,</p>
<p>what the heck?</p>
<p>I mean, when you look back on it, I did things that were nothing like what you did, and I</p>
<p>think, God, I was crazy.</p>
<p>And do you ever look back on that and just think to yourself, was that a different person,</p>
<p>or is it like yesterday for you?</p>
<p>Do you miss it?</p>
<p>Yeah, I miss it.</p>
<p>Combat is invigorating.</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>Partly because of hubris.</p>
<p>I mean, I was arrogant.</p>
<p>Still am, probably.</p>
<p>I mean, my friends might say I was arrogant, but when I get strapped into an airplane,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody can beat me.</p>
<p>So I never was‚Äîfor me, it wasn&rsquo;t a matter of bravery or courage to go out there because</p>
<p>I knew I was going to kick the crap out of the other guy.</p>
<p>Rather than the reverse.</p>
<p>So for me, combat, I flew 285 combat sorties, and I loved every minute of it.</p>
<p>And I miss it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really, really fun.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to explain.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a professional warrior, you know, so that&rsquo;s what I was cut out to do, and I</p>
<p>enjoyed it a lot.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to recommend that people read your books to get a more detailed version</p>
<p>of everything we were just talking about.</p>
<p>General, did I ask everything you would like to talk about?</p>
<p>Is there anything that you&rsquo;d like to bring up that I left out?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This has been a pretty wide-ranging conversation and more philosophical than I&rsquo;m equipped</p>
<p>to deal with.</p>
<p>Your questions are too good.</p>
<p>I mean, nobody, including Herodotus, you spoke of the Peloponnesian Wars.</p>
<p>Nobody has answers to these questions, and it&rsquo;s not good to ask a professional military</p>
<p>guy.</p>
<p>These are questions for the philosophy professor, not for me.</p>
<p>But certainly, it&rsquo;s been as wide-ranging as I could desire and more so than I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>any good at handling.</p>
<p>General, you under-appreciate yourself.</p>
<p>I tailored those questions after watching you talk, and I think you&rsquo;re absolutely‚Äîand</p>
<p>you know, what&rsquo;s funny is when I met General Mattis, I thought that&rsquo;s how he thought</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very well-versed and wide-ranging yourself.</p>
<p>I appreciate it, Dan.</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
<p>I enjoyed talking to you, buddy.</p>
<p>My thanks to General McPeak for coming on the program and putting up with my traditionally</p>
<p>unusual and long-winded questions.</p>
<p>His books are available everywhere.</p>
<p>We will link to some of them on our website.</p>
<p>His latest, as I said, is Roles and Missions, cataloging his time as the 14th Chief of Staff</p>
<p>of the Air Force.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a fascinating guy.</p>
<p>I think you can agree, and I appreciate him coming on the program.</p>
<p>The policy here is to let you hear the shows and then decide for yourself what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worth.</p>
<p>We sort of rely on the honors system as our business model, and so far, so good.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your support.</p>
<p>It keeps the lights on around here.</p>
