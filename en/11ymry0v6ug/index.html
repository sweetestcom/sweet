<p>but um</p>
<p>uh I think I think winter is a coming</p>
<p>well I think so I&rsquo;m in the South and</p>
<p>even for us it&rsquo;s down in the 40s so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty that&rsquo;s pretty chilly uh</p>
<p>come North Carolina almost down to South</p>
<p>Carolina listen uh doc without further</p>
<p>Ado I&rsquo;m going to bring Jennifer on</p>
<p>because she keeps popping off and on her</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s from Kentucky and you know about</p>
<p>their internet down there in Kentucky so</p>
<p>uh Jennifer you&rsquo;re on with Dr Birds</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>um okay so I have started uh I started</p>
<p>keto in March started doing one meal a</p>
<p>day in August off and on and I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>very faithful and all of a sudden and</p>
<p>then I just started doing the apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar from watching one of your</p>
<p>shows</p>
<p>um to in the morning and in the evening</p>
<p>and then ever since then it&rsquo;s just my I</p>
<p>hate to be like you know too personal</p>
<p>but my my bowels have been so loose</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never and I take and I&rsquo;ve not done</p>
<p>anything else that&rsquo;s different and so I</p>
<p>quit and then I started again yesterday</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing wrong</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good point it just tells me</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely an interaction</p>
<p>between acetic acid and your your</p>
<p>bacteria in fact your bacteria</p>
<p>is even a byproduct can make acetic acid</p>
<p>so you know I think it&rsquo;s just an</p>
<p>imbalance going on and I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>exactly what&rsquo;s happening but what I</p>
<p>would do is I would just mix it cut it</p>
<p>out not use it you know it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to be</p>
<p>major Game Changer situation but</p>
<p>obviously with some people you know you</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work for you</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know exactly why but um I do</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s some difference that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in your microbes that might uh</p>
<p>might be significant but we would</p>
<p>probably have to do a deep dive into you</p>
<p>know a test or some type of stool sample</p>
<p>to see what&rsquo;s going on and compare that</p>
<p>to normal</p>
<p>so so if I just didn&rsquo;t maybe did it like</p>
<p>once a day you don&rsquo;t think I mean</p>
<p>because I like the results I&rsquo;ve not had</p>
<p>any other problems</p>
<p>you can try you can try just lessening</p>
<p>it and see if that doesn&rsquo;t help you</p>
<p>um you can also try taking them in pills</p>
<p>that might help and let&rsquo;s say for</p>
<p>example you do one one of those one</p>
<p>teaspoon a day and you still have a</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>um then you can shift gears to using</p>
<p>something of attained hydrochloride</p>
<p>which is another type of acidifier for</p>
<p>your stomach but I would just start</p>
<p>lessening it to the point where you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have any problem anymore try that</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a very interesting effect</p>
<p>because I I don&rsquo;t hear that often so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know why so I&rsquo;ll have to find out</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to do some research on that</p>
<p>too well I I all when I quit I quit for</p>
<p>a week and then it and it still did it</p>
<p>and I like I said I just started</p>
<p>yesterday but it was still doing it so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only assuming that it&rsquo;s from that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the only new thing that I</p>
<p>did</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s the thing about</p>
<p>experimentation</p>
<p>um you just have to do it with one</p>
<p>variable to really make sure you do it</p>
<p>with one variable at a time don&rsquo;t do two</p>
<p>things at once because then you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>um so if you&rsquo;re sure that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>then do the next experiment just start</p>
<p>cutting down the amounts</p>
<p>and see what happens</p>
<p>um you may benefit maybe from some type</p>
<p>of uh either probiotic food like</p>
<p>fermented vegetables or just a probiotic</p>
<p>just to see if that that doesn&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>you kind of repopulate because see</p>
<p>typically when you um have diarrhea</p>
<p>um you can have a deficiency of friendly</p>
<p>bacteria so putting that back in there</p>
<p>can actually help</p>
<p>um diarrhea so anytime someone has</p>
<p>diarrhea you want to add more probiotic</p>
<p>so uh or a food for the probiotic so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just kind of a tip</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well listen get back with</p>
<p>us that&rsquo;s a well that&rsquo;s a pain in the</p>
<p>butt and so we hope that it gets better</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re glad that you uh came on with</p>
<p>us and we look forward to hearing your</p>
<p>continued success by the way</p>
<p>congratulations and all the other great</p>
<p>benefits you found from it and we hope</p>
<p>that you get over that so thank you</p>
<p>Jennifer for being patient with us I</p>
<p>know you popped off and on a couple of</p>
<p>times but we got your question out we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>excited about that and if you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>there Jennifer we want you to look at</p>
<p>the first question and Doc here it is</p>
<p>okay what natural remedy</p>
<p>that you can get easily is the most</p>
<p>powerful</p>
<p>detoxifier in the world and I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about that can help neutralize poisons</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and um lessen the risk factor of being</p>
<p>poisoned</p>
<p>all right sounds great okay uh let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>to social media finally uh Seer from</p>
<p>YouTube can you suggest a way to treat</p>
<p>OCD boy that&rsquo;s a common topic</p>
<p>well of course</p>
<p>the best thing to do is to run your</p>
<p>brain on ketones so the way you do that</p>
<p>is something called the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>and you would not do snacks you do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting that probably would</p>
<p>handle it right there in combination</p>
<p>with a good</p>
<p>B vitamins a natural a natural source</p>
<p>something like nutritional yeast</p>
<p>would be very very powerful as well</p>
<p>because that way you can um</p>
<p>um helped to fortify the brain what it</p>
<p>usually needs for OCD and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually related to some imbalance</p>
<p>with your diet and so I&rsquo;ve done videos</p>
<p>on this you can take certain trace</p>
<p>minerals but the main thing is making</p>
<p>sure you get your diet corrected first</p>
<p>because that could be</p>
<p>solving the problem right there without</p>
<p>having to add anything</p>
<p>all right terrific so let&rsquo;s go to let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>find out if there are in fact is anyone</p>
<p>listening to us this morning and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>evidence a good morning to all our</p>
<p>viewers joining us today from the UK</p>
<p>Canada Jordan the Caribbean islands all</p>
<p>of my guests uh Brazil Austria South</p>

<p>Lucas beautiful place Armenia Hong Kong</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia and all across these United</p>
<p>States and it&rsquo;s funny you know if I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get to the this list right away</p>
<p>Terry continues to update it because</p>
<p>more people just keep chiming and man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are happy</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s going on with your various</p>
<p>programs Dr Berg and it&rsquo;s evident in all</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>um that are chiming in from all over the</p>
<p>world let&rsquo;s see speaking of that oh and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s evidence Cindy from YouTube I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing keto for three months now and</p>
<p>I went from 182 to 152 that&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>weight loss thank you Dr Berg for all of</p>
<p>the videos and wealth of knowledge that</p>
<p>you share with us I&rsquo;m loving all of your</p>
<p>keto products too so uh oh and by the</p>
<p>way from the Green Room Rose is clapping</p>
<p>away she&rsquo;ll be on with us shortly so</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s delighted with what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on including me Doc you know I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m I</p>
<p>falter sometimes but man do I feel</p>
<p>better doing uh these programs to the</p>
<p>degree that I am willing so anyway let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually go to another question here</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think we have to go to an answer first</p>
<p>right uh well let&rsquo;s see if you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>one hang on a second</p>
<p>not yet but I see that Terry&rsquo;s typing</p>
<p>something okay uh Jamie from Facebook</p>
<p>your video on B1 has changed my life it</p>
<p>helped my uh panic attacks so much thank</p>
<p>you I thought that was a question but</p>
<p>that was another</p>
<p>um you know exaltation of the great</p>
<p>things that are going on uh let&rsquo;s look</p>
<p>for another question okay all right</p>
<p>anatasia from YouTube what are your</p>
<p>thoughts on coconut sugar is it good</p>
<p>replacement for table sugar or is there</p>
<p>another alternative that you would</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>yeah coconut sugar is not a good</p>
<p>alternative actually probably the worst</p>
<p>sugar is um agave nectar</p>
<p>um but coconut sugar has just too much</p>
<p>sugar so you&rsquo;re going to have to do</p>
<p>something like Xylitol or erythritol</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>as your sugar alternative or Stevia or</p>
<p>monk fruit because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>these other sugars just are going to</p>
<p>blow your sugars out in fact I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to do another video related to</p>
<p>the sugar in</p>
<p>apple juice and carrot juice and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating to me when you do a</p>
<p>search</p>
<p>is will Apple Juice affect your blood</p>
<p>sugars</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how many pages it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>say in Google when you search it oh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fine it&rsquo;ll be fine or fine it won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>affect your blood sugars and of course</p>
<p>if you look at the fine print</p>
<p>um who&rsquo;s sponsoring it&rsquo;s called The</p>
<p>Juice Association</p>
<p>so yeah so it&rsquo;s all sponsored by</p>
<p>industry so it&rsquo;s like okay so how deep</p>
<p>do you have to go to find an actual</p>
<p>study that gives an alternative</p>
<p>Viewpoint and you have to go pretty deep</p>
<p>and I did find a whole bunch of</p>
<p>information so I&rsquo;ll share that but um</p>
<p>I mean the easiest thing to do is an</p>
<p>experiment on yourself just check your</p>
<p>blood sugars drink some juice and then</p>
<p>record your blood sugars after you know</p>
<p>right away 30 minutes an hour two hours</p>
<p>and watch what happens to yourself</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see and feel what happens when</p>
<p>you consume juice and the even USDA like</p>
<p>called my plate which is the new version</p>
<p>of the food pyramid</p>
<p>um you can now replace</p>
<p>um juice with fruits and vegetables</p>
<p>so now it&rsquo;s like um you can just drink</p>
<p>your your fruits and oh yeah it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>fine</p>
<p>um no it won&rsquo;t be fine</p>
<p>all right well what is fine is the</p>
<p>audience a quick reaction to our</p>
<p>questions and the first question of</p>
<p>today asked what natural remedy is the</p>
<p>most powerful detoxifier in the world</p>
<p>and 65 percent of our respondents say</p>
<p>charcoal 20 say cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>excuse me five percent say uh fulvic</p>
<p>acid never heard of it five percent say</p>
<p>iodine and the final five percent say</p>
<p>garlic how we doing doc</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing good uh uh charcoal is the</p>
<p>answer so well done on that one um so</p>
<p>just uh if you want something to detox</p>
<p>go to your uh your barbecue grill that</p>
<p>you have outside grab the charcoal and</p>
<p>uh no you don&rsquo;t want to use that you</p>
<p>want to get activated charcoal uh from</p>
<p>the health store but it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>um charcoal has a lot of little tiny</p>
<p>pores and it has um little crevices and</p>
<p>cracks uh so it has a massive massive</p>
<p>surface area I&rsquo;m talking like</p>
<p>um I think like one cubic centimeter is</p>
<p>equal to a thousand</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>um kilometers if I&rsquo;m not mistake um</p>
<p>or or</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to get the exact amount but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s massive but the point is this um as</p>
<p>a large surface area and it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>by absorbing these toxins it works by</p>
<p>adsorption which is like a magnet so if</p>
<p>we take this magnet here it gets stuck</p>
<p>on the surface of the uh the charcoal</p>
<p>and it can pull not only</p>
<p>poisons but proteins</p>
<p>protein things that are poisonous to you</p>
<p>or not not good for you as well as gases</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s really good for bloating</p>
<p>flatulence diarrhea</p>
<p>also if anyone&rsquo;s trying to poison you</p>
<p>even if you feel not good after you do</p>
<p>some type of detox or even when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking medications</p>
<p>Steve did you know the third cause of</p>
<p>death is outrogenic</p>
<p>disease do you know what that is uh yes</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to seem too smart for</p>
<p>the audience why don&rsquo;t you go ahead and</p>
<p>let them know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s accidents that doctors uh</p>
<p>create by giving them certain medication</p>
<p>or surgeries so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>necessarily intended but um it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely the 30 is like medication so</p>
<p>with errors</p>
<p>um so there&rsquo;s a lot of people getting</p>
<p>toxicity from drugs and um</p>
<p>unfortunately that you don&rsquo;t really look</p>
<p>at that as a big problem as much as you</p>
<p>should so the point is that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably a wise thing to have some our</p>
<p>activated charcoal in your house</p>
<p>somewhere just in case you might need it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been using it for animals for a</p>
<p>long time and also</p>
<p>um I think even</p>
<p>over 2000 years it&rsquo;s been a natural</p>
<p>remedy for um GI problems and toxicity</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a good thing to have because if</p>
<p>some somehow you swallowed something or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exposed to something poisonous</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t get to the hospital</p>
<p>you need charcoal it&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>um thing to just bind with the poison</p>
<p>and then have it go right through your</p>
<p>body wow so you take that with lighter</p>
<p>fluid no how do you ingest that</p>
<p>you swallow it</p>
<p>I mean is it like a hill or a powder or</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like capsules okay</p>
<p>boy that&rsquo;s terrific yeah or you can chew</p>
<p>on your barbecue uh inside the grill</p>
<p>that you have in the backyard oh yeah</p>
<p>Perfect all right let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>our next Quiz question</p>
<p>uh and here we go</p>
<p>okay what is the first sign of a vitamin</p>
<p>A deficiency</p>
<p>all right dig into that</p>
<p>audience let&rsquo;s go to Facebook Charlie</p>
<p>does apple cider vinegar have an impact</p>
<p>with stimulant medications I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>that vitamin C will interact with</p>
<p>stimulant medications didn&rsquo;t say what</p>
<p>Adderall or something I guess</p>
<p>not to my knowledge I&rsquo;ve never heard any</p>
<p>problems that will stimulate medication</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re thinking of grapefruit</p>
<p>juice that that could um affect</p>
<p>medications but not apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not any vitamin C in apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar either so you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to worry about that</p>
<p>well they keep streaming and Kathy from</p>
<p>Facebook has lost 70 pounds on fasting</p>
<p>thank you Dr Berg uh they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>pointing through what uh great success</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see if we can find someone that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not successful and talk to them let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>okay here we go Sonia from YouTube could</p>
<p>you please make a video about addressing</p>
<p>carcinoid endocrine tumors I think I</p>
<p>said that right</p>
<p>honestly</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would just watch all my um cancer</p>
<p>videos and apply that information</p>
<p>because it would be the same the same um</p>
<p>procedure as well cancer whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s malignant or a benign</p>
<p>um as in a tumor</p>
<p>comes from the same Source where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having</p>
<p>um damage to the mitochondria because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening and so then the</p>
<p>mitochondria</p>
<p>through some ancient survival mechanism</p>
<p>switches over to a different way of</p>
<p>surviving using fermentation so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>different metabolic</p>
<p>pathway and so the question is</p>
<p>what can we do to um counter that is</p>
<p>there some type of advantage that we can</p>
<p>do to overcome this well there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of things that people do for cancer and</p>
<p>preventing cancer and even</p>
<p>treating cancer but there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>unique that um</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s different than our normal</p>
<p>cells so so for example if you start</p>
<p>doing prolonged fasting all sorts of</p>
<p>miraculous things happen to the cancer</p>
<p>cells you start killing cancer cells but</p>
<p>not the normal cells so your normal</p>
<p>cells Thrive but the cancer cells</p>
<p>um literally die because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stimulating</p>
<p>um an ancient survival mechanism which</p>
<p>basically kind of turns off all the the</p>
<p>cancer genes and uh and and and turns on</p>
<p>all the good genes so this whole genetic</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>thing is interesting because just</p>
<p>because you have certain genes that are</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>programmed to cause you to be have high</p>
<p>cholesterol or create this or that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something else that you can do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called epigenetics which is above</p>
<p>genetics it&rsquo;s something that you can</p>
<p>control you can control most of your</p>
<p>genes so fasting is one of the most</p>
<p>potent things you can do to influence</p>
<p>those genes</p>
<p>the genetic um</p>
<p>testing is something very very new for a</p>
<p>lot of people and it&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>exciting it&rsquo;s a new field of getting</p>
<p>your genes tested and then looking at</p>
<p>your weak links</p>
<p>I am doing a massive deep dive into that</p>
<p>subject right now because it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>um because you if you can find all your</p>
<p>weak links and you can support them you</p>
<p>can prevent a lot of problems</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t have this when I was in</p>
<p>practice so you just have to do a blood</p>
<p>test and see what&rsquo;s happening to the</p>
<p>person right now you couldn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>necessarily look at their blueprints to</p>
<p>see where their weak links are where</p>
<p>their strong links are there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>including myself to have weak links even</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one one tiny example</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a genetic problem that I have</p>
<p>which um</p>
<p>has to do with the inability to convert</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>inactive like beta-carotene into Vitamin</p>
<p>A the reactive form of vitamin A and so</p>
<p>um I have a problem with that Gene so</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>um if I become a vegan and I start just</p>
<p>doing trying to get my vitamin A from</p>
<p>vegetables I&rsquo;m not going to get hardly</p>
<p>any conversion at all so I&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>deficient in retinol</p>
<p>so um what&rsquo;s the solution</p>
<p>just consume more retinol which I do I</p>
<p>do naturally egg yolks</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>raw milk cream butter cod liver oil</p>
<p>liver all these things are low with</p>
<p>vitamin A so I&rsquo;m not going to have a</p>
<p>problem why because I consume a lot of</p>
<p>retinol if I didn&rsquo;t know that and I went</p>
<p>become a vegan I probably would have a</p>
<p>big problem and I start having all sorts</p>
<p>of issues so the point is that this this</p>
<p>new testing is very valuable I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to be doing a lot of videos on it but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m right in the middle of a deep dive</p>
<p>and I think most people will find it</p>
<p>fascinating but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a bit tactical</p>
<p>so this is you know trying to unders</p>
<p>like trying to understand all these</p>
<p>different words I&rsquo;m going to make it</p>
<p>really simple</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific okay audiences on it</p>
<p>quiz question number two asked what is</p>
<p>the first sign of a vitamin A deficiency</p>
<p>speaking to the devil and uh 82 percent</p>
<p>responded say the sinus changes in your</p>
<p>vision uh ten percent say uh</p>
<p>ten percent say acne and eight percent</p>
<p>say changes in skin color</p>
<p>Okay so the answer is night blindness or</p>
<p>or just difficulty seeing when the</p>
<p>lights are dimmed so it&rsquo;s not just like</p>
<p>driving and seeing the dark it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say your office</p>
<p>um is not well lit and you spend eight</p>
<p>hours and you&rsquo;re trying to read you know</p>
<p>you just read books or something like</p>
<p>that like I do and you you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>well lighting you may</p>
<p>um think unique glasses but it could be</p>
<p>that you just need more vitamin A but</p>
<p>the active form which is retinol</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Unfortunately they change the definition</p>
<p>of uh vitamin A to mean uh the precursor</p>
<p>to retinol which is beta-carotene so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say that beta-carotene is</p>
<p>vitamin A but it&rsquo;s not it has to be</p>
<p>converted</p>
<p>and has to be converted like</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like only three percent of it converts</p>
<p>so the when you&rsquo;re consuming a lot of</p>
<p>beta carotene there&rsquo;s benefits but</p>
<p>unfortunately you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>probably get a lot into retinol</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um this could affect the eyes and</p>
<p>especially your ability to see in dim</p>
<p>lighting</p>
<p>well this begs the question do you have</p>
<p>a supplement or remedy for it within</p>
<p>your products</p>
<p>well um you can do the cod liver oil</p>
<p>or just um</p>
<p>consume um liver products</p>
<p>um or just um you can do butter but the</p>
<p>only things you have to get raw butter</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing raw cream right now which is</p>
<p>basically is loaded with vitamin A but</p>
<p>of course when you pasteurize it you</p>
<p>destroy it huh so um egg yolks are a</p>
<p>really good source of vitamin A too</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s go to another uh quiz questions</p>
<p>kick it off and it says the following</p>
<p>okay which is more vitamin A retinol</p>
<p>three ounces of beef liver or 40 pounds</p>
<p>of raw carrots</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>you might have given this away in the</p>
<p>last statement well I don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting but we&rsquo;ll see continue the</p>
<p>education</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we go to the green room and</p>
<p>our next participant is Rose and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from California Rosie wrong with Dr bird</p>
<p>uh you&rsquo;re muted deer</p>
<p>hi Dr Burke</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>hi nice to finally speak with you I</p>
<p>watch you I&rsquo;m doing your immune course</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awesome and FYI everybody it&rsquo;s free</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s super good and so much information</p>
<p>hey so my question is I started the keto</p>
<p>and I lost about 35 pounds and that was</p>
<p>awesome because I tried everything</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t do it until I finally did the</p>
<p>keto the only problem was that it</p>
<p>reacted my gallbladder reacted to it man</p>
<p>it started like really terrible</p>
<p>gallbladder pain I went and had the</p>
<p>ultrasound I did the test where they run</p>
<p>and see how your gallbladder is working</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s gallstones there wasn&rsquo;t and</p>
<p>they said there was no sludge I just</p>
<p>have slow bile</p>
<p>so but whenever I consume the fat that</p>
<p>you need to consume on the keto I get</p>
<p>pain I still do I&rsquo;m on your gallbladder</p>
<p>and that FYI everybody is amazing it</p>
<p>saved my life it saved my life because I</p>
<p>really thought I mean it&rsquo;s awful</p>
<p>gallbladder it&rsquo;s awful you really think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to die</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but anyway so I&rsquo;m doing that and that</p>
<p>helps it takes away the pain literally</p>
<p>takes away the pain but so I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>that and now I got a virus and then</p>
<p>everything spiraled down again it just</p>
<p>went downhill again</p>
<p>um my hair started thinning I started</p>
<p>aging rapidly but I&rsquo;m still doing the</p>
<p>keto and what I do like he&rsquo;s told the</p>
<p>last person was I just back off a little</p>
<p>bit when I noticed that the pain and I</p>
<p>kind of test my body and see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening</p>
<p>so I back off and on I also have an</p>
<p>overgrowth of candida I&rsquo;ve had that for</p>
<p>30 years I cannot get rid of it</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get rid of it I wanted to ask</p>
<p>you a question about that on the</p>
<p>charcoal can I take that every day and</p>
<p>does it interfere with any other</p>
<p>vitamins like will it take away my</p>
<p>vitamins no can I do that</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;ll actually help your microbiome</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh you can take it every day it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to deplete you of any</p>
<p>nutrition it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty natural</p>
<p>um so that would help you</p>
<p>a day I&rsquo;ve been doing three caplets of</p>
<p>the activated coconut is that a good one</p>
<p>yeah yeah that&rsquo;s a good one</p>
<p>um okay yeah because you can get the</p>
<p>charcoal from coconut or um you know</p>
<p>other things yeah that&rsquo;s totally fine I</p>
<p>think for the candida though um you may</p>
<p>need to just um</p>
<p>start to uh down the uh some garlic</p>
<p>tablets or maybe oregano and and just</p>
<p>try to kill it that way but</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m glad that your sugar is low</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to be really</p>
<p>important as well</p>
<p>um but here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting that</p>
<p>relates to your question</p>
<p>that um relates to me uh on one of my my</p>
<p>DNA test</p>
<p>you find all your weaknesses and and I</p>
<p>apparently have this one gene that um</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t consume a good amount of</p>
<p>choline</p>
<p>choline is uh in bile salts it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>really key nutrient to help you break</p>
<p>down fats</p>
<p>um you will have</p>
<p>um a kind of a chronic issue with with</p>
<p>the gallbladder which I have so</p>
<p>um so you you can um so you take the</p>
<p>bile salts which is awesome right you</p>
<p>take that and maybe you take one also an</p>
<p>empty stomach but then now add in there</p>
<p>um choline</p>
<p>choline and get the type of choline with</p>
<p>phosphorus</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s like in the form of</p>
<p>like phospholipid or phosphocholine</p>
<p>something like that and uh what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to find it&rsquo;s not gonna happen like</p>
<p>overnight</p>
<p>but after like three or four or five</p>
<p>days you&rsquo;ll be like wow I can start</p>
<p>breaking them fast now I&rsquo;m just guessing</p>
<p>you have a problem with this Gene I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not saying you are but it&rsquo;s something I</p>
<p>do everything that you&rsquo;ve said I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched you I the same exact thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what got me to start following</p>
<p>you okay</p>
<p>so so this is something that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>hard to detect on a even an MRI with</p>
<p>your biles or your functional testing it</p>
<p>just um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>the body just requires certain things</p>
<p>more than usual to be able to deal with</p>
<p>this extra fat and um so</p>
<p>you know rather than doing expensive DNA</p>
<p>test you can just take some choline very</p>
<p>inexpensively and see if it helps you</p>
<p>and then we know okay good that that was</p>
<p>what you needed and um</p>
<p>um whatever I would do two um whatever</p>
<p>it says on the bottle and just start</p>
<p>with that and then maybe increase from</p>
<p>there for a little bit but you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to have that much but uh two</p>
<p>tablets would be fine and I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to necessarily get into the dosages</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know yet but</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s one of those things you have to</p>
<p>experiment and and test the waters okay</p>
<p>well Rose listen we got to move along</p>
<p>but thank you so much for participating</p>
<p>and I would love it uh for you as we</p>
<p>always do get back with us and let us</p>
<p>know how your condition evolves</p>
<p>positively so let&rsquo;s uh move on uh to the</p>
<p>answer for quiz question number three</p>
<p>and I think you learned them doc because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a almost a consensus 98 of</p>
<p>respondents says it&rsquo;s the old beef liver</p>
<p>which I hate two percent say it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>carrots</p>
<p>well those two percent like they must</p>
<p>not have been listening closely because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I mean think about this three</p>
<p>ounces of beef liver to compare to 40</p>
<p>pounds of carrots I used to think that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting all this vitamin A from</p>
<p>carrots and Kale like the same thing</p>
<p>with 400 cups of raw kale it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even compare with the liver so</p>
<p>um what does this mean this means that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very difficult to get</p>
<p>retinol from to to be um you know just</p>
<p>by cutting out all these meats so it</p>
<p>means that um our bodies Were Meant to</p>
<p>consume animal products</p>
<p>um designed to consume animal products</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t you could end up with</p>
<p>trouble</p>
<p>um the the variation of conversion is is</p>
<p>goes from one extreme to the other but</p>
<p>an average person does not consume very</p>
<p>much</p>
<p>um including myself</p>
<p>so um egg yolks great source butter</p>
<p>um even cheese that&rsquo;s Raw</p>
<p>but the point is that in cod liver oil</p>
<p>is another good one but vitamin A is not</p>
<p>not just good for your eyes it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>for the immune system especially immune</p>
<p>system and mucous membranes skin</p>
<p>outside and inside very very important</p>
<p>um so stay tuned for more information on</p>
<p>vitamin A because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um people don&rsquo;t talk about vitamin</p>
<p>A lately so you want to get the full</p>
<p>scoop and I&rsquo;m going to be doing more</p>
<p>videos on it okay well I can&rsquo;t ignore</p>
<p>all this positive stuff rwg 51 is his or</p>
<p>her handle and had a terrible accident</p>
<p>that left a great amount of scar tissue</p>
<p>across my midsection and caused a hernia</p>
<p>the fasting has really helped me recover</p>
<p>thank you Dr Byrd</p>
<p>great awesome that&rsquo;s terrific okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see uh</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see Christina from</p>
<p>YouTube I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with a</p>
<p>ventricular tachycardia can you please</p>
<p>tell me what I can do to address this</p>
<p>condition naturally and without going on</p>
<p>meds</p>
<p>well I would hope</p>
<p>you um</p>
<p>you really increase your electrolytes</p>
<p>right now like potassium</p>
<p>and even magnesium</p>
<p>and even your sodium like your salts I</p>
<p>would I would go up with those</p>
<p>electrolytes for sure and see if that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t help you because the pacemaker</p>
<p>is somehow wigging out I also realize</p>
<p>that the pacemaker is</p>
<p>part of the nervous system and if you</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>also problems with the myelin sheath</p>
<p>around those nerves there could be a</p>
<p>problem so</p>
<p>um but that that wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem</p>
<p>if you were on keto and doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting because you would</p>
<p>kind of support the nervous system</p>
<p>um but don&rsquo;t forget also B vitamins</p>
<p>especially like B1 that&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>intimately involved with the nerve</p>
<p>conduction</p>
<p>and if you have a B1 deficiency</p>
<p>one of the biggest things that you have</p>
<p>is nerve problems inflammation in the</p>
<p>nerve problems with the nerve peripheral</p>
<p>neuropathies autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>neuropathies so who knows if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>connected as well but the B vitamins and</p>
<p>electrolytes that&rsquo;s what I would focus</p>
<p>on uh extensively and really</p>
<p>potassium too okay here&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>question romelia from YouTube is the</p>
<p>keto diet good for someone who&rsquo;s had</p>
<p>gastric bypass</p>
<p>especially because now</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s gonna it&rsquo;s an alteration in the</p>
<p>structure of your stomach and even part</p>
<p>of the small intestine so what happens</p>
<p>now is it&rsquo;s going to be a positive thing</p>
<p>for your insulin so you&rsquo;ll probably lose</p>
<p>weight if you&rsquo;re a diabetic that could</p>
<p>even help that because they&rsquo;re altering</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>um the part of the system that</p>
<p>influences insulin</p>
<p>but you want to make sure you get your</p>
<p>electrolytes</p>
<p>um especially and trace minerals very</p>
<p>importantly and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>watch my videos on this because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>um that you should be aware of even like</p>
<p>taking more bile salts because now that</p>
<p>is going to be altered so you might end</p>
<p>up with deficiencies which could a bile</p>
<p>deficiency which could end up with like</p>
<p>a low vitamin A D E K1 K2 so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of things that you have to watch out</p>
<p>for once you have the bypass</p>
<p>okay Craig on from Facebook has some</p>
<p>encouraging news what details can you</p>
<p>share on uh Coral Calcium probiotics and</p>
<p>coral have cured my acid reflux and</p>
<p>soothed my wife&rsquo;s Crohn&rsquo;s disease which</p>
<p>is awful your thoughts</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a lot of data on Coral</p>
<p>Calcium I do know that it&rsquo;s an alkaline</p>
<p>substance so it&rsquo;s going to obviously</p>
<p>help heartburn or digestive problems I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the ultimate</p>
<p>solution though</p>
<p>um you know I talk about calcium a lot</p>
<p>in some of my videos</p>
<p>um calcium is one of those minerals that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit more difficult to get</p>
<p>rid of I don&rsquo;t agree with um</p>
<p>people taking</p>
<p>like just Mega calcium to think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>preventing bone loss because we have</p>
<p>more of a problem with too much calcium</p>
<p>than we do a Calcium deficiency</p>
<p>but when I do a video on too much</p>
<p>calcium</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>all calcium is bad you need certain</p>
<p>amounts of calcium so you need just the</p>
<p>right amount so we don&rsquo;t want to get low</p>
<p>too low we don&rsquo;t want to have too much</p>
<p>but calcium tends to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that can build up in in the body in the</p>
<p>wrong places and but as far as the Coral</p>
<p>Calcium</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have as much data on that it may</p>
<p>be okay I know they&rsquo;ll say that the</p>
<p>okinawans uh whatever um they have they</p>
<p>live the longest and</p>
<p>well do they consume that calcium do</p>
<p>they consume Coral Calcium really I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if they do just just so</p>
<p>happens to be in the vicinity where they</p>
<p>are but um I wouldn&rsquo;t say that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the reason why they&rsquo;re living long</p>
<p>okay Joe from Facebook if I eat only</p>
<p>fish</p>
<p>and uh excuse me that jumped and veggies</p>
<p>what supplements should I be taking I do</p>
<p>eat eggs occasionally</p>
<p>good I like the fact you&rsquo;re doing fish</p>
<p>you have your omega-3 fatty acids and</p>
<p>what was the other thing he eats veggies</p>
<p>okay good I mean if you eat enough of</p>
<p>the of the of an of the right vegetables</p>
<p>which are quality okay so you get the</p>
<p>vitamin C the folic acid uh potassium</p>
<p>magnesium and then you also do fish then</p>
<p>you get the protein</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids it could cover</p>
<p>everything and plus you&rsquo;ll get trace</p>
<p>minerals and zinc and he&rsquo;s eating eggs</p>
<p>by the way</p>
<p>but then then you get all the benefits</p>
<p>of vitamin K2</p>
<p>um and choline which is actually in the</p>
<p>egg yolk so I think that would cover</p>
<p>almost everything that you might need</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um you have to realize that the</p>
<p>you know the quality of the vegetables</p>
<p>nowadays is it might not be as high as</p>
<p>it should be so really depends on</p>
<p>where you get those vegetables and what</p>
<p>soil that they&rsquo;re grown on</p>
<p>all right terrific next Quiz question</p>
<p>please a true falser this time</p>
<p>okay organic yeah true or false organic</p>
<p>100 apple juice from the store is high</p>
<p>in natural vitamin C</p>
<p>great these true falsers are terrific</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re dumb you have a 50 chance</p>
<p>of getting it right so good luck</p>
<p>audience with that let&rsquo;s uh let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to the green room and Diana from</p>
<p>Orlando Florida has been uh waiting</p>
<p>patiently for a long time let me unmute</p>
<p>her and Diane make sure you do the same</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>and you were on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>hi Dr Burke I am so happy I&rsquo;m so happy</p>
<p>to speak with you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I have a severe osteoporosis and severe</p>
<p>scoliosis my curves are for the</p>
<p>scoliosis are 71 degrees thoracic and 65</p>
<p>degree lumbar my issue primarily seems</p>
<p>to be that I suffer from severe bloat</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I eat I</p>
<p>just become like a ball I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sibo or dysbiosis leaky gut I do</p>
<p>eat gluten-free dairy free and</p>
<p>um my RBC magnesium levels are very good</p>
<p>right now they&rsquo;re now at 6.0 so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good I know you were just talking about</p>
<p>calcium and I do consume uh my calcium</p>
<p>from food so I keep track on an app and</p>
<p>I try not to go over 700 milligrams</p>
<p>daily</p>
<p>um but I&rsquo;m concerned because my father</p>
<p>just passed away with um</p>
<p>from liver cancer</p>
<p>and colon cancer</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>I just I just would like to know um I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to take the drugs that my</p>
<p>Doctor is recommending my metabolic</p>
<p>specialist so what would you recommend</p>
<p>that your mother do</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah um I would there&rsquo;s quite a quite a</p>
<p>bit to talk about but I would you know</p>
<p>to build bone back up</p>
<p>um it takes it takes time it could take</p>
<p>a you know five six seven years uh not</p>
<p>just taking calcium of course try to get</p>
<p>it from the food as much as you can but</p>
<p>you may need a um a good amount of trace</p>
<p>minerals because those are all the</p>
<p>activators you might need a good amount</p>
<p>of vitamin K2</p>
<p>um and uh you also want to do a lot to</p>
<p>keep your inflammation down your</p>
<p>systemic inflammation uh because that</p>
<p>can actually eat away at the bone as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>um that means a good amount of omega-3</p>
<p>with uh avoiding the omega-6 fatty acids</p>
<p>um in your situation you know this is a</p>
<p>perfect example of the benefit of some</p>
<p>type of DNA test to to look at um so</p>
<p>look at</p>
<p>genetic weaknesses that you have that</p>
<p>you can then do something about now</p>
<p>but in the meantime</p>
<p>um I think um following</p>
<p>um the healthy version of the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet that I talk about and then a good</p>
<p>amount of fasting would be good</p>
<p>um that would help you but the K2 trace</p>
<p>minerals</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>would be very beneficial for your bones</p>
<p>scoliosis</p>
<p>um you know it&rsquo;s pretty much</p>
<p>set in a certain pattern now because of</p>
<p>your age but I think that you can</p>
<p>actively and aggressively work on</p>
<p>stretching and and all these minerals</p>
<p>and the K2 and probably some vitamin D</p>
<p>would greatly help your muscle muscles</p>
<p>and the spasm that are probably going</p>
<p>around and supporting the scoliosis so</p>
<p>you probably feel your muscles uh feel a</p>
<p>lot better if you did that</p>
<p>um but again this is all about</p>
<p>putting in these basic things first</p>
<p>right making sure that we&rsquo;re doing all</p>
<p>the right things so then then you can</p>
<p>actually not have to end up where your</p>
<p>your father ended up because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actively and aggressively turning</p>
<p>things around and you&rsquo;re controlling</p>
<p>um your genes with the epigenetic things</p>
<p>uh food diet stress</p>
<p>um those type of things so</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s what I would start with um</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>okay so I should try to get a genetic</p>
<p>genetic DNA test then</p>
<p>find uh uh someone that um like does</p>
<p>functional nutrition that can evaluate</p>
<p>the free of someone that&rsquo;s good I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to be doing a lot of videos on the</p>
<p>near future and I&rsquo;ll have some good</p>
<p>recommendations but I mean</p>
<p>I think um</p>
<p>if you could do that that would be uh</p>
<p>smart because especially anytime you</p>
<p>have like a complex case where you have</p>
<p>multiple things going on it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>good to know where that osteoporosis is</p>
<p>coming from is it coming from</p>
<p>the absorption of calcium is it coming</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>some type of</p>
<p>inflammatory thing or is it coming for</p>
<p>something else so you can then</p>
<p>have more data to solve it</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>all right I&rsquo;ll start doing more research</p>
<p>then thank you so very much that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>and by the way I&rsquo;m sure we speak for</p>
<p>everyone Diana we&rsquo;re so sorry for the</p>
<p>loss of your father that&rsquo;s a an awful</p>
<p>thing to uh to tolerate but we hope</p>
<p>again that your health continues to</p>
<p>improve and we&rsquo;d love to hear back from</p>
<p>you as we do everyone uh to report some</p>
<p>great findings in your accelerating</p>
<p>health so thanks for joining the show</p>
<p>and we have got uh answers to our true</p>
<p>falser and I hope they&rsquo;re true now let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see uh 96 of our respondents say that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s false and four percent are holding</p>
<p>out say it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>of course so I always have to have this</p>
<p>percentage holding out</p>
<p>um it doesn&rsquo;t mean if it&rsquo;s organic or</p>
<p>regular juice 100 juice or for</p>
<p>concentrate</p>
<p>um they they put it on the Shelf</p>
<p>um without being refrigerated</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the Shelf I mean the the um</p>
<p>and it can sit down there for two years</p>
<p>before you know apparently goes bad or</p>
<p>the expiration date kicks in there two</p>
<p>years in the Shelf how can they actually</p>
<p>take apple juice</p>
<p>and put on the shelf for that long</p>
<p>um because they pasteurize it and they</p>
<p>pasteurize it to preserve it and vitamin</p>
<p>C is very sensitive to heat and light so</p>
<p>if you think you&rsquo;re gonna retain vitamin</p>
<p>C chances are you&rsquo;re probably not so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they have to add it in there</p>
<p>the type to add in there is a synthetic</p>
<p>version which is ascorbic acid is not</p>
<p>the same as natural so any vitamin C in</p>
<p>apple juice or orange juice has been</p>
<p>pasteurized is added after the fact it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fortified and you think wow I&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>this great thing I&rsquo;m getting getting my</p>
<p>vitamin C from my juice</p>
<p>yeah right okay</p>
<p>yeah fortified does sound exciting</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it even though uh perhaps it</p>
<p>really does sound exciting in theory but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it is in reality</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s see here Stephen from</p>
<p>Facebook I have purchased a few of your</p>
<p>products I wanted to know your thoughts</p>
<p>on benefits of taking berberine and</p>
<p>benphotamine and can we take them both</p>
<p>at the same time</p>
<p>you can there those are two really</p>
<p>interesting products one is the the</p>
<p>berberine is um probably equivalent to</p>
<p>metformin as far as uh Effectiveness for</p>
<p>insulin resistance boy is it good for</p>
<p>your blood sugars but it&rsquo;s also good for</p>
<p>a lot of other things too</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>anti-cancer but</p>
<p>um the benfotamine is a um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really good for neurological</p>
<p>problems especially if you have</p>
<p>peripheral neuropathy or even problems</p>
<p>in in your brain that requires the</p>
<p>penetration to the to the myelin sheath</p>
<p>which is a</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know B1 is all about the nervous</p>
<p>system it&rsquo;s just and other things too</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um you can use the fat soluble version</p>
<p>which is called benphotamine to</p>
<p>penetrate deeper into the nervous system</p>
<p>in the brain</p>
<p>um but B1 is um a fascinating vitamin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s most people are deficient in it you</p>
<p>require a lot of B1 especially if you do</p>
<p>the carbs and most people become</p>
<p>deficient because they&rsquo;re doing too many</p>
<p>carbs</p>
<p>so B1 is not some extra little</p>
<p>thing but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>an absolute requirement for certain</p>
<p>metabolic pathways so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all by the way vitamins work they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re Co factors they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>helper</p>
<p>um things that just allow enzymes to</p>
<p>work</p>
<p>and so without them enzymes can&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>enzymes are the magical thing that does</p>
<p>all the work in the body and one</p>
<p>nutrient like um B1 would be involved in</p>
<p>many many different enzymes so you can</p>
<p>imagine without that</p>
<p>your body is going to allocate that B1</p>
<p>only to the necessity ones not the other</p>
<p>ones so you&rsquo;re going to always end up</p>
<p>with problems so once you really</p>
<p>understand what vitamins do it may</p>
<p>inspire you to eat a little bit better</p>
<p>Steve I&rsquo;m talking to you I&rsquo;m being very</p>
<p>sarcastic though but well no you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>I eat like a slob sometimes so</p>
<p>anyway so speaking of which where would</p>
<p>people you notice this important</p>
<p>question how do they know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting quality B1 or benphotamine or</p>
<p>whatever how do we research it and make</p>
<p>sure that we&rsquo;re not getting junk</p>
<p>well you you research researched the</p>
<p>source of it</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m not biased of my own products and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also very sarcastic but</p>
<p>um I my thing is I make sure that um</p>
<p>the Farms that some of the ingredients</p>
<p>come from are really really</p>
<p>um have very healthy soils also the</p>
<p>quality of products are not just coming</p>
<p>from some Source I know nothing about I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get any of my ingredients from</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>um so I&rsquo;m just I really make sure that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I get the best source and I&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>doing more videos on going to some of</p>
<p>the Farms where we grow some of the raw</p>
<p>ingredients because um</p>
<p>I I would really like transparency not</p>
<p>just with our vitamins but with our food</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the way to the Future so</p>
<p>you know what you&rsquo;re getting because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you like even eighty percent</p>
<p>of all the tomatoes in the United States</p>
<p>come from Florida and they come they</p>
<p>start out green and they spray it with a</p>
<p>certain gas to um</p>
<p>to ripen it I I don&rsquo;t like that in fact</p>
<p>it affects the flavor and so um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re paying for food I&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>pay for uh nutrient dense foods</p>
<p>versus just well by The Weight by the</p>
<p>how heavy something is yeah it&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so frustrating because the tomatoes look</p>
<p>fabulous and sometimes they have a</p>
<p>little Vine left on it and then you cut</p>
<p>into it it tastes like wall board it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just no not reminiscent of a no</p>
<p>wonderful tomato no nutrients no taste</p>
<p>yeah terrible okay let&rsquo;s the final</p>
<p>participant in our Green Room is Evelyn</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s coming in from Southern</p>
<p>California and Evelyn remember to unmute</p>
<p>yourself and you&rsquo;re on with Dr bird</p>
<p>hi there how you doing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to talk to you right</p>
<p>and you always said to look at</p>
<p>huh</p>
<p>can you hear me yeah go ahead yeah with</p>
<p>your question Evelyn and you always have</p>
<p>um to go back and look at the history of</p>
<p>something that happened to you and to</p>
<p>give you a 30-second thing it was 2015</p>
<p>my mom passed away 2016 my brother</p>
<p>passed away then I had to go through</p>
<p>attorneys to get my inheritance then in</p>
<p>um 20</p>
<p>20 my sister passed away so then I had</p>
<p>to go through probate and I had to go</p>
<p>through all these stuff and this</p>
<p>happened like back in March of 2019 I</p>
<p>came down really sick with it cold and</p>
<p>cough so I went to emergencies and they</p>
<p>said well your blood pressure is too</p>
<p>high so you you know we can&rsquo;t give you</p>
<p>anything so I went to the doctors they</p>
<p>put me on high blood pressure medicine</p>
<p>which I really never had but high blood</p>
<p>pressure medicine my whole life</p>
<p>and then what happened was that you know</p>
<p>they said okay we want to look at your</p>
<p>kidneys and then I went up in Canada to</p>
<p>look at have them look at my kidneys and</p>
<p>the doctor says my kidneys are fine</p>
<p>and so you know I just you know I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been on the ketogenic intermittent</p>
<p>fasting for past year or so and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing everything right I take all</p>
<p>your products I exercise you know I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;m very strict on everything</p>
<p>and you know but the doctors are saying</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to listen to me they say</p>
<p>well you have to eat right</p>
<p>but what else can I do and I do eat</p>
<p>right and I just wonder what else can I</p>
<p>do and I have this little argument with</p>
<p>the doctors because they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>care</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really look at the streps</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through</p>
<p>okay what do you think doc</p>
<p>so this is a couple things that we do</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re doing um keto I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>glad you&rsquo;re doing fasting keep that in</p>
<p>of course you you had the worst stress</p>
<p>um that</p>
<p>your body can experience I mean the</p>
<p>losses are the biggest thing that</p>
<p>creates the parallel paralyzed immune</p>
<p>system so</p>
<p>um you know the best thing to do is to</p>
<p>to counter that is to</p>
<p>um somehow extract your attention and um</p>
<p>every day work on going for long walks</p>
<p>getting space getting your attention on</p>
<p>something else because you know you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be kind of thinking about</p>
<p>that as much as possible and then the</p>
<p>other thing too is ashwagandha tea more</p>
<p>B vitamins are going to be important</p>
<p>um especially B1</p>
<p>lemon balm tea all these are really good</p>
<p>so I think they&rsquo;re on the right track</p>
<p>but you just need a little assistance</p>
<p>with this stress</p>
<p>um what happens with the B vitamins</p>
<p>especially B1 is it will</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t lower stress but it just</p>
<p>increases the body&rsquo;s resistance to</p>
<p>stress it increases the tolerance so you</p>
<p>can cope with things better</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we want to get you to a</p>
<p>place where you can</p>
<p>be more comfortable and it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>overwhelm you</p>
<p>um so those are some things that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>that I would do and then also be on the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet automatically increases</p>
<p>your tolerance and stress so it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>beneficial to your adrenals being on the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet and doing prolonged</p>
<p>fasting so things that strengthen</p>
<p>those factors would be fasting Keto</p>
<p>taking the stress up by doing things</p>
<p>maybe even like physical work around</p>
<p>external like outside somewhere being in</p>
<p>nature all those things um especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in California you should do that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to really work on</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the worst you you just</p>
<p>experienced not just stress but multiple</p>
<p>stresses in a row just Bam Bam Bam so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very sorry to hear that</p>
<p>um unfortunately</p>
<p>everyone has to go through that you know</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some we have people around</p>
<p>us that are not going to last forever so</p>
<p>um yeah it&rsquo;s definitely something to</p>
<p>cope as well as you can well best wishes</p>
<p>to you Evelyn we appreciate that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to move along now to get to our</p>
<p>final quiz question of the day and Doc</p>
<p>here it is</p>
<p>okay so which vitamin deficiency is</p>
<p>involved in bruising that&rsquo;s not related</p>
<p>to trauma or injury</p>
<p>okay and by the way we had I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>I put it up but I should have I forget</p>
<p>her name but she said suddenly uh this</p>
<p>woman from social media has got uh</p>
<p>extreme bruising all over her body and</p>
<p>she seems to even touch herself it turns</p>
<p>into a bruise and that&rsquo;s been going on</p>
<p>with her for I don&rsquo;t know two to three</p>
<p>weeks is that somehow uh part and parcel</p>
<p>to this question Maybe</p>
<p>well I think it might be which is very</p>
<p>uh much of a coincidence right that uh</p>
<p>she just asked a question and we</p>
<p>happened to ask another question that</p>
<p>relates to this so I think when</p>
<p>when we talk about the answer she will</p>
<p>have her answer good so stay tuned ma&rsquo;am</p>
<p>and I forgive me for uh missing your</p>
<p>name but you know who you are and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have some news for you up</p>
<p>shortly let&rsquo;s go back to social media in</p>
<p>fact this is going to be a social media</p>
<p>uh Extravaganza that&rsquo;s all we have left</p>
<p>to do for the rest of the show and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s by Design I want to make sure we</p>
<p>can answer as many questions as we can</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>oh here we go and this is kind of</p>
<p>familiar sometimes Gene from YouTube uh</p>
<p>hi from Dallas I have lost 15 pounds on</p>
<p>keto and fasting in five months but I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>also lost a lot of hair over that period</p>
<p>what can I do to stop the hair loss</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what type of version of</p>
<p>Keto you&rsquo;re doing hopefully it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>type that I would recommend where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also making sure that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>nutrient dense foods if you do Keto and</p>
<p>you lose your hair</p>
<p>um then you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>either trace minerals that you need more</p>
<p>of like zinc it could be iron</p>
<p>the type of foods that you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>need to be maybe try more Seafood to get</p>
<p>those trace minerals but let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing the fasting too the fasting</p>
<p>the reason the fasting could produce the</p>
<p>hair loss if you do prolonged fasting is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re already going into it are</p>
<p>deficient with nutrients and then the</p>
<p>fasting exaggerates the nutrient</p>
<p>deficiencies so that&rsquo;s why you want to</p>
<p>take certain nutrients while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fasting like the B vitamins like</p>
<p>electrolytes and the trace minerals very</p>
<p>very important</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>um for your hair loss I have quite a few</p>
<p>videos on the topic but</p>
<p>um those that&rsquo;s the basics that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrific and bunch again I have to throw</p>
<p>this in every once in a while you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>that uh well I think it&rsquo;s evident that</p>
<p>Dr Berg does not have a toupee that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all rich flowing here and his beautiful</p>
<p>wife Karen has a lion&rsquo;s mane of hair and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re both keto folks so it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>prerequisite to have your hair fall out</p>
<p>um so and they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re evidence of</p>
<p>that so make sure you&rsquo;re following the</p>
<p>clean keto diet and by the way it was</p>
<p>Allison from YouTube who had the</p>
<p>question about uh bruising she&rsquo;s 50</p>
<p>years old so stay tuned Allison we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have an answer up for you very</p>
<p>soon and drumroll please the final quiz</p>
<p>question which vitamin deficiency is</p>
<p>involved in bruising not trauma related</p>
<p>are you ready Allison uh at least your</p>
<p>cohorts 60 of them say it&rsquo;s caused by</p>
<p>low vitamin K 20 percent say it&rsquo;s low</p>
<p>vitamin A and 20 cent excuse me 20</p>
<p>percent say it&rsquo;s low Vitamin C Dot</p>
<p>the answer is it&rsquo;s a deficiency of</p>
<p>vitamin K1</p>
<p>now K1</p>
<p>is interesting because um that actually</p>
<p>helps you with your clotting factors</p>
<p>but also</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not consuming enough greens</p>
<p>um your microbes can make them but if</p>
<p>your microbes you don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>microbes then you might be deficient so</p>
<p>the body is going to allocate</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>this K1 to the most important factors</p>
<p>and so K1 is also involved in um</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory functions as well as</p>
<p>making K2 it can convert the K2 if you</p>
<p>have the right microbes so so it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of like this uh triage effect where</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have enough the body will</p>
<p>say okay I&rsquo;ll use it for this but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to use it for that as a</p>
<p>survival mechanism and so um you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important understanding</p>
<p>all the different functions of K1 but K1</p>
<p>can be easily done if you actually</p>
<p>consume enough greens so you have this</p>
<p>big salad I definitely don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>deficiency because I consume a lot of</p>
<p>salad some people don&rsquo;t an average</p>
<p>person consumes 1.5 cups of vegetables</p>
<p>per day and of course that could be also</p>
<p>including potatoes or corn which they</p>
<p>consider a vegetable which that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous so I think that K1 is um</p>
<p>your microbes can make it and also it</p>
<p>comes from dark leafy green vegetables</p>
<p>parsley</p>
<p>massive knots of K1 brussels sprouts</p>
<p>kale Swiss chard all the grains that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how you get your K1 so</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>gallbladder or let&rsquo;s say you have a bile</p>
<p>deficiency for some reason or you have</p>
<p>malabsorption that could be why you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not absorbing K1 too</p>
<p>um so there&rsquo;s a lot of different reasons</p>
<p>why you might be deficient but which is</p>
<p>cool about K1 is they can also help you</p>
<p>if you just get more of it with varicose</p>
<p>veins with bleeding nose with</p>
<p>inflammation with having more K2 to have</p>
<p>stronger bones so</p>
<p>K1 is um</p>
<p>very very um</p>
<p>interesting and I did create a video on</p>
<p>this so stay tuned stay tuned for the</p>
<p>release of that shortly</p>
<p>well doc I tell you what let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s end</p>
<p>on a high note</p>
<p>um Jamie from Facebook your videos on B1</p>
<p>changed my life it has helped with my</p>
<p>panic attacks thank you so much and then</p>
<p>another thank you after that</p>
<p>well if you don&rsquo;t have if you have panic</p>
<p>attacks</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s honestly if you really know</p>
<p>about B1</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to just pull you right out of</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s going to help a panic Tech is</p>
<p>like a high level fear situation right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>you know you you&rsquo;re just like freaking</p>
<p>out and that the nervous system and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about the central nervous system</p>
<p>is affected and if you take some B1 boy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll just make you feel so much better</p>
<p>give you a sense of relief</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so it also is good for anxiety which is</p>
<p>slightly different anxiety is not panic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like um worrying it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>got problems that but you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>Solutions so you&rsquo;re constantly thinking</p>
<p>about these problems especially for a</p>
<p>bed which doesn&rsquo;t help things but B1 can</p>
<p>help that too it helps the it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get rid of your problems it just allows</p>
<p>you to tolerate your problems and cope</p>
<p>with them better</p>
<p>yes you have the same amount of problems</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s not affecting you as</p>
<p>much yeah I wish the problems went away</p>
<p>then we wouldn&rsquo;t have to do anything for</p>
<p>goodness sakes but here they are Steve I</p>
<p>think a few problems you&rsquo;d be probably</p>
<p>so miserable if you had no problems what</p>
<p>what there&rsquo;s no it&rsquo;s kind of like um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no more barriers to life so what</p>
<p>would you do</p>
<p>sit on the beach drink Margaritas well</p>
<p>maybe no you make a great Point Taco why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you take us out of here we are now</p>
<p>out of time</p>
<p>okay so uh thanks for your attention</p>
<p>um and um stay tuned for some um some</p>
<p>very new uh content that you probably</p>
<p>have never seen before you or even even</p>
<p>talked about I&rsquo;ll be creating releasing</p>
<p>new videos and then next Friday we&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>the same show thank you for your</p>
<p>attention and your wonderful comments</p>
<p>and have a wonderful weekend</p>
