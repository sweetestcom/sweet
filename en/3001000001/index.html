    <p>hey everyone it&rsquo;s great to be back at GDC</p>
<p>you know back in 2020 as the pandemic was ramping up we were the last major</p>
<p>company to drop out of GDC we&rsquo;re the first to go all remote and then we</p>
<p>headed into the pandemic it was a completely crazy time with thousands of</p>
<p>people working from around their homes but the company thrived and so I&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to go through some of the things that we&rsquo;ve done since the since the last GDC</p>
<p>first of all we launched project Liberty epic challenge the App Store monopolies</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re in front of the ninth Circuit Court Europe has passed major new</p>
<p>legislation and the fight goes on for the freedom of all Developers</p>
<p>mediatonic joined epic um launched Fall Guys for free and</p>
<p>brought in 60 million new players bandcamp the Indie music site joined</p>
<p>epic bandcamp helps Indie musicians reach fans online today and we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to build metaverse opportunities for all musicians in the future</p>
<p>fortnite Thrive during this time we launched two major chapters lots of</p>
<p>seasons and brought the fortnite audience up to 500 million player</p>
<p>accounts Travis Scott launched the astronomical</p>
<p>concert into fortnite Ariana Grande launched the rifter</p>
<p>and so overall fortnite had a really great time with tons and tons of players</p>
<p>enjoying and the world constantly evolving</p>
<p>we also learned some hard lessons Epic into a massive settlement with the</p>
<p>FTC it really brought home to us and to the whole industry that kids in</p>
<p>technology are a pressing topic for all developers to take seriously and that</p>
<p>the expectations of regulators here in the United States and around the world</p>
<p>are much higher than ever before and so we&rsquo;ve done a lot over the past</p>
<p>few years to improve things we&rsquo;ve had huge sets of new parental controls into</p>
<p>fortnite and the epic game store and the child safety features like cabin</p>
<p>accounts and being epic when we solve a problem for ourselves we like to bring</p>
<p>it to all other developers so they can benefit from the work and to that end</p>
<p>super awesome joined epic super awesome makes verifiable parental consent tools</p>
<p>they are available to all Developers for free so it becomes much easier to comply</p>
<p>with all the regulatory laws around children&rsquo;s access to games worldwide</p>
<p>we also launched on your own Engine 5 into Early Access during the pandemic we</p>
<p>went through a year yes</p>
<p>went through a year of Early Access followed by release we updated fortnite</p>
<p>to Unreal Engine 5 and then we spent a whole year visually upgrading fortnite</p>
<p>to the latest capabilities of Unreal Engine 5 and which we launched late last</p>
<p>year and we&rsquo;ll be showing later in this show</p>
<p>epic game store also thrived the player in race has grown massively during this</p>
<p>time to over 230 million players on PC we&rsquo;ve uh paid out more than a billion</p>
<p>dollars to all developers and we&rsquo;ve also just very recently launched</p>
<p>self-publishing so it&rsquo;s easier than ever before to launch your game to all</p>
<p>customers in the PC market with really straightforward tools and earn 80 88 of</p>
<p>all revenue but that&rsquo;s a summary of the past and</p>
<p>this day of unreal is about the future so I&rsquo;d like to invite Nick penwarden to</p>
<p>come up and talk about Unreal Engine 5.2 thanks</p>
<p>all right thank you Tim</p>
<p>thanks Tim and hi everyone I&rsquo;m excited to get to show you some of the new</p>
<p>experimental features we&rsquo;ve been working on for Unreal Engine 5.2</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a look</p>
<p>all right so last year we added several new features to the engine to support</p>
<p>foliage rendering and the fortnite team used those features to ship battle</p>
<p>royale chapter 4. at the same time Jacob over there and the team at qixel were</p>
<p>experimenting with what&rsquo;s possible for photoreal foliage environments as well</p>
<p>as testing out the latest functionality that we&rsquo;ve been building for Unreal</p>
<p>Engine so Jacob&rsquo;s here with us today in the</p>
<p>unreal editor let&rsquo;s explore the environment and what better way to do</p>
<p>that than off-roading and what better way to off-road than an arivian r1t</p>
<p>now rivian uses unreal to power their instrument cluster including 3D</p>
<p>visualization of their vehicles so we worked with them to bring the r1t to</p>
<p>life in this experience let&rsquo;s head on out Jacob sure thing on my</p>
<p>way all right so we&rsquo;re building tools for interactive and dynamic worlds so</p>
<p>here we have chaos physics simulating rocks that tumble as we drive over them</p>
<p>leaves Bend out of the way and we also added some real-time fluid simulation</p>
<p>we worked with the team at rivien to set up unreal&rsquo;s chaos vehicle model to</p>
<p>simulate the suspension of the truck and how the electric motors Drive each</p>
<p>individual wheel chaos also simulates how the tires</p>
<p>compress and deform and meta sounds enabled the team to precisely</p>
<p>re-synthesize the sounds of the electric motors and mix them with the ambisonics</p>
<p>of the jungle</p>
<p>so rivien provided us with a highly detailed model of the truck about 71</p>
<p>million polygons that were able to render in real time thanks to nanite</p>
<p>now the rivian not only looks incredibly realistic because of lumen and nanite</p>
<p>but also its materials and today we&rsquo;re introducing substrate our new material</p>
<p>framework</p>
<p>and to better demonstrate it let&rsquo;s swap the paint out for opal</p>
<p>now of course you can&rsquo;t order a rivian with opal body panels but opal was the</p>
<p>internal code name for this project and also a really great demonstration of</p>
<p>substrates capabilities the base layer models the iridescence</p>
<p>refraction and Reflections that occur inside of an opal and on top of that is</p>
<p>a layer representing the polished surface and how light is absorbed as it</p>
<p>travels through that clear layer of varying depth</p>
<p>and now we can add back on the dust and dirt layers</p>
<p>and notice how the reflection changes when interacting with the dust layer and</p>
<p>that there are no artifacts along the transition from dirt to dust to opal</p>
<p>so substrate is more expressive enabling artists to create materials like this</p>
<p>with different shading models and compose and layer those materials as</p>
<p>they see fit all right let&rsquo;s uh head on out Jacob on</p>
<p>my way in terms of performance substrate</p>
<p>materials that are similar to the current Unreal Engine shading model cost</p>
<p>about the same but now artists have the freedom to author more complex materials</p>
<p>for extremely detailed use cases like in cinematics and in film</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re gonna drive under this fallen tree here and everything that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen up to this point was painstakingly hand built by the environment theme at</p>
<p>quixel everything since that fallen tree has been built using our brand new</p>
<p>experimental Suite of procedural content generation tools entirely an engine that</p>
<p>are flexible deterministic and artist driven</p>
<p>our guiding principle in building these systems was to empower artists to make</p>
<p>tools for artists so Jacob&rsquo;s going to go ahead and add a</p>
<p>procedural assembly to the world and the cool thing is that it</p>
<p>communicates thank you</p>
<p>yeah pretty cool</p>
<p>and the cool thing is that it communicates with other nearby</p>
<p>procedural elements in the scene like the creek bed so let&rsquo;s say a designer</p>
<p>comes by wants to direct the player to drive to the left Jacob can simply move</p>
<p>the assembly to the right and everything updates to accommodate that change</p>
<p>game design is iterative so let&rsquo;s say the designer comes back wants to give</p>
<p>the player the choice of going left or right again Jacob can simply move the</p>
<p>assembly back over</p>
<p>now the artist who created this assembly also added some additional handles that</p>
<p>Jacob can use to Art direct where Rock slides occur allows them to customize</p>
<p>the piece a little bit more make it a little easier for the Arabian to drive</p>
<p>by so we started by hand crafting that</p>
<p>original part of the level to set the visuals and art direction for the entire</p>
<p>piece and then built out procedural tools that allowed the team to create a</p>
<p>much larger play Space much more quickly now let&rsquo;s see how we can use these</p>
<p>procedural tools to make larger sweeping changes to the environment</p>
<p>so Jacob let&rsquo;s start by removing some of the trees in this area absolutely that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>easy enough actually</p>
<p>all right a little too much let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s add some trees back in okay and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also add in some Cliff formations give it a little bit more variability</p>
<p>so the procedural systems are all deterministic as Jacob is experimenting</p>
<p>with different sets of input parameters once he finds a set that he likes he can</p>
<p>always go back to it and get out exactly the same results</p>
<p>and the procedural systems aren&rsquo;t just placing trees and rocks but also fog</p>
<p>cards bugs birds everything that&rsquo;s needed to bring this environment to life</p>
<p>and everything that you&rsquo;ve seen here works at scale this environment is four</p>
<p>kilometers by four kilometers if we hide all the procedural elements</p>
<p>we can see that original hand built area about 200 meters by 200 meters</p>
<p>we believe that there will always be the need for hand building environments so</p>
<p>we design these procedural systems to be tools for artists that work in concert</p>
<p>with hand-built content both substrate and the new procedural</p>
<p>tools will be available in experimental form in 5.2</p>
<p>and everything you&rsquo;ve seen here is running in the unreal editor in real</p>
<p>time on a developer machine with an Intel 13900k CPU and Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU</p>
<p>so Jacob thanks for being here and helping us out today thank you very much</p>
<p>Nick for having me it&rsquo;s been a pleasure</p>
<p>all right so come visit us at the Unreal Engine booth on the Expo floor you can</p>
<p>check out this demo for yourself and this afternoon here in the ybca we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have a tech talk diving into the details behind this demo</p>
<p>in addition the preview one build of Unreal Engine 5.2 is available now so</p>
<p>you can test out all of the experimental new features we showed today as well as</p>
<p>numerous other improvements head over to the epic game store to download the</p>
<p>binary build and also get the full source code from the Unreal Engine</p>
<p>repository on GitHub now I found that we make the best</p>
<p>technology for developers when we use it ourselves when we really put the engine</p>
<p>through its Paces both through Tech demos like this one as well as full game</p>
<p>Productions so to talk about how the fortnite team used the latest Unreal</p>
<p>Engine 5 capabilities to ship battle royale chapter 4. please help me welcome</p>
<p>John laugh [Music]</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>thanks Nick for chapter four we wanted to show</p>
<p>fortnite in a way players had never seen before</p>
<p>we upgraded with broad Strokes using Lumen nanite and other ue5 Tech</p>
<p>we work directly with the engine team to improve these features and ensure they</p>
<p>scaled on all platforms fortnite ships on</p>
<p>first up was lighting now our options in the past to improve lighting have been</p>
<p>somewhat limited because fortnite is a really Dynamic game</p>
<p>big lighting just doesn&rsquo;t work because the moment a player destroys a wall</p>
<p>light maps are invalidated so we were really excited to give Lumen</p>
<p>a shot it updates Global Illumination in real</p>
<p>time as the environment changes early in chapter 4 development we</p>
<p>captured a video of lumen enabled in a fortnight test build and the player in</p>
<p>the video destroyed a wall and light just came flooding into the room and</p>
<p>honestly it was pretty stunning it brought new life to the environment and</p>
<p>the realistic bounce light worked great with fortnite&rsquo;s vibrant Style</p>
<p>well initial results were exciting you know nothing is that easy in Game Dev</p>
<p>and as we discovered Real World Lighting can create real world problems</p>
<p>playtests revealed areas of the map like attics and basements that had no windows</p>
<p>and were just too dark for gameplay and it was also the first time we were</p>
<p>using Auto exposure and it was causing bloomed out areas when players were in</p>
<p>dark Interiors looking outside we solved these issues using ue5</p>
<p>features like local exposure and some art directable controls within lumen</p>
<p>that enabled us to provide a final image much better for gameplay</p>
<p>while they are team refined content the engine team provided some new</p>
<p>scalability options so that we could run Lumen on next-gen consoles at 60 frames</p>
<p>per second in addition to lighting nanite opened</p>
<p>the door for us to add an incredible amount of detail to the fortnite island</p>
<p>it was introduced in ue5 as a virtualized geometry system that</p>
<p>supports extreme mesh complexity so we spent some time experimenting</p>
<p>looking for a good balance between stylized art Direction and detail</p>
<p>so we could increase visual quality but still maintain fortnite&rsquo;s iconic Style</p>
<p>now that artists weren&rsquo;t limited by triangle counts we scaled our content</p>
<p>pipelines to um support Nana on high-end Hardware</p>
<p>Tech artists modeled new vegetation assets</p>
<p>and the art team created some high detailed props and some amazing hero</p>
<p>assets but this still left us with the large</p>
<p>building library that needed a visual upgrade</p>
<p>we resolved this using an offline process that took displacement maps from</p>
<p>our materials and created high resolution nanite</p>
<p>meshes it was really cool to see these Classic</p>
<p>fortnite Materials like brick stone and wood get a high resolution facelift and</p>
<p>pop off their surfaces</p>
<p>now past the United demos have relied on static hard surface environments but</p>
<p>fortnite&rsquo;s an animated world trees blow in the wind and buildings</p>
<p>wobble when hit so we worked with the Nani team and they</p>
<p>extended the material pipeline to include masked and animated materials on</p>
<p>nanogeometry</p>
<p>the island in fortnite is constantly evolving with major changes each season</p>
<p>and complete reboots when chapters launch so it&rsquo;s essential that we evolve</p>
<p>our workflows too during chapter 4 development we started</p>
<p>utilizing two new ue5 features that changed how we build levels World</p>
<p>partition and one file per actor World partition automates the level</p>
<p>streaming and it allowed us to work in one large level</p>
<p>we use level instance actors to group content logically like a building and</p>
<p>all of its props one file per actor ensured our large Dev</p>
<p>team could work in this space without Source control conflicts</p>
<p>now these features hadn&rsquo;t yet been put to their Paces by a large Dev team so</p>
<p>there were some early bumps in the road but rlds were in Daily communication</p>
<p>with the engine team and we saw consistent improvements</p>
<p>not long into production we were developing fortnite and a much more</p>
<p>collaborative environment our goal for chapter four was to deliver</p>
<p>an awesome experience to our players but we also hope by using and improving</p>
<p>the engine&rsquo;s newest features we&rsquo;ve improved your experience as well</p>
<p>now with the look with the look of the amazing work developers are already</p>
<p>doing in ue5 please welcome Dana Cowley foreign</p>
<p>[Applause] [Music]</p>
<p>tools and amazing content at your fingertips making games is hard and it</p>
<p>gets even trickier when you&rsquo;re trying to ship while you&rsquo;re upgrading your</p>
<p>features and we put a lot of effort into making sure that the trans the</p>
<p>um the transition from ue4 to ue5 was as smooth as possible and you&rsquo;ve proven</p>
<p>that it worked and we&rsquo;ve been impressed with all the teams who have made the</p>
<p>jump ever so quickly you know many of you moved your games over right in the</p>
<p>middle of development and quite a few of you have left internal Tech in favor of</p>
<p>ue5 and as of last month 77 percent of all Unreal Engine users are on ue5 and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rapid adoption and Mass and over 750 000 of you are actively</p>
<p>building with Unreal Engine each and every month</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve invested in us and we&rsquo;re investing in you</p>
<p>and Beyond games you&rsquo;re telling Amazing Stories across live action and animated</p>
<p>entertainment and to date more than 550 television and film projects have been</p>
<p>made with Unreal Engine in production now these are some of the leading</p>
<p>Studios using UEFA today this represents a Brain Trust of</p>
<p>talented game developers from all over the world and it&rsquo;s getting bigger every</p>
<p>day you have validated that we&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>right path and we&rsquo;re blown away by how you&rsquo;ve embraced the tools and shown us</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s possible and now you&rsquo;re about to hear from</p>
<p>several talented teams who are bringing their awesome games to PC console and</p>
<p>mobile first up we have qubit Studios a small</p>
<p>team whose game infinite testicles has not only received an epic Mega Grant but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also coming to the epic game store with the help of Epic Games publishing</p>
<p>here to give you an exclusive New Look is Michael forzard</p>
<p>hi everyone</p>
<p>I was invited here today to share our story with you qubit Studios is a small</p>
<p>Studio from Europe and we have one mission to bring the</p>
<p>world of infinitesimals to life in our first game you play as Captain</p>
<p>orkney Redding rank as xiani&rsquo;s crew explore a mysterious planet filled with</p>
<p>large environments now a universe is already big at our</p>
<p>scale but when your main character is only a few millimeters tall it takes on</p>
<p>a world new meaning as a studio we have big ideas as a small</p>
<p>team we need to make choices and that&rsquo;s where switching from uv4 to</p>
<p>ua5 made a big difference for us it has empowered Us by giving us time back</p>
<p>let me take you through a few examples is very small we want players to truly</p>
<p>feel a sense of scale by having a large space to explore</p>
<p>by using wall partition in uv5 we managed to save months of Dev time not</p>
<p>just because of the size of the world but also because we can build on top of</p>
<p>it it allowed us to specialize a lot of systems very quickly</p>
<p>and with the built-in H lab we get strong runtime performance while being</p>
<p>able to load the entire world visually in editor</p>
<p>what world is great but it doesn&rsquo;t do us any good if it&rsquo;s empty and that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>the new packed actors and level instances came in handy</p>
<p>a level designer can use prefabs to quickly prototype ideas while artists</p>
<p>can refine those prefabs in editor by assembling assets together</p>
<p>and with one file character it all happens in parallel</p>
<p>on the animation side motion warpings allows us to use a single animation for</p>
<p>a large range of situations and with control rig we can quickly create those</p>
<p>first pass animations in editor but the most outstanding features on a</p>
<p>knight and lumen we don&rsquo;t need to spend time on topology</p>
<p>optimization and can directly use high polymers lighting is more realistic and</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to use tricks for transition between exterior and interior</p>
<p>all in all working with V5 has been a tremendous time server for us and</p>
<p>upgrading from B4 was surprisingly easy we were up and running in a couple of</p>
<p>days we can know iterate more quickly focus</p>
<p>on gameplay and allocate time to riskier ideas</p>
<p>but enough talking go on the epic game store and wishlist the game now</p>
<p>thank you everyone enjoy the rest of the show</p>
<p>your team is built a beautiful game Michael fantastic work now our next</p>
<p>partner is one that needs little introduction Kabam develops and</p>
<p>publishes world-class highly social multiplayer mobile games and today they</p>
<p>are here to make a special announcement please join me in welcoming vice</p>
<p>president of product Tyler black [Applause]</p>
<p>thank you Dina for that kind introduction hi everyone at Kabam we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>worked with the world&rsquo;s biggest brands and created our own stories to bring</p>
<p>some of the most successful mobile games to players</p>
<p>today we&rsquo;re proud to announce a new project</p>
<p>one that ushers in a whole new era for Kabam</p>
<p>King Arthur Legends rise</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a new cross-platform Squad RPG set in a stunning reimagined Arthurian world</p>
<p>when we began this ambitious project we knew that Unreal Engine was the only</p>
<p>solution that had the tools to bring incredible visuals to both mobile and PC</p>
<p>at launch so here&rsquo;s how we put those tools to use</p>
<p>King Arthur Legends rise allows players to explore campaign stages and interact</p>
<p>with their environment using a variety of animations</p>
<p>if we were to use traditional animation techniques the number of assets that we</p>
<p>would need would be massive thanks to unreal&rsquo;s Advanced animation</p>
<p>technology like ik rig retargeting motion warping and property access we</p>
<p>can create high quality detailed and attractive animations with relatively</p>
<p>few resources but that isn&rsquo;t the only way that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using Unreal Engine 5&rsquo;s tools to deepen the player experience</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re also making use of dynamic weather to affect character strengths and other</p>
<p>stats and keep the battle gameplay fresh and immersive</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all from us today we can&rsquo;t wait to share more with you</p>
<p>about King Arthur Legends rise in the coming months so check out our website</p>
<p>playkingarthur.com and sign up to stay up to date on our newest game</p>
<p>thanks Tyler now the next developer coming to the</p>
<p>stage was founded a few years ago and they&rsquo;re already making a big name for</p>
<p>themselves hexworks is a CI game studio and they are capturing the imaginations</p>
<p>of fans of Dark Fantasy with their new action RPG Lords of the Fallen</p>
<p>creative director Cesar bitosu is here to give you an exclusive look at how</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using ue5 to build one of this year&rsquo;s most highly anticipated games</p>
<p>thank you Dina thank you thank you for the introduction and handling my name so</p>
<p>graciously hello everyone I am very excited to be</p>
<p>here and represent hexworks our incredibly talented multinational team</p>
<p>behind Lords of the Fallen our upcoming dark fantasy action RPG and today we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be sharing how Unreal Engine 5 has helped bring our highly ambitious and</p>
<p>decidedly Grim Vision to life please enjoy</p>
<p>welcome to the Lords of the Fallen technical showcase</p>
<p>here at hexworks our goal has always been to create the most immersive game</p>
<p>experience possible</p>
<p>today we&rsquo;re journeying to Sky rest Bridge one of the game&rsquo;s early locations</p>
<p>to demonstrate just some of the impressive ways Unreal Engine 5&rsquo;s</p>
<p>state-of-the-art technologies have helped us deliver on this ambitious</p>
<p>vision for our upcoming action RPG we want players to feel fully immersed</p>
<p>in our world by playing as their own unique virtual persona to achieve this</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve used a combination of Technologies including 3D scans of real people and</p>
<p>ue5&rsquo;s own character customization Tech players can create unique faces and</p>
<p>bodies by dynamically morphing between a huge range of shapes before finessing</p>
<p>the finer details our extensive selection of armor sets</p>
<p>seamlessly adapt to whatever shape the player chooses it&rsquo;s really important to</p>
<p>us that we represent as wider proportion of our audience as possible</p>
<p>being able to customize your hero in Lords of the Fallen is only the</p>
<p>beginning each and every one of our characters is</p>
<p>incredibly detailed using high resolution textures</p>
<p>get up close to any surface in the game like this tunic for example and detail</p>
<p>texturing provides incredible levels of micro detail</p>
<p>how these objects move and behave is also crucial for player immersion ue5&rsquo;s</p>
<p>chaos physics engine facilitates Advanced simulations for clothes chains</p>
<p>air belts and a whole lot more this helps to substantially enhance the</p>
<p>secondary Motion in all our characters making their movements look much more</p>
<p>lifelike [Music]</p>
<p>the lighting in Lords of the Fallen takes full advantage of unreal&rsquo;s brand</p>
<p>new Lumen GI we&rsquo;ve been able to light our complex environments in real time</p>
<p>meaning we can immediately see the effect of a light bounce for example</p>
<p>without waiting for the traditional slow baking processes watch how the lighting</p>
<p>reacts as we move our light source around this environment</p>
<p>Global illumination like this can be quite demanding on processing so we also</p>
<p>make use of emissive shapes to add additional details to the lighting of</p>
<p>any space we can then fine-tune these light bounces on our nanite meshes</p>
<p>providing our world with impressive levels of detail and minimal impact on</p>
<p>performance</p>
<p>perhaps the most important element of Lords of the Fallen is the ability to</p>
<p>travel between two worlds the realm of the living Axiom and the realm of the</p>
<p>Dead umbrella we&rsquo;ve created our own custom tool set</p>
<p>within ue5 it allows us to intricately craft these two environments side by</p>
<p>side and seamlessly swap between them this means our artists and designers can</p>
<p>ensure these worlds feel intrinsically linked like two sides of the same coin</p>
<p>even if one side is decidedly more horrific than the other</p>
<p>on behalf of hexworks thanks for watching today&rsquo;s brief Tech presentation</p>
<p>the twin Realms of umbral and Axiom await Fearless adventurers later this</p>
<p>year when Lords of the Fallen Launches on PC and current gen consoles</p>
<p>thank you looking awesome thank you</p>
<p>this next team is known for making some of the world&rsquo;s most popular</p>
<p>MMORPGs and recently they&rsquo;ve been pushing the boundaries of cinematic</p>
<p>storytelling and the results speak for themselves</p>
<p>here with more is ncsoft&rsquo;s Chief strategy officer Dr song Yi Yoon</p>
<p>[Applause] thank you so much for the introduction</p>
<p>Dana good morning everyone</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to share our latest production Project M with you today</p>
<p>as you may know ncisoft is recognized as one of the best</p>
<p>MMORPG developers thanks to our Blockbuster franchises like lineage and</p>
<p>Guild Wars however</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not content with this achievement we&rsquo;re always pushing for boundaries and</p>
<p>exploring new technologies so let me introduce project MTU</p>
<p>it is our latest Innovation harnessing the power of Cutting Edge Ai and</p>
<p>Graphics technology to an unprecedented level</p>
<p>with help of Unreal Engine we have achieved our vision for Project M with</p>
<p>seamlessly integrating our foundational AI technology resulting</p>
<p>in breathtaking detail</p>
<p>so to give you a sneak peek we have prepared a video</p>
<p>featuring our CEO and chief creative officer TJ</p>
<p>who will personally guide you through our newest creation as a digital version</p>
<p>of himself thank you so much for your attention and</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy Project M</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>[Music] thank you</p>
<p>Project M is one of ncsoft&rsquo;s most ambitious projects today</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>what would it mean to you if the world was comprised of informational particles</p>
<p>instead of physical particles oh I got a little ahead of myself I am</p>
<p>TJ Kemp from ncsoft welcome to project</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>how would the fabric of simulated reality change our perceived world if we</p>
<p>could tamper with the arrangement of those particles</p>
<p>this very idea is what sparked Project M</p>
<p>m</p>
<p>the informational particles that shape project M&rsquo;s world can transform reality</p>
<p>based on your choices and each choice you make will change</p>
<p>your experience</p>
<p>the information that exists in the present reality determines how the world</p>
<p>will unfold [Music]</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>value every encounter and every moment these will be essential in the world of</p>
<p>project and this is where our journey ends for now I</p>
<p>look forward to seeing you all again soon</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you Dr Yoon Project M is looking amazing and it&rsquo;s unlike anything we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen and thanks to all the teams that have</p>
<p>given us a new look at your incredible games</p>
<p>like we just saw the world&rsquo;s year building</p>
<p>these are awesome looking characters with loads of detail and authenticity</p>
<p>and our team understands that believable digital humans are at the heart of great</p>
<p>storytelling and for more on that I&rsquo;m happy to hand it over to our CTO Kim</p>
<p>Larry thank you some incredible games sir hey</p>
<p>everybody wow it&rsquo;s great to be back after four</p>
<p>years um it&rsquo;s good to see you all</p>
<p>um so it&rsquo;s been two years since we released metahuman Creator This Cloud</p>
<p>hosted tool allows you to create photorealistic digital humans for your</p>
<p>game or experience with the Simplicity of an RPG character creator</p>
<p>yet with a level of realism and customization that you&rsquo;ve never seen</p>
<p>before our community has created millions of</p>
<p>metahumans for their unreal projects and the work we&rsquo;ve seen has been</p>
<p>unbelievably breathtaking and I&rsquo;m sure a bunch of you in the audience actually</p>
<p>making better humans as well let&rsquo;s take a look at some of this work</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>amazing you know there isn&rsquo;t a day that thank you</p>
<p>so there isn&rsquo;t a day that goes by that we don&rsquo;t see some post on LinkedIn or</p>
<p>Facebook or wherever showing us amazing usage of metahumans and I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been a really big game changer for anybody trying to tell a story in their</p>
<p>game or their experience um but today we want to take things to</p>
<p>the next level so I&rsquo;m going to actually introduce two of my most favorite</p>
<p>friends um to the stage our head of digital</p>
<p>human technology Vladimir masilovich and the actress best known as senua from</p>
<p>Ninja theories fantastic hellblade series Melina Jurgens how are you both</p>
<p>doing good thank you it&rsquo;s been a while since we were last on the stage in fact</p>
<p>I think it was seven years ago that we went through this uh that&rsquo;s a long time</p>
<p>ago we are triggering there but it was the first time we all came together</p>
<p>Ninja Theory epic cubic motion free lateral to do something that we thought</p>
<p>would wow audiences here and sort of set a template for the future of using</p>
<p>characters in games so anyway um I think we&rsquo;re I think we&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>pretty good pretty amazing place right now with the industry but we do want to</p>
<p>take things to the next level and what I want to do a little bit about is how&rsquo;s</p>
<p>things going at Ninja Theory how&rsquo;s that how&rsquo;s the new game going yeah the team</p>
<p>and I are doing really good and we&rsquo;re just extremely busy working on the</p>
<p>follow-up to the first hellblade which will be called senua Saga held light too</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait the first game was fantastic I really can&rsquo;t wait to play it</p>
<p>so get it out soon anyway I&rsquo;m Gonna Leave the stage and let these two take</p>
<p>over go and blow people&rsquo;s minds thank you</p>
<p>hi everyone</p>
<p>our guiding vision for metahuman has been the democratization of complex</p>
<p>character Technologies allowing you to work faster and see the results</p>
<p>immediately a character is only truly believable if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s motion Fidelity matches its visual Fidelity but animating at this level is</p>
<p>a hard task for even the most skilled Studios</p>
<p>some of our best work leveraged 4D capture but this took specialized</p>
<p>Hardware in weeks or even months of processing time</p>
<p>while meta human creature gave you the ability to generate high quality</p>
<p>characters animating them still wasn&rsquo;t as easy</p>
<p>this is why I&rsquo;m very excited to announce a new capability to the American product</p>
<p>met a human animator met the human animator contains the</p>
<p>essence of our 4D pipeline but optimized to run on a single machine</p>
<p>it is able to use iPhone as well as stereo professional systems and today</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to demonstrate how it works for this we&rsquo;re going to need now our</p>
<p>technician John Cook and just the phone</p>
<p>Mel can you take your position please sure let me know when you&rsquo;re ready</p>
<p>okay and action I need performance capture to work like</p>
<p>a mirror I needed to capture whether I&rsquo;m acting scared</p>
<p>or angry and sometimes all I need is a look</p>
<p>cut thanks Mel that was great yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome okay</p>
<p>our technician John is currently pulling Mass performance from the phone onto his</p>
<p>machine where everything will be processed locally</p>
<p>we have updated our live link face mobile app to capture all data at the</p>
<p>best resolution possible with the device meta human animator uses video and Dev</p>
<p>data to convert this data into High Fidelity performance animation and it</p>
<p>can even use audio to produce convincing tongue animation</p>
<p>John is currently scrubbing through the take to pick the section that he wants</p>
<p>to process John are we all good with the data</p>
<p>awesome so from now on it&rsquo;s just a single button click to kick off the</p>
<p>processing which for a performance of this length will take less than a minute</p>
<p>to convert into animation</p>
<p>so Mel well that is processing let me show you something else</p>
<p>oh is that me yeah this is what we refer to as your meta-human DNA cool</p>
<p>as generated by the capture we made earlier yeah that&rsquo;s right so from only</p>
<p>three frames of video and that data we can generate a rig that predicts all of</p>
<p>your facial expressions in just a couple of minutes well</p>
<p>to do this once for each actor that&rsquo;s right it</p>
<p>over to your face so that we can produce the performance in in a way that</p>
<p>faithful reproduces your original performance sounds cool yeah so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>check back on the on the processing which today is on the latest CP and GPU</p>
<p>Hardware from AMD metahuman animator uses a custom epic</p>
<p>facial solver and landmark detector we can interactively look at the</p>
<p>Innovation while it&rsquo;s being solved and compared to your original performance</p>
<p>so it looks like it just it&rsquo;s almost finished</p>
<p>after this is going to do one more pass to make the curves more stable</p>
<p>really quick and from here on</p>
<p>we can we just need to export the animation this takes only a few seconds</p>
<p>and then John needs to drop it in the level and add the audio so that we can</p>
<p>see the result so Mass meta human should now be ready</p>
<p>in the level well you excited to see the results yeah I can&rsquo;t wait to see it</p>
<p>I need performance capture to work like a mirror I needed to capture whether I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>acting scared or angry</p>
<p>and sometimes all I need is a look</p>
<p>thank you also Mel what do you think I think it&rsquo;s incredible because it usually</p>
<p>takes months between performance capture and getting any results back so this is</p>
<p>blowing my mind and all of this is sold directly onto animate your friend and</p>
<p>controls in this case we are using a bespoke 4D rig which we created together</p>
<p>with Ninja Theory for hellblade 2 but it&rsquo;s also ready to use on any meta human</p>
<p>or any other rig that follows our new metahuman standard</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s have a look at that</p>
<p>I need performance capture to work like a</p>
<p>I needed to capture whether I&rsquo;m acting scared</p>
<p>or angry and sometimes all I need is a look so</p>
<p>the same thing works even on stylish characters</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>thank you all these Technologies are completely redefining our creative</p>
<p>process as they already find yours One release met a human animator to everyone</p>
<p>in just couple of months we&rsquo;ve got one more thing we&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>show you we haven&rsquo;t forgotten about the needs for full performance capture</p>
<p>shoots what you&rsquo;re about to see is animation that has not been polished or</p>
<p>edited in any way and it took metahuman animator just minutes to process start</p>
<p>to finish yeah so here&rsquo;s one of my favorite lines from Ninja Theory&rsquo;s</p>
<p>upcoming game senua Saga hellblade 2 and I really hope you enjoy it and the rest</p>
<p>of the show thank you very much thank you</p>
<p>sign perf cut take 13.</p>
<p>[Music] I see through your Darkness now</p>
<p>I see through your lies I will show them how to see us I do</p>
<p>I will not appease your gods I will destroy them</p>
<p>good you like it [Applause]</p>
<p>man was that cool all right let&rsquo;s talk about the future of</p>
<p>our creator marketplaces we all know one of the biggest challenges in game</p>
<p>development is the time and cost associated with making great art and</p>
<p>Visually stunning environments now we&rsquo;ve seen that by giving you access</p>
<p>to high quality game-ready assets like quixel Mega scans World building can be</p>
<p>faster more efficient and more economical the resulting explosion of</p>
<p>creativity that we&rsquo;ve seen from our Unreal Engine developer Community has</p>
<p>been awesome in fact it&rsquo;s inspired us to double down</p>
<p>on a mission that started several years ago</p>
<p>since the launch of Unreal Engine Marketplace in 2014 we&rsquo;ve been working</p>
<p>to Aggregate and organized all the world&rsquo;s best digital assets for you to</p>
<p>use in your work in 2018 we joined forces with quixel</p>
<p>whose Mega scans have now been downloaded over 40 million times</p>
<p>in 2021 art station became part of the Epic family and we welcomed a community</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s best digital artists who&rsquo;ve since uploaded nearly 12 million</p>
<p>projects to the site later that same year sketchfab joined</p>
<p>epic and now has more than 10 million registered users who are using the</p>
<p>platform to discover share and manage 3D models</p>
<p>on the web now each of these businesses has their</p>
<p>own unique superpowers incredible content of course vibrant communities</p>

<p>to partnering with you all to make this an industry-wide success and now please</p>
<p>welcome sax Pearson</p>
<p>[Applause] [Music]</p>
<p>[Applause] it&rsquo;s great to be here today</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been working towards this moment for a very long time</p>
<p>this next segment is exactly why I&rsquo;m here at Epic to move the industry</p>
<p>forward and help make developers successful</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to introduce powerful new tools to existing fortnite creators powerful</p>
<p>new opportunities for professional Developers</p>
<p>fortnite is becoming an ecosystem that means new tools to design develop</p>
<p>and publish games and a new economy that rewards Developers</p>
<p>these updates bring us one step closer to epics vision of a connected metaverse</p>
<p>with billions of players enjoy high quality creations made by millions of</p>
<p>Developers at the center of this all is unveil</p>
<p>editor for fortnite available today in public beta on epic game store</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a new pc application that brings the power of unveil engine to the scale</p>
<p>of the fortnite audience deeply integrated with the game with new</p>
<p>workflows that allow PC and all other platforms to create together fast and</p>
<p>fluid we call it uefn for short but first let&rsquo;s talk about how we got</p>
<p>here fortnite changed when we released</p>
<p>fortnite creative four years ago creatives and in-game toolkit for</p>
<p>players to make sandbox games inside fortnite and because of creative</p>
<p>fortnite is already much more than a game</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already a place where players find games and developers find players</p>
<p>but why should you develop in fortnite well our players are highly social</p>
<p>content hungry with over 500 million play accounts massive PC presence and</p>
<p>the largest console player base is the best most vibrant place for developers</p>
<p>to find an audience quickly and publish new games</p>
<p>Islands built using creative tools already account for roughly 40 of play</p>
<p>time in fortnite that&rsquo;s billions of hours a year and we expect that number</p>
<p>to keep growing with uefn so this is a sample of games in fortnite</p>
<p>today what we have noticed is that players are</p>
<p>more engaged they have more fun when they play epic Zone games like Battle</p>
<p>Royale and Community games made by creators like you like the combination</p>
<p>is what makes fortnite special and what is going to help us all grow</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve shown it on real engine epic&rsquo;s mission is to deliver an awesome Suite</p>
<p>of tools for developers on Wheel editor for fortnite is for experienced game</p>
<p>developers like many are you in this room but it&rsquo;s also for the growing</p>
<p>community of fortnite Island creators that are ready for unreal engines proven</p>
<p>PC editor workflow as you&rsquo;re going to see in the demo</p>
<p>coming up uefn and the existing creative toolkit</p>
<p>is already a great combo for developer and fortnite Creator teams to make</p>
<p>incredible experiences of course our long-term goal is to make</p>
<p>the entire feature set of unveil engine or bring the entire feature set of</p>
<p>unveil engine to uefn but also over time to expose many of the other services</p>
<p>that epic offers bill just announce Fab Fab is launching</p>
<p>today also inside uefn in an alpha version and products like metahuman will</p>
<p>be coming to uefn in the future to support your Creative Vision</p>
<p>for the next stage of fortnite and ultimately the open metaverse we also</p>
<p>need brand new tools that solve really hard problems interoperability</p>
<p>scalability and resilience a real issue when you operate at this scale</p>
<p>and and expect this level of durability this is what led us to develop verse</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a powerful new general programming language designed specifically for this</p>
<p>purpose you&rsquo;re going to see us use it in the demo in just a moment</p>
<p>the second thing we&rsquo;re working towards is high interoperability between uefn</p>
<p>and Unreal Engine that&rsquo;ll enable you to take your work anywhere and</p>
<p>by the way behind me is the new Creator portal also launching today where you</p>
<p>can manage all your Islands one click publish them to the world and when you</p>
<p>publish the uefn your original Ip and your assets are yours to take anywhere</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s take a closer look at uefn features and workflows we put together a</p>
<p>short video and then we&rsquo;re going to do a demo thank you</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start with the basics unreal editor for fortnite runs on PC and is</p>
<p>integrated directly with fortnite so you have access to over four years of</p>
<p>content all for free to get you started what&rsquo;s special about uefn is what we</p>
<p>call live edit live edit allows anyone on your team to join a uefn session from</p>
<p>any platform that runs fortnite that means someone can join from a console</p>
<p>using the normal fortnite client and they&rsquo;re able to work alongside and</p>
<p>collaborate with PC users uefn has access to all fortnite creative</p>
<p>devices our modular gameplay systems that work in the in-game editor this</p>
<p>allows you to instantly add gameplay and quickly bootstrap your game from the</p>
<p>hundreds of gameplay devices already available the uefn beta has many of the</p>
<p>same features we use to create fortnite including the landscape editing toolset</p>
<p>you can edit the landscape to change the look of your island or make sweeping</p>
<p>changes to create something completely new and then quickly play it in game to</p>
<p>check out the results so even though you have access to tons</p>
<p>of fortnite content with uefn you can make content that looks nothing like</p>
<p>fortnite this is a section from forest Guardian a</p>
<p>tech demo built in uefn that we are launching today</p>
<p>a big feature of uefn is the ability to import your own custom assets so we used</p>
<p>a few 3D models textures and materials that we built just for the project</p>
<p>and all the lighting in the cave was made possible thanks to Lumen our</p>
<p>real-time Global illumination system you can also find more content like</p>
<p>quicksomega scans and sketchfab models and our initial Alpha release of the Fab</p>
<p>plugin for uefn all assets are curated and optimized for use in fortnite and</p>
<p>the full version of Fab will launch later this year you can also create and</p>
<p>modify materials so you can change the look and feel of objects easily and you</p>
<p>can import skeletal meshes and then animate using sequencer and control rig</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;ve just seen is available today in the public beta version of</p>
<p>unreal editor for fortnite</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a short video of just like the most condensed way we could show</p>
<p>somebody in like the more important workflows but I think a much better way</p>
<p>is to temp fade let&rsquo;s do a live demo on PC running on fortnite public servers</p>
<p>right here on stage welcome Michael and Ray to the stage</p>
<p>take it away [Applause]</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that went well all right hey folks so let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>how all this was made Michael here has the scene open in unreal editor so we</p>
<p>can take a closer look for the environment we built this level using</p>
<p>quixel megascan assets many of which are available in the Fab uefn plugin we also</p>
<p>use custom content that we built just for this demo</p>
<p>for the gameplay you just saw we had we hand placed enemies using a</p>
<p>creative device called a guard spawner which generates the aliens that you saw</p>
<p>at specific locations however we wanted to do more and introduce Dynamic play</p>
<p>that goes beyond what the current creative devices can do</p>
<p>so to do this we used our new programming language called verse</p>
<p>so in this short section of code every second we grab the position of the</p>
<p>player and for each spawn location we then calculate the distance to the</p>
<p>player and if it&rsquo;s within a certain threshold we tell that guard to spawn</p>
<p>into the level so now we have gameplay that&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>reactive to the player&rsquo;s actions this is just a short example of using</p>
<p>verse but for a deeper dive check out the verse Tech talk later today</p>
<p>now Michael is going to show us how we put the intro cinematic together hi</p>
<p>everybody so before the gameplay section we played this quick cinematic animation</p>
<p>this is actually created entirely in uefn using sequencer sequencer is our</p>
<p>multi-track editor and it&rsquo;s been used in everything from in-game cinematics to</p>
<p>Hollywood feature films so let&rsquo;s take a look uh now all of this stuff is</p>
<p>available right inside uefn so let&rsquo;s take a look at this last shot from a</p>
<p>slightly different perspective so the other thing we featured in this</p>
<p>section was a bunch of Niagara Niagara is now available in uefn and it&rsquo;s our</p>
<p>high-end VFX system so and just like in the movies you can</p>
<p>frame up shots and have great effects so what we&rsquo;re going to do here is just set</p>
<p>this up</p>
<p>so just look at the movies you have slow mode too makes everything better right</p>
<p>so this is just a sampling of some of the stuff that you can do inside</p>
<p>sequencer but let&rsquo;s get back to the game all right so now that we&rsquo;re back in the</p>
<p>game in uefn you have access to fortnite&rsquo;s time of day system or you</p>
<p>could use what we did and do what we did and use a completely custom lighting</p>
<p>solution and thanks to Lumen both daytime and night time look great now</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to the final gameplay section and let&rsquo;s close out the demo</p>
<p>but as a reminder everything that you&rsquo;re seeing here was created in the same</p>
<p>version of uefn that we&rsquo;re releasing today I think I&rsquo;m gonna jump in here and</p>
<p>help you right I am all for that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>thanks Michael and Ray anyone everybody that put this together</p>
<p>the the demo came about when we asked the special projects team inside epic</p>
<p>that came straight off the Matrix demo to why don&rsquo;t you put uefn through its</p>
<p>paces and one amazing fact about this demo is that it&rsquo;s less than 400 Megs it</p>
<p>downloads and plays in less than a minute and it plays on any platform that</p>
<p>fortnite runs on like that is the promise of what uafn is</p>
<p>so again on related to fortnite it&rsquo;s available today in public beta in epic</p>
<p>game store if you want an early glimpse of some other technical showcases that</p>
<p>our internal teams made with uefn and verse check out asserted domination</p>
<p>Forest guardian and the space inside all three available to play right now in</p>
<p>fortnite discover so we&rsquo;ve talked about brand new tools</p>
<p>and the fortnite ecosystem now I want to talk about the next generation of</p>
<p>fortnite&rsquo;s economy they&rsquo;re both epic and creators will participate in</p>
<p>we call it create a economy 2.0 here&rsquo;s how it works</p>
<p>the money in the economy comes from player spending in the item shop</p>
<p>fortnite generates billions of dollars a year in revenue from player purchases</p>
<p>fortnite players who have fun engaging in Islands tend to spend more in the</p>
<p>item shop creators who make popular islands are bringing real value to the</p>
<p>fortnite ecosystem and we&rsquo;re going to share the resulting Revenue with them</p>
<p>this is the engine powering a Creator economy 2.0</p>
<p>we believe this so strongly we will distribute 40 percent of fortnite&rsquo;s</p>
<p>global net revenue to eligible creators who publish games in fortnite both</p>
<p>independent developers and Epic anything we make like Battle Royale zero</p>
<p>build also participates in the pool shared with creators this will be the</p>
<p>primary way that epic will pay for our own game development in fortnite going</p>
<p>forward</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you feel it&rsquo;s a big deal that I I feel exhibited</p>
<p>um this is this is transformative and a big gut check for us too we imagine</p>
<p>thousands of third-party development teams building businesses and thriving</p>
<p>with this model payments from the pool are based on</p>
<p>performance of The Island we take into account data like Island popularity</p>
<p>engagement retention attracting new players</p>
<p>and the benefit of this new approach is rooted in player fun and rewards</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s creative work both yours and epics</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no need to design cunning monetization Loops or extractive gating</p>
<p>items you make an island the players love that is all you need to be part of</p>
<p>the new economy Creator economy 2.0 is live right now</p>
<p>for eligible creators who are currently publishing</p>
<p>we are back dating the engagement payouts to the beginning of this month</p>
<p>and for more details and to sign up go to create.fortnite.com</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;ve seen today represents epic&rsquo;s biggest bet ever the release of</p>
<p>advanced tools that publish directly into fortnite on PC console mobile and</p>
<p>Cloud lowering the barrier for developers to be part of one of the</p>
<p>biggest entertainment ecosystems we welcome anyone to join us in the</p>
<p>future where original content is owned by its creators where developer earnings</p>
<p>our function of fun and what ecosystem can be directly linked through Community</p>
<p>language standards like verse so support to support developers who</p>
<p>adopt uefn we&rsquo;re broadening the Epic Mega grants program to help teams</p>
<p>bootstrap projects that use uefn and verse</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just getting started and we hope that you&rsquo;ll join us and help shape the</p>
<p>future of development now we&rsquo;re going to give you a look at</p>
<p>what uefn can do right inside fortnite after the video Tim is going to come</p>
<p>back out to talk about epic&rsquo;s Future Vision thank you very much</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>thanks we think this is going to be a really powerful combination putting</p>
<p>together a fortnight 70 million monthly active users with the power of the</p>
<p>unreal editor and a new Creator economy to share the revenue with creators</p>
<p>through great engaging experiences and it&rsquo;s another Milestone on the path to a</p>
<p>new kind of entertainment medium which science fiction literature calls the</p>
<p>metaverse because there&rsquo;s a crazy amount of hype</p>
<p>around this whole topic I&rsquo;d like to step back and take a long-term look at what</p>
<p>we see here and the core of it is some very real</p>
<p>growth starting with fortnite 70 million monthly active users Roblox is 250</p>
<p>million monthly active users Minecraft&rsquo;s 100 million and pubg mobile and Apex</p>
<p>Legends and numerous other metaverse inspired games is leading to an</p>
<p>identifiable audience today of over 600 million active users in these Virtual</p>
<p>Worlds and it&rsquo;s on a growth trajectory they will put it at billions of users by</p>
<p>the end of this decade and so we can set aside the crazy hype</p>
<p>cycle around nfts and VR goggles you know these Technologies may play a role</p>
<p>in the future but they are not required this revolution is happening right now</p>
<p>and the core of it is something every gamer already understands it&rsquo;s you and</p>
<p>your friends getting together online and going around as a group on voice chat</p>
<p>having a fun time and social entertainment experiences and some of</p>
<p>these experiences are serious games like Battle Royale some of them are going to</p>
<p>a concert and dancing or chatting with friends and just having a good time</p>
<p>we see this as the next big changing change in gaming and an epic&rsquo;s Evolution</p>
<p>as a company you know we started out back in 1991</p>
<p>making 2D games uh we recognize the opportunity with 3D so we vote the first</p>
<p>Unreal Engine and the first Unreal Tournament game we evolved to make</p>
<p>console games like Gears of War then we evolved to make online games like</p>
<p>Paragon and fortnite but when fortnite shipped first in 2017</p>
<p>it was just our game uh but over time we recognized the audience the opportunity</p>
<p>to bring it to a much wider audience so we built fortnite creative mode</p>
<p>um and then the unreal editor for fortnite coming out now but we see the</p>
<p>future of this medium primarily not about epic&rsquo;s work but about the work of</p>
<p>independent creators and we&rsquo;re building towards the sofa</p>
<p>metaverse from two different directions first of all we&rsquo;re taking the fortnite</p>
<p>audience we have and enhancing the development capabilities with the new</p>
<p>tools and this Creator economy to support everybody&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also helping Developers boning Standalone products evolved</p>
<p>towards building metaverse experiences themselves the Unreal Engine is a tool</p>
<p>for this the epic game store is a distribution vehicle for it epic online</p>
<p>services has taken fortnite an epic 700 million player accounts and 5 billion</p>
<p>social connections and open them up for free to all developers so they can plug</p>
<p>into voice chat and participate in these social experiences in a very easy to use</p>
<p>way and all of these are on-ramps to the Future metaverse</p>
<p>we really think that over the next decade today&rsquo;s separate apps and</p>
<p>ecosystems are going to join together to form tomorrow&rsquo;s open metaverse</p>
<p>and yeah because the last couple decades have been about wall Gardens wall</p>
<p>Gardens wall Gardens let&rsquo;s back up and talk about how open systems have</p>
<p>successfully come about in the past you know this has happened really big time</p>
<p>back in the early 1980s and 1990s when the open internet was built</p>
<p>you know back in those days there were a bunch of closed networks at different</p>
<p>companies and universities that couldn&rsquo;t talk to each other</p>
<p>and so the industry got together and defined Open Standards connect these</p>
<p>closed networks into one big open network the connected email systems by</p>
<p>playing the at sign and email addresses so people on One service could</p>
<p>communicate with people on other services and then they began to Define</p>
<p>Open Standards like JavaScript and HTML for the open internet so any user could</p>
<p>participate and the rule at that point was that any company could connect as an</p>
<p>equal into this system just by following the Open Standards</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s talk about what this means for the open metaverse of the future</p>
<p>you know we have the opportunity to take all these different online ecosystems</p>
<p>for gaming consoles and Publishers and connect them together into a single</p>
<p>place where anybody can talk to anybody else</p>
<p>we have the opportunity to turn today&rsquo;s game engines into tomorrow is metaverse</p>
<p>browser engines if you take a look at Unreal Engine and</p>
<p>unity and Godot you have some very powerful 3D engines that have an</p>
<p>increasingly common set of features and increasingly adopting industry standards</p>
<p>is ways of communicating with each other and with other tools there&rsquo;s the glotf</p>
<p>content standards there&rsquo;s Pixar&rsquo;s Universal C in description format and</p>
<p>then there are a lot of new standards bodies that have formed to help to</p>
<p>standardize some adverse there&rsquo;s Cronus group there&rsquo;s the metaverse standards</p>
<p>form there&rsquo;s the academy software foundation and the open 3D Foundation</p>
<p>and we have the opportunity for all developers to work together to define</p>
<p>the future of this thing and there&rsquo;s also the opportunity to</p>
<p>connect the economies of these different ecosystems you know what a user would</p>
<p>really like is to be able to buy a cool looking outfit in one place and take it</p>
<p>everywhere they go unless we were designing this new</p>
<p>fortnite Creator economy one of the things we were constantly thinking about</p>
<p>is how this could in the future be connected into an open metaverse economy</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no reason that the core model there in which revenue from item</p>
<p>shops are shared with creators of experience based on engagement couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be turned into an economic model for the open metaverse at large with economic</p>
<p>peering and overseen by governance groups to make this work in a safe way</p>
<p>for all players and this gets us to a really key</p>
<p>question here and that is who is going to build the metaverse in the future</p>
<p>and we believe the answer has to be all of us together it has to be a</p>
<p>combination of indie game developers together with double A and AAA game</p>
<p>developers and fortnite creators and Minecraft creators and Roblox creators</p>
<p>each bringing their best specialized knowledge to the to the new world and</p>
<p>Brands like Disney and Ferrari and Ralph Lauren have already experienced the</p>
<p>metaverse through crossovers with fortnite we think this is just the very</p>
<p>beginning of a very long-term opportunity for all these companies tell</p>
<p>that if a much larger presence in the digital world in which it becomes a</p>
<p>major and first class business line for all of them uh future open metavers will</p>
<p>be about musicians and music labels and film and television Studios who are</p>
<p>using virtual production today to build world-class photorealistic content being</p>
<p>able to bring it and launch it playly in the metaverse timed together with their</p>
<p>film and television experiences in an endless stream of awesome entertainment</p>
<p>content that&rsquo;s open to everybody to participate in</p>
<p>now epic has a long history of supporting developers this way you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve built a lot of different services that are available to everybody to use</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the Unreal Engine there&rsquo;s epic online services which are open to all</p>
<p>platforms and all stores there&rsquo;s the epic game store which is open to</p>
<p>software built on all engines using all different online services and we believe</p>
<p>the metaverse has to be opened it can&rsquo;t be another monopoly&rsquo;s wall Garden</p>
<p>and epic is all in on this you know we went from the</p>
<p>uh you know we went from the pandemic to the tech downturn the crypto implosion</p>
<p>and now banks are failing and it&rsquo;s a really crazy time again but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>investing very heavily in the future with the belief that companies who</p>
<p>invest now through these hard times are going to come out the strongest company</p>
<p>in the future become the strongest companies in the future</p>
<p>some of these Investments we&rsquo;re making in fortnite initially and then bringing</p>
<p>the work to Unreal Engine some things were building an Unreal Engine taking to</p>
<p>fortnite but the aim is to support everything the AAA game developers are</p>
<p>doing today and more in this project to build this all out</p>
<p>into an open system is going to take most of the decade and that is the</p>
<p>journey from Unreal Engine 5 to Unreal Engine 6. that will happen over this</p>
<p>time period it is the same Journey to the open metaverse but there&rsquo;s no need</p>
<p>to wait because we&rsquo;re doing it live we&rsquo;re building all these systems and</p>
<p>deploying them as we build them right into Unreal Engine 5 openly with</p>
<p>Partners so we hope you&rsquo;ll download this stuff download on your editor for</p>
<p>fortnite download the Unreal Engine and get started and come see some of our</p>
<p>Tech talks where you talk about this in way more technical detail thank you very</p>
<p>much for your time</p>
<p>thank you</p>
