    <p>my body is a wonderland if that wonderland is white soft and mushy sure and hairy too</p>
<p>you know the worst thing about skin on skin sleeping with the newborn is that</p>
<p>you know sometimes she roots and she goes after the man the male nip</p>
<p>i know problem is my nipples covered in hair it&rsquo;s really awkward for everybody</p>
<p>did you start gagging i&rsquo;ll tell telly that story when she&rsquo;s 18 we&rsquo;re at her wedding it&rsquo;ll be even</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>hey everybody welcome to another episode of the all in podcast i am wearing a blue shirt</p>
<p>i am a pasty white old greek man uh who&rsquo;s balding and obnoxious and uh with me today</p>
<p>is uh no no no you have to you have to say your pronoun bro am i oh and my pronouns are</p>
<p>uh oh wait what are my pronouns my pronouns are beep beep and most people just call me a jerk</p>
<p>with me today of course is my sri lankan urkel looking wearing a furry sweater</p>
<p>hello everybody my name is chamath i have uh salt and pepper black hair</p>
<p>brown eyes uh i am tall uh six foot two i go by the pronouns we king and stud muffin</p>
<p>and uh i&rsquo;m here to talk to you about internet security protocols</p>
<p>what i look like urkel i think people should just come up and say</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t look like the closest i don&rsquo;t look like urkel i look like a bollywood when you put</p>
<p>your glass you&rsquo;re kind of like the sri lankan urkel to us welcome to the all in podcast two</p>
<p>out of the four of us are canceled next up for cancellation sax yes i&rsquo;m coming to you here from</p>
<p>the floor of the new york stock exchange which was once land that belonged to the mohegan the montauk</p>
<p>the oneida the erie and the arokoi tribes</p>
<p>since time immemorial</p>
<p>you forgot the irish we own the seven points oh my god you really did it you went for it sax i love</p>
<p>you i&rsquo;m isn&rsquo;t it important that we at any moment that we&rsquo;re successful we have to flagellate</p>
<p>ourselves or remind ourselves that at one time all this land was owned by somebody else we stole</p>
<p>it also the greeks conquered the romans and so i&rsquo;d like to apologize for that but you forgot</p>
<p>to mention you&rsquo;re also wearing a brooks brothers shirt that is four sizes too large this is my slim</p>
<p>fit so that slim fit oh no here we go again sax has been upgrading the wardrobe he&rsquo;s changing</p>
<p>wait before free bird does the intro jk you want to tell them why we&rsquo;re doing these intros like</p>
<p>this yeah i gotta pause before okay yesterday on the internet emerged a series of videos</p>
<p>that were clipped of microsoft presenting their new suite of developer tools yada yada</p>
<p>and corporate people got up and without any explanation started describing their physical</p>
<p>appearance their pronouns their ethnicity their skin tone and their hairstyles and the entire</p>
<p>internet was like oh my god this is crazy woke ism like what what is happening here this no i thought</p>
<p>it was a skit i thought it was a saturday night live skit and so right and so then as soon as they</p>
<p>got called out by the entire internet they claimed that they were doing this for visually impaired</p>
<p>people which kind of begs the question of why visually impaired people need to know what race</p>
<p>you are like it&rsquo;s still playing into this like crazy weight race consciousness but then on top</p>
<p>of it it wasn&rsquo;t just that we know it&rsquo;s not that because then they start doing but hold on also if</p>
<p>you if you&rsquo;re blind and technically can&rsquo;t see you may not even know what blue means because you will</p>
<p>have never seen the color blue or blonde okay right right but they were also identifying their races</p>
<p>which kind of begs the question of why that&rsquo;s important but if you were born blind you would</p>
<p>not know what that means either you&rsquo;re literally colorblind putting you on the same footing as</p>
<p>people who are not visually impaired i&rsquo;m saying i&rsquo;m saying if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re visually impaired</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using the wrong language that language is for the sighted people okay but i i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>calling bullshit on their stated explanation that it has anything to do with visually impaired</p>
<p>because then they went on to basically recite the names of 10 tribes native american tribes</p>
<p>on on which the microsoft campus it used to belong to so which is why i was kind of making</p>
<p>fun of that in my initial statement but so look this is just woke capitalism this is</p>
<p>woke ism out of control obviously they didn&rsquo;t see the election results earlier in the week it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clearly there was some level of virtue signaling i think in their defense they were trying to do it</p>
<p>i think for the visually impaired the problem was they didn&rsquo;t explain the context and they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give instructions to the people on what to do so the people came out but jk that video that was a</p>
<p>clip pulled out of a broader context to you right so like apparently this is common on campus or</p>
<p>common there that this is happening all over so we just know it isn&rsquo;t common because i asked people</p>
<p>online well it was optional it was optional it&rsquo;s optional apparently to the common point i think</p>
<p>the reason the internet reacted the way it was was i asked every single person who came at me</p>
<p>because the woke left came at me i just said can you show me another clip of this on youtube of</p>
<p>any event where this occurred and nobody could so i think this was kind of a first when did you</p>
<p>stop being a member of that woke left jk what was the moment like the hysterical side i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>been for bernie i&rsquo;ve never been for elizabeth ward i&rsquo;ve always been moderate always wait can</p>
<p>i hear freeberg&rsquo;s intro yeah freeberg can we hear yours my identity is an illusion it&rsquo;s an illusion</p>
<p>created by the viewer and you can call me whatever you want i sit on the ground where during the</p>
<p>haitian period there was lava and magma and nothing but co2 and methane and i represent those</p>
<p>gases that are now lost to the oxygenation and the cyanobacteria that swarmed over this earth</p>
<p>and took everything over and led to the formation of eukaryotic life and here we all sit today in</p>
<p>our privileged existence thank you are you saying that you want to freeberg is just electrons hitting</p>
<p>neurons in interesting ways yeah no he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s like it it his pronouns are his pronouns are</p>
<p>proton and dark matter biochemical quantum bath fuzz quantum foam is my pronoun so would you like</p>
<p>to formally apologize for colonizing the dark matter during the big bang now or would you like</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t fair when the cyanobacteria took over the the face of the earth</p>
<p>and sucked up all the co2 and created all the oxygen and and for that we all apologize</p>
<p>for the genocide of for the genocide of co2 and methane i mean those molecules were really happy</p>
<p>and they had a you know they had a very kind of like peaceful existence on this earth</p>
<p>and you know cyanobacteria just came in and ripped it away cyanobacteria just took it all</p>
<p>away from there and you know and then the offspring ended up being us and here we are so apologies</p>
<p>all right all right welcome to episode 54 everybody&rsquo;s cancelled the final episode</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think that the microsoft thing was bad when you hear the broader context it was like</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s just you know i think it&rsquo;s a reasonable thing that visually impaired people</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still long microsoft and google and short the rest of big tech so i&rsquo;m fine with it there you go</p>
<p>back to the stock price did i actually i jamaat do you think that the google long netflix short</p>
<p>play is the right play i think the best i think the best trade on the best trade on the internet</p>
<p>the most obvious simple money-making trade is long microsoft google short big tech short the</p>
<p>rest of big tech short ibm short netflix no no no short no no meaning you can you can very</p>
<p>comfortably short apple facebook amazon netflix and be long microsoft google so as a spread trade</p>
<p>right right it&rsquo;s the most it&rsquo;s the best risk parity trade on the internet right now i mean</p>
<p>period in the markets can you explain explain the spread trade so look look i i tweeted this a while</p>
<p>ago but it&rsquo;s like and and again the i i think like well let me be constructive and say the</p>
<p>people on twitter that respond to these threads are not totally stupid although i think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of idiotic um i said you know here&rsquo;s how you can effectively you know i i said something about</p>
<p>you know big tech and i said oh i can comfortably put my short on and i&rsquo;m kind of trolling people</p>
<p>when i do that because i&rsquo;m not telling them the full trade and the real trade whenever you put</p>
<p>anything on in my opinion is all about managing risk and the best thing about the internet and</p>
<p>the stock market is that you know when you&rsquo;re betting on internet stocks you don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>have to be naked long or naked short which comes with a lot more risk than if you were long one</p>
<p>security and short another against it so for example over the last 10 years you would have</p>
<p>made a lot of money by being long amazon and short a basket of traditional commerce companies</p>
<p>offline commerce i&rsquo;m going to make up a basket but macy&rsquo;s jc penny you know kmart sears right</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re short those and long amazon that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called a spread trade you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>playing the gap between your longs and your shorts it&rsquo;s independent of where the market</p>
<p>generally trades it&rsquo;s one of the irrelevant of the market you&rsquo;re basically saying those</p>
<p>stocks could go up but just not everything could go near amazon yeah when you put that trade on</p>
<p>for example it&rsquo;s i&rsquo;m going to bet that if everything goes up amazon will go up more</p>
<p>than kmart walmart sears and if the stock market goes down amazon won&rsquo;t go down that much but these</p>
<p>ones will go down a lot and you you&rsquo;re playing the spread so just to just to be very explicit</p>
<p>you know there was a very and i talked about this last week but i that this idea wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mine it&rsquo;s a borrowed trade from somebody who&rsquo;s a very well-known hedge fund manager</p>
<p>who put it on in massive size and you know to be honest not knowing much of anything i just</p>
<p>copied it but he&rsquo;s his initial trade was long google short facebook and that trade basically</p>
<p>was at parity which meant that the long and the short cancelled each other out for about the last</p>
<p>four years until the last year it completely blew out and it returned about 80 85 so if you had put</p>
<p>a hundred dollars in you would have made about 85 uh 85 bucks on this trade by being long google</p>
<p>short facebook the the bigger trade at scale is actually long google and microsoft and short the</p>
<p>rest of big tech and there&rsquo;s a lot of vagaries why that this idea makes a lot of sense but what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying is they&rsquo;ll outperform the other basket of tech on a relative basis on a relative</p>
<p>basis so so it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re saying airbnb can&rsquo;t go up or facebook can&rsquo;t go up it could it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to go as well he&rsquo;s saying he&rsquo;s saying that the the trillion dollar market cap companies</p>
<p>yeah not the airbnb oh okay and the reason and the reason why focusing there makes sense is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hyper liquid markets they have tremendous ways in which you can have massive size on so you</p>
<p>could put a trade of 10 billion long versus 10 billion short i mean you can put mega size on on</p>
<p>these things if you if you have real conviction and then the third thing is when the banks look</p>
<p>at that kind of position they actually from a risk management perspective treated differently</p>
<p>than if you were just naked long any one of these things or make it long would be just making one</p>
<p>bet yeah or you know or naked short which is even more dangerous so because if the market collapses</p>
<p>by 30 both stocks might go down 30 roughly but one will go down 32 and the other one will go</p>
<p>down 28 and so you&rsquo;re really only down two percent two percent as opposed to the 30 if</p>
<p>so all the market risk is taken out when you make trades like that</p>
<p>yeah the reason it&rsquo;s possible also today to do so at such a scale right chamath is</p>
<p>interest rates are so low so when you borrow on margin to go long the rate is very low and</p>
<p>when you short the stock if it&rsquo;s a highly liquid stock it doesn&rsquo;t cost a lot to borrow to short</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so your actual you know uh carrying cost on that trade ends up being pretty low</p>
<p>relative to the upside you expect so just to just to give you a sense of it my um you know</p>
<p>when i tweeted that tweet out to complete the picture i was actually long something against</p>
<p>my proposed short and i put it on in pretty meaningful leverage and it&rsquo;s worked out really</p>
<p>well because i was playing the spread i was basically betting that you know the the safest</p>
<p>company on the internet today is google because they&rsquo;re both a platform company and to the extent</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re at risk at being an app company the risk is to apple but because they pay apple so</p>
<p>much for search they&rsquo;re inoculated and so in many ways google is the safest and it&rsquo;s also as we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>said before the purest money-making machine on the internet you&rsquo;re referring of course to google</p>
<p>paying apple 10 billion dollars to be the default search in they own android so one platform and on</p>
<p>the other platform they they pay them so much that they&rsquo;re going to be always protected and</p>
<p>the second best company is microsoft and you we even saw it by the way this past week i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you guys saw but but microsoft decided to take a broadside attack against notion yeah that is a</p>
<p>productivity app that&rsquo;s been growing very well i felt this when i was on the board of slack when</p>
<p>microsoft put its gun sights on us we always thought that they could not out compete with</p>
<p>us and what it turns out is when you have a massive distribution advantage feature parity</p>
<p>is enough and you can actually be slightly less than good enough on the features because</p>
<p>distribution and bundling and packaging overpower a customer&rsquo;s desire to adopt a product so in the</p>
<p>case of slack it was very difficult i think for us to compete against microsoft&rsquo;s bundling</p>
<p>of teams with all this other software that they were selling and all the discounting that they</p>
<p>could do made it very difficult for us to compete because we had a single product and lo and behold</p>
<p>18 months later the only real long-term protective solution for slack shareholders was to basically</p>
<p>get bought by salesforce so that you could be part of a bigger hole this past week microsoft</p>
<p>decided to go after notion and it&rsquo;s going to be i think a very similar story where you know once</p>
<p>they decide to sort of go after this a product experience they only need to be 80 as good and</p>
<p>then the distribution and bundling and packaging will take care of the other 20 it doesn&rsquo;t kill</p>
<p>the other company but it creates headwinds that massive headwinds because because a company like</p>
<p>notion cannot be fully valued over long periods of time simply being an smb company you at a</p>
<p>minimum you&rsquo;ll have to move into the mid-market you may necessarily never have to go to the</p>
<p>enterprise but you probably have to go to the mid-market and in that is a very troublesome</p>
<p>path because microsoft has so much you know uh tent so many tentacles inside of those businesses</p>
<p>so anyways basically the long microsoft long google is a pretty obvious kind of like monopolistic</p>
<p>you know pair trade the question is what do you short against it so that you can take up the</p>
<p>market volatility and you can play spread again apple has severe you know headwinds with respect</p>
<p>to inflation pressures and margins and supply chain issues amazon has pretty meaningful</p>
<p>headwinds now relative to pricing power and competition facebook has pressure with respect</p>
<p>to regulatory oversight i just came up with one what about airbnb versus the airline you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about smaller rinky dink ideas listen i&rsquo;m not playing the same chip stack issue</p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t there on tuesday night i&rsquo;m on a thursday night so no no that&rsquo;d be a good spread for me</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s a stupid idea and i&rsquo;ll tell you why okay if you&rsquo;re gonna put these things on go to</p>
<p>where the deepest liquid markets are because those are the safest okay right like like don&rsquo;t try to</p>
<p>be different being the same here tell me why airbnb which is a incredible margin business</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredibly well run and growing versus airlines which are horribly run and low margin</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t that be a good spread trade i&rsquo;m just thinking i think it&rsquo;s a very very two you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>picking two random companies out of a hat well no they&rsquo;re both in uh transportation and vacation</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re completely different businesses with completely different motivations with different</p>
<p>capital pools with different people that own the stock there&rsquo;s no point trying to get cute on these</p>
<p>things my point is if you really want to be hedged against market risk got it go to where it&rsquo;s safest</p>
<p>find the simplest most obvious thing don&rsquo;t overthink it or don&rsquo;t put it on</p>
<p>so another obvious one here&rsquo;s it here&rsquo;s it so obvious is within big tech figure out which ones</p>
<p>you want to be long which ones you want to be short that&rsquo;s a spread trade that over the next</p>
<p>four or five years where if you expect a lot of market volatility it makes sense to maybe put some</p>
<p>of this kind of stuff on right a different version of this idea which makes sense is in autos again</p>
<p>trillions of dollars of market cap and you can make a decision do i want to be long tesla lucid and</p>
<p>rivian and short the traditional autos that could be a trade you know but trying to like trying to</p>
<p>go after like let me pick airbnb versus united airlines is too random for me and i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re correlated enough for it to make any sense all right speaking of the stock market sax</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the background of the new york stock exchange as your zoom background today</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that about yeah so bird listed on the new york stock exchange today this is a company that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been involved in pretty much since the beginning we led the series a round back in</p>
<p>2017 it was actually the first check i wrote as a vc to lead around at craft and four years later</p>
<p>public company on the new york stock exchange pretty amazing and so you&rsquo;re literally at the</p>
<p>new york stock exchange as we speak first remote bestie yes and you can see behind me um that is</p>
<p>the floor of the new york stock exchange it&rsquo;s not like you know if you&rsquo;ve seen the movie trading</p>
<p>places it&rsquo;s not like that anymore there are no stock brokers there&rsquo;s no like paper flying around</p>
<p>got it i&rsquo;m not really sure what the purpose of all those monitors are down there i feels to me a</p>
<p>little bit like a movie set it is like a movie set yes yeah and so people like us come here to</p>
<p>record things but um as we all know the all the trades are really happening inside giant machines</p>
<p>can you turn around and just start yelling booyah booyah and let&rsquo;s see if security comes in</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m in i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m elevated above the floor no one can really hear me i&rsquo;m in like this uh sort</p>
<p>of broadcast booth uh so take us behind the decision to go public as a four-year-old company</p>
<p>we were expecting you know uh airbnb ubers and lyfts took over 10 years to go public now here</p>
<p>we are sitting on a four-year-old public company is that a good thing a bad thing something in</p>
<p>between and how does the the board and the management team make that decision to go public</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s a good thing um because the company well the company wanted to i think it had the</p>
<p>opportunity to it um it grew very very quickly before covid then you had covid was like sort of</p>
<p>a huge setback they i mean basically the scooter industry just stopped for at least six months</p>
<p>because of lockdowns but then coming out of covid they bounced back really strongly they kind of</p>
<p>pivoted their model to what&rsquo;s called a fleet manager model where basically they&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>a business in a box for a local operator a local entrepreneur to buy the scooters with financing</p>
<p>and manage the fleet themselves so it&rsquo;s a much more highly virtualized model uh and so as a</p>
<p>result of that in q2 they just did 60 million in revenue in the last quarter and i think um</p>
<p>it was gross profit of something like 27 percent and uh it was had a loss of like 12 million so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very very close to getting to profitability and uh you know the company&rsquo;s only four years old</p>
<p>you know it took uber 12 years or whatever to get to be public so it&rsquo;s been pretty it&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>pretty amazing ride there&rsquo;s been a lot of big ups and downs but uh so it&rsquo;s kind of a pretty sweet</p>
<p>event what is it trading under now i know it was switchback was like the spack name right so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>today was the first day i started trading under the ticker symbol brds i guess all birds took</p>
<p>bird so we took brds and um you know there&rsquo;s a total number of shares outstanding of i want</p>
<p>to say roughly 300 million so it&rsquo;s about a 2.4 billion dollar market cap you know as it stands</p>
<p>right now which you know for a series a investor is pretty great really happy for you sexy yeah</p>
<p>yeah congratulations it&rsquo;s great congrats dude we heard last week sequoia is going to do the</p>
<p>sequoia fund this evergreen fund keep owning shares now as a vc um do you distribute after</p>
<p>four years of this investment and you made multiple investments or do you make the decision</p>
<p>hey we think it&rsquo;s undervalued we have you know conviction in the company we were going to be in</p>
<p>it for 10 years or do you just take the quick win and give everybody their shares well i&rsquo;ve i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve agreed to be on the board for the next year so you know i&rsquo;m planning to do that and or we have</p>
<p>a traditional six month lockup and so at that point we&rsquo;d have to make a decision about when</p>
<p>or how much to distribute the shares and this is the first time we&rsquo;ve been confronted with</p>
<p>the decision i mean craft ventures is only a four-year-old firm and like i said this is</p>
<p>actually the first round that i led as a vc so it&rsquo;s the first time we&rsquo;ve been confronted with</p>
<p>a distribution of this magnitude we&rsquo;ve had some smaller distributions so yeah we still have to</p>
<p>make those decisions we haven&rsquo;t decided yet what we&rsquo;re going to do if you if the stock is up let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say meaningfully in the next six months and you get to that you know six months and a day and you</p>
<p>have the ability to distribute and it&rsquo;s up 25 and you&rsquo;re looking at it business is thriving</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the board do you consider holding for a year or two so that you can distribute at $16</p>
<p>$25 or whatever your price target is maybe i mean we haven&rsquo;t got we haven&rsquo;t gotten to that point yet</p>
<p>so yeah i mean i guess what i would say is that our bias would be to distribute shares to our lps</p>
<p>so that they can make their own decisions about whether they&rsquo;re told or not as long as we think</p>
<p>the stock is you know price fairly if for some reason we thought it wasn&rsquo;t then there&rsquo;d be an</p>
<p>additional reason to hold on to it and make the distribution later chamath what are your thoughts</p>
<p>on this given it&rsquo;s come up before and a number of us are going to be faced with this decision</p>
<p>and then we see sequoia has got lp buy-in for an evergreen fund well i think an evergreen fund is</p>
<p>different from having to figure out how to do distributions so they&rsquo;re solving for two different</p>
<p>ideas the evergreen fund is really good because you don&rsquo;t have to do this continual fundraising</p>
<p>process and you can basically roll gains back into the next tranche of invested companies</p>
<p>in an easier way i like that idea it was pretty rare at the time i remember when i was starting</p>
<p>social capital the only fund that did it really well was sutter hill and for a whole host of</p>
<p>reasons i decided to not do an evergreen fund in hindsight i think for me that turned out to be</p>
<p>better because then it was easier for me to wind down and have a clear demarcation of when it was</p>
<p>just myself and other lps versus when it was just my capital but there were some really good reasons</p>
<p>to do it the hardest thing i think that sequoia is going to find in this new iteration is at some</p>
<p>point somebody&rsquo;s reputation will be on the line for judging public equities and it&rsquo;s still not</p>
<p>clear to me that people who live and breathe venture can context switch well enough to then</p>
<p>live and breathe public equity so just the best example i would say is like tiger global when you</p>
<p>look inside that organization which is incredibly well run there are two superb investors that carve</p>
<p>the universe up right you have chase goldman that runs a public book and you have scott schleifer</p>
<p>that runs a private book what does it prove to me it proves that it&rsquo;s just very hard to find a</p>
<p>person that can do both and the context switching is very complicated so maybe sequoia finds</p>
<p>an incredible public market strategist that can then manage these positions</p>
<p>otherwise but they&rsquo;ve done this for a few years right they&rsquo;ve um sequoia i don&rsquo;t know people</p>
<p>realize this they set up the heritage fund and they set it up with only gps money it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>billions under management and it&rsquo;s been making late stage private but mostly public equity</p>
<p>investing i know but that&rsquo;s a fund of funds what i&rsquo;m saying is i&rsquo;ll be very honest with you if i</p>
<p>was an lp of sequoia i would want the money back and the reason is i&rsquo;m not sure that sequoia can</p>
<p>compound money in the public markets anywhere near what i could so do you buy the point that</p>
<p>they make that like exiting some of these left most of the you know kind of value creation on</p>
<p>the table i think what they&rsquo;re saying something much more subtle which is they exited and they</p>
<p>have regrets for selling you have to remember when sequoia distributed google every single</p>
<p>partner got google shares now had they held those shares they wouldn&rsquo;t be saying any of this and</p>
<p>famously i&rsquo;ll tell you when they held their shares well i know that well i actually do</p>
<p>fair enough but maybe they did maybe they didn&rsquo;t but let&rsquo;s just let&rsquo;s just put it out there that</p>
<p>for example i know explicitly when i almost merged social capital with cliner perkins like</p>
<p>six years ago i spent so much time with john door the most incredible thing that i was so</p>
<p>impressed with door was he was he told me he had never sold a single share of amazon that was</p>
<p>distributed to him and he had only sold a handful of shares of google only to fund future capital</p>
<p>requirements of at cliner at the time so i just think that ultimately i think probably what</p>
<p>sequoia was saying is man i wish i had not sold my google shares when they were distributed to me</p>
<p>because otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t make that claim no i think what they&rsquo;re saying is more subtle i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re saying us our lps should have held them we are on the board of these companies from</p>
<p>day one we have better insights in the second decade than in the first production board founder</p>
<p>david friedberg how do you think about early exits distributing capital because you do have</p>
<p>also with a startup studio structure which you should explain to the audience how a startup</p>
<p>studio works because you create companies which is you know was a terrible place to be maybe five</p>
<p>or ten years ago but it turns out you&rsquo;re in the best place because zero to one is where all the</p>
<p>values created explain the two things what a startup studio is for people who don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and then what&rsquo;s your view of selling early if a company of yours goes uh public i think there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>big um there&rsquo;s a bigger kind of framing here which is a lot of um investors uh you know</p>
<p>professional money managers have tried to find ways to create what is called permanent capital</p>
<p>which is a vehicle whereby they can continuously make investments decide when to sell those</p>
<p>investments and recycle the capital into new investments with the idea being that over time</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not at risk of capital outflows meaning investors pull their money out and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>at risk of uh you know needing to kind of go out and raise more money and they can they can share</p>
<p>in the value creation as they grow their book value over time years ago a bunch of hedge funds set up</p>
<p>public reinsurance companies dan lobe did this um uh what&rsquo;s his name einhorn did this</p>
<p>and basically bill ackman did it what they did is they set up a public company a new public company</p>
<p>a reinsurer and then they use that that reinsurer to underwrite reinsurance and when you underwrite</p>
<p>reinsurance you get all this capital that you can then go invest and then the hedge fund manage that</p>
<p>investment and because it&rsquo;s actually a public company it&rsquo;s got a balance sheet the um the</p>
<p>shareholders can&rsquo;t pull their money out right it&rsquo;s just got a balance sheet and the hedge fund</p>
<p>was managing that balance sheet and you know generating good returns and this is effectively</p>
<p>what warren buffett does and everyone looks to berkshire hathaway and warren buffett it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>the you know the the the key kind of long term here um which is uh hey look if you can keep</p>
<p>investing and keep compounding value this thing can grow you know exponentially over time so you</p>
<p>know the way we set up the production board i had the option of raising a fund and being a fund</p>
<p>manager i chose to set up the production board because i was much more interested in i think the</p>
<p>similar sort of vein of what sequoia is saying which is like how do you become a longer term</p>
<p>uh builder and a longer term holder and where you don&rsquo;t have these incentives to return capital</p>
<p>because you only get paid if and when you return capital and um you know and then you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>making these decisions to you know because your shareholders are saying well you had a good return</p>
<p>quickly give me the shares back and let me and mark your profit and take your share and i was</p>
<p>also more interested in look the fact is over time there&rsquo;s always going to be opportunities to</p>
<p>chase with the capital so if we have a great gain if something works out really well we can take the</p>
<p>the gain and we can reinvest that capital and building new things there&rsquo;s no shortage of</p>
<p>opportunities to pursue for the rest of my life so that&rsquo;s why i set up the production board</p>
<p>initially in partnership with alphabet and then later on we brought in you know bill gates and</p>
<p>other allen and co and other kind of investors that have a similar sort of mindset which is</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s just if we have an exit recycle that capital and continuously because they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>looking for a quick win they don&rsquo;t have pension payments to make right they don&rsquo;t have a reason</p>
<p>to distribute cash and so same with me like i don&rsquo;t have a reason to take cash out so the objective</p>
<p>was just build this thing over time and grow value over time and that&rsquo;s why i set it up the way i did</p>
<p>and i think it allows us to make you know really long-term bets that are super risky</p>
<p>most of what we&rsquo;re doing is super technical and difficult and maybe very hard to pull off</p>
<p>many of which are still after many years in a very early stage very patient capital</p>
<p>patient capital and also the you know the preference for not trying to find exits but</p>
<p>i have found this i&rsquo;ll tell you one thing i have been through a number of circumstances where i</p>
<p>have seen businesses i&rsquo;ve been an investor in or involved in that have traded long-term value for</p>
<p>short-term opportunity meaning there&rsquo;s an opportunity to make a business that you can</p>
<p>then go raise capital against you change your strategy to do that then you go raise vc funding</p>
<p>and now the business looks like it&rsquo;s working but the 10x or 100x opportunity was taken off the</p>
<p>table because you ended up going down this different path that was a sure thing that</p>
<p>was more likely to work that created value in the short term that allowed you to mark up your</p>
<p>investment or raise capital against that but you gave up the big long-term thing and i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something i&rsquo;ve been trying to avoid with the structure and it certainly makes sense with</p>
<p>some of these other folks and what they&rsquo;re trying to do so what we&rsquo;re getting at here sax is</p>
<p>decision making by capital allocators and on behalf of their lps or letting the lps make</p>
<p>those decisions inevitably the crypto world says well why aren&rsquo;t you just doing this in a dow</p>
<p>and you know having some decentralized authority make the decisions i had vinny ling i&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>conversation with our friend vinny lingham uh after the solana stuff and and and uh multi-coin capital</p>
<p>and we were talking about dows for early stage investing or syndicates and</p>
<p>just brainstorming hey is there a way to do this and the problem i came to every time was</p>
<p>should a bunch of folks be making decisions who are not meeting with the companies or meeting with</p>
<p>2 000 companies a year what are your thoughts on a dow um representing sort of what we collectively</p>
<p>do but we all do it obviously in different flavors does this actually exist yep well</p>
<p>there have been dows that have existed to vote on buying nfts so yes for collectibles i mean i</p>
<p>kind of feel like i&rsquo;ll let you know when it actually gets here so open-minded to it but</p>
<p>who knows yeah but i mean we talk about these things as if they already are here and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not quite here i mean technically i know they they exist but people haven&rsquo;t really figured out how to</p>
<p>use them to you know to be a fund manager for example i think david&rsquo;s right i think the look i</p>
<p>there are these three immutable features of web 3.0 that we&rsquo;re going to have to figure out over</p>
<p>the next few years so the obvious ones are decentralization right that makes sense the</p>
<p>second obvious one is the level of composability which means that you&rsquo;re plug and play with</p>
<p>everything but the third one is this idea of democratization and governance right and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where dows come in and david&rsquo;s right we don&rsquo;t really know what the boundaries of that feature</p>
<p>is i think it exists in some small level scale but we need to have many iterations of companies</p>
<p>get built to figure out what it&rsquo;ll mean so i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;m taking a pretty traditional approach</p>
<p>jason which is that you know it&rsquo;s kind of like a crawl walk run strategy right now i&rsquo;m in the</p>
<p>crawling phase and i&rsquo;m kind of saying how did web 1.0 and web 2.0 develop and i&rsquo;m trying just copying</p>
<p>it so you know in web 1.0 and 2.0 you needed companies like sun microsystems and cisco and</p>
<p>you know all of the plumbers foundational stuff to build plumbing for the internet to allow the</p>
<p>thousand flowers to bloom at the application level and you know we had a very good reference</p>
<p>model by the way for web 1.0 for most people if you want to look at it it&rsquo;s called the osi</p>
<p>reference stack and if you actually look at that osi stack you can translate that</p>
<p>to all kinds of value creation over the first you know two arcs of the internet over 20 years</p>
<p>trillions of dollars was created by just following each of those substrates and in those transitional</p>
<p>layers was where these great beautiful companies were built and i think similarly we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>do that again but we need a different stack to represent what web 3 is so yeah you know this</p>
<p>week we did something which was pretty straightforward which was this idea that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to build all these apps you&rsquo;re going to need a distributed compute infrastructure</p>
<p>which means you&rsquo;re going to need very simple building blocks like remote procedure calls rpc</p>
<p>that exists in web 2.0 it&rsquo;s kind of a not something you don&rsquo;t really think about but in web 3 doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist and so it&rsquo;s all this aws you know gcp like infrastructure that has to get built and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what syndicate does and i think that&rsquo;s a really very interesting observation there because</p>
<p>everybody is trying to go to the application level and talk about the consumer experience</p>
<p>but before you even have the ability you know we&rsquo;re talking about cars before we&rsquo;ve even made</p>
<p>a transmission or you know that&rsquo;s exactly right that&rsquo;s exactly right this is why crypto comes</p>
<p>across as so delusional and strange sometimes they wrote 3 000 ico papers none of them were</p>
<p>about infrastructure they&rsquo;re all about some sort of end game the thing is it&rsquo;s a very delicate</p>
<p>balancing act right you need a handful of companies that capture consumer imagination</p>
<p>right that then incentivize all of the plumbing companies to come in and build underneath it</p>
<p>right so it&rsquo;s a very it&rsquo;s a very delicate balancing act right so you needed compu serve</p>
<p>in order to enable a bunch of companies then you needed aol in order to enable another set</p>
<p>then you needed yahoo then you needed google and in all of that what happened was people</p>
<p>were pulled through right you needed amazon commerce to justify aws so we&rsquo;re in that world</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s going to be a little back and forth where the pendulum will swing back and forth</p>
<p>between consumer experiences that capture imagination get to some level of scale that</p>
<p>then create incentives for the developer ecosystem and the technology infrastructure to catch up</p>
<p>zillow which we talked about previously became an ibuyer what&rsquo;s an ibuyer that means you buy</p>
<p>a bunch of single family homes in all likelihood like open door and redfin have been doing and</p>
<p>then you hope to flip them uh maybe improve them and uh maybe lower costs to the consumers by</p>
<p>taking out real estate brokers this has created a lot of bad feelings amongst real estate brokers</p>
<p>a tick tock video trended a couple of months ago where a broker said or accused zillow</p>
<p>of buying up these homes in order to do price fixing and to corner the market on homes well</p>
<p>it turns out that zillow which has an incredible ceo in rich barton and has done tremendously over</p>
<p>the decades according ahead of their earnings call this week bloomberg reported zillow is trying</p>
<p>to offload 7 000 7 000 homes for 2.8 billion that&rsquo;s about a 400k average per home and zillow shares</p>
<p>dropped 37 this week alone from 100 to 66 their market cap has dropped 9 billion throughout the</p>
<p>week and they&rsquo;re down 70 percent from a peak valuation of 48 billion just in february about</p>
<p>six months ago zillow is going to reduce its workforce by 25 over the next few months i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming that&rsquo;s all those i buyers anecdotally a lot of what i&rsquo;m hearing is they bought homes</p>
<p>indiscriminately the anecdotal stories that are breaking on twitter and other forums with real</p>
<p>estate brokers are they would look at a home they didn&rsquo;t know that it had a noisy neighbor or it was</p>
<p>near power lines or whatever the people who came in bought them indiscriminately maybe too fast</p>
<p>whereas some other companies maybe open door or redfin were more considered i actually had glenn</p>
<p>from redfin on the pod not long ago and he said it&rsquo;s a very hard operational business you have</p>
<p>to be very careful on what you buy in your entry price that seems to have turned out to be true</p>
<p>what do you think freeberg rich barton who runs zillow is considered a legend in silicon valley</p>
<p>you know he has been involved in some of the most successful internet companies and you know when</p>
<p>he stepped back in as the founder of zillow stepped back in to run the business a few years</p>
<p>ago it was viewed as kind of a second you know resurrection of this business and he was going</p>
<p>to take it into new areas and then three and a half years ago he announced the side buyer program</p>
<p>which everyone thought was such a you know incredibly strong move and obviously chased</p>
<p>open door which chamath is involved in and i&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll share more on but it was such an obvious</p>
<p>opportunity that if you could add liquidity to the real estate market the residential real estate</p>
<p>market there&rsquo;s an incredible amount of value to be had now the way that they wrote about it when</p>
<p>they talked about it initially and then the way that they&rsquo;ve kind of talked about in their earnings</p>
<p>report this week was that they were trying to be a quote market maker in the business and it turned</p>
<p>out that what they were really doing was being more of a speculator right a market maker looks</p>
<p>at bids and asks in the spread and then tries to create a gap in that spread and make and take some</p>
<p>share of it and by adding that liquidity the idea is the spreads can narrow and they can make money</p>
<p>in this case they were looking at the historical velocity of selling prices of homes and using that</p>
<p>as a way to kind of project what was going to happen which makes them much more of a speculator</p>
<p>than a market maker and they clearly got this wrong and they&rsquo;re kind of quote unquote models on</p>
<p>you know where a price is headed ended up getting them in trouble there&rsquo;s also the inherent conflict</p>
<p>where they are now competing in a way with the brokers that generate a lot of revenue for them</p>
<p>and are a big part of their core business and they were clearly you know cannibalizing their</p>
<p>own business where the zestimate and some of the other scoring that they provide as a data and</p>
<p>analytics platform to both sides of the existing market starts to get blown up because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>coming in and saying we&rsquo;re going to put our you know our foot down and say this is what the value</p>
<p>is and it inevitably kind of cannibalizes the core product that they provide to both sides of the</p>
<p>market so you know one could argue this was flawed from the beginning the execution clearly was way</p>
<p>off and it begs the question you know where was leadership and kind of tracking what was going on</p>
<p>here as these guys were buying homes at market prices that are well above what they were actually</p>
<p>selling for in the market no one was actually doing on the ground work they were all doing</p>
<p>kind of speculative models and saying this is what we think will happen and then they woke up way too</p>
<p>late and lost way too much money i think they lost 300 million dollars in the quarter so um you know</p>
<p>really a lot of questions and a lot of challenges on this um i&rsquo;m sure chamath has a point of view on</p>
<p>you know what makes open door distinct from from zillow um but there&rsquo;s a really important kind of</p>
<p>you know um underlying here you know the maturity of a silicon valley uh entrepreneur who&rsquo;s crushed</p>
<p>it so many times uh doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re perfect and you know this was a big mess you can</p>
<p>go really too fast into a turn here and clearly they flip the car chamath i i don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>comfortably you are talking about this i&rsquo;m very comfortable okay well then here we go</p>
<p>number one you know i&rsquo;m not on the board um of open door of open door maybe tell us about your</p>
<p>history with open door chamath would be super look i look i i am one of the largest individual</p>
<p>shareholders of that company i think somewhere between three and four percent of the business i</p>
<p>owned we you know i came to own those shares with a large investment uh as well as through</p>
<p>through the transaction uh where we merged</p>
<p>one of our SPACs into it and took is that ipob yes a couple things to say the first is about</p>
<p>the ceo and founder of open door eric woo is special special special so let me just leave it</p>
<p>at that uh on that topic the second is i think that rich barton is very special but it speaks to</p>
<p>two big mistakes that zillow made the first is that catching a wave of disruption</p>
<p>is very difficult when you have an old line business that is fundamentally competitive</p>
<p>with the new line of business and zillow as david said had this thing called zestimate</p>
<p>whose entire job was to directionally drive top top of funnel traffic into the rest of their media</p>
<p>business now imagine you go to a website to look up your house value or somebody else&rsquo;s house value</p>
<p>accuracy is a bug the feature that makes this estimate work is an highly inflated house price</p>
<p>right like if you go and you see a crazy house price number that&rsquo;s interesting that&rsquo;s more um</p>
<p>click worthy than if you go in there and it shows some depressed value you think the site</p>
<p>sucks that&rsquo;s the unfortunate psychological reaction so i think whether we believe it or</p>
<p>not or whether zillow knew it or not zestimate over time basically calcified this idea of price</p>
<p>inflation so the accuracy was never a goal so then if you take that business and then you try</p>
<p>to orient it towards home buying and you use probably zestimate or some version of it to</p>
<p>underpin how you buy and take risk it creates a lot of risk and i think this is essentially what</p>
<p>played out where they were over buying homes and they didn&rsquo;t know how to price this stuff accurately</p>
<p>so you know my partner ravi tweeted this out but you know the open door margin on average is about</p>
<p>10 the zillow margin on average was three percent so they had a much more razor thin margin of safety</p>
<p>here which again speaks to pricing and then it speaks to this third thing which is that</p>
<p>if you start doing one thing and do it really well with software</p>
<p>the gains over years really compound and so when somebody else shows up and tries to pivot their</p>
<p>business to try to copy it it&rsquo;s very very difficult the classic example is google versus</p>
<p>yahoo yahoo had a beautiful directory driven business but when larry and sergey really larry</p>
<p>invented page rank and then invented that first version of a google search index</p>
<p>as we saw it play out over the next 10 or 15 years it was impossible for yahoo</p>
<p>to really invest the technical capital necessary to catch up with google</p>
<p>and every day and every week and every year as freeberg talked about last week those technical</p>
<p>gains compound and compound and now google is completely unassailable with respect to search</p>
<p>i suspect we will look back and the ability to accurately forecast price and volatility</p>
<p>and the ability to sell these assets at a defined margin of safety in a predictable way</p>
<p>is something software can solve and it seems that open door is the first it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;ll be the only one but it has an enormous head start now and as long as they can keep</p>
<p>iterating those gains will compound um so that&rsquo;s what i think i just think this is a wonderful</p>
<p>business run by an incredible ceo to wrap up this zillow story sacks uh any thoughts on</p>
<p>you know chamat&rsquo;s point here you know you&rsquo;re the rating agency and you had this business</p>
<p>and the business might be orthogonal to the existing money printing machine</p>
<p>on a strategic basis what do you think any lessons or mistakes here uh in terms of when</p>
<p>you handicap zillow or do you want to just move on and talk politics i mean look i&rsquo;m a i was a</p>
<p>seed investor in open door because ravoy invited me into the seed round so you know i&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>biased here but i think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious what happened uh zillow tried to copy them the business</p>
<p>is much more operationally complicated than they realized it&rsquo;s a low business low margin business</p>
<p>with the time which requires a ton of capital so if you&rsquo;re off a little bit the losses can be huge</p>
<p>and zillow couldn&rsquo;t figure it out they underestimate the difficulty that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>frequently happens in a big company tries to copy a smaller sort of upstart company</p>
<p>so i mean that to me is what happened in a nutshell quite frankly we&rsquo;re an hour into this</p>
<p>pod we haven&rsquo;t discussed issues any issue that i think is broadly relevant to most americans</p>
<p>i think this is one of our worst episodes we&rsquo;re going to bore everyone to tears i frankly don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what the f you&rsquo;re doing i don&rsquo;t even know why we have a topic list when you start</p>
<p>pulling it out of your ass like dow&rsquo;s and i don&rsquo;t know what the f else all right all right fine we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>talk about politics yeah i thought the doubt question sucked all right i&rsquo;m just giving you</p>
<p>the opportunity that we shouldn&rsquo;t even be talking about cut it out of the show cut it this whole</p>
<p>episode should be cut jesus christ i think this is like one of the stupidest episodes you&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>done yeah i agree i think we should cut all that it&rsquo;s going great no jason i about jason i agree</p>
<p>that that part where we cut it that&rsquo;s all right fine you got some loser i&rsquo;m trying to give you</p>
<p>guys the benefit of the doubt to just because it was like no one cares all right fine calm down</p>
<p>everybody you want to talk about politics we talk about politics it&rsquo;s okay sax go ahead tell us</p>
<p>about the election okay i&rsquo;ll just rattle off some of the key results here from blue states we have</p>
<p>a woke lash going on all across the country that&rsquo;s the important thing in virginia a state that biden</p>
<p>won by 10 he&rsquo;s cranky huge upset republican glenn young can beat terry mccall if a former governor</p>
<p>there he was this was a huge upset mccall was supposed to win youngkin won 51 48 so that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>13 point swing uh versus where biden was uh just a year ago in new jersey a state that biden won</p>
<p>by 16 points the democrat held on to it but only by 1.5 points and i bet you anything the rnc is</p>
<p>kicking itself they didn&rsquo;t give any money to chattarelli who&rsquo;s the challenger who i think</p>
<p>almost who came very very close and there were down ticket seats that went republican so that the</p>
<p>um this is really interesting in south jersey which is a blue-collar bastion for democrats</p>
<p>versus burr that&rsquo;s right the democratic state senate leader steve sweeney lost to a truck driver</p>
<p>named ed durr who spent a grand total of 153 dollars on his campaign okay so those were some</p>
<p>and then we had some other write in like he was printing out to say write me in i think i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a writing but but in any event so so implications for 2022 dave wasserman of cook</p>
<p>political report calculates somewhere between a 44 and 51 c game from the gop they only need</p>
<p>five seats to win the majority so it&rsquo;s looking very bleak for the democrats in 2022 and then</p>
<p>i think you also had some very interesting local elections in minneapolis voters rejected a</p>
<p>proposal to defund the police with 56 of the vote uh they there was a ballot proposition to</p>
<p>change the police department into some sort of larger public safety group voters were having</p>
<p>none of it in seattle which is a very liberal city they voted for a literal republican as city</p>
<p>attorney which is the office that prosecutes misdemeanors so against a police abolitionist</p>
<p>who said she would stop prosecuting misdemeanors you&rsquo;re forgetting that in virginia it wasn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>glenn young can that one but basically it was terry mccullough and then a lieutenant governor</p>
<p>who was some milk toast individual and an attorney general candidate who was caught in blackface</p>
<p>which by the way there is no more racist thing you can do just to put get let you guys</p>
<p>let everybody know all the non-colors okay that guys please don&rsquo;t do blackface or brownface it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such a bad it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;re right it was a sweep so so the lieutenant and and yunkin</p>
<p>and it was a it was a black female lieutenant governor and a latino attorney general that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right and they swept right that&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s right so the lieutenant governor was winston sears</p>
<p>uh she&rsquo;s a a black woman republican if you&rsquo;ve seen the photo of her she&rsquo;s frequently photographed</p>
<p>with a giant assault rifle in her hands uh that&rsquo;s her and then uh a hispanic attorney general jason</p>
<p>miyari&rsquo;s uh one as well so yeah it was a huge sweep and then you know in long island and</p>
<p>staten island which again are blue counties you had two republican prosecutors beat the local</p>
<p>sort of uh incumbent democrat decarceration da&rsquo;s red just i think i think this is very clear which</p>
<p>is um trump was behaviorally extreme and after four years people were sick of it nobody wanted</p>
<p>that behavioral extremism because it was unpredictable and people felt frankly in</p>
<p>danger and i think that that was legitimate he also turned out to be extremely lazy and</p>
<p>probably pretty dumb now what we&rsquo;re realizing is the different form of extremism which is policy</p>
<p>extremism will also be met with the same response which is that you you can&rsquo;t sustain election</p>
<p>results and wins right so people care consistently about three things they care about the economy</p>
<p>they care about the education of their children and they care about safety</p>
<p>and the thing that glenn youngkin did which i thought was</p>
<p>at least a playbook for centrists and the right and it&rsquo;s also a playbook for the democrats if</p>
<p>they choose to embrace it is to understand that these things are reaching a tipping point where</p>
<p>you know again we&rsquo;ve said this before it is possible to live in a state of mind where you</p>
<p>believe in black lives matter and you believe in law and order right and and when you try to</p>
<p>pit those two things against each other for example like you would have thought the one place</p>
<p>where they would have basically defunded the police in its entirety would have been minneapolis</p>
<p>after george floyd but instead even they drew the line and said no or new york or new york</p>
<p>there was a there was a really compelling quote actually by this woman i think it was in the new</p>
<p>york times and what she said was i didn&rsquo;t elect joe biden to be fdr i elected him to tack to the</p>
<p>middle and just calm things down so that everybody could exhale so that we could reset same with me</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s that was abigail spanberger actually she&rsquo;s a virginia democrat yeah she&rsquo;s a virginia</p>
<p>democrat who won a seat in one of those blue counties that just flipped red to vote for</p>
<p>youngkin and since she got elected i guess she got elected last year she&rsquo;s been telling the</p>
<p>democratic she&rsquo;s the one who called out pelosi in that you know caucus meeting saying i don&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>want to hear the words defund the police again that is electoral poison and then she said yes</p>
<p>nobody elected biden to be fdr they elected to be normal and stop the chaos and so yeah certainly my</p>
<p>vote yeah there&rsquo;s a big backlash going on because biden has decided to start governing like bernie</p>
<p>sanders no one elected him to do that so sax is the lesson dems learned this time around is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very easy to beat trump but it&rsquo;s very hard to beat a moderate republican no no it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that you just have to be a rational normal person that&rsquo;s what i mean by a moderate republican</p>
<p>well you just have to be moderate i don&rsquo;t think it matters but this is but this is the key</p>
<p>dems it was so easy for them to use trump trump you know but these three topics are not a republican</p>
<p>tentpole nor are they a democratic temple they are the tentpole of reasonable people yes meaning</p>
<p>which most people are reasonable hey guys get out of the way so that we can you know have a</p>
<p>reasonable life in an economy hey folks please make sure my kids when i send them to school</p>
<p>for eight hours a day come back reasonably educated and please keep my street safe and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not really willing to decarcerate ad hoc to such a degree that all of a sudden crime gets out of</p>
<p>control those are not democratic or republican tentpoles those are just moderate centrist</p>
<p>rational things to believe in yeah being and also behave normally like i i think whatever</p>
<p>happened with these progressives where they couldn&rsquo;t pass you know the stimulus bills and</p>
<p>things that almost everybody agreed on glenn yunkin was not behaviorally extremist yes and</p>
<p>and from a policy perspective was pretty much down the middle eric adams eric adams is not</p>
<p>behaviorally extreme and he is politically down the middle the mayor of buffalo who got reelected</p>
<p>is not behaviorally extreme and he&rsquo;s politically down the middle do you start to see a pattern</p>
<p>here yeah nobody wants aoc bernie elizabeth warren or trump i think it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>question of aoc or bernie or trump it&rsquo;s just that right now the temperature of america is</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just all exhale and just recenter ourselves as a country yeah and so moderation and centrism</p>
<p>is actually what calls for today i don&rsquo;t know how to predict what happens in 15 or 20 years and</p>
<p>maybe aoc is the canary in the coal mine for where the country goes by a plurality of people</p>
<p>in 15 or 20 years but what&rsquo;s clear is it&rsquo;s not where it goes today and i think that we it all</p>
<p>behooves us to just take a real step back and exhale and just read the tea leaves because</p>
<p>every single thing that the democrats tried to do to sort of like make this extreme really didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work the race baiting all of that stuff really kind of failed and i think that that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to listen to you know because you had a lot of black indian chinese families that just showed</p>
<p>up hispanics you know that again reliable democratic voters and voted for glenn youngkin</p>
<p>in a way that was surprising to me right and then so if you compare new jersey and and virginia</p>
<p>biden won virginia by 10. he the the democratic nominee lost biden won new jersey by 16</p>
<p>and phil murphy barely squeaked by it was like 10 000 votes jersey&rsquo;s always had a a republican</p>
<p>kind of leaning group they&rsquo;re very tuned biden won by 16 this should have been a cake walk but</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s 16 how much of that is get trump out of office is what we i think the democrats</p>
<p>need to parse and they blew it by going too radical we&rsquo;re repudiating behavioral extremism</p>
<p>and policy extremism so i think we just need to realize rational normal chill people</p>
<p>who can do reasonable things get our kids educated so for example on the education front</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw this because i tweeted and you can put this nick in the group chat</p>
<p>but in california right now there&rsquo;s a battle over math class ridiculous right where the title i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just going to read the title because it sets it off california tries to close the gap in math</p>
<p>but sets off a backlash proposed guidelines in the state would de-emphasize calculus</p>
<p>reject the idea that some children are naturally gifted and build a connection to social justice</p>
<p>critics say math shouldn&rsquo;t be political well of course the way that those articles are always</p>
<p>written it&rsquo;s always about the backlash you know they don&rsquo;t talk about what what the people in</p>
<p>charge are trying to do to basically degrade the curriculum of course there&rsquo;s a backlash because</p>
<p>parents don&rsquo;t like put the people on these school boards are doing this was the sleeper issue in</p>
<p>virginia was the school board issue you had um you know parents were already angry that the</p>
<p>teachers unions had kept the schools closed for a year and a half during covet and while their</p>
<p>kids were at home you know work doing classes over zoom parents got a good look at what some</p>
<p>of their kids were learning and didn&rsquo;t like what they saw i mean we&rsquo;re talking about lessons plans</p>
<p>that incorporated crt and you know the 1619 project view of america singling out kids by</p>
<p>their race making them focus on difference and then there were some you know rather explicit</p>
<p>materials at young grade levels about you know lgbt issues and so this led to a whole bunch</p>
<p>of confrontations at school board meetings where parents of all races objected to you know the</p>
<p>least lesson plans for their kids and the school boards and administrators just dismissed their</p>
<p>complaints without a hand and you know their message was well we&rsquo;re not teaching crt to your</p>
<p>kids but if we were it&rsquo;s a good thing and only white supremacists would object so you know that</p>
<p>was sort of what was happening in the background and then mccall comes along and makes this gigantic</p>
<p>gaffe in the last debates about two weeks before the election where he says i don&rsquo;t think parents</p>
<p>should be telling the schools what to teach and what yes this was the customer no he said that</p>
<p>he said that on a debate and he said that in a debate about two weeks before the election</p>
<p>mccall was leading through this whole thing until that debate where and this was sort of a kinsley</p>
<p>gaffe in the sense that you know michael kinsley said a gaffe is when a candidate inadvertently</p>
<p>says something true you know this is mccall&rsquo;s view is that the teachers union should be</p>
<p>controlling the schools not the parents well um yes so this is what young can uh jumped all over</p>
<p>all of his ads in the last two weeks of campaign really focused on this issue you know poured</p>
<p>gasoline on a fire and then the most tone-deaf thing mccall did is he had randy weingarten</p>
<p>who is the head of the uh the big teachers union come in and campaign for him at the 11th hour</p>
<p>well of course that&rsquo;s not going to save him because people are sick and tired of the teachers unions</p>
<p>so you know this was basically the big sleeper issue crt and the schools in virginia</p>
<p>and you know this is this i think specifically is what the democratic party has to wake up to</p>
<p>is that these progressive ideologies are not popular the other thing i&rsquo;ll say about glenn</p>
<p>youngkin is that this is another thing that the that the republicans should hopefully pay</p>
<p>attention to which is you can look normal act normal be normal you know this is not an extremist</p>
<p>in any way this guy was the co-ceo of carlisle which is a huge and very successful private equity</p>
<p>firm so this is a very rational reasonable person who um you know didn&rsquo;t embrace anything</p>
<p>that was really that pro-trump and that should be a real wake-up call to the republicans which is</p>
<p>hey let&rsquo;s just run a fleet of normal people i think what you saw i think chamath is right that</p>
<p>what you saw in virginia is that the playbook that gavin newsom just used to defeat the recall</p>
<p>in california did not work in virginia which is he tried to uh paint youngkin as a trump proxy</p>
<p>and youngkin very deftly you know avoided that he got trump&rsquo;s yes he got trump&rsquo;s endorsement</p>
<p>but very early in the process he did not have trump come to the state um and you&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>say it also helped youngkin a lot that social media that trump wasn&rsquo;t all over social media</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s been banned so you know in a weird way facebook and twitter deserve an assist here</p>
<p>um because they help keep trump out of the virginia race so you know this playbook that</p>
<p>that newsom defined that worked very effectively from california which is simply to keep running</p>
<p>against trump i think democrats thought they&rsquo;d be able to win elections for years based on that</p>
<p>that playbook didn&rsquo;t even last two months so you know so i think democrats are gonna have</p>
<p>to find a new playbook here okay so friedberg uh on this california issue around education</p>
<p>one of the key or most controversial um concepts is detracking in other words instead of having</p>
<p>high-performing students go to a high-performing track and then everybody else stay behind maybe</p>
<p>keep in not all cases but keep some of the students together because there is some research that shows</p>
<p>if done right if you track people together the higher performing students will pull up the ones</p>
<p>who are slightly behind other people say we&rsquo;re basically uh throttling people who could be the</p>
<p>next einstein or the next world-class leader in science math etc uh any thoughts on the concept</p>
<p>of detracking since i&rsquo;m assuming you were in the high-speed track in science and math</p>
<p>maybe we should get rid of like jv and varsity sports teams as well and you know triple a</p>
<p>baseball and major league baseball as well and you know any distinction of performance um</p>
<p>or exceptionalism goes away you know and and that is kind of the the key social question</p>
<p>is are we going to give up exceptionalism um to minimize uh the distance uh between</p>
<p>the exceptional and the average and that seems to be what&rsquo;s happening makes people</p>
<p>makes people feel bad but i&rsquo;ve said this point before you know we&rsquo;re doing it when we try and</p>
<p>think about you know the billionaire tax or what have you as soon as you start to limit progress</p>
<p>um you reduce inequality but you limit progress and the same will be true not just in science</p>
<p>not just in business uh but also in sports and athletics and um and any other kind of system</p>
<p>where you will have exceptionalism you will have an average you will have a distribution</p>
<p>amongst human performance and as soon as we try and uh limit the difference in that distribution</p>
<p>um we move the entire curve to the left here&rsquo;s the uh counter friedbert um what some studies</p>
<p>have shown is yes you will uh throttle the high performers but we&rsquo;re seeing uh along race lines</p>
<p>certain demographics being left behind other ones excelling and that you can get yeah it&rsquo;s an ethics</p>
<p>and values question right like do you think that individual freedom and the opportunity to pursue</p>
<p>your opportunity your your exceptionalism um should be taken away from you such that others</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t as exceptional as you are given um you know greater progress than they would have had on</p>
<p>their own um and that&rsquo;s the the key crux of what all of these social systems are grappling with</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in sports or business or finance or or um or education is what&rsquo;s the right thing to do</p>
<p>and that ethics question is going to be defined by the social agenda of the moment and you know</p>
<p>the means of the moment and what we all think is is the right thing to do and it&rsquo;s different all</p>
<p>over the world and it&rsquo;s different within political systems but it&rsquo;s a very divisive point that i</p>
<p>think folks who find themselves on one end of that exceptional spectrum and different aspects</p>
<p>are going to have one point of view and folks on the other end of that exceptional spectrum are</p>
<p>going to have other points of view and everyone&rsquo;s going to be sensitively tuned to where they fall</p>
<p>in that spectrum i will say one thing though on that spectrum exceptionalism is rarer than the</p>
<p>average therefore it is likely the case that over the next years and decades we will see</p>
<p>the um the idea that we should remove exceptionalism in business and exceptionalism</p>
<p>in education and exceptionalism in sports because it benefits the majority and um and and no one</p>
<p>kind of recognizes and a lot of folks don&rsquo;t recognize the progress that is made by exceptionalism</p>
<p>and um and that&rsquo;s and then we&rsquo;re going to wake up one day and be like oh wait a second we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the the best sports teams winning all the gold medals we don&rsquo;t have the smartest kids we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the best businesses china and europe and brazil and whomever else the emerging markets</p>
<p>india are going to start to have such a good point i think this is a very old debate it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the debate between equality of opportunity and equality of results yeah and the progressive left</p>
<p>is absolutely obsessed with equality of results or outcomes which they now call equity which is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to take people at the finish line and we&rsquo;re going to move them around we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>redistribute the outcomes to achieve a more proportional representation or something more</p>
<p>fair as opposed to giving everybody as much opportunity at the outset as possible that is</p>
<p>the fixation right now that is why they&rsquo;re taking out advanced math in the schools they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>level people it&rsquo;s not going to work it doesn&rsquo;t lead to a more we want to have an exceptional</p>
<p>society where i think we should be focusing is creating as much opportunity for everybody</p>
<p>the way to do that would be to let every child go to the school of their choosing so that we</p>
<p>would stop trapping kids in bad schools but back to kind of bring this back to the election for a</p>
<p>second because i think it was a very clear repudiation of this progressive mindset and i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s essentially two sets of reactions to it if you look at sort of all the left-wing</p>
<p>commentators the the one who i thought seemed to get it the most was cnn&rsquo;s van jones actually</p>
<p>had i thought you know a rare moment of introspection where he said it was this was</p>
<p>the the results were a five alarm fire he says a big big wake up call for the democrats to stop</p>
<p>annoying voters with woke hectoring he actually advised biden to start triangulating against the</p>
<p>woke left in the way that bill clinton did i mean which is something that i&rsquo;ve been suggesting on</p>
<p>this this pod so you&rsquo;re saying something super important the game theory now is for biden to put</p>
<p>to the test the progressive left because now he can go firmly to the center and he can put</p>
<p>all of the pressure on the progressive left in the house and warren and bernie sanders in the</p>
<p>senate well he&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s the first thing he should do is he should pull a sister he should</p>
<p>pull a sister soldier on bernie sanders he can&rsquo;t keep delegating the domestic agenda to bernie</p>
<p>sanders he if he wants to save his presidency he&rsquo;ll start triangulating in the way that bill</p>
<p>clinton did i&rsquo;m not sure he&rsquo;s going to i think there&rsquo;s already a misperception that the reason</p>
<p>why they lost this election is because they didn&rsquo;t deliver the goodies in this house reconciliation</p>
<p>bill that in other words i don&rsquo;t think the public cares about the goodies i mean they care about this</p>
<p>normalcy and centrism yeah there&rsquo;s a part of the democratic base that does want the what&rsquo;s in that</p>
<p>house reconciliation bill but but here&rsquo;s the thing democratic turnout in this election was</p>
<p>extremely high the democratic turnout for mccullough was higher than the democratic turnout</p>
<p>four years ago for the democrat who won the the turnout that uh in new jersey was higher than what</p>
<p>murphy got four years ago when he won the problem the democrats have is that republican turnout was</p>
<p>extremely high even without trump showing that trump doesn&rsquo;t matter that much to turn out and</p>
<p>the independence came out in a big way for republicans so this idea that democrats can just</p>
<p>win elections by delivering you know programs for their base that&rsquo;s not going to work so i think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a misperception i think van jones has the right idea they need to triangulate but you turn</p>
<p>the channel to msnbc and they were just blaming the whole thing on white supremacy basically</p>
<p>hysterical um just on the detracking thing this shows to me a severe lack of creativity you if</p>
<p>you look at what happened in the nba they had this developmental league which they didn&rsquo;t kind of run</p>
<p>then became the g league they now have the ability to bring players fluidly from the</p>
<p>warriors g league team up to the warriors or the next team up to the next what this means is</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to say there&rsquo;s two different tracks and the two never shall meet in the</p>
<p>season they can move up and down in math a very easy solution to this would be to have the high</p>
<p>track for high performers have the regular track and then spend with all this money we have say</p>
<p>hey every school is going to be open from three to five o&rsquo;clock four days a week if anybody wants</p>
<p>to attempt to get into a higher track of math just stay after school for two hours anybody can</p>
<p>go and get one on one tutoring and just double the number of teachers the whole country wants</p>
<p>excellence they don&rsquo;t want leveling they don&rsquo;t want equity they don&rsquo;t want a quality of results</p>
<p>they want to have a quality of opportunity the whole country wants people to move up they do</p>
<p>want to see that&rsquo;s true and brown students and immigrants do better at math that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>missing yes and that&rsquo;s about a quality of opportunity absolutely no it&rsquo;s not just about</p>
<p>a quality of opportunity they&rsquo;re so far behind statistically that you need to do something new</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re doing is not working david that&rsquo;s why people are picking this bad decision they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they are eliminating advanced math because they don&rsquo;t want to actually look at the the problem</p>
<p>what do you see the problem as well if there&rsquo;s an underperformance in certain groups then you</p>
<p>should work hard to raise them up not how would you do that give me a suggestion</p>
<p>charters and school choice okay look i mean if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re going to define</p>
<p>structural racism as conditions that that trap people of color in poverty across generations</p>
<p>seems like a pretty fair definition then you have to say the number one cause of structural racism</p>
<p>is the school system education yeah it&rsquo;s the school system because we know poor kids are</p>
<p>trapped in schools that aren&rsquo;t very good why because they&rsquo;re controlled by the education</p>
<p>unions they don&rsquo;t have a choice they don&rsquo;t have money so who is making that argument uh on the on</p>
<p>the side of the left no one why because everyone knows the unions especially the education unions</p>
<p>are the number one donor to the democratic party so the democrats won&rsquo;t even look at this problem</p>
<p>all they&rsquo;ll do is blame white supremacy could build their base is by saying we want to fix</p>
<p>education that would be if you they are education what do you think young industry in virginia by</p>
<p>the way 55 of hispanics in virginia voted for youngkin so minorities are shifting on this issue</p>
<p>these are the new quality of life issues if youngkin has a good four years in virginia he</p>
<p>can run for president and crush this thing can i show you just one chart and then we can get off</p>
<p>the politics thing which is it was this chart from this guy patrick uh ruffini who&rsquo;s a pollster</p>
<p>and i think it really illustrates the problem that progresses the democratic party for the</p>
<p>listeners okay so what this chart shows is it basically shows where the democratic the democratic</p>
<p>party is in the center republican party is in relation to the center of the country okay and</p>
<p>basically as you&rsquo;d expect in a democracy whichever party is closer to five wins okay so in 1994 when</p>
<p>bill clinton was president the democratic party the center of it was smack dab as five the</p>
<p>republicans weren&rsquo;t that far away they were six so the party even though there is a lot of partisan</p>
<p>warfare the the political differences actually weren&rsquo;t that great and clinton i think more</p>
<p>accurately found that dead center okay fast forward to 2004 so george w bush is president</p>
<p>now the democrats are at four republicans are at five that&rsquo;s why republicans won okay now go to</p>
<p>2017 these poll numbers he did and this is a few years ago the democrats are all the way at two</p>
<p>okay and the republicans are at six and a half so it&rsquo;s true that both parties have moved away</p>
<p>from the center but republicans are one and a half points away from the center whereas democrats are</p>
<p>three points away so the democrats have actually moved further away from the center if you look at</p>
<p>who are the activists in the democratic party who is the base who is the energy who does all the</p>
<p>work who does the contributions it is the progressives right this is why mccullough ran as</p>
<p>mccullough is not a progressive he was a clinton democrat you know going way back to the 90s okay</p>
<p>he was bill clinton&rsquo;s you know uh right hand man in the party back in the 90s but he nevertheless</p>
<p>ran as a progressive in virginia who supported the teachers unions why because he was appealing to the</p>
<p>base of the party gavin newsom did the same thing in california gavin was never a bernie bro i mean</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always been liberal but he he has moved very far left and biden has moved very far left as</p>
<p>president why is that because the base of the party has moved very far left so unless that gets</p>
<p>fixed i see so you&rsquo;re appealing to the party&rsquo;s base but not the country&rsquo;s exactly so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to need a strong democrat who can basically give the heisman to that part of the base or</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to keep losing elections i think this could be a republican decade i know it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem like it right now because you had trump and the republicans lost but look how quickly</p>
<p>the republicans turned around their electoral fortunes so with trump on the sidelines then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a huge detriment yes if trump is the nominee in 2024 all bets are off but in 2022 he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the nominee he&rsquo;s still censored from social networks he&rsquo;s really nowhere in sight and people</p>
<p>have a very short memory it turns out they&rsquo;ve moved on very quickly young can check the box</p>
<p>because he felt he had to to get the nomination and to run on the republican platform but then</p>
<p>you think youngkins going to talk to trump once no not one and i and i think and i honestly think</p>
<p>this election is going to help republicans move past trump because what republican believes in</p>
<p>in like that the electoral system is rigged now right i mean all these blue cities and states</p>
<p>just delivered big results for republicans so where exactly is the ballot stuffing where exactly</p>
<p>is the stall where are the stolen elections that&rsquo;s going to that&rsquo;s going to stop now too</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to stop overnight right because i mean by the way kristin cinema probably knows</p>
<p>this like you know the the the funny thing about all of this is when peter teal put in 10 million</p>
<p>dollars into this pack for blake masters who used to work for him and said you know in arizona i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to run this guy against you cinema tacked hard to the center instantly so she she knew too</p>
<p>yeah well so just just a small point of course so blake is running against the other guy the</p>
<p>astronaut guy i&rsquo;m just basing on his name but but yeah but but cinema is up so to speak in the next</p>
<p>election cycle so she got a little bit more time but you&rsquo;re right like cinema is attuned and mansion</p>
<p>is attuned there are some of the few democrats that are attuned to where the center of the country is</p>
<p>you heard mansion in the wake of this election said this is a center-right country these guys</p>
<p>better wake up um you know they should really now look i think i think what&rsquo;s going to happen in the</p>
<p>wake of this election is that this infrastructure bill is going to sail through because one of the</p>
<p>crazier things that the progressives were doing was holding that bill hostage it might have helped</p>
<p>mccullough i don&rsquo;t think would i don&rsquo;t think mccullough would have won but it might have</p>
<p>helped him by a point or two if they had gotten that infrastructure bill done because a lot of</p>
<p>those programs are going to be popular in a state like virginia okay but i mean but but i think that</p>
<p>you know this house reconciliation bill they just seemed hell-bent on jamming it through with all</p>
<p>these tax increases i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s not popular you know what the big issue in new</p>
<p>jersey was for them yeah one of the big issues in new jersey where you almost had this upset</p>
<p>within one point was taxes you know um there was a a gaffe by murphy who said something like you</p>
<p>know he said he said that if if taxes are someone&rsquo;s chief concern he said quote maybe we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not your state can you imagine that wow and he almost lost the election because of that so i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think all these big tax increases are what the country wants and you know if biden insists</p>
<p>on allowing bernie to dominate the agenda and warren i think it&rsquo;s good you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>40 to 50 seat losses by the democrats in 2022 okay moving on to our final topic crazy update</p>
<p>out of china a research team has developed a method of converting carbon dioxide into starch</p>
<p>science magazine published this paper from a research team 100 grams of catalyst converting</p>
<p>5 grams of co2 per hour into starch and freeberg i saw you tweeted that this is 10 times more</p>
<p>efficient than corn plants what&rsquo;s the impact of something like this could it hit scale</p>
<p>would it have an impact on food security carbon global warming yeah so i tweeted this paper out</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s a fantastic demonstration of what&rsquo;s possible in this new emerging not</p>
<p>emerging it&rsquo;s been around for a long time but kind of you know in the state of art in um in</p>
<p>biomanufacturing you know photosynthesis is the system by which most starch is produced on planet</p>
<p>earth today that is plants convert sunlight and use water and carbon dioxide to make starches and</p>
<p>starches um and and sugars which are what carbohydrates are account for 60 of human</p>
<p>calories and we get all those calories from rice wheat potatoes which you know are grown on about</p>
<p>60 of our acres uh that we farm on planet earth so you know in in plants there&rsquo;s a series of these</p>
<p>chemical reactions and what these guys did is they isolated and created a couple of specific</p>
<p>proteins which are a class of proteins called enzymes and what an enzyme is is it&rsquo;s a protein</p>
<p>that can take different molecules and combine them and reinforce them to react and make something new</p>
<p>and they identified a couple of enzymes and engineered a few enzymes and put them together</p>
<p>in a cell-free system meaning there&rsquo;s no cells involved it&rsquo;s just a tank with a bunch of fluids</p>
<p>in it and um and they stick in some carbon dioxide that they can suck in from the atmosphere and they</p>
<p>they can and they have to drive it with some hydrogen gas which we can just get from water</p>
<p>and the system basically converts that carbon dioxide into starch which is being done at a rate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s almost 10 times higher than what we see with with corn plants so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an incredible</p>
<p>demonstration there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s several steps to the system like six steps and i did some back</p>
<p>of the envelope math and my back of the envelope math on what they&rsquo;ve demonstrated and and by the</p>
<p>way everything they did is publicly available for reproducibility so people are going to try</p>
<p>open source so people are going to try and copy this now but my back of the envelope math is um</p>
<p>you know uh this system can produce about 10 grams of starch per liter per day which would</p>
<p>mean it would take about 2.7 trillion liters to suck up all of the carbon dioxide that all of</p>
<p>humans are putting in the atmosphere every year from all of industry that would require um about</p>
<p>27 million tanks that are about 40 feet tall and about eight feet wide that whole all of those</p>
<p>tanks could fit in an area about 25 by 25 miles you could attach one nuclear reactor to it to</p>
<p>suck up the uh the water and convert into hydrogen gas and feed this system and those tanks 25 miles</p>
<p>by 25 miles would take out all of the carbon dioxide on planet earth and convert it into usable</p>
<p>starch and that starch by the way that system could be tuned not just to make starch for consumption</p>
<p>it could be used to make biofuels it could be used to make bioplastics it could be used to make</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s hydrocarbon based um and so you can kind of think about this being the entry point</p>
<p>to a series of production systems that we could use to make stuff freeberg why did they open source</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re a research team of scientists from china and they&rsquo;ve been iterating on this this</p>
<p>process this isn&rsquo;t the only process right and so what they&rsquo;re showing is that this is possible</p>
<p>and what i think we will see is a lot of people rattling their brains now saying</p>
<p>not only do we use proteins and enzymes that we find in nature but we&rsquo;re going to start to</p>
<p>engineer our own proteins and our own enzymes that are even more efficient than what we see</p>
<p>in nature and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s starting to happen this system alone what i just described this 25</p>
<p>mile by 25 mile system which is tiny is the equivalent of starch production from 42 us</p>
<p>corn belt if you took all the corn growing in the united states it&rsquo;s 42 times that um is what it</p>
<p>would produce that&rsquo;s my back of the envelope math of kind of what these guys did um and so i think</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re showing is this is what&rsquo;s incredibly yeah yeah and and the implications we could go in</p>
<p>100 directions and we could talk for an hour about what this means and what you could do with it</p>
<p>but i think it really catalyzes this this point that that that we&rsquo;re kind of everyone&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>like how are we gonna get all this carbon out of the atmosphere what are we gonna do with this</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a will there&rsquo;s a way the science is here today 27 million tanks made out of plastic</p>
<p>you could probably get that stuff produced you know a couple billion dollars find a piece of</p>
<p>land that&rsquo;s 25 by 25 miles it&rsquo;s near some water and put a nuclear power plant there and you could</p>
<p>suck up all the co2 in the atmosphere anybody want to take anybody want to take a guess of how</p>
<p>many people on the team were in advanced math courses the funny thing about this that i think</p>
<p>is really interesting is that it came at the same week where we were ending you know what was this</p>
<p>political theater of cop 26 you know greta thunberg uh who&rsquo;s you know how dare you how dare you</p>
<p>she had this she well she had this very funny comment which is like ah you know it was a bunch</p>
<p>of corporate nonsense and the same old blah blah blah was your description of cop 26 you know we</p>
<p>had this great trickle of like you know agreements there was like on monday there was an agreement to</p>
<p>stop deforestation uh and then you realize it&rsquo;s a non-binding agreement and you&rsquo;re like oh okay</p>
<p>well i guess we&rsquo;re not going to stop deforesting we&rsquo;re just going to keep you know doing that</p>
<p>and all of this stuff just kind of like took a lot of my enthusiasm um and i was a little despondent</p>
<p>about what was going on and then when i saw this thing i was i was really quite impressed i will</p>
<p>say that there&rsquo;s a very tricky thing happening right now which is that developing countries</p>
<p>basically said listen if you want us to go after climate change um we want 1.3 trillion dollars a</p>
<p>year to support us and so you know the western world will have to figure out whether we&rsquo;re willing</p>
<p>to pay you know what is the equivalent of you know six or seven percent of us gdp to a whole</p>
<p>bunch of other countries every year for them to slow down and if we don&rsquo;t make these payments to</p>
<p>india and china and a bunch of other developing nations they they have said we&rsquo;re just going to</p>
<p>continue to do what we&rsquo;re going to here&rsquo;s an idea take half of that money and put it towards science</p>
<p>yeah take half that money and go build a plant that uses this system that was just demonstrated</p>
<p>and put it in south texas and suck up ocean water and convert that ocean water into hydrogen gas</p>
<p>by the way ocean water can be turned into hydrogen gas by running electricity through</p>
<p>it so you&rsquo;re putting a nuclear power plant to make the electricity you run it through ocean</p>
<p>water you create hydrogen gas you pump it into these friggin tanks and it sucks up all the co2</p>
<p>and it makes stuff that humans can consume and that we can use and suddenly you have this abundance</p>
<p>of material you have this abundance of food and you can turn this in jobs and you can turn this</p>
<p>into a lot of different things and you know this kind of goes to the point i&rsquo;ve been making for a</p>
<p>while if we want to invest in infrastructure this is the sort of thing that both solves climate change</p>
<p>creates jobs and has extraordinary economic return potential built into it so how does it</p>
<p>get politicians re-elected you know i think the private market may come after this stuff i&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>honest i&rsquo;m you know i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m talking to people looking at this being like why don&rsquo;t we make a</p>
<p>plant that we can make biofuels and bioplastics and food and other stuff out of this uh this</p>
<p>technique and there&rsquo;s going to be other iterations of this technique um but it&rsquo;s such a no-brainer</p>
<p>cost like a functional prototype of this like a small prototype nothing right i mean a couple</p>
<p>million bucks yeah like nothing so um you know the other thing that happened this week beyond</p>
<p>this request for 1.3 trillion dollars is that you know we&rsquo;re now seriously considering carbon</p>
<p>tariffs and we talked about this on a pod before but you know i&rsquo;ve said i think this is the most</p>
<p>disruptive thing in the capital markets and and geopolitics that can happen in the next 10 or 20</p>
<p>years it&rsquo;s an effective carbon tariff which is to say that when a good or service enters the borders</p>
<p>of a country they will levy some tax that they think represents its drag on the environment</p>
<p>and so you know the simple example would be a car you know you make a car you make a tesla</p>
<p>in texas but the minute it crosses the border to canada canada says well here&rsquo;s the true carbon</p>
<p>intensity of this car all of the energy that you put into the aluminum to the batteries</p>
<p>you know to the to the buildings where the engineers sat that were that were building fsd</p>
<p>and uh you know i&rsquo;m going to charge an eight thousand dollar tax on this car</p>
<p>or iphone&rsquo;s coming out of china yeah that&rsquo;s happening i think that&rsquo;s coming so i think that</p>
<p>you know the combination of tariffs and these transfer payments is going to create a real</p>
<p>economic incentive for folks to make these kinds of big technological leaps so i&rsquo;m pretty bullish</p>
<p>on all of that i&rsquo;m less bullish on politicians ability to organize because unfortunately again</p>
<p>this is the first time i really paid attention to cop and it just looked like a bunch of really</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re just a lot of political theater sax does this science conversation about saving</p>
<p>the planet do anything for you would you like to get back i mean i think it&rsquo;s the way to solve the</p>
<p>problem is you have to figure out new technologies to actually take carbon out of the atmosphere</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not going to do it through you know these political programs i mean you know</p>
<p>china india paying them and another developing nations 1.3 trillion a year i mean foreign aid</p>
<p>already is one of the least popular parts of of the government&rsquo;s budget you&rsquo;re going to now pay</p>
<p>1.3 trillion to these countries so that they it&rsquo;s nonsense and you&rsquo;re going to pay put that money</p>
<p>into our education system nobody&rsquo;s going to science and technology that solves the problem</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s going to stand for that yeah and you know the taxes or education system right pour it</p>
<p>in yeah i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a political solution to this problem that&rsquo;s going to be palatable to</p>
<p>people i think it&rsquo;s going to have to be solved through new technology now let me ask you a</p>
<p>question freeberg you said there&rsquo;s a six step process given your experience building science</p>
<p>and technology products is it possible for each of those six steps to get but 20% more efficient</p>
<p>a year yeah look i mean um i just say that to describe that there&rsquo;s a series of steps in the</p>
<p>system it you know um but uh at the end of the day this is a demonstration of science that has been</p>
<p>you know probably funded to some small amount but you know if you start to iterate on this approach</p>
<p>and think big picture and think infrastructure solution here uh there&rsquo;s a lot of room for</p>
<p>improvement i&rsquo;m sure so in other words you&rsquo;re back of the envelope 25 by 25 mile if this is getting</p>
<p>50% more efficient 25% more efficient year over year we could see it becoming you know twice as</p>
<p>efficient every two to three years and your 25 mile might be a five mile radius city i mean think</p>
<p>about going to mars right what are we going to do in mars we&rsquo;re not going to grow friggin fields of</p>
<p>corn and grow cows and stuff right you&rsquo;re going to need a system that literally takes the molecules</p>
<p>that are in the atmosphere there uses some electricity that&rsquo;s probably going to be produced</p>
<p>by a nuclear power plant and convert those molecules into what you want to make and consume</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what we can do on earth today the systems are going to get better they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to get cheaper they&rsquo;re going to get faster and that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m highly optimistic about solutions</p>
<p>to climate change in the century it&rsquo;s not about an if it&rsquo;s about a when and you know the when is</p>
<p>going to be defined by the willpower of how we are going to allocate our people and our capital</p>
<p>resources to solve these problems in the near term we have the tools to do it i love the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re sort of hitting this fork in the road where it&rsquo;s like do we just want to give the money</p>
<p>to a bunch of governments to pretend they&rsquo;re going to solve this and grifters or do we want</p>
<p>to put it into science technology innovation and entrepreneur hands that execute execute</p>
<p>what&rsquo;d you say i picked the former we should yeah let&rsquo;s give it to politicians who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what the fuck they&rsquo;re doing i mean it really is like when you know i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you saw ilan say like yeah if you want to solve world hunger can you make us can you</p>
<p>oh my god let&rsquo;s talk about that that&rsquo;s just so beautiful i thought that was like the greatest</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dunk of the week nothing nothing gets me up in the morning like funding shenanigans</p>
<p>right go ahead jake i&rsquo;ll tell the story i mean just somebody was like oh ilan you know made</p>
<p>more money it&rsquo;s tesla stocks no no an article it was an article that was rude sure and then</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like well if you want to solve world hunger i&rsquo;m willing to sell shares jason can you describe</p>
<p>it you&rsquo;re doing such a shitty job today as a moderator what are you talking about i&rsquo;ll play</p>
<p>your role all i did was put a cyst in your hands you guys dunked everything but to the audience</p>
<p>there was an article voice dude in his voice yeah hey guys and there was an article stop</p>
<p>there was an article that was written that basically said you know um you know 6.8 billion</p>
<p>dollars uh which is you know what ilan made like in a day or something could cure world hunger</p>
<p>and uh then the head of the you know uh un world food program retweeted that</p>
<p>again trying to further dunk on ilan and then um ilan responded well if you can just show me</p>
<p>a plan and just please reply in line here on twitter and it&rsquo;s credible and detailed i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>just sell you know this talk and i&rsquo;ll give it to you and uh everybody was like oh my god there</p>
<p>was this oh my god moment like wow can this really happen ending world hunger sounds like a beautiful</p>
<p>idea it can only does only cost you know 6.8 billion dollars and obviously it went nowhere</p>
<p>because the guy didn&rsquo;t have a plan and it was just a complete joke but that&rsquo;s what happened</p>
<p>yeah and he&rsquo;s like yeah just put all of your uh put all of your expenses out there show us your</p>
<p>plan and it was like oh crickets nothing all right everybody on behalf of the dictator chamath</p>
<p>palihapitiya the queen of quinoa the sultan of science david friedberg and for the rain man</p>
<p>himself reporting from definitely reporting from yeah he&rsquo;s reporting from the new york stock</p>
<p>exchange congratulations again my bestie david sacks on the triumphant ipo of bird we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>you all next time on the all-in podcast bye-bye we&rsquo;ll let your winners ride rain man david sacks</p>
<p>and instead we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it</p>
<p>love you</p>
<p>we should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re about to be</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a bee</p>
<p>we need to get merch</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing all in</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing all in</p>
