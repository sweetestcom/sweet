<p>crime and you would like makeup i</p>

<p>cause i&rsquo;m here for you it&rsquo;s a fact</p>
<p>i wanted to show you guys this i thought this was a</p>
<p>great quote</p>
<p>which pretty much sums up</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s video like</p>
<p>perfectly i don&rsquo;t know who like</p>
<p>said it though</p>
<p>it says proverb does that mean it came from the</p>
<p>bible no proverb</p>
<p>i should have googled more the quote is</p>
<p>no one will have a greater wrath or vengeance than a</p>
<p>woman when she has been wronged</p>
<p>most men find out the hard way that hell hath no fury</p>
<p>like a woman scorned</p>
<p>deep and that my friends brings us to today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story which is just this in a nutshell</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about cordelia brown</p>
<p>have you heard of her</p>
<p>she was born in eighteen fifty four</p>
<p>in kansas city missouri there&rsquo;s really not much known</p>
<p>about her upbringing or how her life was growing up</p>
<p>but what we do know is that on september twenty sixth</p>
<p>eighteen seventy two eighteen year old cordelia</p>
<p>married thirty</p>
<p>three year old</p>
<p>welcome botkin</p>
<p>who worked as a wealthy grain broker</p>
<p>yes his name is welcome</p>
<p>welcome get your ass over here welcome welcome</p>
<p>welcome okay so welcome welcome he worked as a wealthy</p>
<p>grain broker so they get married and they&rsquo;re living in</p>
<p>kansas city missouri</p>
<p>and then they welcomed</p>
<p>that was so dumb but like i just anyways they welcomed</p>
<p>their son beverly</p>
<p>in 1874 so they</p>
<p>lived the simple kind of life and then in the late</p>
<p>eighteen eighties</p>
<p>welcome was offered a new job as a salesman for the</p>
<p>armor packing company</p>
<p>so they decided to move out to</p>
<p>stockton california for this new job opportunity</p>
<p>so who was cordelia well</p>
<p>cordelia was described as a</p>
<p>short and stout</p>
<p>woman i&rsquo;m not trying to</p>
<p>shame here you know i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>making an observation but she kind of looks like agatha</p>
<p>trunchbull from the</p>
<p>movie matilda</p>
<p>right she kinda does</p>
<p>so with that being said</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>would consider</p>
<p>cordelia to have a frumpy appearance</p>
<p>she was not the best looking but cordelia</p>
<p>she believed she was hot</p>
<p>shit like you couldn&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>cordelia nothing okay she was god&rsquo;s gift to the</p>
<p>worlds cordelia</p>
<p>would brag to friends</p>
<p>about being</p>
<p>photographed in over a hundred different poses</p>
<p>which us the</p>
<p>selfie nation may not seem like that big of a deal but</p>
<p>back then in the victorian era</p>
<p>the 1880s getting</p>
<p>photographed was a really big deal</p>
<p>one of her favorite</p>
<p>poses was her</p>
<p>standing with her hands up behind her head</p>
<p>and her elbows out</p>
<p>having or posing with your</p>
<p>arms behind your head makes your face and your boobs</p>
<p>the focus of the image</p>
<p>which was a big no no</p>
<p>in the victorian era being sexy</p>
<p>i mean they</p>
<p>would acknowledge</p>
<p>sex but you had to be more secretive</p>
<p>about it and you</p>
<p>definitely couldn&rsquo;t be overtly sexual</p>
<p>which cordelia</p>
<p>definitely was in some of her</p>
<p>photographs</p>
<p>now in 1894</p>
<p>cordelia and her husband welcome</p>
<p>their marriage wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it just wasn&rsquo;t working out okay welcome was very proper</p>
<p>and prim and</p>
<p>cordelia just liked</p>
<p>more fun things in life like gambling and</p>
<p>drinking and</p>
<p>because this is the 1880s or whatever divorce</p>
<p>it really wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>thing back then you know</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t chat you nope</p>
<p>mm hmm you couldn&rsquo;t do that so they just decided to go</p>
<p>their separate ways but</p>
<p>still remain</p>
<p>married because</p>
<p>that was really</p>
<p>their only option</p>
<p>so once they separate</p>
<p>cordelia takes</p>
<p>her son and then they move to san francisco</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s more of a</p>
<p>party life out there a little bit more fun</p>
<p>cordelia is single</p>
<p>and ready to</p>
<p>mingle welcome</p>
<p>stayed in stockton</p>
<p>where his job was and he</p>
<p>would come he</p>
<p>would come out there to pay her</p>
<p>alimony every</p>
<p>month he was</p>
<p>involved in his own scandal</p>
<p>when he came out to pay cordelia</p>
<p>her alimony</p>
<p>he would meet</p>
<p>with the landlady</p>
<p>her name was clara</p>
<p>and they were having like</p>
<p>their own affair</p>
<p>that was going on between the two of them so in 1895</p>
<p>cordelia who is now 41</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s living in san francisco with her son</p>
<p>she goes down to the park next to the golden gate</p>
<p>bridge to meet with a friend and just like have a chat</p>
<p>while there that&rsquo;s when a 32</p>
<p>year old man</p>
<p>named john dunning</p>
<p>was riding his bicycle</p>
<p>and his bicycle</p>
<p>broke down so he stops he like fixes the wheel</p>
<p>and then he notices</p>
<p>a beautiful</p>
<p>woman who&rsquo;s sitting on the</p>
<p>bench she&rsquo;s like oh my god</p>
<p>you are the most beautiful</p>
<p>creature i have ever seen on this planet the beautiful</p>
<p>woman was cordelia</p>
<p>love at first</p>
<p>sight back then</p>
<p>cause remember</p>
<p>olden days it was very scandalous for a man and a</p>
<p>woman to interact without a formal introduction</p>
<p>but john said that there was just something</p>
<p>about cordelia&rsquo;s energy that he was attracted</p>
<p>to and john knew that he just needed to talk to her</p>
<p>so he goes up to her he introduces himself and they</p>
<p>begin chatting away</p>
<p>now this john guy he was a big wig reporter for</p>
<p>their associated press</p>
<p>he had recently returned from an overseas assignment</p>
<p>where he was reporting on the war that was</p>
<p>about to take</p>
<p>place between the us</p>
<p>great britain</p>
<p>and imperial germany over samoa</p>
<p>i know so a big typhoon</p>
<p>hits this island</p>
<p>sank a bunch of</p>
<p>ships it was a</p>
<p>whole situation we</p>
<p>could do like another</p>
<p>video on it</p>
<p>but john&rsquo;s there and he&rsquo;s writing an article</p>
<p>about it and it was hot gossip</p>
<p>nobody could put it down it</p>
<p>was just everybody read it and because of this it also</p>
<p>promoted him to the</p>
<p>superintendent of the associated press</p>
<p>their western division</p>
<p>which was in uh</p>
<p>san francisco</p>
<p>you get it you get it</p>
<p>so john he was</p>
<p>married and he had a wife</p>
<p>named mary elizabeth</p>
<p>and the two of them had</p>
<p>moved to san francisco in 1891</p>
<p>soon after they had a</p>
<p>daughter who they also</p>
<p>named mary anytime i talk</p>
<p>about the wife i&rsquo;ll say mary elizabeth</p>
<p>so you know it&rsquo;s the wife and not the</p>
<p>child but mary elizabeth was</p>
<p>she was not</p>
<p>adjusting to life in san francisco very well and</p>
<p>she just really badly wanted to move back to delaware</p>
<p>she was becoming</p>
<p>frustrated in the</p>
<p>marriage because her</p>
<p>faith was really important to her</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t important to john</p>
<p>at all really</p>
<p>so their marriage is really</p>
<p>rocky it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going great</p>
<p>what more can you say really</p>
<p>so when john met cordelia</p>
<p>they had this instant</p>
<p>connection they couldn&rsquo;t stay away from each other</p>
<p>the two of them</p>
<p>would chat about</p>
<p>their partners</p>
<p>their significant others and</p>
<p>how they just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand them they were bonding over</p>
<p>how their partners</p>
<p>sucked pretty much</p>
<p>which is never good so john was</p>
<p>smitten with</p>
<p>cordelia and what he loved</p>
<p>about her most was that</p>
<p>she was like one of the guys</p>
<p>she like to drink</p>
<p>she like to have sex</p>
<p>and she like to talk</p>
<p>about sex you</p>
<p>would most likely</p>
<p>find her hanging out with the boys down at the brothel</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t like a normal</p>
<p>girl she was a cool girl just one of the guys you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just one of the guys</p>
<p>i just like beer and sports and</p>
<p>stuff like yeah</p>
<p>so cordelia and john were hanging out like all</p>
<p>the time okay</p>
<p>cordelia would</p>
<p>bring john to</p>
<p>some of her favorite hangout spots in san francisco</p>
<p>and they were like not the most</p>
<p>up and up places i guess</p>
<p>she would take them to the gambling saloons</p>
<p>brothels dark bars</p>
<p>and this was all like new to john</p>
<p>he had never seen this side of san francisco i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming here i&rsquo;m not i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>speak for john of course but it seemed like</p>
<p>he was just</p>
<p>excited with it all</p>
<p>cause it was just all new he never</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>do this at all</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t long before the two of them</p>
<p>were wrapped up in parting</p>
<p>drinking and a gambling lifestyle</p>
<p>and that wasn&rsquo;t all that they were</p>
<p>wrapped up in</p>
<p>wink wink because they were also</p>
<p>wrapped up in each other</p>
<p>aka they were having a lot of</p>
<p>sexual relations with each other</p>
<p>they were getting down and dirty</p>
<p>which is fine we&rsquo;re not judging it&rsquo;s just that john</p>
<p>still married</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>you know in the neighborhood</p>
<p>cordelia had quite the</p>
<p>reputation it was not a good one it was a very bad one</p>
<p>remember how i talked</p>
<p>about like cordelia</p>
<p>hanging out with the guys and she was like a guys girl</p>
<p>well the women they didn&rsquo;t like that and</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the victorian era</p>
<p>they were very</p>
<p>strict and extremely judgmental back then like</p>
<p>oh right oh like when you brought up</p>
<p>cordelia&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>a look of disgust</p>
<p>would come over everyone&rsquo;s faces like she was just</p>
<p>known as this is</p>
<p>gonna sound mean</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t say it but she was like</p>
<p>known as the town</p>
<p>horror you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry cordelia</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t come for me from the</p>
<p>grave i didn&rsquo;t say it</p>
<p>your peers did</p>
<p>john was being sloppy</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t trying</p>
<p>to hide the fact that he was having an affair</p>
<p>or hide the fact</p>
<p>that he was hanging out with his new friend cordelia</p>
<p>which led to people seeing them and everybody</p>
<p>talking rumors are</p>
<p>swirling you know</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t long</p>
<p>until john&rsquo;s wife mary elizabeth</p>
<p>found out about his affair mary</p>
<p>john&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>she would stay with john for</p>
<p>about a year</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>trying to figure out what exactly her plan was you know</p>
<p>because she was feeling</p>
<p>super embarrassed</p>
<p>everybody seemed to know</p>
<p>about this affair that her husband&rsquo;s having with</p>
<p>cordelia she&rsquo;s humiliated</p>
<p>how dare you like</p>
<p>with her ah</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to figure out what her plan is what is she</p>
<p>gonna do but i i couldn&rsquo;t imagine how mary</p>
<p>was feeling because</p>
<p>she moves to</p>
<p>this new location for her husband&rsquo;s new job</p>
<p>right she doesn&rsquo;t like it there she&rsquo;s having a hard</p>
<p>time struggling just finding her way in san francisco</p>
<p>and she voices her husband that she&rsquo;s unhappy</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s never around he&rsquo;s always working</p>
<p>and then he has an affair on her</p>
<p>with this woman</p>
<p>cordelia and she&rsquo;s like dude</p>
<p>really mm hmm</p>
<p>so with all this</p>
<p>in 1896 mary elizabeth decides to</p>
<p>leave him and she returns to dover</p>
<p>delaware to live with her</p>
<p>mother and father</p>
<p>his name was john</p>
<p>b pennington</p>
<p>he was a working congressman</p>
<p>in delaware he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like a big deal out there you know</p>
<p>man of importance</p>
<p>so mary elizabeth takes her little</p>
<p>daughter mary with her</p>
<p>and she gets out of san francisco</p>
<p>moves in with her parents</p>
<p>and decides just to move on with her life</p>
<p>so now that mary elizabeth is gone</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s out of the way</p>
<p>right john and</p>
<p>cordelia are like hey</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re free you know they&rsquo;re getting it on like</p>
<p>teens on spring break</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lots of alcohol there&rsquo;s gambling lots of sex</p>
<p>john who hasn&rsquo;t been living this</p>
<p>party lifestyle as long as</p>
<p>cordelia has</p>
<p>i think he just or he does get</p>
<p>really wrapped up in and all</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t keep his shit together he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going hard you know</p>
<p>those people who are like new to the</p>
<p>party game and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just being</p>
<p>idiots sloppy</p>
<p>drunks losing all</p>
<p>their money</p>
<p>that was john</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just like fool what are you doing calm down</p>
<p>john&rsquo;s gambling</p>
<p>becomes out</p>
<p>of control and he racks up a huge debt so now debt</p>
<p>collectors are on his ass and john</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>money so john&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinking if i can just take some</p>
<p>money from my job and gamble that</p>
<p>money then i</p>
<p>could probably make money</p>
<p>pay off my debts</p>
<p>put the money back and nobody will know</p>
<p>great plan always seems to work</p>
<p>right and like how</p>
<p>usually most gambling addictions go</p>
<p>you dig yourself into a deep</p>
<p>deep hole so</p>
<p>john ends up stealing</p>
<p>about four thousand dollars from his job</p>
<p>which in today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>money would be</p>
<p>about a hundred and</p>
<p>twenty six thousand dollars to pay off of</p>
<p>his gambling debts</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t take long</p>
<p>until his place of work</p>
<p>found out that he was indeed</p>
<p>stealing money</p>
<p>and then john gets fired</p>
<p>i know i&rsquo;m surprised</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t go to prison for this but i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the relationship between john and cordelia</p>
<p>would end up lasting almost</p>
<p>three years</p>
<p>and then in</p>
<p>march of 1898 the associated press</p>
<p>they were looking for a top notch reporter</p>
<p>to do an excellent reporting because the united</p>
<p>states was on the brink</p>
<p>of what was</p>
<p>about to become the spanish american war so they need</p>
<p>someone to report</p>
<p>on this and john is like the best of the best</p>
<p>so john gets hired for the job</p>
<p>and he has this moment of clarity where</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like okay i got this this</p>
<p>great job opportunity</p>
<p>i gotta stop</p>
<p>parting this lifestyle</p>
<p>cordelia like</p>
<p>all of this just isn&rsquo;t for me anymore john</p>
<p>realized that he missed his wife</p>
<p>and he realized that</p>
<p>the new job opportunity was a way for him to get out</p>
<p>so john goes to</p>
<p>cordelia and he tells her hey</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going away on assignment</p>
<p>and things are over between us</p>
<p>he also went</p>
<p>on to say that when he&rsquo;s done with the assignment he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go back to delaware and try and</p>
<p>win his wife back because he missed her deeply typical</p>
<p>now you want me back cute</p>
<p>mm hmm how do you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go over i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go over</p>
<p>smoothly this news to</p>
<p>cordelia was devastating</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s begging him not to go</p>
<p>but he tells her like no he has</p>
<p>to do this i&rsquo;m leaving this just isn&rsquo;t for me anymore</p>
<p>so john ends up leaving</p>
<p>and he goes to cuba</p>
<p>for his new job opportunity and cordelia</p>
<p>she was not having a good time she was</p>
<p>having a very difficult time her life was now like at</p>
<p>a standstill</p>
<p>she was depressed she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand why john just up and left her how</p>
<p>could he do this she</p>
<p>she gave him a</p>
<p>place to live she gave him</p>
<p>everything now as the days go on her</p>
<p>depression now turns into</p>
<p>anger so cordelia</p>
<p>is thinking if i can&rsquo;t have john</p>
<p>then i guess</p>
<p>nobody could have john</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know you guys i</p>
<p>think he has like beer flavored nipples or something</p>
<p>cause she wants some bad</p>
<p>now back in dover delaware</p>
<p>mary elizabeth john&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>she starts receiving handwritten letters detailing</p>
<p>about the affair</p>
<p>john was having in san francisco</p>
<p>the letters</p>
<p>said john was constantly seen around with an extremely</p>
<p>attractive woman</p>
<p>and that mary elizabeth</p>
<p>should not take john back if he ever</p>
<p>tried to come back to her</p>
<p>now mary elizabeth</p>
<p>is extremely</p>
<p>upset by these letters</p>
<p>but she just</p>
<p>like didn&rsquo;t know what to do with the information</p>
<p>so she takes all the letters and she</p>
<p>stuffs them in a drawer</p>
<p>out of sight</p>
<p>out of mind</p>
<p>so mary elizabeth</p>
<p>had been getting</p>
<p>these letters for</p>
<p>about four or five months</p>
<p>and then on august</p>
<p>ninth eighteen ninety</p>
<p>eight she gets a</p>
<p>knock on the door</p>
<p>she opens the door</p>
<p>and she finds a gift of chocolate bonbons</p>
<p>wrapped in brown</p>
<p>paper with a pink satin ribbon</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like oh my god chocolate</p>
<p>yay so mary opens up</p>
<p>the box and sees that the chocolates are sitting on a</p>
<p>lace handkerchief with the</p>
<p>price tag still attached</p>
<p>and the note reads quote</p>
<p>with love to yourself and baby</p>
<p>miss c and quote</p>
<p>so mary&rsquo;s thinking that the miss c</p>
<p>stood for miss horribly</p>
<p>it was one of</p>
<p>her friends that she made back in san francisco</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s like oh my god that is so</p>
<p>sweet of her i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna save these chocolates for</p>
<p>after dinner</p>
<p>so she puts the chocolates away</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like i cannot wait to</p>
<p>enjoy these</p>
<p>treats you know she had a lot more</p>
<p>self discipline</p>
<p>than i do because i</p>
<p>would have just</p>
<p>eaten the whole box</p>
<p>right then and there</p>
<p>good for her</p>
<p>so mary elizabeth</p>
<p>and her family sit down and have dinner her</p>
<p>sister and niece also came over to have dinner with the</p>
<p>whole family they had trout</p>
<p>in corn fritters for dinner mmm</p>
<p>so delicious</p>
<p>so again olden days no ac</p>
<p>so when you cooked</p>
<p>especially with like a</p>
<p>stove and stuff</p>
<p>it would get</p>
<p>brutally hot in the</p>
<p>house so again because it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>freaking hot</p>
<p>they go and they sit out on the</p>
<p>front porch</p>
<p>and they try to just sit there</p>
<p>cool off with the</p>
<p>nighttime breeze</p>
<p>while sitting there you</p>
<p>guessed it mary was like oh my god i</p>
<p>should go get</p>
<p>those chocolates</p>
<p>right now we can</p>
<p>enjoy them while we sit here on the</p>
<p>porch great idea</p>
<p>so she goes she gets the lovely gift of chocolates</p>
<p>and she before</p>
<p>going out to the porch</p>
<p>she has three</p>
<p>pieces for herself</p>
<p>and then she offered some to her family</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like this is my box i&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>three pieces you guys can only have one</p>
<p>okay now cordelia&rsquo;s older</p>
<p>sister also loves chocolate</p>
<p>so she helped herself to a couple pieces</p>
<p>and then the neighbors</p>
<p>their kids came over and they&rsquo;re just hanging out and</p>
<p>they took one piece each</p>
<p>mary&rsquo;s mom and her dad passed on the chocolate</p>
<p>they were like we don&rsquo;t want any it&rsquo;s okay thank you</p>
<p>so they eat</p>
<p>their chocolate and just</p>
<p>enjoy the evening with each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s company</p>
<p>then a couple of</p>
<p>hours go by</p>
<p>and everyone who</p>
<p>ate the chocolate</p>
<p>started getting really bad stomachaches</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>started barfing</p>
<p>throwing up</p>
<p>oh god now everyone is puking okay</p>
<p>except for dad</p>
<p>mary elizabeth dad he calls</p>
<p>the doctor because everyone is puking and he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>only one who wasn&rsquo;t sick so the doctor comes out and he</p>
<p>thinks that everybody has</p>
<p>food poisoning yeah</p>
<p>food poisoning you know it must be the corn fritters</p>
<p>corn fritters were probably bad</p>
<p>food poisoning but mary elizabeth&rsquo;s dad didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think so because he had corn fritters</p>
<p>and he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>throwing up</p>
<p>after a couple</p>
<p>hours of some</p>
<p>intense puking everyone seemed to get better</p>
<p>except for mary elizabeth and her</p>
<p>sister both of them were just getting</p>
<p>worse so in addition to</p>
<p>vomiting they were also just</p>
<p>experiencing severe</p>
<p>stomach pains like gripping your stomach</p>
<p>jesus i&rsquo;m coming home</p>
<p>kind of pains</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying the</p>
<p>first doctor thought that</p>
<p>their illness was coming from the corn fritters</p>
<p>and mary elizabeth&rsquo;s dad he</p>
<p>knew better he was like it&rsquo;s not the corn fritters okay</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m not sick i</p>
<p>should be sick and he goes with his gut feeling</p>
<p>and he calls another doctor to come and like</p>
<p>check on his daughters</p>
<p>so this doctor he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that it was food poisoning nene</p>
<p>he thinks it&rsquo;s a poisoning poisoning</p>
<p>the doctor tells the</p>
<p>family that he believed they had been badly poisoned</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like oh my god like what</p>
<p>we do with this information that you have just given us</p>
<p>and the doctors like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry there&rsquo;s nothing i can do to save you</p>
<p>have a good day and then he takes off</p>
<p>i know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely useless</p>
<p>other than telling them that</p>
<p>they were poisoned but there was</p>
<p>literally nothing that he</p>
<p>could do for them</p>
<p>he was like good luck by</p>
<p>their death</p>
<p>that these two experienced was pretty hardcore</p>
<p>in addition to the severe</p>
<p>stomach pains they were</p>
<p>also experiencing intense</p>
<p>bloody diarrhea</p>
<p>and delirium</p>
<p>which is basically a fancier word for saying</p>
<p>that they are hallucinating</p>
<p>after a few days of this illness</p>
<p>both mary elizabeth and her</p>
<p>sister die asleep</p>
<p>low and awful</p>
<p>death so mary elizabeth dad</p>
<p>he now just lost</p>
<p>two daughters</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s out for</p>
<p>blood he is</p>
<p>angry he wants to</p>
<p>track down who did this to them he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinking the common</p>
<p>thing was that</p>
<p>mysterious box of chocolate set showed up</p>
<p>right mary elizabeth and her</p>
<p>sisters were</p>
<p>the ones that</p>
<p>ate most of them</p>
<p>and they were the ones that died</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s thinking that can&rsquo;t be a coincidence</p>
<p>you know so what does dad do so he&rsquo;s a smart man</p>
<p>and he takes the few remaining</p>
<p>pieces of chocolate</p>
<p>and he sends them out to be analyzed by a</p>
<p>local chemist by the name of dr wood</p>
<p>now dr wood</p>
<p>his report came</p>
<p>back and said that the chocolates tested positive</p>
<p>for arsenic</p>
<p>arsenic is a chemical element that is</p>
<p>on the scientific</p>
<p>table posted in your high</p>
<p>school chemistry class</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a heavy</p>
<p>metal element commonly used in car batteries</p>
<p>and ammunition</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>found in pesticides but in the victorian era</p>
<p>it was mixed with vinegar and chalk</p>
<p>and it was used as like a skin</p>
<p>lightener by</p>
<p>high society</p>
<p>ladies who just wanted to you</p>
<p>know look very pale as if they did not work out in the</p>
<p>fields because that was the look back then</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to tan</p>
<p>you want to be white as</p>
<p>but one of the more</p>
<p>famous uses of</p>
<p>arsenic was as a poison</p>
<p>an arsenic is not</p>
<p>a poison you want to mess around with you will suffer</p>
<p>greatly greatly</p>
<p>so with mary elizabeth dead dad knew that he had to</p>
<p>tell his son in law john dunning that his wife that he</p>
<p>planned to come back to had died</p>
<p>so john was obviously no husband of the year but</p>
<p>the dad felt that he deserved to know his wife was dead</p>
<p>john who remember</p>
<p>he still loved to</p>
<p>marry elizabeth very much and wanted to fix his</p>
<p>marriage after he got back from cuba</p>
<p>he was devastated by this</p>
<p>news he packed his bags and he headed straight to dover</p>
<p>delaware as fast as he could</p>
<p>so he gets there in like 10 days</p>
<p>when john gets to dover</p>
<p>mary elizabeth dad tells him</p>
<p>about the chocolates</p>
<p>oh yes so the dad is also</p>
<p>cleaning out his</p>
<p>daughter&rsquo;s things</p>
<p>right and he finds</p>
<p>those strange letters that were shoved in a drawer</p>
<p>now since john was obviously the topic of</p>
<p>conversation in the letters</p>
<p>the dad he shows them to john he&rsquo;s like look what i</p>
<p>found these</p>
<p>weird letters someone was writing my daughter</p>
<p>and your name</p>
<p>is mentioned practically on every page</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>here in this letter that you&rsquo;re having an affair</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been seen around town with some beautiful</p>
<p>woman who is not my daughter</p>
<p>explain yourself like what is this situation</p>
<p>okay john takes</p>
<p>one look at the letters and he knows exactly who</p>
<p>wrote them so he tells the dad look</p>
<p>i know whose handwriting this is</p>
<p>i was seeing this</p>
<p>woman named</p>
<p>cordelia botkin</p>
<p>but i broke</p>
<p>up with her because i missed mary elizabeth too much</p>
<p>told her i was</p>
<p>gonna come back</p>
<p>try and fix my</p>
<p>marriage and i</p>
<p>guess she just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t take the news so well dad then hands john the</p>
<p>card from the box of chocolates and asks if he thinks</p>
<p>cordelia this</p>
<p>cordelia woman</p>
<p>was the one who</p>
<p>wrote the card too now john takes a look at this and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s pissed because the card has the same handwriting</p>
<p>as the letters</p>
<p>which means</p>
<p>cordelia most likely</p>
<p>wrote the note herself</p>
<p>which means</p>
<p>cordelia probably sent</p>
<p>those box of chocolates</p>
<p>which meant</p>
<p>that cordelia most likely murdered his wife</p>
<p>so john tells</p>
<p>his father in law that he remember telling</p>
<p>cordelia how much of a</p>
<p>crazy sweet</p>
<p>tooth mary elizabeth had</p>
<p>and she must have like</p>
<p>stashed that in her noggin you know filed that away</p>
<p>and use it against her he also</p>
<p>might have mentioned that mary elizabeth had a friend</p>
<p>named miss corbele</p>
<p>who lived in san francisco</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s maybe</p>
<p>where she got the name</p>
<p>miss c from that was on the letter so</p>
<p>after all of this dad</p>
<p>is obviously mad he&rsquo;s pissed off because he knows or he</p>
<p>thinks he knows 100</p>
<p>like who killed</p>
<p>his daughters and he wants justice</p>
<p>and this dad</p>
<p>is also a congressman so he knows that he can&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>committing revenge murder the next best</p>
<p>thing that he can do is call the police</p>
<p>so he does so he calls the dover police</p>
<p>and the dover police</p>
<p>department calls the san francisco police because</p>
<p>they needed help the box of chocolates was purchased</p>
<p>in san francisco</p>
<p>and san francisco police</p>
<p>would have a better chance</p>
<p>of hunting down</p>
<p>where cordelia was out</p>
<p>than the dover</p>
<p>police right since</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re different cities</p>
<p>a detective from dover</p>
<p>hand delivers the</p>
<p>murder evidence to the san francisco pd</p>
<p>this included</p>
<p>the remaining</p>
<p>candy the paper it came in the handkerchief</p>
<p>and the san francisco police</p>
<p>isaiah w lees he wasted no time</p>
<p>and immediately gets to work</p>
<p>building a case</p>
<p>against cordelia fun</p>
<p>isaiah lees</p>
<p>this guy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically the godfather of the</p>
<p>modern day mug shot he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily invent the</p>
<p>mug shot but in a way he kind of did because he was the</p>
<p>first police officer to make it a regular</p>
<p>thing when criminals were arrested right</p>
<p>he started collecting</p>
<p>pictures of</p>
<p>these criminals</p>
<p>starting in 1854</p>
<p>and by the time that 1898 rolled around</p>
<p>his police department had the largest</p>
<p>collection of criminal</p>
<p>photos i thought that was cool</p>
<p>anyways we don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>cordelia had a lengthy rap</p>
<p>sheet at all but</p>
<p>based on her behaviors you</p>
<p>know one could assume</p>
<p>that she may have</p>
<p>which meant that they may have had a</p>
<p>photo of her</p>
<p>and this would be</p>
<p>super useful</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s funny because</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>cordelia meant when she said that she had over 100</p>
<p>photographs</p>
<p>taken of her anyhow</p>
<p>back to the case</p>
<p>so the first</p>
<p>thing isaiah lees did was figure out</p>
<p>where the box of chocolates came from</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t so hard because the</p>
<p>brown paper and pink satin bow</p>
<p>the box was</p>
<p>wrapped in was pretty well</p>
<p>known around san francisco</p>
<p>those were the</p>
<p>wrappings at george haas</p>
<p>confectionery a popular</p>
<p>candy store used to gift wrap</p>
<p>their chocolates</p>
<p>now this george haas</p>
<p>confectionery they had four locations</p>
<p>which was like a big deal back then</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>everyone recognized the ribbon but most of all</p>
<p>it was gonna be a little bit more challenging to</p>
<p>track down the exact</p>
<p>store that the</p>
<p>was sold at</p>
<p>but finally</p>
<p>after going to</p>
<p>question everybody at the different</p>
<p>candy stores the chocolate</p>
<p>stores they find the</p>
<p>store clerk who remembered</p>
<p>selling half a box of chocolate bonbons on july 31st</p>
<p>to a woman who was</p>
<p>short stout and kind of frumpy looking</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like hey that kind of</p>
<p>sounds like cordelia</p>
<p>and the clerk remembered that it was</p>
<p>weird that the woman</p>
<p>only wanted half a box of</p>
<p>candy so he asked her</p>
<p>why do you only want half like who gives half empty box</p>
<p>of chocolates as a gift</p>
<p>and the woman buying the chocolates told the clerk</p>
<p>that she planned</p>
<p>on adding in her own homemade chocolate to the box</p>
<p>which is weird because if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go out of your way to buy</p>
<p>like top notch</p>
<p>chocolates as a gift</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re an amazing</p>
<p>baker why would you put in your own homemade ones</p>
<p>okay cordelia</p>
<p>sure you know</p>
<p>also it was</p>
<p>found that on the handkerchief that was left in the box</p>
<p>it had a price tag left on it</p>
<p>so this led the investigators to the city of</p>
<p>paris department</p>
<p>store which at the time</p>
<p>was san francisco&rsquo;s most important department store</p>
<p>so they go down to the department</p>
<p>store and they talk to a sales</p>
<p>woman by the name of miss grace</p>
<p>harris now she remembered the customer</p>
<p>who purchased the handkerchief because</p>
<p>she thought that the</p>
<p>woman looked just like her dead</p>
<p>mother this saleswoman</p>
<p>also had like a</p>
<p>picture of her mom with her</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like she looks like my dead mom</p>
<p>and let me tell you this</p>
<p>woman&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>mother was like a dead ringer for</p>
<p>cordelia they</p>
<p>could have been twins they</p>
<p>could have been</p>
<p>sisters she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wrong but she remembered her</p>
<p>cause she told</p>
<p>cordelia you look just like my dead mom wow</p>
<p>and she just remembered her</p>
<p>now there weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>many post office locations in the same area as the</p>
<p>stores so it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>too hard to find the post office attendant who helped a</p>
<p>woman ship a box</p>
<p>that was wrapped in</p>
<p>brown paper with a pink</p>
<p>the clerk a man</p>
<p>named john dunnegan</p>
<p>he had no problem</p>
<p>remembering the package sent to miss john dunning</p>
<p>because he thought</p>
<p>oh my god it</p>
<p>sounds just like my name</p>
<p>because his name is john dunnegan</p>
<p>i know this is getting confusing but he just remembered</p>
<p>the box being</p>
<p>shipped out and</p>
<p>the detective is like okay can you tell us what the</p>
<p>woman look like</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like oh yeah it was this stout frumpy looking</p>
<p>woman and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not looking good for cordelia</p>
<p>so they had</p>
<p>three clues down and they had one to go</p>
<p>the last piece of the puzzle</p>
<p>was the arsenic</p>
<p>where did it come from</p>
<p>and this one</p>
<p>seemed to be the hardest part for police to figure out</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wrapped up in a nice pretty bow like</p>
<p>everything else was</p>
<p>and they couldn&rsquo;t find any leads as far as the</p>
<p>arsenic went but</p>
<p>right before they were</p>
<p>about to give</p>
<p>up they finally talked to a clerk at the owl drug</p>
<p>store who remembered selling</p>
<p>arsenic to a</p>
<p>woman who surprise surprise</p>
<p>also resembled cordelia</p>
<p>now it was really looking like</p>
<p>cordelia bought the chocolates and poisoned them with</p>
<p>arsenic before mailing them</p>
<p>to mary elizabeth</p>
<p>but the san francisco police department</p>
<p>had two more leads that they needed to follow up on</p>
<p>they obtained a</p>
<p>search warrant</p>
<p>for the room that</p>
<p>cordelia was staying at</p>
<p>in the victoria</p>
<p>hotel to see if they could find</p>
<p>anything else</p>
<p>so they get into</p>
<p>cordelia&rsquo;s home she&rsquo;s not there</p>
<p>great we already know</p>
<p>cordelia is kind of sloppy</p>
<p>with this her</p>
<p>killing job so when they go inside they see that</p>
<p>she left the leftover string</p>
<p>and wrapping</p>
<p>paper that matched the box of chocolates in her room</p>
<p>after she left</p>
<p>like she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>throw it away so she practically left</p>
<p>the smoking gun in her</p>
<p>hotel room is what i&rsquo;m getting at like girl</p>
<p>come on the</p>
<p>final lead that the san francisco police</p>
<p>department needed to follow up on were the letters</p>
<p>that were sent</p>
<p>to mary elizabeth so a</p>
<p>local handwriting</p>
<p>expert he analyzes</p>
<p>the handwriting on the note that came with the chalk</p>
<p>lens and the anonymous</p>
<p>letters that were sent to mary elizabeth now in the</p>
<p>experts opinion</p>
<p>there was no question</p>
<p>the note and letters were written by the same person</p>
<p>and when compared to the love letters that</p>
<p>cordelia had written to john</p>
<p>it seemed like a pretty opening shut</p>
<p>case cordelia</p>
<p>was the killer and they had caught her red</p>
<p>so on october</p>
<p>28th 1989 chief lees</p>
<p>presented his case</p>
<p>against cordelia before the grand jury</p>
<p>he was pretty confident that they</p>
<p>would charge</p>
<p>cordelia with murder but he also knew his case had two</p>
<p>super large holes</p>
<p>the first hole</p>
<p>was that not all the chocolates tested positive for</p>
<p>arsenic this could be</p>
<p>potentially a huge problem because</p>
<p>the second hole was</p>
<p>about the size of two graves</p>
<p>meaning no one bothered to do an autopsy</p>
<p>on either mary elizabeth or the</p>
<p>sister before they were buried so technically</p>
<p>liz had no concrete</p>
<p>proof that the two of them died from</p>
<p>arsenic poisoning in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>so remember</p>
<p>mary elizabeth&rsquo;s dad was</p>
<p>super on top of</p>
<p>stuff so why he didn&rsquo;t have an autopsy</p>
<p>done on his</p>
<p>daughters is kind of like why didn&rsquo;t you do that sir</p>
<p>but this one was a little</p>
<p>more out of his jurisdiction because the doctor in</p>
<p>charge of the hospital morgue believed that the girls</p>
<p>vomited so much</p>
<p>that they had</p>
<p>most likely purged the poison out of</p>
<p>their system</p>
<p>so there was no</p>
<p>point in doing</p>
<p>an autopsy because the doctor was confident he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be able to find any</p>
<p>traces of it</p>
<p>today we know</p>
<p>that the doctor had no idea what he was talking</p>
<p>about i mean most doctors at the time didn&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s face it medicine</p>
<p>at that time</p>
<p>it was like the</p>
<p>stone ages you know people were just kind of</p>
<p>guessing but a</p>
<p>toxicologist</p>
<p>today would have</p>
<p>known that traces of arsenic</p>
<p>would have remained in the bones fingernails and hair</p>
<p>but 1898 they didn&rsquo;t have that knowledge yet so</p>
<p>probably barfed it up</p>
<p>so liz was super concerned that this no autopsy report</p>
<p>thing was going to be a deal</p>
<p>breaker for the</p>
<p>grand jury but</p>
<p>they surprised him</p>
<p>it turns out that the grand jury</p>
<p>felt that the san francisco police department</p>
<p>had done enough of</p>
<p>their homework</p>
<p>that not having this</p>
<p>piece of evidence was really not that big of a deal</p>
<p>they barely</p>
<p>blinked an eye when they indicted</p>
<p>cordelia on two</p>
<p>counts of first degree murder</p>
<p>police found</p>
<p>cordelia at her</p>
<p>sister&rsquo;s house in</p>
<p>heldsburg california</p>
<p>and they arrested her now this arrest didn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>quite the way that the police anticipated</p>
<p>they were hoping she</p>
<p>would just confess to the murders and they could</p>
<p>all skip the</p>
<p>trial and the mountain of</p>
<p>paperwork that was probably gonna come</p>
<p>along with it</p>
<p>get that too you know</p>
<p>but cordelia surprise them</p>
<p>not only did she refuse to confess</p>
<p>but she decided to fuck with the</p>
<p>police who came to arrest her when the police showed up</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>pack your things you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to jail</p>
<p>and cordelia said you know sure</p>
<p>thing just wait</p>
<p>right here and i&rsquo;ll go pack and</p>
<p>boy did she pack</p>
<p>she packed her</p>
<p>trunk so heavy that it took</p>
<p>two police officers to</p>
<p>carry it out of there</p>
<p>i guess she figured that she was probably</p>
<p>going away for a</p>
<p>while and she needed</p>
<p>every outfit she owned</p>
<p>or she was stalling</p>
<p>now this case was interesting because it was the</p>
<p>first case of murder</p>
<p>by mail oh yes</p>
<p>but it was also the</p>
<p>first american prosecution for a</p>
<p>crime that took</p>
<p>place in two</p>
<p>different jurisdictions</p>
<p>the state of</p>
<p>california and the</p>
<p>state of delaware</p>
<p>rattled it out for a hot</p>
<p>minute over who was</p>
<p>going to oversee the</p>
<p>court proceedings now delaware</p>
<p>argued that</p>
<p>cordelia should be</p>
<p>tried in dover</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the actual murder took place</p>
<p>but california said no way you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>extradite a person to a</p>
<p>place where they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never been before</p>
<p>and california</p>
<p>ended up winning that argument</p>
<p>and cordelia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trial began</p>
<p>on december 6 1898</p>
<p>now it was no big surprise when</p>
<p>cordelia pleaded not guilty</p>
<p>before the san francisco</p>
<p>judge but what was a big surprise was how</p>
<p>fascinated the city of san francisco was by the whole</p>
<p>thing and it turned into a</p>
<p>media circus</p>
<p>so this case was getting a lot of attention</p>
<p>people were packing the courtroom</p>
<p>to the gills they were just eating up</p>
<p>all this drama</p>
<p>they were fascinated</p>
<p>fascinated by</p>
<p>cordelia&rsquo;s private life</p>
<p>and her sexual</p>
<p>and discretions</p>
<p>the newspapers reported on</p>
<p>cordelia&rsquo;s excessive vanity</p>
<p>they called it they also talked</p>
<p>about her love</p>
<p>for posing for</p>
<p>photographs in a very sexually</p>
<p>suggestive way</p>
<p>of course they&rsquo;re mainly</p>
<p>in the media</p>
<p>focusing on how she looks</p>
<p>and her sexuality</p>
<p>and all of that because</p>
<p>you know she was the villain</p>
<p>you love to hate</p>
<p>and they wanted</p>
<p>every salacious scandalous detail</p>
<p>about her now</p>
<p>victorian era</p>
<p>remember no tv</p>
<p>no trash tv no reality tv right</p>
<p>none of that the people they had to rely</p>
<p>on the san francisco chronicle</p>
<p>and examiner for</p>
<p>their hot gossip</p>
<p>they essentially were the people magazine</p>
<p>of back in the day</p>
<p>in the beginning of cordelia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trial the prosecution laid out a pretty solid case</p>
<p>presented the handwriting analysis that they had done</p>
<p>and they had witnesses</p>
<p>speak about the different items that</p>
<p>cordelia bought</p>
<p>and they also pulled out the string in the brown</p>
<p>paper that were</p>
<p>found in cordelia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hotel room now during all of it</p>
<p>cordelia just</p>
<p>pretty much sat there it was said that she was just</p>
<p>emotionless</p>
<p>nothing now</p>
<p>cordelia would show up to</p>
<p>court very dramatic</p>
<p>she was dressed in like an all</p>
<p>black dress</p>
<p>she would have a white</p>
<p>lace handkerchief in her hand</p>
<p>and it looked like she was</p>
<p>going to a funeral</p>
<p>i just can&rsquo;t imagine how judgmental it was back then</p>
<p>okay the media though they</p>
<p>would describe her as a quote</p>
<p>smug self satisfied</p>
<p>cunning little woman end</p>
<p>quote but they really</p>
<p>painted her as the villain</p>
<p>which i guess she was but</p>
<p>i mean most of all it was selling newspapers more than</p>
<p>anything else they needed this villain to sell papers</p>
<p>now people were so</p>
<p>eager to get a</p>
<p>glimpse of john dunning</p>
<p>they wanted to know what is so special</p>
<p>about this guy that</p>
<p>it was worth murdering over you</p>
<p>know like we have to see what he looks like who is he</p>
<p>so people are just</p>
<p>excited when it was his day to come into the</p>
<p>courtroom he must be</p>
<p>super hot if he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth murdering over right</p>
<p>well when john showed up</p>
<p>people were very</p>
<p>disappointed</p>
<p>when he entered the courtroom</p>
<p>the newspapers described him as</p>
<p>whiny and the</p>
<p>papers also mentioned that he had a good cleft</p>
<p>chin which i</p>
<p>guess is a good</p>
<p>thing but the newspapers also said that john had narrow</p>
<p>shoulders and thinning hair</p>
<p>and they were just</p>
<p>going in on john</p>
<p>and cordelia&rsquo;s looks</p>
<p>not much has</p>
<p>changed huh</p>
<p>so john ends up taking the</p>
<p>stand and the defense questioned him</p>
<p>about the number of</p>
<p>women that he had</p>
<p>slept with in</p>
<p>san francisco they really wanted to show the jurors</p>
<p>that john had many lovers and</p>
<p>any of them</p>
<p>could have been the one that murdered mary elizabeth</p>
<p>and you know what</p>
<p>john tells the</p>
<p>courtroom that he</p>
<p>could not remember</p>
<p>who he slept with or any of</p>
<p>their names</p>
<p>he would go on to say that he</p>
<p>could remember</p>
<p>three names in addition to</p>
<p>cordelia&rsquo;s but he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to say who they were and what</p>
<p>their names were</p>
<p>the prosecution</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t having any of that</p>
<p>so they decided to</p>
<p>teach john a lesson and</p>
<p>threw him in jail for the</p>
<p>night they&rsquo;re like hey</p>
<p>maybe sit in your ass in jail</p>
<p>jog your memory</p>
<p>but nope john</p>
<p>still refused</p>
<p>so the judge figures</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put him another</p>
<p>night in jail</p>
<p>maybe that will make him</p>
<p>speak at first i couldn&rsquo;t figure out why they</p>
<p>wanted that information so bad like why does it matter</p>
<p>it makes sense like</p>
<p>they wanted to pin it on somebody else</p>
<p>but john refused to give anyone&rsquo;s names</p>
<p>he did not want</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>these women to be</p>
<p>dragged into this</p>
<p>whole mess and</p>
<p>get thrown into the middle</p>
<p>of all of it and then have a murder pinned on them</p>
<p>so john just he didn&rsquo;t reveal who they were</p>
<p>he kept his</p>
<p>mouth shut bravo</p>
<p>john honestly</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>great cause like it</p>
<p>would have went</p>
<p>completely south</p>
<p>those poor women</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>brought into it</p>
<p>would have been a hot mess so</p>
<p>good for him the defense team they realized we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get any</p>
<p>answers from john so let&rsquo;s just let it go i guess now</p>
<p>when it was</p>
<p>cordelia&rsquo;s turn to take the</p>
<p>stand it was like her</p>
<p>whole presence was</p>
<p>scripted we know</p>
<p>cordelia thought that she was hot shit but her</p>
<p>legal team wanted her to tone it down a little bit</p>
<p>so she spoke with like an upbeat</p>
<p>and pleasant</p>
<p>tone that the defense team thought the jury</p>
<p>would find endearing</p>
<p>they also wanted her to</p>
<p>sound intelligent and independent</p>
<p>right so they&rsquo;re like telling her here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna say here&rsquo;s how you</p>
<p>should talk here&rsquo;s how you</p>
<p>should sit you know it&rsquo;s hard to convict a</p>
<p>woman you like</p>
<p>right during questioning</p>
<p>cordelia did admit</p>
<p>to purchasing</p>
<p>arsenic back in june</p>
<p>which was like</p>
<p>what at this time they didn&rsquo;t know that so she</p>
<p>admits to this</p>
<p>but she said she bought it because she wanted to</p>
<p>clean a straw hat with it</p>
<p>she loved her</p>
<p>straw hat it needs to be</p>
<p>cleaned she was</p>
<p>upset because she didn&rsquo;t see how this</p>
<p>pinned the murder on her because she purchased powdered</p>
<p>arsenic not the crystalline type that was</p>
<p>found in the chocolates</p>
<p>so cordelia also</p>
<p>claimed to have an alibi</p>
<p>that could prove that she did not purchase</p>
<p>the chocolate</p>
<p>or mailed the package on the days in question</p>
<p>but when they told her okay what&rsquo;s your alibi like</p>
<p>bring them in here let&rsquo;s have</p>
<p>them questioned no one ever came forward to support</p>
<p>her alibi call</p>
<p>your mess get it together</p>
<p>the trial only lasted</p>
<p>about three weeks and on the day of closing statements</p>
<p>a line of over 500 people formed outside the courthouse</p>
<p>everyone wanted to be there for the</p>
<p>grand finale</p>
<p>right everyone&rsquo;s trying to get inside</p>
<p>and of course</p>
<p>the courthouse can&rsquo;t fit that many people</p>
<p>so the examiner came up with a</p>
<p>brand new idea</p>
<p>instead of taking the time to collect the news</p>
<p>run back to the</p>
<p>printing press lay out the type and</p>
<p>print of the</p>
<p>trial results</p>
<p>the newspaper</p>
<p>executives decided to do something</p>
<p>super innovative</p>
<p>for this time live</p>
<p>news i know</p>
<p>good for them they</p>
<p>essentially like invented twitter during this</p>
<p>time but they didn&rsquo;t even know it you know they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m exaggerating but</p>
<p>they built this big billboard out of wood in</p>
<p>front of the</p>
<p>courthouse and the reporters they</p>
<p>would rotate running in and out of the</p>
<p>courtroom with</p>
<p>minute by minute updates</p>
<p>that were posted onto</p>
<p>this board which was</p>
<p>large enough for everyone who was</p>
<p>standing outside was able to read this</p>
<p>now so they&rsquo;re updating this</p>
<p>board and people are able to get</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>great on december 30th</p>
<p>after four hours of deliberation</p>
<p>the jury convicted cordelia</p>
<p>of murder and on february 4th</p>
<p>judge cook sentenced her to life in</p>
<p>prison now when</p>
<p>they updated that little</p>
<p>board outside the crowd</p>
<p>erupted everyone</p>
<p>was so excited it was like new year&rsquo;s day</p>
<p>they had nothing else</p>
<p>going on you know it was</p>
<p>exciting to them so</p>
<p>cordelia is carted off to the san francisco jail</p>
<p>but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to stay there that long so</p>
<p>a couple of</p>
<p>months later</p>
<p>it was like a</p>
<p>sunday the judge</p>
<p>judge cook he&rsquo;s out doing some</p>
<p>shopping in downtown san francisco and</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s out doing some</p>
<p>shopping he spots</p>
<p>who he believes is</p>
<p>cordelia out</p>
<p>shopping as well he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s supposed to be in prison</p>
<p>you know why is she running around</p>
<p>shopping what is</p>
<p>going on he was</p>
<p>super confused</p>
<p>and he needed to get to the bottom of this</p>
<p>so instead of approaching her</p>
<p>cause he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna tip her off that he knows and then she</p>
<p>could potentially</p>
<p>run for it he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>and then he decides that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to launch his</p>
<p>own investigation as to why</p>
<p>cordelia was</p>
<p>wandering out and</p>
<p>about free as a bird ma&rsquo;am</p>
<p>you killed someone no</p>
<p>so he discovers that cordelia</p>
<p>was up to her old</p>
<p>tricks again</p>
<p>cordelia was exchanging sexual</p>
<p>favors for shit</p>
<p>you know she managed to get her own private jail cell</p>
<p>a more comfortable mattress and pillows</p>
<p>and the freedom to</p>
<p>leave the prison grounds whenever she wanted</p>
<p>she must have had a</p>
<p>magical hoo ha</p>
<p>if you know</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying like she was getting all sorts of</p>
<p>stuff the judge</p>
<p>tried to get a case</p>
<p>against the</p>
<p>guards because they&rsquo;re obviously like</p>
<p>working with</p>
<p>cordelia here they need to be</p>
<p>fired and then</p>
<p>cordelia needs to lose her privileges</p>
<p>but literally nobody</p>
<p>would admit</p>
<p>about this little</p>
<p>trade that was</p>
<p>going on between</p>
<p>cordelia and the</p>
<p>guards nobody said a word</p>
<p>so it was like they couldn&rsquo;t do anything because</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any they don&rsquo;t even know who&rsquo;s doing it</p>
<p>and then word got to</p>
<p>cordelia that she was spotted out</p>
<p>shopping and she used this to her advantage</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like oh my god look</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t left the prison</p>
<p>so whoever the</p>
<p>judge saw out there</p>
<p>in the city</p>
<p>it must have been the real murderer</p>
<p>and this is just a case of a mistaken</p>
<p>identity so she&rsquo;s trying to milk it like i have</p>
<p>a twin out there who&rsquo;s committing murders</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not me</p>
<p>she thought someone was</p>
<p>gonna believe</p>
<p>it but no one believed her bullshit you know she tried</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re probably wondering what happened to</p>
<p>cordelia&rsquo;s son</p>
<p>yeah i know</p>
<p>you probably forgot she had a son</p>
<p>cause honestly</p>
<p>so did i there&rsquo;s really not much said</p>
<p>about her son beverly</p>
<p>his feelings towards his</p>
<p>mother after the outcome of her</p>
<p>trial what happened to him</p>
<p>where was he during all this you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know nothing</p>
<p>zara but after</p>
<p>cordelia is</p>
<p>found guilty of murder</p>
<p>her husband welcome</p>
<p>finally had the ammunition he needed</p>
<p>to be able to file for divorce</p>
<p>because being</p>
<p>charged with a felony</p>
<p>is a major no no in victorian society</p>
<p>while being</p>
<p>charged with a felony is</p>
<p>still no no</p>
<p>today but back in the victorian</p>
<p>society days</p>
<p>it was a way for you to be able to get out of a</p>
<p>marriage so welcome</p>
<p>wanted a divorce because</p>
<p>cordelia was</p>
<p>found guilty of murder</p>
<p>he was able to get out of the</p>
<p>marriage do</p>
<p>you see what i&rsquo;m saying you do what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>because she</p>
<p>went to prison that was his way out so welcome was</p>
<p>happy because he was</p>
<p>trapped in this loveless useless</p>
<p>marriage and welcome was finally free</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>now mary elizabeth&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>lived just long enough to see justice served he</p>
<p>would go on to die</p>
<p>on june 1st 1902</p>
<p>and then two years</p>
<p>later cordelia&rsquo;s lawyer</p>
<p>tried to file an appeal</p>
<p>and get her conviction overturned she</p>
<p>tried her best</p>
<p>but once again</p>
<p>everyone saw</p>
<p>right through her</p>
<p>they did a retrial</p>
<p>and she was convicted</p>
<p>again on august 2 1904</p>
<p>and once again</p>
<p>cordelia was sentenced to life imprisonment the</p>
<p>second trial didn&rsquo;t get nearly the same</p>
<p>level of newspaper attention as the</p>
<p>first go round so not much</p>
<p>really said</p>
<p>about the read</p>
<p>trial and not much is out there</p>
<p>about the read</p>
<p>trial because</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>all the original</p>
<p>trial records were destroyed</p>
<p>in the san francisco</p>
<p>1906 earthquake and fire</p>
<p>iconic earthquake</p>
<p>earthquake that destroyed san francisco</p>
<p>this earthquake also destroyed the jail that</p>
<p>cordelia was living in so she was</p>
<p>transferred</p>
<p>to san quentin</p>
<p>state prison</p>
<p>now that prison</p>
<p>is no joke okay that&rsquo;s like i say real prison</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where all of the</p>
<p>death row inmates go</p>
<p>and hang out together</p>
<p>so it must have been no picnic in the park</p>
<p>because in 1908 she</p>
<p>applied for parole on the basis of bad health</p>
<p>but her request was denied she remained at san quentin</p>
<p>until her death on</p>
<p>march 7 1910</p>
<p>at the age of 56</p>
<p>which was considered</p>
<p>still pretty</p>
<p>young back then</p>
<p>the official</p>
<p>cause of death was softening</p>
<p>of the brain due to melancholy</p>
<p>so essentially</p>
<p>she died of depression</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not hard to</p>
<p>understand why she</p>
<p>might have died from depression</p>
<p>the last few years of her life were very</p>
<p>rough for cordelia</p>
<p>aside from being at san quentin</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>she lost just</p>
<p>about everyone</p>
<p>she was close to her father died in 1900</p>
<p>after being kicked by a horse</p>
<p>her now ex husband welcome</p>
<p>he died on may 2nd</p>
<p>in 1904 from</p>
<p>heart failure</p>
<p>and then their son died the following year also from</p>
<p>heart failure</p>
<p>so for cordelia it was just</p>
<p>lost after loss</p>
<p>after loss after lost</p>
<p>and they believe that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what led her to die</p>
<p>remember john</p>
<p>john dunning the</p>
<p>lover poor john</p>
<p>he could not escape</p>
<p>this whole situation without</p>
<p>it just destroying his</p>
<p>life let me tell you it just destroyed his life because</p>
<p>this whole like relationship and affair with</p>
<p>cordelia came out during the</p>
<p>trial right and</p>
<p>other details about him</p>
<p>drinking gambling</p>
<p>whoring around with a</p>
<p>ton of different women</p>
<p>this is all like public information</p>
<p>during the trial</p>
<p>so aside from being associated with</p>
<p>cordelia and being</p>
<p>wrapped up in all that</p>
<p>drama john he became</p>
<p>an undesirable man is what he</p>
<p>was considered nobody wanted to be associated with him</p>
<p>nobody wanted to hire</p>
<p>him and so once</p>
<p>again his career</p>
<p>was destroyed poor guy</p>
<p>he really didn&rsquo;t deserve it</p>
<p>to be honest</p>
<p>he just got</p>
<p>wrapped up in some bullshit</p>
<p>okay and they destroyed his life</p>
<p>after that i mean luckily for him</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t suffer that long because john died</p>
<p>in philadelphia in 1908</p>
<p>so poor guy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i was trying to make it positive at</p>
<p>least he died so he&rsquo;s not humiliated</p>
<p>so cordelia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story is kind of a sad one</p>
<p>she you have to give her credit</p>
<p>for taking charge of her own life look talking</p>
<p>about sex and being</p>
<p>sexual is just</p>
<p>completely like hell</p>
<p>freaking know something you did not do back then right</p>
<p>the fact that</p>
<p>cordelia was</p>
<p>brave enough to be like hey you guys</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m ugly not me though</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m hot and</p>
<p>i got tits like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna show em</p>
<p>okay like she just did her</p>
<p>thing and that i can respect for sure</p>
<p>good for her</p>
<p>unfortunately she</p>
<p>would go on to make some terrible decisions</p>
<p>bad choices</p>
<p>she snapped from</p>
<p>heartbreak but again</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna give her a little bit of credit here</p>
<p>cause she did get creative</p>
<p>and she poisoned some chocolates</p>
<p>again not really</p>
<p>heard of not a thing</p>
<p>death by mail murder by mail</p>
<p>not a thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a shame that</p>
<p>she put all of this energy towards being a bad person</p>
<p>instead of just being a good person because</p>
<p>she had some ideas</p>
<p>in the end though</p>
<p>cordelia was just a very insecure woman who</p>
<p>wanted john</p>
<p>all to herself and murdered a</p>
<p>woman who lives 6 000</p>
<p>miles away so she</p>
<p>could have john</p>
<p>at the end of the day she&rsquo;s a pretty fucked up lady</p>
<p>and that my friends</p>
<p>is a story of</p>
<p>cordelia botkin</p>
<p>very interesting</p>
<p>woman murder by mail</p>
<p>so what did we</p>
<p>learn here today</p>
<p>i think what we</p>
<p>learned here</p>
<p>today is that nobody is worth</p>
<p>murdering over</p>
<p>okay i don&rsquo;t know what else to tell you</p>
<p>nobody is worth it and i hope that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>learned today oh also another</p>
<p>thing we can take away here is like if you ever</p>
<p>fighting over a man</p>
<p>with somebody just let fucking let it go like it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>worth it let someone else have them</p>
<p>your day will come anywho</p>
<p>i hope you have</p>
<p>a wonderful rest of your day you make good choices</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later hi</p>
