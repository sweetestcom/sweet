    <p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Don&rsquo;t let your winners ride ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Rain man David Sackler ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ And I said we open sourced it to the fans ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ And they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ Love you guys, I&rsquo;m the queen of Kinwan ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in ‚ô™</p>
<p>Antonio, Elon had a moment of reflection</p>
<p>and he was talking about 2008,</p>
<p>he was talking about the imminent collapse</p>
<p>as he felt it of SpaceX and Tesla at the same time</p>
<p>in December 25th, and he said,</p>
<p>there were just a handful of people who came out there</p>
<p>and put their careers on the line for him.</p>
<p>Yourself and Steve Jervison specifically mentioned.</p>
<p>And Ira, and it was a particularly poignant moment for him.</p>
<p>He was getting a little choked up about it.</p>
<p>Tell us about that bet you made in 2008</p>
<p>and the potentially career ending bet for you</p>
<p>to bet in an electric car company at that moment.</p>
<p>Take us back to that decision.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, before I do that,</p>
<p>I just want to say that I left my wallet backstage</p>
<p>because the last time I was with the four of you,</p>
<p>I lost a lot of money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I realized that I better leave all the cash</p>
<p>somewhere where you can&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>And then, and you also made me cry.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, I think I might cry again now.</p>
<p>Of joy?</p>
<p>I mean, no, no.</p>
<p>It was more like humiliation, but.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re playing poker.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re playing poker.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>You pulled a Palmer Lucky?</p>
<p>Yeah, we played poker.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So if I cry again this time,</p>
<p>it will be from a sense of just gratitude</p>
<p>for those moments that we got to share.</p>
<p>So for us in particular,</p>
<p>because our strategy is so operational,</p>
<p>I was there working on supply chain in the factory</p>
<p>and on sales in that period,</p>
<p>along with my partner, Tim Watkins,</p>
<p>and three or four of our supply chain people.</p>
<p>And we had a major problem in the supply chain.</p>
<p>The costs were way out of control.</p>
<p>And, you know, Elon was doing the engineering</p>
<p>on the very expensive parts.</p>
<p>We were doing the, I call it the B parts,</p>
<p>the A and B parts.</p>
<p>And man, it was brutal.</p>
<p>But it was very clear to us that,</p>
<p>and remember, it was also</p>
<p>the middle of financial crisis, right?</p>
<p>So we had to triage our portfolio.</p>
<p>We had to decide.</p>
<p>We did have a lot of capital at the time.</p>
<p>These are tiny funds, $120, $300,000 funds.</p>
<p>Where our capital would go, where our people would go.</p>
<p>More importantly, where our operating people would go.</p>
<p>And where I would go.</p>
<p>And we decided to focus on Tesla</p>
<p>because first, we really did believe in Elon</p>
<p>when most people didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And we saw in him something very special,</p>
<p>which I think you probably saw here yesterday,</p>
<p>that not only is he a brilliant, brilliant engineer,</p>
<p>you know, one in a hundred year kind of engineer,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a man of deep conviction and deep passion</p>
<p>and deep compassion.</p>
<p>What he is doing is really trying</p>
<p>to bend the arc of humanity for all of us</p>
<p>because he really cares.</p>
<p>And that came through to us</p>
<p>and we wanted to be on that mission with him.</p>
<p>And so we were privileged enough</p>
<p>to be there in a moment in time that it mattered.</p>
<p>And it was really hard, man.</p>
<p>I mean, we had clients.</p>
<p>I actually had a client said to me,</p>
<p>how do I know this isn&rsquo;t DeLorean?</p>
<p>And I said, look, I can tell you for a fact,</p>
<p>we are not selling cocaine</p>
<p>out of the back of the factory in the cars.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no-</p>
<p>DeLorean being the famous back to the future car</p>
<p>where the owner was trafficking cocaine</p>
<p>to underwrite the car.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I may live in Miami,</p>
<p>be named Antonio Grossi,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not selling cocaine for sure.</p>
<p>That I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, but no, it was a career-bending event for us</p>
<p>and it turned out right.</p>
<p>It was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>But yeah, for me, it was,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just deeply grateful for these experiences.</p>
<p>But I mean, you really doubled down</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t just do Tesla.</p>
<p>You also were there in some really critical moments</p>
<p>at SpaceX as well.</p>
<p>We were, although I tell you,</p>
<p>you know, we doubled down at the time in Tesla.</p>
<p>We put more money in Tesla</p>
<p>in the middle of the financial crisis</p>
<p>and then helped lead a convert around there</p>
<p>that was really tough for us to do</p>
<p>and then put more money in SpaceX.</p>
<p>But I tell you, operationally,</p>
<p>like in terms of capital stack,</p>
<p>I think there were other people around</p>
<p>and SpaceX was also running out of money.</p>
<p>And so we put money into SpaceX.</p>
<p>Operationally, we worked at SpaceX over the years,</p>
<p>but it was never as existential</p>
<p>in terms of the operations as it was at Tesla.</p>
<p>I mean, Tesla was truly, I think, truly existential.</p>
<p>And because we were operating guys</p>
<p>and I myself had been a factory manager,</p>
<p>I worked in auto parts, an auto parts factory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d run industrial facilities myself.</p>
<p>We could kind of uniquely add value there.</p>
<p>In the rocket factory, you know, we were just less valuable.</p>
<p>But yeah, both these companies</p>
<p>were going down at the same time.</p>
<p>And you know, the amount of stress</p>
<p>we were all under was extraordinary.</p>
<p>But you know, looking back on it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the greatest moments of my career.</p>
<p>I mean, this sense of fellowship,</p>
<p>you know, one of the,</p>
<p>I think the great thing about being in our business,</p>
<p>the business we are all in,</p>
<p>is that we get to back amazing people</p>
<p>that are trying to change the world.</p>
<p>And in these dark, dark, dark, deep moments,</p>
<p>we get to go to war for them.</p>
<p>And in those moments,</p>
<p>I call them these moments of fellowship</p>
<p>where you just care deeply about someone</p>
<p>and passionate about the mission,</p>
<p>and you get to make a huge difference.</p>
<p>Like, these are the highlights of my career.</p>
<p>And if you ask my partners,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d tell you the same thing.</p>
<p>These are the best moments.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had some together.</p>
<p>Three of us have had some together.</p>
<p>Actually, we&rsquo;ve all had some together here on the stage.</p>
<p>We had to fight for something we believed in.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a privilege, man, to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a privilege to be in that situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a privilege to be with Elon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a privilege to be there with all of you</p>
<p>at different moments in my career.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very grateful for it.</p>
<p>How, do you feel like you come off of a high</p>
<p>after having huge successes like that?</p>
<p>Like, how do you stay grounded and motivated</p>
<p>to try to find the next one?</p>
<p>If in the back of your mind,</p>
<p>there must be a little piece that says,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never gonna be as good as this guy</p>
<p>or those two things.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s an interesting question, Javon.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s a couple things at play for us.</p>
<p>One is we keep going</p>
<p>because we believe in making the world better.</p>
<p>We invest in companies that we believe make a difference</p>
<p>with people we respect and we&rsquo;re values aligned with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ethos of our firm, right?</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s large or small,</p>
<p>we may never find something that&rsquo;s as important</p>
<p>as Tesla and SpaceX again,</p>
<p>but we will find more great people and we will help them.</p>
<p>Two of our companies here,</p>
<p>I mean, we invested in Anduril with Palmer.</p>
<p>We have a small investment in Flexport,</p>
<p>which should have been one of the biggest mistakes</p>
<p>the last 10 years of my career</p>
<p>is not putting more money in Flexport.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>We actually, it&rsquo;s kind of a funny story about,</p>
<p>we had, you know, I&rsquo;d say kind of a soft handshake</p>
<p>on a term sheet at, say, a price of X</p>
<p>and SoftBank came in like two days later</p>
<p>and made it two X and I had too much price memory</p>
<p>to keep going and co-lead it.</p>
<p>So it was an error.</p>
<p>But you have two people on the stage here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re extraordinary entrepreneurs</p>
<p>that are trying to make the world better.</p>
<p>Both these companies are really great</p>
<p>and making the world much more,</p>
<p>particularly now post COVID and in times of war,</p>
<p>making it much safer for all of us.</p>
<p>There are people like that out there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more of them.</p>
<p>They may not be Elon.</p>
<p>You know, it was probably one Elon in our generation,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s lots of great people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very optimistic about what&rsquo;s happening now</p>
<p>in the economy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing incredible, incredible innovation</p>
<p>with tremendous entrepreneurs in our pipeline.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s another one, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Antonio, how do you think about the,</p>
<p>in the businesses you guys invest in,</p>
<p>there can sometimes be a very long capital deployment cycle</p>
<p>before you see any real return in terms of business value,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s pharma, I know you&rsquo;ve done pharma,</p>
<p>some of these hardware companies</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a big build cycle.</p>
<p>How much do you need to kind of think about</p>
<p>and see a customer and revenue show up</p>
<p>before you&rsquo;re willing to say,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s build the big rocket ship</p>
<p>to go to the frigging moon?</p>
<p>And how do you judge and value that business</p>
<p>and back a team?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>I think it depends on the sector we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it depends on how we,</p>
<p>we look at the world probabilistically</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re looking for companies that we call pro-entrepreneur</p>
<p>where they get bad and the world gets worse.</p>
<p>So in the case of pharma or something like SpaceX,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll think about like, what is our probability tree here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your probability of loss?</p>
<p>Probability of 3X, a 5X, a 10X, a 100X.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll think about when the capital goes in,</p>
<p>what is the actual return on capital?</p>
<p>And I was watching the talk you guys had with Ryan</p>
<p>about what happens to the public markets.</p>
<p>The reality is that a business is a machine.</p>
<p>You put capital on one side</p>
<p>and out the other side comes return.</p>
<p>The ROI, see the return invested capital really matters.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a classically trained investor the way I am,</p>
<p>we think about that a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So even though we may be putting a lot of capital in,</p>
<p>the question is, what&rsquo;s the margin</p>
<p>going to be in the back end?</p>
<p>A company like SpaceX, a lot of capital is going in,</p>
<p>but we know that if it works and we believe it will work,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll ultimately have a company that has tremendous margins</p>
<p>even in the industrial sector</p>
<p>because of the industry structure it&rsquo;s in.</p>
<p>It lives in an oligopoly inside the U.S. and outside the U.S.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like in building Starlink, same thing,</p>
<p>capital going in, but we know that the margins</p>
<p>and the profitability of that business on the back end</p>
<p>will be very, very high.</p>
<p>And so the ROIC will be very good.</p>
<p>Just the one.</p>
<p>Are you backing a lot of deep tech startups?</p>
<p>Like companies, a founder shows up with a PowerPoint</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, I need 50 million bucks</p>
<p>to make our prototype.</p>
<p>I mean, what happens there?</p>
<p>It depends on the business.</p>
<p>So as an example, we have passed on things</p>
<p>that are, our view, going to have margins</p>
<p>that are ultimately competed to a low level.</p>
<p>And there are, I don&rsquo;t want to give examples here,</p>
<p>but there are lots of examples of people</p>
<p>that are doing things in,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll call it electric aircraft, VTOLs, et cetera.</p>
<p>We look at this and say,</p>
<p>this is going to be a highly competitive market.</p>
<p>These are not an N of one.</p>
<p>SpaceX is an N of one.</p>
<p>If you compare that to someone making an electric vehicle,</p>
<p>say electric airplane or electric VTOL,</p>
<p>that will not be an N of one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be an N of many.</p>
<p>And an N of many business,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ultimately going to have margin competition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to make it,</p>
<p>the return on capital goes down</p>
<p>to basic industrial margins.</p>
<p>You know, like it won&rsquo;t be that much better</p>
<p>than Boeing&rsquo;s ROIC or Airbus&rsquo;s ROIC</p>
<p>because those will be ultimate competitors.</p>
<p>You said it a little too, I think superficially.</p>
<p>So let me just double click.</p>
<p>And I think Antonio brings up,</p>
<p>I think one of the most important principles of investing</p>
<p>that is so utterly poorly understood,</p>
<p>which is ROIC, ROIC, return on invested capital.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t even know what it means,</p>
<p>how to calculate it.</p>
<p>No pat over your weighted average cost of capital.</p>
<p>These are enormously fundamental principles</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re running a business,</p>
<p>especially in a moment like this,</p>
<p>because when the rubber meets the road</p>
<p>and you need a lot of money</p>
<p>and you run into somebody as sophisticated as him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s already worked from first principles to understand it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really, really important to know these things</p>
<p>because these are the core foundations of valuation.</p>
<p>So obviously DCFs are one framework,</p>
<p>but ROIC is incredibly, incredibly important,</p>
<p>especially when you make real things</p>
<p>and you need to spend capex.</p>
<p>And look at a world in the last 10 years where money&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>Nobody thinks about this very much.</p>
<p>We always have thought about it,</p>
<p>which informs our investment model.</p>
<p>But yeah, Jamal&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, in today&rsquo;s world, if you&rsquo;re an entrepreneur</p>
<p>and you can show up and say,</p>
<p>listen, I have a 50, 60, 70% return on capital.</p>
<p>Every dollar you give me will yield a 70, 80% return</p>
<p>on the back end.</p>
<p>Even though we&rsquo;re losing money along the way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very compelling case to,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re losing a bunch of money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not really sure what&rsquo;s going to happen,</p>
<p>which is what we hear a lot.</p>
<p>This also builds on the question from yesterday,</p>
<p>which is how do you present yourself</p>
<p>as a young emerging company and cut through all the noise</p>
<p>and understanding of these things</p>
<p>and about future value creation in a moment like this</p>
<p>becomes really important as well.</p>
<p>Even if people will debate whether it&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>people will give you credit for the intellectual honesty</p>
<p>of actually going there and understanding these things.</p>
<p>You see it a lot where companies slip away</p>
<p>from first principles.</p>
<p>So, the first principle is on a high margin</p>
<p>enterprise software business.</p>
<p>You can define ARR and assume some,</p>
<p>and then people say, hey, some multiple of ARR</p>
<p>is your valuation comp, like your multiple.</p>
<p>And then another company shows up</p>
<p>and the margins are different.</p>
<p>The growth profile is different.</p>
<p>The revenue retention is different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a services business.</p>
<p>And they try and use a similar sort of comp.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, everyone&rsquo;s thinking about valuation</p>
<p>as a function of some industry standard comp</p>
<p>as opposed to going back to understanding</p>
<p>how did that comp get created in the first place?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the nature of the business</p>
<p>from which that comp arose?</p>
<p>And people are doing things like calling revenue ARR.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even subscription revenue and so on.</p>
<p>And I think that happens considerably more.</p>
<p>And then that investing cycle just becomes,</p>
<p>hey, well, the next round will be this multiple</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll get our increment in valuation.</p>
<p>And everyone just misses the core proposition</p>
<p>of building a valuable business that can generate growth.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your look through into the economy</p>
<p>just from your portfolio of companies?</p>
<p>Look, we think, I think we&rsquo;re in a recession.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if someone&rsquo;s already said this,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re in a recession.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a recession.</p>
<p>And this will be like my, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>100th cycle or something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty old.</p>
<p>But like the rest of us here,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen it over and over again.</p>
<p>And I see David&rsquo;s tweets about go raise</p>
<p>two and a half years of money.</p>
<p>This is correct.</p>
<p>I mean, you need enough capital to get through the problem.</p>
<p>But the good news about this recession,</p>
<p>and there is some good news here,</p>
<p>which is to me, if you look at the macro picture here,</p>
<p>it looks like, if you look at the amount of federal debt,</p>
<p>the state of the consumer,</p>
<p>and kind of what&rsquo;s happened to business formation,</p>
<p>it actually looks a little like post-World War II to me.</p>
<p>In that, in the World War II period,</p>
<p>we had the last massive mobilization</p>
<p>or demobilization of our economy occurred in World War II.</p>
<p>That happened again in COVID.</p>
<p>When we changed, in this case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a mini version of remobilization</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re restarting the economy.</p>
<p>We flooded the system with money</p>
<p>to kind of buffer the problem and restart the economy.</p>
<p>And now we have inflation,</p>
<p>but we also have lots of business formation.</p>
<p>And we have new ways of doing work,</p>
<p>which is what happened after World War II.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very optimistic because most of these recessions,</p>
<p>to really get inflation down,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have to reduce consumer demand</p>
<p>and or change oil prices.</p>
<p>So for sure, we should be pumping oil in this country.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s controversial, but that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to lower oil prices and get inflation down.</p>
<p>But the reality is underneath the numbers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of innovation happening.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happened kind of post-World War II.</p>
<p>So I would say we&rsquo;re in a bit of a mini retooling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a rough year or two.</p>
<p>Hang on, there&rsquo;ll be a rough year or two.</p>
<p>But the consumer&rsquo;s in pretty good shape.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not over-levered.</p>
<p>We should come out okay.</p>
<p>And the US economy is so resilient, man.</p>
<p>You know, we are all either one generation</p>
<p>from being immigrants or immigrants here,</p>
<p>I think most of us, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best place in the world to live.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the most innovative economy in the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super optimistic what&rsquo;s happening here</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much innovation,</p>
<p>so many smart people working so hard to make things better.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be great.</p>
<p>I think when we get to the next couple of years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be great.</p>
<p>Talk about this pumping more oil situation.</p>
<p>Obviously, Russia&rsquo;s involved in a,</p>
<p>and we talked about it earlier today,</p>
<p>had a debate about Ukraine.</p>
<p>And then you have maybe some folks in the Middle East</p>
<p>not pumping as much oil as we might like them to.</p>
<p>And then Europe decided, well, we don&rsquo;t wanna frack here.</p>
<p>We want you to do that over there.</p>
<p>And then we stopped here.</p>
<p>And none of us wanna see environmental damage</p>
<p>done to the planet,</p>
<p>but we also don&rsquo;t wanna see dictators take over the planet</p>
<p>or the economy come to a halt.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a reasonable proposal for America</p>
<p>and American sovereignty in terms of green and renewables</p>
<p>and maybe pumping some oil?</p>
<p>So look, we were the first institutional investors</p>
<p>at Tesla Motors.</p>
<p>So I think I have enough benefits to say this.</p>
<p>I believe in green technology, okay?</p>
<p>Absolutely, 100%.</p>
<p>But energy, and in the same fund we did Tesla,</p>
<p>we actually had fracking assets</p>
<p>because energy independence is a-</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s incredible, really.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because then as it is today,</p>
<p>energy independence is a national security issue.</p>
<p>This is not a partisan issue.</p>
<p>Extremely important to understand this.</p>
<p>Extremely important to understand this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about Democrats or Republicans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about wars in the Middle East.</p>
<p>And the reality is that the Saudis are not pumping.</p>
<p>OPEC is not pumping.</p>
<p>This is terrible for America and they know it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re squeezing the American economy</p>
<p>the way they did in the 70s.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s absolutely being done on purpose.</p>
<p>So the answer to that, in my mind, is twofold.</p>
<p>One, we should have an,</p>
<p>we should be an industrial policy general in this country,</p>
<p>but the first thing we should have is an energy policy.</p>
<p>Energy policy should look like this.</p>
<p>We take all of the background subsidies,</p>
<p>literally make them equal,</p>
<p>and we give, let&rsquo;s say, 500 billion total,</p>
<p>250 billion in low-cost loans to the energy patch</p>
<p>for drilling in places like Texas, Louisiana,</p>
<p>and an equal amount to green energy.</p>
<p>And we sprint to a green future.</p>
<p>At the same time, we ensure that this country is safe</p>
<p>and we have energy security in this country</p>
<p>for all the people out there being hurt by inflation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a security problem.</p>
<p>And, um&hellip;</p>
<p>You guys invest heavily in manufacturing.</p>
<p>What do you see in terms of the future of manufacturing,</p>
<p>the opportunity for onshoring manufacturing?</p>
<p>Are there technologies that you guys are excited about</p>
<p>that create an advantage for the United States</p>
<p>to build manufacturing capacity to service industry here?</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I think this thing about,</p>
<p>we outsource our entire manufacturing base in China</p>
<p>because it was cheaper.</p>
<p>But the reality is that the productivity difference</p>
<p>between the U.S. and China right now is about eight to one.</p>
<p>So a U.S. worker is eight times more productive</p>
<p>than a Chinese worker.</p>
<p>We found, in cases like Tesla, where we actually helped&hellip;</p>
<p>In terms of GDP per worker?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We helped to insource the supply chain of Tesla.</p>
<p>Why is Tesla floating rated?</p>
<p>Because I got news for you,</p>
<p>you actually can make stuff in America,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s made very well.</p>
<p>Shocking?</p>
<p>Shocking, okay?</p>
<p>And let me tell you, when you put&hellip;</p>
<p>Why do we have this narrative that it can&rsquo;t be done,</p>
<p>and then we go to Gigafactory,</p>
<p>and you see it having been done?</p>
<p>Let me tell you why.</p>
<p>And boy, I mean, here&rsquo;s the&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably going to get pilloried for saying this,</p>
<p>but great companies are built by engineers like Elon Musk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality of it.</p>
<p>And they know they want to control their manufacturing.</p>
<p>We do it here so we can iterate faster</p>
<p>and make the product better.</p>
<p>If the product&rsquo;s good enough,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll sell it for a great margin.</p>
<p>They get optimized by marketing people</p>
<p>and destroyed by the CFO.</p>
<p>When you put the finance guy in charge,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, oh, hey,</p>
<p>we can get a lower piece part by sending it to China,</p>
<p>but he doesn&rsquo;t understand the iteration cycle</p>
<p>of making that product,</p>
<p>that guy destroys the company.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happened in America.</p>
<p>Bean counters.</p>
<p>Yeah, we put the CFOs in charge.</p>
<p>For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Fuck these bean counters.</p>
<p>I mean, can I say that?</p>
<p>Fuck them.</p>
<p>Let me say that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we need more engineers.</p>
<p>Let me say that.</p>
<p>If you calculate return on invested capital,</p>
<p>and you think about this carefully,</p>
<p>what happens is these long supply chains to Asia,</p>
<p>they have huge capital deployment.</p>
<p>If capital&rsquo;s cheap, you do that</p>
<p>because the piece part price is cheaper.</p>
<p>What happened at Tesla in particular,</p>
<p>when you calculate the overall cost,</p>
<p>and capital wasn&rsquo;t free because we didn&rsquo;t get any,</p>
<p>it was actually much smarter to bring it back.</p>
<p>Right, so the long-term cycle, you make more money.</p>
<p>The short-term cycle, you make less money.</p>
<p>The short-term cycle, you make more money.</p>
<p>I mean, is that another way to think about it?</p>
<p>You optimize.</p>
<p>For short-term outcomes.</p>
<p>You improve the income statement</p>
<p>because you might improve profitably in the short-term,</p>
<p>but you actually hurt the balance sheet</p>
<p>because you sent all this capital on the water</p>
<p>over to China, and you didn&rsquo;t bring it back,</p>
<p>and your iteration cycle goes down</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is the product&rsquo;s less innovative.</p>
<p>For sure, it is, it is,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s saying something really important,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s the financialization of the P&amp;L</p>
<p>that in some ways led to the decline</p>
<p>of American manufacturing in part,</p>
<p>meaning if you&rsquo;re a CEO of a business,</p>
<p>and you construct your employment agreement,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s based on a certain kind of earnings</p>
<p>in a certain period, a certain earnings per share,</p>
<p>the incentive to then drive financialization goes up.</p>
<p>Now, the perfect example of this is</p>
<p>if you compare it, for example,</p>
<p>and you did this,</p>
<p>the comp package that you gave Elon in 2018</p>
<p>versus the comp package that any other CEO in America got,</p>
<p>it was completely black and white.</p>
<p>It was opposite land,</p>
<p>and you basically completely said,</p>
<p>you get nothing now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s set these extreme goals,</p>
<p>and then if you can hit it, you&rsquo;ll get compensated.</p>
<p>So much so that when you had Glass-Lewis and ISS.</p>
<p>Glass-Lewis said no, right?</p>
<p>The ISS Glass-Lewis said no,</p>
<p>but they did most things,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re being sued for it,</p>
<p>so got to be careful what I say about it,</p>
<p>but yeah, we had a comp package</p>
<p>fully based on equity appreciation</p>
<p>that required creation of new products,</p>
<p>and look, I&rsquo;ll pick on Apple here.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s the first stock I ever bought.</p>
<p>I was 12 years old.</p>
<p>My mom actually went to Ocamp Bank</p>
<p>and bought me a few shares of Apple.</p>
<p>I still have it in my account</p>
<p>to remind me what it takes to build a company.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs dies, terrible,</p>
<p>and look, then Tim Cook takes over.</p>
<p>Tim Cook&rsquo;s a supply chain guy.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve really optimized profitability.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done a $2 trillion market cap or something now,</p>
<p>but man, when&rsquo;s the last time they made a new product?</p>
<p>Airpods.</p>
<p>Airpods.</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty great, but.</p>
<p>Great product.</p>
<p>Great product, but I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna change tomorrow.</p>
<p>Incredible free cash flow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they can aggressively buy back their stock.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a great, yeah.</p>
<p>And the financialization of that company has attracted,</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at the largest shareholder</p>
<p>is the most sophisticated financial asset owner</p>
<p>in the world, Berkshire.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Berkshire doesn&rsquo;t buy technology companies,</p>
<p>they buy incredibly well-run financial assets.</p>
<p>And it is.</p>
<p>By the way, look at how Zuck&rsquo;s getting lambasted</p>
<p>for the VR investment.</p>
<p>Some might say that strategically</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a great investment,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s saying, fuck it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna spend $10 billion a year.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>He said it for a quarter,</p>
<p>and then he had to take it back and cancel it.</p>
<p>Oh, he said that, they took it back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s what he wanted to do.</p>
<p>And so to your point,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s very hard to really build things now.</p>
<p>Yes, but it can be done.</p>
<p>And look, I think one of the,</p>
<p>I am, what is happening in the world today,</p>
<p>geopolitically, is tragic.</p>
<p>The war we are experiencing in Ukraine is absolutely tragic.</p>
<p>But from all tragedies come some good things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a silver lining.</p>
<p>And one of the silver linings here,</p>
<p>I think, should be the acceleration of reshoring</p>
<p>of all these products into America,</p>
<p>to rebuild our industrial base,</p>
<p>because we actually can do it.</p>
<p>I can tell you, I started my career</p>
<p>basically as a factory manager in California.</p>
<p>It can be done.</p>
<p>There are Americans who want to make stuff</p>
<p>between here, Mexico, Canada.</p>
<p>We can make pharma.</p>
<p>We can make high-tech products.</p>
<p>Yes, the price might be a little higher,</p>
<p>but I got to tell you, the iteration will be better,</p>
<p>and your value will be better.</p>
<p>If the product is better, people will pay for it.</p>
<p>And resiliency.</p>
<p>And resiliency.</p>
<p>Listen, for 100%, 100%.</p>
<p>All right, we are setting up a couple of microphones here.</p>
<p>Antonio has been gracious enough to join us for some Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>The audience is filled with entrepreneurs,</p>
<p>capital allocators, artists, and builders.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to put a couple of microphones out there.</p>
<p>Hopefully some lights on the microphones,</p>
<p>if I can see them.</p>
<p>Line up, and remember the rule.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to know about your company.</p>
<p>Just a tight, concise question.</p>
<p>Anybody does any marketing or promotion,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all going to groan.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s practice a groan.</p>
<p>Three, two, one.</p>
<p>Groan.</p>
<p>No groan.</p>
<p>You can say your name.</p>
<p>You can say your favorite bestie.</p>
<p>Also, wait, before we start.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If Chris, is Chris Malloy here?</p>
<p>Okay, everybody, you guys may want to just know Chris.</p>
<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re in Vegas,</p>
<p>Chris is the guy at Carbone in Las Vegas,</p>
<p>which is the most, you know,</p>
<p>best restaurant, hardest restaurant reservation to get.</p>
<p>But Chris bought a bottle of wine for us</p>
<p>that we can open now and drink while we do the AMA, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, well bring up a bottle of wine.</p>
<p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s Chris Malloy.</p>
<p>Say hi to him.</p>
<p>Get his number and text him</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re ever in Las Vegas and want to go there.</p>
<p>I mean, only Chamath would bring</p>
<p>the captain of Carbone to our event.</p>
<p>Oh, could we drink?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s drink some wine.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>First question, tell us your favorite bestie, and then.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re still doing favorite besties, right?</p>
<p>Favorite bestie, and then a quick, tight question, go.</p>
<p>All right, favorite bestie,</p>
<p>J. Cal, point guard of the century to this team,</p>
<p>so hats off to you.</p>
<p>My question is, first of all,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been here all week, or in the last three days,</p>
<p>watching these cards fall from the sky.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we all know that you guys center around</p>
<p>this poker table, this beautiful game.</p>
<p>My question is, how has that game influenced</p>
<p>both your relationships and decision-making</p>
<p>in business and your personal lives?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Chamath, start us off, and you can go to the back,</p>
<p>and the next person, queue up.</p>
<p>How has poker influenced?</p>
<p>Friendship, our lives.</p>
<p>How has the poker game itself had an impact on our lives?</p>
<p>Okay, I think, I really do believe this,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s the most incredible game</p>
<p>and training ground for business,</p>
<p>because in any given moment,</p>
<p>you are forced to deal with the spectrum</p>
<p>of good information to moderate information</p>
<p>to bad information.</p>
<p>Good outcomes, moderate outcomes, bad outcomes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking risk, you&rsquo;re learning information,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re adjusting your style,</p>
<p>and the most important thing is you&rsquo;re forced</p>
<p>to anchor to your core values or not.</p>
<p>How you behave at the table is how you behave in life.</p>
<p>You know, you can take these wins poorly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a new Phil Hellmuth.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can take these wins poorly,</p>
<p>you can take these wins well,</p>
<p>you can take the losses poorly,</p>
<p>you can take the loss as well.</p>
<p>I would encourage all of you to learn</p>
<p>to play the game with your friends.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful, beautiful game.</p>
<p>And start a weekly game.</p>
<p>Sax?</p>
<p>Well, the poker game at Chamath&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>is how I got to be friends with Chamath, right?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, this is what you guys tell your wives</p>
<p>while you stay up all night playing poker?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve been there with you guys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty freaking degenerate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Pretty degenerate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all holding hands.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Talking about our feelings.</p>
<p>Baby, it&rsquo;s training, it&rsquo;s training for business.</p>
<p>No, it is training for business, I&rsquo;m kidding you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>It is training for business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>It is training for business.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not degenerates, but go ahead, Sax.</p>
<p>Well, I was just saying, Chamath,</p>
<p>I mean, didn&rsquo;t you invest in Yammer</p>
<p>after I started playing in your weekly poker game?</p>
<p>Yeah, and it was actually so degenerate.</p>
<p>What really happened after that was</p>
<p>I was in Las Vegas in 2011.</p>
<p>I had just left Facebook.</p>
<p>I moved to Vegas.</p>
<p>And I was on the phone with Sax</p>
<p>in between playing tournaments.</p>
<p>And he let me in, invest in Yammer.</p>
<p>And you know, you did me an incredible solid</p>
<p>because I put money in.</p>
<p>And you know what this is like.</p>
<p>Nine months later, he sells to Microsoft.</p>
<p>And I returned a third of my first fund.</p>
<p>Ooh, yum yum.</p>
<p>And it really solidified my reputation.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I owe you a big one for that.</p>
<p>Well, I got to tell you about this, though.</p>
<p>So, David Sax, I&rsquo;ve known David for 25 years.</p>
<p>He did Yammer.</p>
<p>I wanted to put money in it.</p>
<p>He said no, because it&hellip;</p>
<p>This is a true story.</p>
<p>This is a true story.</p>
<p>He said no.</p>
<p>He said, he said, no, because if this fails,</p>
<p>you are my backup plan.</p>
<p>Oh, for a job?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, he didn&rsquo;t offer me a job.</p>
<p>I wanted David to come join me.</p>
<p>I was so afraid of losing everyone&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>when I founded a company, you know.</p>
<p>He literally took a little check from me.</p>
<p>I wanted to have like one friend whose money I didn&rsquo;t lose.</p>
<p>But, you know, that was the wrong way of thinking about it.</p>
<p>We should have&hellip;</p>
<p>Freeberg?</p>
<p>I mean, how is the game?</p>
<p>Well, before, Chamath, are you leaving?</p>
<p>Before, Chamath, are you leaving?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m getting glasses.</p>
<p>No, no, come back for a sec.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll get glasses.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s getting wine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you guys one thing.</p>
<p>Chamath is one of the most generous people you&rsquo;ll ever meet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>He is unbelievable.</p>
<p>And for all of his bluster</p>
<p>about his friggin&rsquo; mink coats and shit, like&hellip;</p>
<p>Chinchilla.</p>
<p>Chinchilla.</p>
<p>He has brought together a group,</p>
<p>and he largely is the reason</p>
<p>that I think the game grows and goes on.</p>
<p>And you saw some of the amazing people</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve had on stage here,</p>
<p>and some of our friends are here</p>
<p>that we play in our game with,</p>
<p>that really, that network has been built and solidified</p>
<p>because of Chamath and his generosity and friendship.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s really something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to appreciate in my life, and, you know.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a tremendous group, and yeah.</p>
<p>Amazing people, like&hellip;</p>
<p>Amazing people, and&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The consistency of it has been amazing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a degenerate group.</p>
<p>Chamath had this, like, little tiny $2 million house</p>
<p>with, like, a one-and-a-half car garage</p>
<p>when he was at Facebook,</p>
<p>and we would play in the garage.</p>
<p>That little tiny place you had, remember?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, before you bought the two houses next door</p>
<p>and knocked them down, and&hellip;</p>
<p>Gentrified.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>But, true story.</p>
<p>Sax said, hey, you know, you&rsquo;re doing these conferences.</p>
<p>You should invest in the companies.</p>
<p>And this is when I put the fix in</p>
<p>for him to win TechCrunch 50 at Yammer.</p>
<p>With Yammer.</p>
<p>He said, I have to win.</p>
<p>And then he, his wife told my wife, he has to win.</p>
<p>And so then I basically got the whole jury to vote for him.</p>
<p>With Yammer, he wins.</p>
<p>And he goes, hey, Chamath.</p>
<p>All my success is due to J-Cal.</p>
<p>You guys understand that, right?</p>
<p>It was a good fix.</p>
<p>I put the fix in for him.</p>
<p>But he said, listen, I want to thank you for this,</p>
<p>and you should start a fund.</p>
<p>Instead of doing all this work at the conference,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you just invest in the companies?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put 250K into your fund.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be the anchor.</p>
<p>I said, that&rsquo;s incredible, really?</p>
<p>And he said, yeah.</p>
<p>And then I went to the poker table.</p>
<p>I told the story, and then Dave Goldberg,</p>
<p>rest in peace, one of our great friends,</p>
<p>and certainly the best amongst us, thank you.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;ll put money into it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And he put money in.</p>
<p>And then Billy said, I&rsquo;ll put money in.</p>
<p>And everybody said they&rsquo;d put money in.</p>
<p>Freedberg said, I&rsquo;ll take a pass.</p>
<p>Which was it?</p>
<p>But, you know, we&rsquo;ll put that aside.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>I was all locked up in other stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s like, I got a quinoa farm I&rsquo;ve got to take care of.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Cheers, cheers, cheers.</p>
<p>Cheers, cheers.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, all right.</p>
<p>Let me cheer too.</p>
<p>J-Cal.</p>
<p>Fellowship.</p>
<p>And this is a true story.</p>
<p>Bill Lee&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t make it here,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s one of our great friends</p>
<p>and one of Elon&rsquo;s best friends in the world.</p>
<p>And he said, of course I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>Would you mind if I tell our billionaire friend,</p>
<p>the co-founder of eBay, Jeff Skoll.</p>
<p>And he tells him, J-Cal&rsquo;s doing a fund.</p>
<p>You should do it.</p>
<p>I meet Jeff Skoll&rsquo;s money manager.</p>
<p>Yon, and I said, hey, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a first time fund manager.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the fuck I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a former journalist.</p>
<p>And he said, how much is the fund?</p>
<p>I said, 10 million.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;ll take half.</p>
<p>And I said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>And he said, I&rsquo;ll take five million.</p>
<p>And that was the biggest check I ever got.</p>
<p>And it was because of Bill Lee.</p>
<p>And literally that first fund</p>
<p>was raised around the poker table in one night.</p>
<p>And that changed the trajectory of my career.</p>
<p>And that really is the fellowship.</p>
<p>And it started with David and you hosting.</p>
<p>And I remember it was like yesterday.</p>
<p>And I think maybe also a good moment</p>
<p>to just maybe cheers to Goldie.</p>
<p>Dave Goldberg.</p>
<p>No longer with us.</p>
<p>And Tony Hsieh, who played in the game as well.</p>
<p>Two incredible men.</p>
<p>Next question.</p>
<p>Hey, my name&rsquo;s Bobbin.</p>
<p>Favorite bestie is Chamath.</p>
<p>Great to meet you last night.</p>
<p>Thank you, Bobbin.</p>
<p>By the way, Antonio is also our people, too.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a bestie.</p>
<p>All right, listen, we know Chamath&rsquo;s your bestie.</p>
<p>Quick, with the question, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Yeah, my main question is when you guys</p>
<p>actually decided to manage capital for people,</p>
<p>like what really was the scariest step</p>
<p>in taking that leap and taking that risk?</p>
<p>I know a lot of you are GPs, solo GPs, so.</p>
<p>I mean, Zach, you made a big leap.</p>
<p>Was the scariest step?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, even as a founder, like I mentioned before,</p>
<p>I was like so worried about losing people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>I mean, that was like, I mean,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if like founders today even care that much,</p>
<p>that this seems, but.</p>
<p>It just seems like, oh, company didn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>move on to the next one.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe that&rsquo;ll change now</p>
<p>that the environment&rsquo;s not gonna be as free-flowing,</p>
<p>but I was always like really worried</p>
<p>I was gonna lose people&rsquo;s money,</p>
<p>and it was something that sort of kept me up at night.</p>
<p>I remember when I started Social Capital,</p>
<p>I think I was playing, I was either playing golf</p>
<p>or I had dinner with Chase Coleman in New York,</p>
<p>and Chase says to me, I&rsquo;ll tell you the one piece of advice</p>
<p>Julian gave me when I started Tiger Globe,</p>
<p>I said, what was that?</p>
<p>This is a 2009, and he said, this is a death sentence.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, what does that mean?</p>
<p>And he said, you are the only person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna live with this because you&rsquo;re responsible,</p>
<p>especially based on who your LPs are,</p>
<p>for folks that if you really think about who they are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just gonna create this thing there,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, you know, and I was lucky in that moment</p>
<p>because we were able to get like the Knight Foundation</p>
<p>and Mayo Clinic and these folks</p>
<p>that are doing these good works,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re representing their capital.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heavy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heavy because you make this decision,</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s wrong, you just feel literally</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re derelict and you&rsquo;re taking money away</p>
<p>from sick children or, you know, free speech.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a, that&rsquo;s a brutally stressful thing</p>
<p>to lose money on behalf of people.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;ll recommend as a founder,</p>
<p>if you raise money, raise money from your friends, too,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll really change how you operate.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I raised the first fund from my friends,</p>
<p>and I tell you, I took every single deal very seriously,</p>
<p>and I did my diligence, and I was very thoughtful about it.</p>
<p>How about you, Antonio?</p>
<p>Oh, man, our first fund, there are two fears I had.</p>
<p>The first one was raised from, I live in Chicago,</p>
<p>from my friends in Chicago, and I literally said</p>
<p>to one of my partners at the time,</p>
<p>if this doesn&rsquo;t work, I have to move.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to move to Chicago,</p>
<p>because in Chicago, you might get killed</p>
<p>if you find something bad.</p>
<p>This is not like.</p>
<p>I thought you were reading the weather.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I mean, these guys lose your money.</p>
<p>He was talking witness protection.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>These guys lose your money.</p>
<p>People are kind of like, oh, I&rsquo;m sad about it.</p>
<p>Chicago would like break your legs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d burn your house down, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole different thing.</p>
<p>I have another question.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>No, keep going.</p>
<p>No, the second thing, I mean, honestly,</p>
<p>the worst thing for me, the most scary thing for me</p>
<p>was just the people.</p>
<p>I had three or four guys that had worked</p>
<p>with building companies before that,</p>
<p>and I just felt, if I had disappointed them,</p>
<p>if we failed, I would have felt terrible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It certainly makes you focus on the game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like being staked in poker.</p>
<p>You play better.</p>
<p>Sir?</p>
<p>I have a question for the 17th most important person</p>
<p>from PayPal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding, I&rsquo;m just kidding, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Obviously, Friedberg is my favorite bestie.</p>
<p>All right, science boy, let&rsquo;s go out with it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go nerd.</p>
<p>Unbelievable, the Friedberg love.</p>
<p>All right, Friedberg, soak it in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been talking about how all this</p>
<p>increased money supply has been sending</p>
<p>the asset prices up, and now it&rsquo;s unwinding.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve heard you talked about crypto</p>
<p>specifically, Bitcoin has obviously come down,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still over three times where it was pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>Curious what you think will happen in that world</p>
<p>as this unwinds.</p>
<p>You want me to address that?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It was for you, 17th most important guy from PayPal.</p>
<p>So the thing about the crypto market to understand</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s like a liquidity sponge.</p>
<p>The more liquidity there is out there,</p>
<p>the more people feel empowered to make</p>
<p>speculative investments, and crypto is like</p>
<p>the most speculative.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>I actually do believe in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;ll be a number of other</p>
<p>sort of alt-currencies that work,</p>
<p>but probably the vast majority will not,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s been a tremendous amount</p>
<p>of speculation and inflation there,</p>
<p>and so that space is in the process of correcting.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve never been able to say</p>
<p>what the right price levels for any of this stuff are.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you believe in Bitcoin long-term.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you believe it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>the first non-fiat currency.</p>
<p>What price should that be today?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no discounted cash flow analysis</p>
<p>you can apply to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been very hard to know</p>
<p>what the prices of these things should be,</p>
<p>and so in practice, the price is a function</p>
<p>of how much liquidity is in the system,</p>
<p>and when you go through a period of liquidity</p>
<p>getting destroyed, it&rsquo;s no surprise</p>
<p>that crypto goes wrong with it.</p>
<p>Antonio, have you touched, I mean,</p>
<p>you were so into physical assets</p>
<p>and building real things like spaceships</p>
<p>and rocket ships.</p>
<p>When you watch this crypto bubble</p>
<p>grow and burst and grow and burst,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s burst again,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your take?</p>
<p>Well, first I want to tell you,</p>
<p>I bought my first crypto, I mean, I think in 2017,</p>
<p>because David Sachs and Bill Lee</p>
<p>were pushing the Ponzi scheme on me.</p>
<p>So they were like, they were,</p>
<p>I was at a birthday party.</p>
<p>I think you were there too, Jim Callum.</p>
<p>They were like, they were hawking Bitcoin,</p>
<p>so I bought some.</p>
<p>Nobody had heard of it at that point.</p>
<p>I know, I bought some.</p>
<p>I think it was like 800 bucks of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my general view.</p>
<p>I actually think, I think that Bitcoin in particular</p>
<p>is a bet on rising political risk</p>
<p>and on political freedom.</p>
<p>Economic freedom is closely linked to political freedom.</p>
<p>And last time I looked,</p>
<p>Ukrainians are the third largest holders of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And if I were staying in Taiwan today,</p>
<p>I would have 10, 15% assets of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So this removes the ability to control currency,</p>
<p>capital controls from governments.</p>
<p>I think this is very important and it should survive.</p>
<p>Price levels, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I do have a, you know, a reasonable amount of Bitcoins</p>
<p>as a hedge to political risk globally.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we think about it.</p>
<p>We have invested in infrastructure assets</p>
<p>around a blockchain.</p>
<p>With Dave, we have a couple of assets</p>
<p>because we believe that blockchain itself</p>
<p>is a platform shift in the technology of tracking assets.</p>
<p>This was a real thing and it&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna change the way we do finance.</p>
<p>So we invest in infrastructure.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take another question.</p>
<p>Tied is right.</p>
<p>Is there a mic over there?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna take one from here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll alternate.</p>
<p>So Tied is right.</p>
<p>Yeah, hi.</p>
<p>Karmantra, CEO of Credo.</p>
<p>I have to tell you, I&rsquo;m a science nerd, Friedberg.</p>
<p>But J-Cal, it&rsquo;s been awesome today.</p>
<p>And I wanna say, you guys, like your courage and bravery</p>
<p>to do what you&rsquo;ve done with the pod</p>
<p>and watching this today, like, thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve talked a lot about later stage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if you could, like,</p>
<p>tune in a little bit more on pre-seed and seed</p>
<p>and kind of what you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>in terms of valuations and metrics</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve got to hit in the earlier stages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>I invested in Uber, Thumbtack, and Calm</p>
<p>for $15 million combined.</p>
<p>That was their combined valuation.</p>
<p>Post-money.</p>
<p>Post-money.</p>
<p>And all three companies had products in the market.</p>
<p>And then what we saw over the last five years</p>
<p>is people wanting credit for a white paper,</p>
<p>a prototype, an MVP to the tune of 15 to $50 million.</p>
<p>And we did sit out some of those and said,</p>
<p>listen, when the product is ready,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a look at the product</p>
<p>and talk to the first two or three customers.</p>
<p>To David&rsquo;s point, about zero to one customers</p>
<p>is the really hard hurdle.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s back down to six to 15 million</p>
<p>for a company that has a product in market</p>
<p>and maybe 50 to 100 times yearly revenue for a valuation.</p>
<p>So to the extent you can get to 200K in yearly revenue,</p>
<p>you can get a 10 to $20 million valuation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say halfway back to normal</p>
<p>and perhaps a permanent livable reset</p>
<p>because the outcomes have been pretty fantastic</p>
<p>so the early stage should go up.</p>
<p>The only thing you really need to raise money</p>
<p>is to build a world-class product</p>
<p>and just get a couple of customers</p>
<p>who are absolutely blown away by what you&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you need.</p>
<p>But everybody gets concerned with the theatrics</p>
<p>and the performative stuff and their network and nonsense</p>
<p>and who you are and where you came from,</p>
<p>none of it matters.</p>
<p>Build a world-class product</p>
<p>that two or three people are obsessed with</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get the C-check.</p>
<p>Focus.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think Brad.</p>
<p>Brad Gerstner had,</p>
<p>sorry to interrupt your applause, J. Cal.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s important to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take what little I can get.</p>
<p>So I think Brad Gerstner made a really important point</p>
<p>on this, which is the new normal</p>
<p>is going to look like the old normal,</p>
<p>meaning the pre-COVID normal.</p>
<p>We had the abnormal period was this two-year COVID period</p>
<p>where 10 trillion of liquidity is pumped into the system.</p>
<p>Things are going back to what they looked like</p>
<p>before all of that happened</p>
<p>and maybe before the Fed started</p>
<p>with this zero interest rate policy.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re actually getting back to normal.</p>
<p>Understand that the environment we&rsquo;re entering now</p>
<p>is the normality.</p>
<p>The abnormal period was the inflation we saw in assets</p>
<p>over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reset that everyone&rsquo;s going to have to</p>
<p>wrap their heads around.</p>
<p>Saks, you&rsquo;re my boy.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>One for Saks.</p>
<p>I think there may be some preference falsification</p>
<p>around this because people don&rsquo;t want to admit</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re conservative.</p>
<p>All the polling, all the polling shows this.</p>
<p>But anyway, thank you, sir.</p>
<p>And your second favorite bestie is Tucker Go.</p>
<p>For early stage SaaS investors, which most of you are,</p>
<p>in an increasingly digital world</p>
<p>where there are large SaaS solutions</p>
<p>for nearly everything,</p>
<p>how do you think about selecting companies and founders</p>
<p>in the early stage that are coming to market</p>
<p>with a small amount of utility</p>
<p>and how do you think about they compete with companies</p>
<p>with already established customer distribution?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think one of the things I really like about SaaS,</p>
<p>which is your software as a service,</p>
<p>basically B2B software, it&rsquo;s business software, okay,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sold as a subscription,</p>
<p>is that the world&rsquo;s never going to run out</p>
<p>of new ideas for business software.</p>
<p>Business keeps changing, so therefore,</p>
<p>the software that businesses need will keep changing</p>
<p>and there will always be an opportunity there</p>
<p>for new companies, new verticals, new niches,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll always be new ideas.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m never worried about running out</p>
<p>in terms of how we evaluate the actual idea.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve actually been super transparent</p>
<p>around the metrics that we need to see.</p>
<p>It really does start with a company hitting</p>
<p>the metrics hurdle that we need to see</p>
<p>for example, Series A.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, call it, you&rsquo;re roughly more or less</p>
<p>a million dollars of ARR, you want to be growing</p>
<p>15% month over month, certain net dollar retention,</p>
<p>certain capital efficiency.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve published it on our website and on our blog.</p>
<p>So it starts with that and then once we know</p>
<p>that our thresholds have been hit,</p>
<p>then we get into more qualitative or subjective factors</p>
<p>like what do we think about this founder in this market?</p>
<p>But one thing I like about it is just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very well defined, like what we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>And so just go to our blog, you&rsquo;ll see,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll tell you exactly, there&rsquo;s no mystery to it.</p>
<p>Outside of productivity tools though,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a single company that can stay</p>
<p>in one category and become really big.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a single public company that doesn&rsquo;t have now</p>
<p>an entire strategy that says we sell at SMB,</p>
<p>mid-market, and enterprise.</p>
<p>And so the thing for SaaS businesses,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re like a really powerful productivity tool,</p>
<p>like a Slack or an Atlassian,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re valuation capped in the mid to high</p>
<p>single digit billions as it currently stands today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the law of the math in the public markets</p>
<p>on how you&rsquo;re rewarded.</p>
<p>How do you grow out of it?</p>
<p>You have to embrace a strategy that actually does more</p>
<p>where you become a system of record.</p>
<p>So a good example is like a Zendesk.</p>
<p>They hit an upper bound.</p>
<p>You know, there are many of these examples.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re building a SaaS business</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re investing in a SaaS business,</p>
<p>the other thing to think about is</p>
<p>in the absence of being a productivity tool,</p>
<p>of which again, there are a few,</p>
<p>everything else has to find a way of being applicable</p>
<p>to larger bodies over time in order to maintain valuation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to try and move faster</p>
<p>so we can get more people.</p>
<p>Yeah, another question here?</p>
<p>Hi there, guys.</p>
<p>Favorite besties, probably four-way tie,</p>
<p>but maybe Chamath edges out just a bit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a tie.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Tie goes to Chamath.</p>
<p>Quick question.</p>
<p>So, you know, you guys have done incredibly well.</p>
<p>So what would you do if you&rsquo;re dropped in the middle</p>
<p>of say Kansas, take away the resource,</p>
<p>take away the network and take you back to age 25?</p>
<p>What would you do and why?</p>
<p>Antonio, take it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually from Michigan.</p>
<p>I got dropped in the middle of there with no resources</p>
<p>and not a lot to do.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t 25, I was in my early 20s.</p>
<p>I would find a way to make it work, man.</p>
<p>You should get, you should actually,</p>
<p>whatever skill you want to start at,</p>
<p>whatever job you have,</p>
<p>I would try and start a little company.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always people, and listen,</p>
<p>a place like Graham is Michigan, man,</p>
<p>you could cut grass.</p>
<p>I had a little computer company when I was 12 years old,</p>
<p>doing like networking for people in the old days.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s always something you can do</p>
<p>if you had a valuable skill.</p>
<p>Build a skill, start a company, and just get started.</p>
<p>Start moving and make good decisions along the way.</p>
<p>One good decision compounds on top of the other</p>
<p>and all four of these guys,</p>
<p>what they have done in their careers</p>
<p>is made very good decisions and they&rsquo;ve kept moving</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;ve had problems.</p>
<p>And you start early.</p>
<p>Yeah, you gotta start early.</p>
<p>You gotta start early.</p>
<p>I just want to tell you this,</p>
<p>they may look like super successful guys now,</p>
<p>and they are, but it wasn&rsquo;t easy,</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t linear.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve all had ups and downs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve all had problems.</p>
<p>I still do.</p>
<p>And they all still do.</p>
<p>What they do, and I have great respect for all four of them,</p>
<p>I know them all well,</p>
<p>they keep making good decisions,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re highly resilient, and they just keep going.</p>
<p>And I would tell you to do the same thing.</p>
<p>You gotta just keep going.</p>
<p>The only thing I&rsquo;d add to that is to keep learning.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, I&rsquo;m getting some applause here, man.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, go.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had any, man, I haven&rsquo;t had any.</p>
<p>I just got here.</p>
<p>But I would just say keep learning as well.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages I&rsquo;ve had in my career</p>
<p>is that I try to always learn new stuff as often as I can.</p>
<p>And whenever I find an area of interest,</p>
<p>I pursue it in terms of deepening my understanding of it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always created opportunities for me</p>
<p>that I wouldn&rsquo;t have just stumbled across</p>
<p>or walked my way into.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a great opportunity to have you here, Antonio,</p>
<p>and I asked you to do this.</p>
<p>You had never been on a podcast before.</p>
<p>Have you never done this kind of thing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done this kind of thing, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome, thanks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only doing it because it&rsquo;s the four of you,</p>
<p>and I am usually very private, but I&rsquo;m enjoying it.</p>
<p>You have an incredible voice.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like very like, very NPR, very public radio.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, everybody, you&rsquo;re listening</p>
<p>to The Politics of Culture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Antonio Gracias.</p>
<p>People tell me I have a voice for radio and pornography.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It works pretty well.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, I&rsquo;m Samantha.</p>
<p>Favorite bestie is Friedberg.</p>
<p>I run the factory automation team</p>
<p>for a large semiconductor manufacturer</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>Really unimpressed with the innovation</p>
<p>in industrial automation, and so really interested</p>
<p>to hear your thoughts on where you see</p>
<p>the next disruptions in automation,</p>
<p>and also maybe a question for Antonio.</p>
<p>Where do you see the disruptor specifically</p>
<p>in how we get not only the technology,</p>
<p>but the economies of scale for these</p>
<p>really capital-intensive businesses in the US?</p>
<p>This is your guy to answer this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And by the way, you should talk about automation</p>
<p>at, I don&rsquo;t know if you want to, but Tesla, yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we know a lot of automation.</p>
<p>One of my partners is like a genius engineer</p>
<p>in this area, and you&rsquo;re particularly</p>
<p>in the chip business, you said, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, TSMC basically took the,</p>
<p>this idea of outsourcing manufacturing assets</p>
<p>that Intel did with TSMC in the beginning,</p>
<p>they created that business and moved most</p>
<p>of our high technology and chips offshore into Taiwan.</p>
<p>This is like a terrible idea.</p>
<p>And I think, as I said earlier,</p>
<p>we need industrial policy in this country.</p>
<p>I think we need industrial policy</p>
<p>to bring chip manufacturing back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>And the problem you have in automation</p>
<p>and chip manufacturing in particular is,</p>
<p>you know, when you think about where</p>
<p>all the great engineers go today,</p>
<p>they go to automation, they&rsquo;re not going there</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re competing with TSMC.</p>
<p>So you have a couple of Intel fabs still in the US,</p>
<p>but we have to have some, I think actually</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to require industrial policy</p>
<p>to force people like Intel, AMD,</p>
<p>to want to bring stuff back into the US,</p>
<p>and to really get great talent to want to do it.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s opportunities</p>
<p>outside of Greenfield models to kind of reinvigorate</p>
<p>and unlock the capacity that we have</p>
<p>in some of our older manufacturing here in the US?</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>Look, we at Tesla took over the,</p>
<p>this Fremont factory was a former GM Toyota factory.</p>
<p>And, you know, we retooled it.</p>
<p>It was, look, it would have been,</p>
<p>we had to do it because we didn&rsquo;t have any money,</p>
<p>and it was free basically.</p>
<p>But if you took that approach</p>
<p>and you got really great entrepreneurs</p>
<p>to focus on this problem through an industrial policy,</p>
<p>they need money to do it,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d get great innovation.</p>
<p>Look, NVIDIA is actually here in the US.</p>
<p>This is a reality.</p>
<p>This is a great chip company.</p>
<p>And the fabs they use are spread all over the world.</p>
<p>But if you gave NVIDIA a fab or two,</p>
<p>who knows what happens if it was the right price.</p>
<p>Yeah, Jensen&rsquo;s a great CEO.</p>
<p>Did you go to that side?</p>
<p>Favorite bestie, Jason, you keep the ship together.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the glue that keeps it together.</p>
<p>My name is Chris.</p>
<p>My friend and I started All In Talk nine months ago.</p>
<p>The fan page for the.</p>
<p>Thank you, cheers to you, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, obviously.</p>
<p>I was at the outdoor mall near my house</p>
<p>and my dog attacked another dog.</p>
<p>And the guy was like, it&rsquo;s okay, I saw you on TikTok.</p>
<p>I was like, dude, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>So that was because of you.</p>
<p>Thank you, I didn&rsquo;t get sued.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t for your channel.</p>
<p>That was for his Kinwa channel.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t your channel, that was.</p>
<p>So my question is in the 2022 predictions episode,</p>
<p>you talk about all in media idea</p>
<p>and starting an all in media channel maybe.</p>
<p>And I wonder if you guys have talked about that anymore,</p>
<p>your goals for the future on that.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m pretty sure everyone would agree here</p>
<p>that if you did start one,</p>
<p>it would do a whole lot better than CNN Plus.</p>
<p>Well, that may not be a very high bar.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a very low bar.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We actually did get together, the four of us.</p>
<p>We sat in Freeberg&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>What a shit show.</p>
<p>People started yelling, two people walked out.</p>
<p>Sax just started to do this at the table.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m definitely a good driver.</p>
<p>My dad lets me drive in the driveway.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a productive conversation.</p>
<p>It was completely unproductive.</p>
<p>It was completely unproductive.</p>
<p>That was our first and only meeting.</p>
<p>But no, but we did take one key step,</p>
<p>which is that Freeberg said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get my team to draft the LLC agreement</p>
<p>for the four of us.</p>
<p>Which we refused to sign.</p>
<p>And now no one&rsquo;s signed it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in our inbox.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re one step closer to starting it.</p>
<p>But joking aside, I still think</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;ll become inevitable.</p>
<p>And I think the reason is the two people,</p>
<p>the robots, non-humans,</p>
<p>that were uncomfortable with human interaction,</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s, David&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, chill, I&rsquo;m like.</p>
<p>Lifters, you know?</p>
<p>Once we do the recap of this,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll be,</p>
<p>I think these two are probably the most shocked.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you, by the way,</p>
<p>my observation, I used to go to TED.</p>
<p>I went to TED from 2008 to 2019.</p>
<p>I stopped going to TED</p>
<p>because I thought the content went to shit.</p>
<p>And it basically got overtaken</p>
<p>with social justice talks.</p>
<p>And I used to start at tech</p>
<p>and interesting ideas about where the world&rsquo;s headed.</p>
<p>And I listened to our speakers this week,</p>
<p>the last few days,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, man, really fantastic content.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this could be the new TED.</p>
<p>So I got really invigorated by that.</p>
<p>I really thought, I felt like that was really necessary.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s conversations</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t really seem to want to have, right?</p>
<p>Like, and that, and those are,</p>
<p>well, and let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>you were not the earliest believer</p>
<p>in this was going to get pulled off.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how many times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve considered quitting the pod</p>
<p>and not even showing up for this event.</p>
<p>And I give Jason props publicly</p>
<p>for doing a great job pulling this thing off, so.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Go, go.</p>
<p>Hey guys, my name is Sarah,</p>
<p>and I really love all of you.</p>
<p>You got me through a very tough,</p>
<p>challenging time when I started listening to you.</p>
<p>I came here over 16 hour flight from Abu Dhabi,</p>
<p>so thank you.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a long flight.</p>
<p>We love you, we love you.</p>
<p>I have a comment and a question.</p>
<p>The comment, and maybe David.</p>
<p>I have a lot of relatives in Sweden,</p>
<p>and when the Ukrainian war started,</p>
<p>this is very amiable, innovative, beautiful people,</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had a war over 150 years,</p>
<p>and they were putting gas in their car</p>
<p>and supplying cans of goods,</p>
<p>and got really, really nervous about what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>and were watching closely to see</p>
<p>what would be the next step,</p>
<p>I think, if the U.S. did not step in.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of reality out there</p>
<p>for the U.S. to stay, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like the savior of the world in a certain way or another.</p>
<p>Finnish people felt the same way, Moldovans.</p>
<p>So this is a real big reality</p>
<p>out in the Western European world,</p>
<p>not just Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s on my comment, so thank you.</p>
<p>For the question, and this comes from my husband.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sitting on excess liquidity right now</p>
<p>and want to invest for a long time.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Sax is raising a fund.</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>Was that a transition from World War III to?</p>
<p>Investment advice, stock tips?</p>
<p>Stock tips?</p>
<p>Yeah, how to make money in the market?</p>
<p>We want to save.</p>
<p>I mean, that is dynamic range right there.</p>
<p>Well done, well done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gone from two poles.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, you know the ups and downs of my life,</p>
<p>so yes, it is like that.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just take the first part?</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;d be good.</p>
<p>So on Ukraine, you know, I thought it was important</p>
<p>to have this debate today</p>
<p>where we got both sides of the issue.</p>
<p>And we got two people who are very passionate</p>
<p>on both sides.</p>
<p>And I tend to agree more with Glenn on it,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t want to help Ukraine at all.</p>
<p>I just think we have to keep a close eye</p>
<p>on preventing this thing from escalating into World War III</p>
<p>because the Russians have 6,000 nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and their military doctrine says they can use them</p>
<p>if they feel that they&rsquo;re existentially threatened.</p>
<p>And so, you know, if our objective here</p>
<p>is to help the Ukrainians expel the Russians</p>
<p>from an invasion, that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>But if our objective, if we have mission creep</p>
<p>into destabilizing the Russian regime</p>
<p>and to basically trying to take back Crimea,</p>
<p>which they see as theirs,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re trying to weaken them to the point</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re no longer a great power,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really playing with fire there.</p>
<p>So we have to be really careful about our objectives there</p>
<p>and make sure that we don&rsquo;t let this thing</p>
<p>spiral out of control.</p>
<p>Antonio, you have thoughts on Ukraine</p>
<p>and are we being too dovish or hawkish</p>
<p>or doing it just right?</p>
<p>So I think we are, there&rsquo;s a lot more going on here</p>
<p>than may meet the eye.</p>
<p>This question was about Sweden and Finland</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s what I would say,</p>
<p>because I want to focus on that,</p>
<p>that if our friends in particularly Northwestern Europe</p>
<p>should actually be arming themselves</p>
<p>and if they arm themselves, we won&rsquo;t have this problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality of it.</p>
<p>The reason Ukraine, yes, that&rsquo;s the reality of it.</p>
<p>Obviously they&rsquo;re learning their lesson now.</p>
<p>The time for sitting on the sidelines</p>
<p>in Central Europe is over.</p>
<p>If you care about your country,</p>
<p>care about your children, care about your families,</p>
<p>then you should arm yourselves.</p>
<p>Period, full stop.</p>
<p>An American would be very happy to sell you weapons.</p>
<p>No problem, what they&rsquo;re without NATO.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>The reason the Ukrainians are able to defend themselves</p>
<p>is because they have actually been buying weapons</p>
<p>and they built their own weapons with the Turks.</p>
<p>The drones that are being used</p>
<p>to destroy the Russian supply lines</p>
<p>are not coming from America.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming from a joint venture with the Turks.</p>
<p>This is the reality.</p>
<p>So should we be drawn into a war in Central Europe?</p>
<p>No, I think it could start World War III.</p>
<p>Should we help these folks defend themselves?</p>
<p>Yes, I should.</p>
<p>And in your particular part of the world,</p>
<p>yeah, for sure, start buying some weapons.</p>
<p>One question, over here, yeah.</p>
<p>Tough to follow, but my name&rsquo;s Ioana.</p>
<p>Favorite bestie, I think Friedberg.</p>
<p>I think you do a good job of being heard</p>
<p>and hearing others equally,</p>
<p>so I think that&rsquo;s an important skill.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to work on it myself.</p>
<p>More Friedberg.</p>
<p>More Friedberg, wow.</p>
<p>In terms of my question, it&rsquo;s a little more qualitative,</p>
<p>but some of us were having an interesting discussion</p>
<p>about first impressions last night,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m curious to think,</p>
<p>one, in terms of your own first impressions,</p>
<p>how has the way that you introduce yourself</p>
<p>to others changed as you&rsquo;ve grown,</p>
<p>and what have you learned about that?</p>
<p>And on the other end,</p>
<p>what are some of the most notable first impressions</p>
<p>others have made on you,</p>
<p>and why have those stood out to you?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>Well, seeing as only two of us have emotions,</p>
<p>maybe we can.</p>
<p>Yeah, we can chop it out, sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t find any emotions there.</p>
<p>Turn the mic off, please, the quinoa.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Oh my Lord.</p>
<p>That Baba Ganesh goes right through you.</p>
<p>Continue.</p>
<p>Baba Ganesh.</p>
<p>I think that when I was younger,</p>
<p>I was more insecure,</p>
<p>so I had to wear what few labels I had on my sleeve</p>
<p>and use them as a weapon</p>
<p>before others could use their labels on me.</p>
<p>I honestly felt that way.</p>
<p>And in Silicon Valley at the time,</p>
<p>it really, there is a very monocultural aspect</p>
<p>of folks from a few schools,</p>
<p>folks having worked at a few companies,</p>
<p>and I had neither.</p>
<p>I went to Waterloo, which is in Canada,</p>
<p>and I worked at AOL,</p>
<p>so I didn&rsquo;t go to Stanford,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t work at Google or Yahoo.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a great lineage of where</p>
<p>the really credentialed, credible folks came from.</p>
<p>And so you do what any insecure person does.</p>
<p>You kind of throw what few things you have out there</p>
<p>very quickly, trying to one-up the person in front of you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s calmed down a lot,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s probably the biggest thing that&rsquo;s changed.</p>
<p>It has, and I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I have a similar observation.</p>
<p>When I was taking that R train into Manhattan,</p>
<p>I used to say to myself,</p>
<p>Jason Calacanis, editor-in-chief.</p>
<p>Jason Calacanis, millionaire.</p>
<p>And I was like, literally had a 16-page photocopy magazine</p>
<p>called Silicon Island Reporter,</p>
<p>and I was trying to convince myself</p>
<p>that someday I would be somebody.</p>
<p>And I think that narrative was important for me,</p>
<p>and people, when I would give them the 16-page photocopy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, here&rsquo;s my magazine,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d say, this is a photocopy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, no, it&rsquo;s a magazine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a picture on the cover.</p>
<p>Because for me, that was why it was a magazine.</p>
<p>And it eventually became a very large magazine, in fact,</p>
<p>of 300 pages.</p>
<p>And today, thank you.</p>
<p>So I think there is something about manifesting stuff</p>
<p>and just believing that you&rsquo;re going to get there.</p>
<p>But today, I define myself by the things I love to do.</p>
<p>So when people do ask me now, hey, what do you do?</p>
<p>I say, I&rsquo;m a writer and I have a podcast,</p>
<p>and I angel invest.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s the number one podcast</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m one of the top angel investors of all time.</p>
<p>I just think about what,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t say, you know, like it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the book is in 11 languages or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a million dollar advance.</p>
<p>I just, there&rsquo;s no ego about it.</p>
<p>I just say writer, podcaster, angel.</p>
<p>Okay, how did it go in there?</p>
<p>Okay, David, you&rsquo;re okay?</p>
<p>What sort of advance are you getting?</p>
<p>A million dollars, he said.</p>
<p>A million dollar advance.</p>
<p>I mean, the book&rsquo;s in 12 languages now, thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sign it.</p>
<p>If you have one, I&rsquo;ll sign it.</p>
<p>Next question.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think Jason&rsquo;s just pimping out all of us</p>
<p>to fuel his media career.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You think?</p>
<p>Sometimes?</p>
<p>You think?</p>
<p>Hey David, all honesty,</p>
<p>how has the deal flow gone since you got this podcast?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s down 50%.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>That was the intent.</p>
<p>That was the intent.</p>
<p>More deal flow coming this way.</p>
<p>Down 50%.</p>
<p>Down 50%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s since you went on Tucker.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Today the crypto world is focused on decentralization,</p>
<p>speculation, and stores of value.</p>
<p>Who here is excited about micropayments?</p>
<p>And whoever is most excited,</p>
<p>which industries do you think will be most impacted</p>
<p>by the newfound ability to send payments</p>
<p>in as little as one hundredth of a penny?</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Oh, favorite bestie, they want to.</p>
<p>Sax, you want to take it?</p>
<p>Yeah, go ahead, Sax.</p>
<p>So, you know, this question of micropayments</p>
<p>has come up all the way since, you know,</p>
<p>back to when I was working on PayPal.</p>
<p>And one of the problems with micropayments is,</p>
<p>as the name suggests, the amounts are very, very small.</p>
<p>So, you have to do a lot of them</p>
<p>to create enough volume for them to be meaningful.</p>
<p>And so there was always sort of this market size problem.</p>
<p>Now, for crypto, there may be more of an opportunity there</p>
<p>because the way that the old credit card rails network works</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s like a 25 cent charge per transaction.</p>
<p>And so, like at PayPal, it just didn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>to facilitate micropayments</p>
<p>because the cost of that transaction</p>
<p>always exceeded the fee that we could get.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re right that,</p>
<p>or I think what you&rsquo;re suggesting with your question</p>
<p>is that there is sort of a crypto opportunity</p>
<p>to do this in a different way</p>
<p>because you can basically do</p>
<p>a costless instantaneous transfer</p>
<p>using a blockchain-based currency.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m sure someone&rsquo;s going to do</p>
<p>something interesting with that.</p>
<p>And then the question is just how,</p>
<p>like what does that aggregate into?</p>
<p>Is it going to be big enough to be?</p>
<p>By the way, there&rsquo;s an interim step</p>
<p>which is also pretty obvious, at least to me,</p>
<p>which is this idea that, you know, for example,</p>
<p>like if Stripe actually took the time</p>
<p>to embrace one of these stable coins,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason why Stripe needs</p>
<p>to actually run on Interchange as well.</p>
<p>Because like you can just basically swap that dollar</p>
<p>in a ledger into USDC, let&rsquo;s just pick that as an example,</p>
<p>not Tether, not to tilt you,</p>
<p>run it on those rails for free</p>
<p>and then basically transfer it back.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not obvious why people don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You need the gas cost to come down.</p>
<p>So, you know, like you&rsquo;re running a transaction</p>
<p>on Ethereum or certainly Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Ethereum is very expensive right now.</p>
<p>Other chains.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you need like a chain,</p>
<p>like a salon or something like that.</p>
<p>Something that&rsquo;s like super cheap.</p>
<p>And the cognitive load of the transaction,</p>
<p>just the person deciding, do they want to pay</p>
<p>a 10th of a penny a penny,</p>
<p>is sometimes greater than the actual value of the money,</p>
<p>which then creates almost like friction</p>
<p>to them wanting to read the article.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take another question.</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Kate and my favorite bestie right now</p>
<p>is Friedberg, who often plays devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p>and so force is a stepwise conversation.</p>
<p>Running away with it, Friedberg.</p>
<p>Woo, Friedberg, my lord.</p>
<p>How many people did you pay off?</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>So we all admire your successes,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve also been hearing from Mar, for instance,</p>
<p>that we need to be comfortable with failure</p>
<p>and we need to become resilient.</p>
<p>So when you look back on your careers thus far,</p>
<p>what have been the toughest moments,</p>
<p>the moments when you&rsquo;ve made a mistake</p>
<p>that have taught you a lot?</p>
<p>I mean, I had two huge ones.</p>
<p>And Antonio must have some too, yeah.</p>
<p>Mistakes.</p>
<p>My mistakes?</p>
<p>That you learned the most from.</p>
<p>Man, my biggest mistakes in life have been about people.</p>
<p>And I have, over the years, made errors in judging people</p>
<p>and how honest they were and how good they were.</p>
<p>And as I look back on that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because I have a weakness for ideas that are great.</p>
<p>And sometimes those come with great people</p>
<p>and sometimes they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The reality is there are some bad people out there</p>
<p>who are acting really great and doing interesting things.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve suffered from that.</p>
<p>I mean, I know David and I already deal together</p>
<p>that suffer from that.</p>
<p>And it happens.</p>
<p>So I would be, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone deep into neuroscience.</p>
<p>Actually have a stat.</p>
<p>We have a woman who&rsquo;s got a PhD</p>
<p>in the neuroscience of emotion from Caltech now on staff</p>
<p>that helps us learn, as you said,</p>
<p>always learning about how to assess people</p>
<p>and how to assess their emotional states.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most important thing I think we&rsquo;ve updated</p>
<p>in our process and in my own thinking.</p>
<p>So you love the idea so much that you ignored the other data</p>
<p>that this person was not honorable, truthful.</p>
<p>No, I mean, so there are times when,</p>
<p>there are two kinds of errors here.</p>
<p>One type of error is we just didn&rsquo;t see it</p>
<p>because the person was so good at being bad.</p>
<p>They are, one of the things that neuroscientists taught us</p>
<p>is that about 5% of the human population</p>
<p>has a brain anomaly that make them actual psychopaths</p>
<p>defined as the amygdala doesn&rsquo;t fire properly</p>
<p>when they do something bad, guilt, fear, et cetera.</p>
<p>And in our particular industry, it&rsquo;s probably more like 10%.</p>
<p>So we raised our base rate forecast to 10%</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gotten better.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some people that are so good at it,</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>I mean, Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes, okay?</p>
<p>Like lots of smart people running that company.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t, but it wasn&rsquo;t obvious to them, obviously.</p>
<p>Then there are moments earlier on</p>
<p>when we had yellow flags, we overrode</p>
<p>because we were so emotionally committed to the idea</p>
<p>that we had a business we did was in the dental space,</p>
<p>it was Medicaid dental clinics for kids</p>
<p>that were black and Hispanic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m from that demographic</p>
<p>and I wanted to make that great.</p>
<p>And the reality is we overrode yellow lights</p>
<p>because we wanted to make it great and we failed.</p>
<p>Jamatha, you were going to add some of your failures.</p>
<p>I had two huge failures,</p>
<p>but they were more personal moments of learning for me.</p>
<p>One was, you know, we were in the midst of building a phone</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t come to pass.</p>
<p>And if I really think about what I thought the problem was,</p>
<p>this was when I was at Facebook,</p>
<p>what the problem then versus now,</p>
<p>then, you know, I would have said,</p>
<p>oh, Zuck and I had a huge kind of, you know,</p>
<p>thing and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Now, what I would have said is, you know,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really understand my own limitations</p>
<p>and what I was really asking of him and the board</p>
<p>in that moment.</p>
<p>And then the second is there were all these moments</p>
<p>that were people decisions at Social Capital</p>
<p>that ultimately manifested in sub quality financial</p>
<p>and investment decisions.</p>
<p>And had I had it to do over again,</p>
<p>I would not have ignored some of the red flags</p>
<p>because I was so desirous to be in the game,</p>
<p>to, you know, be in it that I probably, you know,</p>
<p>looked the other way a little bit on folks that,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ll just give you the practical example.</p>
<p>I remember in a $300 million fund,</p>
<p>I put 25 or $30 million into Bitcoin at 50 bucks a coin.</p>
<p>And when the thing went to like 150 or something,</p>
<p>just the pressure to distribute was so high.</p>
<p>And I had conviction, I had all of these things,</p>
<p>I had all the voting control, I had everything to just say,</p>
<p>no, and I didn&rsquo;t have the courage to understand my role</p>
<p>as a leader versus something, you know,</p>
<p>my job as a investment partner.</p>
<p>And so you learn, you know, you learn what you&rsquo;re good at,</p>
<p>you learn where your strengths are,</p>
<p>and you try to just get better,</p>
<p>try to fix those weaknesses.</p>
<p>I mean, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re both saying is the same thing,</p>
<p>which is ultimately, it has nothing to do with anybody else.</p>
<p>It still comes back to you and what your skill set is</p>
<p>in your toolbox and whether you&rsquo;re upgrading</p>
<p>your toolbox every day.</p>
<p>Friedberg, Sachs, any mistakes that you&rsquo;re able to access</p>
<p>through your CPUs?</p>
<p>In your long-term storage?</p>
<p>Well, I think as you get older,</p>
<p>you learn how to pick your battles better.</p>
<p>And you just have to decide like,</p>
<p>what are the occasions that are really worth fighting for,</p>
<p>which aren&rsquo;t, you know?</p>
<p>And sometimes you just let it go,</p>
<p>and others you have to fight.</p>
<p>So, and just knowing when you should choose which path,</p>
<p>I think is really important.</p>
<p>When you were younger?</p>
<p>And by the way, the guy you really want behind you</p>
<p>in a battle is this guy.</p>
<p>So, phenomenal investor,</p>
<p>back when I was on the founder side of the table, so.</p>
<p>Good brawler?</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I got him a samurai sword for his birthday.</p>
<p>He did, yes.</p>
<p>What did you get him for his birthday?</p>
<p>A samurai sword.</p>
<p>The collection of samurai swords you saw in my apartment</p>
<p>started with David Sachs&rsquo; samurai sword.</p>
<p>Ah, very nice, very nice.</p>
<p>Thank you, David.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very sharp, too.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your kids trying to play with it or something?</p>
<p>It was not a toy.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s not a toy.</p>
<p>Friedberg, anything in that long-term storage</p>
<p>tape drives of a?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve made a lot of mistakes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very hard on myself.</p>
<p>When I was young, I always said there&rsquo;s no limit.</p>
<p>And I always believed that.</p>
<p>And when I hit walls in my life,</p>
<p>it was very difficult because it totally countered</p>
<p>what I felt was possible.</p>
<p>I always thought everything was gonna be a success.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m gonna let anything fucking fail.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m gonna let anything not work.</p>
<p>My voice is cracking now because I&rsquo;m crying</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m losing my voice.</p>
<p>So, um.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s who you need.</p>
<p>If you cry now, then everybody&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>oh, Friedberg&rsquo;s my favorite fast food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all for the vote, it&rsquo;s all for the vote.</p>
<p>He actually does have emotions, see?</p>
<p>But I would say.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s smart and kind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And a vegan.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake I made.</p>
<p>I love him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s my dream boyfriend.</p>
<p>Maybe coming on this stage was the biggest mistake I&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>Ah, joint in the pocket.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>But I think Antonio&rsquo;s point is right.</p>
<p>You just have to be willing to learn and evolve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, I now know that my life</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t about everything I do has to work 100% of the time.</p>
<p>And being so hard on myself caused a lot of, like,</p>
<p>emotional challenges for me over time.</p>
<p>But getting to this point where I can now</p>
<p>be much more calculated and just be more open</p>
<p>and more calculated and just move forward quickly</p>
<p>and learn from it has been a big evolution for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a general statement.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I would.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, Jason.</p>
<p>Well, no, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I just, I was thinking about it while these guys</p>
<p>were being so candid and I was immediately</p>
<p>gonna punt and go to the next question,</p>
<p>but I thought that would be unfair.</p>
<p>You know, I think two things.</p>
<p>One, I think a lot of my decision making early on</p>
<p>was out of fear.</p>
<p>A fear of losing whatever I had gained up until that point.</p>
<p>So although I was a risk taker and I was being bold</p>
<p>in one way, I was also throttling myself</p>
<p>because I was just so scared that I would lose</p>
<p>whatever gains I had.</p>
<p>And it made me an imperfect manager of people,</p>
<p>an imperfect person, maybe on edge a little too much</p>
<p>and maybe not picking my battles.</p>
<p>To David&rsquo;s point, I saw everything as a battle</p>
<p>because those wins were so important to me</p>
<p>because they were so hard fought.</p>
<p>And then I think later in my life I realized</p>
<p>I never actually thought about what I enjoyed.</p>
<p>I just thought about winning to an extent</p>
<p>that was not healthy.</p>
<p>And then after Dave Goldberg died and Tony Hsieh died,</p>
<p>I really took a self-assessment of what I enjoyed doing.</p>
<p>And I mentioned this yesterday,</p>
<p>you know, hanging out with these gentlemen</p>
<p>and to Antonio&rsquo;s way of phrasing it,</p>
<p>which is just beautiful, the fellowship.</p>
<p>I thought that&rsquo;s the joy, you know, my family,</p>
<p>my kids, my wife, and this fellowship with my friends</p>
<p>that I wanted to invest in.</p>
<p>And I made a deliberate effort to be a better friend,</p>
<p>a better parent, a better husband.</p>
<p>Because of all the gains I got from that</p>
<p>and the joy that I got from it.</p>
<p>And I just thought a little bit,</p>
<p>God, I do like those conversations.</p>
<p>I do like writing the book.</p>
<p>I do like throwing the events.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna do things I enjoy,</p>
<p>which took me 30 years of my career</p>
<p>to actually assess what is it that I like?</p>
<p>And maybe I should enjoy the journey a little bit more.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take one more.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey.</p>
<p>Hi, besties.</p>
<p>My name&rsquo;s Aria.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the third or fourth employee at DoorDash.</p>
<p>And my question is regarding,</p>
<p>oh, sorry, my favorite bestie,</p>
<p>yeah, that was a joke, by the way.</p>
<p>My favorite besties, Chamath and Sax,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s honestly Sophie&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>My question&rsquo;s regarding the positive impact</p>
<p>that Silicon Valley could have</p>
<p>on the political discourse and politics,</p>
<p>which I know, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s typically an aversion to in tech.</p>
<p>You know, you all have done a fantastic job</p>
<p>outlining what those problems are,</p>
<p>as well as your guests.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m wondering is what a viable path forward looks like.</p>
<p>You know, Chamath, you mentioned that people in D.C.</p>
<p>pay close attention to the podcast.</p>
<p>Sax has recently endorsed Michael Schellenberger,</p>
<p>which I really hope can save our home state.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m wondering, is the solution</p>
<p>something akin to a third party,</p>
<p>like what Andrew Yang is trying to do,</p>
<p>or some new, I don&rsquo;t know, Silicon Valley techno party,</p>
<p>or, you know, is there, you know,</p>
<p>what does that look like?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s set up</p>
<p>to actually have a third party.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s structurally in America.</p>
<p>So what you have to do, practically speaking,</p>
<p>is field more centrist normal people on both sides,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re Republicans or Democrats.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a practical thing that we can all do,</p>
<p>and then we can all show up and vote for those people</p>
<p>so that the majority voice is much clearer than it is today,</p>
<p>because right now the fringes, a little bit,</p>
<p>get to hijack the process.</p>
<p>And so we take things that should be common sense,</p>
<p>and we pervert them in a way</p>
<p>that just makes no progress possible.</p>
<p>I really do think that we have that impact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how much of that can be quantified,</p>
<p>but when I spend time in D.C.,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s true what I was told,</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;ve heard from people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically required listening or viewing.</p>
<p>It helps shapes people&rsquo;s opinions.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they follow it,</p>
<p>but I think it helps people think about things</p>
<p>in a more normal way.</p>
<p>I think what happened today is like a perfect example.</p>
<p>Like the way that Glenn Greenwald</p>
<p>and Antonio Garcia Martinez debate,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s probably, for some of you,</p>
<p>was really unsettling, maybe.</p>
<p>Raise your hand if you were just like you felt awkward.</p>
<p>Honestly, just be honest with you.</p>
<p>Okay, well, you shouldn&rsquo;t, because that&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>My point is it helps you make it seem more normal,</p>
<p>because those guys were not saying to each other</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re worthless and you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>They were just debating.</p>
<p>By the way, we went out for a beer after that.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is my point.</p>
<p>So the three of us, I was like,</p>
<p>okay, we need to go out and get a drink and cool down,</p>
<p>so yeah, it was enjoyable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not chastising you for feeling that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying this is what the culture does to folks.</p>
<p>It makes you even afraid to hear people debate things</p>
<p>and still have respect for each other.</p>
<p>The way that he and Palmer kind of dealt with that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>The courage that Palmer had to say what he did,</p>
<p>and then for him to be the first guy to walk out</p>
<p>and then to own that,</p>
<p>I think those are really important moments,</p>
<p>and you have&hellip;</p>
<p>And you have&hellip;</p>
<p>And you have&hellip;</p>
<p>And you have&hellip;</p>
<p>And you have&hellip;</p>
<p>And you have&hellip;</p>
<p>And you have&hellip;</p>
<p>And you have&hellip;</p>
<p>And you have&hellip;</p>
<p>And you have&hellip;</p>
<p>Because of what just happened, so&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a slow march</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;re writing a small dent in a small way.</p>
<p>20 years ago every political show on TV</p>
<p>was a debate format.</p>
<p>Like, going all the way back to</p>
<p>William F. Buckley versus Gore Vidal,</p>
<p>or Pat Buckhannon versus Michael Kinsley on Crossfire.</p>
<p>They were all debates.</p>
<p>Now, none of them are debates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all just their own little echo chambers.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why this pot is successful</p>
<p>is because we actually can have debates</p>
<p>and there is a divergence of views.</p>
<p>What do you think, Antonio?</p>
<p>Is there some&hellip;</p>
<p>Have you ever listened to this pot?</p>
<p>I was on one once, dancing in the background.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yes, thank you, the dancing bear.</p>
<p>Yeah, he did dance behind him.</p>
<p>I recorded an episode from his house.</p>
<p>When you look at politics, any interest there?</p>
<p>Any behind-the-scenes work you&rsquo;ve done?</p>
<p>And how do you think about it</p>
<p>just as we get into, as Gen Xers,</p>
<p>boomers are going away.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re going to kind of inherit this</p>
<p>whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>Yes, I would say a couple things.</p>
<p>First, whenever you have times,</p>
<p>you look historically,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to contextualize this.</p>
<p>When you have moments of large technological change,</p>
<p>you always have political disruption</p>
<p>because the means of communication have changed.</p>
<p>This Gutenberg press, the tall ship,</p>
<p>and you just go back and look,</p>
<p>it always leads to a lot of disruption and often to war.</p>
<p>And so the question of,</p>
<p>are those of us who are technologists</p>
<p>at the top of the system,</p>
<p>do we have a responsibility</p>
<p>to steward this technology responsibly?</p>
<p>We absolutely do.</p>
<p>I believe we do.</p>
<p>And I think that has been forgotten.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>Number two, I have been involved in campaigns.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting, right now,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m doing is supporting any centrist candidate</p>
<p>that I think is good on either side of the aisle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a registered Democrat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve supported Democrats for most of my life.</p>
<p>But the reality is now,</p>
<p>all I care about is sensible people</p>
<p>that I think are really good.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m engaging in micro-targeting efforts</p>
<p>across the spectrum in primary races.</p>
<p>I would encourage all of you and anyone up here</p>
<p>who cares about the American political system</p>
<p>to engage in the primaries.</p>
<p>Because the primaries are what determines</p>
<p>the quality of the candidates</p>
<p>that actually are up for election.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re actually decided by very few people.</p>
<p>Like how many of us actually voted in the primary?</p>
<p>Like very few of you.</p>
<p>Very few of you, okay?</p>
<p>So rather than us just complain</p>
<p>about the divisiveness of American politics,</p>
<p>next time, please, go vote in a primary.</p>
<p>And go vote for the centrist candidate.</p>
<p>By the way, did I hear a lot of support</p>
<p>for Michael Schellenberger out there?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have him on the pod, maybe.</p>
<p>Hi, favorite bus seat is Chamath.</p>
<p>I heard you speak with Vinod Khosla</p>
<p>at Hack the North at the University of Waterloo.</p>
<p>So my question is,</p>
<p>Chamath talked about these start-up journey systems</p>
<p>like Stanford or PayPal.</p>
<p>Do you see, over the pandemic,</p>
<p>do you see any remote or distributed systems</p>
<p>that have appeared?</p>
<p>Or do you see any building</p>
<p>that are not just centered in one geographical location?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be really honest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a huge believer</p>
<p>in this whole decentralized work movement.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any high-quality work can get done.</p>
<p>On difficult problems.</p>
<p>So I think that there are types of products</p>
<p>and types of problems that can be solved in a remote way.</p>
<p>Certain forms of software for certain kinds of products.</p>
<p>But, for example, let&rsquo;s just say you&rsquo;re trying to engineer</p>
<p>a pharma drug.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that unless you&rsquo;re sitting there</p>
<p>collaborating, talking, debating,</p>
<p>you can do that, necessarily, over a Zoom.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to build something physical,</p>
<p>we have a business that 3D prints rockets.</p>
<p>Those guys can&rsquo;t do that by just Zooming around</p>
<p>and having a couple calls.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s too premature to kind of say</p>
<p>working together has no value.</p>
<p>I also think there&rsquo;s a huge cultural divide</p>
<p>that will get created in America</p>
<p>between these companies that come together</p>
<p>and the companies that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I think that the ones that come together</p>
<p>have a chance of having more empathy in the end</p>
<p>because there are moments where you can actually</p>
<p>get to know the people you&rsquo;re working with every day.</p>
<p>And I think that that gives you margin for error</p>
<p>because everybody sometimes is a little,</p>
<p>dealing with their own things in their lives,</p>
<p>sometimes can be a little rude.</p>
<p>And we all have tolerances.</p>
<p>Those tolerances are higher when you spend time with people.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re much, much lower when you&rsquo;re just in a Zoom.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m, you know, I&rsquo;d love to believe</p>
<p>that everybody&rsquo;s gonna be Airbnb-ing in a castle</p>
<p>in a tent in a fucking tree house,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just not sure that that&rsquo;s realistic</p>
<p>to really solve the big problems that America has.</p>
<p>You believe in the work from home, Antonio?</p>
<p>You have a strong feeling one way or the other?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more at Shabbat&rsquo;s camp than not,</p>
<p>but I will say we have some great companies</p>
<p>that are fully remote.</p>
<p>We have a coalition example in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fully remote, run by wonderful CEOs</p>
<p>under the age of 35.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s found a way to make it work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from him.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m trying to be very open algorithm about this.</p>
<p>And I think there are people who make it work,</p>
<p>I can make it work.</p>
<p>I want my people in the office.</p>
<p>We invest in pharma, we invest in biotech,</p>
<p>and we have some biotech companies</p>
<p>that have made it work remotely</p>
<p>and some that insist on bringing people back.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a lab, obviously you have to be back.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;ll be a mixed environment.</p>
<p>And I also think there&rsquo;s an interesting retooling</p>
<p>going on in productivity.</p>
<p>I think the productivity numbers in America</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re seeing today are wrong</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not capturing what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>underneath the technology</p>
<p>because of these remote environments.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna depend on the CEO</p>
<p>and how good people are</p>
<p>and the type of industry you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m keeping an open mind towards it.</p>
<p>I know that for investing, it was so much more efficient.</p>
<p>People could do 20-minute Zooms</p>
<p>instead of two-hour meetings.</p>
<p>No, but I mean, think of the problem that that created.</p>
<p>Look at the overhang when you could raise</p>
<p>tens of billions of dollars over Zoom.</p>
<p>That turned out to not be a good thing.</p>
<p>Well, but also if you&rsquo;re a capital allocator,</p>
<p>being able to meet with three times as many people,</p>
<p>you could find more companies.</p>
<p>But this is my point.</p>
<p>So I talked to a friend of mine</p>
<p>who raised billions of dollars</p>
<p>over the last couple of years cycle.</p>
<p>And he said,</p>
<p>I was able to raise $50 million checks</p>
<p>in 30-minute meetings.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m spending five hours for a $10 million check.</p>
<p>And my reaction to him in the back of my mind was,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably how it should be.</p>
<p>Well, part of that&rsquo;s liquidity.</p>
<p>That makes the entire system a little bit healthier.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we raised 1.7 billion fund during COVID</p>
<p>and it was like all done doing Zoom.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using new fund now</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m flying around the world taking meetings.</p>
<p>But part of that is because people are coming back</p>
<p>to the office and liquidity cycle&rsquo;s gotten,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reversed on us now, right?</p>
<p>So the denominator&rsquo;s gotten,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotten harder to get capital.</p>
<p>But for sure, I think I agree with Chamath here,</p>
<p>like being able to allocate $10 billion</p>
<p>in a venture fund in two years over Zoom</p>
<p>and think that&rsquo;s on just the metrics and not see people,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a bad idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m talking about 250K, 500K checks.</p>
<p>Might be, okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take another question here.</p>
<p>My name is Kenneth Brown III</p>
<p>and my favorite bestie&rsquo;s J. Cal.</p>
<p>The charisma&rsquo;s legendary.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s my favorite bestie too, by the way.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be offended.</p>
<p>And then my question is,</p>
<p>what advice would you give to non-technical people</p>
<p>trying to fit into the tech-oriented startup venture world?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an econ major, but this just seems exciting.</p>
<p>Like how do I become a part of it?</p>
<p>And Tony, you have thoughts?</p>
<p>And I think that the best way to do this</p>
<p>is to find a company you think is great and get a job.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>I mean, I would associate myself with a business</p>
<p>that I really respect, people respect.</p>
<p>And if the job is in the mail room,</p>
<p>or the job is a janitor, whatever, just figure it out.</p>
<p>Because what happens to high-growth companies</p>
<p>is they need good people.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll be surprised how much being the first person in</p>
<p>and the last person to leave if there&rsquo;s an office</p>
<p>and doing the work that people ask you to do</p>
<p>with a smile and a great attitude,</p>
<p>like those people, they move up fast.</p>
<p>So I would just find a way in, man,</p>
<p>wherever it is, however it is,</p>
<p>make it happen and start moving up.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t agree with you on this one.</p>
<p>By the way, you&rsquo;re not non-technical.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not yet technical.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the opportunity</p>
<p>that sits in front of everyone,</p>
<p>that you can become technical.</p>
<p>I had a cousin who was a music major at UCLA,</p>
<p>worked in music, and then he came back from COVID</p>
<p>and he started learning how to program online,</p>
<p>taught himself, spent six months in his parents&rsquo; basement</p>
<p>teaching himself how to retool his life,</p>
<p>and got some contract jobs on Reddit</p>
<p>and boards and other stuff.</p>
<p>And he got this amazing full-time job offer</p>
<p>a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>And it was really amazing that I got to watch him</p>
<p>transform himself and his life over the last year and a half</p>
<p>just by taking that on himself and he became technical.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that he had a non-technical degree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that he just wasn&rsquo;t yet technical.</p>
<p>And I think everyone has that opportunity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you a great quick story.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a minority guy, grew up in Houston,</p>
<p>really wanted to work at Tesla.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t get a job, couldn&rsquo;t get a job, couldn&rsquo;t get a job.</p>
<p>Finally got a job on the line.</p>
<p>He was making 16, 20 bucks an hour.</p>
<p>Worked there, did well, transferred.</p>
<p>Worked there, did well, transferred.</p>
<p>Ends up in the supply chain group.</p>
<p>Ends up working in battery supply chain.</p>
<p>Ends up basically being two layers between him and Elon.</p>
<p>Gets into an MBA, goes there for a few years,</p>
<p>works on the side, and he ended up raising a bunch of money</p>
<p>to start a battery business recently.</p>
<p>And this is an example of what he just said,</p>
<p>which is there are these jobs available</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s just is your chutzpah and your hustle.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s an example, but it&rsquo;s a very motivating example</p>
<p>to me because it just shows it&rsquo;s so possible.</p>
<p>And there are phenomenal organizations</p>
<p>that identify talent and will move you up really quickly.</p>
<p>And knowledge is literally free,</p>
<p>and experience is up to you.</p>
<p>Yeah, the overriding, I think, advice you&rsquo;re getting here</p>
<p>is that skills are acquirable.</p>
<p>And my Lord, getting to 50, 60% proficiency on a skill,</p>
<p>just given what&rsquo;s on YouTube or MIT OpenCourseWare</p>
<p>or any number of websites,</p>
<p>you can do it in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Now, of course, going from 60, 70, 70 to 80,</p>
<p>that might take months and then eventually years.</p>
<p>But startups are looking for generalists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking for people who can say,</p>
<p>I need somebody who&rsquo;s gonna do the accounting</p>
<p>and figure out how to do an email merge</p>
<p>and build a mailing list,</p>
<p>and then I need somebody to help with recruiting.</p>
<p>If you can just become 30, 40, 50% good</p>
<p>at each of those things at a startup,</p>
<p>before people get specialized,</p>
<p>eventually you&rsquo;ll have 10 people doing recruiting.</p>
<p>But in the beginning, it&rsquo;s one third of somebody&rsquo;s job.</p>
<p>So I love startups for that.</p>
<p>The sign of a great culture of a company</p>
<p>is how little the obvious labels matter</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re inside of it.</p>
<p>And the best companies, like a Tesla,</p>
<p>can become a trillion dollar market cap</p>
<p>because they find the kid working on the line</p>
<p>and then four years later</p>
<p>is running the battery supply chain.</p>
<p>How does that happen?</p>
<p>It happens because you&rsquo;re looking at the quality</p>
<p>of the individual and their potential.</p>
<p>Where they went to school doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Their gender doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Their ethnicity doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>None of it matters because the people don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>They see work ethic.</p>
<p>They see effort.</p>
<p>Results.</p>
<p>They see effort.</p>
<p>They see integrity.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another litmus test for you</p>
<p>is in the companies, even if you&rsquo;re a CEO</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re building,</p>
<p>if every other day you&rsquo;re reminding everybody else</p>
<p>of where people need to have gone to school</p>
<p>and where they should have been,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a road to nowhere.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give Antonio a big round of applause.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Appreciate it, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you later.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Thank you, man.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you, too.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Good to see you.</p>
<p>Good to see you, too.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>My brother.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Talk to you soon.</p>
<p>Thank you, Susan.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Next question.</p>
<p>Thank you, guys.</p>
<p>Over here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sunny line right here.</p>
<p>Yeah, we kept Antonio here for like two hours.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I feel bad.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to just take 14 to 20 more questions.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Sunny Lamba here.</p>
<p>Chamath&rsquo;s my favorite bestie.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>A little dry spell for you there, huh?</p>
<p>A little dry spell, huh?</p>
<p>A little dry spell, huh?</p>
<p>Because of him, I shop at Laura Piana only.</p>
<p>So, thank you.</p>
<p>So, I just got a question for Friedberg.</p>
<p>I know that you wanted to talk about this yesterday,</p>
<p>about this sort of consumer credit crisis on the horizon</p>
<p>that you see as potentially like the next shoe to drop.</p>
<p>So, I think you wanted to mention something yesterday</p>
<p>about it, but because of time and stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t have anything more to add</p>
<p>than what I said on the pod.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like, I don&rsquo;t think this is like a high certainty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just concerned.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of loans out there,</p>
<p>a lot of buy now, pay later,</p>
<p>a lot of stuff that has floating rates attached to it.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re going to have a recession,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to see job loss.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to see these,</p>
<p>and by the way, these auto loan portfolios</p>
<p>have like crazy outperformed over the last few years.</p>
<p>And a lot of those auto loans are floating rate.</p>
<p>Those asset values are inflated.</p>
<p>People are losing jobs.</p>
<p>You could see a bunch of these things</p>
<p>start to create a bit of a cascading effect</p>
<p>over the next couple quarters,</p>
<p>depending on how this all goes.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m not going to put my foot down on the ground</p>
<p>and say, oh my God, consumer credit bubble,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re totally fucked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to lead to the next great recession.</p>
<p>But I do think it&rsquo;s going to be pretty kind of surprising.</p>
<p>Buy now, pay later, I saw a stat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw this this week</p>
<p>on how a lot of the people</p>
<p>that are going on buy now, pay later sites</p>
<p>are actually maxed out on their credit cards.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re actually fully credited out.</p>
<p>And then all the smart algorithms are like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, you&rsquo;re a good credit risk.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s $1,800 to buy a fucking Peloton or whatever.</p>
<p>Lightning round.</p>
<p>Five questions and we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>One Bestie will answer each question.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>David Freeburger, my favorite Bestie.</p>
<p>What problem do you most want to solve right now?</p>
<p>Binary lifters, actually.</p>
<p>Edible quinoa.</p>
<p>Oh, actually, I&rsquo;ve been working on the&hellip;</p>
<p>So look, I&rsquo;ve spoken about this publicly.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>
<p>I was going to talk about it in the talk that we scrapped,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll do it another time,</p>
<p>which is really the opportunity for biomanufacturing</p>
<p>as a way to replace a lot of traditional food systems,</p>
<p>including all of ag, all of animal agriculture,</p>
<p>and a lot of the systems that we use</p>
<p>to basically make our food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big infrastructure play.</p>
<p>A couple square miles, using Elon&rsquo;s analogy,</p>
<p>you could basically recreate all the food on Earth.</p>
<p>You could distribute those systems.</p>
<p>And so I think that it can be extremely carbon negative.</p>
<p>It sucks carbon out of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It would create incredible jobs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible infrastructure opportunity.</p>
<p>It would return billions of acres of land</p>
<p>back to whatever form, natural form we want them to be.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an area that I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time in</p>
<p>and that I&rsquo;m particularly excited about.</p>
<p>Awesome, thank you.</p>
<p>Okay, number two.</p>
<p>Hi there, I&rsquo;m Katie Croft.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you all.</p>
<p>Imagine a parallel timeline</p>
<p>where I say you&rsquo;re all my favorite,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all true.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m curious, kind of an extension of the media question,</p>
<p>have you given much thought</p>
<p>to forming a consortium or community</p>
<p>with the All In podcast</p>
<p>and kind of what further applications of that?</p>
<p>Because if you think about the force multiplicity</p>
<p>of any number of these minds in the same room,</p>
<p>working towards the problems we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>from education to on-shoring energy,</p>
<p>it could probably be pretty considerable, the impact there.</p>
<p>Because we have such respect for what you guys do</p>
<p>and how you&rsquo;re doing it and the discourse you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re clearly all diehards here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just curious if you&rsquo;ve thought about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of trying to inception you here.</p>
<p>Jake Hill, you want to take that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a shit ton of work,</p>
<p>but I think it is, and we all have day jobs.</p>
<p>Step one was to try to just see,</p>
<p>and I told the besties,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just see if we can each make</p>
<p>getting to the pod each week a priority and a habit,</p>
<p>and that took the first year or so.</p>
<p>So now it is a habit.</p>
<p>We all value doing this.</p>
<p>It has had tremendous impact on our lives,</p>
<p>personally and professionally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been very inspiring for each of us.</p>
<p>So we had to lock into that first.</p>
<p>Doing this was a ton of work,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see if it&rsquo;s sustainable.</p>
<p>And we have some other ideas.</p>
<p>We wanted to do a college tour</p>
<p>was the other thing we were considering,</p>
<p>which would be like 3,000 seats or 4,000 seats,</p>
<p>and just an episode of the pod and Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>So I think that could be the next card to fall.</p>
<p>And then maybe hiring Tim Urban and Nate Silver</p>
<p>and then having them build a media company to take on CNN.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t really given it much thought,</p>
<p>but you never know.</p>
<p>They were here totally randomly.</p>
<p>They were here totally random.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not recruiting or anything,</p>
<p>but you know, anything&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Hi, besties again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Rejoice.</p>
<p>I run a talent marketplace for early entry workers.</p>
<p>We use gamification to accelerate their upscaling.</p>
<p>Yes, the question is about the great resignation,</p>
<p>which we believe is a half-told narrative.</p>
<p>So how can small businesses,</p>
<p>which are most sole proprietors,</p>
<p>democratize their own labor supply and demand?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>I think, again, as a supporter of capitalism,</p>
<p>I think one of the biggest things that we don&rsquo;t get right</p>
<p>is how money gets to the right problems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this roughly before,</p>
<p>but money is really just a voting way</p>
<p>of deciding what you think is important in the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the accumulation of money</p>
<p>as just a practical matter,</p>
<p>forget moral or philosophical,</p>
<p>is so important because you can vote what you want.</p>
<p>The thing is that aggregation happens easily.</p>
<p>Distribution is terribly broken.</p>
<p>And so the ability for folks to solve practical problems</p>
<p>is very hard because the ROI isn&rsquo;t obvious.</p>
<p>And getting money from capital pools like us</p>
<p>to individuals and sole proprietors is a basic,</p>
<p>I think it is a very broken problem.</p>
<p>A, because the systems don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>B, because the laws don&rsquo;t allow it.</p>
<p>And until that gets solved,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how a business</p>
<p>who can actually build for the future well</p>
<p>or solve their supply forecast or demand forecast</p>
<p>can actually get the capital you need</p>
<p>because the lubricant that allows you</p>
<p>to solve that problem is money.</p>
<p>Has always been, will always be.</p>
<p>But getting it to those people is legally hard</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s organizationally impractical.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw the last spot.</p>
<p>I mentioned this thing.</p>
<p>We tried this thing called capital as a service.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t get to the sole proprietor level,</p>
<p>but it gets to small five to 10% companies.</p>
<p>We would send $50,000, $100,000 checks.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how hard it is.</p>
<p>The cost of getting a $50,000 check,</p>
<p>we did this fishery in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It cost us $125,000 to give them $50,000.</p>
<p>We still did it because I just wanted to prove the point.</p>
<p>They ended up tripling our money,</p>
<p>so we barely kind of like broke even,</p>
<p>but it just goes to show you how really complicated.</p>
<p>Okay, fourth question and then one more after that.</p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m Prem.</p>
<p>As a Waterloo poker player, favorite besties Chamath.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very into next-gen manufacturing,</p>
<p>but as a pre-seed investor,</p>
<p>my concern is follow-on financing.</p>
<p>How do we get more investors interested</p>
<p>in investing in the physical world?</p>
<p>Because at least in Canada,</p>
<p>it seems like most investors only want to invest in software.</p>
<p>No, I think, this is what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a very broken part</p>
<p>of the capitalism right now,</p>
<p>which is that technology investors by and large,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean to disparage anyone here,</p>
<p>are not well-rooted in the principles of math and finance.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s a real problem</p>
<p>because in a moment like this,</p>
<p>that is where you can actually make</p>
<p>safe investments of capital.</p>
<p>You can structure the money in</p>
<p>so that you are capital-protected.</p>
<p>You have assets to back these things.</p>
<p>And the reason why folks don&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t understand how to put together a model</p>
<p>to demonstrate it,</p>
<p>and then the person that is then receiving that information</p>
<p>is unfortunately not as well-instructed as they should be</p>
<p>to understand how to make a decision from that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we have today.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit of a miseducation problem.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to affect the non-sexy areas.</p>
<p>Rockets will always get money,</p>
<p>but like 3D manufacturing at scale may not</p>
<p>because of this exact issue</p>
<p>because people don&rsquo;t know what ROIC means.</p>
<p>Sir, you have the final question.</p>
<p>Favorite bestie is Friedberg,</p>
<p>and hate to end on a recession question.</p>
<p>What a fucking question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never asking that question again.</p>
<p>Let me ask, why do you guys think it upsets you so much?</p>
<p>Well, because you&rsquo;re the biggest pain in the ass.</p>
<p>You are the most fucking neurotic person.</p>
<p>Every time we post an episode,</p>
<p>we should cancel the episode.</p>
<p>We fucked everything up again.</p>
<p>Why do we keep screwing up?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to destroy the pod.</p>
<p>I read the first nine comments,</p>
<p>and the downvote rate is 14%.</p>
<p>I was arguing somebody set the volume.</p>
<p>Well, keep going, but go ahead.</p>
<p>I mean, the amount of noise we deal with</p>
<p>from this one person.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like literally his inner monologue.</p>
<p>He does, but you should not reward him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like his inner monologue is crazy.</p>
<p>You know if you had a two-year-old child</p>
<p>who you&rsquo;ve given too much candy to,</p>
<p>is kicking and screaming.</p>
<p>Can you shut him up, please?</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>This is what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>If one guy can shut your mouth up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Phil Deutch, everyone.</p>
<p>It seems like a common theme on the stage</p>
<p>these last couple days is you all feel like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a recession or heading towards a recession,</p>
<p>but I get a feeling that you have the confidence</p>
<p>that this is going to be a quick recession, like a year.</p>
<p>So my question would be, why do you feel</p>
<p>after 13 years of market manipulation by the Fed</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to be cured in under a year?</p>
<p>No, I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The average recession has measured,</p>
<p>like if you look back historically, is two quarters.</p>
<p>The problem is that we&rsquo;ve never really figured out</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s going to take with the distortion</p>
<p>of money that never should have been in the system.</p>
<p>Because if you think of a supply-demand imbalance</p>
<p>as being a naturally self-balancing phenomenon,</p>
<p>if you perturb one side of it by an enormous amount,</p>
<p>exactly to your point, I think the open question</p>
<p>that the world has right now is,</p>
<p>is that really a two-quarter problem?</p>
<p>Well, the Fed has told you that they&rsquo;re going to take</p>
<p>three years to get three trillion.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard from David that 10 trillion was put in.</p>
<p>Probably another three or four trillion</p>
<p>was productively used.</p>
<p>But that still leaves another three trillion</p>
<p>of sloshing around money that we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s an open question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you guys think.</p>
<p>How many months?</p>
<p>How many quarters?</p>
<p>Sachs, how many quarters, if you had to guess?</p>
<p>Again, I just hate this definition of recession</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s about GDP decline when we had a lot</p>
<p>of the underlyings in those numbers for GDP</p>
<p>that I feel were artificially inflated</p>
<p>for a couple of quarters because of a bunch</p>
<p>of the structural stuff we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, if you look deeper at economic growth,</p>
<p>companies signing up more customers.</p>
<p>A lot of technology companies are about</p>
<p>increasing productivity with their tools,</p>
<p>with what they&rsquo;re selling.</p>
<p>And those businesses are gonna continue</p>
<p>to do well and to grow and to increase customers,</p>
<p>increase revenue, and I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s necessarily a lot of the structural stuff</p>
<p>that we saw with the GFC.</p>
<p>The one thing I am concerned about,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve highlighted, is this consumer credit risk.</p>
<p>And besides that, it seems like things are on good footing.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, the technical recession definition,</p>
<p>probably a couple quarters.</p>
<p>You never know, and I think the best way</p>
<p>to look at the future is by doing scenario planning.</p>
<p>So basically we could say this could be</p>
<p>a short, medium, or long recession.</p>
<p>Short would be six months, medium might be 18 months,</p>
<p>and long might be two years plus.</p>
<p>And we just say, I don&rsquo;t know, say 1 3rd, 1 3rd,</p>
<p>1 3rd probability, and that kind of gives you some picture.</p>
<p>14 months.</p>
<p>Exactly, so now what we&rsquo;re telling our portfolio companies</p>
<p>is you wanna have two and a half years of runway right now</p>
<p>because you gotta go raise six months</p>
<p>before you run out of cash,</p>
<p>and you really wanna have two years of cushion</p>
<p>because things could be choppy for two years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re gonna be, but they could be.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want your company to run out of money and die</p>
<p>just because of macroeconomic conditions</p>
<p>that are no fault of your own.</p>
<p>So if you can try to engineer that amount of runway,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>I also think that, here&rsquo;s the thing about a quick recession</p>
<p>is, or the prospect for one,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what other shoes are gonna drop.</p>
<p>Consumer credit is still a shoe</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna drop.</p>
<p>Look, six months ago, did we think we&rsquo;d be talking about</p>
<p>Tiger Global or Soffit for that matter,</p>
<p>potentially teetering on the verge of being</p>
<p>Wiped out?</p>
<p>Yeah, redempted out of business.</p>
<p>Or Coinbase and Peloton just withering to nothing.</p>
<p>Things can change fast.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what systemic risk is in the system</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t been flushed out yet.</p>
<p>And we won&rsquo;t be out of this until it feels like</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s been flushed out and then the market&rsquo;s back</p>
<p>and things are sort of on an upward trajectory again.</p>
<p>Clearly we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>Real estate and crypto,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t feel like that&rsquo;s rushed out yet either.</p>
<p>Do we have a clip to play as an outro?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, was this the cut clip?</p>
<p>Before we go, can we please say thanks</p>
<p>to the team that works here and the team,</p>
<p>Jason, your team at All In.</p>
<p>Incredible team.</p>
<p>Thanks everybody, all of you guys have worked so hard.</p>
<p>They really put a lot of effort into this,</p>
<p>pretty incredible.</p>
<p>I guess this is a lost clip of us from last week.</p>
<p>You did not have like a dungeon dragon sleepovers</p>
<p>in grade seven and grade eight?</p>
<p>I was actually programming Pascal</p>
<p>and we made a water moisturizer</p>
<p>and it was a binary lifter,</p>
<p>much like the ones you have on Tatooine.</p>
<p>To create a complete replica of Uncle Owen&rsquo;s</p>
<p>water vaporizers on Tatooine.</p>
<p>And that took six years, but it was great.</p>
<p>And then I went hilariously as C3PO.</p>
<p>I went as C3PO to our science fair.</p>
<p>You should have seen the look on our teacher&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>Okay, you guys have your cold open, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let your winter slide.</p>
<p>Rain man David Saks.</p>
<p>And instead we open sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m queen of Kinwan.</p>
