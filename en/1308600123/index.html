    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Gina Poe.</p>
<p>Dr. Gina Poe is a professor</p>
<p>in the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology</p>
<p>at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Her laboratory and research focuses on the relationship</p>
<p>between sleep and learning,</p>
<p>in particular, how specific patterns of brain activity</p>
<p>that are present during specific phases of sleep</p>
<p>impact our ability to learn</p>
<p>and remember specific types of information.</p>
<p>For instance, procedural information,</p>
<p>that is, how to perform specific cognitive</p>
<p>or physical tasks,</p>
<p>as well as encoding of emotional memories</p>
<p>and discarding emotional memories.</p>
<p>Indeed, her research focuses</p>
<p>on how specific phases of sleep</p>
<p>can act as its own form of trauma therapy,</p>
<p>discarding the emotional tones of memories.</p>
<p>In addition, her laboratory focuses</p>
<p>on how specific phases of sleep</p>
<p>impact things like the release of growth hormone.</p>
<p>Growth hormone, of course, plays critical roles</p>
<p>in metabolism and tissue repair,</p>
<p>including brain tissue repair,</p>
<p>and therefore has critical roles in vitality and longevity.</p>
<p>Today, you will learn many things</p>
<p>about the relationship between sleep, learning,</p>
<p>emotionality, and growth hormone.</p>
<p>One basic but very important takeaway</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll learn about today, which was news to me,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not just the duration</p>
<p>and depth of your sleep that matter,</p>
<p>but actually getting to sleep</p>
<p>at relatively the same time each night</p>
<p>ensures that you get adequate growth hormone release</p>
<p>in the first hours of sleep.</p>
<p>In fact, if you require, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>eight hours of sleep per night,</p>
<p>but you go to sleep two hours later</p>
<p>than your typical bedtime on any given night,</p>
<p>you actually miss the window for growth hormone release.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Getting growth hormone release in sleep,</p>
<p>which is absolutely critical</p>
<p>to our immediate and long-term health,</p>
<p>is not a prerequisite of getting sleep,</p>
<p>even if we are getting enough sleep.</p>
<p>As Dr. Poe explains,</p>
<p>there are critical brain circuits and endocrine,</p>
<p>that is hormone circuits,</p>
<p>that regulate not just the duration and depth</p>
<p>and quality and timing of sleep,</p>
<p>but when we place our bout of sleep,</p>
<p>that is when we go to sleep each night,</p>
<p>plus or minus about a half hour or so,</p>
<p>strongly dictates whether or not</p>
<p>we will experience all the health-promoting,</p>
<p>including mind-promoting benefits of sleep.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode covers that</p>
<p>and a lot more in substantial detail.</p>
<p>You will learn, for instance,</p>
<p>how to use sleep in order to optimize learning,</p>
<p>as well as forgetting for those things</p>
<p>that you would like to forget.</p>
<p>So during today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>Dr. Gina Poe shares critical information</p>
<p>about not just neuroscience,</p>
<p>but physiology and the hormone systems of the brain and body</p>
<p>that strongly inform mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>So by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be far more informed about sleep and how it works,</p>
<p>the different roles it performs,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have several new actionable steps</p>
<p>that you can take in order to improve your mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, the electrolytes are critical</p>
<p>to the function of every cell in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, the neurons, the nerve cells.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve talked about before on this podcast,</p>
<p>neurons, nerve cells, require adequate sodium and potassium,</p>
<p>as well as magnesium, in order to fire action potentials,</p>
<p>which are the electrical signals</p>
<p>that allow neurons to do everything</p>
<p>from generate focus and attention,</p>
<p>allow you to learn, and generate neuromuscular connection,</p>
<p>and allow you to exercise or train</p>
<p>or do any kind of skilled activity</p>
<p>with a high degree of output.</p>
<p>I take Element about two or three times per day,</p>
<p>typically once in the morning and again after</p>
<p>or during my bout of exercise each day,</p>
<p>and sometimes an additional one</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ve sat in a hot sauna and sweat a lot</p>
<p>or if the weather is very hot.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>to claim a free sample pack.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.</p>
<p>Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows</p>
<p>that are the absolute highest quality.</p>
<p>Sleep is the foundation of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>When we are sleeping well, all of those things excel.</p>
<p>And when we are not sleeping well,</p>
<p>all of those things suffer.</p>
<p>Now, the surface that you sleep on,</p>
<p>that is the mattress that you sleep on, is critical.</p>
<p>And Helix understands that everybody</p>
<p>has slightly different sleep needs.</p>
<p>So if you were to go to the Helix site,</p>
<p>which I invite you to do,</p>
<p>and take their brief two-minute quiz,</p>
<p>it will match your body type and sleep preferences</p>
<p>to the perfect mattress for you.</p>
<p>It will ask you questions, for instance,</p>
<p>do you sleep on your back, or your side, or your stomach?</p>
<p>Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?</p>
<p>Or maybe you don&rsquo;t know the answers to those questions.</p>
<p>I went and took the sleep quiz at Helix,</p>
<p>and it matched me to the so-called Dusk Mattress, D-U-S-K.</p>
<p>I started sleeping on Dusk Mattress over a year ago,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the best sleep that I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely transformed the depth and duration</p>
<p>and quality of my sleep in ways</p>
<p>that make me feel far better during the daytime.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by 8Sleep.</p>
<p>8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,</p>
<p>heating, and sleep tracking capacity.</p>
<p>Now, again, sleep is the foundation of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance,</p>
<p>but what many people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>is that in order to fall and stay asleep,</p>
<p>your core body temperature has to drop</p>
<p>by about one to three degrees.</p>
<p>Conversely, in order to wake up each morning</p>
<p>and feel refreshed, your body temperature</p>
<p>actually has to increase by one to three degrees.</p>
<p>Therefore, controlling the temperature</p>
<p>of your sleeping environment is absolutely key.</p>
<p>With 8Sleep, that&rsquo;s very easy to do.</p>
<p>Depending on whether or not you typically run too cold</p>
<p>or too hot during the night,</p>
<p>you can program your 8Sleep mattress cover</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s the optimal temperature,</p>
<p>not just for you, but for each phase,</p>
<p>the early, middle, and late phase of your sleep,</p>
<p>and for waking up in the morning.</p>
<p>In fact, you can even control the temperature</p>
<p>of your 8Sleep mattress cover</p>
<p>differentially across the mattress</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re sleeping alongside somebody else.</p>

<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Gina Poe.</p>
<p>Dr. Gina Poe, welcome.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really been looking forward to this conversation</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m familiar with your work,</p>
<p>and I know that many people are going to be excited</p>
<p>to learn about your work as it relates to sleep,</p>
<p>as it relates to problem solving, creativity,</p>
<p>addiction and craving, relapse,</p>
<p>and a number of other important topics.</p>
<p>So to start things off,</p>
<p>I would love for you to educate us a bit</p>
<p>about this thing that we are all familiar with,</p>
<p>and yet very few of us understand, which is sleep.</p>
<p>And if you would, could you describe the various phases</p>
<p>of sleep that exist, what distinguished them,</p>
<p>and perhaps frame this within the context</p>
<p>of what would a perfect night&rsquo;s sleep look like?</p>
<p>How long would it last, more or less?</p>
<p>And what would the biology look like?</p>
<p>What is a perfect night&rsquo;s sleep?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>All right, so sleep is really different from wakefulness,</p>
<p>and in fact, can&rsquo;t be replaced by any state of wakefulness</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been able to come up with so far.</p>
<p>Our brain chemistry is completely different,</p>
<p>and in the different stages of sleep,</p>
<p>which there is non-REM and REM,</p>
<p>are the two major states of sleep,</p>
<p>and every animal we&rsquo;ve studied so far</p>
<p>seems to have both of those states.</p>
<p>Anyway, those two states are entirely different</p>
<p>from one another, too.</p>
<p>And even within non-REM, there are three states.</p>
<p>Stage one, which is what you slip into</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re first falling asleep, it&rsquo;s dozing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of an interesting rhythm</p>
<p>that goes on in the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a fast gamma rhythm.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s stage two, which is a really cool state.</p>
<p>We sort of used to ignore sleep researchers</p>
<p>because it was a transient state between wakefulness</p>
<p>and the deep stage three slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>which is the most impressively different,</p>
<p>and between that and REM sleep.</p>
<p>So stage two, I&rsquo;ll talk a little bit more about.</p>
<p>And then the deep slow-wave sleep state,</p>
<p>which is when big slow waves sweep through our brain,</p>
<p>and now we realize that it cleans our brain.</p>
<p>One of the things that those big slow waves do</p>
<p>is cleans our brain and does other really important things</p>
<p>to restore us from a day of wakefulness.</p>
<p>And then REM sleep, which is the most popular</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where we have the most active dreams</p>
<p>and when you wake up someone out of REM sleep,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll almost always report having dreamed</p>
<p>something really bizarre.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>So those are the four states of sleep, of human sleep,</p>
<p>and we cycle through them every 90 minutes or so.</p>
<p>When we go to sleep, say 10, 10.30, 11 o&rsquo;clock,</p>
<p>our first REM sleep period comes about 105 minutes</p>
<p>after we fall asleep and lasts about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>It comes about 95 minutes and lasts 10 or 15 minutes.</p>
<p>And then we start over again,</p>
<p>and we have about five of those per night</p>
<p>for a perfect night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>four or five, something like that.</p>
<p>So a perfect night&rsquo;s sleep is seven and a half, eight hours.</p>
<p>There was a really great study that put people</p>
<p>in a semi-darkened room with nothing but the bed</p>
<p>for 12 hours every day for a month.</p>
<p>And what people did initially is,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re in a sleep-deprived nation,</p>
<p>is that they slept a lot more than usual,</p>
<p>like 10 or 11 hours of the 12.</p>
<p>And then they leveled off after a week or two</p>
<p>to about eight hours and 15 minutes of sleep.</p>
<p>So you actually can&rsquo;t oversleep.</p>
<p>I mean, they had nothing else to do but sleep,</p>
<p>and they would round off to, on average,</p>
<p>eight hours and 15 minutes a night,</p>
<p>and then they spend the rest of the time twiddling</p>
<p>their thumbs, humming tunes, daydreaming.</p>
<p>I want to get back to the contour of a perfect night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m intrigued by this idea that people can&rsquo;t oversleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often asked whether or not we can get too much sleep</p>
<p>and whether or not sleeping too long, excuse me,</p>
<p>can make us groggy the next day.</p>
<p>Is there anything to that?</p>
<p>And how does one determine how long they should sleep</p>
<p>on average?</p>
<p>On average, yeah, well, that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because different people need,</p>
<p>seem to need different amounts of sleep,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t really even know exactly what sleep is for.</p>
<p>So what they need is, you know,</p>
<p>kind of, it&rsquo;s, you know, murky.</p>
<p>So we do know a lot of things that sleep does now for us,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know how long those things take.</p>
<p>So how long we need to sleep</p>
<p>is also just a big question mark.</p>
<p>But some people don&rsquo;t feel rested</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;ve slept nine hours,</p>
<p>and some people don&rsquo;t feel rested</p>
<p>after three or four and a half.</p>
<p>But most people,</p>
<p>if they consistently deprive themselves of sleep</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re only sleeping</p>
<p>four, four and a half hours a night,</p>
<p>build up a cognitive deficit that just builds up over time.</p>
<p>The more nights you have with sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>the more cognitive deficit you have.</p>
<p>And so you need sleep, again, to sleep more to recover.</p>
<p>Now, the question you had about-</p>
<p>Can you oversleep?</p>
<p>Can you oversleep, right.</p>
<p>Can you sleep to the point where it&rsquo;s too much?</p>
<p>You know, that we, I, growing up when I was in high school,</p>
<p>my girlfriend&rsquo;s dad had this belief</p>
<p>that no one should sleep in past 6 a.m.</p>
<p>So he would wake all the,</p>
<p>there were two children in that home.</p>
<p>He would wake up the kids in that house.</p>
<p>He had this thing against oversleeping,</p>
<p>regardless of when people went to sleep.</p>
<p>And I always thought that was an interesting mentality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not terrible, actually,</p>
<p>because what that will do is it&rsquo;ll put you,</p>
<p>make you sleepier the next night to get to bed on time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll build up your homeostatic need</p>
<p>if you wake up too early.</p>
<p>But, so I don&rsquo;t think you can oversleep,</p>
<p>but people who sleep a lot,</p>
<p>like people who sleep over nine hours,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably indicative of some other problem</p>
<p>because, in fact, if you have a lot of different conditions,</p>
<p>it will cause you to sleep a lot more,</p>
<p>probably because what it does is it interferes</p>
<p>with your efficient sleep, the efficiency of your sleep.</p>
<p>So if you find yourself sleeping consistently</p>
<p>nine hours plus every night,</p>
<p>then you might want to consult a doctor</p>
<p>about maybe what else it might be.</p>
<p>It could be cancer.</p>
<p>It could be sleep apnea,</p>
<p>that just affects a lot of people.</p>
<p>It could be that your sleep is super inefficient</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re snoring a lot more than you know,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re waking up a lot more than you know every night.</p>
<p>So you might want to sleep study</p>
<p>just to see how your sleep is</p>
<p>and then see what else might be causing you to sleep so much.</p>
<p>And that wouldn&rsquo;t be if somebody is sleeping</p>
<p>nine or 10 hours, you know, every once in a while.</p>
<p>You mean if they&rsquo;re consistently sleeping</p>
<p>for more than nine hours.</p>
<p>If they feel like they need it</p>
<p>in order to function cognitively the next day,</p>
<p>it might be that your sleep is just not efficient</p>
<p>and you might want to look into why that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Forgive me for the anecdote, but I can&rsquo;t resist.</p>
<p>Years ago, I went to an acupuncturist</p>
<p>and he gave me these red pills</p>
<p>of which I don&rsquo;t know what they contained.</p>
<p>But I took them because he told me</p>
<p>they would help with my sleep.</p>
<p>And I would fall asleep about 30 minutes after taking them.</p>
<p>And I would have incredibly, excuse me, vivid dreams.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d wake up four or five hours</p>
<p>after having gone to sleep feeling completely rested.</p>
<p>Something that I&rsquo;ve never really experienced</p>
<p>on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>I want to do mass spec on these pills.</p>
<p>I still have no idea what was in them whatsoever.</p>
<p>I want to do mass spec on those pills too.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Some people thought that perhaps they had GHB,</p>
<p>gamma hydroxybutyrate, which is by the way,</p>
<p>an illegal drug, it can kill you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something you want to take.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>But anyway, if ever someone can figure out</p>
<p>what the red pills were, I&rsquo;ll be very-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really great.</p>
<p>And this is not a red pill of the other sort red pill.</p>
<p>This is just the red sleep pills.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, it could have been even a placebo effect</p>
<p>because placebo is extremely strong.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>there was really something to these red pills.</p>
<p>So shout out to the acupuncturists and the Eastern medicine.</p>
<p>But to return to this idea of the architecture</p>
<p>of a perfect night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>So you said we fall asleep,</p>
<p>the first 90 minutes of sleep, REM sleep,</p>
<p>rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>will arrive at about 95 minutes in.</p>
<p>Does that mean that the rest of that 90 minutes</p>
<p>is consumed with slow wave sleep?</p>
<p>Yeah, non-REM sleep.</p>
<p>Okay, and what about the sleep where we are lightly asleep</p>
<p>and we might have a dream that has us</p>
<p>somehow thinking about movement</p>
<p>or that we jolt ourselves awake?</p>
<p>That often happens early in the night, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the first stage, stage one</p>
<p>and stage two of sleep.</p>
<p>And stage two sleep is really cool</p>
<p>because that has something called sleep spindles</p>
<p>and K-complexes.</p>
<p>And what sleep spindles are a little bit of activity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 10 to 15 Hertz in frequency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a conversation between the thalamus and the cortex.</p>
<p>So the thalamus is the gateway to consciousness</p>
<p>and the neocortex processes all our cognition.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s these spindles, they&rsquo;re called sleep spindles.</p>
<p>And if you wake up out of that state,</p>
<p>you will often report a dream,</p>
<p>like a hallucination style dream.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be a long dream report</p>
<p>like you have out of REM sleep,</p>
<p>but it will be some hallucination state.</p>
<p>And during, while we&rsquo;re falling asleep,</p>
<p>one of the reasons we call it falling asleep</p>
<p>is because in stage one and stage two,</p>
<p>our muscles are relaxing.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s part of our brain that&rsquo;s conscious enough</p>
<p>to sort of recognize that relaxation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll feel like we&rsquo;re falling and we&rsquo;ll jerk awake.</p>
<p>So often that hallucination,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called hypnagogic hallucination,</p>
<p>will feel like it&rsquo;ll include some falling aspect</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll wake up out of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long felt that sensation</p>
<p>almost like dropping back into my head,</p>
<p>so much so that if I elevate my feet just slightly</p>
<p>and I tilt my head back just slightly</p>
<p>in order to go to sleep,</p>
<p>I find that I fall asleep much faster.</p>
<p>But it does feel as if I&rsquo;m gonna fall,</p>
<p>like almost gonna do a backwards somersault.</p>
<p>I actually really like the sensation</p>
<p>and usually because it precedes falling deeply asleep.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Somebody has to do a study of elevated feet.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a little bit on body position and sleep</p>
<p>and some of the washout that we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>So early in the night,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got these lighter stages of sleep,</p>
<p>less rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>What can we say about the dreams that occur</p>
<p>during the say first and second,</p>
<p>you know, 90 minute cycles of sleep?</p>
<p>Are they quite different than the patterns of sleep</p>
<p>and dreaming that occur later in the night</p>
<p>or toward morning?</p>
<p>Well, okay, that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of facets to it.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that the first four hours of sleep</p>
<p>are very important for memory processing.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you&rsquo;ve learned something new that day</p>
<p>or have experienced a new sensory motor experience,</p>
<p>then your early sleep dreams</p>
<p>will incorporate that experience</p>
<p>much more than the later sleep dreams.</p>
<p>Later is that memory gets consolidated</p>
<p>from the early structures,</p>
<p>which are the hippocampus deep in the temporal lobe</p>
<p>to the cortex in a distributed fashion.</p>
<p>That memory seems to move</p>
<p>from that hippocampus to the cortex</p>
<p>and also the dreams that incorporate that memory</p>
<p>also move later in the night.</p>
<p>So nobody knows why,</p>
<p>but there was a great study by Siddhartha Ribeiro</p>
<p>who studied the consolidation of memories</p>
<p>from the hippocampus to the cortex in a rat</p>
<p>across the period of a full day&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>because rats sleep in the daytime.</p>
<p>And he found that each subsequent REM sleep period</p>
<p>moved that memory from the hippocampus</p>
<p>to the first area that projects to it</p>
<p>and then the second area and then the third area.</p>
<p>And you can see the memory moving</p>
<p>throughout the sleep period.</p>
<p>Very cool, I have to read that study.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a number of different hormones</p>
<p>associated with the different stages of sleep.</p>
<p>We know that melatonin is a hormone of nighttime</p>
<p>that makes us sleepy.</p>
<p>What about growth hormone release?</p>
<p>When does that occur during sleep?</p>
<p>So growth hormone release happens all day long</p>
<p>and all night long,</p>
<p>but the deep slow-wave sleep that you get</p>
<p>the very first sleep cycle</p>
<p>is when you get a big bolus of growth hormone release</p>
<p>and in men and women equally.</p>
<p>And if you miss that first deep slow-wave sleep period,</p>
<p>you also miss that big bolus of growth hormone release.</p>
<p>And you might get ultimately across the day</p>
<p>just as much overall growth hormone release,</p>
<p>but endocrinologists will tell you that big boluses</p>
<p>do different things than a little bit eked out over time.</p>
<p>So that is when we know there&rsquo;s also a big push</p>
<p>to synthesize proteins.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when the protein synthesis part</p>
<p>that builds memories, for example, in our brain</p>
<p>happens in that first cycle of sleep.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to miss that,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;ve learned something really big</p>
<p>and needs more synaptic space to encode it.</p>
<p>How would somebody miss that first 90 minutes?</p>
<p>Sleep-depriving themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, so-</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say I normally go to sleep at 10 p.m.</p>
<p>And then from 10 to 11.30 would be this first phase of sleep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when the big bolus of growth hormone</p>
<p>would be released.</p>
<p>Does that mean that if I go to sleep instead</p>
<p>at 11.30 or midnight that I miss that first phase of sleep?</p>
<p>Why is it not the case that I get that first phase of sleep</p>
<p>just simply starting later?</p>
<p>It is a beautiful clock that we have in our body</p>
<p>that knows when things should happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s every cell in our body has a clock</p>
<p>and all of those clocks are normally synchronized</p>
<p>and the circadian clocks are synchronized.</p>
<p>And so our cells are ready to respond</p>
<p>to that growth hormone release at a particular time.</p>
<p>And if we miss it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a time in relation to melatonin also,</p>
<p>so if you miss it,</p>
<p>yeah, you might get some growth hormone release,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s occurring at a time when your clock</p>
<p>has already moved to the next phase.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just a clock thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think we can overstate the importance</p>
<p>of what you just described.</p>
<p>And to be honest,</p>
<p>despite knowing a bit about the sleep research</p>
<p>and circadian biology,</p>
<p>this is the very first time that I&rsquo;ve ever heard this,</p>
<p>that if you normally go to sleep at a particular time</p>
<p>and growth hormone is released in that first phase of sleep,</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t simply initiate your sleep bout later</p>
<p>and expect to capture that first phase of sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible and I think important.</p>
<p>And as many listeners are probably realizing</p>
<p>also highly actionable.</p>
<p>So what this means is that we should have</p>
<p>fairly consistent bedtimes</p>
<p>in addition to fairly consistent wake times.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Exactly, and in fact,</p>
<p>one of the best markers of good neurological health</p>
<p>when we get older is consistent bedtimes.</p>
<p>Wow, okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to backtrack,</p>
<p>but I did write down something that I think</p>
<p>is important for me to resolve or for you to resolve.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to ask this,</p>
<p>people that sleep nine hours or more,</p>
<p>perhaps that reflecting an issue,</p>
<p>some underlying issue perhaps,</p>
<p>is being a teenager or an adolescent</p>
<p>and undergoing a stage of development</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of bodily and brain growth,</p>
<p>an exception to that,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t recall sleeping a ton when I was a teenager.</p>
<p>I had a ton of energy,</p>
<p>but I know a few teenagers and they sleep a lot.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ll just sleep and sleep and sleep and sleep.</p>
<p>Should we let them sleep and sleep and sleep?</p>
<p>Let them sleep.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s the one exception.</p>
<p>What about us?</p>
<p>Just like babies.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re developing something in your brain</p>
<p>or the rest of your body,</p>
<p>you really need sleep to help organize that.</p>
<p>I mean, sleep is doing really hard work</p>
<p>in organizing our brains and making it develop right.</p>
<p>And if we deprive ourselves of sleep,</p>
<p>we will actually also just like I said,</p>
<p>we have a daily clock.</p>
<p>We also have a developmental clock</p>
<p>and we can miss a developmental window</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t let ourselves sleep extra like we need to.</p>
<p>What other things inhibit growth hormone release</p>
<p>or other components of this first stage of sleep?</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>if I go to sleep religiously every night at 10 p.m.,</p>
<p>are there things that I perhaps do in the preceding hours</p>
<p>or the preceding day,</p>
<p>like ingest caffeine or alcohol</p>
<p>that can make that first stage of sleep less effective,</p>
<p>even if I&rsquo;m going to sleep at the same time?</p>
<p>Alcohol definitely will do that</p>
<p>because alcohol is a REM sleep suppressant</p>
<p>and it even suppresses some of that stage two</p>
<p>transition to REM with those sleep spindles.</p>
<p>And those sleep spindles,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t talk about their function yet,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re really important for moving memories</p>
<p>to our cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a unique time when our hippocampus,</p>
<p>the sort of like the REM of our brains,</p>
<p>writes it to a hard disk,</p>
<p>which is the cortex.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a unique time when they&rsquo;re connected.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t want to miss that,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to miss REM sleep</p>
<p>when it is also a part of the consolidation process</p>
<p>and schema changing process.</p>
<p>And alcohol in there,</p>
<p>before we go to sleep, we&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>Until we&rsquo;ve metabolized alcohol</p>
<p>and put it out of our bodies,</p>
<p>it will affect our sleep badly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably fair to say no ingestion of alcohol</p>
<p>within the four to six hours preceding sleep,</p>
<p>given the half-life or at all would be better.</p>
<p>But I know some people refuse to go that way.</p>
<p>Maybe a little bit is okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the dose response is,</p>
<p>but there are studies out there you can look at.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re still in the first stage of sleep</p>
<p>and I apologize for slowing us down,</p>
<p>but it sounds like it&rsquo;s an incredibly important</p>
<p>first phase of sleep.</p>
<p>What about the second and third 90 minute blocks of sleep?</p>
<p>Is there anything that makes those unique?</p>
<p>What is their signature,</p>
<p>besides the fact that they come second and third</p>
<p>in the night?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more and more REM sleep,</p>
<p>the later the night we get.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a change in hormones,</p>
<p>the growth hormone and melatonin levels</p>
<p>are starting to decline,</p>
<p>but other hormones are picking up.</p>
<p>So it is a really different stage</p>
<p>that you also don&rsquo;t want to shortchange yourself on.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the stage,</p>
<p>many studies are showing that those are the times in sleep</p>
<p>when the most creativity can happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when our dreams can incorporate</p>
<p>and put together old and new things together</p>
<p>into a new way.</p>
<p>And our schema are built during that time.</p>
<p>So yeah, we can change our minds best</p>
<p>during those phases of sleep.</p>
<p>Could you elaborate a little bit more on schema?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone on this podcast</p>
<p>has ever discussed schema.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit familiar with schema</p>
<p>from my courses on psychology,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>So maybe if you could just refresh mine</p>
<p>and everyone else&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a concept.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>How do you define schema?</p>
<p>I think of schema as,</p>
<p>like we have a schema of Christmas, right?</p>
<p>We have all kinds of ideas that we sew together</p>
<p>and call Christmas,</p>
<p>a holiday season in the Northern hemisphere, it&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p>We have Santa Claus and reindeer and jingle bells</p>
<p>and even things that are false,</p>
<p>but we normally associate with Christmas presents,</p>
<p>family gathering, when it is,</p>
<p>all of this stuff is sewn together into one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thread linking them all.</p>
<p>Linking them all.</p>
<p>And we can just give ourselves a list of words</p>
<p>and none of them contain the word Christmas.</p>
<p>And then ask people later,</p>
<p>give them another list of words</p>
<p>and include the word Christmas.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, oh yeah, that word was there.</p>
<p>Because in their minds,</p>
<p>they brought up that word Christmas</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s part of that whole schema.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what, it&rsquo;s sort of a related,</p>
<p>a lot of related concepts, I guess.</p>
<p>Can I think about it sort of like</p>
<p>the desktop of my computer</p>
<p>that would scare some people,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just a ton of folders.</p>
<p>But each of the folder names means something</p>
<p>very clear and specific to me.</p>
<p>And inside of those folders are collections of things</p>
<p>that make sense in terms of how they&rsquo;re batched.</p>
<p>Is that one way to think about it?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a great way to think of it.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re in REM sleep in the later parts of the night</p>
<p>and that transition to REM,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when your computer of your brain</p>
<p>is opening folders and comparing documents,</p>
<p>seeing if there, is there anything the same?</p>
<p>These two documents look very much the same,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a little bit of difference</p>
<p>and it can link those conceptually</p>
<p>so that that&rsquo;s probably one of the origins of creativity</p>
<p>is finding things that are related,</p>
<p>maybe just linked a little bit</p>
<p>and you can find that link and strengthen it</p>
<p>if it makes your schema interesting and different.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Many people, including myself,</p>
<p>tend to wake up maybe once during the middle of the night</p>
<p>to use the restroom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to drink less fluid before going to sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard also that the impulse to urinate,</p>
<p>forgive the topic, but a lot of people deal with this.</p>
<p>So the impulse to urinate is also dictated</p>
<p>by how quickly you drink fluid,</p>
<p>not just the total volume.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve switched to sipping fluids more slowly</p>
<p>for my last beverage of the day, which seems to help.</p>
<p>But the point here is that I think a lot of people</p>
<p>wake up once in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>oftentimes to use the restroom,</p>
<p>but oftentimes just around 3 a.m.</p>
<p>and might be up for a few minutes,</p>
<p>hopefully not on their phone or viewing any bright light,</p>
<p>which can cause more wakefulness,</p>
<p>but then go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Is there any known detriment</p>
<p>to this middle of the night waking,</p>
<p>or should we consider it a normal feature</p>
<p>for some people&rsquo;s sleep architecture?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we shouldn&rsquo;t worry about it, actually.</p>
<p>I think sleep is really incredibly well</p>
<p>homeostatically regulated.</p>
<p>And so really don&rsquo;t worry about how much you&rsquo;re sleeping,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not intentionally depriving yourself</p>
<p>of sleep by doing something really rewarding and exciting,</p>
<p>because even that is stressful to your body</p>
<p>and deprives you of a lot of the things we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely normal to wake up</p>
<p>at least once in the middle of the night</p>
<p>to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>And as long as you can get back to sleep</p>
<p>in a reasonable amount of time,</p>
<p>or even if it takes you an hour, don&rsquo;t worry about it,</p>
<p>as long as you have a lifestyle</p>
<p>that allows you to then make up that sleep</p>
<p>either the next morning or the next night,</p>
<p>or going to bed a little earlier.</p>
<p>So if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit of asymmetry to sleep,</p>
<p>that catching that first phase of sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you either get it or you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and you have to get it by going to sleep</p>
<p>essentially the same time each night,</p>
<p>maybe plus or minus 15 minutes or so.</p>
<p>But then if I wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and go back to sleep, I can not catch up,</p>
<p>but I can gather all the sleep that I would have gotten</p>
<p>had I just slept the whole way through the night.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know actually the answer</p>
<p>to whether or not the sleep in the middle</p>
<p>between that early sleep and the late sleep</p>
<p>is in fact different for another reason,</p>
<p>and whether depriving yourself of sleep</p>
<p>from say one to 2.30 in the morning</p>
<p>is bad in a different way, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose I am the experiment in that case</p>
<p>because I do tend to wake up once per night</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve sort of come to recognize it</p>
<p>as part of my normal sleep architecture.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t obsess over it.</p>
<p>I do notice that when I go back to sleep</p>
<p>and especially toward morning,</p>
<p>that my sleep is incredibly deep.</p>
<p>My dreams are incredibly vivid.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t always remember them,</p>
<p>but what is unique perhaps about the architecture of dreams</p>
<p>and sleep in the, let&rsquo;s say the last third of the night</p>
<p>or the second half of the night?</p>
<p>Right, yeah, in the second half of the night,</p>
<p>we have longer REM sleep periods,</p>
<p>and those are considered the deepest sleep,</p>
<p>even though slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>big slow wave is considered deep, it is deep.</p>
<p>Yeah, they call slow wave sleep deep sleep</p>
<p>and REM sleep rapid eye movement,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re telling me that REM sleep</p>
<p>is actually the deeper sleep.</p>
<p>Okay, there needs to be a new nomenclature</p>
<p>of sleep researchers.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, you really shouldn&rsquo;t call it deep or not.</p>
<p>No, no, please.</p>
<p>The reason why you call slow wave sleep deep sleep</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s difficult to arouse people</p>
<p>out of that state.</p>
<p>And when you do arouse them out of that state,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re most often confused</p>
<p>and just want to go back into sleep</p>
<p>and can go back pretty easily.</p>
<p>If you arouse someone out of REM sleep,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more likely to report something</p>
<p>that was really kind of almost like wakefulness.</p>
<p>It was so vivid.</p>
<p>But in fact, if you give someone</p>
<p>a non-threatening kind of stimulation,</p>
<p>like somebody dropping keys</p>
<p>or a ping or something like that,</p>
<p>instead of waking,</p>
<p>that same volume will wake someone up</p>
<p>out of non-REM sleep,</p>
<p>but out of REM sleep and instead lengthen</p>
<p>the amount of time or make it even more dense,</p>
<p>your rapid eye movement&rsquo;s more dense.</p>
<p>And often people will incorporate</p>
<p>that sound into their dreams.</p>
<p>So the body and brain are somehow conscious</p>
<p>of the sound, and I&rsquo;ve heard also smells</p>
<p>can even make it into our dreams in REM sleep,</p>
<p>but that it doesn&rsquo;t arouse us from sleep.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t arouse us as often, yeah.</p>
<p>And maybe one of the reasons why REM sleep is deeper</p>
<p>is especially in adults and older people,</p>
<p>that deep slow wave sleep goes away.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not as deep, it&rsquo;s not as big.</p>
<p>The slow waves aren&rsquo;t as large,</p>
<p>which is probably problematic, but we&rsquo;re not sure.</p>
<p>And so then REM sleep becomes the deepest stage.</p>
<p>Actually in children, it&rsquo;s kind of a toss up</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really hard to wake them up</p>
<p>out of that deep slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>And in fact, fire alarms don&rsquo;t wake them up,</p>
<p>even really loud fire alarms out of that state of sleep.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re trying to change fire alarms</p>
<p>so that instead of something</p>
<p>that the kids don&rsquo;t associate with anything,</p>
<p>like the rrr, rrr, whatever, they don&rsquo;t associate with,</p>
<p>it says their name or something else</p>
<p>that may be less loud, but more salient to them,</p>
<p>and will wake them up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, having carried sleeping children</p>
<p>in from the car, I don&rsquo;t know that I want children</p>
<p>to start waking up from sleep,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s one of the best things when you get home</p>
<p>and the kids are asleep in the backseat,</p>
<p>you can literally throw them over your shoulder,</p>
<p>gently, of course, and put them to sleep,</p>
<p>and they are completely out.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>It is wonderful.</p>
<p>One of nature&rsquo;s gifts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day,</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>So this enhanced volume or proportion</p>
<p>of rapid eye movement sleep in the second half of the night</p>
<p>relates to more elaborate dreams.</p>
<p>We are paralyzed during REM sleep, correct?</p>
<p>Yes, normally paralyzed, and that&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the time</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re actively dreaming storyline dreams</p>
<p>and we could hurt ourselves.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually really cut off from the outside world</p>
<p>in terms of responding to, say, this table</p>
<p>or a window or a door.</p>
<p>And so different from sleepwalking,</p>
<p>which is out of slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>and out of slow-wave sleep, that sleepwalking</p>
<p>is a mixture between sleep and wakefulness.</p>
<p>So you actually will respond to the door.</p>
<p>You can cook a full meal, drive your car</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re in deep slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary because you never know what you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have voluntary control over it.</p>
<p>You have no conscious control over it,</p>
<p>but you can actually safely navigate some situations</p>
<p>in sleepwalking and actually have a conversation,</p>
<p>although it may not make much sense</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sleep-talking.</p>
<p>In REM sleep, you&rsquo;re not processing the outside world.</p>
<p>And instead, when you&rsquo;re acting out your dreams,</p>
<p>you could be doing things like walking</p>
<p>through a plate glass window</p>
<p>or falling off of, down the stairs, things like that.</p>
<p>So you really want your muscles</p>
<p>to be inactivated during REM sleep.</p>
<p>Otherwise you will act out those dreams</p>
<p>and really hurt yourself or your bed partner.</p>
<p>What about sleep-talking or talking in sleep?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many relationships</p>
<p>have been saved by sleep-talking,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing a few have been destroyed.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m guessing that talking in sleep could have meaning</p>
<p>or perhaps has no meaning,</p>
<p>just as dreams could have meaning or no meaning,</p>
<p>as we recall them.</p>
<p>Yeah, do not take sleep-talking seriously.</p>
<p>No matter what people say,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily reflect truth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re being more truthful</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sleep-talking.</p>
<p>You just saved a number of relationships.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not directing this at anyone in particular,</p>
<p>but I guarantee you just did.</p>
<p>Noted.</p>
<p>So as people start to approach morning</p>
<p>or the time when they normally would wake up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that it&rsquo;s important to, if possible,</p>
<p>complete one of these 90-minute cycles prior to waking up.</p>
<p>That is, if you set your alarm</p>
<p>for halfway through one of these 90-minute cycles</p>
<p>that come late in the night of sleep,</p>
<p>that it can lead to rather groggy patterns of waking.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just ask you directly, do you use an alarm clock?</p>
<p>I do not.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I&rsquo;m in a line of work</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require me normally</p>
<p>to do anything at any particular time.</p>
<p>I do it when I do it, unless I have to catch a plane,</p>
<p>and then I always set my alarm, just in case.</p>
<p>Well, as a fellow academic, I can tell you</p>
<p>there are plenty of punishing features</p>
<p>about being an academic scientist</p>
<p>that offset the fact that you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to use an alarm clock,</p>
<p>but it is nice that you can often set your own schedule.</p>
<p>So would you recommend that, if possible,</p>
<p>that people not use an alarm clock?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>If you can just listen to your body and wake up</p>
<p>when you need to wake up, that would be great.</p>
<p>But one of the reasons why we have such a grogginess,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called sleep inertia,</p>
<p>when we wake up out of the wrong state,</p>
<p>which is deep slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>is because I liken it to like a washing machine cycle.</p>
<p>This 90-minute cycle is like a washing machine cycle.</p>
<p>And the first part is to add water, right?</p>
<p>And then your clothes are soaking wet.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna open the washing machine</p>
<p>and try and function, put them on and wear them around</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re soaking wet and full of soap.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have to wait until the cycle is through</p>
<p>before you can, well, actually,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put it in the dryer too,</p>
<p>before you wanna wear them.</p>
<p>So yeah, you can function.</p>
<p>It just takes a little while for those clothes,</p>
<p>that brain to dry out so you can actually function well.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s better to wait through the whole cycle is complete.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why you want to set</p>
<p>that 90-minute alarm clock.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s around 90 minutes</p>
<p>because the first stage of sleep,</p>
<p>the first cycle of sleep is actually a little longer,</p>
<p>more like 105, 110 minutes,</p>
<p>but then the second ones and third ones,</p>
<p>they get sort of shorter and shorter as the night goes on.</p>
<p>And in the last few cycles,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just doing the N2 REM sleep cycle,</p>
<p>which takes less time.</p>
<p>And if you wake up out of REM sleep,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s usually no problem cognitively.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<p>Are you a fan of sleep trackers?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you use one?</p>
<p>I have one on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t live my life by them</p>
<p>because they are,</p>
<p>the best ones right now are about 70% effective</p>
<p>at staging your sleep.</p>
<p>So 70%, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay, but take it with a grain of salt</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve tried various ones</p>
<p>and I compare the mattress-based one to a,</p>
<p>I actually wear it on my ankle instead of my wrist,</p>
<p>but, and I do find it informative,</p>
<p>but a colleague of mine at Stanford,</p>
<p>Ali Crum, who works on mindset and belief effects,</p>
<p>talked to me about a study they did</p>
<p>where people often will bias</p>
<p>their sense of daytime wakefulness</p>
<p>based on their sleep score</p>
<p>more than their subjective score.</p>
<p>In other words, if they were told</p>
<p>they got a poor night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>even if they got a great night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>and this was of course measured in the sleep lab,</p>
<p>so they were able to compare,</p>
<p>people report feeling more groggy.</p>
<p>And the opposite is also true,</p>
<p>that if it says 100% or 90% on your sleep score,</p>
<p>then people go, oh, I feel great,</p>
<p>even though they might not have slept well.</p>
<p>So this speaks to the,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say placebo effect,</p>
<p>but the sort of belief effects</p>
<p>that are woven in with a score.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that combining</p>
<p>subjective and objective data is probably best.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I do believe</p>
<p>that you should trust your own physiology</p>
<p>and the way that your body is telling you to feel,</p>
<p>because in fact, it used to be</p>
<p>that people with insomnia were often not believed</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d put them in a sleep lab</p>
<p>and they look like they slept great</p>
<p>and you wake them up in the morning,</p>
<p>they say, oh, I didn&rsquo;t sleep very well at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because probably we just came out</p>
<p>with a paper that shows that subcortical structures</p>
<p>can be in a completely different sleep state</p>
<p>than cortical structures,</p>
<p>which is what we measure in the sleep lab,</p>
<p>what the cortex is doing.</p>
<p>So it might be that people who say,</p>
<p>I did not sleep all night long,</p>
<p>even though the cortex is saying,</p>
<p>oh no, you had great sleep,</p>
<p>was because they&rsquo;re monitoring their subcortical</p>
<p>hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus,</p>
<p>other structures that the sleep lab just can&rsquo;t access</p>
<p>unless you have depth electrodes,</p>
<p>which nobody really wants.</p>
<p>Right, because that requires holes in the skull</p>
<p>and wires.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow, so does that mean that the last 50 plus years</p>
<p>of sleep science, it&rsquo;s potentially flawed in some way</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re only recording from,</p>
<p>I guess this would be the analogy would be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like recording from the surface of the ocean</p>
<p>as opposed to the depth of the ocean.</p>
<p>And trying to ascertain the life moving down deep</p>
<p>in the depth of the ocean.</p>
<p>Brace yourselves, colleagues at Stanford Sleep Lab</p>
<p>and elsewhere, but please just tell us,</p>
<p>because I think scientists want to know the truth.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s not for nothing</p>
<p>that you want to know what the cortex is doing.</p>
<p>I mean, the cortex is really important for a lot of things,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily tell you</p>
<p>what a lot of other really important parts of the brain</p>
<p>are doing in terms of sleep.</p>
<p>And, but there&rsquo;s hope because in fact, it would be great.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s possible from the paper, if you look at it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in PNAS this year,</p>
<p>that you could detect subtle changes in the cortical EEG</p>
<p>that might be able to tell you</p>
<p>what the subcortical structures are doing.</p>
<p>Things like the absolute power in that sleep spindle band,</p>
<p>that sigma band would change</p>
<p>if the hippocampus is in REM sleep</p>
<p>and the cortex is in that sleep spindle state</p>
<p>and vice versa.</p>
<p>So there is some hope that we can gain</p>
<p>from people with depth electrodes</p>
<p>or animals with depth electrodes</p>
<p>that we could backwards machine learn</p>
<p>what the cortex might be able to tell us</p>
<p>about subcortical structures from the cortical EEG, so.</p>
<p>Interesting, this is going to be a stimulus.</p>
<p>Yes, stay tuned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a stimulus</p>
<p>for development of new technology,</p>
<p>which is always going to assist in scientific discovery.</p>
<p>One more thing I wanted to ask about</p>
<p>the architecture of the night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>in terms of early part of the night.</p>
<p>Earlier, you mentioned the washout of debris</p>
<p>and the so-called glymphatic system,</p>
<p>I think is what you&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>Could you tell us a little bit more about the washout</p>
<p>that occurs in the brain during sleep,</p>
<p>what that is and what roles it&rsquo;s thought to serve</p>
<p>and perhaps if there are any ways to ensure that it happens</p>
<p>or to ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>and obviously we want this to happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>All right, great question.</p>
<p>We talked about the circadian clock</p>
<p>and how certain things happen at certain times.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things that happens when we&rsquo;re awake</p>
<p>and talking to each other</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a lot of plasticity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m learning from you today</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re learning from me</p>
<p>and that changes our synapses</p>
<p>and it changes the way our proteins</p>
<p>are going to be folded and changed during sleep.</p>
<p>It unfolds.</p>
<p>This process actually uses a lot of ATP,</p>
<p>the power structure, the fuel of the brain</p>
<p>and it unfolds also proteins while we&rsquo;re doing this,</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re using them</p>
<p>and so during that first part of the night,</p>
<p>when we first fall asleep in the first 20 minutes or so,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re building that adenosine back into ATP</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably why power naps are called power naps</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re actually rebuilding the power</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re also cleaning out</p>
<p>through the deep slow waves of sleep,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re cleaning out all those misfolded proteins,</p>
<p>unfolded proteins and other things that get broken down</p>
<p>and need to be rebuilt when we&rsquo;re asleep</p>
<p>because of its use during wakefulness.</p>
<p>So I liken that to having a big party during wakefulness</p>
<p>and you need all those party goers to leave</p>
<p>in order to do the cleanup</p>
<p>and so what I think the mechanism is</p>
<p>and this is still something to be tested</p>
<p>is actually slow waves themselves,</p>
<p>which is bad news for us as we get older</p>
<p>and those slow waves get smaller</p>
<p>and slowly sleep goes away.</p>
<p>So what happens when a neuron is firing</p>
<p>is that it expands, the membrane expands a little bit,</p>
<p>it becomes more translucent, that&rsquo;s how we know,</p>
<p>one of the ways we know that neurons expand when they fire</p>
<p>and so every action potential,</p>
<p>the membrane expands a little bit</p>
<p>as sodium brings water into the cell</p>
<p>and then when they&rsquo;re silent, they contract</p>
<p>and so in during slow waves,</p>
<p>the cool thing is that the reason why you can measure them</p>
<p>is that all the neurons at the same time,</p>
<p>not all of them but a good portion of them</p>
<p>are firing at the same time and silent at the same time</p>
<p>and so you think about that as contracting</p>
<p>and expanding all at the same time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a bilge pump of the brain</p>
<p>so that can pump out,</p>
<p>glia are also really important for this</p>
<p>in terms of cleaning up debris</p>
<p>and transferring it to where it needs to go</p>
<p>so I think of it actually as a bilge pump,</p>
<p>cleaning out our brain.</p>
<p>Interesting, I&rsquo;ve heard about the glymphatic system</p>
<p>and the lymphatic washout,</p>
<p>I had never thought about the mechanical aspects</p>
<p>of it before.</p>
<p>I always thought that for some reason</p>
<p>that now it&rsquo;s obvious to me</p>
<p>that there had to be something mechanical</p>
<p>but only now that you&rsquo;ve educated me about this,</p>
<p>I thought that for some reason,</p>
<p>the cerebral spinal fluid just starts washing through</p>
<p>but here you&rsquo;re talking about literally an expansion</p>
<p>and a contraction of the neurons in unison</p>
<p>and pushing the fluid through,</p>
<p>cleaning out any misfolded proteins</p>
<p>or debris that might occur</p>
<p>on the basis of these metabolic pathways</p>
<p>and the consequence of that is to what?</p>
<p>To leave the brain in a state of more pristine action</p>
<p>for the next day, is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, you think of it again like a party</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t clean up after that party</p>
<p>and you try and hold another one the next day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna get more clogged,</p>
<p>people have a harder time moving around</p>
<p>and enjoying themselves</p>
<p>and if that builds up day after day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be cognition,</p>
<p>that would be the party goers moving around,</p>
<p>becomes hard, yeah.</p>
<p>And so this build pump that you describe</p>
<p>is associated with the big slow waves of deep,</p>
<p>well, of slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>So this is gonna occur more or less</p>
<p>in the first third of the night, is that right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And are there things that inhibit this process</p>
<p>and are there things that facilitate this process?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, well, one thing to inhibit is not to get it,</p>
<p>but-</p>
<p>Right, and here too, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but, and is this similar to the case with growth hormone</p>
<p>where if you go to sleep later than you would normally,</p>
<p>you miss the washout, you don&rsquo;t delay it,</p>
<p>you miss the washout.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, so if you go to sleep</p>
<p>at one or two in the morning,</p>
<p>your sleep is still gonna be dominated</p>
<p>by N2 and REM sleep, not by slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>So you need to get that first bit of sleep.</p>
<p>Would a caveat to that be,</p>
<p>if somebody normally goes to sleep at one or 2 a.m.</p>
<p>and wakes up at 10 a.m.,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s their normal sleep cycle-</p>
<p>Yeah, that should be okay.</p>
<p>It should be okay.</p>
<p>You would probably wanna do,</p>
<p>somebody would wanna do a sleep study</p>
<p>with people who do that normally</p>
<p>and see if also the melatonin releases later</p>
<p>and the corticosterone rise</p>
<p>that happens normally in the morning</p>
<p>and that also happens later.</p>
<p>So if everything shifted, good.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, there are a few studies I&rsquo;ve come across</p>
<p>that really do argue for the fact</p>
<p>that waking up circa sunrise,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean at sunrise,</p>
<p>but within an hour or two, maybe three hours of sunrise,</p>
<p>and going to sleep within four hours after sunset or so</p>
<p>is actually better for the health of all human beings</p>
<p>than is being a night owl.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost like a night owl posse out there,</p>
<p>especially on social media.</p>
<p>They get very upset when you say</p>
<p>that you should see morning sunlight,</p>
<p>that after 10 a.m. you kind of miss the boat,</p>
<p>and they get very upset</p>
<p>because I think there are about 20 or 30% of people,</p>
<p>perhaps, who really feel like they function better</p>
<p>staying up late and waking up late</p>
<p>and they function much less well waking up early</p>
<p>and going to bed early.</p>
<p>But the data on health metrics</p>
<p>suggests that, sorry, night owls, that they are wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry me, because I&rsquo;m a night owl.</p>
<p>Oh boy, okay, well then I&rsquo;m apologizing directly.</p>
<p>And here, I&rsquo;m not a really early morning person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of more typical.</p>
<p>If I wake up naturally around 6.30,</p>
<p>somewhere between 6.30 and 7.30 a.m.,</p>
<p>go to sleep somewhere between 10 and 11 p.m.</p>
<p>These are averages.</p>
<p>But I do notice that when I force myself</p>
<p>to get up a little earlier and go to sleep a little earlier,</p>
<p>that my mood and alertness</p>
<p>and just overall productivity is much higher.</p>
<p>And there could be other variables there, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a night owl.</p>
<p>I love staying up late at night, writing grants,</p>
<p>writing papers, watching movies, whatever it is, I love it.</p>
<p>But I, like you, and like every human being on Earth,</p>
<p>do better if I go to bed earlier and wake up earlier.</p>
<p>So one good thing for night owls is to have a child,</p>
<p>because they will wake you up.</p>
<p>Their circadian rhythms are so strong, they will wake up.</p>
<p>And even if you deprive them of sleep</p>
<p>in the first half of the night,</p>
<p>they will still wake up like clockwork</p>
<p>because their circadian rhythms are so strong at 6.00 a.m.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t done anything good for your kid.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t moved their cycle to later</p>
<p>and be more in line with yours.</p>
<p>In fact, you&rsquo;ve just sleep deprived them</p>
<p>and made them miss a window</p>
<p>and made them cranky the next day</p>
<p>and made your life more miserable.</p>
<p>So go to bed soon after your kids go to bed</p>
<p>and wake up with them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way to do it.</p>
<p>Great, the child alarm clock,</p>
<p>another reason I have children.</p>
<p>I got a dog, a puppy,</p>
<p>and then that became a dog specifically,</p>
<p>well, for many reasons.</p>
<p>But one reason was I wanted to be one of those early morning</p>
<p>Raj, you know, 5.30 a.m. every morning.</p>
<p>But I ended up getting a bulldog that would literally sleep</p>
<p>16 hours if he could.</p>
<p>A nuclear bomb could go off and he wouldn&rsquo;t wake up.</p>
<p>But what I started to learn was that bulldogs</p>
<p>actually have sleep apnea.</p>
<p>As far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the only species that has a genetically,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re essentially an inbred sleep defect.</p>
<p>And so I actually don&rsquo;t encourage people to get bulldogs</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of a cruel breed.</p>
<p>They suffer a lot in that body that they&rsquo;re born into.</p>
<p>Anyway, a dog can accomplish some of this,</p>
<p>but get the breed of dog that is going to wake up early.</p>
<p>So in other words, don&rsquo;t get a bulldog or a mastiff.</p>
<p>Well, you know, interestingly all predatory animals</p>
<p>like dogs and cats and lions and us,</p>
<p>well, more dogs, cats, and lions than us,</p>
<p>wills can sleep, you know, 16 hours a day.</p>
<p>Ferrets are predatory.</p>
<p>They can sleep-</p>
<p>I had a pet ferret.</p>
<p>And sadly, I also used to work on ferrets,</p>
<p>publish a number of papers.</p>
<p>Delightful animals.</p>
<p>Yeah, and great because you can study development.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really cool because they&rsquo;re born very altricial</p>
<p>like we are with brains that are not very well developed.</p>
<p>And so you can see what happens through development</p>
<p>and how important these different phases</p>
<p>of development really are.</p>
<p>But yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe we&rsquo;re not as much predators as we think</p>
<p>because in fact, our sleep is somewhere between the prey</p>
<p>and the predators in terms of the amount of sleep</p>
<p>that we usually need a night.</p>
<p>But those predators can sleep 16 hours,</p>
<p>napping all day long,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re more crepuscular perhaps like their prey are</p>
<p>more-</p>
<p>So dawn and dusk active?</p>
<p>Yeah, dawn and dusk active.</p>
<p>Yeah, but anyway, yes.</p>
<p>Children and dogs.</p>
<p>Actually, there was a poll done</p>
<p>by the National Sleep Foundation</p>
<p>to see what the number one thing is</p>
<p>that wakes people up at night.</p>
<p>And number two is going to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Number three is children because, you know,</p>
<p>when your children are young,</p>
<p>but that only lasts a few years</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll wake you up when they&rsquo;re babies.</p>
<p>But the number one thing is pets</p>
<p>and pets needing to go out</p>
<p>or cats wanting to curl up with you or whatever it is,</p>
<p>pets needs will wake you up more</p>
<p>in the middle of the night than anything else.</p>
<p>Another reason to not get a nocturnal pet.</p>
<p>People who get hamsters pretty quickly realize</p>
<p>that they are nocturnal</p>
<p>and they want to run on their wheel around.</p>
<p>Yeah, you got to put them in the living room</p>
<p>away from where you sleep.</p>
<p>I vote fish tank, folks.</p>
<p>Freshwater fish tank.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of reasons to not get a saltwater tank.</p>
<p>Freshwater fish tank or a child.</p>
<p>I appreciate that vote.</p>
<p>And I appreciate you mentioning ferrets.</p>
<p>And by the way, folks, they are carnivores.</p>
<p>They are not rodents and they are,</p>
<p>they have very elaborate brain structures.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very smart in the same family</p>
<p>as the honey badgers and the other mustelids.</p>
<p>Anyway, I shouldn&rsquo;t geek out too much on the mustelids</p>
<p>or else I&rsquo;ll take the remainder of all our time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to tell us about REM sleep</p>
<p>and the sleep later in the night</p>
<p>as it relates to dreams and emotionality.</p>
<p>And this is probably the appropriate time</p>
<p>for you to introduce us to this incredible structure</p>
<p>in the brain, which is the locus coeruleus,</p>
<p>a difficult structure to spell,</p>
<p>but a beautifully named structure.</p>
<p>I find locus coeruleus to be just fascinating.</p>
<p>And I know a small fraction of what it does,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m hoping you&rsquo;re going to educate me</p>
<p>and our audience about more about what it does</p>
<p>and hopefully tell us a little bit about its relationship</p>
<p>to epinephrine, AKA adrenaline.</p>
<p>Yeah, I am so glad you brought this up</p>
<p>because I can totally geek out on the locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>Please do.</p>
<p>Locus meaning spot or place and coeruleus meaning blue.</p>
<p>So you could just call it the blue spot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the easiest.</p>
<p>Every animal with a brain has a blue spot.</p>
<p>And yeah, and I mean every animal with a brain</p>
<p>because of course there are animals with nervous systems</p>
<p>that are not centralized like jellyfish.</p>
<p>But anyway, we&rsquo;re digressing there.</p>
<p>So the locus coeruleus is filled with neurons</p>
<p>that have in them norepinephrine,</p>
<p>which is the brain&rsquo;s version of epinephrine or adrenaline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also called noradrenaline.</p>
<p>And what it does is it,</p>
<p>just like adrenaline in the rest of our bodies,</p>
<p>it helps prime us to respond to our environment.</p>
<p>So when locus coeruleus neurons fire and fire in a burst,</p>
<p>we can switch our attention and they will fire in a burst</p>
<p>if, for example, a loud noise happens</p>
<p>in the middle of your concentrating on something.</p>
<p>So you can, it helps, it fires</p>
<p>and it helps you switch your attention to that thing</p>
<p>and then learn quickly from it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really important in a stress response.</p>
<p>It helps us do quick one-trial learning.</p>
<p>And then tonic activity during the day</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re just, you know, doing normal,</p>
<p>going about your normal concentration kind of activities</p>
<p>is really good for sustained attention.</p>
<p>It works with the cholinergic system of our basal forebrain,</p>
<p>which is really important for learning and memory also</p>
<p>to help us learn about things and put things together.</p>
<p>But just tonic levels are signature</p>
<p>of wakefulness and alertness.</p>
<p>So too much is panic with locus coeruleus activity.</p>
<p>A burst is switching attention</p>
<p>and then tonic levels are sustained constant attention.</p>
<p>And then when we go to sleep, the locus coeruleus slows</p>
<p>and goes from about on average two Hertz</p>
<p>to about one Hertz, one cycle per second tonically.</p>
<p>And then when we go into REM sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the only time when it shuts off completely.</p>
<p>And it appears that that complete silence</p>
<p>is really, really important for a number of things.</p>
<p>And the main thing that I think it&rsquo;s important for</p>
<p>is the ability to erase and break down synapses</p>
<p>that are no longer working for us.</p>
<p>So they encode things that are false now,</p>
<p>or they are encoding things that we learned</p>
<p>in the novelty encoding pathway of our brain</p>
<p>that have now been consolidated to other pathways.</p>
<p>And so we need to now erase them</p>
<p>from the novelty encoding pathway.</p>
<p>And that is really, really important</p>
<p>for being able to continue to learn things</p>
<p>all of our lives.</p>
<p>So like erasing that REM or that, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>what do you call those discs</p>
<p>that you stick in the computers?</p>
<p>Hard drive?</p>
<p>No, thumb drives.</p>
<p>Yeah, erasing your thumb drives.</p>
<p>That thumb drive is what you carry around all day long.</p>
<p>And then during sleep, you write that thumb drive</p>
<p>to the cortex, to the long-term memory structures,</p>
<p>and you need to refresh that thumb drive.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happens during REM sleep</p>
<p>when the locus coeruleus is off.</p>
<p>Because whenever it&rsquo;s on and neuroadrenaline is there,</p>
<p>it helps us to put things together.</p>
<p>It helps us to learn and strengthen synapses,</p>
<p>but it does not allow us to actually weaken synapses</p>
<p>that are also a really important part</p>
<p>for life, important part of lifelong learning.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s so much more I could say about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, locus coeruleus sounds fascinating.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s connected to the basal four brain</p>
<p>cholinergic system.</p>
<p>The neurons in locus coeruleus,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, release norepinephrine,</p>
<p>perhaps epinephrine as well?</p>
<p>Well, no, the brain&rsquo;s version of epinephrine</p>
<p>is norepinephrine.</p>
<p>The other thing it also,</p>
<p>the precursor to norepinephrine is dopamine.</p>
<p>And so the source of dopamine in the hippocampus</p>
<p>seems to be the locus coeruleus,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still a mystery as under what conditions</p>
<p>the locus coeruleus also releases dopamine,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really important when we&rsquo;re learning something new</p>
<p>to also release dopamine</p>
<p>or to at least activate the dopaminergic receptors</p>
<p>in our hippocampus.</p>
<p>So yeah, so dopamine, norepinephrine,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s also galanin,</p>
<p>which is important for releasing when we&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>and it helps also without rapid learning.</p>
<p>It works in concert with norepinephrine</p>
<p>and in doing what it needs to do to strengthen synapses</p>
<p>so that we learn really quickly.</p>
<p>I love that there are multiple molecules involved</p>
<p>because that signals us to a principle,</p>
<p>which is that even if people can&rsquo;t remember all the names,</p>
<p>that rarely in biology is something handled</p>
<p>by just one molecule or pathway,</p>
<p>that redundancy is the rule</p>
<p>because signaling attention to specific events</p>
<p>is so important.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna use that as a just-so story.</p>
<p>I always say, you know,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase,</p>
<p>but it makes sense to me as to why redundancy</p>
<p>would exist in the system.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and in fact,</p>
<p>when we form hypotheses about the brain,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always wrong.</p>
<p>And the reason why we&rsquo;re always wrong</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s more complicated than we&rsquo;d like to think.</p>
<p>And because in our brains, when we&rsquo;re forming hypotheses,</p>
<p>we fail to account for all of the factors that are involved,</p>
<p>you know, the glia, the neuropeptides, the neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>the physical structure of synapses.</p>
<p>And so when I was going through grad school 35 years ago,</p>
<p>the dogma was that every neuron</p>
<p>contains one neurotransmitter</p>
<p>and releases one neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>And you had excitatory neurotransmitters</p>
<p>and inhibitory neurotransmitters</p>
<p>and neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s as complicated as God.</p>
<p>And then we started talking about neuropeptides</p>
<p>and people said, oh no, please don&rsquo;t complicate it.</p>
<p>And then we started talking about how neurons</p>
<p>contain both neuropeptides and neurotransmitters</p>
<p>and maybe more than one neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>Maybe even hormones too.</p>
<p>And hormones and oh Lord, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so complicated,</p>
<p>but I gotta admit that&rsquo;s why it works, right?</p>
<p>And every time the brain teaches us</p>
<p>something new about itself that we didn&rsquo;t hypothesize,</p>
<p>we say, oh, of course,</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t work if the way I hypothesized it with it,</p>
<p>you know, we actually need redundancy.</p>
<p>We need all of these systems to work together.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s daunting sometimes,</p>
<p>but it also ensures many, many careers in science</p>
<p>and neuroscience in particular.</p>
<p>So note that aspiring scientists,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s plenty of room for discovery.</p>
<p>Do you want me to talk about norepinephrine and emotion?</p>
<p>Yes, well, what I&rsquo;d love for you to tell us about is,</p>
<p>you know, what role this lack of norepinephrine release</p>
<p>during rapid eye movement sleep is thought to achieve.</p>
<p>And maybe you could also review some of your work</p>
<p>describing conditions under which norepinephrine invades.</p>
<p>Yeah, invades sleep.</p>
<p>Rapid eye movement sleep and other patterns of sleep</p>
<p>and how that can be detrimental.</p>
<p>Yeah, so a lot of this is hypothetical,</p>
<p>but based on a lot of good evidence</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re sewing together into a schema</p>
<p>from which these hypotheses come,</p>
<p>so a model schema from which the hypotheses come.</p>
<p>But one thing that happens to people</p>
<p>with post-traumatic stress disorder</p>
<p>is that there is a lot of evidence</p>
<p>that the locus surrealis doesn&rsquo;t stop firing in REM sleep.</p>
<p>So whereas their levels of norepinephrine</p>
<p>might be similar to people without PTSD during the day</p>
<p>and even during the first part of the night,</p>
<p>during the wee hours of the morning</p>
<p>and when you measure norepinephrine levels</p>
<p>from metabolites in the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid,</p>
<p>you see that people with PTSD,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s during the wee hours of the morning</p>
<p>when you have the most REM sleep that they have,</p>
<p>their norepinephrine levels differentiate most</p>
<p>from those that don&rsquo;t have PTSD.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s evidence that the locus surrealis</p>
<p>is not shutting down during REM sleep like it should.</p>
<p>Other evidence is heart rate variability.</p>
<p>When our locus surrealis is firing,</p>
<p>our heart rates are generally a little higher</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t vary as much as they do</p>
<p>when the locus surrealis is not firing.</p>
<p>So during slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>normally have this big juicy variability in heart rate</p>
<p>with every breath in and breath out</p>
<p>because our noradrenergic levels,</p>
<p>our norepinephrine levels are lower.</p>
<p>During REM sleep, that goes away entirely</p>
<p>and our heart rate is dominated by parasympathetic</p>
<p>rather than sympathetic activity</p>
<p>and also what our brain is driving,</p>
<p>what are we dreaming about, for example,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re dreaming we&rsquo;re running,</p>
<p>our heart rates will go up.</p>
<p>But norepinephrine levels still should be low or off.</p>
<p>So people with PTSD, that noradrenergic,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re studying these in rats too,</p>
<p>is it true that our locus surrealis doesn&rsquo;t shut off</p>
<p>when we have post-traumatic stress disorder</p>
<p>and the preliminary evidence is yes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true that it doesn&rsquo;t shut off.</p>
<p>So what that would do is norepinephrine</p>
<p>would act at synapses to prevent that weakening</p>
<p>that you really need, for example,</p>
<p>of novelty encoding structures</p>
<p>and it keeps memories in that novelty encoding structure</p>
<p>even once it&rsquo;s consolidated to the rest of the brain.</p>
<p>In the hippocampus, which is important</p>
<p>for remembering things throughout our lives</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s that thumb drive,</p>
<p>we need it to be erased so that we can learn new things</p>
<p>once it&rsquo;s been consolidated</p>
<p>to the hard drive of our cortex.</p>
<p>And so if we&rsquo;re not able to do that,</p>
<p>we fill up that RAM really quickly</p>
<p>or that thumb drive really quickly</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not able to learn new things.</p>
<p>So for example, after a trauma,</p>
<p>I talked about the locus surrealis</p>
<p>responding in stressful situations, that&rsquo;s great,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very adaptive, but then you need it to stop.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve learned what you need to learn from it</p>
<p>and you wanna go to sleep,</p>
<p>you need the locus surrealis to calm down</p>
<p>and during REM sleep, you want it to stop</p>
<p>because then when you&rsquo;ve consolidated</p>
<p>that traumatic memory to the cortex,</p>
<p>you need to erase it from the novelty encoding structures,</p>
<p>for example, in the hippocampus,</p>
<p>so that then when you&rsquo;re in the context of safety,</p>
<p>you can learn those new things, those new contexts</p>
<p>and stop responding to those same stimuli</p>
<p>as though you&rsquo;re in that original situation.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not able to erase that thumb drive,</p>
<p>you will always feel like that trauma happened</p>
<p>that same day, like earlier that same day</p>
<p>and respond as you would to a recent trauma,</p>
<p>which is with beating heart and all of that.</p>
<p>So even memories that are years past,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re never able to downscale that novelty</p>
<p>encoding structure and purge it from that traumatic memory,</p>
<p>it will stay fresh and new and then become maladaptive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just take a brief moment</p>
<p>and thank one of our podcast sponsors,</p>
<p>which is InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that blood work is the only way</p>
<p>that you can monitor the markers,</p>
<p>such as hormone markers, lipids, metabolic factors,</p>
<p>et cetera, that impact your immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>One major challenge with blood work, however,</p>
<p>is that most of the time,</p>
<p>it does not come back with any information</p>
<p>about what to do in order to move the values</p>
<p>for hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,</p>
<p>into the ranges that you want.</p>
<p>With InsideTracker, changing those values</p>
<p>becomes very straightforward</p>
<p>because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use</p>
<p>to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,</p>
<p>supplement-based approaches that you can use</p>
<p>in order to move those values into the ranges</p>
<p>that are optimal for you, your vitality, and your longevity.</p>
<p>InsideTracker now includes a measurement</p>
<p>of apolipoprotein B, so-called ApoB, in their ultimate plan.</p>
<p>ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>and therefore there&rsquo;s extreme value</p>
<p>to knowing your ApoB levels.</p>

<p>What approaches are you aware of</p>
<p>that can turn down the output of locus coeruleus</p>
<p>during these phases of sleep?</p>
<p>And for that matter, what things can cause ramping up</p>
<p>of locus coeruleus during this phase of sleep?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a couple podcast episodes, solo episodes,</p>
<p>and with guests talking about trauma.</p>
<p>We had Dr. Paul Conti, who&rsquo;s a Stanford-trained,</p>
<p>Harvard-trained psychiatrist who talked a lot about trauma,</p>
<p>wrote an excellent book on trauma,</p>
<p>and certainly sleep was emphasized as a key thing,</p>
<p>like get enough sleep, but here you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>even if somebody with trauma gets enough sleep,</p>
<p>if locus coeruleus is hyperactive during sleep,</p>
<p>those traumas are gonna persist,</p>
<p>and most of the trauma treatments that I&rsquo;m aware of</p>
<p>are everything ranging from cognitive behavioral therapy,</p>
<p>talk therapy, drug therapy, EMDR, hypnosis.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there&rsquo;s a lot of interest and attention</p>
<p>on clinical studies on exploring psychedelics,</p>
<p>high-dose psilocybin, and MDMA,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a vast landscape, none of which, as far as I know,</p>
<p>is really focused on sleep specifically.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not, and they should be,</p>
<p>because actually, psychedelics is a sleep-like state,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a REM sleep-like state,</p>
<p>although, of course, there are some major differences,</p>
<p>so yeah, so much to talk about here.</p>
<p>So antidepressants are often noradrenergic</p>
<p>or serotonergic reuptake inhibitors,</p>
<p>so they leave norepinephrine, actually,</p>
<p>out there in the synapses,</p>
<p>and what that does is it inhibits REM sleep,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re able to get REM sleep,</p>
<p>it would probably be REM sleep</p>
<p>with some noradrenergic activity,</p>
<p>so actually, I think, anyway, I&rsquo;m not a physician,</p>
<p>that antidepressants are counter-indicated.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to take them if you&rsquo;ve experienced a trauma</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re experiencing PTSD,</p>
<p>because if anything, it&rsquo;s going to make it worse</p>
<p>or at least prevent the type of adaptive REM sleep</p>
<p>that you really need in order to resolve those emotions</p>
<p>and move on.</p>
<p>Is that statement specific to antidepressants</p>
<p>that tickle the noradrenergic pathway?</p>
<p>So the one that comes to mind is, I can never pronounce it,</p>
<p>bupropyron, which is, I think the brand name is Welbutrin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dopaminergic and noradrenergic agonist,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the net effect, as opposed to the Prozac,</p>
<p>Zoloft variety, which are SSRIs.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, but SSRIs themselves also are problematic</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t talk about it yet,</p>
<p>but the dorsal raphe nucleus, which produces serotonin,</p>
<p>which the specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors</p>
<p>block from being reuptaken,</p>
<p>leaves too much serotonin out there.</p>
<p>And what serotonin also is, another neurotransmitter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s down-regulated during REM sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s specifically off during REM sleep.</p>
<p>And what serotonin does is it weights all of our cognition</p>
<p>to being able to recognize novelty again.</p>
<p>So it sort of weights our brain away</p>
<p>from a sense of familiarity and toward novelty.</p>
<p>And it might be one reason</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s an effective antidepressant,</p>
<p>because it makes the world feel fresh and new again, right?</p>
<p>But when you have too much,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re holding a novel traumatic memory</p>
<p>in your novelty encoding structure too strongly already,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to, again, weight things toward novelty.</p>
<p>You need that absence of serotonin also</p>
<p>to help you get that sense of familiarity</p>
<p>and to start erasing the novelty encoding structures.</p>
<p>So you need both to be absent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>We hear a lot about serotonin,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not often discussed in terms of its features</p>
<p>related to novelty enough, I think.</p>
<p>And what you just described cues me to something</p>
<p>that Dr. Paul Conti and others have said</p>
<p>in terms of trauma, and here I&rsquo;m paraphrasing,</p>
<p>so my apologies to them for not getting this exactly right,</p>
<p>that an effective treatment for trauma</p>
<p>does not erase the traumatic memory,</p>
<p>but it causes a transition</p>
<p>of what once was disturbing and invasive and maladaptive</p>
<p>to eventually just become kind of a boring old story</p>
<p>that has kind of a fuzzy texture to it,</p>
<p>as opposed to this kind of sharp, high friction texture</p>
<p>that invades our thinking</p>
<p>and obviously our sleeping states as well.</p>
<p>So again, and I appreciate the disclaimer,</p>
<p>the caveats around not being a clinician, et cetera,</p>
<p>but I do think that there&rsquo;s a lot of interest now</p>
<p>in whether or not antidepressants</p>
<p>are effective for trauma or not.</p>
<p>And I think these aspects of neuromodulation</p>
<p>as they relate to, let&rsquo;s call it erasing traumas</p>
<p>or changing the emotional load of traumas during sleep</p>
<p>is something important to take note.</p>
<p>We also have a lot of clinicians</p>
<p>that listen to this podcast,</p>
<p>so they should also take note, please.</p>
<p>So if I want to reduce the amount of norepinephrine</p>
<p>released from locus coeruleus</p>
<p>during rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>to eliminate the troubling or maybe even traumatic memories</p>
<p>and allow late stages of sleep each night</p>
<p>to have their maximum positive effect,</p>
<p>is there anything that I can do besides avoiding traumas,</p>
<p>avoiding serotonergic or neuroadrenergic compounds?</p>
<p>Well, I would also avoid anything</p>
<p>just prior to going to sleep that might excite those systems.</p>
<p>So a lot of novelty, a lot of exciting,</p>
<p>stress-inducing video games.</p>
<p>Try and enter sleep with as much calm as you can.</p>
<p>So maybe deep breathing exercises.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful way to calm your sympathetic</p>
<p>fight or flight system is deep breathing.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t been able to test this with rats</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t ask them to do a deep breathing exercise.</p>
<p>There might be a way we can do that,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t found out or figured it out yet.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s a way you can make your sympathetic system,</p>
<p>nervous system calm down before you go to sleep,</p>
<p>might free for you meditation or deep breathing exercises.</p>
<p>It might be for some, a warm bath or a comforting book.</p>
<p>Nothing too exciting, but also nothing too boring, perhaps.</p>
<p>Just something right in the middle,</p>
<p>which makes you feel happy and calm is what you should do.</p>
<p>And if you instead go to sleep while you&rsquo;re anxious</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re hyped up,</p>
<p>then your sleep could become maladaptive.</p>
<p>Another thing that happens in rats that we have yet to know,</p>
<p>if it happens in women,</p>
<p>is that female rats have three phases of their estrous cycle</p>
<p>that their locus realis doesn&rsquo;t seem to calm down</p>
<p>during REM sleep as much.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>but during the high estrogen phases of their estrous cycle,</p>
<p>the locus realis shuts down just like it does in male rats.</p>
<p>But in the other three phases, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So one thing that might work,</p>
<p>and in fact, there are a few studies that show it,</p>
<p>it could work really well,</p>
<p>is giving women after a trauma event</p>
<p>something that contains estrogen,</p>
<p>because estrogen somehow is protective against PTSD.</p>
<p>And they know that through retrospective studies</p>
<p>where they gave women an emergency room,</p>
<p>either a pill with estrogen or without,</p>
<p>and those that had the pill with estrogen in it</p>
<p>were much less likely to get PTSD from that trauma</p>
<p>as measured a year later</p>
<p>than those that had the pill without.</p>
<p>So there are some really good studies by Bronwyn Graham,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s out of Australia,</p>
<p>to really hone in on how much estrogen do you need</p>
<p>and also testosterone, just so you know,</p>
<p>gets converted to estrogen in the brain.</p>
<p>So testosterone also can be protective</p>
<p>because it gets converted to estrogen.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about estrogen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really helpful and protective</p>
<p>about that from the high locus realis firing.</p>
<p>And this is, again, preliminary data</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have full,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have all the answers yet,</p>
<p>and we are looking into it actively right now,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>The other thing about women is that we are</p>
<p>two to four times more susceptible</p>
<p>to anxiety-related mental health disorders,</p>
<p>including post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>So if we could figure out what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>to the locus realis during sleep in women,</p>
<p>and then figure out a way to normalize that</p>
<p>so the locus realis is silent</p>
<p>when it needs to be silent,</p>
<p>I think we could go a long way</p>
<p>in helping women be more resilient</p>
<p>to stress-related disorders.</p>
<p>What are some other sex differences</p>
<p>as they relate to sleep?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>There have been very few studies, unfortunately,</p>
<p>of women in sleep, women in estrous cycle</p>
<p>or menstrual cycle in sleep.</p>
<p>But what we have found,</p>
<p>which actually largely replicated the study in 1960,</p>
<p>is that women, or females, rather,</p>
<p>at high estrogen, high hormonal phases</p>
<p>of their estrous cycle or menstrual cycle</p>
<p>sleep a lot less, but that sleep is more efficient.</p>
<p>So that sleep is more dense in those sleep spindles,</p>
<p>which I haven&rsquo;t gone into what they might do,</p>
<p>except this connection between the hippocampus and cortex,</p>
<p>but those sleep spindles are more dense</p>
<p>and more coherent across the brain areas.</p>
<p>The theta cycle, which is five to 10 hertz</p>
<p>in the hippocampus, important for one-year learning</p>
<p>and also important during REM sleep,</p>
<p>is also bigger and juicier during the high hormonal phases.</p>
<p>So even though there&rsquo;s less sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more efficient and better.</p>
<p>So all of that efficiency seems to be reduced</p>
<p>in those other hormonal phases.</p>
<p>So even though you might sleep a little more,</p>
<p>you might need more sleep, in fact,</p>
<p>in order to accomplish the same thing</p>
<p>that you can get with that short,</p>
<p>very efficient sleep of high hormonal phases.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a growing trend,</p>
<p>at least among NIH-funded grants,</p>
<p>to require that, as they refer to it in the grants,</p>
<p>biological sex as a variable.</p>
<p>And here we&rsquo;re not talking about sex, the verb,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s studies about that too,</p>
<p>but biological sex is a variable</p>
<p>because there is a dearth of studies</p>
<p>exploring sex differences in most everything.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of reasons for that,</p>
<p>but more importantly, fortunately, the trend is shifting.</p>
<p>And even when you study males versus females,</p>
<p>a lot of people just include females in their studies,</p>
<p>but then don&rsquo;t track the estrous cycle or menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>And hormones have huge effects on our behavior.</p>
<p>I mean, just think of when you said sex,</p>
<p>before hormones come in, we&rsquo;re not interested in it.</p>
<p>And suddenly, that&rsquo;s kind of a main driver of behaviors.</p>
<p>Hormones can definitely change who we are and what we do.</p>
<p>So we should be studying hormones, not just sex.</p>
<p>I always say that puberty</p>
<p>is perhaps the most massive transformation</p>
<p>and rate of aging that any of us go through</p>
<p>in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>An individual, their cognition changes,</p>
<p>their worldview changes, and that&rsquo;s largely hormonal driven</p>
<p>and obviously neural architectures change too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy that you mentioned</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get into calmer states prior to sleep</p>
<p>and some ways to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan, and I&rsquo;ve talked a lot before on this podcast</p>
<p>about things like yoga nidra,</p>
<p>which is a non-movement based practice,</p>
<p>sometimes called non-sleep depressed,</p>
<p>where people actually take some time each day</p>
<p>to practice how to go into a more parasympathetic,</p>
<p>aka relaxed state deliberately,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a bit of a skill.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s some good data really,</p>
<p>mostly out of a laboratory in Scandinavia</p>
<p>showing huge increases in nigrostriatal dopamine</p>
<p>when people basically engage in a practice</p>
<p>of deliberate non-movement,</p>
<p>and that the brain actually enters states</p>
<p>of a very shallow sleep.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of nap-ish,</p>
<p>but the idea is to actually stay awake, but motionless.</p>
<p>And it does seem to restore</p>
<p>a certain number of features of neurochemistry,</p>
<p>but perhaps more importantly, it teaches people to relax,</p>
<p>which is something that most people are not very good at.</p>
<p>But in any event, and people who listen to this podcast</p>
<p>have heard me say this over and over again,</p>
<p>so I sound like a broken record,</p>
<p>but this practice as a zero cost practice</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t require any pharmacology</p>
<p>does seem to really enhance people&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to fall asleep more quickly</p>
<p>and to fall back asleep</p>
<p>if they wake up in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>So in any event, another plug for NSDR, yoga nidra.</p>
<p>Well, I just also want to add to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why insomnia is so insidious</p>
<p>is because when people feel like</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t gotten enough sleep</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not getting enough sleep</p>
<p>and they become anxious about getting enough sleep,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re anxious before going to sleep,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not going to fall asleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be 45 minutes in,</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>So you need to break that loop,</p>
<p>say, okay, my body&rsquo;s going to get as much sleep as it needs,</p>
<p>I needn&rsquo;t worry about it,</p>
<p>and then practice this relaxation to say,</p>
<p>hey, it&rsquo;s all okay, it&rsquo;s going to be all right,</p>
<p>and then concentrate on things that relax you,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s concentrating or not concentrating,</p>
<p>whatever it is.</p>
<p>You mentioned yoga nidra,</p>
<p>and that reminded me of transcendental meditation,</p>
<p>which is something that also hasn&rsquo;t been studied well,</p>
<p>largely because we can&rsquo;t ask non-human animals to do it,</p>
<p>and so we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>with our neurochemistry and our brain activity</p>
<p>in a deep and meaningful way,</p>
<p>but one thing that has been shown</p>
<p>and those that can do it really well</p>
<p>is that that theta activity that I said</p>
<p>happens when you&rsquo;re learning something</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re in REM sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s well-established and increases</p>
<p>during the transcendental meditation,</p>
<p>so it might be that some states of meditation</p>
<p>could in some ways replace or mimic some functions</p>
<p>of, for example, REM sleep,</p>
<p>but again, we don&rsquo;t know if all the neurochemistry is right</p>
<p>to do, for example, the thing that I was talking about,</p>
<p>which is erasing the novelty</p>
<p>and coding structures of the brain.</p>
<p>That needs an absence of norepinephrine and serotonin,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t know if that goes away</p>
<p>with transcendental meditation,</p>
<p>we just don&rsquo;t know the answer to that yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, the studies on yoga nidra and sleep replacement</p>
<p>are kind of interesting.</p>
<p>It does seem to be the case</p>
<p>that nothing can really replace sleep except sleep,</p>
<p>but that if one is sleep-deprived</p>
<p>or is having trouble falling back asleep,</p>
<p>that these things like,</p>
<p>and I acknowledge this is essentially like yoga nidra,</p>
<p>but we now call it non-sleep deep rest or NSDR</p>
<p>because oftentimes names like yoga nidra</p>
<p>act as a kind of a barrier</p>
<p>for what would otherwise be people willing</p>
<p>to try a practice.</p>
<p>It sounds mystical, it sounds like flying carpets</p>
<p>and it sounds like you have to go to Esalen,</p>
<p>by the way, Esalen&rsquo;s a beautiful place,</p>
<p>but it sounds like you have to go there</p>
<p>or live in the West Coast to believe in this stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>These are practices that are really just</p>
<p>self-directed relaxation as a practice</p>
<p>that allows people to get better and better</p>
<p>at directing their brain states towards more relaxation.</p>
<p>And most people have an asymmetry,</p>
<p>for instance, most people can force themselves</p>
<p>to stay up later,</p>
<p>but they have a hard time going to sleep earlier.</p>
<p>And that just speaks to the asymmetry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably adaptive and survival-based</p>
<p>that we can ramp ourselves up far more easily</p>
<p>than we can tend to calm ourselves down.</p>
<p>And actually, to appeal to other Christians like me,</p>
<p>prayer can be a wonderful way to calm yourself down</p>
<p>because through prayer, you&rsquo;re giving your cares to God</p>
<p>and saying, you know, and then you are relaxed,</p>
<p>more relaxed.</p>
<p>And I just want to say that</p>
<p>because the same reason that yoga might put some people off,</p>
<p>it might put some people off to talk about prayer,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the same process of being able to relax.</p>
<p>And yeah.</p>
<p>And get outside our own experience a little bit.</p>
<p>Get outside our own experience, yeah.</p>
<p>Back out, get a worldview</p>
<p>that might actually also help us to relax.</p>
<p>Well, you might be surprised at how many clinicians</p>
<p>and scientists who&rsquo;ve come on this podcast</p>
<p>have mentioned things like prayer from various perspectives,</p>
<p>Christianity, Judaism, Muslim traditions, and others,</p>
<p>that as a parallel to all of these things.</p>
<p>And I think what it speaks to is the fact that</p>
<p>ultimately the biological architectures</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all contending with</p>
<p>are going to be identical, right?</p>
<p>And so different ways to tap into them</p>
<p>and ones that are congruent with people&rsquo;s beliefs,</p>
<p>I think are great.</p>
<p>Yeah, because anything non-congruent with your beliefs</p>
<p>is also stressful.</p>
<p>Right, and feels forced.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why this idea of calling it non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>in addition to yoga nidra was not to detract</p>
<p>from the naming or the history around yoga nidra,</p>
<p>but I was finding that it was a barrier.</p>
<p>Likewise, yoga nidra tends to include things like intentions</p>
<p>whereas NSDR scripts,</p>
<p>and by the way, we will provide links</p>
<p>to some NSDR and yoga nidra scripts,</p>
<p>but NSDR has no intentions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply body scan deep relaxation based.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of the scientific version</p>
<p>of all of this stuff.</p>
<p>And actually we study it in the laboratory</p>
<p>and some of the brain states that people go into,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a discussion for another time.</p>
<p>Well, another thing, this is hard now.</p>
<p>My mother used to tell me when I would complain,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t go to sleep.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d say, well, you know, start with your toes and relax.</p>
<p>So you would clench your muscles around your toes</p>
<p>and you relax them and do that all the way from your toes</p>
<p>all the way to your head.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know where she got this.</p>
<p>It might&rsquo;ve been her own common sense</p>
<p>or she might&rsquo;ve gotten it from this NPR show.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Mind Can Keep You Well.</p>
<p>She used to listen to,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s another intentional relaxation</p>
<p>that focuses on the body</p>
<p>rather than on your own mental processes.</p>
<p>I do a little bit of work with the military</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a method within certain communities</p>
<p>of special operations in the US military</p>
<p>where if they can&rsquo;t sleep</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re having challenges sleeping,</p>
<p>they will deliberately try and relax their facial muscles</p>
<p>in particular, like sort of drape the facial muscles</p>
<p>and use long or exhale-emphasized breathing</p>
<p>does seem to increase the probability</p>
<p>of transitioning back into sleep.</p>
<p>And those are hallmarks of yoga nidra,</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest, body scans.</p>
<p>And so I think all of these things converge</p>
<p>on a common theme.</p>
<p>You know, as neurobiologists, we can say</p>
<p>all of the things that we&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>certainly move the needle away</p>
<p>from locus coeruleus activation.</p>
<p>I mean, we haven&rsquo;t done the experiment</p>
<p>to really look at that,</p>
<p>but it seems all these things are counter</p>
<p>to noradrenaline release.</p>
<p>Another one is yawning.</p>
<p>Yawning in itself is that kind of sort of tensing</p>
<p>of all the muscles in your face and then relaxing them.</p>
<p>So it might be why we yawn.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know why we yawn yet,</p>
<p>but it might also be really great.</p>
<p>Actually animals yawn too, you know.</p>
<p>My bulldog was a perpetual.</p>
<p>If he wasn&rsquo;t sleeping, he was yawning.</p>
<p>And it would be interesting to see</p>
<p>what yawning does to the locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>Does that also calm and switch locus coeruleus activity?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s interesting that facial nerve,</p>
<p>like trigeminal nerve, you know,</p>
<p>through the vagus connects indirectly to the locus coeruleus</p>
<p>and has a powerful effect on that.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>A common, I think, friend of ours</p>
<p>and direct colleague of yours, Jack Feldman,</p>
<p>was a guest on this podcast telling us</p>
<p>about all the amazing structures he and others</p>
<p>have discovered in respiration and breathing.</p>
<p>Sounds like we have a collaboration brewing</p>
<p>that the three of us should definitely carry out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to share with us a little bit more</p>
<p>about the spindles that have come up a few times.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s relevant to this.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s not, let&rsquo;s separate it out.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d love for you to tell us a little bit</p>
<p>about the role of sleep in problem solving and creativity.</p>
<p>And if spindles are involved,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll consider myself lucky</p>
<p>for batching them in the same question.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re not involved,</p>
<p>feel free to separate them out.</p>
<p>I think they could be involved.</p>
<p>And the reason why I think they could be involved,</p>
<p>because we now know a lot more about spindles.</p>
<p>First of all, the first thing that we knew,</p>
<p>first of all, we ignored them.</p>
<p>Then we thought they had something to do</p>
<p>with keeping us asleep.</p>
<p>And that was their function,</p>
<p>is when an external stimulus came,</p>
<p>they would keep us asleep because they would arise.</p>
<p>But now we know that the density of our sleep spindles,</p>
<p>the number that we produce per minute,</p>
<p>is well correlated with our intelligence in the first place.</p>
<p>And that no matter what your intelligence is,</p>
<p>and no matter what your sleep spindle density is,</p>
<p>if you learn something during the day</p>
<p>and increase your sleep spindle density,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really almost perfectly correlated</p>
<p>with our ability to consolidate that information</p>
<p>and incorporate it into the schema</p>
<p>that we already have in our brain.</p>
<p>So if you try and learn something new,</p>
<p>even if your sleep spindle density at baseline is great,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t increase your sleep spindles that night,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna use sleep to really incorporate it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, sleep spindles are poor</p>
<p>in those with schizophrenia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the characteristic signatures of sleep</p>
<p>is that sleep spindles are very few and far between,</p>
<p>which might mean that people with schizophrenia</p>
<p>might not be able to incorporate new information</p>
<p>into already existing schema.</p>
<p>And instead it sort of flaps in the breeze out there</p>
<p>and can be accessed erroneously at times</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t want it to be involved.</p>
<p>So I digress.</p>
<p>So sleep spindles and creativity.</p>
<p>So one of the things we now know</p>
<p>through some great studies by Julie Seep and Anita Luthi</p>
<p>is that sleep spindles are accompanied</p>
<p>by an incredible plasticity out in the distal dendrites,</p>
<p>the listening branches of our neurons</p>
<p>that listen to other cortical areas.</p>
<p>So there are proximal dendrites in our neurons</p>
<p>that listen to the external world</p>
<p>and are conducted through the thalamus.</p>
<p>And then there are distal dendrites</p>
<p>which listen to an internal kind of conversation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in our brains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of our internal state, really.</p>
<p>And during sleep spindles,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when those distal dendrites are able to best learn</p>
<p>from other cortical areas and from the hippocampus.</p>
<p>It is during sleep spindles that the hippocampus</p>
<p>and the cortex are best connected</p>
<p>and when that incredible plasticity can happen.</p>
<p>When I talk about schema,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a cortical, cortical thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the image of Santa Claus and presents</p>
<p>comes together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not through some external thing.</p>
<p>Once we learn those things together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s our cortex that encodes that</p>
<p>and brings those images back up together.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s during sleep spindles when that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s big surges of calcium</p>
<p>into those distal dendrites</p>
<p>and where plasticity happens in just huge amounts.</p>
<p>During that sleep spindle stage of sleep,</p>
<p>which is N2 stage,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also another excitatory event</p>
<p>that comes all the way from the brainstem</p>
<p>and projects everywhere in our cortex,</p>
<p>which is called PGO waves.</p>
<p>P for pons, G for geniculate nucleus of the thalamus,</p>
<p>which is where they&rsquo;re first discovered</p>
<p>and O for occipital area, which is our visual area,</p>
<p>which is again where they&rsquo;re first discovered.</p>
<p>But in fact, it&rsquo;s now been shown that PGO waves,</p>
<p>which we should generalize to P waves</p>
<p>because they come from the pons and go to the thalamus</p>
<p>and then the cortex happens all over the brains.</p>
<p>And that is where glutamate,</p>
<p>which is a major excitatory neurotransmitter</p>
<p>involved in learning and plasticity</p>
<p>is being released in big amounts</p>
<p>also in those distal dendrites.</p>
<p>So P waves and spindles work together to cause plasticity</p>
<p>and so our schema together,</p>
<p>which could be the origins for insight and creativity.</p>
<p>Now, when PGO waves or P waves are first discovered,</p>
<p>it was thought to be random</p>
<p>because this small area that generates P waves</p>
<p>all over the brain projects all over the thalamus</p>
<p>and causes P waves all over.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t measure P waves all over the brain</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s just seems sporadic and random.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably,</p>
<p>and P waves also happening even more during REM sleep,</p>
<p>rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people think that REM dreams are so random</p>
<p>is because these P waves are random</p>
<p>and they could generate dreams</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re an internal source of excitation</p>
<p>that kind of replaces the outside world</p>
<p>during our dream state.</p>
<p>And so these P waves, if they are random,</p>
<p>could function or could be the underlying reason</p>
<p>why REM sleep dreams are random.</p>
<p>And it might also be why creativity can happen there</p>
<p>is because we&rsquo;re randomly activating,</p>
<p>co-activating different things in our brain</p>
<p>that we can then sew together.</p>
<p>But it might not be as random as we think.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a caveat there.</p>
<p>I just learned a lot from you</p>
<p>because I teach brainstem to medical students</p>
<p>and I talk about the pons.</p>
<p>And the pons is like this dense collection</p>
<p>of all these different nuclei</p>
<p>involved in a bunch of different things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s close by a bunch of interesting things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still kind of a mysterious brain area.</p>
<p>But when I learned about PGO waves,</p>
<p>I thought pons, geniculate, occipital,</p>
<p>because occipital is most commonly associated</p>
<p>with the visual cortex.</p>
<p>I thought it was the origin</p>
<p>of the visual component of dreams.</p>
<p>It probably is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy to learn that they should be called P waves</p>
<p>because they include lots of different areas of the brain.</p>
<p>And it makes really good sense to me</p>
<p>why the kind of pseudo randomness of dreams,</p>
<p>especially these late night or an early morning,</p>
<p>later in sleep, I should say,</p>
<p>and early morning dreams</p>
<p>seem to be cobbled together from kind of</p>
<p>disparate experiences.</p>
<p>I mean, you walk through a door</p>
<p>and suddenly it&rsquo;s a completely different context</p>
<p>and landscape.</p>
<p>Yes, beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like this idea a lot,</p>
<p>but it makes intuitive sense.</p>
<p>It makes biological sense.</p>
<p>It also gives me something to talk about</p>
<p>to the medical students next quarter</p>
<p>when I talk about pons.</p>
<p>Ren, you want to talk about where in the pons</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right below the locus surrealis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the sub surrealis.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re glutamatergic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also called SLD, sublateral dorsal nucleus, so.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>So note to any aspiring neurobiologists,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a vast landscape of yet to be undiscovered</p>
<p>structure and functions in the pons.</p>
<p>You want to work on something</p>
<p>that is sure to reveal something novel,</p>
<p>work on the pons.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s in every textbook.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a clinically very important structure.</p>
<p>Sadly, gliomas and other cancers of the brain</p>
<p>can sometimes, can often surface in the pons,</p>
<p>but we still know very little about it.</p>
<p>I read a paper this last year,</p>
<p>and I think it was covered in a bit of popular press,</p>
<p>that during rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>people can solve problems or respond to external stimuli.</p>
<p>Like for instance, they would give them math problems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d whisper in their ear while they were in REM sleep,</p>
<p>you know, what&rsquo;s two plus two?</p>
<p>And people would say, even though they were paralyzed,</p>
<p>apparently they could still move their mouth</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;d say four or something like that.</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;d say, you know, what&rsquo;s your name?</p>
<p>And people could respond.</p>
<p>And so that in REM sleep, perhaps people,</p>
<p>some elements of cognition are still active.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you brought that up.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know the authors of that study.</p>
<p>And listen, if ever I say something wrong,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great on this podcast</p>
<p>because someone will tell us in the YouTube comments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the great uses of YouTube comments.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d love to know your thoughts on that study.</p>
<p>I mean, is that just kind of an odd feature?</p>
<p>Or does this have meaning?</p>
<p>Should we actually care about this result?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no just about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really actually intriguing and interesting</p>
<p>and might relate to this paper that I talked about</p>
<p>where we said different areas of the brain</p>
<p>can be in different states at the same time.</p>
<p>So lucid dreaming is another thing</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t ask animals to do</p>
<p>or can&rsquo;t ask them if they&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>But we can certainly ask humans to do it.</p>
<p>And some people can do it really well.</p>
<p>And it would be really interesting to see</p>
<p>in those people who could lucid dream really well,</p>
<p>whether they spend more or less time</p>
<p>in this asymmetrical state</p>
<p>where one area of the brain is in one state</p>
<p>and another area of the brain is in another.</p>
<p>And it might be that those people can respond</p>
<p>to questions during REM sleep best</p>
<p>are those that have the most asymmetry</p>
<p>or dissimilarity or dissociation</p>
<p>between subcortical and cortical structures.</p>
<p>Or it might be that they&rsquo;re the ones</p>
<p>with the most symmetry.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I do worry a little bit about lucid dreaming</p>
<p>because people are, it&rsquo;s a fad.</p>
<p>People are really excited about it.</p>
<p>And to be able to remember one&rsquo;s dreams is fun</p>
<p>often unless they&rsquo;re nightmares.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Or to be able to direct one&rsquo;s dreams</p>
<p>if they are nightmares is really wonderful power to have</p>
<p>to be able to redirect a nightmare</p>
<p>that has been repeated to something else</p>
<p>and then kick yourself out of that repetitive nightmare</p>
<p>is really nice.</p>
<p>But I worry a little bit about</p>
<p>because we know so little</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s actually going on in the brain.</p>
<p>And if this lucid dreaming state is preventing us from,</p>
<p>for example, from the locus realis from calming down</p>
<p>or the serotonergic system from silencing like it should.</p>
<p>And maybe what we&rsquo;re doing during this state is,</p>
<p>yeah, we&rsquo;re activating the learning and memory structures</p>
<p>but in a way that&rsquo;s maladaptive</p>
<p>in terms of the erasure that we need to do.</p>
<p>So maybe one of the reasons</p>
<p>why most people don&rsquo;t remember most of their dreams</p>
<p>is for good reason.</p>
<p>Your hippocampus is in a state</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not writing new memories.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s writing out the memories it learned</p>
<p>during the day to the cortex</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s immune from incoming new information.</p>
<p>So maybe lucid dreaming is bad</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re activating the hippocampus</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s writing new memories</p>
<p>and it might be really maladaptive</p>
<p>for things like PTSD.</p>
<p>On the other hand,</p>
<p>let me just argue myself right out of this.</p>
<p>When I used to have a repeated nightmare when I was a kid,</p>
<p>my mother, who&rsquo;s so wise, would tell me,</p>
<p>well, listen, just next time you&rsquo;re in that dream,</p>
<p>say, hey, I&rsquo;m in a dream and then change something about it.</p>
<p>So she and I rehearsed what the horrible dream that it was.</p>
<p>It was a big monster running after me</p>
<p>and my legs were like mud and I couldn&rsquo;t run away</p>
<p>and it was just terrifying.</p>
<p>And that was a dream I would have</p>
<p>time and time again.</p>
<p>She said, okay, next time what are you gonna do</p>
<p>when that monster comes after you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna run away.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s what you do every time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always the same outcome.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t run.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do something different.</p>
<p>Like what could you do that&rsquo;s different?</p>
<p>So I came up with,</p>
<p>I could turn around and punch it in the nose.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So the next time I had that dream,</p>
<p>I did recognize this is that same old dream,</p>
<p>which means that there&rsquo;s part of my brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s conscious enough to know</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m in a dreaming state</p>
<p>and then I didn&rsquo;t have the courage in my dream</p>
<p>because I was still terrified to punch</p>
<p>or touch the monster in any way,</p>
<p>but I did have the courage to turn around</p>
<p>and look it in the eye and say, no, that was enough.</p>
<p>I said, no.</p>
<p>And that was enough to knock me out of that rut</p>
<p>of that dream so that I never had it again.</p>
<p>I never had that same dream again.</p>
<p>And in fact, it gave me peace about dreaming</p>
<p>because I knew that if ever there was a nightmare</p>
<p>that was just too scary,</p>
<p>I could probably do something to change it</p>
<p>and knock myself out of it.</p>
<p>So even though I don&rsquo;t recommend lucid dreaming</p>
<p>on a normal day-to-day basis,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s enough that can knock you out of a rut,</p>
<p>one thing that happens with people with PTSD</p>
<p>is they have the same repeated horrible nightmare,</p>
<p>which is often a reliving of the day&rsquo;s trauma</p>
<p>that they had.</p>
<p>So maybe lucid dreaming can be used on occasion</p>
<p>to be a powerful tool</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much plasticity that happens</p>
<p>during REM sleep to knock you out of that rut</p>
<p>of reliving that event and just change it.</p>
<p>And you could probably practice that during wakefulness,</p>
<p>rehearse the event that happened that was so traumatic,</p>
<p>and then just introduce a new element,</p>
<p>like now I&rsquo;m safe.</p>
<p>Now, the sound that was associated</p>
<p>with that really traumatic thing,</p>
<p>I should now associate with something else.</p>
<p>And next time I have that dream, I&rsquo;m gonna change it.</p>
<p>So that sound is now this new thing</p>
<p>that it should be associated with safety.</p>
<p>And that might be enough, maybe, I hope,</p>
<p>to knock you out of that repeated nightmare</p>
<p>and maybe even start you on the path to recovery</p>
<p>because if you can calm down</p>
<p>about those nightmare states of sleep,</p>
<p>then maybe your locus surrealis,</p>
<p>which is involved in stress, can also relax</p>
<p>and you can do the erasure parts that need to be done.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I seem to recall a paper,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll have to find the reference and send it to you.</p>
<p>We will also put it in the show note captions,</p>
<p>that described a protocol</p>
<p>that essentially matches this idea.</p>
<p>And I think what they had people do</p>
<p>is either cue themselves to a particular smell</p>
<p>or tone in wakefulness,</p>
<p>then to try and recall a recurring nightmare.</p>
<p>Then during the night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>they had the tone playing in the background,</p>
<p>which would then cue them to the wakeful state.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still asleep, mind you,</p>
<p>but in the pseudo lucid or lucid state.</p>
<p>And then try and change some variable,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>Some either look the predator in the eyes</p>
<p>or do something different.</p>
<p>And then in the waking state,</p>
<p>take a little bit of time to try and script out</p>
<p>a different narrative altogether.</p>
<p>And it took several nights, as I recall, or more,</p>
<p>but that they were able to escape this recurring nightmare.</p>
<p>It was like a week or something.</p>
<p>Oh, so you&rsquo;re familiar with this study.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a beautiful study.</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>We will put a reference to that.</p>
<p>I need to revisit that study.</p>
<p>It was pretty recent,</p>
<p>but I need to dive into it again</p>
<p>because I think I didn&rsquo;t go as deep into it as I should have.</p>
<p>No, no, but the one thing that you,</p>
<p>that you, well, you said many right things,</p>
<p>but one of the things you said</p>
<p>is that they were able to cue the dreamer</p>
<p>when they knew when they were going to REM sleep,</p>
<p>and then they played the sound or had the odor.</p>
<p>Now, when you&rsquo;re normally asleep alone in your bed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to cue yourself,</p>
<p>but it might be that rehearsal enough</p>
<p>before you go to sleep is enough to help cue you</p>
<p>to that repeated nightmare,</p>
<p>remembering what the nightmare is,</p>
<p>and then figuring out how to cue yourself</p>
<p>to do something different.</p>
<p>For years, I had the same recurring nightmare</p>
<p>over and over and over again,</p>
<p>and it was so salient and so clear,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not going to share what it is</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s that disturbing.</p>
<p>It was just, I think it was the emotional load of it</p>
<p>and just how salient certain features were.</p>
<p>One person who was a real-life person</p>
<p>had a particular clothing on,</p>
<p>and that just served as this cue,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if I ever did any direct work</p>
<p>to try and deal with it,</p>
<p>but now it almost seems silly to describe it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, dreams are usually silly to describe.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was pretty silly,</p>
<p>but it was a pretty violent dream.</p>
<p>Yeah, and your emotional system</p>
<p>is so geared up during REM sleep,</p>
<p>which is another thing we could talk about.</p>
<p>Yeah, please.</p>
<p>I would love to.</p>
<p>So, locus coeruleus is ideally suppressed,</p>
<p>so we can&rsquo;t really snore epinephrine.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t act out our dreams.</p>
<p>During these very emotionally-laden thoughts</p>
<p>and storylines during sleep,</p>
<p>this almost starts to sound like a little bit of</p>
<p>a built-in while-sleeping trauma therapy,</p>
<p>because most trauma therapies involve</p>
<p>trying to get people into states of,</p>
<p>counter to what most people think,</p>
<p>you actually want to get close to the trauma</p>
<p>in terms of the narrative,</p>
<p>so you want to try and suppress</p>
<p>the emotional activity of it,</p>
<p>or, and I guess that&rsquo;s the motivation</p>
<p>for ketamine-based therapies for trauma,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve also heard, and this is still perplexing to me,</p>
<p>that other waking-based trauma therapies</p>
<p>involve taking people the other way,</p>
<p>making it very cathartic,</p>
<p>take them to the peak of the emotional response,</p>
<p>but then allow that to finally cycle down</p>
<p>into a more relaxed response.</p>
<p>So, please, if there&rsquo;s anything about locus coeruleus</p>
<p>and dreams that can help people basically</p>
<p>extinguish traumas or traumatic features</p>
<p>to real-life events,</p>
<p>we definitely want to know about them.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, well, I think one of the things</p>
<p>that people thought might help after a trauma,</p>
<p>like a school shooting or whatever,</p>
<p>car accident, is to talk about it,</p>
<p>but in fact, that ended up being counterproductive,</p>
<p>and I think one of the reasons why it was counterproductive</p>
<p>is because it didn&rsquo;t take them back down.</p>
<p>It brought them up and continued</p>
<p>to reactivate the emotions of it,</p>
<p>but then didn&rsquo;t emphasize the safety effect</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s over or help them work through</p>
<p>how they might avoid it again in the future</p>
<p>to calm the sympathetic nervous system down again</p>
<p>before they went to sleep,</p>
<p>and none of these studies has sleep ever been considered,</p>
<p>but to me, that&rsquo;s the key part,</p>
<p>is bringing down your sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>before you go to sleep</p>
<p>so that your sleep can be adaptive,</p>
<p>your locus relis can shut off</p>
<p>like it normally does or should do,</p>
<p>and then able to erase the novelty of it.</p>
<p>The other thing that I just mentioned a minute ago</p>
<p>was that the emotional system</p>
<p>is highly activated in REM sleep,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s definitely true,</p>
<p>and that might seem counterproductive</p>
<p>in terms of the nightmares</p>
<p>and how to help REM sleep be a therapeutic thing</p>
<p>rather than reinforcing the emotionality of the trauma,</p>
<p>and I think the key to that, again,</p>
<p>is the absence of norepinephrine,</p>
<p>so even though the emotional system is in high gear,</p>
<p>without norepinephrine,</p>
<p>you can actually divorce those highly activated emotions</p>
<p>from the cognitive parts of the memory</p>
<p>that you have just written out in that N2 stage of sleep</p>
<p>when the sleep spindles are going,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ve just now consolidated the information</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll need to survive and to make that adaptive,</p>
<p>and now you need to divorce from that schema</p>
<p>and from that semantic parts of memory the emotional part</p>
<p>because whenever you remember something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine if you remember being emotional at the time,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t wanna bring back,</p>
<p>and so into that memory,</p>
<p>all of the same emotional systems.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna bring back the heart rate changes</p>
<p>and the sweating and all of that.</p>
<p>You wanna be able to remember all the parts of it</p>
<p>and even remember that you were traumatized</p>
<p>and that you did cry</p>
<p>and that you did have, your heart was racing,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re talking about it years later,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna have to relive all that,</p>
<p>otherwise who would ever want to recall a traumatic memory</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re basically putting yourself</p>
<p>through the same trauma,</p>
<p>which is what people with PTSD have.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to recall this traumatic memory</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s reliving it like it&rsquo;s just happening again.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re thinking is that the emotional parts</p>
<p>are not able to be divorced</p>
<p>because the norepinephrine system</p>
<p>is not downscaled during REM sleep,</p>
<p>and so that REM sleep serves to instead reinforce</p>
<p>and in fact amplify the emotions</p>
<p>because your emotional system is up,</p>
<p>locus coeruleus is high,</p>
<p>re-sewing in every night the emotionality of those memories</p>
<p>and with the memory itself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve told us a lot about locus coeruleus</p>
<p>and norepinephrine from locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>Is there any role for norepinephrine, epinephrine,</p>
<p>and cortisol released from the adrenals?</p>
<p>My understanding is that norepinephrine and epinephrine</p>
<p>will not cross the blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>which is probably why we have a brain-based</p>
<p>noradrenergic system, locus coeruleus,</p>
<p>and other neurons as well.</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s a question I should ask you.</p>
<p>Are there other sites in the brain</p>
<p>where norepinephrine is released from,</p>
<p>or is it just locus coeruleus?</p>
<p>So there are seven, nine different adrenergic,</p>
<p>yes, there&rsquo;s nine different adrenergic structures.</p>
<p>I should know this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t ask, but it just occurred to me</p>
<p>that in some cases, like with Raphae,</p>
<p>there are other sources of serotonergic drive in the brain,</p>
<p>but Raphae is like the main site.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the one that goes to the cortex,</p>
<p>and the locus coeruleus is also the one</p>
<p>that goes to the cortex.</p>
<p>But there are other adrenergic sources,</p>
<p>some from the brainstem, that descend and help us</p>
<p>to ignore pain, for example, when we&rsquo;re stressed</p>
<p>and needing to run away from the tiger, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to be thinking, oh, my ankle hurts.</p>
<p>You know, you want to just be able to ignore it</p>
<p>and go do what you need to do.</p>
<p>So, yeah, so there are lots of other noradrenergic nuclei,</p>
<p>but the locus coeruleus is the main one</p>
<p>that projects all over the brain.</p>
<p>Actually, the only place it doesn&rsquo;t project</p>
<p>is the dorsal striatum.</p>
<p>You talked about ventral striatum and addiction.</p>
<p>The dorsal striatum is the only place</p>
<p>the locus coeruleus doesn&rsquo;t project to,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s involved in procedural learning, motor learning,</p>
<p>the kinds of learning that take over</p>
<p>when your hippocampus, for example, is compromised,</p>
<p>bilateral, if you don&rsquo;t have a good hippocampus,</p>
<p>you can still do procedural learning, and it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a redundant system.</p>
<p>And so if your locus coeruleus is not working,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have it anymore,</p>
<p>you can still do, if you don&rsquo;t have a good hippocampus,</p>
<p>you can still do learning</p>
<p>through this dorsal striatum structure.</p>
<p>So it might be for those kinds of learning functions.</p>
<p>Sleep deprivation, where you never let</p>
<p>the locus coeruleus stop firing, is okay</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have any receptors</p>
<p>for norepinephrine anyway, so yeah.</p>
<p>And what about bodily, like adrenals?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I often remind people there&rsquo;s no such thing</p>
<p>as adrenal burnout per se,</p>
<p>that adrenals don&rsquo;t actually burn out,</p>
<p>but some people have adrenal insufficiency syndrome.</p>
<p>Other people have adrenals</p>
<p>that are just chronically cranking out epinephrine,</p>
<p>norepinephrine, and cortisol</p>
<p>at the wrong times in particular.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So those are great questions,</p>
<p>and I think the answers to them have yet to be discovered,</p>
<p>the connections between our periphery</p>
<p>and our central nervous system,</p>
<p>but we know that there are beautiful connections,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s untapped source of being able</p>
<p>to manipulate our brains is to work through our bodies.</p>
<p>And so adrenals do great things,</p>
<p>they constrict our blood vessels,</p>
<p>causing higher blood pressure,</p>
<p>which help blood rush out to all the extremities</p>
<p>that need blood in our muscles, for example,</p>
<p>for running away from the lion or the tiger,</p>
<p>or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Or meeting a grant deadline.</p>
<p>Or meeting a grant deadline.</p>
<p>Or catching a train.</p>
<p>Or catching a train, yeah.</p>
<p>The adrenals help our hearts pump faster,</p>
<p>our muscles get perfused with the blood it needs,</p>
<p>it diverts blood and everything away</p>
<p>from our parasympathetic system,</p>
<p>which is rest and digest.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really need to digest that croissant</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re running for a train,</p>
<p>we can do that later.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s doing really important things.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t cross the blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>is how that affects the brain,</p>
<p>and whether our, if we can independently activate</p>
<p>our adrenals when a time when our brain</p>
<p>thinks that we should be fine and calm and asleep,</p>
<p>how our brain detects that.</p>
<p>Is it a feedback through, our heart is racing,</p>
<p>and then our brain stem says,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on, my heart is racing,</p>
<p>and then wakes us up.</p>
<p>And then our hearts were racing together</p>
<p>with our brain racing.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t know the answers to these questions yet.</p>
<p>There are some good studies, old studies,</p>
<p>but we need a lot more.</p>
<p>I will, another nod to the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s lots of great work ongoing,</p>
<p>and still to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to tell us about some of the work</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing more recently</p>
<p>on the relationship between sleep and opiate use.</p>
<p>Withdrawal, relapse, and craving,</p>
<p>just addiction generally.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions about people trying</p>
<p>to come off benzodiazepines,</p>
<p>or people&rsquo;s challenges with benzodiazepine</p>
<p>and other types of addiction.</p>
<p>What is the role of sleep in addiction</p>
<p>and recovery from addiction, and opiates in particular?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a very young area.</p>
<p>And in fact, my laboratory has just started.</p>
<p>I have a graduate student who&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>in my lab for just one year.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s done amazing work already,</p>
<p>but completely groundbreaking work.</p>
<p>And what she has discovered already,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the paper out yet,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re working on it,</p>
<p>is that when animals withdraw from opiates,</p>
<p>and this has been sort of replicated in other ways</p>
<p>with other types of things,</p>
<p>our sleep is disturbed.</p>
<p>Our sleep is terribly disturbed.</p>
<p>And the amount of sleep disturbance</p>
<p>predicts relapse behaviors.</p>
<p>And you might think, well, of course,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to relapse if you can&rsquo;t sleep</p>
<p>because opiates calm you down.</p>
<p>Well, one of the reasons why opiates calm you down</p>
<p>is because the locus aureolus, again,</p>
<p>loose fat, is covered with opiate receptors</p>
<p>that are normally really responsive</p>
<p>to our endogenous opiates.</p>
<p>And so what happens when we are pleased, for example,</p>
<p>or laughing or whatever,</p>
<p>our endogenous opiates activate those receptors</p>
<p>in the locus aureolus and calm it down.</p>
<p>And it actually suppresses locus aureolus activity,</p>
<p>makes us happy and relaxed.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why opiates are so addictive</p>
<p>is because it also calms us down and makes us relaxed.</p>
<p>But the problem with exogenous opiates</p>
<p>is that they really strongly bind these receptors</p>
<p>on our locus aureolus.</p>
<p>And if you take exogenous opiates again and again,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re recovering from surgery, for example,</p>
<p>take these pain medications,</p>
<p>is that our locus aureolus struggles</p>
<p>to do what it&rsquo;s supposed to do,</p>
<p>which is keep us awake and learning</p>
<p>and concentrating on things.</p>
<p>So it will down-regulate,</p>
<p>it will internalize these receptors</p>
<p>that are normally only occupied by endogenous opiates.</p>
<p>And it will do this, it will change our genes</p>
<p>that are associated with producing these receptors.</p>
<p>So you actually have very many fewer receptors.</p>
<p>So the locus aureolus, at least during wakefulness,</p>
<p>can fire and help us to do these things</p>
<p>like learn about our environment.</p>
<p>And so if you long-term reduce</p>
<p>the number of receptors out there,</p>
<p>then when you withdraw the exogenous opiates,</p>
<p>there is not enough of your endogenous opiates</p>
<p>to be able to occupy those few receptors that are there.</p>
<p>And our locus aureolus has nothing to calm it down anymore,</p>
<p>no pacifier, and it just fires and fires and fires.</p>
<p>And that phasic and tonic high activity stresses us out</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s normally associated with stress.</p>
<p>And so any exogenous stressor that adds to that</p>
<p>and also activates our locus aureolus,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to calm it down again.</p>
<p>And so it just keeps firing, it disturbs our sleep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why maybe sleep disturbance</p>
<p>is an indicator of a hyperactive locus aureolus</p>
<p>and such a good predictor of relapsed behaviors</p>
<p>because nobody likes to live in that high stress state</p>
<p>and they will do anything to get back to normal.</p>
<p>So the problem with taking these drugs</p>
<p>is that it leaves you excited,</p>
<p>or sorry, excited, relaxed and happy.</p>
<p>But then when you come off of it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re worse than when you were at baseline.</p>
<p>You take it again, it only brings you up this far</p>
<p>because you have fewer receptors.</p>
<p>When you come off it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re down even more depressed and anxious.</p>
<p>And depressed is a word I use loosely</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not what I say.</p>
<p>Certainly central nervous system depression.</p>
<p>I mean, sleepier, less motivated, lower mood.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, our locus aureolus is actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the anxiety kind of depression,</p>
<p>actually the anxiety related depression.</p>
<p>So yeah, so we don&rsquo;t know yet what,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some good research going on right now,</p>
<p>what could restore our own endogenous receptors</p>
<p>so that our endogenous opiates</p>
<p>can properly calm our locus aureolus.</p>
<p>Once that they&rsquo;ve been tamped down by exogenous opiates,</p>
<p>but that would be really one way</p>
<p>that you can access the sleep disturbance.</p>
<p>So we talked about sleep and the importance of sleep</p>
<p>in terms of learning and memory,</p>
<p>the importance of the structure of the 90 minute cycle</p>
<p>for all of that.</p>
<p>So you can imagine if your sleep is disturbed</p>
<p>by too much locus aureolus activity,</p>
<p>the structure and the function of those sleep spindles</p>
<p>and that theta during REM sleep</p>
<p>and the lack of norepinephrine,</p>
<p>all of those structures, all those functions</p>
<p>for learning something new,</p>
<p>like a new behavior that doesn&rsquo;t involve the drugs</p>
<p>becomes compromised.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s something that Tanya Lugo</p>
<p>is in collaboration with Pamela Kennedy at UCLA</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>How is learning and memory affected</p>
<p>by the sleep disturbance?</p>
<p>If there are way we can,</p>
<p>in animals that have coming off of opiates,</p>
<p>can we restore their sleep to normal</p>
<p>so that then they are less likely</p>
<p>to do relapse kinds of behaviors?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>And I will certainly have to have you back on</p>
<p>to tell us the results of those studies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I think for anyone who&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to come off exogenous opiates and restore these systems,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m hearing is that it&rsquo;s going to take some time,</p>
<p>but that any and all things that people can do</p>
<p>to buffer their healthy, normal sleep architecture,</p>
<p>like morning and daytime sunlight,</p>
<p>limiting bright light exposure,</p>
<p>lowering the temperature at night,</p>
<p>a number of things that we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>on this podcast.</p>
<p>Calming yourself, deep breathing exercises,</p>
<p>meditation, whatever it is</p>
<p>that helps you calm yourself before sleep, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, would facilitate not just sleep,</p>
<p>but perhaps even accelerate the recovery</p>
<p>and shorten this period of withdrawal,</p>
<p>which from the questions I get and from what I hear</p>
<p>can be absolutely brutal.</p>
<p>Yeah, oh, I can imagine.</p>
<p>I had to take opiates for,</p>
<p>I only took it for three days</p>
<p>after giving birth to my first son, I think,</p>
<p>second son, one of them.</p>
<p>And I just said, after three days, this is enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to try Tylenol.</p>
<p>And so I weaned myself, not weaned,</p>
<p>I just did a sudden sharp cutoff.</p>
<p>And even though I felt I didn&rsquo;t get the high of opiates</p>
<p>when I was taking the Tylenol codeine,</p>
<p>when I went off it, boy, it was like PMS times 100.</p>
<p>I was so anxious and upset at little things.</p>
<p>It thankfully only lasted a few hours,</p>
<p>but if I had taken it for a week or two weeks,</p>
<p>who knows if my endogenous opiate receptors</p>
<p>would have been permanently down-regulated</p>
<p>and I would have been an addict, you know,</p>
<p>an addict, I would have been addicted.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t say an addict, there&rsquo;s negative connotations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a very physiological state.</p>
<p>So no judgments at all associated with it.</p>
<p>So yeah, they&rsquo;re powerful, powerful painkillers,</p>
<p>but can also alter your entire brain and rewire it, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, all the more reason why I and many others</p>
<p>are grateful that you&rsquo;re doing this work</p>
<p>to figure out ways that people can recover</p>
<p>more quickly and more thoroughly.</p>
<p>I must say, you&rsquo;ve taught us a tremendous amount</p>
<p>in a relatively short amount of time</p>
<p>about the architecture of sleep, the different phases,</p>
<p>the relationship between sleep and dreaming</p>
<p>and this incredible structure, locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so happy we also got into the pons</p>
<p>that just delights me because we rarely talk</p>
<p>about the pons on this podcast,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s such an interesting structure.</p>
<p>Sex differences that are important in creativity</p>
<p>and problem-solving and trauma, sleep spindles,</p>
<p>just such a wealth of information</p>
<p>and much of it that&rsquo;s actionable for people.</p>
<p>So first of all, I want to say thank you</p>
<p>for taking the time to sit down</p>
<p>and have this conversation</p>
<p>that so many people are sure to benefit from.</p>
<p>I also want to thank you for doing the work you do,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;m a fellow neurobiologist,</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s not often that we take a step back</p>
<p>and realize that it&rsquo;s really the work of hard thinking,</p>
<p>hard, strongly motivated PIs,</p>
<p>stands for principal investigator, by the way,</p>
<p>PIs like yourself, graduate students and postdocs</p>
<p>that really drive the discovery forward</p>
<p>and that lead to these new therapeutics.</p>
<p>Physicians are wonderful,</p>
<p>clinicians are absolutely wonderful,</p>
<p>but clinicians don&rsquo;t develop new treatments.</p>
<p>They only implement the ones that researchers discover.</p>
<p>So thank you for being a brain explorer</p>
<p>with a focus on growing the good in the world.</p>
<p>I know I speak for everybody when I say thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Andrew.</p>
<p>Thank you for being an amazing interviewer.</p>
<p>You brought a lot out of me in a coherent fashion</p>
<p>that normally I can&rsquo;t do when I&rsquo;m speaking in public.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard your lectures and they&rsquo;re superb.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll direct people to some of the other ones.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>And I also want to put a plug in for graduate students</p>
<p>in general and the key and amazing role</p>
<p>that they play in research.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a PI, as you said.</p>
<p>I used to be a graduate student and a postdoc trainee myself</p>
<p>doing all of this on the ground, hands-on experimentation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to do right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to think through all of that.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m a PI, I get to be an idea person</p>
<p>and just say, hey, why don&rsquo;t you do this?</p>
<p>And hey, what do you think about that?</p>
<p>And they, of course, intellectually contribute so much</p>
<p>to these planned experiments,</p>
<p>but they also do the really hard work.</p>
<p>And so I just want to say thank you, graduate students.</p>
<p>Thank you to my graduate students</p>
<p>and all graduate students out there.</p>
<p>Thank you, postdocs.</p>
<p>Who are all underpaid and to the major institutions,</p>
<p>Stanford, UCLA, and all other major institutions,</p>
<p>pay them more, please.</p>
<p>We need them and they need to have a standard of living.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid to say that despite my primary employer.</p>
<p>Pay them more.</p>
<p>They need it.</p>
<p>They deserve it.</p>
<p>They deserve it, absolutely.</p>
<p>Great, well, we will absolutely have you back again</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ll be willing.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, we will direct people</p>
<p>to where they can learn more about you</p>
<p>and your exciting work.</p>
<p>And once again, thanks so much.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me today for my discussion</p>
<p>about sleep, mental health, physical health,</p>
<p>and performance with Dr. Gina Poe.</p>
<p>I hope you found it to be as informative</p>
<p>and as actionable as I did.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m already implementing the regularity</p>
<p>of bedtime plus or minus half an hour</p>
<p>in order to get that growth hormone release.</p>
<p>And I can already see both my sleep scores improving</p>
<p>and my feelings of daytime vigor and focus</p>
<p>and other markers of sleep health improving as well.</p>

<p>On the Huberman Lab podcast, we often discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like enhancing the quality and duration of sleep,</p>
<p>for enhancing focus, and for hormone support.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to announce</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve partnered with Momentous Supplements.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that for several reasons.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>Momentous Supplements are of the very highest quality.</p>
<p>Second of all,</p>
<p>they mainly focus on single ingredient formulations,</p>
<p>which is absolutely key</p>
<p>if you want to develop a supplement regimen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s most biologically and cost-effective.</p>
<p>It, for instance, allows you to alternate dosages</p>
<p>across days, to change the dosages</p>
<p>of individual ingredients, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>In addition, Momentous Supplements ship internationally,</p>
<p>which we know is important</p>
<p>because many of you reside outside of the United States.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements discussed</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>please go to LiveMomentous, spelled O-U-S,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s livemomentous.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you can get a 20% discount on any of those supplements.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s livemomentous.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast has a zero-cost newsletter</p>
<p>that includes summaries of podcast episodes and toolkits,</p>
<p>so checklists of actionable tools that you can use</p>
<p>for all aspects of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>You can access this completely zero-cost</p>
<p>by going to HubermanLab.com,</p>
<p>go to the menu, and scroll down to Newsletter.</p>
<p>Just put in your email.</p>
<p>We do not share your email with anybody,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get our monthly newsletter,</p>
<p>and there are also some examples of previous newsletters</p>
<p>also there at HubermanLab.com.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following me on social media,</p>
<p>it is Huberman Lab on all platforms,</p>
<p>Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn,</p>
<p>and at all of those places,</p>
<p>I cover science and science-related tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlap with the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but much of which is distinct</p>
<p>from the Huberman Lab podcast content.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.</p>
<p>Thank you again for joining me for today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>with Dr. Gina Poh, all about sleep and its relationship</p>
<p>to mental health, physical health, and performance,</p>
<p>and last but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
