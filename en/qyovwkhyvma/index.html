<p>kidding it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re in Virginia but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very close so I want to take get right</p>
<p>into it because there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>call-outs already so the first caller</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna take is NIDA you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Orlando go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>yes yes thank you dr. Byrd lower my</p>
<p>blood pressure it&rsquo;s a few months and it</p>
<p>has and I do know that you recommend the</p>
<p>d3 k2 for high blood pressure my</p>
<p>question is a - I know it removes the</p>
<p>calcium in the blood system but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the k2 form the blood clot that how</p>
<p>would that help lower blood pressure</p>
<p>yeah good question so there&rsquo;s two things</p>
<p>number one the vitamin k2 removes soft</p>
<p>tissue calcium from the arteries so</p>
<p>thereby making the arteries more elastic</p>
<p>so really it&rsquo;s about making your</p>
<p>arteries more elastic so they can not be</p>
<p>so rigid because when the blood pressure</p>
<p>comes in what causes a lot of times high</p>
<p>blood pressure is the arteries are just</p>
<p>basically hardened and so the blood</p>
<p>pressure goes up because they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>compensate so now will it cause clotting</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s k1 not k2 alright so and we</p>
<p>need vitamin k1 so it&rsquo;s you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to be afraid of taking k1 that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>holder for another seminar or talk</p>
<p>because vitamin there&rsquo;s a coumadin which</p>
<p>the people are taking to prevent blood</p>
<p>clots but that&rsquo;s a whole different</p>
<p>situation I have some videos on it so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t to be afraid of taking k2 and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna clot at all it basically</p>
<p>removes soft tissue calcium it works</p>
<p>with vitamin d3 and it works really good</p>
<p>now that being said the other thing that</p>
<p>you really need to do NIDA is for blood</p>
<p>pressure is lower your insulin and I</p>
<p>have a ton of videos on this really</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s behind it it&rsquo;s called insulin</p>
<p>resistance and that&rsquo;s the situation</p>
<p>where the body has too much insulin so</p>
<p>resist it because it&rsquo;s trying to prevent</p>
<p>you from putting too many refined carbs</p>
<p>and sugar into the cell and that signals</p>
<p>the pancreas to go out we&rsquo;re low in</p>
<p>insulin and glucose so let&rsquo;s increase</p>
<p>more so now we have situation we produce</p>
<p>more insulin that&rsquo;s why diabetics have</p>
<p>high blood pressure a lot more than</p>
<p>people who are not diabetics so you need</p>
<p>to cut out the refined carbs you need to</p>
<p>consume a lot of potassium foods</p>
<p>potassium will also lower blood pressure</p>
<p>as well but you need a lot you need a</p>
<p>huge huge bowl probably minimum seven</p>
<p>cups a day ok so the combination of that</p>
<p>and then to put the icing on the cake my</p>
<p>project in Denmark cake you want to do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting so that is going to</p>
<p>also drop insulin because you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>less frequently and every time you eat</p>
<p>increases insulin so we don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>that so the point is we want to have</p>
<p>start with three meals a day no snacks</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard add fat to the meal to go</p>
<p>longer between the meal so you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hungry</p>
<p>do that for about three weeks and then</p>
<p>start kind of slowly pushing your</p>
<p>breakfast towards lunch so now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating later and later and later for</p>
<p>breakfast and in fact don&rsquo;t eat if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not hungry the goal is to be able</p>
<p>to go as long as you can in the morning</p>
<p>to have your first meal and then have</p>
<p>one more at dinner if you did that I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s almost a guarantee that lower</p>
<p>your blood pressure but of course</p>
<p>anything that I&rsquo;m saying in this</p>
<p>presentation I&rsquo;m not meant to diagnose</p>
<p>or cure you or make any claims get with</p>
<p>your doctor before you know you take</p>
<p>action in any of the recommendations</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s my disclaimer but anyway</p>
<p>take that do the research and watch the</p>
<p>videos and in a minute fasting all right</p>
<p>thanks so now we have a call from</p>
<p>Vanessa you&rsquo;re from California Orange</p>
<p>County go ahead good morning dr. Burt</p>
<p>thank you for taking my call um</p>
<p>currently I&rsquo;m taking your insulin Coco</p>
<p>support go platters and um and then the</p>
<p>electrolyte and these apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar along with the k2 and d3 and the</p>
<p>multi vitamins</p>
<p>now I also doing the ketogenic eating</p>
<p>plan and intermittent fasting I</p>
<p>experienced it&rsquo;s been three months going</p>
<p>on to the whole program and I</p>
<p>experienced some muscle loss um</p>
<p>low energy some time I people to work</p>
<p>out some time I jump especially if I</p>
<p>joined it like aerobic class I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like keep up with people basically</p>
<p>running up and down you know at that</p>
<p>space and then I also experience some</p>
<p>like cramps and sour stomach once in a</p>
<p>while oh I&rsquo;m sorry the most philosophers</p>
<p>like totally my I use up muscle as I do</p>
<p>workout before and now it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>hanging my arms and oh and also my legs</p>
<p>when I walk up stairs really you know</p>
<p>heavy just like you described on video</p>
<p>okay good so Vanessa tell me what when&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your first meal what time is your first</p>
<p>meal so I don&rsquo;t it could I couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>these 16 hours bad thing it&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>about 12 to 14 when&rsquo;s your first meal</p>
<p>well in the morning it&rsquo;s probably time</p>
<p>between 9:00 to 10:00 okay and what do</p>
<p>you we and I worked up what do you yes</p>
<p>so the mix of usually two legs and I</p>
<p>measure the three pounds three ounces of</p>
<p>protein and I&rsquo;m sorry 50 of 50 ounces of</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>you got a fat it divide it I follow you</p>
<p>yeah yeah Vanessa real quickly just tell</p>
<p>me Vanessa so just for a time just real</p>
<p>quickly so you have eggs in the morning</p>
<p>then when&rsquo;s the next meal usually eggs</p>
<p>in protein and fat in the morning okay</p>
<p>what do you have any more lucky not eggs</p>
<p>but usually why do we kill juice I do a</p>
<p>lot of family</p>
<p>in this day but I do the most opinion so</p>
<p>I usually add some protein which is fish</p>
<p>some beef from the bacon but I usually</p>
<p>have some fat to it and coconut fat good</p>
<p>and then what&rsquo;s the next time you eat so</p>
<p>usually about maybe seven or eight seven</p>
<p>five okay all depends yes I&rsquo;m within you</p>
<p>know the twelve hours is forty-nine</p>
<p>what do you have for dinner oh I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>that was my dinner which is probably</p>
<p>some vegetables mixed vegetables and</p>
<p>again I also incorporate the proteins</p>
<p>and if fat that takes up nuts that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>well nuts okay good now question do you</p>
<p>crave anything not really into sometimes</p>
<p>you know I started with the chia pudding</p>
<p>your recipes and I love that so I have</p>
<p>to use mmm do you crave anything much no</p>
<p>well I would say the most part no I mean</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally doing like 90% of what I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t use the eating a little bit okay</p>
<p>what do you cheat with well if I do my I</p>
<p>mix my protein powder sometimes I then</p>
<p>have a little bit sugar I try to cut it</p>
<p>though you know big thick grass and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t wanna throw in for the protein</p>
<p>okay all right so Vanessa so let me just</p>
<p>kind of tell you give you some tips on</p>
<p>this this is good that this came up</p>
<p>because this happens to a lot of people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re experiencing muscle loss it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>real interesting with this whole keto</p>
<p>you have these keto energy you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running your body in ketosis versus a</p>
<p>glucose</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really an all-or-none it won&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>with a little bit of too many fruits or</p>
<p>sugar or it just won&rsquo;t work because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to knock you out of ketosis</p>
<p>so to fix that I would go a hundred</p>
<p>percent on board without any fruits</p>
<p>because even if myself I had some proof</p>
<p>or added some hidden sugar the next day</p>
<p>or so or even three days I don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>quite right I mean occasionally I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>like one time I have a great for it just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t feel quite right so it&rsquo;s at the</p>
<p>point is that I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re fully</p>
<p>in a hundred percent of ketosis that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I think now the fact that you um it</p>
<p>sounds like the meals are okay but the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>only at the first stage which is three</p>
<p>meals and they&rsquo;re pretty far apart so I</p>
<p>think you just have to work towards</p>
<p>having an earlier dinner and a later</p>
<p>breakfast to start working on that</p>
<p>because intermittent fasting we want to</p>
<p>shoot for a four hour window but we</p>
<p>might stick with that eight hour window</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not I think you&rsquo;re like nine</p>
<p>and then seven that&rsquo;s pretty wide so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start shortening that in</p>
<p>a minute fasting to the point where you</p>
<p>can do it more and more so you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>just in the transition phase yet and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably why the muscles are not</p>
<p>being salvaged or maintained as well so</p>
<p>as long as you can tighten up that</p>
<p>little thing where you&rsquo;re having more in</p>
<p>a minute fasting and you&rsquo;re truly not</p>
<p>cheating in between it&rsquo;s going to work</p>
<p>but you have to really do it a hundred</p>
<p>percent that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>thanks Vanessa hey Arlene you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Delaware go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air I</p>
<p>have a question for you my husband he</p>
<p>has COPD and you cost an awful lot and</p>
<p>they have him on a few different</p>
<p>inhalers and we&rsquo;re going away we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going through Mexico and I wanted to</p>
<p>know what we can do for him and is it</p>
<p>safe for him to fly and I also have</p>
<p>cellulite in my leg and I wanted to know</p>
<p>is it safe for me to fly and what can I</p>
<p>do and my last question is um a fishy</p>
<p>odor that I have when I when I urinate</p>
<p>it what does that mean and what can I do</p>
<p>about it okay</p>
<p>question I have are you doing the</p>
<p>ketogenic in a minute fasting at all yet</p>
<p>absolutely okay not my husband trying to</p>
<p>get him I am okay great thanks</p>
<p>so Arlene let&rsquo;s first talk about your</p>
<p>husband the long</p>
<p>I think this trips gonna be very healthy</p>
<p>for him because especially if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of sun vitamin D is the key vitamin</p>
<p>for the lung because vitamin D acts like</p>
<p>a hormone and it can it helps improve</p>
<p>the adrenal hormones cortisol so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really great thing for asthma lung</p>
<p>conditions emphysema COPD oh my gosh so</p>
<p>we do high levels of that now the other</p>
<p>thing that can cause lung problems is</p>
<p>mold or fungus that&rsquo;s living in the</p>
<p>lungs so if he was exposed like</p>
<p>something in the basement if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>case that would be a situation where if</p>
<p>he and I&rsquo;m not recommending taking an</p>
<p>antifungal but he&rsquo;d probably feel better</p>
<p>and then it comes back so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>oregano</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s oregano pearls it&rsquo;s in these little</p>
<p>pearls you can get it online or help the</p>
<p>store take these little pearls take that</p>
<p>and in higher amounts that will start</p>
<p>killing off any mold or fungus in the</p>
<p>lungs so that&rsquo;s another thing you can do</p>
<p>high levels of natural vitamin C foods</p>
<p>are going to be key he&rsquo;s going to have</p>
<p>to cut out the sugar supplement wise</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a supplement that I would highly</p>
<p>recommend for the it basically supports</p>
<p>like adrenal kind of a low adrenal and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called adrenal fatigue advanced</p>
<p>formula I think that would really help</p>
<p>him to kind of make make this transition</p>
<p>really nice as far as cellulite goes</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s several videos you can watch but</p>
<p>in a thumbnail sketch cellulite is a</p>
<p>combination of atrophy in the muscles</p>
<p>and actual fat but it&rsquo;s a combination so</p>
<p>from my experience you can get rid of</p>
<p>cellulite unless you&rsquo;re on a very active</p>
<p>exercise program for you know get a</p>
<p>personal trainer or something just to</p>
<p>start working on those muscles because</p>
<p>the muscle starts losing the tone</p>
<p>especially when you get in your 30s 40s</p>
<p>and 50s and</p>
<p>has to be toned up to really make get</p>
<p>rid of the atrophy it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>especially as you go to menopause the</p>
<p>adrenals start kicking in and make</p>
<p>making the muscles just really loosen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just all fat so and the problem</p>
<p>is with exercise is that it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>difficult to target fat exactly in your</p>
<p>hips or thighs it&rsquo;ll go in the stomach</p>
<p>first and then eventually in the thighs</p>
<p>so the combination will eventually get</p>
<p>you there of maintaining the ketogenic</p>
<p>and imminent fasting and then adding</p>
<p>some serious exercise in there as well I</p>
<p>would do if you can do at high interval</p>
<p>training high intense interval training</p>
<p>yeah and the fish order what that means</p>
<p>is that you need more greens to flush</p>
<p>out some of the waste that&rsquo;s coming out</p>
<p>probably from the liver so I would add</p>
<p>more leafy greens parsley beet tops the</p>
<p>cruciferous put them in a kale shake</p>
<p>maybe a little berries and I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do very well thanks okay so</p>
<p>a man from San Francisco you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>air go ahead good morning I much for</p>
<p>taking my call mmm I really appreciate</p>
<p>you so much and thank you so much for</p>
<p>all your videos you are an amazing</p>
<p>teacher my question is about slow</p>
<p>learning I would like to know your</p>
<p>thoughts about it and if there is any</p>
<p>way to solve this problem by taking some</p>
<p>some some supplements or food and then</p>
<p>the second question is about hearing</p>
<p>problems actually I feel like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really hear very well mm-hmm and that</p>
<p>could be the reason for slow learning</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry what did you say</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m just kidding I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>sometimes I do that yeah yeah the third</p>
<p>question is about feeling called I feel</p>
<p>called all the time I don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>hey are you doing the in a minute</p>
<p>fasting in ketosis are you doing that</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>about three years ago oh that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>awesome okay</p>
<p>so a couple things I want to talk about</p>
<p>slow learning there&rsquo;s two things as you</p>
<p>do the ketogenic in a minute fasting it</p>
<p>really supports more than anything the</p>
<p>nerve cell the nerve cells will actually</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ketones are neural protective</p>
<p>especially in the area of what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the hippocampus which is the kind of the</p>
<p>relay switch with with the with the part</p>
<p>of the mind that actually affects</p>
<p>learning which I&rsquo;m not going to get into</p>
<p>at this point but the point is the relay</p>
<p>switch so you you can improve that</p>
<p>memory prevent cognitive dysfunction</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>especially spatial rememberings like</p>
<p>location in time in space that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>one in a memory and then learning those</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the kind of a center so ketones</p>
<p>are going to support that greatly</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna reduce stress on the</p>
<p>neurons versus the glucose so I think</p>
<p>you need to keep going in that area and</p>
<p>add exercise and then make sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing in a minute fasting pretty</p>
<p>hardcore two meals a day that being said</p>
<p>you still have learning problems I</p>
<p>recommend that you email my office dr.</p>
<p>Burke Dr Berg at dr. Berg comm and ask</p>
<p>asks just to have them routed to me</p>
<p>regarding um something I&rsquo;m learning</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a I learned how to study after I</p>
<p>graduated from grad school a little late</p>
<p>than ever but in school they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really teach us how to learn so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a technology of how to learn and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually refer you to a book that I</p>
<p>recommend because they don&rsquo;t teach how</p>
<p>to learn it&rsquo;s all about memorization so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually some barriers of</p>
<p>learning that you can find out about to</p>
<p>really pick up your ability to grasp and</p>
<p>digest information versus just looking</p>
<p>at a page for a half-hour it&rsquo;s just not</p>
<p>going in so it could be a not</p>
<p>necessarily your neurons it could be</p>
<p>basically you just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never been taught how to learn</p>
<p>something effectively and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>talking about memorization or speed</p>
<p>reading so email us at dr. Burke at Gena</p>
<p>if you want to know more</p>
<p>book and as a side now now as far as</p>
<p>feeling cold goes you need to that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>normally it&rsquo;s thyroid okay so it could</p>
<p>also be other things as well but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just talk about the thyroid it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>unlikely that you have a primary thought</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually coming secondary from a</p>
<p>gallbladder liver issue so to improve</p>
<p>that you can take some bile salts to</p>
<p>help the conversion of t4 to t3 a lot of</p>
<p>times that works sometimes you have to</p>
<p>add iodine from seek help sometimes you</p>
<p>have to add selenium and then lastly</p>
<p>estrogen if your estrogen is too high if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dominant that can block the thyroid</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s just other things that you</p>
<p>need to look at to increase your your a</p>
<p>thermostat there so go ahead and do that</p>
<p>and then let me know how you do Thanks</p>
<p>so Amy you&rsquo;re from Atlanta go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air I am doctor bird of</p>
<p>your pizza oh good thanks I began my</p>
<p>keto diet four weeks ago I&rsquo;ve used your</p>
<p>videos as my guide I&rsquo;m doing really well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve transitioned on to two meals a day</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m still meeting a snack between my</p>
<p>first meals about 10:00 a.m. in the</p>
<p>morning and then dinner between 4:00 and</p>
<p>5:00 but I I&rsquo;m still getting a little</p>
<p>hungry in the afternoon around noon so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having a list of snacks my</p>
<p>question to you is this I know I watched</p>
<p>your video on protein bars but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one specific one called a quest bar is</p>
<p>it okay to include on my snack list</p>
<p>there a protein bar but they only have</p>
<p>about five net carbs good question</p>
<p>the question I have for you so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically you&rsquo;re trying to do two meals</p>
<p>a day right yes okay got it alright I</p>
<p>get a little hungry in the afternoon and</p>
<p>a little bit tired so I found that just</p>
<p>having a little salad or snack just</p>
<p>helps me get to that extra three hours</p>
<p>and then I do the fasting from around</p>
<p>4:30 5 o&rsquo;clock until 10 o&rsquo;clock the next</p>
<p>morning and I do okay I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing overall really really good so let</p>
<p>me just kind of answer that I think that</p>
<p>I think this is going to take some time</p>
<p>to get to the point where you can fully</p>
<p>adapt and start beefing up your</p>
<p>like this a little bit bigger and adding</p>
<p>maybe a whole avocado or more potassium</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s number one the other thing that</p>
<p>you may want to try is right around</p>
<p>lunch have a big huge salad okay so do</p>
<p>the salad part at lunch the other thing</p>
<p>you can do is the quest bar you can try</p>
<p>that too I would prefer the salad but</p>
<p>the quest bar if you still experience</p>
<p>good results with the quest bar then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find most people are do fine on</p>
<p>the sugar alcohols quest bar is probably</p>
<p>one of the only bars that has like a</p>
<p>very low net carb some of these other</p>
<p>ones don&rsquo;t so I&rsquo;m familiar with the</p>
<p>quest bar I guess there&rsquo;s only one</p>
<p>ingredient that I not crazy about it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s a type of and I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>non-gmo but it&rsquo;s a type of corn soluble</p>
<p>fiber which is has the very zero</p>
<p>glycemic index but it it tends to create</p>
<p>a lot of bloating okay so but try it out</p>
<p>you may be very successful on that so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not opposed to it you can try it out</p>
<p>try the salad now but given more time</p>
<p>till eventually you fully key to adapt</p>
<p>to the point where you can do that and</p>
<p>then also try to beef up your fat for</p>
<p>breakfast and you were potassium from</p>
<p>the avocados thanks Andy</p>
<p>hey D you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from New</p>
<p>Jersey Oh</p>
<p>grateful to find your videos I just</p>
<p>discovered you a few weeks ago so my</p>
<p>first question is about my dad he has an</p>
<p>inguinal hernia and he&rsquo;s up in aged over</p>
<p>90 and he doesn&rsquo;t want to have surgery</p>
<p>so he wanted to know if there are any</p>
<p>recommendations that you have for that</p>
<p>and also my other question is about you</p>
<p>did a video with your wife called the</p>
<p>healthiest bread ever in the world and</p>
<p>you said that be wheat bread if you make</p>
<p>your own wheat bread it&rsquo;ll last six days</p>
<p>because though the bread in the store is</p>
<p>dead but you don&rsquo;t recommend it so I had</p>
<p>already bought our wheat know to make my</p>
<p>own bread and then but my so my question</p>
<p>is isn&rsquo;t the almond flour and the flour</p>
<p>and all that stuff already did also</p>
<p>cause her</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been on the shelves also</p>
<p>good question good okay so let me answer</p>
<p>those let&rsquo;s start with the herniation</p>
<p>herniation is it&rsquo;s basically a loss of</p>
<p>college and connected tissue and you</p>
<p>have a lot of disorders that are</p>
<p>collagen problems hernias and your</p>
<p>rhythms also even lesions in the</p>
<p>arteries like little holes leaky gut is</p>
<p>a college and disorder and I believe</p>
<p>that the root of all those is basically</p>
<p>a vitamin C deficiency let me explain</p>
<p>vitamin C is the key vitamin to help</p>
<p>synthesize or make collagen so when your</p>
<p>vitamin C deficient you lose the</p>
<p>structure like even in the colon for</p>
<p>example the gaps normally should be like</p>
<p>1 to 7 microns which are really small</p>
<p>Nick you got you&rsquo;re like 200 300 microns</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like huge holes so you got the</p>
<p>Sunda just the protein that goes in</p>
<p>there and develops allergies and you</p>
<p>start getting all sorts of food</p>
<p>allergies but the point is with the</p>
<p>aneurysm it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s usually about even C</p>
<p>deficiency now you say well I I take</p>
<p>vitamin C well number one most people</p>
<p>take a synthetic from ascorbic acid and</p>
<p>that is not the part of the vitamin C</p>
<p>complex that you need in nature vitamin</p>
<p>C comes with a lot of different parts</p>
<p>specifically bioflavonoids it&rsquo;s the bow</p>
<p>flavonoids like rootin and bioflavonoids</p>
<p>and flavonoids which are mainly and like</p>
<p>a lot of the cruciferous lemon peel the</p>
<p>best bioflavonoids on the planet would</p>
<p>be buckwheat sprouted buckwheat but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d get it in a supplement and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other ones as well like parsley has</p>
<p>loaded onions are loaded with that all</p>
<p>that is very high in vitamin C the part</p>
<p>that you need or your your father needs</p>
<p>to help repair the collagen okay laughs</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two of the things that will</p>
<p>deplete vitamin C number one insulin</p>
<p>resistance so that&rsquo;s sugar okay</p>
<p>so that has to be corrected and the last</p>
<p>thing is smoking so smoking blocks</p>
<p>vitamin C I think one cigarette will</p>
<p>deplete you of 25</p>
<p>milligrams of vitamin C so if he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>smoker that could be a situation all</p>
<p>right so that&rsquo;s what I would do to</p>
<p>recommend that now as far as the</p>
<p>healthiest bread in the world</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna make bread it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>hard to make the texture the recipe I</p>
<p>have is like the texture is like amazing</p>
<p>you probably already tried it it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>incredible there is one ingredient in</p>
<p>there called arrowroot which is slightly</p>
<p>high glycemic but your take you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>so small amounts that it&rsquo;s really a</p>
<p>minor point okay and I&rsquo;m not saying you</p>
<p>know you can just have it every so often</p>
<p>as well but it&rsquo;s a really good bread the</p>
<p>almond flour is very low glycemic so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be fine it&rsquo;s from a nut but</p>
<p>the UM the the bread that you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about is the wheat bread and I was I</p>
<p>actually mentioned some my older videos</p>
<p>if you take whole wheat berries and you</p>
<p>grind them yourself and you make your</p>
<p>own bread</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna retain a lot of the B</p>
<p>vitamins okay so because they go bad</p>
<p>after six days because they oxidize well</p>
<p>I was only talking about the nutrient</p>
<p>value in bread like getting some</p>
<p>nutrition from it what I didn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about in that video is that it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>gonna be high glycemic it&rsquo;s still not</p>
<p>okay on a ketogenic diet that&rsquo;s why so</p>
<p>yes the brown the almond flour were not</p>
<p>necessarily consuming that for nutrients</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re consuming it for keeping our carbs</p>
<p>low so yes we have lost some nutrients</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s ground down but the point</p>
<p>on the whole wheat is that as soon as</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ground into flour you lose the</p>
<p>vitamins pretty quick so all this bread</p>
<p>in the store it&rsquo;s made from flour that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been sitting in the shelf for a long</p>
<p>long time so it&rsquo;s very low in nutrients</p>
<p>so I hope that answered that question</p>
<p>hey Leslie you&rsquo;re from Puerto Rico go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the air yes good morning</p>
<p>mr. Gargan thank you for your time sure</p>
<p>my question is of all the coconut sugar</p>
<p>in the ketogenic diet so what I want to</p>
<p>know about the coconut sugar</p>
<p>oh the</p>
<p>okay got it mm-hmm yeah yeah yeah the</p>
<p>coconut sugar unfortunately is pretty</p>
<p>darn high now it&rsquo;s not as bad as table</p>
<p>sugar but it&rsquo;s probably you know 20%</p>
<p>less so it&rsquo;s it has a lot of good</p>
<p>potassium and nutrients but just like</p>
<p>molasses it&rsquo;s still very high in sugar</p>
<p>and that will keep you from going into</p>
<p>ketosis because the carbohydrates are</p>
<p>too high they&rsquo;re the sugar and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just too high so you even know you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s things like honey and agave</p>
<p>nectar and some of these so-called</p>
<p>natural sweeteners there&rsquo;s still not</p>
<p>really good for a ketogenic diet because</p>
<p>the amount of sugar even if you take</p>
<p>coconut water</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty high in sugar so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recommend that either even though it has</p>
<p>vitamins like potassium like 300</p>
<p>milligrams so yeah sorry about that</p>
<p>hey Victoria you&rsquo;re from Arizona go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the air hi thank you so</p>
<p>much for taking my call sure I just</p>
<p>wanted to ask my sister and I have been</p>
<p>doing the ketogenic diet for gosh like</p>
<p>February my sister has been going</p>
<p>through a ton of like life-changing</p>
<p>stresses and it was all happening all</p>
<p>ones we&rsquo;re doing a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>adrenal body type and basically she</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t really lost any weight whatsoever</p>
<p>and my question is is while you&rsquo;re under</p>
<p>this extreme stress and you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet will it cause your body</p>
<p>to stall and go into a plateau and then</p>
<p>the second part is how long does it take</p>
<p>for your adrenals to get back to normal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the aftermath of this dress</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s basically my question great</p>
<p>question I have a question for you is</p>
<p>she also doing in a minute fasting here</p>
<p>and there okay like yes she does do</p>
<p>intermittent they like 85% of the time</p>
<p>okay all right so let&rsquo;s talk about that</p>
<p>Victoria good question very good</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>stress whether it&rsquo;s mental stress</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s emotional stress losses</p>
<p>being in a stuck between a rock and a</p>
<p>hard place are worse than physical</p>
<p>trauma and stress it&rsquo;s still gonna</p>
<p>activate cortisol cortisol what that</p>
<p>does is it converts your own muscle</p>
<p>protein into glucose and sugar that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why a lot of diabetics can be actually</p>
<p>stemmed from high levels of cortisol</p>
<p>prednisone or even going through a lot</p>
<p>of stress you take a diabetic that and</p>
<p>you ask them when did you start becoming</p>
<p>diabetic what&rsquo;s after a stress event</p>
<p>many times so yeah so stress is keeping</p>
<p>her from getting into a full fat-burning</p>
<p>effect absolutely there are several</p>
<p>things that I would recommend and of</p>
<p>course you know the anatomy of a problem</p>
<p>is like an indecision so a lot of times</p>
<p>if you list all the problems that you</p>
<p>have you&rsquo;re gonna see a lot of those are</p>
<p>indecisive should I do this should I do</p>
<p>that should I do this or do that so as</p>
<p>long as you one way to get rid of</p>
<p>problems is just make a decision decide</p>
<p>one way or the other and just start</p>
<p>deciding and your problems tend to kind</p>
<p>of be less but the point is that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna have to either eliminate that</p>
<p>stress somehow I don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>or maximize the coping with the stress</p>
<p>like daily long walks for an hour to an</p>
<p>hour and a half adding in every other</p>
<p>day some high-intensity exercise change</p>
<p>your environment you know go get out and</p>
<p>go into nature things like that go for</p>
<p>long walks don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t talk to someone</p>
<p>just get out there and just look at</p>
<p>trees Birds clouds because you want to</p>
<p>get your attention off the problem that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about 24/7 and then</p>
<p>because that hold that activates the</p>
<p>adrenals it keeps it active the other</p>
<p>thing is that she definitely needs to</p>
<p>consistently stick in there the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting that will see</p>
<p>ketogenic diet in general works to some</p>
<p>degree but if your metabolism is slow</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing snacks between you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t see the grade of</p>
<p>so in a minute fasting will greatly</p>
<p>accelerate the effectiveness of</p>
<p>ketogenic diets so you want to do go to</p>
<p>three meals no snacks and then two meals</p>
<p>no snacks that probably is what she</p>
<p>needs to do the last thing would be to</p>
<p>enhance the sleep a little more</p>
<p>but people that are stressed don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really sleep so I would recommend a</p>
<p>couple things my sleep aid works really</p>
<p>good for sleep take one before you go to</p>
<p>bed and then the adrenal and cortisone</p>
<p>relief during the day just to kind of</p>
<p>cope with the adrenals and support them</p>
<p>nutritionally dose and those are some</p>
<p>things that I would do to help so I hope</p>
<p>that helped alright so Jennifer you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the area from Cleveland go ahead hi</p>
<p>thank you for taking my call I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>honored I&rsquo;ve been doing low carb high</p>
<p>fat for about six weeks and I&rsquo;ve watched</p>
<p>a ton of your YouTube videos basically</p>
<p>my question is and I&rsquo;ll give you a</p>
<p>little history if you wanted but my</p>
<p>question is did you have gallbladder</p>
<p>pain or inflammation without any stones</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had some gallbladder pain and</p>
<p>issues recently and I went and had an</p>
<p>ultrasound and they found absolutely</p>
<p>nothing wrong all my blood works normal</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no stones but I&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>pain like in my rib cage you know right</p>
<p>side area kind of radiating slightly to</p>
<p>the back okay good so I have a question</p>
<p>for you are you doing in a minute</p>
<p>fasting no not yet no I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>this way of eating for about six weeks</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost 15 pounds and dropped my</p>
<p>glucose number from 101 to 82</p>
<p>but not intermittent fasting yet okay</p>
<p>next question are you doing a lot of</p>
<p>nuts right now I am okay peanut butter</p>
<p>peanut not peanut butter okay an almond</p>
<p>flour you know okay yeah so here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing Jennifer a couple things you can</p>
<p>totally have stress in the gallbladder</p>
<p>without having stones absolutely so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s several things you need to do</p>
<p>to handle that the first thing is in a</p>
<p>minute fasting the purpose of the</p>
<p>gallbladder is to store and concentrate</p>
<p>bile because when you eat your you need</p>
<p>bile in a state of super concentration</p>
<p>like 20 times so if you&rsquo;re eating too</p>
<p>frequently you drain out this bile you</p>
<p>know have a chance to concentrate the</p>
<p>bile so now we always have a little bit</p>
<p>deficiency of bile which puts a strain</p>
<p>on the digestion because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>fully gonna break down the fats</p>
<p>especially the nuts so it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>incomplete fat so the fat kind of just</p>
<p>aggravates it and just kind of keeps</p>
<p>keeps it inflamed and swollen but if you</p>
<p>take in a minute fasting think about</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;re dropping</p>
<p>insulin you&rsquo;re giving the gall bladder</p>
<p>rest you&rsquo;re allowing to reset over a</p>
<p>period of time oh my gosh it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>thing for the gall bladder it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>thing if you go to two meals like maybe</p>
<p>a late morning and then an early dinner</p>
<p>you you won&rsquo;t have got her problems now</p>
<p>the nuts you may want to kind of cut</p>
<p>down on the nuts because they tend to</p>
<p>they have enzyme inhibitors they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>harder to digest</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just there&rsquo;s stress in the gall</p>
<p>bladder so I would probably switch those</p>
<p>out for something else but they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>really good go-to I know that the last</p>
<p>thing is to increase the cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables the salads to help clean out</p>
<p>that gall bladder so it&rsquo;s so it it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get too congested with some of</p>
<p>the proteins and the fats okay alright</p>
<p>good question hey Melanie you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>air you&rsquo;re from let&rsquo;s say New Haven go</p>
<p>ahead hi I have discovered you about</p>
<p>three weeks ago and the first two weeks</p>
<p>I did a gradual change into ketosis</p>
<p>I was still eating some fruits and so</p>
<p>drinking coffee having my glass of wine</p>
<p>a couple of days a week this past week I</p>
<p>have cut out every type of sugar that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had in the previous week so I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>drinking any coffee with that sugary</p>
<p>creamer anymore I</p>
<p>about wine and fruits and I am strictly</p>
<p>protein and veggies my question is I am</p>
<p>craving my end of the day sweet coffee</p>
<p>eh</p>
<p>so I was wondering if having something</p>
<p>as like a sugar-free jell-o if that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>safe thing to eat that&rsquo;s my first</p>
<p>question my my second question too is</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been experiencing a lot of</p>
<p>joint pain muscle stiffness and fatigue</p>
<p>in the last three weeks um I have taken</p>
<p>this topic I had a full blood work and</p>
<p>everything came back negative and</p>
<p>everything came back normal so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wondering if the muscle and the</p>
<p>stiffness is can I attribute that to the</p>
<p>keiki doing got it okay</p>
<p>good question I think I think you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>probably been on this program truly one</p>
<p>week and you&rsquo;re just in the very</p>
<p>beginning your body has not converted</p>
<p>over because you&rsquo;re still crave so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right in this keto adaptation</p>
<p>beginning okay so another two weeks</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll probably want it never 1 week oh</p>
<p>go away but in the transition you</p>
<p>probably need electrolytes you probably</p>
<p>want to see if you can get some my</p>
<p>electrolytes have a thousand milligrams</p>
<p>potassium that should take away a lot of</p>
<p>the symptoms for potassium so you should</p>
<p>do really good on that but in addition</p>
<p>to that get some nutritional yeast and</p>
<p>start taking B vitamins because the B</p>
<p>vitamins potassium will make things the</p>
<p>transition really really good now the</p>
<p>joint pain will go away with a little</p>
<p>more time because this getting into a</p>
<p>full-blown ketosis reduces inflammation</p>
<p>in the meantime not a problem with the</p>
<p>sugar-free jell-o you can do that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not an issue but just make sure you have</p>
<p>more fat at each meal to go longer all</p>
<p>right thanks so we&rsquo;re going to take a</p>
<p>little break we&rsquo;ll come right back and</p>
<p>stay tuned</p>
<p>call the show now at eight six six five</p>
<p>six one four to nine to the doctor</p>
<p>returns in a moment</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>hey guys I&rsquo;m back on the board so I</p>
<p>always want to just kind of you know</p>
<p>John sounds some things I think the last</p>
<p>call not sure people got the information</p>
<p>I wanted to answer it again because</p>
<p>somehow there&rsquo;s a mic issue so I want to</p>
<p>talk about answer anything was Melanie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>call so hopefully you&rsquo;re still watching</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna just kind of answer that</p>
<p>again she asked about sugar-free jell-o</p>
<p>can I do that absolutely you can do</p>
<p>sugar-free jell-o it&rsquo;s not a problem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good transition but you said</p>
<p>you did it for three weeks and then one</p>
<p>week really strict so you&rsquo;re right in</p>
<p>the middle of keto adaptation which does</p>
<p>take a good couple three weeks maybe</p>
<p>more until you&rsquo;re fully adapted the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re craving sweets means that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not fully adapted yet so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing that you need to focus on is</p>
<p>just do it do it longer and then you</p>
<p>need to add a little more electrolytes</p>
<p>and B vitamins I recommend I have a</p>
<p>really good electrolyte powder it&rsquo;s has</p>
<p>a thousand milligrams of potassium no</p>
<p>multi dextran is trace minerals all the</p>
<p>electrolytes you take one scoop of that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll really make you get through this</p>
<p>easily you can get that on dr. burr calm</p>
<p>the other thing is go to Amazon and get</p>
<p>some nutritional yeast or the health a</p>
<p>store and take a tablespoon of that that</p>
<p>will make the transition really easy</p>
<p>okay and then the other thing is add</p>
<p>more fat with the meals so you can go</p>
<p>longer so you&rsquo;re not hungry at night but</p>
<p>again if you&rsquo;re craving just hang in</p>
<p>there and it&rsquo;s going to happen and all</p>
<p>of a sudden a switch in your body has to</p>
<p>adapt so I just wanted to talk about you</p>
<p>know how I&rsquo;ve been talking about this</p>
<p>subject for a quite a while and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>staying on this topic because of</p>
<p>basically changing your body&rsquo;s fuel</p>
<p>source to a different fuel source and</p>
<p>the importance of that I think as the</p>
<p>more I look at this the more I am blown</p>
<p>away at the benefits that an average</p>
<p>body can get by switching fuel sources</p>
<p>from sugar fuel to fat fuel the benefits</p>
<p>are just amazing I&rsquo;m going to talk about</p>
<p>some of the benefits because</p>
<p>when you actually your body is running</p>
<p>on ketones neurologically it takes its</p>
<p>neuroprotective it protects the brain</p>
<p>cells it helps as effective treatment</p>
<p>for seizures epileptic seizures bipolar</p>
<p>schizophrenia depression anxiety autism</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s incredible it&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>better fuel source for the brain then</p>
<p>sugar hands down running your body your</p>
<p>brain on sugar depletes oxygen it adds a</p>
<p>lot more stress</p>
<p>the thing that ketones do is they help</p>
<p>you make more of the energy factories in</p>
<p>the brain specifically the hippocampus</p>
<p>which is the really switch to the memory</p>
<p>to learning to spatial memory and so I</p>
<p>mean your cognitive function is going to</p>
<p>improve greatly by running your body on</p>
<p>ketones but you need to combine ketosis</p>
<p>within a minute fasting now a couple</p>
<p>other things that it will do high number</p>
<p>high amounts of insulin deplete vitamin</p>
<p>C okay vitamin C is intimately involved</p>
<p>in collagen production so let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>take your artery in your arteries you</p>
<p>have a line a single layer of cells</p>
<p>called epithelial cells it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>vascular epithelial cells it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>little lining that helps filtration the</p>
<p>tone of the artery and the exchange of</p>
<p>fluid through your lymph system so if</p>
<p>your vitamin C deficient you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to make the college and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get little holes or lesions into</p>
<p>the artery itself okay and that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>from high levels of insulin so then the</p>
<p>signal you&rsquo;re going to have a bandit</p>
<p>come in there LDL and start to patch</p>
<p>that up that so called bad cholesterol</p>
<p>LDL is your friend it&rsquo;s not the problem</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there to help fix the lesion from</p>
<p>the vitamin C deficiency so it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>necessarily that you&rsquo;re not consuming</p>
<p>about it than c4 in the food maybe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not because we&rsquo;re not having the</p>
<p>vegetables it&rsquo;s the high insulin that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>depleting vitamin C okay so then you get</p>
<p>the clot</p>
<p>the arteries and this is the first thing</p>
<p>that well high insulin and this the</p>
<p>second thing and then cholesterol comes</p>
<p>in there and calcium comes in there and</p>
<p>you get a clogged artery that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really behind it</p>
<p>okay but that&rsquo;s you can call this scurvy</p>
<p>which is vitamin C deficiency of the</p>
<p>arteries there&rsquo;s also scurvy of the</p>
<p>colon same thing happens you have the</p>
<p>colon you have the wall the colon and</p>
<p>think about it what happens in the colon</p>
<p>you absorb all your nutrients so you</p>
<p>break down the food the micro break down</p>
<p>the food and it&rsquo;s supposed to be</p>
<p>absorbed through these little junctions</p>
<p>here into the lymphatic system and then</p>
<p>up set up into the blood and so normally</p>
<p>those little those little spaces where</p>
<p>we absorb nutrients are very tiny</p>
<p>between 1 and 7 microns when you get</p>
<p>leaky gut it goes between 200 to 300</p>
<p>microns or like huge gaps well what</p>
<p>causes that is a vitamin C deficiency</p>
<p>from the high levels of insulin yes</p>
<p>gluten is one of the causes for sure no</p>
<p>doubt but what happens when you cut out</p>
<p>the gluten and things don&rsquo;t clear out</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s because the it&rsquo;s the vitamin</p>
<p>C deficiency you have this leaky gut and</p>
<p>then all this undigested protein goes</p>
<p>into the lymphatic system the immune</p>
<p>system attacks it you start developing</p>
<p>allergies to everything all these food</p>
<p>allergies especially proteins so now you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t eat anything and then it&rsquo;s scarce</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the solution to fix the insulin</p>
<p>thing okay and then take some really</p>
<p>good vitamin C bioflavonoids from foods</p>
<p>cruciferous and things like that to</p>
<p>start healing this up so you can get rid</p>
<p>of the inflammation other benefits belly</p>
<p>fat if you have belly fat you have high</p>
<p>insulin okay belly fat cognitive</p>
<p>functions high cholesterol I mean the</p>
<p>list goes on and on and on PCOD pot</p>
<p>cystic ovarian syndrome acne I mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many benefits okay</p>
<p>so just I&rsquo;m trying to sell you on the</p>
<p>concept that this is a really good thing</p>
<p>to do for your body so you might want to</p>
<p>try it okay let&rsquo;s go back over to the</p>
<p>computer and take another call</p>
<p>hey Robert you&rsquo;re from Thailand you have</p>
<p>a question go ahead right oh boy I get a</p>
<p>couple bit here I&rsquo;ve been doing the</p>
<p>low-carb to basically no carb I have</p>
<p>been doing intermittent fasting uh</p>
<p>between 12 and 16 17 hours a day I eat</p>
<p>one meal around two to four o&rsquo;clock I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;m doing the right things I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>eating good fats I&rsquo;m eating butter and</p>
<p>all that and I just got my my readings</p>
<p>today which I was a little stunned on my</p>
<p>a1c and and and stuff like that so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just wondering what I could be doing</p>
<p>wrong I learned tell me after this</p>
<p>thinking&rsquo;s right dr. Berg I basically</p>
<p>think that if you have high insulin I do</p>
<p>have belly fat I&rsquo;ve been a diabetic for</p>
<p>25 years I&rsquo;ve had some really great wins</p>
<p>and right now I&rsquo;m not doing as well my</p>
<p>a1c was 8.6 what was it before what was</p>
<p>it before the last time I did it</p>
<p>something strange happened I made my</p>
<p>mind up but I was kind of low in my my</p>
<p>my a 1 a 1 C and I did take metformin</p>
<p>2,000 milligrams a day but I was doing</p>
<p>the intermittent fasting and there was</p>
<p>6.1 okay from ten point one one month</p>
<p>later okay okay so I have a question</p>
<p>what other whether their blood blood</p>
<p>values were incorrect or not good well</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s drop it right here cholesterol</p>
<p>well my HDL is 54 which I thought was</p>
<p>great pretty good</p>
<p>my LDL was 163 I think my I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>about the rest of it</p>
<p>okay just hang on one second if you can</p>
<p>have it right here</p>
<p>okay I mean I want to be healthy and I</p>
<p>want to be in ketosis and I I want to</p>
<p>not take metformin which I&rsquo;m not taking</p>
<p>anything now but do you agree with this</p>
<p>statement</p>
<p>most of these alternative doctors are</p>
<p>saying you want to treat the symptom you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to take the insulin because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll just take more and more you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to take the metformin because it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>lead you to the insulin your blood</p>
<p>sugars could be coming down but your</p>
<p>diabetes could be getting worse so you</p>
<p>got to deal with the problem and as I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>learning if the insulin resistance</p>
<p>correct yeah you&rsquo;re right okay Rob let</p>
<p>me let me talk about this okay go ahead</p>
<p>so I think you&rsquo;re on the right track you</p>
<p>I always like recommend things on a</p>
<p>gradient right you take you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>medication you take less less less less</p>
<p>less less and then you come off of it</p>
<p>and then you kind of do this not like a</p>
<p>one shot too fast sometimes people can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do that</p>
<p>I think I think you&rsquo;re on the right</p>
<p>track I would want to make sure that</p>
<p>your eating is um you have a lot of if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing one meal like it&rsquo;s really a</p>
<p>robust huge salad and then do protein</p>
<p>and healthy fats it sounds like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>already doing that electrolytes are</p>
<p>going to be important especially</p>
<p>potassium because for diabetics that can</p>
<p>actually improve things but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>point if you&rsquo;ve been a diabetic for</p>
<p>20-something odd years you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna it&rsquo;s going to take some time but</p>
<p>also instead of resistance is a problem</p>
<p>where insulin as a key is not working</p>
<p>anymore you can look at insulin like the</p>
<p>chef that feeds the cell glucose but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also a key that allows nutrients in</p>
<p>the cell potassium magnesium amino acids</p>
<p>and a lot more nutrition in other words</p>
<p>almost every single nutrient I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about an a/d chromium omega 3 6 fatty</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids B vitamins are all</p>
<p>influencing insulin</p>
<p>so what happens if you have instant</p>
<p>resistance you can&rsquo;t absorb those</p>
<p>nutrients if you don&rsquo;t have those</p>
<p>nutrients you can&rsquo;t fix the insulin</p>
<p>resistance by taking more nutrients you</p>
<p>can actually improve insulin resistance</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying like that dot</p>
<p>has to be really robust and healthy and</p>
<p>then intermittent fasting ketosis will</p>
<p>start improving it the combination there</p>
<p>will be really good now that last thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say is that a1c is not the</p>
<p>most accurate test in the world to</p>
<p>determine if you have diabetes it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>factor to look at but there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>variables that will make it high that</p>
<p>are not related to blood sugars I like</p>
<p>to look at your symptoms a fasting</p>
<p>glucose which is not always the best</p>
<p>thing either a fasting insulin which is</p>
<p>the better indicator and also uh it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>post perennial glucose test where you</p>
<p>basically get a glucometer and you check</p>
<p>your blood sugars two hours after you</p>
<p>eat okay and it you know the American</p>
<p>Diabetes Association says it should be</p>
<p>like 140 I&rsquo;m saying it should be 120</p>
<p>okay so it should come down or even</p>
<p>lower if that&rsquo;s coming down that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s I like that test the better</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a functional test to see</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re recovering so get these other</p>
<p>tests don&rsquo;t be too concerned about just</p>
<p>one test and also retest it because if</p>
<p>you would took that test when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stressed or you didn&rsquo;t sleep or maybe</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t drink enough whatever water or</p>
<p>whatever it can alter your data alright</p>
<p>hey but thanks for calling from Thailand</p>
<p>hey Sandra you&rsquo;re from New York go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air fasting now for two</p>
<p>months haven&rsquo;t lost any weight but I did</p>
<p>stop taking my hydrochlorothiazide that</p>
<p>I always took for water retention so now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of disappeared so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to take it and I&rsquo;m always doing</p>
<p>avocado every day I can do my first meal</p>
<p>is usually around two and then my next</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s like between five and six so I can</p>
<p>go almost 19 to 22 hours without eating</p>
<p>well and and the only thing I do is a</p>
<p>cup of coffee in the morning I do a half</p>
<p>CAF because I&rsquo;m not really a caffeine</p>
<p>person and I do use MCT oil I do not</p>
<p>the butter and I put my collagen</p>
<p>peptides in my coffee in the morning I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s throwing me off I</p>
<p>have no idea I&rsquo;m thinking maybe I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>losing weight because of that but I&rsquo;m 45</p>
<p>I have severe arthritis everywhere to</p>
<p>the point I have to have a hip replace</p>
<p>weird I was a runner for years I had to</p>
<p>stop running I saw that&rsquo;s why I have a</p>
<p>hard time doing the high-intensity</p>
<p>interval training because with my hip I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do that I&rsquo;ve gotten four cortisone</p>
<p>shots so I don&rsquo;t know if that was giving</p>
<p>me the issue but without the cortisone I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t walk so and I&rsquo;ve been reading your</p>
<p>book and I read the section in regards</p>
<p>to ovaries and I&rsquo;m knee hurting and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really weird but my left knee started to</p>
<p>hurt probably like a month ago to the</p>
<p>point that I was like ready to get an</p>
<p>MRI but I haven&rsquo;t done anything so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking hey maybe it&rsquo;s the ovaries</p>
<p>because I have an ovarian cyst on my</p>
<p>right side and and as I told the guy</p>
<p>that I asked me the questions I told him</p>
<p>my knee hurts and then also I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>taking the gallbladder stuff that you</p>
<p>have and I feel pain now after I eat on</p>
<p>the left side like more where the</p>
<p>pancreas is maybe it&rsquo;s just digested but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had gallbladder pain it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been I&rsquo;ve had Emer ultrasounds I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>the gall bladder test they find nothing</p>
<p>but if I eat too much like if I eat too</p>
<p>many eggs I definitely get pain up under</p>
<p>the liver area and into my back okay so</p>
<p>I oh I don&rsquo;t know so I have a question</p>
<p>question are you is your stomach</p>
<p>shrinking it&rsquo;s going down a little bit I</p>
<p>blow a lot I am gluten free I&rsquo;m dairy</p>
<p>free so I know those are to go in</p>
<p>tolerances for me I&rsquo;ve been that way for</p>
<p>a long time I don&rsquo;t do any bread I you</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;m trying to do a hundred percent</p>
<p>veggies and protein and I have grass-fed</p>
<p>beef I bought a half a cow so okay good</p>
<p>well good let&rsquo;s talk let&rsquo;s talk Sandra</p>
<p>okay so here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an underlying thread that you</p>
<p>mentioned you had severe arthritis so</p>
<p>that tells me right there yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been some adrenal issues in the past and</p>
<p>then the four cortisone shots okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another that&rsquo;s cortisone that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna that&rsquo;s gonna really kind of keep</p>
<p>you from having ketosis work effectively</p>
<p>but the fact that you&rsquo;re losing your</p>
<p>stomach tells me it&rsquo;s probably working</p>
<p>probably slowly but it&rsquo;s still working</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re getting more muscle mass and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s stopping the weight loss</p>
<p>so I would want you to switch your goal</p>
<p>to just monitor your waist as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>indicated it&rsquo;s working okay now if you</p>
<p>go through this over a period of time</p>
<p>the more you do this the better they are</p>
<p>arthritis is gonna be your inflammation</p>
<p>is gonna go down it is the best therapy</p>
<p>for you right now now to clean up the</p>
<p>cortisone shot side effect stuff you</p>
<p>need to take something called colostrum</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of expensive get it in the</p>
<p>powder form take a little before bed in</p>
<p>some water drink it down and that will</p>
<p>slowly start building up your immune</p>
<p>system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s destroyed from the</p>
<p>cortisone okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what happened to me and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I had to do and it really does work</p>
<p>and it just helps your liver and it</p>
<p>helps you increase growth hormone and</p>
<p>other things to do what you can with</p>
<p>exercise I would add the opposite of</p>
<p>vinegar plus thing because I think you</p>
<p>need some support for your stomach so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll activate the enzymes from the</p>
<p>pancreas and maybe take a little less</p>
<p>gallbladder but the fact that you had a</p>
<p>chronic gallbladder just means it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna take some time but I love the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing in a minute fasting</p>
<p>that is the thing you need but to</p>
<p>improve things you may want to</p>
<p>supplement the actual adrenal itself was</p>
<p>something called adrenal fatigue</p>
<p>advanced formula that&rsquo;s the one you need</p>
<p>is for chronic inflammation and see if</p>
<p>you can take that in place of some of</p>
<p>the shots but that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>help you more than anything the collagen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking in your coffee is gonna</p>
<p>spike insulin so I probably would not I</p>
<p>would only do coffee with a little bit</p>
<p>of cream and that&rsquo;s it nothing else</p>
<p>and that will help you and ovarian cysts</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to take some seek help</p>
<p>for that to help that that&rsquo;ll probably</p>
<p>help your knee do a search on knee pain</p>
<p>to do this techniques that I show you</p>
<p>with the acupressure tool and again I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s going to help you there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot there but this is another good good</p>
<p>question because there&rsquo;s other health</p>
<p>problems that that complicate everything</p>
<p>that you need to address so I hope that</p>
<p>gave you something Sandra thanks hey</p>
<p>Christopher you&rsquo;re from Arizona go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>thanks dr. Byrd thanks for sharing all</p>
<p>your knowledge and being so available</p>
<p>for everyone it&rsquo;s really awesome</p>
<p>I am 52 year old male and I was looking</p>
<p>for a good source of nitric nitric oxide</p>
<p>yeah and I&rsquo;ve been drinking organic beet</p>
<p>juice and ice from what I know or beets</p>
<p>are really high in sugar but I was</p>
<p>wondering what your thoughts were on</p>
<p>that as being something for guys my age</p>
<p>to take and or if there&rsquo;s a better</p>
<p>source of nitric oxide are you taking</p>
<p>that for blood pressure or testosterone</p>
<p>yeah for tech for more of the health</p>
<p>benefits that would be related to</p>
<p>testosterone you know as we get into our</p>
<p>50s we want to we want to feel like we</p>
<p>did when we are 20s and right yeah so I</p>
<p>was searching for something like that</p>
<p>because so yeah I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>health problems that then I would be</p>
<p>taking anything for I&rsquo;m I don&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>anything I&rsquo;m completely in the organic</p>
<p>food is medicine ideals and I love a lot</p>
<p>of the things that you talk about anyway</p>
<p>right okay so here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>with that as long as you calculate and</p>
<p>not let the carbs go ever maybe 30 grams</p>
<p>for the day so include those carbs the</p>
<p>beet juice include those into your you</p>
<p>know 30 grams a day and I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one solution that you can do so it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go over that so I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s great benefits in beat</p>
<p>you especially that go way beyond nitric</p>
<p>oxide the couple of things that will</p>
<p>improve testosterone believe it out our</p>
<p>button mushrooms for a man you</p>
<p>because they lower estrogen and</p>
<p>naturally increase testosterone and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple of ones to in a minute</p>
<p>of fasting will increase growth hormone</p>
<p>which by the way follows the pathways of</p>
<p>testosterone they both work together you</p>
<p>can do in a minute fasting an increase</p>
<p>growth hormone by three hundred to two</p>
<p>thousand percent then if we add high</p>
<p>interval high intense interval training</p>
<p>on top of that we can increase another</p>
<p>four hundred fifty percent those are all</p>
<p>things that I would highly recommend to</p>
<p>do that and of course you probably are</p>
<p>doing this like really beefed up your</p>
<p>your like kale shakes cruciferous for</p>
<p>the liver which will then help</p>
<p>testosterone that&rsquo;s like the the best</p>
<p>thing you can do for testosterone get</p>
<p>more sleep maybe take naps do the height</p>
<p>intense exercise all that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>really good so that&rsquo;s pretty much my</p>
<p>answer and I&rsquo;m sticking to her thanks</p>
<p>hey Carrie you&rsquo;re from Tennessee go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the air hi dr. Byrd hi</p>
<p>my my boyfriend was a nice tall six foot</p>
<p>two person with very good muscle tone</p>
<p>just just kind of naturally with kind of</p>
<p>normal activity and a couple of years he</p>
<p>was put on blood pressure medications a</p>
<p>couple of years ago for about four years</p>
<p>ago and he was already on testosterone</p>
<p>replacement therapy and synthroid he had</p>
<p>had a big stressful event and just kind</p>
<p>of crashed but when after he was put on</p>
<p>that medication I noticed that he had a</p>
<p>lot of muscle wasting and now he he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>nice tall person but like his muscles</p>
<p>look like a little old man you know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you see it and and so this year he was</p>
<p>diagnosed with diabetes and they wanted</p>
<p>to put him on metformin or invokana and</p>
<p>I just I&rsquo;m kind of more the holistic</p>
<p>person in the family and I but he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>one in charge of the food so I just put</p>
<p>my foot down and I said you know we</p>
<p>about the same thing</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to be right behind you</p>
<p>on this on this track and and and we</p>
<p>need to find out what to do so it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>watching your videos and I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>get us into the intermittent fasting and</p>
<p>the and the cruciferous and and protein</p>
<p>thing but I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m really concerned about</p>
<p>this diagnosis and I&rsquo;m also wondering if</p>
<p>some of this muscle wasting a side</p>
<p>effects from the high blood pressure</p>
<p>medication and as you go into as you</p>
<p>start healing and going into the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and taking care of</p>
<p>the diet side of things that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>muscle return okay I mean it&rsquo;s a let me</p>
<p>let me answer that caring the reason why</p>
<p>has and we can kill two three birds with</p>
<p>one stone on this the the cells have a</p>
<p>key that allows the protein to go inside</p>
<p>I mean when asked to go inside and the</p>
<p>key is insulin so we know he has insulin</p>
<p>resistance and that&rsquo;s what created the</p>
<p>diabetes that so created the muscle loss</p>
<p>aside if I communication absolutely so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to get with your</p>
<p>doctor on that I can&rsquo;t say not to take</p>
<p>it but I can say this if you improve</p>
<p>insulin resistance that should naturally</p>
<p>lower the blood pressure so the need for</p>
<p>medication will go way down to zero so</p>
<p>but if you fix insulin resistance you</p>
<p>will help the muscles regain comeback be</p>
<p>absorbed and at the same time clear out</p>
<p>the diabetes so I think he&rsquo;s in pretty</p>
<p>good if he could just focus on fixing</p>
<p>insulin resistance which is in all of my</p>
<p>videos I think he&rsquo;s gonna be so happy in</p>
<p>the end that it&rsquo;ll solve the majority of</p>
<p>his problems so go ahead and do that</p>
<p>Carrie thanks for calling hey Sharon</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the air you&rsquo;re from Indiana</p>
<p>yes thanks for taking my call dr. Berger</p>
<p>my question is is that I would like to</p>
<p>start the ketosis process because I fit</p>
<p>the adrenal profile I had surgery and</p>
<p>had my left kidney removed</p>
<p>twelve years ago and I&rsquo;d like to know</p>
<p>would it be safe or productive for me</p>
<p>since I only have one adrenal gland yeah</p>
<p>good question because they obviously</p>
<p>took out your adrenal your your kidney</p>
<p>and into your adrenal the other one has</p>
<p>adapted by now so they just they can</p>
<p>adapt they just compensate so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little bigger it&rsquo;s working a little bit</p>
<p>harder I think it&rsquo;s absolutely necessity</p>
<p>to do you know manifesting in ketosis to</p>
<p>salvage and take care of the kidney the</p>
<p>benefits of your kidney I mean think</p>
<p>about being it let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s take glucose</p>
<p>to the extreme being a diabetic think</p>
<p>about what that does your kidneys it</p>
<p>destroys the kidneys leads to kidney</p>
<p>dialysis so switching your fuel source</p>
<p>now will probably make your other kidney</p>
<p>very very happy and your adrenal will</p>
<p>take the stress off of it highly</p>
<p>recommend it jump in and start doing it</p>
<p>immediately good question</p>
<p>hey Leon you&rsquo;re from Ohio you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>last question hi I have called in before</p>
<p>I had found you actually after I went to</p>
<p>a biofeed session and and she had said I</p>
<p>had all these issues and I had to hire</p>
<p>my fat and all this stuff though we we</p>
<p>my daughter and I have been we had found</p>
<p>you and I had started getting some of</p>
<p>your supplements and she has kidney</p>
<p>stones and she had quite a few of them</p>
<p>and all of them are gone except for one</p>
<p>she just had to get that lithotripsy it</p>
<p>was stuck in her ureter but I have to</p>
<p>tell you that stuff is amazing and I</p>
<p>feel great on doing the keto and the the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and everything love</p>
<p>your recipes your wife everything and</p>
<p>but one of the recipes it was a for keto</p>
<p>bomb it called for a hemp cream I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what that is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to find it</p>
<p>and is there a substitute for it since I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t find it</p>
<p>and I also hid a question about yours at</p>
<p>one of the your YouTube videos you had a</p>
<p>huge salad with a huge Fork really no</p>
<p>that was a situation I just wanted to</p>
<p>emphasize the point that you want have a</p>
<p>big salad but no I don&rsquo;t have that big</p>
<p>of salad some people actually think I do</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I it&rsquo;s a big salad it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>big okay</p>
<p>but good so I think you could substitute</p>
<p>the hemp I if it was an oil just with</p>
<p>coconut oil I mean that&rsquo;s one thing with</p>
<p>it was a hemp powder or hemp seed you</p>
<p>can probably do chia seed if it was a o</p>
<p>or coconut powder I mean I think it was</p>
<p>probably a powder it wasn&rsquo;t an oil hemp</p>
<p>yeah I think it was a powder so you can</p>
<p>you can do chia powder I wouldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>flax Chia is pretty neutral so that</p>
<p>would be a good one to do and humppa</p>
<p>hemp is just a protein powder as far as</p>
<p>I know now kidney stones yeah so the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder that you probably</p>
<p>already taken has a thousand milligrams</p>
<p>of potassium citrate which is exactly</p>
<p>your daughter needs to prevent stones</p>
<p>when she does the ketogenic diet and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>in a fasting that will drop insulin then</p>
<p>will help reduce the stones but you want</p>
<p>to be careful of the spinach I would not</p>
<p>consume spinach because it&rsquo;s very high</p>
<p>in oxalic kale by the way is low in</p>
<p>oxalic so that&rsquo;s fine cabbage is low in</p>
<p>Oxford&rsquo;s peanuts are high in oxalates so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s chocolate even unsweetened I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry so the point is that you want to</p>
<p>get the list of oxlips I think I</p>
<p>actually have a video on that and avoid</p>
<p>those foods because a lot of people who</p>
<p>start eating more peanuts and and then</p>
<p>more spinach and then they get a kidney</p>
<p>stones so every day you want to do the</p>
<p>lemon juice with water and the calcium</p>
<p>potassium citrate hey thanks so much</p>
<p>guys this is great I appreciate your</p>
<p>attention I will let you know when the</p>
<p>next Q&amp;A is going to be so until then</p>
<p>have a great week</p>
