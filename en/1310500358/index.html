    <p>The following is a conversation with Jeremy Surrey,</p>
<p>a historian at UT Austin.</p>
<p>And now a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got AIDSleep for naps,</p>
<p>BetterHelp for mental health,</p>
<p>InsightTracker for bio-monitoring,</p>
<p>and Athletic Greens for multivitamins.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting,</p>
<p>but if you must skip them,</p>
<p>friends, please still check out the sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This episode is sponsored by AIDSleep</p>
<p>and its new Pod 3 mattress.</p>
<p>I saw a meme recently.</p>
<p>Maybe I should look it up.</p>
<p>It was a meme that was highlighting</p>
<p>different ways you can do self-care,</p>
<p>which is, you know,</p>
<p>depending on how you feel, what&rsquo;s the best solution.</p>
<p>I think it was, if everybody hates you,</p>
<p>go to sleep.</p>
<p>If you hate everybody, eat some food.</p>
<p>And if you hate yourself, take a shower.</p>
<p>I think those were advice.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s just a meme,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some truth to that,</p>
<p>at least the first and the third for me.</p>
<p>A shower is a refreshing way</p>
<p>to take sort of control of your life,</p>
<p>and it feels like a fresh start.</p>
<p>And sleep, it&rsquo;s just magic to me.</p>
<p>And not even a full night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>but a little bit of sleep, like a nap,</p>
<p>can completely transform my worldview.</p>
<p>Just having a bit of a melancholy outlook,</p>
<p>or maybe being a little bit cynical about the world.</p>
<p>For me, I take a nap and everything feels new.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I could see the beauty in the world again.</p>
<p>And some of that is, of course, a gift.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s built on a foundation of regular exercise,</p>
<p>a good diet, and some of that is genetics,</p>
<p>and biochemistry in the brain.</p>
<p>But really, sleep for everybody.</p>
<p>It can give a positive delta to your mood.</p>
<p>So I take sort of the bed I sleep on extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Some of that is temperature control.</p>
<p>I think, for me, temperature&rsquo;s so essential</p>
<p>to a great sleeping experience.</p>
<p>And Eight Sleep does a good job of that.</p>
<p>They control the temperature,</p>
<p>obviously in a technological way,</p>
<p>so you could do it with a nap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Check it out and get special savings</p>
<p>when you go to eightsleep.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by BetterHelp,</p>
<p>spelled H-E-L-P, help.</p>
<p>I actually have a conversation with an amazing scientist</p>
<p>and a psychiatrist coming up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be a very wide-ranging conversation,</p>
<p>I think, about different aspects of human behavior,</p>
<p>the good, the bad, and the ugly.</p>
<p>So I think much of his specialization is in trauma,</p>
<p>but he really knows so much about narcissism,</p>
<p>sociopathy, psychopathy, just the nature of evil,</p>
<p>the nature of hate, all of those things.</p>
<p>And the human mind is just really fascinating.</p>
<p>And I do think that talk therapy</p>
<p>is a really, really good way to explore</p>
<p>some of the darker corners of that mind, of that human mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of that from a historical perspective.</p>
<p>Freud and Jung, just psychoanalysis</p>
<p>had been really interesting to me.</p>
<p>Obviously, as a big fan of podcasts,</p>
<p>I see a huge value in the power of conversation</p>
<p>to achieve a kind of intellectual,</p>
<p>spiritual, emotional intimacy in the realm of ideas.</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels one way,</p>
<p>but as a fan of a lot of podcasts, it doesn&rsquo;t feel one way.</p>
<p>It feels like a real conversation,</p>
<p>even though I know I&rsquo;m just a listener.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m a big believer in talk therapy,</p>
<p>and BetterHelp allows you to do that really easily.</p>
<p>So the barrier to access is nil.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s super easy, and that&rsquo;s essential.</p>
<p>The first step, the first step is really the hardest,</p>
<p>truly is.</p>
<p>So you can check them out at betterhelp.com slash Lex</p>
<p>and save on your first month.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Insight Tracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data.</p>
<p>I love tracking stuff about my life.</p>
<p>Now, I do want to be extremely careful</p>
<p>not to over-optimize everything.</p>
<p>I think in some way optimization is the death of romance,</p>
<p>because I think romance or just the appreciation</p>
<p>of the beauty of the human experience</p>
<p>is in part grounded in the chaos,</p>
<p>the unpredictability, the uncertainty,</p>
<p>the mystery, all of that, right?</p>
<p>And I think getting perfect data</p>
<p>and coming up with a perfect plan</p>
<p>and optimizing every single little thing</p>
<p>is I think suffocates the possibility of magic</p>
<p>that is the human condition.</p>
<p>That said, you do, I believe,</p>
<p>have to build a foundation of health,</p>
<p>health broadly defined.</p>
<p>And so for that, you have to collect as much data</p>
<p>from your own body as possible</p>
<p>and take actions based on that data.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Insight Tracker helps you with.</p>
<p>You can get special savings for a limited time</p>
<p>when you go to insighttracker.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s AG1 Drink.</p>
<p>This set of ad reads I&rsquo;m doing today</p>
<p>is just the all-stars of what brings joy</p>
<p>and happiness and health to my life.</p>
<p>Sleep, mental health, collecting good long-term data</p>
<p>about your body, and now with Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s really my favorite source</p>
<p>of happiness in the health space, in my personal life.</p>
<p>I drink the AG1 Drink twice a day.</p>
<p>I break my fast with it.</p>
<p>I do it after a long run, put it in the fridge,</p>
<p>get a little bit cold.</p>
<p>Well, I take a quick shower, jump out, drink the drink.</p>
<p>I feel refreshed and ready to continue the day</p>
<p>now that all of the dark, deep exploration of my own mind,</p>
<p>the process of running,</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m listening to audio books and brown noise,</p>
<p>all of that is done.</p>
<p>And now that&rsquo;s kind of the trigger</p>
<p>that says I&rsquo;m going to start anew</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna take on the rest of the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what AG1 symbolizes for me.</p>
<p>Anyway, they&rsquo;ll give you one month supply of fish oil.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Jeremy Suri.</p>
<p>What is the main idea,</p>
<p>the main case that you make in your new book,</p>
<p>Civil War by Other Means,</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s Long and Unfinished Fight for Democracy?</p>
<p>So our democratic institutions in the United States,</p>
<p>they are filled with many virtues</p>
<p>and many elements in their design</p>
<p>that improve our society and allow for innovation,</p>
<p>but they also have many flaws in them</p>
<p>as any institutions created by human beings have.</p>
<p>And the flaws in our institutions</p>
<p>go back to a number of judgments and perspectives</p>
<p>that people in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries had.</p>
<p>And those flaws have been built into our institutions</p>
<p>and they continue to hinder innovation</p>
<p>and growth in our society.</p>
<p>Three of the flaws that I emphasize in this book</p>
<p>are flaws of exclusion,</p>
<p>the ways our institutions exclude people,</p>
<p>not just African-Americans, many different groups,</p>
<p>the ways our institutions also give power</p>
<p>to certain people who have position</p>
<p>rather than skill or intelligence or quality,</p>
<p>and third and most of all,</p>
<p>the ways our institutions embed certain myths in our society,</p>
<p>myths that prevent us from gaining the knowledge</p>
<p>we need to improve our world.</p>
<p>In all of these ways,</p>
<p>our democracy is hindered by the false reverence</p>
<p>for institutions that actually need to be reformed</p>
<p>just as we need to highlight the good elements of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what my book is about.</p>
<p>And then the myth, the false reverence,</p>
<p>what are we talking about there?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a way in which we believe</p>
<p>that if we love our country,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somehow wrong to criticize our institutions.</p>
<p>I believe if you love your country,</p>
<p>you wanna encourage your institutions</p>
<p>to get better and better.</p>
<p>I love my university where I work,</p>
<p>but I want it to be better.</p>
<p>We have many flaws.</p>
<p>I love my family,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m constantly telling family members</p>
<p>how they can be better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what true knowledge leadership is about,</p>
<p>not just cheerleading.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the counterpoint to that?</p>
<p>Because the other extreme is a deep,</p>
<p>all-encompassing cynicism towards institutions.</p>
<p>So for me, I like the idea of loving America,</p>
<p>which seems to be sometimes</p>
<p>a politicized statement these days.</p>
<p>That you believe in the ideals of this country.</p>
<p>That seems to be either a naive or a political statement,</p>
<p>the way it&rsquo;s interpreted.</p>
<p>So the flip side of that,</p>
<p>having a healthy skepticism of institutions is good,</p>
<p>but having a complete paralyzing cynicism seems to be bad.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Both are ahistorical positions.</p>
<p>What I try to do as a historian</p>
<p>is work in between those spaces.</p>
<p>The virtue is in the middle ground,</p>
<p>for better or for worse.</p>
<p>And what we have to recognize</p>
<p>is that our institutions are necessary.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason government exists.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason our union was created.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Abraham Lincoln was heroically fighting for.</p>
<p>So we have to believe in our union.</p>
<p>We have to believe in our government.</p>
<p>And we as business people, as intellectuals,</p>
<p>we have to be part of the solution, not the problem.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean just ignoring</p>
<p>the deep flaws in our institutions,</p>
<p>even if we find personally ways to get around them.</p>
<p>What really worries me</p>
<p>is that there are a lot of very intelligent,</p>
<p>well-intentioned people in our society</p>
<p>who have figured out how to live with the flaws</p>
<p>in our institutions,</p>
<p>rather than how to use their skills</p>
<p>to correct the flaws in our institutions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s folks like somebody that lives next door to me,</p>
<p>Michael Malice is an anarchist.</p>
<p>Philosophically, maybe more than practically,</p>
<p>just sort of argues for that position.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thought experiment, I would say.</p>
<p>And so if you have these flaws as institutions,</p>
<p>one thing to do, as the communists did</p>
<p>at the beginning of the 20th century,</p>
<p>is to burn the thing down and start anew.</p>
<p>And the other is to fix from within,</p>
<p>one step, one slow step at a time.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the case for both from a history perspective?</p>
<p>Sure, so historically, there has always been an urge</p>
<p>to burn down the institutions and start again,</p>
<p>start with a blank slate.</p>
<p>The historical record is that almost never works.</p>
<p>Because what happens when you destroy the institutions,</p>
<p>you gave the example of the Bolshevik Revolution.</p>
<p>When you destroy the institutions,</p>
<p>all you do is in the jungle that&rsquo;s left behind,</p>
<p>you give advantages to those who are the most powerful.</p>
<p>Institutions always place certain limits</p>
<p>upon the most powerful in the jungle.</p>
<p>If you go back to the jungle,</p>
<p>the most powerful are actually going</p>
<p>to have the most influence and most control.</p>
<p>So the revolutionaries who are usually the vulnerable</p>
<p>turn out to then be the victims of the revolution.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what we saw</p>
<p>with the French Revolution, with the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>So the record for that is not a great record.</p>
<p>There still might be times to do that.</p>
<p>But I think we should be very cautious about that.</p>
<p>The record for working through institutions</p>
<p>is a much better record.</p>
<p>Now, what we have to be careful about</p>
<p>is as we&rsquo;re working through institutions,</p>
<p>not to become bought into them,</p>
<p>not to become of those institutions.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ve written about in this book</p>
<p>and in other books, my book on Henry Kissinger, for example,</p>
<p>is how it&rsquo;s important when in an institution</p>
<p>to still bring an outsider perspective.</p>
<p>I believe in being an inside outsider.</p>
<p>And I think most of your listeners are inside outsiders.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re people who care about what&rsquo;s going on inside,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re bringing some new ideas from the outside.</p>
<p>I think the correct statement to say</p>
<p>is most of the listeners, most people,</p>
<p>aspire to be inside or outsiders.</p>
<p>But we, human nature is such</p>
<p>that we easily become insider insiders.</p>
<p>So like, we like that idea, but the reality is,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate because of this podcast</p>
<p>to talk to certain folks that live in certain bubbles.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to know when you&rsquo;re in a bubble</p>
<p>that you should get out of the bubble of thought.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really tricky thing because like, yeah,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re, whether it&rsquo;s politics, whether it&rsquo;s science,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s any pursuits in life,</p>
<p>because everybody around you, all your friends,</p>
<p>you have like a little rat race</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re competing with each other.</p>
<p>And then you get a promotion, you get excited,</p>
<p>and you can see how you can get more and more power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a dark, cynical rat race.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the process of life.</p>
<p>And then you forget that you just collectively</p>
<p>have created a set of rules for the game that you&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>You forget that this game doesn&rsquo;t have to have these rules.</p>
<p>You can break them.</p>
<p>This happens in like in Wall Street.</p>
<p>Like the financial system,</p>
<p>everybody starts to like collectively agree</p>
<p>on a set of rules that they play and they don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>like we don&rsquo;t have to be playing this game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really tough.</p>
<p>It takes a special kind of human being</p>
<p>as opposed to being a anti-establishment on everything,</p>
<p>which also gets a lot of attention,</p>
<p>but being just enough anti-establishment</p>
<p>to figure out ideas how to improve the establishment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a tricky place to operate.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I like the word iconoclastic.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to be an iconoclast,</p>
<p>which is to say you love ideas, you&rsquo;re serious about ideas,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re never comfortable with consensus.</p>
<p>And I write about that in this book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about that actually a lot</p>
<p>in the New York Times too.</p>
<p>I think consensus is overstated.</p>
<p>As someone who&rsquo;s half Jewish and half Hindu,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna live in a society where everyone agrees</p>
<p>because my guess is they&rsquo;re gonna come after people like me.</p>
<p>I wanna live in a society that&rsquo;s pluralistic.</p>
<p>This is what Abraham Lincoln was really fighting for</p>
<p>in the Civil War.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what the Civil War is really about</p>
<p>and what my book&rsquo;s about,</p>
<p>which is that we need a society</p>
<p>where institutions encourage, as you say,</p>
<p>different modes of thought</p>
<p>and respect different modes of thought</p>
<p>and work through disagreement.</p>
<p>So a society should not be a society where everyone agrees.</p>
<p>A democratic society should be a society</p>
<p>where people disagree but can still work together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Lincoln vision.</p>
<p>And how do you get there?</p>
<p>I think you get there by having a historical perspective,</p>
<p>always knowing that no matter what moment you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>and no matter what room you&rsquo;re in with really smart people,</p>
<p>there are always things that are missing.</p>
<p>We know that as historians.</p>
<p>No one is clairvoyant and the iconoclast</p>
<p>is looking for the things that have been forgotten,</p>
<p>the silences in the room.</p>
<p>And also, I wonder what kind of skill,</p>
<p>what kind of process is required for the iconoclast</p>
<p>to reveal what is missing to the rest of the room.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not just shouting with a megaphone</p>
<p>that something is missing</p>
<p>because nobody will listen to you.</p>
<p>You have to convince them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s honestly where I have trouble myself</p>
<p>because I often find myself in that iconoclastic role</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t like to hear it.</p>
<p>I like to believe that people are acting out of goodwill,</p>
<p>which I think they usually are,</p>
<p>and that people are open to new ideas.</p>
<p>But you find very quickly,</p>
<p>even those who you think are open-minded,</p>
<p>once they&rsquo;ve committed themselves and put their money</p>
<p>and their reputation on the line,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to hear otherwise.</p>
<p>So in a sense, what you say is bigger</p>
<p>than even being an iconoclast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being able to persuade and work with people</p>
<p>who are afraid of your ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the key is, like in conversations,</p>
<p>is to get people out of a defensive position.</p>
<p>Like, make them realize we&rsquo;re on the same side,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re brothers and sisters, and from that place,</p>
<p>I think you just raise the question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little thought that just lands.</p>
<p>And then, I&rsquo;ve noticed this time and time again,</p>
<p>just a little subtle thing, and then months later,</p>
<p>it percolates somewhere in the mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, all right, that little doubt.</p>
<p>Because I also realize in these battles,</p>
<p>especially political battles,</p>
<p>people often don&rsquo;t have folks on their side</p>
<p>that they can really trust as a fellow human being</p>
<p>to challenge them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very difficult role to be in.</p>
<p>Because in these battles, you kind of have a tribe</p>
<p>and you have a set of ideas,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s another tribe and you have a set of ideas,</p>
<p>and when somebody says something counter to your viewpoint,</p>
<p>you almost always want to put them in the other tribe,</p>
<p>as opposed to having, truly listening to another person.</p>
<p>That takes skill, but ultimately, I think,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way to bridge these divides,</p>
<p>is having these kinds of conversations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m actually, again, optimistically believe</p>
<p>in the power of social media to do that,</p>
<p>if you design it well.</p>
<p>But currently, the battle rages on on Twitter.</p>
<p>Well, I think what you&rsquo;re getting at,</p>
<p>which is so important, is storytelling.</p>
<p>And all the great leaders that I&rsquo;ve studied,</p>
<p>some of whom are in this book, some of whom are not,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re politicians, social activists,</p>
<p>technologists, it&rsquo;s the story that gets people in.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t respond to an argument.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trained, at least in the United States,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re often trained to argue.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re told in a class, okay,</p>
<p>this part of the room, take this position.</p>
<p>This part of the room, take this position.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s helpful, because it forces you</p>
<p>to see different sides of the argument.</p>
<p>But in fact, those on one side</p>
<p>never convince those on the other side through argument.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s through a story that people can identify with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when you bring your argument to life in human terms.</p>
<p>And someone, again, like Abraham Lincoln,</p>
<p>was a master at that.</p>
<p>He told stories.</p>
<p>He found ways to disarm people and to move them</p>
<p>without their even realizing they were being moved.</p>
<p>Yeah, not make it a debate, make it tell a story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Because yes, some of the most convincing politicians,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re arguing a point.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just telling a story.</p>
<p>And it gets in there, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, when we look at what Zelensky has done in Ukraine</p>
<p>in response to the Russian invasion,</p>
<p>and I know you were there on the front lines yourself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s arguing a position that persuaded us.</p>
<p>We already believe what we believed about Russia.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s bringing the story of Ukrainian suffering to life</p>
<p>and making us see the behavior of the Russians</p>
<p>that is moving opinion around the world.</p>
<p>Well, the interesting stuff,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s not actually the story told by the person,</p>
<p>but the story told about the person.</p>
<p>And some of that could be propaganda.</p>
<p>Some of that could be legitimate stories,</p>
<p>which is the fascinating thing.</p>
<p>The power of story is the very power</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s leveraged by propaganda to convince the populace.</p>
<p>But the idea, one of the most powerful ideas</p>
<p>when I traveled in Ukraine,</p>
<p>and in general to me personally,</p>
<p>the idea that President Zelensky stayed in Kiev</p>
<p>in the early days of war on everybody,</p>
<p>from his inner circle to the United States,</p>
<p>everybody in the West, the NATO,</p>
<p>everybody was telling him.</p>
<p>And even on the Russian side,</p>
<p>I assumed they thought he would leave, he would escape.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>From foolishness or from heroism, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a story that I think united the country.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a small thing, but it&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most basic of all human stories,</p>
<p>the story of human courage.</p>
<p>Yeah, courage.</p>
<p>And I remember watching his social media feed on that.</p>
<p>And he was standing outside, not even in a bunker,</p>
<p>standing outside in Kiev, right?</p>
<p>As the Russian forces are attacking and saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here, and this minister is here,</p>
<p>and this minister is here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not corrupt.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not stooges of the Americans who told us to leave.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re staying because we care about Ukraine.</p>
<p>And the story of courage, I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the story that babies grow up</p>
<p>seeing their parents as courageous, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most natural of all stories.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also the stories for better or worse</p>
<p>that are told throughout history.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because stories of courage and stories of evil,</p>
<p>those are the two extremes, are the ones that are kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a nice mechanism to tell the stories of wars,</p>
<p>of conflicts, of struggles, all of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>The tension between those two.</p>
<p>And the reason I believe studying history</p>
<p>and writing about history is so essential</p>
<p>is because it gives us more stories.</p>
<p>The problem with much of our world, I think,</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re confronted by data.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re confronted by information.</p>
<p>And of course it&rsquo;s valuable,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s easy to manipulate or misuse information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the stories that give us a structure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the stories where we find morality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the stories where we find political value.</p>
<p>And what do you get from studying history?</p>
<p>You learn more stories about more people.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a sucker for courage, for stories of courage.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been in too many rooms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often seen too many people sort of in subtle ways</p>
<p>sacrifice their integrity and did nothing.</p>
<p>And people that step up when the opinion is unpopular</p>
<p>and they do something where they really put themselves</p>
<p>on the line, whether it&rsquo;s their money,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s their wellbeing, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That gives me hope about humanity.</p>
<p>And of course, during the war, like Ukraine,</p>
<p>you see that more and more.</p>
<p>Now, other people have a very cynical perspective of it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s saying, oh, those are just narratives</p>
<p>that are constructed for propaganda purposes and so on.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve seen it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s heroes out there.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re both small and big.</p>
<p>So just regular citizens and leaders.</p>
<p>One set of heroes I learned about writing this book</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t know about that I should have</p>
<p>are more than 100,000 former slaves</p>
<p>who become Union soldiers during the Civil War.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an extraordinary story.</p>
<p>We think of it as North versus South,</p>
<p>white Northern troops versus white Southern troops.</p>
<p>There are, as I said, more than 100,000 slaves,</p>
<p>no education, never anything other than slaves</p>
<p>who flee their plantations, join the Union Army.</p>
<p>And what I found in the research,</p>
<p>and other historians have written about this too,</p>
<p>is they become some of the most courageous soldiers</p>
<p>because they know what they&rsquo;re fighting for,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something more to it than that.</p>
<p>It seems in their stories that there is a humanity,</p>
<p>a human desire for freedom</p>
<p>and a human desire to improve oneself,</p>
<p>even for those who have been denied</p>
<p>even the most basic rights for all of their lives.</p>
<p>And I think that story should be inspiring</p>
<p>to all of us as a story of courage</p>
<p>because we all deal with difficulties,</p>
<p>but none of us are starting from slavery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really powerful that that flame,</p>
<p>the longing for freedom can&rsquo;t be extinguished</p>
<p>through the generations of slavery.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something you talk about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some deep sense in which</p>
<p>while the war was about in part about slavery,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not, the slaves themselves fought for their freedom.</p>
<p>And they won their freedom.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a war about slavery.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a war about freedom.</p>
<p>Because if you say it&rsquo;s a war about slavery,</p>
<p>then it sounds like it&rsquo;s an argument</p>
<p>between the slave masters and the other white guys</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t want slavery to exist.</p>
<p>And of course that argument did exist,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t, it was a war over freedom,</p>
<p>especially after 1863 into the second year of the war</p>
<p>when Lincoln, because of war pressures,</p>
<p>signs the Emancipation Proclamation,</p>
<p>which therefore says that the contraband,</p>
<p>the property of Southerners, i.e. their slaves,</p>
<p>will now be freed and brought into the Union Army.</p>
<p>That makes it about freedom.</p>
<p>Already the slaves were leaving the plantations.</p>
<p>They knew what was going on</p>
<p>and they were gonna get out of slavery</p>
<p>as soon as they could.</p>
<p>But now it becomes a war over freeing them,</p>
<p>over opening that opportunity for them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how the war ends.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really important, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we are in our politics today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same debate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why I wrote this book.</p>
<p>The challenge of our time is to understand</p>
<p>how do we make our society open</p>
<p>to more freedom for more people?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go to the beginning.</p>
<p>How did the American Civil War start and why?</p>
<p>So the American Civil War starts</p>
<p>because of our flawed institutions.</p>
<p>The founders had mixed views of slavery,</p>
<p>but they wanted a system that would eventually</p>
<p>work its way toward opening for more people of more kinds.</p>
<p>Not necessarily equality,</p>
<p>but they wanted a more open democratic system.</p>
<p>But our institutions were designed in ways</p>
<p>that gave disproportionate power to slave holders</p>
<p>in particular states in the Union,</p>
<p>through the Senate, through the Electoral College,</p>
<p>through many of the institutions</p>
<p>we talk about in our politics today.</p>
<p>Therefore, that part of the country</p>
<p>was in the words of Abraham Lincoln,</p>
<p>holding the rest of the country hostage.</p>
<p>For a poor white man like Abraham Lincoln,</p>
<p>born in Kentucky, who makes his way in Illinois,</p>
<p>slavery was an evil, not just for moral reasons.</p>
<p>It was an evil because it denied him democratic opportunity.</p>
<p>Why would anyone hire poor Abe to do something</p>
<p>if they could get a slave to do it for free?</p>
<p>An economy of opportunity for him</p>
<p>had to be an economy that was open</p>
<p>and that did not have slavery,</p>
<p>particularly in the new states</p>
<p>that were coming into the Union.</p>
<p>Lincoln was one of the creators of the Republican Party,</p>
<p>which was a party dedicated</p>
<p>to making sure all new territory was open</p>
<p>to anyone who was willing to work,</p>
<p>any male figure who would be paid for their work.</p>
<p>Free labor, free soil, free men, basic capitalism.</p>
<p>Southerners, Southern plantation owners</p>
<p>were an aristocracy that did not want that.</p>
<p>They wanted to use slavery</p>
<p>and expand slavery into the new territories.</p>
<p>What caused the Civil War?</p>
<p>The clash and our institutions that were unable to adapt</p>
<p>and continue to give disproportionate power</p>
<p>to these Southern plantation slave owners.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court was dominated by them.</p>
<p>Senate was dominated by them.</p>
<p>And so the Republican Party came into power</p>
<p>as a critique of that.</p>
<p>And Southerners unwilling to accept,</p>
<p>Southern Confederates unwilling to accept that change</p>
<p>went to war with the Union.</p>
<p>So who was on each side, the Union, Confederates?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>What are the states?</p>
<p>How many people?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s like the demographics and the dynamics of each side?</p>
<p>The Union side is much, much larger, right?</p>
<p>In terms of population, I think about 22 million people.</p>
<p>And it is what we would today recognize</p>
<p>as all the states basically North of Virginia.</p>
<p>The South is the states</p>
<p>in the South of the Mason-Dixon line.</p>
<p>So Virginia and there on South, West through Tennessee.</p>
<p>So Texas, for example, is in the Confederacy.</p>
<p>Tennessee is in the Confederacy.</p>
<p>But other states like Missouri are border states.</p>
<p>And the Confederacy is a much smaller entity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made up of about 9 million people</p>
<p>plus about 4 million slaves.</p>
<p>And it is a agricultural economy,</p>
<p>whereas the Northern economy</p>
<p>is a more industrializing economy.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the Confederate States</p>
<p>are in some ways more international</p>
<p>than the Northern states</p>
<p>because they are exporters of cotton, exporters of tobacco.</p>
<p>So they actually have very strong</p>
<p>international economic ties,</p>
<p>very strong ties to Great Britain.</p>
<p>The United States was the largest source of cotton</p>
<p>to the world before the Civil War.</p>
<p>Egypt replaces that a little bit during the Civil War.</p>
<p>But all the English textiles</p>
<p>were American cotton from the South.</p>
<p>And so it is the Southern half of what we would call</p>
<p>the Eastern part of the United States today</p>
<p>with far fewer people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made up, the Confederacy is, of landed families.</p>
<p>Wealth in the Confederacy was land and slaves.</p>
<p>The Northern United States is made up predominantly</p>
<p>of small business owners</p>
<p>and then larger financial interests,</p>
<p>such as the banks in New York.</p>
<p>And what about the military?</p>
<p>Who are the people that picked up guns?</p>
<p>What are the numbers there?</p>
<p>So the Union also outnumbered the Confederacy.</p>
<p>By far, but this is a really interesting question</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no conscription in the Constitution.</p>
<p>Unlike most other countries,</p>
<p>our democracy is formed on the presumption</p>
<p>that human beings should not be forced</p>
<p>to go into the military if they don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>Most democracies in the world today</p>
<p>actually still require military service.</p>
<p>The United States has very rarely in its history done that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in our Constitution.</p>
<p>So during the Civil War,</p>
<p>in the first months and years of the Civil War,</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln has to go to the different states,</p>
<p>to the governors and ask the governors for volunteers.</p>
<p>So the men who take up arms,</p>
<p>especially in the first months of the war,</p>
<p>are volunteers in the North.</p>
<p>In the South, they&rsquo;re actually conscripted.</p>
<p>And then as the war goes on,</p>
<p>the Union will pass the Conscription Acts of 1862 and 1863,</p>
<p>which for the first time,</p>
<p>and this is really important</p>
<p>because it creates new presidential powers.</p>
<p>For the first time,</p>
<p>Lincoln will have presidential power</p>
<p>to force men into the army,</p>
<p>which is what leads to all kinds of draft riots</p>
<p>in New York and elsewhere.</p>
<p>But suffice it to say,</p>
<p>the Union Army throughout the war</p>
<p>is often three times the size of the Confederate Army.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the relationship between this no conscription</p>
<p>and people standing up to fight for ideas</p>
<p>and the Second Amendment?</p>
<p>A well-regulated militia being necessary</p>
<p>to the security of a free state,</p>
<p>the right of the people to keep and bear arms</p>
<p>shall not be infringed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in Texas.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the role of that in this story?</p>
<p>The American population is already armed before the war.</p>
<p>And so even though the Union and the Confederate Armies</p>
<p>will manufacture and purchase arms,</p>
<p>it is already an armed population.</p>
<p>So the American presumption going into the war</p>
<p>is that citizens will not be forced to serve,</p>
<p>but they will serve in militias</p>
<p>to protect their own property.</p>
<p>And so the Second Amendment,</p>
<p>the key part of the Second Amendment for me as a historian</p>
<p>is the well-regulated militia part.</p>
<p>The presumption that citizens as part of their civic duty</p>
<p>do not have a duty to join a national army,</p>
<p>Prussian style,</p>
<p>but are supposed to be involved</p>
<p>in defending their communities.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a bit of a myth.</p>
<p>And so Americans have throughout their history</p>
<p>been gun owners, not AK-47 owners, but gun owners.</p>
<p>And gun ownership has been for the purpose</p>
<p>of community self-defense.</p>
<p>The question coming out of that is,</p>
<p>what does that mean in terms of,</p>
<p>do you have access to everything?</p>
<p>Antonin Scalia, even himself,</p>
<p>asked this question on the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>You know, he said in one of the gun cases,</p>
<p>you have the right to defend yourself,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have the right to own an Uzi.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have the right to have a tank.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d let you park a tank, Lex,</p>
<p>in your parking spot, right?</p>
<p>I looked into this.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a gray area around tanks, actually.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re legit allowed to own a tank.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, somebody look into this.</p>
<p>Somebody told me, but I could see that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very difficult for that to get out of hand.</p>
<p>Okay, there may be one guy in a tank.</p>
<p>You could be breaking laws in terms of the width</p>
<p>of the vehicle that you&rsquo;re using to operate.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s a hilarious discussion.</p>
<p>But, so then to make the case,</p>
<p>speaking of AK-47s and rifles,</p>
<p>and back to Ukraine for a second.</p>
<p>One of the fascinating social experiments</p>
<p>that happened in Ukraine at the beginning of the war</p>
<p>is they handed out guns to everybody, rifles.</p>
<p>And crime went down, which I think is really interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I hope somebody does a kind of psychological</p>
<p>data collection analysis effort here</p>
<p>to try to understand why.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not obvious to me that in a time of war,</p>
<p>if you give guns to the entire populace,</p>
<p>anyone who wants a gun, it&rsquo;s not going to,</p>
<p>especially in a country who has historically suffered</p>
<p>from corruption, not result in robberies,</p>
<p>and assaults, and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deep lesson there.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if you can extend</p>
<p>that lesson beyond wartime, though.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>What happens after the war?</p>
<p>I mean, my inclination would be to say,</p>
<p>that can work during war,</p>
<p>but you have to take the guns back after the war.</p>
<p>But they might be very upset when you try to take the guns.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s precisely the problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually part of the story here.</p>
<p>I mean, what happens after the Civil War,</p>
<p>after Appomattox in 1865,</p>
<p>is that many Southern soldiers go home with their guns,</p>
<p>and they misuse their weapons to, quite frankly,</p>
<p>shoot and intimidate former slaves who are now citizens.</p>
<p>This is a big problem.</p>
<p>I talk about this in the book in Memphis in 1866.</p>
<p>It is former Confederate soldiers, and police officers,</p>
<p>and judges who are responsible for hundreds of rapes</p>
<p>within a two-day period,</p>
<p>and destroying an entire community of African-Americans.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re able to do that</p>
<p>because they brought their guns home.</p>
<p>But underneath the issue of guns there</p>
<p>is just the fundamental issue of hatred</p>
<p>and inability to see other humans in this world</p>
<p>as having equal value as another human being.</p>
<p>What was the election of 1860 like</p>
<p>that brought Lincoln to power?</p>
<p>So the election of 1860 was a very divisive election.</p>
<p>We have divisive contested elections</p>
<p>from 1860, really, until 1896.</p>
<p>The 1860 election is the first election</p>
<p>where a Republican is elected president, that is Lincoln,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s elected president with less than 40% of the vote</p>
<p>because you have two sets of Democrats running,</p>
<p>Democrats who are out to defend the Confederacy</p>
<p>and everything, and then Democrats who want to compromise</p>
<p>but still keep slavery, most famous Stephen Douglas,</p>
<p>who argues for basically allowing each state</p>
<p>to make its own decisions, popular sovereignty,</p>
<p>as he called it.</p>
<p>And then you still have traditional Whigs who are running.</p>
<p>That was the party that preceded the Republican Party.</p>
<p>So you have four candidates.</p>
<p>Lincoln wins a plurality.</p>
<p>Lincoln is elected largely because the states</p>
<p>that are anti-slavery or anti-expansion of slavery</p>
<p>are not a majority, but they&rsquo;re a plurality.</p>
<p>And the other states have basically factionalized,</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;re unable to have a united front against him.</p>
<p>Was the main topic at hand slavery?</p>
<p>I think the main topic at hand at that time</p>
<p>was the expansion of slavery into new territories.</p>
<p>Into new territories.</p>
<p>Right, it was not, whether to abolish slavery or not,</p>
<p>Lincoln is very careful, and his correspondence is clear.</p>
<p>He wants no one on his side during the election</p>
<p>to say that he&rsquo;s arguing for abolitionism,</p>
<p>even though he personally supported that.</p>
<p>What he wants to say is the Republican Party</p>
<p>is for no new slave territories.</p>
<p>Did he make it clear that he was for abolition?</p>
<p>No, he was intentionally unclear about that.</p>
<p>Do you think he was throughout his life?</p>
<p>Was there a deep, because that takes quite a vision.</p>
<p>Like you look at society today,</p>
<p>and it takes quite a man to see</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something deeply broken,</p>
<p>where a lot of people take for granted.</p>
<p>I mean, into modern day, you could see factory farming</p>
<p>as one of those things that in a hundred years</p>
<p>we might see as like the torture,</p>
<p>the mass torture of animals could be seen as evil.</p>
<p>But just to look around and wake up to that,</p>
<p>especially in a leadership position.</p>
<p>Yeah, was he able to see that?</p>
<p>In some ways, yes, in some ways, no.</p>
<p>I mean, the premise of your question is really important,</p>
<p>that to us, it&rsquo;s obvious that slavery is a horror.</p>
<p>But to those who had grown up with it,</p>
<p>who had grown up seeing that,</p>
<p>it was hard to imagine a different world.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right, Lincoln&rsquo;s imagination,</p>
<p>like everyone else&rsquo;s, was limited by his time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Lincoln imagined a world</p>
<p>of equality between the races,</p>
<p>but he had come to see that slavery was horrible.</p>
<p>And historians have differed in how he came to this.</p>
<p>Part of it is that he had a father</p>
<p>who treated him like a slave.</p>
<p>And you can see in his early correspondence</p>
<p>how much he hates that his father,</p>
<p>who was a struggling farmer,</p>
<p>was basically trying to control Lincoln&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>And he came to understand personally,</p>
<p>I think, how horrible it is to have someone else</p>
<p>tell you what you should do with your labor,</p>
<p>not giving you your own choices.</p>
<p>But Lincoln was also a pragmatist.</p>
<p>This is what made him a great politician.</p>
<p>He wanted to work through institutions,</p>
<p>not to burn them down.</p>
<p>And he famously said that if he could preserve the Union</p>
<p>and stop the spread of slavery</p>
<p>by allowing slavery to stay in the South, he would.</p>
<p>If he could do it by eliminating slavery in the South,</p>
<p>he would.</p>
<p>If he could do it by buying the slaves</p>
<p>and sending them somewhere else, he would.</p>
<p>His main goal, what he ran on,</p>
<p>was that the new territories west of Illinois,</p>
<p>that they would be areas for free,</p>
<p>poor white men like him, not slavery.</p>
<p>What do you learn about human nature</p>
<p>if we step back and look at the big picture of it?</p>
<p>That slavery has been a part of human civilization</p>
<p>for thousands of years.</p>
<p>That this American slavery is not a new phenomenon.</p>
<p>I think history teaches us a very pessimistic</p>
<p>and a very optimistic lesson.</p>
<p>The pessimistic lesson is that human beings</p>
<p>are capable of doing enormous harm and brutality</p>
<p>to their fellow man and woman.</p>
<p>And we see that with genocide in our world today.</p>
<p>That human beings are capable, with the right stimuli,</p>
<p>the right incentives, of enslaving others.</p>
<p>I mean, genocide is in the same category, right?</p>
<p>The optimistic side is that human beings</p>
<p>are also capable, with proper leadership and governance,</p>
<p>of resisting those urges.</p>
<p>Of putting those energies into productive uses</p>
<p>for other people.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that comes naturally.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where leadership and institutions matter.</p>
<p>But leadership and institutions can tame us.</p>
<p>We can tame, we can civilize ourselves.</p>
<p>For a long time, we stopped using that verb, to civilize.</p>
<p>I believe in civilization.</p>
<p>I believe there&rsquo;s a civilizing role.</p>
<p>Lincoln spoke of that, right?</p>
<p>So did Franklin Roosevelt.</p>
<p>The civilizing role that government plays.</p>
<p>Education is only a part of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s creating laws, minimal laws, but laws nonetheless,</p>
<p>that incentivize and penalize us for going to the dark side.</p>
<p>But if we allow that to happen,</p>
<p>or we have leaders who encourage us to go to the dark side,</p>
<p>we can very quickly go down a deep, dark tunnel.</p>
<p>See, I believe that most people want to do good.</p>
<p>And the power of institutions, if done well,</p>
<p>they encourage and protect you if you want to do good.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re just in the jungle,</p>
<p>from a game theoretic perspective,</p>
<p>you get punished for doing good.</p>
<p>So being extremely self-centered and greedy,</p>
<p>and even violent and manipulative,</p>
<p>can have, from a game theory perspective, benefits.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what most humans want.</p>
<p>Institutions allow you to do what you actually want,</p>
<p>which is to do good for the world, do good for others,</p>
<p>and actually in so doing, do good for yourself.</p>
<p>Institutions protect that natural human instinct, I think.</p>
<p>And what you just articulated,</p>
<p>which I think the historical record is very strong on,</p>
<p>is the classic liberal position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what liberalism means in a 19th century sense, right?</p>
<p>That you believe in civilizing human beings</p>
<p>through institutions.</p>
<p>That begins with education.</p>
<p>Kindergarten is an institution.</p>
<p>Laws, and just basic habits that are enforced by society.</p>
<p>How do you think people thought about the idea,</p>
<p>how do they square the idea of all men are created equal,</p>
<p>those very powerful words at the founding of this nation?</p>
<p>How do they square that with slavery?</p>
<p>For many Americans,</p>
<p>saying all men were created equal required slavery.</p>
<p>Because it meant that the equality of white people</p>
<p>was dependent upon others doing the work for us.</p>
<p>In the way some people view animal labor today.</p>
<p>And maybe in 50 years, we&rsquo;ll see that as a contradiction.</p>
<p>But the notion among many Americans</p>
<p>in the 17th, 18th century,</p>
<p>and this would also be true for those in other societies,</p>
<p>was that equality for white men</p>
<p>meant that you had access to the labor of others</p>
<p>that would allow you to equalize other differences.</p>
<p>So you could produce enough food</p>
<p>so your family could live equally well nourished</p>
<p>as other families, because you had slaves on the land</p>
<p>doing the farming for you.</p>
<p>This is Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like animal farm.</p>
<p>All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s still the way people view things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a liberal position</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just a human position</p>
<p>that all humans have equal value.</p>
<p>Just on the basic level of humanity.</p>
<p>But do we really believe that?</p>
<p>We want to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if our society really believes that yet.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s super complicated, of course,</p>
<p>when you realize the amount of suffering</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on in the world,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s children dying from starvation in Africa,</p>
<p>and to say that all humans are equal,</p>
<p>well, a few dollars can save their life.</p>
<p>And instead we buy a Starbucks coffee</p>
<p>and are willing to pay 10, 50, $100,000</p>
<p>to save a child, our child,</p>
<p>like somebody from our family,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t want to spend $2 to save a child over in Africa.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, and I think Sam Harris or others</p>
<p>have talked about like,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t want to live in a world</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;d rather send $2 to Africa.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something deeply human about saving those</p>
<p>that are really close to you, the ones we love.</p>
<p>So that like hypocrisy that seems to go at tension</p>
<p>with the basic ethics of alleviating suffering in the world,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also really human.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also part of this ideal of all men are created equal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complicated, messy world, ethically.</p>
<p>It is, but I mean, I think,</p>
<p>at least the way I think about it is,</p>
<p>so what are the things even within our own society</p>
<p>where we choose to do something with our resources</p>
<p>that actually doesn&rsquo;t help the lives of many people?</p>
<p>So we invest in all kinds of things</p>
<p>that are often because someone is lobbying for them.</p>
<p>This happens on both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>This is not a political statement, right?</p>
<p>Rather than saying, you know,</p>
<p>if we invested a little more of our money,</p>
<p>really a little more,</p>
<p>we can make sure every child in this country</p>
<p>had decent healthcare.</p>
<p>We can make sure every child in this country</p>
<p>had what they needed to start life healthy.</p>
<p>And that would not require us to sacrifice a lot,</p>
<p>but it would require us to sacrifice a few things.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s a balance there.</p>
<p>And I also noticed the passive-aggressive statement</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making about how I&rsquo;m spending my money.</p>
<p>Hey, well, me too.</p>
<p>Spending it a little more wisely.</p>
<p>You know, I like to eat nice meals at nice restaurants,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m as guilty of this as you are.</p>
<p>I got a couch,</p>
<p>and that couch serves no purpose.</p>
<p>It looks nice, though.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a nice-looking couch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice-looking couch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually very clean.</p>
<p>I got it for occasional Instagram photos</p>
<p>to look like an adult.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because everything else in my life is a giant mess.</p>
<p>What role did the ideas that the founding documents</p>
<p>of this country play in this war,</p>
<p>the war between the Union and the Confederate States,</p>
<p>and the founding ideas that were supposed</p>
<p>to be unifying to this country?</p>
<p>Is there interesting tensions there?</p>
<p>Well, there were certainly tensions</p>
<p>because built into the founding documents,</p>
<p>of course, is slavery and inequality</p>
<p>and women&rsquo;s exclusion from voting and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But the real brilliance of Abraham Lincoln</p>
<p>is to build on the brilliance of the founders</p>
<p>and turn the Union position into the defense</p>
<p>of the core ideas of the country.</p>
<p>So the Confederacy is defending one idea,</p>
<p>the idea of slavery.</p>
<p>Lincoln takes the basket of all the deeper ideas</p>
<p>and puts them together.</p>
<p>Three things the war is about for Lincoln.</p>
<p>And this is why his speeches still resonate with us today.</p>
<p>Every time I&rsquo;m in Washington, I go to the Lincoln Memorial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best memorial or best monument,</p>
<p>I think, in the world, actually.</p>
<p>And there are always people there</p>
<p>reading the Gettysburg Address and the Second Inaugural.</p>
<p>Lincoln had two years of education,</p>
<p>yet he found the words to describe</p>
<p>what our country was about better than anyone.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because he went back to these founding values,</p>
<p>three values.</p>
<p>We already talked about one, freedom.</p>
<p>And freedom is actually complex, but it&rsquo;s also simple.</p>
<p>The simple Lincoln definition is that freedom</p>
<p>is the right of each person to work for himself or herself.</p>
<p>Which is to say, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you own your own company,</p>
<p>but it means you control your labor.</p>
<p>And no one can tell you</p>
<p>you have to work for a certain wage.</p>
<p>You might not have a job, but you decide.</p>
<p>You decide, right?</p>
<p>You can see where that comes from his own background</p>
<p>as a poor man, right?</p>
<p>So freedom is the control of your own labor.</p>
<p>Second, democracy.</p>
<p>Government of the people, by the people, for the people.</p>
<p>The government is to serve the people,</p>
<p>is to come from the people.</p>
<p>And then the third point,</p>
<p>justice and helping all human beings.</p>
<p>He, at the end of his life, as the Civil War is ending,</p>
<p>he never declares that the South should be punished.</p>
<p>His argument is that we shouldn&rsquo;t apologize</p>
<p>for their misdeeds,</p>
<p>but that all should be part of this future.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not arguing for consensus.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s arguing for a society</p>
<p>where everyone has a stake going forward.</p>
<p>So justice, democracy, freedom.</p>
<p>Those are the gifts.</p>
<p>I talked about the flaws in our system.</p>
<p>Those are the virtues in our system</p>
<p>that our founders, coming out of the Enlightenment, planted.</p>
<p>And Lincoln carries them forward.</p>
<p>He gives us the 2.0 version of them.</p>
<p>So a few tangent questions about each of those.</p>
<p>So one on democracy,</p>
<p>people often bring up the United States</p>
<p>as not a democracy, it&rsquo;s a republic,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s representative.</p>
<p>Is there some interesting tensions there in terminology,</p>
<p>or is, yeah, can you maybe kind of expand</p>
<p>on the different versions of democracy?</p>
<p>So the philosophy of democracy,</p>
<p>but also the practical implementations of it.</p>
<p>Sure, the founders intended for us to be a democracy.</p>
<p>This argument that they wanted us to be a republic</p>
<p>instead of a democracy is one of these made-up myths.</p>
<p>They believed that, fundamentally,</p>
<p>what they were creating was a society,</p>
<p>very few of which had existed before,</p>
<p>a society where the government would be of the people,</p>
<p>by the people, for the people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they expected, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it meant.</p>
<p>So the legitimacy of our government</p>
<p>was not gonna be that the person in charge</p>
<p>was of royal blood, that&rsquo;s the way the Europeans did it,</p>
<p>or that the person in charge had killed enough people,</p>
<p>a la Genghis Khan, or that the person in charge</p>
<p>was serving a particular class.</p>
<p>It was that the person in charge,</p>
<p>the institutions were to serve the people.</p>
<p>They adopted Republican tools to get there,</p>
<p>because they were fearful, appropriately,</p>
<p>of simply throwing every issue up to the masses.</p>
<p>Democracy is not mob rule.</p>
<p>Democracy is where you create procedures</p>
<p>to assess the public will,</p>
<p>and to act in ways that serve the public</p>
<p>without harming other elements of the public</p>
<p>that are not in the majority.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have a Constitution and a Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>And for their time, the founders did not believe</p>
<p>that women should be part of this discussion,</p>
<p>that they were not capable.</p>
<p>They were wrong about that in their time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they thought.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve, of course, changed that.</p>
<p>They believed you had to have property to have a stake.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t believe that anymore.</p>
<p>So we can argue over the details,</p>
<p>and those 50 years from now will criticize us, right,</p>
<p>for the way we think about these things.</p>
<p>But it was fundamentally about,</p>
<p>this is the radicalism of the American experiment.</p>
<p>That government should serve the people, all people.</p>
<p>So democracy means of the people,</p>
<p>by the people, for the people.</p>
<p>And then it doesn&rsquo;t actually give any details</p>
<p>of how you implement that,</p>
<p>because you could implement all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>And I think what we&rsquo;ve learned as historians,</p>
<p>I think what the founders knew,</p>
<p>because they were very well-read</p>
<p>in the history of Rome and Greece,</p>
<p>was that democracy will always have unique characteristics</p>
<p>for the culture that it&rsquo;s in.</p>
<p>If coming out of the war against Russia,</p>
<p>Ukraine is able to build a better democracy</p>
<p>than it had before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never gonna look like the United States.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s gonna be worse or better.</p>
<p>A culture matters.</p>
<p>The particular history of societies matters.</p>
<p>Japan is a vibrant democracy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there many times.</p>
<p>It does not look at all like the American democracy.</p>
<p>So democracy is a set of values.</p>
<p>The implementation of those values</p>
<p>is a set of practical institutional decisions</p>
<p>one makes based in one&rsquo;s cultural position.</p>
<p>So just to linger on that topic,</p>
<p>is there, if you do representative,</p>
<p>you said democracy should not,</p>
<p>one failure mode is mob rule.</p>
<p>So it should not descend into that.</p>
<p>Not every issue should be up to everybody.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Okay, so you have representation,</p>
<p>but Stalin similarly felt</p>
<p>that he could represent the interests of the public.</p>
<p>He was also helping represent the interests of the public.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a failure mode too.</p>
<p>If the people representing the public</p>
<p>become more and more powerful,</p>
<p>they start becoming detached</p>
<p>from actually being able to represent</p>
<p>or having just the basic human sense</p>
<p>of what the public wants.</p>
<p>I think being of the people, by the people, for the people</p>
<p>means you are in some way accountable to the people.</p>
<p>And the problem with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>this was already evident before Stalin came into power,</p>
<p>is the same problem the Communist Party of China has today,</p>
<p>which is that you have leadership that&rsquo;s non-accountable.</p>
<p>Well, let me go then</p>
<p>to one of the other three principles of freedom,</p>
<p>because one of the ways to keep government accountable</p>
<p>is the freedom of the press.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the internet, and on the internet,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s social networks, and one of them is called Twitter.</p>
<p>I think you have an account there, people should follow you.</p>
<p>And recently, people have been throwing around recently,</p>
<p>for a while, the words of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, for a tangent upon a tangent,</p>
<p>what do you think of freedom of speech,</p>
<p>as it is today, and as it was at that time,</p>
<p>during the Civil War, after the Civil War,</p>
<p>and throughout the history of America?</p>
<p>So freedom of speech has always been</p>
<p>one of the core tenets of American democracy,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m near absolutist on it,</p>
<p>because I think that people should have the right to speak.</p>
<p>What makes our democracy function</p>
<p>is that there is always room for, quite frankly,</p>
<p>people like you and me, who like to disagree,</p>
<p>and have reasons to disagree.</p>
<p>So I am against almost all forms of censorship.</p>
<p>The only time I believe in censorship</p>
<p>is if somehow an individual or a newspaper</p>
<p>has stolen the Ukrainian plans</p>
<p>for their next military movements in the next week.</p>
<p>You should not be able to publish that right now,</p>
<p>maybe after they act.</p>
<p>Criticism, opinion, interpretation should be wide open.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean, though,</p>
<p>that you have the right to come to my classroom</p>
<p>and start shouting and saying whatever you want.</p>
<p>You have the right on the street corner to do that,</p>
<p>but my classroom is a classroom for my students</p>
<p>with a particular purpose.</p>
<p>Sorry about that from last week,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never do it again, I apologize.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I get drunk, and I get&hellip;</p>
<p>To the people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a professor at UT Austin, and it&rsquo;s nearby,</p>
<p>so sometimes I get a little drunk and wander in there.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not the only one.</p>
<p>Was that you?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know it was you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So the point is that free speech</p>
<p>is not licensed to invade someone else&rsquo;s space,</p>
<p>and I also believe in private enterprise.</p>
<p>So I think that if I owned a social media network, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It would be up to me to decide</p>
<p>who gets to speak on that network and who doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and then people could decide not to use it</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t want to use it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>So yes, that&rsquo;s one of the founding principles.</p>
<p>So oftentimes when you talk about censorship,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s government censorship.</p>
<p>So social media, if you run a social media company,</p>
<p>you should be able to decide from a technical perspective</p>
<p>of what freedom of speech means.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some deeper ethical, philosophical sense</p>
<p>of how do you create a world where every voice is heard</p>
<p>of the people, by the people, for the people?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a complicated technical problem.</p>
<p>When you have a public square,</p>
<p>how do you have a productive conversation</p>
<p>where critics aren&rsquo;t silenced,</p>
<p>but at the same time, whoever has the bigger megaphone</p>
<p>is not gonna crowd out everybody else?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s very important to create rules of the game</p>
<p>that give everyone a chance to get started</p>
<p>and that allow for guideposts to be created</p>
<p>from the will of the community,</p>
<p>which is to say that we as a community can say,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t stop people from speaking,</p>
<p>but we as a community can say that in certain forms,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna create certain rules</p>
<p>for who gets to speak and who doesn&rsquo;t, under what terms,</p>
<p>but they can still have somewhere else to go.</p>
<p>So I believe in opening space for everyone,</p>
<p>but creating certain spaces within those spaces</p>
<p>that are designed for certain purposes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a school does.</p>
<p>So I will not bring someone to speak to my students</p>
<p>who is unqualified.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a political judgment.</p>
<p>The rules at a university,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re an educational institution,</p>
<p>you need to have the educational credentials</p>
<p>to come speak about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna bring some bum off the street to do that.</p>
<p>We have certain rules,</p>
<p>but that bum on the street can still,</p>
<p>in his own space or her own space,</p>
<p>can still say what he or she wants to say</p>
<p>about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>This is how newspapers work.</p>
<p>When I write for the New York Times,</p>
<p>they have an editorial team.</p>
<p>The editorial team makes certain decisions.</p>
<p>They check facts, and there are certain points of view.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t allow anti-Semitic comments, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna be able to publish an anti-Semitic screed,</p>
<p>whether you think it&rsquo;s true or not true</p>
<p>in the New York Times,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from finding somewhere else.</p>
<p>So we allow entities to create certain rules of the game.</p>
<p>We make transparent what those rules are,</p>
<p>and then we, as citizens,</p>
<p>know where to go to get our information.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been a problem the last few decades, I think,</p>
<p>is it hasn&rsquo;t been clear</p>
<p>what the rules are in different places</p>
<p>and what are the legitimate places to get information</p>
<p>and what are not.</p>
<p>Yeah, the transparency seems to be very critical there.</p>
<p>Even for the New York Times,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of skepticism</p>
<p>about which way the editorial processes lean.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a public perception that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>especially for opinions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be very left-leaning in the New York Times.</p>
<p>And without transparency</p>
<p>about what the process is like,</p>
<p>about the people involved,</p>
<p>all you do, like,</p>
<p>conspiracy theories and the general public opinion</p>
<p>about that is going to go wild.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s okay for the New York Times.</p>
<p>People can, in a collective way, figure stuff out.</p>
<p>Like, they can say, okay, New York Times,</p>
<p>73% of the time is gonna lean left in their head.</p>
<p>They have a loose estimation or whatever.</p>
<p>But for a platform like Twitter,</p>
<p>it seems like it&rsquo;s more complicated.</p>
<p>Of course, there should be rules of the game,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>maybe I wanna say a responsibility</p>
<p>to also create incentives</p>
<p>for people to do high-effort empathetic debate</p>
<p>versus throwing poop at each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think those are two slightly different things,</p>
<p>though I agree.</p>
<p>I think that my view is that the failure of Facebook</p>
<p>and Twitter and others in recent years</p>
<p>has been that they have been completely</p>
<p>untransparent about their rules.</p>
<p>So what I would think would advance us</p>
<p>is if they had a set of rules that were clear,</p>
<p>that were consistently followed,</p>
<p>and we understood what they were,</p>
<p>that would also tell us as consumers</p>
<p>what the biases are,</p>
<p>how to understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>It seems, if I might say,</p>
<p>that since Elon Musk has taken over Twitter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been arbitrary in who&rsquo;s thrown off</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s not thrown off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real problem.</p>
<p>Arbitrariness is in some ways the opposite of democracy.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a hidden arbitrariness</p>
<p>in interpretation of the rules.</p>
<p>So for example, what comment incites violence?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, really difficult to figure out to me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gray area.</p>
<p>Obviously, there&rsquo;s very clear versions of that,</p>
<p>but if I know anything about people</p>
<p>that try to incite violence,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re usually not coming out and clearly saying it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re usually kind of dog-whistling it.</p>
<p>And same with racism and anti-Semitism, all of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually dog whistles.</p>
<p>And they usually have fun playing with the rules,</p>
<p>playing around the rules.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a gray area.</p>
<p>Same with during COVID, misinformation.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s misinformation, right?</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And some of these are age-old problems.</p>
<p>Our legal system, common law,</p>
<p>has been struggling with what is incitement to violence</p>
<p>since the first Supreme Court decisions</p>
<p>in the 18th century, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>But I will say this.</p>
<p>There are certain things</p>
<p>that are clearly incitement to violence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you very clear examples.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just make it personal, right?</p>
<p>My wife is an elected official here in Austin.</p>
<p>There have been people who have put things up on Twitter</p>
<p>calling for her to be hanged</p>
<p>or calling for her to be attacked.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incitement to violence.</p>
<p>When you specifically call for violence against someone,</p>
<p>I agree, there&rsquo;s a lot of other stuff</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a gray area,</p>
<p>but we could start if we&rsquo;re applying these rules</p>
<p>by getting that material off of these sites.</p>
<p>So some of that is a problem of scale too,</p>
<p>but the gray area is still a forever problem</p>
<p>that we may never be able to solve.</p>
<p>And maybe the tension within the gray area</p>
<p>is the very process of democracy.</p>
<p>But saying like, we need to take our country back,</p>
<p>is that incitement to violence?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>I think we need to take our country back, just that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But then, you know-</p>
<p>Because I might say that.</p>
<p>I might say we need to take our-</p>
<p>Yeah, I say that all the time.</p>
<p>Again, I walk around drunk, just screaming at everybody.</p>
<p>I thought you wanted us to take you back.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I was very confused.</p>
<p>My messaging needs to work.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go to the January 6th example, right?</p>
<p>To say, hang Mike Pence, that&rsquo;s incitement to violence.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To say, go get Nancy, that&rsquo;s incitement to violence.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s very clear.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the big problem.</p>
<p>The big problem is the gray area.</p>
<p>But yet, and the other problem</p>
<p>is just how to technically find the large scale</p>
<p>of comments and posts and so on</p>
<p>that are doing this kind of clear incitement to violence.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s something for you to solve.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the AI guy.</p>
<p>I understand, I understand.</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t ask me those questions.</p>
<p>Well, I have to say, some of that is motivation,</p>
<p>some of that is vision, and some of that is execution.</p>
<p>So for example, just to go out briefly on a dark topic,</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;ve recently became aware of is,</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter and so on,</p>
<p>people post violence on there,</p>
<p>like videos of violence, child porn,</p>
<p>some of the darkest things in this world.</p>
<p>And to find them at scale is a difficult problem.</p>
<p>And to act on it aggressively is a difficult problem.</p>
<p>But I think part of this motivation,</p>
<p>like saying this is a big problem,</p>
<p>we need to take this on,</p>
<p>we need to find all the darkest aspects of human nature</p>
<p>that rise and appear on our platform and remove them</p>
<p>so that we can create a place for humanity to flourish</p>
<p>through the process of conversation.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just hard, it&rsquo;s just really hard.</p>
<p>When you look at millions of posts,</p>
<p>trillions of interactions, it&rsquo;s wild,</p>
<p>with the amount of data.</p>
<p>But where we are now with social media</p>
<p>seemed wild and impossible five years ago, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I actually, what frustrates me</p>
<p>is I think there are people who have politicized this issue</p>
<p>in unnecessary ways.</p>
<p>Everyone, regardless of their politics,</p>
<p>should support what you just said.</p>
<p>Investing our money, maybe grants from the federal government</p>
<p>in AI-skilled people like you</p>
<p>figuring out ways to get violent videos off of there.</p>
<p>That shouldn&rsquo;t be political.</p>
<p>Well, some of that also requires being transparent</p>
<p>from a social media company perspective</p>
<p>and transparent in a way that really resists being political.</p>
<p>To be able to be transparent</p>
<p>about your fight against these evils</p>
<p>while still not succumbing</p>
<p>to the sort of the political narratives of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p>But you have to do that kind of,</p>
<p>and walk calmly through the fire.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Twitter feels like if you&rsquo;re being political.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a firing squad from every side.</p>
<p>As a leader, you have to kind of walk calmly.</p>
<p>Right, and that is where we need a new generation</p>
<p>of people who will have diverse politics</p>
<p>but will stand up against that, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the lesson from after the Civil War</p>
<p>is where progress is made,</p>
<p>the war doesn&rsquo;t solve problems of hate.</p>
<p>Where progress is made is where you have local leaders</p>
<p>and others who stand up and say,</p>
<p>we can differ, but we&rsquo;re gonna stop calling people</p>
<p>from certain backgrounds monkeys,</p>
<p>which was a common thing to do at that time.</p>
<p>Jews are still called monkeys in certain places, right?</p>
<p>People have to stand up</p>
<p>while still maintaining their political differences.</p>
<p>Several hundred thousand people died.</p>
<p>What made this war such a deadly war?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extraordinary how many people died.</p>
<p>More than half a million.</p>
<p>And this was without a single automatic rifle,</p>
<p>without a single bomb.</p>
<p>It was mostly in hand-to-hand combat,</p>
<p>which is to say that these 600,000 or so people who died,</p>
<p>they died where the person who killed them</p>
<p>was standing within a few feet of them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>Most of the killing that happens in wars today</p>
<p>is actually from a distance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by a drone, it&rsquo;s by a bomb, it&rsquo;s by a rocket,</p>
<p>or by an automatic weapon.</p>
<p>And just to make this even more focused,</p>
<p>to this day, the deadliest day in American history</p>
<p>was during the Civil War.</p>
<p>September, 1862 at Antietam,</p>
<p>more than 22,000 Americans killed one another hand-to-hand.</p>
<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been a day that deadly</p>
<p>in American history since then.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing considering the technological changes.</p>
<p>What was in the mind of those soldiers on each side?</p>
<p>Was there conviction for ideas?</p>
<p>Did they hate the other side?</p>
<p>I think actually they were fighting out of fear.</p>
<p>What we know from reading their letters,</p>
<p>what we know from the accounts,</p>
<p>is that yes, there are ideas that are promoted to them</p>
<p>to get them to the battlefield,</p>
<p>they believe in what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but here it&rsquo;s the same as World War I,</p>
<p>and I think the Civil War and World War I</p>
<p>are very similar as wars.</p>
<p>You are in these horrible conditions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re attacked, and you have the chance</p>
<p>to either kill the other side and live or die.</p>
<p>And you fight to live,</p>
<p>and you fight to save the people next to you.</p>
<p>What is true about war,</p>
<p>what is both good and dangerous about it,</p>
<p>is you form an almost unparalleled bond</p>
<p>with those on your side.</p>
<p>This is the men under arms scenario, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the killing goes,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a civil war, which means</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s brother against brother, quite literally.</p>
<p>And what it teaches us is how human beings</p>
<p>can be put into fighting and will commit enormous damage,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why this happens.</p>
<p>It goes on for four years.</p>
<p>And just the extensive research you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>on this war for this book,</p>
<p>what are some of the worst and some of the best</p>
<p>aspects of human nature that you found?</p>
<p>Like you said, brother against brother,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty powerful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both, right?</p>
<p>So the level of violence that human beings are capable of,</p>
<p>how long they&rsquo;re able to sustain it.</p>
<p>The South should not have,</p>
<p>the Confederacy should not have lasted in this war</p>
<p>as long as it did.</p>
<p>By the end, I mean, they&rsquo;re starving,</p>
<p>and they keep fighting.</p>
<p>So the resilience in war of societies</p>
<p>and the power of hate to move people.</p>
<p>What are the bright sides?</p>
<p>You see in Lincoln and Grant,</p>
<p>who I talk about a lot in the book as well,</p>
<p>Ulysses Grant, you see the ability of empathetic figures</p>
<p>to still rise above this in spite of all the horror.</p>
<p>Lincoln went to visit more soldiers in war</p>
<p>than any president ever has.</p>
<p>Often at personal peril,</p>
<p>because he was close to the lines and he connected.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t propaganda.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t always reporters following him.</p>
<p>He was able to build empathy in this context.</p>
<p>And I think, as I said, war is horrible as it is,</p>
<p>often gives opportunities to certain groups.</p>
<p>So African-Americans, former slaves,</p>
<p>are able to prove themselves as citizens.</p>
<p>Jews did this an enormous number in World War II.</p>
<p>Henry Kissinger, who I wrote about before,</p>
<p>he really only gets recognized as an American.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a German Jewish immigrant.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s seen as an American</p>
<p>because of his service in World War II.</p>
<p>So the bright side of this is that often in the case of war,</p>
<p>on your own side,</p>
<p>you will let go of some of your prejudices.</p>
<p>Ulysses Grant has a total transformation.</p>
<p>He goes into the Civil War, an anti-Semite and a racist.</p>
<p>He comes out with actually very enlightened views</p>
<p>because he sees what Jewish soldiers</p>
<p>and what African-American soldiers did.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Ulysses Grant&rsquo;s story?</p>
<p>What do you learn from him?</p>
<p>Is he a hero or a villain of this war?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a hero, though he&rsquo;s a flawed hero,</p>
<p>as all heroes are.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a man from Ohio and Illinois,</p>
<p>who was really a failed businessman time and again,</p>
<p>and had an ability to command people in war.</p>
<p>Where did this come from?</p>
<p>He was a clear communicator and an empathetic figure.</p>
<p>He tended to drink too much,</p>
<p>but he was the kind of person people wanted to follow.</p>
<p>They trusted him.</p>
<p>And so in battle, that became very important.</p>
<p>And the second thing is he did his homework.</p>
<p>He had a sense of the terrain.</p>
<p>He had a sense of the environment he was operating in,</p>
<p>and he was ruthless in pursuing what he had studied.</p>
<p>So he turns out at battles like Vicksburg and elsewhere</p>
<p>to actually undertake some pretty revolutionary maneuvers.</p>
<p>And then he figures out that the advantage now</p>
<p>is on his side in numbers, and he just pounds Lee,</p>
<p>pounds him to death, similar to what the United States does</p>
<p>at the end of World War II with Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>He comes out of the war, Grant does.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a believer in union.</p>
<p>He wants to protect former slaves and other groups,</p>
<p>and he tries to use the military for that purpose.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s limited.</p>
<p>And then as president, he tries to do that as well.</p>
<p>Right now, we still use many of the laws that were passed</p>
<p>during Grant&rsquo;s presidency to prosecute insurrectionists.</p>
<p>So the 900 or so people who have been prosecuted</p>
<p>for breaking into the Capitol</p>
<p>and attacking police on January 6th, those insurrectionists,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been prosecuted under the 1871</p>
<p>anti-Klu Klux Klan law.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a big accomplishment by Grant,</p>
<p>and we still benefit from it.</p>
<p>The problem is Grant was not a great politician.</p>
<p>Unlike Lincoln, he didn&rsquo;t give good speeches.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t a persuasive figure in a political space.</p>
<p>And so he had trouble building support</p>
<p>for what he was doing, even though he was trying to do</p>
<p>what in the end, I think, were the right things.</p>
<p>What was the role of the KKK at that time?</p>
<p>So the Klu Klux Klan is formed</p>
<p>at the end of the Civil War by Confederate veterans,</p>
<p>first in Tennessee, in Pulaski, Tennessee,</p>
<p>and then it spreads elsewhere.</p>
<p>And there are other groups that are similar,</p>
<p>the Red Shirts and various others.</p>
<p>These are veterans of the Confederate Army who come home</p>
<p>and are committed to continuing the war.</p>
<p>They are gonna use their power at home and their weapons</p>
<p>to intimidate and if necessary, kill people</p>
<p>who challenge their authority.</p>
<p>Not just African-Americans, Jews, Catholics,</p>
<p>various others, they are going to basically protect</p>
<p>the continued rule of the same families</p>
<p>who owned the slaves before in post-slavery Tennessee</p>
<p>and post-slavery South Carolina.</p>
<p>And when we get to voting, they&rsquo;re often the groups</p>
<p>that are preventing people from voting.</p>
<p>The White Sheets and the ritual around that</p>
<p>was all an effort to provide a certain ritualistic</p>
<p>legitimacy and hide identity,</p>
<p>though everyone knew who they were.</p>
<p>Also, that whole brand, that whole practice</p>
<p>was there from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Have you studied the KKK&rsquo;s history a little bit?</p>
<p>I have and there are a number of other historians</p>
<p>who have too, so I&rsquo;ve used their research as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of curious, I have to admit that my knowledge</p>
<p>of it is very kind of caricature knowledge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s interesting stories and threads</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s different competing organizations</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Within the United States.</p>
<p>And I feel like through that lens,</p>
<p>you can tell a story of the United States also</p>
<p>of these different groups.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re often business associations.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of work showing that actually</p>
<p>people joined the KKK for the reasons I just laid out,</p>
<p>but also because it was networking for your business.</p>
<p>You gained legitimacy in the area that you were in.</p>
<p>So these were community groups that were formed</p>
<p>to help white business people.</p>
<p>They helped white sheriffs get elected.</p>
<p>What we have to understand today</p>
<p>is when we&rsquo;re debating policing,</p>
<p>this history matters enormously, right?</p>
<p>I have nothing against police.</p>
<p>My cousin, one of my closest relatives just retired</p>
<p>from 25 years in the New York police department.</p>
<p>Thank God he survived.</p>
<p>I have deep respect.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the best public servants I know.</p>
<p>But what we also have to recognize</p>
<p>as we respect police officers is that for many communities</p>
<p>in our country, they know this history.</p>
<p>And the KKK in the 1870s and in the 1930s,</p>
<p>you look at any KKK organization as I have in my research</p>
<p>and you find the police chiefs, or the KKK members,</p>
<p>the local police officers, local judges,</p>
<p>because it was how you became police chief.</p>
<p>So these groups infiltrated some of the main institutions</p>
<p>in our nation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think they infiltrated.</p>
<p>I think they were part of those institutions.</p>
<p>The deeper question today in the 21st century is one,</p>
<p>how much of that is still there</p>
<p>and how much of the history of that reverberates</p>
<p>through the institutions?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m making the latter point</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not there that much now, but people remember it.</p>
<p>Well, and some people would even say it&rsquo;s not there at all,</p>
<p>that there is not institutional racism or policing.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s the case, then you can also say</p>
<p>that if there is not direct institutional racism there,</p>
<p>what is it?</p>
<p>The echoes of history still have effects.</p>
<p>Of course, and that&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>in that we have to take that seriously.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an excuse for people then saying nasty things</p>
<p>about the police, but it is what we have to recognize.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m Jewish and there are certain elements</p>
<p>of Russian behavior today I see in Ukraine</p>
<p>that reverberate with the history</p>
<p>of how my grandparents dealt with pogroms in Russia, right?</p>
<p>Even though what Putin is doing in Ukraine</p>
<p>might not technically be a pogrom,</p>
<p>that history matters in how I view these issues.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a reality.</p>
<p>Yeah, I went to 7-Eleven recently and what did I eat?</p>
<p>I ate one of their salads.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I love 7-Eleven, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I ate one of the salads and got like terrible food poisoning.</p>
<p>I was suffering for like four days and now I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I love 7-Eleven.</p>
<p>I love going to 7-Eleven late at night in sweatpants</p>
<p>and just I escaped the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening to an audio book.</p>
<p>And now every time I pass that salad,</p>
<p>for the rest of my life, I would have hate for that salad.</p>
<p>So history matters, even if the salad</p>
<p>is no longer have any bad stuff in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the lettuce or something, whatever.</p>
<p>Mostly for humor&rsquo;s sake, but I&rsquo;m also giving</p>
<p>a kind of metaphor that history can have an individual</p>
<p>and a large-scale society effect on human interactions,</p>
<p>both the good and the bad.</p>
<p>If you actually recommend to me offline books on the KKK,</p>
<p>that would be really-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to.</p>
<p>There were a few mentioned in the footnotes of my book here.</p>
<p>And also in part, because I also want to understand</p>
<p>the white nationalism, white supremacists,</p>
<p>Christian supremacists or Christian nationalism,</p>
<p>all of those different subgroups in the United States</p>
<p>and elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit, my mind has been focused</p>
<p>on some of the better aspects of human nature,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s nice to also understand</p>
<p>some of the darker aspects.</p>
<p>Let me ask you sort of a personal question for me.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible, do you think it&rsquo;s useful</p>
<p>to do a podcast conversation with somebody like David Duke</p>
<p>or somebody, this is somebody that everybody knows.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re giving a platform</p>
<p>to somebody that&rsquo;s a hidden member of the KKK</p>
<p>or like a, it&rsquo;s sort of putting a pretty face</p>
<p>on some dark ideas, but everybody knows.</p>
<p>And so now you&rsquo;re just exploring,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sitting across the table,</p>
<p>maybe not in his case,</p>
<p>maybe somebody who&rsquo;s an active KKK member,</p>
<p>sitting across from a person that literally hates me, Lex.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s fascinating to explore that.</p>
<p>I think so long as what you are doing</p>
<p>is not boosting someone, so taking an obscure figure</p>
<p>and making that figure now famous,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s already infamous</p>
<p>and it helps us to understand them.</p>
<p>And so long as your effort is to ask them tough questions,</p>
<p>which you do, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t give them all the questions in advance,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have limitations on what you can ask.</p>
<p>So long as it is a real interview, not pablum,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m for it.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m against is a softball interview</p>
<p>that allows someone to sound reasonable when they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>But the way I&rsquo;ve seen you do this,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve had figures like that,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t name who I have in mind,</p>
<p>but when I&rsquo;ve seen that is, I think that&rsquo;s useful</p>
<p>because honestly, the historian in me</p>
<p>and the citizen in me wants to understand.</p>
<p>My Jewish grandfather always was the first</p>
<p>to be against any effort to suppress anti-Semites</p>
<p>because his view was he wanted to know who they were</p>
<p>and he wanted to know what they thought</p>
<p>so he could be prepared.</p>
<p>And I also see, perhaps as a historian,</p>
<p>you may be able to appreciate this kind of thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably how you see the world,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s several ways to see a human being.</p>
<p>Like Vladimir Putin is an example.</p>
<p>One is a political figure that&rsquo;s currently doing actions</p>
<p>on the world, geopolitics internally,</p>
<p>the politics of Russia.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also that human being in a historical context.</p>
<p>And collecting information about that person</p>
<p>in the historical context is also very valuable.</p>
<p>So you could see interviews with Hitler in 39, 40, 41</p>
<p>as being very bad and detrimental</p>
<p>to all that is good in the world.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>that human mind, how power affects that mind,</p>
<p>how power corrupts it, how they see the world.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>I would be all in favor, and maybe he will,</p>
<p>if Vladimir Putin would sit down with you, absolutely.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re boosting someone like that</p>
<p>when you ask them tough questions.</p>
<p>In fact, I think that&rsquo;s what we need to do.</p>
<p>Those sorts of figures tend to insulate themselves</p>
<p>from tough questions.</p>
<p>So just to restate, I am for the Lex Fridman interview</p>
<p>of those sorts of figures.</p>
<p>I am not for the puff piece on Fox and Friends</p>
<p>where they just come on and they&rsquo;re asked,</p>
<p>oh, isn&rsquo;t it, tell us what you think of this.</p>
<p>Tell us what you think of that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a balance there because a lot of people</p>
<p>that interview somebody like Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>all they do is hard-hitting questions.</p>
<p>They often demonstrate a lack of knowledge</p>
<p>of the perspective of the Russian people and the president.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not an empathy to understanding</p>
<p>that this is a popularly elected,</p>
<p>you can criticize that notion,</p>
<p>but this is still a theater that represents</p>
<p>the beliefs of a large number of people.</p>
<p>And they have their own life story.</p>
<p>They see the world.</p>
<p>They believe they&rsquo;re doing good for the world.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, that idea seems to not permeate</p>
<p>the questions and the thoughts that people say</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re afraid of being attacked</p>
<p>by the people back home, fellow journalists,</p>
<p>for not being hard enough.</p>
<p>Well, maybe.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>I think in my experience with interviewers</p>
<p>is that a lot of them are really lazy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, which is why I like talking to you.</p>
<p>Can I just say, okay, this is not you saying it.</p>
<p>Can I just rant?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sitting across from Xi Jinping</p>
<p>or from Vladimir Putin, you should be fired</p>
<p>if you have not read at least several books on the guy.</p>
<p>The surprising lack of research that people do</p>
<p>leading up to it.</p>
<p>So you need to be a historian or a biographer.</p>
<p>You need to be the kind of person</p>
<p>that writes biographies or histories</p>
<p>before you sit in front of the person.</p>
<p>Not a low effort journalist.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so surprising to me</p>
<p>that I think they&rsquo;re probably really busy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably not part of the culture</p>
<p>of the people that do interviews</p>
<p>to do deep, deep investigative.</p>
<p>You need to be the kind of person that lives that idea.</p>
<p>Like see it as a documentary</p>
<p>that you work on for three years kind of thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, of course, some journalists do do that</p>
<p>and they do that masterfully</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the best of journalism.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of the times when the questions are,</p>
<p>as you said, out of touch with the society</p>
<p>that person is leading,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because the interviewer hasn&rsquo;t taken the time.</p>
<p>And I understand you can&rsquo;t be an expert on every subject,</p>
<p>but you can do what you do, right?</p>
<p>You read my book to prepare for this.</p>
<p>You look things up.</p>
<p>You had a sense of the person you&rsquo;re talking to</p>
<p>and you put the time in to do that.</p>
<p>This is what I always tell my students, right?</p>
<p>The secret to success in anything</p>
<p>is outworking other people.</p>
<p>Be more prepared, right?</p>
<p>What you show is like an iceberg.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the tip of the iceberg, right?</p>
<p>Is what people see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the work that goes on below the surface.</p>
<p>And if you work hard enough, which I aspire to do,</p>
<p>at the end of the day, just like an animal farm,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be like the horse boxer</p>
<p>and slaughtered unjustly</p>
<p>by those that are much more powerful than you.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll be happy when you&rsquo;re slaughtered.</p>
<p>You have lived for the right ideal</p>
<p>and history will remember you fondly.</p>
<p>Okay, what about Robert E. Lee?</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s the confederate general that you mentioned.</p>
<p>Was he a hero or villain?</p>
<p>To me, he&rsquo;s a villain.</p>
<p>Many people treat Robert E. Lee as a hero.</p>
<p>And one of the points I make in the book</p>
<p>is we have to rethink that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very important for our society</p>
<p>because Robert E. Lee pops up all over our society,</p>
<p>names of schools, names of streets.</p>
<p>And he also embeds and justifies certain behaviors</p>
<p>that I think are really bad.</p>
<p>Lee was a tremendous general.</p>
<p>He had the weaker side</p>
<p>and he managed to use maneuver, secrecy, and circumstance</p>
<p>to give himself so many advantages</p>
<p>and win so many battles he should have lost.</p>
<p>So in terms of the technical generalship,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a great general.</p>
<p>But Lee at the end of the war</p>
<p>never wants to really acknowledge defeat.</p>
<p>What he acknowledges at Appomattox</p>
<p>is that his soldiers will have to leave the battlefield</p>
<p>because they have not won on the battlefield.</p>
<p>But he refuses to do what Grant asks him,</p>
<p>which is to help sell his side</p>
<p>on the fact that we&rsquo;re going into a post-war moment</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t have to see themselves as losers,</p>
<p>but they have to get on board with change.</p>
<p>Real leadership is convincing people who follow you</p>
<p>that they have to change when they don&rsquo;t wanna change.</p>
<p>Lee refuses to do that.</p>
<p>He says to Grant, I quote this in the book,</p>
<p>he says to Grant at Appomattox,</p>
<p>if you wanna change the South,</p>
<p>you have to run your army over the South three or four times.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not gonna do anything.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not gonna help.</p>
<p>And he becomes a figure who people rally around</p>
<p>in the rest of his life and even after he dies.</p>
<p>So it is as if at the end of World War II,</p>
<p>Hitler had been allowed to just retire</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t go back into politics,</p>
<p>but yet he was there</p>
<p>and he continued to have meetings with former Nazis</p>
<p>and people would rally around the idea of bringing back</p>
<p>or going back to Hitler&rsquo;s ideas.</p>
<p>Think of how harmful that would be.</p>
<p>Lee played that kind of role after the war.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s one of the problems we have now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should continue to revere him</p>
<p>because it justifies too much</p>
<p>of what the Confederates stood for.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the difference that you highlight</p>
<p>between World War II and the Civil War,</p>
<p>that in the case of Hitler,</p>
<p>there was an end to that war.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very distinctive, clear end to that war.</p>
<p>And you also make the case that World War II</p>
<p>is not a good example,</p>
<p>not a good model of a war to help us analyze history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s given Americans the wrong idea of what war is</p>
<p>because World War II ends as most wars don&rsquo;t end.</p>
<p>World War II ends with the complete defeat</p>
<p>of the German army and the German society</p>
<p>and the near complete defeat of Japan.</p>
<p>And where both sides, in different ways, accept defeat.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m pointing out in the book</p>
<p>is that most wars don&rsquo;t end with one side accepting defeat.</p>
<p>And generally the war continues after the battles end.</p>
<p>This is something that&rsquo;s hard for Americans to understand.</p>
<p>Our system is built with the presumption</p>
<p>when war is over, when we sign a piece of paper,</p>
<p>everyone can go home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what happens.</p>
<p>I mean, Civil War is a special case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s especially a strong case of that</p>
<p>because the people that fought the war</p>
<p>are still living in that land.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>And in this case, some of them are leaders also.</p>
<p>Many of them become the leaders of the very areas</p>
<p>that they were leading before.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s another lesson here too,</p>
<p>that we did undertake after World War II,</p>
<p>though in a flawed way.</p>
<p>We had a Nuremberg system.</p>
<p>We did prohibit at least Nazi leaders</p>
<p>from coming back into power.</p>
<p>We made an exception for the emperor in Japan,</p>
<p>but we generally followed the same rule in Japan.</p>
<p>Whereas in the United States, as I point out,</p>
<p>many of the leaders of the Confederacy</p>
<p>first of all, don&rsquo;t surrender.</p>
<p>They flee to Mexico.</p>
<p>Then they come back after they lose in Mexico a second time,</p>
<p>they come back to the United States</p>
<p>and they get elected to office.</p>
<p>The guy who writes the election laws in Texas,</p>
<p>Alexander Watkins Terrell,</p>
<p>most people don&rsquo;t know this even in Texas.</p>
<p>He was a Confederate general, fled to Mexico.</p>
<p>So he committed treason by joining the army of Maximilian,</p>
<p>emperor of Mexico who was put in power by Louis Napoleon.</p>
<p>After Maximilian&rsquo;s defeated,</p>
<p>Alexander Watkins Terrell comes back to Texas,</p>
<p>runs for the state legislature</p>
<p>and then writes the election laws.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Can you make the case for that,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a feature of the American system, not a bug,</p>
<p>that that is an implementation of justice,</p>
<p>that you forgive, that you don&rsquo;t persecute everybody</p>
<p>on the other side of the war?</p>
<p>Maybe, and I think that&rsquo;s a good feature</p>
<p>in terms of lower level individuals.</p>
<p>But I think a bad feature of our system</p>
<p>is we do allow elite figures who have committed wrongdoing.</p>
<p>We give them many ways to get out of punishment.</p>
<p>You are more likely to be punished in this society</p>
<p>if you do something wrong and you&rsquo;re not an elite figure</p>
<p>than if you are an elite figure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There should be a proportional,</p>
<p>like forgiveness should be equally distributed across.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>But we could change that.</p>
<p>We could fix that.</p>
<p>How do we fix that?</p>
<p>How do we fix that?</p>
<p>What I think was argued at the end,</p>
<p>this is one of the really important things</p>
<p>about studying history.</p>
<p>You learn about ideas that were not pursued</p>
<p>that could be pursued today.</p>
<p>At the end of the Civil War,</p>
<p>there was an effort to ban anyone</p>
<p>who was in a leadership position in the Confederacy</p>
<p>from ever serving in federal office again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the third element of the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>The 14th Amendment clause three</p>
<p>says that if you took an oath of office,</p>
<p>meaning you were elected to office,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an elite figure,</p>
<p>and you violated that oath,</p>
<p>you can still live in the country.</p>
<p>You can still get rich,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t run for elected office again.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve never really implemented that.</p>
<p>Is it obvious that everybody</p>
<p>who was in a leadership position on the Confederate side</p>
<p>is a bad person for the future of the United States?</p>
<p>Or is that just a safe thing to assume</p>
<p>for the future of the nation?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the latter.</p>
<p>People do things for all kinds of reasons,</p>
<p>and sometimes they have regrets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also why we have the pardoning capability.</p>
<p>You could pardon someone individually</p>
<p>if they show you that they&rsquo;ve changed.</p>
<p>And it would only create fairness,</p>
<p>because right now, let&rsquo;s say, Lex,</p>
<p>you take out a huge, huge loan,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t pay your loan back,</p>
<p>that will go on your credit,</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t get a big loan again.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to say, just give me another chance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to prove.</p>
<p>I think about holding public office in the same way.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve violated your credit rating on that,</p>
<p>you should have a much higher road to go</p>
<p>to prove to us that you should be back in office.</p>
<p>How did the war end, in quotes?</p>
<p>What was the, so you said,</p>
<p>and you make this case in the book,</p>
<p>that in some sense, the elements,</p>
<p>the tensions behind the Civil War continue to this day.</p>
<p>But officially, how did the war end?</p>
<p>So officially, the war ends at Appomattox</p>
<p>in the early spring of 1865,</p>
<p>when Grant has pretty much smashed Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s army.</p>
<p>Appomattox Courthouse is a small town in Virginia,</p>
<p>and the two men meet,</p>
<p>and there are portraits of this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a painting of it we have in the book.</p>
<p>And Grant and Lee sign a paper</p>
<p>which basically allows Lee&rsquo;s soldiers</p>
<p>to leave the battlefield,</p>
<p>and leave with their sidearms to go back home.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much the end.</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis, who&rsquo;s the president of the Confederacy,</p>
<p>goes into hiding.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s later captured, and then not convicted.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no formal settlement</p>
<p>in the way there is at the end of World War II,</p>
<p>where they meet in Yokohama Bay,</p>
<p>the U.S. and Japanese leaders in China.</p>
<p>This is not that.</p>
<p>So what stands out to you as brilliant ideas</p>
<p>during this time, and actions, too, of Lincoln,</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln?</p>
<p>So I mentioned his values.</p>
<p>I think a number of the things that he does</p>
<p>that are quite extraordinary.</p>
<p>First, in emancipating the slaves.</p>
<p>Now, the slaves were freeing themselves.</p>
<p>But Lincoln recognizes that he needs more labor</p>
<p>in the Union Army.</p>
<p>And he recognizes that there&rsquo;s still a lot of resistance.</p>
<p>And what he does is he makes the case</p>
<p>for freeing the slaves based on the argument,</p>
<p>not just of the moral value of that,</p>
<p>but based on how that will benefit the North.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s able to convince non-abolitionists</p>
<p>to pursue abolitionist policies</p>
<p>by serving their own interests.</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s basically saying by 1863 or 64 is,</p>
<p>I can ask for more white soldiers,</p>
<p>or I can bring in former slaves.</p>
<p>Would you like me to take your son,</p>
<p>or would you like me to put in?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing Franklin Roosevelt does</p>
<p>during World War II.</p>
<p>He says, we need to build more planes and more tanks.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sending all the soldiers off to Europe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got all this African American population in the South.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you like me to move them up to Chicago</p>
<p>so we can win this war and build things in the factories?</p>
<p>So Lincoln uses the war to move the country forward morally,</p>
<p>even if at times he&rsquo;s convincing people</p>
<p>by using other reasons.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s great politics.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s one of the components of great leadership</p>
<p>is do the right thing for the wrong reasons,</p>
<p>publicly sounding wrong reasons, yeah.</p>
<p>Find ways to move people.</p>
<p>What we talked about before,</p>
<p>different stories move different people.</p>
<p>So you can tell different stories.</p>
<p>He tells one set of stories to the religious leaders</p>
<p>who are abolitionists,</p>
<p>and a different set of stories to the New York bankers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
<p>You tell different kinds of stories</p>
<p>to move people to a new position.</p>
<p>The other thing Lincoln is really brilliant at</p>
<p>is managing the international side of this.</p>
<p>So one of the real dangers for the Union</p>
<p>is that the British will come in</p>
<p>on the side of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>The Confederates expected the British would,</p>
<p>because again, the Confederates were selling</p>
<p>all their cotton to Britain.</p>
<p>And they knew that the British leadership, first of all,</p>
<p>was very happy to work with slave holding societies,</p>
<p>even though they didn&rsquo;t have slaves.</p>
<p>And number two, that they believed the Union</p>
<p>was getting too strong</p>
<p>and threatening the British in Canada.</p>
<p>So there were many reasons the British</p>
<p>might have gone in with the Confederates.</p>
<p>Lincoln mixes sticks and carrots with the British.</p>
<p>He threatens them.</p>
<p>And when the British actually try to send diplomats</p>
<p>to negotiate with Southerners, he interdicts that.</p>
<p>He basically initiates a quarantine of the South.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he reaches out to them</p>
<p>and tries to show that he wants better relations</p>
<p>and makes the argument that they will actually benefit more</p>
<p>from having the industrial capability</p>
<p>of the Union on their side.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a very good diplomat.</p>
<p>He is considered to be one of the great presidents</p>
<p>in the history of the United States.</p>
<p>Are there ways that he failed?</p>
<p>Is there things he could have done better?</p>
<p>So he failed in the ways that most great leaders fail,</p>
<p>which is that he had a terrible succession plan.</p>
<p>His vice president, who I spend a lot of time on</p>
<p>in the book, Andrew Johnson,</p>
<p>who was probably our worst president ever.</p>
<p>Andrew Johnson had no business being anywhere</p>
<p>near the presidency.</p>
<p>Andrew Johnson was the only Southern senator</p>
<p>who did not secede.</p>
<p>And so even though he was a Democrat,</p>
<p>Lincoln wanted to show that he was creating a unity ticket</p>
<p>when he ran for reelection in 1864.</p>
<p>This happens today, right?</p>
<p>So he put someone on as vice president</p>
<p>who he didn&rsquo;t even like,</p>
<p>but who we thought was politically useful.</p>
<p>Problem is, when Lincoln was assassinated,</p>
<p>this guy took over.</p>
<p>Andrew Johnson was drunk at his own inauguration.</p>
<p>The guy was a true drunkard.</p>
<p>He was not prepared to lead in any sense,</p>
<p>intellectually, politically,</p>
<p>and he was against most of the principles Lincoln was for.</p>
<p>And the irony is that when Lincoln is assassinated</p>
<p>in April of 1865, Andrew Johnson takes over</p>
<p>and he has all the war powers Lincoln had.</p>
<p>That was not good planning by Lincoln.</p>
<p>And we can look back on it now and say,</p>
<p>even though Lincoln is the first president</p>
<p>who was assassinated,</p>
<p>he should have known that there were people coming for him.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t inevitable that he&rsquo;d be assassinated,</p>
<p>but he should have had a backup plan</p>
<p>for who would take over,</p>
<p>hopefully someone who was capable of doing the job,</p>
<p>and Andrew Johnson was not capable.</p>
<p>So for me, for a person,</p>
<p>if I were to put myself in Lincoln&rsquo;s shoes</p>
<p>or anybody, any leadership position&rsquo;s shoes,</p>
<p>it is difficult to think about what happens after my death,</p>
<p>after I&rsquo;m gone, right, to plan well.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>if you care about your actions to have a long-term impact,</p>
<p>it seems like you should have a succession plan</p>
<p>that continues on the path,</p>
<p>that continues to carry the ideals that you&rsquo;ve implemented.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m unsure why people don&rsquo;t do that more often.</p>
<p>Like, I wonder how much Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>spends percentage of time per day</p>
<p>thinking what happens after he&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>to help flourish the nation and the region</p>
<p>that he deeply cares for.</p>
<p>I wonder, and it&rsquo;s the same as for other presidents,</p>
<p>Donald Trump, Joe Biden,</p>
<p>they might think politically,</p>
<p>like, how do I guarantee that it&rsquo;s a Democrat or a Republican</p>
<p>but do they think like visionary for the country?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I wonder.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very rare.</p>
<p>And I think what I understand from the literature</p>
<p>among business people who talk about this a lot</p>
<p>is what ends up happening is you become so powerful,</p>
<p>you assume you&rsquo;re always gonna be in power.</p>
<p>You convince yourself of that.</p>
<p>You convince yourself that the end is far away.</p>
<p>And of course, for Lincoln,</p>
<p>the end could have been far away.</p>
<p>He was healthy, he was only in his 50s,</p>
<p>he could have lived a lot longer,</p>
<p>but it also, it ended fast as it could.</p>
<p>And my understanding is that most Americans</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t prepare their wills and estates,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they&rsquo;re rich or poor.</p>
<p>They assume things are just gonna go on</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not fun to think about this.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I feel like it&rsquo;s freeing.</p>
<p>Like, you know what I did, which is interesting?</p>
<p>Before I went to Ukraine, I recorded a video.</p>
<p>I set up a whole thing where I record a video,</p>
<p>like, what happens if I die?</p>
<p>I record a video to release,</p>
<p>and I gave my brother access to my passwords,</p>
<p>so that, and I gave him instructions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to look at this,</p>
<p>but please publish this if I die.</p>
<p>And you know, that made me,</p>
<p>it sounds silly and ridiculous,</p>
<p>but that made me feel free to do the best thing I wanna do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s liberating.</p>
<p>So like, I guess that&rsquo;s for your will,</p>
<p>but also, like, do the best possible damn job you can.</p>
<p>I feel like as a leader, having a plan,</p>
<p>what happens if you fail, and not if you fail,</p>
<p>if you die, if you, or you lose some of the oomph,</p>
<p>some of the power, some of the momentum</p>
<p>that is driving you currently,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s going to be a handoff,</p>
<p>where you will still, and you will still be remembered</p>
<p>as a great man or woman that-</p>
<p>But you identify one of the other problems, right?</p>
<p>Which is one of the other reasons why someone like Lincoln,</p>
<p>or certainly Henry Kissinger, doesn&rsquo;t create a successor.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re afraid they&rsquo;re going to steal your passwords.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re afraid they&rsquo;re gonna steal the power from you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You had to find someone, your brother,</p>
<p>hopefully, who you could trust.</p>
<p>No, no, no, let&rsquo;s just be clear.</p>
<p>I love my brother, but he&rsquo;s a troll.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a feature on the password,</p>
<p>on whatever password manager I may or may not use.</p>
<p>And this is, there&rsquo;s a bunch of services like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, I don&rsquo;t know if you know about this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned about all of this.</p>
<p>Is you can have them request access,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna wait 30 days before it gives them access.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of, has this built-in trust, okay?</p>
<p>Trust padding.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, on that aspect,</p>
<p>is just to have a plan in all aspects of life.</p>
<p>This is for leadership in your private life.</p>
<p>Like, what happens to not just your will</p>
<p>and your wealth or whatever,</p>
<p>but what happens to other stuff,</p>
<p>like social media and all of that,</p>
<p>in this digital world?</p>
<p>And anything you care about, if you want it to live on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>But if you, unless you can devise</p>
<p>a technical solution like that,</p>
<p>you have to give someone power now.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s the tricky thing.</p>
<p>I mean, democracy is a kind of technology.</p>
<p>You kind of have to figure out how to do it correctly,</p>
<p>how to have that power propagate.</p>
<p>And especially during war,</p>
<p>how you get everybody together</p>
<p>into this warmongering mood,</p>
<p>and then how do you come down from that and just relax?</p>
<p>Precisely.</p>
<p>So in some sense, that&rsquo;s, with Andrew Johnson,</p>
<p>the problem is the over-centralization of power.</p>
<p>It was the over-centralization of power,</p>
<p>but it was also that Lincoln had a designated successor</p>
<p>who was going to do and tried to do everything</p>
<p>that ran against what Lincoln was doing.</p>
<p>And it set the country back.</p>
<p>We went forward at the end of the Civil War,</p>
<p>and then we went backward.</p>
<p>More so than we would have if there had been a new election.</p>
<p>Because if there had been a new election,</p>
<p>there still would be reason for that person running,</p>
<p>even if they were on the other side,</p>
<p>to try to find some compromise positions.</p>
<p>Andrew Johnson inherited power</p>
<p>with very few limitations on how he used that power.</p>
<p>Congress wasn&rsquo;t even in session.</p>
<p>And so this became very directly a problem</p>
<p>because Andrew Johnson started pardoning Southerners,</p>
<p>allowing them to come back into power.</p>
<p>So he had like a few months where he just went wild.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s giving the car keys</p>
<p>to someone who&rsquo;s not prepared to drive,</p>
<p>but decided that they&rsquo;re gonna do what they want</p>
<p>with the car for a while.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Is there any level to which power corrupted Lincoln,</p>
<p>a war president?</p>
<p>Yes, I do think there were some areas.</p>
<p>And I think that even though he was a great president,</p>
<p>if not our greatest president,</p>
<p>maybe one of the greatest figures of our history,</p>
<p>he was flawed.</p>
<p>One is his problem with succession,</p>
<p>but also I think Lincoln over-invested</p>
<p>in the power of the presidency.</p>
<p>He came to believe too much in the role of one man.</p>
<p>And not in creating a more balanced approach to governance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a function of war.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where war is dangerous.</p>
<p>War has an inherent centralizing power in a democracy.</p>
<p>That is dangerous.</p>
<p>Because even when you have the best of people running a war,</p>
<p>that gives them a lot of power to make decisions.</p>
<p>Yeah, how do you come down from that?</p>
<p>I see that was Zelensky and Putin currently.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a war.</p>
<p>How do you come down?</p>
<p>Because Ukraine and everybody,</p>
<p>anybody in a war kind of,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re fighting for the ideal of democracy,</p>
<p>it seems like war is anti-democratic.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>So how do you come down from that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the interesting mechanism of,</p>
<p>I mean, some of it is leadership.</p>
<p>You have to be like a George Washington type figure</p>
<p>to be able to walk away from power.</p>
<p>I think you gave the answer right there.</p>
<p>You need to walk away from power</p>
<p>or you need to be forced to walk away from power.</p>
<p>Historically, one of the things that democracies</p>
<p>have tended to do when they have a chance</p>
<p>is to vote out of office the victor in the war.</p>
<p>Think about Winston Churchill.</p>
<p>Roosevelt is elected to his fourth term</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s still in the war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear that he would have been elected again,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say he lived on,</p>
<p>because there is a sensibility</p>
<p>that the person has become too powerful in this role</p>
<p>and that someone else should now step in,</p>
<p>someone else who&rsquo;s also not a war president</p>
<p>but has other interests.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s hope Ukraine wins this war.</p>
<p>Zelensky should then step down</p>
<p>or someone else should be voted in.</p>
<p>It will be dangerous if he remains president.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say he wins somehow and a true victory,</p>
<p>just as a hypothetical.</p>
<p>He should not be, he should be praised,</p>
<p>maybe given a nice villa,</p>
<p>but someone else should take over</p>
<p>because the problem is that he&rsquo;s gonna have too much power</p>
<p>and honestly, he&rsquo;s going to be too out of touch</p>
<p>with what the country needs after the war.</p>
<p>What do you think would have happened if Lincoln had lived?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sort of counterfactual view of history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question</p>
<p>that probably you think about a lot,</p>
<p>this gets raised a lot.</p>
<p>What would have happened if he didn&rsquo;t get assassinated?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reasonable question</p>
<p>because it was not inevitable he&rsquo;d be assassinated.</p>
<p>He could have had more protection that night.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d invited Ulysses Grant to go to the theater with him</p>
<p>and Grant and his wife didn&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>If they had been there,</p>
<p>there would have been more protection for Grant.</p>
<p>So he would have had at least double the security there.</p>
<p>So there are many ways in which he might not have died.</p>
<p>I think it still would have been a difficult transition,</p>
<p>but I think there were a few things</p>
<p>that would have been better.</p>
<p>First of all, Lincoln would not have pardoned</p>
<p>all of these Confederate leaders</p>
<p>and allowed them to come back into power.</p>
<p>Lincoln also would have been a better politician</p>
<p>at holding his Republican coalition together.</p>
<p>And I think Lincoln was more committed</p>
<p>to empowering former slaves and others.</p>
<p>So we still would have had a lot of conflicts,</p>
<p>but I think what would have been a degree of difficulty</p>
<p>was doubled or tripled</p>
<p>because Lincoln was removed</p>
<p>and the opposite came into power with Andrew Johnson.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a case you made</p>
<p>that Andrew Johnson turned out to be a bad decision,</p>
<p>but the spirit of the decision is the correct one?</p>
<p>No, I think it was a terrible decision</p>
<p>because you should never put someone one step away</p>
<p>from enormous power who&rsquo;s not prepared.</p>
<p>Oh, in that sense.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in that sense, I got it.</p>
<p>But the spirit of the decision,</p>
<p>meaning you put somebody who represents</p>
<p>a very opposing viewpoint than you.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m for that so long as that person</p>
<p>is on board with some of the basic values</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re pursuing,</p>
<p>and that person is capable of doing the job.</p>
<p>Well, do you think that was obvious to him</p>
<p>that Andrew Johnson was not capable of doing the job?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the, I mean, everyone recognized that.</p>
<p>But it made sense.</p>
<p>I mean, what Lincoln has to be praised for</p>
<p>is in the midst of a war,</p>
<p>when at that point he was not doing well,</p>
<p>the war was not going well,</p>
<p>he ran for re-election.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t try to postpone the election.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t try to do anything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so he needed all the help he could get when running.</p>
<p>And so he wanted to have someone on there</p>
<p>who looked like a unity candidate</p>
<p>who could appeal to some Southerners.</p>
<p>So it made sense from a political point of view,</p>
<p>but it created a really big problem.</p>
<p>And there were people who said</p>
<p>he should have removed Johnson as soon as he was elected.</p>
<p>And in retrospect, he probably should have.</p>
<p>How gangster is that to,</p>
<p>during a war, still run the election?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extraordinary.</p>
<p>I mean, Lincoln believed in democratic values.</p>
<p>He also believed he would win,</p>
<p>but he knew it was not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting, for people who don&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>the reason we have mail-in balloting in the US</p>
<p>is because of that.</p>
<p>So almost, what,</p>
<p>I think almost a million union voters</p>
<p>are away from their homes.</p>
<p>And so how do they vote?</p>
<p>As soldiers, as nurses?</p>
<p>They vote by mail.</p>
<p>The post office delivers their ballots.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we have mail-in balloting.</p>
<p>What about the other counterfactual question</p>
<p>of what would have happened</p>
<p>if Confederate States won the war?</p>
<p>The Confederate States had won the war,</p>
<p>you would have seen, I think, a separate country.</p>
<p>In the South, you would have seen two countries.</p>
<p>And that Confederate country</p>
<p>would have been a smaller country,</p>
<p>but it probably would have been able to defend itself</p>
<p>because it would have actually gotten much richer</p>
<p>than it was.</p>
<p>It was poor at the time,</p>
<p>but through its cotton trade and other things,</p>
<p>it would have been recognized by Great Britain,</p>
<p>by France, by other societies.</p>
<p>And you would have seen a Southern Republic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you would have seen</p>
<p>that Southern Republic dominate the continent.</p>
<p>The Union had the men and people and had the resources,</p>
<p>but you would have seen a rival republic</p>
<p>to the United States in the South.</p>
<p>Do you think they had interest to dominate the continent,</p>
<p>to take over the Union?</p>
<p>They had a foreign policy, they had a plan.</p>
<p>Many have written about this.</p>
<p>They had plans, many Southerners did,</p>
<p>of expanding into the Caribbean,</p>
<p>which was actually more feasible.</p>
<p>They did not have the personnel</p>
<p>to occupy so much territory going out West,</p>
<p>if you think about the amount of land</p>
<p>that had to be covered.</p>
<p>But they had the nautical capabilities and naval power</p>
<p>and the money to dominate islands in the Caribbean,</p>
<p>and those islands were important for their trade.</p>
<p>So there were many Southerners</p>
<p>who wanted to take control of Cuba,</p>
<p>wanted to take control of Haiti and the Dominican Republic,</p>
<p>so you probably would have seen</p>
<p>Southern warfare in those areas.</p>
<p>From a counterfactual history perspective,</p>
<p>can you make the case that secession</p>
<p>would have created a better world?</p>
<p>Like if we&rsquo;re sitting today,</p>
<p>and do back to the future thing,</p>
<p>the secession in this context,</p>
<p>if we put aside the suffering and the loss of life</p>
<p>in the war, that we&rsquo;d be in a better world today?</p>
<p>Just looking at the political climate,</p>
<p>and can you also make the case</p>
<p>that actually this outcome of the Union winning the war</p>
<p>is the better one?</p>
<p>I think the Union victory is by far the better outcome,</p>
<p>because I think what you would have had otherwise</p>
<p>is you would have had a slave republic in the South</p>
<p>that would have encouraged slavery</p>
<p>in other parts of the world, would have exported slavery,</p>
<p>and would have necessarily been hostile</p>
<p>to many of the positive changes that occur in the Union,</p>
<p>the movement toward progressive reforms,</p>
<p>creating cities with health codes and public education,</p>
<p>and many of those things.</p>
<p>Public education really develops in the North</p>
<p>as a way of training workers who are being paid</p>
<p>to be better workers in a factory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason you don&rsquo;t educate slaves,</p>
<p>because if you educate slaves, they rebel.</p>
<p>Yeah, so don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;ll be a huge pressure</p>
<p>from the North to abolish slavery anyway?</p>
<p>There would have, but I think the South</p>
<p>could have survived without another war.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the way that slavery</p>
<p>would have ended in the South,</p>
<p>if it didn&rsquo;t end with the Civil War,</p>
<p>it would have been with another war.</p>
<p>I guess the deeper question is,</p>
<p>is it better to work through your problems together,</p>
<p>or is it better to get a divorce?</p>
<p>I think in this case,</p>
<p>it was better to work through the problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even working through them together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better to work through the problems</p>
<p>where one side has the resources to incentivize you</p>
<p>to work through the problems,</p>
<p>rather than leaving you on your own</p>
<p>to go your own direction.</p>
<p>I think the argument against the Union winning</p>
<p>would be the argument that would be made</p>
<p>by those who believe they suffered</p>
<p>from Union power later on.</p>
<p>So you could argue,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a historian of Native Americans,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a historian of the Philippines,</p>
<p>you could argue some of the areas</p>
<p>where this newly united nation coming out of the Civil War</p>
<p>was able to use its power to spread its influence,</p>
<p>it would have been harder for the Union to do that</p>
<p>if the Union had to deal with a rival to the South.</p>
<p>So as a historian, the Union won.</p>
<p>To which degree are the people from the Union</p>
<p>that is now the United States,</p>
<p>the writers of the history,</p>
<p>that color the perspective</p>
<p>of who&rsquo;s the good guys and the bad guys?</p>
<p>So this is such an interesting question because-</p>
<p>I like how you take every question I ask</p>
<p>and make it into a better question.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a deep, I deeply appreciate it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask, every time I ask some ridiculous question,</p>
<p>and you go, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re really good questions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re thoughtful questions.</p>
<p>Actually, the best questions are not the simple ones.</p>
<p>The axiom is that the winners write history.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s usually the case.</p>
<p>Most of the history I learned about Ukraine</p>
<p>when I was growing up was written by Russians.</p>
<p>It was Russian history of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Most of the history of Europe has been written</p>
<p>by Germans and French and British citizens.</p>
<p>So usually it&rsquo;s that way.</p>
<p>And for the most part,</p>
<p>our history has been written</p>
<p>from a sort of Northeastern point of view.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very interesting,</p>
<p>the history of the years after the Civil War</p>
<p>that I focus on in this book</p>
<p>has largely been written by the losers.</p>
<p>Because the Union and its legacies,</p>
<p>and I grew up in New York,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m growing up as a legacy of that, right?</p>
<p>Those were individuals who wanted to write</p>
<p>about what happened long after the Civil War,</p>
<p>when the North got rich.</p>
<p>All those beautiful buildings in New York,</p>
<p>all that wealth in New York, it&rsquo;s 1880s, 90s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the late 19th century, it&rsquo;s the Gilded Age.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Northerners wanna write about, right?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s glory there.</p>
<p>The 20 years or so after the Civil War,</p>
<p>the years that really count, 1865 to 1880 or so,</p>
<p>those years are ugly, it&rsquo;s messy.</p>
<p>And so who wrote about them?</p>
<p>Southerners wrote about them.</p>
<p>And they wrote a story that was about</p>
<p>Northern carpetbaggers and corrupt African-Americans.</p>
<p>And this is the story that Americans learned</p>
<p>until a few years ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone around the country talking about this book,</p>
<p>and the number of people have told me</p>
<p>they never learned this basic history</p>
<p>because they grew up in Chicago,</p>
<p>not because they grew up in Texas,</p>
<p>because they grew up in Chicago.</p>
<p>And the story they were told, the Civil War ended,</p>
<p>oh, now let&rsquo;s talk about the Chicago World&rsquo;s Fair in 1893</p>
<p>and how Chicago is coming of age as this great city.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t like to write history in our country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not about glory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for the greatness of our country,</p>
<p>but you become great by studying your failures</p>
<p>as well as your successes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a real problem we have.</p>
<p>And I would love to see a kind of humility</p>
<p>from a history perspective.</p>
<p>One of the things that always surprised me</p>
<p>just coming from the Soviet Union to the United States,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve, I think, spoken about,</p>
<p>is the perspective on World War II</p>
<p>and who was the critical component of winning the war.</p>
<p>Obviously, in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great patriotic war.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union are the ones that suffered</p>
<p>and often actually don&rsquo;t emphasize the suffering.</p>
<p>They emphasize the glory</p>
<p>that they defeated this huge evil.</p>
<p>But then you listen to the United States&rsquo; perspective</p>
<p>on this, and it&rsquo;s almost like the,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s several ways of phrasing it,</p>
<p>but basically, the United States won the war.</p>
<p>Without the United States,</p>
<p>it would be impossible to win the war.</p>
<p>They were the turning point.</p>
<p>They were my last, my everything, that song.</p>
<p>My first, my last, my everything.</p>
<p>So that, and I&rsquo;m sure, I wonder what growing up</p>
<p>in maybe after war in Britain,</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s history books written there</p>
<p>that basically say,</p>
<p>and they could also make a pretty strong case,</p>
<p>that Britain was central to the turning point.</p>
<p>You could really make a strong case</p>
<p>that Churchill and Britain</p>
<p>were the turning point of the war,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re responsible for some of the first failures,</p>
<p>major failures of Hitler</p>
<p>from a military strategy perspective.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s interesting to look at that very recent history</p>
<p>from very different perspectives.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same problem with the Civil War.</p>
<p>We wanna tell the story of the Union winning the war,</p>
<p>and then everything is good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the way it worked.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m really trying to get at</p>
<p>is when you love your country,</p>
<p>you have to study the failures.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because by studying the failures,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you improve yourself,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where you see where real courage is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually that Lincoln failed for so long</p>
<p>that makes him a great president.</p>
<p>He lost more battles than he won, but he learned,</p>
<p>and he got it right in the end.</p>
<p>Same with Ulysses Grant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want generals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just echoing Lincoln here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want generals.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want leaders who think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna get it right the first time,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re never gonna get it right the first time.</p>
<p>You never get it right the first time</p>
<p>in an AI experiment, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s those who can work through failure learn from failure.</p>
<p>And we as a society have to start doing that better.</p>
<p>We have to not just trumpet the successes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about where we failed as Republicans,</p>
<p>as Democrats, as independents,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s move forward from there.</p>
<p>In recent years have been a kind of movement</p>
<p>of highlighting some of the hypocrisy,</p>
<p>sort of highlighting the racism,</p>
<p>the fact that many of the founding fathers</p>
<p>were slave owners, that kind of thing,</p>
<p>sort of highlighting from the current ethics of our world,</p>
<p>showing that many of the people involved</p>
<p>in the war on each side were evil.</p>
<p>What do you think about that perspective on history?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s super valuable.</p>
<p>I think we should expose the gap</p>
<p>between ideals and practice,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should throw away</p>
<p>the great people who are also hypocrites,</p>
<p>because everyone I&rsquo;ve studied is a hypocrite.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a hypocrite.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m a pretty good father.</p>
<p>Luckily, my son is an even better mother,</p>
<p>but there are parts of me that, I mean,</p>
<p>I often find myself telling our children</p>
<p>to do things that I didn&rsquo;t do, right?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re smart and they recognize that</p>
<p>and they learn something from that.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s not cover over the hypocrisy,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s not throw people away for being hypocritical.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my view of Thomas Jefferson,</p>
<p>which is similar to my view of Abraham Lincoln, right?</p>
<p>These are incredibly insightful, thoughtful people</p>
<p>who added so much to our country,</p>
<p>but they also created flawed systems.</p>
<p>And one of, excuse me, Jefferson&rsquo;s flaws</p>
<p>was even though he saw all the evils of slavery,</p>
<p>he was a terrible farmer and he could not imagine</p>
<p>living the lifestyle he lived without slaves.</p>
<p>He could never work his way out of that,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t make the Declaration of Independence</p>
<p>less valuable.</p>
<p>In fact, it makes it more valuable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more that we can learn from that.</p>
<p>And to me, on the hypocrisy side,</p>
<p>many of the people that participate in cancel culture</p>
<p>and these kinds of movements</p>
<p>that call everything as racist and so on,</p>
<p>sometimes they&rsquo;re highlighting properly</p>
<p>the evils in our current society,</p>
<p>but the hypocrisy they have is not realizing</p>
<p>if they were placed in Germany in the 40s,</p>
<p>if they were placed in a position of being a white Christian</p>
<p>during slavery at the founding of this country,</p>
<p>they would do the same thing.</p>
<p>They would do the evils they&rsquo;re now criticizing.</p>
<p>Most of them.</p>
<p>Instead, it takes a truly heroic human to think outside,</p>
<p>to be aware of all the evils going on around you</p>
<p>and take action.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy now on Twitter to call people as racist.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s hard is to see the racism when you&rsquo;re living in it</p>
<p>and your wellbeing is funded by it.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think to analyze ourselves and look honestly</p>
<p>in the mirror is very hard.</p>
<p>I also think, I make this point in actually all of my books,</p>
<p>the real, and it&rsquo;s an Eli Wiesel point,</p>
<p>that a lot of the evil in our world is the evil of silence</p>
<p>and just looking away.</p>
<p>And one form of that on Twitter is just hitting like.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a cheap way of pretending</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing something that&rsquo;s important, right?</p>
<p>After the Civil War,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of bad stuff that happens.</p>
<p>I talk about it a lot.</p>
<p>There always are people there who could stop it.</p>
<p>Most people are not responsible for the bad activities,</p>
<p>but most don&rsquo;t do something to stop it.</p>
<p>And when I say do something, I mean really do something.</p>
<p>Yeah, really.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also to push back and push back.</p>
<p>Silence on Twitter is not what Eli Wiesel was talking about.</p>
<p>So sometimes silence on Twitter is the courageous action</p>
<p>because you wait and think and learn</p>
<p>and have patience to truly understand the situation</p>
<p>before you take actual action.</p>
<p>Not participate in the outrage crowds on Twitter,</p>
<p>the hysteria of cancellation.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s hard to do is to speak up</p>
<p>when everybody else is silent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>Right, and to speak up against those</p>
<p>who you thought were on your side.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Good luck to those on the left</p>
<p>who speak up against the left.</p>
<p>And the same, good luck to those on the right</p>
<p>who speak up against the right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lonely place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a painful place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why walking in the center is tough.</p>
<p>You get attacked by both sides.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful, wonderful journey.</p>
<p>And you know what&rsquo;s interesting to me</p>
<p>and what I learned writing this book,</p>
<p>every book is a journey.</p>
<p>What I learned in the laboratory of this book, right,</p>
<p>was a lot of those figures who do stand up,</p>
<p>even in their own lifetime,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get the accolades they deserve,</p>
<p>but they make a difference.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s maybe not enough comfort</p>
<p>because you wanna see benefits in your own lifetime,</p>
<p>but I think it really matters.</p>
<p>And many of the figures I talk about</p>
<p>were not even well known in their time.</p>
<p>So you can make a difference.</p>
<p>You do impart something small in the universe</p>
<p>that can grow into something better.</p>
<p>And we shouldn&rsquo;t forget that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why I admire Boxer, the horse.</p>
<p>I will work harder,</p>
<p>even if he gets sent to the slaughter by the evil pigs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on Orwell today.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on recently.</p>
<p>I mean, Animal Farm is one of my favorite books.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been recently, I just am rereading 1984 now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been politicized, that book in general.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s a love story.</p>
<p>It is a love story.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s a, like, love is the,</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s a story of an oppressive government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a surveillance state,</p>
<p>and the nature of truth being manipulated</p>
<p>by wartime, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, so on.</p>
<p>But the beacon of hope in the human heart</p>
<p>that pulls you out, that wakes you up</p>
<p>in a world like that is a love of another human being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s transcendence.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>My understanding, you would know better than I would,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s now a best-selling book in Russia again.</p>
<p>1984?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s actually being downloaded more.</p>
<p>There was a piece on NPR.</p>
<p>I heard about this, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I hope it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re looking for love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was just gonna say.</p>
<p>Hopefully not in all the wrong places.</p>
<p>Hey, there&rsquo;s no such thing as the wrong places.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s my opinion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one that showed up naked and drunk</p>
<p>to your classroom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still surprised that was you.</p>
<p>I was wearing a wig, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Quick pause.</p>
<p>Can I take a breath?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re back.</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln</p>
<p>in his diary, as you write in your book.</p>
<p>He wrote about Lincoln,</p>
<p>our country owed all her troubles to him,</p>
<p>and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment.</p>
<p>The country is not what it was.</p>
<p>What was the idea of the country</p>
<p>that John Wilkes Booth believed in?</p>
<p>You talked about this country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just constantly being repeated in his writing.</p>
<p>For John Wilkes Booth and many other people</p>
<p>who are close to the southern part of the country</p>
<p>in the Confederacy,</p>
<p>they believe the country should be a democracy</p>
<p>for white people, a bounded democracy.</p>
<p>And Booth was horrified,</p>
<p>and we have to empathize with it, not sympathize,</p>
<p>but recognize how strange it seemed to him</p>
<p>that all of a sudden those who were slaves</p>
<p>were now soldiers with guns.</p>
<p>And he was particularly offended</p>
<p>when he saw in Washington, D.C.,</p>
<p>a group of African-American Union soldiers</p>
<p>holding southern prisoners of war.</p>
<p>And the world was turned upside down for him.</p>
<p>Democracy for him, he believed in democracy,</p>
<p>but democracy for white people,</p>
<p>and that justified mistreating black people for him.</p>
<p>So country means white people.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that different from-</p>
<p>And white Christians.</p>
<p>White Christians, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was not arguing for Jewish emancipation either.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really different</p>
<p>from what we&rsquo;ve seen in the 20th century</p>
<p>for people who justify ethnic cleansing or genocide.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the extreme example of Hitler again</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about before.</p>
<p>His view was actually,</p>
<p>he claimed he wanted a democracy for Germany.</p>
<p>He wanted a democracy of the right Germans,</p>
<p>and he wanted those who he saw infecting</p>
<p>and mongrelizing the society out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, in essence, what John Wilkes Booth thought.</p>
<p>The scary thing is those kinds of ideas,</p>
<p>you can put a pretty face on them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to use,</p>
<p>and maybe Hitler didn&rsquo;t until the war started,</p>
<p>or even parts of the war,</p>
<p>make it so clear that you just want</p>
<p>the certain kind of Germans</p>
<p>that have made Germany a great nation</p>
<p>to be the people that are running that nation,</p>
<p>and other people who are not truly interested in it,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t hold the interest of the country at heart,</p>
<p>that they should go elsewhere</p>
<p>where they can flourish also is wonderful,</p>
<p>but the good Germans,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve built all these amazing things.</p>
<p>We should give them the power and not to the others,</p>
<p>and you can put a bunch of flowery language around that.</p>
<p>Precisely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the argument that&rsquo;s made all the time today</p>
<p>against immigration,</p>
<p>that the wrong people are coming into our society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ironic,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s often made by those</p>
<p>who themselves are immigrants.</p>
<p>History teaches us that those who have arrived as immigrants</p>
<p>are no more likely to like those who come.</p>
<p>In fact, they might be against the next group</p>
<p>for just this reason,</p>
<p>because they think they&rsquo;re the right group.</p>
<p>Can you describe to me if it&rsquo;s useful at all</p>
<p>to know the difference,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a difference between white nationalism,</p>
<p>white supremacism,</p>
<p>and Christian nationalism?</p>
<p>Is there an intersection between them?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard these terms used,</p>
<p>oh, separatism too, right?</p>
<p>Is there an interesting distinction</p>
<p>that permeated that history that still lasts today?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a long history in the United States</p>
<p>of a belief in white supremacy,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not unique to the United States.</p>
<p>We actually inherit this from Europe.</p>
<p>And white supremacy is the belief that</p>
<p>for whatever reason,</p>
<p>those with lighter colored skin,</p>
<p>usually of Northern European extraction,</p>
<p>are superior, have more rights,</p>
<p>are the better people to make decisions,</p>
<p>all sorts of things.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s an aesthetic judgment</p>
<p>as much as it is a political judgment,</p>
<p>and that gets embedded in our society, right?</p>
<p>We inherit that.</p>
<p>Christian nationalism is the presumption</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just your race,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s also your Christian belief.</p>
<p>And that is actually relatively new.</p>
<p>There are little pieces of that in our history.</p>
<p>But many of those who are white supremacists,</p>
<p>even those in the Confederacy,</p>
<p>are not Christian nationalists</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t agree on which kind of Christianity,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t view those</p>
<p>who are from a different denomination of Christianity</p>
<p>as being good Christians.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t this big tent Christianity in the 19th century.</p>
<p>This notion that there is one Christian nation</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re all part of it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually really a 20th century creation.</p>
<p>It precedes the evangelical movement,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been made even more popular.</p>
<p>But it would not make sense to a Confederate</p>
<p>to say we&rsquo;re a white Christian nation.</p>
<p>It would make sense to say</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a white Protestant nation</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t consider Catholics good Christians,</p>
<p>or a white Presbyterian nation.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s something new.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s particularly dangerous</p>
<p>about this notion of Christian nationalism</p>
<p>is it creates this false history,</p>
<p>saying we&rsquo;ve always been together as Christians.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always how we&rsquo;ve defined ourselves.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not accurate.</p>
<p>Well, one interesting thing.</p>
<p>So I recently talked to a left-leaning</p>
<p>or maybe a far-left political streamer named Destiny,</p>
<p>Stephen Bunnell.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with him.</p>
<p>He does live streaming debates with people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very passionate.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve heard of this.</p>
<p>My students have told me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not actually seen it.</p>
<p>My students are always up on the most hip things.</p>
<p>Yes, that is.</p>
<p>No, no, the funny thing about him,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s already considered like a boomer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s already the old streamer</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s been doing it for 10 years.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not the cool kid anymore.</p>
<p>Anyway, he goes into some difficult political territory,</p>
<p>and he actually had a mini conversation with Nick Fuentes.</p>
<p>And he says, I mean, some of it is humor,</p>
<p>but some of it is pretty dark,</p>
<p>hard-hitting sort of criticism.</p>
<p>He says that anyone who claims</p>
<p>to be a Christian nationalist asks them</p>
<p>if they would rather have a million people</p>
<p>who are atheists from Sweden who are white come,</p>
<p>or if you would rather have a million people from Africa</p>
<p>who are Christian come.</p>
<p>And the truth comes out that this is a very surface level,</p>
<p>this kind of idea of Christian nationalism</p>
<p>is still underneath it is a deep racism,</p>
<p>like hatred towards black people.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sense I got into it.</p>
<p>It does not seem to have deep kind of,</p>
<p>yeah, like historical context to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a different,</p>
<p>a rebranding of the old kind of hate.</p>
<p>What I think is important, though,</p>
<p>in drawing this distinction</p>
<p>and why it really matters beyond the history of it</p>
<p>is someone like Lincoln quotes scripture all the time.</p>
<p>The Second Inaugural is filled,</p>
<p>Second Inaugural Address, Gettysburg Address,</p>
<p>filled with biblical references.</p>
<p>But he does it in a way that&rsquo;s not Christian nationalist</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s using the text to bring people together.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s using it as a fable of humanity.</p>
<p>And you could say he&rsquo;s not open to Islamic thinking.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s ignorant of the Islamic world.</p>
<p>But as a Jew, I&rsquo;m a Jew, reading and studying Lincoln,</p>
<p>I know he&rsquo;s a Christian,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t feel excluded from his rhetoric</p>
<p>because I share that Bible.</p>
<p>We have different views, but I don&rsquo;t feel excluded.</p>
<p>It actually brings people together.</p>
<p>The Christian nationalist approach that we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>in the 20th century, and especially in recent decades,</p>
<p>is intended to divide people.</p>
<p>It excludes Jews.</p>
<p>It excludes Christians</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t interpret Christianity their way.</p>
<p>And to say that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve always done</p>
<p>is an entire distortion of our country.</p>
<p>And it also hides why this is so dangerous.</p>
<p>Insofar as Christianity matters to our country,</p>
<p>it should be in the way Lincoln uses it,</p>
<p>as a set of common texts that many of us resonate with,</p>
<p>knowing that we have different rituals</p>
<p>and different understandings.</p>
<p>Not as a way to exclude people,</p>
<p>and not as a cover for racism, which is what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting that you could talk about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of people,</p>
<p>Muslim folks, Jewish folks, Christian folks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a way to talk about religion that&rsquo;s inclusive</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s exclusive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just been, I&rsquo;ve been listening</p>
<p>to a lot of these interfaith conversations,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>They celebrate the beauty of each religion.</p>
<p>They banter and argue with each other</p>
<p>about details and so on.</p>
<p>But it feels like love.</p>
<p>It feels like anybody from any of those religions</p>
<p>would feel welcome at that party.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Can you tell me about the disputed election of 1876?</p>
<p>So this is fascinating.</p>
<p>The 1876 election is one of many elections,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had some recently, that are intensely controversial.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re controversial because they&rsquo;re so close.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re controversial</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not always clear who&rsquo;s won.</p>
<p>In 1876, Samuel Tilden, the governor of New York,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s running as a Democratic candidate,</p>
<p>wins more votes across the country.</p>
<p>So everyone knows he becomes president, right?</p>
<p>Wrong, he doesn&rsquo;t become president</p>
<p>because in three states, South Carolina,</p>
<p>Louisiana, and Florida, it&rsquo;s very, very close.</p>
<p>And even though Tilden has more total votes,</p>
<p>if he loses those states, the electors in those states,</p>
<p>all of which go to the winner of the state,</p>
<p>would actually make Rutherford B. Hayes,</p>
<p>the Republican candidate president.</p>
<p>In all three of those states,</p>
<p>you also have Republican governors who have just lost,</p>
<p>but are still the people who have to certify the election.</p>
<p>All three states say that Hayes won,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s very close and disputed.</p>
<p>So Hayes has one more electoral vote.</p>
<p>Of course, the Democrats don&rsquo;t accept that.</p>
<p>And so we go into February,</p>
<p>the inauguration was done in March, not in January.</p>
<p>We go from November to February</p>
<p>without clear agreement on who the president is.</p>
<p>In the end, there&rsquo;s an agreement that they come to a deal,</p>
<p>which is where the Democrats will accept Hayes as president</p>
<p>in return for Hayes doing all the things</p>
<p>the Democrats want in the South.</p>
<p>And so in essence, you have a deal made</p>
<p>that one side will get all it wants</p>
<p>while allowing the other side to have the figurehead.</p>
<p>And so in a certain way,</p>
<p>this marks a moment when the Confederacy wins.</p>
<p>For example, Hayes has to agree to pull out</p>
<p>all federal force from the South,</p>
<p>which means there&rsquo;s no protection</p>
<p>for fair elections going forward.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see in states like Mississippi,</p>
<p>the number of African-American voters will decline</p>
<p>and not recover again until the late 20th century.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what that election does.</p>
<p>And from 1876 until 1896,</p>
<p>we have a series of elections that are very close.</p>
<p>It happens also in 1888</p>
<p>that the person with the most popular vote loses,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s Grover Cleveland, who loses to Benjamin Harrison.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;ll have the same issue where there&rsquo;s a dispute.</p>
<p>And so what that election shows us, 1876, 1888,</p>
<p>is that our election system</p>
<p>and the problem of having an electoral college</p>
<p>really complicates things.</p>
<p>It makes it harder for us to come to any kind of consensus,</p>
<p>any kind of agreement on who&rsquo;s won an election.</p>
<p>Super important for today,</p>
<p>because most of the 20th century,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have close elections, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>When we come to a world today</p>
<p>where our elections are very close,</p>
<p>our system is not well-designed to deal with those issues.</p>
<p>Do you draw any parallels with our time</p>
<p>and what are some key differences?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been contested elections,</p>
<p>Florida, Florida, Florida, with Al Gore,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s been just contested election</p>
<p>after contested election.</p>
<p>And of course, most famously recently,</p>
<p>with the contested election that led to January 6th.</p>
<p>So I think a couple of parallels</p>
<p>and a couple of differences.</p>
<p>One parallel is that when you have close elections,</p>
<p>the losing side&rsquo;s never happy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a myth that when you have a close election,</p>
<p>the other side just accepts it and it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And we need to be attentive to that and ready for that.</p>
<p>January 6th actually should surprise us,</p>
<p>not because it happened,</p>
<p>but because it hadn&rsquo;t happened before.</p>
<p>People who lose a close election are never happy</p>
<p>and they always think that something has been done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one parallel.</p>
<p>Second parallel is elections are violent.</p>
<p>We have this myth that our elections are peaceful.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s always violence involved in one way</p>
<p>or another, violence in either trying</p>
<p>to prevent people from voting</p>
<p>or violence in preventing people</p>
<p>from preventing people from voting, right?</p>
<p>Elections are not peaceful walks in the park.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why most countries have a centralized system</p>
<p>to manage elections and provide protection for people.</p>
<p>We need to think about that.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t vote because they&rsquo;re afraid.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna take the time,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also afraid that they&rsquo;re gonna anger someone</p>
<p>or that they&rsquo;re gonna be seen as politicizing an issue.</p>
<p>Differences.</p>
<p>In 1876, there was fraud in the election.</p>
<p>There were people who voted two, three times.</p>
<p>One of the things the Ku Klux Klan did</p>
<p>is it prevented black people from voting</p>
<p>and that it helped white people go to multiple voting booths</p>
<p>and this was quite common.</p>
<p>In the 1880s, if you went to vote,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how it would happen in a place like Chicago</p>
<p>and New York, the union boss from your factory</p>
<p>would come and get you at the factory,</p>
<p>give you lunch, get you drunk,</p>
<p>and then drive you from one voting booth to another</p>
<p>and give you a ballot that you would bring in</p>
<p>and just, and he would watch you deposit that ballot.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty nice, not gonna lie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d take that ride.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a difference.</p>
<p>That is not how our elections work now.</p>
<p>One of our great accomplishments has been to eliminate</p>
<p>virtually all the fraud in our elections.</p>
<p>How have we done that?</p>
<p>By creating safeguards.</p>
<p>It is very difficult.</p>
<p>All the evidence we have is that the minimal fraud</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s occurred in elections are onesies and twosies</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s never, in the last 20 years,</p>
<p>had any big difference in the outcome of elections.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a big difference.</p>
<p>And then another big difference, I think,</p>
<p>is that in that time, the Democrats and Republicans</p>
<p>are on the opposite sides of where they are now</p>
<p>and that changes everything, right?</p>
<p>So the Democrats then are the party of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>The Democrats are the party of exclusion.</p>
<p>The Republicans are more the party of economic expansion.</p>
<p>And the Republicans are the Big Ten party.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re reversed today.</p>
<p>Do you think, because there&rsquo;s much less election fraud now,</p>
<p>like you described, one of the lessons we wanna</p>
<p>maybe learn from that is there doesn&rsquo;t actually have</p>
<p>to be election fraud for either side</p>
<p>to claim there&rsquo;s election fraud.</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s more and more common</p>
<p>and it seems to me that in 2024 election</p>
<p>in the United States, if a Republican wins,</p>
<p>there would also be just, maybe just as likely</p>
<p>as if a Democrat wins, that there would be nuanced claims</p>
<p>of election fraud because it&rsquo;s become more and more</p>
<p>normalized.</p>
<p>I think what this history shows is that our election system</p>
<p>makes it easy for people to claim fraud</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so unnecessarily complex.</p>
<p>First of all, we don&rsquo;t have a system where the person</p>
<p>who gets the most votes is necessarily the winner.</p>
<p>So that already creates one problem.</p>
<p>Second problem is everything I talk about this in the book</p>
<p>is controlled at the county level.</p>
<p>So what happens with Hayes and Tilden in 1876</p>
<p>is you have one county official who says</p>
<p>they think one person won.</p>
<p>Another county official thinks says the other person won.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no centralized system.</p>
<p>It would be as if we allowed every airport</p>
<p>to control safety in airplanes,</p>
<p>our airplanes would not be safe.</p>
<p>Our airplanes are safe because the FAA</p>
<p>and the National Transportation Safety Board</p>
<p>have strict universal guidelines</p>
<p>for what makes for a safe plane</p>
<p>and therefore our planes generally don&rsquo;t fall</p>
<p>out of the sky.</p>
<p>Our system is very complex.</p>
<p>It has complex rules and has too many people</p>
<p>who have authority in too many different places.</p>
<p>Complexity makes it easier for someone to make an argument</p>
<p>that the wrong thing has been done.</p>
<p>We should simplify the system.</p>
<p>In Brazil, they had a very close election</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very hard for Bolsonaro who lost</p>
<p>that close election to claim there was fraud</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a central authority run by the judiciary</p>
<p>that counted the votes and it&rsquo;s just simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about which states,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about who the county officials were.</p>
<p>Did he claim or no?</p>
<p>He has not acknowledged that he lost.</p>
<p>Right, so to push back on your statement,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m undefeated in monopoly and risk</p>
<p>because anytime I lose, I walk away</p>
<p>claiming there was fraud and cheating involved</p>
<p>and I refuse to believe otherwise.</p>
<p>I just think that accusations of fraud is a narrative</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s disjoint from the reality</p>
<p>of whether there was or not fraud.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I agree, but I think we make it a little easier</p>
<p>for that narrative by having a complex convoluted system.</p>
<p>And I wonder if there&rsquo;s other improvements</p>
<p>that take us into the 21st century</p>
<p>that allow for electronic voting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of improvements</p>
<p>that it seems our system is dragging their feet on.</p>
<p>Rank choice, voting, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make this clear.</p>
<p>We claim to be the greatest 21st century democracy</p>
<p>and we still vote like the 19th century.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not even in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Most people, when they went to vote,</p>
<p>they actually like, you know, checked a box</p>
<p>and put a piece of paper in a box, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not 21st century.</p>
<p>We can move millions of dollars,</p>
<p>maybe billions for you, Lex,</p>
<p>in a bank accounts from our keyboard,</p>
<p>from our keyboards.</p>
<p>Billions of rubles.</p>
<p>Billions of pennies.</p>
<p>Pennies.</p>
<p>Why can we move money safely and not vote in the same way?</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s security there in the movement of money,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the actual engagement.</p>
<p>Most of us, depending on your age demographic,</p>
<p>click like on Facebook or Twitter or TikTok,</p>
<p>tens of thousands of times a year.</p>
<p>I think this kind of mechanism of constantly,</p>
<p>and a like is a vote.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re constantly voting, voting, voting, voting.</p>
<p>We love voting.</p>
<p>We love giving our opinion on that stuff.</p>
<p>It just seems obvious that gamifying the system,</p>
<p>which is essentially what the election is,</p>
<p>making it fun to be engaged in different issues.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also be a case,</p>
<p>now I don&rsquo;t understand these things deeply,</p>
<p>but it always seemed to me that issue-based voting</p>
<p>should be the future.</p>
<p>It seems like too complicated to vote for singular people</p>
<p>versus on ideas, which on Twitter,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t necessarily vote for people.</p>
<p>We vote for ideas.</p>
<p>If you like a tweet or not, you like it, and so on.</p>
<p>That too seems to be a possibility for improvement.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s certainly a way to improve polling.</p>
<p>We could measure public opinion better.</p>
<p>We still poll as if we&rsquo;re in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>They still actually call people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me.</p>
<p>I was talking to one pollster.</p>
<p>They will call a hundred people and get one person,</p>
<p>but they still do that.</p>
<p>They probably still call landlines, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, they try to get cell phones too,</p>
<p>but they do call landlines.</p>
<p>But one could create a system that would be far better</p>
<p>in the way you&rsquo;re describing, it seems to me, Lex,</p>
<p>to actually assess what people like and don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>So your book, your work in general,</p>
<p>your perspective on history is, I would say,</p>
<p>at least from my perspective, nonpartisan.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do an exceptionally good job of that,</p>
<p>despite the attacks and the criticisms.</p>
<p>That said, you personally, just the way you speak,</p>
<p>my judgment, and you can push back on this,</p>
<p>I think you lean left in your politics</p>
<p>on the political spectrum.</p>
<p>Maybe you can push back on that.</p>
<p>Can you make the case for either perspective</p>
<p>on your own personality as a fan of yours</p>
<p>that you do lean left or you don&rsquo;t lean left?</p>
<p>I think it depends on the kinds of issues</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I do tend to lean left on the social and cultural issues.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a believer, a firm believer.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t believe this when I was younger.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to believe that people should choose</p>
<p>their own lifestyle and that we should get out of the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a believer, deep believer as a father</p>
<p>of a 20-year-old woman that my 20-year-old daughter</p>
<p>should have the right to make any choice</p>
<p>she wants with her body.</p>
<p>And if she were to get pregnant at a fraternity party</p>
<p>at college, she should have the right to decide</p>
<p>whether to have a child or not.</p>
<p>So on those issues, that would code me left of center.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually reasonably conservative on fiscal issues.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should spend money we don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been skeptical of cryptocurrency</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>I know some of your listeners will disagree with me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s part of my ignorance of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m conservative, lowercase C,</p>
<p>in the way I think about fiscal issues.</p>
<p>I worry about debt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a believer that there are certain areas</p>
<p>where the federal government should play more of a role,</p>
<p>and there are other areas where things should be left</p>
<p>to the localities.</p>
<p>And so sometimes that can code me one way or another.</p>
<p>But I think I sound sometimes a little more left of center</p>
<p>because on the social issues, I definitely.</p>
<p>Well, that, because, I mean, there&rsquo;s other explanations,</p>
<p>not to be grilling you too hard here.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re also an exceptionally respected</p>
<p>and successful professor in the university system,</p>
<p>where sometimes there is a lean towards the left.</p>
<p>And the other aspect is, I think, your viewpoints on Trump,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re a strong critic of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And I guess the question I wanna ask is,</p>
<p>you as a historian,</p>
<p>does that color your perspective of history?</p>
<p>Can you, do you ever catch yourself</p>
<p>where maybe your criticism of Donald Trump</p>
<p>might affect how you see the Civil War?</p>
<p>Like, as you were completely diving in</p>
<p>and looking at the Civil War,</p>
<p>are you able to put aside your,</p>
<p>sort of the current day political viewpoints?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I think we have to be honest that none of us are objective.</p>
<p>We strive to be nonpartisan.</p>
<p>I really liked when you said that</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s an aspiration.</p>
<p>No one is objective.</p>
<p>We all have our biases.</p>
<p>Some people like chocolate, some like vanilla.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s just the reality, right?</p>
<p>And as far as I know, there&rsquo;s really hard,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard even to biologically explain that.</p>
<p>And so my view is that what a good historian,</p>
<p>what a good scholar does, I don&rsquo;t care what the field is,</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re self-conscious of your biases</p>
<p>and you try to recognize them as you&rsquo;re doing your research</p>
<p>and you make doubly certain</p>
<p>that where your research seems to reinforce your biases,</p>
<p>that you actually have the evidence to make that argument.</p>
<p>But I still believe even doing that,</p>
<p>that someone with a slightly different perspective</p>
<p>might read the same evidence in different ways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes history vibrant.</p>
<p>So I wrote this book in part, as I say in the introduction,</p>
<p>because I was self-critical watching Trump</p>
<p>and the things I quite frankly find deeply dangerous</p>
<p>about Donald Trump and about what happened on January 6th.</p>
<p>And I found I had not thought deeply enough</p>
<p>about the roots of that in our society</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t believe Trump or any one figure</p>
<p>creates these kinds of movements.</p>
<p>They come out of a deeper history.</p>
<p>Just a small side tangent.</p>
<p>I do believe your work is non-partisan,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also funny that there are a lot of people</p>
<p>on the right that would read your work</p>
<p>and say that you&rsquo;re partisan.</p>
<p>And I think the reason that can happen sometimes,</p>
<p>not strongly though, I think you do a really good job,</p>
<p>is like the use of certain words also.</p>
<p>I try to be cognizant of that.</p>
<p>I try not to use words that trigger people&rsquo;s tribalism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>So you have to be also aware of that</p>
<p>maybe when you&rsquo;re writing history,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re writing in general,</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re interested in remaining,</p>
<p>you can put on different hats.</p>
<p>You can be carefree in just stating your opinion</p>
<p>of criticizing Donald Trump or Joe Biden,</p>
<p>or you can be non-partisan deliberately.</p>
<p>And that takes skill probably</p>
<p>and avoiding certain triggering words.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s about choosing your battles.</p>
<p>So I try to write, because I want everyone to read them.</p>
<p>I actually think people on the left and right</p>
<p>have a lot to learn from this history.</p>
<p>So many people have said to me around the country,</p>
<p>this is history I wish I had known before.</p>
<p>But there are moments when I use words</p>
<p>that I know are controversial</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to show there&rsquo;s a fact base behind them.</p>
<p>So white supremacy does exist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had people say, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a politically correct term,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a woke term.</p>
<p>It can be used in the wrong ways.</p>
<p>One should not go around calling everything</p>
<p>one doesn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>But the Confederates were white supremacists.</p>
<p>And I use that word</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s an accurate descriptor,</p>
<p>and we need to recognize that that is a part of our history.</p>
<p>But that does trigger some people.</p>
<p>Because that language is used</p>
<p>to mean other things currently.</p>
<p>So the press will take on certain terms</p>
<p>like white supremacist</p>
<p>and label everybody white supremacist.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people that basically</p>
<p>are on the right or something like that.</p>
<p>They use this outraged language,</p>
<p>and that actually ruins the ability</p>
<p>to use the language precisely.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>For historical context.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>But you do have to, unfortunately, we do have to,</p>
<p>no, actually people disagree.</p>
<p>You might disagree with this.</p>
<p>But I tend to try to avoid,</p>
<p>like take on the responsibility of avoiding that language.</p>
<p>Like if the press is using a certain kind of language,</p>
<p>I try to avoid it.</p>
<p>Yeah, what I try to do is sometimes avoid it,</p>
<p>but where I think the language is necessary.</p>
<p>To be precise, but also to contextualize.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t call all Confederates white supremacists,</p>
<p>but I point out where white supremacist ideas</p>
<p>have influenced them, right?</p>
<p>And I point out where certain individuals</p>
<p>are doing things that resonate with that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m against these kind of blanket labels and categories.</p>
<p>And you also have to speak about white supremacism</p>
<p>in that context in a nuanced way.</p>
<p>So people use white supremacists</p>
<p>without thinking what that means,</p>
<p>and they just use it as a slow word,</p>
<p>like this evil person.</p>
<p>But white supremacist is also just an ideology</p>
<p>that a lot of people have believed throughout.</p>
<p>Supremacy, whatever, white, black supremacy,</p>
<p>whatever supremacy.</p>
<p>Believing that some people are better than others.</p>
<p>Some group is better than another.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been nations built around these kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>And a lot of human history is built around those ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just evil people believe in this.</p>
<p>We in the United States of America</p>
<p>believe this kind of ideology is not productive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unethical.</p>
<p>But those ideas have been held by a lot of people.</p>
<p>And not like fringe groups, but majorities of nations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the same about anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>And there are many people who are not anti-Semites,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t recognize that they&rsquo;re carrying around</p>
<p>or promoting anti-Semitic ideas or anti-Semitic myths.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thought that&rsquo;s been held by a lot of people,</p>
<p>and you need to be convinced out of it.</p>
<p>That requires conversation and being empathetic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just calling somebody anti-Semite and you&rsquo;re evil</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve ever said something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a dog whistle against Jewish people.</p>
<p>You have to be open-hearted to that.</p>
<p>These are ideas that you have to contend with,</p>
<p>that you have to ultimately, I think,</p>
<p>heal the division behind those ideas</p>
<p>by having empathetic conversations with people,</p>
<p>as opposed to, again, throwing poop.</p>
<p>I just like saying poop.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Ooh, I got a challenge for you.</p>
<p>Given that you have been an outspoken critic of Donald Trump,</p>
<p>can you say one thing you like</p>
<p>and one thing you don&rsquo;t like about Donald Trump?</p>
<p>And perhaps, can you do the same</p>
<p>for our current president, Joe Biden?</p>
<p>One thing you like and one thing you dislike.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s harder for me to do the one thing I dislike</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many things I dislike.</p>
<p>But the one thing I like about Donald Trump,</p>
<p>he believes that America should be a better country.</p>
<p>I disagree on what he thinks it should be,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not a declinist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s someone who believes the world could be made better.</p>
<p>I disagree with what he&rsquo;s trying to do.</p>
<p>I disagree with how he&rsquo;s trying to do it,</p>
<p>but I like the fact that he thinks it can be better.</p>
<p>His whole argument for himself</p>
<p>is that he can make things better.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he can,</p>
<p>but I think things can be made better.</p>
<p>So I like the second half of that sentence</p>
<p>when he says, I can make things better.</p>
<p>Take the I out.</p>
<p>I like the can be better</p>
<p>because there are too many people on the left and the right</p>
<p>who think that we can&rsquo;t make things better.</p>
<p>We have to accept them as they are or they&rsquo;re getting worse.</p>
<p>I think a world without hope is horrible.</p>
<p>And I think what he has offered his followers</p>
<p>is a kind of hope.</p>
<p>So underneath his message is a kind of optimism</p>
<p>for the future of this nation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a narcissistic optimism, but it&rsquo;s still an optimism.</p>
<p>Yes, that he&rsquo;s promising that if you elect him again,</p>
<p>he will make things better.</p>
<p>And I think people need to be told</p>
<p>and we need to believe that we can make things better.</p>
<p>So that part I accept.</p>
<p>And I reject those who say we can&rsquo;t make things better.</p>
<p>My whole historical career is about showing</p>
<p>that history gives us tools to make things better.</p>
<p>So I like the idea of trying to make things better</p>
<p>and giving people hope and reason to believe</p>
<p>that things can be better.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the main thing you dislike about Donald Trump?</p>
<p>I think he has no concern or care for the welfare</p>
<p>of anyone other than himself.</p>
<p>So assuming on a basic human psychology perspective.</p>
<p>And I think he doesn&rsquo;t even care about his children.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s just, I think it&rsquo;s him.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s gone into a rabbit hole.</p>
<p>He might not always have been this way.</p>
<p>I did watch him a long time in New York City</p>
<p>when I was growing up in New York.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;s been in this path.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s an extreme,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a clinical kind of narcissism.</p>
<p>So do you, when you analyze presidents</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve written about presidents,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t just look at policies and so on.</p>
<p>You look at the human being.</p>
<p>Of course you have to.</p>
<p>Leadership is about human being.</p>
<p>Policy matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one part of the equation, but it&rsquo;s not the only part.</p>
<p>What about Joe Biden?</p>
<p>What do you like and what do you dislike about him?</p>
<p>So what I like about Joe Biden is in contrast to Trump.</p>
<p>I think Joe Biden really, right now in his career,</p>
<p>sees his role as the shepherd of democracy.</p>
<p>He really believes that it&rsquo;s his role as president</p>
<p>to make our democracy more stable and more vibrant.</p>
<p>I think he really believes.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s doing what he&rsquo;s doing right now.</p>
<p>And he comes from that system, the political system,</p>
<p>that basically the process of democracy,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s worked there for many decades.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s all he knows.</p>
<p>And he wants that to propagate for better and for worse.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not an extreme democratic partisan at all.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually a pretty middle of the road guy</p>
<p>on most issues.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t like him for that,</p>
<p>but I think he is about democracy.</p>
<p>What do I dislike about Biden?</p>
<p>I think he does not have the capacity right now</p>
<p>to provide the language and the public discussion</p>
<p>of where our country should go.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have a language to inspire</p>
<p>and build enthusiasm for the future.</p>
<p>That would probably be one of my,</p>
<p>I mean, because I&rsquo;m a sucker for great speeches.</p>
<p>And so for me, that&rsquo;s definitely a thing that stands out</p>
<p>for several reasons.</p>
<p>One, in a time, because we&rsquo;ve been facing</p>
<p>so many challenges like the pandemic.</p>
<p>It just seems like, to me, it seems like a easy layup.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many troubles we&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>that just require a great unifying president</p>
<p>with a great, like, just if I were to speak candidly</p>
<p>about kind of the speaking ability of Obama, for example,</p>
<p>Obama would just destroy this right now,</p>
<p>both on the war in Ukraine, on the pandemic, all of it.</p>
<p>The unified, there&rsquo;s a hunger for unification, I believe.</p>
<p>Maybe people disagree with that</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve, I think people have become cynical</p>
<p>in that the divisions that we&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>are kind of already really baked in.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really planted their feet, but I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a huge hunger,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit of a quiet hunger for a unifier,</p>
<p>for a great unifier.</p>
<p>I agree, I agree.</p>
<p>And I think what a great speech does</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s like a great piece of music or poetry.</p>
<p>It helps you see something in yourself</p>
<p>and feel something you didn&rsquo;t feel before.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t overcome all,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that speeches are unifying,</p>
<p>but I think what they are is they&rsquo;re mobilizing.</p>
<p>And you can mobilize people to the same mission</p>
<p>with different points of view.</p>
<p>Do you think Trump derangement syndrome</p>
<p>is a medical condition?</p>
<p>Also, is there such a thing as Biden derangement syndrome?</p>
<p>What I mean by that, it&rsquo;s a funny kind of question,</p>
<p>but why are people so deeply outraged,</p>
<p>seemingly beyond reason at their hatred</p>
<p>or support of Donald Trump, but hatred in particular?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of friends and people I respect</p>
<p>like lose their mind completely.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s a medical condition</p>
<p>or not because I&rsquo;m not a medical doctor.</p>
<p>So my kids say I&rsquo;m the wrong kind of doctor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a doctor, so let me take you from here.</p>
<p>No, the fact that you get the doctor&rsquo;s sign</p>
<p>after getting a PhD is a ridiculous hilarity to me.</p>
<p>Hilarious, ridiculous.</p>
<p>So as the wrong kind of doctor,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna comment on whether it&rsquo;s a medical condition,</p>
<p>but I do think you&rsquo;re onto something.</p>
<p>I think there is a way in which these men</p>
<p>become touchstones of anger.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all kinds of anger and anxiety that people have.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen this in other historical periods.</p>
<p>You center it on one person.</p>
<p>In a way, that&rsquo;s John Wilkes Booth and Lincoln.</p>
<p>He actually didn&rsquo;t have a personal beef with Lincoln.</p>
<p>It was that all the things he feared</p>
<p>were manifest in that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an old story.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s made worse by social media</p>
<p>and the way we&rsquo;re bombarded.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it becomes a drug.</p>
<p>I mean, there are people I know who hate Trump</p>
<p>or Biden so much and just watch them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they don&rsquo;t watch them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that they do watch them, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just sort of, and it triggers you</p>
<p>and you get hateful.</p>
<p>And then you feel like you&rsquo;ve done something</p>
<p>by shouting out your hate or typing in.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a derangement syndrome.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a way in which our energy gets channeled</p>
<p>and expressed in totally useless ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s an interesting psychology,</p>
<p>which reminds me, I need to explore that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve noticed that, believe it or not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy for me to believe,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s people watching this right now</p>
<p>who really hate me.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re watching because they hate me.</p>
<p>They hate the way I look, the way I speak,</p>
<p>the mumbling, all of that.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re still watching.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to say that, as I nervously</p>
<p>try to explain myself, I&rsquo;d like to say</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not a productive way.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of, because I, what is it?</p>
<p>Is it the same psychological effect</p>
<p>when you see a car crash and you keep staring?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some kind of thing that pulls you in,</p>
<p>but I feel like it&rsquo;s that feeling.</p>
<p>This is probably slightly different,</p>
<p>but you kind of want to, you want to maybe feel something</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an anger in you already,</p>
<p>frustrations from day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Life is hard, and you just want to channel</p>
<p>that anger towards something.</p>
<p>But I just, the internet really makes that easy</p>
<p>for some reason.</p>
<p>And it makes sense of your life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>For people whose lives are chaos,</p>
<p>hating you and blaming you gives order to their lives.</p>
<p>Yeah, if it makes you happy, please continue.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m curious, it seems to bother you though,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yeah, hate of any kind, not towards me,</p>
<p>just the people, because I think about them</p>
<p>and I tend to think that most people</p>
<p>are amazing human beings and that have a capacity</p>
<p>to do great things in this world.</p>
<p>And so I just think that&rsquo;s not a productive way of being.</p>
<p>Like psychologically for anything whatsoever,</p>
<p>everybody has quirks that you can hate,</p>
<p>but you just focus on the really positive stuff</p>
<p>and you celebrate that stuff.</p>
<p>And that feels good.</p>
<p>That has a momentum to it.</p>
<p>I guess the hate has a momentum to it too.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to highlight.</p>
<p>If you follow the momentum of hate,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to maybe feel good in the short term,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s gonna fuck you over</p>
<p>more and more in your life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you have to be cognizant of that</p>
<p>as you interact with the internet.</p>
<p>I agree with everything you said,</p>
<p>but I think people who do things</p>
<p>that are influential and serious,</p>
<p>there always are some people who hate them.</p>
<p>I suppose that, but I wanted to show the difference</p>
<p>between philosophical disagreement that borders on hate</p>
<p>and like what&rsquo;s called like hate watching,</p>
<p>where you just, which is what I would say TDS is,</p>
<p>which is you&rsquo;re almost enjoying</p>
<p>how much you hate this person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just sitting in their hate and you forgot,</p>
<p>you lose all reason, you lose everything.</p>
<p>Your capacity to think as an individual,</p>
<p>to empathize with others, you lose all of that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in this muck of hate and you,</p>
<p>and somehow it helps you make sense</p>
<p>of this particular difficult moment in your life.</p>
<p>But otherwise it just, it just seems like a shitty way</p>
<p>to live, but disagreement, definitely.</p>
<p>I like disagreement.</p>
<p>But I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>and I think this is your message too, right?</p>
<p>Is that don&rsquo;t let the fact that people don&rsquo;t like you</p>
<p>or even that some people hate you</p>
<p>stop you from doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Think about how you can perhaps trigger them less,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t stop what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I see too many, and this is why I bring this up,</p>
<p>too many of my students, too many young,</p>
<p>very talented people who are afraid to take risks</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re afraid that someone will hate them.</p>
<p>And that can&rsquo;t get in your way.</p>
<p>The reality is most people,</p>
<p>or there will always be at least one person</p>
<p>that will get, that will have your back</p>
<p>and that will support you, and you just focus on them.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re doing the right thing,</p>
<p>focus on them for the strength.</p>
<p>But in general, I&rsquo;m exaggerating here,</p>
<p>because most of the time,</p>
<p>99% of people are supportive on the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that something about the human psychology</p>
<p>really stands out to you when somebody criticizes.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s easy on the internet.</p>
<p>This is historically different from where we were before,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy now to say hurtful things to people</p>
<p>and not have to even deal with them</p>
<p>looking at you in the face.</p>
<p>One of the things that encourages politeness</p>
<p>is the fact that we&rsquo;re looking at one another.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, we are naturally programmed</p>
<p>not to want the other person to react to us in certain ways.</p>
<p>But when we don&rsquo;t see their face,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy to say all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Let me actually comment on that point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people on the internet</p>
<p>that say that I don&rsquo;t sort of push back on points</p>
<p>or criticize people or ask the hard questions enough.</p>
<p>First of all, oftentimes I disagree with that assessment.</p>
<p>But also, I don&rsquo;t think you guys realize</p>
<p>how hard that is to do when you&rsquo;re sitting with a person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about access.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about them being famous.</p>
<p>Just on a basic human level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to ask a hard question</p>
<p>from a place of empathy.</p>
<p>Except when I&rsquo;m sitting here.</p>
<p>You seem to be able to ask me hard.</p>
<p>No, this is a super fun,</p>
<p>I mean, when there&rsquo;s brilliant people like you</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s nothing to push back on, that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a basic human thing that doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s almost easier to be a journalist.</p>
<p>Like, journalists do this well</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t have empathy for the person.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just asking the hard questions.</p>
<p>So, where were you at this time last night?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s very suspicious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in contradiction to what you said.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just doing factual stuff.</p>
<p>And if you actually truly have a conversation</p>
<p>with another human being you empathize, it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>Because they have a story.</p>
<p>They have a vision of themselves</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re the good person.</p>
<p>And to call somebody a liar while having empathy</p>
<p>basically imply that they&rsquo;re a liar,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s damn, damn hard.</p>
<p>So, anyway, I&rsquo;m trying to figure this thing out.</p>
<p>Can you make the case that the January 6th storming</p>
<p>of the US Capitol is a big deal?</p>
<p>And can you make the case that it is not a big deal?</p>
<p>I think the case is overwhelming that it was a big deal.</p>
<p>And I opened the book with this</p>
<p>before going back to the end of the Civil War</p>
<p>because I think it echoes that moment.</p>
<p>You had a group of people who literally tried</p>
<p>to stop the peaceful transfer of power</p>
<p>and were intending, and there&rsquo;s overwhelming evidence</p>
<p>of this, if they had caught the vice president</p>
<p>or the Speaker of the House to do bodily harm to them</p>
<p>or to kidnap them.</p>
<p>So this was a coup d&rsquo;etat.</p>
<p>That is the definition of a coup d&rsquo;etat</p>
<p>when you try to capture and prevent elected officials</p>
<p>from doing their job.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge deal.</p>
<p>That had happened before in our country in states.</p>
<p>I talk about this in Louisiana, in Tennessee,</p>
<p>in places like that after the Civil War,</p>
<p>but it never happened in the Capitol.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge deal.</p>
<p>That is, if I might say, that&rsquo;s like third,</p>
<p>what we would think of as third world behavior</p>
<p>in our society.</p>
<p>And no offense to those from other parts of the world,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to make a point</p>
<p>is how we see that as happening somewhere else, not here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big fucking deal.</p>
<p>The case that it&rsquo;s not a big deal,</p>
<p>I guess the case to make there is that they didn&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
<p>The case that it&rsquo;s not a big deal</p>
<p>is not that their intentions were not bad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how you can defend their intentions.</p>
<p>The case that it&rsquo;s not a big deal</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re a bunch of clowns.</p>
<p>And yeah, they broke in, but in the end,</p>
<p>once they got in there, they didn&rsquo;t know what to do,</p>
<p>which is true.</p>
<p>And so, I think a professional coup plotter</p>
<p>would say these were the amateurs</p>
<p>and that they had no real chance of succeeding</p>
<p>because once they got into the Capitol,</p>
<p>they had no plan what to do next.</p>
<p>What were they gonna do?</p>
<p>Steal stapler from Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t seem to have a plan</p>
<p>and then what ended up happening, they left the building.</p>
<p>Well, that would be the case that it&rsquo;s not a big deal</p>
<p>because their intention was not to overthrow.</p>
<p>Their intention was to protest</p>
<p>because if the intention was to overthrow,</p>
<p>it would be much more organized.</p>
<p>I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming</p>
<p>that they intended to stop.</p>
<p>They were there to stop the certification of the election.</p>
<p>They were there to prevent Donald Trump</p>
<p>from having to leave office.</p>
<p>They just didn&rsquo;t have a good plan.</p>
<p>This was the keystone cops.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re saying there is statistically some possibility</p>
<p>that this would have succeeded</p>
<p>at halting the basic process of democracy.</p>
<p>You could imagine a scenario where it might have</p>
<p>if they had gotten lucky.</p>
<p>Sure, if they had caught the vice president.</p>
<p>But what could have, if they caught the vice president-</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t go on and certify then.</p>
<p>He has to be there.</p>
<p>No, but don&rsquo;t you think that would resolve itself</p>
<p>through police action and so on?</p>
<p>My question is how much is this individual hooligans</p>
<p>and how much of this is a gigantic movement</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s challenging the very fabric of our democracy?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not a gigantic movement,</p>
<p>but it was a small coup d&rsquo;etat</p>
<p>that could have actually made the transition</p>
<p>much more difficult.</p>
<p>Was there a scenario where Donald Trump</p>
<p>stayed in office legitimately?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But was there a scenario where they created</p>
<p>a great deal of chaos that further undermined</p>
<p>our democracy?</p>
<p>Absolutely, yes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it would happen, right?</p>
<p>They capture Pence, right?</p>
<p>They either kidnap him and try to ransom him,</p>
<p>or they, which is what they were trying to do</p>
<p>with the Michigan governor, Governor Whitmer,</p>
<p>or they kill him.</p>
<p>And then Donald Trump says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Okay, well, there&rsquo;s no vice president,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;so you can&rsquo;t certify.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Senate would choose someone else to be vice president,</p>
<p>but Donald Trump says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, that&rsquo;s not legitimate.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that Donald Trump</p>
<p>would say something like that?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I disagree with you.</p>
<p>He said that morning that Pence should not certify.</p>
<p>He said that morning.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a difference between sort of Twitter rhetoric.</p>
<p>No, no, he said it at a rally.</p>
<p>Sure, rally rhetoric.</p>
<p>And there is a threshold.</p>
<p>It feels like a big leap.</p>
<p>He asked people around him in the Oval Office</p>
<p>how he could make that happen.</p>
<p>He tried to get a new person appointed attorney general</p>
<p>who would do that.</p>
<p>He tried to find legal justification for it.</p>
<p>I think the evidence is overwhelming</p>
<p>that Trump was supportive of efforts</p>
<p>after the election didn&rsquo;t go the way he wanted</p>
<p>to keep him in office.</p>
<p>And whether that&rsquo;s legally actionable</p>
<p>and whether one thinks that means he&rsquo;s a bad president</p>
<p>or not is a matter of opinion.</p>
<p>But facts are facts.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just wonder if it&rsquo;s possible for him</p>
<p>to have stayed president in this kind of context.</p>
<p>To me, it seems like a heated,</p>
<p>just like you said, elections can even be violent.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re heated.</p>
<p>People are very upset.</p>
<p>When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016,</p>
<p>I was in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The amount of anger,</p>
<p>I was just, the energy I was getting from people.</p>
<p>I mean, if there was any way to channel that anger,</p>
<p>I think people would be in trouble.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s anger.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with that.</p>
<p>And that is right.</p>
<p>And elections are violent, as I said.</p>
<p>But this is different.</p>
<p>This is the person in the office of the presidency</p>
<p>using the power of the presidency to try to stay in office,</p>
<p>to imperil people&rsquo;s lives, to distort our government</p>
<p>on a scale we had not seen before.</p>
<p>And these are not opinions of mine.</p>
<p>We have the documentary evidence.</p>
<p>We have the testimony from people about this.</p>
<p>We can differ over what you think</p>
<p>of his presidency as a whole.</p>
<p>We can differ over whether you think</p>
<p>he should be held legally responsible.</p>
<p>Those are matters of opinion.</p>
<p>But the facts are he sat on January 6th,</p>
<p>watched it on TV, did not send ever, ever.</p>
<p>Did he ever send any protection for Congress?</p>
<p>That is his job.</p>
<p>And throughout, asked, continued to ask</p>
<p>how this certification could be prevented.</p>
<p>To you, that&rsquo;s not incompetence, that&rsquo;s malevolence.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>If I watch my children getting harmed</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t do something about it, I&rsquo;m watching it.</p>
<p>And in fact, I take action that tries to help those</p>
<p>who are doing the harm,</p>
<p>you would not just say I&rsquo;m an incompetent president,</p>
<p>a parent, you would say I was a negligent parent</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d call parental support to take away my children.</p>
<p>I was troubled by the way the press covered it,</p>
<p>that they politicized the crap out of that.</p>
<p>And not just the press, but also Congress itself.</p>
<p>It just seemed like impeachment and all of this,</p>
<p>there just seemed to be a kind of circus</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t interested in democracy or non-partisanship.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, so it&rsquo;s very difficult for me</p>
<p>to see the situation with clear eyes</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been colored by the press.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult for me to know what is even true.</p>
<p>Members of Congress, including our members of Congress</p>
<p>from our district and others, right?</p>
<p>Their lives were threatened.</p>
<p>They were traumatized.</p>
<p>I have a lot of students,</p>
<p>at least a dozen who are staff members,</p>
<p>more than half are Republicans.</p>
<p>Part of what traumatized them</p>
<p>was that the president did not do his job to protect them.</p>
<p>Yes, as a child would be traumatized,</p>
<p>not only if harmed by someone,</p>
<p>but if mom and dad don&rsquo;t do everything they can.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes people feel safe</p>
<p>is they know their parents,</p>
<p>they know their person in authority</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t always keep them safe,</p>
<p>but they want to know the person&rsquo;s always trying.</p>
<p>I agree with you that there, listen,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody that believes in this kind of idea of family,</p>
<p>especially people I work with,</p>
<p>that to me is a high ideal to protect.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a little bit different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s his job.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bit different than protecting democracy.</p>
<p>Those are two different things.</p>
<p>Protecting your employees</p>
<p>and protecting democracy is an ideal.</p>
<p>You could say he didn&rsquo;t protect either,</p>
<p>but I think the criticism</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t protect the employees is one thing.</p>
<p>But the employees in this case</p>
<p>are the ones carrying out democracy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like saying the general</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t protect his soldiers</p>
<p>is maybe not protecting his employees.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also not protecting the war effort, right?</p>
<p>It is his, the people we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>are the people who are actually doing</p>
<p>the work of democracy at that moment,</p>
<p>the most basic function of democracy,</p>
<p>which is certifying votes.</p>
<p>And their lives with, I&rsquo;m telling you,</p>
<p>I had students, one who works for Senator Romney,</p>
<p>for example, who spent hours in a closet</p>
<p>hearing people outside, looking on her phone,</p>
<p>when is the president sending people to protect us</p>
<p>so we can do our job?</p>
<p>And she was not happy</p>
<p>with the way the election turned out,</p>
<p>but she was there to do her job</p>
<p>because she believes in democracy</p>
<p>to service the Senate and the Senate&rsquo;s role.</p>
<p>What should have Donald Trump done</p>
<p>without turning him into a different human being?</p>
<p>He should have immediately,</p>
<p>just as we were watching things get breached,</p>
<p>the moment they had,</p>
<p>that the members of the House and the Senate</p>
<p>had to evacuate their respective chambers,</p>
<p>he should have immediately gone on TV</p>
<p>and Twitter and every space he could</p>
<p>and tell his supporters to leave</p>
<p>and say what he never said.</p>
<p>This is un-American what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Never use those words.</p>
<p>This is un-American.</p>
<p>This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely against anyone storming the Capitol like this.</p>
<p>Go home now, please.</p>
<p>Or you can use his own language, but tell him to leave.</p>
<p>Yeah, and immediately, as soon as,</p>
<p>we know he was watching for hours</p>
<p>and we have testimony from his own daughter, from Ivanka,</p>
<p>saying she tried time and again</p>
<p>to get him to say something earlier on, and he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He watched it.</p>
<p>He can still criticize all the politicians.</p>
<p>He can criticize everyone he wants,</p>
<p>but he should have told him to leave.</p>
<p>All he has to do in that moment</p>
<p>is basic protecting democracy, protecting the Capitol.</p>
<p>Leave, tell them to leave,</p>
<p>and do everything he can to find any kind of force</p>
<p>he can give to go protect the Capitol.</p>
<p>I wonder how difficult it is</p>
<p>to lose a presidential election.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happened so many times, we know.</p>
<p>I understand that, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>especially when like, what is it?</p>
<p>80 million people vote for you,</p>
<p>or like some, like millions and millions and millions</p>
<p>of people vote for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>This democracy thing is crazy.</p>
<p>George H.W. Bush won a war in the Middle East, right?</p>
<p>He had 90% approval rating,</p>
<p>and then a year later lost the election</p>
<p>to someone, Bill Clinton, he thought,</p>
<p>had none of the experience he had.</p>
<p>Someone didn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>he believed didn&rsquo;t have the right moral character.</p>
<p>And Bush did everything he could</p>
<p>to help the next president get started well,</p>
<p>and they became good friends.</p>
<p>George W. Bush, he didn&rsquo;t love Obama.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s considered one of the smoothest transitions.</p>
<p>George W. Bush ordered every single person</p>
<p>in his administration to do everything they could</p>
<p>to help the new, that&rsquo;s what a leader does.</p>
<p>Yeah, humility is one of the things I admire in leaders.</p>
<p>Well, that felt heated.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, can you just linger on,</p>
<p>how do you think we can heal the divide in this country?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>There feels to be a strong division.</p>
<p>I think we can heal the divide.</p>
<p>I think, as you said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many opportunities with new technology</p>
<p>to bring people together,</p>
<p>just as we&rsquo;re using it to tear them apart.</p>
<p>I have the best job in the world</p>
<p>because I get to teach so many students.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have 300 in my class in the spring,</p>
<p>in my U.S. history class.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;ve found with my students</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re mostly not Democrats or Republicans.</p>
<p>They mostly care about the same things.</p>
<p>Every one of my students seems to care about climate change.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought you were gonna say TikTok, but okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, TikTok.</p>
<p>Second to that, climate change.</p>
<p>You know, and I think they,</p>
<p>I think they offer a new future for us.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll say as a historian.</p>
<p>We go through cycles of division</p>
<p>and cycles of less division, less partisanship.</p>
<p>One moment when it seems people agree too much</p>
<p>on the mainstream encourages people to go to the extremes.</p>
<p>When people see the extremes,</p>
<p>they wanna come back to the middle.</p>
<p>And that is where my students are.</p>
<p>Most of my students want lower inflation.</p>
<p>They agree with Republicans on that,</p>
<p>but they want more to be done about climate change.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the middle on these issues.</p>
<p>And I think giving them more opportunity.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the best way to heal our divisions, honestly?</p>
<p>Get the old men out and the young women and men in.</p>
<p>Because they ultimately don&rsquo;t have that same division</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like deeply baked in.</p>
<p>Not only that, they find it disgusting</p>
<p>in the way you and I do.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right way to have conversations?</p>
<p>I mean, just to stay on that</p>
<p>with people on the left and the right.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how often you practice this.</p>
<p>You care about politics.</p>
<p>How often do you talk to people who voted for Trump</p>
<p>or who are Republicans?</p>
<p>I try, but it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>75% of people I talk to are not those people.</p>
<p>Do you have people who are Trump supporters</p>
<p>in your extended family?</p>
<p>Thanksgiving?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t in my extended family.</p>
<p>Are they no longer?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re no longer in my family.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In solid fashion.</p>
<p>I have taken them out of the photograph.</p>
<p>They do not exist.</p>
<p>Yeah, you just erase, yeah.</p>
<p>I do, but I know, I have friends who fall into that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still a minority of my friend group.</p>
<p>So I wanna be clear that I&rsquo;m not as good at this as I should.</p>
<p>But I think we do have to reach out.</p>
<p>But I also, I&rsquo;m less interested, honestly,</p>
<p>in refighting old battles with old dogs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more interested in finding ways</p>
<p>to get a new crop of people educated and involved</p>
<p>and engaged without imparting the same partisanship on them.</p>
<p>So I will support, and this I have to,</p>
<p>I will support and encourage,</p>
<p>especially any student of mine,</p>
<p>but any young person who is smart, has good ideas,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care whether,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ask whether they&rsquo;re a Democrat or Republican.</p>
<p>And I have given money to some young candidates</p>
<p>who are not Democrats.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a generational change.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s reaching out and trying to get people</p>
<p>to see beyond partisan divisions</p>
<p>who are in their 20s and teens rather than,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we do our podcast.</p>
<p>This is Democracy.</p>
<p>Zachary and I do that, my son and I,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re exactly that.</p>
<p>You will never hear an episode</p>
<p>where we take one side or another.</p>
<p>Our goal is to explain the issue,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the challenges of democracy in China,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s climate change, or whatever it is,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s memory of war in our society,</p>
<p>and to explain the issue</p>
<p>and then offer people an optimistic pathway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s neither one side nor the other.</p>
<p>So actually, to push back a little bit on young people,</p>
<p>I do see that, the exhaustion with the partisanship.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve also, and this, I think,</p>
<p>is the case throughout history, and I see it now,</p>
<p>especially in the teenage years,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;m being honest with boys,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a desire for extremism in various directions,</p>
<p>all kinds of extremism.</p>
<p>Like just extreme awesomeness or extreme anything,</p>
<p>just extreme, and F the man that tries to make me behave,</p>
<p>this kind of energy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you can take any ideology,</p>
<p>basically any extreme ideology starts being exciting,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re a Marxist or a communist,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just gonna be like for socialized healthcare.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be like, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go full hammer and sickle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna wear red.</p>
<p>And then the same with white supremacy</p>
<p>or just red pill, the way you see society,</p>
<p>the way you see the world, the extremism is there.</p>
<p>And part of that, it&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>to steal that perspective, it can be productive,</p>
<p>that energy, if it&rsquo;s controlled.</p>
<p>And especially if we have institutions</p>
<p>that keep it a little under control.</p>
<p>One of the criticisms I have with, a lot of people have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually much more moderate than that criticism,</p>
<p>of universities is they give a little too much power</p>
<p>to the 18-year-old who just showed up</p>
<p>with their Marxist books and so on,</p>
<p>and they wanna burn the whole thing down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful, but the whole process of the universities</p>
<p>get different viewpoints, educate more,</p>
<p>make that person&rsquo;s viewpoint more sophisticated,</p>
<p>complex, nuanced, and all that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s more talk than action.</p>
<p>In my experience, there is, especially among young men,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re absolutely right,</p>
<p>there is a valorization of the tough guy.</p>
<p>Because most men, 18 and 19,</p>
<p>are still not fully comfortable in their masculinity,</p>
<p>however they&rsquo;re going to define it.</p>
<p>And so a way of performing that</p>
<p>is being extreme in one way or another.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve definitely seen that,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s more often than not rhetoric.</p>
<p>And actually, there&rsquo;s a very strong power</p>
<p>of peer pressure and conformity that works on young people.</p>
<p>And the positive side of that now</p>
<p>is the peer pressure among them</p>
<p>is not to join one party or the other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to say, this is terrible,</p>
<p>look at how our parents are screwing things up.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And I think we can lean into that</p>
<p>and get a lot of positive creative action out of that.</p>
<p>On universities, you brought this up a few times,</p>
<p>and I think we have to be careful.</p>
<p>I think you and I agree on this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that universities are free of bias,</p>
<p>but universities, especially large universities,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s UT, MIT, Yale, whatever we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re large, complex empires.</p>
<p>And most universities, people in the arts,</p>
<p>tend to be a little left of center, it&rsquo;s self-selection.</p>
<p>Those in engineering tend to be pretty much in the middle,</p>
<p>and those at business schools tend to be right of center.</p>
<p>And so I think we need to be careful not to generalize.</p>
<p>At the University of Texas, there&rsquo;s as much influence</p>
<p>from the business school and the athletic department</p>
<p>as there is from the humanities.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a left-leaning campus.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also true at Yale.</p>
<p>You have the School of Management at Yale.</p>
<p>You have a huge medical school, right?</p>
<p>And people who are very professional</p>
<p>and less political on a lot of these issues.</p>
<p>So I think we have to be careful.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s certain pockets of things,</p>
<p>but some of that you&rsquo;re never going to avoid, right?</p>
<p>Engineers are always gonna be the people who-</p>
<p>Hey now, easy now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard, who want to generally find</p>
<p>some objective measure and avoid political interpretation.</p>
<p>They wanna find their objective measure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised how most people in robotics don&rsquo;t seem to,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re afraid of humans.</p>
<p>They run away from humans.</p>
<p>Precisely, precisely.</p>
<p>And the arts people are always gonna be more touchy-feely,</p>
<p>and the business people are always gonna like markets.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>And my own personal opinion on this is,</p>
<p>this is just me talking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s grounded in data,</p>
<p>but with just my own experiences,</p>
<p>it seems a lot of the things that people criticize</p>
<p>about universities comes from administrations,</p>
<p>from the bureaucracies.</p>
<p>The faculty and the students are, even with biases,</p>
<p>are really interesting people.</p>
<p>And all of their different, I wouldn&rsquo;t call them biases,</p>
<p>but the different perspectives add to the conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the administrate, too much, of course you need,</p>
<p>just like with institutions, you need some,</p>
<p>but too much, it becomes too heavy-handed.</p>
<p>And somehow that has been getting a little bit out of hand</p>
<p>at a bunch of universities, just too much administration.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what the mechanism is</p>
<p>to make it more efficient,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s been always the struggle.</p>
<p>Maybe the public criticism is the very mechanism</p>
<p>that makes universities, the administration smaller.</p>
<p>Absolutely, we have those issues,</p>
<p>and you can also say athletics has gotten out of control.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Like you said, you co-host a podcast</p>
<p>with your son, Zachary, called This Is Democracy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been, that&rsquo;s a million questions I can ask,</p>
<p>but just that pops to memory, what&rsquo;s been a challenging</p>
<p>or maybe an eye-opening conversation you&rsquo;ve had on it?</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;ve had a lot of eye-opening conversations.</p>
<p>Our most recent episode is an episode on the German right.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m sure many of your listeners know,</p>
<p>there was a group called the Reichsb√ºrger,</p>
<p>I think they still exist in Germany,</p>
<p>they were actually led by a former German prince,</p>
<p>and they had been planning to assassinate</p>
<p>the Bundeskanzler and were organizing</p>
<p>all sorts of other efforts.</p>
<p>They do not believe that the current German government</p>
<p>is legitimate, they think the last legitimate government</p>
<p>was the Nazi government, they see the whole post-war period</p>
<p>as illegitimate.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the German far right.</p>
<p>Correct, and we had on a member of the German Bundestag,</p>
<p>of their parliament, who&rsquo;s been involved</p>
<p>in the investigations or in the oversight</p>
<p>of the investigations, and talking with her</p>
<p>about the depth of these issues</p>
<p>and the challenges they face in Germany.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not a huge part of German society,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a significant number of people,</p>
<p>probably more than 20,000 people who are part of this,</p>
<p>to me, brought home how much of what we thought</p>
<p>was the past is still in the present.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a recurring theme in our show,</p>
<p>and our show is optimistic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about woes to the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually about taking issues,</p>
<p>we take a topic each week that&rsquo;s in the news,</p>
<p>we go back to understand the history,</p>
<p>and we then use that history to make better policy,</p>
<p>to talk about how to make better policy today.</p>
<p>And in this case, it was clear that even in Germany,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of unfinished work in explaining to people</p>
<p>and helping those, for instance, in the former East,</p>
<p>where a lot of this group has its support,</p>
<p>why this government is legitimate,</p>
<p>why it operates the way it does,</p>
<p>and addressing their concerns.</p>
<p>It was strikingly similar to some of the problems</p>
<p>we have in our own society.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting that there&rsquo;s a far-right movement</p>
<p>in Germany, so you look at different parts of the world</p>
<p>as well, not just the United States.</p>
<p>We do, we did an episode recently on China,</p>
<p>on the effects of zero COVID and the protests in China.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done a number of episodes on the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Our role each week is to have on either a policymaker,</p>
<p>a scholar, or an activist,</p>
<p>who can help us understand an issue</p>
<p>and get beyond partisanship.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s been eye-opening are some of the details,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s also been eye-opening, honestly,</p>
<p>is how easy it is to have a non-partisan conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard.</p>
<p>We open every episode with a poem that Zachary writes.</p>
<p>He writes an original poem, I&rsquo;ll brag on my son,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the Youth Poet Laureate in Austin right now,</p>
<p>and he writes a poem on each topic.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the style of poetry, usually?</p>
<p>Is he dark, is he?</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s usually, he&rsquo;s often ironic.</p>
<p>Ironic, like with a bit of humor?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And he likes word plays.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not like a rebellious, dark teenager that&rsquo;s just?</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s a creative know-it-all.</p>
<p>Strong words, he would probably disagree.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting-</p>
<p>Sounds like you&rsquo;re the know-it-all on the podcast.</p>
<p>Oh no, we do have a lot of followers,</p>
<p>and most of them comment on him, they don&rsquo;t comment on me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m the junior partner.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the Yoko Ono of the partnership.</p>
<p>Correct, correct.</p>
<p>But what I will say, and this is a really optimistic thing</p>
<p>that I deeply believe, if you frame things properly,</p>
<p>you open with a poem, you open with questions,</p>
<p>not with partisan positions.</p>
<p>Even when we have someone on</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a known Republican or Democrat,</p>
<p>we can have a very non-partisan conversation.</p>
<p>I mean, of course, we get criticisms,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re almost never criticized</p>
<p>for being partisan one way or the other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to do this.</p>
<p>You just have to make an effort</p>
<p>to avoid the partisan claptrap that we can all fall into.</p>
<p>Focus on the humanity.</p>
<p>What has your brilliant, popular son, Zachary,</p>
<p>taught you about life?</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s taught me so much in his 18 years,</p>
<p>as has our daughter, who&rsquo;s 20.</p>
<p>Two things stand out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s taught me that a new generation has so much to offer.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t just mean because he&rsquo;s smart</p>
<p>and engaged, as our daughter is too.</p>
<p>I also mean that you realize when you have a child</p>
<p>that even though you&rsquo;re doing the same things with them,</p>
<p>they see the world differently and legitimately.</p>
<p>And it reminds us that the world</p>
<p>can be seen legitimately in different ways.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that he and I disagree</p>
<p>on major political issues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the small stuff that he sees differently.</p>
<p>Like in the details, you see that you can have</p>
<p>a very different perspectives.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You have a very different way to draw,</p>
<p>to create a painting of the same scene.</p>
<p>And then the other thing he&rsquo;s taught me is,</p>
<p>as I said about the poetry, the importance of the arts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a lover of the arts,</p>
<p>but it had always been, in some ways,</p>
<p>parallel to my historical scholarship.</p>
<p>We need to do a better job of integrating,</p>
<p>as the Greeks did, right?</p>
<p>The artistry, all the things we do,</p>
<p>we separate them as disciplines,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all deeply connected.</p>
<p>This is what I like about your podcast, honestly,</p>
<p>is that you integrate all these things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have people on with AI,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a guy doing arm wrestling,</p>
<p>you have all these things together, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that these worlds come together,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot to gain by bringing the arts</p>
<p>and the sciences and all this together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an obvious thing to say, but we forget.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it somehow becomes bigger</p>
<p>than the individual parts.</p>
<p>What gives you hope about the future?</p>
<p>You looked at, especially with this book,</p>
<p>at just such a divisive part of our history,</p>
<p>and the claim, the idea that you carry through the book,</p>
<p>that that division still permeates our society.</p>
<p>So what gives you hope?</p>
<p>I try to end the book on a very hopeful note,</p>
<p>because I am hopeful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful that these divisions were made by people</p>
<p>and can be unmade by people.</p>
<p>I do not believe that what I describe in this book,</p>
<p>the division, the hate that we see today, as well,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>I think it can be actually corrected quite easily,</p>
<p>and corrected easily by addressing the challenges</p>
<p>in our institutions, the ways in which this history</p>
<p>has been embodied in our institutions,</p>
<p>even though we&rsquo;re different,</p>
<p>and through our own recognizing of it.</p>
<p>The gift of the last few years,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care whether you&rsquo;re a Democrat or Republican,</p>
<p>the gift of the last few years</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ve been able to see the horror around us.</p>
<p>And once you see the horror, you can do something about it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s dangerous is when the horror is there</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t see it, and it&rsquo;s hidden.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been unmasked.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care where you stand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve probably spoken in about 25, 30 cities about this book.</p>
<p>Every audience I&rsquo;ve asked,</p>
<p>how many of you have been shaken by the last four</p>
<p>to five years, and everyone, everywhere</p>
<p>has raised their hand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a gift.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s consciousness raising.</p>
<p>I grew up in a time in the 1980s</p>
<p>when we were concerned everyone was apathetic.</p>
<p>That was what was being said.</p>
<p>We had lower voter turnout than we have now.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t seem to care.</p>
<p>My students, when I was a young professor,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still young,</p>
<p>I was a very young professor in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>My students all wanted to go work for banks.</p>
<p>They just wanted to make money.</p>
<p>The best students wanted to go work for Goldman.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not in that world anymore.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a consciousness raising.</p>
<p>Knowing there&rsquo;s a problem, naming the problem</p>
<p>gives us a chance to fix the problem.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where we are as a society now.</p>
<p>Young people are excited to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Do you think the individual,</p>
<p>like if a young person&rsquo;s listening to this,</p>
<p>do you think the individual has power in this?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think the individual has a huge amount of power now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a demographic reason.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got all these old people who have held on too long.</p>
<p>Look at president, look at senator, look at any institution.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all, we&rsquo;re reaching a demographic cliff.</p>
<p>Unlike China, we have a large population that&rsquo;s coming up.</p>
<p>So those who are watching now who are in their 20s,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna get to move into leadership positions</p>
<p>much faster than their parents did.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>And then the second thing is just what we&rsquo;re doing here.</p>
<p>I mean, social media, when used properly,</p>
<p>gives a platform to young people.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to go through the New York Times</p>
<p>like I do, right?</p>
<p>This is why I do the podcast with my son.</p>
<p>Find other ways.</p>
<p>You reach millions of people.</p>
<p>And this can be done.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to wait for the old guys</p>
<p>to give you the check mark that it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Just put on a suit, get a haircut,</p>
<p>and start speaking nonsense into a microphone</p>
<p>and yeah.</p>
<p>Well, also, I mean, have a very neat place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love you.</p>
<p>All right, Jeremy, you&rsquo;re an incredible human being.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking once more time.</p>
<p>Thank you for writing this important book.</p>
<p>I hope you keep writing.</p>
<p>And I hope to keep talking to you</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re the shining beacon</p>
<p>of political hope I have here in Austin</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll get to enjoy.</p>
<p>I wanna thank you for having me on</p>
<p>and thank you for your show.</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;re doing is so important</p>
<p>and I really deeply respect what you do.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Jeremy Suri.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>Nearly all men can stand adversity.</p>
<p>If you want to test a man&rsquo;s character, give him power.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
