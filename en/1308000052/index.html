    <p>Yesterday, the game went off the chain.</p>
<p>It was, it&rsquo;s, we started off at 500 and a thousand,</p>
<p>and then we were like, ah, these $500 chips are so annoying.</p>
<p>Then we started to play a thousand, a thousand.</p>
<p>Then it was a thousand, two thousand.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s a 1,000, 2,000, 4,000.</p>
<p>Then one, two, four, eight.</p>
<p>Then one, two, four, eight, 16.</p>
<p>One, two, four, eight, 16, 32,000 coming around.</p>
<p>Oh my God, how much did you lose?</p>
<p>What was the big winner and big loser?</p>
<p>How much?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say.</p>
<p>Just tell us how much.</p>
<p>Out 800.</p>
<p>I put minus 800, minus 700.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say these fucking names, bro.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you do Chamath?</p>
<p>I did okay.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh, he did okay.</p>
<p>You can tell that Chamath lost</p>
<p>because when you ask him, how&rsquo;d you do?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, just, he goes from this super effusive</p>
<p>talking about the game to just like one word, fine.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Fine, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, how was your night?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, look, I shit $42 million for breakfast.</p>
<p>It was fine.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Three, two.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let your winners hide.</p>

<p>Hey everybody, welcome to another episode</p>
<p>of the All In Podcast, 50 episodes down.</p>
<p>And yeah, we&rsquo;ll definitely get three or four more in</p>
<p>before the band breaks up with us today.</p>
<p>Again, from an undisclosed location,</p>
<p>David Saks, the Rain Man himself,</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya, the dictator,</p>
<p>and the Queen of Quinoa, David Friedberg.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s everybody doing?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s everybody feeling?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s week going?</p>
<p>Really great.</p>
<p>Yours?</p>
<p>Just great.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>I feel really good.</p>
<p>I feel super grateful.</p>
<p>Aw.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Right, your poker game last night?</p>
<p>Yeah, the stock market&rsquo;s up today.</p>
<p>He feels grateful.</p>
<p>I feel grateful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good week.</p>
<p>I feel so much equanimity.</p>
<p>Market&rsquo;s up 4%.</p>
<p>Friedberg, how are you doing?</p>
<p>My wife went to the hospital three times this week,</p>
<p>all three times thinking she was in labor.</p>
<p>Hey, bro, are you, how, I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re two centimeters dilated.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still waiting here.</p>
<p>I mean, nothing&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>We are there too.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just waiting any day,</p>
<p>like literally any hour.</p>
<p>So we were.</p>
<p>How do we get action on this?</p>
<p>Can we bet who&rsquo;s gonna come first or?</p>
<p>I think Friedberg&rsquo;s gonna come first</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s his third.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only Nat, it&rsquo;s Allison&rsquo;s third, it&rsquo;s Nat&rsquo;s second.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna lay odds, two to one, what do we get?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take the over-under on, what day is it today?</p>
<p>Today is the 15th.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting induced on the 26th.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 11 days from now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take the over-under on the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take the over-under on the 21st.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re setting the line?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll set the line at the 21st of October.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go over for a thou.</p>
<p>This is for Nat?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For Nat?</p>
<p>I got the over, you got the under.</p>
<p>What do you got, Zacks?</p>
<p>Over-under on the 21st.</p>
<p>26 is the expected date.</p>
<p>What are we betting on?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re betting on Nat.</p>
<p>Nat and Allison&rsquo;s due dates.</p>
<p>Some people pay attention when their children are born.</p>
<p>And when their children are born, shift.</p>
<p>Everybody get action.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you guys a little too old to be having kids?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, are you going to see them graduate?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>You got a vasectomy?</p>
<p>I mean, Zack, some of us are a whole bar mitzvah</p>
<p>younger than you.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So you snipped.</p>
<p>I would, if anybody was snipped,</p>
<p>I would guess it would be Zacks.</p>
<p>Are you, are you snippy snippy?</p>
<p>Is this the type of vital information</p>
<p>you think the audience wants to know?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they do, actually.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a yes.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s been snipped.</p>
<p>Chamath is definitely not snipped.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>You can, you can.</p>
<p>Friedberg&rsquo;s not snipped.</p>
<p>Do you want to come over here and inspect?</p>
<p>Do the procedure?</p>
<p>Conduct an inspection?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can visually understand that, Zack.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s, we gotta buzz this out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not go, it&rsquo;s not visually understandable.</p>
<p>Yeah, Friedberg&rsquo;s definitely not snipped</p>
<p>as proven by his wife being pregnant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you say snip, bro.</p>
<p>I think you just say vasectomy, though.</p>
<p>Ah, I&rsquo;m just, you know, I think you say snip snip.</p>
<p>I think Zack&rsquo;s has been snipped.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a good bet.</p>
<p>We could book it on Zack&rsquo;s being snipped.</p>
<p>Okay, listen, a lot of topics to get to.</p>
<p>I think we were trying to get to this topic last week.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a supply chain interruption right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some shortages, obviously,</p>
<p>of key components like microchips.</p>
<p>We all know this.</p>
<p>According to Car and Driver,</p>
<p>the top three models impacted by the chip shortage</p>
<p>were the Ford F-Series pickup trucks,</p>
<p>Jeep Cherokee SUVs, and the Chevy Equinox SUVs.</p>
<p>Basically, a lot of the cars</p>
<p>that have advanced driving systems are now removing them.</p>
<p>I was looking at getting an SUV for the winter,</p>
<p>and I was looking at the Cadillac Escalade,</p>
<p>and they took self-driving out of the 2022 model,</p>
<p>or the autopilot, basically,</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t get the chips.</p>
<p>And we all know why this is happening, obviously, COVID.</p>
<p>And then also on top of it, demand.</p>
<p>So people are buying second computers, third computers.</p>
<p>Places like Dell are having,</p>
<p>and Apple are selling a lot of desktops, a lot of laptops.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a labor shortage.</p>
<p>So the labor force, obviously, here in the United States</p>
<p>is much smaller than it was.</p>
<p>We all know that people are raising salaries</p>
<p>to try to get people to come back to work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re turning off the bonus unemployment</p>
<p>early in some states.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here in October.</p>
<p>This is all supposed to be turned off by now.</p>
<p>So I guess I&rsquo;ll start with you, Chamath,</p>
<p>in terms of the markets here.</p>
<p>What do you think is happening?</p>
<p>And is this an acute risk</p>
<p>or just something that will pass?</p>
<p>I think the, well, this is where I think</p>
<p>I kind of generally disagree with the market.</p>
<p>I think that most people are under the impression</p>
<p>that these are short-term</p>
<p>kind of contractions and expansions,</p>
<p>and that this is just a thing</p>
<p>that needs to get worked through the system</p>
<p>as we readjust to a post-COVID world, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>And the reason I think it&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>is if you just look at one thing and one thing only,</p>
<p>which is that we have a massive labor shortage in America,</p>
<p>and there is an incredible stat that I saw,</p>
<p>which was the average hourly earnings</p>
<p>of non-manager people in hospitality and travel.</p>
<p>And the average salary, the mean salary,</p>
<p>was around 20-some-odd dollars an hour,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s now 33 bucks an hour.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<p>And so what that, to me, says is that</p>
<p>we are going through a really sustained period</p>
<p>where you cannot get people to do the work</p>
<p>that needs to get done.</p>
<p>Biden had to call the Port of LA</p>
<p>and try to get these guys to be open 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>The President of the United States is calling a local port,</p>
<p>trying to get it to stay open.</p>
<p>But why can&rsquo;t they stay open?</p>
<p>Because you have longshoremen,</p>
<p>you have all these unionized folks</p>
<p>who will expect to get certain levels of compensation,</p>
<p>which they deserve, in order to do that work 24-7,</p>
<p>but then all of that is gonna get put through the system.</p>
<p>And if you still have millions of jobs</p>
<p>that needs to get done in order for the economy to function,</p>
<p>the only efficient way that that&rsquo;s gonna get resolved</p>
<p>is by raising salaries.</p>
<p>And those are consistent and persistent.</p>
<p>Those things are not just like, oh, you know what I gave?</p>
<p>Yes, I did say 50 bucks an hour,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m taking you back to 20.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can&rsquo;t take that back.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be, that&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>And then, so I tend to, so that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>And then second, so there&rsquo;s people, right?</p>
<p>So labor capital.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s getting more and more expensive</p>
<p>to get folks to do work.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the raw materials</p>
<p>that you use to make anything.</p>
<p>And everything that I see is that stuff is going bananas.</p>
<p>And so I put these two things together,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, I think this stuff is here to stay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really kind of a little bit of a, you know,</p>
<p>and I had not worried.</p>
<p>And you can see in every episode before this,</p>
<p>I was always consistently like, there is no inflation.</p>
<p>You can fade the inflation trade.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m kind of positioning myself</p>
<p>to hedge myself in this situation.</p>
<p>All right, Freeberg.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen the pictures of the Long Beach</p>
<p>and the Los Angeles ports.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just ships out there,</p>
<p>like I think 70 or 80 is where it peaked at in July.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, have the latest data here of when it updated.</p>
<p>But is there not a silver lining here</p>
<p>that if people are making more money,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re going to increase the size of the middle class</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to, you know, increase upward mobility.</p>
<p>And that is a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great that we increased the middle class,</p>
<p>but then they&rsquo;re going to want to buy stuff.</p>
<p>So if people are now making 35 bucks an hour</p>
<p>and they were making 20, now they got more disposable.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re going to go on Amazon and buy more stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to accelerate this problem, is it not?</p>
<p>The challenge is the rate of change.</p>
<p>This is what the Fed tries to manage.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s a White House</p>
<p>Economic Advisory Committee that&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>in trying to figure out what&rsquo;s going to happen here.</p>
<p>Because the current estimate is it&rsquo;s going to take</p>
<p>at least a year or probably a year to work</p>
<p>through the current log jam and the global supply chains.</p>
<p>And during that period of time, as Chamath points out,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is the cost for goods is climbing</p>
<p>because people have to charge more</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s limited inventory</p>
<p>and people are bidding up the value of that inventory.</p>
<p>As they do that, the businesses end up</p>
<p>needing to get more labor.</p>
<p>And so they have to pay more to hire people.</p>
<p>If they pay more to hire people,</p>
<p>those people end up demanding more.</p>
<p>And the cycle can actually go the wrong direction</p>
<p>where you have an inflationary spike that persists.</p>
<p>How do you taper that inflation?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily great for economic growth</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t produce the stuff.</p>
<p>And it can actually cause these runaway kind of effects</p>
<p>in the dynamic system of supply and demand</p>
<p>when you have these things clogging up the system for supply.</p>
<p>So it is a real risk.</p>
<p>And it is the biggest thing that the White House,</p>
<p>this economic task force is kind of trying</p>
<p>to figure out right now is where&rsquo;s the balance lie</p>
<p>where you can basically try and taper</p>
<p>this inflationary effect that&rsquo;s being caused</p>
<p>by this log jam in the supply chain</p>
<p>without causing economic disruption</p>
<p>by raising interest rates.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a really kind of complicated</p>
<p>second and third derivative formula</p>
<p>that needs to kind of be resolved.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why so many of these little elements</p>
<p>are so important to get right.</p>
<p>By the way, rates, by the way,</p>
<p>central bankers around the world have raised rates.</p>
<p>The only place that hasn&rsquo;t gone up is Europe,</p>
<p>ECB and the United States of Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>So, and let&rsquo;s be honest, Europe and the United States,</p>
<p>we absorb labor and materials from all around the world.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>We are the net importers.</p>
<p>We are the net ultimate buyers of last resort</p>
<p>of all of these things.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re seeing inflation</p>
<p>in those other supply driven economies,</p>
<p>they are gonna come on shore.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna hit us in the face.</p>
<p>I think prices are going up.</p>
<p>The other free market argument that could be made</p>
<p>is that these current trends will accelerate</p>
<p>a trend towards more automation of low cost labor</p>
<p>because it now will make sense for businesses</p>
<p>to invest in the capex, in the infrastructure</p>
<p>and ultimately for technology companies</p>
<p>to build that tooling to support that infrastructure</p>
<p>that will automate jobs like working in fast food,</p>
<p>like doing local delivery, like doing factory assembly,</p>
<p>like moving things across the country in trucks.</p>
<p>So self-driving trucks, factory automation,</p>
<p>biomanufacturing, additive and 3D manufacturing</p>
<p>and 3D printing.</p>
<p>These are all industries that could benefit</p>
<p>from the fact that labor now for kind of,</p>
<p>traditionally low income work has gotten so expensive</p>
<p>that it starts to make sense to switch</p>
<p>to the technology alternative,</p>
<p>which historically may have been too expensive,</p>
<p>but now starts to make economic sense to businesses.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a number of these automation industries</p>
<p>that may significantly benefit</p>
<p>and that ends up ultimately being deflationary</p>
<p>and the market comes into balance.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another way to kind of think about the macro</p>
<p>on what may play out here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bigger risk here than just inflation.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s also a risk of stagnation or stagflation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just that prices are going up</p>
<p>and workers wages are going up, which could be a good thing,</p>
<p>but the goods and services just aren&rsquo;t being produced.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I know like my own experience,</p>
<p>I recently ordered a Tesla.</p>
<p>When I got a Tesla a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>like I got it in two weeks, it was like almost instant.</p>
<p>This time they wanted me to wait two months</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got an alert that it&rsquo;s gonna take</p>
<p>two more months beyond that.</p>
<p>So we have no idea.</p>
<p>And if Tesla doesn&rsquo;t get most of the money, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>until I actually take delivery of the car, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you make final payment.</p>
<p>So now they can&rsquo;t book that revenue and those earnings.</p>
<p>And Tesla isn&rsquo;t even in the car company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s most affected by this,</p>
<p>the big traditional American auto companies like Ford</p>
<p>are even more affected.</p>
<p>So if companies cannot deliver their products,</p>
<p>that could cause an economic recession.</p>
<p>And I think like these are major storm clouds</p>
<p>looming on the horizon.</p>
<p>Now, what is the cause of this?</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s multifactorial.</p>
<p>A lot of the things that Chamath said,</p>
<p>I just wanna really highlight this port issue.</p>
<p>There was a great tweet storm by Zach Cantor</p>
<p>earlier in the week where he said,</p>
<p>the supply chain crisis is a clever rebrand</p>
<p>that makes it seem like there are grand exogenous forces</p>
<p>at work rather than the unions holding ports for ransom</p>
<p>while dozens of ships pile up,</p>
<p>working just two shifts with a two hour break</p>
<p>in between the country at their mercy.</p>
<p>And he goes on to elaborate on that.</p>
<p>And that is why, I mean, Chamath&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re allowed to do that.</p>
<p>But to Chamath&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>this is why Biden felt the need to get involved.</p>
<p>So the problem is if you read the fine print</p>
<p>on the story of Biden announcing</p>
<p>that the ports of LA and Long Beach will open 24 hours,</p>
<p>which they clearly need to to get the goods to market.</p>
<p>If you read the bottom part of the story,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s announcing their intention to go 24 seven,</p>
<p>but there is no date certain for when that&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a negotiation with the union.</p>
<p>So Chamath, to your point,</p>
<p>they are gonna have to negotiate with the unions.</p>
<p>Initially, it looked like the story</p>
<p>was that Biden was gonna use his sway,</p>
<p>his clout with the unions</p>
<p>to basically push them to take a deal.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s really done that.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s just announcing their intention to negotiate.</p>
<p>Well, if the ports are holding</p>
<p>the whole country hostage like this,</p>
<p>that could cause a recession.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s gonna rebound very badly on Biden.</p>
<p>Wait, hold on a second.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re running 24 seven now, aren&rsquo;t they, Sax?</p>
<p>Long Beach and LA are both running 24 seven.</p>
<p>Well, I just posted this article that came out,</p>
<p>I mean, like yesterday.</p>
<p>And it says, it was published two days ago.</p>
<p>And it said there was not a date certain for when this,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s updated October 14th, which is yesterday.</p>
<p>And if you read the bottom of the article,</p>
<p>it says they have not determined a date</p>
<p>for when 24 seven operations will start.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve just merely announced their intention.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I&rsquo;m just saying that the Biden administration</p>
<p>says it&rsquo;s not really,</p>
<p>they announced it as if it was a done done.</p>
<p>Look, unless Biden is willing to, listen,</p>
<p>I mean, Chamath, you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re entitled to negotiate.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re holding the whole country hostage now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re holding the economy hostage.</p>
<p>So at a certain point, if their demands are unreasonable,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I think proper for the president United States</p>
<p>to step in and say, guys, this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>You have to go back to work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna make,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna help negotiate a deal here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Reagan did with the air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>The air traffic controllers union</p>
<p>shut down the whole commercial aviation system.</p>
<p>Reagan got involved, said you cannot shut down</p>
<p>the economy this way.</p>
<p>You must go back to work.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So I think Biden is probably gonna have to get up for air.</p>
<p>Not that these longshoremen are, or the ports,</p>
<p>I guess they&rsquo;re not striking.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not doing an extra shift.</p>
<p>But he could do an executive order.</p>
<p>Look, if they&rsquo;re doing two shifts,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re doing two shifts, two hours a day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like withholding, that&rsquo;s like a partial strike.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, they&rsquo;re doing two, two hour shifts</p>
<p>or two, eight hours? That&rsquo;s what Zach Kanner was saying.</p>
<p>Eight hour shifts.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t be doing two hour shifts.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Why would anybody go to work for two hours?</p>
<p>Read what Zach Kanner posted.</p>
<p>He said that they&rsquo;re working just two shifts</p>
<p>with a two hour break in between.</p>
<p>Okay, but those might be two eight hour shifts</p>
<p>with a two hour break in between is how I read that.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>He says, read the tweet here.</p>
<p>He says, before any changes this coming week,</p>
<p>the longshore routine at the ports involve two shifts,</p>
<p>8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 3 a.m.</p>
<p>An overnight shift of five hours is available,</p>
<p>but is up to 50% more expensive and rarely used.</p>
<p>So basically you&rsquo;re talking about, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an eight to 4 p.m. shift with a two hour break</p>
<p>or 6 p.m. to 3 a.m.</p>
<p>So basically, yes.</p>
<p>So it is for that six hour, that&rsquo;s two six hour shifts.</p>
<p>They should be running it like, you know,</p>
<p>Elon runs the Tesla factories when they&rsquo;re building,</p>
<p>which is 24 hours a day, overlapping shifts.</p>
<p>Just get it done.</p>
<p>There has to be a sense of urgency here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to have to pay him some reasonable overtime,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t, the unions can&rsquo;t hold</p>
<p>the whole country hostage.</p>
<p>And look, if Biden, unless Biden steps in to solve this,</p>
<p>we will have a recession.</p>
<p>So it will rebound very bad.</p>
<p>Oh, so we do think that this could be a recession.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s bigger than just the ports.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think reopening the ports is the entirety of it.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of other things going on.</p>
<p>I mean, Jake, out to a point you&rsquo;ve made,</p>
<p>we had 4 million people drop out</p>
<p>of the labor force last month.</p>
<p>I mean, that was unbelievable.</p>
<p>So yeah, the unemployment rate looks great,</p>
<p>but the number of people actually going to work</p>
<p>is significantly lower.</p>
<p>I mean, that was a huge shock to all the economists</p>
<p>seeing that many people drop out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still too many people who essentially</p>
<p>are being paid not to work in one form or another,</p>
<p>and that is hurting the economy.</p>
<p>You also have this issue in China,</p>
<p>which is very interesting.</p>
<p>This was, I think, covered in the New York Times</p>
<p>about how dependent Chinese factories are on coal,</p>
<p>and which, you know, is a bad thing.</p>
<p>Obviously, that&rsquo;s not a clean energy source,</p>
<p>but because of restrictions on coal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually started to impact manufacturing over there.</p>
<p>We can debate whether that&rsquo;s a good thing or bad thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s contributing to the effect.</p>
<p>I suspect that China has woken up to this,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not going to shut down their economy</p>
<p>because of concerns about clean energy.</p>
<p>So I assume this is a very temporary decision.</p>
<p>And then, of course,</p>
<p>you have the whole issue of COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>I mean, there are a lot of international COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just in the US</p>
<p>where they were shutting down factories</p>
<p>or creating a lot of rules</p>
<p>that got in the way of keeping factories open.</p>
<p>They were doing this internationally,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of regulations around seafaring as well</p>
<p>because of COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>So you have this pile-up, I would say,</p>
<p>of regulations, ultimately,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say with COVID as the origin,</p>
<p>that have now caused this supply chain crisis.</p>
<p>And unless it gets fixed,</p>
<p>it could absolutely cause a 1970s-style</p>
<p>stagflation-type recession next year.</p>
<p>Chabot, do you buy that?</p>
<p>Do you think we could have this combination</p>
<p>of people refusing to go to work</p>
<p>or just opting out and saying like,</p>
<p>yeah, even if you pay me 35 or 40,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not interested.</p>
<p>I have enough NFTs, and I don&rsquo;t want to go back to work.</p>
<p>I actually think that&rsquo;s exactly what it is.</p>
<p>There was this really interesting tweet</p>
<p>that I saw on Twitter.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Nick, you can find it.</p>
<p>But it was some kid that basically said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m growing up in Atlanta,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a bunch of kids that I used to run with</p>
<p>who would otherwise be in the streets, right?</p>
<p>Causing all kinds of trouble.</p>
<p>And these kids are now at home,</p>
<p>like specking NFTs and posting on TikTok or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a completely different reimagination</p>
<p>of labor and time spent.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just a very small example.</p>
<p>And so that maybe touches retail</p>
<p>or maybe touches quick service restaurants.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s all these different things</p>
<p>where now that at the end of this pandemic,</p>
<p>people are making very different decisions</p>
<p>about their time and how to spend their money.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;ll tell you again, there is a lot of people.</p>
<p>You got to remember how many people in the United States</p>
<p>have died or are dealing now</p>
<p>with some reasonably important health issues</p>
<p>at the back end of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Half a million people, a million people.</p>
<p>I want you to keep in mind what I told you guys before.</p>
<p>There is 70 trillion dollars</p>
<p>that has to get transferred down</p>
<p>from all these baby boomers</p>
<p>down to these people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t think for a second</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not making different optimization decisions</p>
<p>around perceived wealth.</p>
<p>So I just think inflation is here.</p>
<p>I think the labor shortage is going to get worse, not better.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna have to pay people more</p>
<p>to get out of it.</p>
<p>I think prices are going up.</p>
<p>Input costs are going up.</p>
<p>Energy costs are going up.</p>
<p>So this is it.</p>
<p>And I think that probably the Fed and the ECB</p>
<p>are really raising this time next year.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably in a really, really tighter posture.</p>
<p>What do you think, Freeberg?</p>
<p>We should also remember</p>
<p>that there are going to be some responses from-</p>
<p>Sorry, Freeberg, last thing.</p>
<p>Tech stocks in the fucking toilet.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because of the multiples?</p>
<p>No bueno for no cash flow growth stocks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In rising-</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s going to start buying yield when-</p>
<p>Yucky poops.</p>
<p>Nobody wants it.</p>
<p>Yucky poops.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explain this to the audience.</p>
<p>Why, Freeberg?</p>
<p>Why are you agreeing with Jamal?</p>
<p>I mean, once interest rates go up,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that dividend yields will go up,</p>
<p>which means stock prices go down</p>
<p>because people will expect a higher return.</p>
<p>Because if I can buy treasury bonds</p>
<p>and make a few points of return on my money,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to have to buy a stock,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to demand a few more points</p>
<p>of dividend yield on that stock.</p>
<p>And so the price for stocks will typically go down</p>
<p>to match the yield that you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>from these more risk-free investments.</p>
<p>To be more precise.</p>
<p>A stock is either a promissory note about cash today,</p>
<p>or effectively a promissory note about cash in the future.</p>
<p>The thing with tech stocks</p>
<p>is we tell everybody the same thing.</p>
<p>Your money&rsquo;s going to come 30 years from now</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re going to be a monopoly by then.</p>
<p>And every dollar that I have today,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to reinvest into R&amp;D and engineering.</p>
<p>And in an environment where interest rates are zero,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re happy to do it because you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>well, great, these guys are investing</p>
<p>way better rates than zero,</p>
<p>which is what I get from my bank.</p>
<p>And so I want Facebook and Google and Amazon</p>
<p>and all these startups to be putting all this money</p>
<p>in the ground on my behalf.</p>
<p>But when interest rates start going up,</p>
<p>they say, no, hold on a second, I need more money upfront,</p>
<p>less money in the future</p>
<p>because the future becomes more uncertain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the big trade-off for tech companies</p>
<p>where they get really pummeled.</p>
<p>Okay, well, is there a number in terms of the interest rate?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a class of tech companies, right?</p>
<p>Sorry, like Microsoft, Oracle, Google,</p>
<p>where you are actually seeing an Apple,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting dividends and you&rsquo;re getting share buybacks</p>
<p>where the cash is coming out of the business.</p>
<p>And those are the mature businesses</p>
<p>that also still happen to have growth attached to them.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see how portfolios</p>
<p>are going to shed those assets.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to shed the more speculative,</p>
<p>hey, you know, we&rsquo;re not yet at a point of maturity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still 20, 30 years out, whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, the guys that are investing</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no kind of line of sight to true cashflow</p>
<p>coming back to the shareholders.</p>
<p>But look, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the point I was trying to make earlier</p>
<p>was that there is going to be a response, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve seen, remember when the pandemic kind of set in</p>
<p>and everyone started ordering from home,</p>
<p>Amazon rushed out and hired</p>
<p>100,000 local delivery drivers.</p>
<p>They bought all these trucks</p>
<p>and they built their own supply chain infrastructure</p>
<p>for last mile delivery to get products to people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re now seeing on the other side,</p>
<p>Walmart, Home Depot, Target, and other big retailers</p>
<p>integrating their supply chain to get product into stores.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re starting to buy trucks, hire people,</p>
<p>pay them significant wages to be drivers on staff for them,</p>
<p>rather than contracting to these third parties</p>
<p>that are saying, oh, we don&rsquo;t have any inventory.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any trucks.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any drivers.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do anything for you now.</p>
<p>And so the response is, think about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a product company, you&rsquo;re Tesla.</p>
<p>Tesla just went out and did this massive deal in Caledonia</p>
<p>to source some mineral that they need to make batteries</p>
<p>or to make their cars.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember exactly what it was.</p>
<p>Nickel.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re increasingly gonna see the businesses</p>
<p>that have a balance sheet step up</p>
<p>and actually start to integrate their supply chains</p>
<p>rather than have this-</p>
<p>Be full stack.</p>
<p>More resilient.</p>
<p>This disparate set of service providers,</p>
<p>each of which is only kind of,</p>
<p>is all typically operating at max capacity.</p>
<p>And then they can&rsquo;t kind of respond</p>
<p>to these sorts of jolts to the system.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re gonna see a lot of investment,</p>
<p>I think, by businesses that make product</p>
<p>or deliver product to the consumer</p>
<p>as they try and integrate</p>
<p>the supply chain problem themselves.</p>
<p>And that may take some of the strain off the system</p>
<p>and some of this inflationary risk out of the equation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see over the next couple of quarters.</p>
<p>But certainly in this last earnings report,</p>
<p>I saw some statistic,</p>
<p>a very large percentage of earnings reports</p>
<p>spoke directly about supply chain disruption</p>
<p>affecting the forecast for the business</p>
<p>and the ability for the business</p>
<p>to meet their forecast goals.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just hurting everyone.</p>
<p>Okay, so throwing to Sachs-</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re gonna have to do something about it</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re resourced to do it, right?</p>
<p>All right, so Sachs though,</p>
<p>there are some silver linings here.</p>
<p>Companies become more resilient.</p>
<p>They become more automated.</p>
<p>They build a full stack.</p>
<p>They build their own factories.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing the Taiwanese semiconductor company</p>
<p>is doing a $7 billion project</p>
<p>to build a new factory in Japan</p>
<p>funded by the Japanese government.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of redundancy</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re also seeing the middle class grow.</p>
<p>If people are making 35 bucks an hour,</p>
<p>40 bucks an hour,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting healthcare</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re starting to have overtime</p>
<p>and other concessions being made,</p>
<p>that builds the middle class.</p>
<p>It sounds like we&rsquo;re solving some problems as well.</p>
<p>Dealing with this,</p>
<p>I guess what you call indecision.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Inflation is a good thing.</p>
<p>I know people think it&rsquo;s a really bad, terrible thing.</p>
<p>There are certain kinds of inflation</p>
<p>that are really productive.</p>
<p>We have had to find a way to fight</p>
<p>the bad parts of technology.</p>
<p>Technology is great.</p>
<p>Nine out of 10 things, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Efficiency, all these great characteristics</p>
<p>that it gives you,</p>
<p>but one crappy externality of technology</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s deflationary.</p>
<p>You can do more with less</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s fundamentally not great for earnings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not great for labor participation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not great for all these things</p>
<p>that people are really upset about today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for the individual company,</p>
<p>getting those gains.</p>
<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>it actually balances out the natural pace of technology,</p>
<p>which is like you have the natural ability</p>
<p>to just actually have cheaper, faster, better.</p>
<p>This inherent efficiency</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s building up on one side of the ledger,</p>
<p>but then what&rsquo;s great is on the other side of the ledger,</p>
<p>you actually have labor being able to balance it out.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s a really good thing</p>
<p>because they can demand more to do the rest of the work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not covered by tech.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this expanding middle class?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it a great thing that people are saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stay home instead of making 12 bucks an hour.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unfair wage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a livable wage.</p>
<p>And then all of these companies are saying,</p>
<p>you know what?</p>
<p>Okay, they folded so quick, the big companies.</p>
<p>They went to 18 to $35 an hour instantly.</p>
<p>They always had the money to pay more.</p>
<p>They just didn&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>Increasing wages in real terms is a good thing.</p>
<p>I think you have to ask why the wages are going up.</p>
<p>Is it going up because of increased productivity,</p>
<p>which is a good thing,</p>
<p>or is it going up because of inflation?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s going up because of inflation,</p>
<p>then the wage gains are somewhat illusory</p>
<p>because all the products that consumers want to buy</p>
<p>are also going up in price.</p>
<p>All we&rsquo;ve done is sort of is devalue the dollar.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know yet whether these,</p>
<p>but we do know that inflation is actually very high.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly if these wage gains are permanent</p>
<p>or just a function of that.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go back to this inflation point for a second.</p>
<p>I think this is actually really important.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at something like a 5.1% inflation rate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just about the highest since the late 70s, early 80s.</p>
<p>Now we have this threat of a supply chain crisis.</p>
<p>This is, you know, this is potentially-</p>
<p>No, we have a supply chain crisis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a threat.</p>
<p>I mean, if people can&rsquo;t sell cars, it&rsquo;s a crisis.</p>
<p>Right, this is a recipe for stagflation 2.0.</p>
<p>Now, I think there&rsquo;s an assumption</p>
<p>that if inflation persists,</p>
<p>the Fed will simply just fight it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll increase interest rates somewhat</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll control it.</p>
<p>But I actually think that the degrees of action</p>
<p>that the Fed can take here might be more constrained</p>
<p>than people think.</p>
<p>I just want to flag.</p>
<p>So one of the primary sources I use for the national debt</p>
<p>is this website, fred.stlewisfed.org.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good website that has a lot of charts</p>
<p>by a branch of the Fed.</p>
<p>So they have this chart.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that federal debt as a percentage of GDP</p>
<p>is at sort of all time, peacetime highs.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re now, we were at 100% for a few years</p>
<p>and now because of COVID, we just rocketed up over 120%.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re close to 140%.</p>
<p>Now, the argument by mostly liberal economists</p>
<p>that the debt didn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>was because the debt service remained very low on this debt.</p>
<p>So we had a huge increase in debt,</p>
<p>but because interest rates were so low,</p>
<p>the debt service was still very, very small.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, they have a good piece</p>
<p>on this website about this as well</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll just post here in the notes.</p>
<p>But I think, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys remember</p>
<p>back to a pod we did in May,</p>
<p>where we talked about Stanley Druckenmiller</p>
<p>came out swinging against the Fed</p>
<p>and he warned about this very situation.</p>
<p>I just want to like, I want to just read this article</p>
<p>that we covered back, I think in May.</p>
<p>It feels like an eternity ago,</p>
<p>but do you remember when we just talked about this?</p>
<p>What Druckenmiller warned is that</p>
<p>if yields on the 10-year treasury</p>
<p>rise to the projected level of 4.9%,</p>
<p>which is simply the historical average,</p>
<p>the government spending would be close to 30% of GDP</p>
<p>each year, simply paying back interest expense</p>
<p>compared to 2% last year, unless it monetizes the debt,</p>
<p>which experts think is unlikely</p>
<p>and Druckenmiller believes would have</p>
<p>horrible implications for U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>So in other words, we now have this enormous debt.</p>
<p>The only reason why debt service payments</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t crowding out the entire federal budget</p>
<p>is because we&rsquo;ve had interest rates</p>
<p>at historically abnormal lows, zeros basically.</p>
<p>So how exactly is the Fed going to fight inflation?</p>
<p>If they jack up interest rates to where they should be,</p>
<p>say 4.9%, then the entire federal budget</p>
<p>will be going to debt service.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually working against themselves, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re the bank</p>
<p>and taking the loan at the same time.</p>
<p>This is like somebody who gets a variable interest mortgage</p>
<p>and they get five, 10 years into their mortgage</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden they go from interest only</p>
<p>and some low interest rate</p>
<p>and then they have to pay market rate</p>
<p>and they realize they can&rsquo;t afford the home.</p>
<p>We might not be able to afford the budget</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re putting out there is what you&rsquo;re saying, Sax.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m saying the Fed may not have the tools,</p>
<p>all the tools they want to fight inflation if it comes back.</p>
<p>Or I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna be politically very unpopular.</p>
<p>I mean, can you imagine the pressure the Fed will be under</p>
<p>not to raise rates if it means</p>
<p>that all of these discretionary programs</p>
<p>basically have to be cut,</p>
<p>that we have an austerity mode in the federal budget?</p>
<p>How are we gonna pay for all this debt service?</p>
<p>And then the first thing they&rsquo;re gonna think about is,</p>
<p>hey, maybe we should cut military spending</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s the largest at the time</p>
<p>when China is doing sorties in and around Taiwan</p>
<p>and the South China Sea</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got six navies doing coordinated sailing there,</p>
<p>which I think is a adjacent issue here.</p>
<p>Historically, historically great powers</p>
<p>that want to remain great</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t owe over 100% of their economy,</p>
<p>especially when a lot of it&rsquo;s held by foreign powers.</p>
<p>I mean, that is a situation that makes us fragile,</p>
<p>not anti-fragile, right?</p>
<p>Because if we hit a crisis,</p>
<p>if there is some unforeseen military conflict,</p>
<p>what glass do we break now in case of emergency?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already spent, we&rsquo;re already at,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in peacetime and we have wartime levels of debt.</p>
<p>And now inflation is making a return</p>
<p>and the Fed is gonna have to make some really tough choices</p>
<p>about whether to control inflation</p>
<p>and essentially impose austerity on government spending</p>
<p>or whether they monetize the debt,</p>
<p>which will lead to a runaway depreciation of the dollar.</p>
<p>Neither one of those things is a good situation.</p>
<p>How would the Fed impose austerity?</p>
<p>Well, they can&rsquo;t, but again,</p>
<p>if debt service rises to 30% of the federal budget,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s that money gonna come from?</p>
<p>You have to raise taxes and cut spending.</p>
<p>You got to do both.</p>
<p>Which is why, and I think this is Joe Manchin&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve been listening to Joe Manchin</p>
<p>talk about the current reconciliation bill</p>
<p>and he says, look, 3.5 trillion doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what situation</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna confront in the future.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what crises are coming.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna reduce our ability</p>
<p>to tackle all those future problems</p>
<p>by overspending right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been Joe Manchin&rsquo;s argument.</p>
<p>And looking at this risk of stagflation</p>
<p>in the forms of the supply chain shortage</p>
<p>and this 5.1% interest rate number,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to say that if we want to preserve</p>
<p>any flexibility next year to raise interest rates,</p>
<p>you better be really careful</p>
<p>about how much debt you incur now.</p>
<p>Jamal, agree, disagree?</p>
<p>Yeah, look, when Druk said that the 10-year break-even</p>
<p>was sort of at a five-year high at the time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re back there now.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m just gonna, I said this on CNBC,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say it again.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a short-term blip.</p>
<p>And I think that we are in a period</p>
<p>that will resemble the late 70s.</p>
<p>And I think that you kind of want to be risk-off</p>
<p>and not own risk assets.</p>
<p>And by the way, it is hard, okay?</p>
<p>Because we are all, all of us, all four of us,</p>
<p>both risk, we&rsquo;re both risk-on,</p>
<p>and all we own are risk assets that are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing to say, let&rsquo;s take risk,</p>
<p>but you could take risk in lower of all things.</p>
<p>This is like taking risk in the most risky thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we all do.</p>
<p>And at a time when people have run up the valuations</p>
<p>of private market companies to a level</p>
<p>that just nobody can understand.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I think you got a year to 18 months</p>
<p>to kind of clean this stuff up,</p>
<p>meaning like as market participants,</p>
<p>we can shuck and jive and get everything</p>
<p>into a decent place, but it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>And I hope I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;ll look back on this</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll say we said it probably eight to 12 months</p>
<p>before it really reared its ugly head, but it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>Freeberg, any thoughts on what&rsquo;s happening in Taiwan</p>
<p>and what, you know, even a modest conflict</p>
<p>there would do to markets,</p>
<p>given how to Sax&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>this is the opposite of anti-fragile.</p>
<p>We are in like full fragility here.</p>
<p>I mean, this is like, you know,</p>
<p>a tray full of champagne glasses on a boat in rough seas.</p>
<p>At any point we could trip and everything comes</p>
<p>crashing down.</p>
<p>Does it feel like that to you, Freeberg,</p>
<p>or do you feel like we&rsquo;re going to be able to navigate this?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know about Taiwan,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;re just going to keep inflating our way</p>
<p>out of this mess.</p>
<p>Remember, like that&rsquo;s what we did last year</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do again this year.</p>
<p>The biggest losers in that equation are the middle class</p>
<p>because, you know, the middle class actually owns assets</p>
<p>that are now going to be worth less.</p>
<p>Folks who are not in the middle class</p>
<p>that are below the middle class don&rsquo;t own assets,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t really affect them.</p>
<p>They just make higher wages, but stuff costs more,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>And then, you know, wealthy individuals</p>
<p>will end up getting taxed away to fund some of this.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the inevitable kind of way</p>
<p>that the equation balances.</p>
<p>Right, but I mean, think about how much tax rates</p>
<p>are about to go up right now in this reconciliation bill.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t even gotten to like any of these crises.</p>
<p>By the way, we don&rsquo;t know for sure if they&rsquo;re going to happen.</p>
<p>I think we could describe these things</p>
<p>as storm clouds right now that are very much on the horizon.</p>
<p>Multiple storm clouds, right?</p>
<p>Sort of like they&rsquo;re converging.</p>
<p>Right, and if they do materialize in the way</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about, what weapons will we have left</p>
<p>in order to fight them?</p>
<p>What weapons of fiscal policy?</p>
<p>What weapons of monetary policy?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already going to have taxes at an all-time high.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re going to have taxes.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re going to print money</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to pay ourselves.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go to the central bank.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what you said, we&rsquo;re going to monetize our debt.</p>
<p>And taxes will go up.</p>
<p>That is a disaster.</p>
<p>Remember, the top marginal tax rate was what?</p>
<p>70, 80% in the 60s and 70s?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s likely where we&rsquo;re going to go back to.</p>
<p>Well, I think we&rsquo;re already going to be back there</p>
<p>as a result of the reconciliation.</p>
<p>The spending we&rsquo;ve already done, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, so we&rsquo;ve already broken the glass</p>
<p>in case of emergency.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to see some of these wealth taxes</p>
<p>get chased down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to see the top marginal tax rate</p>
<p>go up 70, 80%.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the way the equation balances.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the world&rsquo;s going to end.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to solve it by taking assets away from some</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to inflate all assets.</p>
<p>That sounds pretty bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, 78, if you make a tax of 78%,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to affect most people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a solution, Freeberg.</p>
<p>It will affect most people.</p>
<p>It will affect most people,</p>
<p>even though they don&rsquo;t think it will</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to affect the quality of our economy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to predict what&rsquo;s going to happen, Sax.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is the solution to our problem.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the solution to our problem is technology,</p>
<p>but the question is, does that come to market fast enough?</p>
<p>Say more about that.</p>
<p>I feel like we need a deflationary set of technologies</p>
<p>that can mitigate all of these effects, right?</p>
<p>So software, automation, self-driving trucks,</p>
<p>things that take the labor force,</p>
<p>because people don&rsquo;t want to work low-income jobs, factually.</p>
<p>And now that there&rsquo;s a world,</p>
<p>now that there&rsquo;s, in America,</p>
<p>now that there&rsquo;s a world where people don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>where people have other options</p>
<p>because other jobs have been created</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve pumped so much money</p>
<p>into these other industries,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing people migrate away from low-income jobs.</p>
<p>Driving a truck for $10 an hour</p>
<p>or working at McDonald&rsquo;s for $8 an hour.</p>
<p>And so to fill that gap and avoid the economic collapse</p>
<p>that will occur in those sectors of the economy,</p>
<p>you need to automate and you need to find solutions</p>
<p>that can replace the labor</p>
<p>with some alternative technology solution</p>
<p>that actually allows the product to be fulfilled</p>
<p>to the consumers that demand it.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re going to see rates go up.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re going to be paying $12 for a hamburger</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to have to pay everyone $25</p>
<p>for working at McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Would an easy, or Chamath or Sax, either you can take it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re both going to have opinions here,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve been battling over immigration</p>
<p>and nobody even seems to understand</p>
<p>how many people are coming into the country</p>
<p>or under what system.</p>
<p>Should we not tie the number of jobs available,</p>
<p>you know, over the trailing X number of months,</p>
<p>years, quarters,</p>
<p>to how many people we&rsquo;re bringing to the country?</p>
<p>And couldn&rsquo;t we solve this by allowing 5 million people,</p>
<p>a million people, whatever it is,</p>
<p>per year, a half million people</p>
<p>in to take those low-income jobs</p>
<p>and utilize that group of people to, you know,</p>
<p>get businesses back on track?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s too convenient to say</p>
<p>that these are all low-income jobs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s necessarily true.</p>
<p>And I think that it then starts to introduce</p>
<p>a whole bunch of other constraints to the system.</p>
<p>These are folks that then need healthcare.</p>
<p>These are folks that need childcare.</p>
<p>These are folks that need, you know,</p>
<p>that they are also a tax on resources as well, right?</p>
<p>We are all taxed on the natural resources</p>
<p>and the infrastructure of our country.</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s the solution necessarily</p>
<p>to that specific problem.</p>
<p>So what if the jobs that were,</p>
<p>the people who are coming in-</p>
<p>We have enough people here to do the work.</p>
<p>But they won&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t have is the market clearing price</p>
<p>for that work to get done.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;m just trying to say is</p>
<p>I think that the simpler and more obvious solution</p>
<p>is to raise salaries until you get people</p>
<p>to fill these jobs.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And so I do think that over the next year or two or three,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna see, you know,</p>
<p>labor rates basically go back up</p>
<p>and employment rates go back down</p>
<p>and salaries go back up and inflation go back up.</p>
<p>All of these things are gonna happen together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the solution.</p>
<p>I think immigration is a solution</p>
<p>to a completely different problem.</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>Which is that we&rsquo;re not competitive.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve-</p>
<p>Oh, so you&rsquo;re talking about bringing an elite,</p>
<p>highly educated technical people.</p>
<p>Look, I really think that running a country</p>
<p>should really be like running a sports team.</p>
<p>You know, and-</p>
<p>Recruit the best talent, period.</p>
<p>And you should really be recruiting the best talent.</p>
<p>You should be looking at game film.</p>
<p>You should be coming up with plays.</p>
<p>You should be running and testing those plays.</p>
<p>You know, you should have different plays</p>
<p>that you run in the first quarter</p>
<p>versus the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Different plays when you&rsquo;re on the goal line.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You know, and I think that like,</p>
<p>when you look at professional sports,</p>
<p>one thing is that they don&rsquo;t see color,</p>
<p>gender, sexual orientation.</p>
<p>They see ability to be performant.</p>
<p>Statistics.</p>
<p>At a task and statistical excellence.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then they go seek statistical excellence.</p>
<p>And if you translate that to a country,</p>
<p>my simple rubric on immigration is every year,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a draft.</p>
<p>And America is the free place</p>
<p>every free agent wants to go.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the Yankees.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re the Warriors.</p>
<p>I fuck the Yankees.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like the Warriors.</p>
<p>The Yankees are trash.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going with who historically has won the most.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re the Chicago Bulls.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the, you know,</p>
<p>we are the team that everybody would want to play for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to us to have a good GM</p>
<p>and a good president of the team</p>
<p>and a good front office</p>
<p>that just picks off all these smart geniuses.</p>
<p>This should be,</p>
<p>I think your great point here, Chamath,</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re saying let&rsquo;s take the emotion</p>
<p>out of this immigration</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s make it a point-based system,</p>
<p>which by the way,</p>
<p>the point-based system is what Australia, New Zealand,</p>
<p>the UK, Canada all do.</p>
<p>And Americans don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what the point-based system is.</p>
<p>Sax, what are your views</p>
<p>as somebody who I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>leans a little bit to the right</p>
<p>on opening up immigration</p>
<p>or maybe sweeping all this amazing talent globally</p>
<p>who have the highest statistics?</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>I like Chamath&rsquo;s sports team analogy.</p>
<p>We want to get the biggest stars</p>
<p>from all over the world to come to the US.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that makes sense.</p>
<p>I think, you know,</p>
<p>this so-called immigration issue</p>
<p>gets so confused with so many different things.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s immigration</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s border security, right?</p>
<p>And immigration or just having a border period.</p>
<p>And so many people think that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re pro-immigration,</p>
<p>you basically can&rsquo;t have a border.</p>
<p>I mean, that makes no sense.</p>
<p>You know, we need to have a border</p>
<p>and we need to have actual,</p>
<p>like have an actual immigration policy.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t just be like,</p>
<p>okay, you make it across.</p>
<p>I like what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>If you were president</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re a guy Ron DeSantis becomes president,</p>
<p>what should his,</p>
<p>what will you tell Ron</p>
<p>since you&rsquo;re holding a fundraiser?</p>
<p>I like what you&rsquo;re saying with the point system,</p>
<p>having it be skills-based.</p>
<p>I mean, that makes sense, right?</p>
<p>Would the Republicans do that?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been so emotionally tied to this issue</p>
<p>because of Trump.</p>
<p>Can they actually,</p>
<p>tie themselves to something performance-based</p>
<p>and be not emotional about it?</p>
<p>Can they change their position?</p>
<p>I think Trump actually did endorse</p>
<p>like a more skills-based immigration system.</p>
<p>I think that,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know that Republicans</p>
<p>are the ones being emotional about it.</p>
<p>I mean, the people who are here-</p>
<p>Well, no, both sides are clearly</p>
<p>super emotional about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the side that I think is like insane</p>
<p>are the people who don&rsquo;t think we need a border.</p>
<p>I mean, you clearly have to have a border.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And even Obama came out recently</p>
<p>and made a statement that you have to have a border</p>
<p>because the progressive left had gone so far.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like they wanted to be,</p>
<p>whatever Trump was doing,</p>
<p>they wanted to do the opposite of.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like pull the 180.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s almost like the Biden administration policy</p>
<p>became to stop doing whatever it was that Trump was doing,</p>
<p>including finishing the wall.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really understand why that was like such a problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, building a wall also seemed like ridiculous.</p>
<p>We could just put up fences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one piece.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one piece of the solution,</p>
<p>but to stop it in mid construction.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>It broke this week that you&rsquo;re hosting</p>
<p>a fundraiser for Ron DeSantis.</p>
<p>You got a little bit of blowback from that,</p>
<p>from the woke, you know, in the San Francisco crowd.</p>
<p>But in terms of your influence with somebody like that,</p>
<p>do you think you can actually influence them</p>
<p>to get Ron DeSantis to listen to this episode</p>
<p>and maybe talk about the point based system</p>
<p>and change the framing of that?</p>
<p>Do you think you have enough influence to do that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what his position</p>
<p>on immigration is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not like the set of issues</p>
<p>that I respect him for.</p>
<p>I mean, the reason why I wanted to support DeSantis</p>
<p>is that he was the first governor</p>
<p>to end these insane lockdowns.</p>
<p>And I mean, this was back in,</p>
<p>it should have been obvious to everybody by May of 2020</p>
<p>that the lockdowns didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And he was the first one to roll them back.</p>
<p>And Florida did very well,</p>
<p>especially considering that they have</p>
<p>so many old people in Florida.</p>
<p>So, you know, on the whole,</p>
<p>not what I have done everything exactly the way he did it.</p>
<p>No, you know, but-</p>
<p>Nobody did it perfect.</p>
<p>But is he a Trump supporter and a Trump acolyte,</p>
<p>or is he distancing himself from Trump?</p>
<p>I think, honestly, I think that like point of view</p>
<p>is coming from the point of view of somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not in the Republican Party.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to deal with the dynamics</p>
<p>of winning support in the Republican Party.</p>
<p>No, no, no, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you have to basically toe the line</p>
<p>with Trump to get the nomination.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it as toeing the line.</p>
<p>I just think, look, I think he&rsquo;s his own person.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the governor of Florida.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s setting policy over there.</p>
<p>He can be supported or not</p>
<p>based on what he&rsquo;s doing in Florida.</p>
<p>I think like Trump is the issue</p>
<p>that everybody on the other side will want to talk about,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s relevant to what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s relevant to what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>But wait, isn&rsquo;t there a civil war</p>
<p>inside of the Republican Party over this?</p>
<p>And should we support Trump?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a civil war,</p>
<p>but there definitely is some conflict.</p>
<p>And yeah, I mean, look-</p>
<p>How does it resolve?</p>
<p>I hope it resolves in,</p>
<p>oh, look, I think elections are always about the future.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people want to relitigate the past.</p>
<p>And I think that the Republican Party would be wise,</p>
<p>I think, to find a candidate of the future</p>
<p>and not try to rehash or relitigate the past.</p>
<p>Another good reason for me to support DeSantis,</p>
<p>I think he is a future-looking, future-oriented candidate.</p>
<p>I do think that, look, I&rsquo;ll say it,</p>
<p>the stuff I hear Trump doing now in these speeches</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s relitigating what happened last year</p>
<p>and attacking other Republicans like McConnell</p>
<p>because they failed his personal loyalty test,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit like what he did, frankly,</p>
<p>in Georgia with the runoffs,</p>
<p>where he sowed so much chaos</p>
<p>that the Republicans lost a seat, the Perdue seat,</p>
<p>that they had won on election night</p>
<p>and then they had that runoff.</p>
<p>And you have to say that a huge part of the reason for that</p>
<p>was Trump attacking Rafflesberger and all the Georgia GOP</p>
<p>because he thought they were insufficiently loyal to him.</p>
<p>And then you had the tape come out of,</p>
<p>can you just find the 11,000 votes?</p>
<p>I mean, I think voters in Georgia</p>
<p>punished the Republican Party for that</p>
<p>by giving that seat to the Democrats.</p>
<p>That margin created the Democratic majority,</p>
<p>which will now give us probably an incremental</p>
<p>four to six trillion of spending and tax increases</p>
<p>that we wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have had.</p>
<p>So I do think these elections are very important</p>
<p>and it would behoove the Republicans.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m not like one of these never-Trumper people who,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not obsessed with Trump, period.</p>
<p>I just think the Republicans need to run</p>
<p>a future-looking candidate,</p>
<p>not a backwards-looking candidate in 2024.</p>
<p>And I think DeSantis could be that guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very early to say.</p>
<p>I mean, the first thing he has to do is run for governor,</p>
<p>for re-election, which I think is next year, is 2022.</p>
<p>So I will support him for that.</p>
<p>Did you guys, anybody read the Ted Sarandos memo?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is great.</p>
<p>They should definitely jump into this.</p>
<p>We talked about the Chappelle performance,</p>
<p>Sachs and Freeberg.</p>
<p>You guys watched it?</p>
<p>You hadn&rsquo;t seen it, did you watch it?</p>
<p>Yeah, did you watch it?</p>
<p>Oh God, what nerd.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t watched it yet?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>You guys are culturally bankrupt.</p>
<p>What were you guys doing this week?</p>
<p>Like fucking beakers and like, you know,</p>
<p>Sachs, you were just like-</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Were you like in like some laboratory</p>
<p>doing like Sachs testing?</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re beakers.</p>
<p>They were doing their beakers.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched it yet,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t need to watch it to know I support it.</p>
<p>Ah, he&rsquo;s just, yeah, he doesn&rsquo;t have to click on the link.</p>
<p>All right, so just-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost nothing Chappelle could say</p>
<p>to make me want to cancel him.</p>
<p>I mean, and by the way, I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of Chappelle</p>
<p>and I love Chappelle.</p>
<p>So I think I understand the gist of what he was doing,</p>
<p>but I do need to see it still.</p>
<p>But look, he should not be canceled, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to survive.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Well, this goes beyond this.</p>
<p>Let me read you from it.</p>
<p>So everybody knows the name of the special he did</p>
<p>was The Closer.</p>
<p>It was released on October 5th.</p>
<p>A lot of outcry from GLAAD and advocacy groups</p>
<p>and actually people inside of Netflix.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been some resignations.</p>
<p>There have been some people who contribute content</p>
<p>to Netflix who are now saying</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll not work with the company.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Ted Sorrento sent a memo to the entire company on Monday</p>
<p>and this is the second one he sent.</p>
<p>And he says,</p>
<p>we know that a number of you have been left angry,</p>
<p>disappointed and hurt by our decision</p>
<p>to put Dave Chappelle&rsquo;s latest special on Netflix.</p>
<p>Very interesting opening.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s addressing their feelings.</p>
<p>This is a masterclass in a memo</p>
<p>because in that first part, he just addresses,</p>
<p>I understand you feel that way.</p>
<p>With The Closer, we understand that the concern</p>
<p>is not about offensive to some content,</p>
<p>but titles which could increase real world harm.</p>
<p>So now he&rsquo;s framing their argument</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s not because it&rsquo;s offensive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of real world harm.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve brought this up before Saks,</p>
<p>the real world harm concept with Apple and Antonio.</p>
<p>While some employees disagree,</p>
<p>we have a strong belief that content on screen</p>
<p>does not directly translate into real world harm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly true.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into that.</p>
<p>The strongest evidence to support this</p>
<p>is that violence on screens has grown hugely</p>
<p>over the last 30 years,</p>
<p>especially with first party shooter games.</p>
<p>And yet violent crime has fallen significantly</p>
<p>in many countries.</p>
<p>And so he goes above and beyond</p>
<p>just talking about offensive material.</p>
<p>Adults can watch violence, assault and abuse,</p>
<p>or enjoy shocking standup comedy</p>
<p>without it causing them to harm others.</p>
<p>Standup comedians often expose issues that are uncomfortable</p>
<p>because the art by nature is highly provocative.</p>
<p>As a leadership team, we do not believe</p>
<p>that The Closer is intended to incite hatred or violence</p>
<p>against anyone per our sensitive content guidelines.</p>
<p>So basically he says,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t like it, change the channel.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a customer, you can cancel your subscription.</p>
<p>Or if you work here and you don&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to work here.</p>
<p>But is this the end of cancel culture?</p>
<p>This combined with Brian Armstrong&rsquo;s positioning?</p>
<p>Sax, this is your-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the end of it for the simple reason.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that this comic</p>
<p>had not signed a $60 million deal with Netflix.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say he had signed a $60,000 deal, okay?</p>
<p>Or 6 million, yeah.</p>
<p>Or 6 million or whatever.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t have the legions of fans</p>
<p>that Dave Chappelle had.</p>
<p>Do you think that Sarandos would be making</p>
<p>the same decision?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that special by a Netflix comedy</p>
<p>by Dave Smith would be swept under the rug right now.</p>
<p>That would never see the light of day.</p>
<p>I think the same thing was true</p>
<p>with Joe Rogan and Spotify, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Spotify made a $60 million deal with Rogan.</p>
<p>100 million.</p>
<p>Oh, 100 million.</p>
<p>The employees all protested</p>
<p>and Spotify stood tall for Rogan.</p>
<p>But they had every economic incentive to do so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t completely trust these companies</p>
<p>that if it wasn&rsquo;t massively in their bottom line interest,</p>
<p>that they would have stood up for free speech.</p>
<p>I suspect that if it was, you know.</p>
<p>They would not have.</p>
<p>They would not have.</p>
<p>I think we all kind of know that.</p>
<p>He said in the email,</p>
<p>Sticks and Stones is one of the most watched,</p>
<p>you know, pieces of content we have.</p>
<p>And this, The Closer, was like top four or five in America</p>
<p>over like the last few weeks.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a huge economic incentive.</p>
<p>And Reed Hastings said the same thing</p>
<p>when he posted the other co-CEO</p>
<p>into a group forum, which said,</p>
<p>listen, our job is to please our customers.</p>
<p>And all this data says is that we&rsquo;ve pleased our customer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think in the case of-</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That is pretty-</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they said.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s him putting his foot down</p>
<p>and saying we&rsquo;re going to make the content we want to make.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a principle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a super,</p>
<p>look, I don&rsquo;t want to look past it</p>
<p>because I think that it&rsquo;s so rare</p>
<p>to get a memo like Sarandos wrote</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s defending artistic freedom</p>
<p>or freedom of speech or what have you.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so rare to ever see that</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t want to gainsay it too much.</p>
<p>But I also do believe that this sort of special treatment</p>
<p>is really reserved for the artists, the creators,</p>
<p>like a Chappelle, like a Rogan.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically too big to cancel.</p>
<p>I mean, these companies have spent too much money</p>
<p>on their programs to just summarily cancel them.</p>
<p>They also, again, like I said,</p>
<p>have legions of fans who would rise up</p>
<p>and protest if they were canceled.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think these companies</p>
<p>would make the same decision for the mid-level creator.</p>
<p>And in a sense, Rogan and Chappelle,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re post-economic, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve made so much money</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re free to do what they want</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got a big enough audience</p>
<p>to protect themselves from these companies.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the little creator who&rsquo;s still on their way up</p>
<p>who can never take the kinds of creative risks</p>
<p>that Chappelle is taking or that Rogan&rsquo;s taking.</p>
<p>Well, they can take it.</p>
<p>They just can&rsquo;t do it on Netflix.</p>
<p>The tone of this, to me, sounded like a manifesto</p>
<p>and the end of the discussion from dad.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like it, get off the ship.</p>
<p>But this is the way the ship is going.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I read it.</p>
<p>And I think Spotify did a similar thing</p>
<p>with Joe Rogan, to your point,</p>
<p>which was, hey, listen, there was some content out there</p>
<p>from like Alex Jones or some people</p>
<p>who are just conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>They took down those episodes.</p>
<p>And Joe Rogan was like, I don&rsquo;t care, I got paid.</p>
<p>But yeah, it does feel to me like this is a tipping point</p>
<p>when you put Brian Armstrong, Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>and Chappelle together that corporations are gonna say,</p>
<p>you know what, the mob is fine.</p>
<p>You can have your opinion,</p>
<p>but your opinion stops where we have to run a business.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>I think Netflix has a appreciation for artistry,</p>
<p>certainly evident by the money they&rsquo;ve spent</p>
<p>and the product they&rsquo;ve put out.</p>
<p>And I think good artists and good artistry</p>
<p>can be provocative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to make you change your opinion,</p>
<p>look at things differently, think about things differently</p>
<p>and be challenged in the norms of your everyday life.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s important in art in all forms.</p>
<p>And that means seeing and being exposed to</p>
<p>and being engaged by things</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t normally get exposed to and engaged by.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what Chappelle is fantastic at.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what other great art is great at.</p>
<p>And I think that as long as Netflix maintains that ethos,</p>
<p>that artistry does that,</p>
<p>and the good thing is people appreciate it.</p>
<p>And they appreciate that form</p>
<p>and they appreciate being challenged in that way.</p>
<p>And I think that as a result,</p>
<p>the market will, as Reed Hastings identified,</p>
<p>continue to demand it.</p>
<p>And as much as some people might be offended,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fact that it is offensive</p>
<p>that I think makes it good.</p>
<p>So let me ask you-</p>
<p>And I think that they appreciate that.</p>
<p>Hold on, let me clarify.</p>
<p>Michael, I hope you&rsquo;re right about what this means.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, let me be really clear.</p>
<p>I mean, I hope it goes down</p>
<p>exactly the way that you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>because that is what I want to believe is happening.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit skeptical</p>
<p>that this is a little bit more of a bottom line motive</p>
<p>because they got so much money at stake</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t afford to cancel Chappelle.</p>
<p>But I hope you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re right that it&rsquo;s a statement of principle,</p>
<p>and they will apply that principle to lesser known artists</p>
<p>who can&rsquo;t protect themselves as much.</p>
<p>And, you know, hopefully this is kind of like,</p>
<p>you know, what it reminds me of is the Jon Stewart lab,</p>
<p>the Wuhan lab leak moment,</p>
<p>where you had Jon Stewart go on Colbert&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p>And he, all of a sudden, he made it okay</p>
<p>to talk about the lab leak theory.</p>
<p>It was like, you couldn&rsquo;t talk about it before.</p>
<p>He cracked the Overton window open.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And so hopefully Chappelle will do that</p>
<p>for this like woke cancellation mob</p>
<p>is to finally get everybody to realize,</p>
<p>oh, like we can stand up to this.</p>
<p>Chamath is the Overton window on a go forward basis.</p>
<p>Do you see it closing more,</p>
<p>staying where it is, or perhaps even opening?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really great philosopher.</p>
<p>This is my, maybe my one and only</p>
<p>grand tribute to Peter Thiel,</p>
<p>but he is a huge supporter</p>
<p>of a philosopher named Rene Girard.</p>
<p>And I agree with a lot of that.</p>
<p>A lot of Rene Girard&rsquo;s philosophies.</p>
<p>And basically it&rsquo;s called mimetic theory.</p>
<p>And the idea is you&rsquo;re born without preferences,</p>
<p>and then you kind of just copy what&rsquo;s around you.</p>
<p>And so what the other person wants is what you want.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what ultimately leads to a lot of conflict.</p>
<p>And the only way to resolve conflict</p>
<p>is with a huge grand sacrifice of some kind, okay?</p>
<p>And if you think about it here,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to really put, you know, cancel culture,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna kill it,</p>
<p>there needs to be some just massive escalation</p>
<p>and conflict around this idea</p>
<p>that allows us to resolve it in one way or the other,</p>
<p>in one direction or the other.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think this is it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not big enough, quite honestly.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little bit sort of like, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s folks like us that love comedy,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re willing to keep it in a very strict box,</p>
<p>which is let people say what they&rsquo;re gonna say,</p>
<p>be shocked with it, and don&rsquo;t take it onto yourself,</p>
<p>and go and reflect it into the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s entertainment, and you can, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I choose not to watch violent stuff,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>I find it very offensive.</p>
<p>Or, you know, I don&rsquo;t play first person shooters.</p>
<p>I find it really unsettling.</p>
<p>You know, Grand Theft Auto, I found it really outrageous.</p>
<p>And other people will feel like that about Chappelle.</p>
<p>My whole thing is we should all be allowed</p>
<p>to make those judgments,</p>
<p>because I think we&rsquo;re all still pretty rational people</p>
<p>at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I think, in the normal world.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t the thing that&rsquo;s gonna get</p>
<p>this issue to be resolved.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how it comes.</p>
<p>There needs to be some huge escalation around this thing.</p>
<p>I suspect what happens is it actually</p>
<p>just dissipates and goes away.</p>
<p>And the reason is because everybody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s much younger than us has such a huge</p>
<p>digital footprint that they&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>through their whole lives.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re at risk.</p>
<p>There is so much shit that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>Oh, God, yes.</p>
<p>That they just have no choice</p>
<p>but to let everybody else off the hook.</p>
<p>We are in a very different situation</p>
<p>because we were doing some fucking shady stuff,</p>
<p>always on the down low, always hidden.</p>
<p>Whoa, easy there.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how it was.</p>
<p>Our childhoods were largely anonymous.</p>
<p>You would roll deep and you would just,</p>
<p>you would pretend, you would not, you know.</p>
<p>And now the culture is very different.</p>
<p>And I think with that comes a lot of acceptance.</p>
<p>Every, you know, every kid at some point</p>
<p>may or may not be on Tinder, Bumble, Ria,</p>
<p>you know, Grindr, whatever.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be a body of that content that&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p>Every kid will have said something crazy,</p>
<p>you know, on TikTok.</p>
<p>And all of this stuff will be there.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ll have a choice,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re going to hold me accountable,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to hold you accountable.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s mutually assured destruction.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what causes</p>
<p>cancel culture to go away in time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the last vestige of very guilty people</p>
<p>of our generation.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>What do you think, Freeberg?</p>
<p>Is the Overton window opening, closing,</p>
<p>or about the same over the next year?</p>
<p>What Timoth is saying is right.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve referred to this book</p>
<p>called The Light of Other Days before when we talked.</p>
<p>I think so, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The book is like all about this notion</p>
<p>of all information is available to everyone everywhere</p>
<p>and societal norms completely change.</p>
<p>People no longer find things offensive</p>
<p>and they no longer,</p>
<p>and everyone basically shifts to a mode</p>
<p>of much more kind of open dialogue</p>
<p>because, you know, keeping things behind closed doors</p>
<p>and then positioning one person against the other</p>
<p>completely changes when you can see everyone&rsquo;s cards</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>And so I think, yeah, generally we&rsquo;re headed that way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>information wants to be free.</p>
<p>More information is being generated</p>
<p>about each of us all the time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re headed in the opposite direction</p>
<p>kind of back to a Victorian era.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going in the other way.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be blips and starts</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll kind of be setbacks on that general trajectory.</p>
<p>So yeah, I do think it&rsquo;s a moment, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a moment in time right now where this is happening.</p>
<p>I mean, Saxon,</p>
<p>if you look at the two examples we&rsquo;ve discussed,</p>
<p>Brian Armstrong and Coinbase,</p>
<p>that was about essentially Black Lives Matters</p>
<p>and talking about social justice at work.</p>
<p>And this one is about trans and trans rights.</p>
<p>And essentially, I don&rsquo;t want to say poking fun at</p>
<p>or, you know, discussing,</p>
<p>I mean, he basically says in it that he&rsquo;s team Terp.</p>
<p>If you were to take two organizations</p>
<p>that standing up against</p>
<p>would be the most challenging and difficult,</p>
<p>I think those are the top two.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>I guess so.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think this is the most telling</p>
<p>is that you have two different organizations saying,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re going to put our foot down.</p>
<p>Just for background, Netflix had a very strange,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see the actual film,</p>
<p>so I won&rsquo;t make judgment on it,</p>
<p>but it was a very strange trailer for a film called Cuties,</p>
<p>which was really over-sexualizing young girls,</p>
<p>like eight, nine, 10-year-old girls.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t take it down in the United States, Netflix,</p>
<p>but they did take it down-</p>
<p>It was in France, it was in France.</p>
<p>It was a French movie.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a French movie.</p>
<p>And they have a different view of kids and sexuality.</p>
<p>And yeah, I think people found it a little dark</p>
<p>here in the United States,</p>
<p>but they survived that one as well,</p>
<p>or they weathered that one as well.</p>
<p>So I think what people are finding is</p>
<p>if you put your foot down at a certain point-</p>
<p>I think what Saksis says is right,</p>
<p>these guys have realized that</p>
<p>if we have this very specific message</p>
<p>around artistic freedom and we never violate it,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s one of those things where</p>
<p>if you take that hill, you have to be there forever, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have asterisks around that idea.</p>
<p>But by doing that, they basically dominate</p>
<p>the content production game in Hollywood,</p>
<p>which then allows them to field the most content</p>
<p>at the cheapest average price,</p>
<p>which then makes churn less and customer acquisition higher.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re already the largest media company in the world,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re only going to get bigger.</p>
<p>And Netflix has, what, 200 million subscribers?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to get to a billion subscribers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just inevitable.</p>
<p>And so for them, I do think it&rsquo;s a very rational</p>
<p>business position to take,</p>
<p>which is that I have to appeal to a billion people</p>
<p>over the next seven or eight years.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to watch everything on Netflix.</p>
<p>You do not have to listen to every album.</p>
<p>Netflix is a fucking mess.</p>
<p>I mean, if they should spend 10 minutes</p>
<p>and improve the UI so you can actually find something,</p>
<p>my God, it&rsquo;s so bad.</p>
<p>And, you know, he basically, Sarandos,</p>
<p>made the point that, you know,</p>
<p>along with Chappelle&rsquo;s show,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re funding a ton of content by people of color,</p>
<p>probably more than anybody, and trans people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big focus of what they&rsquo;re doing at Netflix.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s essentially,</p>
<p>to Sax&rsquo;s point, more speech is better than less.</p>
<p>All right, do we want to go tether?</p>
<p>FDA, chaos, or questions?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you take,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you do your reverse victory lap?</p>
<p>Because after all your shit copy-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a victory lap for me, Bob.</p>
<p>Bro, it was the exact opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fraud.</p>
<p>It is not a fraud.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fucking fraud.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Can you please stop saying that?</p>
<p>Apparently the CFTC went in, did the work,</p>
<p>and is actually now refuting</p>
<p>what you thought was the case, Jason.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t you just own that?</p>
<p>How about I read you the quote?</p>
<p>From at least June 1st, 2016 to February 25th, 2019,</p>
<p>tether misrepresented to customers and the market</p>
<p>that tether maintains sufficient US dollar reserves</p>
<p>to back every USDT in circulation</p>
<p>with the equivalent amount</p>
<p>of corresponding fiat currency held by tether</p>
<p>and safely deposited in tether bank accounts.</p>
<p>In other words, they told everybody they were one for one.</p>
<p>They were not.</p>
<p>They lied to the public.</p>
<p>What were they, Jason?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re getting a $41 million fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re banned from New York.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re banned from trading in Canada.</p>
<p>I think, and they&rsquo;re supposedly a Department of Justice.</p>
<p>These guys are shady as F.</p>
<p>AF, shady AF.</p>
<p>Mark, do you have an economic interest in tether?</p>
<p>In crypto, he does.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>How can anyone have an economic interest in tether?</p>
<p>All it is is a one-for-one tokenized dollar.</p>
<p>Well, no, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they claim it is, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right that it should be.</p>
<p>And we need an audit to establish that it is.</p>
<p>And they won&rsquo;t audit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll do an attestation.</p>
<p>And when they did their attestation,</p>
<p>all they have to do is show a document</p>
<p>that says there&rsquo;s money in an account.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to show how long that&rsquo;s been in the account.</p>
<p>This certainly feels like a security to me.</p>
<p>And I would think the SEC should get involved</p>
<p>in regulating this.</p>
<p>Stable coins are the number one thing</p>
<p>on Gensler and the SEC&rsquo;s mind right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, they make a claim</p>
<p>of a secured interest in something,</p>
<p>unlike a lot of other crypto.</p>
<p>This is like the easiest part of crypto.</p>
<p>This is the easiest part of crypto to regulate.</p>
<p>Why is it easy?</p>
<p>Why, because-</p>
<p>Just look at a bank account.</p>
<p>You audit it, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tokenized dollar, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It is not, actually, I&rsquo;m not even sure it&rsquo;s a security.</p>
<p>It basically is a digital representation</p>
<p>of a dollar that should be sitting</p>
<p>in a bank account somewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a money market fund.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a money market fund.</p>
<p>But money markets are securities</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re regulated as securities.</p>
<p>Okay, fine, but my point is,</p>
<p>there are complicated securities</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s securities that aren&rsquo;t complicated.</p>
<p>This is definitely the least complicated.</p>
<p>The least complicated, that this company</p>
<p>only has, to their own attestations,</p>
<p>like 6%, 3% to 6% in cash in a bank account</p>
<p>and the rest is in highly volatile corporate paper.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the point that I was trying to make</p>
<p>to you in the group chat.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>When a company who&rsquo;s got billions and billions</p>
<p>and billions of dollars of some stable coin,</p>
<p>or something that you think is zero, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a multi, multi-billion dollar market.</p>
<p>Tens of billions.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, tens of billions.</p>
<p>They have 70 billion in tether out there.</p>
<p>And could you imagine if they,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say there was 70 billion of tether</p>
<p>and one billion of securities?</p>
<p>That would be a fraud of gargantuan proportions, right?</p>
<p>It might not be that far off.</p>
<p>If they siphoned the money out for their own use,</p>
<p>that would be a fraud.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;d be beyond talking about fines.</p>
<p>What I found comical, Jason, is your claims</p>
<p>make it seem like Bernie Madoff,</p>
<p>Enron-level corruption craziness.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And the fine was 42 million, which is like,</p>
<p>who fucking cares, 42 million?</p>
<p>And it was between them and another firm.</p>
<p>So either the CFTC completely got the fine wrong</p>
<p>and they missed a zero or two zeros,</p>
<p>or this was not nearly as big as you thought it was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m shocked that Jaycock got overly excited</p>
<p>about some perceived hoax.</p>
<p>Here we go, another hoax.</p>
<p>You are a conspiracy theorist, Jaycock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>I was right about Theranos.</p>
<p>Yeah, Jason didn&rsquo;t fully understand something</p>
<p>and got very emotional about it.</p>
<p>Look, here&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Wow, all right, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m off the, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the best case scenario</p>
<p>for making sense of J. Cal&rsquo;s points,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s possible that Tether,</p>
<p>the company behind Tether, has all the money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve just not chosen to keep it in dollar reserves.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ve put it in corporate bonds</p>
<p>and a whole mishmash of different things.</p>
<p>To get the float.</p>
<p>To get the float, to make more money,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re sold it. Maybe they were</p>
<p>trying to merge it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, my guess is that Tether is solvent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s, it lacks solvency,</p>
<p>but I personally would feel better about any stable coin</p>
<p>if it was 100% dollar backed.</p>
<p>I think it should be.</p>
<p>Which is what Jeremy Lair is doing at USDC and Circle.</p>
<p>I had him on the pod this week.</p>
<p>I hope they bought the GitLab IPO.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the issue here is</p>
<p>they also co-mingled funds,</p>
<p>which is what got Foltzholtz in trouble.</p>
<p>The user&rsquo;s accounts with their money in it</p>
<p>was mixed with the operating capital.</p>
<p>So they were using the deposits to operate the business,</p>
<p>which is the biggest no-no.</p>
<p>They were co-mingling the funds</p>
<p>that people thought were backed.</p>
<p>And Bitfinex and Tether were the same company.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they both got the fines at the same time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also been banned from doing any,</p>
<p>having any customers in New York,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been banned in Canada.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s apparently a DOJ wire for it.</p>
<p>So I think this is the beginning of the end,</p>
<p>not the end of the beginning.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my personal belief.</p>
<p>I was just wanting to get your reaction</p>
<p>to what seemed like a really pathetic fine</p>
<p>for what could be a $70 billion fraud.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>I mean, Facebook got a series of speeding tickets too.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a big issue for our government</p>
<p>is that the scale of these companies-</p>
<p>Bro, they paid $5 billion.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>They paid like $5 billion or something, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and they&rsquo;re a trillion dollar company.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a speeding ticket.</p>
<p>I understand, but 5 billion&rsquo;s a big number.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big number.</p>
<p>Not in relation to their market cap</p>
<p>and how much cash they throw off every year.</p>
<p>$42 million.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a tax payment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quarterly tax payment.</p>
<p>For you, Tramont, not for us.</p>
<p>Or maybe for Sachs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing pretty well too.</p>
<p>Yum, yum.</p>
<p>All right, do we want,</p>
<p>we promised we&rsquo;d do some questions.</p>
<p>Should we do a couple of questions?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, we could also talk about the FDA.</p>
<p>Oh my God, the FDA.</p>
<p>My gosh, Freeberg, do you want to lead this?</p>
<p>Freeberg, you want to tell us about the chaos at the FDA?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s chaotic</p>
<p>like you guys think it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make that a counter-</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you make your chaos point first</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll make yours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of what people believe in.</p>
<p>Yeah, people are perceiving this.</p>
<p>So like, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been a couple of these changes in recommendations.</p>
<p>Now, all of these recommendations that,</p>
<p>and you know, these statements and approvals</p>
<p>that have come out of the FDA</p>
<p>are predicated on these independent advisory panels</p>
<p>that are put together to look at research data,</p>
<p>assess the research data,</p>
<p>and make a recommendation</p>
<p>on what they think is appropriate.</p>
<p>So we saw this happen with the Pfizer booster shot</p>
<p>a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>where initially the advisory panel,</p>
<p>which again is made up of independent doctors</p>
<p>and scientists who generally don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any sort of economic interest in the outcome here.</p>
<p>They voted 16 to two against everyone getting a booster shot</p>
<p>and then they voted 18 to zero</p>
<p>in favor of everyone 65 and over</p>
<p>and those at risk of getting a booster shot.</p>
<p>And then recently there was, you know,</p>
<p>similar sort of consternation around the Moderna</p>
<p>and they ended up looking at data</p>
<p>that indicated that maybe a half dose,</p>
<p>which is 50 micrograms instead of 100 micrograms</p>
<p>would have a reasonable amount of efficacy</p>
<p>relative to the side effect risk for people over 65</p>
<p>and therefore they made a recommendation</p>
<p>to approve that as a booster,</p>
<p>which the FDA is now approving.</p>
<p>And so again, the way this process is run,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s a good process,</p>
<p>is independent advisors of doctors</p>
<p>and scientists come together.</p>
<p>And the one that recently came together</p>
<p>was around this generalized use of aspirin</p>
<p>as a heart attack deterrent,</p>
<p>because it thins the blood</p>
<p>and limits the risk of people getting heart attacks.</p>
<p>But it turns out that such a large percentage</p>
<p>of the population or a large enough percentage</p>
<p>of the population were having bleeding issues</p>
<p>where your stomach bleeds.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys have this,</p>
<p>but you know, you take ibuprofen or NSAIDs,</p>
<p>your stomach can bleed.</p>
<p>That that was causing more of a problem for people</p>
<p>than they were seeing in the data</p>
<p>in terms of a reduction in heart attack effects</p>
<p>for people that were not highly at risk.</p>
<p>And so they revised the recommendation and said,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s give people that are only at risk</p>
<p>and over a certain age aspirin,</p>
<p>not just like give it to everyone over 40 or 50.</p>
<p>And so it took in account new data.</p>
<p>And I think this is an important point.</p>
<p>Science is messy, right?</p>
<p>By definition, science is about gathering data,</p>
<p>forming a hypothesis, testing again,</p>
<p>iterating, restating your hypothesis.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s designed to be circular.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to be a learning system,</p>
<p>not designed to be a system that defines absolute truth</p>
<p>and absolute fact.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s good to see the FDA doing this work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s good to see scientists reviewing new data</p>
<p>and changing their recommendations.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen this in health,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen this in the food system</p>
<p>and the USDA changing their diet guidelines</p>
<p>when people used to be told, don&rsquo;t eat dietary cholesterol,</p>
<p>it turns out saturated fat</p>
<p>is what causes cholesterol in your blood.</p>
<p>So there were a lot of changes that kind of emerged</p>
<p>as new data was gathered.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Remember when they told us to eat a lot of carbs?</p>
<p>Remember the all carb diets?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then they learned</p>
<p>and they made a lot of change in those days.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, can we bring that back?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starving.</p>
<p>I used to eat pasta every day.</p>
<p>First it was rice in my 10s and 20s.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve seen you eat rice.</p>
<p>It is, oh, the shoveling of rice, my Lord.</p>
<p>So Freeburg, I mean,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re going to be just intellectually honest,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re going to be intellectually honest about this,</p>
<p>the fact that, you know, official health officials</p>
<p>can be wrong about positions they&rsquo;ve maintained</p>
<p>with, I guess, seemingly total certainty for decades.</p>
<p>And now they can revise those positions.</p>
<p>I mean, doesn&rsquo;t that lend some credence</p>
<p>to some of these like anti-vax arguments when they say,</p>
<p>well, gee, I&rsquo;m skeptical about injecting our mRNA</p>
<p>into myself.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a totally,</p>
<p>you just got the episode banned on YouTube.</p>
<p>We just got a warning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I got the Pfizer vaccine.</p>
<p>And I think, look, it could have saved my life.</p>
<p>I mean, I had a very mild case of Delta.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had one of the first breakthroughs,</p>
<p>but it was very mild.</p>
<p>And I think that was because I got Pfizer.</p>
<p>I think the risk return was completely worth it.</p>
<p>But I can also see why people with like five-year-old,</p>
<p>like kindergarten age children might not want to get it</p>
<p>for their kids when the upside is absolutely tiny,</p>
<p>given that it doesn&rsquo;t really affect five-year-olds</p>
<p>very much.</p>
<p>And the downside is not, there&rsquo;s no proven downside,</p>
<p>but how is that any different than the aspirin thing?</p>
<p>Wait, am I the only one that wishes</p>
<p>you had gotten really sick with Delta?</p>
<p>Yes, you are.</p>
<p>No, but-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of people on the left.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with the framing that,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what typically happens.</p>
<p>The scientists or the FDA panel will say,</p>
<p>based on the data that we have,</p>
<p>this is our recommendation on what should happen.</p>
<p>And then the framing that people then assume is,</p>
<p>oh, this is what they believe to be absolute truth.</p>
<p>And with absolute certainty, this is what we have to do.</p>
<p>And I think the translation layer to the general population</p>
<p>is such that this is the 10 commandments.</p>
<p>I came down from Mount Sinai,</p>
<p>and this is what I&rsquo;m saying has to happen.</p>
<p>When the reality is, it is based on data</p>
<p>and that data changes over time.</p>
<p>And I think that your point is right.</p>
<p>There is no absolute certainty that the Pfizer vaccine</p>
<p>is gonna be absolutely perfect for everyone.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna absolutely reduce the risk</p>
<p>more than it increases the risk</p>
<p>for people five years old and younger.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very fair point that like,</p>
<p>but the problem as we&rsquo;ve seen on all sides</p>
<p>is that the framing is that these things are binary</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a probability distribution</p>
<p>which is defined as the risk</p>
<p>and the things that might go wrong</p>
<p>and the probability distribution of the benefits.</p>
<p>And then people assume that it&rsquo;s just binary.</p>
<p>Yes or no, good or bad.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re making an excellent point there.</p>
<p>I just want to underscore.</p>
<p>Let me kind of translate what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is that the people at the FDA are in these positions</p>
<p>who actually understand the science</p>
<p>make a cost benefit analysis.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;re saying in approving it</p>
<p>is that the costs outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>Sorry, the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>To the broad population.</p>
<p>To the broad population, okay.</p>
<p>By the way, that&rsquo;s why I got the vaccine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no downsides in 10 years.</p>
<p>All I know is there&rsquo;s an upside immediately</p>
<p>and I benefited from that.</p>
<p>So I was very happy to take it.</p>
<p>But in any event,</p>
<p>instead of this complicated cost benefit analysis,</p>
<p>the media translates that into good, bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a moral case.</p>
<p>And then the politicians translate that into laws and rules.</p>
<p>And if you question the rules,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now a bad person</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve opposed the quote unquote</p>
<p>good side of the argument.</p>
<p>I mean, for example,</p>
<p>Gavin Newsom just signed a bill in California</p>
<p>saying that if you are a public school child,</p>
<p>elementary school, kindergarten,</p>
<p>you have to get vaccinated in order to go to a public school</p>
<p>even though the vaccine doesn&rsquo;t even exist for them yet.</p>
<p>I mean, you could be pro-vax,</p>
<p>which I guess I would consider myself</p>
<p>to be clearly pro-vax.</p>
<p>I mean, I got it.</p>
<p>My 13 year old got it.</p>
<p>I support it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a smart decision to make.</p>
<p>But to require a five year old to get it</p>
<p>in order to go to public schools in California.</p>
<p>Well, you can also wait until we get the FDA data.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a question for you, Friedberg.</p>
<p>You know, having this,</p>
<p>one of the complaints has been the FDA restricts progress.</p>
<p>I mean, I think actually Peter Thiel</p>
<p>had this position for a while</p>
<p>that we should just get rid of it and disband it.</p>
<p>Well, what do we think about having the FDA</p>
<p>being framed as these are recommendations</p>
<p>and then each state gets to make a decision</p>
<p>with their local FDA?</p>
<p>So then if Colorado or Texas or Florida</p>
<p>had a difference of opinion about psychedelics,</p>
<p>about vaccines, they could run their own studies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really important matter of ethics.</p>
<p>What are your ethics that you believe</p>
<p>should be the guiding principles</p>
<p>for how the government plays a role</p>
<p>in individuals making choice</p>
<p>about their health and their body?</p>
<p>And so if you believe that the government,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no right or wrong here,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s simply a framing of what you believe.</p>
<p>If you believe that it&rsquo;s appropriate for the government</p>
<p>to make the decision about what&rsquo;s safe and not safe</p>
<p>for you as an individual to do,</p>
<p>then the FDA should stay in place</p>
<p>and they should have their criteria</p>
<p>of when they&rsquo;re ready to make a recommendation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough data to define the benefit</p>
<p>and the cost of a particular thing</p>
<p>that you might put in your body</p>
<p>and then telling you, yes, you should or shouldn&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>If you, and if not, they&rsquo;re gonna take their time</p>
<p>and figure that out.</p>
<p>Now, if you don&rsquo;t believe that,</p>
<p>then yes, the FDA should be disbanded</p>
<p>and drug companies will go around</p>
<p>and they will tell people, take this drug,</p>
<p>it will save your life and people will take it</p>
<p>and there will be people that will suffer from that.</p>
<p>There will be people that will have side effects from that.</p>
<p>Or maybe something in between.</p>
<p>There will be people that will die from that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s local FDAs and federal.</p>
<p>And remember like the criteria for the FDA is do no harm.</p>
<p>So that is the criteria for a doctor in general.</p>
<p>It is a very difficult criteria to meet</p>
<p>when there are costs to a drug</p>
<p>or costs to a therapy or treatment.</p>
<p>When people get chemotherapy for cancer,</p>
<p>there are awful deleterious side effects to their body.</p>
<p>But the benefit of saving their life</p>
<p>and getting rid of the cancer</p>
<p>or having at least a shot at doing that is great enough.</p>
<p>And the FDA has made a judgment call</p>
<p>that that cost and that benefit kind of create an equation</p>
<p>that says this is an approved drug now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really their goal.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t have enough data</p>
<p>and they haven&rsquo;t taken enough time to figure that out,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t feel comfortable approving a drug</p>
<p>and making that recommendation.</p>
<p>But then if you let them get out of the way</p>
<p>and you let individuals make choice,</p>
<p>you could see this being a disgusting free-for-all</p>
<p>where drug companies will hawk snake oil on people</p>
<p>and a lot of harm will be caused.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the counter argument.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying one is right or one is wrong.</p>
<p>Well, I was thinking there might be something</p>
<p>in between with states having certain rights.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really about</p>
<p>what is the role that you want any government,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s states or the federal government,</p>
<p>to play in deciding what you can and can&rsquo;t do with your body</p>
<p>and what you can and can&rsquo;t put in your body.</p>
<p>And ultimately what companies that are making products</p>
<p>for you can and can&rsquo;t say to you</p>
<p>about the benefit and the cost of that product.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no simple solution, right?</p>
<p>I mean, like, if you want to say like-</p>
<p>Look at Kyrie Irving.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s basically, he&rsquo;s walking away</p>
<p>from a $200 million extension and he believes in vaccines.</p>
<p>Not every individual is equipped to look at the data</p>
<p>and make a judgment call on their own.</p>
<p>And so the question then is what authority</p>
<p>will they look to?</p>
<p>And if the alternative authority that they will look to</p>
<p>is not as good as a research team of 18 scientists,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re probably going to end up getting bad advice.</p>
<p>What do you think the odds are Kyrie retires?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 60% right now.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more than 50%.</p>
<p>So wait, he&rsquo;s giving up $200 million</p>
<p>because he won&rsquo;t get vaccinated?</p>
<p>He has a $200 million extension.</p>
<p>He gets paid like 30 or $40 million a year.</p>
<p>He refuses to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>He said the reason he&rsquo;s not getting the vaccine</p>
<p>is because of all the people who don&rsquo;t have a choice,</p>
<p>the pilots who are being forced to get it</p>
<p>or not go to work.</p>
<p>So he is a privilege, he says,</p>
<p>and he wants to make this decision for everybody else.</p>
<p>He also believes that the earth is flat.</p>
<p>Stop, that was a joke.</p>
<p>He said-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was a joke.</p>
<p>Where are you getting that from, Jayco?</p>
<p>Typing, Kyrie Irving, flat earth.</p>
<p>He talked about how do we know the earth is actually round</p>
<p>and he basically was holding it in two days.</p>
<p>That sounds like a media distortion to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, two days later he came out</p>
<p>and he was like, you guys misinterpreted.</p>
<p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s nothing under there.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, oh, he&rsquo;s unique and wacky.</p>
<p>He sounds, so I wouldn&rsquo;t make that decision.</p>
<p>Why are you so pejorative?</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s infuriating that he-</p>
<p>Just because someone disagrees with you,</p>
<p>you say that they&rsquo;re wacky.</p>
<p>Because KD wanted to come to the Knicks.</p>
<p>These are Taylor Lorenz tactics.</p>
<p>KD wanted to come to the Knicks</p>
<p>and Kyrie convinced him to go to Brooklyn.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason.</p>
<p>Jayco, you&rsquo;re still a member of the media.</p>
<p>You have like a vestigial tail here,</p>
<p>is that you just bought in to the framework</p>
<p>that Freeberg laid out,</p>
<p>which is the media takes complicated issues,</p>
<p>cost-benefit analyses, and turns them into right or wrong,</p>
<p>good or bad.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t come to the Knicks.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t come to the Knicks.</p>
<p>So now he&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s bad because-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s bad for not coming to the Knicks, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>He sounds to me like a man of conscience.</p>
<p>No, a man of conscience,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s willing to stand up on principle,</p>
<p>turn down $200 million.</p>
<p>I got the vaccine for free.</p>
<p>I sure as hell wouldn&rsquo;t turn away $200 million</p>
<p>not to get it.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it&rsquo;s not a decision I would make.</p>
<p>If they offered you $200 million to not take it,</p>
<p>would you have taken it?</p>
<p>Would you have not taken it?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m not taking it for $200 million.</p>
<p>There was a, I heard a great story yesterday</p>
<p>at the poker table.</p>
<p>One of the guys was telling me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s his backgammon teacher.</p>
<p>And he says his backgammon teacher,</p>
<p>is an incredible, you know,</p>
<p>good backgammon teacher and a magician, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>20 years ago, he was asked</p>
<p>to get female breast implants for a year for $100,000.</p>
<p>He did it and he kept them for 20 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a free roll.</p>
<p>So, you know, the bar for people to do things</p>
<p>is really not that high,</p>
<p>is really what I took away from that story.</p>
<p>And what I took away from this story is.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go around the horn.</p>
<p>No, but Kyrie is willing to draw the line</p>
<p>on something that he believes in</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna cost him $200 million.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that come with all of that noise.</p>
<p>He should be allowed to make that decision, in my opinion.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t like the way that he&rsquo;s characterized</p>
<p>because I think this is a good human being.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a phenomenal basketball player.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt he&rsquo;s phenomenal.</p>
<p>Could you imagine how strongly he feels about this</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s willing to walk away from the game that he loves</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s, you know, been an enormous part of his life?</p>
<p>Well, why is it so important to foist on Kyrie Irving</p>
<p>the need to get vaccinated?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not-</p>
<p>Because in New York City, indoors, you have to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a vaccine requirement</p>
<p>and he can&rsquo;t play at home games.</p>
<p>He could play in Texas or Houston.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve talked about trading him to Houston,</p>
<p>but then when he went to New York</p>
<p>and he also can&rsquo;t practice with the team</p>
<p>in New York, New Jersey, I guess, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of states</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t go indoors without a vaccine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in close proximity to each other.</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>I just think we&rsquo;re turning a good thing into,</p>
<p>which is the vaccine.</p>
<p>I genuinely think it&rsquo;s a great thing</p>
<p>that it got done so quickly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a miracle of science.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s helped a lot of people.</p>
<p>I mean, all of us.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s going to end the pandemic,</p>
<p>largely already has.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re turning into a bad thing.</p>
<p>But why were we demanding that these holdouts,</p>
<p>like every last person must get vaccinated?</p>
<p>Well, what about a flight attendant?</p>
<p>Should a flight attendant be for us</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re on a tiny tube going to the sky?</p>
<p>Or should they be work somewhere else?</p>
<p>You get so much protection by being vaccinated yourself</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think you should be circumcised.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t believe in mandates now?</p>
<p>Well, I think private companies have the right to require it.</p>
<p>NBA is a private company.</p>
<p>I know, I get it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just starting to really question here</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s truly necessary</p>
<p>to get every single one of these last holdouts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something un-American about imposing</p>
<p>on free people this decision.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t just make up their own mind.</p>
<p>You in a previous episode said you were in favor of it</p>
<p>if people were dying at a higher rate,</p>
<p>if it was more acute.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second.</p>
<p>You did say that.</p>
<p>You said if it was killing kids</p>
<p>and a lot of people were dying,</p>
<p>you were in favor of it.</p>
<p>If it was some sort of like Ebola,</p>
<p>like yeah, of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be a whole different cost benefit analysis.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>But look, what I said,</p>
<p>and I think this is still my position,</p>
<p>is that government shouldn&rsquo;t require,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t stick a needle in your arm.</p>
<p>I think private businesses can do it.</p>
<p>Or you don&rsquo;t use that service.</p>
<p>So I mean-</p>
<p>How much would it take for you</p>
<p>to get B-Cups implanted for a year?</p>
<p>For $1 billion, would you do it?</p>
<p>A billion.</p>
<p>Only Bs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying like a strong D or something,</p>
<p>just like a modest B-Cup.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, is that a real story, Chamath?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll send you the link.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge article about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in Wikipedia as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s an old story.</p>
<p>Jason, you&rsquo;ve already got B-Cups.</p>
<p>I hope someone&rsquo;s paying you for that.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost 16 pounds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like a perky A right now.</p>
<p>B-Cups be gone.</p>
<p>The show has gone off the rails.</p>
<p>We promised the audience we&rsquo;d take two questions.</p>
<p>The first one is for Friedberg.</p>
<p>And the first question comes from Daniel Nielis.</p>
<p>He says,</p>
<p>Alphafone made great progress</p>
<p>in predictive protein folding.</p>
<p>Is there anything similar for chemical synthesis?</p>
<p>Could a similar system finally predict</p>
<p>a less energy intensive pathway to ammonia</p>
<p>than the Haber-Bosch process, for example?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a difference.</p>
<p>This is a great question.</p>
<p>When molecules interact,</p>
<p>a molecule is a bunch of atoms stuck together.</p>
<p>And there are electrons and protons</p>
<p>that make up that molecule.</p>
<p>And therefore there&rsquo;s this kind of variable</p>
<p>electric potential, energy potential</p>
<p>that surrounds that molecule.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult today</p>
<p>to deterministically model</p>
<p>how two molecules might interact</p>
<p>with one another in physics.</p>
<p>And it turns out that that resolves using quantum physics.</p>
<p>And so today we can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>kind of put two molecules together</p>
<p>and say, here&rsquo;s what happens when you put these together</p>
<p>and have a computer program very quickly</p>
<p>and easily solve that.</p>
<p>Quantum physics is involved</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have a good way</p>
<p>to simulate quantum physics in binary computers.</p>
<p>So one of the theories,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s been some work on this</p>
<p>on the research basis,</p>
<p>creating the framework for it,</p>
<p>is that we can use quantum computers</p>
<p>to simulate the quantum states of molecules</p>
<p>and use that to figure out</p>
<p>how molecules might interact with one another.</p>
<p>And as a result,</p>
<p>you could kind of see us creating simulations</p>
<p>that resolve certain enzymes or proteins</p>
<p>that might break apart molecules</p>
<p>or stick molecules together</p>
<p>or other molecule combinations</p>
<p>that might cause something to happen.</p>
<p>The Haber-Bosch process,</p>
<p>which is being referred to,</p>
<p>was discovered through trial and error</p>
<p>in the early 20th century</p>
<p>by a German physicist and engineer.</p>
<p>And they realized that if they compressed atmospheric air</p>
<p>to 200 times atmospheric pressure</p>
<p>and ran it over an iron catalyst with electricity,</p>
<p>it zapped, it broke apart the nitrogen bonds</p>
<p>in the atmosphere and in the air that was compressed</p>
<p>and trickled out ammonia,</p>
<p>which is nitrogen and hydrogen.</p>
<p>And so this was like this amazing invention</p>
<p>and it saved the world and fed the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great book called The Alchemy of Air</p>
<p>if anyone&rsquo;s interested in hearing about this.</p>
<p>But it was through trial and error</p>
<p>and we got so frigging lucky as a species</p>
<p>that we figured this out.</p>
<p>Using quantum computing in the next 30 years,</p>
<p>hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to deterministically</p>
<p>model these behaviors on a molecular and atomic level</p>
<p>and as a result,</p>
<p>build new systems to make things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll be an incredible toolkit for humans</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll advance a lot of science</p>
<p>and a lot of engineering forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still really strongly of the belief,</p>
<p>and this goes back to your point earlier,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m going on a bit of a rant.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>In 100 to 120 years from now,</p>
<p>I do think we&rsquo;ll all have a replicator in our room.</p>
<p>That replicator will make all the things we wanna make</p>
<p>nearly instantaneously with very low energy</p>
<p>and very low cost.</p>
<p>Including an organ, a new brain, a new heart.</p>
<p>Some food, the next car you wanna make.</p>
<p>I mean, we could see, and by the way,</p>
<p>this is a crazy concept.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about, oh, you know, quantum stuff</p>
<p>or whatever was described in Star Trek.</p>
<p>But the general principle that you can locally make things</p>
<p>and locally make things cheaply</p>
<p>with very little energy and very little input</p>
<p>changes the whole supply chain model.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing this increasingly with new technologies,</p>
<p>with 3D printing and biomanufacturing.</p>
<p>You start to put these all together</p>
<p>and you take a nonlinear track out</p>
<p>in the next couple decades.</p>
<p>And you get to a point that all this nonsense</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about where we&rsquo;re mining stuff in one place</p>
<p>and making it in another</p>
<p>and shipping it and combining it all in another.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that solves the Long Beach port.</p>
<p>Saks, Saks, you&rsquo;re gonna be able to print a conscience.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna be incredible.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad.</p>
<p>Freeberg, you&rsquo;re gonna be able to print an emotion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad we took this audience question.</p>
<p>So glad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, here&rsquo;s a question for Saks.</p>
<p>Matty, or I guess me and also Chamath,</p>
<p>and I guess all four of us.</p>
<p>Matty Chavez asks,</p>
<p>between being a VC founder, angel, corporate employee,</p>
<p>which has been the most fun, rewarding, and why?</p>
<p>What advice would you give someone early in their career</p>
<p>hoping to be like you,</p>
<p>multi-channel investor thought leader when they grow up?</p>
<p>Saks?</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t become a VC until after I had already done</p>
<p>a few tours of duty as a founder and operator.</p>
<p>So, I mean, my recommendation would be</p>
<p>to get involved in startups first,</p>
<p>generally get some operating experience,</p>
<p>and that would serve you well.</p>
<p>Startups or even bigger companies.</p>
<p>I just think getting some reps</p>
<p>inside of an organization is critical.</p>
<p>I tell everyone that&rsquo;s coming out of college</p>
<p>or early in their career,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important you go get that perspective</p>
<p>and work at a bigger business.</p>
<p>I mean, I spent a few years at Google</p>
<p>and it was 1,000 people when I joined,</p>
<p>grew to 10,000 by the time I left.</p>
<p>But I learned so much just in that role</p>
<p>and seeing successful products,</p>
<p>successful models for operating a business.</p>
<p>It was really impactful for me long-term.</p>
<p>And then you go and make all the mistakes</p>
<p>as a founder building a startup.</p>
<p>And a lot of people end up with bad confirmation bias</p>
<p>if they work at a startup that didn&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>and they think, and all they can draw from</p>
<p>is a failed model for operating,</p>
<p>if things didn&rsquo;t work right.</p>
<p>Which was your favorite?</p>
<p>Which role has been your favorite to date, Freeberg?</p>
<p>You know, when I was an executive at Monsanto,</p>
<p>it was really nice to have that private jet</p>
<p>that would come out and take me places.</p>
<p>They had a whole security requirement.</p>
<p>I already have that anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, you guys have that.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, the 1%.</p>
<p>I have this impression of the 0.1%.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not editing it out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not editing it out.</p>
<p>Stacey and Henry Belltester&rsquo;s making a video.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m setting the tape.</p>
<p>Do not edit it out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, you said it, it&rsquo;s in your heart.</p>
<p>You own your words, David Sachs.</p>
<p>What was your favorite, Sachs?</p>
<p>My favorite stint?</p>
<p>Yeah, tour.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously what we did at PayPal</p>
<p>has gone on to become a legend.</p>
<p>And then, you know, PayPal, I was the founder CEO,</p>
<p>we led that to a unicorn exit.</p>
<p>So you got to say those would be</p>
<p>the two best professional experiences.</p>
<p>I was joking about the private jet thing.</p>
<p>Honestly, like to me, and Sachs, I&rsquo;m sure,</p>
<p>you know, and the rest of you guys can feel the same,</p>
<p>but like making a great product and selling that product</p>
<p>and, you know, working with a customer with that product</p>
<p>is honestly like the most rewarding thing you can do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, getting your hands dirty</p>
<p>and actually delivering something of value in the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more rewarding than that.</p>
<p>I mean, all the financial engineering and making money</p>
<p>and all the nonsense that goes on</p>
<p>is really kind of a zoom out of that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s really where reward comes in.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel that way too.</p>
<p>I was joking about the private jet too.</p>
<p>Dang!</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>Which jet?</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>I think Nick caught me misspeaking.</p>
<p>So yeah, it was the first experience was PayPal,</p>
<p>the second experience was Yammer.</p>
<p>We may have to do some audio work there.</p>
<p>Which is your favorite private jet that you have?</p>
<p>Yeah, which one, which?</p>
<p>The Global 7500.</p>
<p>By the way, I just want to defend myself</p>
<p>on stealing toiletries on Chamath&rsquo;s plane.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t defend yourself, don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>It was a mini bottle of Scope.</p>
<p>I drank half of it.</p>
<p>What are you supposed to do?</p>
<p>How many did you take?</p>
<p>Put it back in the drawer.</p>
<p>How many did you take?</p>
<p>On your plane or on Chamath&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>On your plane, I took a, true story,</p>
<p>I did take the half bottle of Pappy Van Winkle.</p>
<p>You took my Pappy Van Winkle?</p>
<p>It was like a half left.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a $5,000 bottle, it&rsquo;s 2,500.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ll tell you a funny story about Pappy.</p>
<p>I boosted a half bottle of Pappy.</p>
<p>So, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So here, I got to tell you this funny story.</p>
<p>So I was going on, you didn&rsquo;t take it.</p>
<p>I drank it.</p>
<p>I was going on a business trip</p>
<p>with a couple of friends, coworkers,</p>
<p>who they&rsquo;re actually founders now of a company I backed.</p>
<p>Anyway, we were going to an event in,</p>
<p>I think it was in Atlanta.</p>
<p>So it was like a four hour flight.</p>
<p>So they opened the liquor drawer or whatever</p>
<p>and saw the Pappy Van Winkle</p>
<p>and they asked if they could have,</p>
<p>I was like, sure, take whatever you want.</p>
<p>And then I went in the back and went to sleep.</p>
<p>So by the time we land like four hours later,</p>
<p>the entire Pappy Van Winkle like stash has been,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve gone through it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all these different types of Pappy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the Pappy 23.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got some of these,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got some of these antique ones.</p>
<p>So they asked me,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;d never flown on a private plane before.</p>
<p>They asked me, you know,</p>
<p>hey Sax, how much did this flight cost?</p>
<p>And I said, it costs about $6,000 in jet fuel</p>
<p>and about $8,000 in Pappy Van Winkle.</p>
<p>Pour the Pappy into the jet.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;m from around the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaving with something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaving with something.</p>
<p>You know, like if I&rsquo;m Bobby or PJ,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna leave with something.</p>
<p>I think we found a way to end this podcast</p>
<p>in the most insufferable way possible.</p>
<p>Insufferable way possible.</p>
<p>Delete all the private jets.</p>
<p>All right, Nick, edit it all out.</p>
<p>Edit, no, edit nothing.</p>
<p>Highlight it, make it the opening.</p>
<p>All right, for the Queen of Quinoa, David Friedberg,</p>
<p>for Rain Man, David Sax,</p>
<p>and the dictator of South Somalia, Kali Hafti.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re playing next week at Saksipu&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>At the mausoleum.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re playing at, beep, next week.</p>
<p>At the mausoleum.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re playing at the mausoleum.</p>
<p>Nobody knows where the mausoleum is.</p>
<p>Nobody knows where the mausoleum is,</p>
<p>but it was where Sax was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been docked so many times.</p>
<p>We better get security.</p>
<p>Chamath is coming.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t bring him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bring him.</p>
<p>All right, we&rsquo;ll see you all next time.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sax.</p>
<p>We open-sourced it to the fans,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, West.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the Queen of Quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I hope they&rsquo;re deep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Sax.</p>
<p>Wait, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>My avatars will meet me at Saksipu.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this sexual tension,</p>
<p>but they just need to release it now.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the bee.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a bee.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a bee.</p>
<p>Bee.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
