<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>this is the dr. Berg show live from the</p>
<p>nation&rsquo;s capital it&rsquo;s time to get</p>
<p>healthy lose weight and feel great call</p>
<p>now to speak with dr. Berg at eight six</p>
<p>six five six one four two nine two and</p>
<p>now dr. Eric Berg</p>
<p>hi guys welcome back it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>before the New Year end we have Karen</p>
<p>over here</p>
<p>say hello Karen hello Karen good so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna answer questions on social</p>
<p>media and take your questions you can</p>
<p>call in if you want to call in the</p>
<p>numbers eight six six five six one four</p>
<p>two nine two we have a ton of callers</p>
<p>been waiting for a while so we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>jump right in and take your questions on</p>
<p>keto and in a minute fasting and any</p>
<p>other questions you want to ask related</p>
<p>to health hey Dean you&rsquo;re from College</p>
<p>Park Georgia go ahead what was your</p>
<p>question yes hi dr. bird&rsquo;s-eye I would</p>
<p>like to know I&rsquo;m a 68 year old female</p>
<p>mom and after working for 30 years I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like to know I have an MRI god and I was</p>
<p>diagnosed with the herniated disc and I</p>
<p>heard your short video my son listens to</p>
<p>you every day and I heard your short</p>
<p>video on on the disc and the medicine</p>
<p>you take and the magnin aids i magnin ii</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;d like to know how many you can</p>
<p>take a day okay okay good so let me let</p>
<p>me talk about that so for for ligament</p>
<p>support oh sorry for ligament support</p>
<p>for a disc support for tendon support</p>
<p>manganese okay that&rsquo;s the mineral that</p>
<p>you need so I would get some manganese</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to overdose on it just</p>
<p>take whatever is on the bottle</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a trace mineral so it&rsquo;s trace</p>
<p>minerals are minerals needed in very</p>
<p>small amounts but you still need them so</p>
<p>I would also you don&rsquo;t want to take any</p>
<p>one trace mineral for a long period of</p>
<p>time so take it on a regular basis but</p>
<p>then also add trace minerals with it so</p>
<p>you want the whole base I would take</p>
<p>liquid plant-based trace minerals with</p>
<p>some additional manganese and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be good that&rsquo;s gonna strengthen</p>
<p>your back your disc your ligaments</p>
<p>because these trace minerals actually</p>
<p>work with proteins so they allow the</p>
<p>protein to work better and you can build</p>
<p>it back up so that&rsquo;s exactly what you</p>
<p>need all right</p>
<p>good question</p>
<p>Donna you&rsquo;re from Atlanta u2 question go</p>
<p>ahead yes good morning dr. Berg I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing the keto diet since March and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and I&rsquo;ve reached my</p>
<p>goal weight and I want to know how to</p>
<p>stop the weight loss but keep my a 1</p>
<p>being long yeah good question first of</p>
<p>all the a1c is going to be a reflection</p>
<p>of how many carbohydrates that you</p>
<p>consume so you want to keep the carbs</p>
<p>down you don&rsquo;t want to start going to</p>
<p>the carbohydrate to actually you know</p>
<p>maintain your keto what you want to do</p>
<p>is you want to add more fat and that way</p>
<p>your body will start to burn up some of</p>
<p>the dietary fat and not enough of your</p>
<p>fat if you&rsquo;re thin and you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>do this and you go low-fat and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing lean protein and vegetables oh my</p>
<p>gosh you&rsquo;re gonna get really skinny so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a flat reflection of adding</p>
<p>more healthy fats so you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>satisfied and you have enough for</p>
<p>example myself I don&rsquo;t want to lose any</p>
<p>more weight so what I&rsquo;ll do recently I</p>
<p>made these keto bombs keto bombs are</p>
<p>like healthy fat cookies and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>consume them right after a meal and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do like quite a few but they&rsquo;re small</p>
<p>until I&rsquo;m really good and satisfied and</p>
<p>I can go a long period of time in fact</p>
<p>the recipe is on my blog under recipes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the healthiest cookie in the</p>
<p>world actually it&rsquo;s made with them</p>
<p>grass-fed butter and almond flour and</p>
<p>sugar free chocolate and it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>delicious</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s really what you want to do is</p>
<p>add more fat but don&rsquo;t forget to add</p>
<p>everything else like a lot of vegetables</p>
<p>and these good protein but that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing you need to add all</p>
<p>right hey Megan you&rsquo;re from Georgia you</p>
<p>had a question about fasting blood</p>
<p>glucose go ahead hi yes um good morning</p>
<p>I was wondering I have my fasting blood</p>
<p>sugar has been around like 105 to 120</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of my norm and even when I</p>
<p>go to bed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be you know 110 or even 105 and</p>
<p>still be that or be higher in the</p>
<p>morning and I know the liver has a role</p>
<p>in that and I was just wondering if you</p>
<p>could explain that and maybe how to help</p>
<p>with that yeah sure hey question Megan</p>
<p>do you have any are you overweight no</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually almost underweight okay but</p>
<p>I a 1 C is high though it&rsquo;s 6.4 okay and</p>
<p>have you been eating a lot of refined</p>
<p>carbs in your past in my past but not</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m actually getting ready to start</p>
<p>keto next week okay good do you have any</p>
<p>fat around your midsection</p>
<p>no okay no I&rsquo;m five six and a half and</p>
<p>like a hundred and fifteen pounds okay</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s talk about this you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>absolutely right the liver has a lot to</p>
<p>do with this fasting glucose level</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something in your body that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called glycogen that&rsquo;s stored sugar like</p>
<p>when you when you eat starches like</p>
<p>potato like a potato for example you</p>
<p>have a similar thing which you have</p>
<p>these kind of stored glucose molecules</p>
<p>in a potato but in your body you can</p>
<p>store glucose as glycogen so you have</p>
<p>kind of a similar type thing going on in</p>
<p>your body that you can use when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not eating so you you run off the stored</p>
<p>sugar and then eventually you&rsquo;ll tap</p>
<p>into fat so one of the things that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running into is high a1c which is</p>
<p>an average blood sugar for like three</p>
<p>months so you&rsquo;re just your Sugar&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically too high and now you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to switch to the keto and M&amp;M fasting</p>
<p>hopefully and the problem is your</p>
<p>fasting sugar is just too high so that</p>
<p>does mean your liver is is probably an</p>
<p>issue and even though you&rsquo;re thin you</p>
<p>may have a fatty liver or dysfunctional</p>
<p>liver and if the liver is fatty or</p>
<p>dysfunctional or you have insulin</p>
<p>resistance it does not hold that stored</p>
<p>sugar so then now we have this blood</p>
<p>sugar issue because you can&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>regulate blood sugars correctly that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably what&rsquo;s happening so most of the</p>
<p>store sugars in your liver a very small</p>
<p>percentage of it is in the</p>
<p>and in the muscle but it&rsquo;s mainly liver</p>
<p>so the liver is really a key organ and</p>
<p>regulating this so as soon as you go on</p>
<p>this and you start doing it consistently</p>
<p>with the healthy diet it&rsquo;s gonna come</p>
<p>right down everything&rsquo;s gonna fall in</p>
<p>the place your blood Sugar&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>come back to a good range like maybe 80</p>
<p>would be great and so you have nothing</p>
<p>to worry about with that so but the</p>
<p>point is yeah you&rsquo;re gonna be eating</p>
<p>healthy to be able to restore the liver</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to do keto just to you</p>
<p>know fix your blood sugars you want to</p>
<p>do it to actually get your body healthy</p>
<p>especially the liver so I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re smart on that and I would just</p>
<p>continue with the recommendations that</p>
<p>that are on my website and also the</p>
<p>videos so and you&rsquo;ll be fine all right</p>
<p>so Karen do we have any quick questions</p>
<p>over there coming in</p>
<p>why are my questions always quick a</p>
<p>whole bunch of these people have a lot</p>
<p>of question I have a lot of people to</p>
<p>write but before anything we have to</p>
<p>give a shout out right to Timmy and Coco</p>
<p>adorable sent us this adorable tree</p>
<p>ornament it says the most loved couple</p>
<p>on YouTube and that and the little</p>
<p>penguins are Karen and Eric so cute and</p>
<p>Timmy and Coco Coco&rsquo;s eight years old</p>
<p>they are from Iceland and Coco is</p>
<p>getting all the carbs out of her diet</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s making the pancakes and the</p>
<p>keto friendly food and her mom is really</p>
<p>proud of her and her mom Timmy&rsquo;s lost</p>
<p>weight too so we want to say thanks and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re gonna shout out to</p>
<p>Timmy and Coco all day long okay great</p>
<p>so I have from Facebook I have Naheed</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s asking about large fibroids and</p>
<p>keto and weight loss and have you</p>
<p>experienced any challenge with people</p>
<p>with fibroids or is it it&rsquo;s workable</p>
<p>okay so one thing you have to know about</p>
<p>fibroids it&rsquo;s a tumor and and by the way</p>
<p>anything that I say today is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>for your education it&rsquo;s not meant to</p>
<p>diagnose you will replace your medical</p>
<p>doctors advice so it&rsquo;s for you to do</p>
<p>research and you&rsquo;re in entertainment</p>
<p>okay so I&rsquo;m not going to claim any to</p>
<p>cure anything illnesses but that being</p>
<p>said a fibroid will grow when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fed its food and fibroids and</p>
<p>tumors in general are very hungry for</p>
<p>sugar okay even there&rsquo;s a PET scan which</p>
<p>basically inject radioactive this</p>
<p>radioactive material in your body that</p>
<p>goes through and it picks up areas of</p>
<p>high level of sugar metabolism and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the cancer is so a tumor</p>
<p>being more of a benign type of a</p>
<p>situation where it&rsquo;s not malignant but</p>
<p>which can turn into a malignant cancer</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a pre cancer thing</p>
<p>lives on sugar so keto genic diets are</p>
<p>the absolute best thing to do to get</p>
<p>that under control but on top of that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re very highly sensitive to</p>
<p>estrogen so if you really want to be</p>
<p>careful about consuming foods with</p>
<p>estrogen you want to do organic and you</p>
<p>want to do</p>
<p>iodine type things like sea cow because</p>
<p>iodine helps regulate insulin and that</p>
<p>will be the best thing for a fibroid in</p>
<p>addition to in a minute fasting and the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet okay is that good that</p>
<p>was quite enough answer I have another</p>
<p>question okay yes and this is from Max</p>
<p>moody on YouTube and the question is how</p>
<p>does a high fat diet relate to building</p>
<p>muscle well it&rsquo;s not really the fat that</p>
<p>builds muscle it&rsquo;s when you cut the</p>
<p>carbs out and then what happens is you</p>
<p>start stimulating the hormones that</p>
<p>activate muscle growth which is growth</p>
<p>hormone and even testosterone and the</p>
<p>way you do it is you keep insulin down</p>
<p>and you also go on intimate fasting</p>
<p>because that will also trigger a low</p>
<p>blood sugar situation and then goes</p>
<p>right into stimulating growth hormone in</p>
<p>fact in a minute fasting Karen will</p>
<p>stimulate growth hormone by 2,000</p>
<p>percent and lizard and individuals not</p>
<p>in everyone but still it&rsquo;s pretty high</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s compared to who who well the</p>
<p>studies mainly are in men but yeah yeah</p>
<p>but an exercise if you&rsquo;re to do exercise</p>
<p>intensely you&rsquo;re only gonna stimulate</p>
<p>growth on them by 450 percent so in a</p>
<p>bit of fasting is going to be the key</p>
<p>thing that the problem with in a minute</p>
<p>fasting without adding more fat is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a hard time going from</p>
<p>one meal to the next so that&rsquo;s why fat</p>
<p>is essential because it has virtually a</p>
<p>very small effect on insulin other than</p>
<p>just eating in general stimulates some</p>
<p>insulin but the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mess with your blood Sugar&rsquo;s like other</p>
<p>macronutrients it&rsquo;s what you need to do</p>
<p>but just by sitting down and eat a bunch</p>
<p>of fat that&rsquo;s not going to increase your</p>
<p>muscles yeah okay so now we&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>do a question from sue from Indiana go</p>
<p>ahead - yes thank you for all I can</p>
<p>remember I have trouble swallowing</p>
<p>capsules I get stuck in my throat</p>
<p>sometimes for hours yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty bad because then sometimes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sticky and then it gets stuck</p>
<p>there and you&rsquo;re like oh my gosh it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tablet sticking right there so I&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>you some tips okay</p>
<p>first of all what you want to do is you</p>
<p>want to consume the capsules with food</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re gonna get them down</p>
<p>the other thing is like regular water</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to work but carbonated</p>
<p>water is a little bit better because</p>
<p>somehow it that fizz tends to bring it</p>
<p>down into the lower part of the</p>
<p>esophagus so I would add food when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking the capsules and you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>good to go next thing if that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work just open the capsules up and put</p>
<p>it in little peanut butter and consume</p>
<p>it that way all right sue thanks for</p>
<p>your question</p>
<p>hey Larry you&rsquo;re also from Indiana you</p>
<p>had a question go ahead yes my doctor</p>
<p>did an x-ray on my knees and I&rsquo;m losing</p>
<p>my cartilage in my knees because I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>runner and what foods do I need to eat</p>
<p>to repair the cartilage good question</p>
<p>well Larry if you want to build</p>
<p>cartilage there&rsquo;s a couple things you</p>
<p>want to consume but that&rsquo;s usually not</p>
<p>going to make a real big impact with you</p>
<p>losing cartilage there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>reasons why you of course you have wear</p>
<p>and tear but you have also a chronic</p>
<p>inflammatory condition that concurrent</p>
<p>as well so to reduce inflammation and</p>
<p>help you maximize the growth of</p>
<p>cartilage which by the way revolves</p>
<p>around a certain hormone called growth</p>
<p>hormone we just keep coming back to the</p>
<p>growth hormone growth hormone is</p>
<p>incredible for protecting proteins and</p>
<p>also stimulating the growth of the</p>
<p>connective tissue in cartilage and discs</p>
<p>and lent and tendons and ligaments so</p>
<p>what you want to do the best thing is</p>
<p>intermittent fasting that is hands-down</p>
<p>the best thing and then Nikita why</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s gonna bring insulin down</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna enhance your proteins and</p>
<p>your joints and not just the joints but</p>
<p>the muscle but it&rsquo;s gonna stimulate</p>
<p>growth woman so in a minute fasting is</p>
<p>what you need to focus on now as far as</p>
<p>what to eat it just has to be a healthy</p>
<p>diet of a lot of vegetables including</p>
<p>like minerals in there trace minerals</p>
<p>probably some sea vegetables to be good</p>
<p>some high quality fish eggs all these</p>
<p>really key nutrients because you want to</p>
<p>look at not just foods to increase</p>
<p>cartilage but you want to look at foods</p>
<p>for overall health building factors in</p>
<p>supporting your proteins versus like</p>
<p>some people think well I&rsquo;m just going to</p>
<p>eval on a protein and that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>fix it it&rsquo;s not going to work because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna if you have more protein</p>
<p>than you can digest which is about six</p>
<p>ounces per meal you&rsquo;re gonna then</p>
<p>stimulate insulin and then have a</p>
<p>reverse benefit so that seems to be a</p>
<p>sweet spot with maximized protein</p>
<p>absorption at three to six ounces maybe</p>
<p>seven ounces if you&rsquo;re a big guy but not</p>
<p>a lot but then if you go too low then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to have enough so you</p>
<p>want to provide the raw material to</p>
<p>build cartilage which is not just</p>
<p>protein high-quality protein but the</p>
<p>minerals potassium is very very</p>
<p>essential trace minerals and even</p>
<p>healthy fats because you need some of</p>
<p>the fat soluble vitamins vitamin A D and</p>
<p>K so basically that&rsquo;s a long answer to</p>
<p>just basically doing the program that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m recommending on YouTube the books</p>
<p>that I have and you&rsquo;re gonna actually do</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be very successful if you</p>
<p>have inflammation going on the joint</p>
<p>I think stinging nettle root is a great</p>
<p>herb to</p>
<p>take is a tea or a supplement to reduce</p>
<p>inflammation I like that the best but</p>
<p>other than that I wouldn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>else okay Larry thanks for the question</p>
<p>Lee hi you&rsquo;re from Nevada you had a</p>
<p>question about your 14 year old son go</p>
<p>ahead yes hi 14 years old and he&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>his growth ears and we just wanted to</p>
<p>come see which foods and supplements or</p>
<p>exercise until the day we should we be</p>
<p>focusing on to maximize growth do you</p>
<p>want your son to grow taller he does oh</p>
<p>he does okay yeah there&rsquo;s a couple of</p>
<p>things and I&rsquo;m going to recommend that</p>
<p>because I work with a lot of people over</p>
<p>the years and there&rsquo;s several things</p>
<p>that you want to do you don&rsquo;t sell this</p>
<p>you can find it online it&rsquo;s a standard</p>
<p>process product and it&rsquo;s called the two</p>
<p>atrophic tattoo atrophic after the</p>
<p>pituitary</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called pituitary often PMG okay and</p>
<p>you can just do a search for it I would</p>
<p>actually have them take one of those per</p>
<p>day and what it does is it supports the</p>
<p>pituitary the pituitary is really</p>
<p>important in supplying all the the</p>
<p>hormones for maximizing your growth and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t quote me on this but I&rsquo;ve put a</p>
<p>lot of kids on this and they just seem</p>
<p>to grow they just start getting there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a growth spurt and even kids that are</p>
<p>smaller of course you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>limit to how you can help I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>can grow based on your genetics but seem</p>
<p>to be every time i recommended this</p>
<p>product for these children they just</p>
<p>start growing especially if you want him</p>
<p>to sign up for the basketball team I</p>
<p>would put him up at two troph and PMG</p>
<p>but what would stop the growth of a</p>
<p>child would be to have foods that are</p>
<p>deficient in nutrients so all the all</p>
<p>the eating plans that I recommend and</p>
<p>out of this book for ketosis in him and</p>
<p>fasting is what he needs to do he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need to do anything different</p>
<p>you know high quality protein eggs</p>
<p>grass-fed beef things like that versus</p>
<p>low quality protein powder a lot of</p>
<p>vegetables huge amounts of salad are all</p>
<p>very essential healthy fats in the egg</p>
<p>yolk</p>
<p>the avocado the coconut oil all really</p>
<p>keep I would also have him take a really</p>
<p>high-quality sea kelp because the iodine</p>
<p>in there will also help growth as well</p>
<p>and a lot of the other trace minerals if</p>
<p>if a child is deficient in iodine they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t seem to grow their growth is</p>
<p>stunted so that&rsquo;s another really</p>
<p>important trace mineral but the two</p>
<p>atrophic sea kelp those two supplements</p>
<p>and put him on the program and of</p>
<p>recommending and I think he&rsquo;ll do quite</p>
<p>well you want to make sure he doesn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>the six meals today though just do three</p>
<p>meals really good meals trying to have a</p>
<p>snack because I was going to increase</p>
<p>insulin and actually inhibit growth</p>
<p>because insulin is the real inhibitor of</p>
<p>these hormones especially growth hormone</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to enhance growth from him</p>
<p>I would also watch some of my videos on</p>
<p>growth on them because that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>hormone he needs the increase okay Karen</p>
<p>over to you</p>
<p>okay good so I have Karen on YouTube and</p>
<p>she says she did a water fast for five</p>
<p>days and on day four her legs started to</p>
<p>cramp she wants to know she should add</p>
<p>salt to the water but I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably going to say something</p>
<p>different yeah if you&rsquo;re doing water</p>
<p>fast and especially if you&rsquo;re if you</p>
<p>have any type of insulin resistance or</p>
<p>hypoglycemic issues blood sugar issues</p>
<p>and you start going like four or five</p>
<p>day fast your body could start utilizing</p>
<p>you might not have enough stored</p>
<p>minerals basically because insulin</p>
<p>resistance allows prevents the</p>
<p>absorption of these minerals so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just you&rsquo;re experiencing a loss of trace</p>
<p>minerals I&rsquo;m sorry just electrolytes in</p>
<p>general I would probably do the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder I have to give you</p>
<p>all the trace minerals which will help</p>
<p>you but basically what you&rsquo;re doing is</p>
<p>telling your body you&rsquo;re not quite ready</p>
<p>to go that long with fasting especially</p>
<p>if you get cramps it&rsquo;s usually a</p>
<p>potassium deficiency maybe go three days</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s what I would do but yes you</p>
<p>do want to have more salts that will</p>
<p>help you but generally speaking cramps</p>
<p>are gonna be a potassium may be a</p>
<p>calcium issue may be a magnesium issue</p>
<p>possibly a sodium but not always okay</p>
<p>you have another question I do I have</p>
<p>Lori from Facebook</p>
<p>and she wants to know will fasting help</p>
<p>loose skin she lost a bunch of weight</p>
<p>and now she has some loose skin and</p>
<p>somewhere she heard about pickle juice</p>
<p>and coffee and she just wants to know</p>
<p>yeah advice if you mix pickle juice with</p>
<p>coffee no that don&rsquo;t mix this - that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very terrible but separately pickle</p>
<p>juice is really good for your your</p>
<p>system your your bacteria in your gut</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good acid coffee on the other end</p>
<p>is another story but yeah in a minute</p>
<p>fasting is the probably the best way to</p>
<p>tighten up your skin because again out</p>
<p>of all the things that stimulate growth</p>
<p>hormone which is the anti-aging hormone</p>
<p>and all the things that will stimulate</p>
<p>etapa G which is recycling of proteins</p>
<p>into new skin and muscle and ligament</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s intermittent fasting it&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>to do but now it she did the inter</p>
<p>minute fasting and she lost the weight</p>
<p>so now she&rsquo;s got the loose skin you want</p>
<p>to keep doing it I&rsquo;m a bad thing for a</p>
<p>long period of time yeah in fact that</p>
<p>brings up one point Karen that you</p>
<p>reminded me okay is that there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people that are getting they want to</p>
<p>actually start exercising and so they</p>
<p>they switch to this keto and in a</p>
<p>fasting program and all the sudden they</p>
<p>start actually exercise and they get</p>
<p>tired they run it a gas and so they do</p>
<p>carbo loading and they think they need</p>
<p>carbohydrates as their energy source no</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t what they need to do is do it</p>
<p>a little longer to get into this point</p>
<p>of true fat burning a true ketosis where</p>
<p>your body is fully adapted and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not cheating here and there you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consistently doing this over a period of</p>
<p>weeks to the point where now you do a</p>
<p>workout and you you have tons of energy</p>
<p>why because your body can easily switch</p>
<p>to fat-burning it doesn&rsquo;t have to have</p>
<p>this glitch in the system or you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>burning up your sugar and then now we</p>
<p>have to now you&rsquo;ve cheated or whatever</p>
<p>now listen it has to adjust back to the</p>
<p>fat burning again it takes three days</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fully in there you have lots of</p>
<p>energy and then you&rsquo;ll start seeing all</p>
<p>sorts of really cool changes with your</p>
<p>skin with your ligaments with your the</p>
<p>tone of your skin you won&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>sagging skin anymore you&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>looking youthful because you&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>real state of ketosis</p>
<p>okay yeah all right so hey Chris you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from California you had a question by</p>
<p>terminal fasting in blood thinners</p>
<p>yes go ahead</p>
<p>what was the question yes well first of</p>
<p>all thanks for taking my call</p>
<p>I started keto and it had been fastened</p>
<p>about three months ago I started with</p>
<p>the sixteen eight fast I have done a 20</p>
<p>to 24 28 and now I mean one mil day</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty high in fat some that gets</p>
<p>is a 23 one yeah</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve like an hour window so anyways I</p>
<p>want to try a thirty to five day fast</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m on a blood thinner</p>
<p>Eliquis and I&rsquo;m on a high blood blood</p>
<p>pressure medicine now I will tell you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost about fifty something pounds</p>
<p>and my blood pressure has gone down</p>
<p>tremendously so Wow</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just wonder if I can do the you know</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have to take food I don&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>food with the pills so can I do it fast</p>
<p>and without any problem you think</p>
<p>honestly check with your doctor I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re gonna have a problem I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>counterintuitive at all are</p>
<p>contraindicated at all because as you do</p>
<p>this you&rsquo;re fixing insulin resistance so</p>
<p>your arteries the elasticity in your</p>
<p>arteries the epithelial cell and the</p>
<p>arteries will start to heal and so then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have more elasticity you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>less blood pressure problems it should</p>
<p>come down nicely then your doctor can</p>
<p>wean you off that stuff it starves the</p>
<p>blood thinners I&rsquo;m guessing you might</p>
<p>have had a clot or something or atrial</p>
<p>fib or why do they put you in that blood</p>
<p>clot in my leg in one night long no one</p>
<p>the long gone though okay</p>
<p>hey just as a side note Chris I think</p>
<p>you there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s an enzyme called</p>
<p>Sarah peptides do some research on that</p>
<p>that is a really good enzyme you taken</p>
<p>an empty stomach to clean up any type of</p>
<p>extra proteins that you don&rsquo;t want in</p>
<p>your body like little little pieces of</p>
<p>sticky you know cloths or whatever so do</p>
<p>research Sarah pepper taste I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find some great stuff</p>
<p>there and there the one that I would</p>
<p>recommend I&rsquo;m not going</p>
<p>recommend a brand but you needed in</p>
<p>higher dosages like at least a hundred</p>
<p>and twenty thousand I use okay so take</p>
<p>that but as far as what you&rsquo;re doing I</p>
<p>think you can eventually come off the</p>
<p>medications with the help of your doc</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;re on the right path but</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re doing 23 hours and</p>
<p>fasting you can see a lot of positive</p>
<p>benefits with your body if you can do</p>
<p>that and there&rsquo;s nothing better that you</p>
<p>can do for your body unless you&rsquo;re you</p>
<p>know in addition to what you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>the quality of food nutrient-dense foods</p>
<p>so I think you&rsquo;re on the right path I</p>
<p>would just ride the wave and keep going</p>
<p>Chris thanks for your call hey Tim you</p>
<p>had a question you&rsquo;re from Los Angeles</p>
<p>go ahead what was your question hey</p>
<p>doctor by the way you do a really great</p>
<p>show I mean really enjoy it you&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>very professional listen potassium as</p>
<p>you mention a lot is very difficult to</p>
<p>get but I know that cream of tarter for</p>
<p>a teaspoon is like 500 grams of</p>
<p>potassium which seems to be a lot so I</p>
<p>make a morning shake you know with the</p>
<p>kale and spinach and all that stuff and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I drink you know around noon</p>
<p>or so but to add extra potassium can I</p>
<p>put a couple of teaspoons of that is</p>
<p>like a thousand milligrams of potassium</p>
<p>in addition to everything else that&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the blender yeah good questions him I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like that source of potassium I</p>
<p>mean it may work temporarily you can get</p>
<p>a potassium citrate in a powder form</p>
<p>that would be a better form i i have</p>
<p>something called electrolyte powder that</p>
<p>i use it as a thousand milligrams of</p>
<p>potassium citrate and it has all the</p>
<p>other minerals too so you&rsquo;re not just</p>
<p>taking Benassi &rsquo;m you&rsquo;re spiking it with</p>
<p>magnesium the trace minerals little</p>
<p>calcium a tiny bit of sodium with no</p>
<p>sugar and it tastes good so that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing you could spike it with or you can</p>
<p>just buy some potassium citrate and</p>
<p>spike it but anytime you do one specific</p>
<p>mineral at high dosages over a long</p>
<p>period of time out of the normal complex</p>
<p>you start throwing off other minerals</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the only little catch-22 I</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t like the source</p>
<p>potassium in cream of tarter but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what my recommendation thanks</p>
<p>Tim I appreciate it okay Karen okay well</p>
<p>first of all I want to thank all the</p>
<p>Facebook users because that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>ramping up and people really love</p>
<p>Facebook and make sure that you share so</p>
<p>people know that we&rsquo;re available on</p>
<p>Facebook and I just think it&rsquo;ll be fun</p>
<p>everybody should push the heart right</p>
<p>now see how many hearts go across I just</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s gonna be funny but yes we</p>
<p>have from Facebook doctor yes ears</p>
<p>asking a question does l-glutamate break</p>
<p>the fast absolutely not no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be a problem in fact any</p>
<p>supplements that you have are not going</p>
<p>to break the fast and the other thing is</p>
<p>that so yeah you don&rsquo;t worry about</p>
<p>supplements but let&rsquo;s say for example if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a carbohydrate supplement like like</p>
<p>if you go to the GNC or wall green well</p>
<p>there they have like ensure or they have</p>
<p>these glucose supplements well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna break the fast for sure and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not talking about that as a supplement I</p>
<p>think that I would not even recommend</p>
<p>that but the point is that if you take</p>
<p>any of the supplements it&rsquo;s not gonna</p>
<p>break the fast it&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>carbohydrate so you don&rsquo;t to worry about</p>
<p>it alright Shelly you&rsquo;re from Washington</p>
<p>State hi how are you I&rsquo;m 46 when years</p>
<p>old Hren</p>
<p>I had a hysterectomy a complete</p>
<p>hysterectomy when I was in my early 20s</p>
<p>I went over 20 years without hormones</p>
<p>about four years ago I had about 30</p>
<p>pounds of rapid weight loss I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been able to put it back on I have a lot</p>
<p>of muscle wasting loose skin I&rsquo;m trying</p>
<p>to rebuild my body I&rsquo;m concerned about</p>
<p>intermittent fasting should I just do</p>
<p>keto till I rebuild my body okay so</p>
<p>question the real important question</p>
<p>Shelly what part of Washington state are</p>
<p>you from</p>
<p>I live in East when it sorry you broke</p>
<p>up what was that North Central</p>
<p>Washington okay I practice in Lynnwood</p>
<p>Washington for six months but it just</p>
<p>rained too much I couldn&rsquo;t take it so I</p>
<p>moved to California for a little bit</p>
<p>okay you&rsquo;re breaking up a bit you break</p>
<p>it up okay so here&rsquo;s what you should do</p>
<p>Shelly if you&rsquo;re and this is really</p>
<p>common you went through an early</p>
<p>menopause situation because you had a</p>
<p>hysterectomy in your 20s this is a</p>
<p>really good question from any anyone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s watching going through menopause</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re female</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s happening is your adrenals</p>
<p>now are gonna have to take over take up</p>
<p>the slack of the ovaries the ovaries are</p>
<p>going a retirement and now the adrenals</p>
<p>have to kick in there so many women have</p>
<p>a situation where now they end up with a</p>
<p>higher fat ratio than muscle so they</p>
<p>lose muscle why because the cortisol</p>
<p>goes sky-high and that&rsquo;s the nature of</p>
<p>the adrenal and stress so you can have</p>
<p>to realize that it&rsquo;s gonna take a while</p>
<p>to build that back up it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve asked you a process and you</p>
<p>have thinning of the bones well atrophy</p>
<p>is thinning of the muscle fibers so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to build that back up</p>
<p>so in a minute fasting is gonna be</p>
<p>crucial to build that back up and you</p>
<p>would think that not eating as frequent</p>
<p>would you would lose more muscle it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just the opposite you&rsquo;re gonna protect</p>
<p>your muscles grow more muscle because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna stimulate growth form them</p>
<p>doing Aikido is essential keeping the</p>
<p>carbohydrates low and having really good</p>
<p>nutrient-dense things and then then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to add exercise in</p>
<p>there very slowly and gradually over a</p>
<p>long period of time to start stimulating</p>
<p>the muscle to get it to grow and you may</p>
<p>hit plateaus when you&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>because as you grow muscle it&rsquo;s heavier</p>
<p>than fat so even though you&rsquo;re shrinking</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gaining more muscle mass the</p>
<p>weight is Plateau don&rsquo;t worry about that</p>
<p>just go by your strength go by your</p>
<p>overall health and just keep doing it</p>
<p>because it could take up to six months</p>
<p>to a year before you start seeing some</p>
<p>significant change thanks for your</p>
<p>question Shelley</p>
<p>all right Karen okay good so we have</p>
<p>Lauren on YouTube and she says this time</p>
<p>of year her hands and her feet are</p>
<p>always freezing even though our house</p>
<p>her apartment is cranked up with the</p>
<p>heat so what can she do diet wise that</p>
<p>will change that</p>
<p>I know sometimes just on keto that can</p>
<p>happen that you can get cold right right</p>
<p>well first of all you live in Alaska so</p>
<p>you need to move down to the Mojave</p>
<p>Desert that will help you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the other thing that</p>
<p>happens during the winter yes you have</p>
<p>temperature changes other variables</p>
<p>could be that you just start</p>
<p>intermittent fasting you are going to</p>
<p>get a little colder it doesn&rsquo;t mean your</p>
<p>metabolism is slowing down it just means</p>
<p>that your body is adjusting to this and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s becoming more conservative so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not generating a wasting Heat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s becoming more efficient I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>so that does happen now the other thing</p>
<p>that you can do is start taking vitamin</p>
<p>D because one thing you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>get now is a lot of sunlight even if you</p>
<p>did stand outside in the winter and try</p>
<p>to get some Sun in your face it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna happen you&rsquo;re not gonna get enough</p>
<p>vitamin D so you want to start taking in</p>
<p>a supplement to start to bring back in</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re missing from the winner and</p>
<p>that hormonal e is going to help you</p>
<p>warm up a little bit so because if your</p>
<p>vitamin D D deficient you will get cold</p>
<p>okay Karen okay I have another one and</p>
<p>we have to say again just in case</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re there watching from Iceland</p>
<p>Timmy and cocoa thank you</p>
<p>Coco&rsquo;s 8 years old and she&rsquo;s learning</p>
<p>how to eat right by watching dr. Berg</p>
<p>and using our recipes to make pancakes</p>
<p>and things like that so good job girl</p>
<p>keep it going so we have on Facebook</p>
<p>Sandra is asking is all of this</p>
<p>information in your book now only and</p>
<p>only partially it&rsquo;s enough no just want</p>
<p>to show you this is if you go to the</p>
<p>website these two come together you can</p>
<p>get an Amazon but you don&rsquo;t get this you</p>
<p>have to get this separately so this is a</p>
<p>really quick way to jump in and</p>
<p>just learn the basics has pictures takes</p>
<p>45 minutes read this study it start then</p>
<p>fill in the blank with this right here</p>
<p>this book has a lot of information it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a new updated recently and this brings</p>
<p>up a point I just did a seminar in every</p>
<p>single chapter it&rsquo;s 19 chapters that</p>
<p>took me a long time that&rsquo;s an exciting</p>
<p>because an exciting product because I</p>
<p>had to read this book again and I</p>
<p>actually was quite impressed I was like</p>
<p>wow this is a pretty good book what you</p>
<p>read your book yeah it was it was a lot</p>
<p>of great day tonight here because I took</p>
<p>me seven years to initially create this</p>
<p>and in another thousand hours to upgrade</p>
<p>it but then to read it again I was like</p>
<p>well someone actually read this they</p>
<p>would get a lot of great data you should</p>
<p>read it</p>
<p>I 157 images I&rsquo;m waiting for the</p>
<p>movie well I have it on video now okay</p>
<p>but this is I haven&rsquo;t like it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>like a new product it&rsquo;s not not that</p>
<p>expensive you I&rsquo;m not gonna post it</p>
<p>quite yet it probably probably on the</p>
<p>first or the second of January it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>ready maybe it&rsquo;d be ready tomorrow I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s coming up real</p>
<p>soon but it comes with a USB and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be able to download the files the audio</p>
<p>files onto your cellphone you can listen</p>
<p>to it when you&rsquo;re we are you drive</p>
<p>driving walking what you can hear dr.</p>
<p>bury me in the noggin 24/7 you should</p>
<p>have one of those little pillow</p>
<p>microphones then what you could do is</p>
<p>you can actually have access to the</p>
<p>videos as well online so you can watch</p>
<p>all the different chapters and the</p>
<p>summary of all the different things that</p>
<p>you need to focus on for those of you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to watch it but the audio is</p>
<p>cool now it does just go to Android but</p>
<p>you can get a little adapter for five</p>
<p>dollars which we also sell and then you</p>
<p>can watch on your iPhone so that way you</p>
<p>have different ways to access the audio</p>
<p>which is gonna be very cool so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of a new thing that it&rsquo;s gonna come</p>
<p>down the pike so I&rsquo;ll sound it tuned but</p>
<p>I hope you appreciate it cuz I took a</p>
<p>long time to do those videos so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to Gale from there</p>
<p>Ochs Indiana you had a question go ahead</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>so just I&rsquo;m excited I&rsquo;ve been fond y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>for so long so this past year I went</p>
<p>from 289 down to 208 graduation I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really excited but we have come against</p>
<p>two situations - I have two questions if</p>
<p>I could</p>
<p>the first one is I am a truck driver I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>48 years old I have great health and my</p>
<p>salads I packed them big just like you</p>
<p>say and I bring my little tuna packets</p>
<p>and all my delicious toppings for my</p>
<p>salad it&rsquo;s a good salad and in three or</p>
<p>four days it&rsquo;s all rotten and I&rsquo;m out</p>
<p>there for 10 days and so all my money</p>
<p>goes down the drain and stuck eating</p>
<p>these fake hamburger patties at these</p>
<p>checks that&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>else I&rsquo;m gonna eat are you saying that</p>
<p>the truck stops don&rsquo;t have huge salad</p>
<p>bars consistent iceberg lettuce unless</p>
<p>you find this that way and then you can</p>
<p>be like I can say can I get three</p>
<p>quarters of an inch and one quarter</p>
<p>iceberg that&rsquo;s the best salad I can get</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m on the road generally speaking</p>
<p>so I I have a question</p>
<p>is it possible that you can put some</p>
<p>type of mini refrigerator or freezer in</p>
<p>your truck I don&rsquo;t know absolutely we do</p>
<p>My partner and I it goes to but it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t keep well so I know the cat will</p>
<p>you have sorry yeah go ahead</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s the point yeah you can use</p>
<p>the cruciferous as a way to enhance and</p>
<p>the wheatgrass juice powder that will</p>
<p>actually give you a nice boost for sure</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll feel a difference on that but</p>
<p>what I would do is if I were you is I</p>
<p>would pack your freezer with frozen kale</p>
<p>take it out blend it with water to the</p>
<p>way because we have a freezer filled</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>frozen kale and you could pack it down</p>
<p>good into right I&rsquo;ve heard that yeah and</p>
<p>then you get you shake so you drink your</p>
<p>salad so that way it stores a lot longer</p>
<p>can you have a blender though yeah you</p>
<p>can have a blender you have electricity</p>
<p>right yeah yeah so I can so dude the</p>
<p>freezer and then the other thing that I</p>
<p>would do is that if you&rsquo;re traveling</p>
<p>around the country of course you got the</p>
<p>main roads you ain&rsquo;t got the trucks</p>
<p>stuff you know and I know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably on deadlines but maybe there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>strategically you can plan out certain</p>
<p>stores along the way that our bigger</p>
<p>grocery stores that you could go to this</p>
<p>salad maybe it&rsquo;s off the beaten path</p>
<p>sometimes they have that it might delay</p>
<p>your trip but what I would do is I would</p>
<p>freeze that kale if you looked at our</p>
<p>freezer right now it is just packed with</p>
<p>frozen kale that&rsquo;s probably two months</p>
<p>old and it&rsquo;s still good you just put it</p>
<p>in the blender add water put a little</p>
<p>berries blend it up and you can drink</p>
<p>your salad for the whole day but then</p>
<p>dr. Berg what about also the wheatgrass</p>
<p>juice powder yeah yeah you can add that</p>
<p>as well but you still need to have some</p>
<p>salad but I do know salad is very</p>
<p>perishable what about what about making</p>
<p>kale chips like baking drying no because</p>
<p>then you you&rsquo;re gonna heat it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna kill the enzymes okay thank you so</p>
<p>much for following us Gail I appreciate</p>
<p>that so we know we have we a from</p>
<p>Tennessee get a question you&rsquo;re diabetic</p>
<p>right yes I am thank you so much for</p>
<p>taking my call</p>
<p>sure I&rsquo;ve been a diabetic for quite a</p>
<p>while and I&rsquo;ve been following the a DEA</p>
<p>recommendations and end of September I</p>
<p>was admitted to the hospital with</p>
<p>ketoacidosis and as soon as I got</p>
<p>discharged</p>
<p>I found your videos on YouTube and I</p>
<p>started on keto diet immediately and</p>
<p>about a month and a half ago I switched</p>
<p>over to intermittent fasting with keto</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been doing once a day once a</p>
<p>day and my blood sugar went from an</p>
<p>average of 260 something to about 122</p>
<p>and I was doing really well</p>
<p>and about almost two weeks ago I got up</p>
<p>one morning and my sugar was really high</p>
<p>it was probably about 170 180 and um I</p>
<p>was alarmed you know because it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>down to 122 or even lower and so that</p>
<p>has been going on for almost two weeks</p>
<p>now every day and I&rsquo;m still doing the</p>
<p>Kido I&rsquo;m still doing the iaf I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sticking really close to your eating</p>
<p>recommendations you mentioned that</p>
<p>protein from three to five ounces per</p>
<p>meal and I only do one so I usually</p>
<p>stare on for five getting my vegetables</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing your potassium I&rsquo;m taking</p>
<p>decayed magnesium calcium trace minerals</p>
<p>whatever I can put in there but my blood</p>
<p>sugar is still high and I was doing some</p>
<p>search online they were saying that</p>
<p>sometimes your liver has a excess of</p>
<p>glucose that they dump out periodically</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just wondering if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening to me or is it something else</p>
<p>that I need to address okay I&rsquo;m up</p>
<p>yeah and also I&rsquo;ve had a hysterectomy a</p>
<p>couple of years ago and I&rsquo;m 51 going on</p>
<p>52 years soon okay so I&rsquo;m not really</p>
<p>sure if that has anything to do with it</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your take okay are you taking my</p>
<p>week crap my nutritional yeast tablets</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not but I do the UM 145 nutritional</p>
<p>yeast powder okay that I got from Amazon</p>
<p>okay good so here&rsquo;s what you have to do</p>
<p>take more of the powder okay because the</p>
<p>nutrition use has the B vitamins take</p>
<p>like six teaspoons of that powder a day</p>
<p>okay you can get them in tablets if you</p>
<p>want but just you just do to keep doing</p>
<p>the powder you needed a lot of that</p>
<p>nutritional yeast now in this situation</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s several things that I would do</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing great everything&rsquo;s good but</p>
<p>it still needs to come down I would go</p>
<p>get a test an a1c and really measure and</p>
<p>see if your a1c is coming down</p>
<p>also is your waste coming down are you</p>
<p>plateauing</p>
<p>the fact that you had ketoacidosis means</p>
<p>that you had some serious diabetes going</p>
<p>on at one time and in that what that is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very unhealthy way to get into</p>
<p>ketosis where your your pH is so acidic</p>
<p>it could be very damaging to your body</p>
<p>so you want to quickly start alkalizing</p>
<p>the body because it&rsquo;s so acidic and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve probably got through that fine</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;re doing a lot better your</p>
<p>prompt you&rsquo;re completely out of that</p>
<p>situation and now we have to do to tweak</p>
<p>it so what I would do is I would add</p>
<p>more nutritional yeast I would also add</p>
<p>exercise into the mix exercise is</p>
<p>another great tool to take your insulin</p>
<p>problem to the next level it&rsquo;ll actually</p>
<p>help help your blood Sugar&rsquo;s it will</p>
<p>actually help even reverse insulin</p>
<p>resistance it will help stimulate the</p>
<p>muscles to work better with to sensitize</p>
<p>glucose so that&rsquo;s some things that would</p>
<p>do I would also add probably some seek</p>
<p>help into the mix because trace minerals</p>
<p>are really essential as far as you</p>
<p>having a hysterectomy or going through</p>
<p>menopause that that&rsquo;s another little</p>
<p>factor because probably even the liver</p>
<p>still needs some work or your your</p>
<p>adrenals are really causing the spike in</p>
<p>this blood sugar so you may want to do</p>
<p>the acupressure technique that I have</p>
<p>online to help your adrenals and that</p>
<p>will help so either that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>solve it or supporting liver with</p>
<p>something like some type of liver</p>
<p>nutrient type thing I think will be a</p>
<p>good liver nutrient you can do the</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables that would be</p>
<p>good milk thistle would be a really good</p>
<p>herb to take and then that way you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>either gonna drop it that way or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be the adrenal I think it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>liver or adrenal that&rsquo;s still an issue</p>
<p>because you sounds like you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>everything else right okay so just give</p>
<p>it more time check those two things and</p>
<p>one last thing about the American</p>
<p>Diabetes Association which is incredible</p>
<p>because they do not acknowledge this</p>
<p>relationship between</p>
<p>sugar is causing the diabetic thing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still undecided of course</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sponsors and partners with the</p>
<p>food industry in the drug industry</p>
<p>unfortunately but in 1971 the ad a</p>
<p>recommended about 40% of your calories</p>
<p>coming from carbohydrate but then in</p>
<p>1984 they spiked it up to 60% of your</p>
<p>car behind your calories should be</p>
<p>carbohydrates so they went 45 to 60 okay</p>
<p>and then in nineteen and then in the 90s</p>
<p>they recommended that they said well you</p>
<p>can be more flexible and add a lot more</p>
<p>sucrose to this plan to be able to be</p>
<p>part of that 60% carbohydrate well if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s giving the basic information that</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s filtering down they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a chance to get rid of their</p>
<p>diabetes they&rsquo;re just going to be stuck</p>
<p>so now they&rsquo;re stuck with managing their</p>
<p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s with balancing their</p>
<p>calories of blood with their medication</p>
<p>and then all the list of medications</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna get so unfortunately it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very bad information and and there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>so called experts so story had to go</p>
<p>through that but I&rsquo;m glad that you have</p>
<p>the truth right now so thanks for</p>
<p>watching and I&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>better hey Steve you&rsquo;re from San</p>
<p>Francisco you had a question about</p>
<p>bulletproof coffee go ahead yeah I&rsquo;m 52</p>
<p>years old and started your ketogenic and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting suggestions in</p>
<p>October I lost by Thanksgiving I&rsquo;d lost</p>
<p>thirty pounds</p>
<p>Wow so I was doing really well I did</p>
<p>break the diet plan over Thanksgiving</p>
<p>unfortunately but I got back on plan but</p>
<p>then I seemed to stall I like I</p>
<p>plateaued and I&rsquo;m wondering because I</p>
<p>just saw a video that you put out about</p>
<p>bulletproof coffee that you suggested it</p>
<p>in the beginning it was good to extend</p>
<p>your fast up until your first meal but</p>
<p>if I continue to drink some of that</p>
<p>coffee between my meals and does that</p>
<p>count as snacking</p>
<p>it depends my sabotage in my home it</p>
<p>depends on what&rsquo;s in the coffee</p>
<p>how much coffee but yeah if you do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I always recommend doing one</p>
<p>cup of coffee because if you start</p>
<p>adding more coffee you&rsquo;ll even affect</p>
<p>like you all of a sudden you get a</p>
<p>little hungry what happened with that</p>
<p>you got the caffeine that stimulates the</p>
<p>adrenals</p>
<p>there goes cortisol and there goes</p>
<p>insulin spike and now we we&rsquo;ve dropped</p>
<p>the blood sugars down and because we</p>
<p>have a release of sugar through the</p>
<p>liver so yeah coffee anything more than</p>
<p>one is not going to be good for your</p>
<p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>does that count with ki as well if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>caffeinated yeah that&rsquo;s right not as</p>
<p>much less caffeine but I do like a</p>
<p>naturally decaffeinated tea so yeah okay</p>
<p>cuz in between my meals sometimes I</p>
<p>drink a throw to tea and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>caffeinated</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a licorice root yeah so try to find</p>
<p>something you got then yeah thank you</p>
<p>very much you&rsquo;re welcome thanks Steve</p>
<p>and I just wanted to say I want you guys</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on Facebook or YouTube to</p>
<p>definitely share this information if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on facebook go to youtube if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on youtube go to facebook cuz i</p>
<p>have different information I even have</p>
<p>some new videos on Instagram so you can</p>
<p>go there and check that out it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>new content and then I also wanted to</p>
<p>bring up one thing that you may be</p>
<p>interested in I&rsquo;m gonna be starting on</p>
<p>Facebook kind of a closed group that we</p>
<p>can invite you it&rsquo;s gonna be a keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting lab where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>almost like a research thing where we</p>
<p>can try different things and share</p>
<p>different results if you want to</p>
<p>participate stay tuned because I&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>you more information real soon but I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;ll be great to present ideas</p>
<p>for people to test out and then have a</p>
<p>large group of people to try things and</p>
<p>then see how it works we can all learn</p>
<p>from being guinea pigs I&rsquo;m sorry just</p>
<p>like being people that can participate</p>
<p>in this</p>
<p>all right so stay tuned for that Karen</p>
<p>do you have a quick question if you have</p>
<p>a quick answer I have several questions</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>okay so this is quick Gaul I believe it</p>
<p>is from YouTube asks what is the</p>
<p>healthiest sugar</p>
<p>yeah well stevia would be the best sugar</p>
<p>actually they&rsquo;re asking sugar actual</p>
<p>sugar actual sugar which form of actual</p>
<p>sugar is the healthiest well that would</p>
<p>be a simple answer zero sugar but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing you have sugar that has</p>
<p>vitamins with it like sugar cane actual</p>
<p>chewing on sugar cane would be the best</p>
<p>thing because you&rsquo;re getting a lot of</p>
<p>potassium there&rsquo;s a lot of potassium</p>
<p>sugar cane the problem is you probably</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t get cavities and you probably</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t even get diabetes but still it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m recommending but</p>
<p>refined sugar is really really bad</p>
<p>molasses would be really really I mean</p>
<p>comparatively speaking better so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna say I&rsquo;m gonna go with molasses</p>
<p>okay but no answer no well I&rsquo;m gonna add</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna add to that I&rsquo;ve got stay away</p>
<p>from Agathe okay because that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>nanny</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s worse than almost of high</p>
<p>fructose corn syrup because it has like</p>
<p>97% fructose which will totally put you</p>
<p>into an insulin resistant situation okay</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>farinelli now for a quick answer</p>
<p>Facebook Cheryl is asking about</p>
<p>melatonin how do you feel about using</p>
<p>melatonin to get to sleep</p>
<p>yeah it Milutin is a hormone by the</p>
<p>pineal up in your brain and and the</p>
<p>melatonin basically is stimulated by</p>
<p>darkness so it actually helps you sleep</p>
<p>a problem is when you take it long-term</p>
<p>you kind of in activates your own pineal</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t recommend taking</p>
<p>hormones unless you absolutely need to</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna it comes with a</p>
<p>package now all the sudden you need more</p>
<p>and more to keep to keep the same effect</p>
<p>so what I would do is instead of taking</p>
<p>the Lehtonen honestly I would there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple things that I recommend</p>
<p>a regular basis and their base it&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>products that I have one is the the</p>
<p>sleep aid formula I take that often do I</p>
<p>take that can every day every night</p>
<p>every night yeah it&rsquo;s I take one</p>
<p>but a half hour probably of sleep and</p>
<p>ma&rsquo;am I go right into a sleep there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>melatonin there&rsquo;s nothing in there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna make you feel groggy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing addictive it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>blend that I figured out really helps</p>
<p>the adrenal chill out so you can drift</p>
<p>off into a sleep and I&rsquo;ve went through</p>
<p>many different formulas so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably what what I would recommend</p>
<p>instead of melatonin because the</p>
<p>melatonin it works but initially you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take more and more and it comes</p>
<p>with the package okay</p>
<p>now that leads right into my next</p>
<p>question what are your thoughts and I</p>
<p>know you&rsquo;re not a medical doctor and</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t medical information and this</p>
<p>is all opinions and things like that but</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on hormone</p>
<p>replacement therapy okay my medical</p>
<p>opinion on that yeah here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the problem with and this is really</p>
<p>interesting question because people say</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m deficient in a hormone I had a</p>
<p>test I&rsquo;m deficient so naturally I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna take hormones to replace it it</p>
<p>makes logical sense but what they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize is the endocrine system is a</p>
<p>very complex system and as soon as you</p>
<p>add in this hormone this other hormone</p>
<p>shifts and also hormones are</p>
<p>communications so the more hormones that</p>
<p>you take it&rsquo;s going to inactivate the</p>
<p>gland that makes it especially the</p>
<p>thyroid so if you&rsquo;re taking a hormone</p>
<p>externally that your body&rsquo;s not having</p>
<p>to produce then your glands can go to</p>
<p>sleep and then now you need more and</p>
<p>more to create the same effect I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>recommending it unless you&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>everything else and then maybe but it</p>
<p>comes with a package you&rsquo;re gonna know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing and the other thing is</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t why don&rsquo;t you just support the</p>
<p>gland support the gland that makes the</p>
<p>hormone that way you&rsquo;re not in</p>
<p>activating the whole hormone system and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you honestly the the endocrine</p>
<p>system there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no one that that</p>
<p>I know that if just reading through all</p>
<p>the even the endocrinologist they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really understand it yet they really</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand it so anyone says I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>an expert in it well it&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>unknowns it&rsquo;s so complex yeah they know</p>
<p>some data but the data them using as as</p>
<p>soon as you start taking hormones you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna inactivate the gland that makes it</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s enough for me to say well</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just try another way</p>
<p>like why did it go why do you need</p>
<p>hormones in the first place why did the</p>
<p>glands shut down that&rsquo;s the question</p>
<p>graduate okay good</p>
<p>I I know you want to take a phone call</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you well I do I have one more on</p>
<p>Facebook I think this is a good one Joan</p>
<p>is asking she&rsquo;s been on keto for about</p>
<p>four weeks she lost weight steadily she</p>
<p>just recently after breakfast started to</p>
<p>feel nauseous or nauseated and is</p>
<p>feeling sleepy mid morning and she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>losing stomach fat 65 years old what is</p>
<p>happening did I miss something did she</p>
<p>doing in a minute fasting she&rsquo;s been on</p>
<p>keto so that&rsquo;s a good point she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say she&rsquo;s doing intermittent fasting she</p>
<p>says keto yeah see keto in itself is</p>
<p>high fat low carb moderate protein so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you do keto and you&rsquo;re and you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t digest all that fat it&rsquo;s gonna put</p>
<p>a big strain on that gallbladder and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna feel nauseous</p>
<p>the nauseousness is the gallbladder</p>
<p>symptom so that&rsquo;s probably what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening so I would naturally give the</p>
<p>gallbladder rest by doing in a minute</p>
<p>fasting and that way you can eat less</p>
<p>frequent and not have the situation now</p>
<p>what happens when you even do in a</p>
<p>minute fasting your body starts burning</p>
<p>fat and now all that fat from the fat</p>
<p>sale Karen has to come to the blood and</p>
<p>come out to the liver so now you</p>
<p>actually have a lot more fat being</p>
<p>processed by the gallbladder and that</p>
<p>alone can create nauseousness especially</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t eat enough vegetables okay</p>
<p>so if you actually what I would do is I</p>
<p>would add more vegetables do intimate</p>
<p>fasting and you should be fine and then</p>
<p>make sure that you&rsquo;re not eating unless</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hungry because there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>people that get in the fat burning also</p>
<p>now they&rsquo;re not hungry at all but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still eating three meals a day</p>
<p>or even two meals a day I would go to</p>
<p>one meal a day just eat when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hungry well it&rsquo;s hard to with social</p>
<p>situations and the holidays and things</p>
<p>like that</p>
<p>well so I understand I&rsquo;m just saying um</p>
<p>this understand I&rsquo;m just the messenger</p>
<p>you know what I&rsquo;m talking about I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>the messenger okay okay all right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go to roll up from Chicago you</p>
<p>had a question about the best</p>
<p>supplements for polycystic ovarian</p>
<p>syndrome yeah um I I was diagnosed with</p>
<p>polycystic ovarian syndrome</p>
<p>years ago and I did some reading on it I</p>
<p>know kind of you know what kind of diet</p>
<p>I should be on and on but I just wanted</p>
<p>to get your input about supplements and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this matters but they</p>
<p>just find fasting glucose and it was 72</p>
<p>so I guess that means I&rsquo;m a nun and so</p>
<p>it was just my PCOS I&rsquo;m not sure good</p>
<p>question okay so let&rsquo;s talk about this I</p>
<p>like the fact that your blood sugars are</p>
<p>that low because usually what causes</p>
<p>polycystic ovarian syndrome which by the</p>
<p>way is a situation where your androgens</p>
<p>are going very high okay so that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>male hormone so you get facial hair Ella</p>
<p>pshew alopecia which is hair loss and</p>
<p>then midsection weight so what I would</p>
<p>do if I were you I would do seek help</p>
<p>that would be a really good one for the</p>
<p>ovary and see if that helps you but just</p>
<p>realize what&rsquo;s really behind most cases</p>
<p>of PCOS would be high insulin so even</p>
<p>know your blood sugars are that low the</p>
<p>doctors never test insulin fasting</p>
<p>insulin levels so think about it let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say the blood sugars are low and you</p>
<p>have hypoglycemia well what do you</p>
<p>think&rsquo;s happening to the insulin it</p>
<p>could be high pushing the blood sugars</p>
<p>down so you so it&rsquo;s really still a</p>
<p>problem with high insulin so I would</p>
<p>actually go get a test for for fasting</p>
<p>insulin and test that and that&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>then we know you need to support high</p>
<p>insulin with the keto in a minute</p>
<p>fasting but also as far as supplements</p>
<p>go chromium is really good potassium is</p>
<p>really good the B vitamins are really</p>
<p>good to bring down high levels of</p>
<p>insulin so that&rsquo;s why I have a keto kit</p>
<p>it has the electrolyte powder the B</p>
<p>vitamins and the wheatgrass that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good to support healthy insulin</p>
<p>levels okay thanks for the question no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good question Jennifer</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Ireland go ahead you had a</p>
<p>question um thing happens I&rsquo;m an element</p>
<p>under cater to meet the head we&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>at the age of 29 and after two weeks are</p>
<p>we</p>
<p>so our half going crazy like Sir Paul</p>
<p>such a happy but very strong sometimes</p>
<p>it woke us up we couldn&rsquo;t even sleep</p>
<p>we ate lots of matcha tea with lots of</p>
<p>carry lots of potassium we really made</p>
<p>sure to to follow your advice but so</p>
<p>this happened and then we got scared and</p>
<p>we stopped and now my boyfriend still</p>
<p>have to dislike high pulse and I was</p>
<p>wondering what did would you want and</p>
<p>how can we take this good question yeah</p>
<p>okay so I just did a video on high pulse</p>
<p>rate hi Paul straight can also come from</p>
<p>a b1 deficiency so you need nutritional</p>
<p>yeast okay you can get in a tablet or</p>
<p>get in the powder nutritional yeast is</p>
<p>the best source of be one that will</p>
<p>bring the pulse room down it could also</p>
<p>be low potassium now you&rsquo;re adding all</p>
<p>the vegetables which is great so but you</p>
<p>may need to add but potassium on top of</p>
<p>that to bring that down even more and</p>
<p>then the last thing that you want to</p>
<p>check would be the inability to digest</p>
<p>some of the fats which I know if it</p>
<p>plugs up the gallbladder that can also</p>
<p>raise the pulse rate so look at maybe</p>
<p>cut down the dietary fats maybe or we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>add in a minute fasting to space it out</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not straining the gallbladder</p>
<p>either nutritional yeast a potassium</p>
<p>that should that should help you okay</p>
<p>Jennifer dr. Burke yes we have to wrap</p>
<p>up soon but I&rsquo;d wanted to ask you about</p>
<p>your new year&rsquo;s resolutions is it</p>
<p>do you have does the dr. Berg dream for</p>
<p>the future is it always about nutrition</p>
<p>is it about what lettuce you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>buy well ma you want to talk about my</p>
<p>new I just like my advice on it no we</p>
<p>want to know about you okay so as far as</p>
<p>myself good I mean honestly I I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a lot of bad habits so I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>going to necessarily have to give up</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m gonna do is I&rsquo;m just gonna step</p>
<p>it up with my exercise and really take</p>
<p>to the next level and I&rsquo;m working on it</p>
<p>I want to be able to do a lot of</p>
<p>pull-ups sit-ups all the basic things so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really my goal for this year now</p>
<p>I did bust my elbow my shoulder and now</p>
<p>really what&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m rehabbing which</p>
<p>is taking a lot longer than I would like</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s ask what would be your New</p>
<p>Year&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s resolution Karen but</p>
<p>what do you wanna uh looking forward to</p>
<p>seeing you next week that&rsquo;s a wrap no I</p>
<p>think for my New Year&rsquo;s resolution</p>
<p>you know I say this all the time I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>naturally fit I&rsquo;m not naturally thin I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not as disciplined as the good dr. Berg</p>
<p>so I need to be more disciplined and be</p>
<p>more disciplined with my intermittent</p>
<p>fasting I think is the thing and I too</p>
<p>you know we are working out now we are</p>
<p>getting stronger and I want to do a</p>
<p>pull-up without it with no assistance</p>
<p>you up there I wanna do push-ups and</p>
<p>pull-ups I just want to be really</p>
<p>physically strong I want to be leaner so</p>
<p>I think the key to that is I probably</p>
<p>have to just be more disciplined with my</p>
<p>internet and fast</p>
<p>I like that okay good and also we have</p>
<p>Steve over there&rsquo;s gonna be starting</p>
<p>Steve first we&rsquo;re Harry Harry&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>on the program but he&rsquo;s gonna be more he</p>
<p>travels a lot so that&rsquo;s an issue we tell</p>
<p>them what their news resolutions that</p>
<p>and then what I want everyone I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>take call it the last call from Derek</p>
<p>but what I want everyone to do if you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t mind is type in the comment</p>
<p>below what you&rsquo;re going to do is your</p>
<p>resolution I want to know about it we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna read all the comments today cause</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of hearts cuz that was</p>
<p>awesome Facebook rocked the hearts that</p>
<p>was hysterical okay Derek here from New</p>
<p>York go ahead you had a question dr.</p>
<p>Burke thank you very much and happy</p>
<p>healthy New Year to you and Karen as</p>
<p>well thanks dr. Berg I spoke to you</p>
<p>actually last week in regards to my</p>
<p>situation I&rsquo;m not on the keto or the</p>
<p>intimate fastening and that&rsquo;s due to</p>
<p>just what I&rsquo;m going through I do have</p>
<p>your book I do have the gallbladder</p>
<p>formula wheatgrass I have a gallbladder</p>
<p>situation that just manifested recently</p>
<p>some sludge in the gallbladder and you</p>
<p>told me to take some bile salts but and</p>
<p>I do have your gall</p>
<p>for me along with some other bile salts</p>
<p>other people gave me now I&rsquo;m not really</p>
<p>thinking of taking that but I wanted to</p>
<p>get your advice I do have some minimal</p>
<p>erosive in the duodenum and minimal</p>
<p>erosive and try tiss I do have your</p>
<p>wheatgrass I just started drinking that</p>
<p>just for the stomach lining I also do</p>
<p>bone broth for that but my main issue</p>
<p>with the gall bladder is that I feel</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve been constipated and I feel</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s really what what&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>backing me up and in a video that you</p>
<p>did where you say it&rsquo;s kind of like the</p>
<p>chicken or the egg</p>
<p>where constipation can cause you know</p>
<p>congested gall bladder or bile</p>
<p>deficiency could be the reason of you</p>
<p>know the constipation because it</p>
<p>lubricates the colon so I kinda need</p>
<p>help here and I know I also don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what to eat</p>
<p>I also been on a low-fat low-calorie</p>
<p>diet which is not good</p>
<p>but my meals are basically you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to kind of do something like like</p>
<p>your program but it&rsquo;s not really there I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if I can eat eggs avocados</p>
<p>because I heard that could be</p>
<p>symptomatic people so I&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>basically salad with salmon you know</p>
<p>three times a day i was i was using</p>
<p>chicken and turkey not turkey you know</p>
<p>like real turkey organic everything</p>
<p>organic yeah I just don&rsquo;t know what to</p>
<p>do give you some good advice okay okay</p>
<p>alright so what I&rsquo;m gonna wreck what you</p>
<p>have to realize is if you have</p>
<p>constipation and you have sludge in the</p>
<p>gallbladder then we know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient and bile so now you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>bile salts which is great because</p>
<p>deficiency of bile will cause</p>
<p>constipation if you take too much bile</p>
<p>you loosen up everything in your in your</p>
<p>gut so at this point if you still are</p>
<p>constipated with taking the bile salts I</p>
<p>would go to this store and get a</p>
<p>laxative regardless of any type of</p>
<p>consideration you have because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got to keep the bowels going to keep the</p>
<p>draining of the</p>
<p>the gallbladder flowing through there</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want any stuck flows in your</p>
<p>liver or your body now the big thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re missing is the intermittent</p>
<p>fasting because every time you eat</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re increased insulin insulin is</p>
<p>going to create more sludge in the</p>
<p>gallbladder what stimulates the bile is</p>
<p>saturated fats so I don&rsquo;t even want you</p>
<p>to start adding more fats to this unless</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eliminating and you&rsquo;re going I</p>
<p>think the first step would be do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting do it just do two</p>
<p>meals a day and try to keep them at 12</p>
<p>and 5 ok 5 o&rsquo;clock I think if you did</p>
<p>that you would have a lot of benefits</p>
<p>and you can do the active pressure on</p>
<p>the gall butter too then after you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing in a minute fasting then start</p>
<p>adding a little bit of like egg yolk and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to create more of a</p>
<p>problem it&rsquo;s going to stimulate your own</p>
<p>livers ability to release the bile and I</p>
<p>would stay with that for a long period</p>
<p>of time keep the vegetables high the</p>
<p>inflammation in your colon that you have</p>
<p>is going to be healed as you do intimate</p>
<p>fasting because now you&rsquo;re gonna drop</p>
<p>insulin and that&rsquo;s going to really speed</p>
<p>up the healing of the lining of the</p>
<p>colon with the wheatgrass is going to</p>
<p>help that support that as well so those</p>
<p>are the answers that I would recommend</p>
<p>and thank you</p>
<p>Happy New Year thank you Facebook</p>
<p>YouTube share share we&rsquo;re gonna help you</p>
<p>next year as much as we can have a great</p>
<p>new year we&rsquo;re gonna see you next year</p>
<p>okay don&rsquo;t do anything don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>anything I wouldn&rsquo;t be okay okay right</p>
<p>back on the program alright guys have a</p>
<p>great one</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you</p>
