    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Aliyah Crum.</p>
<p>Dr. Crum is a tenured professor of psychology</p>
<p>at Stanford University,</p>
<p>and the founder and director</p>
<p>of the Stanford Mind and Body Lab.</p>
<p>Her work focuses on mindsets,</p>
<p>how what we think and what we believe</p>
<p>shapes the way that our physiology, our biology,</p>
<p>reacts to things like what we eat or stress or exercise.</p>
<p>Indeed, as you will soon learn</p>
<p>from my discussion with Dr. Crum,</p>
<p>what you believe about the nutritional content of your food</p>
<p>changes the way that food impacts your brain and body</p>
<p>to a remarkable degree.</p>
<p>And the same is true for mindsets about exercise and stress</p>
<p>and even medication.</p>
<p>For instance, recent work from Dr. Crum&rsquo;s laboratory</p>
<p>shows that what we believe about the side effect profiles</p>
<p>of different drug treatments</p>
<p>or different behavioral treatments</p>
<p>has a profound impact on how quickly those treatments work</p>
<p>and the effectiveness of those treatments.</p>
<p>I just want to mention one particular study</p>
<p>that just came out from a graduate student</p>
<p>in Dr. Crum&rsquo;s laboratory, Lauren Howe, H-O-W-E,</p>
<p>showed that how kids react to a treatment</p>
<p>for peanut allergies can be profoundly shaped</p>
<p>by whether or not those kids were educated</p>
<p>about the side effects of the treatment,</p>
<p>such that if they learned that the side effects</p>
<p>were a by-product of a treatment</p>
<p>that would help them,</p>
<p>and they learned a little bit</p>
<p>about why those side effects arose</p>
<p>and that the side effects might even help them</p>
<p>in route to overcoming their peanut allergy,</p>
<p>had an enormous impact</p>
<p>on how quickly they move through the treatment</p>
<p>and indeed how much they suffered,</p>
<p>or in this case did not suffer from those side effects.</p>
<p>And that is but one example that you will learn about today</p>
<p>as we discuss what mindsets are,</p>
<p>the number of different mindsets that exist</p>
<p>and how we can adopt mindsets</p>
<p>that make us more adaptive, more effective,</p>
<p>allow us to suffer less</p>
<p>and to perform better in all aspects of life.</p>
<p>I personally find the work of Dr. Aaliyah Crum</p>
<p>to be among the most important work being done</p>
<p>in the fields of biology and psychology</p>
<p>and the interface of mind-body.</p>
<p>Everything that she&rsquo;s done up until now and published,</p>
<p>and indeed the work that she continues to do,</p>
<p>has shaped everything within my daily routines,</p>
<p>within my work routines, within my athletic routines.</p>
<p>And we probably shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised</p>
<p>by the fact that Dr. Crum works on all these things.</p>
<p>She was not only an incredibly accomplished</p>
<p>tenured research professor,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s also a clinical psychologist,</p>
<p>and she was also a division one athlete</p>
<p>and an elite gymnast at one period in her life.</p>
<p>So she really walks the walk</p>
<p>in terms of understanding what mindsets are</p>
<p>and applying them in different aspects of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re going to learn a ton from this conversation,</p>
<p>as did I, and come away with many, many actionable items</p>
<p>that you can apply in your own life.</p>
<p>In fact, as we march into today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>you might want to just put in the back of your mind</p>
<p>the question, what is my mindset about blank?</p>
<p>So for instance, ask yourself,</p>
<p>what is my mindset about stress?</p>
<p>What is my mindset about food?</p>
<p>What is my mindset about exercise?</p>
<p>What is my mindset about relationships of different kinds?</p>
<p>Because in doing that, you&rsquo;ll be in a great position</p>
<p>to extract the best of the information</p>
<p>that Dr. Crum presents, and indeed to adapt those mindsets</p>
<p>in the way that is going to be most beneficial for you.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now my conversation with Dr. Aliyah Crum.</p>
<p>Well, great to have you here.</p>
<p>Great to be here.</p>
<p>Yeah, for the record, it&rsquo;s Aliyah Crum,</p>
<p>but you go by Ali, correct?</p>
<p>That is correct.</p>
<p>Dr. Ali Crum, I guess would be.</p>
<p>Or just Ali.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been looking forward</p>
<p>to talking to you for a long time.</p>
<p>Just to start off, you&rsquo;ve talked a lot</p>
<p>and worked a lot on the science of mindsets.</p>
<p>Could you define for us what is a mindset</p>
<p>and what sort of purpose does it serve?</p>
<p>Of course, yeah, mindsets have been described</p>
<p>or defined in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>We define mindsets as core beliefs</p>
<p>or assumptions that we have about a domain</p>
<p>or category of things that orient us</p>
<p>to a particular set of expectations,</p>
<p>explanations, and goals.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of jargony.</p>
<p>I can distill it down for you.</p>
<p>So mindsets are an assumption that you make about a domain.</p>
<p>So take stress, for example, the nature of stress.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sort of core belief about that?</p>
<p>And mindsets that we&rsquo;ve studied about stress are,</p>
<p>do you view stress as enhancing, good for you,</p>
<p>or do you view it as debilitating and bad for you?</p>
<p>Those mindsets, those core beliefs orient our thinking.</p>
<p>They change what we expect will happen to us</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re stressed, how we explain the occurrences</p>
<p>that happen or unfold when we&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>and also change our motivation</p>
<p>for what we engage in when we&rsquo;re stressed.</p>
<p>So we have mindsets about many things,</p>
<p>mindsets about stress, mindsets about intelligence,</p>
<p>as Carol Dweck&rsquo;s work has shown,</p>
<p>mindsets about food, mindsets about medicine, you name it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of distilling down those core assumptions</p>
<p>that really shape and orient our thinking and action.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard you say before that mindsets simplify life</p>
<p>in some way by constraining the number of things</p>
<p>that we have to consider.</p>
<p>And it sounds to me like we can have mindsets</p>
<p>about many things, as you said.</p>
<p>What are some different mindsets?</p>
<p>I think many people are familiar</p>
<p>with our colleague Carol Dweck&rsquo;s notion of growth mindset,</p>
<p>that if we&rsquo;re not proficient at something</p>
<p>that we should think about not being proficient yet,</p>
<p>that we are on some path to proficiency.</p>
<p>But what are some examples of mindsets</p>
<p>and how early do these get laid down</p>
<p>or do we learn them from our parents?</p>
<p>Maybe if you could just flesh it out a bit for us</p>
<p>in terms of what you&rsquo;ve observed in your own science</p>
<p>or your own life even.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important with Carol Dweck&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>a lot of people kind of get focused</p>
<p>on growth motivation and all these things.</p>
<p>But her work really originated from thinking</p>
<p>about what she called as implicit theories</p>
<p>or core beliefs about the nature</p>
<p>of intelligence or ability.</p>
<p>So do you believe that your baseline levels</p>
<p>of intelligence or your abilities are fixed, static,</p>
<p>set throughout the rest of your life?</p>
<p>Or do you believe that they can grow and change?</p>
<p>Now, those are oversimplified generalizations</p>
<p>about the nature of intelligence.</p>
<p>And the reality is, as it always is, complex</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a bit of both and it&rsquo;s all these things.</p>
<p>But as humans, we need these simplifying systems</p>
<p>to help us understand a complex reality.</p>
<p>So those assumptions that we jump to,</p>
<p>oh, intelligence is fixed or intelligence is malleable,</p>
<p>they help us to simplify this complex reality,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not inconsequential, right?</p>
<p>They matter in shaping our motivation.</p>
<p>And as she has shown, if you have the mindset</p>
<p>that intelligence is malleable,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re motivated to work harder, to grow your intelligence.</p>
<p>If you have a setback in your learning,</p>
<p>you think, okay, there&rsquo;s something there</p>
<p>that I can grow and learn and build from.</p>
<p>If you have the mindset that it&rsquo;s fixed,</p>
<p>why work harder at math</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re good at it?</p>
<p>So in retrospect, it&rsquo;s pretty clear</p>
<p>how these mindsets can affect our motivation.</p>
<p>What our work has aimed to do</p>
<p>is to expand the range of mindsets</p>
<p>that we are studying, focused on,</p>
<p>and also understand and expand the range of effects</p>
<p>that they have.</p>
<p>So by and large, we&rsquo;ve focused on mindsets</p>
<p>in the domain of health and health behaviors.</p>
<p>So I mentioned mindsets about stress.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also looked at mindsets about food and healthy eating.</p>
<p>So do you have the mindset that foods</p>
<p>that are good for you, healthy foods,</p>
<p>are disgusting and depriving?</p>
<p>Or do you have the mindset that healthy foods</p>
<p>are indulgent and delicious?</p>
<p>Now, you know, it could be a variety of different foods.</p>
<p>You might have different thoughts</p>
<p>about different healthy foods,</p>
<p>but generally people, at least in our culture in the West,</p>
<p>have this view that stress is debilitating.</p>
<p>Healthy foods are disgusting and depriving.</p>
<p>And those mindsets, whether or not they&rsquo;re true or false,</p>
<p>right or wrong, they have an impact.</p>
<p>And they have an impact</p>
<p>not just through the motivational mechanisms</p>
<p>that Dweck and others have studied,</p>
<p>but as our lab has started to reveal,</p>
<p>they also shape physiological mechanisms</p>
<p>by changing what our bodies prioritize and prepare to do.</p>
<p>So those are just two examples, mindsets about stress,</p>
<p>mindsets about food.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve looked at mindsets about exercise.</p>
<p>Do you feel like you&rsquo;re getting enough?</p>
<p>Or do you feel like you&rsquo;re getting an insufficient amount</p>
<p>to get the health benefits you&rsquo;re seeking?</p>
<p>Mindsets about illness.</p>
<p>Do you view cancer as an unmitigated catastrophe?</p>
<p>Or do you view cancer as manageable</p>
<p>or perhaps even an opportunity?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve looked at mindsets about symptoms and side effects.</p>
<p>Do you view side effects as a sign</p>
<p>that the treatment is harmful?</p>
<p>Or do you view side effects as a sign</p>
<p>that the treatment is working?</p>
<p>Again, these are sort of core beliefs or assumptions</p>
<p>you have about these domains or categories,</p>
<p>but they matter because they&rsquo;re shaping,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re synthesizing and simplifying the way we&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also shaping what we&rsquo;re paying attention to,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re motivated to do,</p>
<p>and potentially even how our bodies respond.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d love to talk about this notion</p>
<p>of mindset shaping, how our bodies respond.</p>
<p>And maybe as an example of this,</p>
<p>if you could share with us this now famous study</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve done with a milkshake study,</p>
<p>if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind sharing the major contours</p>
<p>of that study and the results,</p>
<p>because I think they&rsquo;re extremely impressive</p>
<p>and they really speak to this interplay</p>
<p>between mindset and physiology.</p>
<p>Certainly, yeah, this was a study that I ran</p>
<p>as a graduate student at Yale University.</p>
<p>I was working with Kelly Brownell and Peter Salovey.</p>
<p>Peter Salovey had done a lot of work</p>
<p>on really coining the term emotional intelligence,</p>
<p>studying that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now the president of Yale, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now the president of Yale, yes.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s done well.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done well for himself</p>
<p>and for the university and society.</p>
<p>And Kelly Brownell, who was doing a lot of research</p>
<p>on food and obesity, and I had come in</p>
<p>doing some previous work on mindsets about exercise</p>
<p>and placebo effects and exercise,</p>
<p>and was in this sort of food domain</p>
<p>and this emotions and food domain.</p>
<p>And it really occurred to me</p>
<p>that there was a very simple question</p>
<p>that hadn&rsquo;t been probed yet.</p>
<p>And that was, do our beliefs about what we&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>change our body&rsquo;s physiological response to that food,</p>
<p>holding constant the objective nutrients of that thing?</p>
<p>So that question might sound outrageous at first,</p>
<p>but it was, it&rsquo;s really not outrageous</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re coming from a place</p>
<p>of having studied in depth placebo effects.</p>
<p>So placebo effects are this, in medicine at least,</p>
<p>are this sort of robust demonstration</p>
<p>in which simply taking a sugar pill, taking nothing,</p>
<p>under the impression that it&rsquo;s a real medication</p>
<p>that might relieve your asthma, reduce your blood pressure,</p>
<p>boost your immune system,</p>
<p>can lead to those physiological effects</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s no objective nutrients.</p>
<p>And we have more evidence on placebo effects</p>
<p>than we have for any other drug</p>
<p>because of the clinical trial process</p>
<p>in which all new drugs and medications</p>
<p>are required to outperform a placebo effect.</p>
<p>So we have a lot of data on the placebo effect.</p>
<p>Now, we can get nuanced there.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a lot of data comparing the placebo effect</p>
<p>to doing nothing, which is important</p>
<p>for distilling mindset effects or belief effects</p>
<p>from sort of natural occurring changes in the body.</p>
<p>But anyways, going back to this question,</p>
<p>it was like, all right, we&rsquo;ve moved from, you know,</p>
<p>medications solving our health crises</p>
<p>to behavioral medicine solving our health crises,</p>
<p>increase people&rsquo;s exercise, get them to eat better.</p>
<p>To what degree are these things influenced</p>
<p>by our mindsets or beliefs about them?</p>
<p>So to test this question, we ran a seemingly simple study.</p>
<p>This was done at the Yale Center</p>
<p>for Clinical and Translational Research.</p>
<p>And we brought people into our lab</p>
<p>under the impression that we were designing</p>
<p>different milkshakes with vastly different</p>
<p>metabolic concentrations, nutrient concentrations</p>
<p>that were designed to meet different metabolic needs</p>
<p>of the patrons of the hospital, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna come in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna taste these milkshakes,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna measure</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s physiological response to them.</p>
<p>This was a within-subjects design,</p>
<p>so it was the same people consuming two different milkshakes,</p>
<p>two different time points separated by a week.</p>
<p>And at one time point, they were told</p>
<p>that they were consuming this really high-fat,</p>
<p>high-caloric, indulgent milkshake.</p>
<p>It was like a 620 calorie, super high fat and sugar.</p>
<p>The other time point, they were told</p>
<p>that it was a low-fat, low-calorie,</p>
<p>sensible sort of diet shake.</p>
<p>In reality, it was the exact same shake.</p>
<p>It was right in the middle.</p>
<p>It was like 300 calories,</p>
<p>moderate amount of fats and sugars.</p>
<p>And we were measuring their body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gut peptide response to this shake.</p>
<p>And in particular, we were looking at the hormone ghrelin.</p>
<p>So as you know, ghrelin hunger,</p>
<p>medical experts call it the hunger hormone,</p>
<p>rises in ghrelin, signal, you know, seek out food.</p>
<p>And then theoretically,</p>
<p>in proportion to the amount of calories you consume,</p>
<p>ghrelin levels drop, signaling to the brain,</p>
<p>okay, you don&rsquo;t need to eat so much anymore.</p>
<p>You can stop eating.</p>
<p>And also revving up the metabolism</p>
<p>to burn the nutrients that were just ingested.</p>
<p>What we found in this study was that</p>
<p>when people thought they were consuming</p>
<p>the high-fat, high-calorie, indulgent milkshake,</p>
<p>in response to the shake, their ghrelin levels dropped</p>
<p>at a threefold rate, stronger than when they thought</p>
<p>they were consuming the sensible shake.</p>
<p>So essentially, their bodies responded</p>
<p>as if they had consumed more food,</p>
<p>even though it was the exact same shake at both time points.</p>
<p>So this was really, you know,</p>
<p>interesting and important for two reasons, really.</p>
<p>One was that it was, to my knowledge,</p>
<p>one of the first studies to show any effects</p>
<p>of just believing that you&rsquo;re eating something different</p>
<p>on your physiology.</p>
<p>Lots of studies have shown that</p>
<p>believing you&rsquo;re eating different things changes your taste,</p>
<p>you know, and even your satisfaction and fullness after.</p>
<p>But this shows that it has a metabolic</p>
<p>or a physiological component.</p>
<p>But the second piece was really important as well.</p>
<p>And especially for me, this was one study</p>
<p>that really transformed the way I think about</p>
<p>how I approach eating.</p>
<p>And that was the manner in which it affected our physiology</p>
<p>was somewhat counterintuitive.</p>
<p>So I had gone in thinking,</p>
<p>the better mindset to be in when you eat</p>
<p>means that you&rsquo;re eating healthy, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, it just makes sense.</p>
<p>Like placebo effects, think you&rsquo;re healthy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be healthy, you know.</p>
<p>But that was a far too simplistic way of thinking about it.</p>
<p>And in fact, it was the exact opposite</p>
<p>because thinking that they were eating,</p>
<p>when these participants thought they were eating sensibly,</p>
<p>their bodies left them still feeling physiologically hungry,</p>
<p>right, not satiated,</p>
<p>which could potentially be corresponding</p>
<p>to slower metabolism and so forth.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in the interest of maintaining or losing weight,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best mindset to be in?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to be in a mindset that you&rsquo;re eating indulgently,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re having enough food, that you&rsquo;re getting enough.</p>
<p>And at least in that study,</p>
<p>we showed that has a more adaptive effect</p>
<p>on ghrelin responses.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>And especially interesting to me as a neuroscientist</p>
<p>who has worked on aspects of the nervous system</p>
<p>that are involved in conscious perception,</p>
<p>like vision and, you know,</p>
<p>motion and color perception and so forth.</p>
<p>But also our lab has worked</p>
<p>and is increasingly working on autonomic functions</p>
<p>that are below our conscious detection.</p>
<p>In this case, a lie about how much something</p>
<p>these milkshakes contain affected a subconscious process,</p>
<p>because I have to imagine that the ghrelin pathway</p>
<p>is not one that I can decide,</p>
<p>oh, you know, this particular piece of chocolate</p>
<p>is going to really reduce my ghrelin</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very nutrient rich,</p>
<p>as opposed to one,</p>
<p>if you told me that a different piece of chocolate,</p>
<p>for instance, is low calorie or sugar-free chocolate</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>The ghrelin pathway, however, it seems based on your data</p>
<p>that the ghrelin pathway is susceptible to thoughts,</p>
<p>which is incredible.</p>
<p>But then again, there must be crossover</p>
<p>between conscious thought and these subconscious</p>
<p>or kind of autonomic pathways.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really remarkable.</p>
<p>It raises a question that I just have to ask</p>
<p>because increasingly so,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m involved in online discussions and social media.</p>
<p>And one of the most barbed wire topics out there,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s being generous,</p>
<p>is this topic of which diet or nutrients are best.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got people who are strictly plant-based.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got people who are omnivores.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got people who are carnivores.</p>
<p>You have every variation.</p>
<p>You have intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>also called time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>And it seems like once a group kind of plugs</p>
<p>into a particular mode of eating</p>
<p>that they feel works for them,</p>
<p>for whatever reason, energy-wise, mentally,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re looking at their blood profiles,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>But once they feel that it sort of, it works for them,</p>
<p>each camp seems to tout all the health benefits</p>
<p>and how great they feel.</p>
<p>Could it be that mindset effects are involved there,</p>
<p>that people are finding the nutritional program</p>
<p>that they feel brings them the most enrichment of life,</p>
<p>but also nutrients,</p>
<p>and that their health really is shifting</p>
<p>in a positive direction,</p>
<p>but not necessarily because of the food constituents,</p>
<p>but because of the community and the ideas</p>
<p>and the reinforcement?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the belief that this is the right way</p>
<p>of doing something.</p>
<p>I think 100%, 100%, it has something to contribute.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t wanna,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna weigh in on the debate,</p>
<p>which is that what I will most certainly weigh in on</p>
<p>is the notion that,</p>
<p>look, going back to the placebo effect, right,</p>
<p>we have a outdated understanding of what that is,</p>
<p>which is based on this randomized control trial.</p>
<p>You compare a drug to a placebo.</p>
<p>If the drug works better than the placebo,</p>
<p>you say, great, the drug works.</p>
<p>If the drug doesn&rsquo;t outperform the placebo,</p>
<p>you say the drug doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really oversimplified.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good test for the specific efficacy of the drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good test for understanding</p>
<p>the total impact of that drug.</p>
<p>Because in the reality of things,</p>
<p>if a drug outperforms a placebo,</p>
<p>then you start prescribing it,</p>
<p>but the reality is that the total effect of that drug</p>
<p>is a combined product of the specific chemical attributes</p>
<p>of that drug and whatever&rsquo;s going on in the placebo effect,</p>
<p>which is, at least from our perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beliefs, it&rsquo;s social context,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s your body&rsquo;s natural ability</p>
<p>to respond to something.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s in the placebo effect example.</p>
<p>The same is true for everything we do or consume.</p>
<p>So when it comes to what diet you&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>both are true.</p>
<p>It does matter what it is,</p>
<p>and it matters what you think about that diet,</p>
<p>and what others around you and in our culture</p>
<p>think about that diet,</p>
<p>because those social contexts inform our mindsets.</p>
<p>Our mindsets interact with our physiology</p>
<p>in ways that produce outcomes that are really important.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s not get dualistic and say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either all in the mind or not in the mind.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s also not be unnecessarily combative</p>
<p>and say, oh, it should be all plant-based</p>
<p>or keto or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of those things are a combined product</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re actually doing</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re thinking about.</p>
<p>If you believe in it, if you don&rsquo;t, if you&rsquo;re skeptical,</p>
<p>or in some cases you think you should be eating</p>
<p>a certain way and then you don&rsquo;t live up to that,</p>
<p>it might have an adverse effect</p>
<p>because of the stress and the anxiety associated with that.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Along the lines of belief effects,</p>
<p>can we call these belief effects or mindsets?</p>
<p>Is there a difference between these,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m calling belief effects and placebo effects?</p>
<p>I mean, are placebo effects distinctly different</p>
<p>from mindset effects or are they more or less the same thing?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re related.</p>
<p>So I think placebo effects maybe should be reserved</p>
<p>for the conditions in which you&rsquo;re actually taking a placebo</p>
<p>which is an inactive substance.</p>
<p>When you get out of that sort of placebo versus drug realm</p>
<p>and you start looking at placebo effects,</p>
<p>I use quotes with my hands here,</p>
<p>in behavioral health, the term kind of becomes confusing</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not, you know, in the milkshake study,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t give people a placebo milkshake, right?</p>
<p>We just changed what they believed about it.</p>
<p>So how I like to think about it is that placebo effects</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re traditionally construed</p>
<p>are made up of three things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the social context, mindsets or beliefs,</p>
<p>and the natural physiological processes</p>
<p>in the brain and body that can produce the outcomes.</p>
<p>And so we could just call them belief effects</p>
<p>because the beliefs are triggering</p>
<p>the physiological processes</p>
<p>and the beliefs are shaped by the social context.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>It makes sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, there was a paper a year or two ago</p>
<p>published in Science Magazine</p>
<p>about brain regions involved in psychogenic fever</p>
<p>that if people, or you can actually do this</p>
<p>in animal models too, think that they are sick,</p>
<p>you get a genuine one to three degree increase</p>
<p>in body temperature,</p>
<p>one to three degrees Fahrenheit increase in body temperature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I guess it plays into, you know,</p>
<p>symptomology generally.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a believer in belief effects.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s also, and I would just say that, you know,</p>
<p>the term that we use in our field is nocebo effect for that,</p>
<p>which is sort of the placebo&rsquo;s ugly stepsister.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s when negative beliefs</p>
<p>cause negative consequences.</p>
<p>So you are told you will have, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very well demonstrated that when people are told</p>
<p>about certain side effects,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re far more likely to experience those side effects.</p>
<p>When people think that they&rsquo;re sick or going to get sick,</p>
<p>sometimes that can create, you know,</p>
<p>the physiological symptoms.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s various debates</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not only that physiology changes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also that your attention changes.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re experiencing things like fatigue and headache</p>
<p>and upset stomach all the time.</p>
<p>And then when you take a drug and somebody says,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel fatigue and headache,</p>
<p>you start noticing that you&rsquo;re tired and have headaches</p>
<p>and attribute it to the drug.</p>
<p>So some of the mechanisms are attention</p>
<p>and some of them are real changes in physiology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to tell us about the hotel workers study.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>I know you get asked these questions all the time,</p>
<p>but I find these results also amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I think that this is a really good example</p>
<p>of this phenomenon, right?</p>
<p>That the total effect of anything is a combined product</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and what you think about what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So this was a study that I ran with Ellen Langer</p>
<p>way back when I was an undergrad, actually.</p>
<p>We started this study.</p>
<p>Ellen Langer is a professor of psychology at Harvard</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s done a lot of really fascinating work</p>
<p>on her flavor of mindfulness,</p>
<p>which is distinct from a more Eastern,</p>
<p>Buddhist sort of mindfulness-based work.</p>
<p>And she actually was the one who said to me originally,</p>
<p>you know, I was an athlete at the time,</p>
<p>I was an ice hockey player and I was training constantly.</p>
<p>And one day, I&rsquo;ll never forget it,</p>
<p>she said, you know the benefit of exercise</p>
<p>is just a placebo, right?</p>
<p>And I was like, well, that&rsquo;s outrageous.</p>
<p>Ellen&rsquo;s known for saying very provocative,</p>
<p>but also very wise things.</p>
<p>And that statement really got me thinking about that.</p>
<p>So we designed this study together</p>
<p>and that was to look at, you know, how would you study,</p>
<p>if the benefits of exercise were a placebo,</p>
<p>how would you even test that?</p>
<p>Because, you know, what does it mean</p>
<p>to give a placebo exercise?</p>
<p>And we sort of flipped it on its head</p>
<p>and we found a group of people</p>
<p>who were getting a lot of exercise,</p>
<p>but weren&rsquo;t aware of it, that they were, right?</p>
<p>So this, we settled on a group of hotel housekeepers.</p>
<p>So these are women working in hotels</p>
<p>who were on their feet all day long,</p>
<p>pushing carts, changing linens, climbing stairs,</p>
<p>you know, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming.</p>
<p>It was clear that they were getting above and beyond</p>
<p>at least the surgeon general&rsquo;s requirements at that time,</p>
<p>which were to accumulate 30 minutes</p>
<p>of moderate physical activity per day.</p>
<p>But what was interesting was when we went in</p>
<p>and surveyed them and asked them,</p>
<p>hey, how much exercise do you think you&rsquo;re getting?</p>
<p>A third of them said zero.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t get any exercise.</p>
<p>And the average response was like a three</p>
<p>on a scale of zero to 10.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clear that even though these women were active,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have that mindset, right?</p>
<p>They had the mindset that their work was just work,</p>
<p>hard, maybe thankless work that led them to feel tired</p>
<p>and, you know, in pain at the end of the day,</p>
<p>but not that it was good for them,</p>
<p>that it was good exercise.</p>
<p>So what we did was we took these women</p>
<p>and we randomized them into two groups,</p>
<p>and we told half of them that their work was good exercise.</p>
<p>In this case, it was true, factual information.</p>
<p>We oriented them to the surgeon general&rsquo;s guidelines.</p>
<p>We oriented them to the benefits</p>
<p>that they should be receiving.</p>
<p>And then we had measured them previously</p>
<p>on their physiological metrics like weight</p>
<p>and body fat and blood pressure.</p>
<p>And we came back four weeks later and we tested them again.</p>
<p>And what we found was that these women,</p>
<p>even though they hadn&rsquo;t changed anything in their behavior,</p>
<p>at least that was detectable to us,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t work more rooms.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t start, you know, doing pull-ups or push-ups</p>
<p>in between cleaning hotel rooms, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t report any changes in their diet,</p>
<p>but they had benefits to their health.</p>
<p>So they lost weight.</p>
<p>They decreased their systolic blood pressure</p>
<p>by about 10 points on average.</p>
<p>And they started feeling better about themselves,</p>
<p>their bodies, and their work, not surprisingly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>How should we conceptualize that result</p>
<p>in light of all of our efforts</p>
<p>to get more out of exercise, right?</p>
<p>Because earlier you mentioned it from the milkshake study</p>
<p>and our perceptions about nutrient density,</p>
<p>that, you know, it&rsquo;s a little bit the right message</p>
<p>that actually a little bit counterintuitive,</p>
<p>that if you think, oh, this is very low calorie,</p>
<p>nutrient sparse, then it&rsquo;s good for me</p>
<p>in the context of losing weight, for instance.</p>
<p>But it turns out the opposite is true,</p>
<p>because as you told us, the body responds differently</p>
<p>when you think something is nutrient dense</p>
<p>and can actually suppress hunger more.</p>
<p>So in light of this result,</p>
<p>if I were to say, okay,</p>
<p>my current understanding of the literature</p>
<p>is that getting somewhere between 150 and 180 minutes</p>
<p>per week of cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>is probably a good idea for most people.</p>
<p>If I tell myself that it&rsquo;s not just a good idea,</p>
<p>but that it&rsquo;s extremely effective</p>
<p>in lowering my blood pressure</p>
<p>and maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>according to these results,</p>
<p>it will have an enhanced effect on those metrics.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>So this is a really important point,</p>
<p>because what this reveals</p>
<p>is that we have to be more thoughtful</p>
<p>in how we go about motivating people to exercise</p>
<p>or teaching people about the benefits.</p>
<p>Our current approach is just to basically tell people</p>
<p>writ large, you know, here&rsquo;s what you need to get.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to get good for, you know,</p>
<p>to get enough benefits to receive the,</p>
<p>enough exercise to receive the health benefits.</p>
<p>The problem with that approach is that</p>
<p>most people aren&rsquo;t meeting those benefits yet</p>
<p>or aren&rsquo;t meeting those requirements yet.</p>
<p>And the risk with that is that,</p>
<p>well, the intention with that is to motivate them</p>
<p>because, you know, public health officials think,</p>
<p>well, if I just tell people you need to get more exercise</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s good for you, they&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>We know now that that doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>that these guidelines are not motivational.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t change our behavior.</p>
<p>And what our work adds to that</p>
<p>is that not only is it not motivational,</p>
<p>it also creates potentially a mindset</p>
<p>that, you know, makes people worse off</p>
<p>than they were without knowing about the guidelines.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that mindset is everything.</p>
<p>Certainly exercise is good for us and is helpful for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things we have the best data on.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying, oh, exercise is all a placebo.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that we need to be more mindful</p>
<p>about how do we motivate people to exercise,</p>
<p>but how do we help people to actually reap the benefits</p>
<p>of the exercise they are already doing?</p>
<p>Now, Octavia Zart, who&rsquo;s a grad student in my lab,</p>
<p>ran a number of interesting studies along these lines,</p>
<p>one in which she looked at</p>
<p>three nationally representative data sets,</p>
<p>which had this interesting question in them,</p>
<p>which was how much exercise do you get relative to others?</p>
<p>Do you get about the same, a little more, a lot more?</p>
<p>Do you get a little less or a lot less, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, the audience, your listeners,</p>
<p>you could all answer this.</p>
<p>And then in these data sets,</p>
<p>what she did was she had, you know,</p>
<p>pulled from data that tracked death rates</p>
<p>over the next 21 years.</p>
<p>And a couple interesting things revealed themselves.</p>
<p>One was that the correlations</p>
<p>between these perceptions of exercise relative to others</p>
<p>and people&rsquo;s actual exercise</p>
<p>is measured through accelerometer data,</p>
<p>as well as more rigorous sort of</p>
<p>what did you do today kind of data.</p>
<p>Those don&rsquo;t correlate much at all.</p>
<p>People lie.</p>
<p>Well, people lie, but also-</p>
<p>Or misperceive.</p>
<p>They misperceive.</p>
<p>And, or, you know, who&rsquo;s to say it&rsquo;s misperceiving?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, everything&rsquo;s relative, right?</p>
<p>I used to do triathlons very seriously.</p>
<p>So if you were to ask me now,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m totally inactive, right?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m not doing anything near what I used to.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s my focus set, right,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m not exercising much.</p>
<p>But if I think about, you know,</p>
<p>compared to other people,</p>
<p>given what I know about, you know,</p>
<p>national representative statistics,</p>
<p>then I could feel like, oh, I&rsquo;m getting a lot, right?</p>
<p>So you can see how these perceptions</p>
<p>are decoupled from objective reality.</p>
<p>And what we found in these studies</p>
<p>is that that one question mattered,</p>
<p>in some cases, more than objective activity,</p>
<p>but in all cases, controlling for objective activity</p>
<p>and predicting death rates.</p>
<p>And in one of those samples,</p>
<p>it was a 71% higher risk of death rate,</p>
<p>you know, if people rated themselves</p>
<p>as feeling like they were getting less activity than others.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>
<p>And again, you know, that study is cross-sectional,</p>
<p>longitudinal, it was not experimental,</p>
<p>but, you know, combined these really sort of,</p>
<p>you know, coalesce to say, hey, this is important too, right?</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s figure out ways to be active</p>
<p>and get people active,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s also not make people feel horrible</p>
<p>about themselves when they&rsquo;re not getting enough.</p>
<p>And going back to the hotel study,</p>
<p>again, I mentioned that I did that at a time</p>
<p>when I was a Division I ice hockey player at the time.</p>
<p>We were training all the time,</p>
<p>and I was in an unhealthy mindset about that.</p>
<p>I never felt like I was getting enough.</p>
<p>I would, you know, come off a two-hour practice</p>
<p>into a weightlifting session,</p>
<p>and then I would get on the elliptical for 30 minutes</p>
<p>because I thought I had to do that also, you know?</p>
<p>My teammates who were with me at the time</p>
<p>could attest to that.</p>
<p>And so that study was really helpful for me</p>
<p>to realize that I needed to pay attention,</p>
<p>not just to what I was doing,</p>
<p>but also take care of my mindset about that.</p>
<p>And I think the essence is how do you get people</p>
<p>to feel like they&rsquo;re getting enough?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sense of enoughness that really matters.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see the dilemma</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want people thinking</p>
<p>that exercise and its positive effects are so potent</p>
<p>that they can get away with a three-minute walk each day</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re good,</p>
<p>because most likely they are not.</p>
<p>But again, you don&rsquo;t want them</p>
<p>to be so back on their heels psychologically</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t even do that</p>
<p>or that they never exceed that by very much.</p>
<p>But it seems like the message from the milkshake study</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re talking about now in terms of exercise</p>
<p>would be to really communicate to the general public</p>
<p>that food has a potency,</p>
<p>even healthy foods have a potency to give us energy,</p>
<p>to fuel our immune system and endocrine system, et cetera,</p>
<p>and that exercise has a remarkable potency</p>
<p>and that that potency can be enhanced</p>
<p>by believing in or understanding that potency.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Is that an accurate way to state it?</p>
<p>Total, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I really feel like we need to push</p>
<p>and what I try to do in our research</p>
<p>is to not just show, oh, mindset matters.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that interesting?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s both matter, right?</p>
<p>Both exercise and what you think about it matter.</p>
<p>Both what you eat and how you think about what you eat matter</p>
<p>and so we really as individuals and as a society</p>
<p>need to work on what is the right way to cultivate</p>
<p>both behaviors and mindsets about those behaviors</p>
<p>that serve us.</p>
<p>And in the food context, this, again,</p>
<p>that milkshake study really changed me on a personal level</p>
<p>because I had been somebody who was constantly</p>
<p>trying to restrain my eating, right?</p>
<p>I wanted to maintain or lose weight, look fit</p>
<p>and so I was like, well, I should diet,</p>
<p>I should have low calorie, low carb, low this, low that,</p>
<p>but what that was doing was putting me</p>
<p>into this constant mindset of restraint</p>
<p>and what that study suggested was that that mindset</p>
<p>was potentially counteracting any benefit, right?</p>
<p>Or any objective effects of the restrained diet</p>
<p>because my brain was saying, okay, you&rsquo;re restraining,</p>
<p>maybe my body was responding to that,</p>
<p>but the brain was also saying, eat more food,</p>
<p>stay hungry because you need to survive.</p>
<p>And so the answer isn&rsquo;t, oh, we&rsquo;ll throw everything</p>
<p>into the wind and just drink indulgent milkshakes</p>
<p>all day long.</p>
<p>The answer is eat healthy foods, right?</p>
<p>Based on the latest science and what we know to be true</p>
<p>about nutrients and our body&rsquo;s response to them,</p>
<p>but try to do so in a mindset of indulgence,</p>
<p>a mindset of satisfaction, a mindset of enjoyment, right?</p>
<p>That is really the trick and that&rsquo;s what I at least try</p>
<p>to do in my own life.</p>
<p>I love that and as I get more involved</p>
<p>in public-facing health communications,</p>
<p>this comes up again and again.</p>
<p>How should we conceptualize our behavior?</p>
<p>How should we think about all these options</p>
<p>that are offered to us?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m excited that the potency of mindsets</p>
<p>are coming through again and again.</p>
<p>So I have a question about this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this study has ever been done,</p>
<p>but a lot of these mindset effects are something</p>
<p>that years ago I felt I did vis-a-vis sleep</p>
<p>because I was in graduate school and as a postdoc</p>
<p>and even as an undergraduate, I had so much work to do</p>
<p>that I decided I would sleep when I was dead, in quotes.</p>
<p>Not a good idea from what we know.</p>
<p>However, I found that a couple nights of minimal sleep</p>
<p>or even an all-nighter and I could do pretty well.</p>
<p>Eventually it would catch up with me.</p>
<p>Has there ever been a study exploring whether or not</p>
<p>the effects of sleep deprivation can be impacted</p>
<p>by these mindset effects?</p>
<p>Because over the years I keep learning more and more</p>
<p>about how much sleep I need and I&rsquo;ve really emphasized sleep</p>
<p>and I do feel much better when I&rsquo;m getting it.</p>
<p>But as new parents know or students know or athletes know</p>
<p>or anyone that lives a normal life finds sometimes</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t get a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Would believing that we can tolerate that</p>
<p>and push through it and function just fine</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s not gonna kill us or give us Alzheimer&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>could that help us deal with a poor night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>or even two or chronic sleep deprivation?</p>
<p>Certainly, I would guess.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been one study to my knowledge that&rsquo;s tested that,</p>
<p>Dragunov and colleagues.</p>
<p>And they looked at, they had people come in</p>
<p>and they gave them sort of, I think it was a sham</p>
<p>sort of EEG test to sort of figure out how, you know,</p>
<p>this was done a number of years ago.</p>
<p>Now we actually have devices to test this,</p>
<p>but theirs was this sham test.</p>
<p>And they gave people fake feedback</p>
<p>about the quality of their sleep</p>
<p>and, you know, how it had been the night before.</p>
<p>And they also asked the participants</p>
<p>how they felt about their sleep.</p>
<p>And essentially what they found was that the sham feedback,</p>
<p>if they were told that they had gotten lower quality sleep</p>
<p>led to deficits in a variety of cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>And that was sort of decoupled from their actual,</p>
<p>you know, qualities of sleep, at least as self-reported.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one study that attests to this.</p>
<p>I think certainly, I mean, I would, you know,</p>
<p>I would bet a lot of money, I haven&rsquo;t run this myself,</p>
<p>but that your mindsets can push around your, you know,</p>
<p>cognitive functioning, physiological effects of sleep.</p>
<p>But once again, it&rsquo;s not all or nothing, right?</p>
<p>There are real important benefits of sleep</p>
<p>and how far we can push around that through our mindset</p>
<p>is an open question.</p>
<p>You know, the result that you mentioned</p>
<p>is really interesting</p>
<p>because a lot of people use these sleep trackers now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re using rings or wristbands.</p>
<p>In fact, my lab has worked pretty closely with a company</p>
<p>and they supplied us data on how well people are sleeping.</p>
<p>And you get a score, people get the score back.</p>
<p>And when they see that score,</p>
<p>they might think based on these results,</p>
<p>oh, my sleep, my recovery score, my sleep score was poor.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t expect much from myself today.</p>
<p>It makes sense that my memory would be going.</p>
<p>For this reason,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll probably lose a few friends for saying this,</p>
<p>but hopefully I&rsquo;ll gain a few as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I like to just do a subjective score for myself.</p>
<p>If I wake up in the morning, I just decide,</p>
<p>okay, did I sleep well or not?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like seeing a number.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like getting a readout from a device.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s me, I know a lot of people like it</p>
<p>and they can be very useful,</p>
<p>but gosh, it seems that these belief effects</p>
<p>are weaving in at all levels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for us to talk about stress</p>
<p>because your lab has worked extensively on this.</p>
<p>And if you would,</p>
<p>could you tell us at some point about the study</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve done about informing people</p>
<p>about the different effects of stress,</p>
<p>but also if there&rsquo;s an opportunity,</p>
<p>some takeaways about how we could each conceptualize stress</p>
<p>in ways that would make it serve us better</p>
<p>as opposed to harm us</p>
<p>and our mental and physical performance.</p>
<p>Great, yeah, so I had come off the heels</p>
<p>of doing some research in exercise and diet</p>
<p>and finding these provocative</p>
<p>and also counterintuitive effects</p>
<p>with respect to how we should try to motivate people.</p>
<p>And I was thinking about this</p>
<p>and this grouping of going from medicines</p>
<p>to saving us to behaviors to saving us</p>
<p>and how those behaviors might be influenced by mindsets.</p>
<p>The obvious next thing to think about was stress, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, okay, well, you want to be healthier,</p>
<p>fix your diet, fix your exercise and stress less.</p>
<p>And, you know, so I started doing some digging</p>
<p>into the nature of stress and a couple of things were clear.</p>
<p>One was that the public health message was very clear, right?</p>
<p>That stress was bad, right?</p>
<p>Unmitigated and harmful on our health,</p>
<p>our productivity, our relationships,</p>
<p>our fertility, our cognition, you name it, right?</p>
<p>The messages that were out there,</p>
<p>by and large oversimplified messages</p>
<p>focused on the damaging consequences of stress.</p>
<p>But as you know, if you actually dive deeper</p>
<p>into the literature on stress and the origins of stress,</p>
<p>what you find is that, you know, the literature,</p>
<p>like most literatures is not so clear cut.</p>
<p>And in fact, there&rsquo;s a large amount of evidence</p>
<p>to support the fact that the experience of stress,</p>
<p>meaning encountering adversity or challenge</p>
<p>in one&rsquo;s goal-related efforts</p>
<p>does not have to be debilitating.</p>
<p>And in many cases, the body&rsquo;s response was designed</p>
<p>to enhance our ability to manage at those moments, right?</p>
<p>So some research showing that stress narrows our focus,</p>
<p>increases our attention, speeds up the rate</p>
<p>at which we&rsquo;re able to process information.</p>
<p>There was some research out there showing this phenomenon</p>
<p>of physiological toughening,</p>
<p>the process by which the release of catabolic hormones</p>
<p>and the stress response recruit</p>
<p>or activate anabolic hormones,</p>
<p>which help, as you know, build our muscles,</p>
<p>build our neurons to help us grow and learn.</p>
<p>And there was a whole body of emerging research</p>
<p>on post-traumatic growth or this phenomenon</p>
<p>which even the experience of the most traumatic stressors,</p>
<p>the most chronic and enduring stressors</p>
<p>could lead not to destruction,</p>
<p>but in fact to the exact opposite,</p>
<p>to an enhanced sense of connection with our values,</p>
<p>connection to others, sense of joy and passion for living.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I found that to be interesting.</p>
<p>And, you know, my work since then</p>
<p>has been not to try to argue that stress is enhancing</p>
<p>and not debilitating, but try to point out</p>
<p>that the true nature of stress is a paradox.</p>
<p>The true nature of stress is manifold and complex</p>
<p>and lots of things can happen.</p>
<p>But to question what&rsquo;s the role of our mindset about stress</p>
<p>in shaping our response to stress.</p>
<p>So some work had already been done</p>
<p>looking at your perception of the stressor, right?</p>
<p>So do you view a stressor like a challenging exam</p>
<p>or a health diagnosis as a challenge or a threat?</p>
<p>And that had shown pretty convincingly</p>
<p>that when you view stressors more as a challenge,</p>
<p>less as a threat, that your brain and body</p>
<p>responds more adaptively.</p>
<p>What our question was was to take</p>
<p>the sort of psychological construal</p>
<p>one step higher in abstraction.</p>
<p>So not just the stressor, but the nature of stress, right?</p>
<p>At that core level, do you view stress</p>
<p>as something that&rsquo;s bad, is going to kill us,</p>
<p>and therefore should be avoided?</p>
<p>Or do you view stress as natural and something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to enhance us?</p>
<p>And so we set out to design a series of studies</p>
<p>to test the extent to which these mindsets about stress</p>
<p>mattered.</p>
<p>We first, this again was with Peter Salovey and Sean Aker</p>
<p>originally, we designed a measure</p>
<p>to test people&rsquo;s mindsets about stress.</p>
<p>Simple questions like, what extent</p>
<p>do you believe or agree or disagree</p>
<p>with statements like, stress enhances my performance</p>
<p>and productivity, stress heightens my vitality</p>
<p>and growth, things like that.</p>
<p>And we found in a number of correlational studies</p>
<p>that that more enhancing stress mindset</p>
<p>was linked to better health outcomes, better well-being,</p>
<p>and higher performance.</p>
<p>So then we set out to see if we could</p>
<p>change people&rsquo;s mindsets.</p>
<p>And in our first test of this, we</p>
<p>decided to do so by creating these multimedia films that</p>
<p>showcased research, anecdotes, facts about stress, all true,</p>
<p>but oriented towards one mindset or the other, right?</p>
<p>So you can imagine one set of films</p>
<p>showed basically the messages that were out there</p>
<p>in the public health context.</p>
<p>The other showed, hey, stress has</p>
<p>been linked to these things, but in fact, the body stress</p>
<p>response was designed to do this.</p>
<p>Did you know it could do that?</p>
<p>And we had empowering images like LeBron James</p>
<p>making the free throw in the final minute</p>
<p>versus missing it, right?</p>
<p>So all of these things are true, possibilities,</p>
<p>but oriented to two different mindsets about stress.</p>
<p>So either people saw a video that basically</p>
<p>made it seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,</p>
<p>reduce you, or a video very similar,</p>
<p>stress will grow you, bring out your best,</p>
<p>and maybe even take you to heightened levels of performance</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve never experienced before.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So yeah, examples in the sports.</p>
<p>We also had true leaders emerge in the moments of greatest</p>
<p>stress, you know, Churchill.</p>
<p>So all those examples are out there</p>
<p>for both the enhancing nature and the debilitating nature.</p>
<p>And our question was, does orienting people</p>
<p>to different mindsets change how they respond to stress?</p>
<p>So this study was done in the wake</p>
<p>of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>We worked with UBS, a company, a financial service company</p>
<p>that was undergoing pretty massive amounts of layoffs.</p>
<p>So these employees were stressed about being laid off.</p>
<p>They were taking on more pressure.</p>
<p>It was just a tough time.</p>
<p>And we randomized them into three conditions.</p>
<p>And this was all pre-work before getting a training on stress.</p>
<p>But the three different conditions,</p>
<p>some watched no videos, some watched the stress</p>
<p>will crush you videos, and some watched the stress</p>
<p>could enhance you videos.</p>
<p>And what we found was that just, you know,</p>
<p>it was a total of nine minutes of videos</p>
<p>over the course of the week led to changes in their mindsets</p>
<p>about stress, which led to changes</p>
<p>in their physiological symptoms associated with stress.</p>
<p>So people who watched the enhancing films</p>
<p>had fewer backaches, muscle tension, insomnia,</p>
<p>racing heart, and so forth.</p>
<p>And they also reported performing better at work</p>
<p>compared to those who watched the debilitating videos.</p>
<p>Now, interestingly, we didn&rsquo;t make anyone worse</p>
<p>with the debilitating videos, which was good.</p>
<p>We had told the IRB we didn&rsquo;t expect that</p>
<p>because that message was already out there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they were already seeing.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t new to them.</p>
<p>It was more this enhancing perspective</p>
<p>that turned out to be inspiring.</p>
<p>I love that study.</p>
<p>And I know we both have friends and ties</p>
<p>in the special operations community</p>
<p>through just sort of happenstance.</p>
<p>And maybe we&rsquo;ll get into that a little later.</p>
<p>But a good friend from that community always says,</p>
<p>there are only three ways to go through life at any moment,</p>
<p>which is either back on your heels,</p>
<p>flat-footed, or forward center of mass.</p>
<p>And I said, well, what&rsquo;s the key to forward center of mass?</p>
<p>And he said, stress is what places you</p>
<p>in forward center of mass,</p>
<p>meaning leaning forward and into challenge.</p>
<p>And I know that you&rsquo;ve actually looked at that community,</p>
<p>and it does really seem like that&rsquo;s a mindset</p>
<p>that either they have going in or that they cultivate</p>
<p>through the course of their training.</p>
<p>But this notion that stress is what puts us</p>
<p>in forward motion is true physiologically, right?</p>
<p>I mean, adrenaline&rsquo;s major role is to place us</p>
<p>into a moment of, or bias us towards action.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we tremble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the body trying to initiate action.</p>
<p>But actually, this is probably a good opportunity.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s anything interesting to extract</p>
<p>from the study on SEAL teams, what was it?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I loved working with the SEALs.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things we found,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve studied this, measured this mindset</p>
<p>in several different populations.</p>
<p>And in every single one that we had tested so far,</p>
<p>the average had been on the debilitating side of the scale.</p>
<p>People were just saying stress is bad.</p>
<p>Stress is bad, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like with measures of growth</p>
<p>and fixed mindsets about intelligence,</p>
<p>people are in the middle,</p>
<p>but oftentimes have a more positive mindsets</p>
<p>about intelligence.</p>
<p>That was not the case with stress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still not the case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get the message out there.</p>
<p>Except for this group of Navy SEALs,</p>
<p>when they were actually recruits,</p>
<p>so people who were going through basic training</p>
<p>in order to become Navy SEALs.</p>
<p>And we found that they, on average,</p>
<p>had stress&rsquo;s enhancing mindset,</p>
<p>perhaps not surprisingly, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going in to devote your whole life</p>
<p>to being a Navy SEAL, you must have some inclination</p>
<p>that stress is a source of strength for you.</p>
<p>But what we found with them,</p>
<p>we measured this at the beginning of their basic training,</p>
<p>of Bud&rsquo;s training, and then looked at</p>
<p>how well they succeeded through that program.</p>
<p>So as you know, this is an extremely rigorous program.</p>
<p>You know, at the time, it was only like 10 or 20%</p>
<p>of trainees make it through.</p>
<p>The numbers have never shifted.</p>
<p>No matter how hard pressures on the community change,</p>
<p>the numbers are still on average about 15%.</p>
<p>Yeah, wow.</p>
<p>So what we found was that our measure predicted that rate.</p>
<p>So people who, even within that range,</p>
<p>had a more stress&rsquo;s enhancing mindset</p>
<p>were more likely to complete training, become a SEAL.</p>
<p>They also had faster obstacle course times,</p>
<p>and they were rated by their peers more positively.</p>
<p>So, you know, again, let&rsquo;s break this down, right?</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean, and people get me,</p>
<p>people get this wrong sometimes.</p>
<p>They think that I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>that a stress&rsquo;s enhancing mindset</p>
<p>means you should like stress, right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe SEALs do.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re saying, right?</p>
<p>Having a stress&rsquo;s enhancing mindset</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean the stressor is a good thing, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>that you have to go into combat and it&rsquo;s not pretty, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that getting a cancer diagnosis</p>
<p>is a good thing, or being in abject poverty is a good thing.</p>
<p>These are not good things.</p>
<p>But the experience of the stress associated with that,</p>
<p>the challenge, the adversity,</p>
<p>that experience can lead to enhancing outcomes</p>
<p>with respect to not just our cognition,</p>
<p>but our health, our performance, and our wellbeing.</p>
<p>So that mindset, right?</p>
<p>How does that work, right?</p>
<p>Well, it works through a number of different pathways.</p>
<p>One is that it changes fundamentally</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re motivated to do.</p>
<p>So if you just imagine we&rsquo;re stressed about something,</p>
<p>maybe a global pandemic, for example,</p>
<p>for instance, and you think that stress is bad,</p>
<p>then what&rsquo;s your motivation, right?</p>
<p>Your motivation is to, well,</p>
<p>first you get worried about the stress, right?</p>
<p>Now, not only do you have the pandemic,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stressed about the stress of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But second is your reaction is typically</p>
<p>to do one of two things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either to freak out and do everything you can</p>
<p>to make sure that this doesn&rsquo;t affect you negatively,</p>
<p>or to check out and say, oh, it&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna deal with it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically in denial.</p>
<p>So people who have a stress-debilitating mindset,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve shown this in our research,</p>
<p>tend to go to one or the other of those extremes.</p>
<p>They freak out or they check out.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because if stress is bad,</p>
<p>you need to either get rid of it and deal with it,</p>
<p>or it needs to not exist, right?</p>
<p>If you have a stress-enhancing mindset,</p>
<p>the motivation changes, right?</p>
<p>And the motivation is how do I utilize the stress</p>
<p>to realize the enhancing outcomes?</p>
<p>What can we do here, right,</p>
<p>to learn from this experience to make us stronger, fitter,</p>
<p>you know, have better science and treatments for the future,</p>
<p>deepen my relationships with others,</p>
<p>improve, you know, my priorities and so forth, right?</p>
<p>So the motivation changes.</p>
<p>The affect around it changes.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make it easy to deal with.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;ve shown in our research</p>
<p>is that people who have a stress-enhancing mindset</p>
<p>have more positive affect,</p>
<p>not necessarily less negative affect.</p>
<p>And it potentially changes physiology.</p>
<p>We have a few studies that show that people who are,</p>
<p>you know, inspired to adopt more enhancing mindsets</p>
<p>have more moderate cortisol response,</p>
<p>and they have higher levels of DHEA levels</p>
<p>in response to stress.</p>
<p>So more work needs to be done on the physiology,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love your take on the mechanisms</p>
<p>through which that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Yes, and DHEA, of course,</p>
<p>has an anabolic hormone in both men and women.</p>
<p>Very interesting, because we had a guest on this podcast.</p>
<p>He actually is a PhD scientist</p>
<p>who runs the UFC Performance Training Institute.</p>
<p>His name is Duncan French.</p>
<p>And his graduate work at UConn stores was very interesting.</p>
<p>It was in exercise science and physiology.</p>
<p>And what he showed was that</p>
<p>if you could spike the adrenaline response,</p>
<p>I think they did this through first-time skydive</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>that testosterone went up.</p>
<p>Now, this spits in the face of everything</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re told about stress and testosterone levels, right?</p>
<p>And this has also been looked at in females with estrogen,</p>
<p>although, of course, there&rsquo;s estrogen and testosterone</p>
<p>in both males and females,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s how they designed the study.</p>
<p>So it turns out that at least in the short term</p>
<p>that a very stressful event can raise anabolic hormones.</p>
<p>And I think that people forget at a mechanistic level</p>
<p>that adrenaline is epinephrine,</p>
<p>and epinephrine is biochemically derived</p>
<p>from the molecule dopamine.</p>
<p>If you look at the pathway</p>
<p>and even just Google it and go images,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that adrenaline is made from dopamine.</p>
<p>And dopamine and these anabolic hormones,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sort of close cousins.</p>
<p>They work together in the pituitary and hypothalamus.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that one could leverage stress</p>
<p>toward growth and towards anabolism</p>
<p>as opposed to cannibalism,</p>
<p>which is not saying cannibalism as in eating other people,</p>
<p>but catabolic processes is, I guess,</p>
<p>the right way to refer to it.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s, again, remarkable to me</p>
<p>is that all of these brain structures</p>
<p>that control dopamine, epinephrine,</p>
<p>testosterone, and estrogen,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all thought to be in the subconscious,</p>
<p>meaning below our ability to flip a switch</p>
<p>and turn them on or off,</p>
<p>and yet mindsets seem to impact them.</p>
<p>So all that to say that there&rsquo;s a clear mechanistic basis</p>
<p>by which this could all work.</p>
<p>And so on the one hand, I&rsquo;m surprised</p>
<p>because these are incredible results.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;m not surprised</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a physiological substrate there</p>
<p>that could readily explain them.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think figuring out exactly how it works</p>
<p>is really, you know-</p>
<p>We should do that.</p>
<p>We should do that, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got common friends in both departments,</p>
<p>so we should do it, why not?</p>
<p>But I did want to mention, you know,</p>
<p>the way I think about mindset,</p>
<p>and again, I think we need to study this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a neuroscientist, so I haven&rsquo;t looked at this,</p>
<p>but this is something we could do.</p>
<p>But the way I think about mindset</p>
<p>is that mindsets are kind of a portal</p>
<p>between conscious and subconscious processes.</p>
<p>They operate as a default setting of the mind, right?</p>
<p>So if, you know, if sort of programmed in there,</p>
<p>you have stress equals bad, right?</p>
<p>That is gonna, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be something maybe conscious, right?</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be conscious, right?</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t have to know their mindsets about stress</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re asked, really.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been programmed in through our upbringing,</p>
<p>through public health messages,</p>
<p>and through media and other things.</p>
<p>And it kind of sits there as an assumption in the brain.</p>
<p>And the brain is then figuring out</p>
<p>how should it respond to this situation.</p>
<p>And if the assumption, the default,</p>
<p>the programming is stress is bad,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna, through our subconscious,</p>
<p>trigger all the things that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, well, I need to like, you know,</p>
<p>rev up the things that protect me</p>
<p>versus rev up the things that help me grow.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s at least how I think about it.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s cool about it is that</p>
<p>because it operates as a sort of portal,</p>
<p>it communicates with more, you know,</p>
<p>subconscious physiological processes,</p>
<p>but it can also be accessed through our consciousness,</p>
<p>right, so just talking about this, right,</p>
<p>for your listeners, they&rsquo;re now invited</p>
<p>to bring their stress mindsets up to the consciousness</p>
<p>and say, what is my stress mindset?</p>
<p>How am I thinking about stress?</p>
<p>Can I reprogram that?</p>
<p>Can I start to think about it as more enhancing?</p>
<p>That takes a little bit of a conscious work, potentially,</p>
<p>but then once you do that,</p>
<p>that can kind of operate in the background,</p>
<p>influencing how your body responds</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to say, okay, I&rsquo;m stressed,</p>
<p>I better tell my, you know, anabolic hormones.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But these mindsets can help with the translational process.</p>
<p>I love the idea that mindsets are at the interface</p>
<p>between the conscious and subconscious.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack there,</p>
<p>but it clearly is the case that the mindset,</p>
<p>they sort of act as heuristics, right?</p>
<p>And as we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>they can limit what the number of things to focus on,</p>
<p>because one thing that is really stressful</p>
<p>is trying to focus on everything all the time.</p>
<p>I mean, trying to navigate the public health</p>
<p>around anything, the public health information</p>
<p>around anything is kind of overwhelming.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, for stress,</p>
<p>you see a lot in the stresses will crush you,</p>
<p>and then you can also find evidence</p>
<p>that stress will grow you.</p>
<p>How should we, the listeners, think about stress?</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s the most adaptive way to think about stress?</p>
<p>And should we talk about our stress?</p>
<p>Should we not talk about our stress?</p>
<p>Is there a short list of ways</p>
<p>that we can cope with stress better?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or maybe I should be careful with the word cope.</p>
<p>Is there a way that we can leverage stress to our advantage?</p>
<p>Great, yeah, and that&rsquo;s an important nuance</p>
<p>in your language, which is people have, by and large,</p>
<p>come from a place of how do you manage stress?</p>
<p>How do you cope with it?</p>
<p>Which implies, how do you fight against it?</p>
<p>Vacation massages, yoga classes.</p>
<p>Fight against it or check out from it, right?</p>
<p>And yeah, the real challenge is how do we leverage it?</p>
<p>How do we utilize it?</p>
<p>How do we work with it?</p>
<p>And I have a lot of thoughts on this.</p>
<p>The first and most important thing</p>
<p>is to clarify our definition of stress.</p>
<p>So I think people often associate,</p>
<p>the negative stress mindset is so insidious</p>
<p>that now people define stress</p>
<p>with its negative consequences.</p>
<p>So the first step is to decouple that</p>
<p>and to realize that stress is a neutral, right,</p>
<p>yet to be determined effect of experiencing</p>
<p>or anticipating adversity in your goal-related efforts.</p>
<p>So let me unpack that a little more.</p>
<p>You can be in the midst of it</p>
<p>or you could just be worried about something happening.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one aspect.</p>
<p>Second is adversity or challenge,</p>
<p>so something that&rsquo;s working against you.</p>
<p>But the third piece is critical</p>
<p>and that is in your goal-related efforts.</p>
<p>What that means is that we only stress</p>
<p>about things we care about, things that matter to us.</p>
<p>So this is really important, right,</p>
<p>because stress is linked with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the other side of the coin of things we care about.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s the first thing to realize, right,</p>
<p>that as humans, we stress because we care</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t stress about things we don&rsquo;t care about.</p>
<p>So the simplified example I like to use is,</p>
<p>if Johnny was failing school,</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t stress you out unless Johnny was your son</p>
<p>or you were Johnny or you really cared</p>
<p>about educating the Johnnies of the world, right?</p>
<p>It only becomes stressful</p>
<p>to the extent that you care about it.</p>
<p>So why are we trying to fight or run away or hide</p>
<p>or merely cope with our stress</p>
<p>or overcome it through our massages</p>
<p>when the stress is connected to the things we care about?</p>
<p>So then the question becomes, okay, if that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>how can I better utilize or leverage</p>
<p>or respond to the inevitable stresses</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to experience?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying go out and seek out more stress.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that you&rsquo;re gonna experience stress</p>
<p>if you have any cares or values or passions</p>
<p>and most all of us do.</p>
<p>And so then what do you do?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve developed a three-step approach</p>
<p>to adopting a stresses-enhancing mindset.</p>
<p>And briefly, the first step is to just acknowledge</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re stressed, to own it, see it, be mindful of it.</p>
<p>The second step is to welcome it.</p>
<p>Why would you welcome it?</p>
<p>You welcome it because inherently in that stress</p>
<p>is something you care about.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re using it as an opportunity</p>
<p>to reconnect to what is it that I care about here?</p>
<p>And then the third step is to utilize the stress response</p>
<p>to achieve the thing that you care about,</p>
<p>not spend your time, money, effort, energy</p>
<p>trying to get rid of the stress.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Makes sense, and I love it.</p>
<p>As somebody who&rsquo;s laboratory studies</p>
<p>the physiological effects of stress,</p>
<p>the effects that impress me the most are, for instance,</p>
<p>the narrowing of visual attention</p>
<p>that then drives a capacity to parse time more finely,</p>
<p>which then drives the capacity</p>
<p>to process information faster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a superpower.</p>
<p>And yes, it can feel uncomfortable often,</p>
<p>but I love the idea that acknowledging it, embracing it,</p>
<p>and then understanding its power and leveraging that power,</p>
<p>I think what I like so much about that framework</p>
<p>is that the stress response is very generic.</p>
<p>Unlike the relaxation response,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t actually have to train up the stress response.</p>
<p>So we all kind of get this as a freebie.</p>
<p>And then it sounds like it&rsquo;s a question</p>
<p>of what we end up doing with that.</p>
<p>Right, and Hans Selye, father of stress,</p>
<p>said himself it&rsquo;s a nonspecific response, right?</p>
<p>So it occurs, it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re channeling it.</p>
<p>And yeah, like we talked about before,</p>
<p>what most people do is they stress about the stress,</p>
<p>which then over exacerbates it,</p>
<p>or they check out from the stress,</p>
<p>which leads to depression and anhedonia,</p>
<p>because by checking out from stress,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also checking out from the things we care about.</p>
<p>And substance abuse.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Our colleague, Anna Lembke, who also,</p>
<p>we had the good fortune of having as a guest</p>
<p>on this podcast, talked a lot about this,</p>
<p>that so much of substance abuse,</p>
<p>because she runs the addiction clinic</p>
<p>over on the med side of campus,</p>
<p>it takes over people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>because of this increased ability</p>
<p>to find a solution to the stress</p>
<p>that then eventually becomes its own stressor</p>
<p>and its own problem.</p>
<p>Well, I love that mindset and framework.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love for you to tell us just a bit</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re up to right now,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s most exciting to you now.</p>
<p>If you are able or willing to talk about</p>
<p>some of the work that&rsquo;s on the way,</p>
<p>I saw a brief mention of something</p>
<p>on your publication&rsquo;s website of a paper</p>
<p>about influencers, online influencers and nutrition.</p>
<p>That might not be the main thrust of what you&rsquo;re up to,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re able to tell us about it,</p>
<p>sort of interesting,</p>
<p>given that a lot of the communication</p>
<p>in and around this podcast</p>
<p>takes place through social media.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve kind of launched into this landscape now</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m constantly bombarded with health information</p>
<p>and influencers, a term I didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>until a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>You are one.</p>
<p>One could argue one way or the other,</p>
<p>but so what is the deal with influencers?</p>
<p>Are they doing something good for health information</p>
<p>or are they ruining the landscape?</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t try and protect my feelings</p>
<p>because I now know that stress is actually an asset.</p>
<p>Yes, well, that work is part of a body of work</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been sort of venturing into,</p>
<p>which is to understand</p>
<p>where do these mindsets come from, right?</p>
<p>I mentioned sort of public health entities</p>
<p>as one source of, say, our mindsets about stress,</p>
<p>but I think that our mindsets are influenced</p>
<p>by four different sources.</p>
<p>First is our upbringing,</p>
<p>how our parents talked about things</p>
<p>like when we&rsquo;re stressed or food or other things.</p>
<p>Second is culture and media,</p>
<p>so movies, podcasts,</p>
<p>and now social media.</p>
<p>Third is influential others,</p>
<p>so what doctors say to us or close friends or peers.</p>
<p>And fourth is your conscious choice.</p>
<p>So we talked about that a little.</p>
<p>You do have, we have, as humans,</p>
<p>have the ability to be mindful of</p>
<p>and to change our mindsets.</p>
<p>But the social media and influencer stuff</p>
<p>has been in part an attempt to understand</p>
<p>where do our mindsets about things</p>
<p>like healthy foods come from?</p>
<p>And Brad Turnwald, who is a former grad student in my lab,</p>
<p>has done a series of really interesting studies on this,</p>
<p>showing that if you rate the nutritional quality</p>
<p>of the top-grossing movies in the last 20 years,</p>
<p>or you look at the Instagram accounts</p>
<p>of all the most influential people on Instagram,</p>
<p>and you analyze the nutrition content</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s shown is that, depending on the study,</p>
<p>70 to 90% of those movies or influencers</p>
<p>would fail the legal standards for advertising in the UK.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re putting out there nutrition contents</p>
<p>that are, maybe not surprisingly,</p>
<p>but undeniably unhealthy.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s interesting and important,</p>
<p>and it shows that where are we getting this mindset</p>
<p>that those unhealthy foods are pleasurable, desirable?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s maybe even more interesting than that</p>
<p>is some of the work that he and others in our lab</p>
<p>have done to show that the ways people are talking</p>
<p>about the foods they&rsquo;re eating really matter too.</p>
<p>So generally, what we&rsquo;ve found is that</p>
<p>when people talk about unhealthy foods,</p>
<p>they use language that connotes a sense of excitement,</p>
<p>fun, sexiness, danger, indulgence,</p>
<p>basically anything good and desirable, right?</p>
<p>This would be like cookies, cakes, high sugar,</p>
<p>just really unhealthy.</p>
<p>Truly unhealthy foods, or yeah, that&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>the objective of what health means is challenging,</p>
<p>but yeah, high fat, high sugar.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s pretty good agreement now</p>
<p>that excessive sugar isn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>And highly processed.</p>
<p>Yeah, highly processed, excessive sugar.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s general consensus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure someone will,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to come after anyone, come after me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stand behind that statement.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, when people are talking about,</p>
<p>if they do, which healthy foods aren&rsquo;t portrayed in media,</p>
<p>they aren&rsquo;t portrayed by influencers, rarely ever.</p>
<p>And when they are, they&rsquo;re often talked about</p>
<p>with language that conveys a sense of deprivation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nutritious, but it&rsquo;s sort of boring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less tasty. Recovery from the holidays.</p>
<p>Sort of the post-holiday reset, right.</p>
<p>And this is really important because,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing all this work,</p>
<p>and others are doing all this work trying to inform people</p>
<p>about what actually is good for them.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, there&rsquo;s this hurricane of other force</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s telling people, that&rsquo;s seeping into our minds</p>
<p>that sure, those might be good for you,</p>
<p>but those foods are not fun or sexy or indulgent</p>
<p>or desirable in any way, shape, or form, right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also paid advertising for fast foods</p>
<p>and sugary beverages and other things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not surprising that we have this mindset</p>
<p>that healthy foods are the less desirable thing to eat</p>
<p>because of those cultural and social forces.</p>
<p>What our work has just tried to do is to reveal that,</p>
<p>quantify it as a way to say, all right,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s maybe be a little bit more mindful</p>
<p>about how we talk about healthy foods.</p>
<p>And could, if you&rsquo;re a movie producer,</p>
<p>can you be a little bit more mindful to showcase</p>
<p>healthy and delicious foods</p>
<p>and have the characters talk about them</p>
<p>in ways that are more appealing?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of room for people who produce this content</p>
<p>to have an impact, not just on what people do,</p>
<p>but what they think about the foods they&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t thought about it until now,</p>
<p>but it makes sense that any food that&rsquo;s packaged</p>
<p>and can be sold can be woven into a film</p>
<p>or promoted by a celebrity influencer,</p>
<p>not a health influencer per se,</p>
<p>but a celebrity influencer because they&rsquo;ll get paid, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the ecosystem that allows them an income</p>
<p>and it feeds back on sales to the company.</p>
<p>And whereas things that can&rsquo;t be commoditized,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more difficult, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to, whoever makes oranges and sells oranges</p>
<p>is unlikely to promote oranges in a celebrity post</p>
<p>or in a movie because oranges can be purchased</p>
<p>from many, many sources.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no identifiable source of oranges</p>
<p>as there is with a packaged food, for instance.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the interesting thing we found in those studies</p>
<p>is that it wasn&rsquo;t driven by promoted content</p>
<p>or branded content.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some of that certainly.</p>
<p>And yeah, all of the promoted and branded content</p>
<p>is usually for processed high sugar foods,</p>
<p>but 90% or more of these foods that they were showing</p>
<p>were not promoted or branded.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of flexibility</p>
<p>in what these producers or influencers</p>
<p>could show on their media.</p>
<p>Although it goes both ways, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the producers</p>
<p>and the influencers&rsquo; responsibility.</p>
<p>The public is reacting to this.</p>
<p>And we showed too that people respond more positively.</p>
<p>There are more likes on posts about unhealthy foods.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a, yeah, it&rsquo;s a sort of distasteful</p>
<p>and in that, you know, it&rsquo;s a distasteful culture</p>
<p>around healthy eating.</p>
<p>And we really have a lot to do to change it.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s dopamine circuits through and through.</p>
<p>Just that the sight of some-</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Very calorie-dense, extremely tasty food</p>
<p>drives those dopamine circuits, you know?</p>
<p>And I realize that there are people out there</p>
<p>who derive the same sort of,</p>
<p>or similar levels of pleasure from healthy foods.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a wonderful thing if one can accomplish that.</p>
<p>So we just need more of that is what it sounds like.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really inspiring to me at least</p>
<p>is that it is possible, right?</p>
<p>I mean, people think, oh,</p>
<p>well, vegetables are just inherently less tasty</p>
<p>than ice cream.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, that&rsquo;s not necessarily true.</p>
<p>Also, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a competition, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to get my three-year-old to hate ice cream</p>
<p>in order for it to like broccoli.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more I can be doing to help shape</p>
<p>a more positive approach-oriented, indulgent mindset</p>
<p>around healthy, nutritious vegetables and fruits</p>
<p>and other foods, right?</p>
<p>In addition to having her like ice cream, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s totally fine.</p>
<p>Sounds like a really interesting study.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s published, please let me know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it was actually released this week.</p>
<p>Oh, great.</p>
<p>I will be sure to-</p>
<p>JAMA Internal Medicine.</p>
<p>JAMA Internal, okay.</p>
<p>Great journal.</p>
<p>I will definitely talk about it on social media</p>
<p>and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sounds very interesting.</p>
<p>What else are you up to lately that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>my favorite question to ask any scientist or colleague,</p>
<p>by the way, is what are you most excited about lately?</p>
<p>What are you up late thinking about</p>
<p>and getting up early thinking about?</p>
<p>Yeah, so hands down, the thing I&rsquo;m most excited,</p>
<p>well, I guess there&rsquo;s so many things.</p>
<p>The thing that I&rsquo;m most into right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing the most work in is,</p>
<p>you know, I started by getting inspired</p>
<p>by placebo effects in medicine.</p>
<p>I did a long stint in placebo or belief-like effects</p>
<p>in behavioral health,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re moving back into medicine.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really interested in looking at how we can work</p>
<p>with active drugs and treatments to make them better</p>
<p>and make the experience of them better,</p>
<p>by instilling different mindsets.</p>
<p>So one study we did along those lines,</p>
<p>we worked with kids who are undergoing treatment</p>
<p>for food allergies, so allergies to peanuts, for example.</p>
<p>This was with Kari Nadeau,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the head of the Stanford Allergy Center here.</p>
<p>She has a great treatment for food allergies.</p>
<p>Basically, kids take gradually increasing doses</p>
<p>of the thing they&rsquo;re allergic to, like peanuts,</p>
<p>and over the course of six or seven months,</p>
<p>these kids become, you know, less reactive to peanuts.</p>
<p>And the problem with that treatment</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s really difficult</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re having all sorts</p>
<p>of negative symptoms and side effects.</p>
<p>These kids are getting itchy mouths and upset stomach,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re puking, and it&rsquo;s scary</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re literally eating the thing</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve been told might kill them, right?</p>
<p>And what we did in this study was we attempted</p>
<p>to improve the experience and outcomes of that</p>
<p>by reframing mindsets about the symptoms</p>
<p>and the side effects.</p>
<p>So as it was being conducted before,</p>
<p>the kids were told, look, these side effects</p>
<p>are just an unfortunate byproduct of this treatment,</p>
<p>and you have to sort of endure them to get through it.</p>
<p>But what we found in our conversation with Kari</p>
<p>was that the reality of those side effects</p>
<p>was not so negative.</p>
<p>In fact, they were mechanistically linked</p>
<p>to the body learning how to tolerate peanuts or the allergen.</p>
<p>And so what we did was we worked within a trial,</p>
<p>they were all getting the treatment,</p>
<p>but half of them were helped</p>
<p>to see this more positive mindsets,</p>
<p>that symptoms and side effects from this treatment</p>
<p>were a positive signal that the treatment was working</p>
<p>and their bodies were getting stronger.</p>
<p>And what we found was that that mindset</p>
<p>led to reductions in anxiety,</p>
<p>fewer symptoms when at the highest doses,</p>
<p>and most interestingly of all, they had better outcomes.</p>
<p>So based on immune markers</p>
<p>that were a sign of the allergic tolerance,</p>
<p>those who had this mindset throughout</p>
<p>had better outcomes to the treatment.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just one example.</p>
<p>I think my goal is really to move us</p>
<p>beyond the placebo versus drug,</p>
<p>mindset versus behavior,</p>
<p>to get to a place where we can blend them together</p>
<p>and maximize the benefit of these treatments.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re doing a lot of studies like that.</p>
<p>How can we improve treatment for cancer</p>
<p>with different mindsets?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done some work recently with the COVID-19 vaccine</p>
<p>and symptoms and side effects.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m really passionate about right now.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to read that study.</p>
<p>Is that one out or on the way?</p>
<p>Okay, well then I will also read and communicate with you</p>
<p>and then about that study.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe you would come on Instagram</p>
<p>and do a little Instagram Live</p>
<p>to make sure that I don&rsquo;t screw up the delivery</p>
<p>and that we can hear it direct</p>
<p>from the person who ran the study.</p>
<p>I find this issue of side effects really interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take a lot of prescription drugs,</p>
<p>but recently I was prescribed a few</p>
<p>and the list of side effects is incredible.</p>
<p>And it just goes on and on and on.</p>
<p>I realized some of that is legal protections.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to believe</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re actually expecting anyone to read those</p>
<p>because you need a high-powered microscope</p>
<p>to read this print.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly fine print.</p>
<p>But I did realize that in reading over the side effects</p>
<p>that one primes themselves to experience those side effects.</p>
<p>And so now I just rip up the side effects thing</p>
<p>or the sheet and just throw it away.</p>
<p>I just take it as recommended.</p>
<p>Do you think it works in the other direction too?</p>
<p>Where if an effective medication</p>
<p>is supposed to have result A, B, or C</p>
<p>and you are told again and again</p>
<p>how effective it is for that treatment,</p>
<p>that it could amplify the effect.</p>
<p>So in other words, it&rsquo;s strictly a placebo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not nocebo as you described before,</p>
<p>but that perhaps at a lower dose,</p>
<p>given medication could have a amplified effect</p>
<p>or at a appropriate dose, if you will,</p>
<p>it could have a super physiological effect.</p>
<p>Has that ever been demonstrated?</p>
<p>To some degree.</p>
<p>I think where it gets tricky is for a long time,</p>
<p>people thought the effects of placebos</p>
<p>were expectancy based.</p>
<p>So you expect to get a benefit and that benefit occurs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly some truth to that.</p>
<p>But I think the mindset approach is more powerful</p>
<p>because it helps us understand the mechanisms.</p>
<p>So if you just expect that your blood pressure will go down,</p>
<p>what are the mechanisms through which that expectation</p>
<p>would lead to your blood pressure going down?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to even understand that.</p>
<p>But if you have the mindset that you&rsquo;re in good hands,</p>
<p>that this is being taken care of,</p>
<p>that this illness is not going to kill you,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re being treated well,</p>
<p>then you can start to unpack the mechanisms</p>
<p>through which blood pressure could be relieved.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s anxiety reduction.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s changing the sort of anticipation</p>
<p>of what are the prioritization</p>
<p>of what the body needs to focus on.</p>
<p>And so I really think that the work of the future</p>
<p>needs to be on getting more sophisticated</p>
<p>about what is the mindset that we&rsquo;re instilling</p>
<p>when we say something will work or it won&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>and how do we understand the mechanisms</p>
<p>through which that changes physiology?</p>
<p>So to answer your question,</p>
<p>I think that that could be true,</p>
<p>but it depends on what actually</p>
<p>is the mindset you&rsquo;re evoking.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re a parent and to the other parents out there,</p>
<p>but also to kids and people who don&rsquo;t have kids,</p>
<p>what is the best way to learn and teach mindsets?</p>
<p>I mean, clearly a conversation like this informs me</p>
<p>and many other people out there about mindsets</p>
<p>and how we can adopt them.</p>
<p>But it also seems to me that if we have the opportunity</p>
<p>to teach mindsets and really cultivate certain mindsets,</p>
<p>that the world would be a much better place.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>How does one go about that?</p>
<p>Given that there were kids and we are all being bombarded</p>
<p>with conflicting information all the time,</p>
<p>how do we anchor to a mindset?</p>
<p>Yeah, and you&rsquo;re getting at my other major passion</p>
<p>right now, which is what we&rsquo;re calling in our lab,</p>
<p>meta mindset.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on this with Chris Evans and others,</p>
<p>and that is how do we consciously</p>
<p>and deliberately change our mindsets?</p>
<p>And the first step is really simple,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just to be aware that you have them,</p>
<p>that the world, your beliefs</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t sort of an unmitigated reflection of reality</p>
<p>as it objectively is.</p>
<p>They are filtered through our interpretations,</p>
<p>our expectations, our frameworks,</p>
<p>and simplifications of that reality.</p>
<p>And as you know your work and as you know so well,</p>
<p>all of, most of what goes on in our brain</p>
<p>is an interpretation of reality.</p>
<p>Mindsets are just the simplified core assumptions</p>
<p>about things.</p>
<p>And the first step is to realize that we have them.</p>
<p>The second step is to start to think about</p>
<p>what the effects of those mindsets are on your life</p>
<p>to sort of play out the story, right?</p>
<p>Okay, I have this mindset that stress is debilitating.</p>
<p>How is that making me feel?</p>
<p>What is that leading me to do?</p>
<p>Is this mindset helpful or harmful?</p>
<p>The question isn&rsquo;t is the mindset right or wrong</p>
<p>because you can find evidence for or against it,</p>
<p>and we can fight about it till we&rsquo;re exhausted.</p>
<p>The question is, is it helpful or harmful?</p>
<p>And then you can go about seeking out ways</p>
<p>to adopt more useful mindsets.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of work</p>
<p>on how to actually do that.</p>
<p>How do you consciously change it?</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s really simple.</p>
<p>I think in cases where we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a lot of prior experience,</p>
<p>like the kids with allergies who are getting treatment,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have any other mindsets about symptoms.</p>
<p>So we just had the luxury of setting it, right?</p>
<p>When it comes to healthy food,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s harder to change people&rsquo;s mindsets</p>
<p>because we have a lot of baggage weighing us down.</p>
<p>As a parent, for me, I guess my number one piece of advice</p>
<p>is to lighten up trying to get your kids</p>
<p>to do certain things and focus more on helping them</p>
<p>to adopt more adaptive mindsets.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m by no means an expert at this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m testing it with my own child.</p>
<p>In real time, the real kind of experiment.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s how do I, you know, how do I resist the urge</p>
<p>to force my child to eat her dinner</p>
<p>so that she can have her dessert, right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the real urge.</p>
<p>No, you need to do that. Negotiating.</p>
<p>Because when you start thinking about it</p>
<p>in terms of mindset, you realize,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s just reinforcing to her</p>
<p>that the dessert is the exciting, fun thing to have.</p>
<p>And this thing that I have to do must be horrible.</p>
<p>So horrible that my, you know,</p>
<p>my parent is forcing me to do it, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s letting go a little bit of the behavior,</p>
<p>the objective reality, and really thinking</p>
<p>about the subjective reality</p>
<p>and focusing on adaptive mindsets.</p>
<p>So my goal as a parent has been to try to help her</p>
<p>instill a healthy mindset about eating,</p>
<p>that healthy foods are indulgent and delicious,</p>
<p>that the experience of stress is inevitable,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s natural, and that it can help,</p>
<p>going through stressful experience can help her learn,</p>
<p>grow, and become a more connected and happier individual.</p>
<p>And, you know, with exercise and physical activity,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t really gotten to that yet,</p>
<p>but we will with time.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I wrote down, and I&rsquo;m going to keep this</p>
<p>in the front of my mind going forward,</p>
<p>to continually ask,</p>
<p>what is the effect of my mindset about X?</p>
<p>And just to evaluate that about exercise,</p>
<p>about food, about school, about stress,</p>
<p>about relationships, about relationship to self, et cetera,</p>
<p>and to really think about that in a series of layers.</p>
<p>You think that would be a useful exercise?</p>
<p>Definitely, and you know, and your work speaks to this,</p>
<p>I mean, the mindful, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>I would, yeah, really urge against</p>
<p>people getting dogmatic about their mindset also, right?</p>
<p>Like, oh, I need to have the right mindset,</p>
<p>or, and if I don&rsquo;t have the right mind, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, mindset is a piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a piece of the puzzle that&rsquo;s really empowering</p>
<p>because we have access to it and we can change it,</p>
<p>but it is just one piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>So treat yourself like a scientist.</p>
<p>Look at your life, look at your mindsets,</p>
<p>see what&rsquo;s serving you, see what isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Find more useful, adaptive, and empowering mindsets</p>
<p>and live by those.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Now, in one version of this kind of discussion,</p>
<p>I would have asked the question I&rsquo;m gonna ask next</p>
<p>at the beginning, but I&rsquo;m going to ask it now</p>
<p>close to the end, which is,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a unique constellation of accomplishments</p>
<p>and attributes, and I only know a subset of them,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m curious, I&rsquo;m curious,</p>
<p>I want to know, what were you doing</p>
<p>when you first started your career?</p>
<p>And then, of course, because today&rsquo;s the first time</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve met in person, even though I&rsquo;ve known your work</p>
<p>for a long time and we&rsquo;re colleagues across campus.</p>
<p>So you run your laboratory where you do research.</p>
<p>You were also an athlete in university, a serious athlete.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re also a clinical psychologist,</p>
<p>is that right?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>I was trained as a clinical psychologist,</p>
<p>so my PhD is in clinical psychology,</p>
<p>so I was closely-connected to the disease</p>
<p>of Alzheimer&rsquo;s and trauma.</p>
<p>Do you see patients or did you see patients</p>
<p>at that time?</p>
<p>I did, yes, I don&rsquo;t anymore.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a very unique constellation</p>
<p>of practitioner and researcher.</p>
<p>So what are the mindsets that you try and adopt</p>
<p>on a regular basis as a consequence</p>
<p>or in relation to those things,</p>
<p>or athlete, researcher, clinician?</p>
<p>You know, for yourself, as you move through life,</p>
<p>that all challenge is good,</p>
<p>or do you have any kind of central mindsets</p>
<p>that help you navigate through,</p>
<p>has to be a pretty complex set of daily routines</p>
<p>given everything that you juggle.</p>
<p>But I think that people like you are unique</p>
<p>in that you have the inside knowledge</p>
<p>of how this stuff works,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve also existed in these different domains.</p>
<p>And I know a lot of listeners</p>
<p>have a more athletic slant to their life</p>
<p>or a more cognitive, or some are raising kids,</p>
<p>or some people are just, you know,</p>
<p>are doing any number of things.</p>
<p>So this is where I think it would be useful</p>
<p>for people to hear, kind of, what do you do?</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s certainly true in my case</p>
<p>that research is me-search.</p>
<p>Everything that I study as an intellectual</p>
<p>has come from my own experience</p>
<p>or my own failings, right?</p>
<p>And when I was, you know, really intensely exercising</p>
<p>and training, those were the questions I asked.</p>
<p>When I was dealing with eating</p>
<p>and, you know, concerns about my weight,</p>
<p>those were the questions I asked.</p>
<p>When I was stressed about my dissertation,</p>
<p>I decided to do my dissertation on stress, right?</p>
<p>You know, now I think we&rsquo;re in the midst</p>
<p>of a global pandemic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, how can our mindsets be useful here?</p>
<p>You know, so I, you know, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an obvious answer to your question</p>
<p>other than the guiding light for me</p>
<p>has been an undercurrent of understanding</p>
<p>that our mindsets matter.</p>
<p>I think I got that very clearly and deeply as a child,</p>
<p>both through my experiences as an athlete.</p>
<p>You know, I know many of your listeners are athletes.</p>
<p>Any athlete knows that you can be the same physical being</p>
<p>from one day to the next, one moment to the next,</p>
<p>and perform completely differently</p>
<p>just depending on what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>I was a gymnast growing up, and if you can&rsquo;t visualize,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t see something in your mind,</p>
<p>you have no chance when you get up there</p>
<p>on the balance beam, right?</p>
<p>And I also, my father was a martial artist,</p>
<p>a teacher of meditation, so this kind of mind-body work</p>
<p>was baked into me from an early age.</p>
<p>And I think what I&rsquo;ve done recently</p>
<p>is to try to understand it scientifically</p>
<p>and, more importantly, to figure out</p>
<p>how can we do better with this, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all talking about AI taking over the world</p>
<p>and technology, this, and personalized medicine, that,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like we have done so little,</p>
<p>relatively so little with the human resource,</p>
<p>our human brains, that the potential</p>
<p>for which is so great, and we&rsquo;ve done almost nothing.</p>
<p>Take the placebo effect.</p>
<p>We know a lot about what it is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done almost nothing to leverage that in medicine,</p>
<p>consciously and deliberately.</p>
<p>So my, what keeps me going,</p>
<p>what gets me through the hard times</p>
<p>is just that burning question of what is going on here</p>
<p>and what more can I do with the power of my mind?</p>
<p>Well, I and millions of other people</p>
<p>are so grateful that you do this work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so important, and it&rsquo;s truly unique.</p>
<p>Tell us where people can learn more about your research,</p>
<p>where they can find you online.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try and persuade you</p>
<p>to take more of a social media presence going forward,</p>
<p>but whether or not I succeed in that effort or not,</p>
<p>where can people find you?</p>
<p>Ask questions, find your papers, learn more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to have you back for a conversation in the future,</p>
<p>but in the meantime.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s been such an honor</p>
<p>getting to chat with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, you have such an impact on the world,</p>
<p>and I look forward,</p>
<p>I hope we can do some science together also.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, all our papers and materials and interventions</p>
<p>are housed on our website, mbl.stanford.edu.</p>
<p>We also have a link there too</p>
<p>that takes you to Stanford SPARK,</p>
<p>which stands for Social Psychological Answers</p>
<p>to Real-World Questions.</p>
<p>We have a lot of toolkits on that website,</p>
<p>including a toolkit for this Rethink Stress approach</p>
<p>of acknowledging, welcoming, and utilizing your stress.</p>
<p>And then I guess I&rsquo;m on Twitter,</p>
<p>Aaliyah Crump, I don&rsquo;t do much there,</p>
<p>but maybe I will start to.</p>
<p>Well, those are all great resources.</p>
<p>We will provide links to all of those</p>
<p>for our listeners and viewers.</p>
<p>And I also hope to convince you to write a book</p>
<p>or many books in the future.</p>
<p>The world needs to know about this,</p>
<p>but thank you so much for taking time</p>
<p>out of your exceedingly busy schedule</p>
<p>to talk to us about these ideas.</p>
<p>I learned so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to definitely think about</p>
<p>what is the effect of my mindset about blank</p>
<p>in every category of life,</p>
<p>and really just on behalf of everybody and myself.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>And I guess I just want to end by saying,</p>
<p>I think this work is really the tip of the iceberg</p>
<p>of what can and should be done.</p>
<p>And so I really invite you, your listeners,</p>
<p>and anybody who&rsquo;s inspired by this work,</p>
<p>if they want to share stories</p>
<p>or want to partner on a collaboration</p>
<p>please reach out.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Well, and the comment section on YouTube</p>
<p>is a great place to do that as well.</p>
<p>You will hear from them.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Allie.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me</p>
<p>for my conversation with Dr. Aaliyah Crum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing by now you can appreciate</p>
<p>the enormous impact that mindsets have</p>
<p>on our biology and our psychology</p>
<p>and how those interact at the level of mind and body.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about Dr. Crum&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>and perhaps even be a research subject</p>
<p>in one of their upcoming studies on mindsets,</p>
<p>you can go to mbl.stanford.edu.</p>
<p>There, you will also see a tab for support</p>
<p>where if you like, you can make a tax deductible donation</p>
<p>to support the incredible research</p>
<p>that Dr. Crum and her colleagues are doing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re learning from</p>
<p>and or enjoying the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>please subscribe to our YouTube channel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a terrific zero cost way to support us.</p>
<p>In addition, please subscribe to us on Apple and Spotify.</p>
<p>And on Apple, you have the opportunity</p>
<p>to leave us up to a five-star review.</p>
<p>On YouTube, you also have the opportunity</p>
<p>to leave us questions and comments</p>
<p>in the comment section below any of the episodes.</p>
<p>You can also make suggestions about future guests</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d like us to host on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Please also check out our sponsors</p>
<p>mentioned at the beginning of this episode.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following us on Instagram</p>
<p>and on Twitter, we are Huberman Lab</p>
<p>at both Instagram and Twitter.</p>
<p>And there I teach neuroscience in short form,</p>
<p>sometimes videos, sometimes text slides.</p>
<p>Some of that information overlaps</p>
<p>with what you find on the podcast.</p>
<p>Some of it is distinct from what you find on the podcast.</p>
<p>And as mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>because they make single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that are of the absolute highest quality</p>
<p>and they ship international.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find many of the supplements</p>
<p>that have been discussed on various episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>And you will find various protocols</p>
<p>related to those supplements.</p>
<p>In closing, I&rsquo;d like to thank you once again</p>
<p>for joining me for my discussion</p>
<p>about mindsets with Dr. Aaliyah Crum.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
