    <p>The following is a conversation with Daniel Kahneman, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics</p>
<p>for his integration of economic science with the psychology of human behavior,</p>
<p>judgment, and decision making. He&rsquo;s the author of the popular book Thinking Fast and Slow that</p>
<p>summarizes in an accessible way his research of several decades, often in collaboration with</p>
<p>Amos Tversky on cognitive biases, prospect theory, and happiness. The central thesis of this work</p>
<p>is the dichotomy between two modes of thought. What he calls system one is fast, instinctive,</p>
<p>and emotional. System two is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book</p>
<p>delineates cognitive biases associated with each of these two types of thinking.</p>
<p>His study of the human mind and its peculiar and fascinating limitations are both instructive and</p>
<p>inspiring for those of us seeking to engineer intelligent systems. This is the Artificial</p>

<p>Lex Friedman spelled F R I D M A N. I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation. I hope that works for you and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the</p>
<p>listening experience. This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App</p>
<p>Store. I personally use Cash App to send money to friends, but you can also use it to buy, sell,</p>
<p>and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds. Cash App also has a new investing feature. You can buy</p>
<p>fractions of a stock, say one dollar&rsquo;s worth, no matter what the stock price is. Broker services</p>
<p>are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC. I&rsquo;m excited to be</p>
<p>working with Cash App to support one of my favorite organizations called First, best known</p>
<p>for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions. They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of students in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating at Charity Navigator, which means</p>
<p>that donated money is used to maximum effectiveness. When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google</p>
<p>Play and use code LEXPODCAST, you&rsquo;ll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>which again is an organization that I&rsquo;ve personally seen inspire girls and boys to dream</p>
<p>of engineering a better world. And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Daniel Kahneman.</p>
<p>You tell a story of an SS soldier early in the war, World War II, in Nazi occupied France in</p>
<p>Paris, where you grew up. He picked you up and hugged you and showed you a picture of a boy,</p>
<p>Daniel Kahneman. Maybe not realizing that you were Jewish.</p>
<p>Not maybe, certainly not.</p>
<p>So I told you I&rsquo;m from the Soviet Union that was significantly impacted by the war as well,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m Jewish as well. What do you think World War II taught us about human psychology broadly?</p>
<p>Well, I think the only big surprise is the extermination policy, genocide,</p>
<p>by the German people. That&rsquo;s when you look back on it, and I think that&rsquo;s a major surprise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a surprise because&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a surprise that they could do it. It&rsquo;s a surprise that enough people</p>
<p>willingly participated in that. This is a surprise. Now it&rsquo;s no longer a surprise,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s changed many people&rsquo;s views, I think, about human beings. Certainly for me,</p>
<p>the Ackman trial, that teaches you something because it&rsquo;s very clear that if it could happen</p>
<p>in Germany, it could happen anywhere. It&rsquo;s not that the Germans were special.</p>
<p>This could happen anywhere.</p>
<p>So what do you think that is? Do you think we&rsquo;re all capable of evil? We&rsquo;re all capable of cruelty?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think in those terms. I think that what is certainly possible is you can dehumanize people</p>
<p>so that you treat them not as people anymore, but as animals. And the same way that you can slaughter</p>
<p>animals without feeling much of anything, it can be the same. And when you feel that,</p>
<p>I think, the combination of dehumanizing the other side and having uncontrolled power over</p>
<p>other people, I think that doesn&rsquo;t bring out the most generous aspect of human nature.</p>
<p>So that Nazi soldier, he was a good man. And he was perfectly capable of killing a lot of people,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure he did.</p>
<p>But what did the Jewish people mean to Nazis? So what the dismissal of Jewish as worthy of?</p>
<p>IA Again, this is surprising that it was so extreme,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not one thing in human nature. I don&rsquo;t want to call it evil, but the distinction between</p>
<p>the in group and the out group, that is very basic. So that&rsquo;s built in. The loyalty and</p>
<p>affection towards in group and the willingness to dehumanize the out group, that is in human nature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think probably didn&rsquo;t need the Holocaust to teach us that. But the Holocaust is</p>
<p>a very sharp lesson of what can happen to people and what people can do.</p>
<p>SL. So the effect of the in group and the out group. IA It&rsquo;s clear. Those were people,</p>
<p>you could shoot them. They were not human. There was no empathy, or very, very little empathy left.</p>
<p>So occasionally, there might have been. And very quickly, by the way, the empathy disappeared,</p>
<p>if there was initially. And the fact that everybody around you was doing it,</p>
<p>that completely, the group doing it, and everybody shooting Jews, I think that makes it permissible.</p>
<p>Now, how much, whether it could happen in every culture, or whether the Germans were just</p>
<p>particularly efficient and disciplined, so they could get away with it. It&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>question. SL. Are these artifacts of history or is it human nature? IA I think that&rsquo;s really human</p>
<p>nature. You put some people in a position of power relative to other people, and then they become</p>
<p>less human, they become different. SL. But in general, in war, outside of concentration camps</p>
<p>in World War Two, it seems that war brings out darker sides of human nature, but also the beautiful</p>
<p>things about human nature. IA Well, I mean, what it brings out is the loyalty among soldiers. I mean,</p>
<p>it brings out the bonding, male bonding, I think is a very real thing that happens. And there is</p>
<p>a certain thrill to friendship, and there is certainly a certain thrill to friendship under</p>
<p>risk and to shared risk. And so people have very profound emotions, up to the point where it gets</p>
<p>so traumatic that little is left. SL. So let&rsquo;s talk about psychology a little bit. In your book,</p>
<p>Thinking Fast and Slow, you describe two modes of thought, system one, the fast and instinctive,</p>
<p>and emotional one, and system two, the slower, deliberate, logical one. At the risk of asking</p>
<p>Darwin to discuss theory of evolution, can you describe distinguishing characteristics for people</p>
<p>who have not read your book of the two systems? IA Well, I mean, the word system is a bit</p>
<p>misleading, but at the same time it&rsquo;s misleading, it&rsquo;s also very useful. But what I call system one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to think of it as a family of activities. And primarily, the way I describe it</p>
<p>is there are different ways for ideas to come to mind. And some ideas come to mind automatically,</p>
<p>and the standard example is two plus two, and then something happens to you. And in other cases,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to do something, you&rsquo;ve got to work in order to produce the idea. And my example,</p>
<p>I always give the same pair of numbers as 27 times 14, I think. SL. You have to perform some</p>
<p>algorithm in your head, some steps. IA Yes, and it takes time. It&rsquo;s a very difference. Nothing</p>
<p>comes to mind except something comes to mind, which is the algorithm, I mean, that you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>to perform. And then it&rsquo;s work, and it engages short term memory, it engages executive function,</p>
<p>and it makes you incapable of doing other things at the same time. So the main characteristic of</p>
<p>system two is that there is mental effort involved, and there is a limited capacity for mental effort,</p>
<p>whereas system one is effortless, essentially. That&rsquo;s the major distinction.</p>
<p>SL. So you talk about there, you know, it&rsquo;s really convenient to talk about two systems,</p>
<p>but you also mentioned just now and in general that there&rsquo;s no distinct two systems in the brain</p>
<p>from a neurobiological, even from a psychology perspective. But why does it seem to, from the</p>
<p>experiments you&rsquo;ve conducted, there does seem to be kind of emergent two modes of thinking? So</p>
<p>at some point, these kinds of systems came into a brain architecture. Maybe mammals share it.</p>
<p>Or do you not think of it at all in those terms that it&rsquo;s all a mush and these two things just</p>
<p>emerge? RL. Evolutionary theorizing about this is cheap and easy. So it&rsquo;s the way I think about it</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s very clear that animals have perceptual system, and that includes an ability</p>
<p>to understand the world, at least to the extent that they can predict, they can&rsquo;t explain anything,</p>
<p>but they can anticipate what&rsquo;s going to happen. And that&rsquo;s a key form of understanding the world.</p>
<p>And my crude idea is that what I call system two, well, system two grew out of this.</p>
<p>And, you know, there is language and there is the capacity of manipulating ideas and the capacity</p>
<p>of imagining futures and of imagining counterfactual things that haven&rsquo;t happened</p>
<p>and to do conditional thinking. And there are really a lot of abilities that without language</p>
<p>and without the very large brain that we have compared to others would be impossible. Now,</p>
<p>system one is more like what the animals are, but system one also can talk. I mean,</p>
<p>it has language. It understands language. Indeed, it speaks for us. I mean, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not choosing every word as a deliberate process. The words, I have some idea and then</p>
<p>the words come out and that&rsquo;s automatic and effortless. And many of the experiments you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done is to show that, listen, system one exists and it does speak for us and we should be careful</p>
<p>about the voice it provides. Well, I mean, you know, we have to trust it because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the speed at which it acts. System two, if we&rsquo;re dependent on system two for survival,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t survive very long because it&rsquo;s very slow. Yeah. Crossing the street.</p>
<p>Crossing the street. I mean, many things depend on their being automatic. One very important aspect</p>
<p>of system one is that it&rsquo;s not instinctive. You use the word instinctive. It contains skills that</p>
<p>clearly have been learned. So that skilled behavior like driving a car or speaking, in fact,</p>
<p>skilled behavior has to be learned. And so it doesn&rsquo;t, you know, you don&rsquo;t come equipped with</p>
<p>driving. You have to learn how to drive and you have to go through a period where driving is not</p>
<p>automatic before it becomes automatic. So. Yeah. You construct, I mean, this is where you talk</p>
<p>about heuristic and biases is you, to make it automatic, you create a pattern and then system</p>
<p>one essentially matches a new experience against the previously seen pattern. And when that match</p>
<p>is not a good one, that&rsquo;s when the cognitive, all the mess happens, but it&rsquo;s most of the time</p>
<p>it works. And so it&rsquo;s pretty. Most of the time, the anticipation of what&rsquo;s going to happen next</p>
<p>is correct. And most of the time the plan about what you have to do is correct. And so most of</p>
<p>the time everything works just fine. What&rsquo;s interesting actually is that in some sense,</p>
<p>system one is much better at what it does than system two is at what it does. That is there is</p>
<p>that quality of effortlessly solving enormously complicated problems, which clearly exists so</p>
<p>that the chess player, a very good chess player, all the moves that come to their mind are strong</p>
<p>moves. So all the selection of strong moves happens unconsciously and automatically and</p>
<p>very, very fast. And all that is in system one. So system two verifies.</p>
<p>So along this line of thinking, really what we are are machines that construct</p>
<p>a pretty effective system one. You could think of it that way. So we&rsquo;re not talking about humans,</p>
<p>but if we think about building artificial intelligence systems, robots, do you think</p>
<p>all the features and bugs that you have highlighted in human beings are useful</p>
<p>for constructing AI systems? So both systems are useful for perhaps instilling in robots?</p>
<p>What is happening these days is that actually what is happening in deep learning is more like</p>
<p>a system one product than like a system two product. I mean, deep learning matches patterns</p>
<p>and anticipate what&rsquo;s going to happen. So it&rsquo;s highly predictive. What deep learning</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have and many people think that this is the critical, it doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to</p>
<p>reason. So there is no system two there. But I think very importantly, it doesn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>causality or any way to represent meaning and to represent real interactions. So until that is</p>
<p>solved, what can be accomplished is marvelous and very exciting, but limited.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually really nice to think of current advances in machine learning as essentially</p>
<p>system one advances. So how far can we get with just system one? If we think of deep learning</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence systems? I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s very clear that deep mind has already</p>
<p>gone way beyond what people thought was possible. I think the thing that has impressed me most about</p>
<p>the developments in AI is the speed. It&rsquo;s that things, at least in the context of deep learning,</p>
<p>and maybe this is about to slow down, but things moved a lot faster than anticipated.</p>
<p>The transition from solving chess to solving Go, that&rsquo;s bewildering how quickly it went.</p>
<p>The move from Alpha Go to Alpha Zero is sort of bewildering the speed at which they accomplished</p>
<p>that. Now, clearly, there are many problems that you can solve that way, but there are some problems</p>
<p>for which you need something else. Something like reasoning.</p>
<p>Well, reasoning and also, you know, one of the real mysteries, psychologist Gary Marcus, who is</p>
<p>also a critic of AI. I mean, what he points out, and I think he has a point, is that humans learn</p>
<p>quickly. Children don&rsquo;t need a million examples, they need two or three examples. So, clearly,</p>
<p>there is a fundamental difference. And what enables a machine to learn quickly, what you have</p>
<p>to build into the machine, because it&rsquo;s clear that you have to build some expectations or</p>
<p>or something in the machine to make it ready to learn quickly. That at the moment seems to be</p>
<p>unsolved. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that DeepMind is working on it, but if they have solved it, I haven&rsquo;t heard</p>
<p>yet. They&rsquo;re trying to actually, them and OpenAI are trying to start to get to use neural networks</p>
<p>to reason. So, assemble knowledge. Of course, causality is, temporal causality, is out of</p>
<p>reach to most everybody. You mentioned the benefits of System 1 is essentially that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fast, allows us to function in the world.</p>
<p>Fast and skilled, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s skill.</p>
<p>And it has a model of the world. You know, in a sense, I mean, there was the early phase of</p>
<p>AI attempted to model reasoning. And they were moderately successful, but, you know, reasoning</p>
<p>by itself doesn&rsquo;t get you much. Deep learning has been much more successful in terms of, you know,</p>
<p>what they can do. But now, it&rsquo;s an interesting question, whether it&rsquo;s approaching its limits.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I think absolutely. So, I just talked to Gian LeCun. He mentioned, you know, so he thinks</p>
<p>that the limits, we&rsquo;re not going to hit the limits with neural networks, that ultimately,</p>
<p>this kind of System 1 pattern matching will start to look like System 2 without significant</p>
<p>transformation of the architecture. So, I&rsquo;m more with the majority of the people who think that,</p>
<p>yes, neural networks will hit a limit in their capability.</p>
<p>He, on the one hand, I have heard him tell them it&rsquo;s a sub, it&rsquo;s essentially that, you know,</p>
<p>what they have accomplished is not a big deal, that they have just touched, that basically,</p>
<p>you know, they can&rsquo;t do unsupervised learning in an effective way. But you&rsquo;re telling me that he</p>
<p>thinks that the current, within the current architecture, you can do causality and reasoning?</p>
<p>So, he&rsquo;s very much a pragmatist in a sense that&rsquo;s saying that we&rsquo;re very far away,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s still, I think there&rsquo;s this idea that he says is, we can only see</p>
<p>one or two mountain peaks ahead and there might be either a few more after or</p>
<p>thousands more after. Yeah, so that kind of idea.</p>
<p>I heard that metaphor.</p>
<p>Yeah, right. But nevertheless, it doesn&rsquo;t see the final answer not fundamentally looking like one</p>
<p>that we currently have. So, neural networks being a huge part of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s very likely because pattern matching is so much of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And you can think of neural networks as processing information sequentially.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you know, there is an important aspect to, for example, you get systems that</p>
<p>translate and they do a very good job, but they really don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And for that, I&rsquo;m really quite surprised. For that, you would need an AI that has sensation,</p>
<p>an AI that is in touch with the world.</p>
<p>Yes, self awareness and maybe even something resembles consciousness kind of ideas.</p>
<p>Certainly awareness of, you know, awareness of what&rsquo;s going on so that the words have meaning</p>
<p>or can get, are in touch with some perception or some action.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s a big thing for Jan and as what he refers to as grounding to the physical space.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about the same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so how do you ground?</p>
<p>I mean, the grounding, without grounding, then you get a machine that doesn&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s talking about because it is talking about the world ultimately.</p>
<p>The question, the open question is what it means to ground. I mean, we&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>human centric in our thinking, but what does it mean for a machine to understand what it means</p>
<p>to be in this world? Does it need to have a body? Does it need to have a finiteness like we humans</p>
<p>have all of these elements? It&rsquo;s a very, it&rsquo;s an open question.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not sure about having a body, but having a perceptual system,</p>
<p>having a body would be very helpful too. I mean, if you think about human, mimicking human,</p>
<p>you know, but having a perception that seems to be essential so that you can build,</p>
<p>you can accumulate knowledge about the world. So if you can imagine a human completely paralyzed,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot that the human brain could learn, you know, with a paralyzed body.</p>
<p>So if we got a machine that could do that, that would be a big deal.</p>
<p>TK And then the flip side of that, something you see in children and something in machine</p>
<p>learning world is called active learning. Maybe it is also in, is being able to play with the world.</p>
<p>How important for developing System 1 or System 2 do you think it is to play with the world?</p>
<p>To be able to interact with the world?</p>
<p>MG A lot of what you learn is you learn to anticipate the outcomes of your actions. I mean,</p>
<p>you can see that how babies learn it, you know, with their hands, how they learn, you know,</p>
<p>to connect, you know, the movements of their hands with something that clearly is something</p>
<p>that happens in the brain and the ability of the brain to learn new patterns. So, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that you get with artificial limbs, that you connect it and then people learn</p>
<p>to operate the artificial limb, you know, really impressively quickly, at least from what I hear.</p>
<p>So we have a system that is ready to learn the world through action.</p>
<p>TK At the risk of going into way too mysterious of land,</p>
<p>what do you think it takes to build a system like that? Obviously, we&rsquo;re very far from understanding</p>
<p>how the brain works, but how difficult is it to build this mind of ours?</p>
<p>MG You know, I mean, I think that Jan LeCun&rsquo;s answer that we don&rsquo;t know how many mountains</p>
<p>there are, I think that&rsquo;s a very good answer. I think that, you know, if you look at what Ray</p>
<p>Kurzweil is saying, that strikes me as off the wall. But I think people are much more realistic</p>
<p>than that, where actually Demis Hassabis is and Jan is, and so the people are actually doing the</p>
<p>work fairly realistic, I think. TK To maybe phrase it another way,</p>
<p>from a perspective not of building it, but from understanding it,</p>
<p>how complicated are human beings in the following sense? You know, I work with autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>and pedestrians, so we tried to model pedestrians. How difficult is it to model a human being,</p>
<p>their perception of the world, the two systems they operate under, sufficiently to be able to</p>
<p>predict whether the pedestrian is going to cross the road or not?</p>
<p>MG I&rsquo;m, you know, I&rsquo;m fairly optimistic about that, actually, because what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is a huge amount of information that every vehicle has, and that feeds into one system,</p>
<p>into one gigantic system. And so anything that any vehicle learns becomes part of what the whole</p>
<p>system knows. And with a system multiplier like that, there is a lot that you can do.</p>
<p>So human beings are very complicated, and the system is going to make mistakes, but human</p>
<p>makes mistakes. I think that they&rsquo;ll be able to, I think they are able to anticipate pedestrians,</p>
<p>otherwise a lot would happen. They&rsquo;re able to, you know, they&rsquo;re able to get into a roundabout</p>
<p>and into traffic, so they must know both to expect or to anticipate how people will react</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re sneaking in. And there&rsquo;s a lot of learning that&rsquo;s involved in that.</p>
<p>RL Currently, the pedestrians are treated as things that cannot be hit, and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>treated as agents with whom you interact in a game theoretic way. So, I mean, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a totally open problem, and every time somebody tries to solve it, it seems to be harder</p>
<p>than we think. And nobody&rsquo;s really tried to seriously solve the problem of that dance,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;ve thought about the problem of pedestrians, but you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>putting your life in the hands of the driver.</p>
<p>RL You know, there is a dance, there&rsquo;s part of the dance that would be quite complicated,</p>
<p>but for example, when I cross the street and there is a vehicle approaching, I look the driver</p>
<p>in the eye, and I think many people do that. And, you know, that&rsquo;s a signal that I&rsquo;m sending,</p>
<p>and I would be sending that machine to an autonomous vehicle, and it had better understand</p>
<p>it, because it means I&rsquo;m crossing.</p>
<p>RL So, and there&rsquo;s another thing you do, that actually, so I&rsquo;ll tell you what you do,</p>
<p>because we watched, I&rsquo;ve watched hundreds of hours of video on this, is when you step</p>
<p>in the street, you do that before you step in the street, and when you step in the street,</p>
<p>you actually look away.</p>
<p>RL Look away.</p>
<p>RL Yeah. Now, what is that? What that&rsquo;s saying is, I mean, you&rsquo;re trusting that the car who</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t slowed down yet will slow down.</p>
<p>RL Yeah. And you&rsquo;re telling him, I&rsquo;m committed. I mean, this is like in a game of chicken,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m committed, and if I&rsquo;m committed, I&rsquo;m looking away. So, there is, you just have</p>
<p>to stop.</p>
<p>RL So, the question is whether a machine that observes that needs to understand mortality.</p>
<p>RL Here, I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s got to understand so much as it&rsquo;s got to anticipate. So, and</p>
<p>here, but you know, you&rsquo;re surprising me, because here I would think that maybe you</p>
<p>can anticipate without understanding, because I think this is clearly what&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>playing go or in playing chess. There&rsquo;s a lot of anticipation, and there is zero understanding.</p>
<p>RL Exactly.</p>
<p>RL So, I thought that you didn&rsquo;t need a model of the human and a model of the human mind</p>
<p>to avoid hitting pedestrians, but you are suggesting that actually‚Ä¶</p>
<p>RL There you go, yeah.</p>
<p>RL You do. Then it&rsquo;s a lot harder, I thought.</p>
<p>RL And I have a follow up question to see where your intuition lies. It seems that almost</p>
<p>every robot human collaboration system is a lot harder than people realize. So, do you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s possible for robots and humans to collaborate successfully? We talked a little</p>
<p>bit about semi autonomous vehicles, like in the Tesla autopilot, but just in tasks in</p>
<p>general. If you think we talked about current neural networks being kind of system one,</p>
<p>do you think those same systems can borrow humans for system two type tasks and collaborate</p>
<p>successfully?</p>
<p>RL Well, I think that in any system where humans and the machine interact, the human</p>
<p>will be superfluous within a fairly short time. That is, if the machine is advanced</p>
<p>enough so that it can really help the human, then it may not need the human for a long</p>
<p>time. Now, it would be very interesting if there are problems that for some reason the</p>
<p>machine cannot solve, but that people could solve. Then you would have to build into the</p>
<p>machine an ability to recognize that it is in that kind of problematic situation and</p>
<p>to call the human. That cannot be easy without understanding. That is, it must be very difficult</p>
<p>to program a recognition that you are in a problematic situation without understanding</p>
<p>the problem.</p>
<p>SL. That&rsquo;s very true. In order to understand the full scope of situations that are problematic,</p>
<p>you almost need to be smart enough to solve all those problems.</p>
<p>RL It&rsquo;s not clear to me how much the machine will need the human. I think the example of</p>
<p>chess is very instructive. I mean, there was a time at which Kasparov was saying that human</p>
<p>machine combinations will beat everybody. Even stockfish doesn&rsquo;t need people and Alpha</p>
<p>Zero certainly doesn&rsquo;t need people.</p>
<p>SL. The question is, just like you said, how many problems are like chess and how many</p>
<p>problems are not like chess? Every problem probably in the end is like chess. The question</p>
<p>is, how long is that transition period?</p>
<p>RL That&rsquo;s a question I would ask you. Autonomous vehicle, just driving, is probably a lot more</p>
<p>complicated than Go to solve that problem. Because it&rsquo;s open. That&rsquo;s not surprising to</p>
<p>me because there is a hierarchical aspect to this, which is recognizing a situation</p>
<p>and then within the situation bringing up the relevant knowledge. For that hierarchical</p>
<p>type of system to work, you need a more complicated system than we currently have.</p>
<p>SL. A lot of people think, because as human beings, this is probably the cognitive biases,</p>
<p>they think of driving as pretty simple because they think of their own experience. This is</p>
<p>actually a big problem for AI researchers or people thinking about AI because they evaluate</p>
<p>how hard a particular problem is based on very limited knowledge, based on how hard</p>
<p>it is for them to do the task. And then they take for granted, maybe you can speak to that</p>
<p>because most people tell me driving is trivial and humans in fact are terrible at driving</p>
<p>is what people tell me. And I see humans and humans are actually incredible at driving</p>
<p>and driving is really terribly difficult. Is that just another element of the effects</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve described in your work on the psychology side?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I haven&rsquo;t really, I would say that my research has contributed nothing to</p>
<p>understanding the ecology and to understanding the structure of situations and the complexity</p>
<p>of problems. So all we know is very clear that that goal, it&rsquo;s endlessly complicated,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very constrained. And in the real world, there are far fewer constraints and</p>
<p>many more potential surprises.</p>
<p>SL. So that&rsquo;s obvious because it&rsquo;s not always obvious to people, right? So when you think</p>
<p>about‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you know, people thought that reasoning was hard and perceiving was easy,</p>
<p>but you know, they quickly learned that actually modeling vision was tremendously complicated</p>
<p>and modeling, even proving theorems was relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>To push back on that a little bit on the quickly part, it took several decades to learn that</p>
<p>and most people still haven&rsquo;t learned that. I mean, our intuition, of course, AI researchers</p>
<p>have, but you drift a little bit outside the specific AI field, the intuition is still</p>
<p>perceptible to solve that.</p>
<p>No, I mean, that&rsquo;s true. Intuitions, the intuitions of the public haven&rsquo;t changed</p>
<p>radically. And they are, as you said, they&rsquo;re evaluating the complexity of problems by how</p>
<p>difficult it is for them to solve the problems. And that&rsquo;s got very little to do with the</p>
<p>complexities of solving them in AI.</p>
<p>SL. How do you think from the perspective of an AI researcher, do we deal with the intuitions</p>
<p>of the public? So in trying to think, arguably, the combination of hype investment and the</p>
<p>public intuition is what led to the AI winters. I&rsquo;m sure that same could be applied to tech</p>
<p>or that the intuition of the public leads to media hype, leads to companies investing</p>
<p>in the tech, and then the tech doesn&rsquo;t make the company&rsquo;s money. And then there&rsquo;s a crash.</p>
<p>Is there a way to educate people to fight the, let&rsquo;s call it system one thinking?</p>
<p>In general, no. I think that&rsquo;s the simple answer. And it&rsquo;s going to take a long time</p>
<p>before the understanding of what those systems can do becomes public knowledge. And then</p>
<p>the expectations, there are several aspects that are going to be very complicated. The</p>
<p>fact that you have a device that cannot explain itself is a major, major difficulty. And we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>already seeing that. I mean, this is really something that is happening. So it&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the judicial system. So you have system that are clearly better at predicting parole</p>
<p>violations than judges, but they can&rsquo;t explain their reasoning. And so people don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to trust them.</p>
<p>We seem to in system one, even use cues to make judgements about our environment. So</p>
<p>this explainability point, do you think humans can explain stuff?</p>
<p>No, but I mean, there is a very interesting aspect of that. Humans think they can explain</p>
<p>themselves. So when you say something and I ask you, why do you believe that? Then reasons</p>
<p>will occur to you. But actually, my own belief is that in most cases, the reasons have very</p>
<p>little to do with why you believe what you believe. So that the reasons are a story that</p>
<p>comes to your mind when you need to explain yourself. But people traffic in those explanations</p>
<p>I mean, the human interaction depends on those shared fictions and, and the stories that</p>
<p>people tell themselves.</p>
<p>You just made me actually realize and we&rsquo;ll talk about stories in a second. That not to</p>
<p>be cynical about it, but perhaps there&rsquo;s a whole movement of people trying to do explainable</p>
<p>AI. And really, we don&rsquo;t necessarily need to explain AI doesn&rsquo;t need to explain itself.</p>
<p>It just needs to tell a convincing story.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily, the story doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to reflect the truth as it</p>
<p>might, it just needs to be convincing. There&rsquo;s something to that.</p>
<p>You can say exactly the same thing in a way that sounds cynical or doesn&rsquo;t sound cynical.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But the objective of having an explanation is to tell a story that will be acceptable</p>
<p>to people. And, and, and for it to be acceptable and to be robustly acceptable, it has to have</p>
<p>some elements of truth. But, but the objective is for people to accept it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite brilliant, actually. But so on the, on the stories that we tell, sorry to</p>
<p>ask me, ask you the question that most people know the answer to, but you talk about two</p>
<p>selves in terms of how life is lived, the experienced self and remembering self. Can</p>
<p>you describe the distinction between the two?</p>
<p>Well, sure. I mean, the, there is an aspect of, of life that occasionally, you know, most</p>
<p>of the time we just live and we have experiences and they&rsquo;re better and they&rsquo;re worse and it</p>
<p>goes on over time. And mostly we forget everything that happens or we forget most of what happens.</p>
<p>Then occasionally you, when something ends or at different points, you evaluate the past</p>
<p>and you form a memory and the memory is schematic. It&rsquo;s not that you can roll a film of an interaction.</p>
<p>You construct, in effect, the elements of a story about an, about an episode. So there</p>
<p>is the experience and there is the story that is created about the experience. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I call the remembering. So I had the image of two selves. So there is a self that</p>
<p>lives and there is a self that evaluates life. Now the paradox and the deep paradox in that</p>
<p>is that we have one system or one self that does the living, but the other system, the</p>
<p>remembering self is all we get to keep. And basically decision making and, and everything</p>
<p>that we do is governed by our memories, not by what actually happened. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s governed</p>
<p>by, by the story that we told ourselves or by the story that we&rsquo;re keeping. So that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the distinction.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of brilliant ideas about the pursuit of happiness that come out of</p>
<p>that. What are the properties of happiness which emerge from a remembering self?</p>
<p>There are, there are properties of how we construct stories that are really important.</p>
<p>So that I studied a few, but, but a couple are really very striking. And one is that</p>
<p>in stories, time doesn&rsquo;t matter. There&rsquo;s a sequence of events or there are highlights</p>
<p>or not. And, and how long it took, you know, they lived happily ever after or three years</p>
<p>later or something. It, time really doesn&rsquo;t matter. And in stories, events matter, but</p>
<p>time doesn&rsquo;t. That, that leads to a very interesting set of problems because time is all we got</p>
<p>to live. I mean, you know, time is the currency of life. And yet time is not represented basically</p>
<p>in evaluated memories. So that, that creates a lot of paradoxes that I&rsquo;ve thought about.</p>
<p>Yeah. They&rsquo;re fascinating. But if you were to give advice on how one lives a happy life</p>
<p>based on such properties, what&rsquo;s the optimal?</p>
<p>You know, I gave up, I abandoned happiness research because I couldn&rsquo;t solve that problem.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t, I couldn&rsquo;t see. And in the first place, it&rsquo;s very clear that if you do talk</p>
<p>in terms of those two selves, then that what makes the remembering self happy and what</p>
<p>makes the experiencing self happy are different things. And I, I asked the question of, suppose</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re planning a vacation and you&rsquo;re just told that at the end of the vacation, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get an amnesic drug, so you remember nothing. And they&rsquo;ll also destroy all your photos.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;ll be nothing. Would you still go to the same vacation? And, and it&rsquo;s, it turns</p>
<p>out we go to vacations in large part to construct memories, not to have experiences, but to</p>
<p>construct memories. And it turns out that the vacation that you would want for yourself,</p>
<p>if you knew, you will not remember is probably not the same vacation that you will want for</p>
<p>yourself if you will remember. So I have no solution to these problems, but clearly those</p>
<p>are big issues.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve talked about, you&rsquo;ve talked about sort of how many minutes or hours you spend</p>
<p>about the vacation. It&rsquo;s an interesting way to think about it because that&rsquo;s how you really</p>
<p>experience the vacation outside the being in it. But there&rsquo;s also a modern, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you think about this or interact with it. There&rsquo;s a modern way to, um, magnify the</p>
<p>remembering self, which is by posting on Instagram, on Twitter, on social networks. A lot of people</p>
<p>live life for the picture that you take, that you post somewhere. And now thousands of people</p>
<p>share and potentially potentially millions. And then you can relive it even much more</p>
<p>than just those minutes. Do you think about that magnification much?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m too old for social networks. I, you know, I&rsquo;ve never seen Instagram, so</p>
<p>I cannot really speak intelligently about those things. I&rsquo;m just too old.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting to watch the exact effects you&rsquo;ve described.</p>
<p>Make a very big difference. I mean, and it will make, it will also make a difference.</p>
<p>And that I don&rsquo;t know whether, uh, it&rsquo;s clear that in some ways the devices that serve us</p>
<p>are supplant functions. So you don&rsquo;t have to remember phone numbers. You don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>you really don&rsquo;t have to know facts. I mean, the number of conversations I&rsquo;m involved with,</p>
<p>somebody says, well, let&rsquo;s look it up. Uh, so it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s in a way it&rsquo;s made conversations.</p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s, it means that it&rsquo;s much less important to know things. You know, it used to be very</p>
<p>important to know things. This is changing. So the requirements of that, that we have</p>
<p>for ourselves and for other people are changing because of all those supports and because,</p>
<p>and I have no idea what Instagram does, but it&rsquo;s, uh, well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, I wish I could</p>
<p>just have the, my remembering self could enjoy this conversation, but I&rsquo;ll get to enjoy it</p>
<p>even more by having watched, by watching it and then talking to others. It&rsquo;ll be about</p>
<p>a hundred thousand people as scary as this to say, well, listen or watch this, right?</p>
<p>It changes things. It changes the experience of the world that you seek out experiences</p>
<p>which could be shared in that way. It&rsquo;s in, and I haven&rsquo;t seen, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the same effects</p>
<p>that you described. And I don&rsquo;t think the psychology of that magnification has been</p>
<p>described yet because it&rsquo;s a new world.</p>
<p>But the sharing, there was a, there was a time when people read books and, uh, and,</p>
<p>and you could assume that your friends had read the same books that you read. So there</p>
<p>was kind of invisible sharing. There was a lot of sharing going on and there was a lot</p>
<p>of assumed common knowledge and, you know, that was built in. I mean, it was obvious</p>
<p>that you had read the New York Times. It was obvious that you had read the reviews. I mean,</p>
<p>so a lot was taken for granted that was shared. And, you know, when there were, when there</p>
<p>were three television channels, it was obvious that you&rsquo;d seen one of them probably the same.</p>
<p>So sharing, sharing always was always there. It was just different.</p>
<p>At the risk of, uh, inviting mockery from you, let me say that I&rsquo;m also a fan of Sartre</p>
<p>and Camus and existentialist philosophers. And, um, I&rsquo;m joking of course about mockery,</p>
<p>but from the perspective of the two selves, what do you think of the existentialist philosophy</p>
<p>of life? So trying to really emphasize the experiencing self as the proper way to, or</p>
<p>the best way to live life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough philosophy to answer that, but it&rsquo;s not, uh, you know, the emphasis on,</p>
<p>on experience is also the emphasis in Buddhism.</p>
<p>Yeah, right. That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So, uh, that&rsquo;s, you just have got to, to experience things and, and, and not to evaluate and not</p>
<p>to pass judgment and not to score, not to keep score. So, uh,</p>
<p>If, when you look at the grand picture of experience, you think there&rsquo;s something to</p>
<p>that, that one, one of the ways to achieve contentment and maybe even happiness is letting</p>
<p>go of any of the things, any of the procedures of the remembering self.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, I think, you know, if one could imagine a life in which people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>score themselves, uh, it, it feels as if that would be a better life as if the self scoring</p>
<p>and you know, how am I doing a kind of question, uh, is not, is not a very happy thing to have.</p>
<p>But I got out of that field because I couldn&rsquo;t solve that problem and, and that was because</p>
<p>my intuition was that the experiencing self, that&rsquo;s reality.</p>
<p>But then it turns out that what people want for themselves is not experiences. They want</p>
<p>memories and they want a good story about their life. And so you cannot have a theory</p>
<p>of happiness that doesn&rsquo;t correspond to what people want for themselves. And when I, when</p>
<p>I realized that this, this was where things were going, I really sort of left the field</p>
<p>of research.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s something instructive about this emphasis of reliving memories in</p>
<p>building AI systems. So currently artificial intelligence systems are more like experiencing</p>
<p>self in that they react to the environment. There&rsquo;s some pattern formation like a learning</p>
<p>so on, but you really don&rsquo;t construct memories, uh, except in reinforcement learning every</p>
<p>once in a while that you replay over and over.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you know, that would in principle would not be.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s useful? Do you think it&rsquo;s a feature or a bug of human beings that we,</p>
<p>that we look back?</p>
<p>Oh, I think that&rsquo;s definitely a feature. That&rsquo;s not a bug. I mean, you, you have to look back</p>
<p>in order to look forward. So, uh, without, without looking back, you couldn&rsquo;t, you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really intelligently look forward.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking for the echoes of the same kind of experience in order to predict what</p>
<p>the future holds.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So though Victor Frankel in his book, man&rsquo;s search for meaning, I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>read, describes his experience at the consecration concentration camps during world war two as</p>
<p>a way to describe that finding identifying a purpose in life, a positive purpose in life</p>
<p>can save one from suffering. First of all, do you connect with the philosophy that he</p>
<p>describes there?</p>
<p>Not really. I mean, the, so I can, I can really see that somebody who has that feeling of</p>
<p>purpose and meaning and so on, that, that could sustain you. Uh, I in general don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have that feeling and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that if I were in a concentration camp, I&rsquo;d give</p>
<p>up and die, you know? So he talks, he is, he is a survivor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, he survived with that. And I&rsquo;m, and I&rsquo;m not sure how essential to survival</p>
<p>this sense is, but I do know when I think about myself that I would have given up. Oh,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. And there is, there is a sort of character that, that, that manages</p>
<p>to survive in conditions like that. And then because they survive, they tell stories and</p>
<p>it sounds as if they survive because of what they were doing. We have no idea. They survived</p>
<p>because the kind of people that they are and the other kind of people who survives and</p>
<p>would tell themselves stories of a particular kind. So I&rsquo;m not, uh,</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think seeking purpose is a significant driver in our being?</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a very interesting question because when you ask people whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important to have meaning in their life, they say, oh yes, that&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>thing. But when you ask people, what kind of a day did you have? And, and you know,</p>
<p>what were the experiences that you remember? You don&rsquo;t get much meaning. You get social</p>
<p>experiences. Then, uh, and, and some people say that, for example, in, in, in child, you</p>
<p>know, in taking care of children, the fact that they are your children and you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>care of them, uh, makes a very big difference. I think that&rsquo;s entirely true. Uh, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more because of a story that we&rsquo;re telling ourselves, which is a very different story</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re taking care of our children or when we&rsquo;re taking care of other things.</p>
<p>Jumping around a little bit in doing a lot of experiments, let me ask a question. Most</p>
<p>of the work I do, for example, is in the, in the real world, but most of the clean good</p>
<p>science that you can do is in the lab. So that distinction, do you think we can understand</p>
<p>the fundamentals of human behavior through controlled experiments in the lab? If we talk</p>
<p>about pupil diameter, for example, it&rsquo;s much easier to do when you can control lighting</p>
<p>conditions, right? So when we look at driving, lighting variation destroys almost completely</p>
<p>your ability to use pupil diameter. But in the lab for, as I mentioned, semi autonomous</p>
<p>or autonomous vehicles in driving simulators, we can&rsquo;t, we don&rsquo;t capture true, honest, uh,</p>
<p>human behavior in that particular domain. So what&rsquo;s your intuition? How much of human</p>
<p>behavior can we study in this controlled environment of the lab? A lot, but you&rsquo;d have to verify</p>
<p>it, you know, that your, your conclusions are basically limited to the situation, to</p>
<p>the experimental situation. Then you have to jump the big inductive leap to the real</p>
<p>world. Uh, so, and, and that&rsquo;s the flare. That&rsquo;s where the difference, I think, between</p>
<p>the good psychologists and others that are mediocre is in the sense of that your experiment</p>
<p>captures something that&rsquo;s important and something that&rsquo;s real and others are just running experiments.</p>
<p>So what is that? Like the birth of an idea to his development in your mind to something</p>
<p>that leads to an experiment. Is that similar to maybe like what Einstein or a good physicist</p>
<p>do is your intuition. You basically use your intuition to build up.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s very skilled intuition. I mean, I just had that</p>
<p>experience actually. I had an idea that turns out to be very good idea a couple of days</p>
<p>ago and, and you, and you have a sense of that building up. So I&rsquo;m working with a collaborator</p>
<p>and he essentially was saying, you know, what, what are you doing? What&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>And I was, I really, I couldn&rsquo;t exactly explain it, but I knew this is going somewhere, but</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ve been around that game for a very long time. And so I can, you, you develop</p>
<p>that anticipation that yes, this, this is worth following up. That&rsquo;s part of the skill.</p>
<p>Is that something you can reduce to words in describing a process in the form of advice</p>
<p>to others?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Follow your heart, essentially.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like trying to explain what it&rsquo;s like to drive. It&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to break it apart and it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And then you lose.</p>
<p>And then you lose the experience.</p>
<p>You mentioned collaboration. You&rsquo;ve written about your collaboration with Amos Tversky</p>
<p>that this is you writing, the 12 or 13 years in which most of our work was joint were years</p>
<p>of interpersonal and intellectual bliss. Everything was interesting. Almost everything</p>
<p>was funny. And there was a current joy of seeing an idea take shape. So many times in</p>
<p>those years, we shared the magical experience of one of us saying something, which the other</p>
<p>one would understand more deeply than the speaker had done. Contrary to the old laws</p>
<p>of information theory, it was common for us to find that more information was received</p>
<p>than had been sent. I have almost never had the experience with anyone else. If you have</p>
<p>not had it, you don&rsquo;t know how marvelous collaboration can be.</p>
<p>So let me ask a perhaps a silly question. How does one find and create such a collaboration?</p>
<p>That may be asking like, how does one find love?</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to be lucky. And I think you have to have the character for that because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had many collaborations. I mean, none were as exciting as with Amos, but I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m having just very. So it&rsquo;s a skill. I think I&rsquo;m good at it. Not everybody is good</p>
<p>at it. And then it&rsquo;s the luck of finding people who are also good at it.</p>
<p>Is there advice in a form for a young scientist who also seeks to violate this law of information</p>
<p>theory?</p>
<p>I really think it&rsquo;s so much luck is involved. And in those really serious collaborations,</p>
<p>at least in my experience, are a very personal experience. And I have to like the person</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working with. Otherwise, I mean, there is that kind of collaboration, which is like</p>
<p>an exchange, a commercial exchange of giving this, you give me that. But the real ones</p>
<p>are interpersonal. They&rsquo;re between people who like each other and who like making each</p>
<p>other think and who like the way that the other person responds to your thoughts. You</p>
<p>have to be lucky.</p>
<p>But I already noticed that even just me showing up here, you&rsquo;ve quickly started to digging</p>
<p>in on a particular problem I&rsquo;m working on and already new information started to emerge.</p>
<p>Is that a process, just the process of curiosity of talking to people about problems and seeing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about anything to do with AI and robotics. And I knew you were dealing with</p>
<p>that. So I was curious.</p>
<p>Just follow your curiosity. Jumping around on the psychology front, the dramatic sounding</p>
<p>terminology of replication crisis, but really just the, at times, this effect that at times</p>
<p>studies do not, are not fully generalizable. They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You are being polite. It&rsquo;s worse than that.</p>
<p>Is it? So I&rsquo;m actually not fully familiar to the degree how bad it is, right? So what</p>
<p>do you think is the source? Where do you think?</p>
<p>I think I know what&rsquo;s going on actually. I mean, I have a theory about what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on is that there is, first of all, a very important distinction between</p>
<p>two types of experiments. And one type is within subject. So it&rsquo;s the same person has</p>
<p>two experimental conditions. And the other type is between subjects where some people</p>
<p>are this condition, other people are that condition. They&rsquo;re different worlds. And between</p>
<p>subject experiments are much harder to predict and much harder to anticipate. And the reason,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re also more expensive because you need more people. And it&rsquo;s just, so between</p>
<p>subject experiments is where the problem is. It&rsquo;s not so much in within subject experiments,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really between. And there is a very good reason why the intuitions of researchers about</p>
<p>between subject experiments are wrong. And that&rsquo;s because when you are a researcher,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a within subject situation. That is you are imagining the two conditions and</p>
<p>you see the causality and you feel it. But in the between subject condition, they live</p>
<p>in one condition and the other one is just nowhere. So our intuitions are very weak about</p>
<p>between subject experiments. And that I think is something that people haven&rsquo;t realized.</p>
<p>And in addition, because of that, we have no idea about the power of manipulations of</p>
<p>experimental manipulations because the same manipulation is much more powerful when you</p>
<p>are in the two conditions than when you live in only one condition. And so the experimenters</p>
<p>have very poor intuitions about between subject experiments. And there is something else which</p>
<p>is very important, I think, which is that almost all psychological hypotheses are true.</p>
<p>That is in the sense that, you know, directionally, if you have a hypothesis that A really causes</p>
<p>B, that it&rsquo;s not true that A causes the opposite of B. Maybe A just has very little effect,</p>
<p>but hypotheses are true mostly, except mostly they&rsquo;re very weak. They&rsquo;re much weaker than</p>
<p>you think when you are having images. So the reason I&rsquo;m excited about that is that I recently</p>
<p>heard about some friends of mine who they essentially funded 53 studies of behavioral</p>
<p>change by 20 different teams of people with a very precise objective of changing the number</p>
<p>of times that people go to the gym. And the success rate was zero. Not one of the 53 studies</p>
<p>worked. Now, what&rsquo;s interesting about that is those are the best people in the field</p>
<p>and they have no idea what&rsquo;s going on. So they&rsquo;re not calibrated. They think that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be powerful because they can imagine it, but actually it&rsquo;s just weak because you</p>
<p>are focusing on your manipulation and it feels powerful to you. There&rsquo;s a thing that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>written about that&rsquo;s called the focusing illusion. That is that when you think about something,</p>
<p>it looks very important, more important than it really is.</p>
<p>More important than it really is. But if you don&rsquo;t see that effect, the 53 studies, doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that mean you just report that? So what was, I guess, the solution to that?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the solution is for people to trust their intuitions less or to try out</p>
<p>their intuitions before. I mean, experiments have to be pre registered and by the time</p>
<p>you run an experiment, you have to be committed to it and you have to run the experiment seriously</p>
<p>enough and in a public. And so this is happening. The interesting thing is what happens before</p>
<p>and how do people prepare themselves and how they run pilot experiments. It&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>train the way psychology is done and it&rsquo;s already happening.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope for, this might connect to the study sample size.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope for the internet?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you know, this is really happening. MTurk, everybody&rsquo;s running experiments on</p>
<p>MTurk and it&rsquo;s very cheap and very effective.</p>
<p>Do you think that changes psychology essentially? Because you&rsquo;re thinking you cannot run 10,000</p>
<p>subjects.</p>
<p>Eventually it will. I mean, I, you know, I can&rsquo;t put my finger on how exactly, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been true in psychology with whenever an important new method came in, it changes</p>
<p>the field. So, and MTurk is really a method because it makes it very much easier to do</p>
<p>something, to do some things.</p>
<p>Is there a undergrad students who&rsquo;ll ask me, you know, how big a neural network should</p>
<p>be for a particular problem? So let me ask you an equivalent question. How big, how many</p>
<p>subjects does the study have for it to have a conclusive result?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on the strength of the effect. So if you&rsquo;re studying visual perception or</p>
<p>the perception of color, many of the classic results in visual, in color perception were</p>
<p>done on three or four people. And I think one of them was colorblind, but partly colorblind,</p>
<p>but on vision, you know, it&rsquo;s highly reliable. Many people don&rsquo;t need a lot of replications</p>
<p>for some type of neurological experiment. When you&rsquo;re studying weaker phenomena and</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re studying them between subjects, then you need a lot more subjects</p>
<p>than people have been running. And that is, that&rsquo;s one of the things that are happening</p>
<p>in psychology now is that the power, the statistical power of experiments is increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>Does the between subject, as the number of subjects goes to infinity approach?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, you know, it goes to infinity is exaggerated, but people, the standard number</p>
<p>of subjects for an experiment in psychology were 30 or 40. And for a weak effect, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>simply not enough. And you may need a couple of hundred. I mean, it&rsquo;s that sort of order</p>
<p>of magnitude.</p>
<p>What are the major disagreements in theories and effects that you&rsquo;ve observed throughout</p>
<p>your career that still stand today? You&rsquo;ve worked on several fields, but what still is</p>
<p>out there as a major disagreement that pops into your mind?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had one extreme experience of, you know, controversy with somebody who really doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like the work that Amos Tversky and I did. And he&rsquo;s been after us for 30 years or more,</p>
<p>at least.</p>
<p>Do you want to talk about it?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, his name is Gerd Gigerenzer. He&rsquo;s a well known German psychologist. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one controversy, which I, it&rsquo;s been unpleasant. And no, I don&rsquo;t particularly</p>
<p>want to talk about it.</p>
<p>But is there is there open questions, even in your own mind, every once in a while? You</p>
<p>know, we talked about semi autonomous vehicles. In my own mind, I see what the data says,</p>
<p>but I also constantly torn. Do you have things where you or your studies have found something,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also intellectually torn about what it means? And there&rsquo;s maybe disagreements</p>
<p>within your own mind about particular things.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, one of the things that are interesting is how difficult it is</p>
<p>for people to change their mind. Essentially, you know, once they are committed, people</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t change their mind about anything that matters. And that is surprisingly, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true about scientists. So the controversy that I described, you know, that&rsquo;s been going</p>
<p>on like 30 years and it&rsquo;s never going to be resolved. And you build a system and you live</p>
<p>within that system and other other systems of ideas look foreign to you and there is</p>
<p>very little contact and very little mutual influence. That happens a fair amount.</p>
<p>Do you have a hopeful advice or message on that? Thinking about science, thinking about</p>
<p>politics, thinking about things that have impact on this world, how can we change our</p>
<p>mind?</p>
<p>I think that, I mean, on things that matter, which are political or really political or</p>
<p>religious and people just don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t change their mind. And by and large, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very little that you can do about it. The, what does happen is that if leaders change</p>
<p>their minds. So for example, the public, the American public doesn&rsquo;t really believe in</p>
<p>climate change, doesn&rsquo;t take it very seriously. But if some religious leaders decided this</p>
<p>is a major threat to humanity, that would have a big effect. So that we have the opinions</p>
<p>that we have, not because we know why we have them, but because we trust some people and</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t trust other people. And so it&rsquo;s much less about evidence than it is about stories.</p>
<p>So the way, one way to change your mind isn&rsquo;t at the individual level, is that the leaders</p>
<p>of the communities you look up with, the stories change and therefore your mind changes with</p>
<p>them. So there&rsquo;s a guy named Alan Turing, came up with a Turing test. What do you think</p>
<p>is a good test of intelligence? Perhaps we&rsquo;re drifting in a topic that we&rsquo;re maybe philosophizing</p>
<p>about, but what do you think is a good test for intelligence, for an artificial intelligence</p>
<p>system?</p>
<p>Well, the standard definition of artificial general intelligence is that it can do anything</p>
<p>that people can do and it can do them better. What we are seeing is that in many domains,</p>
<p>you have domain specific devices or programs or software, and they beat people easily in</p>
<p>a specified way. What we are very far from is that general ability, general purpose intelligence.</p>
<p>In machine learning, people are approaching something more general. I mean, for Alpha</p>
<p>Zero was much more general than Alpha Go, but it&rsquo;s still extraordinarily narrow and</p>
<p>specific in what it can do. So we&rsquo;re quite far from something that can, in every domain,</p>
<p>think like a human except better.</p>
<p>What aspect, so the Turing test has been criticized, it&rsquo;s natural language conversation that is</p>
<p>too simplistic. It&rsquo;s easy to quote unquote pass under constraints specified. What aspect</p>
<p>of conversation would impress you if you heard it? Is it humor? What would impress the heck</p>
<p>out of you if you saw it in conversation?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, certainly wit would be impressive and humor would be more impressive than just</p>
<p>factual conversation, which I think is easy. And allusions would be interesting and metaphors</p>
<p>would be interesting. I mean, but new metaphors, not practiced metaphors. So there is a lot</p>
<p>that would be sort of impressive that is completely natural in conversation, but that you really</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t expect.</p>
<p>Does the possibility of creating a human level intelligence or superhuman level intelligence</p>
<p>system excite you, scare you? How does it make you feel?</p>
<p>I find the whole thing fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p>So exciting.</p>
<p>I think. And exciting. It&rsquo;s also terrifying, you know, but I&rsquo;m not going to be around</p>
<p>to see it. And so I&rsquo;m curious about what is happening now, but I also know that predictions</p>
<p>about it are silly. We really have no idea what it will look like 30 years from now.</p>
<p>No idea.</p>
<p>Speaking of silly, bordering on the profound, let me ask the question of, in your view,</p>
<p>what is the meaning of it all? The meaning of life? He&rsquo;s a descendant of great apes that</p>
<p>we are. Why, what drives us as a civilization, as a human being, as a force behind everything</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve observed and studied? Is there any answer or is it all just a beautiful mess?</p>
<p>There is no answer that I can understand and I&rsquo;m not, and I&rsquo;m not actively looking for</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>Do you think an answer exists?</p>
<p>No. There is no answer that we can understand. I&rsquo;m not qualified to speak about what we cannot</p>
<p>understand, but there is, I know that we cannot understand reality, you know. I mean, there</p>
<p>are a lot of things that we can do. I mean, you know, gravity waves, I mean, that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>big moment for humanity. And when you imagine that ape, you know, being able to go back</p>
<p>to the Big Bang, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, but&hellip;</p>
<p>But the why.</p>
<p>Yeah, the why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bigger than us.</p>
<p>The why is hopeless, really.</p>
<p>Danny, thank you so much. It was an honor. Thank you for speaking today.</p>

<p>Intelligence is not only the ability to reason, it is also the ability to find relevant material</p>
<p>and memory and to deploy attention when needed.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
