    <p>Hi friends, hope you&rsquo;re doing great. I&rsquo;m not really I am. I&rsquo;m just y&rsquo;all this episode is about to be</p>
<p>Unpacking all the trials and tribulations of me trying to fucking move. All right</p>
<p>This has not been a smooth experience by any means and it&rsquo;s just like the littlest things keep happening and keep</p>
<p>Fucking up. Okay, but I&rsquo;m determined and I&rsquo;m a very stubborn motherfucker</p>
<p>And when I say I&rsquo;m gonna do something do it</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve had a lot of like realizations as usual about just random little shit here and there that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna kind of vent to you guys</p>
<p>in this episode about</p>
<p>Just some things that have been happening and just been pissed at me off and then some of the things that I&rsquo;ve realized</p>
<p>Each time something&rsquo;s happened like it&rsquo;s enough, you know, like enough</p>
<p>I get it. Like I get your point universe trying to teach me patience, but I ain&rsquo;t the one okay</p>
<p>Not the one to try and teach patience to because I&rsquo;m very much frustrating</p>
<p>No right now after all of this like I&rsquo;m okay. So like right now where I stand I&rsquo;m alright</p>
<p>But I am a little stressed because in three days I moved to Houston</p>
<p>I have to pack up all my shit in three days and move</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m recording this on Friday and this podcast will come out on Sunday, but on Monday I moved</p>
<p>So when you guys are listening to this, I&rsquo;m probably already in Houston. So hi. Hi from Texas</p>
<p>But let me walk you through</p>
<p>Everything that&rsquo;s happened in this whole experience with trying to uproot my life and throw it away and run away</p>
<p>Because I want people to know when you try to do something and you face challenges. Nothing&rsquo;s gone wrong</p>
<p>Okay, shit&rsquo;s difficult. Sometimes sometimes there just be a lot of bumps in the road</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sharing all my experience with this and I want to document it one so I can look back and laugh in a few</p>
<p>Years and two so that anybody else that&rsquo;s listening to this</p>
<p>Understands that it&rsquo;s not always perfect and everything doesn&rsquo;t just go swimmingly like y&rsquo;all when I tell you the amount of ironic shit</p>
<p>That has happened to me. You&rsquo;re gonna piss yourself like oh my god</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just my life though. Like the amount of ironic things that happen to me is on a different level. So</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with picking an apartment. So</p>
<p>Last week I went to Houston and looked at apartments</p>
<p>I have my cousins up there that I&rsquo;ve gone to see since I&rsquo;m like 18. Like we&rsquo;re very close</p>
<p>We just like I always just go back and forth and see them</p>
<p>But I went to stay with them so I could go look at apartments for a couple days</p>
<p>So I was in Houston for six days. I drove there looked at apartments looked at seven and then drove home</p>
<p>But before I left to go I looked up apartments and I had a list of seven different apartments</p>
<p>I made appointments to go tour them all like I went with my shit together. Like I put as much</p>
<p>Structure on it as possible so that I could go as smoothly as possible and going to tour the apartments went great</p>
<p>But there was some problems with like pricing and shit because when I would see certain things online</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;d get there it wouldn&rsquo;t be that cute and then to go to like a nicer apartment in the same complex was like a</p>
<p>Giant price jump so I would look at somewhere that rent was like thirteen fourteen hundred bucks and then</p>
<p>The apartment was like booty as fuck and then one step up for like 30 more square feet was like</p>
<p>$600 difference and I was like what the fuck are y&rsquo;all on like what&rsquo;s up your nose cuz you&rsquo;re snorting something bitch what?</p>
<p>Anyway, finding apartments in my price range that weren&rsquo;t like booty as fuck was a little bit of a hassle</p>
<p>But I did my fucking research</p>
<p>I looked that shit up for a few hours and</p>
<p>I spent like two days looking up apartments and then got my ass in the car and went to go look at them</p>
<p>Looking at the apartments the first one that I saw I</p>
<p>Was like, okay. This one is cute. I like it a lot</p>
<p>So I was like, okay after seeing this first apartment if I go see other ones</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m either gonna hate this apartment because I see better or I&rsquo;m gonna love this apartment even more</p>
<p>Because everything else I see is gonna be worse and the second part is what happened</p>
<p>So I went on</p>
<p>Wednesday and Thursday to tour apartments and the first one was great cute loved her and then as I went to tour the other ones</p>
<p>They were making me love the first one ten times more because I was like bro</p>
<p>What the fuck is going on with the pricing one location two, but everything about that first apartment</p>
<p>I saw was fucking perfect the location the size the windows in it</p>
<p>It was on a second floor like the parking was good bitch</p>
<p>Everything about it was fucking perfect and I started getting anxious because I had like seven apartments to go see</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m spending these two days going and seeing apartments and the more</p>
<p>Apartments I see the more anxious I get because I&rsquo;m like, oh my god</p>
<p>No, and now I know I&rsquo;m fully dead set on</p>
<p>The first one and I still had like three apartments left to see and I was like no</p>
<p>But I know I want the first one now like now that I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of other options like fuck this shit</p>
<p>Like the first one&rsquo;s what I want and I was so scared like if I waste time going to see these other apartments</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s gonna snatch up the first one. So going to the other appointments</p>
<p>I was like a fucking wreck and I was like, like I know what I want. I know what I want</p>
<p>I just need to go get it</p>
<p>but I made myself see the rest of the apartments and then</p>
<p>After I finished my final tour</p>
<p>I called back the first place that I went to and I was trying to get a hold of them so I could be like</p>
<p>Hey, I want to fucking</p>
<p>Schedule one more tour to see the apartment and then I want to sign the lease now like I want to apply</p>
<p>Now and get that shit signed like I want that apartment</p>
<p>No one was answering the phone and I was like shit because it was like four o&rsquo;clock almost</p>
<p>And I knew they closed at like five and I was like fuck this shit. I&rsquo;m showing up. So I drove my I</p>
<p>Drove my ass right back to the first apartment and the same lady that showed it to me. Her name was Amanda</p>
<p>She was the best fucking she&rsquo;s my favorite human being. I think I&rsquo;ve met so far</p>
<p>Like bitch was so fun and she was so professional and she was so prepared</p>
<p>So I show back up and luckily she&rsquo;s not doing anything when I show back up. So I was like, babe</p>
<p>I want to see that apartment one more time because I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m dead set on it</p>
<p>And I want to put the application in today</p>
<p>So we get up we go to the apartment. We see it one more time and bitch. I</p>
<p>Was home I was like this is fucking it this is the one and</p>
<p>I started like getting so excited like this is a hundred percent after seeing all the other places</p>
<p>There were some that were nicer, but the price was just not something. I was comfortable taking on right now</p>
<p>Like I could have afforded it, but I would have put like an unnecessary stress on myself</p>
<p>So fucking baby steps, right?</p>
<p>You know like if in a year I want to get a better place and I&rsquo;m making a lot more money more consistently great</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get it. But for now, I wanted some cheap shit. Like I want to slum it for a bit</p>
<p>You know, like I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m gonna do financially. I don&rsquo;t have anything really like set out</p>
<p>perfectly and</p>
<p>Consistently yet, so I have to take a leap of faith, but I ain&rsquo;t taking a fat-ass leap. All right</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking an affordable leap</p>
<p>And if you catch me and ramen shut the fuck up</p>
<p>All right, if you catch me on tick-tock with some ramen with protein powder shut up. Leave me alone</p>
<p>But yeah, I go in we see this apartment one last time and I was like this is fucking it and I was like bitch</p>
<p>This is sold</p>
<p>But the main reason it was sold is because between tenants they just put in all brand new carpet</p>
<p>And I was like, okay great because we saw a couple other apartments and like the carpet made it look dingy as fuck</p>
<p>But the fact that this carpet was brand new I was like, I have no complaints and there&rsquo;s a full</p>
<p>Double sliding door closet and the doors are all mirrored like top to bottom</p>
<p>Full length mirrored in my bedroom right across from where my beds gonna be</p>
<p>So, you know what that fucking means a mirror right up next to the bed, please</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite fucking shit in the world because I want to look at me when I&rsquo;m doing you know, what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck what you look like I can see you. I want to see me</p>
<p>I want to watch me make sure I look okay</p>
<p>Make sure I look good when I&rsquo;m doing what I&rsquo;m doing, but also the closet is fucking huge. So</p>
<p>And also I have a little balcony like oh my god</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m so fucking excited about this apartment, but I need to slow down and just take you through this story. So I</p>
<p>put in my application and</p>
<p>It was on Thursday</p>
<p>So I literally drove back to my cousin&rsquo;s house got on my computer submitted the application within like 20 minutes</p>
<p>Put in all my information and I was like, okay, I&rsquo;m set</p>
<p>So I was supposed to hear back within like 48 hours</p>
<p>So I was I&rsquo;m waiting for the application to go in</p>
<p>I just was really fucking stressed out and I had this weird like sense of doom like I was super sad</p>
<p>Like what if I don&rsquo;t get this fucking apartment bro? Like what am I gonna do?</p>
<p>So I sat down and I prepared like what am I gonna fucking do if I don&rsquo;t get the apartment?</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;ll look for more places. I&rsquo;ll go to more places. I&rsquo;ll figure it out</p>
<p>Like I trust myself to figure it out</p>
<p>But I was just so sad. Like what if I don&rsquo;t get this apartment?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this is the one and</p>
<p>As soon as I heard myself say this apartment is the one that was my red flag to myself</p>
<p>I was convincing myself. This apartment was the one this is it. This is the one apartment</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s perfect for me</p>
<p>And by telling myself and throwing the label of this is the one onto it</p>
<p>Made me ten times more attached to it and made me ten times more</p>
<p>Emotional about the waiting period and the anxiety and the stress of what if I don&rsquo;t get it, what if I don&rsquo;t get approved?</p>
<p>What if somebody else applies and gets approved or whatever? Like I was just so scared</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t gonna get this apartment and I was telling myself because this is the one and that made it ten times worse</p>
<p>So I had to get very clear with myself and I literally wrote it down in my notebook. I was like</p>
<p>Instead of saying this apartment is the one what is this apartment?</p>
<p>This is the apartment that matches all of my criteria and all of the things that I wanted</p>
<p>So that does not mean it&rsquo;s the only apartment that will match the standards and like the requirements that I had and what I preferred</p>
<p>This is just the one that I&rsquo;ve found so far</p>
<p>There could be other apartments that also fit my criteria</p>
<p>So I am NOT allowed to say this is the one and as soon as I took that label off of the apartment of</p>
<p>Saying this is the one I felt so much more relieved</p>
<p>because I still wanted that fucking apartment you best believe I was so stressed out, but it took away that like</p>
<p>Panic and that like if this doesn&rsquo;t come through like if I don&rsquo;t get this one that I&rsquo;m fucked</p>
<p>But I knew I&rsquo;d find somewhere else. I just wasn&rsquo;t gonna be as happy</p>
<p>I was telling myself because I was like this is the one but you know what?</p>
<p>I mean like taking that label off of saying this is the one</p>
<p>Made it a lot easier to go through the waiting period now</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Friday comes and I got online cuz I&rsquo;m just anxious</p>
<p>So I go and look at the apartment and the floor plan I selected in the apartment</p>
<p>I selected was not there. So I was like, oh my god</p>
<p>So like I got it like they reserved it for me like yay, you know, like I was so excited like oh, it&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>So like that means I got it. Hmm. I wish it was that easy</p>
<p>so bitch</p>
<p>Saturday comes and it&rsquo;s two days later and I&rsquo;m like, okay</p>
<p>I really hope that they&rsquo;re working on weekends because I&rsquo;m stressed as fuck</p>
<p>All right, like I&rsquo;m real fucking stressed and I was supposed to leave Houston on Monday. So I needed a fucking answer and</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re working on Saturday, but they&rsquo;re not working on Sunday. So she calls me and it&rsquo;s like hey Leo</p>
<p>What the fuck did you do with your application you put zero for your income?</p>
<p>And I was like, huh?</p>
<p>Like something must like I must have typed something in wrong or it just didn&rsquo;t register or whatever</p>
<p>But I definitely put my income in because I submitted my bank statements for the last six months to like prove it all matched up</p>
<p>and she was like, yeah, I have that but your application got flagged as like getting rejected because</p>
<p>You put your income as zero or it registered in the system as zero and she&rsquo;s like, okay</p>
<p>How much do you make I like monthly and I told her and then she she&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ll put it in for you</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re gonna have to rerun the application. So it&rsquo;ll take like three more days and I was like, okay, so</p>
<p>Great my fucking anxieties to the goddamn roof</p>
<p>I got to wait three more fucking days to find out if I&rsquo;m approved or not cool</p>
<p>So that means I&rsquo;m not gonna get an answer before I leave Houston. So Saturday they got to resubmit it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna hear until Tuesday Wednesday because they don&rsquo;t work on Sunday. I call Monday just to get an estimate</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, hey, is there anything is there any update? Is there any like news bitch isn&rsquo;t working?</p>
<p>So I had to talk to somebody else</p>
<p>Tuesday comes I call again. Hey, is there any update just checking in? Do you need any more information for me?</p>
<p>Is everything going good? What&rsquo;s the fucking stitch bitch? So she tells me everything is checked out on Tuesday</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like everything&rsquo;s checked out. You&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>The only thing that&rsquo;s still processing is your background check and the company that we use for it</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re closed because it was like whatever time in the day and she was like, I&rsquo;ll call tomorrow and figure out</p>
<p>Okay, so Wednesday comes</p>
<p>Okay, my move-in date is Monday literally I got like five fucking days, but I don&rsquo;t even have a set</p>
<p>Answer if I&rsquo;m moving in or not</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;m half-ass like packing my shit like I&rsquo;m just kind of sorting through I&rsquo;m not really packing at this point</p>
<p>But this was two days ago as I&rsquo;m recording this podcast</p>
<p>But Wednesday I call her again and I&rsquo;m like, hey any update? What&rsquo;s the what&rsquo;s the fucking deal?</p>
<p>What the motherfuck is taking so long?</p>
<p>She basically tells me</p>
<p>Everything checked out. Everything&rsquo;s approved. My background check is here and it&rsquo;s ready, but their system is</p>
<p>Down and they can&rsquo;t log in</p>
<p>To get into whatever they need to get into to send me an email of the lease so I can sign it</p>
<p>So they said it will most likely be tomorrow, which is Thursday</p>
<p>So she was like Thursday will most likely have you at least but it might be Friday</p>
<p>And I was like Amanda. I&rsquo;m literally about to have move halfway across the country in like three days</p>
<p>How do I not have a set answer yet? Like what am I supposed to do? And she was like Leo?</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re fine. She&rsquo;s like you got the apartment. You&rsquo;ve got a place</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry because as soon as our system comes up, we&rsquo;re sending you the lease but plan on moving in Monday</p>
<p>So I was like, okay, but my anxiety don&rsquo;t let me just have that like I&rsquo;m stressed the fuck out until it&rsquo;s finalized</p>
<p>So here we go, it&rsquo;s Thursday</p>
<p>But when I went to the apartment and toward it</p>
<p>She asked me if I had any pets and I said no</p>
<p>because my dad was like fighting with me about leaving cat here and I was like I</p>
<p>Want to take my child and he was like no leave her here. This is her home. Like she goes outside</p>
<p>She has a little screen door for like a cat and she gets to go play out by the pool and play in the grass</p>
<p>Like she&rsquo;s got a big life here in a big house</p>
<p>And this is where like she&rsquo;s known for the last eight years, you know</p>
<p>So my dad basically convinced me to like keep her here</p>
<p>So I was like, I&rsquo;m gonna leave her here, but then I&rsquo;d been thinking about it and on Thursday</p>
<p>I had already decided like I&rsquo;m gonna take cat with me like fuck this shit</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t want to just leave her behind like I get this life is like prettier and she&rsquo;s got more space and she can</p>
<p>Go outside, but I&rsquo;m her person and I&rsquo;ve been left behind by someone and I would have rather gone with them</p>
<p>Than just be left behind just because I cared about them so much. So I learned from my own experience</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna do that to cat like I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d rather just be with me. So I decided I want to take her</p>
<p>Amanda finally sends me the lease on</p>
<p>Thursday and I call her and I was like, babe, I hate to do it to you, but I need to add a cat</p>
<p>I need to add a pet. So do we have to do a whole new lease or what and she was like, yeah</p>
<p>Okay, so she was like email me the information about the cat breed weight all this and that and she goes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna send you a new lease and then sign that one and I said, okay great</p>
<p>I was at the gym when I got the lease so I had to wait till I got home</p>
<p>I sent her the information and then two hours later. I get a new lease and I I&rsquo;m so excited</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is it. I finally have the motherfucking lease bro</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s here like once I sign this document, I&rsquo;m literally moving in three fucking days four days, whatever it was</p>
<p>So this is Thursday</p>
<p>so I click the link for the lease and it says you need to sign in I go to sign in and</p>
<p>correct password and I was like, huh bitch like what so I</p>
<p>Click forgot password and so I&rsquo;m like, okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just reset my password and it tells me that no account is registered with my email</p>
<p>But I signed up for the account when I put in the application online</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, hang on so something in the system like fucked up</p>
<p>So I was like, okay, my password is wrong, but it&rsquo;s also saying that I don&rsquo;t have an account associated with this email</p>
<p>So whatever I was like fuck it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just resign up and maybe my information will match because I had to select the apartment complex that I was signing the lease</p>
<p>With so I was like, maybe it&rsquo;ll just pop up who fucking knows</p>
<p>I go to register for a new account and now it says your email is already in use</p>
<p>Bitch pick one. This is why I can&rsquo;t stand technology like fucking stupid</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m stuck back at the fucking login page. It&rsquo;s like I have to log in so I&rsquo;m like fuck</p>
<p>So I start guessing my passwords. I lock myself out of my account</p>
<p>Like it locks me out for 30 minutes. So I&rsquo;m like, okay, so after 30 minutes</p>
<p>I have to click the link and try again</p>
<p>So after 30 minutes, I click the link and I try again and then I keep fucking up the password and it locked my account</p>
<p>Permanently and I was like, oh my fucking god</p>
<p>So I go looking for a phone number to call this website and be like yo give my fucking goddamn login like I forgot</p>
<p>Really? I didn&rsquo;t forget like I typed in the password. I knew what the password was</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t working and there&rsquo;s no contact number for this website. So I can&rsquo;t call anybody</p>
<p>So I google it can&rsquo;t find a number to call this website</p>
<p>I have to send an email and their response time is 24 fucking hours, bro</p>
<p>Their response time is</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>hours</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m sitting here with the lease that I know that I need to sign and I have to wait 24 hours</p>
<p>So that I can get someone to help me get back into my account so that I can sign the lease</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna have signed the fucker till Friday, but I&rsquo;m the type person</p>
<p>I need that guarantee before I start packing like I have a lot of shit to do</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of coaching calls</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have like a lot of free time to just all of a sudden pack my shit in two days</p>
<p>Like I need to start like now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like sitting there like bugging out like bro. I&rsquo;m not waiting another day</p>
<p>So I go back onto the website and I was like fuck this goddamn shit. I&rsquo;m getting back in my account</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna figure it out and</p>
<p>Somehow I figured it out and I don&rsquo;t even remember how I did it</p>
<p>But somehow I got into the account and I signed the fucking lease</p>
<p>Let me not make it sound that smooth</p>
<p>I read the entire fucking lease the 37 pages because I always read before I sign my name to shit</p>
<p>You got to watch out</p>
<p>So I read the whole thing. So I mean like 30 minutes 45 minutes and then I signed the lease and now it&rsquo;s solid</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s confirmed. I got the motherfucking place. I wanted it was the perfect fucking spot</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m like, holy shit. Like I got it. Like I finally got it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s secure and now I have four days to go pack all my shit. So immediately I go run in to go start packing</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re gonna get off the topic of the fucking apartment and we&rsquo;re gonna go to other shit</p>
<p>That was going wrong. So my car</p>
<p>My dad walks out and looks at my car and was like, you know, dude, you need four new tires</p>
<p>And I was like, huh? Like, what do you mean? I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m just saying like I&rsquo;m a okay</p>
<p>What do you fucking mean? I need four new tires the car drives</p>
<p>There was no tread on the fucking tires barely, but he was like, yeah, you need four new tires</p>
<p>And I was like god damn it like of course</p>
<p>This is the time like when I&rsquo;m over here bugging about having to pay rent and I have to go furnish this whole apartment because</p>
<p>I have literally no furniture. I</p>
<p>Was like, I don&rsquo;t need to go be spending $1,200 on new fucking tires. Okay. I just got real frustrated</p>
<p>I was like right now like for real like right now this has to happen like right now</p>
<p>I need new tires like for real bitch like after all this headache</p>
<p>I just went through with this goddamn fucking apartment in this week of stress and havoc. Oh</p>
<p>But literally these fucking tires I&rsquo;m like bro, I was like god damn it I was like, alright dad order them</p>
<p>Will you put them on for me? I&rsquo;ll pay for them</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about it</p>
<p>but like fuck like it just like</p>
<p>Stressed me out and I was like why now like fuck and he was like, yeah, like Leo</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not kidding</p>
<p>You really need new tires before you go out of town</p>
<p>Especially since you&rsquo;re leaving like I want to put them on and make sure they&rsquo;re on right make sure you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>I want to make sure you get the good ones and I was like, hang on</p>
<p>I was like, I don&rsquo;t want no best of the best shit</p>
<p>Okay, like I want the fucking factory ones that are sufficient and will do okay</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want the fucking like fancy smancy ones and he was like, all right, shut up. I&rsquo;ll handle it</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>So he orders me new tires takes my car puts it in the shop puts the tires off for me</p>
<p>I was like, thank you so much how much and he was like, don&rsquo;t worry about it and</p>
<p>Like my little heart bitch was like, oh my god</p>
<p>And he goes I put on the expensive ones so I&rsquo;ll pay for it</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m not gonna give you like the normal stock shit</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like I want to make sure you&rsquo;re okay, and you&rsquo;re good to go out of town</p>
<p>So let me do this for you. And I was like, oh my</p>
<p>That was so fucking sweet, bro. But like I&rsquo;m not gonna say no</p>
<p>Like it just made me very happy that</p>
<p>He put the tires on for me because he saw that it stressed me the fuck out because like 1300 bucks bitch</p>
<p>That was not fun for me. That was really stressing me out cuz like girl. I need a couch. I need a desk</p>
<p>I need chairs. I need a bed. I need food. I</p>
<p>Did not want to go be putting tires on my fucking car</p>
<p>But yeah</p>
<p>He really helped me and he saved my fucking life because he got me in quick</p>
<p>Fix the car did the tires and now he gets peace of mind</p>
<p>But I get peace of mind knowing that the best fucking car guy</p>
<p>I know put them on for me and they&rsquo;re secure and they&rsquo;re good and they&rsquo;re the nice ones, you know</p>
<p>So, yeah</p>
<p>That made me really happy</p>
<p>But my whole point of bringing that up was like a fucking bump in the road of like now you need new tires like bitch damn</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna talk about another bump in the fucking road</p>
<p>This one this fucking cunt at this fucking store. Oh my god</p>
<p>So when I was in Houston, I&rsquo;m like, yo</p>
<p>I need a couch and I don&rsquo;t know how I want to decorate like I&rsquo;m very specific</p>
<p>With the things that I buy like I have to love it before I buy it</p>
<p>I will not just go to the store and just buy shit</p>
<p>Everything has to be picked out perfectly and by me and like I have to love it or I&rsquo;m not buying it like I won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Have a couch until I find the couch that I want</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if I&rsquo;m two months sitting on the fucking floor</p>
<p>Like I really won&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll buy like some fold-out chairs and look real ratchet</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not just gonna buy shit to just have shit</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m with my cousin shy and I&rsquo;m like, yo, let&rsquo;s go like look around for some furniture so I can get some ideas of</p>
<p>What I want to buy, you know, like what style I want what things I want what things I&rsquo;m gonna need and</p>
<p>So we were at Katie Mills and there&rsquo;s a restoration hardware outlet store there</p>
<p>And I was like, oh my god, they have a bunch of modern shit</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way too fucking expensive for me right now</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just go in and look</p>
<p>So I can get an idea of like what I might like and I&rsquo;ll order some shit off Wayfair or whatever</p>
<p>So we go in restoration hardware and we&rsquo;re looking around at the couches and they&rsquo;re air quote on sale</p>
<p>$15,000</p>
<p>$10,000 like bitch this store. I</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t this fucking store like they&rsquo;re off some shit and I want a leather couch</p>
<p>Like I want a slouchy leather couch that&rsquo;s structured. I know it does not make sense and it&rsquo;s very contradictory</p>
<p>But I want a leather couch</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a fucking question. We&rsquo;re playing on all the cloud couches and then there&rsquo;s this one couch</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a leather cloud couch and it&rsquo;s this ugliest tan gray color</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it</p>
<p>But when I sat on it, I just wanted to sit there and have a cigarette like it was just so 90s</p>
<p>It was so fucking cute and it was like fucked up like it looked there was like scratches on it and that style</p>
<p>I love like I loved that</p>
<p>It was like dirty looking and like scratched and fucked up looking because it was like a nice ass couch</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a fucking vibe to have like a fucked up looking like nice ass couch, you know</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not gonna pay fifteen thousand dollars for it. So we look at the price tag and it was like fourteen thousand nine</p>
<p>Ninety nine ninety five whatever it was like fourteen grand for this fucked up ass couch, but under it it said on sale</p>
<p>$700 and</p>
<p>My cousin shy saw it as she was like Leo chef at what the fuck like look it&rsquo;s seven hundred bucks</p>
<p>And I said no goddamn way in hell</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s seven hundred dollars because it was a three couch like a three seat sofa</p>
<p>And then it had the big Ottoman thing where like you slide it up and it was like it was a big-ass couch y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>So I was like what?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not no way that this couch is seven hundred fucking dollars</p>
<p>So I called a lady over like the manager and I was like, hey, I was like, hey, babe</p>
<p>Why the fuck is this couch only seven hundred dollars?</p>
<p>And she goes the pillows on it</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t get them to stand up and it&rsquo;s like a slouchy couch and it&rsquo;s got like markings all over it and we&rsquo;re just trying</p>
<p>To get rid of it because it doesn&rsquo;t look cute in the showroom</p>
<p>And I was like, does it come with the Ottoman and she said yeah, so it&rsquo;s seven hundred dollars for this full-ass</p>
<p>restoration hardware leather cloud couch and I about shit in the floor I</p>
<p>Was like no fucking way and I sat on it and I just laid on it and I was like what the fuck bro</p>
<p>This is like this couch is like perfect. It&rsquo;s so my vibe and it&rsquo;s so funny that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a restoration hardware cloud couch. And if you know what that is, you know why I&rsquo;m saying it so much</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cloud couch for $700. That&rsquo;s what made me want it</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>Contradiction and it&rsquo;s such a fuck you like but also the fact that it was dirty and fucked up looking</p>
<p>Was the that&rsquo;s the gag like I would have a $15,000 couch</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like raggedy and fucked up and I love that</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t raggedy at all</p>
<p>but I just like that it looked like grungy a little and I was like</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the gag is to have something super super expensive and super nice and super sought-after</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like fucked up. Like that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s my fucking vibe. I was like, oh my god. This is so cool</p>
<p>So I start nitpicking this couch. I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m about to find out why this bitch is</p>
<p>$700 so I&rsquo;m like there&rsquo;s a hole in it somewhere. So the stitches fucked up something&rsquo;s wrong with it</p>
<p>So I go flipping this couch around sliding it around moving it around lifting it up so I can look at all the corners and everything</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no holes. There&rsquo;s no nothing wrong with it. And I was like, no way no way this just fucking happened</p>
<p>But the woman said it had been in the store for a while. So I was like, okay, I&rsquo;ll think about it</p>
<p>And once I get approved for my apartment because I figured it would take two days</p>
<p>I was like once I get approved for my apartment and I know I have a place to stay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come back and buy it. So we go back to the house</p>
<p>I leave I didn&rsquo;t buy the couch and I&rsquo;m just thinking about it. Like I&rsquo;m like, bro, like literally that couch</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking back at my phone at the pictures of it. I&rsquo;m like yo that couch is like the one</p>
<p>Like that is fucking it bro. Like that&rsquo;s my couch, you know</p>
<p>So I like the more I&rsquo;m thinking about it and the more I&rsquo;m looking at the pictures the more I&rsquo;m liking it and the more</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting anxious of like, oh my god, someone&rsquo;s gonna fucking go buy it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like trying to chill and I&rsquo;m trying to be like no Leo. You&rsquo;re fine</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know if you have the apartment yet. You don&rsquo;t need to buy a couch, but I was like no Leo</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna move so you need a fucking couch. So go buy it</p>
<p>So I was like fuck I was like, alright, so I get in the car and I&rsquo;m like fucking I&rsquo;m just gonna go back to</p>
<p>The store. I&rsquo;m gonna go buy this fucking couch</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just go pay for it and buy it</p>
<p>So I have peace of mind that it&rsquo;s mine and I get in the car and before I pull out of the driveway</p>
<p>I was like, let me call them and ask like if I can have it delivered in a week when I move into my apartment</p>
<p>You know cuz I was like, I can&rsquo;t just buy it if I have nowhere to take it</p>
<p>So I call and I was like, hey</p>
<p>What is your delivery service and they have it set up where you have to hire like a separate delivery service?</p>
<p>But I was like, okay if I come by the couch now</p>
<p>How long do I have before I have to come pick it up? And she said two days and I was like fuck</p>
<p>So I was like, okay, my cousins have an extra bedroom kind of in their house that they use for storage</p>
<p>So I was like if I go buy it I could put it in that room</p>
<p>But I was like I need to talk to my cousin&rsquo;s dad because it&rsquo;s his house</p>
<p>I was like</p>
<p>I need to ask him first</p>
<p>Before I go buy this couch if I can like buy it</p>
<p>Move it into that extra room for a week and then when I move into my apartment</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hire movers to come move it out of there. So I was like, okay, I&rsquo;m not gonna go buy the couch right now</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sitting there like it&rsquo;s gonna be fine it&rsquo;s been in the store for a long time. I&rsquo;m just gonna fucking wait it out</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go tonight. I&rsquo;m gonna talk to my cousin&rsquo;s dad and then tomorrow I&rsquo;ll go buy the couch</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go with my cousin Adrian because he has a truck. I was like, we&rsquo;ll get the couch</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll bring it back here and we&rsquo;ll put it in the room. So I was like tomorrow. It&rsquo;s fucking mine</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>But I need to ask to be like considerate and polite to ask if I can fucking store in this house, you know</p>
<p>So the store closes at 7 so at 650 I</p>
<p>Call just to make sure they had it in stock because I&rsquo;m very anxious you guys I can&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>So I call and I&rsquo;m like, hey, I came in earlier and looked at a certain couch</p>
<p>I read the name of it because I have the picture of a tag and I was like, hey is the couch still there?</p>
<p>And the woman said</p>
<p>Actually, someone has a hold on it</p>
<p>The holds end at the end of the day if the person does not come to pick it up</p>
<p>So at the end of the day today like in 10 minutes when we close if the person hasn&rsquo;t come to get it</p>
<p>Then the hold comes off and you can come get the couch tomorrow morning if you want it and I was like, oh</p>
<p>Fuck no, like that&rsquo;s my biggest fear was like someone buying this couch off from under me. So I was like fuck this shit</p>
<p>I was like tomorrow morning. I&rsquo;m gonna have my ass at this motherfucking store, but it was Friday</p>
<p>So we went out and I was like, I don&rsquo;t give a fuck how hungover I am</p>
<p>Saturday at 10 a.m. When this store opens, I&rsquo;m gonna have my ass there beating on the window</p>
<p>Let me the motherfuck and get my goddamn couch. I talked to my cousin&rsquo;s dad. He said he&rsquo;s cool with it</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, oh my god, perfect. So me and my cousin Adrian. I&rsquo;m like yo, bro tomorrow</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having our ass at that store at 950 in the morning because they open at 10. I</p>
<p>Have a place to store the couch. Everything&rsquo;s all good. I can leave it at the house</p>
<p>I go to the store and I was so worried that someone had bought it out from under me and I was like no</p>
<p>Leo you&rsquo;re the first one here. I was like go get the fucking couch. I walk in I see the couch</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh my fucking god. No one fucking bought my couch. So I walk up to it. I sit on it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like finger fucking it for like the final time. Like oh my god. This is it. Yay. And so I</p>
<p>Look at the price tag and</p>
<p>it says</p>
<p>$9,000 and</p>
<p>I was like, oh wait, huh? I&rsquo;m sorry. What?</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>I flipped the tag over to make sure it was like the right tag and it was like</p>
<p>$14,000 on sale for 9,000 and I was like</p>
<p>No, so I pull out my phone because I took a picture of the previous tag. They switched the fucking price</p>
<p>So instead of being $700 this fucker is now nine grand and I was like, no like this is not happening</p>
<p>I was like no</p>
<p>Surely the woman that was there that I talked to a day before the manager I saw her and I was like, okay</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll remember me. She&rsquo;ll be able to knock the price stack back down or whatever. It is like fine</p>
<p>So I go up to her and I have to wait on her cuz on the fucking phone</p>
<p>And I finally she comes over and she&rsquo;s like hey, and I was like, hey girly pop</p>
<p>So what the fuck&rsquo;s the deal with this price increase you got and she was like, oh corporate called us yesterday</p>
<p>And they saw in our system</p>
<p>we had a cloud couch markdown for so low and they required that we increase the price and</p>
<p>I was like, okay</p>
<p>So can you still give me the price from yesterday because I saw it yesterday or what like come on?</p>
<p>I was like between me and you and she was like, no, I&rsquo;m sorry. I can&rsquo;t and</p>
<p>I looked at this bitch dead in her face for a minute and I was like, huh?</p>
<p>Like this is this bitch release. Are these the words really coming out of this fucking bitch&rsquo;s mouth like what so I said</p>
<p>Corporate called you and</p>
<p>Told you to increase the price and she said yes, and I said so yesterday</p>
<p>Had I swiped my card and purchased this couch? I could have got it for $700</p>
<p>But the fact that I am here today it is now</p>
<p>$9,000 and she said yes, and</p>
<p>When I tell you I stared in this woman&rsquo;s face for a solid two fucking minutes</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say a word. We just stood there and</p>
<p>Stared at each other like I looked at her like she was the dumbest fucking bitch in the world</p>
<p>Because she is hurt my feelings with this like literally what?</p>
<p>The fuck is that?</p>
<p>Fuck restoration hardware outlet at Katie Mills eat my dick. I hope your store burns down. Fuck you</p>
<p>I hope that couch burns and everything you love. Fuck you. Like I know I&rsquo;m being dramatic but like</p>
<p>Yo, I was so worried that someone was gonna buy the couch off from under me</p>
<p>Not that this bitch was gonna snake me because I guarantee you</p>
<p>Corporate didn&rsquo;t call a fucking thing bitch. Like I was interested in the couch yesterday. Then someone put a hold on it</p>
<p>So now they&rsquo;re like, oh there&rsquo;s demand for this couch so we can put the price back up and get more for it</p>
<p>I guarantee you that&rsquo;s what fucking happened cuz corporate don&rsquo;t give a fuck about restoration hardware outlet and Katie Mills little piece of shit</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t get the couch</p>
<p>I literally just turned around and walked out of a store like fuck you bitch</p>
<p>But the way that she was so stone-cold</p>
<p>Unapologetic. Yeah. Yeah, that&rsquo;s the way it is. Like fuck you you a sleep ass cunt</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for the day you wake up and I&rsquo;m excited for the day that you meet a bitch just like you. Oh</p>
<p>My god like that situation y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>But I told myself it&rsquo;s okay I was like, it&rsquo;s okay Leo you&rsquo;ll go find the new couch you can go online</p>
<p>You can look up all the new shit and bro. I&rsquo;ve spent so many hours</p>
<p>Looking for a similar couch and I cannot find one for under three to four thousand dollars</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so fucked up over it mentally that situation has my fucking underwear and I&rsquo;m not like I&rsquo;m twisted like</p>
<p>Ooh, I&rsquo;m still mad about it. Like I&rsquo;m still huffing and puffing about this like I&rsquo;m blowing a little piggies house down</p>
<p>So yeah, that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at right now. I don&rsquo;t have a couch. I don&rsquo;t have any furniture</p>
<p>That was the only thing that I found where I&rsquo;m like, yes, I want it. I love it</p>
<p>And now I can&rsquo;t get it because it&rsquo;s nine fucking grand</p>
<p>So I really don&rsquo;t have any idea where to find a similar couch</p>
<p>It was exactly what I wanted and for a cheap-ass price seven hundred dollars. Oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna kick myself for that for the rest of my life, but I am gonna tell myself</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason it didn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>Because remember when I said I was in the car on the way to the store to go buy it and I was like no</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask my cousin&rsquo;s dad real quick before I go</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll buy it tomorrow like there was something that got me out of that car and made me not get that couch</p>
<p>There was a reason I did not get that couch</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna take it as that and be like, okay, it wasn&rsquo;t meant to be but bitch</p>
<p>Okay universe, where where is the meant to be? Where is my couch?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to spend three fucking grand on a couch like no. Oh</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m back at square one</p>
<p>I gotta go find a couch and go like to a reasonably priced store</p>
<p>Because I went to Ashley furniture like I didn&rsquo;t know they were so fucking expensive</p>
<p>There was a couch similar, but it was like seven grand and I was like, ooh, like you&rsquo;re Ashley furniture</p>
<p>What like why the fuck are you seven grand?</p>
<p>If you know anywhere to find cool couches that are not crazy expensive and that are real big and leather and cute</p>
<p>Fucking send it to me. Send me the link. Send me some kind of like send me the company name like y&rsquo;all help me</p>
<p>But yeah</p>
<p>My whole point of this podcast was to let you know that like so many little things kept happening</p>
<p>Where it would have easily stopped the old version of me</p>
<p>But me being determined and me being like yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna do this shit is what made me do it</p>
<p>but I also</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t assign a meaning to anything that was happening because had I told myself</p>
<p>Oh, maybe all of these things all these hiccups are happening because it&rsquo;s not meant to be if I would have told myself</p>
<p>Oh, maybe you&rsquo;re not meant to move here. Maybe this is just not meant to be that&rsquo;s why all of us is happening</p>
<p>I would have had a whole different experience. I would have been so discouraged</p>
<p>I would have probably bailed on it and bailed on moving to Houston as a whole</p>
<p>But not telling myself maybe it&rsquo;s not meant to be is what kept me going</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re seeing hiccups and you&rsquo;re seeing shit happen and it&rsquo;s like not a smooth path to get to where you want to go</p>
<p>Watch the meanings you assign to things don&rsquo;t tell yourself</p>
<p>Oh, maybe it&rsquo;s not meant to be because then you&rsquo;re gonna start seeing all the reasons that it might not be meant to be</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re gonna see a lot more of the hiccups than you didn&rsquo;t see before</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a lot more of the red flags</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t seeing before because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re choosing to focus on when you tell yourself</p>
<p>Oh, it might not be meant to be that&rsquo;s what your brains gonna look for</p>
<p>So I use it as an opportunity to prove to myself</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not stopping and I&rsquo;m proving to myself my ability to handle these fucking situations as they happen</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more things that have happened than just this but I&rsquo;m using it as an opportunity</p>
<p>Like I said to show myself I can handle it. I&rsquo;m gonna do it regardless like I can face these problems</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to rely on life going perfectly for me to get what I want</p>
<p>Like I can learn to surf the fucking waves as they come instead of just climbing out of the water cuz I&rsquo;m scared</p>
<p>or overwhelmed</p>
<p>But yeah, that&rsquo;s my whole little fucking spiel about this. I&rsquo;m so excited to move to Houston</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited to take you guys along for the journey. If you like this podcast</p>
<p>I just have one request and it&rsquo;s that you go leave me a five-star rating</p>
<p>Thank you so much</p>
<p>If you want to keep up with me all of my social media will be linked in the description of this podcast</p>
<p>Also, if you are interested in one-on-one coaching with me I have now created an application process</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s no longer just free to schedule. I&rsquo;m doing applications now to keep up with the demand because it just got too high</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m screening people</p>
<p>Basically to see who&rsquo;s a good fit and who&rsquo;s not because I want to work with action takers</p>
<p>I want to work with people that are serious about transforming their life because the shit that I say y&rsquo;all know</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for and where I specialize is with the people that have been looking for answers</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t find and the people that have been trying shit and it&rsquo;s just not working</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the person that those people can go to</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in that I will put the link to the application in the description box also</p>
<p>and I want to make it very clear that</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already got what it takes</p>
<p>To get through what you&rsquo;re dealing with or to improve your life or to reach your goals</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll help you see that and it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot easier when you got me in your corner because that&rsquo;s exactly how</p>
<p>I want it to feel I want it to feel like you have someone that has your back and like I&rsquo;m in your corner because</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it is. Like I&rsquo;m there for you and I&rsquo;m there to do shit with you</p>
<p>But anyways, thank you so much for listening. Please stay safe and take care of yourself and I will talk to you next Sunday</p>
