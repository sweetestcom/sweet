<p>it looks like</p>
<p>self defense</p>
<p>clock somebody with that over the head you know</p>
<p>it would be better for his</p>
<p>metal instead of fake</p>
<p>pussy so to do</p>
<p>or if you had the container</p>
<p>with some sort of like</p>
<p>shards on the outside of it you</p>
<p>could be yeah i</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a weapon that&rsquo;s like a cudgel then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going back in time if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have something this big shouldn&rsquo;t you have a gun</p>
<p>maybe maybe you can&rsquo;t have a gun i don&rsquo;t know guns</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>cheap and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that expensive</p>
<p>in bed or something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>but a lot of people</p>
<p>sleep with a gun</p>
<p>under their pillow</p>
<p>talk about having some fucking</p>
<p>crazy dreams that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how about that suck</p>

<p>under my pillow</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m paranoid</p>
<p>about having a gun in my</p>
<p>house just because if i come home too</p>
<p>stoned or drunk one day i&rsquo;m like who for guns</p>
<p>can imagine having it</p>
<p>in bed when you&rsquo;re half asleep</p>
<p>going really</p>
<p>can you get that stoned</p>
<p>well i mean</p>
<p>drunk and drunk and</p>
<p>stone together i</p>
<p>guess yeah that&rsquo;s a not a good</p>
<p>combo it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re enlightened and you&rsquo;re sure of it</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m scared i</p>
<p>like shoot somebody</p>
<p>that is what it is</p>
<p>right drunk and</p>
<p>stone is like you&rsquo;re enlightened and you&rsquo;re arrogant</p>
<p>about it it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tuned into the</p>
<p>universe and you&rsquo;ll want everybody to know come on man</p>
<p>i got fucking tuned in</p>
<p>so what was this orange car that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching you</p>
<p>drive this fucking insane</p>
<p>sports car that is a</p>
<p>spiker c eight</p>
<p>lobby a lot</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a custom made</p>
<p>sports car cost like</p>
<p>three hundred thousand dollars something like that damn</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>whole inside is bespoke</p>
<p>and it was really nice it was kind of</p>
<p>thing where</p>
<p>i was one of the few</p>
<p>things i was really afraid to</p>
<p>drive because</p>
<p>unlike you know</p>
<p>three hundred thousand dollar</p>
<p>scoop loader or something</p>
<p>those things are</p>
<p>meant to get</p>
<p>dirty and kinda</p>
<p>right and kick it but this thing</p>
<p>i sat on the hood of it and</p>
<p>afterwards he was like you realize you could have</p>
<p>destroyed that car just</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s aluminum</p>
<p>yeah you can&rsquo;t sit on someone&rsquo;s hood when they got a</p>
<p>300 000 car</p>
<p>i kind of like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m looking at you</p>
<p>right now son</p>
<p>is laying on it</p>
<p>are you fucking evenly distributing my weight oh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like a geisha</p>
<p>you would even</p>
<p>crush a pea i was laying upon it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the princess and the pea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it was that story</p>
<p>he sort of she chastised me for that because</p>
<p>i guess even a dent</p>
<p>would be paying for it yeah man you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be fucking with a car like this you&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>drive it gingerly did you go off the</p>
<p>track at all we did</p>
<p>he was driving and we</p>
<p>tried to do the</p>
<p>stunt where</p>
<p>we pulled it onto a moving red carpet where</p>
<p>you might be able to see this i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching you put</p>
<p>nails out for somebody that was for my car we</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t raced my car</p>
<p>which is 1990</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a 2001</p>
<p>honda accord</p>
<p>why did you have them blow out your tires</p>
<p>oh cuz why not i</p>
<p>guess you know just for a tv show</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s that shit&rsquo;s dangerous</p>
<p>though isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a professional driver</p>
<p>so he had it</p>
<p>but he had no idea that you were</p>
<p>gonna do that to him</p>
<p>and it was really your car he</p>
<p>had some idea of something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen okay yeah so he knew</p>
<p>they sign away everything</p>
<p>of course yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they did on fear factor to sign away</p>
<p>everything but so</p>
<p>tell me the premise of the</p>
<p>series cause</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m seeing you</p>
<p>right now you got to</p>
<p>drive this killer car</p>
<p>and then you fuck up your car</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty simple the premise it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of those</p>
<p>things where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very simple it&rsquo;s also kind of hard</p>
<p>to explain as soon as people see it like oh i get it</p>
<p>right away somebody</p>
<p>said the video but</p>
<p>basically i</p>
<p>travel around the country</p>
<p>and i drive or fly or</p>
<p>go inside of different sort of</p>
<p>weird vehicles like submarines or</p>
<p>tanks stunt planes</p>
<p>fighter jets anything like that all kinds of</p>
<p>weird stuff</p>
<p>and i meet the guys who</p>
<p>own operate or have</p>
<p>built these</p>
<p>things and i</p>
<p>kinda you know get to know him</p>
<p>um get to know the</p>
<p>vehicle and then i</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>drive and i</p>
<p>get a little when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>driving this 300 thousand dollar car i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching now</p>
<p>you guys are driving it up a ramp onto a moving</p>
<p>truck that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where we almost</p>
<p>crashed oh my god i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching it</p>
<p>right now went sideways and spun out yeah and he was</p>
<p>he was freaked out that was that was about</p>
<p>that was the dumbest idea ever</p>
<p>the fucking ramp had a carpet on it the</p>
<p>carpet sliding</p>
<p>on a moving red carpet</p>
<p>that was ridiculous</p>
<p>son well that&rsquo;s the big</p>
<p>point of the show is like we do all</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not supposed to do with these</p>
<p>vehicles so it&rsquo;s like top gear for retards yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>for retards not to</p>
<p>retards for me yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my kind of retard</p>
<p>not retarded like real like</p>
<p>down syndrome</p>
<p>but retarded like i&rsquo;m a retard</p>
<p>and the whole idea is that i really have no</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not a good driver i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not a professional driver and we know i&rsquo;m doing it all</p>
<p>you must be getting better all this</p>
<p>driving though i&rsquo;m getting better i feel like i can opt</p>
<p>during these zombie</p>
<p>apocalypse i&rsquo;ll be able to jump into one of</p>
<p>36 different</p>
<p>vehicles and operate them to plow i think</p>
<p>on a racetrack like this like what you&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>right now this looks like a fucking fun</p>
<p>place to drive</p>
<p>a fast car it was pretty fun having a fast car on the</p>
<p>street is kind of</p>
<p>stupid you know because if you</p>
<p>crashed into</p>
<p>somebody god you feel like such a douchebag</p>
<p>yeah you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>open it up either you can&rsquo;t really let it let it out</p>
<p>right but having</p>
<p>something like this like you&rsquo;ve got here on this track</p>
<p>that must be so much fun i need to do that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something you need to do you could</p>
<p>probably easily do that like you rent the track yeah</p>
<p>and you just run a car</p>
<p>right to let you run on your poor you</p>
<p>bring your own car yeah</p>
<p>i want to get like a nice</p>
<p>honda civic</p>
<p>just ready to die</p>
<p>honda civic</p>
<p>you can just</p>
<p>destroy it to</p>
<p>death now you look like such a nice young man</p>
<p>you look like like a very friendly</p>
<p>not violent</p>
<p>not crazy person</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a friendly guy</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a friendly guy but</p>
<p>you like to</p>
<p>smash i am i</p>
<p>definitely there is</p>
<p>definitely is a</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t necessarily get what you see with me</p>
<p>fully so a lot of people are</p>
<p>shocked when i</p>
<p>you know say fuck or something like that</p>
<p>right so wait</p>
<p>who what are you so it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>cool for you hosting the show you know yeah it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>great because to me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>stand up comedian</p>
<p>stuff so that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>do normally</p>
<p>would be doing anyways is just</p>
<p>running my mouth right</p>
<p>and being a smartass</p>
<p>which is kind of the</p>

<p>where we usually go</p>
<p>wednesday night</p>
<p>at that place is a good</p>
<p>place to work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where i was going</p>
<p>i always wanted</p>
<p>whenever i go</p>
<p>on the road if i have to do like a weekend</p>
<p>you know if we do like a</p>
<p>bunch of shows i always want to like</p>

<p>first i always want to do like a wednesday</p>
<p>night show that to me</p>
<p>my shows always go better when i do something like that</p>
<p>so the improv is perfect for that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>place to fuck around yeah</p>
<p>better at the</p>
<p>crowds a random bar</p>
<p>yeah these fucking</p>
<p>the problem of</p>
<p>these bar places</p>
<p>like these bar comedy</p>
<p>shows that people are doing</p>
<p>this is still a bar man</p>
<p>freddy soto said it best god</p>
<p>bless his soul</p>
<p>he was when he was like god</p>
<p>bless his soul that freddy</p>
<p>sound like my</p>
<p>grandmother</p>
<p>he was an awesome dude</p>
<p>what else can you say he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great guy he passed away</p>
<p>years ago but he</p>
<p>would get offered all the time to do</p>
<p>these comedy clubs</p>
<p>like not comedy clubs rather but a comedy show a comedy</p>
<p>night at mcfuckle hut</p>
<p>bar down the</p>
<p>street and he</p>
<p>would say no</p>
<p>thank you i</p>
<p>appreciate the offer but</p>
<p>you know i only do comedy clubs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really the really way you</p>
<p>should do it you know</p>
<p>it would be nice i mean i wish i</p>
<p>could say that but</p>
<p>i mean i i i</p>
<p>feel like i owe a lot of my comedy to doing</p>
<p>the learning how to do comedy</p>
<p>in the worst</p>
<p>place in the</p>
<p>whole fucking universe which is</p>
<p>the big fish bar and</p>
<p>grill in glendale</p>
<p>which we used to do show</p>
<p>our friend doug did</p>
<p>show their every</p>
<p>doug and david did show there</p>
<p>every single tuesday</p>
<p>and this was like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this was in a</p>
<p>total locals bar</p>
<p>right anyone who walked in there</p>
<p>who was doing anything</p>
<p>other than who</p>
<p>was if you didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t know you like look at you like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>crazy let alone a fucking comedy show where</p>
<p>half the comedians are open micers and</p>
<p>stuff and so it was really</p>
<p>that was like being purified through</p>
<p>pain for like two years so i feel like there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>i went there was</p>
<p>a good point</p>
<p>i went there</p>
<p>once for a show and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only time i&rsquo;ve ever been to this place and</p>
<p>like tim and tim and eric did a set</p>
<p>yeah well and i</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t character or</p>
<p>yeah they didn&rsquo;t this was like</p>
<p>three years ago four years ago</p>
<p>right yes i know them i met him because he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>used to be hosted by doug</p>
<p>was one of my best friends doug lesson hop in denver</p>
<p>and doug works on the tim and eric</p>
<p>show he&rsquo;s editor on</p>
<p>right at the</p>
<p>show so sort</p>
<p>of like it&rsquo;s all coming together hang out zone for them</p>
<p>cool so this</p>
<p>this mega drive show that you do</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve actually done</p>
<p>fighter jets</p>
<p>too and you puked didn&rsquo;t you when you did it or</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t puke in the</p>
<p>fighter jet because this was the</p>
<p>second thing we flew</p>
<p>the first thing was the</p>
<p>stunt plane that did like</p>
<p>i can do every possible</p>
<p>thing in the air that</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>possible even he let me fly it too</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like you have the</p>
<p>stick you have control</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m sitting</p>
<p>there like really and he&rsquo;s like yeah just pull back</p>
<p>you pull back and you</p>
<p>literally just does a loop</p>
<p>no problem it&rsquo;s easier than a</p>
<p>video game but i did</p>
<p>throw up in that thing</p>
<p>all over the place</p>
<p>i did a loop in fa 18</p>
<p>man i did a whole run</p>
<p>a ride with the blue</p>
<p>angels it was one of one of</p>
<p>the bits that i did and one of my past specials was</p>
<p>about it about how fucking</p>
<p>crazy the experience is</p>
<p>but that ultimately</p>
<p>pussy&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>for no reason to really fly that fast</p>
<p>right now yeah</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other shit you can do here that&rsquo;s way better it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary but it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>the same thing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty intense though the physical demands that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>freak me out i always thought</p>
<p>for some reason it was like driving a car</p>
<p>you know you just kind of</p>
<p>steer your whole</p>
<p>body and you</p>
<p>never really get that far</p>
<p>or that fast</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of g</p>
<p>force on your body and you mean</p>
<p>even if you really stop the gas what is that like a</p>
<p>tenth of your body weight coming at you like wow really</p>
<p>threw me back in my seat</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know what</p>
<p>throw you back in your seat is</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re in like a fucking</p>
<p>fighter jet</p>
<p>like six g six g turn</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even move your arms and you have to do that like the</p>
<p>the special breathing</p>
<p>i think i got the six and a half or seven g&rsquo;s</p>
<p>before i couldn&rsquo;t take anymore</p>
<p>that was hard</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s good because i&rsquo;m short</p>
<p>because fighter</p>
<p>pilots are supposed to be</p>
<p>under six feet tall because</p>
<p>the amount of pressure</p>
<p>for them it&rsquo;s so intense because</p>
<p>the blood has</p>
<p>traveled further to</p>
<p>their brain</p>
<p>so they blackout</p>
<p>quicker you do a</p>
<p>thing called hooking and this is what you really</p>
<p>do you hold on to your seatbelt or you hold onto the</p>
<p>stick and you go like this</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re forcing blood into your face</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re forcing in your head you going</p>
<p>and his plans going</p>
<p>the fucking pressure is insane</p>
<p>and it literally is like closing an elevator door</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like your consciousness you can see it black</p>
<p>and black sides and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting it off</p>
<p>this guy could go to thirteen g&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fighter pilot wow that&rsquo;s fucking incredible</p>
<p>he goes to thirteen g&rsquo;s without a pressure suit</p>
<p>they have suits where you can go more g&rsquo;s but he</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t wearing a g suit those blue</p>
<p>angels don&rsquo;t wear them or they didn&rsquo;t at the time</p>
<p>those little</p>
<p>red bull racer</p>
<p>planes those things pull</p>
<p>like 20 g&rsquo;s regularly</p>
<p>how do you stay conscious i don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>i mean i think sky bees part of the g students the</p>
<p>training it&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how you stay conscious</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s retarded i went</p>
<p>unconscious accidentally</p>
<p>because there was more gs than i expected</p>
<p>i did the higher</p>
<p>thing but then we were coming in</p>
<p>we pulled this really hard one</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know how many gs it was when i</p>
<p>blacked out really yeah how long were you</p>
<p>out for a second</p>
<p>wow i don&rsquo;t know it wasn&rsquo;t long but it was like whoa</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a crazy</p>
<p>blackout to come back from like</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>what yeah he said i just went out for a couple</p>
<p>seconds but i felt it like i felt</p>
<p>popping back on you know when the g</p>
<p>force leveled out</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because i didn&rsquo;t do the hooking thing</p>
<p>do they doing those</p>
<p>those one g barrel rolls</p>
<p>we did everything we did</p>
<p>this we did loops we did</p>
<p>this we strafeed this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like this mountain canyon and he</p>
<p>simulated what it</p>
<p>would be like if you were in afghanistan or</p>
<p>so this is actually before the war this is like 99</p>
<p>and he simulated what it</p>
<p>would be like hills</p>
<p>cause we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going about</p>
<p>two hundred</p>
<p>three hundred feet</p>
<p>above the ground you cool</p>
<p>with that oh man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like through</p>
<p>three hundred feet that&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>right we&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>right alright come on let&rsquo;s do this he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>well you know what this guy is fucking</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s like straight top gun he&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>those real guys you know real fucking</p>
<p>fighter pilot</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>crazy like that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going into the mountains like</p>
<p>going around these fucking that shit&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>200 feet above the ground man</p>
<p>whipping through</p>
<p>it was so crazy and then they have these targets</p>
<p>they do it out in the desert between vegas and la</p>
<p>and they have these</p>
<p>targets all laid out on the ground</p>
<p>where they practice dropping shit on so other</p>
<p>you know at this air force base other</p>
<p>fighter jets you know the blue angels don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they drop bombs yeah they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>x fighters yeah but so they have like practice</p>
<p>ranges man they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>dropping bombs out there in the desert</p>
<p>like dummy bombs you know</p>
<p>look working on their accuracy it is one</p>
<p>thing when i was in the this is like a czechoslovakian</p>
<p>fighter j called l</p>
<p>thirty nine</p>
<p>you can do this barrel roll where they keep it at at uh</p>
<p>at gravity so there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>they do it just enough to</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the same amount of gravity</p>
<p>would fill on earth even though you&rsquo;re upside down</p>
<p>wow so you feel like</p>
<p>you could throw a ball in there it would come back down</p>
<p>the same as on earth because these what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some sort of very regimented type of barrel roll</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re pulling out</p>
<p>you know that whole theory like so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>completely upside down but because the momentum of the</p>
<p>plane going down</p>
<p>right you can</p>
<p>you can be upside down and</p>
<p>throw a ball up and it will come back</p>
<p>right right your hand i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they have to keep the role</p>
<p>going to maintain it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know those</p>
<p>spaceship designs the giant wheel where they spin</p>
<p>just enough to keep gravity on the outer rim</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like isn&rsquo;t that that&rsquo;s in 2001 isn&rsquo;t it i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s basically that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>centrifugal</p>
<p>force or something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing that was so cool that was really cool</p>
<p>just the fact that someone figured that you</p>
<p>could do that and then they</p>
<p>tried it out and then they figured</p>
<p>out exactly how to pull it off</p>
<p>and information</p>
<p>upside down</p>
<p>throwing something up the end it comes</p>
<p>right back to you just as if you were</p>
<p>right side up wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking nuts it was cool</p>
<p>i fucking i i don&rsquo;t know if i</p>
<p>would be i i&rsquo;m not i don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>self control to be doing a show like that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll do something</p>
<p>stupid i did take a couple of shits in the woods</p>
<p>when i had to</p>
<p>when you had to yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about it and you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>wrecked a few</p>
<p>things though</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve actually have</p>
<p>mtv has they have</p>
<p>their full episodes on</p>
<p>mtv but they also have</p>
<p>this whole thing</p>
<p>where the things you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>wrecked yep</p>
<p>i mean like</p>
<p>wreck wrecked i</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>different levels the very</p>
<p>first day we shot was was that like rape rape yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know it was just the head</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t like a</p>
<p>full wreck wrecked</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t destroy anything nothing was like</p>
<p>destroyed like okay it&rsquo;s totaled</p>
<p>but the very</p>
<p>first day i</p>
<p>crashed an aerial atom</p>
<p>that was totally by accident</p>
<p>cause i was trying to you know</p>
<p>go a little faster johnny on this curve so</p>
<p>it looks better and like okay fine</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s an aerial</p>
<p>adam it&rsquo;s this little race car it&rsquo;s an open air it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically a fucking go kart with a really big</p>
<p>honda engine in it</p>
<p>that goes what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so sick it goes so fast it&rsquo;s tiny</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a cage just</p>
<p>basically a cage around wheels</p>
<p>and they have exposed</p>
<p>all the suspension and</p>
<p>everything is exposed</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just the wheels and</p>
<p>these rods and</p>
<p>shit and you know this little cone of a body</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s nothing there</p>
<p>and it goes like 0 60 faster than any</p>
<p>street legal car did</p>
<p>you hurt yourself doing that no</p>
<p>i was super i mean so</p>
<p>lucky it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know first day</p>
<p>stroke of luck</p>
<p>where i happened to hit the very last</p>
<p>few inches of the warning</p>
<p>guard that has like a</p>
<p>bunch of tires</p>
<p>stacked up so we rammed in</p>
<p>these tires which are</p>
<p>soft and cushiony but just a few</p>
<p>it was inches the</p>
<p>wheel got hung up inches away</p>
<p>from where it would have</p>
<p>smashed into this big metal</p>
<p>galvanized steel</p>
<p>guard rail so</p>
<p>that would have</p>
<p>fucked you up to</p>
<p>right in that little</p>
<p>thing we&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>going like 30 or 40 but i would have</p>
<p>fucked us up a little bit at</p>
<p>least would have</p>
<p>fucked the machine up and</p>
<p>i would have been</p>
<p>sort of in trouble</p>
<p>so you get in</p>
<p>trouble if you crash</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>supposed to know what you&rsquo;re doing that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like i don&rsquo;t get in</p>
<p>trouble it&rsquo;s actually like</p>
<p>the mtv gets in</p>
<p>trouble but the producers are like thank you</p>
<p>thank you for doing really</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re happy there&rsquo;s controversy because that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>cause more people to</p>
<p>watch it yeah it&rsquo;s more fun</p>
<p>with stephen</p>
<p>do they should</p>
<p>happens do they give you instruction like hey don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>crazy go out there and do this or what do they</p>
<p>say to you i mean in general it&rsquo;s sort of like just</p>
<p>have fun but try not to kill anybody</p>
<p>yeah you have meetings with you like all</p>
<p>right johnny yeah we</p>
<p>make sure we&rsquo;re all on the same page here we have</p>
<p>safety meetings like</p>
<p>these were the cameras are</p>
<p>gonna be these are where</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t go over there i&rsquo;m always on walkie so</p>
<p>for most times so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty it&rsquo;s pretty safe at the same time it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>sounds like a cool</p>
<p>ass show though it was incredibly fun to make is also</p>
<p>really scary sometimes</p>
<p>it sounds like</p>
<p>a more interesting</p>
<p>idea than like the top gear show</p>
<p>i love that show i</p>
<p>think that jeremy</p>
<p>clarkson guys hilarious yeah he&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>great i guess there&rsquo;s an american version</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>make one now</p>
<p>but jeremy clarkson is so awesome i don&rsquo;t know why you</p>
<p>would need to make an american version</p>
<p>but the point is that he&rsquo;s at his best when he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>reviewing crazy cars</p>
<p>but they have to review a lot of shit like</p>
<p>normal cars</p>
<p>they spend a lot of</p>
<p>their time reviewing like</p>
<p>trucks and shit</p>
<p>you know this is a minivan</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s not interesting to me i</p>
<p>wanna see him in ferraris</p>
<p>you know when he&rsquo;s in ferraris are it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>right screaming the guy</p>
<p>legitimately he&rsquo;s in his fifties</p>
<p>legitimately loves cars you can so sing it</p>
<p>he just he&rsquo;s singing it when</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s when he&rsquo;s when he&rsquo;s in the cars like yelling out</p>
<p>like he loves</p>
<p>it like it makes it fun and people people love</p>
<p>anything that goes forward on</p>
<p>wheels at all they</p>
<p>freak out about</p>
<p>we went to this like this rally</p>
<p>in where is it like someplace in florida</p>
<p>tarpon springs florida i think</p>
<p>and they have</p>
<p>this used to be</p>
<p>swamp buggies</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never seen this in my life it looks like a</p>
<p>giant like rocket</p>
<p>will have these flat</p>
<p>wheels on each side</p>
<p>and they can go 70</p>
<p>miles an hour and like four feet of</p>
<p>standing water wow</p>
<p>and like what the fuck</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>thousands of people here thousands of rednecks</p>
<p>going crazy in</p>
<p>these campgrounds around this</p>
<p>mud bog and have all these</p>
<p>different heats and races</p>
<p>must be like</p>
<p>a couple hundred</p>
<p>maybe at least a hundred</p>
<p>these things there</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never even</p>
<p>heard of it my entire life yet this is like</p>
<p>some someone&rsquo;s life you know this is</p>
<p>two hundred thousand dollars on this thing</p>
<p>this is not so far removed from some sort of a fucking</p>
<p>scene in the hobbit movie</p>
<p>you stumble upon</p>
<p>some strange</p>
<p>village of a</p>
<p>bunch of weirdos doing</p>
<p>something that no one ever</p>
<p>expected i felt i felt very out of</p>
<p>place there i had like some</p>
<p>yeah i was just constantly i felt like how</p>
<p>the hills have</p>
<p>eyes always like people looking at me like</p>
<p>look at that boy down there we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna cut him up</p>
<p>have a haircut</p>
<p>we got a faggot</p>
<p>on the march</p>
<p>room around here</p>
<p>i felt a little bit</p>
<p>intimidated</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>those people out there oh yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re not represented</p>
<p>that well in the</p>
<p>media but there&rsquo;s a fucking lot there&rsquo;s more than us</p>
<p>yeah yeah most likely definitely</p>
<p>yeah right yeah</p>
<p>well that was</p>
<p>where i got an accident</p>
<p>during that</p>
<p>shoot actually i was driving this little</p>
<p>weird different kind of mud but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go as fast and i</p>
<p>the thing doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>brakes by some</p>
<p>special invention of the clutch and gas you can</p>
<p>you know down</p>
<p>shift to make it stop but i totally forgot that</p>
<p>was leaving the</p>
<p>water and i</p>
<p>smash right into this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>brand new like f</p>
<p>three fifty or something like that</p>
<p>brand new i</p>
<p>smash right into it and was like all</p>
<p>sudden people</p>
<p>started coming out of the woods or like</p>
<p>what this guy what this guy do over here</p>
<p>get a rope new york city get a rope</p>
<p>he was being</p>
<p>lynched on these</p>
<p>these redneck</p>
<p>campgrounds in florida</p>
<p>but luckily i got</p>
<p>do you have</p>
<p>like bodyguards or any kind of security on the</p>
<p>staff to just in case help</p>
<p>you at all i mean</p>
<p>not even one there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>peep there&rsquo;s pas and</p>
<p>stuff obviously but that</p>
<p>who knows if they</p>
<p>would be able to stop the redneck mob that wanted to</p>
<p>destroy me for hitting the truck but</p>
<p>everything worked out you know we</p>
<p>settled up with them and</p>
<p>everything but it was a little</p>
<p>scary for about fifteen</p>
<p>seconds i was like this is</p>
<p>some strapped into this thing</p>
<p>god damn dude</p>
<p>yeah i was a little</p>
<p>spooky i think that&rsquo;s on next week&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pretty sure yeah</p>
<p>or was that the most</p>
<p>freaked out you ever were um</p>
<p>no i think it&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>freaked out probably with this crane</p>
<p>um yeah okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good premise with that</p>
<p>the crane because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a man</p>
<p>basket or a man bucket they call these the</p>
<p>thing you know like the cherry picker like</p>
<p>the send the guy up to wherever so this is</p>
<p>seventy a cherry picker it&rsquo;s like you know ten times</p>
<p>is high and</p>
<p>how high well this</p>
<p>thing can go like a thousand feet or something</p>
<p>but i wasn&rsquo;t that high</p>
<p>dude there was a</p>
<p>video of these russian kids have you seen that</p>
<p>video these kids 900 feet on this</p>
<p>building construction they&rsquo;re walking out on</p>
<p>these beams yes and 900</p>
<p>feet core kids kind of or no no no</p>
<p>no no no no no no no no no</p>
<p>these are just</p>
<p>that were just</p>
<p>standing there</p>
<p>it was so high up they were just standing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>standing on</p>
<p>these beams and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch it without</p>
<p>making a walnut</p>
<p>crushing motion with your asshole</p>
<p>you know you just tighten up and like oh my god just</p>
<p>watching the</p>
<p>video is such a</p>
<p>fucking freak out i&rsquo;ve seen a</p>
<p>video like that</p>
<p>where it was either hiking or bike riding on these like</p>
<p>small pass on the side of this mountain</p>
<p>and the guy had like a cam on him</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s just walking</p>
<p>thousand thousand feet up and then you</p>
<p>could just see holes in the stone like</p>
<p>thing that he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>forget that</p>
<p>something about heights it really really</p>
<p>freaks people out it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>nature&rsquo;s trying to tell you hey stu</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t go anywhere fucking near</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t get used to i mean you can get</p>
<p>used to it but if you are used to it there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>yeah weird about that you got issues son yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong with you i</p>
<p>could look out the second</p>
<p>window of the second</p>
<p>floor and i get scared</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s terrifying</p>
<p>so you were higher than that so this was at 900 feet</p>
<p>that were you that high there was two different</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>was i was about maybe</p>
<p>200 feet when i was in this</p>
<p>peter pan costume</p>
<p>and i was like flying over this lumber yard</p>
<p>fucking with people and i also did this thing</p>
<p>where i pretended</p>
<p>to be a guy who worked there and i kept</p>
<p>descending from the roof taking people&rsquo;s receipts and</p>
<p>there are different</p>
<p>things and just you know</p>
<p>it was like a little</p>
<p>kind of drop in maneuver and the exit of the</p>
<p>building that was fun</p>
<p>that was crazy</p>
<p>yeah but that was i was in a harness</p>
<p>with an invisible</p>
<p>cables so that was</p>
<p>that was pretty fucking</p>
<p>scary are those comfortable at all</p>
<p>it was really uncomfortable but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it would be a serious ball</p>
<p>crusher it was</p>
<p>as much a ball</p>
<p>crusher as it was like a</p>
<p>chest and body</p>
<p>crusher really</p>
<p>and also it&rsquo;s it feels nice though</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s tight because if it&rsquo;s not tight it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know fuck it</p>
<p>has to be so</p>
<p>crazy so you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>wearing some suit with wires attached to the suit yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s connecting you to how long is the wire</p>
<p>uh the wire i mean</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know probably a hundred feet or so</p>
<p>the fuck 100</p>
<p>feet of wire and</p>
<p>200 feet above the ground</p>
<p>yeah something like that we</p>
<p>would drop down to the ground and</p>
<p>stuff but at one</p>
<p>point i was</p>
<p>maybe not 200 feet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tough to say</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s 60 feet and 200 feet</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>kind of the same because you&rsquo;re all pretty much</p>
<p>gonna die if you fall so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>your brain stops</p>
<p>carrying after a certain</p>
<p>point i think we used to do these</p>
<p>stunts on fear factor</p>
<p>where we would have</p>
<p>these people like</p>
<p>walk across beams across two</p>
<p>buildings and to this day</p>
<p>thinking about looking over</p>
<p>those edges just</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>every now and then i look over the edge</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>thinking about that</p>
<p>right now makes my</p>
<p>whole body go</p>
<p>what the fuck you doing what the fuck you doing</p>
<p>get away from there</p>
<p>yeah so unnatural</p>
<p>such a it&rsquo;s such a like</p>
<p>primal feeling</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s your body</p>
<p>going no stupid get away from there</p>
<p>anytime i&rsquo;m in a</p>
<p>hotel like over a certain amount of floors you</p>
<p>dude freaky</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t do that shit i like it i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>enjoy it but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like being</p>
<p>scared enjoy the rush</p>
<p>yeah like freaking the shit out myself i just</p>
<p>are you a daredevil with other</p>
<p>things do you do like</p>
<p>skateboarding or anything</p>
<p>other another</p>
<p>crazy no condom not really</p>
<p>only in me right</p>
<p>i used to do a lot of rock</p>
<p>climbing stuff as a</p>
<p>kid and bungee jumping and crap but oh yeah i feel like</p>
<p>honestly i feel like when i</p>
<p>started doing comedy that sort of</p>
<p>i stopped i stopped doing that</p>
<p>stuff because i feel like comedies is one of the best</p>
<p>best russia</p>
<p>is yeah that&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>better than almost anything and it only kill your soul</p>
<p>right yeah won&rsquo;t kill your body</p>
<p>i saw a video</p>
<p>of a dude bungie jumping once and that was it for me</p>
<p>he miscalculated the amount</p>
<p>of bungie he needed and he hit the fucking ground hard</p>
<p>did he die no</p>
<p>it was even</p>
<p>worse than dying</p>
<p>cause his whole body was just broken</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s screaming in agony</p>
<p>and then he bounces and hits it again</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>screaming in agony</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just broken</p>
<p>broken arms broken</p>
<p>legum he hits this</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>hard and rocks he&rsquo;s wearing a camera</p>
<p>oh shit so it&rsquo;s all on camera listen</p>
<p>listen you see</p>
<p>this camera</p>
<p>here it&rsquo;s horrendous this the pain</p>
<p>of this guy&rsquo;s feeling</p>
<p>you can tell when he hits a</p>
<p>second time</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s already broken</p>
<p>everything in his fucking body in the</p>
<p>first one cause the bungee</p>
<p>cord didn&rsquo;t really break</p>
<p>he basically jumped off a bridge and just</p>
<p>it really didn&rsquo;t stop him at all</p>
<p>so this motherfucker slams the ground with</p>
<p>three quarters of whatever</p>
<p>velocity that you</p>
<p>would normally have</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s jacked</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s broken</p>
<p>he bounces up in the air and then when he hits it again</p>
<p>the oh my god</p>
<p>why me it was that you said that no but you</p>
<p>can feel that you know what i&rsquo;m saying no way</p>
<p>but telling you how</p>
<p>and that was it for me</p>
<p>i was like no bungee</p>
<p>jumping thank you very much this</p>
<p>woman that worked with my dad a while</p>
<p>back was always trying to get her him to do</p>
<p>skydiving and then so he was actually</p>
<p>considering it</p>
<p>until she died</p>
<p>oh my god she died</p>
<p>skydiving yeah</p>
<p>the parachute malfunction and then i</p>
<p>guess the backup parachute</p>
<p>tangled in with</p>
<p>the other parachute or something and</p>
<p>she just died she died of a cliche yeah</p>
<p>god damn that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>scary see that&rsquo;s a shit</p>
<p>how often does that happen i</p>
<p>think it happens a lot more than you</p>
<p>think because you</p>
<p>would think you would hear</p>
<p>about that on the news if that</p>
<p>happened but everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like yeah you got two parachutes what are you</p>
<p>worried about</p>
<p>right oh nothing just falling from 10 000 feet</p>
<p>slowly i did</p>
<p>bunch of jumping</p>
<p>in switzerland once</p>
<p>and it was in</p>
<p>this in the mountains in this chasm like this</p>
<p>a chasm over like a this</p>
<p>this freezing cold river</p>
<p>and off a little bridge and it was you know like</p>
<p>gonna do this</p>
<p>on my birthday was my friend you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>traveling so</p>
<p>i did it it was fucking awesome</p>
<p>i found out</p>
<p>afterwards though</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking to the guy</p>
<p>after you know the guy who ran the</p>
<p>whole operations like yeah so how long</p>
<p>how long is this</p>
<p>this said i&rsquo;ve been here it&rsquo;s like eight days</p>
<p>fucking eight days we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>maybe like in the tens of people who&rsquo;ve been off this</p>
<p>thing he&rsquo;s like oh no</p>
<p>we tested it out a</p>
<p>lot we tested it out of time we put like body armor on</p>
<p>stuff and like</p>
<p>oh my god and he said like this is the closest jump</p>
<p>at that time</p>
<p>in existence that you came</p>
<p>closest to the rocks than any</p>
<p>other bungee</p>
<p>jump oh that seems like a</p>
<p>good idea but</p>
<p>i wish i&rsquo;m glad i</p>
<p>learned it afterwards not before</p>
<p>oh my god it was</p>
<p>still great that was incredible</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>picture of me</p>
<p>you know how you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to do this with your hands as you go down</p>
<p>somehow instinctively</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just grabbing my fucking balls</p>
<p>and even i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>head down grab my balls that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>picture of me</p>
<p>bunch of jumping</p>
<p>wow yeah that&rsquo;s fucked up hey john</p>
<p>are joe here&rsquo;s a fun fact</p>
<p>about johnny he does not have a butthole</p>
<p>i have a butthole</p>
<p>oh but you got it removed</p>
<p>no jesus christ you got this all wrong</p>
<p>that right there someone edit this</p>
<p>someone cut and paste this somewhere</p>
<p>this is the classic</p>
<p>brian moment</p>
<p>well i think</p>
<p>this is how</p>
<p>rumors get started i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>heard that in my entire life that&rsquo;s pretty incredible</p>
<p>remember that song rumors</p>
<p>this is how rumors get started</p>
<p>started by jealous people it should</p>
<p>say jealous people and</p>
<p>brian cause</p>
<p>brian would just start</p>
<p>that shit up well what i said is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a colon</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a colon i do have a sphincter</p>
<p>and everything works fine</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>colon no i have a colon i had ulcerative</p>
<p>colitis for about 10 years or so</p>
<p>and maybe a little more in that i</p>
<p>guess yeah about 10 years</p>
<p>and if you have ulcerative</p>
<p>colitis which is like a horrible</p>
<p>disease of your colon your large intestine it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>makes it all</p>
<p>so you have</p>
<p>to shit all the time and like really fast and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>generally bad</p>
<p>wow so i had that for a long time but if you have</p>
<p>ulcer class</p>
<p>for a long time</p>
<p>the thing is the longer you have it the more</p>
<p>chances of you getting</p>
<p>colon cancer like triple</p>
<p>every single year</p>
<p>so the idea is you get it</p>
<p>taken out and then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have like this fucking shitty</p>
<p>shitty organ shitty</p>
<p>the puns are like</p>
<p>limitless so</p>
<p>how does it change the way your body functions</p>
<p>where your digestive</p>
<p>system works i mean it basically</p>
<p>it changes a lot of</p>
<p>things but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t change that much from how it was</p>
<p>before because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a lot better</p>
<p>you know i still poop out of my asshole</p>
<p>and but i just get dehydrated cry</p>
<p>faster than</p>
<p>how rude of you describe it that way</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it funny that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rude ways to say</p>
<p>things like that i</p>
<p>guess i could</p>
<p>say this how i</p>
<p>still defecate</p>
<p>from my anus pastel</p>
<p>from my sphincter</p>
<p>anal sphincter</p>
<p>muscle and yeah</p>
<p>so where does it go like what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>colon what&rsquo;s the primary use</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m ignorant</p>
<p>primary use of your</p>
<p>colon is sort of to one to extract</p>
<p>water hydrate</p>
<p>you so it like it um</p>
<p>this extracts</p>
<p>water for your body</p>
<p>which your body needs water</p>
<p>it also extracts a lot of vitamin d</p>
<p>i think vitamin a and</p>
<p>maybe something else and</p>
<p>generally just aids and</p>
<p>digestion like you know extracting the</p>
<p>stuff from your food that you used</p>
<p>your body uses so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>necessary to have obviously cause i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still alive</p>
<p>right now so</p>
<p>but it definitely is a good</p>
<p>thing to have if it works</p>
<p>to me i probably go the bathroom</p>
<p>i probably been the bathroom more in my life than</p>
<p>you guys will ever in your entire fucking life so how</p>
<p>often do you take dumps</p>
<p>depends it depends it depends on like what i eat</p>
<p>and like how much i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>drinking and you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the average number a day</p>
<p>god i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s so hard to</p>
<p>think about this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like so if you say for like 50 i&rsquo;m just no</p>
<p>no no maybe</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>middle of this show to take a shit</p>
<p>would be so awkward</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll probably i&rsquo;ll do it for you if we</p>
<p>drop something i just want to be clear</p>
<p>about this if you&rsquo;re doing it you&rsquo;re doing it for you</p>
<p>yeah okay i want i won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i won&rsquo;t take a shit for you guys i promise yeah</p>
<p>oh man they like</p>
<p>take a shit for you yeah guys i</p>
<p>got a good one ready to go</p>
<p>take a shit and it&rsquo;s just for you it&rsquo;s got your name on</p>
<p>it i&rsquo;m gonna write</p>
<p>your fucking name</p>
<p>probably someone out there that</p>
<p>would say something like that there&rsquo;s a guy you know</p>
<p>once i met a guy like joey diaz i know that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s guys out there that you</p>
<p>could never</p>
<p>you can draw them</p>
<p>right yeah they</p>
<p>exist he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting guy he&rsquo;s as interesting as they come</p>
<p>so now where your</p>
<p>colon was before</p>
<p>does it do you have a hole like do you feel there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>place missing or does</p>
<p>everything sort of fill in</p>
<p>no it all kind of fills in your body just sort of like</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like a sack of</p>
<p>flour everything just</p>
<p>settles at the bottom i</p>
<p>guess oh that&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>looking at your</p>
<p>body i did have a colostomy bag for like 12 weeks</p>
<p>so you have to have two</p>
<p>surgeries and</p>
<p>you have them</p>
<p>they have to separate them because they have to take</p>
<p>everything down and they have to build</p>
<p>basically have to</p>
<p>build you a fake colon</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>my my case is called the j</p>
<p>pouch and that&rsquo;s not because my name</p>
<p>is johnny it&rsquo;s actually called fucking j pouch</p>
<p>ironically enough</p>
<p>but because your pet name yeah</p>
<p>yeah my j pouch</p>
<p>down there that&rsquo;s what she is pet</p>
<p>name from my</p>
<p>synthetic colon that&rsquo;s jenny um</p>
<p>oh jenny the jpack</p>
<p>tell you what</p>
<p>jenny takes a lot of shit down there she does but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>say man it&rsquo;s kind of degrading shit on a girl like</p>
<p>that but i don&rsquo;t see it like that we&rsquo;re helping each</p>
<p>other she&rsquo;s helping me i&rsquo;m helping her see</p>
<p>nothing degrading</p>
<p>about this just nature</p>
<p>just just you know it&rsquo;s a symbiotic relationship</p>
<p>like a clownfish and an anemone</p>
<p>i only met one person ever that had one of</p>
<p>those and it was very strange across</p>
<p>me back yeah</p>
<p>they are incredibly strange it&rsquo;s the kind of</p>
<p>thing where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most bizarre</p>
<p>thing ever and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people who live with them that that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>their life is they have a colostomy</p>
<p>back and those kind</p>
<p>i just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like for me it was always like this is</p>
<p>you know one more week two more you know sort of</p>
<p>things so it was</p>
<p>pretty easy to bear and i was it</p>
<p>just you know it was pretty</p>
<p>young was living at home so i was like didn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about anything but</p>
<p>god damn if you had</p>
<p>to actually do shit with that if you have to actually</p>
<p>now did you</p>
<p>after you had</p>
<p>these all these health issues did you</p>
<p>radically alter</p>
<p>your diet did you try to</p>
<p>start eating healthier food or</p>
<p>try to yeah i mean well the</p>
<p>thing is is like</p>
<p>with colitis even you have to like be careful because</p>
<p>your body isn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>digesting almost anything so really do you have</p>
<p>like a very</p>
<p>limited menu</p>
<p>of things you can eat</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t eat really</p>
<p>spicy stuff i take a lot of</p>
<p>fiber i&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>i can consult on</p>
<p>fiber for an hour you can have me on here as a</p>
<p>fiber consultant maybe</p>
<p>yeah so i think</p>
<p>fibers are very important</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important for everybody</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s super</p>
<p>like a lot of lettuce</p>
<p>and a lot of like broccoli and i take</p>
<p>these like awesome shits</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so satisfying they just come out like</p>
<p>your body thank you</p>
<p>blah blah blah blah so easy</p>
<p>but if i just eat like nothing but meat for days</p>
<p>super bad yeah</p>
<p>it just comes out like</p>
<p>just like your body trying to push out poison like</p>
<p>cause it is poison yeah</p>
<p>just ribs barbecued</p>
<p>ribs and sausage and shit like before the show</p>
<p>i came so close there&rsquo;s an italian deli</p>
<p>not too far</p>
<p>away from here that has this amazing sausage sub</p>
<p>sausage with peppers and i know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrible for you it</p>
<p>tastes so good terrible for you</p>
<p>smell so good and you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>those here in</p>
<p>california this</p>
<p>place is called cavaretta</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the valley</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no place like that</p>
<p>on the west coast</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get like real italian subs like a real</p>
<p>sausage with peppers with</p>
<p>grilled peppers peppers and eggs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an east</p>
<p>coast thing</p>
<p>yeah that was a</p>
<p>buddy really</p>
<p>new york and as you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>peppers and eggs you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t get peppers</p>
<p>and eggs here john can&rsquo;t get peppers and eggs true</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem very good to me though</p>
<p>peppers and eggs is probably the</p>
<p>worst thing i</p>
<p>could possibly eat</p>
<p>peppers and eggs</p>
<p>hot peppers and eggs</p>
<p>would be like</p>
<p>do you try to consume your</p>
<p>nutrients in</p>
<p>juice form do you try to</p>
<p>drink like a lot of</p>
<p>juices i don&rsquo;t know i try to</p>
<p>eat a lot of</p>
<p>dried fruit and</p>
<p>a lot of oatmeal and</p>
<p>a lot of whole</p>
<p>grain pancakes so you&rsquo;re doing all</p>
<p>about super</p>
<p>fiber shit yeah</p>
<p>but at the same time i&rsquo;m also really bad like</p>
<p>i eat all kinds of horrible</p>
<p>stuff and it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>this idea well i know this is gonna</p>
<p>i can make me feel like shit but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>whatever i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna everything</p>
<p>has a consequence</p>
<p>i feel like so i knew this dude who had diabetes and he</p>
<p>would every now and then he</p>
<p>would go off and</p>
<p>crazy sugar and have a just this fucking horrible</p>
<p>insulin failure</p>
<p>see that&rsquo;s different you can kill yourself with that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not gonna kill myself eat hot wings do we</p>
<p>just go off</p>
<p>every now and then just couldn&rsquo;t take it</p>
<p>just go off and get just jack his body</p>
<p>fill it up with the delicious poison</p>
<p>did your farts change at all</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s actually a</p>
<p>great question brian</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>question fucking dead serious</p>
<p>folks farts dead</p>
<p>serious really</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t actually do a lot of farting anymore</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things where</p>
<p>if your bowels have been sort of uh</p>
<p>operate upon or mess with in any way like that</p>
<p>you you um you kind of lose the ability to tell</p>
<p>shit from a fart</p>
<p>so in general</p>
<p>you typically just choose not to fart</p>
<p>then oh my god</p>
<p>roll the dice of it</p>
<p>wow you don&rsquo;t know when farts are coming that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy well i mean i i do and i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that might be</p>
<p>the most difficult</p>
<p>thing to describe</p>
<p>ever to someone who knows exactly what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about is that feeling that you have</p>
<p>where you know the difference between</p>
<p>shit and a fart</p>
<p>i know the difference</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t always know</p>
<p>i had the problem the</p>
<p>other i think i already talked</p>
<p>about in the podcast once as a joke i was</p>
<p>in front of my</p>
<p>girlfriend i</p>
<p>put my hand there and i farted in my hand shit your</p>
<p>hand and i was like</p>
<p>excuse me i&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>right back oh wow</p>
<p>and it was like it was supposed to be as a joke</p>
<p>and she knew exactly what happened i did it in</p>
<p>front of her completely naked so hilarious</p>
<p>you shit your own hand</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you what the people who have the best</p>
<p>shooting stories in the</p>
<p>whole world or anyone who&rsquo;s ever done the</p>
<p>peace corps in africa oh no</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about oh man</p>
<p>those people i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never heard such</p>
<p>crazy things in my entire i read a horrible story on</p>
<p>mixed martial arts com</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s two forums on</p>
<p>mixed martial arts com one of them is the</p>
<p>underground</p>
<p>which is all</p>
<p>mma type stuff the other ones the other ground</p>
<p>and the other ground is like anything any subject</p>
<p>and one of the stories was</p>
<p>about this poor couple that went to africa</p>
<p>and they were in cape town they were in this really</p>
<p>nice area but the girl wanted to go see the real africa</p>
<p>oh no so that&rsquo;s the bad bad</p>
<p>phrase yeah that&rsquo;s what she did she saw the real africa</p>
<p>they went and</p>
<p>they they went into this town and they got carjacked</p>
<p>and they kicked</p>
<p>the driver and the man out of the car kept the</p>
<p>woman and then they shot her in the head</p>
<p>oh so they killed her they killed her oh well hide</p>
<p>yeah and they</p>
<p>found out that the driver was in on it</p>
<p>the driver called the head</p>
<p>and set it up</p>
<p>and that they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t supposed to</p>
<p>go if they&rsquo;re supposed to kill or not he says</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weird why</p>
<p>would they i</p>
<p>think they would</p>
<p>at least rape her</p>
<p>first well they were saying</p>
<p>at first they were saying that</p>
<p>they thought she was sexually assaulted but then they</p>
<p>kept saying that she wasn&rsquo;t sexually assaulted but that</p>
<p>could easily be they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want people to know that she was sexually assaulted</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not releasing all the information you know out</p>
<p>of respect to the girls family or something like that</p>
<p>right you know it&rsquo;s a public release i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the whole thing is fucking</p>
<p>crazy though the</p>
<p>whole thing is</p>
<p>you know that part of the world</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely wild and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think a lot of people are</p>
<p>aware of it</p>
<p>the idea that the</p>
<p>apocalypse is</p>
<p>gonna happen and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be some</p>
<p>giant event that takes place</p>
<p>like boom here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>apocalypse no</p>
<p>the apocalypse sort of</p>
<p>is us being</p>
<p>aware of how fucked up parts of this world are</p>
<p>like horrific</p>
<p>horror movie</p>
<p>john carpenter</p>
<p>zombie type shit that&rsquo;s what africa is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s parts of africa</p>
<p>like liberia</p>
<p>we talked about this on the show before</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rampant cannibalism</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this vbs</p>
<p>tv documentary the vice</p>
<p>guide to liberia</p>
<p>and it will make you shit your fucking pants yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about killing children and</p>
<p>drinking their</p>
<p>blood they kill the</p>
<p>blood of the innocent children to make them immortal</p>
<p>this creepy</p>
<p>crazy thing</p>
<p>dude that place is</p>
<p>a goddamn monster movie</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>places like that in africa there&rsquo;s this guy</p>
<p>who i&rsquo;m david</p>
<p>axe who was written a</p>
<p>he writes he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>war correspondent he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>traveled all over</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>world like basically in</p>
<p>every conflict</p>
<p>zone you can possibly imagine he has a</p>
<p>this great graphic</p>
<p>novel called war is boring</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about like going</p>
<p>these areas like that and just turning a corner</p>
<p>and having you know a jeep</p>
<p>with a machine gun</p>
<p>mounted on it coming</p>
<p>right at you and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ready to kill you and they&rsquo;re children too</p>
<p>half the time they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>16 year old kids with</p>
<p>felicia cops</p>
<p>ready to shoot you in the face</p>
<p>yeah that was the premise of that</p>
<p>the character in the</p>
<p>movie lost remember there was that one kid that was</p>
<p>he grew up to be that big</p>
<p>black preacher guy remember right echo</p>
<p>yeah echo exactly</p>
<p>when he was a kid he was</p>
<p>killing people and shit</p>
<p>speaking of loss</p>
<p>have you heard</p>
<p>you have you</p>
<p>heard of these uh</p>
<p>tones that they use uh like spies</p>
<p>and stuff all</p>
<p>right tell the kona</p>
<p>numbers project yeah what is this you guys were</p>
<p>gonna tell me</p>
<p>about right for the podcast but</p>
<p>it was one of those</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s save it let&rsquo;s save it</p>
<p>save it so what is this explain i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry well i mean as far as i know what</p>
<p>reading about it is it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>during the cold war</p>
<p>they would use short wave</p>
<p>radio stations</p>
<p>because short wave</p>
<p>radio can travel</p>
<p>all around the</p>
<p>world if you have like the</p>
<p>clouds are right and</p>
<p>everything so</p>
<p>they would send signals to</p>
<p>their spies</p>
<p>and bed in the</p>
<p>field using</p>
<p>shortware radio</p>
<p>like one time shortware</p>
<p>radio broadcasts and they&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>some sort of a code book</p>
<p>on the receiving end</p>
<p>to decipher these</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>loop it you</p>
<p>know kind of like on loss how they had that</p>
<p>transmission</p>
<p>where it was just continuously</p>
<p>looping like the numbers and</p>
<p>stuff like that so</p>
<p>somebody recorded all</p>
<p>these there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hundreds of them there&rsquo;s hundreds and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>creepiest yeah some of them</p>
<p>sound like oh they&rsquo;re an incredible</p>
<p>series you should play</p>
<p>this one here&rsquo;s one here&rsquo;s one as an example and that</p>
<p>and this is like kill the president kill the president</p>
<p>kill the president</p>
<p>you know some</p>
<p>of them are just tones and some of them have numbers</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>seven 24 yeah</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>but the iridium</p>
<p>and what is the</p>
<p>effect on the</p>
<p>human brain</p>
<p>is this supposed to do something sure</p>
<p>i listened to him the</p>
<p>other day when</p>
<p>i was kind of high and it was</p>
<p>i was having it was</p>
<p>i feel like</p>
<p>just the tones</p>
<p>vague i feel like</p>
<p>because the short wave</p>
<p>radio is like a</p>
<p>smaller frequency</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as big of a</p>
<p>frequency so it&rsquo;s something like about</p>
<p>some of the tones</p>
<p>to me they sound better there was</p>
<p>a thread that somebody put on my message</p>
<p>board about</p>
<p>wi fi affecting the growth of trees</p>
<p>did you see that</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re saying that</p>
<p>the trees that</p>
<p>are near wi fi were developing like this coating</p>
<p>like the upper layer of</p>
<p>their skin was</p>
<p>dying but then</p>
<p>other people were saying that this was like</p>
<p>one test they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t replicated</p>
<p>this you can&rsquo;t really say that it&rsquo;s from that there</p>
<p>could be other environmental factors</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s in the air around there</p>
<p>which is a very good point</p>
<p>but the idea you know that all</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>things that are flying</p>
<p>through the air around us and they&rsquo;re giving us all</p>
<p>these megabytes of information and instant mean</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re plugged into the wall</p>
<p>right now but we</p>
<p>could very easily be doing this wi fi easily</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s enough information</p>
<p>flying through the air</p>
<p>and some sort of a signal</p>
<p>that you could have a</p>
<p>video that goes through tubes and it gets to</p>
<p>right now 1500 people</p>
<p>all over the world</p>
<p>what does that do in your brain man</p>
<p>i always wonder</p>
<p>about that cause it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>where yeah i</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>radio waves</p>
<p>radio waves are</p>
<p>being bombarded</p>
<p>with them constantly</p>
<p>right and but there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>like we have no idea what the real long term</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s not killing everybody</p>
<p>quickly so we know that it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>totally the</p>
<p>worst thing ever for you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>super poison</p>
<p>but what if it&rsquo;s making us change</p>
<p>you know shaping your brain</p>
<p>i mean for real</p>
<p>right what if what if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>evolving to be able to handle all this</p>
<p>stuff you know</p>
<p>what if these</p>
<p>these signals in there what</p>
<p>if like one of the reasons why so many people are going</p>
<p>crazy is that</p>
<p>these signals are interfering with the development of</p>
<p>their brain</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s um there&rsquo;s this writer i like a lot just guy</p>
<p>james howard</p>
<p>kunsler and he um</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a he&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>urbanist writer and he also</p>
<p>writes a lot</p>
<p>about say kunsler his</p>
<p>name is related</p>
<p>to the body part</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>famous lawyer</p>
<p>the reason why i know is there was a guy</p>
<p>named george the greek</p>
<p>that i knew from new york who was a famous</p>
<p>gambler and pool hustler and</p>
<p>he used to ride horses</p>
<p>for like you know they have the</p>
<p>horse races</p>
<p>he would be in the little</p>
<p>carriage you know they have like a little</p>
<p>carriage they</p>
<p>race i don&rsquo;t know what they call that kind of racing</p>
<p>harness racing harness racing</p>
<p>thank you well he was such a crug</p>
<p>and this fucking race was so fixed</p>
<p>that he was</p>
<p>standing up trying to pull the</p>
<p>horse back because the</p>
<p>horse was trying to win</p>
<p>so he was fired</p>
<p>and they kicked him out but</p>
<p>he he had william kunsler</p>
<p>kunsler&rsquo;s taking over my case</p>
<p>these motherfuckers</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know what they got coming to them</p>
<p>i got kunsler</p>
<p>joey diaz&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>no no no no no</p>
<p>cigarettes kunsler</p>
<p>he was just what a character this guy was</p>
<p>these all these fucking</p>
<p>guys that i met in the pool halls in new york man you</p>
<p>never met people like this in your life there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gamblers people who are addicted to gambling</p>
<p>are some of the most fascinating</p>
<p>motherfuckers ever</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all just looking for that fix</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all just looking to gamble and they</p>
<p>would always want to gamble a lot of money</p>
<p>there was not</p>
<p>never like i want to i want to bet you</p>
<p>twenty dollars</p>
<p>like you fucking</p>
<p>pussy you got no hot</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s kool aid</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that shit works</p>
<p>where like your</p>
<p>brain gets more electricity if you</p>
<p>the more you bet and if you lose</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing they still</p>
<p>found out with people who are</p>
<p>gambling addicts is that</p>
<p>they get more more</p>
<p>serotonin or something in</p>
<p>their brain when you lose really</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s such a problem</p>
<p>i try so hard to fix that because it&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>reverse psychology of it</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy they get</p>
<p>serotonin but that makes</p>
<p>them feel good but gamblers don&rsquo;t feel good i guess</p>
<p>was there fucking</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not serotonin</p>
<p>maybe whatever</p>
<p>maybe dope means it&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>some brain chemical</p>
<p>to dumbly know</p>
<p>the difference</p>
<p>serotonin dopamine</p>
<p>always in them in my</p>
<p>brain is like oh</p>
<p>these are this is shit that makes you happy yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all cocktail is that</p>
<p>all i know is that it kills people</p>
<p>when people do a lot of cocaine it kills that yeah</p>
<p>oh yeah consular consular</p>
<p>fuck this guy</p>
<p>your hot pumps kool aid</p>
<p>this guy this writer</p>
<p>james our consular</p>
<p>he writes a lot about</p>
<p>like the idea of living past peak oil like</p>
<p>when society shut down because of the oils gone and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re freaking me out man</p>
<p>this is something that duncan i always</p>
<p>argue about</p>
<p>do you would</p>
<p>now i would love to hear what your take on this</p>
<p>well i mean</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s of the kurzweilian</p>
<p>all like the proto future</p>
<p>nanobots and all that</p>
<p>stuff but i think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fun to think</p>
<p>about but i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>likely that</p>
<p>none of that will happen there will be some sort of</p>
<p>huge sort of</p>
<p>apocalyptic</p>
<p>degradation and</p>
<p>shrinking of society due to</p>
<p>the nature of the lack of oil</p>
<p>was oil powers</p>
<p>everything we have</p>
<p>right so you you&rsquo;re like did you</p>
<p>watch collapse</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ve watched that yeah i</p>
<p>love that did</p>
<p>you love it</p>
<p>cause we thought that guy was a goof i mean</p>
<p>we loved it for a little</p>
<p>while but then</p>
<p>like this guy&rsquo;s a doom and gloom</p>
<p>motherfucker and he&rsquo;s pissing in his</p>
<p>garden so that he</p>
<p>can grow shit</p>
<p>like this his outlook is so retarded</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s definitely a doom and</p>
<p>gloom guy and kunsler is somewhere similar to that but</p>
<p>he also talks</p>
<p>about the whole</p>
<p>thing something called the long emergency</p>
<p>which is kind of like what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about for like</p>
<p>the apocalypse</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>like that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen over a long period of time gas is</p>
<p>gonna start to get more and more expensive</p>
<p>and less and less people are</p>
<p>gonna be able to afford certain</p>
<p>things it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna be a sort</p>
<p>of long it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen over like</p>
<p>40 50 years probably not</p>
<p>yeah long term</p>
<p>thing well you know the idea is that</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fall apart and then</p>
<p>build back up</p>
<p>again i don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the case yeah</p>
<p>man i don&rsquo;t know either don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely some</p>
<p>validity to the idea</p>
<p>of fossil fuels being a serious problem and</p>
<p>in the development of</p>
<p>technology you know there&rsquo;s a very obscure</p>
<p>theory about fossil fuels</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not actually fossil fuels yes it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>avian oil theory</p>
<p>right yeah that the</p>
<p>whole earth is</p>
<p>floating on it</p>
<p>i mean somehow or another it&rsquo;s a natural</p>
<p>product almost like the</p>
<p>blood of the</p>
<p>earth right</p>
<p>natural product of</p>
<p>of the earth</p>
<p>yeah george nori</p>
<p>thinks that but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think george nori does you</p>
<p>think you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quote him as a source</p>
<p>how dare you i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s kind of i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s bullshit</p>
<p>art bells one</p>
<p>thing you start calling</p>
<p>george nori</p>
<p>i go come on</p>
<p>dude exactly stop it with george nori he believes</p>
<p>everything well that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>yeah george norway</p>
<p>thinks the avena</p>
<p>oil theory i don&rsquo;t yeah i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s kind of bullshit because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much science that says</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fossils less and less of it and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not there&rsquo;s called diminishing returns yeah i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really researched it enough i know i</p>
<p>have this book in the library somewhere it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>black gold stranglehold and i bought it with</p>
<p>the intention of reading it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in support of this theory</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if it&rsquo;s nonsense or not i mean well that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other thing that concert talks about that</p>
<p>made me think</p>
<p>about it so you were talking</p>
<p>about how the</p>
<p>radio waves and</p>
<p>stuff like that and how</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s changing our brains but</p>
<p>he is fiction books he talks</p>
<p>about like after</p>
<p>you know years after</p>
<p>no electricity</p>
<p>and none of this</p>
<p>stuff being pumped into this weird</p>
<p>waves being pumped in the</p>
<p>atmosphere how</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of sort of like</p>
<p>magic comes</p>
<p>about because previously</p>
<p>in our lives like</p>
<p>right now we&rsquo;re being bombarded by all this imagery</p>
<p>and sound and</p>
<p>noise and just general like</p>
<p>noise through advertisements and just everything</p>
<p>and how if that all fell away then maybe</p>
<p>maybe there was some part of our</p>
<p>brain that would unlock that</p>
<p>would you know</p>
<p>bring about</p>
<p>things that i</p>
<p>guess you would consider</p>
<p>magic but maybe it&rsquo;s not magic</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s something you know</p>
<p>the idea of like telekinesis or anything like that</p>
<p>where maybe that that</p>
<p>stuff is being held back because of</p>
<p>abundance of</p>
<p>technology i</p>
<p>think that i</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>that definitely</p>
<p>you know like i bet we have if we they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t bombarded so much with all this crap</p>
<p>would have probably different</p>
<p>senses yeah</p>
<p>never be powers but you know yeah i don&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an idea</p>
<p>that before there was a real society</p>
<p>like set up the way you know</p>
<p>we have in villages or in you know and</p>
<p>the way we have in cities obviously</p>
<p>they think that before that when people were</p>
<p>hunters and gatherers they had a much more finely tuned</p>
<p>sense of the whole</p>
<p>environment around them and you know</p>
<p>shamans in the</p>
<p>in the amazon rather they&rsquo;re always talking</p>
<p>about how the</p>
<p>plants and the trees talk to them</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole way they believe that they created</p>
<p>ayahuasca the shamans tell you that the trees told them</p>
<p>how to mix all this shit together that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>is that the peruvian</p>
<p>stuff what is that</p>
<p>peru and in brazil</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the drink</p>
<p>the hallucinogenic drink</p>
<p>but i mean look if you</p>
<p>were just living only in tune with the forest you know</p>
<p>back when we were fucking</p>
<p>weirdo hunter gatherer type dudes just</p>
<p>moving around hunting and</p>
<p>sleeping in</p>
<p>tents and shit</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s very possible that we</p>
<p>would have had different</p>
<p>senses totally different like feel for</p>
<p>everything maybe yeah like there was like a</p>
<p>thing where you</p>
<p>could actually talk to animals back in the day it was</p>
<p>but it was so</p>
<p>quiet but it was so</p>
<p>quiet and just</p>
<p>a little whispered</p>
<p>but now that you don&rsquo;t even know that</p>
<p>sounds ridiculous to us now that we</p>
<p>cause we can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>but think about like the appendix</p>
<p>yeah exactly the appendix is an</p>
<p>organ that existed</p>
<p>because we were</p>
<p>breaking down like all this really porous shit</p>
<p>bone and a lot of</p>
<p>fiber to right</p>
<p>like plant serious</p>
<p>fiber yeah like fucking chewing trees</p>
<p>yeah so we had an</p>
<p>organ that was designed to process all that crap</p>
<p>we were basically eating like</p>
<p>cows you know we were eating whatever the fuck we could</p>
<p>and we had an</p>
<p>organ for that shit</p>
<p>but now we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s falling off it&rsquo;s useless</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very possible that we just forgot that we ever</p>
<p>could do that</p>
<p>that we really</p>
<p>could like tune into the woods</p>
<p>there was a guy on that i</p>
<p>wrote it down because i wanted to talk about it</p>
<p>charles carrault</p>
<p>charles carol</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the old</p>
<p>journalist yeah</p>
<p>he died not</p>
<p>that long ago yeah</p>
<p>he wrote a story</p>
<p>about some guy who</p>
<p>lived up in alaska and he</p>
<p>would go for</p>
<p>months and months at a time</p>
<p>where he didn&rsquo;t talk to any people</p>
<p>and he said</p>
<p>after he was up there for a while he</p>
<p>could read the minds of the animals</p>
<p>and then when he came into town</p>
<p>after months and</p>
<p>months living in this cabin</p>
<p>he could read the minds of people but it</p>
<p>would go away</p>
<p>after a while</p>
<p>he also smoked a lot of weed</p>
<p>my man was getting some strong</p>
<p>just eating hash off dead deer heads</p>
<p>all day oh yes</p>
<p>definitely something to that though i feel like because</p>
<p>the same way we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>i know when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about you&rsquo;re typing someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>friend&rsquo;s name and they call you kind of thing well</p>
<p>when you know when someone&rsquo;s mad</p>
<p>at you yeah</p>
<p>you feel the energy coming off someone</p>
<p>like you know like well this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>upset you know they&rsquo;re not acting like it</p>
<p>right yeah like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong nothing</p>
<p>oh what the fuck is wrong</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re just a</p>
<p>weird energy coming off of you</p>
<p>right you know we can tune into that</p>
<p>stuff if you choose to if you choose to recognize it</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we don&rsquo;t really know all the the different</p>
<p>subtleties there are in the</p>
<p>senses you know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got it narrowed down to some</p>
<p>basic ones you know but there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>other ones that are go extra</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>weird that happened</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;ve just realized late recently</p>
<p>regarding your message</p>
<p>board on the same subject</p>
<p>right for about two months</p>
<p>about a year ago</p>
<p>about two months i kept on having this</p>
<p>voice in my head that i need to make a thread that was</p>
<p>titled bad news</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t but</p>
<p>every day i was on your message</p>
<p>board be like</p>
<p>bad news what</p>
<p>why do i keep on</p>
<p>thinking i need to do that</p>
<p>and the other day i was on your message</p>
<p>board and i looked at one of the</p>
<p>sticky threads</p>
<p>and it said bad news our friend outlaw</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like i want that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy that i</p>
<p>you know that was the</p>
<p>title of the thread</p>
<p>maybe has nothing</p>
<p>to do with it but i remember there was a</p>
<p>point in my time before outlaw passed</p>
<p>that that same</p>
<p>thing kept on repeating in my head</p>
<p>the idea that i needed to make a</p>
<p>topic that said bad news</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy yeah</p>
<p>too spooky music</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all guessing as to what reality</p>
<p>truly is we really are</p>
<p>we know that the placebo</p>
<p>effect is real</p>
<p>and we know</p>
<p>that if you tell some people that hey this pill is</p>
<p>gonna cure your disease</p>
<p>things get miraculously cured we know that that happens</p>
<p>placebo is really popular with your bowels too</p>
<p>where is it yeah</p>
<p>seventy percent of</p>
<p>bowlinesses are from our placebo</p>
<p>wow like if</p>
<p>most people have</p>
<p>irritable bowel</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong with your bowels</p>
<p>wrong with your</p>
<p>brain oh i say i was</p>
<p>freaking out</p>
<p>about this or that</p>
<p>right stress</p>
<p>explains everything</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like perfectly</p>
<p>taking stress that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>tuned into the well they also say that</p>
<p>about back injuries</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of people that they</p>
<p>believe they have back pain but it&rsquo;s not really back</p>
<p>pain it&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;re suffering through incredible</p>
<p>stress and it&rsquo;s manifesting itself in back pains that</p>
<p>distracts you</p>
<p>from whatever bullshit you have in your life right</p>
<p>my back but</p>
<p>if the brain can do that</p>
<p>but it can only do that if it&rsquo;s being tricked</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a strange</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s if if</p>
<p>if you have to have utter</p>
<p>confidence in it that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;ve always said that like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot of good in</p>
<p>for religion</p>
<p>as like almost like</p>
<p>a scaffolding for your life oh yeah totally because</p>
<p>the reason why</p>
<p>they are so</p>
<p>successful and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many people that are devout and believe in</p>
<p>it is because it&rsquo;s produced positive benefits for them</p>
<p>having this in</p>
<p>just unstoppable belief</p>
<p>that there is a higher</p>
<p>power and a</p>
<p>greater good</p>
<p>and that it all works out</p>
<p>in the long run</p>
<p>because god has a plan</p>
<p>it takes a tremendous amount of pressure off you</p>
<p>it allows you to perform better that</p>
<p>confidence allows you to really achieve things</p>
<p>in a lot of people</p>
<p>that they wouldn&rsquo;t if it was all open</p>
<p>ended question yeah you also can like assign bad</p>
<p>stuff like well you know what i</p>
<p>mind control i</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving up control</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking away</p>
<p>right blame and</p>
<p>worry from a thousand</p>
<p>things you can</p>
<p>worry about and be like</p>
<p>i just follow the lord&rsquo;s</p>
<p>blessings yeah yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>though that the mind has this unlocked or untapped</p>
<p>capability to do things</p>
<p>you know to produce extreme results like</p>
<p>our brains it&rsquo;s so much of who we are as a</p>
<p>human being is a product of how we were raised in our</p>
<p>experiences</p>
<p>who the people were that around us that we imitated</p>
<p>and all the</p>
<p>things that happened to us that we</p>
<p>learned well i&rsquo;m not fucking taking my</p>
<p>pants down in</p>
<p>front of that guy</p>
<p>again you know all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>things that we</p>
<p>learn with that that that becomes</p>
<p>who we are there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>things that go into that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so strange that when you get to a certain</p>
<p>age you could be fucked up and know you&rsquo;re fucked up</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t change it</p>
<p>i see certain people that are criminals you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like fucking</p>
<p>thirty whatever they&rsquo;re in and out of jail their</p>
<p>whole life they can&rsquo;t stop they&rsquo;re just fucked up they</p>
<p>got fucked up</p>
<p>get out and they go back</p>
<p>they do a crime like</p>
<p>week after they get out for</p>
<p>20 years like well</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>everything like if you date a girl and you</p>
<p>think that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna change and</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>the program that way shouldn&rsquo;t you know you</p>
<p>what is wrong with</p>
<p>us that we don&rsquo;t know us we can always tell you what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with this</p>
<p>fucking asshole you know that&rsquo;s fucking bad</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t we don&rsquo;t know us</p>
<p>where we keep ourselves</p>
<p>from knowing us</p>
<p>so we can&rsquo;t fix our own issues</p>
<p>a lot of people for most</p>
<p>people right yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>thing that we can&rsquo;t reprogram that</p>
<p>whoever you are whatever happened to you by</p>
<p>the time you were 10 or 15 or whatever the fuck it is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust people that&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>worried about</p>
<p>crazy people you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>worried about this and violence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you sorry forever that&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>yeah you just realize it yeah i mean</p>
<p>reprogramming like</p>
<p>truly reprogramming it</p>
<p>should be like something like an option</p>
<p>it should be like</p>
<p>a button you can</p>
<p>press in your</p>
<p>brain oh i know</p>
<p>this is bullshit let me just get rid of it that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the software designer for your own kids you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re programming that</p>
<p>right now you</p>
<p>gotta give him</p>
<p>some psilocybin early</p>
<p>well you just got a program well here&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing you know they talk</p>
<p>about like terrible twos</p>
<p>i swear to god my</p>
<p>daughter is not</p>
<p>going through anything terrible she&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the reason why she&rsquo;s hilarious is</p>
<p>cause i don&rsquo;t even when she</p>
<p>screams and yells at something i</p>
<p>start making fun of her</p>
<p>this is you this is you yeah</p>
<p>and she starts</p>
<p>laughing she</p>
<p>thinks it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny cause</p>
<p>everything is fun</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>everything is and you</p>
<p>gotta know like when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tired you gotta know when they eat</p>
<p>but when when they eat but it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about nice and happiness and fun you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about that</p>
<p>and if you do that and you</p>
<p>start them off like that you know you can get a</p>
<p>happy child but that</p>
<p>might create something that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not thinking who knows look</p>
<p>you know a lot of my best friends grew up fucked up</p>
<p>like all my favorite people grew up fucked up joey</p>
<p>you me eddie</p>
<p>sorry we all grew up fucked up</p>
<p>every one of us there&rsquo;s not a duncan</p>
<p>no one has some fucking</p>
<p>you know brady bunch</p>
<p>story that they</p>
<p>can tell you</p>
<p>where everything was awesome and dad always had</p>
<p>great advice and</p>
<p>what they do</p>
<p>people are like incredibly boring too but</p>
<p>why is that fuck man</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t you just like</p>
<p>give a kid a loving life and then have them not</p>
<p>be a boring cunt</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>is it possible i mean that&rsquo;s why that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>where doctors come from or something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where you know what it is really the real</p>
<p>thing is that you don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>motivation to be</p>
<p>exceptional at anything</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re desperate</p>
<p>you know exceptional people are almost always at one</p>
<p>point in life very desperate so</p>
<p>they come up with this</p>
<p>extraordinary energy</p>
<p>to produce whatever it is whether it&rsquo;s art or</p>
<p>success in business or</p>
<p>whatever they want to do that</p>
<p>it comes from something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an extraordinary amount of entropy</p>
<p>extraordinary amount of energy that&rsquo;s moving</p>
<p>everything in that direction</p>
<p>i think i think a big part of that is that</p>
<p>in general human life for the past</p>
<p>maybe 60 or 70 years</p>
<p>has become incredibly easy</p>
<p>surviving is so fucking simple</p>
<p>that used to have more people of character</p>
<p>before because</p>
<p>life was not simple like people people died a lot</p>
<p>and for simple</p>
<p>things people that</p>
<p>women died in childbirth</p>
<p>kids died didn&rsquo;t were</p>
<p>born you know the</p>
<p>birth rate was</p>
<p>a tenth of what it is now so</p>
<p>i feel like that&rsquo;s a big part of it that&rsquo;s why you have</p>
<p>so many shitty</p>
<p>shitty boring because</p>
<p>everything is so</p>
<p>easy for them</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so simple to survive</p>
<p>it takes nothing yeah i&rsquo;ve always said</p>
<p>one of the most important</p>
<p>things for a man and i say this to anybody who has boys</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like get that kid</p>
<p>involved in</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s hard to do yeah it&rsquo;s fucking difficult</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s hard to do get that kid involved in</p>
<p>whatever it is what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrestling or karate</p>
<p>or you know kickboxing cut a hand off</p>
<p>just some some fucking</p>
<p>sport you know</p>
<p>maybe they get into</p>
<p>basketball or baseball just</p>
<p>get him into something that makes them exert themselves</p>
<p>and and get through difficult times</p>
<p>and create character</p>
<p>do something that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>difficult get that kid involved in something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna test them and challenge them</p>
<p>cause if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing sadder than when you were at the mall</p>
<p>and you see some fucking lit poor lady</p>
<p>who raised some</p>
<p>boy she probably did it on her own and she had</p>
<p>never had a</p>
<p>father around or that he didn&rsquo;t have his father around</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>loud and fucking obnoxious</p>
<p>and totally unchecked</p>
<p>shameless just totally</p>
<p>shameless this poor kid is fucked he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even know who he is look at him</p>
<p>just bouncing off the walls with all this</p>
<p>crazy energy</p>
<p>to the same people who like have cell</p>
<p>phone conversations</p>
<p>incredibly loud like in the middle of</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so blow my mind</p>
<p>how people do that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those pet peeves</p>
<p>my one of my pet peeves i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fucking handle dudes who do that shit on</p>
<p>speakerphone they</p>
<p>start talking yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s up dude what are you doing man</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re down there</p>
<p>right now man let&rsquo;s party</p>

<p>buzzer don&rsquo;t do that anymore please</p>
<p>duke nukem makes me sad cause that&rsquo;s that game that</p>
<p>never really got finished i know duke nukem forever</p>
<p>that became the</p>
<p>vaporware game of all time totally and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t they realize now it&rsquo;s gotten to the</p>
<p>point that if they actually released it</p>
<p>would probably be one of the biggest games</p>
<p>ever i thought they were doing</p>
<p>a modern day doing</p>
<p>last five years they&rsquo;ve been saying okay</p>
<p>i guess that was a lot longer than five years</p>
<p>happened like with the unreal one engine i</p>
<p>think they were using well it got to the</p>
<p>point that like last five years at least they actually</p>
<p>it seemed legit like there was like a</p>
<p>trailer for</p>
<p>a website or somebody was like a fake</p>
<p>trailer when</p>
<p>under when did it go under</p>
<p>two years ago two years ago when i that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy cause that movie i swear</p>
<p>rather that game i believe</p>
<p>was really in operation for the longest time ever</p>
<p>call of duty the new call of duty got released</p>
<p>and they had this</p>
<p>thing in the newspaper</p>
<p>when i was coming back from london i was reading it</p>
<p>that call of duty</p>
<p>made more money than avatar</p>
<p>the first day</p>
<p>yeah it sold like holy shit</p>
<p>dude it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>one of the most successful</p>
<p>entertainment</p>
<p>things of all</p>
<p>time absolutely</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the sign of the</p>
<p>apocalypse and it&rsquo;s war</p>
<p>just shoot people yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking awesome commercial to</p>
<p>the commercial to the commercial to have it has like</p>
<p>jimmy camel and kobe</p>
<p>bryant you seen that</p>
<p>people are pissed off</p>
<p>about that commercial i&rsquo;m sure they are i do not</p>
<p>understand this</p>
<p>because because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got guns people always are pissed off</p>
<p>about guns guaranteed</p>
<p>and the fact that there&rsquo;s people who are uh</p>
<p>you know willing</p>
<p>those guns who</p>
<p>would normally</p>
<p>not ever be associate</p>
<p>with that will</p>
<p>be yeah well kobe</p>
<p>kobe&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a gun</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little controller yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pissed off that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shooting no</p>
<p>no no commercial</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>in the game</p>
<p>the commercial</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so crazy yeah</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t show them actually</p>
<p>shooting anybody but it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>directly no</p>
<p>how weird is that it is</p>
<p>stupid that&rsquo;s what you can&rsquo;t show a tit</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it bizarre that that&rsquo;s like so acceptable</p>
<p>yeah i mean i mean</p>
<p>would there be accepted what if there&rsquo;s a game what</p>
<p>is like you know like</p>
<p>well what are those</p>
<p>grand theft auto games</p>
<p>and all they were</p>
<p>doing in the game was just running around and raping</p>
<p>so for the commercial they had</p>
<p>jimmy camel and kobe</p>
<p>bryant pretend to rape people</p>
<p>the people go that&rsquo;s outrageous</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s okay to kill people</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not okay to rape them</p>
<p>right well i mean</p>
<p>what what how</p>
<p>weird are we man</p>
<p>yeah what if we do you</p>
<p>think you could make a game like that</p>
<p>i think the japanese already have actually</p>
<p>a few different</p>
<p>game they have rape games and they also have</p>
<p>the last games it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny that that</p>
<p>would be we talked</p>
<p>about the sensitive</p>
<p>nature of the word rape you know before</p>
<p>some people get</p>
<p>upset about it</p>
<p>but that would be it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very interesting</p>
<p>debate like why is it okay to murder people</p>
<p>is it because it&rsquo;s so simple that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you pull the</p>
<p>trigger and then they go away</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not as</p>
<p>what is it maybe that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>maybe cause</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s finite</p>
<p>like oh a person&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>they can object to them being killed</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ve killed them did</p>
<p>you imagine how</p>
<p>crazy it would be if</p>
<p>those became</p>
<p>the most popular games here if it wasn&rsquo;t call of duty</p>
<p>it was call of dicks</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just driving around</p>
<p>just fucking everybody wanted to that was the whole</p>
<p>video game whoa</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>scary as fuck</p>
<p>and people say that&rsquo;s not possible</p>
<p>but how is that not possible i mean this</p>
<p>so those private</p>
<p>programmers i&rsquo;m sure who</p>
<p>would love who</p>
<p>are and have made something like that if that</p>
<p>became a real</p>
<p>game if somehow or another we were desensitized to a</p>
<p>point where that became a real game</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;ll be very interesting i</p>
<p>think it actually for real is though i think</p>
<p>in japan if i remember correctly</p>
<p>there was some kind of rape</p>
<p>video game jesus christ</p>
<p>and they also had games like</p>
<p>where you just</p>
<p>try to get the best upskirt shots really as</p>
<p>a game as a game oh that&rsquo;s so creepy the japanese are</p>
<p>fuckin love it there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>application on the iphone called twit</p>
<p>cast it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>broadcast like a u</p>
<p>stream thing on</p>
<p>using twitter though but</p>
<p>using on your iphone</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s japanese</p>
<p>based i believe</p>
<p>and so recently i&rsquo;ve been on there you know</p>
<p>late at night</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>bunch of hot</p>
<p>asian girls on</p>
<p>their on their webcams in their</p>
<p>house you know</p>
<p>so i will type</p>
<p>things like hey do you like america</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>yeah you should come to california</p>
<p>and then they all know how to read english though</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>second they find out that you&rsquo;re american they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>oh haha i love you haha</p>
<p>great happens i just say i love you</p>

<p>love google</p>
<p>translates my new</p>
<p>friend lately</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>how thinking</p>
<p>about going</p>

<p>could just fuck a lot of people but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bored go to this website and just</p>
<p>start checking out</p>
<p>these asian girls and use google</p>
<p>translate to you know mix it up</p>
<p>it is very strange that there&rsquo;s very specific</p>
<p>cultures like the</p>
<p>asian culture</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not varying that much i mean they have some</p>
<p>music and they have some art and they have some</p>
<p>creativity but for the most part</p>
<p>their culture is like</p>
<p>trying to figure out what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>weird and like mutating it then you know like the</p>
<p>the japanese rockabilly guys</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>these like psych</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like elvis</p>
<p>turned up a thousand percent and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weirdest hipster look ever yeah yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fascinating</p>
<p>hard juku barbies</p>
<p>what is that that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>weird fashion</p>
<p>where they i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s these japanese girls who wear makeup and</p>
<p>clothes they look</p>
<p>like dolls like</p>
<p>legitimately</p>
<p>dolls and they spend</p>
<p>hours and hours to</p>
<p>perfect this</p>
<p>crazy looking</p>
<p>that thing freak</p>
<p>freaks me out</p>
<p>i wanna go to</p>
<p>japan so bad this seems like the most</p>
<p>alien world ever yeah</p>
<p>it really does seem like the closest you can get to</p>
<p>going to another planet</p>
<p>i feel like it&rsquo;s like the closest you can get to going</p>
<p>to a second dimension of america it&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>transmuted cause</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>things over there</p>
<p>that are takeoffs of american</p>
<p>culture that like they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense to us but to them they do</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>weird like proto nostalgia that they have over</p>
<p>everything like the coffee</p>
<p>and all this like</p>
<p>all the business</p>
<p>business attire</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many fucking</p>
<p>crazy things</p>
<p>good friend of mine</p>
<p>lived over there for two years and he</p>
<p>would talk to me about</p>
<p>i have these</p>
<p>capsule hotels</p>
<p>right because</p>
<p>little tubes you</p>
<p>can sleep in</p>
<p>and have vending machines for top with</p>
<p>ties in them</p>
<p>cause if you&rsquo;re a businessman you have to go out and</p>
<p>drink with the boss</p>
<p>afterwards you have to do that and so</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking past the</p>
<p>train so you have to stay in the</p>
<p>capsule hotel</p>
<p>but to show up at work</p>
<p>tomorrow you have to have a new tie so it looks like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve had time to change and look nice so they have</p>
<p>vending machines</p>
<p>just for the tie so you can change your tie</p>
<p>before you go back into work even though you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never even been home</p>
<p>what a strange</p>
<p>strange love to go out there</p>
<p>and have sex with like a girl with tentacles and</p>
<p>everything and be</p>
<p>fine they have</p>
<p>those too i know</p>
<p>what are you talking about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like manga</p>
<p>you scared the fuck out of me</p>
<p>they make the most insane</p>
<p>electronics man</p>
<p>and some of</p>
<p>their cars they have</p>
<p>these two cars out</p>
<p>right now that are</p>
<p>two of the best</p>
<p>sports cars in the world</p>
<p>they have this nissan gt r</p>
<p>which is this incredible</p>
<p>four wheel drive nissan</p>
<p>you know i think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>500 horsepower insane 0 to 60 time insane</p>
<p>lateral acceleration it laps the nurburgring</p>
<p>in like this insanely low time</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ve got this</p>
<p>other thing this lexus lfa</p>
<p>where they just</p>
<p>they created</p>
<p>lexus created this like</p>
<p>ultimate ferrari</p>
<p>like they all the most high tech components</p>
<p>carbon fiber fenders is fucking insane</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a ferrari though</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s a lexus so</p>
<p>lexus called the lexus</p>
<p>lfa what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>basically saying is</p>
<p>their engineering is so insanely good that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy because</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t make any weapons so they put it all into</p>
<p>is that what it is you</p>
<p>think i mean</p>
<p>shit i wonder</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a real good</p>
<p>point cause i know the japanese are not allowed to make</p>
<p>anything you can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>build a samurai</p>
<p>sword in japan they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>crazy we don&rsquo;t let them have weapons</p>
<p>did you hear</p>
<p>about this north</p>
<p>south korea</p>
<p>thing yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary listen</p>
<p>man those the</p>
<p>north korean</p>
<p>south korea is like the fucking north</p>
<p>versus south</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>civil war man it&rsquo;s like the same</p>
<p>thing as us</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just on an exaggerated</p>
<p>scale right you know it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>you know a much larger</p>
<p>like and then</p>
<p>will also super</p>
<p>aggressive the</p>
<p>north korea fucking hates the south</p>
<p>they hate each</p>
<p>other so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ready to like jack each</p>
<p>other right yeah they</p>
<p>are i mean if that happens i really wonder if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be the catalyst to</p>
<p>a new world war</p>
<p>imagine you hate someone because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>literally across</p>
<p>a line and they looked exactly like you yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not there&rsquo;s no confusion</p>
<p>whatsoever it&rsquo;s like koreans are very similar looking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like america was this big fucking melting pot</p>
<p>right the koreans you know</p>
<p>and there there&rsquo;s variations on</p>
<p>both sides but they look exactly the same and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter that&rsquo;s the enemy</p>
<p>kill fucking</p>
<p>crazy world we live in man huh</p>
<p>two thousand ten and that is</p>
<p>still how we&rsquo;re rocking it</p>
<p>just hope they don&rsquo;t get in the</p>
<p>just have to get a ran involved then it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>perfect cocktail for i</p>
<p>think they have a really difficult time getting online</p>
<p>in north korea they do they they squash</p>
<p>everything it&rsquo;s like they have</p>
<p>huge internet</p>
<p>what do you call it</p>
<p>blackouts yeah i</p>
<p>think so filters</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not allowed to play starcraft or something like that</p>
<p>right well the</p>
<p>south koreans man</p>
<p>south korean gaming pro gaming in</p>
<p>south korea is so huge</p>
<p>they have like</p>
<p>these live events</p>
<p>where they have like an</p>
<p>arena filled with fucking people</p>
<p>that are watching dudes play</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>have you ever seen that channel</p>
<p>i know holy</p>
<p>fuck man they&rsquo;re playing starcraft</p>
<p>and some of</p>
<p>these korean dudes that play starcraft they</p>
<p>would make these</p>
<p>insane amount of movements in</p>
<p>a minute like a hundred and</p>
<p>thirty nine movements in a minute</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re doing like almost two a second</p>
<p>or more than two a second</p>
<p>is this a keyboard game</p>
<p>keyboard and mouse it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>one of those games</p>
<p>where like you&rsquo;re playing like you have an army</p>
<p>and you move them in certain positions</p>
<p>okay your tactical game</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a real yeah it&rsquo;s a tactical game and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super complex and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s very you know very strategy based</p>
<p>and some guys</p>
<p>are just wizards on it and they have this one dude just</p>
<p>korean dude is like this</p>
<p>ultra badass</p>
<p>starcraft wizard</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the game</p>
<p>right starcraft</p>
<p>and they had him</p>
<p>these giant big</p>
<p>screens and people were going</p>
<p>crazy when he was kicking ass</p>
<p>they were going nuts</p>
<p>head faggot it&rsquo;s so bizarre</p>
<p>i wonder why that</p>
<p>never caught on in america</p>
<p>when you think</p>
<p>about how popular games are over here</p>
<p>maybe a little</p>
<p>duty shit maybe it will</p>
<p>be something eventually starcraft&rsquo;s pretty big out here</p>
<p>it is but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that big</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t they always been</p>
<p>ahead of us with games like</p>
<p>you know have they been</p>
<p>they used to be</p>
<p>the japanese used to be</p>
<p>ahead of the games back in the</p>
<p>nintendo days but nowadays we have</p>
<p>most of the biggest</p>
<p>game makers here in the</p>

<p>and talking</p>
<p>about different</p>
<p>fighters are in the game talking</p>
<p>about like what the guys good at what the guys bad at</p>

<p>yes so cool</p>
<p>i did that one time for a friend</p>
<p>you were doing a</p>
<p>commercial and you needed someone to help out with that</p>
<p>that was so much fun yeah</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s crazy it&rsquo;s such an interesting</p>
<p>bizarre thing to do i did a</p>
<p>they did a full body scan of me too</p>
<p>where i stand there</p>
<p>and they spun around me with this</p>
<p>crazy camera</p>
<p>and then they show you this 3d</p>
<p>image of you like this computer</p>

<p>in the two thousand ten no no no no i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think so when are they</p>
<p>gonna do that i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think i would have to do</p>
<p>a lot of shit for them to do that to be an easter egg</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s not a big i mean that&rsquo;s not an easter egg</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s like a big project when you create a new</p>
<p>model and you</p>
<p>do well they</p>
<p>could just like put your head on you know you</p>
<p>should do is you get like someone like me to</p>
<p>model you so</p>
<p>be like joe rogan but be some</p>
<p>fucking idiot</p>

<p>tits dude that&rsquo;d be awesome if</p>
<p>you in a bathing</p>
<p>suit with your head on it as an easter egg</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be fucking great</p>
<p>yeah those are always the best as the easter egg</p>
<p>characters yeah if you ever want to get humbled though</p>
<p>about how much time it takes to make something</p>
<p>watch or talk to someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s working on</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s insane what we&rsquo;re</p>

<p>and we were doing</p>
<p>comedy there this</p>
<p>place called charlie good nights</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>it all got hooked up on the internet somehow or another</p>
<p>and he want us giving us a tour of his place</p>
<p>and that was</p>
<p>a pre xbox 360 and</p>
<p>they already had one</p>
<p>and they had</p>
<p>gears of war playing and we were just like</p>
<p>wow this is something that no one else has seen</p>
<p>except for like a</p>
<p>small group of people</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re used to like what</p>
<p>genesis or something</p>
<p>like that but we were used to like i</p>
<p>think nintendo</p>
<p>64 or two or</p>
<p>three was out of the yeah</p>
<p>three craig</p>
<p>three oh that&rsquo;s right doom</p>
<p>was coming out</p>
<p>because remember</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take a big shit on doom</p>
<p>right that might have been the</p>
<p>second time we were there though</p>
<p>they did i think it was we&rsquo;ve been there a few times</p>
<p>anyway he showed us</p>
<p>some models from gears of war like the animated</p>
<p>models that aren&rsquo;t in the game just to</p>
<p>show like as a</p>
<p>technology demonstration</p>
<p>and our jaws fucking hit the floor</p>
<p>like they had</p>
<p>flashlights they</p>
<p>would move flashlights across the body</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d see how the</p>
<p>shadows would vary</p>
<p>and move around</p>
<p>i was like this is insane man this is</p>
<p>now they actually have those</p>
<p>models in the games now</p>
<p>and the work they spend is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how people</p>
<p>can actually do that i feel like it&rsquo;s you have to be</p>
<p>on some sort of special drug to sit there</p>
<p>to do that kind of coding yeah</p>
<p>yeah so takes</p>
<p>forever john carmack the dude who</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the mastermind</p>
<p>behind all the it games</p>
<p>which are like doom and</p>
<p>quake and wolf and</p>
<p>all those deathmatch</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>david bowie did a lot of cool shit yeah</p>
<p>early in his career</p>
<p>the way he looked</p>
<p>he did do a lot of cool shit imagine if</p>
<p>there was a dude that used to come to the comedy store</p>
<p>and he was a regular looking dude</p>
<p>you know from the midwest and then he was out here for</p>
<p>so he had a little bit of a problem with drugs</p>
<p>and he was out here for just a</p>
<p>short amount of time and one time i ran into him at the</p>
<p>comic store i hadn&rsquo;t seen him in like shit a</p>
<p>month 30 days</p>
<p>also he had four lip</p>
<p>piercings a nose</p>
<p>piercing and an eyebrow piercing</p>
<p>and he was stretching his ears out with</p>
<p>those that shit</p>
<p>so fucking stupid</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>but it was like</p>
<p>it was like let me</p>
<p>check my face</p>
<p>like whoa like you you really just went for it yeah</p>
<p>i knew a couple guys in college</p>
<p>who were that who</p>
<p>suddenly became like</p>
<p>incredibly emo over like a six</p>
<p>month period when like</p>
<p>wait what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you you&rsquo;re the same guy</p>
<p>and sort of it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they are but they&rsquo;re not and this</p>
<p>other guy too</p>
<p>who was a comedian</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>david fucking recognize and we lost the thirty</p>
<p>pounds it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>new crazy hairstyle all this</p>
<p>stuff like you just did</p>
<p>you just totally</p>
<p>changed everything</p>
<p>that i liked</p>
<p>about the look</p>
<p>at jim brewer</p>
<p>man he was just at flappers the</p>
<p>other day by</p>
<p>the way he said was like his favorite new club ever</p>
<p>yeah but anyways he was</p>
<p>known as the</p>
<p>marijuana guy the pot guy that&rsquo;s all he talks about</p>
<p>now super clean</p>
<p>super religious i</p>
<p>think or something i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>his wife was a christian i</p>
<p>think he just</p>
<p>jump right in</p>
<p>really i guess</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s changing your</p>
<p>whole audience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not your that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not college kids anymore that&rsquo;s like my mom&rsquo;s well you</p>
<p>could look at it that way or you</p>
<p>could look at it and say</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s developing a new audience because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>evolving and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>evolving with him and</p>
<p>maybe some of them will come</p>
<p>along with them and</p>
<p>you said devolving right</p>
<p>evolving changing</p>
<p>in his eyes i&rsquo;m not saying you know</p>
<p>look you know it&rsquo;s like we talked</p>
<p>about before</p>
<p>about religion being</p>
<p>sort of like a good scaffolding for living a happy life</p>
<p>we have to address</p>
<p>the fact that comedians a lot of them a</p>
<p>giant percentage of them are miserable as fuck</p>
<p>right and a lot of them wind up</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>dying and being terrible</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all ran into</p>
<p>comics that we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen a long time we see when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>older now and they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>super super bitter and it&rsquo;s sad yeah</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a fucking terrible terrible</p>
<p>thing when a lot of dudes</p>
<p>when they they get older in</p>
<p>their life and they have children they have a family</p>
<p>like they wanna they</p>
<p>wanna think different man they</p>
<p>wanna be a little bit more</p>
<p>happy they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna be morose</p>
<p>and cynical</p>
<p>about everything</p>
<p>you just picked your finger up like</p>
<p>do you oh i just thought of something i was gonna do a</p>
<p>video of a morose</p>
<p>and cynical guy no but you were talking</p>
<p>about the comics you know</p>
<p>getting angry</p>
<p>do that all the time</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s somebody the</p>
<p>other day and i</p>
<p>think i can</p>
<p>say that story</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>story no no</p>
<p>you tell and i&rsquo;ll say if it was the</p>
<p>story that i</p>
<p>think it was your</p>
<p>job okay yeah this involves a</p>
<p>comic that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>older that has become a</p>
<p>complete asshole i don&rsquo;t know if he was an asshole the</p>
<p>whole time what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking gallagher</p>
<p>he was making fun of this guy that works at the comedy</p>
<p>store that has</p>
<p>multiple sclerosis he walks</p>
<p>funny and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like fucking making fun of him to his face</p>
<p>about how he&rsquo;s walking and then</p>
<p>the club owners and all the</p>
<p>staffs like</p>
<p>dude stop that&rsquo;s not cool at all and he was</p>
<p>and he wouldn&rsquo;t stop he was at the real</p>
<p>going and going</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s the real one</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t his brother that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>were you there i was there yeah did</p>
<p>you video it</p>
<p>no i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>video i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna get banned from the comedy</p>
<p>story anymore so i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t film there anymore but</p>
<p>you could talk</p>
<p>about any of the</p>
<p>comics people were twittering it like comedy i</p>
<p>think i mean</p>
<p>everybody saw it</p>
<p>and it was i had an</p>
<p>experience with gallagher myself when i was in high</p>
<p>school the freshman of high</p>
<p>school i went to see gallagher</p>
<p>this is in rochester minnesota so you know shows</p>
<p>where he was at that</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>rogers tiny town and he</p>
<p>went to a show to a</p>
<p>gallagher show</p>
<p>as in the front row</p>
<p>i was like this is</p>
<p>gonna be so awesome and</p>
<p>he asked for a volunteer he</p>
<p>brings me up and i was like yeah yeah i won&rsquo;t be on</p>
<p>school on stage</p>
<p>brings up stage and he puts me on this</p>
<p>shot this wooden</p>
<p>chopping block</p>
<p>and like makes fun of me for like</p>
<p>three four or five minutes just</p>
<p>saying mean</p>
<p>things to me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like you know i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna smile like okay</p>
<p>i have my hands my pockets like</p>
<p>why do you have your hands in your pockets huh</p>
<p>you must not have a girlfriend</p>
<p>is the audience</p>
<p>laughing at this i don&rsquo;t even remember really</p>
<p>but i guess a little bit</p>
<p>and i was like you know</p>
<p>i had a baggy</p>
<p>skills a skateboard</p>
<p>the times of course have my bag how old how old again</p>
<p>was probably</p>
<p>fifteen and</p>
<p>you know i look like i was 10 though</p>
<p>he was shitting on you when you were 15</p>
<p>yeah and i was</p>
<p>up there i look like i was 10 years old though</p>
<p>cause i looked really</p>
<p>young right and i had like my baggy</p>
<p>skateboard jeans on so you must be the best</p>
<p>skateboarder in the</p>
<p>world i don&rsquo;t see any holes in</p>
<p>those jeans</p>
<p>just it was just ridiculous</p>
<p>and then he had we</p>
<p>did a bunch of</p>
<p>stuff like putting on his penguin</p>
<p>thing sliding across the</p>
<p>stage and that was fun but the</p>
<p>like why you</p>
<p>you bring up like a</p>
<p>some dude can make you</p>
<p>know that well</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>for some comedians and for a lot of comedians back in</p>
<p>those days like</p>
<p>insulting people</p>
<p>was like thought of as like it&rsquo;s part of the show</p>
<p>right and you have to just</p>
<p>kind of take it dude i talked i talked to davey that</p>
<p>night though the guy with multiple</p>
<p>scores he was</p>
<p>about to quit his job and just</p>
<p>start fighting this guy i mean you</p>
<p>could tell by talking to him how</p>
<p>upset he was he was walking around</p>
<p>i mean i got to the</p>
<p>point where i just</p>
<p>started following davey around just to</p>
<p>grab him if he was to go to attack</p>
<p>gallagher make fun</p>
<p>of a guy with a horrible disease like that oh and he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t stop and he said something about like</p>
<p>as one of the</p>
<p>semi quotes he said something</p>
<p>about his hands like oh his hands probably aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>strong because he has multiple sclerosis</p>
<p>so he can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he actually said multiple</p>
<p>sclerosis yeah jeez</p>
<p>one thing if you just sort of like being</p>
<p>generic but beings very specific like i&rsquo;m specifically</p>
<p>making fun of you because you have multiple</p>
<p>and he wouldn&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>was there anyone else laughing</p>
<p>huh no one was</p>
<p>laughing no one was</p>
<p>laughing no it was</p>
<p>awful and i talked to somebody that used to</p>
<p>tour with him or something like that</p>
<p>and he was like</p>
<p>dude he&rsquo;s always been a fucking asshole he&rsquo;s a complete</p>
<p>jersey whoa</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>never thought gallagher</p>
<p>you know because you only see him from like old hbo</p>
<p>specials or whatever</p>
<p>you just seem as like this</p>
<p>happy guy that</p>
<p>crushes whatever</p>
<p>watermelons but now yeah well</p>
<p>the behind the</p>
<p>scenes of gallagher&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>wonder if he was always like that i was just</p>
<p>becoming one</p>
<p>probably a little bit of both</p>
<p>cause i think his brother</p>
<p>now does his</p>
<p>stuff he didn&rsquo;t do it for a</p>
<p>while for like</p>
<p>seven or years well his</p>
<p>brother like bought the act for a</p>
<p>while because</p>
<p>gallagher quit</p>
<p>does it yeah</p>
<p>and then the problem is the brother really that was his</p>
<p>way to make a living he was calling himself gallagher 2</p>
<p>right it was to</p>
<p>comics it was just too beautiful to be real</p>
<p>right it was like you know</p>
<p>everybody like to make fun of gallagher in the first</p>
<p>place and now you find out his fucking brother has</p>
<p>taken over his act like holy shit</p>
<p>and his brother looks really similar</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>like mistakeably</p>
<p>similar right</p>
<p>yeah he looks yeah</p>
<p>close enough if you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t like a huge gallagher fan</p>
<p>and you saw</p>
<p>him you&rsquo;d go well if something looks different</p>
<p>about him but yeah i</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>them dyes their hair in one</p>
<p>dozen is that what it is yeah</p>
<p>is this the</p>
<p>story you thought i was gonna say</p>
<p>oh no i thought you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something about</p>
<p>john mayer or something</p>
<p>like that oh yeah john mayer was there a couple days</p>
<p>later and i saw john mayer do comedy</p>
<p>twice did you try to</p>
<p>smell his fingers</p>
<p>no no but i met him and i</p>
<p>shake his hand</p>
<p>i john mayer</p>
<p>if i shake his hand i&rsquo;d have to go and miss my finger</p>
<p>no no i tried to suck his</p>
<p>power out when he</p>
<p>shook my hand</p>
<p>but then he</p>
<p>sucked he shook my hand</p>
<p>again so he took the</p>
<p>power back but i was</p>
<p>thinking that when i was</p>
<p>shaking his</p>
<p>pussy power</p>
<p>like i was thinking</p>
<p>like when i was shaking his hands like i&rsquo;m getting his</p>
<p>energies i&rsquo;m getting his energy i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>stealing his soul</p>
<p>sands you watch</p>
<p>too many movies but then he</p>
<p>shook it back and took it back i</p>
<p>bet he&rsquo;s a handsome man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re handsome man too</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on your well well it was interesting that we</p>
<p>we he by the way invite him on the podcast and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s you know said if he was a fan of you and he</p>
<p>said give him props and</p>
<p>stuff but he</p>
<p>actually did a pretty good job a good writing</p>
<p>but you know your</p>
<p>stage presence and timing and stuff is</p>
<p>completely not he&rsquo;s so handsome and he gets so much top</p>
<p>shelf pussy i bet he&rsquo;s so like</p>
<p>self conscious when he&rsquo;s up there that people must</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s a dick</p>
<p>you know what i mean like probably</p>
<p>yeah he probably gets this</p>
<p>weird thing</p>

<p>think also has something to do with him getting in</p>
<p>trouble with twitter</p>
<p>and then having</p>
<p>him he just canceled his account was 2 million people</p>
<p>and he was always kind of</p>
<p>funny on twitter</p>
<p>but it probably had something to do with</p>
<p>his pr guys like</p>
<p>alright you just said the most dumbest shit in the</p>
<p>world you gotta get into comedy</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s acceptable</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>to rebuild your career you have to be a</p>
<p>comic because he just made fun of a bunch of</p>
<p>women or something like that</p>
<p>right what was whatever that was that he got in</p>
<p>trouble for i don&rsquo;t remember what he said it was</p>
<p>something kind of dickish to</p>
<p>women or something</p>
<p>i think i&rsquo;m a comic</p>
<p>he also did well that was the</p>
<p>other problems he did his interview</p>
<p>where he started talking</p>
<p>about girls and banged</p>
<p>and he felt real bad</p>
<p>about it because i remember he got on</p>
<p>stage and he</p>
<p>issued this apology</p>
<p>he was being really</p>
<p>self critical</p>
<p>and you know it was it</p>
<p>was kind of interesting you know see him up there like</p>
<p>for obviously he like it</p>
<p>really thought</p>
<p>this out and he&rsquo;s really kind of like you know</p>
<p>self deprecating when he was on</p>
<p>stage kind of explaining</p>
<p>how he fucked up and</p>
<p>it was not his intention and</p>
<p>just trying to give people some good shit</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying he was cool</p>
<p>man the conversation i had with him zero ego zero just</p>
<p>just down to</p>
<p>earth nice guy probably</p>
<p>tired he probably fucked everyone that day yeah</p>
<p>probably no loads left of his body</p>
<p>right he just let me go to the comedy</p>
<p>store and just see</p>
<p>plot my next move</p>
<p>i saw steve</p>
<p>doing comedy too recently</p>
<p>yeah me too</p>
<p>and he actually did better</p>
<p>that steven</p>
<p>did better than john mayer</p>
<p>steve i&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s been doing it for a</p>
<p>while now right</p>
<p>i think dan cook has been like sort of</p>
<p>yeah taking</p>
<p>steve on the road yeah we&rsquo;re no no road</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>like that yeah</p>
<p>but no he seemed very likable on</p>
<p>stage steve oh</p>
<p>nice being himself is being</p>
<p>the guy from jackass just without the all the drugs and</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s totally</p>
<p>clean now huh</p>
<p>totally he&rsquo;s even a</p>
<p>vegan oh but he</p>
<p>still you know still</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another guy you can&rsquo;t be that guy if</p>
<p>mommy raised you</p>
<p>right you know if</p>
<p>everything went well you can&rsquo;t be that guy</p>
<p>or maybe maybe his</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s the product of like</p>
<p>could be breastfeeding till five or something</p>
<p>like that who knows</p>
<p>right too much love</p>
<p>is fighting</p>
<p>it back with</p>
<p>fucking broken</p>
<p>dude that shit like</p>
<p>balls injuring himself</p>
<p>broken light bulbs across the tongue</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t seen that i&rsquo;ve seen yes</p>
<p>a lot of them that are</p>
<p>i think i&rsquo;ve seen enough</p>
<p>he was one of</p>
<p>those people when i met him was like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s steve o</p>
<p>how weird you</p>
<p>know every now</p>
<p>and then you do</p>
<p>one of these</p>
<p>spike things</p>
<p>like i did this</p>
<p>spike tv thing it was like one of</p>
<p>those awards like guys choice awards</p>
<p>and it was kinda interesting but</p>
<p>the problem was</p>
<p>i had to do stand up</p>
<p>and they had i</p>
<p>think tracy</p>
<p>morgan was the host of it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pretty sure</p>
<p>tracy morgan was host of it and</p>
<p>what they did was they had bands play like they had</p>
<p>zz top play</p>
<p>but they had them play</p>
<p>more than once</p>
<p>it was a live audience so they</p>
<p>played the song they didn&rsquo;t like it so they played it</p>
<p>again because it wasn&rsquo;t live on</p>
<p>television it was to tape</p>
<p>whenever something was not live on</p>
<p>television they</p>
<p>beat the fuck out of that poor audience</p>
<p>and then you got to go up there and do</p>
<p>stand up and it was ugly i just</p>
<p>did not have an interesting</p>
<p>set so i wanted to get the fuck out of there but it was</p>
<p>it was a weird</p>
<p>experience being around all</p>
<p>these celebrities like</p>
<p>everywhere i looked like well that&rsquo;s that kat von d</p>
<p>chip and this is that guy</p>
<p>you celebra</p>
<p>deed yeah that shit&rsquo;s always weird</p>
<p>but it makes it interesting</p>
<p>like the other day i</p>
<p>went out with</p>
<p>dana dirman</p>
<p>the porn star girl we went to go do karaoke</p>
<p>and this guy gets on</p>
<p>stage it looked he was</p>
<p>dressed up like a mexican</p>
<p>doing 50 cent songs</p>
<p>next thing you know it was fucking 50 cent like i</p>
<p>guess they&rsquo;re doing that show what they did with jewel</p>
<p>undercover karaoke</p>
<p>or whatever it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>where they just have the girl like</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>going to karaoke bars and</p>
<p>stuff and sing</p>
<p>their own shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>jewel was doing</p>
<p>yeah she was doing it for a show she was doing it for</p>
<p>funny or die but i think that</p>
<p>video became so popular that like</p>
<p>mtv or tvs ordered a</p>
<p>pilot for this new one and</p>
<p>but yeah so the next</p>
<p>thing i know i&rsquo;m fucking seeing 50 cent</p>
<p>horribly do his own</p>
<p>music on stably</p>
<p>awful it got so bad</p>
<p>it got so bad</p>
<p>that me and my friend</p>
<p>afterwards they</p>
<p>interviewed us i hope they use it because</p>
<p>afterwards they interviewed us and my friends like</p>
<p>it was okay i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>dude tell him the truth</p>
<p>alright well so this dude</p>
<p>looked like he was mexican went on stage and</p>
<p>he did 50 cent songs that was 50 cent</p>
<p>and he just couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even sing his own song he forgot his own lyrics</p>
<p>and blah blah blah and i&rsquo;m like wow</p>
<p>and so then 10 minutes</p>
<p>later they put 50 back on</p>
<p>stage and i didn&rsquo;t know if it had anything to do with</p>
<p>johnny or a friend saying that</p>
<p>but they redid it</p>
<p>you know they tved</p>
<p>of doing it</p>
<p>and it was a little</p>
<p>bit better actually have it on my youtube channel so</p>
<p>i got a red ban on youtube</p>
<p>are you supposed to be youtubers is totally illegal hey</p>
<p>you know it was from my</p>
<p>phone i i were</p>
<p>there yeah i was there</p>
<p>no they stopped you from doing that right</p>
<p>right they didn&rsquo;t tell you there was a million people</p>
<p>yeah you tell me with</p>
<p>their phones</p>
<p>yeah with their</p>
<p>phones releases up they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have releases up they always at this</p>
<p>dimples bar</p>
<p>cause they actually film there it&rsquo;s across the</p>
<p>street from all the</p>
<p>studios there&rsquo;s always shit</p>
<p>going on there so</p>
<p>you walk in and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>molded on the wall what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like wait a minute</p>
<p>permanent release</p>
<p>yes so if you go there you&rsquo;re just an attention whore</p>
<p>absolutely where they film</p>
<p>every single person that goes on stage</p>
<p>and then what&rsquo;s cool is if it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>first time there they&rsquo;ll burn you a dvd for free</p>
<p>and take a photo who owns it</p>
<p>uh probably the</p>
<p>studios because you go in there and you see</p>
<p>they just playing</p>
<p>videos of all</p>
<p>the celebrities that have ever gone in there like on</p>
<p>their days off doing karaoke</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even realize that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re recording and saving all this shit</p>
<p>wow so they have some pretty interesting</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>funny thing</p>
<p>about karaoke</p>
<p>right you go</p>
<p>up there and you nail it if you got a really good</p>
<p>voice you&rsquo;re a badass but</p>
<p>if you if you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>trying now you&rsquo;re failing yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the worst</p>
<p>yeah terrible to</p>

<p>later that night</p>
<p>at the 50 cent night</p>
<p>we went to tell</p>
<p>you your pals with dana</p>
<p>de armon from the</p>
<p>nasty show from sam tripoli show i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>yeah i met her</p>
<p>briefly there fucking</p>
<p>funny dude she is hilarious she says some</p>
<p>funny shit man</p>
<p>she wrote a</p>
<p>tweet once on twitter</p>
<p>it said question what was the craziest</p>
<p>thing i ever had up my ass answer cat toys</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny is she is like her biggest turn on is</p>
<p>transsexuals</p>
<p>wow and i was like dude i&rsquo;m the biggest</p>
<p>pussy and i have a dick</p>
<p>does that count</p>
<p>but no no but</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s one of the best hecklers too like i will</p>
<p>never take her</p>
<p>to one of your shows because she has this whole</p>
<p>thing where she</p>
<p>if somebody sucks</p>
<p>she will let them know they suck</p>
<p>she did that to mike</p>
<p>young right well</p>
<p>to be fair mike</p>
<p>young it was really like 2 am but mike</p>
<p>young got thrown on</p>
<p>stage he didn&rsquo;t even know what was</p>
<p>going on there and he was kind of like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe he had had a long</p>
<p>night or whatever</p>
<p>but she went</p>
<p>right into him</p>
<p>and then it got to the</p>
<p>point where he was just like mike&rsquo;s a pimp</p>
<p>so mike brings out</p>
<p>just this girl of his whip because he couldn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>fight the heckle i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think so he brought out a girl</p>
<p>brought out the</p>
<p>you know how he&rsquo;s always there with a girl</p>
<p>you know so he brought his girl on</p>
<p>stage and talk</p>
<p>blocking him</p>
<p>right now no no no no</p>
<p>i mean like friends and his</p>
<p>pals his pals and so then like he just kind of like his</p>
<p>that act turned in it just showing the girls legs and</p>
<p>stuff on stage</p>
<p>oh okay so he stopped trying with the comedy</p>
<p>and respond to her heckles yeah</p>
<p>i think he tried</p>
<p>see the promise</p>
<p>like she was like bragging all</p>
<p>about like i</p>
<p>know i know</p>
<p>the next problem is is that she was doing this heckle</p>
<p>thing at karaoke</p>
<p>bar to so when</p>
<p>people didn&rsquo;t know the song are like she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>why did you</p>
<p>pick the song if you don&rsquo;t know how to do it</p>
<p>and she was making me nervous</p>
<p>so i kind of got nervous when she was in the comedy</p>
<p>store cause i didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>anyone to get mad at me cause i</p>
<p>was there with her</p>
<p>so i kind of like hid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious man that</p>
<p>bitch is crazy who&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>this dana de armond this porno</p>
<p>started was</p>
<p>heckling have you</p>
<p>heard of her</p>
<p>yeah she does that</p>
<p>nasty show all the time yeah she&rsquo;s like she likes to do</p>
<p>stage stuff like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry the</p>
<p>naughty show it&rsquo;s called the naughty</p>
<p>show she does</p>
<p>stage show i mean she actually does like</p>
<p>stuff outside of porn i did some show with her at</p>
<p>ucb a long time ago</p>
<p>she was one of</p>
<p>those celebrity</p>
<p>or panelist</p>
<p>judges sort of</p>
<p>thing so yeah</p>
<p>well i think was</p>
<p>judge for like the dirtiest</p>
<p>sketch show actually is what it was</p>
<p>so she was on the</p>
<p>panel but i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard a bunch of</p>
<p>different things</p>
<p>about her doing</p>
<p>stuff within the comedy realm</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that a</p>
<p>funny that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>funny combination</p>
<p>the stripper</p>
<p>slash porn star</p>
<p>slash yeah you know and then comedians</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weird it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>weird that what&rsquo;s the girl um</p>
<p>sasha gray who&rsquo;s now like</p>
<p>an actress and</p>
<p>stuff where well she&rsquo;s very smart man</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s really interesting listen to that girl talk</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t know what her deal is</p>
<p>yeah but she has like all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>videos online</p>
<p>sasha grey on sasha</p>
<p>grey it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like whatever she</p>
<p>is i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck happened to her i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what her deal is but whatever she is that&rsquo;s her</p>
<p>like she&rsquo;s very she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right i mean i feel like she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s interesting because she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the typical porn star i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched those i don&rsquo;t feel like i&rsquo;m getting anything</p>
<p>enlightening</p>
<p>out of it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely interesting that she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fit the mold</p>
<p>kind of it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>weird to me</p>
<p>when one person transcends out of a business</p>
<p>you know when like all the</p>
<p>sudden there&rsquo;s this one guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>known as this incredible bowler</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>i mean like who&rsquo;s the best pool</p>
<p>player ever you ask the average person minnesota fats i</p>
<p>heard minnesota</p>
<p>fats is amazing</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a person who somehow another becomes more</p>
<p>famous than everybody else and</p>
<p>becomes that</p>
<p>sport or that game like a</p>
<p>lance armstrong</p>
<p>name me one</p>
<p>other fucking guy races bikes</p>
<p>right lloyd</p>
<p>floyd landis is only one i know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>he know who that guy is he won but he got his</p>
<p>thing taken no</p>
<p>title taken away from doping</p>
<p>well dude we have a friend who was a professional</p>
<p>cyclist who</p>
<p>teaches jiu jitsu now</p>
<p>and he tells me everyone&rsquo;s on it</p>
<p>well that and</p>
<p>the thing that he got busted for</p>
<p>which i think is</p>
<p>total bullshit is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something about</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not allowed to oxygenate their</p>
<p>blood they do this</p>
<p>weird thing where they</p>
<p>train at altitude</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll take</p>
<p>their own blood</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>blood doping yeah they</p>
<p>insert it back in</p>
<p>their body how</p>
<p>come you can&rsquo;t do that that seems like</p>
<p>that seems ridiculous to me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your own goddamn blood</p>
<p>and it also</p>
<p>gives you an</p>
<p>unfair advantage the ideas are supposed</p>
<p>to all be on a</p>
<p>level playing</p>
<p>field but i</p>
<p>see your point</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>blood yeah you</p>
<p>should be able to do whatever you want</p>
<p>but they also have that epo</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s okay what</p>
<p>he told me they all take it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>hyperbrecht chamber</p>
<p>effect no no</p>
<p>no epo is a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some sort of a chemical</p>
<p>agent some sort of a drug you take it</p>
<p>and what it does is it makes you produce more red</p>
<p>blood cells so your</p>
<p>body produce</p>
<p>the same effect as</p>
<p>us just like living</p>
<p>in attitude yeah</p>
<p>and apparently a lot of like real</p>
<p>heavy hardcore endurance people use it because</p>
<p>it produces more</p>
<p>blood cells isn&rsquo;t that how they</p>
<p>test for it the only way to test for it is to take your</p>
<p>blood before</p>
<p>like they have a constant no i don&rsquo;t think so</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a test i</p>
<p>think epo shows up i</p>
<p>think it does</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a bad substance</p>
<p>and you know i think</p>
<p>it hasn&rsquo;t always shown up there was like a long time</p>
<p>where they weren&rsquo;t testing for it</p>
<p>but i think they&rsquo;ve also</p>
<p>retroactively tested people gone</p>
<p>back tested</p>
<p>samples that they still</p>
<p>kept and caught people</p>
<p>using it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a bunch of shit that they take man i wonder what</p>
<p>would happen if i took</p>
<p>that like i</p>
<p>would get like</p>
<p>it gets you</p>
<p>high by any means you know or if it just makes you feel</p>
<p>like amazing energy powerful</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you when i was living in the mountains</p>
<p>when i was at eighty five hundred feet</p>
<p>above sea level</p>
<p>i was there for</p>
<p>a couple of</p>
<p>months and i did a gig in philly</p>
<p>i was in philly for like</p>
<p>three days in a row</p>
<p>and dude i felt like a fucking superman really</p>
<p>it was crazy</p>
<p>cause i just gone from the mountains to</p>
<p>to the water</p>
<p>to sea level</p>
<p>i was at the gym working out</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t believe how much energy i had</p>
<p>it was crazy</p>
<p>i was telling my friends like dude i feel like i can</p>
<p>throw these fucking weights</p>
<p>like you just feel like you have so much more</p>
<p>vibrancy to your body because you have all this</p>
<p>extra blood</p>
<p>but then it probably also can give you</p>
<p>strokes and shit to me yeah</p>
<p>yeah epo can at</p>
<p>least same with</p>
<p>i took some oxygen once</p>
<p>in the desert because i was like</p>
<p>it was super hot we were</p>
<p>shooting and i thought i was</p>
<p>gonna pass out</p>
<p>wow took a bunch of oxygen and</p>
<p>i felt like a</p>
<p>10 000 times better after that</p>
<p>i was thinking</p>
<p>about getting a mask just</p>
<p>yeah just pure oxygen</p>
<p>at like i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>for i came with the rate is</p>
<p>you have that oxygen</p>
<p>scrub or we</p>
<p>should just</p>
<p>start sucking on</p>
<p>that stuff is</p>
<p>great gets you</p>
<p>have it there but the promise it&rsquo;s not a uniform sound</p>
<p>it goes like this</p>
<p>some of the</p>
<p>hotels that when we stayed in seattle last time we</p>
<p>had oxygen had oxygen</p>
<p>in the bathroom remember that there was like shampoo</p>
<p>soaps and oxygen</p>
<p>like a container</p>
<p>really your mouth yeah</p>
<p>that stuff is great i really</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the best thing i</p>
<p>tried like hell to get an oxygen tank at home but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weirdly there&rsquo;s a lot of red tape you</p>
<p>have to have a prescription for</p>
<p>yeah for oxygen it can explode</p>
<p>everyone it could turn you into</p>
<p>a fucking that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>but i just want a little tank just a little</p>
<p>tank you know when i&rsquo;m hungover and want to watch tv</p>
<p>well hypobaric chambers</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always thought that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>too and you</p>
<p>know some people use</p>
<p>those to heal</p>
<p>like uriah faber who&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>mma fighter</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s famous for using this</p>
<p>hyperbaric chamber</p>
<p>michael jackson had one</p>
<p>too exactly</p>
<p>apparently you get in there and you</p>
<p>can go in there for like a couple</p>
<p>hours and you feel like you got 10 hour</p>
<p>sleep you feel fucking fantastic</p>
<p>when you come out of there you feel all refreshed</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>seems like a good i</p>
<p>think a good</p>
<p>thing to have</p>
<p>though because if it does that if it makes you heal</p>
<p>quicker from injuries</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to make you heal</p>
<p>quicker from life</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>a day do you mean do you have to necessarily be in the</p>
<p>chamber can&rsquo;t you just have like a bed that had oxygen</p>
<p>flowing on your face when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sleeping i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know exactly what a</p>
<p>hyperbaric does</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not exactly sure what it does</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pretty sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot more complicated than that it increases</p>
<p>the pressure i</p>
<p>think is what it is right</p>
<p>increases the barometric pressure</p>
<p>yeah so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically like being</p>
<p>underwater but</p>
<p>without being</p>
<p>underwater i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how it works</p>
<p>but what it does is it assists in healing</p>
<p>remember that when michael jackson was</p>
<p>told about how</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the craziest</p>
<p>motherfucker in the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ignorance</p>
<p>right there i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>wait a second it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>oxygen it&rsquo;s actually probably pretty good it is kind of</p>
<p>spacey though you know it&rsquo;s very fucking</p>
<p>alien like the</p>
<p>image of him</p>
<p>climbing into this tube like some fucking starchild a</p>
<p>bunch of babies around him</p>
<p>monkeys the oxygen</p>
<p>babies fucking</p>
<p>amusement park ride</p>
<p>shit those are just my oxygen</p>
<p>babies when i talk</p>
<p>about the isolation</p>
<p>tank that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>cause you done</p>
<p>that brings it up yeah yeah i</p>
<p>wanna do that so bad and when people</p>
<p>bring it up the first</p>
<p>thing they say is oh is that like that michael jackson</p>
<p>thing michael jackson</p>
<p>you have one of</p>
<p>those chambers in your house</p>
<p>i have one i have one in my</p>
<p>house you have a</p>
<p>water one or something yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s so incredible you</p>
<p>should do it man</p>
<p>where do you</p>
<p>know what part of hollywood you live i live</p>
<p>live downtown</p>
<p>you live downtown yeah</p>
<p>well you can go to venice</p>
<p>venice has a</p>
<p>great one it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>float lab yeah he</p>
<p>just contacted me and offered</p>
<p>me anytime i wanted to</p>
<p>float lab guy</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s great this guy</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a fucking scientific</p>
<p>genius evil</p>
<p>do that evil genius</p>
<p>crazy man isn&rsquo;t like it almost like a</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experience like</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about it on the podcast</p>
<p>so many times i can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>cover it anymore got it</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>what it is it&rsquo;s what what happens is your body produces</p>
<p>you know your your</p>
<p>brain becomes untethered from your body your body</p>
<p>has no sensory</p>
<p>input and you just</p>
<p>starts having</p>
<p>these psychedelic images</p>
<p>streams and</p>
<p>gets really</p>
<p>tripping cool</p>
<p>yeah but and</p>
<p>by the just</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating and</p>
<p>everything but just for the</p>
<p>relaxation of it</p>
<p>you walk out</p>
<p>of there you feel so good it&rsquo;s like all the</p>
<p>strain it&rsquo;s been removed</p>
<p>from your muscles you know it&rsquo;s an amazing feeling</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>we keep talking</p>
<p>about doing on the podcast</p>
<p>but nobody ever you</p>
<p>should do a podcast inside an isolation yeah</p>
<p>we thought about doing that but that</p>
<p>would be defend</p>
<p>the whole put</p>
<p>a record yeah</p>
<p>the whole purpose of the</p>
<p>thing is that you&rsquo;re not supposed to make any</p>
<p>or talk any or you know do not</p>
<p>sounds you supposed to just</p>
<p>empty you disappear i</p>
<p>think the best</p>
<p>podcast is we all eat mushrooms a half hour before we</p>
<p>started do do</p>
<p>and then saw it coming on</p>
<p>right and then</p>
<p>right when we get to the panic mode</p>
<p>sorry we gotta go</p>
<p>hit the kills</p>
<p>the only problem with that is you</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t really you couldn&rsquo;t a announce that you were</p>
<p>gonna do it you couldn&rsquo;t say that you were doing it</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the podcast</p>
<p>yep it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>tricky man because</p>
<p>somebody wanted to go</p>
<p>after you and say you&rsquo;re doing something we would just</p>
<p>do it not tell anybody</p>
<p>and it would be the fucking</p>
<p>weirdest podcast ever</p>
<p>the mushrooms</p>
<p>are not california</p>
<p>california has like the</p>
<p>worst mushroom laws in the country</p>
<p>do they really they do you can</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s they have their</p>
<p>every aspect of</p>
<p>psychedelic mushrooms are illegal</p>
<p>in california and florida really</p>
<p>florida it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the opposite you can do whatever you want with</p>
<p>basically you</p>
<p>can grow them</p>
<p>you can you can have them picked and dry and</p>
<p>everything but</p>
<p>really yeah you can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>order you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>order some it</p>
<p>was a federal</p>
<p>issue though</p>
<p>it is but somehow it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>state thing as well i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>think marijuana</p>
<p>it breaks down yeah but there&rsquo;s no really it</p>
<p>should be but there&rsquo;s no prescription</p>
<p>psychedelics</p>
<p>i mean they</p>
<p>should definitely</p>
<p>be prescribing mushrooms there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these studies that have come out and talked about</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one that</p>
<p>just someone who was talking</p>
<p>about it yesterday</p>
<p>about how psychedelic drugs psilocybin</p>
<p>lsd and even mdma</p>
<p>are they actually in improve people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>psychological state yes</p>
<p>sos i&rsquo;ve been is a</p>
<p>great great</p>
<p>thing i feel like because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t um</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t take too much of it because your body</p>
<p>builds of a tolerance so fast that</p>
<p>you can basically only trip</p>
<p>crazy like once or</p>
<p>twice a month</p>
<p>before you have to take consume mass amounts of</p>
<p>mushrooms just to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>everyday it&rsquo;s like people that</p>
<p>smoke weed every day if they knew if</p>
<p>they knew that they could take</p>
<p>three days off a week off</p>
<p>they just reset</p>
<p>their marijuana clock</p>
<p>and then now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll take a hit next week and it&rsquo;ll be so much</p>
<p>stronger is that all it takes oh</p>
<p>it usually takes about</p>
<p>three days i would say</p>
<p>three to five days</p>
<p>yeah to reset</p>
<p>yeah i take a long time</p>
<p>off sometimes sometimes i go a couple weeks without it</p>
<p>depending on if i&rsquo;m writing if i&rsquo;m writing i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ever take time off it&rsquo;s like doug benson you know doug</p>
<p>that dude he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys that</p>
<p>smokes all day</p>
<p>now that guy just took</p>
<p>a week off he would</p>
<p>back to normal</p>
<p>one joint i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>stoned yeah</p>
<p>but i think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>enjoying it you saw the</p>
<p>movie right yeah</p>
<p>super home yeah</p>
<p>yeah i think he</p>
<p>enjoys it though you know i mean i</p>
<p>think he enjoys being high all the time</p>
<p>you know i think he does he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a nice friendly high guy</p>
<p>yeah you know i</p>
<p>think it stops working like a teddy bear</p>
<p>yeah if you smoke</p>
<p>all day long</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting high anymore you&rsquo;re just kind of</p>
<p>definitely not getting obliterated</p>
<p>alright i had a</p>
<p>good friend</p>
<p>high school</p>
<p>yeah i have a good friend high</p>
<p>school who once</p>
<p>we were in like the</p>
<p>video store together and like</p>
<p>are you high</p>
<p>right now he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m not high</p>
<p>he smoked so much weed that i thought he was</p>
<p>stone when he was sober</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious yeah i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when i was in</p>
<p>seventh grade there was a kid</p>
<p>named vic dobrowski</p>
<p>victim broski was like a little bit</p>
<p>older than us like he failed a year</p>
<p>and he was like</p>
<p>a little bit old us but he hung out with us</p>
<p>and he was one of</p>
<p>these dudes he</p>
<p>would look like</p>
<p>in real life</p>
<p>like a jim brewer character of a</p>
<p>crazy druggie</p>
<p>like say if jim</p>
<p>brewer was doing saturday night live</p>
<p>come on man you fucking take it man</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the big deal this guy</p>
<p>victim broski was fucking nuts and he always had</p>
<p>he always had</p>
<p>all sorts of fucked up</p>
<p>things that i was trying to</p>
<p>avoid he like my friends</p>
<p>would go and do drugs with them</p>
<p>whatever they want</p>
<p>anyways one of the</p>
<p>first times i ever did pot i did it with vic nebraski</p>
<p>the gateway kid it&rsquo;s always the gateway</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>that kid who like</p>
<p>has been held back who</p>
<p>helps you get access to</p>
<p>things by the time i was</p>
<p>thirty years old i</p>
<p>maybe smoked pot</p>
<p>just a handful of times my whole life</p>
<p>and one of them was this fucking kid</p>
<p>one of them was</p>
<p>my stepdad my stepdad gave me some pot when i was eight</p>
<p>wow yeah he was</p>
<p>smoking weed and i was like let me try it and he let me</p>
<p>are you fucking serious oh i&rsquo;m totally serious wow that</p>
<p>was a hippie</p>
<p>long haired hippie man</p>
<p>we were living in san francisco that&rsquo;s awesome it was</p>
<p>very strange we used to me and my friends and i have</p>
<p>these tapes somewhere in ohio</p>
<p>me and my friends when we were</p>
<p>like 15 we would</p>
<p>get some marijuana and</p>
<p>would sit around a tape recorder and just get high and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of what we&rsquo;re doing right now</p>
<p>but you know but just</p>
<p>three of us and it was</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re 15 high is different than when you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>adult high the</p>
<p>shoot used to talk</p>
<p>about it was probably the dumbest retarded ship ever</p>
<p>how old were you when you were getting high regularly</p>
<p>fifteen fifteen regular like</p>
<p>every day yeah why not</p>
<p>every day cause</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t it was hard to get when you were fifteen we</p>
<p>would buy from college kids</p>
<p>so how how often</p>
<p>would you get it</p>
<p>well one of us</p>
<p>would get it</p>
<p>at least once a week</p>
<p>and would probably</p>
<p>smoke maybe</p>
<p>two or three times a week</p>
<p>but back then it was different</p>
<p>back then we had to find places to</p>
<p>smoke like church parking lots</p>
<p>or good malls</p>
<p>yeah it would</p>
<p>be like high in our car</p>
<p>using pop cans</p>
<p>and then go into the mall and walk around</p>
<p>chess king and buy you</p>
<p>oh man i remember</p>
<p>stuff like that doing the craziest</p>
<p>craziest things just to</p>
<p>get the smell</p>
<p>the supposed</p>
<p>smell of smoke away</p>
<p>that like you have this idea as a high</p>
<p>school like that it&rsquo;s like clinging to you like</p>
<p>toxic waste that it can be</p>
<p>smelled hours</p>
<p>after you know</p>
<p>drive around in the</p>
<p>middle in the minnesota winter with the windows down</p>
<p>like for miles with the windows down</p>
<p>after smoking</p>
<p>and just do all this</p>
<p>crazy stuff like change jackets and</p>
<p>all this stuff just just in case you know</p>
<p>throw the dogs off</p>
<p>everything so</p>
<p>apparent what i</p>
<p>read nowadays</p>
<p>ever if you see a fucking dog and you&rsquo;re high shit</p>
<p>the dog with a cop shut</p>
<p>shut shut shut</p>
<p>i was with a friend of mine and we were</p>
<p>stone we were driving</p>
<p>and this is a high</p>
<p>school and we hit a deer</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re stoned</p>
<p>and that was the scariest</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s ever happened to me i thought we were</p>
<p>gonna be arrested and sent to jail i was sure like</p>
<p>the first thing i thought was</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve committed a huge crime here</p>
<p>and the head</p>
<p>i was in the passenger seat</p>
<p>and the deer&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>he jumped literally just jumped from bushes</p>
<p>just arced over the road</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no chance of missing we&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>going like 30</p>
<p>miles an hour but the deer&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>hit the windshield</p>
<p>right in front of me and</p>
<p>cracked the windshield</p>
<p>and the deer kind of</p>
<p>tumbled off the side of the car and i have like this</p>
<p>these three indelible images in my</p>
<p>brain one of them is</p>
<p>deers a profile of a deer&rsquo;s head and the windshield</p>
<p>breaking i&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>fuck oh my god that was hot was it a bail did it</p>
<p>it was like a</p>
<p>dough was a full size dough</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t kill it though because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going really slow</p>
<p>so it was in the car with you yeah</p>
<p>no it didn&rsquo;t grow through the windshield it just</p>
<p>cracked it you know car windshields are</p>
<p>thick it shattered it but it didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>bust through it</p>
<p>i was also just</p>
<p>the head of it the body of it was off to the side</p>
<p>so it tumbled off and</p>
<p>i had the passenger side window was down a little bit</p>
<p>and a drop of mud</p>
<p>and a drop of</p>
<p>blood landed on my thumb</p>
<p>and i was just</p>
<p>oh my god there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy one that i saw it was online it was a video</p>
<p>of this family that had been interviewed</p>
<p>after a deer went through</p>
<p>their car a</p>
<p>deer went through the</p>
<p>front windshield they</p>
<p>slammed into it the deer went through the</p>
<p>front windshield</p>
<p>kicked and smashed its way</p>
<p>and went out the back windshield nobody died</p>
<p>nobody died</p>
<p>but the kid</p>
<p>the girl got fucked up</p>
<p>she got like hoofed</p>
<p>in the face and her nose was broken and she had two</p>
<p>black eyes and</p>
<p>she was like a part of some play or something</p>
<p>so she had to like get</p>
<p>ready she didn&rsquo;t want her</p>
<p>understudy to have to do she had</p>
<p>like two weeks to heal up and she was just jackmified</p>
<p>and then you know</p>
<p>the father got fucked up he had like broken</p>
<p>orbital bones and shit and</p>
<p>you know deers are fucking dangerous man</p>
<p>you hit your car like that</p>
<p>people could die all the time they go</p>
<p>right through the car</p>
<p>yeah if you&rsquo;re living in a deer community it</p>
<p>might be a better</p>
<p>it might be a good idea</p>
<p>to have like some big fucking</p>
<p>mad max type</p>
<p>cage over the</p>
<p>front of your car we</p>
<p>still always have because in ohio it&rsquo;s pretty bad</p>
<p>but we used to have</p>
<p>those little</p>
<p>things you put on</p>
<p>your bumpers that</p>
<p>whistles them</p>
<p>yeah whistles</p>
<p>actually work</p>
<p>though and i feel like they</p>
<p>kind of work</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t ever hear what if it runs out of</p>
<p>batteries then you&rsquo;re fucked well i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the batteries that use</p>
<p>the wind it&rsquo;s a kind of like a</p>
<p>whistle that you put on your cars when you</p>
<p>drive the air goes through it makes like a</p>
<p>sound that you can&rsquo;t hear like a</p>
<p>dog whistle</p>
<p>and i i mean</p>
<p>it seems like it makes sense</p>
<p>i think they</p>
<p>kind of work i</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they actually work because if they did</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll probably be mandatory to have them or something</p>
<p>because insurance companies</p>
<p>pay out the ass when</p>
<p>right people i&rsquo;ve been in a car like six or</p>
<p>seven times hitting deer yeah</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>a lot of minnesota</p>
<p>yeah minnesota&rsquo;s packed with them</p>
<p>right yeah well</p>
<p>the problem is is like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no natural predators in like the city areas</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>these herds just go</p>
<p>crazy you don&rsquo;t have mountain lions there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s coyotes on</p>
<p>maybe in the way outskirts and timber timber</p>
<p>wolves up north but</p>
<p>in southern minnesota there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>for them to uh</p>
<p>nothing to kill him so you</p>
<p>over the last</p>
<p>hundred years there&rsquo;s been two</p>
<p>uh instances of</p>
<p>wolves killing people i just</p>
<p>found this out the other day</p>
<p>one of them they killed and</p>
<p>ate this guy</p>
<p>the wolves did yeah they</p>
<p>found them when they were eating this guy</p>
<p>is in two thousand five then there was a</p>
<p>woman recently</p>
<p>two thousand ten hmm</p>
<p>is that way did</p>
<p>you just google that or did you find it like did you</p>
<p>accidentally stumble on it or you just i</p>
<p>remember the</p>
<p>story i remember the story</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how fucked up i am</p>
<p>i remember the</p>
<p>story because i had a conversation with someone</p>
<p>where they were talking about</p>
<p>it was the dumbest conversation ever it was like</p>
<p>who would win a gorilla</p>
<p>or a grizzly bear</p>
<p>and it was one of</p>
<p>those conversations and i was saying a grizzly bear</p>
<p>would fuck a</p>
<p>gorilla yeah i think so</p>
<p>a grizzly bear</p>
<p>would do whatever you want to do but</p>
<p>maybe the girls no</p>
<p>smart would have</p>
<p>picked the gorilla really yeah i</p>
<p>would pick gorillas are just</p>
<p>crazy strong for some</p>
<p>reason yeah but so are bears and they&rsquo;re way bigger</p>
<p>like a kodiak</p>
<p>like a big bears like two thousand plus</p>
<p>pounds gorillas don&rsquo;t get to</p>
<p>did you find the answer</p>
<p>yeah well i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s just speculation</p>
<p>i mean i think</p>
<p>probably japanese people have probably done it for a</p>
<p>video they do it with bugs and</p>
<p>tigers i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>those bugs i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>tigers vs lions they&rsquo;ve done that they did</p>
<p>tigers vs crocodile an actual</p>
<p>they make them</p>
<p>fight each other</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m pretty sure it was a japanese video</p>
<p>the same people</p>
<p>who sound i</p>
<p>might not be correct</p>
<p>about that i</p>
<p>might be it</p>
<p>might have been japanese subtitle for</p>
<p>videos somebody else made</p>
<p>but it was a</p>
<p>i saw a tiger</p>
<p>versus a lion i saw</p>
<p>they do a lot</p>
<p>of them with bugs they have like bugs yeah</p>
<p>those stag beetles yeah i saw some documentary</p>
<p>about that it&rsquo;s really interesting they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>obsessed with</p>
<p>those beetles</p>
<p>gamble on yeah</p>
<p>but nobody&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>stand up for a beetle</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it funny it&rsquo;s like then</p>
<p>we know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>alive but they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>quite close enough for us to give a fuck not quite</p>
<p>sentient you can have like a tv show</p>
<p>where you have</p>
<p>these things battle to the</p>
<p>death and nobody</p>
<p>would freak out</p>
<p>yeah people got pissed off me at the</p>
<p>snail video i did that back in the day</p>
<p>but you just</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>snails though the</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>snails is that people</p>
<p>more relate to</p>
<p>snails than they do to beetles because</p>
<p>snails are soft</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>soft isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>crazy don&rsquo;t they eat snails</p>
<p>yes we eat snails</p>
<p>yeah but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter we deer</p>
<p>we love deer</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t no one gets</p>
<p>upset if you go to the</p>
<p>store and buy ant spray</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go fuck up some ants</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no people like</p>
<p>standing in</p>
<p>front of the</p>
<p>ants prey aisle picketing</p>
<p>you know but they&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>crazy about kentucky</p>
<p>fried chicken that and cats you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>people love cats of course you don&rsquo;t like cats i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stand them actually we did a</p>
<p>thing on the show</p>
<p>i fucking hate him</p>
<p>you hate him yeah i&rsquo;m terrible person we did</p>
<p>we shot with a submarine on mega drive</p>
<p>and we decided we&rsquo;d get a</p>
<p>bunch of cats and</p>
<p>bring them with submarine because cats hate</p>
<p>water so it</p>
<p>would be kind of a</p>
<p>little payback</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s cute but i just</p>
<p>i just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i just am a dog person</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>colon thing</p>
<p>it could be yeah</p>
<p>actually no a friend of mine who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>colon as well</p>
<p>he he loves cats so</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>you know what man i</p>
<p>could see your</p>
<p>point though i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>some cunty cats in the past but i&rsquo;ve got really cool</p>
<p>cats now it&rsquo;s on what kind of cats are around but dogs</p>
<p>dogs are always more interactive i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hate cats i just</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t give a fuck i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna injure them i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna hurt them</p>
<p>right but i just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give a fuck just want them to be away yeah</p>
<p>yeah get out of here you needy</p>
<p>keep my distance keep</p>
<p>their distance from my</p>
<p>body needy fucking hole</p>
<p>we had we had a peter</p>
<p>up on set for that for the</p>
<p>really decide to decide how many was the</p>
<p>appropriate</p>
<p>number of cats to put in a two man submersible</p>
<p>so many do they</p>
<p>agree on they</p>
<p>under five had to be less than five cats</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>someone was decide arbitraries i know it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely a precedent i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s ever happened before</p>
<p>they never had to decide</p>
<p>what is the</p>
<p>right amount of cats and this cat shit all over shit</p>
<p>all over the</p>
<p>pilot and not</p>
<p>me at all scared</p>
<p>right oh yeah</p>
<p>definitely scared but they were really cool i was</p>
<p>kinda disappointed i was hoping for like</p>
<p>shitty cows</p>
<p>freaked out they&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>bouncing around like a little rubber bullets</p>
<p>they just said all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s just deal with this i just sat there and</p>
<p>twitched into my thighs</p>
<p>these people have a plan</p>
<p>yeah when we did fear factor they</p>
<p>visit us a bunch of times a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>stunts there was some</p>
<p>peter representatives or some animal</p>
<p>you know some some</p>
<p>group representative</p>
<p>i always wanted to make sure that we</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t doing anything fucked up from the</p>
<p>horse vagina</p>
<p>union well really</p>
<p>the real issues were like rats</p>
<p>like we did some</p>
<p>stuff with rats you know</p>
<p>where like rats got piled onto each</p>
<p>other and you</p>
<p>know a certain amount of rats on top of each</p>
<p>other it becomes</p>
<p>chaos because there&rsquo;s a rat</p>
<p>at the bottom there</p>
<p>under 30 layers</p>
<p>of rats what&rsquo;s happening that rat</p>
<p>yeah it seemed like you also guys had</p>
<p>stunts where like there&rsquo;s people in like</p>
<p>things of rats where you</p>
<p>could just step on the rats they</p>
<p>stepped on them</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m sure they did</p>
<p>i like rats i tried to</p>
<p>avoid it but people</p>
<p>would scream and the rat</p>
<p>would bite them and the</p>
<p>fuck i stepped on it</p>
<p>people hate rats man</p>
<p>i feel like they&rsquo;re pretty cool</p>
<p>well until they&rsquo;re trying to eat your ass</p>
<p>if you ever</p>
<p>lived in new york city</p>
<p>no but i was in new york city once</p>
<p>and i was at a gas station and i</p>
<p>moved to this</p>
<p>is how long ago this is i didn&rsquo;t even have a cell phone</p>
<p>and i had to go over to a pay</p>
<p>phone to make a call and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>maybe 10 yards away from my car at a pay</p>
<p>phone and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching rats jump all over my wheels</p>
<p>climb up into my car housing climb down</p>
<p>big ones dude</p>
<p>big ones like</p>
<p>small cats like half the size of a cat</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just jumping all over my</p>
<p>mind whoa this</p>
<p>place is infested</p>
<p>and then they would</p>
<p>climb into the sewer grates</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like what does it look like down there</p>
<p>cause this is fucking nuts</p>
<p>i swear to god man i was in there i was talking on that</p>
<p>phone for maybe two</p>
<p>three minutes</p>
<p>at least a dozen rats</p>
<p>climbed all over my fucking</p>
<p>wheel i see</p>
<p>a lot of rats out here in la i go in my backyard at</p>
<p>night and the</p>
<p>power wires are just</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like a train</p>
<p>yeah i see we get them up here in the hills</p>
<p>zoom downtown a lot</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s tons</p>
<p>of them down there but nothing like new york i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think because new york has that whole</p>
<p>underground layer</p>
<p>they say there&rsquo;s more rats than there are people</p>
<p>many more way more yeah</p>
<p>wrap your head around that shit man i used</p>
<p>to date a girl that had a rat that she just like let</p>
<p>run around the whole</p>
<p>house and it was a</p>
<p>smart rat though</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking your chances</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty smart</p>
<p>right yeah i guess so you take any chances yeah</p>
<p>you know but it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things where i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the hot crazy</p>
<p>chick you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got her she&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>which is we were just talking</p>
<p>about that in the beginning of the show before we ever</p>
<p>started we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about certain</p>
<p>someone that we know has a certain situation</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a certain hot</p>
<p>chick who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy as fuck and she&rsquo;s into him and he&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to figure out what the fuck to do and i&rsquo;m saying run</p>
<p>run like the breeze</p>
<p>i think you have to i</p>
<p>think you have to try to engage the</p>
<p>animal escaped</p>
<p>and tame it</p>
<p>maybe perhaps</p>
<p>like breaking a</p>
<p>stallion you can&rsquo;t tame</p>
<p>yeah i think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>breaking stallion</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like most</p>
<p>things were</p>
<p>you have to just</p>
<p>make an attempt to</p>
<p>engage the beast and</p>
<p>and get what you can from it and think</p>
<p>hmm do you say that but you were</p>
<p>young how old</p>
<p>are you well</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m 29 yeah and but i have</p>
<p>dated i dated a</p>
<p>crazy girl go</p>
<p>crazy she was she was bipolar</p>
<p>and i was in college</p>
<p>and she was one of</p>
<p>those things where</p>
<p>for one ending</p>
<p>that relationship is very difficult because</p>
<p>bipolar people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>deal with those type of</p>
<p>things very well</p>
<p>so it was like</p>
<p>you know four am</p>
<p>some painting on my</p>
<p>front door kind of crap like</p>
<p>quick creepy</p>
<p>crazy shit and</p>
<p>i was painting like</p>
<p>things on your front door</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like scratching</p>
<p>stuff into the door ooh</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t home you were home</p>
<p>you were sleeping i</p>
<p>think i was yeah she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>below you awake</p>
<p>clawing it would</p>
<p>yeah i was like a fucking zombie</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>mean she wasn&rsquo;t she wasn&rsquo;t like the craziest</p>
<p>bipolar but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i can definitely</p>
<p>have have sympathy for the</p>
<p>for that situation it&rsquo;s something i</p>
<p>think a lot of people get into because it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>thing where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re black people like who are bipolar</p>
<p>very intriguing</p>
<p>yeah because they&rsquo;re because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>crazy but they&rsquo;re also like</p>
<p>maybe very talented</p>
<p>or interesting</p>
<p>or like prints in purple rain yeah</p>
<p>or also just totally mysterious</p>
<p>if i always say that if i</p>
<p>had a time machine i can go back in time to when i was</p>
<p>seventeen that&rsquo;s what i do i go straight</p>
<p>straight fucking mystery</p>
<p>prince and purple rain i&rsquo;d be wearing</p>
<p>fucking big coats to</p>
<p>school girls</p>

<p>would be amazing yeah</p>
<p>a big trench coat and shit i have</p>
<p>secrets lots of secrets</p>

<p>that would be nice that&rsquo;s the move for dumb</p>
<p>chicks man be a mystery</p>
<p>they love it yeah you know he&rsquo;s so different</p>
<p>maybe like thelonious monk i&rsquo;ve gotta go</p>
<p>like batman probably living up in a castle somewhere</p>
<p>in the dark like thelonious monk there go he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>musician he&rsquo;s brilliant have secrets</p>

<p>stand drive you&rsquo;re on a show</p>

<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like driving i don&rsquo;t like driving like my car</p>
<p>on the 134 like you know</p>
<p>traffic driving in the city is the most</p>
<p>uninspiring</p>
<p>experience in the</p>
<p>whole life like</p>
<p>every time i get in the car</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like my</p>
<p>brain just becomes that much less</p>
<p>powerful it just</p>
<p>crushes my my friend</p>
<p>tony v told me something once</p>
<p>he was a tony v is a</p>
<p>comic from boston</p>
<p>and he was making this trek</p>
<p>from new york</p>
<p>to boston he was doing on a regular basis like a</p>
<p>three hour drive</p>
<p>and i was you know he had</p>
<p>to do what he had to do he had a gig in new york and he</p>
<p>lived in boston</p>
<p>so i was like</p>
<p>how what is that like what are you doing</p>
<p>are you going crazy</p>
<p>this fucking</p>
<p>drive that&rsquo;s a nutty drive duo</p>
<p>he goes i just goes in</p>
<p>he goes i just</p>
<p>in my car i&rsquo;m driving i go this is what i&rsquo;m doing now</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how i look at it</p>
<p>i go wow i never even thought</p>
<p>about that way that really is like</p>
<p>you can decide that this fucking sucks i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>meanwhile how bad does</p>
<p>it suck really what are you doing you&rsquo;re sitting right</p>
<p>you know oh requires your concentration you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be okay</p>
<p>i just hate that that that sometimes i</p>
<p>space out so much when i</p>
<p>drive because i need</p>
<p>to that that i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>what have i been doing for ten minutes</p>
<p>did i kill anybody</p>
<p>where am i weird feeling yeah</p>
<p>alive you you have no idea how you&rsquo;re taking this</p>
<p>right turn right you&rsquo;re in the middle of the</p>
<p>right turn going whoa i&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>everything correct right</p>
<p>yeah i think</p>
<p>maybe maybe i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>of course you did</p>
<p>otherwise you would have woken up out of your</p>
<p>trance maybe but it&rsquo;s good it</p>
<p>was autopilot right</p>
<p>if you do a</p>
<p>route over and over and over and over and over</p>
<p>again like that man you really</p>
<p>can go on autopilot that i don&rsquo;t mind but it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>stuff where you can&rsquo;t go on autopilot</p>
<p>cause i feel like in la you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cause people</p>
<p>who strive so</p>
<p>aggressively all the time</p>
<p>you have to be on</p>
<p>to be defensive to like some</p>
<p>continent too many</p>
<p>humans volkswagen</p>
<p>so much different when i</p>
<p>lived in boulder people</p>
<p>drove so much nicer</p>
<p>so much more polite it was</p>
<p>a big big big difference to the</p>
<p>point where when i came back when i was doing i was</p>
<p>going back and forth when i was over there for two</p>
<p>months then i came back</p>
<p>and i was like whoa this is crazy</p>
<p>like you really</p>
<p>wrap your head around how fucking fast everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going everybody&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>take that right turn on red even</p>
<p>when someone&rsquo;s coming they just fucking gun the gas</p>
<p>and i was like whoa what is that saving you two</p>
<p>seconds what the fuck is going on</p>
<p>whereas in boulder there</p>
<p>was like none of that everybody was waving in everybody</p>
<p>and everybody was driving straight</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>i like to do if like someone like cuts me off really</p>
<p>aggressively like to pull up next to him just be like</p>
<p>hey hey hey how you doing like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fucking crazy</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s it going hey</p>
<p>brandi&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>rear end brandy</p>
<p>brandy the singer</p>
<p>what how dare you she got</p>
<p>shot somebody</p>
<p>she no she did she fucking killed somebody yeah she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i do not get it all if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>rich and famous like that</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go out and be crazy</p>
<p>why not just</p>
<p>get someone to do</p>
<p>the first thing</p>
<p>i do is like</p>
<p>paris hilton</p>
<p>should never be driving why</p>
<p>would you well i</p>
<p>think a lot</p>
<p>of them are real private and they don&rsquo;t want anybody</p>
<p>to be in their life like that all the time well</p>
<p>you hire a hot</p>
<p>chick to be your driver</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>their freedom to be</p>
<p>taken away they want to be able to just i want to</p>
<p>leave right now</p>
<p>you know and get your car and go you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want but you could</p>
<p>have their freedom</p>
<p>twenty four hours</p>
<p>you could but you</p>
<p>gotta plan it out you know they like having a car</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m totally in</p>
<p>agreement with you yeah</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>an illusion of freedom with</p>
<p>car it just happens</p>
<p>what she did is a fuck up</p>
<p>could happen to anybody</p>
<p>could have brandy</p>
<p>party yeah it wasn&rsquo;t yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unfortunate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>worst person ever to happen to</p>
<p>i guess i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking more like paracel lindsay</p>
<p>lohan types like why</p>
<p>they are driving at all all coped up because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>partying man</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting the free gone</p>
<p>right but lindsay lohan</p>
<p>it keeps causing herself problems all if</p>
<p>she just call it</p>
<p>problems i call it</p>
<p>entertainment</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s be real</p>
<p>about this it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that big of a problem she&rsquo;s not living in liberia</p>
<p>fighting off cannibals right well</p>
<p>this one thing they</p>
<p>should have done with her is you know</p>
<p>everyone has a theory i&rsquo;ll fix her</p>
<p>this is the this is the best day they</p>
<p>could have done because</p>
<p>i was la county</p>
<p>problem right so she goes</p>
<p>talking about this i</p>
<p>gotta piss okay</p>
<p>she goes it&rsquo;s la county</p>
<p>problem so she goes to la</p>
<p>county court</p>
<p>system what they</p>
<p>should have done it</p>
<p>should have mandated her to be</p>
<p>the public spokesperson for metro</p>
<p>for los angeles</p>
<p>metro make her take the fucking bus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be like the best</p>
<p>sentence for her</p>
<p>you just force her</p>
<p>take the bus</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>bunch of bodyguards whatever she has to take the bus</p>
<p>and you can get around fine on public</p>
<p>transit in los angeles people do it and almost</p>
<p>be fun to try to get on the same bus as lindsay lohan</p>
<p>that will be such a</p>
<p>great thing for</p>
<p>metro because they need</p>
<p>all the positive</p>
<p>stuff they can get because they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>like vilified constantly</p>
<p>you know as they</p>
<p>should be kind of but</p>
<p>and it would also be like the perfect</p>
<p>punishment fits the</p>
<p>crime kind of</p>
<p>thing for her</p>
<p>absolutely so but</p>
<p>why they didn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>know no one ever</p>
<p>thinks to do something actually insightful as far as a</p>
<p>punishment goes because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah i want</p>
<p>to try my shot at dating lindsay</p>
<p>lohan i think i</p>
<p>think it would be one of</p>
<p>those fixer</p>
<p>uppers you know probably a little bit harder</p>
<p>than the most normal girl yeah it just seems like</p>
<p>that she definitely does not have a normal that</p>
<p>probably does not</p>
<p>well she&rsquo;s lesbian now that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve already we&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>talked about how you can&rsquo;t fix a man</p>
<p>wait who&rsquo;s a lesbian</p>
<p>yeah she was</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not like a well she&rsquo;s not a hundred percent</p>
<p>lesbian but</p>
<p>she was dating</p>
<p>sam samantha</p>
<p>for a long time</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a mark good dj</p>
<p>why do we care what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with us</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good dj and her brothers are good musicians</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s actually respectable i&rsquo;d say</p>
<p>she picked a good</p>
<p>lesbian yeah</p>
<p>but i feel like that&rsquo;s most people who</p>
<p>is a lesbian because</p>
<p>like whoever gives you</p>
<p>the most attention what&rsquo;s that she met a</p>
<p>bunch of douchebag kids</p>
<p>that and like</p>
<p>if you meet</p>
<p>she probably met some</p>
<p>lesbian who</p>
<p>did the mind meld</p>
<p>and like you know you are mine</p>
<p>kind of thing hmm</p>
<p>speaking of</p>
<p>lesbians yeah</p>
<p>what about him</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re awesome</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s a big fan of them</p>
<p>yeah lesbians</p>
<p>are attracted to me</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s the next step in the evolutionary</p>
<p>chain you know it goes monkey to man</p>
<p>brian somewhere in there</p>
<p>oh man i get mistaken for lesbian</p>
<p>so i guess i&rsquo;m higher</p>
<p>more involved do you i&rsquo;m attracted to you</p>

<p>hbo guy he&rsquo;s um like a espn hbo type</p>
<p>guy it&rsquo;s not him it&rsquo;s another one well now he&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>joe rogan you called me a</p>
<p>transvestite</p>
<p>well i had a thing with this fucking male or</p>
<p>mma reporter recently</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s retarded</p>
<p>what do you mean well</p>
<p>there was a good comeback by the way that&rsquo;s a douchebag</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry take that out and make it a cocksucker</p>
<p>i call him a faculty</p>
<p>the guy&rsquo;s an asshole and</p>
<p>this is my deal with the guy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even need to say this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>name but what this guy does is he goes and he works for</p>
<p>various websites and critiques</p>
<p>mixed martial artists</p>
<p>guys who are fighting</p>
<p>these tournaments and he says a lot of really fucking</p>
<p>stupid mean shit</p>
<p>like just just dumb</p>
<p>insensitive and incorrect</p>
<p>and he does it all the time and i</p>
<p>would read it and it</p>
<p>would drive me</p>
<p>crazy because i know that this is a person who is</p>
<p>for sure has</p>
<p>never fought and competed because if they did they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have more respect for the people that are competing</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so he shits on the</p>
<p>fighters or oh yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll read you some of the dumb shit</p>
<p>that he says because he says a lot of really i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s like people who talk shit</p>
<p>about about</p>
<p>like soldiers and stuff</p>
<p>well you know you</p>
<p>say that i can</p>
<p>understand you know</p>
<p>thinking that war is</p>
<p>wrong and you can</p>
<p>people yeah but that&rsquo;s different than</p>
<p>talking about soldiers</p>
<p>i think that westboro</p>
<p>baptist church the pickets soldiers</p>
<p>oh yeah god hates facts the god hates</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>so this guy</p>
<p>i got upset with this guy</p>
<p>because this is one of the</p>
<p>things that happened was he criticized me about</p>
<p>a technique a martial arts technique</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of different names</p>
<p>for this technique and one of them is the right one</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s on a practitioner of martial arts so he only</p>
<p>knows one name for this technique so he criticized me</p>
<p>and he said i was clueless</p>
<p>which is so i got</p>
<p>annoyed and i</p>
<p>wrote that this guy&rsquo;s a dumb cunt and</p>
<p>this is exactly what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>and before it was ever that</p>
<p>it was something else so this is just my response to it</p>
<p>and then i start</p>
<p>going over some of</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s articles and all the shit that he&rsquo;s written</p>
<p>about other</p>
<p>fighters and i</p>
<p>start reading some of the shit that he</p>
<p>wrote and there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always negative</p>
<p>cunty shit he did it</p>
<p>about this guy sean mccorkle and did it</p>
<p>about this guy jake shields</p>
<p>so then i go to his</p>
<p>fucking his twitter and it&rsquo;s all just negative</p>
<p>negative negative</p>
<p>it looks like</p>
<p>i have no ideas no</p>
<p>photos of him online are you serious no</p>
<p>photos how is</p>
<p>that possible he&rsquo;s just around balls he probably knows</p>
<p>he knows that uh</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to put it out there because he knows he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna just get it</p>
<p>so i just go off on this guy and i call him a faggot</p>
<p>so after i call him a faggot</p>
<p>he makes this post</p>
<p>saying that i used a</p>
<p>homophobic slur</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>my favorite part</p>
<p>about it that i needed to apologize to</p>
<p>it was like a</p>
<p>weird quote</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>the lesbian was like</p>
<p>lesbian gay lbg sexual</p>
<p>transgender and queer</p>
<p>oh wow queers in</p>
<p>their tier queers and</p>
<p>very informed with all these</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>weird that the</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s a real acronym is it an acronym if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t say a word</p>
<p>um i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>right i think</p>
<p>it is yeah i</p>
<p>think it is</p>
<p>right if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of letters like cia</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not you don&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>sia yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still an act</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like nasa</p>
<p>stands for a national economic</p>
<p>space administration nasa</p>
<p>but a cia it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>you just say you have to say the letters i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still an</p>
<p>acronym though is it yeah</p>
<p>okay well anyway</p>
<p>so he makes this ridiculous</p>
<p>thing that you know</p>
<p>completely dodging the fact that he was</p>
<p>absolutely incorrect</p>
<p>all these people</p>
<p>told him that is the correct name for this and the k1</p>
<p>expert the guy who does k1 kickboxing</p>
<p>michael sievella</p>
<p>he jumps on the thread and he does all this</p>
<p>all this guy&rsquo;s doing is</p>
<p>rallying on the fact that i called him a faggot</p>
<p>you know that i&rsquo;ve said this hurtful thing</p>
<p>so you know and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had this conversation</p>
<p>so many fucking times and i see everyone&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>i see you say well it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>homophobic slur</p>
<p>and you shouldn&rsquo;t say it i get that i get that</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t intent what&rsquo;s supposed to be important</p>
<p>about words</p>
<p>absolutely yeah</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that when you it totally is</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s knows i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>calling him a homosexual i&rsquo;m calling him a fact well</p>
<p>maybe i&rsquo;ll know</p>
<p>you probably were in that term though because i</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t though because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with gay people yeah</p>
<p>no problem with actual gay people that word has</p>
<p>changed so much not to being</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s not even a bad word</p>
<p>for gay people anymore is it because well</p>
<p>it is a faggot</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sensitive</p>
<p>topic right now gay used to be fun and grand</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have a gay old time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the fucking flintstones man</p>
<p>now gay is but is gay</p>
<p>is homosexual well even</p>
<p>even the word gay</p>
<p>just barely means</p>
<p>i almost never hear someone say</p>
<p>something is gay when they&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>someone oh that that</p>
<p>that coffee pots gay they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean that coffee pot is fucking just sucks coffee pot</p>
<p>they mean it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>stupid or boring or dumb what</p>
<p>great gets me when it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>gross is this artificial outrage</p>
<p>yeah you know that you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>press this button and now you&rsquo;ve got a magic gift</p>
<p>a magic gift</p>
<p>you left behind the sack and i pick it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>world of warcraft</p>
<p>he said faggot oh</p>
<p>look what i&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;ve got a new</p>
<p>trick and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna make a big deal you</p>
<p>should apologize</p>
<p>cause you use the magic</p>
<p>you know somehow or another it changes what happened</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>said this word now you&rsquo;re an insensitive person yeah</p>
<p>you know this fucking hot button word like dad</p>
<p>dad he called me a faggot</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s changing the</p>
<p>whole argument instead</p>
<p>of it being he&rsquo;s an incompetent idiot</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t really know anything</p>
<p>about martial arts and is inherently negative and</p>
<p>everything he says is</p>
<p>basically like he grabs the thesaurus</p>
<p>tries to sound intelligent</p>
<p>says a bunch of</p>
<p>stupid shit</p>
<p>and just wrong over and over and over and over</p>
<p>again i mean i can fucking tell you</p>
<p>these all these</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>if you go to</p>
<p>the joe rogan</p>
<p>net forums the message</p>
<p>board there&rsquo;s a thread</p>
<p>and the threads entitled</p>
<p>in the combat</p>
<p>sports forum</p>
<p>official thomas</p>
<p>rios thread of incompetence and debauchery</p>
<p>and douchery rather</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing because it&rsquo;s over and over</p>
<p>again this guy being an asshole and being wrong</p>
<p>being an asshole and being wrong</p>
<p>this is the sad</p>
<p>state of mma</p>
<p>today the journalists in</p>
<p>mma are so bad</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a few</p>
<p>standouts and a</p>
<p>bunch of loudmouth</p>
<p>contrarian douchebags that&rsquo;s the case of</p>
<p>journalism in general i feel like i feel like no one</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s maybe</p>
<p>three actual</p>
<p>journalists</p>
<p>doing anything</p>
<p>i wanna say</p>
<p>three there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>i know what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying though</p>
<p>i know what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying everyone&rsquo;s a reporter no one&rsquo;s a journalist</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>get attention</p>
<p>on themselves not</p>
<p>based on their merits</p>
<p>but based on being an asshole</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy</p>
<p>that i respect very much his name is</p>
<p>ariel alwani and he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>journalist he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great guy too and</p>
<p>every time he interviews someone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>intelligent well thought out interview he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never negative he&rsquo;s always positive</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a universally</p>
<p>loved reporter because of this</p>
<p>if he was a writer it</p>
<p>would be the same goddamn</p>
<p>thing he would be universally loved</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s guys like that that get</p>
<p>their attention that way and there&rsquo;s guys like this</p>
<p>so i decided to go</p>
<p>after this guy</p>
<p>so i decided to do shit all over him and i wrote a</p>
<p>response to his</p>
<p>being upset that i said faggot</p>
<p>and i said i apologize and i understand</p>
<p>that even though</p>
<p>i love that word people can view it the wrong way</p>
<p>so please replace the word faggot</p>
<p>with cocksucker okay</p>
<p>what the fuck man</p>
<p>love that one</p>
<p>this is the dumb game we&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the word he said the</p>
<p>magic word you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say you know what i mean</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>you know stop</p>
<p>playing stop pretending i&rsquo;m shitting on all</p>
<p>these gay people because</p>
<p>i love gay people i have no problem with gay people</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>douchebags i don&rsquo;t like assholes i don&rsquo;t like cunts</p>
<p>you know you want to call them faggots whatever</p>
<p>you want to call them you know what i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not talking about</p>
<p>a negative name for homosexual people and</p>
<p>we are getting</p>
<p>tied up in fucking pc</p>
<p>bullshit in this country</p>
<p>we are appeasing people who are pretending to be hurt</p>
<p>and you know why</p>
<p>because life&rsquo;s too fucking soft</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why because</p>
<p>food is easy you can go to burger king or the fucking</p>
<p>supermarket</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to go hunt it</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re raising a</p>
<p>bunch of pussies and faggots</p>
<p>and it has nothing to do with gay</p>
<p>it has to do with people being weak dumb bitches</p>
<p>soft and looking for an easy way out</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m gonna win the lottery and i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>ooh you said that now i win ooh</p>
<p>just a bunch of</p>
<p>weird bitches just looking for tricks</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a huge problem we have with this country</p>
<p>and it should not be in the craziest</p>
<p>most pure and real</p>
<p>sport in the</p>
<p>world this sport</p>
<p>mixed martial arts should be</p>
<p>about honor</p>
<p>it should be about</p>
<p>two dudes given</p>
<p>their all and risking</p>
<p>everything putting it all on the line and they</p>
<p>should be treated with respect</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be ones that aren&rsquo;t as good as</p>
<p>others there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be people that try and fail</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>learn and maybe they won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>maybe other people will</p>
<p>learn from their mistakes</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s their contribution to the</p>
<p>sport but you have to respect and honor</p>
<p>every single one of them</p>
<p>and for some fucking anonymous cunt</p>
<p>some shithead</p>
<p>to be just sitting behind a computer just</p>
<p>on these guys left and</p>
<p>right and left and right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s disgusting</p>
<p>and you can do one or two</p>
<p>things you can do nothing</p>
<p>or you can do to him</p>
<p>what he does to</p>
<p>other people and make him feel it</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what i decided to do</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really give a fuck</p>
<p>about this guy</p>
<p>if this guy got hit in the head by a meteor it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t change my pulse</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>but i think that</p>
<p>things like this</p>
<p>should be you</p>
<p>should point out</p>
<p>things like this</p>
<p>being an a positive person is a really important</p>
<p>thing being nice to people as much as possible</p>
<p>is a really important</p>
<p>thing but another important thing is</p>
<p>cutting assholes off at the root</p>
<p>stopping them</p>
<p>yeah you have</p>
<p>to call people out on something yes you have to because</p>
<p>by not creating</p>
<p>this negativity and dealing with douchebags you you</p>
<p>allow more negativity somebody has to do something</p>
<p>i mean the reason</p>
<p>why hitler didn&rsquo;t take over the world is</p>
<p>cause someone fucking stepped up and did something</p>
<p>or groups of people stepped up and did something</p>
<p>whenever someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not comparing this due to hitler</p>
<p>you grandiose douchebag are you oh</p>
<p>what are you the</p>
<p>beach at normandy</p>
<p>you fucking</p>
<p>storming like hitler</p>
<p>i hear that</p>
<p>obama i hear that</p>
<p>obama is like hitler isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>of course he&rsquo;s black bro</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you follow the tea party song</p>
<p>you are a white</p>
<p>boy you know the handshake</p>
<p>obama&rsquo;s hillary&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>mussolini with what&rsquo;s yours indonesian</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a canyon</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a communist</p>
<p>indonesian stalin</p>
<p>worshipper i forgot about that</p>
<p>yeah is there ever gonna be a president we love</p>
<p>again is there ever gonna be</p>
<p>anyway cause everybody wanted</p>
<p>me to address this that&rsquo;s what i had address this</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>give a fuck what that guy does i don&rsquo;t faggotry my</p>
<p>brian says that that&rsquo;s my i</p>
<p>think that words hurtful</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s important in this life is that</p>
<p>you get checked</p>
<p>every now and then you know</p>
<p>when someone said this in one of the threads on the</p>
<p>mixed martial arts form</p>
<p>they said on</p>
<p>mixed martial</p>
<p>arts com they said this dude needs his ass kicked</p>
<p>and when you get your ass kicked at some</p>
<p>point in your life</p>
<p>that really</p>
<p>beats the douche out of you and a lot of people have</p>
<p>never gotten</p>
<p>their ass kicked and this guy</p>
<p>clearly has</p>
<p>a humbling experience</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s just being an asshole over and over and over</p>
<p>again sport</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need that shit man you know if you want to</p>
<p>bring that to</p>
<p>fucking problems</p>
<p>or whatever that this sport like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a magnet to that attitude well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are involved in this</p>
<p>sport that don&rsquo;t train</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>most people</p>
<p>probably though a lot</p>
<p>lot a lot do you know</p>
<p>you know but a lot don&rsquo;t and the ones that don&rsquo;t well</p>
<p>even the ones</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t a lot of the ones that don&rsquo;t are really cool</p>
<p>they just appreciate the</p>
<p>effort and they love the</p>
<p>sport they love to follow it and they</p>
<p>do they want to be a part of it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of them that are just cunts</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>they need to be outed</p>
<p>you know you need to let them know hey this is not cool</p>
<p>no you shouldn&rsquo;t be hiring cunts</p>
<p>no you shouldn&rsquo;t be letting cunts</p>
<p>spread their bullshit if they want to develop</p>
<p>their own shit and</p>
<p>start their own website</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing you do i&rsquo;m not saying you</p>
<p>should stop that</p>
<p>but what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying is you shouldn&rsquo;t be fucking paying cunts</p>
<p>money faggot</p>
<p>so yeah there&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>south park episode surprisingly enough</p>
<p>about about the word faggot</p>
<p>would faggot</p>
<p>heard about that is like bikers or something yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very you know as usual</p>
<p>those guys hit the nail on the head</p>
<p>very accurate</p>
<p>about it but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it breaks it down to where</p>
<p>all the kids are calling</p>
<p>these bikers</p>
<p>like these you know loud</p>
<p>hells angel type</p>
<p>how they do</p>
<p>you know harley harley drivers</p>
<p>riders but calling faggots</p>
<p>and like i was getting up in arms because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using that word</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like you can&rsquo;t say that</p>
<p>about gay people like</p>
<p>what we never say anything</p>
<p>about gay people we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>these assholes on the</p>
<p>motorcycles they&rsquo;re faggots</p>
<p>like what do you mean what do you mean</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s so accurate because it&rsquo;s like these</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re children they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have a problem with gay people</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>these guys playing</p>
<p>these driving</p>
<p>their loud ass</p>
<p>motorcycles</p>
<p>through like next to our</p>
<p>school it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>magic words you know</p>
<p>look it&rsquo;s anytime</p>
<p>you have any</p>
<p>hateful feeling towards anyone for no reason</p>
<p>other than the fact that they&rsquo;re part of a</p>
<p>group that&rsquo;s not you</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>black or gay or</p>
<p>woman or whatever the fuck it is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong with that</p>
<p>absolutely inherently there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong with that</p>
<p>but it needs to be</p>
<p>about intent it can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>about hot button</p>
<p>magic words it needs to be about</p>
<p>what i mean it can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be one word that means something that&rsquo;s dehumanizing</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be you know because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>silly you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>allow a word to be that</p>
<p>powerful it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a landmine or something it&rsquo;s like look</p>
<p>but like no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ashamed of being straight</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t know anyone that&rsquo;s a shame</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure there must be someone but you know</p>
<p>generalizing</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>crazy dude i wish it was good must be</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure if you can think</p>
<p>about it right</p>
<p>but then you</p>
<p>would probably be gay if you thought that</p>
<p>right but what i&rsquo;m saying is people are comfortable</p>
<p>with being gay because they&rsquo;re not persecuted</p>
<p>or with being straight because they&rsquo;re not persecuted</p>
<p>it should be exactly the same with gay people</p>
<p>it should be that they&rsquo;re so comfortable</p>
<p>with being gay that</p>
<p>if gay people came out with</p>
<p>a slang term for straight people</p>
<p>of gay people came out with a derogatory term</p>
<p>like you fucking</p>
<p>breeder yeah</p>
<p>breeders are close</p>
<p>to something</p>
<p>where people</p>
<p>would feel like god i can&rsquo;t believe you called me that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t exist it can&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>it should be exactly the same</p>
<p>with gay people</p>
<p>it should be</p>
<p>you call a gay guy a faggot and he&rsquo;s like what are you</p>
<p>are you you</p>
<p>really you&rsquo;re making fun of me because i like guys</p>
<p>yeah i like guys who gives a fuck what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with you</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with you</p>
<p>stupid and that&rsquo;s how people</p>
<p>would feel someone called you a breeder</p>
<p>it should be even that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the real answer</p>
<p>the real answer is not stop</p>
<p>magic words</p>
<p>the real answer is everybody</p>
<p>should be the fucking same you</p>
<p>should be able to call everyone a faggot</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t mean anything</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>magic words</p>
<p>nigger shouldn&rsquo;t be a</p>
<p>magic word cunt shouldn&rsquo;t be a</p>
<p>magic word faggot</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t be a</p>
<p>magic word it&rsquo;s nonsense</p>
<p>you should be able to bring</p>
<p>those up freely in meetings and business meetings yeah</p>
<p>right the more you say it the less</p>
<p>power that the</p>
<p>world has so</p>
<p>i had a business meeting yesterday</p>
<p>about my t shirts i got this</p>
<p>clothing line called higher</p>
<p>prime and clothing dot com</p>
<p>and the guys who are the artist that are</p>
<p>behind it they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>these fucking really cool</p>
<p>artist dudes with</p>
<p>crazy tattoos and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a business</p>

<p>one guy one cup one guy</p>
<p>one jar be one guy one jar i&rsquo;m glad i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen that he squats over</p>

<p>too you knew what the fuck you were doing you</p>
<p>could have shut that off you</p>
<p>watched the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>yeah but that&rsquo;s how it</p>
<p>should be man it</p>
<p>should be this fucking formal fake world</p>
<p>you know part of the reason why</p>
<p>so many people got fucked over in</p>
<p>the financial crisis</p>
<p>and so many people like put</p>
<p>trust into this imaginary fucking</p>
<p>stock market</p>
<p>and financial system</p>
<p>non existent</p>
<p>because it seems like it&rsquo;s all official</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s buttoned down and everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dressed the</p>
<p>right way and they&rsquo;re wearing</p>
<p>ties and wearing business suits and they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t fuck me over</p>
<p>they show up in</p>
<p>their leather</p>
<p>briefcase and</p>
<p>they look official and they&rsquo;re doing all the right</p>
<p>things they&rsquo;re not saying all the bad words</p>
<p>because i wouldn&rsquo;t trust my</p>
<p>money to one of</p>
<p>those fellas yeah if you say</p>
<p>yeah if you walked in saying</p>
<p>cunt faggot nigger</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s the name of</p>
<p>hi welcome to our</p>
<p>this is our bond company it&rsquo;s called cunt faggot nigger</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re here to take your shit</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna make a lot of</p>
<p>money come on let&rsquo;s do this woo you</p>
<p>ready dude give me a high five</p>
<p>like this guy shaky i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust with my money</p>
<p>you know he has to be like</p>
<p>super reserved</p>
<p>slick button down predetermined</p>
<p>patterns of behavior</p>
<p>easily predictable he&rsquo;s a gentleman</p>
<p>he has a fucking</p>
<p>scarf in his pocket you know the whole deal</p>
<p>it seems like politicians the same</p>
<p>thing where you can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>if you fall outside that mode of politician you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>whack he&rsquo;s a wacko</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a loon</p>
<p>like ron paul yeah</p>
<p>people think</p>
<p>ron paul is</p>
<p>absolutely crazy when the guy</p>
<p>has written he knows more</p>
<p>about economic policy than any person sitting on</p>
<p>any congressman</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very when you ever</p>
<p>think that just because people</p>
<p>think someone&rsquo;s crazy that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing that you</p>
<p>should pay attention</p>
<p>watch there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>videos of hitler</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s back before</p>
<p>world war two</p>
<p>erupted where he was talking</p>
<p>about requests from i</p>
<p>guess it was the united nations at the time</p>
<p>was asking him not to invade certain</p>
<p>countries as nazis</p>
<p>and he starts listing off the names of the</p>
<p>countries like he</p>
<p>thinks it&rsquo;s a joke</p>
<p>he says one and then he</p>
<p>pauses and then he says and this one it&rsquo;s all in german</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s saying belgium</p>
<p>and france and this and they</p>
<p>start laughing</p>
<p>their fucking</p>
<p>asses off they</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s making a joke out of the</p>
<p>fact that they didn&rsquo;t just ask him to not invade france</p>
<p>they ask him to not invade all</p>
<p>these other</p>
<p>places because they</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do it</p>
<p>and everybody starts</p>
<p>laughing you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how fucking</p>
<p>crazy people can be yeah you can never</p>
<p>think that just because the masses</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s funny that it makes sense</p>
<p>you know that the masses are</p>
<p>going along with it that it makes</p>
<p>sense most people are fucking crazy</p>
<p>the reason why society works</p>
<p>at all i mean the fact that society works at all is</p>
<p>amazing magic</p>
<p>trick it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>when you think</p>
<p>about how fucked up most people are</p>
<p>you know most people</p>
<p>but yet somehow or another all together we create this</p>
<p>magically complicated</p>
<p>society where</p>
<p>people get in fucking</p>
<p>metal tubes and fly all around the world and</p>
<p>land into these</p>
<p>electronic jungles of</p>
<p>lights and it&rsquo;s amazing it all works the way it does</p>
<p>because if it was for most people i mean it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a tiny fraction of the</p>
<p>population it&rsquo;s keeping the technological level</p>
<p>at the level that</p>
<p>it is today</p>
<p>most people are in the</p>
<p>stone age practically</p>
<p>yeah a ton of them</p>
<p>well we would be too</p>
<p>we all are a part of this</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s been created</p>
<p>by other people</p>
<p>before us i mean this is all shit from my last special</p>
<p>but i did a joke</p>
<p>about it where i said</p>
<p>if i left you</p>
<p>alone in the woods with a hatchet</p>
<p>how long before you</p>
<p>could send me an email yeah</p>
<p>probably never yeah</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know how any</p>
<p>of this shit works we just use it and we</p>
<p>turn it on that&rsquo;s why i really feel like this at some</p>
<p>point people can</p>
<p>start getting information sickness that whole</p>
<p>possible idea that</p>
<p>you know your</p>
<p>brain won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>able to cope with the</p>
<p>how fast technologies advancing</p>
<p>imagine what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like</p>
<p>right now exactly imagine what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like like a few</p>
<p>just a few hundred years from now when they</p>
<p>talk about if there are people left yeah</p>
<p>if they talk</p>
<p>about this age</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>age of change this is the really big change this</p>
<p>should breakneck</p>
<p>change because</p>
<p>things are happening faster this</p>
<p>technology is</p>
<p>changing faster than the humans who</p>
<p>consume it can absorb it</p>
<p>yeah you remember when you were a kid when they</p>
<p>started talking</p>
<p>about the days of the teletype they were</p>
<p>like whoa they figured that out they figured out how to</p>
<p>go t d d d d morse code and shit and send</p>
<p>sounds through the water and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>cause i have younger</p>
<p>two younger</p>
<p>sisters and one of them is</p>
<p>you know she&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>guess about</p>
<p>ten years younger than marymore</p>
<p>and so she grew up</p>
<p>with the internet</p>
<p>which she was like you know</p>
<p>since she could remember</p>
<p>but i i learned</p>
<p>about the internet you know kind of after</p>
<p>like midway through high school</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>stuff with it but then</p>
<p>it came like a big</p>
<p>thing in college so was like i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>learn about it i didn&rsquo;t grow up with it</p>
<p>and like the</p>
<p>the years that matter</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not like ingrained in my</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not ingrained in me but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be so much</p>
<p>smarter than us yeah</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>smart it&rsquo;s like a different sort of</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like they know</p>
<p>one thing well there&rsquo;s also all this</p>
<p>stuff they just can&rsquo;t they just can&rsquo;t do like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other things like</p>
<p>anything that takes like a long</p>
<p>amount of attention or like</p>
<p>anything it takes</p>
<p>anything outside the computer</p>
<p>world is difficult</p>
<p>difficult yeah</p>
<p>chopping wood yeah</p>
<p>coming up with the impetus to build a house right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost impossible yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s yeah it&rsquo;s weird right fuck</p>
<p>things are changing fast man this is the</p>
<p>first generation we&rsquo;ve had that&rsquo;s been all</p>
<p>on the online since</p>
