    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Stephen Kotkin,</p>
<p>his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>Stephen is one of the greatest historians of all time,</p>
<p>specializing in 20th and 21st century history</p>
<p>of Russia and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>And he has written what is widely considered</p>
<p>to be the definitive biography of Stalin in three volumes,</p>
<p>two of which have been published.</p>
<p>And the third focused on World War II</p>
<p>and the years after he is in the midst of writing now.</p>
<p>This conversation includes a response</p>
<p>to my previous podcast episode with Oliver Stone</p>
<p>that was focused on Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Stephen provides a hard hitting criticism of Putin</p>
<p>and the Russian invasion of Ukraine,</p>
<p>weighed and contextualized deeply</p>
<p>in the complex geopolitics and history of our world,</p>
<p>all with an intensity and rigor,</p>
<p>but also wit and humor that makes Stephen</p>
<p>one of my favorite human beings.</p>
<p>Please also allow me to mention something</p>
<p>that has been apparent and has weighed heavy</p>
<p>on my heart and mind.</p>
<p>This conversation with Stephen Kotkin</p>
<p>makes it more dangerous for me to travel in Russia.</p>
<p>The previous conversation with Oliver Stone</p>
<p>makes it more dangerous for me to travel in Ukraine.</p>
<p>This makes me sad, but it is the way of the world.</p>
<p>I will nevertheless travel to both Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>I need to once again see with my own eyes</p>
<p>the land of my ancestors, where they suffered but flourished</p>
<p>and eventually gave birth to say the old me.</p>
<p>I need to hear directly the pain, anger and hope</p>
<p>from both Ukrainians and Russians.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t give details to my travel plans</p>
<p>in terms of location and timing,</p>
<p>but the trip is very soon.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, I&rsquo;m truly grateful for every day I&rsquo;m alive</p>
<p>and I hope to spend each such day</p>
<p>adding a bit of love to the world.</p>
<p>I love you all.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Stephen Kotkin.</p>
<p>You are one of the great historians of our time</p>
<p>specializing in the man, the leader,</p>
<p>the historical figure of Stalin.</p>
<p>So let me ask a challenging question.</p>
<p>If you can perhaps think about the echo of 80 years</p>
<p>between Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>what are the similarities and differences</p>
<p>between the man and the historical figure,</p>
<p>the historical trajectory of Stalin and Putin?</p>
<p>Thank you, Lex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very nice to be here again with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>Good to see you.</p>
<p>Yeah, good to see you as well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking good.</p>
<p>You as well.</p>
<p>I see this podcast stuff is doing you right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t really put very easily Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>in the same sentence with Joseph Stalin.</p>
<p>Stalin is a singular figure</p>
<p>and his category is really small.</p>
<p>Hitler, Mao, that&rsquo;s really about it.</p>
<p>And even in that category, Stalin is the dominant figure,</p>
<p>both by how long he was in power</p>
<p>and also by the amount of power,</p>
<p>the military industrial complex he helped build</p>
<p>and commanded.</p>
<p>So Putin can&rsquo;t be compared to that.</p>
<p>However, Putin&rsquo;s in the same building as Stalin.</p>
<p>He uses some of the same offices as Stalin used.</p>
<p>On some of those television broadcasts</p>
<p>that we see of Putin at meetings</p>
<p>and Putin inside the Kremlin,</p>
<p>Stalin used to sit in those rooms</p>
<p>and hold meetings in those rooms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Imperial Senate</p>
<p>built by Catherine the Great in 18th century building.</p>
<p>Built by Catherine the Great in 18th century building</p>
<p>inside the Kremlin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dome building and you can see it on the panorama,</p>
<p>the top of the building,</p>
<p>at least you can see it on the panorama</p>
<p>when you look over the Kremlin wall</p>
<p>from many sites inside Moscow.</p>
<p>So if he&rsquo;s not comparable to Stalin,</p>
<p>he still works, as I said, in those same buildings,</p>
<p>those same offices, partly.</p>
<p>And so therefore, he&rsquo;s got some of the problems</p>
<p>that Stalin had,</p>
<p>which was managing Russian power in the world</p>
<p>from a position of weakness vis a vis the West,</p>
<p>but from an ambition, a grandiosity, in fact.</p>
<p>And so this combination of weakness and grandeur, right?</p>
<p>Of not being as strong as the West,</p>
<p>but aspiring to be as great or greater than the West.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dilemma of Russian history</p>
<p>for the past many centuries.</p>
<p>It was the dilemma for the Tsars.</p>
<p>It was the dilemma for Peter the Great.</p>
<p>It was the dilemma for Alexander.</p>
<p>It was the dilemma for Stalin.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the dilemma for Putin.</p>
<p>Russia is smaller now</p>
<p>compared to when Stalin was in that Kremlin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got pushed back to borders</p>
<p>almost the time of Peter the Great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s farther from the main European capitals now</p>
<p>than any time since that 18th century.</p>
<p>And the West has only grown stronger</p>
<p>in that period of time.</p>
<p>So the dilemma is greater than ever.</p>
<p>The irony of being in that position,</p>
<p>of sitting in the Kremlin,</p>
<p>trying to manage Russian power in the world,</p>
<p>trying to be a providential power,</p>
<p>a country with a special mission in the world,</p>
<p>a country which imagines itself to be a whole civilization</p>
<p>and yet not having the capabilities</p>
<p>to meet those aspirations</p>
<p>and falling farther and farther behind the West.</p>
<p>The irony of all of that is the attempted solutions</p>
<p>put Russia in a worse place every single time.</p>
<p>So you try to manage the gap with the West.</p>
<p>You try to realize these aspirations.</p>
<p>You try to raise your capabilities</p>
<p>and you build a strong state.</p>
<p>The quest to build a strong state</p>
<p>and use coercive modernization</p>
<p>to try somehow, if not to close the gap with the West,</p>
<p>at least to manage it.</p>
<p>And the result is different versions of personalist rule.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t build a strong state.</p>
<p>They build a personal dictatorship.</p>
<p>They build an autocracy.</p>
<p>And moreover, that autocracy undertakes measures</p>
<p>which then worsen the very geopolitical dilemma</p>
<p>that gave rise to this personalist rule in the first place.</p>
<p>And so I call this Russia&rsquo;s perpetual geopolitics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing about this for many, many years.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important about this analysis</p>
<p>is this is not a story of eternal Russian</p>
<p>cultural proclivity to aggression, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s in the mother&rsquo;s milk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that can&rsquo;t be changed.</p>
<p>Russia doesn&rsquo;t have an innate</p>
<p>cultural tendency to aggression.</p>
<p>This is a choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strategic choice</p>
<p>to try to match the power of the West,</p>
<p>which from Russia&rsquo;s vantage point is actually unmatchable,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a choice that&rsquo;s made again and again.</p>
<p>And Putin has made this choice,</p>
<p>just as Stalin made the choice, right?</p>
<p>Stalin presided over the World War II victory,</p>
<p>and then he lost the peace.</p>
<p>After he died in 1953,</p>
<p>there was, of course, other rulers who succeeded him.</p>
<p>He was still the most important person in the country</p>
<p>after he died,</p>
<p>because they were trying to manage that system</p>
<p>that he built, and more importantly,</p>
<p>manage that growing gap with the West.</p>
<p>By the time the 90s rolled around,</p>
<p>former Soviet troops, now Russian troops,</p>
<p>withdrew from all those advanced positions</p>
<p>that they had achieved as a result</p>
<p>of the World War II victory,</p>
<p>and it was Napoleon in reverse.</p>
<p>They went on the same roads,</p>
<p>but not from Moscow back to Paris,</p>
<p>but instead from Warsaw and from East Berlin</p>
<p>and from Tallinn and Riga and all the other places</p>
<p>of former Warsaw Pact and former Soviet republics</p>
<p>in the Baltic region.</p>
<p>They went back to Russia in retreat,</p>
<p>and so Stalin, in the fullness of time, lost the peace.</p>
<p>And Putin, in his own way, inheriting some of this,</p>
<p>attempting to reverse it when, as I said,</p>
<p>Russia was smaller, farther away, weaker,</p>
<p>the West was bigger and stronger</p>
<p>and had absorbed those former Warsaw Pact countries</p>
<p>and Baltic states,</p>
<p>because they voluntarily begged to join the West.</p>
<p>The West didn&rsquo;t impose itself on them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a voluntary sphere of influence that the West conducts.</p>
<p>And so that dilemma is where you can put Putin and Stalin</p>
<p>in the same sentence,</p>
<p>and the terrible outcome for Russia</p>
<p>in the fullness of time also has echoes.</p>
<p>But of course, Putin hasn&rsquo;t murdered 18 to 20 million people</p>
<p>and the scale of his abilities to cause grief</p>
<p>with the nuclear weapons aside is nothing like Stalin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And so we have to be careful, right?</p>
<p>Only Mao put bigger numbers on the board</p>
<p>from a tragic point of view than Stalin.</p>
<p>And numbers matter here,</p>
<p>if we compare these singular figures.</p>
<p>Yeah, Mao killed more people than Stalin</p>
<p>because Mao had more people to kill.</p>
<p>The most amazing thing about Mao</p>
<p>is he watched Stalin do it.</p>
<p>He watched Stalin collectivize agriculture</p>
<p>and famine result.</p>
<p>He watched Stalin impose this communist monopoly,</p>
<p>and all of those people sent to prison</p>
<p>or given a bullet in the back of the neck.</p>
<p>He watched all of that,</p>
<p>and then he did it again himself in China.</p>
<p>Do you think he saw the human cost directly</p>
<p>that when you say he saw,</p>
<p>do you think he was focused on the policies</p>
<p>or was he also aware distinctly as a human being</p>
<p>of the human costs in the lives of peasants</p>
<p>and in the lives of the working class and lives of the poor?</p>
<p>I think the prima facie evidence</p>
<p>is that he didn&rsquo;t value human life.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I don&rsquo;t think after seeing</p>
<p>the amount of lives that were taken</p>
<p>in the Soviet experiment,</p>
<p>he would have done something similar after that.</p>
<p>I think the answer, Lex,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s very hard to get inside Mao&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>and figure out what he was really thinking.</p>
<p>But if you just look at the results that happened,</p>
<p>the policies that were undertaken</p>
<p>and the consequences of them,</p>
<p>you would have to conclude that there was,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, no value or little value placed on human life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s characteristic</p>
<p>not only of communist dictators, right,</p>
<p>of post communist dictators as well,</p>
<p>but the scale of the horrors that they inflict,</p>
<p>as horrific as they are, just can&rsquo;t compare.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re in a situation where Eurasia,</p>
<p>that is to say the ancient civilizations of Eurasia,</p>
<p>which would be Russia, Iran, China,</p>
<p>all have some version of non democratic,</p>
<p>illiberal autocratic regimes,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all pushing up against</p>
<p>the greater power of the West in some form.</p>
<p>Sometimes they coordinate their actions</p>
<p>and sometimes they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But this is a very longstanding phenomenon, Lex,</p>
<p>that predates Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping</p>
<p>or the latest incarnation of the supreme leader in Iran.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about this, I think,</p>
<p>really powerful framework of five dimensions</p>
<p>of authoritarian regimes that you&rsquo;ve put together.</p>
<p>But first, let&rsquo;s go to this Napoleon</p>
<p>and reverse retreat from Warsaw back.</p>
<p>Putin has called, from the perspective of Putin,</p>
<p>this retreat, this collapse of Stalin</p>
<p>is one of the great tragedies of that region, of Russia.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a sense where as Putin sits now</p>
<p>in power for 22 plus years,</p>
<p>he really dreams of a return to the power,</p>
<p>the influence, the land of Stalin?</p>
<p>So while you said that they&rsquo;re not in the same place</p>
<p>in terms of the numbers of people</p>
<p>that suffer due to their regime,</p>
<p>do you think he hopes to have the same power,</p>
<p>the same influence for a nation</p>
<p>that was in the 30s, in the 40s, in the 50s</p>
<p>of the 20th century under Stalin?</p>
<p>If he does, Lex, he&rsquo;s deluding himself.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know for sure.</p>
<p>Very few people talk to him.</p>
<p>Very few people have access to him.</p>
<p>A handful of Western leaders have met with him</p>
<p>for short periods of time.</p>
<p>Those inside Russia barely meet with him.</p>
<p>His own minions in the regime barely have FaceTime with him.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly what he thinks.</p>
<p>It could be that he has delusions</p>
<p>of reconquering Russian influence,</p>
<p>if not direct control over the territories that broke away,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about this guy, Nikolai Patrushev.</p>
<p>Nikolai Patrushev is probably not well known</p>
<p>to your listeners.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the head of Russia&rsquo;s Security Council.</p>
<p>And so you could probably call him the second most important</p>
<p>or second most powerful man in Russia,</p>
<p>certainly inside the regime.</p>
<p>Arguably, Navalny is the second most important person</p>
<p>in the country and Russia is the second most powerful man</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about that later, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>In terms of influence, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, but Patrushev is a version of Putin&rsquo;s right hand man.</p>
<p>And Patrushev has been giving interviews in the press.</p>
<p>You probably saw the interview</p>
<p>with Nizavisimaya Gazeta not that long ago.</p>
<p>He writes also his own blog like interventions</p>
<p>in the public sphere using the few channels that are left.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting about Patrushev,</p>
<p>and this could well reflect similar thinking to Putin&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>which is why I&rsquo;m bringing this up,</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;s got this conspiratorial theory</p>
<p>that the West has been on a forever campaign</p>
<p>to destroy Russia,</p>
<p>just like it destroyed the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and that everything the West does</p>
<p>is meant to dismember Russia</p>
<p>and that Russia is fighting an existential battle</p>
<p>against the West.</p>
<p>And so for example, the CIA and the American government</p>
<p>wanted to bring down the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Nevermind that the Bush administration,</p>
<p>the first Bush, the father,</p>
<p>was trying desperately to hold the Soviet Union together</p>
<p>because they were afraid of the chaos that might ensue</p>
<p>and the nukes that might get loose</p>
<p>as a result of a Soviet collapse.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t until the very last moment</p>
<p>where Bush decided, his administration decided</p>
<p>to back those Republican leaders</p>
<p>who were breaking away from Mikhail Gorbachev</p>
<p>and the Soviet Union, right?</p>
<p>So nevermind the empirics of it.</p>
<p>Nevermind that Bill Clinton&rsquo;s administration</p>
<p>following George Bush sent boatloads of money,</p>
<p>Western taxpayer money to Russia.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly how much</p>
<p>because it came from different sources.</p>
<p>People talk about how there was no Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>It was tens of billions of dollars from various sources,</p>
<p>from the IMF and other sources.</p>
<p>And next it disappeared, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Just like the German money that went to Gorbachev</p>
<p>for unification disappeared</p>
<p>even before the Soviet collapsed.</p>
<p>The money disappeared, but the West sent the money.</p>
<p>So how was that a plot?</p>
<p>And then you could go all the way, Obama&rsquo;s administration,</p>
<p>George Bush trying to do business deals</p>
<p>and reset the relations and Obama administration</p>
<p>trying to reset the relations</p>
<p>and doing nothing after the Georgian war</p>
<p>and slapping Putin on the wrist,</p>
<p>following the seizure force of Putin.</p>
<p>And you could go on and you could go on</p>
<p>all the way through the Trump administration</p>
<p>telling Putin that he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Trump believes Putin and doesn&rsquo;t believe US intelligence</p>
<p>about Russian efforts to interfere</p>
<p>in American domestic politics.</p>
<p>So despite all the empirics of it,</p>
<p>you have Patrushev and likely Putin</p>
<p>talking about this multi decade Western conspiracy</p>
<p>to bring Russia down.</p>
<p>At the same time as that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>the Germans are voluntarily increasing</p>
<p>their dependence on Russian energy,</p>
<p>voluntarily increasing their dependence on Russia.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the conspiracy to bring Russia down.</p>
<p>The French who fantasize about themselves</p>
<p>as a diplomatic superpower are constantly,</p>
<p>the French leaders are constantly running to the Kremlin</p>
<p>to ask what Russia needs,</p>
<p>what concessions from the West Russia needs to be filled</p>
<p>to feel respected again.</p>
<p>The British provide all manner of money laundering</p>
<p>and reputation laundering services</p>
<p>for the whole Russian oligarchy,</p>
<p>including the state officials who are looting the state</p>
<p>and using the West British institutions</p>
<p>to launder their money.</p>
<p>So all of this is happening and yet Patrushev imagines</p>
<p>this conspiracy to bring Russia down by the West.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got in the Kremlin again.</p>
<p>Stalin had that same conspiratorial mentality of the West.</p>
<p>Everything that happened in the world</p>
<p>was part of a Western conspiracy</p>
<p>directed against the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and now directed against Russia.</p>
<p>Even though the West is trying to appease,</p>
<p>the West is offering its services,</p>
<p>the West is trying to change Russia through investment</p>
<p>in a positive way, but instead the West is what&rsquo;s changing.</p>
<p>The West is becoming more corrupt.</p>
<p>Western services are being corrupted</p>
<p>by the relationship with Russia.</p>
<p>So you have to ask yourself,</p>
<p>who are these people in power in the Kremlin</p>
<p>who imagine that while they&rsquo;re availing themselves</p>
<p>of every service and every blandishment of the West,</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re availing themselves of this,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re fighting a conspiracy by the West</p>
<p>to bring them down.</p>
<p>So this is what they call the Abyssinia in Russian,</p>
<p>which is a term, as you know,</p>
<p>that means those who are resentful,</p>
<p>or you might call them the losers,</p>
<p>the losers in the transition.</p>
<p>So when the Soviet Union fell</p>
<p>and there was a very substantial diminution</p>
<p>in Russian power and influence in the world,</p>
<p>a lot of people lost out.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t able to steal the property.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t able to loot the state in the 90s.</p>
<p>And they were on the outside.</p>
<p>They gradually came back in.</p>
<p>They were the losers in the transition domestically.</p>
<p>And for them, they wanted to reverse</p>
<p>being on the losing side.</p>
<p>And so they began to expropriate, to steal the money,</p>
<p>steal the property from those first thieves</p>
<p>who stole in the 90s.</p>
<p>And the 2000s and on have been about restealing,</p>
<p>taking the losers in the transition,</p>
<p>taking the money from the winners</p>
<p>and reversing this resentment, this loser status.</p>
<p>Those are your Patrushevs and your Putins.</p>
<p>But at the same time, this blows out</p>
<p>to let&rsquo;s reverse the losses, being on the losing side,</p>
<p>the roiling resentment</p>
<p>at the decline of their power internationally.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to reverse that too.</p>
<p>So you have a profound psychological whole generation</p>
<p>of people who are on the losing end domestically</p>
<p>and reverse that domestically.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the Putin regime is about.</p>
<p>Remember Mikhail Khodorkovsky&rsquo;s Yukos?</p>
<p>Remember all the companies that are now owned</p>
<p>by Putin cronies because they were taken away</p>
<p>from whoever stole them in the first place.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re trying to do that on the international scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to put domestic opponents in jail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to take away someone&rsquo;s property domestically,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not gonna reverse the power of the West</p>
<p>with the diminished Russia that you have.</p>
<p>And so that project, that Patrushev project,</p>
<p>which we see him expressing again and again,</p>
<p>he speaks about it publicly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that we need to go looking for,</p>
<p>a quest, the secret, we can&rsquo;t find it.</p>
<p>What are they thinking?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right there in front of our face.</p>
<p>And Putin has spoken the same way for a long time.</p>
<p>People point to the 2007 speech</p>
<p>at the Munich Security Conference</p>
<p>that Putin delivered, and certainly your listeners</p>
<p>could use a snippet or two of that,</p>
<p>just like they could use a couple of quotes</p>
<p>from Patrushev to contextualize what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But it predates the 2007 Munich speech,</p>
<p>the reaction to Ukraine&rsquo;s uprising in 2004,</p>
<p>attempt to steal the election inside Ukraine,</p>
<p>which the Ukrainian people rose up valiantly</p>
<p>against and risked their lives and overturned, right?</p>
<p>So there were public statements from Putin already back then,</p>
<p>the statements about Khodorkovsky in 2003</p>
<p>when he was arrested and expropriated.</p>
<p>This is a longstanding deeply psychological issue,</p>
<p>which is about managing Russian power in the world,</p>
<p>as I was saying, the gap with the West,</p>
<p>but has this further dimension of feeling like losers</p>
<p>and wanting to reverse that, that&rsquo;s their life experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be a zhenei.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that resentment that fuels this narrative,</p>
<p>fuels this geopolitics and internal policy.</p>
<p>But so resentment is behind some of the worst things</p>
<p>that have ever been done in human history.</p>
<p>Hitler was probably fueled by resentment.</p>
<p>So resentment is a really powerful force, yes.</p>
<p>Just to maybe not push back,</p>
<p>but to give fuller context on the West,</p>
<p>you said there&rsquo;s a narrative from Putin&rsquo;s Russia</p>
<p>that the West is somehow an enemy,</p>
<p>you position everything against the West,</p>
<p>but is there a degree and to what degree</p>
<p>is the West willing to feed that narrative?</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s also convenient for the West to have an enemy.</p>
<p>It seems like in the place, in the span,</p>
<p>it seems like in geopolitics,</p>
<p>having an enemy is useful for forming a narrative.</p>
<p>Now, having an enemy for the basic respect of humanity</p>
<p>is not good, but in terms of maintaining power,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a leader in a game of geopolitics,</p>
<p>it seems to be good to have an enemy.</p>
<p>It seems to be good to have something like a cold war.</p>
<p>We can always point your finger and says,</p>
<p>all our actions are fighting this evil,</p>
<p>whatever that evil is.</p>
<p>It could be like with George W. Bush, the war on terror.</p>
<p>Terrorism is this evil.</p>
<p>You can always point at something.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve made it seem that the West is trying.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of forces within the West</p>
<p>that are trying to reach out a friendly hand,</p>
<p>trying to help, sending money, sending compassion,</p>
<p>trying to sort of.</p>
<p>Trying to integrate Russia into a global institution.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Which was a longstanding multi decade effort</p>
<p>across multiple countries</p>
<p>and multiple administrations in those countries.</p>
<p>But is there also warmongers on the West?</p>
<p>Of course, Lex.</p>
<p>Of course you&rsquo;re right about that.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>People talk about the cold war</p>
<p>and they usually looking to assign blame for the cold war</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s some kind of mistake, a misunderstanding,</p>
<p>or a search for an enemy that was convenient</p>
<p>to rally domestic politics.</p>
<p>So Lex, there&rsquo;s a coup in Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>and somebody installs a communist regime in February 1948.</p>
<p>No reaction to that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just okay?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a blockade of Berlin.</p>
<p>Is that cool by you?</p>
<p>Where they try to strangle West Berlin</p>
<p>so that they can swallow West Berlin</p>
<p>and add it to East Berlin.</p>
<p>You cool with that?</p>
<p>How about Korean War, invasion of North Korea,</p>
<p>invasion of South Korea by North Korea?</p>
<p>You cool with that?</p>
<p>How about the murders and the show trials</p>
<p>up and down Eastern Europe in the late 40s</p>
<p>after the imposition of the clone regimes?</p>
<p>You good with that?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very convenient to have an enemy.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>But you know, there was some actions, Lex.</p>
<p>There was some threats to people&rsquo;s freedom.</p>
<p>There was some invasions.</p>
<p>There was some aggression and violence on a mass scale,</p>
<p>like collectivization of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>And we could go on, Lex, with the examples.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just giving a few of them.</p>
<p>And so the Cold War was not a mistake.</p>
<p>It was not a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to blame someone for the Cold War.</p>
<p>We have to give credit for the Cold War.</p>
<p>The Truman administration deserves credit</p>
<p>for standing up to Stalin&rsquo;s regime,</p>
<p>for standing up to these actions,</p>
<p>for saying, yeah, we&rsquo;re not just gonna take this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna let this go on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna let this expand to further territories.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna create the NATO alliance.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna rally democratic liberal regimes</p>
<p>to stand up to this illiberalism,</p>
<p>this violence, and this aggression.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, Lex, it&rsquo;s always convenient to have an enemy.</p>
<p>But there was an enemy.</p>
<p>Nikolai Leonov, who recently died,</p>
<p>he died in April 2022, and he had a major funeral.</p>
<p>He was the last head analyst of the Soviet KGB.</p>
<p>And Leonov is one of the most important figures</p>
<p>for understanding the Soviet collapse.</p>
<p>And he has the best memoir on the Soviet collapse,</p>
<p>which is known in Russian as Likholetya.</p>
<p>You will understand that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll help your podcast listeners understand.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a singularity to that kind of expression, Likholetya.</p>
<p>Leonov just died.</p>
<p>But one of the things, and in fact,</p>
<p>the people who were supposedly arrested by Putin</p>
<p>as scapegoats for the Ukraine war,</p>
<p>the main one, Sergei Beseda, gave the eulogy</p>
<p>at Leonov&rsquo;s funeral in April 2022,</p>
<p>showing that it&rsquo;s a lie that all of these people</p>
<p>have been arrested and purged</p>
<p>and other nonsense in social media.</p>
<p>But to get back to what Leonov said</p>
<p>and get back to your enemy point, Leonov said,</p>
<p>you know, the West spent all this time</p>
<p>blackening the image of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>All these resources and propaganda and covert operations</p>
<p>to blacken the Soviet image.</p>
<p>And they did, Lex, the West did do that.</p>
<p>And then Leonov wrote in the next sentence,</p>
<p>and you know what?</p>
<p>We gave them a lot of material to work with</p>
<p>to blacken our image.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re saying a kind of sobering reality,</p>
<p>which it is possible to some degree to draw a line</p>
<p>between the good guys and the bad guys.</p>
<p>Freedom is better than unfreedom, Lex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot better than unfreedom,</p>
<p>and a guy like you understands that really well.</p>
<p>Well, so yes, but those are all, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s words like justice, freedom.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>Love, you can use a lot of words that Hitler himself used</p>
<p>to describe why he is actually creating a better world</p>
<p>than those he&rsquo;s fighting.</p>
<p>So some of it is propaganda.</p>
<p>The question is on the ground,</p>
<p>what is actually increasing the amount of freedom</p>
<p>in the world, human prosperity?</p>
<p>Institutions, Lex, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about propaganda here.</p>
<p>When we use words like freedom,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about rule of law.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about protection of civil liberties.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about protection of private property.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about an independent</p>
<p>and well funded judiciary.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about an impartial, non corrupt,</p>
<p>competent civil service.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about separation of powers</p>
<p>where the executive branch&rsquo;s power is limited,</p>
<p>usually by an elected parliament.</p>
<p>In fact, yes, let&rsquo;s talk about elections.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about freedom of speech</p>
<p>and freedom of the public sphere.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about freedom as a slogan here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a huge array of institutions</p>
<p>and practices and norms ultimately, right?</p>
<p>And if they exist, you know, and you live under them.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>you fully understand that as well, right?</p>
<p>Ukraine was a flawed democracy before Russia invaded.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s utterly corrupt, many ways dysfunctional,</p>
<p>especially the elites were dysfunctional.</p>
<p>The gas industry in Ukraine was absolutely terrible</p>
<p>because of the corruption that it generated,</p>
<p>the oligarch problem,</p>
<p>a handful of people stealing the state resources.</p>
<p>And yet Ukraine had an open public sphere</p>
<p>and it had a parliament that functioned.</p>
<p>And so despite its flaws, it was still a democracy.</p>
<p>The regime in Moscow, you can&rsquo;t say that Lex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a comparable regime to Ukraine.</p>
<p>You could say, oh, well, there were oligarchs in Ukraine</p>
<p>and there were oligarchs in Russia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s corruption in Ukraine, there&rsquo;s corruption in Russia.</p>
<p>So really what&rsquo;s the big difference?</p>
<p>And the answer is, well, Ukraine had the open public sphere.</p>
<p>Ukraine had a real parliament.</p>
<p>Can you call Russia&rsquo;s Duma a real parliament?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can.</p>
<p>Can you say that there were any checks whatsoever</p>
<p>on the executive branch in Russia?</p>
<p>Can you say that the Russian judiciary had any independence</p>
<p>or really full level of competence</p>
<p>even compared to the Ukrainian judiciary,</p>
<p>which was nothing to brag about?</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t say that Lex.</p>
<p>So we can differentiate between the very flawed,</p>
<p>corrupt oligarchic democracy in Ukraine</p>
<p>and the very corrupt oligarchic autocracy in Russia.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a fair distinction.</p>
<p>Yeah, we should say that Russia and Ukraine</p>
<p>have the great honor of being the number one</p>
<p>and the number two most corrupt nations in Europe</p>
<p>by many measures.</p>
<p>But there is a fundamental difference,</p>
<p>as you were highlighting.</p>
<p>Russia is a corrupt autocracy.</p>
<p>Ukraine, we can say, is a corrupt democracy.</p>
<p>And to that level, there&rsquo;s a fundamental difference.</p>
<p>Ukraine is not murdering its own journalists</p>
<p>in systematic fashion.</p>
<p>If journalists are killed in Ukraine, it&rsquo;s a tragedy.</p>
<p>If journalists are killed in Russia</p>
<p>or Russian journalists are killed abroad,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s regime policy.</p>
<p>And the degree to which a nation is authoritarian</p>
<p>means that it&rsquo;s suffocating its own spirit,</p>
<p>its capacity to flourish.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not just talking about sort of the freedom</p>
<p>of the press, those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but basically all industries get suffocated</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re no longer being able to,</p>
<p>yeah, flourish as a nation, grow the production,</p>
<p>the GDP, the scientists, the art, the culture,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yes, Lex, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>And so before the invasion, the full blown invasion</p>
<p>of February 2022 into Ukraine, because as you know,</p>
<p>the war has been going on for many years at a lower level</p>
<p>compared to what it is these days,</p>
<p>but still a tragic war with many deaths</p>
<p>prior to February 2022.</p>
<p>Before this latest war, we could have said</p>
<p>that the greatest victims of the Putin regime</p>
<p>are Russian, domestic, that the people</p>
<p>who are suffering the most from the Putin regime</p>
<p>are not sitting here in New York City,</p>
<p>but in fact are sitting there in Russia.</p>
<p>Now, of course, with the invasion of Ukraine</p>
<p>and really the atrocities that have been well documented</p>
<p>and more are being investigated,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t easily say anymore that Russians</p>
<p>are the greatest victims of the Putin regime,</p>
<p>but in ways other than bombing and murdering civilians,</p>
<p>children, mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers,</p>
<p>after you include that, then of course,</p>
<p>the larger number of victims of the Putin regime</p>
<p>are not Ukrainians, but ultimately Russians,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s how many of them now that have fled?</p>
<p>So your powerful, precise, rigorous words</p>
<p>are then in a stark contrast, I would say,</p>
<p>to my very recent conversation with Oliver Stone,</p>
<p>and I would love you to elaborate this agreement</p>
<p>you have here with his words and maybe words</p>
<p>of people like John Mearsheimer.</p>
<p>The idea is that Putin&rsquo;s hand in this invasion of 2022</p>
<p>was forced by the expansion of NATO,</p>
<p>the imperialist imperative of the United States</p>
<p>and the NATO forces.</p>
<p>You disagree with this point in terms of placing the blame</p>
<p>somehow on the invasion on forces larger</p>
<p>than the particular two nations involved,</p>
<p>but more on the geopolitics of the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s driven by the most powerful military nation</p>
<p>in the world, which is the United States.</p>
<p>Yeah, Lex, so let&rsquo;s imagine that a tragedy&rsquo;s happened here</p>
<p>in New York, and a woman got raped.</p>
<p>We know the perpetrator.</p>
<p>They go to trial, and Oliver Stone gets up and says,</p>
<p>you know what?</p>
<p>The woman was wearing a short skirt,</p>
<p>and there was no option but for the rapist to rape her.</p>
<p>The woman was wearing lipstick,</p>
<p>or the woman was applying for NATO membership</p>
<p>and just had to be raped.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I mean, didn&rsquo;t want to rape her,</p>
<p>but was compelled because of what she was doing</p>
<p>and what she looked like and the clothes she was wearing</p>
<p>and the alliances that she was under international law</p>
<p>signed by Moscow, all the treaties</p>
<p>that sovereign countries get to choose</p>
<p>whatever alliance they belong to.</p>
<p>The treaties that the UN Charter signed by Russia,</p>
<p>Soviet Union, the 1975 Helsinki Agreement</p>
<p>signed by the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe</p>
<p>signed by the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>the 1997 NATO Russia Founding Act</p>
<p>signed by the Russian government, the post Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>All of those documents signed by either the Soviet regime</p>
<p>or the Russian regime,</p>
<p>which is the legally recognized international inheritor,</p>
<p>right, successor of the Soviet state.</p>
<p>All of those agreements are still in force</p>
<p>and all of them say that countries are sovereign</p>
<p>and can freely choose their foreign policy</p>
<p>and what alliances they want to join.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s even go farther than that.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t have to go farther than that,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s go farther than that, Lex.</p>
<p>Is an autocratic repressive regime</p>
<p>that invades its neighbors in the name of its own security</p>
<p>something new in Russian history?</p>
<p>Did we not see this before?</p>
<p>Is this, does this not predate NATO expansion?</p>
<p>Does this not predate the existence of NATO?</p>
<p>Would Oliver Stone sit here in this chair and say to you,</p>
<p>you know, they had to impose serfdom in the 17th century</p>
<p>because NATO expanded.</p>
<p>They had no choice, their hands were tied.</p>
<p>They were compelled to treat their own population</p>
<p>like slaves because, you know, NATO expanded.</p>
<p>I mean, I could go on through the examples</p>
<p>of Russian history that predate the existence,</p>
<p>let alone the expansion of NATO,</p>
<p>where you have behavior, policies, actions,</p>
<p>very similar to what we see now from the Kremlin.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t explain those by NATO expansion, can you?</p>
<p>And so that argument doesn&rsquo;t wash for me</p>
<p>because I have a pattern here that predates NATO expansion.</p>
<p>I have international agreements, founding documents,</p>
<p>signed by the Kremlin over many, many decades</p>
<p>acknowledging the freedom of countries</p>
<p>to choose their alliances.</p>
<p>And then I have this problem where when you rape somebody,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re wearing a short skirt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you have raped them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve committed a criminal act, Lex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people listening to this</p>
<p>that will agree to the emotion, the power,</p>
<p>and the spirit of this metaphor.</p>
<p>And I was struggling to think how to dance</p>
<p>within this metaphor because it feels like</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t precisely the right one,</p>
<p>but I think it captures the spirit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting, Lex, that everything the West has done</p>
<p>has been honorable or intelligent.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we live in a democracy.</p>
<p>We live in liberal regimes.</p>
<p>We live under rule of law,</p>
<p>liberal in the classical sense of rule of law,</p>
<p>not liberal in the leftist sense.</p>
<p>We live in places like that and we can criticize ourselves.</p>
<p>And we can criticize the mistakes that we made</p>
<p>or the policy choices or the inactions that were taken.</p>
<p>And there are a whole lot of things to answer for.</p>
<p>And you can now discuss the ones that are your favorites,</p>
<p>the dishonor or the mistakes.</p>
<p>And I could discuss mine and we could spend</p>
<p>the whole rest of our meeting today</p>
<p>discussing the West&rsquo;s mistakes and problems.</p>
<p>And we won&rsquo;t end up in prison for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, Lex, and so I&rsquo;m thankful for that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thankful that people may disagree</p>
<p>and that people make the argument</p>
<p>that NATO expansion is to blame.</p>
<p>But you see, I&rsquo;m countering two arguments here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m countering one argument,</p>
<p>which is very deeply popular, pervasive,</p>
<p>about how Russia has this cultural tendency to aggression.</p>
<p>And it can help, but invade its neighbors</p>
<p>and it does it again and again.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s eternal Russian imperialism</p>
<p>and you have to watch out for it.</p>
<p>This very popular argument in the Baltic States,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really popular in Warsaw.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really popular with the liberal interventionists</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very, very popular with those</p>
<p>who were part of the Iraq war squad</p>
<p>that got us into that mess.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m against that.</p>
<p>And the reason I&rsquo;m against it is because it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s empirically false.</p>
<p>There is no cultural trait,</p>
<p>inherent tendency for Russia to be aggressive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strategic choice that they make.</p>
<p>Every time it&rsquo;s a choice made,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not some kind of momentum.</p>
<p>Every time it&rsquo;s a choice that we should judge</p>
<p>for the choice that it is for the decision.</p>
<p>And therefore they could make different choices.</p>
<p>They could say, we don&rsquo;t have to stand up to the West.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the capabilities to do that.</p>
<p>We can still be a great country.</p>
<p>We can still be a civilization unto itself.</p>
<p>We can still be Russia.</p>
<p>We can still worship in Orthodox cathedrals</p>
<p>or we can still be ourselves,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have to pursue this chimerical pursuit,</p>
<p>this elusive quest to stand up to the West</p>
<p>and be in the first ranks of powers.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m countering that argument.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s perpetual geopolitics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a geopolitical choice rising out of this dilemma</p>
<p>of the mismatch between aspirations and capabilities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not eternal Russian imperialism.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also countering the other argument here, Lex,</p>
<p>which is to say that it&rsquo;s the West&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Western imperialism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very popular on the left,</p>
<p>very popular with realist scholars,</p>
<p>very popular with some of the people</p>
<p>recently on your podcast.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s neither eternal Russian imperialism</p>
<p>nor is it Western imperialism, right?</p>
<p>The mere fact that the West is stronger than Russia</p>
<p>is not a crime on the part of the West.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a crime that countries voluntarily</p>
<p>wanna join the West, that beg to get in,</p>
<p>either the EU or NATO or other bilateral alliances</p>
<p>or other trade agreements.</p>
<p>Those are voluntarily entered into and that&rsquo;s not criminal.</p>
<p>If the West&rsquo;s sphere of influence,</p>
<p>which is open, an open sphere of influence,</p>
<p>which as I say, people voluntarily join,</p>
<p>if that expands, that&rsquo;s not a crime,</p>
<p>nor is that a threat to Russia, ipso facto, right?</p>
<p>NATO is a defensive alliance</p>
<p>and the countries are largely pacifists</p>
<p>who are members of NATO.</p>
<p>And NATO doesn&rsquo;t attack,</p>
<p>it defends members if they are attacked.</p>
<p>And so the idea that Ukraine, which had the legal right,</p>
<p>might wanna join NATO and the EU,</p>
<p>which was not gonna happen in our lifetimes</p>
<p>and was not a direct threat to the Putin regime</p>
<p>since the Western countries that make up the EU and NATO</p>
<p>decided that Ukraine was not ready for membership,</p>
<p>there was no consensus, it was not gonna happen,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s Ukraine&rsquo;s free choice to express that desire.</p>
<p>And if your government is elected by your people,</p>
<p>freely elected, meaning you can unelect that government</p>
<p>in the next election,</p>
<p>and that government makes foreign policy choices</p>
<p>on the basis of its perceived interests,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a crime, Lex, that&rsquo;s not a provocation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not something that compels the leader</p>
<p>of another country to invade you, right?</p>
<p>That is legal under international law,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also a realist fact of life.</p>
<p>The realists like to tell you that Russia here</p>
<p>was disrespected, Russia&rsquo;s interests were not taken</p>
<p>into account, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>but the real world works in such a way</p>
<p>that treaties matter, that international law matters.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people like me were not in favor</p>
<p>of the US 2003 invasion of Iraq, Lex,</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t legal, in addition to the fact</p>
<p>that we thought it might backfire.</p>
<p>But you know, Lex, like I said, there are a lot of things</p>
<p>about the West that we ought to criticize as citizens,</p>
<p>and we do criticize, but we have to be clear</p>
<p>about where responsibility lies in these events</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about today.</p>
<p>So you get into trouble, it&rsquo;s largely erroneous</p>
<p>to think about both the West or the United States</p>
<p>from an imperialist perspective and Russia</p>
<p>from an imperialist perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better, clearer to think about each individual</p>
<p>aggressive decision on its own as a choice that was made.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the most recent choice</p>
<p>made by Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>The choice to invade Ukraine, or to escalate</p>
<p>the invasion of Ukraine on February 24th, 2022.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re a few months removed from that decision,</p>
<p>initial decision, why do you think he did it?</p>
<p>What are the errors in understanding the situation,</p>
<p>in calculating the outcomes, and everything else</p>
<p>about this decision in your view?</p>
<p>Yeah, Lex, when a war doesn&rsquo;t go well,</p>
<p>it looks like lunacy to have launched it in the first place.</p>
<p>Does it ever go well?</p>
<p>War never goes according to plan.</p>
<p>All war is based upon miscalculation,</p>
<p>but not everybody is punished for their miscalculation.</p>
<p>All aggressive war we&rsquo;re talking about, not defensive war,</p>
<p>is based upon miscalculation.</p>
<p>But you can adjust, you can recalibrate.</p>
<p>You know, when you&rsquo;re driving down the road</p>
<p>and that very annoying voice is telling you</p>
<p>in a thousand feet, make a right,</p>
<p>and you fail to make a right, it recalibrates, right?</p>
<p>It tells you, okay, now go turn around,</p>
<p>or U turn, or make a left.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re an idiot in turn around</p>
<p>and make a U turn, but it does recalibrate.</p>
<p>So you can miscalculate, and the problem</p>
<p>is not the miscalculation usually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the failure to do that adjustment, right?</p>
<p>People I know who are hedge fund traders,</p>
<p>I ask them, you know, what&rsquo;s your favorite trade?</p>
<p>And the line from the mall, and this is a cliche,</p>
<p>is my favorite trade is when I made a mistake,</p>
<p>but I got out early before all the carnage.</p>
<p>So their favorite trade is not when they made</p>
<p>some brilliant choice, but it&rsquo;s when they miscalculated</p>
<p>but they reduce the consequences of their miscalculation</p>
<p>by recalibrating quickly, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the calculation</p>
<p>and miscalculation of February.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine, Lex, that you&rsquo;ve been getting away</p>
<p>with murder, I don&rsquo;t mean murder in a figurative sense.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve been murdering people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been murdering them domestically,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been murdering them all across Europe,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been murdering them not just with, for example,</p>
<p>a car accident, a staged car accident,</p>
<p>or using a handgun, you use Novichok,</p>
<p>or you use some other internationally outlawed</p>
<p>chemical weapon.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s imagine that you did it</p>
<p>and nothing happened to you.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like you were removed from power,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t like you paid a personal price.</p>
<p>Sure, maybe there was some sanctions on your economy,</p>
<p>but you didn&rsquo;t pay the price of those sanctions.</p>
<p>Little people paid the price of those sanctions.</p>
<p>Other people in your country paid the price.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine not only were you murdering people literally,</p>
<p>but you decided to entice the idiotic ruler of Georgia</p>
<p>into a provocation that you could then invade the country.</p>
<p>And you invaded the country</p>
<p>and you bit off these territories,</p>
<p>Abkhazia and South Ossetia,</p>
<p>and what price did you pay for that?</p>
<p>And then you decided, you know,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll now invade Crimea and forcibly annex Crimea,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll instigate an insurrection in the Donbass</p>
<p>in Eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>In Luhansk. Let&rsquo;s imagine you did all that</p>
<p>and then you had to stick out your wrist</p>
<p>so that, you know, it could be slapped a couple of times.</p>
<p>And you said, you know, I can pretty much do what I want.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re putting a sanction here and there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing this and they&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more energy dependent on me than before.</p>
<p>I got better money laundering and reputation services</p>
<p>than anybody had.</p>
<p>Maybe the Middle East and the Chinese would disagree with you</p>
<p>that you have better than them, but yours are pretty good.</p>
<p>And the Panama Papers get released,</p>
<p>revealing all of your offshoring and your corruption</p>
<p>and what happened, nothing happens, Lex.</p>
<p>So the first and most important consideration here is,</p>
<p>in your own mind, you&rsquo;ve been getting away with murder,</p>
<p>literally, as well as figuratively,</p>
<p>and you think, you know,</p>
<p>I probably should have done that.</p>
<p>You think, you know, I probably can do something again</p>
<p>and get away with it.</p>
<p>And so the failure to respond at scale,</p>
<p>in fact, the indulgences,</p>
<p>the further dependencies that are introduced,</p>
<p>the illusion that trade is the mechanism</p>
<p>to manage authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>You know, that great German cliche,</p>
<p>Wandel durch Handel, right, change through trade</p>
<p>or transformation through trade,</p>
<p>one of Angela Merkel&rsquo;s favorite expressions, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get the other side to be better</p>
<p>rather than confront them in a Cold War fashion</p>
<p>where you stand up to their aggressions</p>
<p>and you punish them severely</p>
<p>in order to deter further behavior.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first and most important part</p>
<p>of the calculation, miscalculation.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other dimensions.</p>
<p>So can we pause on that really quick?</p>
<p>So this is kind of idea of it&rsquo;s okay to crack a few eggs</p>
<p>to make an omelet, which is a more generous description</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t incorporate into the calculation</p>
<p>the amount of human suffering that the decisions cause,</p>
<p>but instead you look at sort of the success</p>
<p>based on some kind of measure for you personally</p>
<p>and for the nation, not in terms of in a humanitarian sense,</p>
<p>but in some kind of economic sense</p>
<p>and a geopolitical power sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re not sentimental, Lex.</p>
<p>You say to yourself, the cause of Russian greatness</p>
<p>is greater than any individual life.</p>
<p>Russia being in the first rank of the great powers,</p>
<p>Russia realizing its mission to be a special country</p>
<p>with a special mission in the world,</p>
<p>a civilization unto itself,</p>
<p>the first rank of the great powers,</p>
<p>maybe even the greatest power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s worth the price that we have to pay,</p>
<p>especially in other people&rsquo;s lives, right?</p>
<p>We have a lot of literature on the Putin regime,</p>
<p>which talks about the kleptocracy,</p>
<p>the place is a kleptocracy, and it is a kleptocracy.</p>
<p>We all can see that, and anybody in London,</p>
<p>living the high life, servicing this kleptocracy</p>
<p>can testify that it&rsquo;s a kleptocracy,</p>
<p>and not only in London, of course,</p>
<p>right here in the United States, in New York.</p>
<p>But you know, it&rsquo;s not only a kleptocracy, Lex.</p>
<p>That was the problem of the Russian studies literature.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just about stealing, looting the state.</p>
<p>It was about Russian greatness.</p>
<p>You see those rituals in the Kremlin,</p>
<p>right in the Grand Kremlin Palace,</p>
<p>in the St. George&rsquo;s Hall,</p>
<p>some of the greatest interiors in the world,</p>
<p>and you see award ceremonies, and you see marking holidays,</p>
<p>and all of these looters of the state</p>
<p>have their uniforms on with their medals,</p>
<p>and someone&rsquo;s given a speech or singing</p>
<p>a ballad, and their eyes are moist.</p>
<p>Their eyes are moist because they&rsquo;re thieves and looters?</p>
<p>No, Lex, because they believe in Russian greatness.</p>
<p>They have a deep and fundamental passionate commitment</p>
<p>to the greatness of Russia,</p>
<p>which in unsentimental fashion,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all sentimental to the max.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why their eyes are moistening.</p>
<p>But they imagine unsentimentally that any sacrifice is okay,</p>
<p>a sacrifice of other people&rsquo;s lives,</p>
<p>a sacrifice of their conscripts in the military,</p>
<p>a sacrifice of Ukrainian women and children and elderly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a small price to pay for those moist eyes</p>
<p>about Russian greatness and Russia&rsquo;s position in the world.</p>
<p>Well, that human thing, that sentimentality,</p>
<p>is the thing that can get us in trouble</p>
<p>in the United States as well,</p>
<p>and lead us to wars, the illegal wars and so on.</p>
<p>But the United States,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s repercussions for breaking the law.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to pay for illegal wars in the end.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying that in authoritarian regimes,</p>
<p>the sentimentality can really get out of hand,</p>
<p>and you can, by charismatic leaders,</p>
<p>they can take that to manipulate the populace to make,</p>
<p>that in the span of history led to atrocities,</p>
<p>and in today&rsquo;s world, lead to humanitarian crises.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the kleptocracy, it&rsquo;s a belief system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s passion, it&rsquo;s conviction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you can call them illusions,</p>
<p>you can call them fantasies,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call them, they&rsquo;re real.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re real for those people.</p>
<p>And so yes, they&rsquo;re looting that very state</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re trying to make</p>
<p>one of the great powers in the world.</p>
<p>And they resent the fact that the West</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge them as one of those great powers.</p>
<p>And they resent that the West is more powerful.</p>
<p>People talk about how Putin doesn&rsquo;t understand the world</p>
<p>and that he gets really bad information.</p>
<p>Lex, if you&rsquo;re sitting there in that Kremlin,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to conduct business in the world,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting reports from your finance minister</p>
<p>or your central bank governor,</p>
<p>your whole economy, everything that matters,</p>
<p>somehow all your trade is denominated in dollars and euros.</p>
<p>Do you have any illusions</p>
<p>about who controls the international financial system?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so, Lex.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking over your industrial plan for the next year,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re looking over how many tanks you&rsquo;re gonna get,</p>
<p>and how many cruise missiles you&rsquo;re gonna get,</p>
<p>and how many submarines you&rsquo;re gonna get,</p>
<p>and fill in the blank.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>It says right there in the paperwork</p>
<p>where the component parts come from,</p>
<p>where the software comes from,</p>
<p>comes from the West, Lex.</p>
<p>Your whole military industrial complex</p>
<p>is dependent on high end Western technology.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re in Beijing, not just in Moscow,</p>
<p>and you go to a meeting in your own neighborhood.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the leader of China.</p>
<p>You go to a meeting with other Asian leaders.</p>
<p>Do they all speak in Chinese with you?</p>
<p>No, Lex, they don&rsquo;t speak Chinese.</p>
<p>You go to an international meeting as the leader of China,</p>
<p>and guess what language is the main language of intercourse?</p>
<p>Yes, the same one you and I are speaking right now.</p>
<p>And so you live in that world.</p>
<p>You live in the Western world,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very hard to have illusions</p>
<p>about what world you live in.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re under that, you need those Western banks.</p>
<p>You need that foreign currency, right?</p>
<p>You need that high end Western technology,</p>
<p>that technology transfer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re speaking, or you&rsquo;re forced to speak,</p>
<p>or your minions are forced to speak</p>
<p>at international gatherings in English.</p>
<p>And I could go on.</p>
<p>All the indicators that you live in.</p>
<p>And so Putin lives in that world.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s no fool.</p>
<p>Well, to push back, isn&rsquo;t it possible that,</p>
<p>as you said, the minions operate in that world?</p>
<p>But can&rsquo;t you, if you&rsquo;re the leader of Russia,</p>
<p>or the leader of China,</p>
<p>or the leader of these different nations, still put up walls</p>
<p>where actually when you think in the privacy of your mind,</p>
<p>you exist not in the international world,</p>
<p>but in a world where there&rsquo;s this great Russian empire,</p>
<p>or this great Chinese empire,</p>
<p>and then you forget that there&rsquo;s English,</p>
<p>you forget that there&rsquo;s technology and iPhones,</p>
<p>you forget that there&rsquo;s all this US keeps popping up</p>
<p>on all different paperwork.</p>
<p>That just becomes the blurry details that dissipate,</p>
<p>because what matters is the greatness of this dream empire</p>
<p>that I have in my mind as a dictator.</p>
<p>I would put it this way, Lex.</p>
<p>After you absorb all of that from your minions,</p>
<p>and it impresses upon your consciousness where you live,</p>
<p>you live in a Western dominated world,</p>
<p>that the multipolar world doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Your goal is to make that multipolar world exist.</p>
<p>Your goal is to bring down the West.</p>
<p>Your goal is for the West to weaken.</p>
<p>Your goal is a currency other than the dollar and the euro.</p>
<p>Your goal is an international financial system</p>
<p>that you dominate.</p>
<p>Your goal is technological self sufficiency</p>
<p>made in China 2035, right?</p>
<p>Your goal is a world that you dominate,</p>
<p>not that the West dominates.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna do everything you can</p>
<p>to try to attain that world,</p>
<p>which is a Russian centric world,</p>
<p>or a Chinese centric world,</p>
<p>or what we could call a Eurasian centric world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not gonna be easy, Lex,</p>
<p>just for the reasons that we enumerated before.</p>
<p>But maybe you&rsquo;re gonna get a helping hand.</p>
<p>Maybe the West is gonna transfer</p>
<p>their best technology to you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna sell you their best stuff.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re gonna absorb it,</p>
<p>and maybe copy it, and reverse engineer it.</p>
<p>And if they won&rsquo;t sell it to you,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ll just have to steal it.</p>
<p>Maybe the West is gonna allow you to bank,</p>
<p>even though you violate many laws</p>
<p>that would prohibit the West</p>
<p>from extending those banking services to you.</p>
<p>Maybe the West is gonna buy your energy,</p>
<p>and your palladium, and your titanium,</p>
<p>and your rare metals like lithium,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re willing to have your poor people</p>
<p>mine that stuff and die of disease at an early age.</p>
<p>But Western governments, they don&rsquo;t wanna do that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna do that dirty mining</p>
<p>of those very important rare earths.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re willing to do that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just people whose lives you don&rsquo;t care about</p>
<p>as an autocratic regime, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the world you live in</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to get to this other world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at the center of the other world.</p>
<p>You dominate the other world.</p>
<p>But the only way to get there, Lex,</p>
<p>is the West has to weaken, divide itself,</p>
<p>maybe even collapse.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re encouraging, to the extent possible,</p>
<p>Western divisions, Western disunity,</p>
<p>a Western lack of resolve, Western mistakes,</p>
<p>and Western invasion of the wrong country,</p>
<p>and Western destruction of its credibility</p>
<p>through international financial crises,</p>
<p>and one could go on.</p>
<p>So if the West weakens itself through its mistakes</p>
<p>and its own corruption, you&rsquo;re gonna survive</p>
<p>and maybe even come out into that world</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re the center.</p>
<p>And so Russia&rsquo;s entire grand strategy,</p>
<p>just like China&rsquo;s grand strategy,</p>
<p>Iran, it&rsquo;s hard to say they have a grand strategy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so profoundly weak.</p>
<p>But Russia&rsquo;s grand strategy is, we&rsquo;re a mess.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t invest in our human capital.</p>
<p>Our human capital flees, or we actually drive it out.</p>
<p>It goes to MIT, like you did,</p>
<p>or it goes to fill in the blank, right?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t invest in our people.</p>
<p>Our healthcare is terrible.</p>
<p>Our education system is in decline.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t build infrastructure, Lex.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t improve our governance.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t invest in those attributes of modern power</p>
<p>that make the West powerful.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t because when we try, the money is stolen.</p>
<p>We try these grandiose projects of national projects,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna invest in higher ed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna invest in high tech.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna build our own Silicon Valley</p>
<p>known as Skolkovo.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna do all those things, and what happens?</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t even build an airport</p>
<p>without the money disappearing.</p>
<p>The Sochi Olympics, Lex,</p>
<p>officially cost them $50 billion.</p>
<p>You look around at the infrastructure that endured</p>
<p>from that $50 billion expense, and you&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the Second Avenue subway.</p>
<p>You get almost nothing for your money.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, it&rsquo;s corruption, Lex,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also because they don&rsquo;t wanna do that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna invest in their people.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t do it if they wanted to,</p>
<p>and when they try, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>But why invest in your own people?</p>
<p>Invest in your hardware, your military hardware, right?</p>
<p>Invest in your cyber capabilities.</p>
<p>Invest in all your spoilation techniques and your hard power,</p>
<p>and invest in further corrupting, and further weakening,</p>
<p>and further dividing the West, because as I said,</p>
<p>if the West is weak, divided, lacking resolve,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t invest in your people,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t build infrastructure,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t improve your governance,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll muddle through.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Russian grand strategy.</p>
<p>So invest in the hard power, weaken the West.</p>
<p>Those combined together means you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>heavily incentivized to escalate</p>
<p>any military aggressive conflicts that are around you,</p>
<p>or create new ones, or just.</p>
<p>If you can get away with murder.</p>
<p>But what happens, Lex,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a Harry Truman like response?</p>
<p>What happens if somebody says,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re gonna stand up to this?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna allow this to happen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna launder your money anymore.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna be dependent on you for energy</p>
<p>in the long term, we&rsquo;re gonna make a transition.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna punish you for that kind of behavior instead.</p>
<p>And the West is now switched to that</p>
<p>only because of the courage</p>
<p>and ingenuity of the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression</p>
<p>was one of the greatest gifts the West has ever received.</p>
<p>The sacrifices that the Ukrainians are making,</p>
<p>right now as we speak,</p>
<p>meaning they&rsquo;re fighting a war by themselves</p>
<p>against a major military power, their neighbor Russia.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s fighting it with them.</p>
<p>Yes, we are giving them weapons</p>
<p>so they can conduct self defense,</p>
<p>which by the way is legal under international law.</p>
<p>Unlike the Russian invasion,</p>
<p>which is illegal under international law,</p>
<p>Western supply of weapons, including heavy weapons,</p>
<p>including offensive weapons to Ukraine</p>
<p>for its self defense in the invasion by Russia</p>
<p>is actually legal under,</p>
<p>and so thank God the Ukrainians surprised everybody.</p>
<p>They surprised me, they surprised Putin and the Kremlin,</p>
<p>they surprised the Biden administration,</p>
<p>they surprised the European Union,</p>
<p>not with the fact that they would resist.</p>
<p>We knew that.</p>
<p>We had the Orange Revolution in 2004,</p>
<p>we had Maidan in 2013, 14,</p>
<p>where they rose up against a domestic tyrant</p>
<p>and they were willing to die</p>
<p>on behalf of their country then,</p>
<p>let alone against a foreign tyrant</p>
<p>invading their country, right?</p>
<p>So we knew they would resist.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know just how successful,</p>
<p>certainly I didn&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>they would be on the battlefield.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been breathtaking to watch.</p>
<p>That sacrifice, that gift enabled the West</p>
<p>to rediscover itself, to rediscover its power,</p>
<p>to revive itself, to say to hell with this energy dependence</p>
<p>in the long term,</p>
<p>to hell with this money laundering and reputation laundering,</p>
<p>to hell with this running back and forth to Moscow</p>
<p>to try to see what Putin needs</p>
<p>in order for him to feel respected,</p>
<p>what appeasement he needs, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see if it endures,</p>
<p>but this shift comes from the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s no longer getting away with murder, Lex,</p>
<p>and we thank the Ukrainians for that.</p>
<p>The people and the leadership</p>
<p>and the separate factions that make up Ukraine uniting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the unification, the uniting against the common enemy</p>
<p>and standing up before anyone knew</p>
<p>that they would be backed by all of these other nations,</p>
<p>by this money and all this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>standing there, especially with the president Zelensky,</p>
<p>where it makes total sense to flee, he stood his ground.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take that point that you just raised,</p>
<p>which is a deep and fundamental point,</p>
<p>and I thank you for that.</p>
<p>Do you guys hear that?</p>
<p>I think that was a compliment.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Lex.</p>
<p>Zelensky or unification, what do you say?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting here in front of you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a mutual honor.</p>
<p>So, Ukraine before the war</p>
<p>is run by a TV production company, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one guy running this fantastic, incredible podcast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 20 guys or so running a country the size of Ukraine.</p>
<p>And one&rsquo;s a producer and one&rsquo;s like a makeup person</p>
<p>and one&rsquo;s a video editor.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re fantastically talented people</p>
<p>if your country is a TV production.</p>
<p>So before the war, Zelensky had what, 25% approval rating</p>
<p>and he couldn&rsquo;t get much done and it wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>He got elected with 73%, as you know,</p>
<p>and then he was down to 20, that&rsquo;s a pretty big drop.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re thinking maybe having a major,</p>
<p>large size, 40 million plus population European country</p>
<p>run by a TV production company is not the best choice.</p>
<p>And then what do we see?</p>
<p>We see President Zelensky decides to risk his life</p>
<p>on behalf of his country, Ukraine.</p>
<p>He decides to stay in the capital.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not gonna flee, they&rsquo;re gonna stay and fight.</p>
<p>And he could be killed, he can die.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a decision where he put his life on the line.</p>
<p>Obviously, he&rsquo;s Jewish descent,</p>
<p>Russian speaking childhood and upbringing,</p>
<p>Russian speaking Jewish descent puts his life on the line</p>
<p>for the country of Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty big message, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s crucial.</p>
<p>And it turns out not only that, Lex,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re good at TV.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re good at information war.</p>
<p>And in a war, it&rsquo;s a TV production company</p>
<p>and a TV personality, that&rsquo;s exactly what you want</p>
<p>running a country because they&rsquo;re crushing</p>
<p>in the information war.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s spectacular, European Parliament,</p>
<p>US Congress, Israeli Parliament.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no room on Zoom, let alone in person</p>
<p>that he can&rsquo;t win over, he&rsquo;s just so effective.</p>
<p>You know, this is the first time reality TV</p>
<p>has been about reality instead of fake.</p>
<p>Reality TV is just this completely fake nonsense.</p>
<p>But Zelensky, this is real reality TV.</p>
<p>And he means it and the nation is behind him</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just as courageous and just as ingenious</p>
<p>in many ways and it&rsquo;s spectacular.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, who saw that coming?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see that coming, Lex.</p>
<p>In fact, the Biden, we talk about Putin&rsquo;s miscalculation.</p>
<p>The Biden administration, as you alluded to,</p>
<p>offered him an exit from the country.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t say, you know, you wanna stand and fight,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll back you.</p>
<p>They said, we&rsquo;ll get you out, you wanna come now?</p>
<p>And famously, you know that quote, right?</p>
<p>What he said about how he doesn&rsquo;t need a ride.</p>
<p>Remember that moment?</p>
<p>The Biden administration was poised</p>
<p>to do another Afghanistan moment.</p>
<p>That ignominious exit from Afghanistan</p>
<p>was almost what happened in Ukraine</p>
<p>when Biden administration offered him</p>
<p>that ride out of there.</p>
<p>And fortunately, he declined and helped rally</p>
<p>and the people from below also rallied</p>
<p>to stop the invader without the presidency</p>
<p>and without the government in Ukraine,</p>
<p>saving the Biden administration</p>
<p>and the European leaders who latched on.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they had the presence of mind</p>
<p>to latch onto this gift,</p>
<p>this bravery and ingeniousness of Zelensky</p>
<p>and the rest of the Ukrainians and flipped</p>
<p>and decided to support Ukraine&rsquo;s resistance,</p>
<p>you know, first with 5,000 helmets only</p>
<p>as the Germans initially promised</p>
<p>and now with really heavy weapons.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s something that wasn&rsquo;t foreseen.</p>
<p>I certainly didn&rsquo;t foresee that.</p>
<p>I foresaw the Ukrainian society being courageous</p>
<p>and resisting, but I didn&rsquo;t foresee</p>
<p>a television production company being exactly</p>
<p>what you want to run a country in a war,</p>
<p>a president Zelensky willing to sacrifice,</p>
<p>lay down his life and rallying others</p>
<p>in the country to do that.</p>
<p>And then the country being so effective,</p>
<p>not just at a courage, but at battlefield resistance</p>
<p>to the Russian invasion.</p>
<p>So I stand corrected by the Ukrainians</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m ecstatic that I was wrong,</p>
<p>that I was proven wrong.</p>
<p>And like I said, there&rsquo;s clear factions</p>
<p>of the West and the East of Ukraine</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s a person that, like you said,</p>
<p>was in the high 20s, low 30s percentage approval</p>
<p>in the country before the war</p>
<p>and now was able to use in the 90s.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in the 90% approval rating.</p>
<p>I mean, I think they stopped doing the polling.</p>
<p>Once he hit 91% or whatever it was in the previous poll,</p>
<p>I think they all understood that for now</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t need any more polling,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s pretty clear the nation.</p>
<p>So 25% to 90 something percent.</p>
<p>And just like the 25% was deserved,</p>
<p>the 90 something percent is also deserved, fully deserved.</p>
<p>And the question is how that all stabilizes, it feels</p>
<p>like this set of events,</p>
<p>I may be paying attention to Twitter too much,</p>
<p>which is a concern of mine, whether the change I see</p>
<p>is just surface level or deep level.</p>
<p>But it seems like we&rsquo;re in a new world,</p>
<p>that something dramatic has shifted.</p>
<p>That this power that&rsquo;s rooted,</p>
<p>I mean, in your study of the 20th century,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so deeply rooted in history,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this power center of the world</p>
<p>is now going to, has been shaken by this event.</p>
<p>And how that changes the world is unclear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear what lesson China learns from watching this,</p>
<p>what lesson India learns from watching this.</p>
<p>Both nations, as far as you can get polls</p>
<p>about Chinese population, but both nations</p>
<p>are largely in support of Putin.</p>
<p>So Russia, India, and China are still</p>
<p>supporting of Putin quietly.</p>
<p>I would maybe elaborate a little bit on that point, Lex.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right, the feeling that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in an inflection moment, an inflection point,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s widespread.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s widespread for good reason, we might be.</p>
<p>But I also share your, let&rsquo;s say, modesty</p>
<p>about where it&rsquo;s going and how hard it is</p>
<p>to predict where this might go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only an inflection point if the trends continue,</p>
<p>right, if the trends endure.</p>
<p>There are plenty of non inflection points.</p>
<p>After 9 11, the whole world rallied</p>
<p>around the United States after it was attacked,</p>
<p>after the bombing of the towers here in New York City</p>
<p>and the hitting of the Pentagon, and that didn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>It was not really an inflection point, was it?</p>
<p>It felt like it might be, but it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so this is not a comparable moment</p>
<p>in terms of what happened, but it has the feeling</p>
<p>that it might be a watershed.</p>
<p>And maybe we&rsquo;ll squander it the way we squandered</p>
<p>the post 9 11, rallying around the United States.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll actually consolidate it and it&rsquo;ll endure,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;ll endure despite ourselves.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t tell and we can&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>And it depends in part on what we do and what we don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s a few things that we understand already.</p>
<p>One, the idea that the West was in decline</p>
<p>and that the rest of the world had risen</p>
<p>and was more powerful and that we lived</p>
<p>in a multipolar world, that turns out</p>
<p>to be empirically false.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just factually not true.</p>
<p>There are no major important multinational institutions,</p>
<p>organizations that are run on behalf of,</p>
<p>or led by a South African, a Nigerian, person from India.</p>
<p>Even the Chinese don&rsquo;t run these institutions.</p>
<p>They would like to and they&rsquo;re trying, but they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so whatever you pick, the IMF, the World Bank,</p>
<p>the Federal Reserve, which is the most powerful</p>
<p>multinational institution, which is actually</p>
<p>only a domestic institution and doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a legal mandate to act multilaterally, but does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got the most power of any institution in the world.</p>
<p>NATO, the bilateral alliances that the US has</p>
<p>up and down Asia, what organizations</p>
<p>that have tremendous leverage on the international system,</p>
<p>on the international order, are non Western.</p>
<p>The UN is the most encompassing.</p>
<p>And of course we know that it has five members</p>
<p>of the Security Council with a veto,</p>
<p>one of which is Russia, one of which is China,</p>
<p>and the others are the US, Britain, and France,</p>
<p>not India, not South Africa, not Indonesia,</p>
<p>Indonesia, not all of these other countries</p>
<p>where the people live, right?</p>
<p>The bulk of the population of the world</p>
<p>and where the population is growing</p>
<p>like on the African continent.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a multipolar world.</p>
<p>We talked already about the international financial system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Western, not multipolar.</p>
<p>We talked about the US military and NATO,</p>
<p>or we could talk about the Japanese military,</p>
<p>which is just very formidable, enormous number of platforms.</p>
<p>Even the Australian military</p>
<p>we could talk about, Lex, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a Western dominated world.</p>
<p>And the West, remember, is not a geographic concept.</p>
<p>It is an institutional and values club.</p>
<p>The Japanese are not European, but they&rsquo;re Western.</p>
<p>Just like Russia is European, but not Western.</p>
<p>Because European is a cultural category</p>
<p>and Western is an institutional category</p>
<p>where you have rule of law and separation of powers</p>
<p>and free and open public sphere</p>
<p>and dynamic open market economy, okay.</p>
<p>And then we have another thing which is pretty clear.</p>
<p>The West is powerfully resented,</p>
<p>powerfully envied and admired simultaneously.</p>
<p>P.J. O Rourke, the comedian who died this year,</p>
<p>fantastic, it was a big loss for the culture.</p>
<p>He said, there are two things</p>
<p>that are always characteristic</p>
<p>of any American embassy abroad.</p>
<p>One is a political protest outside</p>
<p>and the other is the longest line you&rsquo;ve ever seen for visas.</p>
<p>And those things are true simultaneously.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the world we live in,</p>
<p>meaning that non Western countries</p>
<p>envy and admire the West,</p>
<p>but they also resent the power of the West.</p>
<p>Western hypocrisy, right?</p>
<p>The West invades countries when it wants,</p>
<p>but when others do that, it&rsquo;s illegal, right?</p>
<p>The West arrests you for money laundering,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s Western money laundering</p>
<p>that is where you go when you need to launder money, right?</p>
<p>So they see the hypocrisy,</p>
<p>they see the excessive power that the West has</p>
<p>and they resent it.</p>
<p>And they say, who elected you to run the world?</p>
<p>We have a billion plus people</p>
<p>or we have a 200 plus million people</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have a say.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the self appointed guardians of our world,</p>
<p>who did that?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s incumbent on the West</p>
<p>not only to remember the power that it has,</p>
<p>but also to exercise that power legally and with restraint</p>
<p>and also to think about how we can expand institutions</p>
<p>to be more encompassing</p>
<p>so that other parts of the world</p>
<p>are not on the outside being dictated to,</p>
<p>but instead are on the inside.</p>
<p>Too often, right, Western power is not consultative</p>
<p>in a decision making fashion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s consultative after the fact.</p>
<p>Okay, you know, we got together in the EU</p>
<p>or we got together in NATO</p>
<p>or we got together at the Federal Reserve</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s our decision and we&rsquo;re announcing it today.</p>
<p>And so your economy gets destroyed</p>
<p>because the Federal Reserve decides</p>
<p>it has to raise interest rates</p>
<p>or you now go into default.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t pay your debt</p>
<p>because Western banks lent you money</p>
<p>and now the West has changed interest rates</p>
<p>or other considerations and you&rsquo;re in big trouble now.</p>
<p>And so this is something which we fail to address.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to address.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to reform international institutions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to share power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to acknowledge that you have too much power</p>
<p>and that maybe having too much power is not good,</p>
<p>not only for the rest of the world, but for yourself.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s great to rediscover the West</p>
<p>and rediscover its values</p>
<p>and rediscover its authority and credibility and power,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not sufficient.</p>
<p>So we know this now.</p>
<p>We know that the rest of the world</p>
<p>is not necessarily jumping on the Western bandwagon</p>
<p>to condemn Russia for its actions</p>
<p>because the West can do things like</p>
<p>sanction your central bank, take away your reserves,</p>
<p>deny you technology.</p>
<p>It pretty much can do whatever it wants</p>
<p>and it can say that it&rsquo;s legal</p>
<p>and it can go through various mechanisms</p>
<p>and it can freeze your property.</p>
<p>And you say to yourself,</p>
<p>should anybody have that much power?</p>
<p>And when do they come after me?</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a caveat here.</p>
<p>And the caveat, Lex, is they don&rsquo;t like the West</p>
<p>having all of that power</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t join in the condemnation of Russia,</p>
<p>but they also didn&rsquo;t join in Russia&rsquo;s aggression.</p>
<p>So Russia&rsquo;s domestic civilian aerospace,</p>
<p>aircraft industry, civilian aircraft industry</p>
<p>is in big trouble now</p>
<p>because of the export controls on spare parts and software.</p>
<p>Brazil is a major power in aircraft manufacturing.</p>
<p>Did they rush in and say,</p>
<p>you know, Vladimir Putin, we didn&rsquo;t condemn necessarily</p>
<p>your actions in Ukraine, okay, that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>And how about we give you all of our aircraft technology</p>
<p>and we help you rebuild your domestic aircraft industry.</p>
<p>And you can have the aviation at the West,</p>
<p>did that happen, Lex?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And you can look at India and you can look at China</p>
<p>and you can look at South Africa</p>
<p>and you can look at what they&rsquo;ve done in practice</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;ve done in practical terms.</p>
<p>Yes, they haven&rsquo;t always joined</p>
<p>in a full throated condemnation.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;ve been neutral</p>
<p>or maybe they&rsquo;ve been playing both sides of the fence</p>
<p>like Turkey, for example.</p>
<p>But are they rushing in to join Russia,</p>
<p>to join Russia&rsquo;s aggression, to supply?</p>
<p>And the answer is no.</p>
<p>And the answer is no for two reasons.</p>
<p>One, they actually don&rsquo;t wanna be party to that.</p>
<p>And two, they understand that Western power.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t wanna be on the receiving end</p>
<p>by crossing the West and then getting caught up</p>
<p>in a sanctions regime or worse.</p>
<p>Can we go to the mind of Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>because what you just said, China, India,</p>
<p>they seem to sit back and say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to condemn the actions</p>
<p>of Vladimir Putin in Russia,</p>
<p>but we would really like for this war to be over.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that kind of energy</p>
<p>of we don&rsquo;t just stop this</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re putting us in a very, very bad position.</p>
<p>And yet Vladimir Putin is continuing the aggression.</p>
<p>What is he thinking?</p>
<p>What information is he getting?</p>
<p>Is it the system that you&rsquo;ve described</p>
<p>of authoritarian regimes that corrupts</p>
<p>your flow of information,</p>
<p>your ability to make clearheaded decisions</p>
<p>just as a human being when you go to sleep at night?</p>
<p>Is he not able to see the world clearly</p>
<p>or is this all deliberate systematic action</p>
<p>that does have some reason behind it?</p>
<p>We gotta talk a little bit about China too,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s answer your Putin question directly.</p>
<p>So on Twitter, you&rsquo;ve lost the war.</p>
<p>Or as they say, there are these two Russian soldiers</p>
<p>having a smoke in Warsaw,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re taking a break, having a smoke,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re sitting there in Warsaw on top of their tank</p>
<p>and one says to the other,</p>
<p>yeah, we lost the information war.</p>
<p>And there they are sitting in Warsaw</p>
<p>having that smoke, right?</p>
<p>So yeah, on Twitter, Russia has completely lost the war.</p>
<p>In reality, they failed to take Kiev.</p>
<p>They failed to capture Kiev.</p>
<p>And they failed in phase two, as they called it,</p>
<p>or plan B, which is to capture the entirety of the Donbass.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re three months into the war.</p>
<p>If you had made a judgment about, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>a definitive judgment after three months,</p>
<p>you might&rsquo;ve got the outcome wrong there.</p>
<p>If you had judged the Winter War,</p>
<p>the 1939, 40 Soviet invasion of Finland after three months,</p>
<p>you would&rsquo;ve got that wrong too</p>
<p>of what the outcome was gonna be.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re early in the game here,</p>
<p>and we have to be careful about any definitive judgments.</p>
<p>But it is the case that so far, they failed to take Kiev</p>
<p>and they failed to capture the entirety of the Donbass,</p>
<p>Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, Eastern Ukraine,</p>
<p>a part of Eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been driven out of Kharkiv</p>
<p>and the area immediately surrounding Kharkiv.</p>
<p>They never captured Kharkiv, but they came close,</p>
<p>but now the Ukrainians drove them back to the Russian border</p>
<p>in that very large and important region.</p>
<p>So those look like battlefield losses</p>
<p>that are impossible to explain away</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the regime in Russia,</p>
<p>except by suppression of information.</p>
<p>And as you know from Russian history, Lex,</p>
<p>leaders in Russia have an easier time</p>
<p>with the state of siege and deprivation</p>
<p>than they do with explaining a lost war.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s look at some other facts</p>
<p>that are important to take into account.</p>
<p>One, the Russian army has penetrated farther</p>
<p>into Ukrainian territory since February, 2022,</p>
<p>including in Kherson region,</p>
<p>the famous Mariupol siege that just ended.</p>
<p>They have built a large presence</p>
<p>in areas north of Crimea on the Sea of Azov,</p>
<p>the Black Sea littoral ultimately</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t previously hold.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still fighting in Luhansk for full control</p>
<p>over at least half of the Donbass</p>
<p>and Ukrainians are resisting fiercely.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, you can say that they&rsquo;ve been driven out</p>
<p>on the contrary, farther penetration than the beginning.</p>
<p>Ukraine doesn&rsquo;t have an economy anymore.</p>
<p>They have somewhere between 33 and 50% unemployment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to measure unemployment in a war economy,</p>
<p>but their metallurgical industry,</p>
<p>that Azov style steel plant in Mariupol is a ruin now.</p>
<p>And a lot of farmers are not planting the fields</p>
<p>because the harvest from the previous year</p>
<p>still hasn&rsquo;t been sent, sold abroad</p>
<p>because the ports are blockaded or destroyed.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t have an economy</p>
<p>and you need 5 billion or 7 billion</p>
<p>or $8 billion a month to meet your payroll,</p>
<p>to feed your people, to keep your army in the field.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of money per month and that&rsquo;s indefinite.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s as long as this blockade lasts.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t have an economy anymore, you&rsquo;re indigent.</p>
<p>And even if you take the lower number, 5 billion,</p>
<p>as opposed to Zelensky&rsquo;s ask for 7 billion,</p>
<p>5 billion is 60 billion a year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 60 billion this year, that&rsquo;s 60 billion next year.</p>
<p>And so who&rsquo;s got that kind of money?</p>
<p>Which Western taxpayers are ready?</p>
<p>And if you use the 7 or 8 billion,</p>
<p>you get up to 100 billion a year.</p>
<p>The Biden just signed, President Joe Biden just signed</p>
<p>the bill making it law, $40 billion in aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an enormous sum.</p>
<p>The economic piece of that is a month and a half,</p>
<p>two months of Ukrainians covering Ukrainian expenditures.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re asking the G7,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re asking everybody for this.</p>
<p>So you have no economy and no prospect of an economy</p>
<p>until you evict the Russians from your territory.</p>
<p>And then you have a Western unity, Western resolve,</p>
<p>it lasts or it doesn&rsquo;t last, Lex.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re President Putin,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got more territory than before,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got a stranglehold over the Ukrainian economy,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got a lot of the world neutral,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got the Chinese propaganda</p>
<p>supporting you to the hilt with those Oliver Stone</p>
<p>and Mearsheimer lines about how this is really NATO&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got Hungary dragging its feet</p>
<p>on the oil embargo against Russia,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got Turkey dragging its feet</p>
<p>on the recent applications of Sweden and Finland</p>
<p>for NATO expansion, and you&rsquo;re saying to yourself,</p>
<p>Lex, maybe I can ride this out.</p>
<p>I got a lot of problems of my own,</p>
<p>and we can go into the details</p>
<p>on the Russian side&rsquo;s challenges,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s on Ukrainian territory unless he&rsquo;s evicted,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got a stranglehold on their economy,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got the possibility that the West</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t stay resolved and doesn&rsquo;t continue to pay</p>
<p>for Ukraine&rsquo;s economy or supply those heavy weapons.</p>
<p>And so you could argue that maybe he&rsquo;s deluded</p>
<p>about all of this, and maybe he should go on Twitter.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not on Twitter, but maybe Putin,</p>
<p>who famously doesn&rsquo;t use the internet,</p>
<p>should go on Twitter and see he&rsquo;s losing the war.</p>
<p>Or you can argue that maybe he&rsquo;s calculating here</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s got a chance to still prevail.</p>
<p>Wow, that is darkly insightful.</p>
<p>If I could go to Henry Kissinger for a brief moment,</p>
<p>and people should read this op ed he wrote</p>
<p>in the Washington Post in March 5th, 2014,</p>
<p>after the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine,</p>
<p>but before Crimea was annexed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interesting historical description</p>
<p>about the division within Ukraine,</p>
<p>the corruption within Ukraine that will,</p>
<p>if people read this article, will give context</p>
<p>to how incredible it is, what Zelensky was able</p>
<p>to accomplish in uniting the country.</p>
<p>But I just want to comment because Henry Kissinger</p>
<p>is an interesting figure in American history.</p>
<p>He opens the article with, in my life,</p>
<p>I have seen four wars begun with great enthusiasm</p>
<p>and public support, all of which we did not know</p>
<p>how to end, and from three of which</p>
<p>we withdrew unilaterally.</p>
<p>The test of policy is how it ends, not how it begins.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s giving this cold, hard truth</p>
<p>that we go into wars excited, are able to send $40 billion,</p>
<p>financial aid, military aid, our own men and women,</p>
<p>but the excitement fades, Twitter outrage fades,</p>
<p>and then a country that&rsquo;s willing to wait patiently</p>
<p>is willing to pay the cost of siege</p>
<p>versus the cost of explaining to its own people</p>
<p>that the war is lost, that country just might win, outlast.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope not because the Ukrainians,</p>
<p>resistance deserves to prevail here.</p>
<p>Russia deserves to lose.</p>
<p>No war of aggression like they&rsquo;ve committed here</p>
<p>against Ukraine should prevail</p>
<p>if we can do anything about it.</p>
<p>I support 1,000% the continued supply of heavy weapons,</p>
<p>including offensive weapons, to the Ukrainians</p>
<p>as long as they&rsquo;re willing to resist, and it&rsquo;s their choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their choice when to negotiate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their choice how much to resist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their choice what kind of sacrifices to make,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s our responsibility to meet their requests</p>
<p>more quickly than we have so far and at greater scale.</p>
<p>But ultimately, wars only have political ends.</p>
<p>They never have military ends.</p>
<p>You need a political solution here.</p>
<p>So if the Ukrainians are able to conduct</p>
<p>a successful counteroffensive at scale</p>
<p>in July or August, whenever they launch,</p>
<p>right now the heavy weapons are coming in</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re being moved to the battlefield</p>
<p>and more are coming, you know, the dynamic.</p>
<p>Russia bombs a school, Russia bombs a hospital.</p>
<p>Americans and Europeans decide</p>
<p>to send even more heavy weapons to Ukraine, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the self defeating dynamic from the Russian side.</p>
<p>They commit the atrocities, we send more heavy weapons.</p>
<p>Once those heavy weapons are on the battle lines,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see if Ukrainians cannot just defend,</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;ve proven they&rsquo;re able to do</p>
<p>in breathtaking fashion, not just conduct counterattacks</p>
<p>where the enemy moves forward</p>
<p>and you cut behind the enemy&rsquo;s lines</p>
<p>and you counterattack and push the enemy back a little bit,</p>
<p>but whether you can evict the Russians</p>
<p>from your territory with a combined arms operation</p>
<p>where you have a massive superiority</p>
<p>in infantry and heavy weapons,</p>
<p>but more importantly, you coordinate your air power,</p>
<p>your tanks, your drones, your infantry at scale,</p>
<p>which is something the Ukrainians have not done yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something the Russians failed at in Ukraine</p>
<p>and they come from the same place, the Soviet military.</p>
<p>We hope this Ukrainian counter offensive at scale,</p>
<p>this combined arms operation succeeds.</p>
<p>And if it does succeed,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the possibility of a battlefield victory.</p>
<p>Whether that also includes Crimea,</p>
<p>which as you know is not hostile on the contrary</p>
<p>to the Russian military remains to be seen.</p>
<p>But however much they regain territorially</p>
<p>back towards the 1991 borders,</p>
<p>which is their goal, their stated goal,</p>
<p>and which we support them properly in trying to achieve,</p>
<p>however much they achieve of that</p>
<p>in this counter offensive that we&rsquo;re anticipating,</p>
<p>that will set the stage for the next phase.</p>
<p>And either Russia, which is to say one person,</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin, will acknowledge that he&rsquo;s lost the war</p>
<p>because the Ukrainians won it on the battlefield,</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;ll try to announce a full scale mobilization,</p>
<p>conscript the whole country, go back,</p>
<p>and instead of acknowledging defeat,</p>
<p>try to win with a different plan,</p>
<p>recalibrate, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Will the Ukrainians negotiate any territory away</p>
<p>or must they capture also Crimea,</p>
<p>which puts a very high bar on the summer counter offensive</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna see, which could last through the fall</p>
<p>and into the winter as a result.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the answers to that,</p>
<p>nobody knows the answers to that.</p>
<p>People are guessing, some people are better informed</p>
<p>because they have inside intelligence.</p>
<p>People are also worried about Russian escalation</p>
<p>to nuclear weapons or chemical weapons</p>
<p>if they begin to lose on the battlefield to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Are you worried about nuclear war,</p>
<p>the possibility of nuclear war?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s necessary to pay attention to that possibility.</p>
<p>That possibility existed before the February 2022</p>
<p>full blown invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The doomsday arsenal that Russia possesses</p>
<p>is enough to destroy the world many times over,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s been the case every year</p>
<p>since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p>And so, of course, we&rsquo;re concerned about that.</p>
<p>We do know, however, Lex,</p>
<p>that they have a system known as dual key,</p>
<p>dual key for their strategic nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Strategic nuclear weapons means the ones fired from silos,</p>
<p>the missiles, the ones delivered from bombers,</p>
<p>or the ones fired from submarines, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re ready to go.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re intercontinental.</p>
<p>We watch that very, very closely.</p>
<p>We watch all the movement of that and the alerts, et cetera.</p>
<p>We have tremendously, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>tremendous inside intelligence on that.</p>
<p>But dual key means that President Putin alone</p>
<p>cannot fire them.</p>
<p>He has one key, which he must insert,</p>
<p>he must then insert the codes for a command to launch.</p>
<p>That then goes to the head of the general staff,</p>
<p>who must, he has his own key and separate codes,</p>
<p>and must do the same,</p>
<p>insert that key and codes for them to launch.</p>
<p>And so will the general staff chief go along</p>
<p>with the destruction of the world</p>
<p>over a battlefield loss in Ukraine?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if anybody knows the answer to that.</p>
<p>Will those people flying those bombers,</p>
<p>if they get the order from,</p>
<p>if the dual key system goes into action</p>
<p>and both keys are used and all the codes are implemented,</p>
<p>will those young guys flying those bombers</p>
<p>let those bombs go?</p>
<p>Will those at the missile silos decide to engage and fire?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, but you can see that it&rsquo;s more than one man</p>
<p>making the decision here</p>
<p>in a system of strategic nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>As far as the tactical, the so called low yield</p>
<p>or battlefield nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not sure the system that they have in Russia these days</p>
<p>for their implement, for their use</p>
<p>of such tactical nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>It could well be that Putin and just himself,</p>
<p>himself, he alone can fire them or order them be fired.</p>
<p>What you know, Lex, there&rsquo;s no tactical nuclear weapon</p>
<p>fired at Ukraine that&rsquo;s not also fired simultaneously</p>
<p>at Russia.</p>
<p>If the Kremlin is 600 miles from Ukraine</p>
<p>and if the wind changes direction</p>
<p>or the wind happens to be blowing east, northeast,</p>
<p>the fallout hits your Kremlin, not just Ukraine.</p>
<p>Moreover, you have all those border regions</p>
<p>which are staging regions for the Russian offensive</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re a lot closer than 600 miles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually right there.</p>
<p>And so you fire that weapon on Ukrainian territory</p>
<p>and you can get the fallout</p>
<p>just like the Chernobyl fallout spread to Sweden</p>
<p>which is how we got the Kremlin to finally,</p>
<p>first they denied this at all.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know why there&rsquo;s a big nuclear cloud over Sweden.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know where that came from</p>
<p>but eventually they admitted it.</p>
<p>So Russia can actually use a nuclear weapon</p>
<p>tactical battlefield one in Ukraine</p>
<p>without also firing it at itself.</p>
<p>And in addition, it&rsquo;s that same dynamic</p>
<p>I alluded to earlier</p>
<p>which is to say you bomb a hospital,</p>
<p>you bomb a school, there&rsquo;s more heavy weapons</p>
<p>going to Ukraine from the west.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get away with any of the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always going to be a response</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s either proportional or greater than proportional.</p>
<p>You could well have Europe signing on</p>
<p>to NATO direct engagement,</p>
<p>both Washington and Brussels direct engagement</p>
<p>of the Russian army on the territory of Ukraine.</p>
<p>You think that&rsquo;s possible to do that</p>
<p>without dramatic escalation from the Russian side?</p>
<p>Yes, I do think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very worrisome just like you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>But if Putin were to escalate like that,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s firing that weapon at himself</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s potentially provoking a direct clash</p>
<p>with NATO&rsquo;s military,</p>
<p>not just with the Ukrainian military.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sitting in the Kremlin</p>
<p>looking at those charts, Lex, of NATO capabilities</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t conquer Ukraine</p>
<p>which didn&rsquo;t really have heavy weapons</p>
<p>before February 2022 at scale</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking, okay, now I&rsquo;m gonna take on NATO,</p>
<p>that would be a bold step on the part of a Russian leader.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s also remember, Lex,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s another variable here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a despot as long as everyone implements your orders.</p>
<p>And so if people start to say quietly,</p>
<p>not necessarily publicly, I may not implement that order</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s maybe a criminal order</p>
<p>or my grandma is Ukrainian or my wife is Ukrainian</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t wanna go to the hog.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna spend the rest of my life in the hog</p>
<p>or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>At any point along the chain of command</p>
<p>from the general staff all the way down, right,</p>
<p>to the platoon, you&rsquo;re a despot</p>
<p>provided they implement your orders.</p>
<p>But who&rsquo;s to say that somewhere along the chain of command</p>
<p>people start to say, I&rsquo;m gonna ignore that order</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna sabotage that order</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna flee the battlefield</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna injure myself so that I don&rsquo;t have to fight</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna join the Ukrainian side.</p>
<p>And so it could be that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s left</p>
<p>of the Russian army in the field begins to disintegrate.</p>
<p>Even if the Ukrainians are not able to mount that</p>
<p>counter offensive at scale, that combined arms operation,</p>
<p>the Russian military in the field,</p>
<p>which has taken horrendous casualties</p>
<p>as far as we understand, something like a third</p>
<p>of the original force, so you&rsquo;re talking about 50 to 60,000</p>
<p>that includes both dead and wounded to the point</p>
<p>of being unable to return to the battlefield.</p>
<p>Those are big numbers.</p>
<p>Those were a lot of families, a lot of families affected.</p>
<p>Their sons or their husbands or their fathers</p>
<p>are either missing in action or the regime won&rsquo;t tell them</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re dead, as you know from the sinking</p>
<p>of that flagship, Moskva, right, by the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>And so a disintegration of the Russian military</p>
<p>because there are orders that they either can&rsquo;t implement</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t wanna implement is also not excluded.</p>
<p>And so you have these two big variables,</p>
<p>the Ukrainian army in the field and its ability</p>
<p>to move from defense to offense at scale,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna test that soon.</p>
<p>And then the Russian ability in the field to hold together</p>
<p>in a war of conquest and aggression</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re conscripts or they&rsquo;re fed dog food</p>
<p>or they don&rsquo;t have any weapons anymore</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no resupply,</p>
<p>so the disintegration of the army can&rsquo;t be excluded.</p>
<p>And then, of course, all bets are off on the Putin regime.</p>
<p>More long term, there are these technology export controls.</p>
<p>We were talking about how the military industrial complex</p>
<p>in Russia is dependent on foreign component parts</p>
<p>and software, and so if you have export controls</p>
<p>and you have firms voluntarily,</p>
<p>even when they don&rsquo;t fall under export controls,</p>
<p>leaving Russian business, refusing to do business</p>
<p>with Russia, and we see this not just in the civilian sector</p>
<p>like with McDonald&rsquo;s or many other companies,</p>
<p>we see this in the key areas like the oil industry</p>
<p>with the executives fleeing,</p>
<p>that is the Western executives fleeing,</p>
<p>giving up their positions.</p>
<p>So Russia&rsquo;s ability to resupply its tanks,</p>
<p>resupply its missiles, resupply its uniforms,</p>
<p>resupply its food to its soldiers in the field</p>
<p>and in their boots, we see a lot of stuff</p>
<p>under tremendous stress, and in the long term,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no obvious way they can rebuild</p>
<p>the military industrial complex to produce those weapons</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re reliant on foreign parts</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t get anymore,</p>
<p>and there are no domestic substitutes</p>
<p>on the immediate horizon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at the earliest a two year proposition</p>
<p>to have domestic substitutes,</p>
<p>and for some things like microelectronics,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve never had domestic substitutes</p>
<p>going back to the Soviet times as you know well.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s that pressure on Russia</p>
<p>from the technology export controls,</p>
<p>which if you&rsquo;re in the security ministry</p>
<p>or the defense ministry,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in that side of the regime,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling that pain as we speak,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re wondering about the strategy.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about, again, the echoes of history,</p>
<p>and it frustrates me in part</p>
<p>when people draw these parallels,</p>
<p>but maybe there is some deep insight about those parallels.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a song that goes,</p>
<p>Dvata Teroviy Uniya Rovnovshchitya Chisa</p>
<p>Kiev by Bitya Nama Bitya Shtanochilai Svaina.</p>
<p>So Operation Barbarossa, the bombing of Kiev by Hitler,</p>
<p>there is sort of an eerie parallel,</p>
<p>and you have to be extremely careful</p>
<p>drawing such parallels and such connections</p>
<p>to this unexplainable war that is World War II.</p>
<p>But is there elements of this that do echo</p>
<p>in the actions of Vladimir Putin?</p>
<p>And more specifically, do you think that Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>is a war criminal?</p>
<p>Can that label be assigned to the actions of this man?</p>
<p>A war criminal is a legal determination,</p>
<p>and it requires evidence and due process</p>
<p>and the ability to defend oneself.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t just decide in the Twittersphere</p>
<p>or on a podcast that somebody is a war criminal.</p>
<p>They can be a suspected war criminal,</p>
<p>and we can gather evidence to try to prosecute that case.</p>
<p>And then the issue for us, Alexis,</p>
<p>which court does it go to?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the appropriate place?</p>
<p>Does it happen in Ukraine because they&rsquo;re the victims?</p>
<p>Does it happen in the Hague</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an international criminal court there?</p>
<p>Does it happen inside Russia</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s regime change at some point?</p>
<p>And some of these people become,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say they get arrested by their own people</p>
<p>inside Russia.</p>
<p>So those are all important questions</p>
<p>that have to be pursued with resources</p>
<p>and with determination and by skilled people</p>
<p>who are excellent at gathering that evidence.</p>
<p>And that process is underway.</p>
<p>And Ukraine has a trial underway now</p>
<p>of one alleged war criminal who&rsquo;s pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see what the outcome of that trial</p>
<p>inside Ukraine is of a lower level official,</p>
<p>not obviously Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>but the commander of a tank group.</p>
<p>So, yes, the names are eerily familiar.</p>
<p>Izium, Kharkiv, Kiev, right?</p>
<p>Those are the names we know from the Nazi invasion</p>
<p>and the Nazi occupation of Ukraine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very deeply troubling</p>
<p>to think that this could happen again.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bizarre sense that the Russians</p>
<p>claiming as Putin says to deNazify Ukraine</p>
<p>have invaded the same places that the Nazis invaded</p>
<p>back in 1941.</p>
<p>As somebody who&rsquo;s working on volume three</p>
<p>of your work on Stalin going through this period,</p>
<p>is it eerie to you?</p>
<p>Yes, it is, Lex.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written the chapters of volume three.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve drafted the chapters on the war.</p>
<p>And as I said, the place names</p>
<p>are very evocative, unfortunately.</p>
<p>But, you know, the Nazis failed ultimately.</p>
<p>They captured Ukraine for a time,</p>
<p>but they were evicted from Ukraine.</p>
<p>There was massive partisan or guerrilla warfare resistance</p>
<p>behind Nazi lines the whole time</p>
<p>that they were allegedly in control of Ukraine.</p>
<p>If you look at the maps on cable TV,</p>
<p>they show you the sign of,</p>
<p>they show you the coloring, Russian control.</p>
<p>And they draw a line and then it&rsquo;s colored in.</p>
<p>But the word control is misplaced.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually control it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Russian claimed or extent</p>
<p>of farthest Russian troop advancement.</p>
<p>Because behind the Russian lines in Ukraine,</p>
<p>Crimea accepted, you have insurgencies.</p>
<p>You have the armed insurgency.</p>
<p>In Melitopol, for example,</p>
<p>which is a place that you know in Southeastern Ukraine,</p>
<p>there is a guerrilla war now underway</p>
<p>to hurt the Russians who are in occupation</p>
<p>of that city and region.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna see that continue</p>
<p>even if the war becomes a stalemate,</p>
<p>even if it stalemates more or less</p>
<p>at the lines we&rsquo;re at now,</p>
<p>which would mean that anticipated</p>
<p>Ukrainian counteroffensive at scale proves unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The Russian army doesn&rsquo;t disintegrate.</p>
<p>And you end up with a stalemate</p>
<p>where there could be a ceasefire or not a ceasefire,</p>
<p>but neither side is attempting an offensive</p>
<p>for the time being.</p>
<p>There will be resistance behind those Russian lines</p>
<p>and it will be fierce resistance.</p>
<p>The kind of resistance we saw to the Nazi occupation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it took the Red Army</p>
<p>reinvading the territory of Ukraine</p>
<p>and succeeding at combined arms operations at scale.</p>
<p>A massive counteroffensive,</p>
<p>much larger than anything we&rsquo;re talking about today.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it required that</p>
<p>to evict the Nazis from Ukraine.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, they did not have an easy occupation</p>
<p>regime there.</p>
<p>Ukrainian partisans, Soviet partisans</p>
<p>killed Nazi officials, Wehrmacht soldiers, Wehrmacht officers</p>
<p>blew up the infrastructure they were using,</p>
<p>made them pay a price for their occupation.</p>
<p>We could well see if unfortunately</p>
<p>this ends in a stalemate for the time being,</p>
<p>we could well see that type of insurgency</p>
<p>gain momentum behind Russian lines</p>
<p>and try to evict the Russians that way</p>
<p>and then remount the counteroffensive at scale</p>
<p>later on in the future if the first one doesn&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
<p>So that would be further echoes</p>
<p>of the World War II experience.</p>
<p>The scale once again is much smaller.</p>
<p>The size of the armies here,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not in the many 800,000, 700,000,</p>
<p>a million two, a million four.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re talking about today.</p>
<p>But the weapons, the cruise missiles, artillery fire.</p>
<p>Artillery fire used to be very inaccurate</p>
<p>and it was like saturation.</p>
<p>You would just fire towards the enemy lines</p>
<p>and if you hit something, you hit something</p>
<p>and if you didn&rsquo;t, you just kept firing.</p>
<p>Now you have drones, Lex.</p>
<p>And so artillery fire is now sniper fire</p>
<p>because you can coordinate the direction</p>
<p>of the artillery fire with the drones.</p>
<p>The drones can take a picture and show you</p>
<p>where the enemy is precisely located</p>
<p>and you can align that artillery to hit them</p>
<p>instead of just indiscriminately bombing an area,</p>
<p>a territory.</p>
<p>And the NATO supplied artillery goes really far</p>
<p>and you can fire into Russian positions</p>
<p>and yourself not be exposed to Russian fire</p>
<p>because your artillery fires farther than theirs.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s coming and we&rsquo;re gonna see that in action.</p>
<p>And so the scale is not the same,</p>
<p>but the weapons, the precision of some of the weapons</p>
<p>and some of the NATO.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not sending all of our stuff,</p>
<p>but as I said, the dynamic is Russia commits atrocities,</p>
<p>Russia bombs schools, Russia bombs hospitals,</p>
<p>Russia kills civilians and more and heavier</p>
<p>and more lethal Western weapons go to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Their willingness to risk their lives is really so impressive</p>
<p>and the reason that it&rsquo;s our duty,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re obliged to supply those weapons.</p>
<p>And so the Russians don&rsquo;t have that resupply</p>
<p>and the Ukrainians do.</p>
<p>And so the Russians are now digging in Lex.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re digging in deeply in the areas</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve penetrated</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to build unassailable positions</p>
<p>for when the Ukrainians transition</p>
<p>from mostly defense to full scale offense.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see if that now,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re digging everywhere,</p>
<p>as they say, Kapayut, Kapayut, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re digging everywhere behind.</p>
<p>Your Russian is beautiful.</p>
<p>Digging in, I wish Lex, like yours.</p>
<p>But so there are these things that we can&rsquo;t predict,</p>
<p>but there are these things we&rsquo;re watching</p>
<p>and watching closely.</p>
<p>And on top of that, something that&rsquo;s not in World War II</p>
<p>or for the most part is cyber attacks and cyber warfare,</p>
<p>which is much less perhaps convertible into human words</p>
<p>because it happens so quickly, it&rsquo;s such large scales,</p>
<p>so difficult to trace and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bullets, it&rsquo;s electrical signals and that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but those Ukrainian people, they&rsquo;re like you, Lex.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re young and they&rsquo;re technically really proficient.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been amazing.</p>
<p>You know, they spent those teenage years in the basement</p>
<p>playing video games.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s useful after all.</p>
<p>It turns out it&rsquo;s more than useful.</p>
<p>You can save your country that way.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re not alone, they&rsquo;re getting support</p>
<p>and that support is important,</p>
<p>but really predominantly it&rsquo;s Ukrainians</p>
<p>on the cyber battlefield.</p>
<p>And their skills have been very impressive</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been preparing for this for a number of years.</p>
<p>And they have a whole army of young people on the cyber side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their civilian population.</p>
<p>These are not people conscripted into the military</p>
<p>or volunteering wearing the uniform.</p>
<p>And so even in cyber warfare,</p>
<p>the Ukrainians have been extremely impressive.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s remember that all of these aspects of warfare,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s how far your cruise missiles go</p>
<p>and how accurate they are,</p>
<p>what size your cyber capabilities are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really ultimately about the people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the human capital, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about their willingness, their skill level,</p>
<p>but also their willingness to fight</p>
<p>and to put their lives on the line.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no substitute for that.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s called morale or courage or bravery or valor,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really the ultimately decisive</p>
<p>provided you have enough sufficient arms, right?</p>
<p>To conduct the fight.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, you use a Molotov cocktail, right?</p>
<p>Grandma calls in the coordinates of the Russian tank</p>
<p>on her iPhone and you have a Molotov cocktail</p>
<p>that the people who used to work in the cafeteria</p>
<p>are now stuffing flammable liquid into bottles</p>
<p>and you carry one right up to the tank</p>
<p>and you smash it against the tank</p>
<p>or you drop it in one of the hatches in the tank, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no substitute for that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>that level of resolve, willingness to die for your country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really big lesson</p>
<p>that we need to absorb in our own country.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been going to war more frequently than we should.</p>
<p>And like you said, without the justification all the time,</p>
<p>and then like Henry Kissinger said,</p>
<p>without understanding how this was gonna end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to start a war,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to win a war, prevail in a war</p>
<p>or end a war on terms that meet</p>
<p>your original expectations, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been fighting wars,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t been fighting wars as societies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been fighting wars as a small sliver of our population.</p>
<p>Something like 1% of our population</p>
<p>is involved with the military</p>
<p>because we have an all volunteer force.</p>
<p>And that means that it&rsquo;s easier for our politicians</p>
<p>to go to war because they don&rsquo;t face conscription,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have the draft,</p>
<p>which affects every family in the country.</p>
<p>And because the number of people in the volunteer force</p>
<p>is such a narrow stratum of the population.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ve been getting away with this</p>
<p>because the professional army</p>
<p>is much better than the conscript army.</p>
<p>And an all volunteer force is much preferable</p>
<p>from a military point of view.</p>
<p>But from a societal point of view, it enables you</p>
<p>to go to war too easily as a politician.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t engage the society the same way</p>
<p>that the Ukrainian society is completely engaged</p>
<p>from those young hackers all the way up</p>
<p>to those grandmothers.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, you&rsquo;re a scholar of history,</p>
<p>a scholar of geopolitics, and you&rsquo;re also a human being.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also a human being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of you, Lex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the value, what&rsquo;s the hope,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the power of conversation here?</p>
<p>If you could sit down with Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>and have a conversation versus bullets,</p>
<p>human exchange words, is there hope for those?</p>
<p>And if so, what would you talk about?</p>
<p>What would you ask him?</p>
<p>Well, Henry Kissinger,</p>
<p>you alluded to his op ed,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had many private meetings with President Putin</p>
<p>over a long time.</p>
<p>And President Biden,</p>
<p>the previous presidents, secretaries of state,</p>
<p>officials below secretary of state,</p>
<p>the head of the CIA,</p>
<p>evidently met with President Putin in the fall</p>
<p>when he was massing the troops on the border</p>
<p>before he invaded.</p>
<p>And we sent the head of the CIA and Putin received him,</p>
<p>somebody he evidently respects</p>
<p>or was at least willing to meet,</p>
<p>unlike other members of the administration.</p>
<p>So a lot of people are talking to him</p>
<p>in some form or another for the 22 years</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been in power.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s had</p>
<p>what I would call their desired effect.</p>
<p>Well, the nature of the conversation is interesting too.</p>
<p>And also the timing, which is post February 22nd,</p>
<p>is a different time.</p>
<p>And also another aspect,</p>
<p>which Oliver Stone mentioned interestingly,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something about COVID and the pandemic</p>
<p>that creates isolation, the distancing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a silly little nuance thing,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s actually has a profound impact</p>
<p>on the human being, the human mind of Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>that there is something about an in person meeting</p>
<p>and not across a table that&rsquo;s far too large,</p>
<p>but sort of the intimacy of one human to human</p>
<p>in person conversation,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something distinctly powerful</p>
<p>about that reminder that as Putin says</p>
<p>in the narrative and the propaganda</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all one people, there is truth to that,</p>
<p>that this entirety of humanity is one people.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re kind of reminded by that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sitting together.</p>
<p>People who have sat across the table from him,</p>
<p>whether at 30 yards or at three,</p>
<p>have remarked upon this feeling of isolation</p>
<p>that has affected him, the pandemic.</p>
<p>I think there must be something to that</p>
<p>if several people who&rsquo;ve been in the room with him</p>
<p>are remarking on it.</p>
<p>Everybody that I know and I&rsquo;ve been able to talk to</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s had a meeting with him in the past 10 years,</p>
<p>including Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State,</p>
<p>has said that Putin spends a lot of time</p>
<p>enumerating his grievances.</p>
<p>He goes through a monologue of his grievances</p>
<p>and then the West did this,</p>
<p>and then the West lied to us about that,</p>
<p>and then the West cheated us on this.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not the conversation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re encouraging of common humanity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that roiling resentment volcano</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just exploding and exploding.</p>
<p>The resentment.</p>
<p>And by the time he gets through the monologue</p>
<p>of the grievances, the time of the meeting</p>
<p>is expired or over time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a brilliant statement,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where the skill of conversation comes in.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re facing a bull with a red cloth,</p>
<p>you have to learn how to avoid the long list of grievances</p>
<p>and get to the humanity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really important skill.</p>
<p>For sure it&rsquo;s a skill,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the highest level skill of a diplomat</p>
<p>to be able to reach some type of common understanding</p>
<p>when interests and worldviews clash so much.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s your challenge, Lex.</p>
<p>Your challenge is Russia wants to impose</p>
<p>a closed sphere of influence on its neighbors.</p>
<p>It wants to dictate what its neighbors can and can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>It wants to exert influence,</p>
<p>not by the power of its example,</p>
<p>not by the freedom of its people,</p>
<p>not by the dynamism of its diversified economy,</p>
<p>but it wants to exert influence</p>
<p>just because it deserves that,</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s a great power,</p>
<p>just because, and on and on and on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a civilization unto itself.</p>
<p>And it wants that, and we can&rsquo;t give that.</p>
<p>The reason that Russia was not integrated into the West</p>
<p>was not for lack of trying.</p>
<p>It was because Russia ultimately spurned the integration</p>
<p>because it was about what terms</p>
<p>the integration would come on.</p>
<p>Would you come into the West and observe Western rules</p>
<p>and be another country, meaning just another country?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Poland, and there&rsquo;s Austria,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s little tiny Monaco, and there&rsquo;s Russia.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just one of those countries.</p>
<p>And Russia&rsquo;s answer to that was no,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not just one of those countries.</p>
<p>We need special rules.</p>
<p>We need special conditions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll integrate, but only as a special country,</p>
<p>meaning like at the UN, where all countries are sovereign,</p>
<p>all countries are members,</p>
<p>but Russia has a veto on what countries can and can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Those were the terms on which they were willing to integrate.</p>
<p>And those were the terms that no leader of a Western country</p>
<p>or the United States or the G7 or fill in the blank</p>
<p>can grant to Russia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very well known that Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>was one of the first, maybe the first person,</p>
<p>first leader, foreign leader to call President Bush</p>
<p>after the 9 11 tragedy.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t connect right away.</p>
<p>President Bush was not in Washington,</p>
<p>but eventually they did speak.</p>
<p>He condemned the terrorist attack.</p>
<p>He offered Russian support, which he delivered on</p>
<p>the use of some Russian logistics</p>
<p>for our Afghanistan operations.</p>
<p>And a lot of people point to that and they say,</p>
<p>there it is.</p>
<p>Russia wanted to cooperate and did cooperate</p>
<p>and we spurned them or we failed to appreciate</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s cooperation.</p>
<p>And so therefore Russia was cheated or Russia was lied to</p>
<p>or Russia&rsquo;s grievances are legitimate.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem with that argument, Lex.</p>
<p>In exchange for that support, Vladimir Putin asked</p>
<p>in return from President Bush for a free hand</p>
<p>in the former Soviet space,</p>
<p>that closed hierarchical sphere of influence</p>
<p>where Russia would exert influence coercively</p>
<p>over countries that were sovereign.</p>
<p>And no American president could grant that.</p>
<p>And President Bush was right.</p>
<p>He said no.</p>
<p>And so the attempted cooperation blew up.</p>
<p>But who&rsquo;s at fault there?</p>
<p>Should there be a nonvoluntary sphere of influence?</p>
<p>Should that be granted or should you face up</p>
<p>to attempts to do that?</p>
<p>You know, let&rsquo;s take a little detour here</p>
<p>into China for a second.</p>
<p>China had this brilliant grand strategy,</p>
<p>which was sure, America is hostile</p>
<p>because America is hegemonic.</p>
<p>America wants to control the world.</p>
<p>America will never let China rise.</p>
<p>America will do everything it can to hold China down.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna have hostility from America.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t wanna decouple because we need</p>
<p>that high end technology transfer.</p>
<p>Either we buy it or we steal it</p>
<p>because America and the rest of the West</p>
<p>has all the technology that we need.</p>
<p>We have some of it domestically,</p>
<p>more than before by a lot,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re still dependent so we can&rsquo;t decouple.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have the hostility,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ll be a line we don&rsquo;t cross</p>
<p>just so that we don&rsquo;t lose the technology transfer.</p>
<p>Till Made in China 2035 is accomplished</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re self sufficient domestically</p>
<p>in AI and every other area that&rsquo;s critical.</p>
<p>But hostility from America.</p>
<p>But we have an ace in the hole.</p>
<p>Our ace in the hole is Europe.</p>
<p>Europe hates conflict.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all about trade.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter how evil you are.</p>
<p>They love to trade because Wandel durch Handel,</p>
<p>change through trade.</p>
<p>They have this illusion</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna become a better country</p>
<p>if they trade with you</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t have conflict, war and hostilities</p>
<p>if you trade.</p>
<p>And so we have this European ace in the hole.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hostile with the Americans.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still buying or stealing their technology.</p>
<p>And better than that even,</p>
<p>the Europeans are not hostile to us at all.</p>
<p>They love to trade with us</p>
<p>and they wanna trade more</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re our biggest trading partner already.</p>
<p>And lo and behold,</p>
<p>Xi Jinping sides with Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>in the aggression in Ukraine.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t side with him providing military equipment.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t provide technology transfer</p>
<p>but he provides public support</p>
<p>and massive pro Russian propaganda</p>
<p>to the whole Chinese population.</p>
<p>And the Europeans say, wait a minute,</p>
<p>this is an invasion of a sovereign country in Europe.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not condemning Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s invasion.</p>
<p>And so that wedge that the Chinese had,</p>
<p>that was the basis of their grand strategy,</p>
<p>that wedge between the US and Europe</p>
<p>when it came to China policy,</p>
<p>that wedge is gone now.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping destroyed it.</p>
<p>And the Europeans and the Americans</p>
<p>are coming close together</p>
<p>on Ukraine and Russia policy for sure,</p>
<p>but also more and more on China policy.</p>
<p>And so that was a pretty big sacrifice</p>
<p>for the Chinese leader to make.</p>
<p>And what did he get in return?</p>
<p>He gets hydrocarbons from Russia at reduced prices.</p>
<p>And the Chinese get hydrocarbons from a lot of countries.</p>
<p>They have a completely diverse supply chain</p>
<p>for their energy.</p>
<p>So what do you think Xi Jinping is thinking now?</p>
<p>Was it a mistake or?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to know, Lex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to be able to sit down with him</p>
<p>across from this table here on your podcast</p>
<p>and pose that same question to him</p>
<p>because we have no idea.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a language barrier that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>By the way, you as a scholar of Stalin,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;ll ever break through</p>
<p>the language barrier to China?</p>
<p>Not ever, I apologize, in the next few years</p>
<p>because there is a gigantic cultural and language barrier</p>
<p>between the West and the Chinese.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s a great civilization.</p>
<p>China predates the United States by millennia.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s accomplishments are breathtaking.</p>
<p>But China&rsquo;s also led by, let&rsquo;s be honest,</p>
<p>a Communist Party monopoly</p>
<p>which engages in a lot of criminal behavior.</p>
<p>Lex, Tibet is Ukraine.</p>
<p>Xinjiang is Ukraine.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is Ukraine,</p>
<p>let alone support for Putin, Ukraine.</p>
<p>This is before we&rsquo;ve even discussed Taiwan.</p>
<p>And so now the Europeans are coming to see this</p>
<p>and the Americans are coming to understand this,</p>
<p>that maybe trading with a regime like that,</p>
<p>morally, politically, criminally,</p>
<p>Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong,</p>
<p>how is that different from what Putin is doing in Ukraine?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be hard pressed to differentiate that ultimately,</p>
<p>even though the analogies are not exact.</p>
<p>And so the Chinese, it&rsquo;s like that guy Leonov,</p>
<p>the author of Licheletia,</p>
<p>the great memoir of the late Soviet period,</p>
<p>the end of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>You know that they spend all this time</p>
<p>and all these resources blackening our image,</p>
<p>but we supply them with endless material</p>
<p>to blacken our image.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Xi Jinping&rsquo;s regime is right now, Lex.</p>
<p>And so they have a big dilemma on their side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Western world</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve united the Western world</p>
<p>and reawoken the Western world</p>
<p>to the fact that China is a threat</p>
<p>to the values, the institutions and values of the West.</p>
<p>And that trade is not transforming China quite the opposite.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see if this endures.</p>
<p>Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t endure.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a fleeting moment.</p>
<p>Maybe this is not an inflection point.</p>
<p>Maybe the war in Ukraine ends more quickly than we think.</p>
<p>And maybe like you said,</p>
<p>the Chinese and the Indians and the rest of them,</p>
<p>the leaders there, they get their wish that it ends</p>
<p>and the world moves on and forgets</p>
<p>or says, let&rsquo;s try again to resume</p>
<p>our mutual understanding,</p>
<p>our mutually beneficial trade and everything else.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a passing phase.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t exclude that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very poor at predicting the future.</p>
<p>But the moment is not a good one for the Chinese regime,</p>
<p>let alone the fact that he&rsquo;s trying to impose</p>
<p>an unprecedented in the modern era third term</p>
<p>for himself as president in the fall</p>
<p>at the next party Congress,</p>
<p>becoming president for life de facto, a Mao like figure.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s now got to do that within this environment</p>
<p>where he has damaged Chinese grand strategy</p>
<p>and damaged the reputation of China</p>
<p>and its relationships across the world.</p>
<p>Maybe not permanently, but significantly,</p>
<p>in addition to the problems they have at home,</p>
<p>demography, as you know, a middle income trap,</p>
<p>and then the regulatory insanity of Chinese communist rule</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve seen with the tech companies that you know well,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ve destroyed all of that value</p>
<p>with the blow up of their property sector</p>
<p>because it was a massive bubble</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s still playing out.</p>
<p>And this time it&rsquo;s the same,</p>
<p>meaning this time it&rsquo;s not different.</p>
<p>When it comes to a property blowout,</p>
<p>it has enormous effects on middle class balance sheets</p>
<p>and their ability to remain consumers</p>
<p>and drive the economy,</p>
<p>which is the model that they have to share.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s got a litany of challenges independent even</p>
<p>of the fact that he sided with his pal Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>and their bromance is costing China</p>
<p>very, very significantly.</p>
<p>If you close your eyes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And a hundred years ago in 1922</p>
<p>and you think about the future,</p>
<p>I wonder if you can hear the drums of war</p>
<p>predicting the 30s,</p>
<p>predicting the great depression and the resentment</p>
<p>that builds the economic resentment,</p>
<p>the cultural resentment, the geopolitical resentment</p>
<p>that builds and leads to World War II.</p>
<p>At least to me, when I close my eyes,</p>
<p>I can hear the drums of war that are still ahead of us.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible that 2022 will materialize</p>
<p>in a similar way as did 1922.</p>
<p>I have my eyes closed, Lex.</p>
<p>Do you hear anything?</p>
<p>And I sure hope that that&rsquo;s not what happens.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m looking in 1922, it&rsquo;s an epoch I know well</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t see the future that unfolds.</p>
<p>I would not have predicted it had I been alive then.</p>
<p>I see the war behind us.</p>
<p>I see a prosperity on the horizon.</p>
<p>Yes, inflation in Germany</p>
<p>and some many other difficult issues,</p>
<p>but there are more democracies now</p>
<p>than there were before the war</p>
<p>and the old empires are gone.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a cultural efflorescence</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s modernism in the arts</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s women entering the public sphere</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all this fantastic new technology</p>
<p>like automobiles.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking at the future from 1922</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not seeing the Great Depression</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not seeing World War II</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not seeing the Holocaust</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t predict the future</p>
<p>and nobody in 1922 could see that future,</p>
<p>although I guess there were some clairvoyants</p>
<p>who predicted it, but.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not one of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one of them.</p>
<p>But this is what I know, Lex, from studying history.</p>
<p>What I know is stuff happens.</p>
<p>In other words, in other words, Lex,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re watching Ukraine war right now</p>
<p>and all of our attention is focused on that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like the economists say in their textbooks</p>
<p>when their powerful models are employed</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this line that says</p>
<p>all other factors held constant, comma,</p>
<p>and then the model works.</p>
<p>And you get this really great result.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very powerful predictor and analysis, the model.</p>
<p>And the whole game is all other factors held constant.</p>
<p>So the Russia, Ukraine war that we&rsquo;ve been discussing</p>
<p>and this could happen and that could happen,</p>
<p>but you know what stuff could happen, Lex.</p>
<p>For example, the Israeli government</p>
<p>could decide this summer that it&rsquo;s gonna bomb Iran</p>
<p>because no Israeli government will tolerate Iran</p>
<p>acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>And since President Trump exited,</p>
<p>unilaterally exited from the multipower nuclear agreement,</p>
<p>Iran is now much closer to the bomb than they were</p>
<p>when they were still in,</p>
<p>when the United States was still in that agreement.</p>
<p>And you tell me the Israeli government that says,</p>
<p>sure, it&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s okay, Iran can get the bomb.</p>
<p>And so maybe that happens.</p>
<p>And maybe that happens as early as this summer</p>
<p>as Iran gets closer and closer and closer to the bomb.</p>
<p>Maybe that guy in North Korea decides it&rsquo;s his time</p>
<p>just like his grandfather, right, in 1950 decided,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s time, we&rsquo;re gonna quote reunify,</p>
<p>unquote, the Korean peninsula, maybe, I don&rsquo;t know, Lex,</p>
<p>fill in the blank, something&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be what I predict.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be what I&rsquo;m watching.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be obvious only after it happens, not before.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s gonna upend the table.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Everything changes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna be in a different environment,</p>
<p>different circumstances, and is Ukraine still</p>
<p>as central at that point as it seems to be right now?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question.</p>
<p>Let me ask two rapid fire questions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only allowed to have one minute</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s about predicting the future.</p>
<p>Okay, question one, Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>when will he no longer be in office?</p>
<p>And will he step down or be overthrown?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your prediction and a brief explanation</p>
<p>of that prediction?</p>
<p>Now, nobody can predict the future,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s your sense now?</p>
<p>Some people are saying the pressure is building.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to be overthrown or step down</p>
<p>at the end of this year.</p>
<p>And some people say surely he&rsquo;s going to last,</p>
<p>outlast Stalin&rsquo;s rule of 30 plus years.</p>
<p>No evidence of a coup yet, none whatsoever, yet.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pretty much at life expectancy for a Russian male.</p>
<p>Those are bad numbers.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 69, gonna be 70.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s lived the life of a Russian male already,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s got better doctors than the majority</p>
<p>of the Russian males in that, let&rsquo;s say comparison set.</p>
<p>So he could live a very long time with good doctors.</p>
<p>So there could be a coup at some point,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s none today in evidence.</p>
<p>He could go because he&rsquo;s reached the life expectancy</p>
<p>or he could stay for a long time.</p>
<p>The thing to watch about this</p>
<p>is an organization that nobody pays attention to.</p>
<p>The FSO, the Federalnaya Sluzhba Akhrani,</p>
<p>which is the Praetorian Guard,</p>
<p>the self standing bodyguard directorate,</p>
<p>the only one, the only organization in Russia</p>
<p>that has any access to him.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen no disloyalty, no breaking of ranks,</p>
<p>no defections, nothing in the public realm and open sources</p>
<p>about any divisions or problems in the FSO,</p>
<p>in the Praetorian Guard.</p>
<p>So if you can&rsquo;t break that, change that illicit defections</p>
<p>there, you can&rsquo;t overturn him.</p>
<p>Authoritarian regimes, Lex, they&rsquo;re terrible.</p>
<p>They fail at everything.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t feed their people.</p>
<p>They have trouble achieving any goals.</p>
<p>They only have to be good, however, at one thing.</p>
<p>They only have to be good</p>
<p>at the complete suppression of political alternatives.</p>
<p>If you can suppress political alternatives,</p>
<p>you can fail at everything else,</p>
<p>but you can survive as an authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>So you watch Navalny.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>Okay, Lex, you go for it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my second rapid fire question</p>
<p>is what happens to Navalny?</p>
<p>What are the possible conclusions of what you said</p>
<p>quite possibly the second most influential,</p>
<p>powerful figure in Russia?</p>
<p>Is he going to die in jail?</p>
<p>Will he become the next president of Russia?</p>
<p>Well, what are the possible?</p>
<p>I wish I knew, Lex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been surprised that he&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been worried that he will be killed in prison</p>
<p>in a staged fight, some security officer,</p>
<p>prison guard puts on a prison outfit,</p>
<p>takes a lead pipe, goes into the cell.</p>
<p>They have a quote fight and Navalny is killed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been afraid of that, but he&rsquo;s still alive</p>
<p>even though he&rsquo;s serving a long sentence.</p>
<p>So that leads me to guess that people inside</p>
<p>the Putin regime and maybe President Putin himself</p>
<p>understand that Navalny is their ticket to lift sanctions.</p>
<p>That Navalny is even more popular outside of Russia</p>
<p>than he is inside of Russia.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the leader in many ways of the political opposition</p>
<p>in the country, even while still in prison,</p>
<p>his organization&rsquo;s been destroyed,</p>
<p>but he doesn&rsquo;t have majority support in the population</p>
<p>by any stretch of the imagination,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a big figure in the West,</p>
<p>including here in the US.</p>
<p>And so Navalny could be their ticket.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of get out of jail card,</p>
<p>meaning they release him from prison.</p>
<p>He gets appointed, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>prime minister even by the Putin regime</p>
<p>if he were willing to accept such a position.</p>
<p>And I have my doubts about that.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s how they lobby</p>
<p>to remove the sanctions against them.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a card that President Putin could play.</p>
<p>And so maybe that&rsquo;s the reason he&rsquo;s still alive,</p>
<p>or maybe there are other reasons that we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And so some alternative to Putin is more likely to arise</p>
<p>inside his gang, Putin&rsquo;s Shika, as they say, right?</p>
<p>Inside his gang, where they tire of his mistakes,</p>
<p>they tire of his self defeating actions.</p>
<p>And they say, patriotically for Russia,</p>
<p>we need to do something against, move against this guy</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s hurting our country</p>
<p>and also because I could do better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ambitious as well as patriotic.</p>
<p>But once again, the problem there, Lex,</p>
<p>is Putin is surrounded by this cocoon known as the FSO.</p>
<p>He meets on Zoom, predominantly with the rest</p>
<p>of the government, including with the defense</p>
<p>and security officials.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have frequent access to his person.</p>
<p>And as you were alluding earlier to the pandemic,</p>
<p>they have to quarantine for two weeks</p>
<p>before every meeting with him.</p>
<p>And moreover, you know, Lex, they don&rsquo;t know where he is.</p>
<p>You see, when they&rsquo;re on Zoom with him,</p>
<p>and the room, it&rsquo;s the Valdai.</p>
<p>His office in the Valdai region looks the same</p>
<p>as his office in Sochi,</p>
<p>or his office outside of Moscow in Novogorod.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re made up to look very similar on Zoom.</p>
<p>And sure, some signs they&rsquo;re looking, where is it?</p>
<p>But maybe they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re not sure.</p>
<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t know, and so you&rsquo;re gonna move on him,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna jump him in his Kremlin,</p>
<p>his dacha outside Moscow.</p>
<p>And it turns out he&rsquo;s in Sochi, or vice versa.</p>
<p>And it turns out the FSO is loyal to him</p>
<p>and won&rsquo;t let you anyway.</p>
<p>So Lex, we don&rsquo;t know, but we watch this FSO really closely,</p>
<p>and we think that the elites, if not Putin,</p>
<p>but maybe Putin too, understand Navalny</p>
<p>as a really big potential political card</p>
<p>that they could play.</p>
<p>And one last question, the biggest question.</p>
<p>You studied some of the darkest aspects</p>
<p>of human history, human nature.</p>
<p>Let me ask the why question.</p>
<p>What are we doing here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of our existence,</p>
<p>our life here on Earth?</p>
<p>What are we humans trying to get at here?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t answer that question either,</p>
<p>but I can say that having a purposeful life</p>
<p>is actually not that hard.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re not Gandhi, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna transform a country or a civilization</p>
<p>or become immortal because of your courage</p>
<p>and your insight and your genius at critical moments.</p>
<p>But you live in an environment,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a school, you&rsquo;re in a workplace,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re somewhere where you can affect other people</p>
<p>in a positive way.</p>
<p>It can be not just about yourself,</p>
<p>but it can be about them.</p>
<p>And you can have a positive impact on other people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>through the work that you do,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s your employment or your charity</p>
<p>or your spare time or your work time.</p>
<p>It can be by modeling proper behavior, right?</p>
<p>Admitting your mistakes, hard to do, but necessary.</p>
<p>Remembering that you don&rsquo;t know everything,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t predict the future,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t even know everything</p>
<p>in your areas of expertise.</p>
<p>Painfully reminded of that humility at times,</p>
<p>but remind yourself too.</p>
<p>So you can lead a life that can show others</p>
<p>what good values are,</p>
<p>and you can lead a life that dedicates yourself</p>
<p>not only to your own material wellbeing,</p>
<p>but to the wellbeing</p>
<p>and to the development of others around you.</p>
<p>And it can be on a humble scale.</p>
<p>It can be in a small classroom or a small workplace,</p>
<p>a small work team, but it can be done.</p>
<p>And you can be reminded that having a positive impact</p>
<p>even on one other person</p>
<p>gives far greater meaning to your own life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s profoundly satisfying,</p>
<p>much more satisfying than the attention you might get,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say on social media or awards you might receive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with pursuing those.</p>
<p>People pursue them and it&rsquo;s a free society.</p>
<p>But leading a purposeful life intentionally is possible.</p>
<p>Even just one person, I love the expression,</p>
<p>save one life, save the world.</p>
<p>Just focusing on the local,</p>
<p>on the tiny little difference you can make in the world</p>
<p>can somehow ripple.</p>
<p>Every day.</p>
<p>If you think about that every single day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a better person.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a better society.</p>
<p>And maybe you get to add a bit of love to the world</p>
<p>after all.</p>
<p>Steven, this is a huge honor for many reasons,</p>
<p>one of which is I can just tell</p>
<p>how much care you put into this conversation</p>
<p>and how much, I use the word love a lot,</p>
<p>but I just feel the love that,</p>
<p>just even the respect you give me,</p>
<p>which I can&rsquo;t tell you how energizing that is,</p>
<p>how much that gives me strength</p>
<p>for my own silly little pursuits.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for doing that.</p>
<p>Thank you for not just talking today,</p>
<p>but giving me so much respect</p>
<p>just with everything you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>It makes me feel special.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for sitting down and talking today.</p>
<p>Mutual, Lex, thank you as well</p>
<p>and thank you for the respect that you&rsquo;ve shown me.</p>
<p>These are really difficult issues</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have simple answers.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we give up.</p>
<p>We have to keep thinking and learning and trying</p>
<p>and finding solutions in everything we do,</p>
<p>including on these big global tragedies</p>
<p>that we live through.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s heartbreaking what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>It just breaks my heart every day.</p>
<p>A person who studies this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying this for decades,</p>
<p>and it keeps happening.</p>
<p>And you think, again, and yes, it is again,</p>
<p>but we still have to keep trying</p>
<p>and we have to be inspired</p>
<p>by those people who are more courageous than we are</p>
<p>and sacrifice more than we sacrifice.</p>
<p>For me, the Russian invasion of Ukraine,</p>
<p>the war in Ukraine is experienced in my study at home</p>
<p>and in my office at Princeton</p>
<p>or my coming office at Stanford</p>
<p>when I moved full time to Stanford in September.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s experienced far away in safety and in comfort.</p>
<p>And we have to remember that too</p>
<p>when we talk about these things,</p>
<p>when we answer your questions, right?</p>
<p>That as we speak and as we comment</p>
<p>and think we&rsquo;re experts on these things</p>
<p>from the comfort of our existence,</p>
<p>that there are people in those tragedies right now.</p>
<p>With no power, with no food,</p>
<p>with no, with full uncertainty about the future</p>
<p>of the health of their children.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve also seen, because I have family in both places,</p>
<p>homes that were home for,</p>
<p>buildings that were homes for generations now in rubble.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yes, Lex, it just, it hurts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s Syria,</p>
<p>where 350,000 at least by UN estimates died</p>
<p>and Russia participated in that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s Yemen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so many other places</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have the same degree of attention</p>
<p>that a European country like Ukraine has.</p>
<p>But yeah, we have to remember also</p>
<p>that in addition to Ukraine,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s things right home here in New York City</p>
<p>where children are without food.</p>
<p>Which is just inexcusable in a country this rich.</p>
<p>So we shouldn&rsquo;t forget in our study of leaders</p>
<p>and our study of geopolitics</p>
<p>that ultimately it&rsquo;s about the humanity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the human beings and.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Okay, Lex.</p>
<p>Human suffering.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Stephen.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>This is an amazing conversation.</p>
<p>Talk to you again soon.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Stephen Kotkin.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<p>When I despair, I remember that all through history,</p>
<p>the way of truth and love have always won.</p>
<p>There have been tyrants and murderers</p>
<p>and for a time they can seem invincible,</p>
<p>but in the end, they always fall.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
