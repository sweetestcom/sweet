that i don&amp;rsquo;t have a video comparing vitamin k1 to vitamin k2 so i wanted to create this video to talk about each one vitamin k1 has everything to do with blood clotting and bone metabolism if you&amp;rsquo;re deficient in vitamin k1 you may have bruising or if you cut yourself and you&amp;rsquo;re bleeding and it&amp;rsquo;s taking a very long time to clot or heal up you can be deficient in vitamin k1 also if you have if you have bleeding gums if you&amp;rsquo;re brushing your teeth now that could be also vitamin c but it could also be a deficiency of vitamin k1 so vitamin k1 is very very important to your survival because if you didn&amp;rsquo;t have it and you got injured you could literally bleed to death internally or externally so based on that our bodies have made sure that we rarely ever run out of vitamin k1 and on top of that there&amp;rsquo;s so many different foods that we eat that have vitamin k1 it&amp;rsquo;s very unlikely you&amp;rsquo;re going to be deficient especially since the requirement for k1 are not even milligrams they&amp;rsquo;re in micrograms so we need very small amounts to satisfy the requirements now where do you get vitamin k1 primarily from plant sources now vitamin k1 is also in animal foods as well but not in the amounts that you would get from plants like leafy greens now just to switch over to vitamin k2 this nutrient has everything to do with calcium control it prevents calcium from accumulating in your vascular system and it also has everything to do with bone strength so it keeps the calcium in the bone and it keeps the calcium out of the soft tissues and vitamin k2 is primarily in animal products like animal fat and it&amp;rsquo;s also in fermented food like natto which is a fermented soybean it&amp;rsquo;s also in sauerkraut but it&amp;rsquo;s very very high in beef liver for example or pork liver or pork proteins or chicken or beef egg yolks soft cheeses so right there you can see that our bodies were meant to consume both plant and animal foods based on nutrients that our body needs now i realize that vitamin k is fat soluble so the vitamin k1 in plants is very poorly absorbed in fact you only absorb less than 10 percent of it good thing you don&amp;rsquo;t need very much but it&amp;rsquo;s very poorly absorbed but as a survival mechanism what we&amp;rsquo;ve done to counteract that is we just recycle the vitamin k1 so if you&amp;rsquo;re not consuming much k1 our body&amp;rsquo;s going to take what we have and keep recycling it over and over and over now vitamin k2 is much better absorbed why because it comes with fat and any time you consume a fat-soluble vitamin with fat you&amp;rsquo;re going to absorb it more it&amp;rsquo;s also going to stimulate bile which is going to help you absorb that fat cycle vitamin so it&amp;rsquo;s a combination of bile and then the pancreatic enzyme called lipase that helps you break down the food and absorb these nutrients more effectively now what most people do including myself when you&amp;rsquo;re doing a salad for example you&amp;rsquo;re going to be using oil like olive oil to help the absorption you&amp;rsquo;re going to help the absorption of vitamin k1 now one thing you need to know about vitamin k2 is that the bacteria in your colon can actually make k1 from vitamin k2 so this is another survival mechanism that if you have the microbes in your gut you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make more k2 from k1 if you&amp;rsquo;re on a low-fat diet that&amp;rsquo;s going to be a problem to get this if you have inflammation in your gut anywhere as diverticulitis or colitis or crohn&amp;rsquo;s any digestive issue you&amp;rsquo;re going to have malabsorption you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be able to absorb this one or this one as well if you had your gallbladder removed that could also create a deficiency because you&amp;rsquo;re not going to make enough bile in which case you just need to take purified bile salts if you have a fatty liver or your liver is damaged you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be able to make bile to be able to use that to absorb these two fat soluble vitamins as well if you&amp;rsquo;re on a blood thinner like warfarin that&amp;rsquo;s going to block k1 and you will have deficiencies of that and as a side note if you are on warfarin i have a video explaining the types of vegetables you should be consuming which are low in vitamin k1 if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in doing the diet that i always recommend which is healthy keto basically you just eliminate the leafy greens and you do other types of vegetables i put that video right down below alright guys so now you know the difference between vitamin k1 and k2 before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the u."><title>Vitamin K1 vs. K2： What’s the Difference？ ｜ DrEricBergDC | SWIEST</title>

comparing vitamin k1 to vitamin k2 so i wanted to  </p><p>create this video to talk about each one vitamin 
k1 has everything to do with blood clotting  </p><p>and bone metabolism if you&rsquo;re deficient in 
vitamin k1 you may have bruising or if you  </p><p>cut yourself and you&rsquo;re bleeding and it&rsquo;s taking 
a very long time to clot or heal up you can be  </p><p>deficient in vitamin k1 also if you have if you 
have bleeding gums if you&rsquo;re brushing your teeth  </p><p>now that could be also vitamin c but it could 
also be a deficiency of vitamin k1 so vitamin k1  </p><p>is very very important to your survival because if 
you didn&rsquo;t have it and you got injured you could  </p><p>literally bleed to death internally or externally 
so based on that our bodies have made sure that we  </p><p>rarely ever run out of vitamin k1 and on top 
of that there&rsquo;s so many different foods that  </p><p>we eat that have vitamin k1 it&rsquo;s very unlikely 
you&rsquo;re going to be deficient especially since  </p><p>the requirement for k1 are not even milligrams 
they&rsquo;re in micrograms so we need very small  </p><p>amounts to satisfy the requirements now where do 
you get vitamin k1 primarily from plant sources  </p><p>now vitamin k1 is also in animal foods as well 
but not in the amounts that you would get from  </p><p>plants like leafy greens now just to switch over 
to vitamin k2 this nutrient has everything to  </p><p>do with calcium control it prevents calcium from 
accumulating in your vascular system and it also  </p><p>has everything to do with bone strength so it 
keeps the calcium in the bone and it keeps the  </p><p>calcium out of the soft tissues and vitamin k2 
is primarily in animal products like animal fat  </p><p>and it&rsquo;s also in fermented food like natto which 
is a fermented soybean it&rsquo;s also in sauerkraut  </p><p>but it&rsquo;s very very high in beef liver for example 
or pork liver or pork proteins or chicken or beef  </p><p>egg yolks soft cheeses so right 
there you can see that our bodies  </p><p>were meant to consume both plant and animal 
foods based on nutrients that our body needs  </p><p>now i realize that vitamin k is fat soluble so 
the vitamin k1 in plants is very poorly absorbed  </p><p>in fact you only absorb less than 10 percent 
of it good thing you don&rsquo;t need very much  </p><p>but it&rsquo;s very poorly absorbed but as a survival 
mechanism what we&rsquo;ve done to counteract that is we  </p><p>just recycle the vitamin k1 so if you&rsquo;re not 
consuming much k1 our body&rsquo;s going to take what  </p><p>we have and keep recycling it over and over and 
over now vitamin k2 is much better absorbed why  </p><p>because it comes with fat and any time 
you consume a fat-soluble vitamin with  </p><p>fat you&rsquo;re going to absorb it more it&rsquo;s also 
going to stimulate bile which is going to help  </p><p>you absorb that fat cycle vitamin so it&rsquo;s a 
combination of bile and then the pancreatic  </p><p>enzyme called lipase that helps you break down the 
food and absorb these nutrients more effectively  </p><p>now what most people do including myself when 
you&rsquo;re doing a salad for example you&rsquo;re going to  </p><p>be using oil like olive oil to help the absorption 
you&rsquo;re going to help the absorption of vitamin k1  </p><p>now one thing you need to know about vitamin 
k2 is that the bacteria in your colon  </p><p>can actually make k1 from vitamin k2 so this is 
another survival mechanism that if you have the  </p><p>microbes in your gut you&rsquo;ll be able to make 
more k2 from k1 if you&rsquo;re on a low-fat diet  </p><p>that&rsquo;s going to be a problem to get this if 
you have inflammation in your gut anywhere as  </p><p>diverticulitis or colitis or crohn&rsquo;s any digestive 
issue you&rsquo;re going to have malabsorption you&rsquo;re  </p><p>not going to be able to absorb this one or this 
one as well if you had your gallbladder removed  </p><p>that could also create a deficiency because you&rsquo;re 
not going to make enough bile in which case you  </p><p>just need to take purified bile salts if you have 
a fatty liver or your liver is damaged you&rsquo;re not  </p><p>going to be able to make bile to be able to use 
that to absorb these two fat soluble vitamins  </p><p>as well if you&rsquo;re on a blood thinner 
like warfarin that&rsquo;s going to block  </p><p>k1 and you will have deficiencies of that 
and as a side note if you are on warfarin  </p><p>i have a video explaining the types of 
vegetables you should be consuming which are low  </p><p>in vitamin k1 if you&rsquo;re interested in doing the 
diet that i always recommend which is healthy keto  </p><p>basically you just eliminate the leafy 
greens and you do other types of vegetables  </p><p>i put that video right down below alright guys 
so now you know the difference between vitamin k1  </p><p>and k2 before you go if you have a question about 
a product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want to  </p><p>know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and you 
need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth  </p><p>i have a keto consultant standing 
by to help you this is just for the  </p><p>people in the u.s hopefully in the future 
we&rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&rsquo;s call  </p><p>but i put the number down below 
so you can call and get some help</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
