    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>Attention.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been podcasting since like the Stone Age, 2005.</p>
<p>And way back then and for a long time afterwards, I kind of considered all the other people</p>
<p>who were podcasting as my colleagues.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not really in the sort of industry where you say, yes, my colleagues, and we publish</p>
<p>papers or whatever the normal idea of what you might consider a colleague to be.</p>
<p>But it really felt the same, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re struggling through the same things, learning the same things, running into each</p>
<p>other in places, either in person or digitally.</p>
<p>These days, of course, it&rsquo;s a lot harder to call every podcaster your colleague when I</p>
<p>think I saw a number recently that it&rsquo;s north of 500,000 podcasts or something.</p>
<p>But the person I&rsquo;m about to talk to is undoubtedly my podcast colleague because, well, heck,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a history podcaster.</p>
<p>So right there, we&rsquo;re in a pretty small gene pool.</p>
<p>And he is one of the great podcasters ever.</p>
<p>His The History of Rome podcast is legendary.</p>
<p>In my mind, it sort of makes him the audio, the modern audio equivalent of Edward Gibbon</p>
<p>where he goes like the length and breadth of the entire Roman experience to the fall</p>
<p>of the Western Empire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hugely popular in one of those podcasts that should be in some section of the Hall</p>
<p>of Fame someday.</p>
<p>His other one is an amazingly ambitious project, which he pulls off wonderfully.</p>
<p>And judging from the success, everyone seems to like revolutions where he looks at different</p>
<p>revolutions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be very interesting to talk to Mike Duncan today about his new book, The Storm</p>
<p>Before the Storm.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t know enough about this, his book will educate you wonderfully.</p>
<p>His show, of course, is available out there.</p>
<p>The longest series we ever did was on this period of Roman history, the death throes</p>
<p>of the Republic.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots of stuff out there.</p>
<p>But I have a feeling most of you are already going to know a ton of this stuff because</p>
<p>Rome is wildly popular, which is one of the first questions I ask my history podcast colleague,</p>
<p>the great Mike Duncan.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I wanted to do a podcast on Cleopatra.</p>
<p>And I sat down, decided it, ordered a bunch of books, and then tried to figure out where</p>
<p>you should start the story of Cleopatra.</p>
<p>And every time I would go backwards, I would find a domino connected to another domino</p>
<p>and another domino.</p>
<p>Long story short, that show I wanted to do Cleopatra about, or the show I wanted to do</p>
<p>about Cleopatra, turned into the longest series we&rsquo;ve ever done because you have to go all</p>
<p>the way back to a long way in Roman history for the dynamics to become, you know, even</p>
<p>remotely clear.</p>
<p>And people tend to focus on, you know, if this is the Titanic story, the actual sinking</p>
<p>of the ship.</p>
<p>But Mike, your new book, The Storm Before the Storm, is about the iceberg and the striking</p>
<p>of the iceberg.</p>
<p>You know, tell us a little bit about, you know, this story that most people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>as well as the actual sinking of the ship.</p>
<p>Yeah, the way that I put it.</p>
<p>So my book is The Storm Before the Storm, the beginning of the end of the Roman Republic.</p>
<p>It covers the period from 146 BC around there to about 78 BC, which is the death of Sulla.</p>
<p>And it covers the couple of generations before Julius Caesar comes along, before Octavian</p>
<p>comes along, before Antony and Cleopatra are around, to start looking, as you say, at the</p>
<p>things that led up to the collapse of the Roman Republic, rather than just jumping right</p>
<p>into it.</p>
<p>And you say it&rsquo;s, you know, people like to focus on the sinking of the ship.</p>
<p>And I say that jumping into Caesar is like jumping into a movie at the third act, at</p>
<p>the beginning of the third act, where, you know, everything is, you know, loud and crazy</p>
<p>and people are fighting with each other.</p>
<p>And obviously, people are really passionately committed to this, that, or the other thing.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t know how it got to this point.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what were the problems that led the Republic to be so brittle that it</p>
<p>could be blown apart a couple of generations later.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I hope that the book is able to explore.</p>
<p>And then when you read it and you have completed with it, then you&rsquo;ll have a much richer understanding</p>
<p>of why what happens with Caesar happens.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about why we even care what happens to Caesar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little amazed at the not just modern, but ongoing public interest.</p>
<p>And remember, a public that is generally not thought to be all that history knowledgeable</p>
<p>or even care that much about it.</p>
<p>And yet we can continually publish books and make movies and have discussions that</p>
<p>draw comparisons to this Republic from more than 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>What do you think accounts for the enduring interest on the part of even lay people to</p>
<p>this place where, if you think about it, no one should even be&hellip;this shouldn&rsquo;t be in</p>
<p>the front of anyone&rsquo;s mind 1,500, 2,000 years ago?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I mean, for people like us, it&rsquo;s so inherently interesting that it&rsquo;s almost weird to step</p>
<p>back and say, why would anybody be interested in Rome?</p>
<p>Because Rome is, at least to me, so inherently interesting.</p>
<p>I think what it gets to is that people know that Rome was this ancient, powerful civilization.</p>
<p>And it almost is the epitome of what imperial power is, what civilizational power is.</p>
<p>We know that it lasted for 1,000 years or more, if you include the Byzantines.</p>
<p>So I think Rome just is always gonna have a place in the collective imagination as you</p>
<p>go, okay, if you&rsquo;re at all interested in history at all, let&rsquo;s go to sort of the big and important</p>
<p>parts of history.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re always gonna then wind up in Rome.</p>
<p>And specifically where people are gonna wind up is that era between, let&rsquo;s say, the arrival</p>
<p>of Julius Caesar and the death of Nero, the death of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.</p>
<p>That particular era of Roman history, in part because it&rsquo;s so well-documented and we know</p>
<p>so much about it, is always going to be the place where people go to&hellip;</p>
<p>If they become interested in Rome, that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re gonna wind up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a lot the same way that I think that no matter what, the Napoleonic age is gonna</p>
<p>be permanently something that people keep going back to and back to even 2,000 years</p>
<p>later when you&rsquo;re like, wow, this is just like some obscure kind of temporary French</p>
<p>empire.</p>
<p>There is something about the force of the personalities and the force of just the political</p>
<p>power that is being expressed that&rsquo;s always going to draw people&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>I see that with Napoleon, just like I see that with a Hitler or even a Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>But to me, the difference is the length of time&hellip;</p>
<p>Instead of one supreme figure that is searing across the pages of the history book, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re innately interesting, you have numerous figures.</p>
<p>I mean, just going through your book, it&rsquo;s one fascinating individual that seems to be</p>
<p>almost&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, when you think about what the quota of great men should be in any given civilization</p>
<p>during any given time, the period discussed in your book seems to be an era where humanity</p>
<p>in that place in that time is exceeding its normal quota of fascinating, august human</p>
<p>beings.</p>
<p>I would say so, and it&rsquo;s always been a bit surprising to me, having gone through the</p>
<p>history of Rome and gone through the entire history of Rome in pretty minute detail, that</p>
<p>particular period between the Gracchi and then Marius and Sulla was always a period</p>
<p>that I wanted to come back to.</p>
<p>I kind of had put a pin in it very early on and was like, this is an era that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be a lot&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be worth coming back to.</p>
<p>And to have&hellip;</p>
<p>Nobody really have written the book that I wrote, which is, let&rsquo;s just focus on this</p>
<p>50 or 60 year period all on its own.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t make this the first couple of chapters in a larger book about the fall of the Republic.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t make it one chapter in a larger history about just Roman civilization.</p>
<p>But to really hone in on this particular period, I&rsquo;d always kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>I would watch the book lists with one eye, like, is somebody going to finally discover</p>
<p>that this is a great untapped wealth of material?</p>
<p>And nobody quite put it together.</p>
<p>So I was able to step in and now, I hope, deliver a book that will explain why&hellip;</p>
<p>I think when people end the book, they&rsquo;re going to be like, why hasn&rsquo;t this been covered</p>
<p>in more detail?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;ll be one of the big questions coming out of it for people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love your subtitle, The Beginning of the End of the Roman Republic.</p>
<p>It sounds Churchillian, but maybe you could have called it also the era when things broke</p>
<p>because that really is kind of what it was.</p>
<p>And you can see, like you were talking about in the book, the Romans didn&rsquo;t have this written</p>
<p>constitution.</p>
<p>They had sort of a set of conduct rules that were just innately understood by everyone</p>
<p>in customs.</p>
<p>And when they broke that, it&rsquo;s like, okay, there&rsquo;s no written constitution.</p>
<p>So once someone violates the way we do things, the way of the elders, all bets are off, right?</p>
<p>It seemed that way.</p>
<p>There was this thing like, but when Rome triumphs, and what happens in 146 BC for people that</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t like caught up with this, is that Rome conquers Carthage for the last time, their</p>
<p>great rival.</p>
<p>Now, Carthage was unbearable during the Second Punic War, that&rsquo;s about 50 years or so in</p>
<p>the past, but their great rival, Ruth Carthage, is now over and Rome has emerged victorious.</p>
<p>They also decide to just outright conquer and annex Greece into the Roman state.</p>
<p>So at this point in 146 BC, Rome is without question the strongest power in the Mediterranean</p>
<p>world and nobody is going to be able to challenge them.</p>
<p>There is something&hellip;</p>
<p>This triumph actually opens up a whole host of new problems for the Republic and for the</p>
<p>leadership of the Republic that they just sort of start to fail to address and fail</p>
<p>to deal with.</p>
<p>And it creates a powerfully new confrontational style of domestic politics that had never</p>
<p>really existed before.</p>
<p>The Roman Senate and the Roman elites had always been pretty clubby with each other.</p>
<p>They had always been like, oh, there are some&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll ultimately make compromises with each other or if we don&rsquo;t all agree on something,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just put it to bed.</p>
<p>And what happens after 146 is you start having these leaders start to break away and start</p>
<p>to tap into new energies that are floating around out there.</p>
<p>And with this new confrontational style of Roman politics, yeah, people start abandoning</p>
<p>those old unwritten norms and unspoken modes of behavior.</p>
<p>And once you start down that road, I mean, you can pull out of it.</p>
<p>What happened to the Romans is that they were not able to pull out of it.</p>
<p>And if you start going down this road, you ultimately discover that even written laws,</p>
<p>even following written laws is merely a custom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s merely a norm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing about a piece of paper with laws written on it that compels me to do anything,</p>
<p>to follow that law.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just simply&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving it power with my own because that&rsquo;s how we do things.</p>
<p>But if somebody, say, has an army or a gun or a baseball bat, that actually is the ultimate</p>
<p>definer of power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just brute force.</p>
<p>So once you start giving up on sort of what you would call, oh, minor unspoken rules,</p>
<p>you eventually will get to the point where everybody has to admit that only brute force</p>
<p>is really what&rsquo;s at play.</p>
<p>I love that line, whether it was really said or not, that history doesn&rsquo;t repeat, but it</p>
<p>sometimes rhymes.</p>
<p>And I look at the Roman Republic, I think like everyone does.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard not to see patterns and similar dynamics.</p>
<p>And I think for no other reason than because it&rsquo;s another commercial republic that&rsquo;s large</p>
<p>and imperial.</p>
<p>And right there, you&rsquo;re going to have some things that look similar.</p>
<p>And we all understand that if you look a little beneath the surface, there&rsquo;s a ton of things</p>
<p>that are different.</p>
<p>I mean, slavery, outright slavery, for example.</p>
<p>But you point out in your book, and I thought it was interesting, you were drawing comparisons</p>
<p>to if the U.S. and the Roman Republic are following a similar charted course, for lack</p>
<p>of a better word, where would we be now in terms of where the Romans were?</p>
<p>Can you talk a little about that?</p>
<p>Because I thought that was, I mean, if you look at the Punic Wars as like the World Wars</p>
<p>and whatnot, I think it&rsquo;s a fascinating way to come up to a conclusion saying, OK, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done this, we&rsquo;ve done this, we&rsquo;ve done this, we haven&rsquo;t done this yet.</p>
<p>So where do you put us in the book compared to Roman history in a similar place?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So all caveats aside, this is not actually the way that history works.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not like in some repeating-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re speculating wildly and irresponsibly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re putting on different clothes, right?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I do, Mike.</p>
<p>Welcome to my show.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that the Roman Empire is out there and there&rsquo;s like a thousand years worth</p>
<p>of history and we&rsquo;re sitting here in the United States or in the West generally at the beginning</p>
<p>of the 21st century.</p>
<p>And you want to say like, well, what is there that we can look to in Roman history?</p>
<p>Is there a period in time that we can look to that is more analogous to our own situation</p>
<p>than another?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s a lot by process of elimination, where are we a brand new little</p>
<p>city state that has just recently been colonized or founded by a group of dissidents and vagabonds</p>
<p>and escaped slaves?</p>
<p>Like, no, that happened 400 years ago in our own history.</p>
<p>That would be the early days of the colonization of North America.</p>
<p>Are we at a stage where a group of disgruntled aristocrats overthrows a king and establishes</p>
<p>a new kingless republic that is more or less an elite-led oligarchy?</p>
<p>Like, no, that would be, if anything, that&rsquo;s the founding fathers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the American Revolution.</p>
<p>Then what Rome does is it emerges as a new republic and over the next couple of hundred</p>
<p>years it starts to expand slowly across Italy in a series of wars that are collectively</p>
<p>dubbed the Samnite Wars that wind up with Rome being the most dominant power on the</p>
<p>Italian peninsula.</p>
<p>So is the United States a recently emerged regional power?</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t think that anybody would describe the United States as a recently emerged regional</p>
<p>power, and all of that probably corresponds to our slow and steady conquest of North America</p>
<p>and everything that we did to the American Indians, battling with Mexico and taking the</p>
<p>entire north half of their country.</p>
<p>And then you even get later on and you say, well, after that, Rome goes to war with Carthage,</p>
<p>goes to war with Greece, goes to war in Spain, and they emerge as this dominant, what you</p>
<p>might call a global power, at least in the context of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And again, the United States isn&rsquo;t even there because we did all of that.</p>
<p>We are one of the acknowledged great powers, and especially after the Cold War, I mean,</p>
<p>the 1990s, we&rsquo;re describing the United States as a hyper power almost.</p>
<p>Now, I think that&rsquo;s been tempered quite a bit in the last few years, but certainly we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not finding our footing for the first time as a global power.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been dealing with those issues since the end of World War II and all through the</p>
<p>Cold War.</p>
<p>So then you push forward a little bit more and you say, okay, well, has the Republic&hellip;</p>
<p>Have we collapsed into a generations long civil war where a warlord has in effect emerged</p>
<p>victorious from and set himself up as a dictator?</p>
<p>No, that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<p>So if we haven&rsquo;t gotten to that point yet, if the Republic has not yet collapsed, and</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t believe that the Republic has collapsed, then you say, okay, well, maybe</p>
<p>the United States is kind of now roughly in this same setting where after Rome had emerged</p>
<p>as a global power, but before the Republic collapsed, let&rsquo;s take a look at this era.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the beginning of the end of the Republic, which is right after this period, 146 BC,</p>
<p>which as we said earlier in the show, earlier in this interview, is already a period that</p>
<p>is inherently fascinating in its own right.</p>
<p>And as it turns out, I think that they were dealing with a number of issues that you could</p>
<p>say the United States is dealing with right now.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s worth going through what the Romans went through and how they responded to it.</p>
<p>And maybe it could influence how we decide to deal with our own problems today.</p>
<p>I was playing a silly game while I was reading.</p>
<p>Reading your book is to remind me of a bunch of things that I haven&rsquo;t looked at in a while.</p>
<p>And the battles over public land and the distribution of land to veterans and all that stuff, and</p>
<p>the problem that the Romans were having keeping armies in the field when they were essentially,</p>
<p>you know, conscripts is not really the right word, but farmer armies that had to go home</p>
<p>and tend to their home were now on long service, a thousand miles away from home and the farms</p>
<p>going to heck.</p>
<p>And how long can you maintain?</p>
<p>And I thought, you know, if we tried to run our current foreign policy in the United States</p>
<p>military that was operating with the draft situation that we had, say, in the 1950s,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we could do it.</p>
<p>How much does the dynamic of having, you know, a bunch of veterans coming home from these</p>
<p>wars and having, you know, real gripes about the situation that they find themselves in,</p>
<p>the fact that they might have to go back in service, the fact that their homes are falling</p>
<p>apart while they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>Talk to talk a little about that dynamic.</p>
<p>Reminds me a little like the Freikorps in Germany or the bonus marchers in our own history.</p>
<p>I mean, a bunch of long service military veterans angry with nothing to do sounds like a recipe</p>
<p>for political change, we&rsquo;ll just say.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say so.</p>
<p>And what is happening is, it&rsquo;s one of these situations where, again, the Romans had been</p>
<p>more or less running what you might call a glorified militia, where you would enter into</p>
<p>the service, you would actually, if harvest time came and everybody was still fighting</p>
<p>each other, like both sides would quit the field and everybody would go home and harvest</p>
<p>their fields.</p>
<p>And these imperial wars of expansion that Rome got caught in, yes, starts to take the</p>
<p>poor, the lower class citizens away from their farms, away from their families for longer</p>
<p>and longer periods of time.</p>
<p>And so this period of triumph is for the Roman state, for the Republic itself as an entity,</p>
<p>the Senate and the people of Rome, turns out to be fairly economically disastrous for</p>
<p>a lot of these lower class Roman citizens.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna start to lose their farms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna start to get bought out by wealthy neighbors, because you&rsquo;d rather take some</p>
<p>money and get out while you can than watch it all go to ruin.</p>
<p>So yeah, it really does.</p>
<p>And the bonus marchers are a good example of this, which happened right in the midst</p>
<p>of the Great Depression here in the United States, is that they had these grievances,</p>
<p>they had these legitimate grievances, their families had had these farms for in perpetuity,</p>
<p>going back into the misty eras of the early Republic or even the kingdom days.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re now starting to lose all of that, and their traditional ways of life are being</p>
<p>upset.</p>
<p>And they are feeling that the Senate and the government of Rome is&hellip;</p>
<p>They are consolidating all of this massive imperial wealth, but none of it seems to be</p>
<p>trickling down to the poor farmers, to the poor citizens.</p>
<p>So you have a situation where these new leaders, as I was saying, you can start to break out</p>
<p>and say, hey&hellip;</p>
<p>As a noble leader, you can say, hey, I think that there&rsquo;s an opportunity for me here to</p>
<p>get enormous political influence and political power and political popularity by promising</p>
<p>these people who have all of these grievances, I&rsquo;m gonna solve your problems.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna go to the rich, we&rsquo;re gonna take their land basically by force, we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>chop it up and we&rsquo;re gonna redistribute it to all of you.</p>
<p>This is an incredibly popular thing that can be done.</p>
<p>And this opens the new Populare style of Roman politics, which is instead of this elite noble</p>
<p>consensus being the driver of your policies, it&rsquo;s directly appealing to the rural peasants</p>
<p>and the urban plebs who are feeling negative effects from Rome&rsquo;s imperial triumph rather</p>
<p>than a bunch of positive effects.</p>
<p>Well, and it brings up the age old question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to get your opinion on it as a guy who&rsquo;s talked about Rome as much or more than</p>
<p>anyone I can think of.</p>
<p>The idea that these people who appealed to the popular crowd, were they really&hellip;</p>
<p>Was that a real position or was that they just had latched onto a political wind, they</p>
<p>put their finger in the wind, find out, oh, this cause of giving land to the veterans</p>
<p>is popular, so I&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>It seems to me that if I look at it as a novice, some of these reformers look more real than</p>
<p>others.</p>
<p>Do you have a feeling, I mean, like Caius and Tiberius Gracchi, I mean, to me, those</p>
<p>seem&hellip;</p>
<p>People always like to compare them to the Kennedy brothers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you have two brothers, both assassinated, both that a lot of people</p>
<p>were able to romantically put a lot of hopes in and lionize afterwards.</p>
<p>I mean, do you look at those guys as sincere reformers or are they all charlatans working</p>
<p>a political angle?</p>
<p>Or are none of them?</p>
<p>No, I have an answer to this because now I&rsquo;ve gone through it.</p>
<p>And this is, as you point out, this is one of the great debates in Roman history generally,</p>
<p>and also just like world history in general, is are these various popular reformers, are</p>
<p>they merely cynical demagogues or are they genuinely interested in reforming the state?</p>
<p>And certainly, even while the Gracchi were still alive, their allies were saying, oh,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re driven by lofty ideals and a genuine regard for the people, and their enemies are</p>
<p>producing pamphlets that say, oh, no, they&rsquo;re trying to make themselves the new kings of</p>
<p>Rome.</p>
<p>So where I do come down on it about the Gracchi in particular, I think that they were interested</p>
<p>in genuine reform.</p>
<p>There was no altruism at work here.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about high Roman politics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of altruism going around out there.</p>
<p>But I think that they saw simultaneously that a path to personal power, which is what they</p>
<p>were after, they were incredibly ambitious, could simultaneously solve a lot of the problems</p>
<p>that Rome was now dealing with as it transitioned from being merely an Italian city-state, one</p>
<p>among many, to the rulers of the entire Mediterranean world.</p>
<p>But they existed on a spectrum where this same milieu of populare energy coming out</p>
<p>of the rural peasants or the urban plebs, even in the lower equestrian classes that</p>
<p>have a lot of wealth but don&rsquo;t have a lot of input politically, those can be harnessed</p>
<p>by people like the Gracchi, and they can also be harnessed by cynical demagogues who, yes,</p>
<p>are just there to say, hey, you&rsquo;re angry.</p>
<p>I know that you&rsquo;re angry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to help you channel that anger, and I&rsquo;m going to tell you who&rsquo;s to blame for</p>
<p>all of your problems, and then I&rsquo;m going to point you at the people who I&rsquo;m telling you</p>
<p>are to blame for it, and, oh, wouldn&rsquo;t you know it?</p>
<p>The people who are to blame for it are my personal enemies.</p>
<p>So you can use that same&hellip;</p>
<p>It becomes quite a revolutionary energy.</p>
<p>You can start to use that and manipulate it.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s never fair to say that all of them are sincere reformers or all of them</p>
<p>are cynical demagogues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite a mix of the two, and people are going to land on a spectrum, and people say&hellip;</p>
<p>People bring up the Kennedy brothers for the Gracchi, which doesn&rsquo;t really hold a lot</p>
<p>of water, but if there is anybody in American history who does look like the Gracchi, I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the Roosevelts, where what Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt and that,</p>
<p>the progressive reforms that they were making, both of them were incredibly ambitious.</p>
<p>Both of them wanted to be president.</p>
<p>Both of them kind of wanted to be president forever.</p>
<p>And they were called traitors to their class.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they were, of course, they were&hellip;</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>They were very similar to the Gracchi in that way, that they were inner circle nobility,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re using all of their power and wealth and influence to really disrupt what the elites</p>
<p>have going for them.</p>
<p>So I think if anybody is out there in American history that does look like the Gracchi, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably the Roosevelts.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m enjoying the analogy comparison too much to stop now.</p>
<p>So maybe you can give me&hellip;</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about some of these other figures in your book and thought about</p>
<p>American examples?</p>
<p>I can look at like a Huey Long, for example, and see someone that maybe would have fit</p>
<p>back into the Roman things.</p>
<p>I remember, was it Manchester&rsquo;s book on MacArthur and American Caesar?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always comparisons.</p>
<p>When you look at the Solos and the Mauruses and Cato the Elder and all those folks, do</p>
<p>you have any analogies that you often think of when you think of some of these major figures?</p>
<p>Well, not to rain on anybody&rsquo;s parade, but once you get onto that granular level, like</p>
<p>who would Drusus be?</p>
<p>It does start to get harder to pin people down.</p>
<p>Was MacArthur an American Caesar?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it seems like probably a good thing that Truman fired him.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an insult to Caesar myself, but I&rsquo;m biased.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would say so.</p>
<p>Of all the people that I&rsquo;ve ever gone through that you can compare to Julius Caesar, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Napoleon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>He really measures up to that particular class of having the totality of I can be genocidal</p>
<p>and also reform the metric system.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a genius, yes.</p>
<p>So have I successfully dodged the question?</p>
<p>Yes, I think so.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Well done.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So then let&rsquo;s talk then a little bit about the dynamics here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because when you look at the Roman system, it seems to be the wonderful, unless</p>
<p>you want to go to the Greeks, but it&rsquo;s the wonderful example of the class divisions and</p>
<p>then the problems inherent with class warfare and sharing of power.</p>
<p>I mean, if you wanted to describe, I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about the iceberg that sinks</p>
<p>the Titanic here, and we can talk about rules shifting and warlords and everything.</p>
<p>But what was it that shifted in terms of a public being willing to accept senatorial</p>
<p>control by, as you pointed out in the book, a really small number of people in a fundamental</p>
<p>sense and be able to push?</p>
<p>I mean, the Tribune of the Plebs was one systemic tool that was introduced to help balance out</p>
<p>those powers.</p>
<p>Could you say that that whole era between Tiberius Gracchus and maybe Caesar is an example</p>
<p>of class warfare sort of playing out?</p>
<p>I mean, how much of a role would you give to that?</p>
<p>Class men versus class warfare versus cycles and trends?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really difficult to get into because Roman politics did operate differently than</p>
<p>modern Western politics.</p>
<p>Like the client system, for example.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the first and most important thing is to say that these are more like clan rivalries</p>
<p>than class warfare, where you&rsquo;re a patron, you&rsquo;re a leader, and you have this network</p>
<p>of clients who are all attached to you, and then your political rivals have that same</p>
<p>network of clients who are all attached to them.</p>
<p>So this is really clans running into each other with almost like nobles and retainers,</p>
<p>if you wanted to use a medieval analogy, rather than like, oh, we&rsquo;re the lower classes and</p>
<p>we are trying to overthrow you guys, the upper classes.</p>
<p>But that said, during this era, right, after 146, I think you do have a new class style</p>
<p>of politics that one of these rival clans can take advantage of, right?</p>
<p>And so hopefully I&rsquo;m able to paint this correctly.</p>
<p>So what it is, is you have this ability to go out into just the voting public, right?</p>
<p>Because all of these people could vote, the rural peasants, the urban plebs, they could</p>
<p>all vote, and you could use the popular assemblies to pass legislation to make yourself and your</p>
<p>own clan very, very popular.</p>
<p>So this is almost something that you would be sitting around with your senatorial family,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an ambitious senatorial family, and you&rsquo;re like, how are we going to get power?</p>
<p>That appeal to the populace is an available method of doing it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re ginning up class interests, and you&rsquo;re pointing them at often&hellip;</p>
<p>Usually you&rsquo;re pointing it at the corrupt Senate and saying, we are going to deliver</p>
<p>to you what the corrupt Senate has been denying you.</p>
<p>But five years later or 10 years later, maybe your rival has decided to try to adopt one</p>
<p>of these popular platforms and use that, well, now you suddenly become the defender of old</p>
<p>senatorial interests, because your rival is the one who&rsquo;s now doing the popular program.</p>
<p>So it was a lot of taking on and putting off of hats, where you might temporarily be the</p>
<p>leader of a popular movement, and then 10 years later, you might be standing in lockstep</p>
<p>with the Senate.</p>
<p>So it was a lot more fluid, I think, than anything that would be going on, say, with</p>
<p>battles between unions, battles between socialists and capitalists in the modern era, where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really class interests involved, and you really had also lower class leaders doing the leading</p>
<p>in that sense, which you don&rsquo;t really get that in Roman history.</p>
<p>No, and it was interesting, because you had included in the book something, I think it</p>
<p>was Cato the Elder had talked about, and we&rsquo;re getting back here to the changes in Rome because</p>
<p>of the Punic Wars and the various conquests, about the amount of wealth that was being</p>
<p>dragged back to Rome by some of these people, because most of the people don&rsquo;t benefit from</p>
<p>these conquests, but some of these commanders and whatnot would come back.</p>
<p>You were talking about 40,000 pounds of silver and things like that.</p>
<p>Talk a little about how, and this is such a Roman moralizer point of view, right, about</p>
<p>how the nouveau riche Romans are forgetting their values, but you included it in the book.</p>
<p>How much did the Roman system change?</p>
<p>Because all of a sudden it went from, well, at least the portrayals of it make it sound</p>
<p>like more Spartan, more old values to, you know, Cato the Elder looking at the nice figs</p>
<p>and saying, Carthage must be destroyed.</p>
<p>I think that the role of this new wealth, there&rsquo;s a couple of things that all of this</p>
<p>new wealth does bring into play, right?</p>
<p>Like the Cato the Elder style critique, which is that all of this wealth degraded the morality</p>
<p>of the upper class or degraded the morality of the Romans, I think is less important.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that is a huge driver of what the problem was.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was that the wealth degraded their morals.</p>
<p>I think it was that it created a skyrocketing economic inequality, right, where there had</p>
<p>always been rich and poor in Rome, right?</p>
<p>That is going to be true going all the way back.</p>
<p>What was happening is that, as you just mentioned, and I read about this in the book, that you</p>
<p>have these legions going out, they&rsquo;re going out to Greece and Macedonia, they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to North Africa, and they&rsquo;re bringing back 300,000 gold coins.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re bringing back 80,000 pounds of raw silver.</p>
<p>I mean, literally, like the species of&hellip;</p>
<p>The available species of the Mediterranean is being thrown into Roman wagons and hauled</p>
<p>back to Rome, all of which is being controlled mostly by that upper class senatorial elite</p>
<p>or the richer equestrian classes, right, the sort of the sub-senate, the people who are</p>
<p>one step below the senators.</p>
<p>These guys are the ones who are controlling all of this wealth.</p>
<p>And I do think that far from degrading the morality of the thing, it does degrade the</p>
<p>socioeconomic system, where what are they going to do with all this gold?</p>
<p>The Romans did not&hellip;</p>
<p>They did not sit around counting their gold pieces like Scrooge in A Christmas Carol.</p>
<p>They want to invest their gold into things, and most especially, they want to invest it</p>
<p>in land.</p>
<p>So their ability to now command this huge, huge amount of wealth, they&rsquo;re pouring it</p>
<p>into trying to buy up as much land as they possibly can.</p>
<p>And this does lead to the further dispossession of all of those poorer Roman farmers that</p>
<p>we talked about a couple of minutes ago.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that process that is unfolding, that wealth being controlled by a few rich</p>
<p>families is leading those rich families to expand their own land holdings across Italy,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just going to disrupt the entire socioeconomic system that had been in existence</p>
<p>for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the one thing that they&rsquo;re investing all of their money in.</p>
<p>And the other thing that they&rsquo;re investing all of their money in is slaves.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re now able&hellip;</p>
<p>The richer Romans are now able to bring slaves into the system on, again, an unprecedented</p>
<p>scale.</p>
<p>The Romans had always had slaves.</p>
<p>Slaves had always been around.</p>
<p>But now you really have the slaves beginning to do most of the at least commercial labor</p>
<p>of Roman society.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out there, they&rsquo;re doing work in the grape fields, they&rsquo;re doing the olives.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re skilled, if you get captured and you&rsquo;re like, hey, I can make tables, then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be put to work making tables for your owner.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re really unlucky, you&rsquo;re going to be sent off to work in one of the mines.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s just going to be producing more and more wealth for the senatorial aristocracy.</p>
<p>So that combination of massive amounts of wealth, massive amounts of slaves, but always</p>
<p>really to the benefit of a very small elite inside of Rome creates, I think, the fundamentally</p>
<p>destabilizing energy that is going to allow some of these, be they genuine reformers all</p>
<p>the way to cynical demagogues, or all the way ultimately culminating with Julius Caesar,</p>
<p>who is the popular reformer slash super ambitious noble par excellence, it&rsquo;s all going to culminate</p>
<p>with him.</p>
<p>And the slaves to me is the ultimate different variable when they do the comparisons between,</p>
<p>say, the US now and the Roman Republic.</p>
<p>Because even if you wanted to argue about slave labor being equivalent to low income</p>
<p>labor from over the border or whatever, I don&rsquo;t see the similarity.</p>
<p>And it would be, if you wanted to make an analogy with what the Romans did or what a</p>
<p>lot of peoples did in earlier history, it would be like we went into the Middle East,</p>
<p>toppled Saddam Hussein, and brought thousands of Iraqis back to the United States to serve</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p>It sounds like an inherently unstable situation to begin with.</p>
<p>I found it interesting when you were talking about who had power in Rome and you talked</p>
<p>about assemblies and that the average Joe on the street had more, I would say both more</p>
<p>and less power maybe than one thought, but you&rsquo;re lying about being able to control.</p>
<p>I think in England, they called it King Mob at one point, the ability to control the political</p>
<p>heart of Rome as the population gave a certain amount of power in the city.</p>
<p>It always amazed me that in that kind of a situation that you never had a French Revolution</p>
<p>kind of thing when it&rsquo;s so much a large percentage of the population being balanced out by such</p>
<p>a small class, but it&rsquo;s that client relationship that sort of weaves the threads of connections,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it, through the rich, the poor, and the middle classes.</p>
<p>And could you talk a minute about the equestrian class maybe and a connection to what today</p>
<p>we would call corporations and the fact that because the Roman senators were not supposed</p>
<p>to involve themselves in business, it sort of left a loophole for these other people</p>
<p>to come in and create what I think today we would call corporations.</p>
<p>You think that&rsquo;s a fair term?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that they were corporations.</p>
<p>You would actually buy stock in these things.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In a rudimentary way that&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there was this prohibition on the senators, like somebody who was in the Senate and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about maybe 300, 350 men and their families are prohibited from conducting commercial</p>
<p>transactions.</p>
<p>And of course, just the caveat to this is that all of them did it.</p>
<p>They all had fronts.</p>
<p>They all had clients that they would use were like, oh, this is my guy, Publius.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s somebody who just so happens to own a large amount of commercial real estate and</p>
<p>I just happen to know him.</p>
<p>It was all a front.</p>
<p>So most senators were able to dodge this quite easily.</p>
<p>But the Roman state itself didn&rsquo;t perform any of their own logistical enterprises, right?</p>
<p>Even right down to tax collection, right?</p>
<p>The Romans did not have state employees who were tax collectors.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have state employees who made uniforms for the legions and shipped them</p>
<p>off to the legions.</p>
<p>This was all done by groups of wealthy individuals who were not in the Senate because you want</p>
<p>to be able to get around that, the commercial prohibitions.</p>
<p>So you have these very wealthy families in Rome who are not a part of the Senate who</p>
<p>are actually the ones who are now handling the wealth of the society, the large scale</p>
<p>transactions.</p>
<p>What they would do is they would come together, say the tax collectors, if you want one of</p>
<p>these tax farming contracts, and you would say, okay, here&rsquo;s how much we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>bid to get this contract.</p>
<p>And then the censor once every five years would award a contract and let&rsquo;s say your</p>
<p>company won the bid, then you would now have the right to go to some province or go to</p>
<p>some area and be in charge of the tax collection where any amount of money that you made out</p>
<p>collecting taxes above what you had bid was going to be your profit.</p>
<p>That model of extracting taxes from provincials left itself open to wild corruption and abuse</p>
<p>where if your profit margin is simply however much you can get out of these people, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to lead you to strong armed people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to lead you to demand more than they actually owed in taxes.</p>
<p>And the Roman government, the Roman provincial administrations, I mean, the people who would</p>
<p>actually be out there in nearer Spain or in further Spain actually representing the Roman</p>
<p>government as like a state agent, I mean, you&rsquo;re talking about less than 100 people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about it&rsquo;s the governor, his family, and maybe a couple other elected</p>
<p>officials.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the face of Rome out there, the people who are actually running the province</p>
<p>are these tax farmers with very little oversight.</p>
<p>And if you were a tax farmer, you could go to a family and say like, hey, you owe me</p>
<p>this in taxes.</p>
<p>The provincial pays the tax.</p>
<p>Then you come back around six months later and say, hey, you owe me this tax again.</p>
<p>And the family could say, hey, we already paid that tax six months ago.</p>
<p>And the tax farmer would just say, well, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>You pay me.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no oversight to any of this, no real effective oversight anyway.</p>
<p>And this creates the same kind of really anger and resentment at what the Roman administrators</p>
<p>were up to amongst the provincials out there in Spain or in Greece or later in Asia or</p>
<p>what is today Western Turkey that in and of itself led to a destabilization of their imperial</p>
<p>hold on things.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t all get straightened out really until Augustus comes along and starts</p>
<p>introducing more stable reforms.</p>
<p>Marc Thiessen So fleeced by the contractors, right?</p>
<p>David Levy Very much so.</p>
<p>Very much so.</p>
<p>Marc Thiessen So let me ask you, and there&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>of storytelling here because I think it&rsquo;s horrifying.</p>
<p>To me, the first time I ever read anything in ancient history that reminded me of like</p>
<p>George Orwell&rsquo;s 1984, and maybe this is just the way my brain connects things.</p>
<p>But when you read about, you know, the Marius and the Sulla eras when prescription lists</p>
<p>are going up and people will read about whether or not they&rsquo;re being sentenced to die, I mean,</p>
<p>that has such a Third Reich kind of Orwellian maybe feel to it.</p>
<p>Can you go into that a little bit and talk about how different that was for Rome to wake</p>
<p>up and go see if you were on the list to die?</p>
<p>David Levy So at the beginning of the book, right, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s conflicts between various political rivals, various political groups, various</p>
<p>families, and they start maneuvering around each other and they start breaking down these</p>
<p>like rules of most mayorum.</p>
<p>But kind of in the early days, it&rsquo;s all very ad hoc, it&rsquo;s all very spontaneous, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really more about like maneuvering in new ways that hadn&rsquo;t been done before.</p>
<p>You start plodding along through the book, yeah, you get to chapter eight, you get to</p>
<p>chapter nine, now we&rsquo;re talking about these groups having armed, like on retainer armed</p>
<p>gangs who are going to fight for you.</p>
<p>And by the very end of the book, it becomes necessary to not just defeat your rivals and</p>
<p>have them say like, okay, well, I lost that vote or I lost that consulship, I guess I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go home now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re operating in a civil war environment where it&rsquo;s no longer enough to just beat your</p>
<p>rivals, you have to kill, you have to kill them.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t kill them, then they&rsquo;re gonna come back and they&rsquo;re gonna kill you.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a little tight cycle of this where&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna do too much in the way of spoilers if you haven&rsquo;t read the book, but yeah, we</p>
<p>kinda all know it all ends badly for the Romans, so it&rsquo;s not too much of a spoiler to say it</p>
<p>ends badly for most of these people.</p>
<p>But Sulla goes off to the east to fight his war against Mithridates.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s had this very intense struggle with Marius and Marius&rsquo; allies.</p>
<p>And Marius and his allies wind up coming into Rome and recapturing Rome, having been booted</p>
<p>out a couple of weeks earlier, and they start killing the allies of Sulla.</p>
<p>This leads, when Sulla comes back a couple of years later, for Sulla to reciprocate,</p>
<p>to give as good as he gets, and start, yeah, literally putting up named lists.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of names, and if you kill one of these people and bring me their head, then</p>
<p>I will pay you, I will pay you money.</p>
<p>And what is kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>And it also, not just Orwellian, but also very Kafka-esque, where it all becomes very</p>
<p>arbitrary, where the whole original point of the prescription list was so that the people</p>
<p>who Sulla was not planning on killing could rest easy.</p>
<p>Like, oh, okay, well, my name&rsquo;s not on the list, so I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>But every day, a new list goes up with new names on it, and you start having names being</p>
<p>added to the list, not because they are enemies of Sulla, but because they happen to be enemies</p>
<p>of maybe one of Sulla&rsquo;s allies.</p>
<p>Or in the case of Crassus, and he is like, hey, you own a very rich estate down here</p>
<p>in Campania.</p>
<p>I think I would actually like to own that estate.</p>
<p>So I think I&rsquo;m gonna declare you an enemy of Sulla and have you killed.</p>
<p>So those prescriptions that sort of eat up the last few chapters of the book are all</p>
<p>very bloody, and they become&hellip;</p>
<p>It takes on an absurd level where it doesn&rsquo;t even matter anymore whether you&rsquo;re an enemy</p>
<p>of somebody.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a quote from some rich equestrian who gets killed, and he&rsquo;s like, ah, done for</p>
<p>because of my Alban farm.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, he gets killed and his farm gets confiscated.</p>
<p>So it moves very quickly from, I have to kill my enemies in order to triumph, to just like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just kill everybody and confiscate their stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a wanted, dead or alive kind of approach to getting the enemies, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Sort of like, bring us back the head and we&rsquo;ll pay.</p>
<p>I mean, a little bit different than sending out your own Gestapo.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so you actually started having&hellip;</p>
<p>You became a fairly lucrative profession for a couple months, and even then for a couple</p>
<p>years where you would go out and you would be like, hey, well, let&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Almost like bounty hunters, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go track this person down.</p>
<p>I was just gonna say that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll kill them and then we&rsquo;ll get their stuff.</p>
<p>And what is&hellip;</p>
<p>And I also do mention this in the book, is there does come a point where they start to</p>
<p>realize&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t realize the way that we do, that there are no photographs of anybody.</p>
<p>There are no pictures of anybody.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t live in a digital age where you have a&hellip;</p>
<p>Where Sulla can hold up a picture and then hold up the head and be like, oh yeah, you</p>
<p>got the right guy.</p>
<p>And you start having them just grab random dudes off the street, kill them, chop their</p>
<p>head off, take it in and say, oh, this is&hellip;</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re like kind of scanning the list.</p>
<p>Oh, this is this guy, it&rsquo;s Gaius.</p>
<p>Yeah, Papyrus.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>This is his head.</p>
<p>And then you would get your bounty.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little like this black scalp that I&rsquo;m giving you with black hair.</p>
<p>This is an Apache scalp.</p>
<p>I guarantee it.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Give me my 250 gold coins.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very twisted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all quite sadistic, to be honest.</p>
<p>Something that comes to my mind, and I honestly don&rsquo;t know the answer in the period we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about here, but discussing the attempts by what we would call today foreign powers</p>
<p>or foreign entities to influence the politics of a vibrant, let&rsquo;s call it, on the way to</p>
<p>corrupt republic, I just finished a show we did on Caesar&rsquo;s conquest of Gaul.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting how the more, shall we call them, civilized or more Romanesque</p>
<p>Gallic tribes were basically trying to influence the politics in Rome during the period you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about.</p>
<p>Are there outside forces from other states trying to push their agenda or point of view</p>
<p>or the direction they&rsquo;d like to see Rome move towards?</p>
<p>Were any of the outside entities in the geopolitical world of the Mediterranean at that time trying</p>
<p>to influence Roman politics?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>And this had been true for quite some time where, going back even before the beginning</p>
<p>of the book, after Rome defeats Hannibal in the Second Punic War, there was a good 50</p>
<p>or 60 year period where Rome was the most powerful state in the Mediterranean, but hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite decided they wanted to annex and rule the Mediterranean directly, where they almost</p>
<p>set themselves up as kind of an arbitrator of last resort for various city states and</p>
<p>kingdoms out there.</p>
<p>So you would have a couple of Greek cities who were in having some border dispute or</p>
<p>having some fishing rights dispute, and they would agree to take their case to Rome.</p>
<p>So Rome became a hub of international embassies and ambassadors and people constantly, envoys</p>
<p>coming and going from really as far away as Syria and Egypt.</p>
<p>And all of them are bringing with them gifts that could only be described as bribes, where</p>
<p>you are definitely going to try to get what you want from the Senate by making sure that</p>
<p>the right senators have received the right gifts.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that had really&hellip;</p>
<p>This was again something that had opened up and does get to a more corrupt version of</p>
<p>the Senate than had existed before.</p>
<p>In the context of my book, the great example of this in my book is Jugurtha&rsquo;s conduct in</p>
<p>Numidia, where he is one of the kings of Numidia after his, I guess, adopted father</p>
<p>dies along with his two brothers, but Jugurtha would prefer to be the sole king of Numidia.</p>
<p>And so he starts breaking treaties, he starts killing his brothers, and he wants the Senate</p>
<p>to just go along with what he&rsquo;s doing down there rather than sending in legions or trying</p>
<p>to stop him.</p>
<p>So he absolutely quite brazenly and quite nakedly is sending envoys to the Roman Senate</p>
<p>laden with gold and laden with gifts and trying to influence the Senate&rsquo;s conduct.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s quite successful at it.</p>
<p>For most of the first seven or eight years of Jugurtha&rsquo;s reign, he&rsquo;s definitely able</p>
<p>to have more or less paid friends in the Senate, direct the Senate away from the notion of</p>
<p>ever sending the legions in to confront Jugurtha.</p>
<p>And it gets quite bad where you do have these senators who are like, my God, this is so</p>
<p>brazen.</p>
<p>We might actually have to do something about this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making us all look bad.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sort of chastising their colleagues in the Senate who are accepting all of Jugurtha&rsquo;s</p>
<p>money.</p>
<p>And that point, the corruption of the Senate by Jugurtha&rsquo;s money, does become a flashpoint</p>
<p>in Roman politics where, again, if you go back to some of these populare energies that</p>
<p>had started fomenting, that they&rsquo;re saying, Jugurtha is brazenly flouting Roman authority</p>
<p>and Roman law.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re telling him to do things and he&rsquo;s ignoring us.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s killing Italians.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s killing Roman citizens.</p>
<p>And yet we continue to do nothing.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because Jugurtha has bribed his way into the Senate.</p>
<p>And so they actually open up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually able to open up a special tribunal that is going to start to investigate</p>
<p>and prosecute those in the Senate who were guilty of being corrupted by Jugurtha.</p>
<p>Which gets me to a question of tipping points and points of no return.</p>
<p>When people like to look for examples from the past to try to analyze our own times,</p>
<p>and you do quite a bit of that in the book, and I love it.</p>
<p>When you look at our situation now and the people who founded this country and who wrote</p>
<p>the documents that form our framework were keen students of the Roman Republic, obviously.</p>
<p>And so they were paying attention to the flaws in their system and how things went wrong</p>
<p>and tried to make changes in their own version, obviously, so that we wouldn&rsquo;t fall down the</p>
<p>same rat hole.</p>
<p>But when do you think it was irreversible?</p>
<p>In other words, when do you think the death spiral had been reached where you can&rsquo;t imagine</p>
<p>now where the points of no entry and the ability to compromise had just gone too far?</p>
<p>Is it when the violence first breaks out, or is it after that, or is it before that?</p>
<p>If you had to find a tipping point, when the iceberg struck the Titanic, maybe is a better</p>
<p>way to put it, where is it in your mind?</p>
<p>Well, so I&rsquo;ll answer that in a sec.</p>
<p>I will say that one of the reasons we know so much about everything I just said about</p>
<p>Jugurtha is because the Roman historian Solis elected to write about the Jugurthine War</p>
<p>and Jugurtha&rsquo;s corruption of the Senate and the battles that ensued.</p>
<p>And Solis was somebody who was writing&hellip;</p>
<p>He was a partisan of Julius Caesar&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s writing his books right around the 40s and 30s BC.</p>
<p>So he knows how it all turns out, and he&rsquo;s writing fairly contemporaneously with events.</p>
<p>And he wrote about the Jugurthine War specifically because he said that was the tipping point.</p>
<p>That was&hellip;</p>
<p>And he said that was the first moment that the corruption of the Senate was first challenged</p>
<p>and what led to what became these partisan battles that ultimately destroyed the Senate.</p>
<p>He actually identified the Jugurthine War as that tipping point, which is why he wrote</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>Now, could the Senate&hellip;</p>
<p>Could the Roman Republic have pulled out of it at that point?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>The point that I come to is it&rsquo;s really&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Solis&rsquo; conduct at the very&hellip;</p>
<p>What becomes the end of the book.</p>
<p>But Solis&rsquo; conduct during some of his final showdowns is really what sets the final permanent</p>
<p>blueprint for how you can achieve power by completely disregarding just anything but</p>
<p>brute force.</p>
<p>So Sulla is going to&hellip;</p>
<p>He loses a political confrontation.</p>
<p>Sulla loses&hellip;</p>
<p>He had command of this Eastern army.</p>
<p>Marius uses the power of the assembly to strip Sulla of his command and send Sulla away,</p>
<p>what Marius thinks he sent Sulla packing for good.</p>
<p>And Sulla really is faced with this choice of, do I accept this defeat?</p>
<p>Do I get stripped of my command?</p>
<p>Do I accept the humiliation that I have just endured at the hands of my rival, Marius?</p>
<p>Or do I go back to my five legions who are loyal to me personally, and do I point them</p>
<p>at Rome and march on Rome to evict Marius from Rome and reclaim what I think is rightfully</p>
<p>mine?</p>
<p>Once Sulla did that, and then ultimately he emerges victorious from everything, that is</p>
<p>the point that men like Julius Caesar and men like Pompey, who was an early partisan</p>
<p>of Sulla&rsquo;s, are going to be looking at later on down the road and saying, well, if nothing</p>
<p>else, I can do that.</p>
<p>This is&hellip;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have any, I don&rsquo;t think, exact quotes or proof in the historical record that Julius</p>
<p>Caesar was actively thinking about Sulla when he crossed the Rubicon.</p>
<p>But it had to have been on his mind, and the proof was in the pudding for Sulla&rsquo;s conduct.</p>
<p>If you get a large army, keep them loyal to you.</p>
<p>You can use them to prosecute your own domestic political enemies and emerge victorious and</p>
<p>become a dictator for life.</p>
<p>So I sort of put it there.</p>
<p>I think that Sulla&rsquo;s decisions in those moments in the early days of the civil wars is really</p>
<p>what made it so that the Republic&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like there was any coming back from that.</p>
<p>Marc Thiessen You had mentioned when Caius Gracchus was</p>
<p>looking at his broad range of reforms, you had talked about, I&rsquo;m going from memory here,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d said if they had been enacted, it would have foreseen a lot of the changes that</p>
<p>Augustus era Roman reforms had implemented, and obviously a long time ahead of time.</p>
<p>If something like that had gone forward, is that the example of a reform moment that had</p>
<p>come to pass, the inevitable death spiral that happened might have been avoided?</p>
<p>Marc Thiessen I think so.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because there would not have been quite the energy or the impetus to just crack</p>
<p>the state in half.</p>
<p>You get to a point where if your governing apparatus, whatever it happens to be, if enough</p>
<p>people start to feel like that governing apparatus is not working for them, it&rsquo;s not doing anything</p>
<p>for me personally, why do I owe it as an institution any kind of loyalty?</p>
<p>My loyalty ought to go to the thing or to the people, or in the Roman case, oftentimes</p>
<p>to the general, who&rsquo;s going to be guaranteeing me the kind of security that I want in life,</p>
<p>which is I want a plot of land, I want decent wages, I want some place to be able to settle</p>
<p>and retire when I&rsquo;m done here.</p>
<p>By the time you get to the later Republic, that is providable by warlords, which is&hellip;</p>
<p>You could absolutely describe Caesar as a warlord.</p>
<p>Once it starts to become those guys who are delivering on the promises that are being</p>
<p>made rather than the state itself, yeah, there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>What is it that they had to be loyal to the Senate and people of Rome abstractly for?</p>
<p>So when you get to these moments when you can make some of these, when you can have</p>
<p>a little bit of foresight and say to yourself, well, is this model working for the entire</p>
<p>citizen population or is it just working for a tiny elite?</p>
<p>Once you start ignoring the rest of the citizens and say, oh, it&rsquo;s working for a tiny elite,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s fine, they&rsquo;ll just accept it, you do create a breach of legitimacy and you do</p>
<p>alienate people to the point where they&rsquo;re no longer loyal to the system at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you get people just crashing it over and most people practically not even</p>
<p>caring.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The private military thing, which used to be illegal in Rome.</p>
<p>Why did the Romans&hellip;</p>
<p>Why did the citizenry or the Senate put up with the change that, I mean, if you wanted</p>
<p>to put the major thing that the founding fathers of the United States, of course, tried to</p>
<p>do was to make sure that the citizen leadership controlled the military so that we had that</p>
<p>separation.</p>
<p>But they kind of had that separation in Rome once upon a time.</p>
<p>What made, and we&rsquo;ll make this the last question, but what made the circumstances or public</p>
<p>opinion or senatorial opinion, I was going to say change, but the word might be put up.</p>
<p>Why did they put up with it?</p>
<p>The raising of private armies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The reason why they put up with it initially was because Rome was facing an emergency military</p>
<p>situation where they were sort of simultaneously around the age of&hellip;</p>
<p>Around Marius, right?</p>
<p>Because Marius is sort of the great&hellip;</p>
<p>It had been moving in this direction of&hellip;</p>
<p>Just to back up in case people don&rsquo;t know this, previously to serve in the legions,</p>
<p>you had to own a certain amount of property.</p>
<p>You actually had to literally be rich enough to serve in the legions.</p>
<p>And by the middle of the book, in the middle of the storm before the storm, you get Marius</p>
<p>making this fateful request for an exemption from that requirement and just, let me enroll</p>
<p>any warm body who wants to show up and I&rsquo;ll train them and I&rsquo;ll teach them how to be soldiers.</p>
<p>That was a fairly momentous change in how the Romans conducted politics and war, and</p>
<p>does have a lot to do with those people who are now going to be loyal more to their general</p>
<p>than to the state, because it&rsquo;s the general who&rsquo;s going to be providing them and guaranteeing</p>
<p>them the riches and land that they hope to get out of their service.</p>
<p>So the reason why, I think in that moment, why the Senate says, okay, yeah, you can draft</p>
<p>anybody, is that they had an ongoing war in North Africa.</p>
<p>There was a huge slave rebellion that had consumed Sicily.</p>
<p>And then the Kimberley, this great Germanic horde that had just been sort of wandering</p>
<p>around Europe for like 15 years, would constantly come back around.</p>
<p>And so the Northern border was very insecure.</p>
<p>So I think it was a matter of just like, in this emergency situation, we need to raise</p>
<p>men and we need to raise a lot of men.</p>
<p>So yeah, just go ahead and do it.</p>
<p>And I think from that point on, they just sort of realized that this was a way to keep</p>
<p>up with the manpower needs that their empire now have.</p>
<p>They were no longer just this little city state that was occasionally skirmishing with</p>
<p>the Samnites down around Capua.</p>
<p>This is&hellip;</p>
<p>We have garrisons we need to be filling in Spain and North Africa and up in Gaul as they</p>
<p>move into Gaul.</p>
<p>The Macedonian frontier over in Greece, they&rsquo;re now in charge of Western Turkey.</p>
<p>How are we gonna keep the legions filled?</p>
<p>I think once they made the decision to go over to like, let&rsquo;s just drop this property</p>
<p>requirement in general, I think it was fairly wildly successful in terms of their ability</p>
<p>to raise the men needed to run their empire.</p>
<p>And then how does that move over to the real danger point, which is people raising personal</p>
<p>armies?</p>
<p>And I think a lot of this, like a decent enough analogy, like not exactly, is like a political</p>
<p>party going and looking for a candidate who can self-finance their campaign.</p>
<p>Political parties at the state level, at the national level, always love a candidate who</p>
<p>can walk in and say, oh, by the way, the party doesn&rsquo;t need to give me any money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just do this all out of my own pocket because I&rsquo;m a hedge fund manager or I am an</p>
<p>owner of a business.</p>
<p>Or like Michael Bloomberg is just like whatever it is that he&rsquo;s sitting on top of.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party didn&rsquo;t need to give him any money.</p>
<p>He could just do it all himself.</p>
<p>And the same was really true of later of people like Pompey who could say, hey, I can go raise</p>
<p>my own army.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to worry about it.</p>
<p>You elect me consul, I&rsquo;ll do all the work for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very immediately attractive proposition for most people, especially out there.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to go to war, but you have a candidate who&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>my guys myself and you don&rsquo;t have to do it if you don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you start getting these personal legions being raised.</p>
<p>And once those personal legions are being raised, again, now we&rsquo;re just, the late republic</p>
<p>is just a clash of warlords.</p>
<p>And that is really right now where you look at it and you say, okay, I see some similarities,</p>
<p>but there are some real big differences and we haven&rsquo;t gotten there yet, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Honestly, the military thing, the United States has gone through a bit of a similar process</p>
<p>after Vietnam where we said, we&rsquo;re no longer going to do this temporary conscription into</p>
<p>an army to go off and fight.</p>
<p>Instead, we&rsquo;re going to make it all volunteer and all professional, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a similarity, but there&rsquo;s so much about the institutional, what the US Army, the US</p>
<p>Navy institutionally is, does not resemble the personal warlord legions of the late republic.</p>
<p>The paymaster is not your colonel.</p>
<p>The paymaster is really, it&rsquo;s the United States of America and our checks don&rsquo;t ever bounce</p>
<p>when they go out there to some private or some sergeant or some major.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have them being loyal specifically to just one commander out there.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve also heard, I&rsquo;ve had the good fortune to be friends with lots of veterans,</p>
<p>guys who are in the military now or who have left and are now veterans just to back out</p>
<p>in the civilian world with the rest of us, that there&rsquo;s enough that goes on with troop</p>
<p>rotations where you&rsquo;re bouncing between units.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never forming one of these 20 year long bonds where you guys have all been serving</p>
<p>together forever.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t fear right now the role of the US Army in some kind of warlord style clash.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it happening anytime soon.</p>
<p>One of the great firewalls that&rsquo;s actually working still, right?</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>Listen, is there anything, Mike, that I didn&rsquo;t ask you about that you want to make sure we</p>
<p>know about the book or some of the story?</p>
<p>I specifically focused on the things that I was interested in, but there&rsquo;s a heck of</p>
<p>a lot in this piece.</p>
<p>What else should the listeners know?</p>
<p>Well, I think the one thing that we didn&rsquo;t touch on that is a pretty major part of the</p>
<p>book that has its similarities to the United States is this issue of the non-Roman Italians.</p>
<p>Well, sure, sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where, just in case you don&rsquo;t know the back story of this here, I&rsquo;ll do it real quick,</p>
<p>is that when Rome conquered Italy during the Samnite Wars, which is a couple of hundred</p>
<p>years before my book comes along, the Romans did not annex these people directly into the</p>
<p>Roman state.</p>
<p>They instead signed these treaties with a city.</p>
<p>So a city in Etruria or a city in Umbria would then become merely an ally of Rome.</p>
<p>Whenever the Romans came around to ask for legionaries for the armies, the city had to</p>
<p>provide them.</p>
<p>But other than that, they were mostly left to their own devices.</p>
<p>They could govern themselves.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t really taxed that heavily.</p>
<p>But what happens is when you get to the period of my book a couple of hundred years later,</p>
<p>these guys had been inside of Roman civilization in every meaningful way for hundreds of years,</p>
<p>and yet they were still&hellip;</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t even call them second-class citizens.</p>
<p>They were not citizens at all, and they&rsquo;re facing the same problems, the same economic</p>
<p>problems that their Roman cousins are, except they don&rsquo;t even have the right to vote in</p>
<p>an assembly.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even have the right to send candidates for office and be like, well, hey, what about</p>
<p>us?</p>
<p>And so they were, on top of everything else, they were facing economic problems and also</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have any kind of political voice at all.</p>
<p>And so that combines with the general problems that are created by the skyrocketing economic</p>
<p>inequality that leads to a Populare-style confrontational style of politics that now</p>
<p>defines the Republic, and that entire force of, again, like energy, I guess you could</p>
<p>call it.</p>
<p>The Italian question is what ultimately triggers the great civil wars of Marius and Sulla,</p>
<p>is the Italians constantly demanding citizenship, the Romans constantly saying, we&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>give you citizenship, and what it finally takes is a massive, bloody, and destructive</p>
<p>civil war where the Italians are not trying to break away from Roman rule, they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to force their way into Roman rule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a war on behalf of political equality rather than a war premised on political</p>
<p>independence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the other big thing that&rsquo;s floating around out there.</p>
<p>But other than that, you just read the book, and I&rsquo;ll explain it all to you.</p>
<p>As one of my professors said, every educated person in the Western world should know the</p>
<p>story that Mike Duncan catalogs in The Storm Before the Storm, The Beginning of the End</p>
<p>of the Roman Republic.</p>
<p>Mike, thank you for coming on the program.</p>
<p>I wish you the greatest success.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Like I said, I think you could not have chosen a better subject, and I agree with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shocking that this doesn&rsquo;t already have 20 books on the bookshelf about this, considering</p>
<p>how awesome&hellip;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to initiate enough disclaimers where you tell people, okay, there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>different things, it&rsquo;s not really like us, but look at all these things that are like</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I figure if you&rsquo;re gonna do it&hellip;</p>
<p>Because one of the things that I always push against is that I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re anywhere</p>
<p>near the fall of Rome, which is something that you hear from people like, oh, the Syrian</p>
<p>refugees are just like the Vandals.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Wait till we start killing each other over political things, then we&rsquo;re starting to move</p>
<p>a little bit in that direction.</p>
<p>Well, or I mean, yeah, if we actually have a mass migrating population that has an entire</p>
<p>armed force that can go toe-to-toe with the US Army, then I guess, yeah, we can start</p>
<p>talking about it, but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re anywhere near that.</p>
<p>And I also don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re anywhere near&hellip;</p>
<p>I think your 300 dead senators with Tiberius Gracchus, I think that&rsquo;s the moment where</p>
<p>the sea change would happen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that that period of the Gracchus is enough that I&rsquo;m happy to now insert this</p>
<p>idea into people&rsquo;s heads and say, like, this is the period we need to be paying attention</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just for interesting&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what my professor was pointing out, that if you&rsquo;re an American in this system,</p>
<p>this is a story that our founding fathers thought was worth knowing, probably for an</p>
<p>informed citizenry of a modern commercial imperial republic might be a good idea to</p>
<p>buy Mike Duncan&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m gonna phrase it.</p>
<p>Dude, if I can do anything for you, I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>That was fun.</p>
<p>My thanks to Mike Duncan.</p>
<p>It was great to finally digitally interact with him.</p>
