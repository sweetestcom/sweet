Reilly&rsquo;s heart monitor</p><p>and so back in the 30s eye doctor really</p><p>basically developed a way to take let me</p><p>just kind of start from the beginning</p><p>here because I I don&rsquo;t want you to see</p><p>these there we go let me just start</p><p>right here cool so I want you to see</p><p>this one slide right here this is a</p><p>microphone perfect okay</p><p>all right cool so dr. Rowley he was a</p><p>famous nutritionist back in the 30s and</p><p>40s and 50s</p><p>this guy developed a heart machine back</p><p>there and it was a huge machine it was</p><p>he had like 10,000 or 20,000 thousand of</p><p>them out in the community and two</p><p>doctors and they were assessing people</p><p>using the heart machine heart waves to</p><p>measure nutritional deficiencies so they</p><p>were able to develop a lot of research</p><p>in the area of cardiovascular health and</p><p>nutrition so here they were out there</p><p>you know evaluating people telling them</p><p>what to take for this and that because</p><p>the heart is the fastest responding</p><p>Oregon to nutrition of anything so he</p><p>has all this research so then in 1963</p><p>the FDA came in and pretty much took</p><p>away his right to you know promote</p><p>nutrition especially for medical</p><p>diseases so he was even under probation</p><p>and the confiscated all of his research</p><p>and they burned it and the whole thing</p><p>anyway um there was a guy another guy</p><p>who saved his research and he and he has</p><p>it available now and they have a very</p><p>private personal library with all this</p><p>data that I went to Palmyra Wisconsin to</p><p>see all of his research in to copy it</p><p>make copies of it so I had this crazy</p><p>idea about 10 years ago of of digitizing</p><p>this heart machine and I thought oh this</p><p>is a this is a great idea I&rsquo;ll be able</p><p>to digitize it and I can check people</p><p>and oh my gosh this is amazing</p><p>because the technology now is so much</p><p>better</p><p>blah blah blah so I&rsquo;ve hired acoustic</p><p>engineers electrical engineers</p><p>programmers from Russia all over the</p><p>place and when we took the microphone a</p><p>part of this 1935 machine that measures</p><p>your heart waves it&rsquo;s called a phone a</p><p>cardiogram</p><p>we found that it wasn&rsquo;t a regular</p><p>microphone he was using a different</p><p>technology back then which just kind of</p><p>shocked us and that was he was using</p><p>something called earthquake sensing</p><p>devices is called the accelerometer</p><p>which measures very tiny vibrations so</p><p>he had an earthquake sensor in his</p><p>microphone so then I had to go to a</p><p>company that sells earthquake sensing</p><p>devices ooh so it&rsquo;s called an</p><p>accelerometer and I had to basically um</p><p>by this little earthquake sensor and</p><p>build it into a plastic microphone so</p><p>when when this microphone attached to</p><p>your heart the whole heart goes into</p><p>sympathetic vibration with the</p><p>microphone so you don&rsquo;t have that</p><p>diaphragm anymore you have the just pure</p><p>duplication of the heart wave so I built</p><p>that and very expensive this is the</p><p>earthquake sensing device right here we</p><p>have electrical engineers working on</p><p>this thing for several years and we had</p><p>this really really cool thing and then I</p><p>had to have the software for it and so</p><p>we built the software to be able to</p><p>analyze it and so that&rsquo;s that was a that</p><p>went on for months and months and months</p><p>and months or months and so right when</p><p>we went into the area of FDA approval</p><p>process that&rsquo;s where it stopped because</p><p>the amount of money would cost me with</p><p>just bankrupting so I basically have all</p><p>this stuff in a box in my basement right</p><p>now sitting there so I dropped the</p><p>project it was just too expensive um but</p><p>anyway I learned a lot from doing this</p><p>and I want to share with you a lot of</p><p>the things that I&rsquo;ve learned um that I</p><p>think you&rsquo;re going to like okay so we&rsquo;re</p><p>going to talk about the cardiovascular</p><p>system the cardiovascular system</p><p>um runs on nutrition just about every</p><p>single nutrient but I&rsquo;m going to talk</p><p>about the big ones so um I want to make</p><p>sure you can see me right now since</p><p>someone says I can&rsquo;t see anything</p><p>anymore</p><p>someone says I lost the audio so just</p><p>please tell me can you hear me before I</p><p>get started because last thing I wanna</p><p>do is get halfway into it find out um oh</p><p>yeah you can&rsquo;t even hear me can you hear</p><p>me now yes I will make copies of this</p><p>arm there&rsquo;s always a delay so I have to</p><p>wait okay cool all right everything&rsquo;s</p><p>fine alright so I have to show you this</p><p>right here um okay so let me just go and</p><p>open this up right here</p><p>share it everyone boom okay we&rsquo;re good</p><p>alright so anyway it was a good</p><p>experience</p><p>expensive experience alright so the</p><p>first thing I want to talk about is</p><p>electrolytes what is an electrolyte is</p><p>it Gatorade well there&rsquo;s only two</p><p>minerals and Gatorade electrolytes are</p><p>electrically charged minerals other</p><p>minerals that when you dissolve them in</p><p>a fluid they can conduct electricity</p><p>they allow muscles to contract they</p><p>allow nerves to send impulses they allow</p><p>fluid to travel through the body so</p><p>that&rsquo;s what electrolytes are like sodium</p><p>potassium calcium magnesium we&rsquo;re going</p><p>to talk about pretty much for minerals</p><p>or electrolytes okay we&rsquo;re not gonna</p><p>talk about all of them but basically</p><p>electrolytes are those things that the</p><p>heart needs to contract the nerve that</p><p>goes to the heart to sends signals to</p><p>form a pacemaker and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re</p><p>used for and what they do is they&rsquo;re</p><p>they allow things to move back and forth</p><p>in and out of the cell okay so for</p><p>example most of the sodium is outside</p><p>the cell most of the potassium is in</p><p>sad to sell so you have this this</p><p>difference it allows a called a gradient</p><p>of electrical charge that flow from one</p><p>side to another so we actually can get</p><p>things moving all right so that&rsquo;s what</p><p>electrolyte is so and this is what</p><p>Gatorade sells because look at how much</p><p>sugar 35 grams of sugar that has to be</p><p>milligrams that can&rsquo;t be grams that&rsquo;s</p><p>crazy</p><p>they do give you two lecture lights</p><p>potassium and sodium so you get</p><p>potassium I got 65 milligrams that&rsquo;s</p><p>really not the best way to get your</p><p>electrolytes it&rsquo;s just pure sugar okay</p><p>so check this out</p><p>we have this heart we have the muscle of</p><p>the heart we have the nerves going to</p><p>the heart we have the blood vessels</p><p>going to the heart and that&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re</p><p>going to talk about all three different</p><p>areas in relationship to what can go</p><p>wrong and what you can do to prevent and</p><p>correct these problems but you can see</p><p>right here when these little minerals go</p><p>or electrolytes go into the cell things</p><p>can move and other minerals go outside</p><p>the cell so that&rsquo;s what actually allows</p><p>the nerve to conduct and then look at a</p><p>muscle to contract a muscle you need</p><p>calcium calcium is the main electrolyte</p><p>that can tracks the muscle okay if you</p><p>ever see your blood pressure the top</p><p>number it&rsquo;s called systolic that&rsquo;s due</p><p>to calcium that&rsquo;s a contraction the</p><p>bottom number is due to more relaxation</p><p>and that&rsquo;s controlled by magnesium so</p><p>you have two different electrolytes so</p><p>contraction all these electrolytes go in</p><p>and out of the cell and then something</p><p>contracts so here&rsquo;s a heart wave you can</p><p>see the contraction and relaxation</p><p>calcium controls the contraction of the</p><p>muscle all right so a lot can go wrong</p><p>with that if you have too much calcium</p><p>or not enough calcium you there&rsquo;s no</p><p>contraction or there&rsquo;s too many</p><p>contractions</p><p>they call that fibrillation or tetany</p><p>atrial fibrillation and what I want to</p><p>tell you and this is interesting</p><p>everyone&rsquo;s concerned about cholesterol</p><p>for the last 50 years the really funny</p><p>now that coronary calcium is the single</p><p>best predictor of heart attacks so you</p><p>can actually even get a coronary calcium</p><p>scoring test it&rsquo;s a cat scan and just</p><p>measures the calcium inside the heart um</p><p>we&rsquo;ll get into why it&rsquo;s there but just</p><p>realize right now cholesterol is not a</p><p>really good indicator of heart disease</p><p>like they say I will tell you a little</p><p>bit more about that but um there so</p><p>there&rsquo;s actually quite a few studies</p><p>that show that men and women then have</p><p>lower cholesterol have more problems</p><p>with their cardiovascular system so but</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to create more confusion</p><p>it&rsquo;s not really important what&rsquo;s</p><p>important right now is usually</p><p>understand cows too much calcium is</p><p>really bad for the heart okay especially</p><p>for heart attacks why because calcium</p><p>causes the arteries to become stiff</p><p>inelastic so you no longer have the</p><p>elasticity and so everything is very</p><p>rigid and then the pressure is going to</p><p>go higher and higher and higher and then</p><p>it can blow out an artery and that&rsquo;s</p><p>what we call a stroke okay so if you</p><p>look right here not only does your</p><p>arteries calcify but if you have there&rsquo;s</p><p>a huge a correlation between</p><p>calcification of your arteries which is</p><p>soft as your calcium and osteoporosis</p><p>interesting so what&rsquo;s happening with a</p><p>lot of people is calcium is just in the</p><p>wrong place at the wrong time instead of</p><p>going in the bones it goes in the soft</p><p>tissues of the body so we get kidney</p><p>stones golf stones clacking of the</p><p>arteries tartar on the teeth bone pain</p><p>insomnia muscle cramps arrhythmia high</p><p>blood pressure</p><p>asthma because of the spasm in the</p><p>bronchial tubes increase urination</p><p>constipation these are all symptoms of</p><p>too much calcium now what the heck is</p><p>the cow the calcium doing in your</p><p>arteries right well primarily one of the</p><p>reasons it goes in there is that it&rsquo;s</p><p>acting as a band-aid to actually help</p><p>and patch up so they call lesions or</p><p>shall we say micro hemorrhaging or</p><p>bleeding tiny little tears in the</p><p>arteries and so calcium and cholesterol</p><p>go in there to patch it up to protect</p><p>you to help you so that&rsquo;s really why</p><p>it&rsquo;s there because you don&rsquo;t see a</p><p>calcium accumulating or cholesterol</p><p>randomly you don&rsquo;t see these</p><p>accumulating in your veins they&rsquo;re very</p><p>specific in areas of high pressure like</p><p>the aorta or</p><p>stick the coronary which is around the</p><p>heart so what&rsquo;s happening is you get</p><p>this little lesion or this little tear</p><p>which really comes from a vitamin C</p><p>deficiency because if you look at a</p><p>vitamin C deficiency should give</p><p>bleeding gums will you&rsquo;ll get bleeding</p><p>spider veins varicose veins and that</p><p>bleeding is going on all over the body</p><p>okay so the cholesterol comes in to try</p><p>to plug it up the calcium comes and try</p><p>to patch it up and that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s</p><p>behind clogged arteries so it&rsquo;s a</p><p>vitamin C deficiency calcium is laid on</p><p>the chain so it&rsquo;s cholesterol now</p><p>doctors like to use a calcium channel</p><p>blockers as the heart medication and</p><p>this is interesting why would they use</p><p>calcium channel blockers because there&rsquo;s</p><p>too much calcium in the heart so it says</p><p>right here um</p><p>calcium channel blockers several</p><p>medications disrupt a movement of</p><p>calcium through the calcium channels to</p><p>use for hypertension decrease blood</p><p>pressure and again stiffness and the</p><p>arteries and common causes of elevated</p><p>systolic that&rsquo;s the top number um</p><p>so these have been used slightly more</p><p>effective than beta blockers which has</p><p>to do with blocking another thing which</p><p>is connected to the adrenal gland which</p><p>we&rsquo;ll get into but they&rsquo;re associated</p><p>with more side-effects</p><p>okay why because you&rsquo;re just treating</p><p>the symptom you&rsquo;re not getting rid of</p><p>the cause so it&rsquo;s just interesting that</p><p>they&rsquo;re trying to use a drug to get rid</p><p>of something that really is a</p><p>nutritional problem so as you develop</p><p>plaque the first thing that happens is a</p><p>micro hemorrhage an immune system</p><p>reaction and then signals calcium and</p><p>cholesterol to start blacking that&rsquo;s</p><p>really the stage of a cycle of clogged</p><p>artery um there&rsquo;s a really high it&rsquo;s a</p><p>you know you go to amazon.com and you</p><p>see these these books on these great um</p><p>technical books on the body but they&rsquo;re</p><p>like two hundred and fifty dollars or</p><p>like three hundred fifty bucks so I did</p><p>a search and I made a little copy of</p><p>kind of the anatomy of a plaque and this</p><p>whole book is but one just one inch</p><p>thick and it talks about what&rsquo;s really</p><p>the mechanism behind clogged arteries</p><p>and it&rsquo;s right here you can see local</p><p>micro hemorrhage which basically in the</p><p>healing process you have fibrosis that</p><p>scar tissue and calcium and cholesterol</p><p>that&rsquo;s really the first chain of</p><p>reaction so it&rsquo;s a vitamin C deficiency</p><p>but you might say well I take vitamin C</p><p>right</p><p>most people are taking the wrong kind of</p><p>vitamin C they&rsquo;re taking something</p><p>called ascorbic acid ascorbic acid is</p><p>only the the eggshell to the egg the</p><p>orange pill the antioxidant portion the</p><p>Scorpio acid is really not even vitamin</p><p>C it&rsquo;s one tiny portion it&rsquo;s really</p><p>there to protect the inside of a</p><p>tendancy complex Nach in nature vitamin</p><p>c always comes in complexes and that&rsquo;s</p><p>you&rsquo;re seeing on the left side right</p><p>here and that&rsquo;s really what you need is</p><p>a whole complex so I always recommend</p><p>getting your vitamin C from a food</p><p>complex do not get it synthetically they</p><p>make it from ascorbic acid and a</p><p>sulfuric acid and cornstarch which has</p><p>no vitamin C the problem the reason I&rsquo;m</p><p>talking about this a little bit longer</p><p>is because when you take high amounts of</p><p>ascorbic acid you actually will start</p><p>creating this micro hemorrhage so one of</p><p>the causes of bleeding arteries and gums</p><p>is taking too much of the wrong thing</p><p>ascorbic acid okay people take grams of</p><p>this stuff now how do you know do you</p><p>have to get a calcium test well not</p><p>necessarily you can look at your other</p><p>symptoms do you tend to get kidney</p><p>stones bone pain abdominal pain increase</p><p>urination depression these are all just</p><p>signs of high soft tissue calcium ulcers</p><p>isn&rsquo;t it interesting that too much</p><p>calcium causes ulcers look what they</p><p>give people Oscars they give them an e</p><p>acids they give them calcium carbonate</p><p>which actually causes an ulcer Wow</p><p>that&rsquo;s interesting so if you have a lot</p><p>of stiffness if you have arthritis high</p><p>blood pressure then you pretty much can</p><p>suspect you could have some high high</p><p>amounts of calcium in the body that</p><p>shouldn&rsquo;t be there all right and then</p><p>also if you have low stomach acid like</p><p>in heartburn because heartburn really is</p><p>a low stomach situation you will not be</p><p>able to absorb calcium calcium needs to</p><p>be absorbed in an acid medium it&rsquo;s kind</p><p>of like your little faucet outside where</p><p>you have all the calcium buildup and it</p><p>then causes a problem with these little</p><p>specks of calcium now as we&rsquo;re going</p><p>through this I want to make sure that</p><p>you guys don&rsquo;t have any questions so I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to see if you have any questions</p><p>and then if you could do me a big favor</p><p>if you can tell me um what kind of heart</p><p>problems that you have do you have</p><p>atrial fibrillation do you have high</p><p>blood pressure do you have enlarged</p><p>heart just go ahead</p><p>let me now okay so Veronica says if we</p><p>take vitamin C should we take vitamin d3</p><p>k2 along with it I&rsquo;m going to get there</p><p>hang in there oh by the way at the end</p><p>of this webinar I want to give you guys</p><p>the notes the summarization of all the</p><p>nutrition and what it does you guys want</p><p>that so stick stick with me through the</p><p>whole thing and I&rsquo;ll give you the</p><p>download at the end of seminar okay so</p><p>you have everything that I&rsquo;m talking</p><p>about you&rsquo;ll have it downloaded it&rsquo;s</p><p>right here this whole thing someone</p><p>summarized</p><p>okay alright so I just wanted to make</p><p>sure that you guys are with me here</p><p>you&rsquo;re not checked out okay</p><p>a lot of blood blood pressure Wow okay</p><p>atrial fib well you&rsquo;re going to be glad</p><p>that you&rsquo;re listening to this because</p><p>there&rsquo;s things that you can do okay</p><p>great I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that but alright</p><p>so let me just open this little guy here</p><p>okay cool let me just go back here okay</p><p>what are the risks of high tissue soft</p><p>tissue calcium ten times the risk of</p><p>atrial fib five times the risk of stroke</p><p>three times heart attack five five times</p><p>blood pressure twenty five times at risk</p><p>for kidney stones and four times for</p><p>GERD so you know it&rsquo;s so interesting</p><p>that the doctor tells us to take calcium</p><p>in the central silver you never ever</p><p>ever ever ever want to take something</p><p>called calcium carbonate that&rsquo;s the</p><p>worst thing you can do and people are</p><p>taking like like 2,000 milligrams of</p><p>that stuff especially women after</p><p>menopause sin it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just taking</p><p>a rock it&rsquo;s not going to absorb it&rsquo;s</p><p>just going to clog up your arteries and</p><p>that&rsquo;s not the way to build your bones</p><p>either okay so now I want to talk about</p><p>vitamin k2 what is vitamin k2 vitamin k2</p><p>is going to be the next probably next</p><p>superfood because this vitamin is a</p><p>recently discovered by them and it</p><p>transports calcium to your bones and</p><p>your teeth and it helps make your</p><p>arteries and joints more elastic in</p><p>other words it transports soft tissue</p><p>calcium out of the wrong places out of</p><p>the arteries</p><p>there&rsquo;s even cardiologists that are</p><p>recommending this to clean out your</p><p>arteries this is great for low blood</p><p>pressure lowering blood pressure so if</p><p>you&rsquo;re pregnant you need to be taking</p><p>k2y because the baby will come out with</p><p>really good teeth that they won&rsquo;t need</p><p>braces they won&rsquo;t have deformed dental</p><p>structures they won&rsquo;t have an underbite</p><p>or an overbite if you&rsquo;re deficient in k2</p><p>you get a dowager&rsquo;s hump that&rsquo;s that</p><p>hump on your back you shrink in age so</p><p>k2 makes your bones really sell it this</p><p>is the key vitamin that activates a bone</p><p>grub formation and making your bones</p><p>really solid I was taking this when I</p><p>broke my shoulder and my left elbow in</p><p>the last five years um okay so vitamin D</p><p>what that does is it helps absorb</p><p>calcium from the gut into the blood okay</p><p>so if it basically increases the calcium</p><p>absorption by 20 times from your</p><p>intestines but vitamin D does not does</p><p>not necessarily push the calcium all the</p><p>way in the bone it works with k2 but k2</p><p>needs vitamin d3 to activate to be</p><p>activated so they both work together in</p><p>nature you will always see them together</p><p>okay and this is why people say well why</p><p>do I have to take d3 with k2 what can I</p><p>just take k2 well it&rsquo;s just not going to</p><p>work is effectively now vitamin k1 that</p><p>has to do with regulating calcium to</p><p>help you clot to heal and you</p><p>ek1 but k1 has about 8 different</p><p>proteins and some of them are</p><p>anti-clotting in other words our</p><p>clotting depending what you need so when</p><p>people are on warfarin which is like rat</p><p>poison which is for thinning of the</p><p>blood boy that can really throw off</p><p>their ability to heal but you do need k1</p><p>with k2 I always recommend taking</p><p>vitamin K in a complex take 1 & 2</p><p>together with all the factors that way</p><p>you&rsquo;re not missing anything because they</p><p>both work together ok k2 is essential</p><p>for preventing something like this and</p><p>under bite overbite humpback cavities</p><p>tartar and teeth I tell you I wish I</p><p>would have known about this with my kids</p><p>that would have been really really cool</p><p>even myself I wish I would have known</p><p>about this but ok so art Harding of the</p><p>arteries sufficient k2 you don&rsquo;t get</p><p>calcium deposits in the arteries okay</p><p>lacking k2 your honour&rsquo;s become stiff</p><p>blood pressure starts kicking in some of</p><p>you are already on k2 and some of you</p><p>have seen the some of the videos I&rsquo;ve</p><p>done in case studies where I&rsquo;ve had</p><p>patients take k2 and with a matter of 30</p><p>30 to 90 days you can see a nice</p><p>reduction of blood pressure and chest</p><p>pain angina so when you have a too much</p><p>calcium and too little K 2 you get blood</p><p>pressure arrhythmias which are basically</p><p>your hearts out of rhythm because the</p><p>electrical see that calcium is also</p><p>accumulating on the nerves as well and</p><p>you ever see people that twitch on the</p><p>left eye or they have like little facial</p><p>twitches that&rsquo;s because the calcium is</p><p>building up on that nerve heart attack</p><p>strokes</p><p>osteoporosis and osteopenia where do you</p><p>get k2 grass-fed organic animal products</p><p>pasture-raised pasture-raised not</p><p>pasteurized</p><p>pasture-raised like chickens that</p><p>actually go in the pasture and eat the</p><p>grass I always buy organic</p><p>pasture-raised eggs not pasteurized eggs</p><p>butter Kerrygold butter that&rsquo;s grass-fed</p><p>grass-fed kefir um when I was a kid I</p><p>craved butter like it was crazy I would</p><p>I would eat a pound of butter in one</p><p>sitting little did I know I was trying</p><p>to get this darn k2 and I had every</p><p>single cup tooth filled with cavities</p><p>because I so much sugar I probably would</p><p>have been protected if I had that much</p><p>k2 but I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time I</p><p>was raised in Wisconsin where they had</p><p>cows and we had really good butter and</p><p>everything was cool but interesting why</p><p>I craved that butter that means your</p><p>vitamin two deficient you can also if</p><p>you&rsquo;re a vegetarian you can get in from</p><p>nted foods such as NATO as well goose</p><p>liver and it&rsquo;s actually another liver as</p><p>well certain cheeses such as brie and</p><p>gouda now isn&rsquo;t it interesting what are</p><p>the doctors telling you to do for the</p><p>last 50 years avoid fat of go lean you</p><p>know don&rsquo;t consume fatty foods stay away</p><p>from fat well guess what that did that</p><p>get causes cause so many problems of the</p><p>heart calcification of the heart that&rsquo;s</p><p>that&rsquo;s vitamin d3 in k2r fat soluble</p><p>vitamins you get them from the fat now</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about cholesterol for</p><p>a second I know some of you are still</p><p>kind of stuck on the cholesterol is bad</p><p>for you it&rsquo;s going to clog my arteries</p><p>but let me just explain something your</p><p>body makes 2,000 milligrams of</p><p>cholesterol every single day yeah mm</p><p>it&rsquo;s there to make vitamin D it&rsquo;s there</p><p>to make bile bi le to help you absorb</p><p>nutrients it&rsquo;s there to make stress</p><p>hormones it&rsquo;s there to heal the body the</p><p>lens of the eye is fed cholesterol it&rsquo;s</p><p>to make serotonin every single cell in</p><p>your body almost every cell makes</p><p>cholesterol interesting so if your body</p><p>makes it why is it so bad it&rsquo;s the wrong</p><p>target it&rsquo;s been the wrong target this</p><p>whole time so I&rsquo;m going to show you</p><p>something that&rsquo;s quite interesting and I</p><p>think I&rsquo;ll be able to show you this</p><p>right here okay so I have my writing</p><p>board right here and the Framingham</p><p>study I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m going to be</p><p>able to do this because everything might</p><p>be backwards but let&rsquo;s give it a try I</p><p>think it is backwards so if you have</p><p>high cholesterol let&rsquo;s say 350 and you</p><p>have low say it&rsquo;s 120 what they did is</p><p>they found one out of a hundred no I&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry one of them a thousand people will</p><p>die of a heart attacks with low</p><p>cholesterol and they found two out of a</p><p>thousand will die out of the some from</p><p>high cholesterol so if we go one two two</p><p>that&rsquo;s an increase of a hundred percent</p><p>right and that&rsquo;s how they calculate it</p><p>you have a hundred percent at risk for</p><p>getting a heart attack</p><p>it sounds pretty scary but what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p><p>wrong with this picture</p><p>these are fractions they&rsquo;re not whole</p><p>numbers if we divide these correctly</p><p>it&rsquo;s really a 0.1% increase 1/10 of 1%</p><p>increase if I told you you have a one</p><p>point one ten to one percent chance of</p><p>getting heart attacks would you take the</p><p>statins will you take the drugs probably</p><p>not so they have to use a term that it</p><p>has no legal definition called risk</p><p>they&rsquo;ll never say rate they&rsquo;ll say risk</p><p>and by the way I&rsquo;m going to get into</p><p>statins in a little bit um lipitor this</p><p>is amazing lipitor</p><p>you know what that you know which they</p><p>make they made over a hundred billion</p><p>dollars and the only study that showed</p><p>that it had some positive</p><p>cholesterol-lowering ability show toes</p><p>only for men they&rsquo;re high-risk and it</p><p>said three out of a hundred people who</p><p>take lipitor will have a heart no I&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry</p><p>three out of 100 that don&rsquo;t take lipitor</p><p>have heart attacks two out of a hundred</p><p>that take lipitor won&rsquo;t have a heart</p><p>attack</p><p>so they said it&rsquo;s a 33% reduction so</p><p>that&rsquo;s one out of a hundred less for</p><p>every hundred people only one people one</p><p>person less will actually not have a</p><p>heart attack but this is not death rate</p><p>just heart attack we don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t</p><p>die but they did find out by taking</p><p>lipitor your overall death rate does go</p><p>up this side effect is there&rsquo;s class</p><p>action I think this class action suits</p><p>right now</p><p>side effects liver damage diabetes</p><p>memory loss I mean it&rsquo;s like</p><p>unbelievable unbelievable um so this</p><p>whole rush of lowering cholesterol</p><p>cholesterol used to be 125</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry 225 now they&rsquo;ve brought it</p><p>down the to 200 and they put everyone on</p><p>at high risk okay good so um a lot of</p><p>you are already trying to k2 awesome</p><p>okay good lot of questions but I have to</p><p>finish this someone asked about vitamin</p><p>F yep um I have just so much information</p><p>I just have to type it but I want to</p><p>know is this backwards can you this is</p><p>everything backwards can you read it I</p><p>mean I&rsquo;m looking at it from a different</p><p>viewpoint but okay let me go back into</p><p>this check this out let me just go right</p><p>here</p><p>yeah lipitor unbelievable Inc</p><p>significantly increasing diabetes I</p><p>cannot believe it&rsquo;s still on the market</p><p>bad effects fatten users have a 21</p><p>percent increased risk of death compared</p><p>to placebo oh my gosh</p><p>and also look at this statins 400 over</p><p>400% increased risk of serious adverse</p><p>cardiovascular events cancer muscle pain</p><p>elevated see what I noticed when people</p><p>take lipitor or statins they get a lot</p><p>of pain joint pain that&rsquo;s the side</p><p>effect okay so let&rsquo;s say your</p><p>cholesterol is really really high what</p><p>can you take I recommend niacin niacin</p><p>is probably one of the most effective</p><p>things of lowering cholesterol but the</p><p>other thing you have to do is that get</p><p>the sugar out of the diet it&rsquo;s the sugar</p><p>that makes the cholesterol more than</p><p>eating cholesterol makes your high</p><p>cholesterol I consume lots of cheese</p><p>lots of egg yolks lots of fat and my</p><p>cholesterol is is under 600 now I&rsquo;m just</p><p>kidding</p><p>it&rsquo;s probably like 170 I mean I want it</p><p>to go up a little higher because that</p><p>cholesterol actually is there to help</p><p>make adrenal hormones and it&rsquo;s not as</p><p>long as you&rsquo;re under 225 you&rsquo;re good but</p><p>we want to look at the the ratios of</p><p>good and bad cholesterol which I&rsquo;ll get</p><p>into but the point is that you want to</p><p>get off the sugar or the hidden sugars</p><p>if you&rsquo;re if you have high cholesterol</p><p>if you want to lower it niacin is a good</p><p>remedy it&rsquo;s a B vitamin b3 okay we</p><p>talked about vitamin D it helps you</p><p>absorb calcium in the gut by twenty</p><p>twenty times transports calcium from the</p><p>gut to your blood it helps activate k2</p><p>and it helps lower blood pressure okay</p><p>that&rsquo;s cool but why are people deficient</p><p>in vitamin D it&rsquo;s mainly because of high</p><p>levels of cortisol cortisol from stress</p><p>blocks the absorption vitamin D yes it</p><p>could be lack of sun another cause could</p><p>be lack of a good gall bladder that</p><p>produces the bile let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have a gall bladder chances are you</p><p>don&rsquo;t have the file to absorb button or</p><p>D or the other fat type of item and so</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to take</p><p>some bile supplement the bile is</p><p>necessary to help you absorb all the fat</p><p>cyber vitamins vitamin D k2 vitamin E</p><p>and vitamin A ok so now the other thing</p><p>is high blood pressure depression bone</p><p>pain loss of bone low immune system so</p><p>cod liver oil color oil is a really good</p><p>way to get a nice balance of vitamin A</p><p>vitamin D but it&rsquo;s what I would</p><p>recommend get that virgin cod liver oil</p><p>because right now you don&rsquo;t really I</p><p>don&rsquo;t really trust lot of these</p><p>companies they could refine it the ad</p><p>vitam is in there</p><p>virgin cod liver oil is the absolute</p><p>best and by the way the blue-ice the</p><p>fermented cod liver oil there&rsquo;s no such</p><p>thing you can&rsquo;t prevent an oil it&rsquo;s just</p><p>going to go rancid that&rsquo;s why it tastes</p><p>so fishy yes I did recommend it in the</p><p>past but it&rsquo;s I was like wait a second</p><p>you can only ferment carbohydrate not</p><p>oils so I don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just I don&rsquo;t I</p><p>don&rsquo;t trust them ok so fatty fish eggs</p><p>have vitamin D dairy those are all real</p><p>good sources now vitamin D excess like</p><p>like ups let&rsquo;s say the doctor gives you</p><p>fifty thousand international units once</p><p>a week I think that&rsquo;s an excess but</p><p>especially if it&rsquo;s not taken every day</p><p>it&rsquo;s just like once a week but here&rsquo;s</p><p>the thing vitamin D excess really is a</p><p>k2 deficiency if you take k2 you won&rsquo;t</p><p>become vitamin D toxic okay so when they</p><p>talk about international units like for</p><p>example ten thousand international units</p><p>of vitamin D is really one milligram</p><p>it&rsquo;s not that much but even 50,000 IU&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s not that much but if you do like</p><p>one hundred or two hundred thousand and</p><p>I use out of indeed without the k2</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to get hypercalcemia that&rsquo;s</p><p>too much calcium and arteries just</p><p>because you&rsquo;re loading it up but you&rsquo;re</p><p>not taking the k2 to deliver it into the</p><p>cells</p><p>okay so anyway you not if you know</p><p>people friends or family taking d3 by</p><p>itself just tell them to take the cake -</p><p>it&rsquo;ll be they&rsquo;ll be good we talked about</p><p>the stages of micromanaging and the</p><p>vitamin C deficiency here&rsquo;s a good anti</p><p>soft tissue calcium protocol</p><p>I recommend 40,000 I use of d3 40,000 I</p><p>use and then 400 micrograms okay of Kate</p><p>Kate Kate - it should be that&rsquo;s a typo</p><p>and there&rsquo;s two versions of k2 one</p><p>version is at mk4 and the other version</p><p>is okay MK 7 MK 7 is natural MK 4 is</p><p>synthetic i I used and I recommend MK 7</p><p>the one that I sell has vitamin k1 and</p><p>k2 together and it&rsquo;s in its 100</p><p>micrograms per tablet or capsule but you</p><p>take these together you take them in the</p><p>morning with a little bit of Kerrygold</p><p>butter or with your eggs or with some</p><p>fat that&rsquo;s how you take it and you might</p><p>need to take it for several months to</p><p>see the changes depending on how much</p><p>calcium that you have</p><p>okay so we&rsquo;re switching gears here we&rsquo;re</p><p>going to talk about vitamin E um</p><p>vitamin E okay this is interesting</p><p>vitamin E in nature comes in a complex</p><p>we never as a individual fractionated to</p><p>confer all like most people get vitamin</p><p>E most people don&rsquo;t know that</p><p>synthetic high amounts actually create</p><p>more problems for people if they take a</p><p>long-term I mean I would recommend maybe</p><p>if you&rsquo;re doing a short detox for like a</p><p>month but long-term vitamin D has not</p><p>been shown good on your body but vitamin</p><p>E increases the oxygen carrying capacity</p><p>it prevents cramping of the heart it&rsquo;s</p><p>if you take a look on every single</p><p>mountaintop that people that climbers</p><p>have climbed these large mountaintops</p><p>you will see</p><p>two bottles of vitamin E complex because</p><p>it increases oxygen carrying capacity</p><p>for high altitudes so they don&rsquo;t get as</p><p>sick if they take the vitamin E so it</p><p>increases oxygen so if you don&rsquo;t have</p><p>money your heart will cramp it&rsquo;s also</p><p>good for acne sex organs menopausal</p><p>women especially after menopause a lot</p><p>of women need vitamin E because the</p><p>pituitary is strained because it now has</p><p>to do the adrenals have to kick it</p><p>harder and then the ovaries aren&rsquo;t</p><p>working so the pituitary becomes more</p><p>deficient by the mini because you&rsquo;re not</p><p>going to need as much vitamin E to run</p><p>those ovaries anymore so you see a lot</p><p>of dry skin you see heart problems</p><p>things like that okay so but WebMD says</p><p>that vitamin E harms more than it helps</p><p>you know the same website that promotes</p><p>drugs right there pretty much run by</p><p>drug companies here&rsquo;s the data on that</p><p>the studies that show show that vitamin</p><p>E harms you they&rsquo;ve used high potency</p><p>synthetic tocopheryl alpha tocopheryl</p><p>which is one little tiny piece of the</p><p>vitamin E complex in high potencies but</p><p>made synthetically they they do not do</p><p>Studies and natural vitamin E and that&rsquo;s</p><p>why it comes out bad so this is a</p><p>natural vitamin E complex you have</p><p>there&rsquo;s actually eight to cough rows</p><p>alpha beta Delta Gamma and it keeps</p><p>going on and up xanthine selenium</p><p>vitamin F 1 to e 2 these are all vitamin</p><p>E come parts of the vitamin E complex so</p><p>when you&rsquo;re getting a synthetic - kafra</p><p>you&rsquo;re just getting an eggshell you&rsquo;re</p><p>not getting the whole thing</p><p>I mean vitamin E especially with dr.</p><p>rules royalties research I mean he&rsquo;s</p><p>he&rsquo;s you could take angina and just turn</p><p>it off within 10 minutes by giving the</p><p>person vitamin A - or the vitamin E</p><p>complex I had a guy several people come</p><p>into my office with what</p><p>severe angina and I load them up with</p><p>you too and they do very very well</p><p>okay so let&rsquo;s say enjoying a left</p><p>shoulder pain but now here&rsquo;s a question</p><p>why would you be deficient in E vitamin</p><p>E well it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s um I already</p><p>went through that because it&rsquo;s a refined</p><p>flour disease it&rsquo;s bleached flour when</p><p>they bleach the flour to make breads</p><p>pasta cereal crackers viscous waffles</p><p>pancakes when you consume the flour</p><p>products that are bleach it destroys all</p><p>the vitamin E in your body that&rsquo;s why</p><p>chloride bleach so chlorine is very</p><p>reactive to vitamin E it oxidizes</p><p>vitamin E so anytime you have a history</p><p>of eating sugar refined sugar refined</p><p>flour you&rsquo;re going to create some</p><p>serious vitamin E complexes vitamin</p><p>deficiencies and that&rsquo;s really any</p><p>people anyone that you know that it&rsquo;s</p><p>angina they&rsquo;re typically consuming way</p><p>too much bread pasta sort of things like</p><p>that so if you did Ezekiel bread that</p><p>probably would be a lot better okay now</p><p>we&rsquo;re going to switch to another</p><p>electrolyte called the sodium myth all</p><p>right we talked about calcium we talked</p><p>about vitamin D vitamin k2 and I&rsquo;m going</p><p>fast because I just have a lot of data</p><p>sodium to check this out the risk for</p><p>death from any cause appeared 24%</p><p>greater for those consuming lower salts</p><p>what this goes against everything that&rsquo;s</p><p>right why do we need so D imodium has an</p><p>RDA a recommended amount a requirement</p><p>of roughly about 2,400 milligrams that&rsquo;s</p><p>a teaspoon of sea salt a day that&rsquo;s how</p><p>much we need if you lower your salt</p><p>intake you basically and you increase</p><p>your water intake you dehydrate your</p><p>cells and you put lots of stress on the</p><p>heart</p><p>okay so low salt diet</p><p>create a lot of weakness within the</p><p>heart and the person may lower the blood</p><p>pressure a little bit but the heart</p><p>suffers because it doesn&rsquo;t have the</p><p>electrolyte so all this water drinking</p><p>without the salt you&rsquo;re just going to</p><p>basically dilute the body in and cause</p><p>massive dehydration and so we need salt</p><p>it&rsquo;s not bad</p><p>sea salt is totally fine but realize</p><p>when you when you have sodium chloride</p><p>40 percent of that is sodium and 60</p><p>percent of it&rsquo;s chloride so really it&rsquo;s</p><p>not necessarily you can&rsquo;t take like a</p><p>teaspoon of salt and think you&rsquo;re</p><p>getting a hundred percent sodium you&rsquo;re</p><p>getting only lessen half of that is</p><p>actual sodium just FYI and guess what</p><p>we need the so of the salt the chlorides</p><p>to build up the stomach acids if you</p><p>have a low salt diet you end up having</p><p>heartburn because you don&rsquo;t have the raw</p><p>material to build up the hydrochloric</p><p>acid then you can absorb the calcium and</p><p>the statins cause deficiency of of all</p><p>the electrolytes except calcium so the</p><p>whole thing is set up to make to propel</p><p>or to enhance more heart problems it&rsquo;s</p><p>crazy okay</p><p>diuretics diuretics deplete potassium</p><p>sodium magnesium but they keep the</p><p>calcium they&rsquo;re crazy crazy so here you</p><p>are trying to lower your blood pressure</p><p>but guess what you&rsquo;re lowering the</p><p>electrolytes that&rsquo;s going to create high</p><p>blood pressure see potassium and</p><p>magnesium lower blood pressure they&rsquo;re</p><p>calming minerals they relax the body</p><p>calcium increases blood pressure the</p><p>other thing is that um potassium is</p><p>necessary to hydrate if you have high</p><p>blood pressure and let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re you</p><p>want to keep eating salt and you lighten</p><p>you&rsquo;re craving salt what you should do</p><p>is just increase your potassium intake</p><p>to offset the the excess sodium so let</p><p>me show you this real fast because so</p><p>look at this right here so we have</p><p>sodium and potassium they work together</p><p>you need forty seven hundred milligrams</p><p>need about a thousand to twenty three</p><p>hundred or twenty-four hundred</p><p>milligrams so we need four times as much</p><p>potassium but what most people do is</p><p>they consume way too much sodium from</p><p>the monosodium glutamate in the Chinese</p><p>food the junk food the chips like me I</p><p>used to have the huge bag of chips I</p><p>would have mass amounts of salt if your</p><p>adrenals are weak you need salt as well</p><p>so if salt is not a bad thing but you</p><p>know you ever notice why sometimes you</p><p>crave sweet and then you create salt</p><p>back and forth you&rsquo;re trying to get more</p><p>hydrated potassium will help balance the</p><p>sodium no does this they&rsquo;re heavy here</p><p>and so the doctor saying lower this no</p><p>no we need to increase this potassium is</p><p>what we need to increase forget the bit</p><p>to add a sodium that&rsquo;s easy to get from</p><p>the diet this is hard to get okay so</p><p>someone says what can I do to increase</p><p>my cholesterol start consuming more</p><p>cholesterol foods that could bring it</p><p>where I would even worry about it that&rsquo;s</p><p>too low I mean it really depends if it&rsquo;s</p><p>really too low but typically you want to</p><p>start consuming more cholesterol to help</p><p>balance it because your body will just</p><p>make more if you actually eat less all</p><p>right so someone says I do thirty k ds</p><p>so here&rsquo;s the rule of thumb between d3</p><p>and k2 it should be 100 micrograms to</p><p>10,000 IU&rsquo;s of d3 one</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry 100 micrograms of k2 to 10,000</p><p>IU&rsquo;s of d3 this is I use international</p><p>units micrograms k2 that&rsquo;s the ratio now</p><p>it could be different from person to</p><p>person but that&rsquo;s just a general ratio</p><p>that you might want to follow okay</p><p>someone&rsquo;s asking about G butter yeah you</p><p>can do grass peggy all day long that&rsquo;s</p><p>totally fine alright so let me see here</p><p>you guys have a lot of good questions</p><p>lottie&rsquo;s questions are going to be</p><p>answered as we go through but I just</p><p>wanted to show you that one thing there</p><p>okay now let&rsquo;s talk about magnesium wow</p><p>this is a really important mineral in</p><p>relationship to atrial fibrillation and</p><p>arrhythmia problems magnesium works with</p><p>calcium magnesium cleans out the</p><p>receptor for calcium when the heart</p><p>contracts magnesium cleans up the</p><p>calcium silicon relax</p><p>if you can&rsquo;t relax if your muscles can&rsquo;t</p><p>let go you need magnesium of course you</p><p>need potassium as well but magnesium is</p><p>a really key mineral I do not recommend</p><p>magnesium oxide um you can do the</p><p>magnesium Pico which is the Micra very</p><p>small amounts um but honestly I&rsquo;ll show</p><p>you where I like to get I&rsquo;d like to get</p><p>my magnesium from food I&rsquo;ll tell you</p><p>what food has the highest in a bit but</p><p>check this out magnesium is a major</p><p>electrolyte in the heart it it controls</p><p>the heartbeat in the relaxation phase it</p><p>works closely with calcium and potassium</p><p>but</p><p>considered a natural channel a calcium</p><p>channel blocker so what they really</p><p>should do is is give you the magnesium</p><p>instead of the calcium channel blocker</p><p>especially for blood pressure the</p><p>highest concentrations of magnesium are</p><p>in your left ventricle of your heart</p><p>interest interesting so this is what</p><p>happens the contraction of the heartbeat</p><p>the relaxation of the magnesium calcium</p><p>magnesium working together if you&rsquo;re</p><p>deficient you get arrhythmias rapid</p><p>heartbeat stiff arteries because</p><p>magnesium will help lower calcium high</p><p>blood pressure angina excessive calcium</p><p>mitral valve prolapse overactive stress</p><p>hormones I mean think about how many</p><p>people have these problems so a lot of</p><p>these these nutrients tend to cross over</p><p>and help other problems not just it&rsquo;s</p><p>not just like if you&rsquo;re deficient by</p><p>museum you need this you need kind of</p><p>all the electrolytes in the right</p><p>amounts now if you wanted it here&rsquo;s</p><p>people I just want to say well we&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna do a test well first of all</p><p>doctors never ever test magnesium and</p><p>even if they do like patatas</p><p>electrolytes aren&rsquo;t always in the blood</p><p>they&rsquo;re in the cells so rarely do they</p><p>show up and even your body will pull</p><p>minerals from your bone to keep your</p><p>blood normal so it&rsquo;s not always the best</p><p>way to assess if you want to check your</p><p>magnesium um get a red blood a magnesium</p><p>red blood cell test okay you can get</p><p>them online and test it if you wanted to</p><p>test it okay so check this out this is</p><p>fascinating</p><p>chlorophyll chlorophyll is the green of</p><p>the plant magnesium is in leafy greens</p><p>okay that&rsquo;s where you get it because</p><p>it&rsquo;s in it&rsquo;s the main mineral in</p><p>chlorophyll wow that&rsquo;s cool so it&rsquo;s</p><p>actually green so it gives you um or</p><p>actually reflects green it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>absorbs all the other colors so it</p><p>reflects green so it becomes green so</p><p>chlorophyll is how you get the magnesium</p><p>um and yes</p><p>I get it from my wheatgrass juice powder</p><p>its raw organic unheated grown on an</p><p>ancient seed bed so you have all the</p><p>trace minerals with mass amounts of</p><p>magnesium it has a very calming effect</p><p>it&rsquo;s wonderful for the heart it&rsquo;s a</p><p>hundred percent absorbable so that&rsquo;s how</p><p>I get my magnesium</p><p>I&rsquo;ll take always take my wheatgrass with</p><p>the k2 + d3 together and I really if I</p><p>don&rsquo;t take them together it&rsquo;s I feel</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t feel as good but chlorophyll ok</p><p>let&rsquo;s talk let&rsquo;s shift our gears to</p><p>potassium real fast the task and</p><p>efficiency interesting interesting</p><p>interesting the potassium controls the</p><p>heart rate okay if you&rsquo;re deficient in</p><p>potassium you have a high poverty and</p><p>you will also have a labored heart beat</p><p>a strong heart beat that you will be</p><p>able to hear in your inner ear when you</p><p>put your head in the pillow potassium</p><p>becomes depleted after a heavy</p><p>carbohydrate meal okay I think I&rsquo;ve told</p><p>you guys the story up when I was getting</p><p>married and we&rsquo;re out looking for this</p><p>is 25 years ago I was looking for</p><p>wedding cakes and so we find this</p><p>Italian restaurant and they were closing</p><p>up and this is after having a pizza I</p><p>had that bread I had this dessert I had</p><p>the wine I had all this carbohydrate</p><p>right and then they&rsquo;re going to shoot</p><p>out all these desserts were the last</p><p>people there so of course I couldn&rsquo;t see</p><p>that go to waste so I said hey hold up</p><p>bring that over here and we started</p><p>eating all these samples of all these</p><p>cakes I remember driving home and I</p><p>noticed I&rsquo;m like I don&rsquo;t feel right I</p><p>feel incredibly thirsty right now I did</p><p>not sleep one little minute I was my</p><p>heart was beating that&rsquo;s because it</p><p>created a potassium deficiency um so in</p><p>other words carbohydrates refined</p><p>carbohydrates are very bad for potassium</p><p>all right so potassium controls a heart</p><p>rate I saw this online I just thought</p><p>this was kind of funny someone was</p><p>making a comment on might have been</p><p>Yahoo or something it says I&rsquo;ve been a</p><p>little I&rsquo;ve done a little bit of</p><p>research I&rsquo;ve done a little bit of</p><p>googling and searching nutrition</p><p>textbooks and I haven&rsquo;t been able to</p><p>find the sources that explain how RDA is</p><p>for potassium got to be so much more</p><p>than any person normally eats that is so</p><p>funny well that&rsquo;s because no one eats</p><p>what they need this is right here the</p><p>RDAs implied that there would be some</p><p>benefit to reaching the target where</p><p>some elevated risk of falling short of</p><p>it does anyone know what research it was</p><p>it led to the recommendation listen we</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to we don&rsquo;t um form our</p><p>recommended</p><p>rdas based on what the population eats</p><p>okay that&rsquo;s really bad we want if we</p><p>want to eat what we recommend tea you</p><p>know like from like certain nutrient</p><p>requirements so this is what you&rsquo;d have</p><p>to do you&rsquo;d have to have like eight</p><p>bananas five avocados to eat your</p><p>potassium it&rsquo;s very difficult to get</p><p>potassium because bananas only is like</p><p>300 milligrams you need 4700 avocados</p><p>have 800 milligrams so where do you get</p><p>your potassium right there salad leafy</p><p>greens because you know why because</p><p>you&rsquo;ll get the magnesium as well you get</p><p>the potassium magnesium you&rsquo;ll get even</p><p>sodium in nature</p><p>sodium always comes a little bit lower</p><p>in vegetables but you that&rsquo;s why we have</p><p>salt sea salt so what should you do you</p><p>really need to start increasing your</p><p>vegetables why because the pills if you</p><p>take potassium pills and magnesium pills</p><p>they those are individual called</p><p>elemental minerals they&rsquo;re not in the</p><p>right combinations always and it&rsquo;s</p><p>really hard to know how much you have to</p><p>take</p><p>it&rsquo;s much better if you have the food or</p><p>a food concentrate so you need bigger</p><p>salads if I had a heart problem if I had</p><p>higher blood pressure I would be</p><p>consuming no less than ten cups of salad</p><p>every single day and make sure the</p><p>lettuce is really high-quality make sure</p><p>it&rsquo;s good if you want spinach that&rsquo;s</p><p>totally fine but that&rsquo;s how you want to</p><p>start to reverse this heart problem</p><p>okay we&rsquo;re switching gears vitamin B</p><p>complex now how many of you have ever</p><p>heard a vitamin before before that&rsquo;s not</p><p>that&rsquo;s not a Congre well as you already</p><p>know the first B vitamin that was ever</p><p>discovers b1 right and then it goes B to</p><p>3 and then what 5 and 6 and 8 and 10 and</p><p>12 there&rsquo;s actually a vitamin b4</p><p>you can look it up and b4 is is an</p><p>amazing umm nerve conduction vitamin</p><p>that helps snap the heart back into tone</p><p>it helps the tone of the heart it&rsquo;s</p><p>wonderful for fibrillation and it&rsquo;s</p><p>wonderful for a large heart when the</p><p>heart becomes deficient in vitamin</p><p>before it starts to Sag in droop and it</p><p>loses tone and that&rsquo;s called in a large</p><p>tart or cardiomegaly and then what</p><p>happens the valves don&rsquo;t close like they</p><p>should because they have now stretched</p><p>out and then you get murmurs so be</p><p>vitamin deficiencies create murmurs and</p><p>a couple sources of the B vitamins you</p><p>can get it from nutritional yeast which</p><p>by the way is kind of half of I have a</p><p>nutritional yeast product is called</p><p>adrenal de formula because half of it is</p><p>nutritional yeast</p><p>but it&rsquo;s no synthetics it&rsquo;s very</p><p>difficult to get nutritional yeast</p><p>without having it fortified with</p><p>synthetics but guess what else has to be</p><p>complex including before we grass juice</p><p>powder or wheat grass it contains</p><p>most all of the b-complex which is very</p><p>cool because it has the magnesium the</p><p>vitamin C it has the key doesn&rsquo;t have</p><p>the k2 but it has all electrolytes okay</p><p>so that&rsquo;s the B for complex now how do</p><p>you become deficient in before by</p><p>consuming too many refined flour</p><p>products and um sugar and that&rsquo;s why</p><p>they enrich the all the flour products</p><p>with B vitamins by the way because they</p><p>when they refine the food they deplete</p><p>the B vitamin C when I was doing all</p><p>this research with the heart-machine um</p><p>you could see some cereal when you do</p><p>people like the B complex you can see</p><p>changes within ten minutes on the heart</p><p>heartbeats of course I&rsquo;m not going to</p><p>make any claims because the heart the</p><p>cardiovascular industry is highly</p><p>suppressive with anything alternative so</p><p>here&rsquo;s my disclaimer all this</p><p>information is educational it&rsquo;s for your</p><p>entertainment</p><p>before you apply in it apply any to see</p><p>your doctor</p><p>I&rsquo;m not making any claims that any of</p><p>this will cure you of any diseases okay</p><p>that&rsquo;s my disclaimer okay let&rsquo;s go to</p><p>coronary constriction now the coronary</p><p>artery is the heart the artery that</p><p>surrounds the heart and a lot of times</p><p>it gets constricted and it tightens up</p><p>and it goes in a spasm and that&rsquo;s</p><p>because the person is running out of</p><p>adrenal hormones when the adrenal gland</p><p>becomes weakened there&rsquo;s two things that</p><p>happen the blood pressure goes up but</p><p>the coronary artery becomes I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>the coronary artery gets constricted and</p><p>the the lung becomes constricted so you</p><p>have like a constricted lung asthma and</p><p>you have heart problems angina so if you</p><p>have coronary heart constriction or</p><p>spasm or bronchial stuff or asthma I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to recommend you support the</p><p>adrenal gland and again I have a lot of</p><p>different products for that but I</p><p>recommend the new one for that which is</p><p>the Corrib it&rsquo;s called them</p><p>cortisol support formula it&rsquo;s seriously</p><p>powerful support to any chronic</p><p>inflammatory problems but for the heart</p><p>it&rsquo;s really good especially if you have</p><p>like a spasm like that okay so check</p><p>this out so if we have a muscular</p><p>problem we have the muscle cramp low</p><p>vitamin e to anti spasm coronary its</p><p>adrenal arrhythmias is low magnesium low</p><p>potassium high calcium low pulse rate is</p><p>low potassium</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry high pulse rate is low</p><p>potassium low pulse rate is low adrenals</p><p>or low salt valvular problems murmurs or</p><p>B vitamin deficiencies vascular clogged</p><p>arteries is lo que to low vitamin C</p><p>blood pressure low potassium high sodium</p><p>so if we just kind of scan like let&rsquo;s</p><p>look at this for a second you get all</p><p>these electrolytes right and you got</p><p>these B vitamins there&rsquo;s a common thread</p><p>here you have to eat more vegetable</p><p>definitely sea salt leafy greens but</p><p>look at you need more fat you need more</p><p>grass-fed fat that&rsquo;s what people are</p><p>missing the combination of the grass-fed</p><p>meats or the fat and the vegetable is it</p><p>be the perfect diet for the heart but</p><p>guess what Health Care says avoid fat</p><p>eggs butter salt sixty Peter that whole</p><p>grains drink two glasses wine take your</p><p>lipitor diuretics take your calcium</p><p>channel blockers and that ignited this</p><p>there&rsquo;s no difference drink all your</p><p>water take your vitamin D without k2 and</p><p>it doesn&rsquo;t show up on a test you&rsquo;re fine</p><p>I mean it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p><p>outrageous it&rsquo;s just basically honestly</p><p>from my viewpoint it&rsquo;s the biggest scam</p><p>on the planet right now there&rsquo;s no</p><p>health and health care it&rsquo;s missing now</p><p>there are some hidden little things that</p><p>you can run into if you&rsquo;re taking these</p><p>fats I love item ins if you don&rsquo;t have a</p><p>gallbladder or if you have low bile you</p><p>won&rsquo;t be able to absorb the fat Seibel</p><p>vitamins so in that case I recommend the</p><p>gallbladder formula because that will</p><p>help you absorb it and also if your</p><p>stomach has low acids</p><p>and how do you know if you have low</p><p>stomach acids well if you eat and you</p><p>get indigestion or if you get heartburn</p><p>or acid reflux then you need more acid</p><p>that means that you&rsquo;re not going to pull</p><p>the minerals in so your muscles are</p><p>going to be all spasmodic and hard and</p><p>your hearts going to suffer because of</p><p>it real quickly the liver the liver is</p><p>the backup chamber like a sponge for the</p><p>heart and if the liver is bad it won&rsquo;t</p><p>be able to back up the heart as much in</p><p>that case it puts a lot of stress on the</p><p>heart so a bad liver will put stress in</p><p>the heart and that&rsquo;s why if you have a</p><p>liver problem you should always sleep on</p><p>your right side so the heart sits on top</p><p>of the liver not so your liver sits on</p><p>top of that heart stomach acids decrease</p><p>with age so a lot of people just need to</p><p>tweak the they need to tweak their</p><p>stomach acids like without cider vinegar</p><p>that would be really really important</p><p>okay so I just crammed a lot of data um</p><p>I just want to take a little break here</p><p>just see if there&rsquo;s any questions can</p><p>you borrow boiled parsley yeah you can</p><p>for potassium yeah it&rsquo;s really hard to</p><p>kill the potassium if you heat it um I</p><p>still drink apple cider vinegar but it</p><p>does give me heartburn ironically well</p><p>that could be you need probably some</p><p>more probiotics to start building up</p><p>down here because some people have</p><p>something called gastritis they have</p><p>little information that that might not</p><p>they might need to kind of work on their</p><p>bowels a bit more before they certify</p><p>the stomach because I&rsquo;ve had I had some</p><p>people were they episode vinegar didn&rsquo;t</p><p>do well on them and so we gave them the</p><p>liquid probiotic and they did really</p><p>well on that so that&rsquo;s how you can</p><p>acidify your body</p><p>alright coconut</p><p>that water does have electrolytes it&rsquo;s</p><p>like the perfect electric it&rsquo;s just a</p><p>little bit high in sugar if you&rsquo;re</p><p>trying to lose weight baking soda is not</p><p>good I don&rsquo;t recommend baking soda it&rsquo;s</p><p>going to alkalize you um okay</p><p>how much magnesium should I take well</p><p>guess what I&rsquo;m gonna give you the</p><p>download in fact I&rsquo;m gonna give it to</p><p>you right now you guys want the download</p><p>well we&rsquo;re not done yet but I&rsquo;m just I</p><p>want to send you the download so you</p><p>Lise have let me see if I can send it to</p><p>everyone</p><p>I think this is it try that and then I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to try to send a download to</p><p>everyone you see here tell me if you got</p><p>it and then what I&rsquo;ll do is I think I</p><p>could send I think I could send</p><p>something in the chat I&rsquo;ll say here yeah</p><p>here we go</p><p>splay sticky message yeah I think that</p><p>worked can you guys get it so you&rsquo;ll be</p><p>able to download the notes because I&rsquo;m</p><p>covering a lot of information and</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot there&rsquo;s no way to go</p><p>basically</p><p>short cut it because there&rsquo;s just so</p><p>much data but I hope you see so there&rsquo;s</p><p>a pattern of things that are telling you</p><p>to hey listen you need to start eating</p><p>better okay I&rsquo;m just going to just</p><p>really quickly see if there&rsquo;s any</p><p>questions because you got Ivan took</p><p>blabbing for a while David said the</p><p>cortisol support is awesome help me a</p><p>lot thanks dude um it&rsquo;s really good for</p><p>chronic burnt-out people basically okay</p><p>okay good you&rsquo;re getting that awesome</p><p>okay all right so let me just get right</p><p>back into this because I need to show</p><p>you some other things here we go okay so</p><p>we grass juice some a lot of you are</p><p>already trying to wheatgrass juice</p><p>powder wheatgrass juice is very</p><p>interesting because wheatgrass has tons</p><p>of chlorophyll um the type of wheatgrass</p><p>that I recommend is is a wheatgrass</p><p>juice powder now to powder just a group</p><p>wheatgrass powder so it&rsquo;s way more</p><p>concentrated so one teaspoons are pulled</p><p>in to about six to ten shots a</p><p>wheatgrass juice that is so much</p><p>magnesium it&rsquo;s crazy so this is a plant</p><p>based magnesium with all the trace</p><p>minerals with two B vitamins with</p><p>vitamin C with potassium so it&rsquo;s really</p><p>good for the heart and these are the</p><p>other two things anti soft-tissue</p><p>calcium affect vitamin k2 this is the</p><p>mk7 version that&rsquo;s the natural one and</p><p>then v3 my t3 comes in 10,000 IU&rsquo;s per</p><p>pill so that way it&rsquo;s just a one to one</p><p>ratio to keep it simple when people are</p><p>taking this some people even have a</p><p>little more crust coming out of there</p><p>inside their eye in the morning</p><p>that&rsquo;s calcium coming out we&rsquo;re tartar I</p><p>mean they might have a little more</p><p>tartar as it comes out sometimes it&rsquo;s</p><p>less but you want to take this until the</p><p>inside of your</p><p>teeth is real smooth and and no more</p><p>calcium buildup but tartar really comes</p><p>from a k2 deficiency so this is the if</p><p>you notice I actually put a little bit</p><p>of vitamin C because vitamin C and</p><p>vitamin k2 work together</p><p>and a lot of alfalfa 300 milligrams that</p><p>gives you all the vitamin k2 complex</p><p>nutrients all in one so that way you&rsquo;re</p><p>not just taking k2 you&rsquo;re taking all</p><p>eight versions of k1 so that&rsquo;s a really</p><p>cool benefit best source of magnesium B</p><p>vitamin C and potassium the chlorophyll</p><p>the only difference between our blood</p><p>and magnesium is the mineral magnesium</p><p>versus iron so magnesium is a real key</p><p>thing that I think people don&rsquo;t get</p><p>enough of because it&rsquo;s in the leafy</p><p>greens so you want to get your minerals</p><p>and your fat side with vitamins this is</p><p>the protocol that I recommend if you are</p><p>using my products raw organic wheatgrass</p><p>1 to 2 teaspoons a day one little</p><p>scoopers the d3 for in the morning with</p><p>breakfast for k2 in the morning with</p><p>breakfast now this is if you have a</p><p>problem if you don&rsquo;t have a problem then</p><p>you can just take one to one and</p><p>maintain it and maintain it so you can</p><p>prevent a problem but I&rsquo;m talking about</p><p>if you want to lower blood pressure and</p><p>clean up the heart now I always at these</p><p>webinars give people a little break a</p><p>discount on things and so if you wanted</p><p>to get any of my products I give you I&rsquo;m</p><p>giving you a one-time offer that allows</p><p>you to UM get a discount so let me just</p><p>pull it up right here if I could find it</p><p>yeah so you would want to you want to</p><p>get that coupon code and then you can</p><p>use it one time within the next 25 hours</p><p>and you can get any wheatgrass</p><p>unless you already have it</p><p>or the k2 whatever you want to get and</p><p>you just tell you order it up on website</p><p>and you can just click on put the code</p><p>in you get the discount and then that</p><p>way you can take something that is</p><p>high-quality now the other thing is that</p><p>one of the problems that people are</p><p>taking with the k2 is they&rsquo;re taking the</p><p>MK 4 version so I&rsquo;m going to explain</p><p>what MK 4 version is that is a synthetic</p><p>version and the lot of the studies have</p><p>not come out yet on the long term</p><p>effects of taking that synthetically I</p><p>experimented on myself and others and</p><p>I&rsquo;ve not seen the results so mk7 is the</p><p>version that you would want from the k2</p><p>and if you&rsquo;re vegetarian that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p><p>mean you take Nadeau and my my um k2 is</p><p>vegetarian NATO is a non GMO the one I</p><p>use is non-gmo soy fermented soy product</p><p>from Japan and there is a dish that you</p><p>can consume personally it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s</p><p>very disgusting but it&rsquo;s filled with k2</p><p>and what happens the k2 kind of goes</p><p>into the body and it starts to slowly</p><p>extract calcium from the body and when</p><p>it pulls it out it puts it into the bone</p><p>and it makes it really solid so that&rsquo;s</p><p>what k2 does um the other thing I wanted</p><p>to mention is I wanted to just to kind</p><p>of give you a little summary here so</p><p>this is calcium this is potassium</p><p>magnesium and sodium okay so now let&rsquo;s</p><p>take a look so make sodium is sea salt</p><p>also low-sodium will actually cause low</p><p>stomach acids sodium if you&rsquo;re low</p><p>sodium it will actually create a</p><p>dehydration so potassium will lower the</p><p>pulse rate remember what foods deplete</p><p>potassium sugar</p><p>remember what foods butea decrease</p><p>vitamin B for refined grains bleached</p><p>flour disease and then you have e to or</p><p>a vitamin E complex that&rsquo;s for angina</p><p>and refined flour products there another</p><p>problem and then we have potassium how</p><p>do you know if you&rsquo;re deficient in</p><p>potassium you&rsquo;re craving sweets sweet</p><p>cravings means you&rsquo;re low on potassium</p><p>plus you need about seven to ten cups of</p><p>vegetables per day honestly I do ten</p><p>cups in one sitting it&rsquo;s not that hard</p><p>you can blend it in a kale shake if you</p><p>want um</p><p>potassium is also necessary for heart</p><p>strength as well so if you&rsquo;re feeling</p><p>weak you could be low on potassium</p><p>calcium most people get enough calcium</p><p>very easily from there from a little bit</p><p>of dairy and from the vegetables so you</p><p>can get calcium from your vegetables but</p><p>calcium needs to absorb in an acid</p><p>medium calcium will cause high blood</p><p>pressure calcium is involved in the</p><p>clotting or the formation of a clot and</p><p>you need k2 to lower calcium and d3</p><p>magnesium is in leafy greens and</p><p>chlorophyll magnesium is good for heart</p><p>rhythm problems like arrhythmias atrial</p><p>fibrillation also angina vitamin E is</p><p>high-altitude oxygen gives you more</p><p>oxygen so you can breathe better and any</p><p>cramps that you have you can try try</p><p>vitamin E too</p><p>vitamin E will make you stronger people</p><p>that are weak need vitamin E especially</p><p>the muscles now what happens is that if</p><p>you need some calcium I recommend you</p><p>get it from food not from a supplement</p><p>and so you can can like a little bit of</p><p>cheese grass-fed cheese things like that</p><p>but how do you know that you need</p><p>calcium if you have leg cramps or your</p><p>your toes are cramped okay let me just</p><p>see if there&rsquo;s any quick questions what</p><p>about bananas bananas have 300</p><p>milligrams of potassium you need 4700 so</p><p>how many men is when you need you need a</p><p>lot so we got blood pressure high blood</p><p>pressure one of the things you have to</p><p>take for high blood pressure magnesium</p><p>potassium K 2 and D 3 right arrhythmias</p><p>you want magnesium potassium are good</p><p>and what about high pulse rate what do</p><p>you take for that potassium C the</p><p>hardest nutrients to get is potassium</p><p>potassium because you need so much</p><p>magnesium most an average diet is low in</p><p>magnesium as well but not as much as</p><p>potassium</p><p>so mainly we are deficient in potassium</p><p>and magnesium as a main thing in k2</p><p>we&rsquo;re high usually in sodium we&rsquo;re</p><p>really high in calcium and that&rsquo;s why we</p><p>have the problems okay good so I just</p><p>want to see if there&rsquo;s any questions so</p><p>someone says I wrote to in 2016 you call</p><p>in the office okay and I&rsquo;ll go if you</p><p>have a question I&rsquo;ll be more than happy</p><p>to talk to you but awesome about getting</p><p>the success I want to I want to actually</p><p>get your success story now as far as a</p><p>pacemaker goes you have three pacemakers</p><p>in the heart if you already had a</p><p>pacemaker put in you have an artificial</p><p>pacemaker is really you still want the</p><p>nutrition but you you might want to</p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to obviously</p><p>fix that because it&rsquo;s being artificially</p><p>uh synchronized in the beat but Mike my</p><p>father has a pacemaker and it&rsquo;s</p><p>interesting that he lost all of his</p><p>teeth like what&rsquo;s up with that so I know</p><p>he was deficient in the k2</p><p>I know his diet wasn&rsquo;t that great but</p><p>the point is that if you can start out</p><p>your kids your grandkids with these</p><p>nutrients with the electrolytes with the</p><p>diet with the k2 they won&rsquo;t have all</p><p>these problems like we do okay some</p><p>other people are asking can you ship to</p><p>Europe yes we can ship here you&rsquo;d have</p><p>to just email so we can tell you the</p><p>specific cost of that um when planning</p><p>come to your clinic arm to fly how long</p><p>do I stay in town well we could find out</p><p>based on what kind of problems you have</p><p>you just call us there&rsquo;s a hotel down</p><p>the street a lot of times people stay</p><p>for a few days to a week and then we</p><p>work on you</p><p>um let&rsquo;s see here Wow your cholesterol</p><p>is 110 I think that&rsquo;s fine I don&rsquo;t think</p><p>that&rsquo;s the problem okay</p><p>anxiety panic attacks cause ristmas yes</p><p>I need to cover that because stress we&rsquo;d</p><p>even talk about stress so let me just</p><p>kind of cover that real fast and I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to end up because I promise one</p><p>hour</p><p>um the adrenal glands back up the heart</p><p>rate the adrenal glands produce</p><p>adrenaline cortisol and those severely</p><p>keep you up at night to prevent the</p><p>sleeping and they also create a lot of</p><p>stress in the heart if you&rsquo;re not</p><p>sleeping your heart&rsquo;s going to suffer</p><p>bad so there&rsquo;s a new adrenal thing I</p><p>have is called a vegan formula it&rsquo;s</p><p>called adrenal night formula it&rsquo;s a 30</p><p>day supply that is a little bit stronger</p><p>than the other one I had and that&rsquo;s what</p><p>I would use for sleep if you can&rsquo;t sleep</p><p>if you sleep your stress goes down if</p><p>you can&rsquo;t sleep the stress goes up but</p><p>over years of constant stress that can</p><p>really burn your heart out and so you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna have to support the adrenal glands</p><p>because when you lose the function of</p><p>adrenal glands your coronary starts</p><p>tightening up and you can Han China</p><p>that&rsquo;s why people like stress induced</p><p>heart attacks so you&rsquo;re going to have to</p><p>work on that with your adrenals so</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot more to cover about with</p><p>with the nervous system connection with</p><p>the heart but I wanted to give you a</p><p>quick summary of the nutrition</p><p>connection to the heart did you guys</p><p>learn something that you that you never</p><p>knew before and did you enjoy the</p><p>education that you got of course there&rsquo;s</p><p>a delay let me someone says give me the</p><p>they need the code again let me just</p><p>give you that code okay</p><p>right here there&rsquo;s the code let me see</p><p>if I could put it over here this is the</p><p>code that you would type in or just save</p><p>it and you can use it as a one-time</p><p>thing to get a discount on my web</p><p>website which by the way I just upgraded</p><p>so I made it a little bit cleaner to</p><p>look at but it&rsquo;s the same information so</p><p>anyway I want to thank you guys because</p><p>you&rsquo;re giving me I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re</p><p>enjoying it I&rsquo;m so glad that you&rsquo;ve got</p><p>some great things out of this I want to</p><p>just kind of give you some of the heart</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to be doing more of these in</p><p>the future thank you for sticking around</p><p>this late unless you&rsquo;re in California is</p><p>probably early but I want to thank you</p><p>and definitely apply what we taught you</p><p>tonight and please send me your success</p><p>stories and spread the word and we&rsquo;ll</p><p>see you in the next seminar okay all</p><p>right guys have a good one</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section
