    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is about the biology, psychology,</p>
<p>and practices of social bonding.</p>
<p>From the day we are born until the day we die,</p>
<p>the quality of our social bonds</p>
<p>dictates much of our quality of life.</p>
<p>It should therefore be no surprise that our brain,</p>
<p>and indeed much of our entire nervous system,</p>
<p>is wired for social bonds.</p>
<p>Now, social bonds occur between infant and parent.</p>
<p>There are even particular wiring diagrams</p>
<p>within the brain and spinal cord and body</p>
<p>that are oriented towards the specific bonds</p>
<p>that occur between infant and mother,</p>
<p>as well as infant and father.</p>
<p>And we have specific brain circuitries for friendship,</p>
<p>specific brain circuitries that are activated</p>
<p>in romantic relationships.</p>
<p>And as it goes, specific brain circuitries</p>
<p>that are activated when we break up with a romantic partner</p>
<p>or when they break up with us,</p>
<p>or when somebody passes away, moves away,</p>
<p>or otherwise leaves our lives in one form or another.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to talk about</p>
<p>those brain and nervous system circuitries.</p>
<p>We are also going to talk about the neurochemicals</p>
<p>and hormones that underlie their function.</p>
<p>And we are going to touch on a number of important</p>
<p>and actionable tools that you can apply in everyday life.</p>
<p>And because we are headed into the holiday,</p>
<p>the New Year&rsquo;s and Christmas holiday,</p>
<p>that you can deploy in your various interactions</p>
<p>with family members and friends.</p>
<p>And should you not be spending time</p>
<p>with family members and friends,</p>
<p>today we are also going to talk about</p>
<p>how to achieve social bonds out of the context</p>
<p>of family and romantic partnership and friendship.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s episode is going to include a lot of science,</p>
<p>a lot of actionable tools,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m confident that you will come away</p>
<p>from today&rsquo;s episode with tremendous knowledge</p>
<p>about how you function.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&rsquo;re an introvert or an extrovert,</p>
<p>why is that?</p>
<p>Turns out there may be a neurochemical basis for that.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re somebody that really enjoys social media.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re somebody that doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to talk about a gene or a set of genes</p>
<p>that predicts whether or not you will follow more people</p>
<p>or seek out more online social interactions or fewer.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there&rsquo;s biology around that now,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s excellent peer-reviewed work.</p>
<p>We will also talk about how bonds are broken</p>
<p>and why breakups can be so painful,</p>
<p>not just romantic breakups,</p>
<p>but breakups with friendships and coworkers</p>
<p>and how to move through those more seamlessly.</p>
<p>So regardless of your age and regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>you are in a romantic partnership of one form or another</p>
<p>or not, I do believe this episode will be useful to you</p>
<p>as you explore the social bonds that already exist</p>
<p>in your life and as you seek out new</p>
<p>and changing social bonds.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the biology of social bonding.</p>
<p>And I want to point out</p>
<p>that I use the word bonding intentionally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a verb.</p>
<p>And in biology, we want to think about verbs</p>
<p>because everything in biology is a process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an event.</p>
<p>And when we think about things in biology as a process,</p>
<p>that means it&rsquo;s going to have multiple steps.</p>
<p>And today we are going to explore the steps,</p>
<p>start to finish of social bonding,</p>
<p>meaning how social bonds are established,</p>
<p>how they are maintained, how they are broken,</p>
<p>and how they are reestablished.</p>
<p>Now, an important feature of biology generally,</p>
<p>but in particular, as it relates to social bonding,</p>
<p>is that the neural circuits,</p>
<p>meaning the brain areas and neurons and the hormones,</p>
<p>things like oxytocin, which we&rsquo;ll talk about today,</p>
<p>and the other chemicals in the brain and body</p>
<p>that are responsible for the process we call social bonding</p>
<p>are not unique to particular social bonds.</p>
<p>They are generic.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is that the same brain circuits</p>
<p>that are responsible for establishing a bond</p>
<p>between parent and child</p>
<p>are actually repurposed in romantic relationships.</p>
<p>And this might not come as a surprise to many of you.</p>
<p>Many of you are probably familiar with this idea</p>
<p>of securely attached people versus anxious attached people</p>
<p>versus avoidant attached people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to touch on that a little bit.</p>
<p>But all of that has roots</p>
<p>in whether or not children and parents</p>
<p>formed healthy social bonds</p>
<p>or whether or not they had challenged social bonds.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s clear from the scientific</p>
<p>and psychological literature</p>
<p>that just because you might&rsquo;ve had a not so great</p>
<p>or even terrible social bond with a parent</p>
<p>or with some other caretaker or loved one as a child,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t fate you to have poor social bonds as an adult.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of plasticity in the system,</p>
<p>meaning it can change.</p>
<p>It can rewire in response to experience.</p>
<p>And as we will soon discover,</p>
<p>there are specific components</p>
<p>within the neural circuits of your brain</p>
<p>that are responsible for social bonding</p>
<p>that allow you to play subjective labels</p>
<p>on why you are doing certain things</p>
<p>and to rewire the neural circuits for social bonding.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to touch on all of that today.</p>
<p>But the important feature really to point out</p>
<p>is that we don&rsquo;t have 12 different circuits</p>
<p>in the brain and body for different types of social bonds.</p>
<p>We have one, and there&rsquo;s some universal features</p>
<p>that underlie all forms of social bonds.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to start by exploring</p>
<p>what those neural circuits are.</p>
<p>And then we are going to see how they plug in</p>
<p>to different types of social bonds.</p>
<p>And then we are going to explore things like introversion,</p>
<p>extroversion, where you&rsquo;re going to touch on a little bit</p>
<p>about things like trauma bonds, healthy bonds,</p>
<p>and various other aspects</p>
<p>of how humans can bond to one another.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll soon discover,</p>
<p>there is a unique chemical signature</p>
<p>of all bonding of all kinds.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to learn how to modulate</p>
<p>that chemical signature.</p>
<p>Before we talk about social bonding,</p>
<p>I want to talk about its mirror image,</p>
<p>which is lack of social bonding or social isolation.</p>
<p>Now, for better or for worse,</p>
<p>there is a tremendous literature</p>
<p>on the biology of social isolation</p>
<p>and all of the terrible things that happen</p>
<p>when animals or humans are socially isolated</p>
<p>at particular phases of life.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that are introverts,</p>
<p>you are not necessarily damaging yourself</p>
<p>by deciding to spend less time with other people.</p>
<p>Many people like time alone.</p>
<p>I personally am an introvert.</p>
<p>I get a thrill out of spending time</p>
<p>with one or two close friends,</p>
<p>but I enjoy a lot of time by myself.</p>
<p>I like to socialize,</p>
<p>so I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself an extreme introvert,</p>
<p>but I know there are some extreme introverts out there.</p>
<p>But when we talk about social isolation,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re referring to is when animals or humans</p>
<p>are restricted from having the social contacts</p>
<p>that they would prefer to have.</p>
<p>And to just briefly touch on the major takeaways</p>
<p>from this literature,</p>
<p>which spans back a hundred years or more,</p>
<p>being socially isolated is stressful.</p>
<p>And one of the hallmark features of social isolation</p>
<p>is chronically elevated stress hormones,</p>
<p>like adrenaline, also called epinephrine,</p>
<p>like cortisol, a stress hormone that at healthy levels</p>
<p>is good for combating inflammation,</p>
<p>helps us have energy early in the day,</p>
<p>focus throughout the day.</p>
<p>But if cortisol is elevated for too long,</p>
<p>which is the consequence of social isolation,</p>
<p>the immune system suffers and other chemicals</p>
<p>start to be released in the brain and body</p>
<p>that are designed to motivate the organism,</p>
<p>animal or human, to seek out social bonds.</p>
<p>An example of one such chemical</p>
<p>is a peptide called tachykinin.</p>
<p>Tachykinin is present in flies, in mice, and in humans,</p>
<p>and under conditions of social isolation,</p>
<p>its levels go up.</p>
<p>And because of the brain areas</p>
<p>that contain receptors for tachykinin,</p>
<p>people start feeling very aggressive and irritable</p>
<p>after social isolation.</p>
<p>Now that should be a little bit counterintuitive to you.</p>
<p>You would think, oh, you know,</p>
<p>if you isolate an animal or human,</p>
<p>and then you give them the opportunity</p>
<p>for social interaction, they should behave very well.</p>
<p>They should be thrilled.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re finally getting the nourishment,</p>
<p>the social nourishment that they&rsquo;ve been lacking for so long.</p>
<p>It turns out that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>Chronic social isolation changes the nature</p>
<p>of the brain and body,</p>
<p>such that it makes social connection harder,</p>
<p>and it makes the person who&rsquo;s been isolated irritable,</p>
<p>even aggressive with other people.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want to go too deeply</p>
<p>into the biology of social isolation,</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t actually afford us that much insight</p>
<p>into what healthy social bonding looks like.</p>
<p>So today, we&rsquo;re going to focus more</p>
<p>on the functional biology,</p>
<p>dual meaning of the word functional,</p>
<p>as opposed to the pathology of social isolation.</p>
<p>However, I do want to point out that social isolation</p>
<p>starts to deteriorate certain aspects</p>
<p>of brain and body pretty quickly,</p>
<p>but how quickly depends, again,</p>
<p>on how introverted or extroverted somebody is.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s socially isolated</p>
<p>for the holidays, or has been socially isolated</p>
<p>for a period of time, and is craving social contact,</p>
<p>that is a healthy craving.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll learn next,</p>
<p>the healthy craving for social contact</p>
<p>has a very specific brain circuit,</p>
<p>has a very specific neurochemical signature</p>
<p>associated with it, and has some remarkable features</p>
<p>that you can leverage in social contacts of all kinds.</p>
<p>I think some of the more important and exciting work</p>
<p>on social bonding comes from the laboratory of Kaye Tai.</p>
<p>Kaye is a professor at the Salk Institute</p>
<p>for Biological Studies.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an investigator with the Howard Hughes</p>
<p>Medical Institute.</p>
<p>And in recent years, I would say in about the last five</p>
<p>or six years, her laboratory has made</p>
<p>a fundamental discovery as to why we seek out</p>
<p>and put so much effort into social bonds.</p>
<p>And the key discovery that she made</p>
<p>is that much like hunger, much like temperature,</p>
<p>much like thirst, we have brain circuits</p>
<p>that are devoted to what&rsquo;s called a social homeostasis.</p>
<p>Many of you have probably heard about homeostasis before.</p>
<p>Homeostasis is the characteristic</p>
<p>of various biological circuits and even individual cells</p>
<p>to try and maintain a certain level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s most easily thought of in the context of hunger.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t eat for a while, your drive to pursue food</p>
<p>and think about food and make food and spend money on food</p>
<p>and indeed to enjoy food goes up.</p>
<p>Whereas when you&rsquo;re well-fed,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t tend to seek out food with as much vigor</p>
<p>or as much intensity.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t invest as much time, effort, money, et cetera.</p>
<p>So homeostasis is the aspect of cells, tissues,</p>
<p>and organisms to seek some sort of balance</p>
<p>to regulate themselves.</p>
<p>In a crude way, you can think about the thermostat</p>
<p>on your home as a homeostatic circuit.</p>
<p>When the temperature goes up a little bit,</p>
<p>it cools things down to maintain a certain temperature.</p>
<p>When the room gets cold, it hits a certain level</p>
<p>and a sensor detects that, it clicks on,</p>
<p>and then the heat goes on</p>
<p>to maintain a certain set temperature.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a simple way of thinking about homeostasis.</p>
<p>Every homeostatic circuit has three components</p>
<p>or at least three.</p>
<p>One is a detector,</p>
<p>meaning the organism or the thermostat on your wall</p>
<p>has to have some way of detecting</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in the environment, all right?</p>
<p>In the context of social bonding,</p>
<p>whether or not you are interacting with others</p>
<p>and whether or not those interactions are going well.</p>
<p>So that has to be detected, that&rsquo;s the first thing.</p>
<p>Then there has to be a control center,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the second thing.</p>
<p>And the control center is the one</p>
<p>that makes the adjustments to,</p>
<p>in the case of social bonding,</p>
<p>to your behavior and to your psychology.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll soon learn that there are ways in which</p>
<p>the more time that you spend alone,</p>
<p>the more motivated you are to seek out</p>
<p>the pictures of faces,</p>
<p>the interactions with actual people,</p>
<p>physical contact, and so forth.</p>
<p>Now that might seem obvious to you,</p>
<p>but thanks to the work of Ketai and others,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s remarkable to learn</p>
<p>that there are specific brain centers</p>
<p>that are adjusting our psychology and biology</p>
<p>so that we seek out bonds more aggressively,</p>
<p>or maybe we don&rsquo;t because we are perfectly sated</p>
<p>or satiated with respect to how much contact</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had with other people.</p>
<p>Now, the third component of this homeostatic circuit</p>
<p>is the effector.</p>
<p>The effector is actually what drives</p>
<p>the behavioral response.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what leads you to pick up your social media</p>
<p>and start scrolling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what leads you to text a friend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what leads you to call a friend or make plans</p>
<p>and what leads you to follow through on those plans.</p>
<p>So again, those three components are a detector,</p>
<p>a control center, and an effector.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>the neural circuit that controls the social homeostasis</p>
<p>actually has a fourth component.</p>
<p>And that fourth component is one</p>
<p>that places subjective understanding</p>
<p>as to why you are doing what you are doing</p>
<p>and establishes your place in a hierarchy.</p>
<p>Now, I know the word hierarchy can be a little bit</p>
<p>of a barbed wire one because people immediately</p>
<p>start thinking about boss and subordinate</p>
<p>or in couples, a leader and a follower.</p>
<p>But when we talk about social hierarchies</p>
<p>in the context of human interactions,</p>
<p>social hierarchies are very plastic,</p>
<p>meaning in one setting, one person can be the leader.</p>
<p>In another setting, the other person can be the leader.</p>
<p>You probably have groups of friends or family members</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re constantly passing the baton</p>
<p>as to who&rsquo;s going to drive,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to navigate,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to pick the restaurant,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to clear the dishes,</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s going to do certain activities and not others.</p>
<p>So hierarchies are very dynamic.</p>
<p>And as a consequence,</p>
<p>social bonding has to be very plastic and very fluid</p>
<p>so that you move from one environment to the next,</p>
<p>even with the same people,</p>
<p>you have to be able to make those adjustments.</p>
<p>And in the case of the social homeostasis circuit,</p>
<p>those adjustments are made by a particular brain structure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about on this podcast before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>It is the seat of our higher consciousness, if you will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what allows us to play subjective labels on things.</p>
<p>So we are not strictly input output.</p>
<p>We are not robotic.</p>
<p>Meaning if you go to dinner with a friend</p>
<p>and they are exceptional at choosing restaurants,</p>
<p>well, in the context of the social homeostasis circuit,</p>
<p>your prefrontal cortex would allow them</p>
<p>to pick the restaurant because basically</p>
<p>they are dominant over you in their capacity</p>
<p>to pick good restaurants, at least in this example.</p>
<p>Whereas as you leave that restaurant</p>
<p>and perhaps you are navigating</p>
<p>to where to get a drink after dinner</p>
<p>or where to walk through the city,</p>
<p>perhaps you have the better sense of direction.</p>
<p>And so then the social bonding has to be maintained</p>
<p>as you switch the hierarchy, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the role of that fourth element,</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Now, I just briefly want to touch on some of the brain areas</p>
<p>that thanks to the work of K. Tai and others,</p>
<p>we now know underlie the detection, control and response.</p>
<p>I call them the detector, control center and effector</p>
<p>because inside of that description</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just a bunch of names of neural structures.</p>
<p>There are also hints as to what the underlying</p>
<p>neurochemicals are.</p>
<p>And by understanding what the neurochemicals are,</p>
<p>you can start to think about tools that you can use</p>
<p>to form social bonds and maintain social bonds</p>
<p>in better, healthier ways.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the detector first.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that you have your senses.</p>
<p>You have your vision, you have your hearing,</p>
<p>you have touch, you have smell, you have taste.</p>
<p>Sensation, as I&rsquo;ve talked about many times before</p>
<p>on the podcast, but I&rsquo;ll just remind you,</p>
<p>sensation is the conversion of physical stimuli</p>
<p>in the environment into electrical and chemical signals</p>
<p>in your nervous system.</p>
<p>The language of the nervous system is electrical</p>
<p>and chemical signals.</p>
<p>So photons of light are converted to electrical</p>
<p>and chemical signals.</p>
<p>Pressure on the skin or light touch on the skin</p>
<p>is converted into electrical and chemical signals</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So all of that, of course,</p>
<p>is flowing into the nervous system.</p>
<p>But the detector that underlies social homeostasis</p>
<p>involves mainly two structures.</p>
<p>One is called the ACC, the anterior cingulate cortex,</p>
<p>and the other is the BLA, basolateral amygdala.</p>
<p>And when you hear the word amygdala,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably thinking fear.</p>
<p>But today, as you&rsquo;ll see,</p>
<p>the amygdala actually has many different sub-compartments</p>
<p>and components.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason why the basolateral amygdala,</p>
<p>which is associated with certain aspects</p>
<p>of aversive behaviors, meaning moving away</p>
<p>from certain types of things or interactions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason why the BLA is such an integral part</p>
<p>of the detector system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because just as it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to form healthy social bonds,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s vitally important to try and avoid</p>
<p>unhealthy social bonds.</p>
<p>And so the basolateral amygdala is mainly associated</p>
<p>with these aversive type responses</p>
<p>of just moving away from certain things.</p>
<p>The control center in the social homeostasis circuit</p>
<p>involves a brain area called the lateral hypothalamus</p>
<p>and the periventricular hypothalamus.</p>
<p>The lateral hypothalamus</p>
<p>and the periventricular hypothalamus contain neurons</p>
<p>that are able to access the hormone system</p>
<p>in order to influence the release of things like oxytocin,</p>
<p>which is a hormone neuropeptide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of part hormone, part neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a hybrid.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk a lot about oxytocin today.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got the ACC and the BLA.</p>
<p>These are areas that are mainly involved</p>
<p>in moving away from things, although also toward them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the detector.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ve got the control center,</p>
<p>which is in the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a very special and important area</p>
<p>associated with social bonding</p>
<p>that I want everyone to learn,</p>
<p>which is the dorsal raphe nucleus or DRN,</p>
<p>dorsal raphe nucleus.</p>
<p>The dorsal raphe nucleus is a small collection of neurons</p>
<p>in the midbrain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s deep in the brain.</p>
<p>And most of the time when you hear about raphe,</p>
<p>R-A-P-H-E, by the way, raphe nucleus,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about serotonin.</p>
<p>Serotonin is a neuromodulator that is often associated</p>
<p>with feelings of satiety after eating, warmth,</p>
<p>basically satisfaction with things that you already have.</p>
<p>However, within this dorsal raphe nucleus,</p>
<p>there is a small subset of neurons that release dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a neuromodulator most often associated</p>
<p>with movement, craving, motivation, and desire.</p>
<p>And the neural circuits that are rich with dopamine</p>
<p>are things like the substantia nigra,</p>
<p>the mesolimbic dopamine system, the VTA,</p>
<p>the nucleus accumbens, et cetera.</p>
<p>Those names don&rsquo;t have to mean anything to you.</p>
<p>However, this unique population of dopamine neurons</p>
<p>in the raphe is truly unique in that it&rsquo;s responsible</p>
<p>for mediating what I&rsquo;ve been calling social homeostasis.</p>
<p>It is the effector or the response</p>
<p>that mediates social homeostasis.</p>
<p>Now I haven&rsquo;t told you exactly what social homeostasis is.</p>
<p>Social homeostasis, just like hunger,</p>
<p>is the process by which when you lack social interaction,</p>
<p>you start to crave it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s very interesting about the fact</p>
<p>that there are dopamine neurons in this raphe structure</p>
<p>that is the effector for social homeostasis</p>
<p>is that what this means is that when you are not interacting</p>
<p>with people at a frequency or intensity</p>
<p>that is right for you, dopamine is released into the brain.</p>
<p>In most popular conversations about dopamine,</p>
<p>and even in scientific circles,</p>
<p>when you hear dopamine release,</p>
<p>you think about reward or feeling good</p>
<p>because indeed many behaviors</p>
<p>and drugs of abuse increase dopamine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons</p>
<p>they have so much addictive potential.</p>
<p>However, dopamine is not associated with feeling good.</p>
<p>It is actually the neurochemical that&rsquo;s responsible</p>
<p>for movement toward things that feel good.</p>
<p>So to zoom out and conceptualize what we have here,</p>
<p>we have a brain area that is a detector</p>
<p>that either will move us toward or away</p>
<p>from certain types of experiences or sensations.</p>
<p>We have a control center that is going to release</p>
<p>certain hormones and neuropeptides into our brain and blood,</p>
<p>depending on the sorts of interactions</p>
<p>that we happen to be having.</p>
<p>And we have this response system,</p>
<p>which is the dorsal raphe nucleus</p>
<p>that contains dopamine neurons.</p>
<p>And when we are not interacting with people</p>
<p>at the frequency or intensity that we crave,</p>
<p>dopamine is released,</p>
<p>and that dopamine causes us to seek out</p>
<p>social interactions of particular kinds.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what social homeostasis is</p>
<p>and how it plays out.</p>
<p>And again, let&rsquo;s use hunger as an example.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a person</p>
<p>who eats every three or four hours regularly.</p>
<p>So on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just accustomed to eating every three or four hours.</p>
<p>If just suddenly I steal your meal</p>
<p>out of the fridge at work, something I would not do,</p>
<p>but just for sake of mental experimentation,</p>
<p>that would probably cause you to go and seek out food</p>
<p>through some other route.</p>
<p>You might buy food, you&rsquo;d probably be upset first,</p>
<p>but then you go buy food or replace the food</p>
<p>that you were going to eat.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be hungry for that food.</p>
<p>And indeed, there are hormonal type mechanisms</p>
<p>and other mechanisms that when we eat regularly</p>
<p>and we predict that food is coming in,</p>
<p>we actually start secreting insulin,</p>
<p>which is for mobilizing blood sugar.</p>
<p>There are hormones in the bloodstream</p>
<p>that make us hungry on a regular clock-like schedule.</p>
<p>And you would seek out more food.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you&rsquo;re somebody who is accustomed</p>
<p>to a lot of social interaction</p>
<p>and suddenly I take away that social interaction,</p>
<p>you would feel kind of let down.</p>
<p>You would crave a replacement social interaction.</p>
<p>You might be upset that you had a lunch date with a friend,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re used to having lunch with them every Wednesday,</p>
<p>and they cancel and you would crave the interaction.</p>
<p>Okay, this is called a pro-social craving.</p>
<p>And indeed, this is what you see in animals and humans.</p>
<p>If you, what&rsquo;s called acutely isolate them,</p>
<p>which is just a fancy scientific word of saying,</p>
<p>deprive them of social interactions in a short-term basis,</p>
<p>they start engaging in pro-social behaviors.</p>
<p>They start texting other people,</p>
<p>they start seeking out social interactions</p>
<p>of different kinds.</p>
<p>And that makes perfect sense, right?</p>
<p>But thought of from a different side,</p>
<p>you could also imagine how, well,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting a social interaction with somebody</p>
<p>on a daily or weekly basis,</p>
<p>and suddenly you remove that interaction,</p>
<p>well, then people might not care.</p>
<p>They might just think, well, I&rsquo;ll get the interaction</p>
<p>tomorrow or the next day or the next day,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re sated,</p>
<p>much in the same way that the person who eats very regularly</p>
<p>might say, well, I ate four hours ago</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll eat eight hours later, no big deal.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what happens.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a prediction that we are going to have</p>
<p>certain types of interactions.</p>
<p>And when those interactions don&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>we replace that lack of interaction with a drive</p>
<p>and a motivation to seek out social interaction.</p>
<p>And that drive and motivation is caused by,</p>
<p>or I should say is driven by dopamine release</p>
<p>from that dorsal raphe.</p>
<p>And so the takeaway is that when we lack social interaction</p>
<p>that we expect, we become pro-social.</p>
<p>However, if we are chronically socially isolated,</p>
<p>meaning we don&rsquo;t have interactions with people</p>
<p>for a long time, we become actually more introverted.</p>
<p>This is separate from all of the tacky kind and stuff</p>
<p>that I talked about earlier,</p>
<p>or falling into states of chronic stress,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s well-established now that in humans and in animals,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t give them enough social interaction,</p>
<p>they actually become antisocial.</p>
<p>And so this is actually a little bit like what one might see</p>
<p>with long-term fasting, okay?</p>
<p>I gave the example of eating every four hours.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s give the parallel example of somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been fasting perhaps for two or three days.</p>
<p>If they are expecting to eat</p>
<p>and then the meal doesn&rsquo;t arrive,</p>
<p>they are not necessarily going to immediately</p>
<p>try and seek out food.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a little bit counterintuitive.</p>
<p>You would have thought,</p>
<p>well, they haven&rsquo;t eaten in a very long time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be very motivated to seek out food,</p>
<p>but no, they are accustomed to fasting.</p>
<p>Similarly, the social homeostasis circuit works in a way</p>
<p>such that when we don&rsquo;t have social interactions</p>
<p>for a very long time, we start to lose our craving</p>
<p>for social interactions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the social homeostasis circuit</p>
<p>through the lens of what&rsquo;s commonly called introversion</p>
<p>and extroversion.</p>
<p>Now, typically when we hear about introverts,</p>
<p>we think about the quiet person at the party</p>
<p>or the person that doesn&rsquo;t want to go out at all.</p>
<p>And we think about an extrovert as somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s really social, the so-called social butterfly,</p>
<p>who enjoys social interactions, is really chatty,</p>
<p>is kind of life of the party type person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the cliche or the kind of pop psychology cliche.</p>
<p>But actually in the psychology literature,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not really the way it holds up.</p>
<p>Many people who appear introverted are actually extroverted.</p>
<p>The quiet person at a party could be an extrovert,</p>
<p>except that they just don&rsquo;t talk very much.</p>
<p>The characteristic of an extrovert is somebody</p>
<p>that gets energy or feels good from social interactions.</p>
<p>They sort of get a lift.</p>
<p>And we can predict that that lift occurs</p>
<p>because of some release of dopamine</p>
<p>within their brain and body.</p>
<p>And indeed there&rsquo;s evidence for that.</p>
<p>Neuroimaging studies support that.</p>
<p>Other forms of neurobiological analysis</p>
<p>support that as well.</p>
<p>We can also imagine that the person who&rsquo;s talking a lot</p>
<p>is somebody who&rsquo;s very extroverted.</p>
<p>But oftentimes people who talk a lot for their work</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s very social</p>
<p>when you interact with them,</p>
<p>that person gets back to their car</p>
<p>and is absolutely depleted and exhausted</p>
<p>by that interaction or also sorts of social interactions.</p>
<p>So we really can&rsquo;t predict whether or not somebody</p>
<p>is an introvert or an extrovert</p>
<p>simply based on their behavior.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really more of an internal subjective label.</p>
<p>However, if we look at introversion and extroversion</p>
<p>through this lens of the social homeostatic set point,</p>
<p>and we think about dopamine as this molecule</p>
<p>that drives motivation to seek out social interactions,</p>
<p>what we can reasonably assume is that introverts are people</p>
<p>that when they engage in certain forms</p>
<p>of social interaction,</p>
<p>either the amount of dopamine that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>is greater than it is in an extrovert.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, I said greater than it is in an extrovert.</p>
<p>And so they actually feel quite motivated</p>
<p>but also satisfied by very brief</p>
<p>or we could say sort of sparse social interactions.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need a lot of social engagement to feel sated.</p>
<p>Again, the parallel example would be hunger.</p>
<p>This would be somebody who doesn&rsquo;t need to eat much</p>
<p>in order to feel satisfied.</p>
<p>Whereas the extrovert, we can reasonably assume</p>
<p>releases less dopamine</p>
<p>in response to an individual social interaction.</p>
<p>And so they need much more social interaction</p>
<p>in order to feel filled up by that interaction.</p>
<p>And indeed this is supported</p>
<p>by the neurobiological imaging studies.</p>
<p>So rather than think about introverts and extroverts</p>
<p>as chatty versus quiet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s useful to think about people, maybe yourself,</p>
<p>maybe other people you know,</p>
<p>as how much social interaction they need</p>
<p>in order to bring this social homeostasis into balance.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s the fourth component</p>
<p>of this social homeostasis circuit that I mentioned before.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is involved in thinking</p>
<p>and planning and action.</p>
<p>And it has extensive connections</p>
<p>with areas of the brain like the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which is responsible for a lot of motivated drives.</p>
<p>It also has connections</p>
<p>with the various reward centers of the brain.</p>
<p>And it can act as kind of an accelerator,</p>
<p>meaning it can encourage more electrical activity</p>
<p>of other brain centers</p>
<p>or as a break on those brain centers.</p>
<p>Really good example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a trivial one</p>
<p>in the context of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a concrete one.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll use it would be,</p>
<p>I know many people out there use cold showers</p>
<p>as a way to stimulate metabolism</p>
<p>and build up resilience and this sort of thing.</p>
<p>If you get into a very cold shower</p>
<p>and you feel as if you want to get out,</p>
<p>but you force yourself to stay in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re forcing yourself to stay in</p>
<p>because your prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is placing some subjective label on that experience.</p>
<p>Either you&rsquo;re doing it for a certain benefit</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve got a timer</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re using the timer as the regulator</p>
<p>of how long you&rsquo;re going to stay in.</p>
<p>Basically you&rsquo;re overriding reflexes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the main function of the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex components</p>
<p>that wire into the social homeostasis circuit</p>
<p>are responsible for evaluating</p>
<p>where you are in a given hierarchy.</p>
<p>And that affords you a ton of flexibility</p>
<p>in terms of the types of social interactions</p>
<p>that you can engage in</p>
<p>and whether or not you&rsquo;re going to spend time</p>
<p>with certain people or not.</p>
<p>Whether or not you&rsquo;re going to engage and then disengage.</p>
<p>What do I mean by this?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re an extroverted person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re somebody that likes a lot of social interaction</p>
<p>and you get a lot of dopamine release on whole</p>
<p>from a lot of social interactions.</p>
<p>So maybe one interaction with a teller at the supermarket</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t really going to give you much dopamine,</p>
<p>but going to a party will give you more dopamine.</p>
<p>And so you seek out these larger social interactions.</p>
<p>However, you might go to a party</p>
<p>where somebody says something</p>
<p>or you see somebody there that you&rsquo;d much prefer not to see.</p>
<p>And therefore you decide to leave.</p>
<p>The deciding to leave is regulated</p>
<p>by that prefrontal cortex component.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>that just because there&rsquo;s a homeostatic circuit</p>
<p>that involves areas like the amygdala and the hypothalamus</p>
<p>and these deep brain regions like the dorsal rafae,</p>
<p>as a human being,</p>
<p>you have flexibility over your social interactions.</p>
<p>And that flexibility arise from those prefrontal circuits.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a ton of subjective nature to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of context to it.</p>
<p>So while there are some predictable elements</p>
<p>of these circuits,</p>
<p>they are not simply what we would call plug and chug.</p>
<p>You have flexibility.</p>
<p>You are able to say, you know, I love parties,</p>
<p>but I really don&rsquo;t want to go to that party</p>
<p>because so-and-so is there.</p>
<p>Or I very much don&rsquo;t like going across town in traffic,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to do it today</p>
<p>because a certain collection of people</p>
<p>or perhaps a certain individual</p>
<p>will be at that particular party.</p>
<p>And so the prefrontal cortex again</p>
<p>is what allows you that subjective ruling</p>
<p>or ruling over what would otherwise just be reflexes.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to drill a little bit deeper</p>
<p>into this incredible neural structure</p>
<p>that is the dorsal raphe nucleus</p>
<p>and this small collection of neurons,</p>
<p>the dopamine neurons of the dorsal raphe.</p>
<p>Because while it&rsquo;s a small collection,</p>
<p>they are very powerful.</p>
<p>Loneliness has been defined by the great psychologist,</p>
<p>John Cacioppo, as the distress that results</p>
<p>from discrepancies between ideal</p>
<p>and perceived social relationships.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that.</p>
<p>Loneliness is not just being isolated.</p>
<p>Loneliness, as he defines it,</p>
<p>is the distress that results from discrepancies</p>
<p>between ideal and perceived social relationships.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when we expect things to be one way</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually another way.</p>
<p>And which way we expect them to be</p>
<p>and which way they turn out, again, is highly subjective.</p>
<p>What you expect from friendships</p>
<p>and what other people expect from friendships</p>
<p>could be entirely different.</p>
<p>But the circuit that underlies friendship bonding</p>
<p>is exactly the same.</p>
<p>And it is this dorsal raphe nucleus</p>
<p>and the dopamine neurons in that nucleus</p>
<p>that underlie the bond that is social friendship</p>
<p>and all types of social bonds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a key finding in the literature.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is</p>
<p>Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Neurons Represent</p>
<p>the Experience of Social Isolation.</p>
<p>This is a paper from K. Tai&rsquo;s lab.</p>
<p>The first author is Matthews,</p>
<p>Jillian Matthews, to be specific.</p>
<p>What they did is they were able to selectively activate</p>
<p>the dopamine neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus.</p>
<p>And when they did that,</p>
<p>they induced a loneliness-like state.</p>
<p>Now, how did they know it was a loneliness-like state?</p>
<p>They knew because it motivated</p>
<p>the seeking out of social connections.</p>
<p>This is the kind of social hunger</p>
<p>that I was referring to before.</p>
<p>Whereas when the dopamine neurons of the dorsal raphe</p>
<p>are inhibited, meaning their activity is quieted,</p>
<p>that suppressed a loneliness state.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little counterintuitive, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a group of neurons that when activated</p>
<p>makes you feel lonely.</p>
<p>And when this brain area is not activated,</p>
<p>it suppresses loneliness.</p>
<p>But if you think about it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly the kind of circuit that you would want</p>
<p>in order to drive social behavior.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re feeling lonely, dopamine is released</p>
<p>and it causes you to go out and seek social interactions.</p>
<p>When this brain area has enough social interactions,</p>
<p>and sort of a figure of speech,</p>
<p>brain areas don&rsquo;t have enough social interactions,</p>
<p>but when enough social interactions have happened,</p>
<p>that the neurons in this brain area</p>
<p>shut down their production of dopamine,</p>
<p>well, the loneliness state turns off.</p>
<p>So what we think of as loneliness</p>
<p>as this big kind of dark cloud</p>
<p>or fog in our psychological landscape</p>
<p>boils down to a very small set of neurons</p>
<p>releasing a specific neurochemical for motivation.</p>
<p>And to me, this really changes the way</p>
<p>that we think about loneliness</p>
<p>and that we think about social interactions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much subjective landscape</p>
<p>to loneliness and to social interactions.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>what it really is is that we are all social animals</p>
<p>to some extent or another.</p>
<p>And we all crave social interactions</p>
<p>to some extent or another,</p>
<p>although the extent will vary</p>
<p>depending on where you are</p>
<p>in the introversion, extroversion continuum.</p>
<p>And it is indeed a continuum.</p>
<p>Now, the other aspect of the study</p>
<p>that was really important</p>
<p>gets back to that issue of hierarchy and social rank.</p>
<p>What they found is that depending on</p>
<p>where you see yourself in the social rank,</p>
<p>the dopamine neurons in the RAFE</p>
<p>will lead to one consequence or another,</p>
<p>meaning moving toward social interactions</p>
<p>or moving away from them.</p>
<p>So the whole system is set up</p>
<p>so that you have a ton of flexibility</p>
<p>and control over social interactions.</p>
<p>So just a couple of key points</p>
<p>and actionable takeaways</p>
<p>based on the information I&rsquo;ve offered up until now.</p>
<p>If you think of yourself as an introvert,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that you get a lot of dopamine</p>
<p>from a few or minimal social interactions.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re an extrovert,</p>
<p>contrary to what you might think,</p>
<p>social interactions are not going to flood your system</p>
<p>with dopamine.</p>
<p>They actually are going to lead to less dopamine release</p>
<p>than it would for an introvert.</p>
<p>And therefore you&rsquo;re going to need</p>
<p>a lot more social interactions</p>
<p>in order to feel filled up by those interactions.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve been drawing a lot of parallels</p>
<p>between this social seeking</p>
<p>or avoiding social isolation and hunger,</p>
<p>but is that really the case?</p>
<p>And could it be that there are actually interactions</p>
<p>between the different drives?</p>
<p>Meaning, could social isolation</p>
<p>or the desire to seek out social interactions</p>
<p>actually relate to the hunger system and vice versa?</p>
<p>And indeed the answer is yes.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have 50 different homeostatic systems</p>
<p>and 50 different neurochemicals</p>
<p>to underlie our drive to eat,</p>
<p>our drive for romantic interactions,</p>
<p>our drive for friendship interactions.</p>
<p>We have essentially one, maybe two,</p>
<p>and they all funnel into the same dopamine system.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a beautiful paper</p>
<p>that illustrates some of the crossover</p>
<p>between these different homeostatic drives.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>Acute Social Isolation Evokes Mid-Brain Craving Responses</p>
<p>Similar to Hunger.</p>
<p>This is from Rebecca Saxe&rsquo;s lab at MIT,</p>
<p>Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Dr. K. Tai is also an author on this paper.</p>
<p>The paper was published in Nature Neuroscience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really terrific paper.</p>
<p>Just to briefly summarize what they did,</p>
<p>they took people that were categorized</p>
<p>as socially connected, healthy human adults.</p>
<p>So these are people that are used</p>
<p>to pretty frequent social interactions.</p>
<p>And they socially isolated them for about 10 hours.</p>
<p>And they had no opportunity to access social media,</p>
<p>email, fiction reading even,</p>
<p>and certainly didn&rsquo;t have the opportunity</p>
<p>to interact with people face-to-face.</p>
<p>So what this did is it increased social craving,</p>
<p>both subjectively, the people said</p>
<p>that they were now craving social interactions.</p>
<p>And then they did brain imaging</p>
<p>in response to images of people,</p>
<p>people interacting, food, flowers,</p>
<p>other types of stimuli.</p>
<p>Some of the stimuli or these images,</p>
<p>we call them stimuli, but they&rsquo;re images really,</p>
<p>had a lot of social engagement going on in them.</p>
<p>Others did not.</p>
<p>Some had a lot of faces showing, others did not.</p>
<p>And as you might suspect,</p>
<p>there was activation of many of the brain areas</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about earlier,</p>
<p>dorsal raphe nucleus and other brain areas</p>
<p>associated with dopaminergic neurons.</p>
<p>When the socially isolated people viewed social cues,</p>
<p>people interacting, faces, and so on,</p>
<p>and less so for things like flowers.</p>
<p>However, they also had increased responses</p>
<p>to images of food, which is interesting,</p>
<p>and actually is consistent with the literature</p>
<p>that when people are socially isolated,</p>
<p>they often will start eating more,</p>
<p>or they will change the nature of the foods that they eat.</p>
<p>Now, we think of that as comfort foods</p>
<p>or soothing oneself through eating</p>
<p>rather than social interaction as a kind of pathology.</p>
<p>But while it might not be healthy,</p>
<p>depending on the context and the person,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really important to understand</p>
<p>that the reason that happens</p>
<p>is because we have a common circuit</p>
<p>and that the system, meaning the person,</p>
<p>is actually craving dopamine release.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t consciously know this.</p>
<p>This is all subconsciously carried out,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re craving dopamine release.</p>
<p>And if they can&rsquo;t get it from social interactions</p>
<p>as they normally would, they&rsquo;ll start seeking it from food.</p>
<p>Now, they did an important reverse experiment as well,</p>
<p>where they had subjects go on 10 hours of food fasting.</p>
<p>Now, these were not people that were familiar with fasting.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t doing intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>They were eating more typical meal schedules.</p>
<p>And so that created increased hunger, et cetera,</p>
<p>but it also increased their appetite, if you will,</p>
<p>for social interactions.</p>
<p>And so the important point here</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a common biology,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a common circuitry</p>
<p>that underlies homeostatic craving of things</p>
<p>that maintain us as individuals and as a species.</p>
<p>And it really places social interactions</p>
<p>as right up there in the list of things</p>
<p>that we could consider so vital for our survival</p>
<p>and for our health.</p>
<p>Things like food, water, social interactions</p>
<p>are really sit within a top tier amongst each other.</p>
<p>And they use the same common circuitry,</p>
<p>dorsal raphe dopamine neurons,</p>
<p>in addition to other structures</p>
<p>in order to create this drive</p>
<p>to seek out certain types of stimuli.</p>
<p>Now, this is a very reductionist view of social bonding.</p>
<p>I realize that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important to realize</p>
<p>that while we place all this subjective context,</p>
<p>oh, I miss this person,</p>
<p>or I really would like to avoid that person.</p>
<p>At the end of the day,</p>
<p>it really all funnels into a system</p>
<p>whereby a single neurochemical</p>
<p>is either being released and motivating us</p>
<p>to seek out more of a particular type of interaction</p>
<p>or is not released.</p>
<p>And therefore we are perfectly comfortable</p>
<p>staying exactly where we are.</p>
<p>As I say this, some of you are probably thinking,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s probably what happens when you fall in love.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>When people enter romantic relationships</p>
<p>that to them are very satisfying,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this period that the theory is</p>
<p>that it lasts anywhere from six days to six months.</p>
<p>Although some people report</p>
<p>that this feeling can last many, many years, even decades,</p>
<p>of just feeling completely filled up and sated</p>
<p>by the experience of being with that person.</p>
<p>So much so that cravings for food are reduced,</p>
<p>cravings for sleep are reduced.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s all sorts of activities</p>
<p>and things that go along with new romantic partnerships</p>
<p>that take up time that might get in the way</p>
<p>of things like sleep or things like food.</p>
<p>But the point is that dopamine is the final common pathway</p>
<p>by which we seek out things and we end up feeling</p>
<p>as if we are satisfied by certain types of interactions.</p>
<p>Now, similarly, if you&rsquo;ve ever been isolated</p>
<p>for a long period of time,</p>
<p>your focus might&rsquo;ve shifted to what you&rsquo;re going to eat,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to cook for dinner</p>
<p>in a much more heightened way.</p>
<p>The importance of those sensory stimuli</p>
<p>and those types of interactions,</p>
<p>and indeed the taste of food itself expands.</p>
<p>So normally when we are in social relationships</p>
<p>that are ones that are familiar to us,</p>
<p>we have a balance of these different drives.</p>
<p>But when one particular drive takes over</p>
<p>and we are very focused on it,</p>
<p>because they all funnel into the same circuitry,</p>
<p>there really isn&rsquo;t the seeking out</p>
<p>of certain types of behaviors like food seeking</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re newly in love.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that food won&rsquo;t taste good to us</p>
<p>and indeed there are experiments that have been done</p>
<p>where if people have just fallen in love,</p>
<p>the taste of a strawberry can just be incredible.</p>
<p>The other effect of dopamine is that it changes</p>
<p>the way that we interpret sensory stimuli.</p>
<p>Our detectors actually change when we are in heightened</p>
<p>states of dopaminergic activity or drive.</p>
<p>Basically what this means is that things seem better</p>
<p>than they would when we have less dopamine in our system.</p>
<p>The point here is that there&rsquo;s a lot of crossover.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of meshing together</p>
<p>of different homeostatic drives,</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t exist in separate channels.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only under conditions in which</p>
<p>one particular homeostatic drive</p>
<p>is kind of being played out to the extreme,</p>
<p>such as the example of falling in love,</p>
<p>that we tend to avoid or sort of overlook</p>
<p>the other homeostatic drives.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because simply we&rsquo;re getting enough dopamine</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need anymore.</p>
<p>Up until now, I&rsquo;ve been focused on the organizational logic</p>
<p>of social bonding, which is really just nerd speak</p>
<p>for how is it that we form bonds, avoid bonds?</p>
<p>Why do people seek out more or fewer bonds</p>
<p>than others, et cetera?</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to shift gears a bit and focus on</p>
<p>what are some things that we can do to encourage</p>
<p>the formation of healthy bonds?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful study that was published in Cell Reports,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Conscious Processing of Narrative Stimuli</p>
<p>Synchronizes Heart Rate Between Individuals.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I mentioned this on a previous podcast,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to mention it again</p>
<p>and go into a little bit more depth</p>
<p>because it points to specific actionable items</p>
<p>that we can all use in order to enhance the quality</p>
<p>and depth of social bonds of all kinds.</p>
<p>Now, this study involved a very simple type of experiment.</p>
<p>They had people listen to a story.</p>
<p>Everybody in the study listened to the same story,</p>
<p>but they listened to that story at different times</p>
<p>and indeed in different locations.</p>
<p>So different people, same story.</p>
<p>And they measured things like heart rate,</p>
<p>they measured breathing, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, what was the motivation for doing this?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a long standing literature</p>
<p>showing that our physiology,</p>
<p>things like our heart rate, our breathing,</p>
<p>our skin conductance, meaning the amount of sweating,</p>
<p>can be synchronized between individuals.</p>
<p>And that synchronization can occur</p>
<p>according to a variety of different things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been studies that have people look at one another</p>
<p>and they look and actually see that their pupil size</p>
<p>of their eyes starts to synchronize.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s breathing can synchronize.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s body temperatures can even start to synchronize</p>
<p>or at least shifts in body temperature can synchronize.</p>
<p>One person gets cooler, the other person gets cooler.</p>
<p>A lot of this is subconscious.</p>
<p>Some of it can be detected by conscious cues</p>
<p>like flushing of the skin</p>
<p>or actually seeing someone&rsquo;s pupils change.</p>
<p>But actually the pupil reflex is a really good example</p>
<p>whereby except for rare cases</p>
<p>and certain highly trained individuals,</p>
<p>most people can&rsquo;t control their pupil reflexes</p>
<p>in a very deliberate way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly a reflex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an autonomic reflex.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of literature showing</p>
<p>that within small groups or two people,</p>
<p>these physiological signals can be synchronized.</p>
<p>What this study found was that when people listen</p>
<p>to the same story, but at different times,</p>
<p>their heart rates start to synchronize.</p>
<p>This is incredible because people are listening</p>
<p>to the story at different times,</p>
<p>but the gaps between their heartbeats</p>
<p>become very stereotyped</p>
<p>and map almost precisely onto one another.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Now, we also know from an extensive literature</p>
<p>that the quality and perceived depth</p>
<p>of a social bond correlates very strongly</p>
<p>with how much physiological synchronization there is</p>
<p>between individuals.</p>
<p>In other words, when your bodies feel the same,</p>
<p>you tend to feel more bonded to somebody else.</p>
<p>And so this whole thing is a rather circular argument.</p>
<p>When you feel closer to somebody else,</p>
<p>your physiology synchronize.</p>
<p>And the reverse is true as well.</p>
<p>When your physiologies are synchronized,</p>
<p>you feel closer to other people.</p>
<p>This is what I call the concert phenomenon.</p>
<p>If you ever go to see your favorite band</p>
<p>or you go to a concert that you particularly love,</p>
<p>you will often look over at somebody</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see them enjoying the same thing.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re often in a similar state as you are.</p>
<p>Maybe the sort of like favorite song comes on</p>
<p>and you actually feel connected to that person.</p>
<p>You feel like you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>obviously there&rsquo;s a shared experience,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a shared physiological response</p>
<p>to that experience.</p>
<p>And so this can happen in mass with large groups of people,</p>
<p>or it can happen just between two individuals.</p>
<p>And as the study points out,</p>
<p>it can actually happen between individuals</p>
<p>without them actually interacting with one another</p>
<p>when the story they are listening to is the anchor</p>
<p>or the driver of their physiology.</p>
<p>This really points to the fact that the body</p>
<p>and the brain are reciprocally connected.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, what we think, what we hear, what we feel</p>
<p>drives our physiology, our heartbeat,</p>
<p>our respiration, et cetera.</p>
<p>But our heartbeat and respiration</p>
<p>also are influencing our state of mind.</p>
<p>And in this case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s encouraging certain types of social bonds</p>
<p>when our heart rates are synchronized.</p>
<p>You can leverage this.</p>
<p>How can you leverage this?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s take a upcoming example of the holidays.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sort of a joke.</p>
<p>I think it was Ram Dass, sort of Buddhist philosopher type</p>
<p>that said, if you think you&rsquo;re enlightened,</p>
<p>go visit your parents.</p>
<p>And I think what he was referring to is that some people,</p>
<p>not all people have challenging relationships</p>
<p>with their parents.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about child-parent attachment</p>
<p>and interactions in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but some people have a wonderful relationship</p>
<p>to both their parents and more power to them.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>We should all be so lucky.</p>
<p>Many people have challenged relationships</p>
<p>with their parents,</p>
<p>or they have a great relationship with their parents,</p>
<p>but their parents know,</p>
<p>or they know how to drive that dart</p>
<p>right into that particular soft piece</p>
<p>of psychological flesh by saying just the slightest thing,</p>
<p>or even by raising their eyebrow or rolling their eyes</p>
<p>or the tone in which they do something.</p>
<p>This is also true between siblings.</p>
<p>I think many of you can think of examples</p>
<p>where this is true.</p>
<p>Many people, when they interact with others,</p>
<p>expect that the mere interaction with the other person</p>
<p>is going to create the sense of bonding.</p>
<p>And often that is the case.</p>
<p>For instance, if people are involved in intimate disclosure,</p>
<p>if people enjoy each other&rsquo;s company so much</p>
<p>that just the mere sight of somebody evokes great feelings</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s mutual, that often can happen.</p>
<p>But in many types of social interactions,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the direct interaction with that person</p>
<p>that makes us feel close to them,</p>
<p>but rather it&rsquo;s shared experience.</p>
<p>And shared experience is shared physiology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point I&rsquo;m trying to make by way of this study</p>
<p>about conscious processing of narrative stimuli</p>
<p>synchronizes heart rate of different individuals.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you have a somewhat challenged</p>
<p>or a somewhat, let&rsquo;s call it a slight friction</p>
<p>in getting close with somebody,</p>
<p>or it can be a challenging interaction,</p>
<p>oftentimes it&rsquo;s very useful to focus outward</p>
<p>on some other common narrative, a movie.</p>
<p>Oftentimes people will watch a game together.</p>
<p>Actually, there&rsquo;s a lot of critique</p>
<p>that people or families will focus outward too much</p>
<p>on external events.</p>
<p>But these external events can be observing the grandchild</p>
<p>and how wonderful they are,</p>
<p>or observing the meal and how wonderful it is.</p>
<p>Or as we commonly see in various traditions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a story that&rsquo;s repeated each year.</p>
<p>Certainly in the upcoming holidays,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Christmas stories, there are themes and traditions.</p>
<p>And those themes and traditions anchor</p>
<p>a number of different aspects of our psychology.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really wonderful.</p>
<p>They thread through the ages really,</p>
<p>and allow us to link our own experiences</p>
<p>up with previous generations and experiences.</p>
<p>But in addition to that, they synchronize our physiologies.</p>
<p>And so sometimes it can be useful</p>
<p>rather than expecting others to shift our physiology</p>
<p>in the way that we wish,</p>
<p>or us shifting their physiologies in the way that we wish,</p>
<p>and then expecting some bond to mushroom out of that</p>
<p>in some beautiful way,</p>
<p>to focus on some external stimulus,</p>
<p>to focus on something that will synchronize</p>
<p>the physiologies of both people.</p>
<p>That can act as a bridge</p>
<p>in order to establish social bonds.</p>
<p>And this is not a hack or a workaround</p>
<p>for making terrible relationships good.</p>
<p>This is actually at the seat of what we come away</p>
<p>from a social interaction with as feeling,</p>
<p>wow, that was a really wonderful time.</p>
<p>Often a really wonderful time can be by virtue</p>
<p>of the specific things that were said,</p>
<p>or the specific things that one engaged in.</p>
<p>But more often than not,</p>
<p>the final common pathway we should say,</p>
<p>of great experiences was a great physiological experience</p>
<p>and a shared physiological experience.</p>
<p>I have a short anecdote that relates to this.</p>
<p>I have an older sibling,</p>
<p>and she used to say that when she was in college,</p>
<p>the best dates that she ever went on</p>
<p>were dates where she was asked to go out</p>
<p>and listen to music.</p>
<p>She pointed out, however,</p>
<p>that oftentimes the guys that would ask her out</p>
<p>would take her to jazz clubs.</p>
<p>She always had the theory</p>
<p>that they would ask her to jazz clubs</p>
<p>because at jazz clubs, typically you would sit down</p>
<p>and then she had to conclude that they couldn&rsquo;t dance.</p>
<p>My sister likes to dance.</p>
<p>And so anytime someone actually had the nerve</p>
<p>to take her dancing,</p>
<p>those turned out to be particularly,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say satisfying dates and relationships.</p>
<p>At least they lasted longer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I know about them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I want to know about them.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s my sister after all.</p>
<p>But the theory behind whoever was asking her out</p>
<p>on these dates was the right one,</p>
<p>which is that if you want to bond with somebody,</p>
<p>you create a common physiological response</p>
<p>through a common and shared experience.</p>
<p>And that is often a good entryway</p>
<p>into establishing whether or not, it&rsquo;s always a question,</p>
<p>whether or not there can be common physiological experience</p>
<p>between two individuals.</p>
<p>Up until now, we&rsquo;ve been talking about social bonding</p>
<p>through the lens of neural circuits</p>
<p>that are already established.</p>
<p>However, early in the episode,</p>
<p>I mentioned that these very neural circuits</p>
<p>that are responsible for social bonding</p>
<p>in adult forms of attachment,</p>
<p>be it romantic or friendship or otherwise,</p>
<p>are actually established during development.</p>
<p>One of the more important and I think exciting areas</p>
<p>of early attachment as it relates to adult attachment</p>
<p>comes to us from the work of Alan Shor.</p>
<p>Alan Shor spelled A-L-L-A-N, Shor, S-C-H-O-R-E,</p>
<p>is a psychoanalyst who also has deep understanding</p>
<p>of neurobiology of attachment,</p>
<p>both in childhood and in adulthood.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s focused a lot on differences</p>
<p>between right brain and left brain forms of attachment.</p>
<p>Now, in a early episode of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>I touched into the fact that most of what&rsquo;s discussed</p>
<p>in the general public and sort of pop psychology</p>
<p>and even in some neurobiology courses</p>
<p>about right brain versus left brain</p>
<p>and one side of the brain being more emotional</p>
<p>and the other side being more rational</p>
<p>is completely wrong, okay?</p>
<p>Most of what I see out there is actually backwards</p>
<p>to the way things actually work.</p>
<p>And while there is some,</p>
<p>what we call lateralization of function,</p>
<p>meaning certain brain functions are handled by neurons</p>
<p>on one side of the brain or the other,</p>
<p>the idea that one side of your brain is emotional</p>
<p>and the other side of your brain is rational</p>
<p>is just simply not true.</p>
<p>However, the work of Alan Shor</p>
<p>points to some very concrete neural circuits</p>
<p>that do have a lateralization bias,</p>
<p>meaning they are more right brain than left brain</p>
<p>or more left brain than right brain,</p>
<p>that underlie certain forms of attachment</p>
<p>between child and parent, in particular, child and mother,</p>
<p>and that these right brain isms, if you will,</p>
<p>and left brain isms for attachment</p>
<p>get played out again and again</p>
<p>in our forms of attachment as adults.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to talk about that work briefly now</p>
<p>because I think it really points</p>
<p>to a number of important features of how we establish bonds</p>
<p>and the different routes to establishing bonds.</p>
<p>So within the field of psychoanalysis,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a longstanding discussion, of course,</p>
<p>about the so-called unconscious or subconscious,</p>
<p>the things that we are not aware of.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s growing evidence pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that at least one major component of the subconscious</p>
<p>or the unconscious is the so-called autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>The autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>is the portion of our nervous system</p>
<p>that controls our reflexive breathing, our heart rate,</p>
<p>our skin conductance, meaning our sweating, pupil size.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the aspect of our nervous system</p>
<p>that makes us more alert or more calm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the so-called sympathetic,</p>
<p>meaning for alertness or parasympathetic branch</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>parasympathetic for more calming responses.</p>
<p>Now, what Dr. Shore&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>and the work of others is now showing</p>
<p>is that early infant parent,</p>
<p>in particular infant mother attachment,</p>
<p>involves a coordination or a synchronization</p>
<p>of these right brain circuits and these left brain circuits</p>
<p>as they relate, excuse me, to the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>How does this play out?</p>
<p>Well, it plays out where early on as an infant,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re born, you&rsquo;re truly helpless.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t feed yourself.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t warm yourself.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t change yourself.</p>
<p>And you certainly can&rsquo;t ambulate,</p>
<p>walk anywhere to get the things that you need.</p>
<p>All of those functions,</p>
<p>all of those needs rather,</p>
<p>are met by your primary caretaker.</p>
<p>Typically that&rsquo;s the mother.</p>
<p>Fathers, of course, play a role also,</p>
<p>but because of breastfeeding or even bottle feeding,</p>
<p>typically mothers play a more prominent role.</p>
<p>I realize there are exceptions, but that&rsquo;s the general rule.</p>
<p>There are now brain imaging studies</p>
<p>examining the brains of infants</p>
<p>and the brains of mothers as they interact</p>
<p>and showing that the physical contact between the two,</p>
<p>the breathing of the mother and child,</p>
<p>the heart rate of the mother and child,</p>
<p>and indeed the pupil size of the mother and child</p>
<p>are actually actively getting coordinated.</p>
<p>In other words, the mother is regulating</p>
<p>the infant&rsquo;s autonomic nervous system, primarily,</p>
<p>and the infant is also regulating</p>
<p>the mother&rsquo;s autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>A small coo from a baby or a cry,</p>
<p>which is a stress cry from a baby,</p>
<p>will definitely regulate the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>of the mother.</p>
<p>This whole right brain system</p>
<p>is directly tapped into the so-called oxytocin system.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk more about oxytocin in a moment.</p>
<p>Oxytocin, again, being this peptide hormone</p>
<p>that is involved in social bonds of all kinds,</p>
<p>but that at least in early childhood</p>
<p>is very closely associated with milk letdown</p>
<p>and milk production.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a lot of stimulation</p>
<p>of oxytocin release in the mother by nursing itself.</p>
<p>So physical contact with the nipple</p>
<p>and by the contact of skin between baby and mother,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s specificity there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just any baby that can evoke</p>
<p>the most amount of oxytocin release from the mother.</p>
<p>However, there are examples where just holding a child</p>
<p>will evoke oxytocin release in the non-parent</p>
<p>or somebody other than the parent.</p>
<p>I think most people experience that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the new puppy or new baby phenomenon</p>
<p>because indeed puppies can evoke oxytocin release as well.</p>
<p>The point is not that oxytocin is only released</p>
<p>in response to the primary relationship</p>
<p>or the mother and their child,</p>
<p>but rather that the amount of oxytocin</p>
<p>scales with how closely related one is</p>
<p>to that particular child and vice versa.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s oxytocin release occurring</p>
<p>in both the child and the mother.</p>
<p>So this right brain system</p>
<p>is an emotional but autonomic system.</p>
<p>It is below our conscious detection.</p>
<p>Now, as we get older,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another system that starts to come into play</p>
<p>in parent-child interactions,</p>
<p>and this also comes into play in sibling interactions</p>
<p>and so forth, and that&rsquo;s the left brain system</p>
<p>as described by Alan Shore.</p>
<p>Now, again, this isn&rsquo;t about emotion versus rationality.</p>
<p>This is about autonomic</p>
<p>versus more conscious forms of bonding.</p>
<p>So on the left brain circuit side,</p>
<p>there is evidence for, based on neuroimaging studies,</p>
<p>but also animal studies to support the idea</p>
<p>that on the left brain side of things,</p>
<p>there is a processing more of narratives</p>
<p>that are very concrete, logical narratives, okay?</p>
<p>And again, I have to zoom out</p>
<p>and just really tamp down the idea</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not that one side of the brain is emotional</p>
<p>and the other side is rational,</p>
<p>but rather that these two things are happening in parallel,</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s a bit of a dominance</p>
<p>for the left brain circuitry</p>
<p>to be involved in the kinds of bonding</p>
<p>that are associated with prediction and reward.</p>
<p>So a good example would be reading to a child every night,</p>
<p>sitting there and reading.</p>
<p>You know, I can recall reading to my niece</p>
<p>and seeing her parents read to her,</p>
<p>and she had no clue whatsoever with what they were saying</p>
<p>because she, well, at least I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but she certainly couldn&rsquo;t speak,</p>
<p>but she liked looking at the pictures,</p>
<p>and it was a very predictable sort of interaction.</p>
<p>It was, okay, out come the books.</p>
<p>It was usually, here&rsquo;s the bath,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s the pajamas,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s the lights go down,</p>
<p>then out comes the book,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the interaction between parent and child,</p>
<p>which of course, usually also involves physical contact.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like the right brain system</p>
<p>and the left brain system are operating separately,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re operating in parallel.</p>
<p>But that sort of prediction and reward,</p>
<p>which kids like to be read to,</p>
<p>is generally mediated by this left brain system.</p>
<p>And this carries on as children get older</p>
<p>and as parents take on and evolve their parenting roles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very apparent that healthy social bonding</p>
<p>between children and caretaker relies on the fact</p>
<p>that both this right brain system</p>
<p>and the left brain system are engaged,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a synchronization of autonomic function,</p>
<p>meaning a joining together in actual somatic feeling,</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s a synchronization of experience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more about some outward or external stimulus,</p>
<p>like reading a book or watching a show together,</p>
<p>or enjoying some common experience of a meal together.</p>
<p>And of course, as children get older,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to access more and more</p>
<p>cognitively sophisticated things.</p>
<p>You can watch a movie with them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll make predictions</p>
<p>about which characters are going to show up, for instance.</p>
<p>Or you can take them to a concert</p>
<p>and they can appreciate the concert or play in that concert</p>
<p>and they appreciate that they&rsquo;re being appreciated.</p>
<p>Okay, so there are a million different,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s infinite number of examples here.</p>
<p>But the idea is that there are two parallel circuits</p>
<p>that are important for establishing bonds</p>
<p>and that this is set up very early on in childhood.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s neither emotional nor rational, but both.</p>
<p>Now, both of these circuits tap into the circuitry</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>where dopamine is released and molecules like serotonin,</p>
<p>which again is a neuromodulator more associated</p>
<p>with feelings of warmth, comfort, and satisfaction</p>
<p>with our immediate surroundings and possessions,</p>
<p>rather than seeking of things and motivation</p>
<p>and drive to go look for things,</p>
<p>as is the case with dopamine.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s still interactions with those systems,</p>
<p>but the work of Alan Shore has stimulated a lot of interest</p>
<p>in what are these circuits</p>
<p>that underlie these autonomic bonding,</p>
<p>this matching of heart rate and breathing.</p>
<p>And what are the neural circuits that underlie this bonding</p>
<p>or this synchronization of experience</p>
<p>on the kind of left brain side?</p>
<p>And the reason I find this model so attractive</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s very clear that healthy child-parent bonds</p>
<p>are established, but not by one or the other</p>
<p>of these right brain or left brain systems, but by both.</p>
<p>And there isn&rsquo;t enough time to go into it right now,</p>
<p>but some of you are probably familiar</p>
<p>with this idea of anxious attached</p>
<p>versus avoidant attached versus</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of dissociative attached model</p>
<p>of infant-parent bonding.</p>
<p>Just briefly, what&rsquo;s becoming clear</p>
<p>from the neurobiological imaging studies</p>
<p>is that as people start to advance into adolescence</p>
<p>and adulthood and well into their elderly years,</p>
<p>the same circuits that were active</p>
<p>and established in childhood</p>
<p>are repurposed for other forms of attachment.</p>
<p>And that to have truly complete bonds</p>
<p>with other individuals,</p>
<p>but in particular with romantic partners,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important that there be both synchronization</p>
<p>of physiology and synchronization of these more,</p>
<p>I guess we could call them more rational</p>
<p>or predictive type circuits.</p>
<p>So we can leverage this information.</p>
<p>We can start to think about what sorts of bonds</p>
<p>to us feel very enriching and very complete.</p>
<p>We know that we can have, for instance,</p>
<p>an emotional connection with somebody,</p>
<p>but we can also have a cognitive connection with somebody.</p>
<p>I have many colleagues with whom I have</p>
<p>deep intellectual connection and convergence with.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I have deep emotional connection</p>
<p>with most of them.</p>
<p>A few of them, yes, but most of them, no.</p>
<p>Others in my life, for instance,</p>
<p>I have a deep emotional connection to,</p>
<p>but not a lot of deep cognitive connection to.</p>
<p>A good example would be the connection that I had</p>
<p>with my bulldog who unfortunately passed away,</p>
<p>but Costello, we had a very close emotional connection.</p>
<p>It was based on touch.</p>
<p>It was based on our walks.</p>
<p>It was based on fun.</p>
<p>It was very autonomic.</p>
<p>We rarely discussed, if ever, what we were doing.</p>
<p>We had a felt relationship</p>
<p>as opposed to a cognitive relationship.</p>
<p>And while I&rsquo;m sort of half kidding about that as an example,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really good example.</p>
<p>It was a very real bond.</p>
<p>And in fact, just as a brief anecdote,</p>
<p>I can remember when Costello was a puppy</p>
<p>and I was entirely responsible for his wellbeing,</p>
<p>I, like any parent of any infant,</p>
<p>I lost my appetite for those few weeks</p>
<p>when I was house training him.</p>
<p>And I seemed to lose all ability</p>
<p>to process any cognitive information.</p>
<p>Now, I was also sleep deprived,</p>
<p>but I was entirely focused on the autonomic bond</p>
<p>that we were forming.</p>
<p>Now, thankfully, that eventually was established</p>
<p>pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Basically, I went on to just basically feed him,</p>
<p>walk him, and do everything for him.</p>
<p>And we had a wonderful relationship.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s very clear that what we&rsquo;re talking about here</p>
<p>is a form of empathy.</p>
<p>Empathy is the ability to feel,</p>
<p>or at least think we feel, what others feel.</p>
<p>Because again, as my colleague and the great bioengineer</p>
<p>and psychiatrist at Stanford, Carl Deisseroth, has said,</p>
<p>and he was a guest on this podcast,</p>
<p>we really don&rsquo;t know how other people feel.</p>
<p>We just get the sense that perhaps</p>
<p>we are feeling the same thing</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re feeling something different,</p>
<p>and we infer or we project what they might be thinking.</p>
<p>Empathy is this sense that we are sensing</p>
<p>what other people are sensing, okay?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no real way to verify that,</p>
<p>except if you&rsquo;re measuring physiologies,</p>
<p>you could get some insight into that.</p>
<p>In the clinical psychology</p>
<p>and in the neurobiological literature now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s understood that there is both emotional empathy,</p>
<p>like actually feeling what somebody is feeling,</p>
<p>and what is now called cognitive empathy.</p>
<p>Cognitive empathy is this idea</p>
<p>that we both see and experience something the same way</p>
<p>at a mental level.</p>
<p>Emotional empathy is this idea that,</p>
<p>yes, I can feel what you feel</p>
<p>at a visceral, somatic, or autonomic level.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s absolutely clear that strong social bonds</p>
<p>between children and caretaker</p>
<p>involve both emotional empathy, this autonomic function,</p>
<p>and cognitive empathy,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a mutual understanding</p>
<p>of how the other person feels,</p>
<p>and how the other person thinks</p>
<p>in order to be able to make predictions</p>
<p>about what they&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also very clear based on the emerging literature</p>
<p>that romantic relationships,</p>
<p>and to some extent friendships,</p>
<p>although friendships have been explored a bit less</p>
<p>in the literature,</p>
<p>that emotional empathy and cognitive empathy</p>
<p>are both required in order to establish</p>
<p>what we call a trusting social bond.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some beautiful experiments done</p>
<p>using neuroimaging of two individuals playing a trust game,</p>
<p>essentially a game where you&rsquo;re trying to predict</p>
<p>the other person&rsquo;s behavior,</p>
<p>whether or not they will behave in a trustworthy way.</p>
<p>And these experiments tend to use real money,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s actually something at stake.</p>
<p>And you can more or less predict</p>
<p>whether or not somebody feels</p>
<p>a lot of trust for somebody else,</p>
<p>and whether or not they believe they will act</p>
<p>in a trustworthy manner</p>
<p>based on whether or not they have high levels</p>
<p>of both cognitive empathy and emotional empathy.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are seeking</p>
<p>to establish deeper bonds, or bonds of any kind,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important that you think about synchronization</p>
<p>of bodily states, we talked about that earlier,</p>
<p>and synchronization of cognitive states.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to agree on everything.</p>
<p>In fact, oftentimes people who feel very close</p>
<p>to one another cognitively and emotionally</p>
<p>argue about all sorts of things</p>
<p>and disagree about a lot of things.</p>
<p>In fact, we probably know,</p>
<p>I certainly know people and couples</p>
<p>that seem to bond through arguing,</p>
<p>which is an interesting phenotype in itself.</p>
<p>But the point isn&rsquo;t that there be total convergence</p>
<p>of opinion or stance,</p>
<p>but rather that we understand how the other feels</p>
<p>and we believe that they understand how we feel,</p>
<p>that we understand how the other person thinks,</p>
<p>and that they think that we understand how they think.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a reciprocal loop between two people</p>
<p>that involves this cognition and involves emotion,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s grounded, as Dr. Shore has pointed out,</p>
<p>in our earliest forms of attachment.</p>
<p>And that makes perfect sense</p>
<p>because the same sorts of circuits</p>
<p>that are responsible for social homeostasis,</p>
<p>the kind of right brain and left brain circuits</p>
<p>that are responsible for infant mother attachment,</p>
<p>and then later for more intellectual</p>
<p>or predictive type attachments</p>
<p>between child and caregiver</p>
<p>are the exact same circuits that we superimpose</p>
<p>into all other types of relationships</p>
<p>throughout the rest of our life.</p>
<p>And I should just mention that for those of you</p>
<p>that might be thinking that you had</p>
<p>a less than satisfactory infant caretaker interaction</p>
<p>or form of attachment,</p>
<p>you are not alone.</p>
<p>And in fact, much of the work that Dr. Shore focuses on</p>
<p>is about how those early circumstances</p>
<p>can be understood and rewired</p>
<p>toward the development of healthy adult attachment.</p>
<p>And if you want to check out his work,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s actually got a few YouTube videos out there.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s Alan Shore spelled S-C-H-O-R-E.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get him as a guest on the podcast.</p>
<p>He also has a book, it&rsquo;s called Right Brain Psychotherapy,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an excellent book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually pretty accessible,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have a background</p>
<p>in biology or psychology.</p>
<p>I found it to be very interesting.</p>
<p>There are a lot of excellent references.</p>
<p>And again, if you&rsquo;re listening, Dr. Shore,</p>
<p>you know Alan Shore.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d love to get you on the podcast.</p>
<p>One of the key themes to understand</p>
<p>about biological processes</p>
<p>is that they often work on short timescales</p>
<p>and longer timescales.</p>
<p>And up until now, we&rsquo;ve mainly been talking</p>
<p>about the stuff that happens on short timescales.</p>
<p>So the kind of synchronization of heart rate</p>
<p>or activation of a given set of neurons</p>
<p>that dumps some dopamine and causes us</p>
<p>to seek out more social interaction or less, for instance.</p>
<p>But every biological circuit and function</p>
<p>needs to have longstanding effects as well.</p>
<p>And typically when you&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>longstanding effects in the brain and body,</p>
<p>you start looking towards the hormone system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always the case, but more often than not,</p>
<p>neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are pretty quick,</p>
<p>whereas hormones have longer lasting effects.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of hormones can actually travel</p>
<p>to the nucleus of a cell</p>
<p>and actually change which genes are expressed.</p>
<p>So if ever there was a hormone or hormone-like molecule</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with social bonding, it&rsquo;s oxytocin.</p>
<p>And oxytocin has gotten a ton of interest</p>
<p>in the popular press.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that is,</p>
<p>but perhaps it&rsquo;s because of all the incredible things</p>
<p>that oxytocin is associated with.</p>
<p>And it is indeed a lot of things.</p>
<p>So for instance, oxytocin is released in the brain</p>
<p>and binds to receptors in different locations in the body.</p>
<p>And the moment you hear different locations in the body,</p>
<p>you should think,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s going to have lots of different effects.</p>
<p>And indeed it does.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is involved in orgasm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in social recognition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>When you see people that you consider your people,</p>
<p>your team, your group, your friends, oxytocin is released.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t come into physical contact with them.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is also associated with pair bonding.</p>
<p>The feeling that they are your person</p>
<p>and that you are their person</p>
<p>is a common language people use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also associated with honesty.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there are experiments that show</p>
<p>that if people receive oxytocin through an inhalation spray,</p>
<p>that they will be more honest</p>
<p>and forthcoming about certain things.</p>
<p>And the oxytocin system and variants in the oxytocin system</p>
<p>have also been associated with autism</p>
<p>and various autism spectrum disorders.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a huge range of behaviors that it&rsquo;s involved in</p>
<p>because you have receptors for oxytocin</p>
<p>in lots of different brain structures</p>
<p>and areas of the body that do different things.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s some very consistent effects of oxytocin</p>
<p>that are worth just listing off.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to talk about two separate pathways</p>
<p>by which oxytocin can manifest its effects</p>
<p>and how you can actually regulate oxytocin</p>
<p>in ways that are interesting and perhaps useful as well.</p>
<p>First of all, oxytocin is involved</p>
<p>in the milk letdown reflex, lactation.</p>
<p>This makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>There needs to be a cue by which the suckling on the nipple</p>
<p>of the infant causes the release or letdown of milk</p>
<p>and milk letdown and lactation is controlled by prolactin,</p>
<p>another hormone, but also oxytocin.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is also involved in uterine contraction</p>
<p>during childbirth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in cervical dilation</p>
<p>to allow the baby to pass out of the birth canal.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s involved in induction of breastfeeding and of labor,</p>
<p>which is remarkable and especially remarkable</p>
<p>given that in males, or at least in some male animals</p>
<p>and in some male humans, and I do want to say some,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll get back to this,</p>
<p>it can be involved in the erection response.</p>
<p>It can be involved in the orgasm response</p>
<p>in both males and females.</p>
<p>Although there, there&rsquo;s a very interesting difference.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of controversy about this,</p>
<p>but it does appear that in females,</p>
<p>sexual stimulation and orgasm</p>
<p>cause the release of oxytocin.</p>
<p>Whereas in males, sexual stimulation</p>
<p>does not cause the release of oxytocin,</p>
<p>but rather a different molecule, vasopressin,</p>
<p>is triggered by sexual stimulation,</p>
<p>but orgasm does trigger the release of oxytocin in males,</p>
<p>but with a delay of about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Why that is and the specific function of that is not clear,</p>
<p>but it does seem that oxytocin is involved</p>
<p>in the sexual response in both males and females.</p>
<p>The main types of interactions</p>
<p>that release oxytocin at high levels are, first of all,</p>
<p>that the interaction be between individuals</p>
<p>that see each other as very closely associated, right?</p>
<p>So a infant and mother are very closely associated,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s an adopted infant or not.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they are in close contact.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they are from the very body of the other.</p>
<p>And so the amount or the amplitude of oxytocin release</p>
<p>tends to scale with how closely associated individuals are.</p>
<p>Just the sight of one&rsquo;s baby or smell of one&rsquo;s baby</p>
<p>can evoke oxytocin release and vice versa from the mother.</p>
<p>Physical contact, even more so.</p>
<p>In romantic partners, physical contact,</p>
<p>even the sight of a picture of a partner</p>
<p>can evoke oxytocin release and sexual desire, also trust.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this whole collection of psychological</p>
<p>and physiological things that are packaged</p>
<p>into the oxytocin system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a one-way system.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people out there have written to me</p>
<p>asking about inhalant oxytocin,</p>
<p>asking whether or not that can actually increase</p>
<p>the depth or rate of pair bonding.</p>
<p>And there does seem to be some evidence for that.</p>
<p>Now, I think in most places, oxytocin is prescription,</p>
<p>although it might be over the counter in others.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you have to check where you are.</p>
<p>As far as I know, you can&rsquo;t just go out</p>
<p>and buy oxytocin nasal spray, although you may be able to.</p>
<p>Forgive me, I&rsquo;m naive to that point.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting to note that some drugs</p>
<p>that are being used in clinical trials</p>
<p>for things like trauma and are also used</p>
<p>in clinical therapeutic settings for increasing bonding,</p>
<p>in particular, MDMA, also called ecstasy,</p>
<p>increase dopamine and serotonin.</p>
<p>We know this.</p>
<p>Dopamine and serotonin have a vast number of effects</p>
<p>throughout the brain and body that I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>some of them today and in other podcasts.</p>
<p>But one of the lesser appreciated effects of MDMA</p>
<p>is that it causes huge increases, massive increases</p>
<p>in the amount of oxytocin that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>into the brain and body.</p>
<p>And MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, while still illegal,</p>
<p>as far as I know, certainly in the United States,</p>
<p>but in most places throughout the world,</p>
<p>is being explored in clinical trials,</p>
<p>not just for trauma, not just for depression,</p>
<p>not just for eating disorders, but also for reestablishing</p>
<p>what seem to be fractured or challenged bonds</p>
<p>between romantic partners.</p>
<p>And while most of the attention has been focused</p>
<p>on the dopaminergic and serotonergic aspects</p>
<p>of the MDMA response, it&rsquo;s clear to me,</p>
<p>based on my read of the literature,</p>
<p>that the enormously elevated oxytocin that occurs</p>
<p>during the consumption of MDMA is part of the reason</p>
<p>why people experience during the MDMA session</p>
<p>and post-MDMA session, a much greater degree</p>
<p>and depth of kinship or feeling of connection</p>
<p>with that person.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to point out that that feeling</p>
<p>of connection is of the autonomic type</p>
<p>that I was referring to earlier, a la Alan Shor&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s not of the, oh, we think about things</p>
<p>the exact same way, we agree on everything now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of that their physiologies are synchronized.</p>
<p>So much so that even in individuals within a couple</p>
<p>where one does a therapeutic session and the other does not,</p>
<p>they still both feel quite more bonded to the other.</p>
<p>Now, oftentimes in the clinical therapeutic setting,</p>
<p>both members of a couple or romantic partnership,</p>
<p>whatever that form it may take, are consuming MDMA</p>
<p>and then thereby experiencing elevated oxytocin</p>
<p>and this enhanced sense of bonding.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s this autonomic bonding,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so powerful, meaning the oxytocin response</p>
<p>is so powerful that it doesn&rsquo;t even require</p>
<p>that both individuals experience this huge inflection</p>
<p>in oxytocin and that&rsquo;s because one person&rsquo;s physiology</p>
<p>is influencing the other and oxytocin is this kind</p>
<p>of bridging signal that occurs in both nervous systems,</p>
<p>synchronizes things like heartbeat.</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s associated with touch.</p>
<p>And so if people are touching or people are engaging</p>
<p>in the sorts of behaviors that I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>that can increase oxytocin further,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to further increase the depth of the bond.</p>
<p>But the point here is that there&rsquo;s actually a hormonal glue</p>
<p>between individuals, okay?</p>
<p>Infant and mother, friends, teammates,</p>
<p>romantic partners, and so on.</p>
<p>And that hormonal glue is oxytocin.</p>
<p>Now, people vary in the extent to which they feel</p>
<p>or have the capacity to feel bonded to anyone.</p>
<p>And it is now generally understood</p>
<p>that some of that variation might depend on variations</p>
<p>in oxytocin receptors or what are called</p>
<p>gene polymorphisms for oxytocin.</p>
<p>Genes can have a number of different sequences in them.</p>
<p>There are nucleotide sequences.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t go into genetics right now.</p>
<p>A&rsquo;s and G&rsquo;s and C&rsquo;s and T&rsquo;s in various combinations</p>
<p>are what make up the genes.</p>
<p>Genes are transcribed into RNA.</p>
<p>RNA is translated into proteins that affect cells, okay?</p>
<p>The oxytocin gene encodes for oxytocin</p>
<p>and variants in that gene change the amount</p>
<p>and function of oxytocin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really interesting study</p>
<p>published just this last year in a relatively new journal.</p>
<p>The journal has a kind of a unusual name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Helion.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Helion and not Helion,</p>
<p>but Helion, H-E-L-I-Y-O-N.</p>
<p>This is a cell press journal.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, it&rsquo;s a very solid journal.</p>
<p>Certainly the cell press label is very stringent.</p>
<p>And this paper is entitled</p>
<p>The Relation Between Oxytocin Receptor Gene Polymorphisms,</p>
<p>which just means changes in genes or variations in genes,</p>
<p>Adult Attachment and Instagram Sociability,</p>
<p>an Exploratory Analysis.</p>
<p>This is a really wild study, but I like the study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very thorough.</p>
<p>First author, last name Carollo, C-A-R-O-L-L-O.</p>
<p>And what they found was that by analyzing the genetics</p>
<p>of different individuals who are on social media</p>
<p>and looking at how many people those individuals follow</p>
<p>and how many people follow them,</p>
<p>and what they come up with</p>
<p>is a so-called social desirability index.</p>
<p>They were able to correlate in a very straightforward way</p>
<p>that people that carry certain variants</p>
<p>in the oxytocin and oxytocin receptor genes</p>
<p>actually seek out more online social Instagram interactions.</p>
<p>So some people I know, I won&rsquo;t name their names,</p>
<p>only follow anywhere from zero to six accounts.</p>
<p>Other people follow thousands of accounts</p>
<p>and they take the ratio of how many accounts people follow</p>
<p>versus how many followers they have,</p>
<p>arguably not a perfect measure,</p>
<p>but a nice one in the sense that you can do this</p>
<p>in a completely unbiased way</p>
<p>with many, many thousands of subjects.</p>
<p>And then they were able to get genomic analysis</p>
<p>from a number of these subjects.</p>
<p>And it turns out that people who have, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>higher levels of oxytocin function</p>
<p>or potential levels of oxytocin function</p>
<p>actively seek out more social interactions on social media.</p>
<p>So this I think represents an important first</p>
<p>in the area of how social media and data from social media</p>
<p>are starting to merge with biological data</p>
<p>in terms of predicting how avidly people will seek out</p>
<p>social interactions of an online type.</p>
<p>And nowadays we hear a lot about how online we are connected</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not really, what is it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re communicating but we&rsquo;re not connected</p>
<p>or the connections aren&rsquo;t real.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going to need to revisit that.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m certainly a believer in the idea</p>
<p>that face-to-face communication</p>
<p>and common interactions with people</p>
<p>standing in the same space or playing sports together,</p>
<p>enjoying music together, enjoying meals together</p>
<p>is vitally important.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an entire generation or several generations</p>
<p>of people that are coming up</p>
<p>who much of their social interaction has been online.</p>
<p>And if you think about it,</p>
<p>all of the things that we&rsquo;ve spelled out earlier</p>
<p>about common mental narrative,</p>
<p>this left brain system a la Alan Shore</p>
<p>or autonomic bonding or synchronization of heartbeats</p>
<p>according to common stories,</p>
<p>all that is happening in online social interactions.</p>
<p>When a thousand of us look at the exact same Instagram post,</p>
<p>yes, we will have a thousand independent responses to that</p>
<p>but chances are many of us have a similar or same response</p>
<p>based on the data that we talked about earlier</p>
<p>in synchronization of heartbeats.</p>
<p>And so we are socially bonded with other people</p>
<p>through social media.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very apparent that the oxytocin system</p>
<p>is playing some role in that.</p>
<p>And this, if we zoom out, makes perfect sense</p>
<p>because again, dopamine, serotonin, prolactin, oxytocin,</p>
<p>none of these systems were placed in us</p>
<p>or are organized within us</p>
<p>in order to encourage specific</p>
<p>and only specific types of social interactions.</p>
<p>The one that we can say is absolutely critical</p>
<p>is the child-parent interaction, right?</p>
<p>Because children simply can&rsquo;t take care of themselves.</p>
<p>They need a caretaker.</p>
<p>I should have said caretaker, not parent.</p>
<p>But infants, if they&rsquo;re not taking care, will die.</p>
<p>But beyond that, we have evolved</p>
<p>or come to realize many different types</p>
<p>of social interactions.</p>
<p>And online interactions nowadays are very, very common.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly involved in them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re involved in them as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re involved in one right now, for example.</p>
<p>The oxytocin system is absolutely threaded through</p>
<p>and largely responsible</p>
<p>for those types of social bonds as well.</p>
<p>And incidentally, oxytocin is the name of the fifth song</p>
<p>on Billie Eilish&rsquo;s second album, Happier Than Ever.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve covered a lot about the biology</p>
<p>and indeed the neural circuitry and neurochemistry</p>
<p>and neuroendocrinology of social bonding.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that I highlight the key features</p>
<p>that go into any and all of your social bonds.</p>
<p>First of all, all social bonds</p>
<p>have the potential to include both</p>
<p>what we called emotional empathy and cognitive empathy.</p>
<p>And so if you are interested in establishing</p>
<p>and deepening social bonds of any kind,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important that you put some effort</p>
<p>toward this thing that we call emotional empathy,</p>
<p>which is really about sharing autonomic experience.</p>
<p>Now, depending on the relationship,</p>
<p>that will take on different contexts.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s appropriate in one type of bond</p>
<p>is not going to be appropriate in another type of bond.</p>
<p>Physical contact, for instance,</p>
<p>is appropriate for certain types of bonds</p>
<p>and not for others.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, emotional empathy</p>
<p>and the synchronization of autonomic function,</p>
<p>heart rate, breathing, et cetera,</p>
<p>can be best accomplished by paying attention</p>
<p>to external events in particular narrative, story, music,</p>
<p>and perhaps sports or other types of experience</p>
<p>as an external stimulus to drive synchrony</p>
<p>of those internal states.</p>
<p>The other aspect of forming deep bonds is cognitive empathy.</p>
<p>Again, cognitive empathy is not about agreeing on things</p>
<p>or viewing things the exact same way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about really gaining understanding</p>
<p>of how somebody else thinks about something,</p>
<p>really paying attention to that,</p>
<p>and then paying attention to how you think about</p>
<p>and feel about something.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what cognitive empathy is.</p>
<p>So emotional and cognitive empathy together</p>
<p>are what make up these really robust bonds of various kinds.</p>
<p>Now, we also talked about introversion and extroversion,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to try and dismantle the common misperceptions</p>
<p>about introversion, extroversion,</p>
<p>because when we look at the neural circuitry, as you recall,</p>
<p>introverts are not people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t like social interaction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that they feel filled up or sated</p>
<p>by less social interaction than would be an extrovert.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because,</p>
<p>at least according to the social homeostasis circuit model,</p>
<p>they actually get more dopamine</p>
<p>from less social interaction, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like somebody who&rsquo;s sated by less amount of food, okay?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t have the same appetite.</p>
<p>It just means that they get more from less.</p>
<p>Whereas extroverts get less dopamine release</p>
<p>from an equivalent amount of social interaction.</p>
<p>And of course, these aren&rsquo;t precise measurements,</p>
<p>but on the whole, extroverts need more social interaction,</p>
<p>more frequent, more long-lasting, et cetera,</p>
<p>in order to achieve that dopamine threshold.</p>
<p>Because again, dopamine is driving</p>
<p>that craving of social interaction.</p>
<p>And once it&rsquo;s met,</p>
<p>then people don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>they have to seek social interaction as much.</p>
<p>So for those of you that feel</p>
<p>as if you&rsquo;re an introvert or extrovert,</p>
<p>or that know introverts and extroverts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about how verbal people are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about how much</p>
<p>they seek out social interactions per se.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about how much social interaction</p>
<p>is enough for the given person.</p>
<p>Now, the whole reason for providing this framework,</p>
<p>this biological circuitry, et cetera,</p>
<p>is not to simply put a reductionist view</p>
<p>on things that you already realized and knew,</p>
<p>but rather to give you some leverage points</p>
<p>to understand how is it that you form social bonds?</p>
<p>How is it that you might be challenged</p>
<p>in forming certain types of social bonds?</p>
<p>And to think about entry points</p>
<p>to both establishing and reinforcing social bonds</p>
<p>of different kinds.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it will also give you insight</p>
<p>into why breakups, whether it be between friendships</p>
<p>or romantic partners, can be so painful.</p>
<p>A breakup of any kind involves</p>
<p>both a breaking of that emotional empathy</p>
<p>and that cognitive empathy.</p>
<p>And indeed, it has a neurobiological</p>
<p>and hormonal underpinning, right?</p>
<p>We go into some sense, a social isolation,</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re surrounded by other types of people.</p>
<p>If one of our major sources of oxytocin,</p>
<p>or one of our major sources of dopamine</p>
<p>suddenly is not around,</p>
<p>that is incredibly devastating to a nervous system.</p>
<p>And to borrow from the great psychologist</p>
<p>and neurobiologist, Lisa Feldman Barrett,</p>
<p>who says, you know, we are not just individuals,</p>
<p>we are nervous systems influencing other nervous systems,</p>
<p>and their nervous systems are influencing us,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the right way to think about it.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise</p>
<p>that breakups of various kinds are very challenging,</p>
<p>regardless of what underlied that breakup,</p>
<p>whether or not somebody moving</p>
<p>or an actual decision of one person</p>
<p>to leave the relationship or both, et cetera.</p>
<p>On the more positive side, largely biological,</p>
<p>but to some extent, psychological view of social bonding</p>
<p>will also allow you to orient in this vast landscape</p>
<p>that we call social bonds,</p>
<p>to understand why it is perhaps</p>
<p>that you seek out so many online interactions.</p>
<p>Maybe you have the oxytocin polymorphism</p>
<p>that causes you to want more, follow more accounts,</p>
<p>or interact more with people and comment more,</p>
<p>respond to comments, who knows?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also hoping that it will allow you to get a lens</p>
<p>into how you can strengthen the social bonds</p>
<p>that you want to strengthen</p>
<p>and to establish new social bonds</p>
<p>that you want to establish.</p>
<p>None of this is meant to manipulate or leverage social bonds</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise form.</p>
<p>To the contrary, it&rsquo;s about identifying</p>
<p>what are the specific routes</p>
<p>by which social bonds are created,</p>
<p>and allowing you, I hope, to work with people</p>
<p>that you feel challenged in forming social bonds with,</p>
<p>or maybe deciding to completely divorce</p>
<p>from those social bonds entirely,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s absolutely no hope</p>
<p>of ever forming emotional or cognitive empathy.</p>
<p>I certainly acknowledge that that could be the case too.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s both a light and a dark and a gray zone</p>
<p>to this entire thing that we call social bonding.</p>
<p>What is not graded, but is absolute, as they say,</p>
<p>is that social bonds are vitally important</p>
<p>to us as a species,</p>
<p>whether or not they are at a distance over social media,</p>
<p>whether or not they are in close proximity,</p>
<p>actual physical contact.</p>
<p>Today, what I&rsquo;ve really tried to illustrate</p>
<p>is that there are a common set of biological,</p>
<p>neurochemical, and hormonal underpinnings</p>
<p>to what we call social bonding.</p>
<p>And so while it is complex and it is subjective,</p>
<p>it involves the hierarchies,</p>
<p>it involves our previous upbringing,</p>
<p>it involves our goals, et cetera,</p>
<p>it is not infinitely complex.</p>
<p>And in that sense, it is tractable.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ve offered you some levers</p>
<p>or some entry points under which you can both understand</p>
<p>and move towards social bonds</p>
<p>that would be more satisfying and more gratifying for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly one of the goals.</p>
<p>The other one is that hopefully if you&rsquo;re a clinician</p>
<p>or simply the friend that people go to</p>
<p>or the family member that people go to</p>
<p>when they are challenged</p>
<p>through various challenges in social bonds,</p>
<p>that you can start to perhaps pass along</p>
<p>some of the information as a way of people understanding</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re going through as they are breaking up,</p>
<p>but also as they are falling in love,</p>
<p>as they are forming attachments,</p>
<p>and as they are being challenged with attachments.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my hope.</p>
<p>And especially as you head into the holidays</p>
<p>and end of year,</p>
<p>but also as it continues into 2022,</p>
<p>I would hope that you would take this knowledge</p>
<p>and apply it in any of the ways</p>
<p>that you feel are meaningful and adaptive for you.</p>
