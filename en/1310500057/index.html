    <p>The following is a conversation with Rohit Prasad.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the vice president and head scientist of Amazon Alexa</p>
<p>and one of its original creators.</p>
<p>The Alexa team embodies some of the most challenging,</p>
<p>incredible, impactful, and inspiring work</p>
<p>that is done in AI today.</p>
<p>The team has to both solve problems</p>
<p>at the cutting edge of natural language processing</p>
<p>and provide a trustworthy, secure, and enjoyable experience</p>
<p>to millions of people.</p>
<p>This is where state of the art methods</p>
<p>in computer science meet the challenges</p>
<p>of real world engineering.</p>
<p>In many ways, Alexa and the other voice assistants</p>
<p>are the voices of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>to millions of people and an introduction to AI</p>
<p>for people who have only encountered it in science fiction.</p>
<p>This is an important and exciting opportunity.</p>
<p>So the work that Rohit and the Alexa team are doing</p>
<p>is an inspiration to me and to many researchers</p>
<p>and engineers in the AI community.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>give it five stars on Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter,</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>If you leave a review on Apple Podcasts especially,</p>
<p>but also cast box or comment on YouTube,</p>
<p>consider mentioning topics, people, ideas, questions,</p>
<p>quotes in science, tech, or philosophy</p>
<p>that you find interesting,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll read them on this podcast.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t call out names, but I love comments</p>
<p>with kindness and thoughtfulness in them,</p>
<p>so I thought I&rsquo;d share them.</p>
<p>Someone on YouTube highlighted a quote</p>
<p>from the conversation with Ray Dalio,</p>
<p>where he said that you have to appreciate</p>
<p>all the different ways that people can be A players.</p>
<p>This connected me to, on teams of engineers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to think that raw productivity</p>
<p>is the measure of excellence, but there are others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with people who brought a smile to my face</p>
<p>every time I got to work in the morning.</p>
<p>Their contribution to the team is immeasurable.</p>
<p>I recently started doing podcast ads</p>
<p>at the end of the introduction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode,</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,</p>
<p>but you can also use it to buy, sell,</p>
<p>and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.</p>
<p>Cash App also has a new investing feature.</p>
<p>You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,</p>
<p>no matter what the stock price is.</p>
<p>Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,</p>
<p>a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working with Cash App</p>
<p>to support one of my favorite organizations called First,</p>
<p>best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.</p>
<p>They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students</p>
<p>in over 110 countries, and have a perfect rating</p>
<p>on Charity Navigator, which means that donated money</p>
<p>is used to maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play,</p>
<p>and use code LexPodcast, you&rsquo;ll get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>which again, is an organization that I&rsquo;ve personally seen</p>
<p>inspire girls and boys to dream</p>
<p>of engineering a better world.</p>
<p>This podcast is also supported by ZipRecruiter.</p>
<p>Hiring great people is hard, and to me,</p>
<p>is one of the most important elements</p>
<p>of a successful mission driven team.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to be a part of,</p>
<p>and lead several great engineering teams.</p>
<p>The hiring I&rsquo;ve done in the past was mostly through tools</p>
<p>we built ourselves, but reinventing the wheel was painful.</p>
<p>ZipRecruiter is a tool that&rsquo;s already available for you.</p>
<p>It seeks to make hiring simple, fast, and smart.</p>
<p>For example, Codable cofounder, Gretchen Huebner,</p>
<p>used ZipRecruiter to find a new game artist</p>
<p>to join our education tech company.</p>
<p>By using ZipRecruiter&rsquo;s screening questions</p>
<p>to filter candidates, Gretchen found it easier</p>
<p>to focus on the best candidates,</p>
<p>and finally, hiring the perfect person for the role,</p>
<p>in less than two weeks, from start to finish.</p>
<p>ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.</p>
<p>See why ZipRecruiter is effective for businesses</p>
<p>of all sizes by signing up,</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s ziprecruiter.com slash lexpod.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Rohit Prasad.</p>
<p>In the movie Her, I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;ve ever seen it.</p>
<p>Human falls in love with the voice of an AI system.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start at the highest philosophical level</p>
<p>before we get to deep learning and some of the fun things.</p>
<p>Do you think this, what the movie Her shows,</p>
<p>is within our reach?</p>
<p>I think not specifically about Her,</p>
<p>but I think what we are seeing is a massive increase</p>
<p>in adoption of AI assistance, or AI,</p>
<p>in all parts of our social fabric.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s, what I do believe,</p>
<p>is that the utility these AIs provide,</p>
<p>some of the functionalities that are shown</p>
<p>are absolutely within reach.</p>
<p>So some of the functionality</p>
<p>in terms of the interactive elements,</p>
<p>but in terms of the deep connection,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s purely voice based.</p>
<p>Do you think such a close connection is possible</p>
<p>with voice alone?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I saw Her,</p>
<p>but I would say in terms of interactions</p>
<p>which are both human like and in these AI systems,</p>
<p>you have to value what is also superhuman.</p>
<p>We as humans can be in only one place.</p>
<p>AI assistance can be in multiple places at the same time.</p>
<p>One with you on your mobile device,</p>
<p>one at your home, one at work.</p>
<p>So you have to respect these superhuman capabilities too.</p>
<p>Plus as humans, we have certain attributes</p>
<p>we are very good at, very good at reasoning.</p>
<p>AI assistance not yet there,</p>
<p>but in the realm of AI assistance,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re great at is computation, memory,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s infinite and pure.</p>
<p>These are the attributes you have to start respecting.</p>
<p>So I think the comparison with human like</p>
<p>versus the other aspect, which is also superhuman,</p>
<p>has to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>So I think we need to elevate the discussion</p>
<p>to not just human like.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s certainly elements,</p>
<p>we just mentioned, Alexa is everywhere,</p>
<p>computation speaking.</p>
<p>So this is a much bigger infrastructure</p>
<p>than just the thing that sits there in the room with you.</p>
<p>But it certainly feels to us mere humans</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s just another little creature there</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re interacting with it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not interacting with the entirety</p>
<p>of the infrastructure, you&rsquo;re interacting with the device.</p>
<p>The feeling is, okay, sure, we anthropomorphize things,</p>
<p>but that feeling is still there.</p>
<p>So what do you think we as humans,</p>
<p>the purity of the interaction with a smart device,</p>
<p>interaction with a smart assistant,</p>
<p>what do you think we look for in that interaction?</p>
<p>I think in the certain interactions</p>
<p>I think will be very much where it does feel like a human</p>
<p>because it has a persona of its own.</p>
<p>And in certain ones it wouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>So I think a simple example to think of it</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re walking through the house</p>
<p>and you just wanna turn on your lights on and off</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re issuing a command,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not very much like a human like interaction</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where the AI shouldn&rsquo;t come back</p>
<p>and have a conversation with you,</p>
<p>just it should simply complete that command.</p>
<p>So those, I think the blend of,</p>
<p>we have to think about this is not human, human alone.</p>
<p>It is a human machine interaction</p>
<p>and certain aspects of humans are needed</p>
<p>and certain aspects are in situations</p>
<p>demand it to be like a machine.</p>
<p>So I told you, it&rsquo;s gonna be philosophical in parts.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between human and machine</p>
<p>in that interaction?</p>
<p>When we interact to humans,</p>
<p>especially those are friends and loved ones</p>
<p>versus you and a machine that you also are close with.</p>
<p>I think the, you have to think about the roles</p>
<p>the AI plays, right?</p>
<p>So, and it differs from different customer to customer,</p>
<p>different situation to situation,</p>
<p>especially I can speak from Alexa&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>It is a companion, a friend at times,</p>
<p>an assistant, an advisor down the line.</p>
<p>So I think most AIs will have this kind of attributes</p>
<p>and it will be very situational in nature.</p>
<p>So where is the boundary?</p>
<p>I think the boundary depends on exact context</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;re interacting with the AI.</p>
<p>So the depth and the richness</p>
<p>of natural language conversation</p>
<p>is been by Alan Turing been used to try to define</p>
<p>what it means to be intelligent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of criticism of that kind of test,</p>
<p>but what do you think is a good test of intelligence</p>
<p>in your view, in the context of the Turing test</p>
<p>and Alexa or the Alexa prize, this whole realm,</p>
<p>do you think about this human intelligence,</p>
<p>what it means to define it,</p>
<p>what it means to reach that level?</p>
<p>I do think the ability to converse</p>
<p>is a sign of an ultimate intelligence.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s no question about it.</p>
<p>So if you think about all aspects of humans,</p>
<p>there are sensors we have,</p>
<p>and those are basically a data collection mechanism.</p>
<p>And based on that,</p>
<p>we make some decisions with our sensory brains, right?</p>
<p>And from that perspective,</p>
<p>I think there are elements we have to talk about</p>
<p>how we sense the world</p>
<p>and then how we act based on what we sense.</p>
<p>Those elements clearly machines have,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s the other aspects of computation</p>
<p>that is way better.</p>
<p>I also mentioned about memory again,</p>
<p>in terms of being near infinite,</p>
<p>depending on the storage capacity you have,</p>
<p>and the retrieval can be extremely fast and pure</p>
<p>in terms of like, there&rsquo;s no ambiguity</p>
<p>of who did I see when, right?</p>
<p>I mean, machines can remember that quite well.</p>
<p>So again, on a philosophical level,</p>
<p>I do subscribe to the fact that to be able to converse</p>
<p>and as part of that, to be able to reason</p>
<p>based on the world knowledge you&rsquo;ve acquired</p>
<p>and the sensory knowledge that is there</p>
<p>is definitely very much the essence of intelligence.</p>
<p>But intelligence can go beyond human level intelligence</p>
<p>based on what machines are getting capable of.</p>
<p>So what do you think maybe stepping outside of Alexa</p>
<p>broadly as an AI field,</p>
<p>what do you think is a good test of intelligence?</p>
<p>Put it another way outside of Alexa,</p>
<p>because so much of Alexa is a product,</p>
<p>is an experience for the customer.</p>
<p>On the research side,</p>
<p>what would impress the heck out of you if you saw,</p>
<p>you know, what is the test where you said,</p>
<p>wow, this thing is now starting to encroach</p>
<p>into the realm of what we loosely think</p>
<p>of as human intelligence?</p>
<p>So, well, we think of it as AGI</p>
<p>and human intelligence altogether, right?</p>
<p>So in some sense, and I think we are quite far from that.</p>
<p>I think an unbiased view I have</p>
<p>is that the Alexa&rsquo;s intelligence capability is a great test.</p>
<p>I think of it as there are many other true points</p>
<p>like self driving cars, game playing like go or chess.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take those two for as an example,</p>
<p>clearly requires a lot of data driven learning</p>
<p>and intelligence, but it&rsquo;s not as hard a problem</p>
<p>as conversing with, as an AI is with humans</p>
<p>to accomplish certain tasks or open domain chat,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, Alexa prize.</p>
<p>In those settings, the key differences</p>
<p>that the end goal is not defined unlike game playing.</p>
<p>You also do not know exactly what state you are in</p>
<p>in a particular goal completion scenario.</p>
<p>In certain sense, sometimes you can,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a simple goal, but if you&rsquo;re even certain examples</p>
<p>like planning a weekend or you can imagine</p>
<p>how many things change along the way,</p>
<p>you look for whether you may change your mind</p>
<p>and you change the destination,</p>
<p>or you want to catch a particular event</p>
<p>and then you decide, no, I want this other event</p>
<p>I want to go to.</p>
<p>So these dimensions of how many different steps</p>
<p>are possible when you&rsquo;re conversing as a human</p>
<p>with a machine makes it an extremely daunting problem.</p>
<p>And I think it is the ultimate test for intelligence.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t you think that natural language is enough to prove</p>
<p>that conversation, just pure conversation?</p>
<p>From a scientific standpoint,</p>
<p>natural language is a great test,</p>
<p>but I would go beyond, I don&rsquo;t want to limit it</p>
<p>to as natural language as simply understanding an intent</p>
<p>or parsing for entities and so forth.</p>
<p>We are really talking about dialogue.</p>
<p>Dialogue, yeah.</p>
<p>So I would say human machine dialogue</p>
<p>is definitely one of the best tests of intelligence.</p>
<p>So can you briefly speak to the Alexa Prize</p>
<p>for people who are not familiar with it,</p>
<p>and also just maybe where things stand</p>
<p>and what have you learned and what&rsquo;s surprising?</p>
<p>What have you seen that&rsquo;s surprising</p>
<p>from this incredible competition?</p>
<p>Absolutely, it&rsquo;s a very exciting competition.</p>
<p>Alexa Prize is essentially a grand challenge</p>
<p>in conversational artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>where we threw the gauntlet to the universities</p>
<p>who do active research in the field,</p>
<p>to say, can you build what we call a social bot</p>
<p>that can converse with you coherently</p>
<p>and engagingly for 20 minutes?</p>
<p>That is an extremely hard challenge,</p>
<p>talking to someone who you&rsquo;re meeting for the first time,</p>
<p>or even if you&rsquo;ve met them quite often,</p>
<p>to speak at 20 minutes on any topic,</p>
<p>an evolving nature of topics is super hard.</p>
<p>We have completed two successful years of the competition.</p>
<p>The first was won with the University of Washington,</p>
<p>second, the University of California.</p>
<p>We are in our third instance.</p>
<p>We have an extremely strong team of 10 cohorts,</p>
<p>and the third instance of the Alexa Prize is underway now.</p>
<p>And we are seeing a constant evolution.</p>
<p>First year was definitely a learning.</p>
<p>It was a lot of things to be put together.</p>
<p>We had to build a lot of infrastructure</p>
<p>to enable these universities</p>
<p>to be able to build magical experiences</p>
<p>and do high quality research.</p>
<p>Just a few quick questions, sorry for the interruption.</p>
<p>What does failure look like in the 20 minute session?</p>
<p>So what does it mean to fail,</p>
<p>not to reach the 20 minute mark?</p>
<p>Oh, awesome question.</p>
<p>So there are one, first of all,</p>
<p>I forgot to mention one more detail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just 20 minutes,</p>
<p>but the quality of the conversation too that matters.</p>
<p>And the beauty of this competition</p>
<p>before I answer that question on what failure means</p>
<p>is first that you actually converse</p>
<p>with millions and millions of customers</p>
<p>as the social bots.</p>
<p>So during the judging phases, there are multiple phases,</p>
<p>before we get to the finals,</p>
<p>which is a very controlled judging in a situation</p>
<p>where we bring in judges</p>
<p>and we have interactors who interact with these social bots,</p>
<p>that is a much more controlled setting.</p>
<p>But till the point we get to the finals,</p>
<p>all the judging is essentially by the customers of Alexa.</p>
<p>And there you basically rate on a simple question,</p>
<p>how good your experience was.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we are not testing</p>
<p>for a 20 minute boundary being crossed,</p>
<p>because you do want it to be very much like a clear cut,</p>
<p>winner, be chosen, and it&rsquo;s an absolute bar.</p>
<p>So did you really break that 20 minute barrier</p>
<p>is why we have to test it in a more controlled setting</p>
<p>with actors, essentially interactors.</p>
<p>And see how the conversation goes.</p>
<p>So this is why it&rsquo;s a subtle difference</p>
<p>between how it&rsquo;s being tested in the field</p>
<p>with real customers versus in the lab to award the prize.</p>
<p>So on the latter one, what it means is that</p>
<p>essentially there are three judges</p>
<p>and two of them have to say</p>
<p>this conversation has stalled, essentially.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And the judges are human experts.</p>
<p>Judges are human experts.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So this is in the third year.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s been the evolution?</p>
<p>How far, so the DARPA challenge in the first year,</p>
<p>the autonomous vehicles, nobody finished.</p>
<p>In the second year, a few more finished in the desert.</p>
<p>So how far along in this,</p>
<p>I would say much harder challenge are we?</p>
<p>This challenge has come a long way</p>
<p>to the extent that we&rsquo;re definitely not close</p>
<p>to the 20 minute barrier being with coherence</p>
<p>and engaging conversation.</p>
<p>I think we are still five to 10 years away</p>
<p>in that horizon to complete that.</p>
<p>But the progress is immense.</p>
<p>Like what you&rsquo;re finding is the accuracy</p>
<p>and what kind of responses these social bots generate</p>
<p>is getting better and better.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even amazing to see that now there&rsquo;s humor coming in.</p>
<p>The bots are quite&hellip;</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>ultimate science of intelligence.</p>
<p>I think humor is a very high bar</p>
<p>in terms of what it takes to create humor.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean just being goofy.</p>
<p>I really mean good sense of humor</p>
<p>is also a sign of intelligence in my mind</p>
<p>and something very hard to do.</p>
<p>So these social bots are now exploring</p>
<p>not only what we think of natural language abilities,</p>
<p>but also personality attributes</p>
<p>and aspects of when to inject an appropriate joke,</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t know the domain,</p>
<p>how you come back with something more intelligible</p>
<p>so that you can continue the conversation.</p>
<p>If you and I are talking about AI</p>
<p>and we are domain experts, we can speak to it.</p>
<p>But if you suddenly switch a topic to that I don&rsquo;t know of,</p>
<p>how do I change the conversation?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re starting to notice these elements as well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s coming from partly by the nature</p>
<p>of the 20 minute challenge</p>
<p>that people are getting quite clever</p>
<p>on how to really converse</p>
<p>and essentially mask some of the understanding defects</p>
<p>if they exist.</p>
<p>So some of this, this is not Alexa, the product.</p>
<p>This is somewhat for fun, for research,</p>
<p>for innovation and so on.</p>
<p>I have a question sort of in this modern era,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of, if you look at Twitter and Facebook</p>
<p>and so on, there&rsquo;s discourse, public discourse going on</p>
<p>and some things that are a little bit too edgy,</p>
<p>people get blocked and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just out of curiosity,</p>
<p>are people in this context pushing the limits?</p>
<p>Is anyone using the F word?</p>
<p>Is anyone sort of pushing back</p>
<p>sort of arguing, I guess I should say,</p>
<p>as part of the dialogue to really draw people in?</p>
<p>First of all, let me just back up a bit</p>
<p>in terms of why we are doing this, right?</p>
<p>So you said it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>I think fun is more part of the engaging part for customers.</p>
<p>It is one of the most used skills as well</p>
<p>in our skill store.</p>
<p>But up that apart, the real goal was essentially</p>
<p>what was happening is with a lot of AI research</p>
<p>moving to industry, we felt that academia has the risk</p>
<p>of not being able to have the same resources</p>
<p>at disposal that we have, which is lots of data,</p>
<p>massive computing power, and a clear ways</p>
<p>to test these AI advances with real customer benefits.</p>
<p>So we brought all these three together in the Alexa price.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s one of my favorite projects in Amazon.</p>
<p>And with that, the secondary effect is yes,</p>
<p>it has become engaging for our customers as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not there in terms of where we want it to be, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a huge progress.</p>
<p>But coming back to your question on</p>
<p>how do the conversations evolve?</p>
<p>Yes, there is some natural attributes of what you said</p>
<p>in terms of argument and some amount of swearing.</p>
<p>The way we take care of that is that there is</p>
<p>a sensitive filter we have built that sees keywords.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more than keywords, a little more in terms of,</p>
<p>of course, there&rsquo;s keyword based too,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s more in terms of these words can be</p>
<p>very contextual, as you can see,</p>
<p>and also the topic can be something</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t want a conversation to happen</p>
<p>because this is a communal device as well.</p>
<p>A lot of people use these devices.</p>
<p>So we have put a lot of guardrails for the conversation</p>
<p>to be more useful for advancing AI</p>
<p>and not so much of these other issues you attributed</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in the AI field as well.</p>
<p>Right, so this is actually a serious opportunity.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t use the right word, fun.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an open opportunity to do</p>
<p>some of the best innovation</p>
<p>in conversational agents in the world.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Why just universities?</p>
<p>Because as I said, I really felt</p>
<p>Young minds.</p>
<p>Young minds, it&rsquo;s also to,</p>
<p>if you think about the other aspect</p>
<p>of where the whole industry is moving with AI,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a dearth of talent given the demands.</p>
<p>So you do want universities to have a clear place</p>
<p>where they can invent and research</p>
<p>and not fall behind that they can&rsquo;t motivate students.</p>
<p>Imagine all grad students left to industry like us</p>
<p>or faculty members, which has happened too.</p>
<p>So this is a way that if you&rsquo;re so passionate</p>
<p>about the field where you feel industry and academia</p>
<p>need to work well, this is a great example</p>
<p>and a great way for universities to participate.</p>
<p>So what do you think it takes to build a system</p>
<p>that wins the Alexa Prize?</p>
<p>I think you have to start focusing on aspects of reasoning</p>
<p>that it is, there are still more lookups</p>
<p>of what intents customers asking for</p>
<p>and responding to those rather than really reasoning</p>
<p>about the elements of the conversation.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&rsquo;re playing,</p>
<p>if the conversation is about games</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s about a recent sports event,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much context involved</p>
<p>and you have to understand the entities</p>
<p>that are being mentioned</p>
<p>so that the conversation is coherent</p>
<p>rather than you suddenly just switch to knowing some fact</p>
<p>about a sports entity and you&rsquo;re just relaying that</p>
<p>rather than understanding the true context of the game.</p>
<p>Like if you just said, I learned this fun fact</p>
<p>about Tom Brady rather than really say</p>
<p>how he played the game the previous night,</p>
<p>then the conversation is not really that intelligent.</p>
<p>So you have to go to more reasoning elements</p>
<p>of understanding the context of the dialogue</p>
<p>and giving more appropriate responses,</p>
<p>which tells you that we are still quite far</p>
<p>because a lot of times it&rsquo;s more facts being looked up</p>
<p>and something that&rsquo;s close enough as an answer,</p>
<p>but not really the answer.</p>
<p>So that is where the research needs to go more</p>
<p>and actual true understanding and reasoning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I feel it&rsquo;s a great way to do it</p>
<p>because you have an engaged set of users</p>
<p>working to help these AI advances happen in this case.</p>
<p>You mentioned customers, they&rsquo;re quite a bit,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a skill.</p>
<p>What is the experience for the user that&rsquo;s helping?</p>
<p>So just to clarify, this isn&rsquo;t, as far as I understand,</p>
<p>the Alexa, so this skill is a standalone</p>
<p>for the Alexa Prize.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s focused on the Alexa Prize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not you ordering certain things on Amazon.</p>
<p>Like, oh, we&rsquo;re checking the weather</p>
<p>or playing Spotify, right?</p>
<p>This is a separate skill.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re focused on helping that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, how do people, how do customers think of it?</p>
<p>Are they having fun?</p>
<p>Are they helping teach the system?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the experience like?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s both actually.</p>
<p>And let me tell you how you invoke this skill.</p>
<p>So all you have to say, Alexa, let&rsquo;s chat.</p>
<p>And then the first time you say, Alexa, let&rsquo;s chat,</p>
<p>it comes back with a clear message</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re interacting with one of those</p>
<p>university social bots.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a clear,</p>
<p>so you know exactly how you interact, right?</p>
<p>And that is why it&rsquo;s very transparent.</p>
<p>You are being asked to help, right?</p>
<p>And we have a lot of mechanisms</p>
<p>where as we are in the first phase of feedback phase,</p>
<p>then you send a lot of emails to our customers</p>
<p>and then they know that the team needs a lot of interactions</p>
<p>to improve the accuracy of the system.</p>
<p>So we know we have a lot of customers</p>
<p>who really want to help these university bots</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re conversing with that.</p>
<p>And some are just having fun with just saying,</p>
<p>Alexa, let&rsquo;s chat.</p>
<p>And also some adversarial behavior to see whether,</p>
<p>how much do you understand as a social bot?</p>
<p>So I think we have a good,</p>
<p>healthy mix of all three situations.</p>
<p>So what is the,</p>
<p>if we talk about solving the Alexa challenge,</p>
<p>the Alexa prize,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the data set of really engaging,</p>
<p>pleasant conversations look like?</p>
<p>Because if we think of this</p>
<p>as a supervised learning problem,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it has to be,</p>
<p>but if it does, maybe you can comment on that.</p>
<p>Do you think there needs to be a data set</p>
<p>of what it means to be an engaging, successful,</p>
<p>fulfilling conversation?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of the research question here.</p>
<p>This was, I think, we at least got the first part right,</p>
<p>which is have a way for universities to build</p>
<p>and test in a real world setting.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re asking in terms of the next phase of questions,</p>
<p>which we are still, we&rsquo;re also asking, by the way,</p>
<p>what does success look like from a optimization function?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re asking in terms of,</p>
<p>we as researchers are used to having a great corpus</p>
<p>of annotated data and then making,</p>
<p>then sort of tune our algorithms on those, right?</p>
<p>And fortunately and unfortunately,</p>
<p>in this world of Alexa prize,</p>
<p>that is not the way we are going after it.</p>
<p>So you have to focus more on learning</p>
<p>based on life feedback.</p>
<p>That is another element that&rsquo;s unique,</p>
<p>where just not to,</p>
<p>I started with giving you how you ingress</p>
<p>and experience this capability as a customer.</p>
<p>What happens when you&rsquo;re done?</p>
<p>So they ask you a simple question on a scale of one to five,</p>
<p>how likely are you to interact with this social bot again?</p>
<p>That is a good feedback</p>
<p>and customers can also leave more open ended feedback.</p>
<p>And I think partly that to me</p>
<p>is one part of the question you&rsquo;re asking,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m saying is a mental model shift</p>
<p>that as researchers also,</p>
<p>you have to change your mindset</p>
<p>that this is not a DARPA evaluation or NSF funded study</p>
<p>and you have a nice corpus.</p>
<p>This is where it&rsquo;s real world.</p>
<p>You have real data.</p>
<p>The scale is amazing and that&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>And then the customer,</p>
<p>the user can quit the conversation at any time.</p>
<p>Exactly, the user can,</p>
<p>that is also a signal for how good you were at that point.</p>
<p>So, and then on a scale one to five, one to three,</p>
<p>do they say how likely are you</p>
<p>or is it just a binary?</p>
<p>One to five.</p>
<p>Wow, okay, that&rsquo;s such a beautifully constructed challenge.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You said the only way to make a smart assistant really smart</p>
<p>is to give it eyes and let it explore the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it might&rsquo;ve been taken out of context,</p>
<p>but can you comment on that?</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on that idea?</p>
<p>Is that I personally also find that idea super exciting</p>
<p>from a social robotics, personal robotics perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of things do get taken out of context.</p>
<p>This particular one was just</p>
<p>as philosophical discussion we were having</p>
<p>on terms of what does intelligence look like?</p>
<p>And the context was in terms of learning,</p>
<p>I think just we said we as humans are empowered</p>
<p>with many different sensory abilities.</p>
<p>I do believe that eyes are an important aspect of it</p>
<p>in terms of if you think about how we as humans learn,</p>
<p>it is quite complex and it&rsquo;s also not unimodal</p>
<p>that you are fed a ton of text or audio</p>
<p>and you just learn that way.</p>
<p>No, you learn by experience, you learn by seeing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taught by humans</p>
<p>and we are very efficient in how we learn.</p>
<p>Machines on the contrary are very inefficient</p>
<p>on how they learn, especially these AIs.</p>
<p>I think the next wave of research is going to be</p>
<p>with less data, not just less human,</p>
<p>not just with less labeled data,</p>
<p>but also with a lot of weak supervision</p>
<p>and where you can increase the learning rate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean less data</p>
<p>in terms of not having a lot of data to learn from</p>
<p>that we are generating so much data,</p>
<p>but it is more about from a aspect</p>
<p>of how fast can you learn?</p>
<p>So improving the quality of the data,</p>
<p>the quality of data and the learning process.</p>
<p>I think more on the learning process.</p>
<p>I think we have to, we as humans learn</p>
<p>with a lot of noisy data, right?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the part</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think should change.</p>
<p>What should change is how we learn, right?</p>
<p>So if you look at, you mentioned supervised learning,</p>
<p>we have making transformative shifts</p>
<p>from moving to more unsupervised, more weak supervision.</p>
<p>Those are the key aspects of how to learn.</p>
<p>And I think in that setting, I hope you agree with me</p>
<p>that having other senses is very crucial</p>
<p>in terms of how you learn.</p>
<p>So absolutely.</p>
<p>And from a machine learning perspective,</p>
<p>which I hope we get a chance to talk to a few aspects</p>
<p>that are fascinating there,</p>
<p>but to stick on the point of sort of a body,</p>
<p>an embodiment.</p>
<p>So Alexa has a body.</p>
<p>It has a very minimalistic, beautiful interface</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a ring and so on.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure of all the flavors</p>
<p>of the devices that Alexa lives on,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a minimalistic basic interface.</p>
<p>And nevertheless, we humans, so I have a Roomba,</p>
<p>I have all kinds of robots all over everywhere.</p>
<p>So what do you think the Alexa of the future looks like</p>
<p>if it begins to shift what his body looks like?</p>
<p>Maybe beyond the Alexa,</p>
<p>what do you think are the different devices in the home</p>
<p>as they start to embody their intelligence more and more?</p>
<p>What do you think that looks like?</p>
<p>Philosophically, a future, what do you think that looks like?</p>
<p>I think let&rsquo;s look at what&rsquo;s happening today.</p>
<p>You mentioned, I think our devices as an Amazon devices,</p>
<p>but I also wanted to point out Alexa is already integrated</p>
<p>a lot of third party devices,</p>
<p>which also come in lots of forms and shapes,</p>
<p>some in robots, some in microwaves,</p>
<p>some in appliances that you use in everyday life.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s not just the shape Alexa takes</p>
<p>in terms of form factors,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also where all it&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s getting in cars,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting in different appliances in homes,</p>
<p>even toothbrushes, right?</p>
<p>So I think you have to think about it</p>
<p>as not a physical assistant.</p>
<p>It will be in some embodiment, as you said,</p>
<p>we already have these nice devices,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s also important to think of it,</p>
<p>it is a virtual assistant.</p>
<p>It is superhuman in the sense that it is in multiple places</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>So I think the actual embodiment in some sense,</p>
<p>to me doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I think you have to think of it as not as human like</p>
<p>and more of what its capabilities are</p>
<p>that derive a lot of benefit for customers</p>
<p>and how there are different ways to delight it</p>
<p>and delight customers and different experiences.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m a big fan of it not being just human like,</p>
<p>it should be human like in certain situations.</p>
<p>Alexa price social bot in terms of conversation</p>
<p>is a great way to look at it,</p>
<p>but there are other scenarios where human like,</p>
<p>I think is underselling the abilities of this AI.</p>
<p>So if I could trivialize what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So if you look at the way Steve Jobs thought</p>
<p>about the interaction with the device that Apple produced,</p>
<p>there was a extreme focus on controlling the experience</p>
<p>by making sure there&rsquo;s only this Apple produced devices.</p>
<p>You see the voice of Alexa being taking all kinds of forms</p>
<p>depending on what the customers want.</p>
<p>And that means it could be anywhere</p>
<p>from the microwave to a vacuum cleaner to the home</p>
<p>and so on the voice is the essential element</p>
<p>of the interaction.</p>
<p>I think voice is an essence, it&rsquo;s not all,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a key aspect.</p>
<p>I think to your question in terms of,</p>
<p>you should be able to recognize Alexa</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a huge problem.</p>
<p>I think in terms of a huge scientific problem,</p>
<p>I should say like, what are the traits?</p>
<p>What makes it look like Alexa,</p>
<p>especially in different settings</p>
<p>and especially if it&rsquo;s primarily voice, what it is,</p>
<p>but Alexa is not just voice either, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we have devices with a screen.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re seeing just other behaviors of Alexa.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re in very early stages of what that means</p>
<p>and this will be an important topic for the following years.</p>
<p>But I do believe that being able to recognize</p>
<p>and tell when it&rsquo;s Alexa versus it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>is going to be important from an Alexa perspective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not speaking for the entire AI community,</p>
<p>but I think attribution and as we go into more</p>
<p>of understanding who did what,</p>
<p>that identity of the AI is crucial in the coming world.</p>
<p>I think from the broad AI community perspective,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also a fascinating problem.</p>
<p>So basically if I close my eyes and listen to the voice,</p>
<p>what would it take for me to recognize that this is Alexa?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Or at least the Alexa that I&rsquo;ve come to know</p>
<p>from my personal experience in my home</p>
<p>through my interactions that come through.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the Alexa here in the US is very different</p>
<p>than Alexa in UK and the Alexa in India,</p>
<p>even though they are all speaking English</p>
<p>or the Australian version.</p>
<p>So again, so now think about when you go</p>
<p>into a different culture, a different community,</p>
<p>but you travel there, what do you recognize Alexa?</p>
<p>I think these are super hard questions actually.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a team that works on personality.</p>
<p>So if we talk about those different flavors</p>
<p>of what it means culturally speaking,</p>
<p>India, UK, US, what does it mean to add?</p>
<p>So the problem that we just stated,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just fascinating, how do we make it purely recognizable</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s Alexa, assuming that the qualities</p>
<p>of the voice are not sufficient?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the content of what is being said.</p>
<p>How do we do that?</p>
<p>How does the personality come into play?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that research gonna look like?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s such a fascinating subject.</p>
<p>We have some very fascinating folks</p>
<p>who from both the UX background and human factors</p>
<p>are looking at these aspects and these exact questions.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll definitely say it&rsquo;s not just how it sounds,</p>
<p>the choice of words, the tone, not just, I mean,</p>
<p>the voice identity of it, but the tone matters,</p>
<p>the speed matters, how you speak,</p>
<p>how you enunciate words, what choice of words</p>
<p>are you using, how terse are you,</p>
<p>or how lengthy in your explanations you are.</p>
<p>All of these are factors.</p>
<p>And you also, you mentioned something crucial</p>
<p>that you may have personalized it, Alexa,</p>
<p>to some extent in your homes</p>
<p>or in the devices you are interacting with.</p>
<p>So you, as your individual, how you prefer Alexa sounds</p>
<p>can be different than how I prefer.</p>
<p>And the amount of customizability you want to give</p>
<p>is also a key debate we always have.</p>
<p>But I do want to point out it&rsquo;s more than the voice actor</p>
<p>that recorded and it sounds like that actor.</p>
<p>It is more about the choices of words,</p>
<p>the attributes of tonality, the volume</p>
<p>in terms of how you raise your pitch and so forth.</p>
<p>All of that matters.</p>
<p>This is such a fascinating problem</p>
<p>from a product perspective.</p>
<p>I could see those debates just happening</p>
<p>inside of the Alexa team of how much personalization</p>
<p>do you do for the specific customer?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re taking a risk if you over personalize.</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t, if you create a personality</p>
<p>for a million people, you can test that better.</p>
<p>You can create a rich, fulfilling experience</p>
<p>that will do well.</p>
<p>But the more you personalize it, the less you can test it,</p>
<p>the less you can know that it&rsquo;s a great experience.</p>
<p>So how much personalization, what&rsquo;s the right balance?</p>
<p>I think the right balance depends on the customer.</p>
<p>Give them the control.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll say, I think the more control you give customers,</p>
<p>the better it is for everyone.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you some key personalization features.</p>
<p>I think we have a feature called Remember This,</p>
<p>which is where you can tell Alexa to remember something.</p>
<p>There you have an explicit sort of control</p>
<p>in customer&rsquo;s hand because they have to say,</p>
<p>Alexa, remember X, Y, Z.</p>
<p>What kind of things would that be used for?</p>
<p>So you can like you, I have stored my tire specs</p>
<p>for my car because it&rsquo;s so hard to go and find</p>
<p>and see what it is, right?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re having some issues.</p>
<p>I store my mileage plan numbers</p>
<p>for all the frequent flyer ones</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m sometimes just looking at it and it&rsquo;s not handy.</p>
<p>So those are my own personal choices I&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>for Alexa to remember something on my behalf, right?</p>
<p>So again, I think the choice was be explicit</p>
<p>about how you provide that to a customer as a control.</p>
<p>So I think these are the aspects of what you do.</p>
<p>Like think about where we can use speaker recognition</p>
<p>capabilities that it&rsquo;s, if you taught Alexa</p>
<p>that you are Lex and this person in your household</p>
<p>is person two, then you can personalize the experiences.</p>
<p>Again, these are very in the CX customer experience patterns</p>
<p>are very clear about and transparent</p>
<p>when a personalization action is happening.</p>
<p>And then you have other ways like you go</p>
<p>through explicit control right now through your app</p>
<p>that your multiple service providers,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say for music, which one is your preferred one.</p>
<p>So when you say play sting, depend on your</p>
<p>whether you have preferred Spotify or Amazon music</p>
<p>or Apple music, that the decision is made</p>
<p>where to play it from.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s Alexa&rsquo;s backstory from her perspective?</p>
<p>Is there, I remember just asking as probably a lot</p>
<p>of us are just the basic questions about love</p>
<p>and so on of Alexa, just to see what the answer would be.</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s a little bit of a personality</p>
<p>but not too much.</p>
<p>Is Alexa have a metaphysical presence</p>
<p>in this human universe we live in</p>
<p>or is it something more ambiguous?</p>
<p>Is there a past?</p>
<p>Is there a birth?</p>
<p>Is there a family kind of idea</p>
<p>even for joking purposes and so on?</p>
<p>I think, well, it does tell you if I think you,</p>
<p>I should double check this but if you said</p>
<p>when were you born, I think we do respond.</p>
<p>I need to double check that</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty positive about it.</p>
<p>I think you do actually because I think I&rsquo;ve tested that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like how I was born in your brand of champagne</p>
<p>and whatever the year kind of thing, yeah.</p>
<p>So in terms of the metaphysical, I think it&rsquo;s early.</p>
<p>Does it have the historic knowledge about herself</p>
<p>to be able to do that?</p>
<p>Maybe, have we crossed that boundary?</p>
<p>Not yet, right?</p>
<p>In terms of being, thank you.</p>
<p>Have we thought about it quite a bit</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t say that we have come to a clear decision</p>
<p>in terms of what it should look like.</p>
<p>But you can imagine though, and I bring this back</p>
<p>to the Alexa Prize social bot one,</p>
<p>there you will start seeing some of that.</p>
<p>Like these bots have their identity</p>
<p>and in terms of that, you may find,</p>
<p>this is such a great research topic</p>
<p>that some academia team may think of these problems</p>
<p>and start solving them too.</p>
<p>So let me ask a question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of difficult, I think,</p>
<p>but it feels, and fascinating to me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m fascinated with psychology.</p>
<p>It feels that the more personality you have,</p>
<p>the more dangerous it is</p>
<p>in terms of a customer perspective of product.</p>
<p>If you want to create a product that&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>By dangerous, I mean creating an experience that upsets me.</p>
<p>And so how do you get that right?</p>
<p>Because if you look at the relationships,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m just a screwed up Russian,</p>
<p>but if you look at the human to human relationship,</p>
<p>some of our deepest relationships have fights,</p>
<p>have tension, have the push and pull,</p>
<p>have a little flavor in them.</p>
<p>Do you want to have such flavor in an interaction with Alexa?</p>
<p>How do you think about that?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one other common thing that you didn&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>but we think of it as paramount for any deep relationship.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s trust.</p>
<p>Trust, yeah.</p>
<p>So I think if you trust every attribute you said,</p>
<p>a fight, some tension, is all healthy.</p>
<p>But what is sort of unnegotiable in this instance is trust.</p>
<p>And I think the bar to earn customer trust for AI</p>
<p>is very high, in some sense, more than a human.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about personal information or your data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about your actions on a daily basis.</p>
<p>How trustworthy are you in terms of consistency,</p>
<p>in terms of how accurate are you in understanding me?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re talking to a person on the phone,</p>
<p>if you have a problem with your,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say your internet or something,</p>
<p>if the person&rsquo;s not understanding,</p>
<p>you lose trust right away.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to talk to that person.</p>
<p>That whole example gets amplified by a factor of 10,</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re a human interacting with an AI,</p>
<p>you have a certain expectation.</p>
<p>Either you expect it to be very intelligent</p>
<p>and then you get upset, why is it behaving this way?</p>
<p>Or you expect it to be not so intelligent</p>
<p>and when it surprises you, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>really, you&rsquo;re trying to be too smart?</p>
<p>So I think we grapple with these hard questions as well.</p>
<p>But I think the key is actions need to be trustworthy.</p>
<p>From these AIs, not just about data protection,</p>
<p>your personal information protection,</p>
<p>but also from how accurately it accomplishes</p>
<p>all commands or all interactions.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s tough to hear because trust,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re absolutely right,</p>
<p>but trust is such a high bar with AI systems</p>
<p>because people, and I see this</p>
<p>because I work with autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>I mean, the bar that&rsquo;s placed on AI system</p>
<p>is unreasonably high.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is going to be, I agree with you.</p>
<p>And I think of it as it&rsquo;s a challenge</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also keeps my job, right?</p>
<p>So from that perspective, I totally,</p>
<p>I think of it at both sides as a customer</p>
<p>and as a researcher.</p>
<p>I think as a researcher, yes, occasionally it will frustrate</p>
<p>me that why is the bar so high for these AIs?</p>
<p>And as a customer, then I say,</p>
<p>absolutely, it has to be that high, right?</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the trade off we have to balance,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t change the fundamentals.</p>
<p>That trust has to be earned and the question then becomes</p>
<p>is are we holding the AIs to a different bar</p>
<p>in accuracy and mistakes than we hold humans?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be a great societal questions</p>
<p>for years to come, I think for us.</p>
<p>Well, one of the questions that we grapple as a society now</p>
<p>that I think about a lot,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people in the AI think about a lot</p>
<p>and Alexis taking on head on is privacy.</p>
<p>The reality is us giving over data to any AI system</p>
<p>can be used to enrich our lives in profound ways.</p>
<p>So if basically any product that does anything awesome</p>
<p>for you, the more data it has,</p>
<p>the more awesome things it can do.</p>
<p>And yet on the other side,</p>
<p>people imagine the worst case possible scenario</p>
<p>of what can you possibly do with that data?</p>
<p>People, it&rsquo;s goes down to trust, as you said before.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fundamental distrust of,</p>
<p>in certain groups of governments and so on.</p>
<p>And depending on the government,</p>
<p>depending on who&rsquo;s in power,</p>
<p>depending on all these kinds of factors.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s Alexa in the middle of all of it in the home,</p>
<p>trying to do good things for the customers.</p>
<p>So how do you think about privacy in this context,</p>
<p>the smart assistance in the home?</p>
<p>How do you maintain, how do you earn trust?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So as you said, trust is the key here.</p>
<p>So you start with trust</p>
<p>and then privacy is a key aspect of it.</p>
<p>It has to be designed from very beginning about that.</p>
<p>And we believe in two fundamental principles.</p>
<p>One is transparency and second is control.</p>
<p>So by transparency, I mean,</p>
<p>when we build what is now called smart speaker</p>
<p>or the first echo,</p>
<p>we were quite judicious about making these right trade offs</p>
<p>on customer&rsquo;s behalf,</p>
<p>that it is pretty clear</p>
<p>when the audio is being sent to cloud,</p>
<p>the light ring comes on</p>
<p>when it has heard you say the word wake word,</p>
<p>and then the streaming happens, right?</p>
<p>So when the light ring comes up,</p>
<p>we also had, we put a physical mute button on it,</p>
<p>just so if you didn&rsquo;t want it to be listening,</p>
<p>even for the wake word,</p>
<p>then you turn the power button or the mute button on,</p>
<p>and that disables the microphones.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the first decision on essentially transparency</p>
<p>and control.</p>
<p>Oh, then even when we launched,</p>
<p>we gave the control in the hands of the customers</p>
<p>that you can go and look at any of your individual utterances</p>
<p>that is recorded and delete them anytime.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got to true to that promise, right?</p>
<p>So, and that is super, again,</p>
<p>a great instance of showing how you have the control.</p>
<p>Then we made it even easier.</p>
<p>You can say, like I said, delete what I said today.</p>
<p>So that is now making it even just more control</p>
<p>in your hands with what&rsquo;s most convenient</p>
<p>about this technology is voice.</p>
<p>You delete it with your voice now.</p>
<p>So these are the types of decisions we continually make.</p>
<p>We just recently launched this feature called,</p>
<p>what we think of it as,</p>
<p>if you wanted humans not to review your data,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve mentioned supervised learning, right?</p>
<p>So in supervised learning,</p>
<p>humans have to give some annotation.</p>
<p>And that also is now a feature</p>
<p>where you can essentially, if you&rsquo;ve selected that flag,</p>
<p>your data will not be reviewed by a human.</p>
<p>So these are the types of controls</p>
<p>that we have to constantly offer with customers.</p>
<p>So why do you think it bothers people so much that,</p>
<p>so everything you just said is really powerful.</p>
<p>So the control, the ability to delete,</p>
<p>cause we collect, we have studies here running at MIT</p>
<p>that collects huge amounts of data</p>
<p>and people consent and so on.</p>
<p>The ability to delete that data is really empowering</p>
<p>and almost nobody ever asked to delete it,</p>
<p>but the ability to have that control is really powerful.</p>
<p>But still, there&rsquo;s these popular anecdote,</p>
<p>anecdotal evidence that people say,</p>
<p>they like to tell that,</p>
<p>them and a friend were talking about something,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, sweaters for cats.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden they&rsquo;ll have advertisements</p>
<p>for cat sweaters on Amazon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a popular anecdote</p>
<p>as if something is always listening.</p>
<p>What, can you explain that anecdote,</p>
<p>that experience that people have?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the psychology of that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that experience?</p>
<p>And can you, you&rsquo;ve answered it,</p>
<p>but let me just ask, is Alexa listening?</p>
<p>No, Alexa listens only for the wake word on the device.</p>
<p>And the wake word is?</p>
<p>The words like Alexa, Amazon, Echo,</p>
<p>but you only choose one at a time.</p>
<p>So you choose one and it listens only</p>
<p>for that on our devices.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s first.</p>
<p>From a listening perspective,</p>
<p>we have to be very clear that it&rsquo;s just the wake word.</p>
<p>So you said, why is there this anxiety, if you may?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion,</p>
<p>what it really listens to, right?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s partly on us to keep educating</p>
<p>our customers and the general media more</p>
<p>in terms of like how, what really happens.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done a lot of it.</p>
<p>And our pages on information are clear,</p>
<p>but still people have to have more,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a hunger for information and clarity.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll constantly look at how best to communicate.</p>
<p>If you go back and read everything,</p>
<p>yes, it states exactly that.</p>
<p>And then people could still question it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s absolutely okay to question.</p>
<p>What we have to make sure is that we are,</p>
<p>because our fundamental philosophy is customer first,</p>
<p>customer obsession is our leadership principle.</p>
<p>If you put, as researchers, I put myself</p>
<p>in the shoes of the customer,</p>
<p>and all decisions in Amazon are made with that.</p>
<p>And trust has to be earned,</p>
<p>and we have to keep earning the trust</p>
<p>of our customers in this setting.</p>
<p>And to your other point on like,</p>
<p>is there something showing up</p>
<p>based on your conversations?</p>
<p>No, I think the answer is like,</p>
<p>a lot of times when those experiences happen,</p>
<p>you have to also know that, okay,</p>
<p>it may be a winter season,</p>
<p>people are looking for sweaters, right?</p>
<p>And it shows up on your amazon.com because it is popular.</p>
<p>So there are many of these,</p>
<p>you mentioned that personality or personalization,</p>
<p>turns out we are not that unique either, right?</p>
<p>So those things we as humans start thinking,</p>
<p>oh, must be because something was heard,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why this other thing showed up.</p>
<p>The answer is no,</p>
<p>probably it is just the season for sweaters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna ask you this question</p>
<p>because people have so much paranoia.</p>
<p>But let me just say from my perspective,</p>
<p>I hope there&rsquo;s a day when customer can ask Alexa</p>
<p>to listen all the time,</p>
<p>to improve the experience,</p>
<p>to improve because I personally don&rsquo;t see the negative</p>
<p>because if you have the control and if you have the trust,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t be listening</p>
<p>all the time to the conversations to learn more about you.</p>
<p>Because ultimately,</p>
<p>as long as you have control and trust,</p>
<p>every data you provide to the device,</p>
<p>that the device wants is going to be useful.</p>
<p>And so to me, as a machine learning person,</p>
<p>I think it worries me how sensitive people are</p>
<p>about their data relative to how empowering it could be</p>
<p>relative to how empowering it could be</p>
<p>for the devices around them,</p>
<p>how enriching it could be for their own life</p>
<p>to improve the product.</p>
<p>So I just, it&rsquo;s something I think about sort of a lot,</p>
<p>how do we make that devices,</p>
<p>obviously Alexa thinks about a lot as well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you wanna comment on that,</p>
<p>sort of, okay, have you seen,</p>
<p>let me ask it in the form of a question, okay.</p>
<p>Have you seen an evolution in the way people think about</p>
<p>their private data in the previous several years?</p>
<p>So as we as a society get more and more comfortable</p>
<p>to the benefits we get by sharing more data.</p>
<p>First, let me answer that part</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll wanna go back</p>
<p>to the other aspect you were mentioning.</p>
<p>So as a society, on a general,</p>
<p>we are getting more comfortable as a society.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone is,</p>
<p>and I think we have to respect that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think one size fits all</p>
<p>is always gonna be the answer for all, right?</p>
<p>By definition.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s something to keep in mind in these.</p>
<p>Going back to your, on what more</p>
<p>magical experiences can be launched</p>
<p>in these kinds of AI settings.</p>
<p>I think again, if you give the control,</p>
<p>we, it&rsquo;s possible certain parts of it.</p>
<p>So we have a feature called follow up mode</p>
<p>where you, if you turn it on</p>
<p>and Alexa, after you&rsquo;ve spoken to it,</p>
<p>will open the mics again,</p>
<p>thinking you will answer something again.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re adding lists to your shopping item,</p>
<p>so right, or a shopping list or to do list,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not done.</p>
<p>You want to keep, so in that setting,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awesome that it opens the mic</p>
<p>for you to say eggs and milk and then bread, right?</p>
<p>So these are the kinds of things which you can empower.</p>
<p>So, and then another feature we have,</p>
<p>which is called Alexa Guard.</p>
<p>I said it only listens for the wake word, right?</p>
<p>But if you have, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re going to say,</p>
<p>like you leave your home and you want Alexa to listen</p>
<p>for a couple of sound events like smoke alarm going off</p>
<p>or someone breaking your glass, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like just to keep your peace of mind.</p>
<p>So you can say Alexa on guard or I&rsquo;m away</p>
<p>and then it can be listening for these sound events.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re home, you come out of that mode, right?</p>
<p>So this is another one where you again gave controls</p>
<p>in the hands of the user or the customer</p>
<p>and to enable some experience that is high utility</p>
<p>and maybe even more delightful in the certain settings</p>
<p>like follow up mode and so forth.</p>
<p>And again, this general principle is the same,</p>
<p>control in the hands of the customer.</p>
<p>So I know we kind of started with a lot of philosophy</p>
<p>and a lot of interesting topics</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just jumping all over the place,</p>
<p>but really some of the fascinating things</p>
<p>that the Alexa team and Amazon is doing</p>
<p>is in the algorithm side, the data side,</p>
<p>the technology, the deep learning, machine learning</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So can you give a brief history of Alexa</p>
<p>from the perspective of just innovation,</p>
<p>the algorithms, the data of how it was born,</p>
<p>how it came to be, how it&rsquo;s grown, where it is today?</p>
<p>Yeah, it start with in Amazon,</p>
<p>everything starts with the customer</p>
<p>and we have a process called working backwards.</p>
<p>Alexa and more specifically than the product Echo,</p>
<p>there was a working backwards document essentially</p>
<p>that reflected what it would be,</p>
<p>started with a very simple vision statement for instance</p>
<p>that morphed into a full fledged document</p>
<p>along the way changed into what all it can do, right?</p>
<p>But the inspiration was the Star Trek computer.</p>
<p>So when you think of it that way,</p>
<p>everything is possible, but when you launch a product,</p>
<p>you have to start with some place.</p>
<p>And when I joined, the product was already in conception</p>
<p>and we started working on the far field speech recognition</p>
<p>because that was the first thing to solve.</p>
<p>By that we mean that you should be able to speak</p>
<p>to the device from a distance.</p>
<p>And in those days, that wasn&rsquo;t a common practice.</p>
<p>And even in the previous research world I was in</p>
<p>was considered to an unsolvable problem then</p>
<p>in terms of whether you can converse from a length.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m still talking about the first part</p>
<p>of the problem where you say,</p>
<p>get the attention of the device</p>
<p>as in by saying what we call the wake word,</p>
<p>which means the word Alexa has to be detected</p>
<p>with a very high accuracy because it is a very common word.</p>
<p>It has sound units that map with words like I like you</p>
<p>or Alec, Alex, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a undoubtedly hard problem to detect</p>
<p>the right mentions of Alexa&rsquo;s address to the device</p>
<p>versus I like Alexa.</p>
<p>So you have to pick up that signal</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a lot of noise.</p>
<p>Not only noise but a lot of conversation in the house,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You remember on the device,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re simply listening for the wake word, Alexa.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of words being spoken in the house.</p>
<p>How do you know it&rsquo;s Alexa and directed at Alexa?</p>
<p>Because I could say, I love my Alexa, I hate my Alexa.</p>
<p>I want Alexa to do this.</p>
<p>And in all these three sentences, I said, Alexa,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want it to wake up.</p>
<p>Can I just pause on that second?</p>
<p>What would be your device that I should probably</p>
<p>in the introduction of this conversation give to people</p>
<p>in terms of them turning off their Alexa device</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re listening to this podcast conversation out loud?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the probability that an Alexa device</p>
<p>will go off because we mentioned Alexa like a million times.</p>
<p>So it will, we have done a lot of different things</p>
<p>where we can figure out that there is the device,</p>
<p>the speech is coming from a human versus over the air.</p>
<p>Also, I mean, in terms of like, also it is think about ads</p>
<p>or so we have also launched a technology</p>
<p>for watermarking kind of approaches</p>
<p>in terms of filtering it out.</p>
<p>But yes, if this kind of a podcast is happening,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible your device will wake up a few times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unsolved problem,</p>
<p>but it is definitely something we care very much about.</p>
<p>But the idea is you wanna detect Alexa.</p>
<p>Meant for the device.</p>
<p>First of all, just even hearing Alexa versus I like something.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a fascinating part.</p>
<p>So that was the first relief.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s best detector of Alexa.</p>
<p>Yeah, the world&rsquo;s best wake word detector</p>
<p>in a far field setting,</p>
<p>not like something where the phone is sitting on the table.</p>
<p>This is like people have devices 40 feet away</p>
<p>like in my house or 20 feet away and you still get an answer.</p>
<p>So that was the first part.</p>
<p>The next is, okay, you&rsquo;re speaking to the device.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re gonna issue many different requests.</p>
<p>Some may be simple, some may be extremely hard,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a large vocabulary speech recognition problem</p>
<p>essentially, where the audio is now not coming</p>
<p>onto your phone or a handheld mic like this</p>
<p>or a close talking mic, but it&rsquo;s from 20 feet away</p>
<p>where if you&rsquo;re in a busy household,</p>
<p>your son may be listening to music,</p>
<p>your daughter may be running around with something</p>
<p>and asking your mom something and so forth, right?</p>
<p>So this is like a common household setting</p>
<p>where the words you&rsquo;re speaking to Alexa</p>
<p>need to be recognized with very high accuracy, right?</p>
<p>Now we are still just in the recognition problem.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t yet come to the understanding one, right?</p>
<p>And if I pause them, sorry, once again,</p>
<p>what year was this?</p>
<p>Is this before neural networks began to start</p>
<p>to seriously prove themselves in the audio space?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is around, so I joined in 2013 in April, right?</p>
<p>So the early research and neural networks coming back</p>
<p>and showing some promising results</p>
<p>in speech recognition space had started happening,</p>
<p>but it was very early.</p>
<p>But we just now build on that</p>
<p>on the very first thing we did when I joined with the team.</p>
<p>And remember, it was a very much of a startup environment,</p>
<p>which is great about Amazon.</p>
<p>And we doubled down on deep learning right away.</p>
<p>And we knew we&rsquo;ll have to improve accuracy fast.</p>
<p>And because of that, we worked on,</p>
<p>and the scale of data, once you have a device like this,</p>
<p>if it is successful, will improve big time.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ll suddenly have large volumes of data</p>
<p>to learn from to make the customer experience better.</p>
<p>So how do you scale deep learning?</p>
<p>So we did one of the first works</p>
<p>in training with distributed GPUs</p>
<p>and where the training time was linear</p>
<p>in terms of the amount of data.</p>
<p>So that was quite important work</p>
<p>where it was algorithmic improvements</p>
<p>as well as a lot of engineering improvements</p>
<p>to be able to train on thousands and thousands of speech.</p>
<p>And that was an important factor.</p>
<p>So if you ask me like back in 2013 and 2014,</p>
<p>when we launched Echo,</p>
<p>the combination of large scale data,</p>
<p>deep learning progress, near infinite GPUs</p>
<p>we had available on AWS even then,</p>
<p>was all came together for us to be able</p>
<p>to solve the far field speech recognition</p>
<p>to the extent it could be useful to the customers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still not solved.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, it&rsquo;s not that we are perfect</p>
<p>at recognizing speech, but we are great at it</p>
<p>in terms of the settings that are in homes, right?</p>
<p>So, and that was important even in the early stages.</p>
<p>So first of all, just even,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to look back at that time.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly,</p>
<p>it was, it seems like the task would be pretty daunting.</p>
<p>So like, so we kind of take it for granted</p>
<p>that it works now.</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So let me, like how, first of all, you mentioned startup.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t familiar how big the team was.</p>
<p>I kind of, cause I know there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of really smart people working on it.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s a very, very large team.</p>
<p>How big was the team?</p>
<p>How likely were you to fail in the eyes of everyone else?</p>
<p>And ourselves?</p>
<p>And yourself?</p>
<p>So like what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a very interesting anecdote on that.</p>
<p>When I joined the team,</p>
<p>the speech recognition team was six people.</p>
<p>My first meeting, and we had hired a few more people,</p>
<p>it was 10 people.</p>
<p>Nine out of 10 people thought it can&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>Who was the one?</p>
<p>The one was me, say, actually I should say,</p>
<p>and one was semi optimistic.</p>
<p>And eight were trying to convince,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to the management and say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not work on this problem.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s work on some other problem,</p>
<p>like either telephony speech for customer service calls</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>But this was the kind of belief you must have.</p>
<p>And I had experience with far field speech recognition</p>
<p>and my eyes lit up when I saw a problem like that saying,</p>
<p>okay, we have been in speech recognition,</p>
<p>always looking for that killer app.</p>
<p>And this was a killer use case</p>
<p>to bring something delightful in the hands of customers.</p>
<p>So you mentioned the way you kind of think of it</p>
<p>in the product way in the future,</p>
<p>have a press release and an FAQ and you think backwards.</p>
<p>Did you have, did the team have the echo in mind?</p>
<p>So this far field speech recognition,</p>
<p>actually putting a thing in the home that works,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s able to interact with,</p>
<p>was that the press release?</p>
<p>What was the?</p>
<p>The way close, I would say, in terms of the,</p>
<p>as I said, the vision was start a computer, right?</p>
<p>Or the inspiration.</p>
<p>And from there, I can&rsquo;t divulge</p>
<p>all the exact specifications,</p>
<p>but one of the first things that was magical on Alexa</p>
<p>was music.</p>
<p>It brought me to back to music</p>
<p>because my taste was still in when I was an undergrad.</p>
<p>So I still listened to those songs and I,</p>
<p>it was too hard for me to be a music fan with a phone, right?</p>
<p>So I, and I don&rsquo;t, I hate things in my ears.</p>
<p>So from that perspective, it was quite hard</p>
<p>and music was part of the,</p>
<p>at least the documents I have seen, right?</p>
<p>So from that perspective, I think, yes,</p>
<p>in terms of how far are we from the original vision?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t reveal that, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I have done a fun at work</p>
<p>because every day we go in and thinking like,</p>
<p>these are the new set of challenges to solve.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great way to do great engineering</p>
<p>as you think of the press release.</p>
<p>I like that idea actually.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll talk about it a bit later,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just a super nice way to have a focus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you this, you&rsquo;re a scientist</p>
<p>and a lot of my scientists have adopted that.</p>
<p>They have now, they love it as a process</p>
<p>because it was very, as scientists,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trained to write great papers,</p>
<p>but they are all after you&rsquo;ve done the research</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve proven that and your PhD dissertation proposal</p>
<p>is something that comes closest</p>
<p>or a DARPA proposal or a NSF proposal</p>
<p>is the closest that comes to a press release.</p>
<p>But that process is now ingrained in our scientists,</p>
<p>which is like delightful for me to see.</p>
<p>You write the paper first and then make it happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>State of the art results.</p>
<p>Or you leave the results section open</p>
<p>where you have a thesis about here&rsquo;s what I expect, right?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what it will change, right?</p>
<p>So I think it is a great thing.</p>
<p>It works for researchers as well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So far field recognition.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What was the big leap?</p>
<p>What were the breakthroughs</p>
<p>and what was that journey like to today?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the, as you said first,</p>
<p>there was a lot of skepticism</p>
<p>on whether far field speech recognition</p>
<p>will ever work to be good enough, right?</p>
<p>And what we first did was got a lot of training data</p>
<p>in a far field setting.</p>
<p>And that was extremely hard to get</p>
<p>because none of it existed.</p>
<p>So how do you collect data in far field setup, right?</p>
<p>With no customer base at this time.</p>
<p>With no customer base, right?</p>
<p>So that was first innovation.</p>
<p>And once we had that, the next thing was,</p>
<p>okay, if you have the data,</p>
<p>first of all, we didn&rsquo;t talk about like,</p>
<p>what would magical mean in this kind of a setting?</p>
<p>What is good enough for customers, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always, since you&rsquo;ve never done this before,</p>
<p>what would be magical?</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t just a research problem.</p>
<p>You had to put some in terms of accuracy</p>
<p>and customer experience features,</p>
<p>some stakes on the ground saying,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where I think it should get to.</p>
<p>So you established a bar</p>
<p>and then how do you measure progress</p>
<p>towards given you have no customer right now.</p>
<p>So from that perspective, we went,</p>
<p>so first was the data without customers.</p>
<p>Second was doubling down on deep learning</p>
<p>as a way to learn.</p>
<p>And I can just tell you that the combination of the two</p>
<p>got our error rates by a factor of five.</p>
<p>From where we were when I started</p>
<p>to within six months of having that data,</p>
<p>we, at that point, I got the conviction</p>
<p>that this will work, right?</p>
<p>So, because that was magical</p>
<p>in terms of when it started working and.</p>
<p>That reached the magical bar.</p>
<p>That came close to the magical bar.</p>
<p>To the bar, right?</p>
<p>That we felt would be where people will use it.</p>
<p>That was critical.</p>
<p>Because you really have one chance at this.</p>
<p>If we had launched in November 2014 is when we launched,</p>
<p>if it was below the bar,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this category exists</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t meet the bar.</p>
<p>Yeah, and just having looked at voice based interactions</p>
<p>like in the car or earlier systems,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a source of huge frustration for people.</p>
<p>In fact, we use voice based interaction</p>
<p>for collecting data on subjects to measure frustration.</p>
<p>So, as a training set for computer vision,</p>
<p>for face data, so we can get a data set</p>
<p>of frustrated people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to get frustrated people</p>
<p>is having them interact with a voice based system</p>
<p>in the car.</p>
<p>So, that bar I imagine is pretty high.</p>
<p>It was very high.</p>
<p>And we talked about how also errors are perceived</p>
<p>from AIs versus errors by humans.</p>
<p>But we are not done with the problems that ended up,</p>
<p>we had to solve to get it to launch.</p>
<p>So, do you want the next one?</p>
<p>Yeah, the next one.</p>
<p>So, the next one was what I think of as</p>
<p>multi domain natural language understanding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, I wouldn&rsquo;t say easy,</p>
<p>but it is during those days,</p>
<p>solving it, understanding in one domain,</p>
<p>a narrow domain was doable,</p>
<p>but for these multiple domains like music,</p>
<p>like information, other kinds of household productivity,</p>
<p>alarms, timers, even though it wasn&rsquo;t as big as it is</p>
<p>in terms of the number of skills Alexa has</p>
<p>and the confusion space has like grown</p>
<p>by three orders of magnitude,</p>
<p>it was still daunting even those days.</p>
<p>And again, no customer base yet.</p>
<p>Again, no customer base.</p>
<p>So, now you&rsquo;re looking at meaning understanding</p>
<p>and intent understanding and taking actions</p>
<p>on behalf of customers.</p>
<p>Based on their requests.</p>
<p>And that is the next hard problem.</p>
<p>Even if you have gotten the words recognized,</p>
<p>how do you make sense of them?</p>
<p>In those days, there was still a lot of emphasis</p>
<p>on rule based systems for writing grammar patterns</p>
<p>to understand the intent.</p>
<p>But we had a statistical first approach even then,</p>
<p>where for our language understanding we had,</p>
<p>and even those starting days,</p>
<p>an entity recognizer and an intent classifier,</p>
<p>which was all trained statistically.</p>
<p>In fact, we had to build the deterministic matching</p>
<p>as a follow up to fix bugs that statistical models have.</p>
<p>So, it was just a different mindset</p>
<p>where we focused on data driven statistical understanding.</p>
<p>It wins in the end if you have a huge data set.</p>
<p>Yes, it is contingent on that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it came back to how do you get the data.</p>
<p>Before customers, the fact that this is why data</p>
<p>becomes crucial to get to the point</p>
<p>that you have the understanding system built up.</p>
<p>And notice that for you,</p>
<p>we were talking about human machine dialogue,</p>
<p>and even those early days,</p>
<p>even it was very much transactional,</p>
<p>do one thing, one shot utterances in great way.</p>
<p>There was a lot of debate on how much should Alexa talk back</p>
<p>in terms of if you misunderstood it.</p>
<p>If you misunderstood you or you said play songs by the stones,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say it doesn&rsquo;t know early days,</p>
<p>knowledge can be sparse, who are the stones?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want the match to be Stone Temple Pilots</p>
<p>or Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>So, you don&rsquo;t know which one it is.</p>
<p>So, these kind of other signals,</p>
<p>now there we had great assets from Amazon in terms of&hellip;</p>
<p>UX, like what is it, what kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, how do you solve that problem?</p>
<p>In terms of what we think of it</p>
<p>as an entity resolution problem, right?</p>
<p>So, because which one is it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, even if you figured out the stones as an entity,</p>
<p>you have to resolve it to whether it&rsquo;s the stones</p>
<p>or the Stone Temple Pilots or some other stones.</p>
<p>Maybe I misunderstood, is the resolution</p>
<p>the job of the algorithm or is the job of UX</p>
<p>communicating with the human to help the resolution?</p>
<p>Well, there is both, right?</p>
<p>It is, you want 90% or high 90s to be done</p>
<p>without any further questioning or UX, right?</p>
<p>So, but it&rsquo;s absolutely okay, just like as humans,</p>
<p>we ask the question, I didn&rsquo;t understand you, Lex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine for Alexa to occasionally say,</p>
<p>I did not understand you, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an important way to learn.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll talk about where we have come</p>
<p>with more self learning with these kind of feedback signals.</p>
<p>But in those days, just solving the ability</p>
<p>of understanding the intent and resolving to an action</p>
<p>where action could be play a particular artist</p>
<p>or a particular song was super hard.</p>
<p>Again, the bar was high as we were talking about, right?</p>
<p>So, while we launched it in sort of 13 big domains,</p>
<p>I would say in terms of,</p>
<p>we think of it as 13, the big skills we had,</p>
<p>like music is a massive one when we launched it.</p>
<p>And now we have 90,000 plus skills on Alexa.</p>
<p>So, what are the big skills?</p>
<p>Can you just go over them?</p>
<p>Because the only thing I use it for</p>
<p>is music, weather and shopping.</p>
<p>So, we think of it as music information, right?</p>
<p>So, weather is a part of information, right?</p>
<p>So, when we launched, we didn&rsquo;t have smart home,</p>
<p>but within, by smart home I mean,</p>
<p>you connect your smart devices,</p>
<p>you control them with voice.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t done it, it&rsquo;s worth,</p>
<p>it will change your life.</p>
<p>Like turning on the lights and so on.</p>
<p>Turning on your light to anything that&rsquo;s connected</p>
<p>and has a, it&rsquo;s just that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite smart device for you?</p>
<p>My light.</p>
<p>Light.</p>
<p>And now you have the smart plug with,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t, we also have this echo plug, which is.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, you can plug in anything.</p>
<p>You can plug in anything</p>
<p>and now you can turn that one on and off.</p>
<p>I use this conversation motivation to get one.</p>
<p>Garage door, you can check your status of the garage door</p>
<p>and things like, and we have gone,</p>
<p>make Alexa more and more proactive,</p>
<p>where it even has hunches now,</p>
<p>that, oh, looks, hunches, like you left your light on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve gone to your bed</p>
<p>and you left the garage light on.</p>
<p>So it will help you out in these settings, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s smart devices, information, smart devices.</p>
<p>You said music.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don&rsquo;t remember everything we had,</p>
<p>but alarms, timers were the big ones.</p>
<p>Like that was, you know,</p>
<p>the timers were very popular right away.</p>
<p>Music also, like you could play song, artist, album,</p>
<p>everything, and so that was like a clear win</p>
<p>in terms of the customer experience.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, again, this is language understanding.</p>
<p>Now things have evolved, right?</p>
<p>So where we want Alexa definitely to be more accurate,</p>
<p>competent, trustworthy,</p>
<p>based on how well it does these core things,</p>
<p>but we have evolved in many different dimensions.</p>
<p>First is what I think of are doing more conversational</p>
<p>for high utility, not just for chat, right?</p>
<p>And there at Remars this year, which is our AI conference,</p>
<p>we launched what is called Alexa Conversations.</p>
<p>That is providing the ability for developers</p>
<p>to author multi turn experiences on Alexa</p>
<p>with no code, essentially,</p>
<p>in terms of the dialogue code.</p>
<p>Initially it was like, you know, all these IVR systems,</p>
<p>you have to fully author if the customer says this,</p>
<p>do that, right?</p>
<p>So the whole dialogue flow is hand authored.</p>
<p>And with Alexa Conversations,</p>
<p>the way it is that you just provide</p>
<p>a sample interaction data with your service or your API,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say your Atom tickets that provides a service</p>
<p>for buying movie tickets.</p>
<p>You provide a few examples of how your customers</p>
<p>will interact with your APIs.</p>
<p>And then the dialogue flow is automatically constructed</p>
<p>using a record neural network trained on that data.</p>
<p>So that simplifies the developer experience.</p>
<p>We just launched our preview for the developers</p>
<p>to try this capability out.</p>
<p>And then the second part of it,</p>
<p>which shows even increased utility for customers</p>
<p>is you and I, when we interact with Alexa or any customer,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m coming back to our initial part of the conversation,</p>
<p>the goal is often unclear or unknown to the AI.</p>
<p>If I say, Alexa, what movies are playing nearby?</p>
<p>Am I trying to just buy movie tickets?</p>
<p>Am I actually even,</p>
<p>do you think I&rsquo;m looking for just movies for curiosity,</p>
<p>whether the Avengers is still in theater or when is it?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s gone and maybe it will come on my missed it.</p>
<p>So I may watch it on Prime, right?</p>
<p>Which happened to me.</p>
<p>So from that perspective now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking into what is my goal?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say I now complete the movie ticket purchase.</p>
<p>Maybe I would like to get dinner nearby.</p>
<p>So what is really the goal here?</p>
<p>Is it night out or is it movies?</p>
<p>As in just go watch a movie?</p>
<p>The answer is, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So can Alexa now figuratively have the intelligence</p>
<p>that I think this meta goal is really night out</p>
<p>or at least say to the customer</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve completed the purchase of movie tickets</p>
<p>from Atom tickets or Fandango,</p>
<p>or pick your anyone.</p>
<p>Then the next thing is,</p>
<p>do you want to get an Uber to the theater, right?</p>
<p>Or do you want to book a restaurant next to it?</p>
<p>And then not ask the same information over and over again,</p>
<p>what time, how many people in your party, right?</p>
<p>So this is where you shift the cognitive burden</p>
<p>from the customer to the AI.</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s thinking of what is your,</p>
<p>it anticipates your goal</p>
<p>and takes the next best action to complete it.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s the machine learning problem.</p>
<p>But essentially the way we solve this first instance,</p>
<p>and we have a long way to go to make it scale</p>
<p>to everything possible in the world.</p>
<p>But at least for this situation,</p>
<p>it is from at every instance,</p>
<p>Alexa is making the determination,</p>
<p>whether it should stick with the experience</p>
<p>with Atom tickets or not.</p>
<p>Or offer you based on what you say,</p>
<p>whether either you have completed the interaction,</p>
<p>or you said, no, get me an Uber now.</p>
<p>So it will shift context into another experience or skill</p>
<p>or another service.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a dynamic decision making.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s making Alexa, you can say more conversational</p>
<p>for the benefit of the customer,</p>
<p>rather than simply complete transactions,</p>
<p>which are well thought through.</p>
<p>You as a customer has fully specified</p>
<p>what you want to be accomplished.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s accomplishing that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of as we do this with pedestrians,</p>
<p>like intent modeling is predicting</p>
<p>what your possible goals are and what&rsquo;s the most likely goal</p>
<p>and switching that depending on the things you say.</p>
<p>So my question is there,</p>
<p>it seems maybe it&rsquo;s a dumb question,</p>
<p>but it would help a lot if Alexa remembered me,</p>
<p>what I said previously.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Is it trying to use some memories for the customer?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is using a lot of memory within that.</p>
<p>So right now, not so much in terms of,</p>
<p>okay, which restaurant do you prefer, right?</p>
<p>That is a more longterm memory,</p>
<p>but within the short term memory, within the session,</p>
<p>it is remembering how many people did you,</p>
<p>so if you said buy four tickets,</p>
<p>now it has made an implicit assumption</p>
<p>that you were gonna have,</p>
<p>you need at least four seats at a restaurant, right?</p>
<p>So these are the kind of context it&rsquo;s preserving</p>
<p>between these skills, but within that session.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re asking the right question</p>
<p>in terms of for it to be more and more useful,</p>
<p>it has to have more longterm memory</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s also an open question</p>
<p>and again, these are still early days.</p>
<p>So for me, I mean, everybody&rsquo;s different,</p>
<p>but yeah, I&rsquo;m definitely not representative</p>
<p>of the general population in the sense</p>
<p>that I do the same thing every day.</p>
<p>Like I eat the same,</p>
<p>I do everything the same, the same thing,</p>
<p>wear the same thing clearly, this or the black shirt.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s frustrating when Alexa doesn&rsquo;t get what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>because I have to correct her every time</p>
<p>in the exact same way.</p>
<p>This has to do with certain songs,</p>
<p>like she doesn&rsquo;t know certain weird songs I like</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve complained to Spotify about this,</p>
<p>talked to the RD, head of RD at Spotify,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s their way to heaven.</p>
<p>I have to correct it every time.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t play Led Zeppelin correctly.</p>
<p>It plays cover of Led&rsquo;s of Stairway to Heaven.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m.</p>
<p>You should figure, you should send me your,</p>
<p>next time it fails, feel free to send it to me,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll take care of it.</p>
<p>Okay, well.</p>
<p>Because Led Zeppelin is one of my favorite brands,</p>
<p>it works for me, so I&rsquo;m like shocked it doesn&rsquo;t work for you.</p>
<p>This is an official bug report.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put it, I&rsquo;ll make it public,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make everybody retweet it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna fix the Stairway to Heaven problem.</p>
<p>Anyway, but the point is,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m pretty boring and do the same things,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure most people do the same set of things.</p>
<p>Do you see Alexa sort of utilizing that in the future</p>
<p>for improving the experience?</p>
<p>Yes, and not only utilizing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already doing some of it.</p>
<p>We call it, where Alexa is becoming more self learning.</p>
<p>So, Alexa is now auto correcting millions and millions</p>
<p>of utterances in the US</p>
<p>without any human supervision involved.</p>
<p>The way it does it is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take an example of a particular song</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work for you.</p>
<p>What do you do next?</p>
<p>You either it played the wrong song</p>
<p>and you said, Alexa, no, that&rsquo;s not the song I want.</p>
<p>Or you say, Alexa play that, you try it again.</p>
<p>And that is a signal to Alexa</p>
<p>that she may have done something wrong.</p>
<p>And from that perspective,</p>
<p>we can learn if there&rsquo;s that failure pattern</p>
<p>or that action of song A was played</p>
<p>when song B was requested.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very common with station names</p>
<p>because play NPR, you can have N be confused as an M.</p>
<p>And then you, for a certain accent like mine,</p>
<p>people confuse my N and M all the time.</p>
<p>And because I have a Indian accent,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re confusable to humans.</p>
<p>It is for Alexa too.</p>
<p>And in that part, but it starts auto correcting</p>
<p>and we collect, we correct a lot of these automatically</p>
<p>without a human looking at the failures.</p>
<p>So one of the things that&rsquo;s for me missing in Alexa,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m a representative customer,</p>
<p>but every time I correct it,</p>
<p>it would be nice to know that that made a difference.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like the sort of like, I heard you like a sort of.</p>
<p>Some acknowledgement of that.</p>
<p>We work a lot with Tesla, we study autopilot and so on.</p>
<p>And a large amount of the customers</p>
<p>that use Tesla autopilot,</p>
<p>they feel like they&rsquo;re always teaching the system.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re almost excited</p>
<p>by the possibility that they&rsquo;re teaching.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Alexa customers generally think of it</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re teaching to improve the system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really powerful thing.</p>
<p>Again, I would say it&rsquo;s a spectrum.</p>
<p>Some customers do think that way</p>
<p>and some would be annoyed by Alexa acknowledging that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, again, no one,</p>
<p>while there are certain patterns,</p>
<p>not everyone is the same in this way.</p>
<p>But we believe that, again, customers helping Alexa</p>
<p>is a tenet for us in terms of improving it.</p>
<p>And some more self learning is by, again,</p>
<p>this is like fully unsupervised, right?</p>
<p>There is no human in the loop and no labeling happening.</p>
<p>And based on your actions as a customer,</p>
<p>Alexa becomes smarter.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s early days,</p>
<p>but I think this whole area of teachable AI</p>
<p>is gonna get bigger and bigger in the whole space,</p>
<p>especially in the AI assistant space.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the second part</p>
<p>where I mentioned more conversational.</p>
<p>This is more self learning.</p>
<p>The third is more natural.</p>
<p>And the way I think of more natural</p>
<p>is we talked about how Alexa sounds.</p>
<p>And we have done a lot of advances in our text to speech</p>
<p>by using, again, neural network technology</p>
<p>for it to sound very humanlike.</p>
<p>From the individual texture of the sound to the timing,</p>
<p>the tonality, the tone, everything, the whole thing.</p>
<p>I would think in terms of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of controls in each of the places</p>
<p>for how, I mean, the speed of the voice,</p>
<p>the prosthetic patterns,</p>
<p>the actual smoothness of how it sounds,</p>
<p>all of those are factored</p>
<p>and we do a ton of listening tests to make sure.</p>
<p>But naturalness, how it sounds should be very natural.</p>
<p>How it understands requests is also very important.</p>
<p>And in terms of, we have 95,000 skills.</p>
<p>And if we have, imagine that in many of these skills,</p>
<p>you have to remember the skill name</p>
<p>and say, Alexa, ask the tide skill to tell me X.</p>
<p>Now, if you have to remember the skill name,</p>
<p>that means the discovery and the interaction is unnatural.</p>
<p>And we are trying to solve that</p>
<p>by what we think of as, again,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to have the app metaphor here.</p>
<p>These are not individual apps, right?</p>
<p>Even though they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not sort of opening one at a time and interacting.</p>
<p>So it should be seamless because it&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s voice,</p>
<p>you have to be able to understand these requests</p>
<p>independent of the specificity, like a skill name.</p>
<p>And to do that,</p>
<p>what we have done is again,</p>
<p>built a deep learning based capability</p>
<p>where we shortlist a bunch of skills</p>
<p>when you say, Alexa, get me a car.</p>
<p>And then we figure it out, okay,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s meant for an Uber skill versus a Lyft</p>
<p>or based on your preferences.</p>
<p>And then you can rank the responses from the skill</p>
<p>and then choose the best response for the customer.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s on the more natural,</p>
<p>other examples of more natural is like,</p>
<p>we were talking about lists, for instance,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t wanna say, Alexa, add milk,</p>
<p>Alexa, add eggs, Alexa, add cookies.</p>
<p>No, Alexa, add cookies, milk, and eggs</p>
<p>and that in one shot, right?</p>
<p>So that works, that helps with the naturalness.</p>
<p>We talked about memory, like if you said,</p>
<p>you can say, Alexa, remember I have to go to mom&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>or you may have entered a calendar event</p>
<p>through your calendar that&rsquo;s linked to Alexa.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna remember whether it&rsquo;s in my calendar</p>
<p>or did I tell you to remember something</p>
<p>or some other reminder, right?</p>
<p>So you have to now, independent of how customers</p>
<p>create these events, it should just say,</p>
<p>Alexa, when do I have to go to mom&rsquo;s house?</p>
<p>And it tells you when you have to go to mom&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a fascinating problem.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that problem on?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s people who create skills.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s tasked with integrating all of that knowledge together</p>
<p>so the skills become seamless?</p>
<p>Is it the creators of the skills</p>
<p>or is it an infrastructure that Alexa provides problem?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>I think the large problem in terms of making sure</p>
<p>your skill quality is high,</p>
<p>that has to be done by our tools,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just, so these skills,</p>
<p>just to put the context,</p>
<p>they are built through Alexa Skills Kit,</p>
<p>which is a self serve way of building</p>
<p>an experience on Alexa.</p>
<p>This is like any developer in the world</p>
<p>could go to Alexa Skills Kit</p>
<p>and build an experience on Alexa.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re a Domino&rsquo;s, you can build a Domino&rsquo;s Skills.</p>
<p>For instance, that does pizza ordering.</p>
<p>When you have authored that,</p>
<p>you do want to now,</p>
<p>if people say, Alexa, open Domino&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or Alexa, ask Domino&rsquo;s to get a particular type of pizza,</p>
<p>that will work, but the discovery is hard.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say, Alexa, get me a pizza.</p>
<p>And then Alexa figures out what to do.</p>
<p>That latter part is definitely our responsibility</p>
<p>in terms of when the request is not fully specific,</p>
<p>how do you figure out what&rsquo;s the best skill</p>
<p>or a service that can fulfill the customer&rsquo;s request?</p>
<p>And it can keep evolving.</p>
<p>Imagine going to the situation I said,</p>
<p>which was the night out planning,</p>
<p>that the goal could be more than that individual request</p>
<p>that came up.</p>
<p>A pizza ordering could mean a night in,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re having an event with your kids</p>
<p>in their house, and you&rsquo;re, so this is,</p>
<p>welcome to the world of conversational AI.</p>
<p>This is super exciting because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the academic problem of NLP,</p>
<p>of natural language processing, understanding, dialogue.</p>
<p>This is like real world.</p>
<p>And the stakes are high in the sense</p>
<p>that customers get frustrated quickly,</p>
<p>people get frustrated quickly.</p>
<p>So you have to get it right,</p>
<p>you have to get that interaction right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I love it.</p>
<p>But so from that perspective,</p>
<p>what are the challenges today?</p>
<p>What are the problems that really need to be solved</p>
<p>in the next few years?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the focus?</p>
<p>First and foremost, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>that get the basics right is still true.</p>
<p>Basically, even the one shot requests,</p>
<p>which we think of as transactional requests,</p>
<p>needs to work magically, no question about that.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t turn your light on and off,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be super frustrated.</p>
<p>Even if I can complete the night out for you</p>
<p>and not do that, that is unacceptable as a customer, right?</p>
<p>So that you have to get the foundational understanding</p>
<p>going very well.</p>
<p>The second aspect when I said more conversational</p>
<p>is as you imagine is more about reasoning.</p>
<p>It is really about figuring out what the latent goal is</p>
<p>of the customer based on what I have the information now</p>
<p>and the history, what&rsquo;s the next best thing to do.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a complete reasoning and decision making problem.</p>
<p>Just like your self driving car,</p>
<p>but the goal is still more finite.</p>
<p>Here it evolves, your environment is super hard</p>
<p>and self driving and the cost of a mistake is huge here,</p>
<p>but there are certain similarities.</p>
<p>But if you think about how many decisions Alexa is making</p>
<p>or evaluating at any given time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a huge hypothesis space.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re only talked about so far</p>
<p>about what I think of reactive decision</p>
<p>in terms of you asked for something</p>
<p>and Alexa is reacting to it.</p>
<p>If you bring the proactive part,</p>
<p>which is Alexa having hunches.</p>
<p>So any given instance then it&rsquo;s really a decision</p>
<p>at any given point based on the information.</p>
<p>Alexa has to determine what&rsquo;s the best thing it needs to do.</p>
<p>So these are the ultimate AI problem</p>
<p>about decisions based on the information you have.</p>
<p>Do you think, just from my perspective,</p>
<p>I work a lot with sensing of the human face.</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;ll, and we touched this topic</p>
<p>a little bit earlier, but do you think it&rsquo;ll be a day soon</p>
<p>when Alexa can also look at you to help improve the quality</p>
<p>of the hunch it has, or at least detect frustration</p>
<p>or detect, improve the quality of its perception</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re trying to do?</p>
<p>I mean, let me again bring back to what it already does.</p>
<p>We talked about how based on you barge in over Alexa,</p>
<p>clearly it&rsquo;s a very high probability</p>
<p>it must have done something wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you barged in.</p>
<p>The next extension of whether frustration is a signal or not,</p>
<p>of course, is a natural thought</p>
<p>in terms of how that should be in a signal to it.</p>
<p>You can get that from voice.</p>
<p>You can get from voice, but it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, frustration as a signal historically,</p>
<p>if you think about emotions of different kinds,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole field of affective computing,</p>
<p>something that MIT has also done a lot of research in,</p>
<p>is super hard.</p>
<p>And you are now talking about a far field device,</p>
<p>as in you&rsquo;re talking to a distance noisy environment.</p>
<p>And in that environment,</p>
<p>it needs to have a good sense for your emotions.</p>
<p>This is a very, very hard problem.</p>
<p>Very hard problem, but you haven&rsquo;t shied away</p>
<p>from hard problems.</p>
<p>So, Deep Learning has been at the core</p>
<p>of a lot of this technology.</p>
<p>Are you optimistic</p>
<p>about the current Deep Learning approaches</p>
<p>to solving the hardest aspects of what we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>Or do you think there will come a time</p>
<p>where new ideas need to further,</p>
<p>if we look at reasoning,</p>
<p>so OpenAI, DeepMind,</p>
<p>a lot of folks are now starting to work in reasoning,</p>
<p>trying to see how we can make neural networks reason.</p>
<p>Do you see that new approaches need to be invented</p>
<p>to take the next big leap?</p>
<p>Absolutely, I think there has to be a lot more investment.</p>
<p>And I think in many different ways,</p>
<p>and there are these, I would say,</p>
<p>nuggets of research forming in a good way,</p>
<p>like learning with less data</p>
<p>or like zero short learning, one short learning.</p>
<p>And the active learning stuff you&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>is incredible stuff.</p>
<p>So, transfer learning is also super critical,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re thinking about applying knowledge</p>
<p>from one task to another,</p>
<p>or one language to another, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really ripe.</p>
<p>So, these are great pieces.</p>
<p>Deep learning has been useful too.</p>
<p>And now we are sort of marrying deep learning</p>
<p>with transfer learning and active learning.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s more straightforward</p>
<p>in terms of applying deep learning</p>
<p>and an active learning setup.</p>
<p>But I do think in terms of now looking</p>
<p>into more reasoning based approaches</p>
<p>is going to be key for our next wave of the technology.</p>
<p>But there is a good news.</p>
<p>The good news is that I think for keeping on</p>
<p>to delight customers, that a lot of it</p>
<p>can be done by prediction tasks.</p>
<p>So, we haven&rsquo;t exhausted that.</p>
<p>So, we don&rsquo;t need to give up</p>
<p>on the deep learning approaches for that.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s just I wanted to sort of point that out.</p>
<p>Creating a rich, fulfilling, amazing experience</p>
<p>that makes Amazon a lot of money</p>
<p>and a lot of everybody a lot of money</p>
<p>because it does awesome things, deep learning is enough.</p>
<p>The point.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I wouldn&rsquo;t say deep learning is enough.</p>
<p>I think for the purposes of Alexa</p>
<p>accomplished the task for customers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying there are still a lot of things we can do</p>
<p>with prediction based approaches that do not reason.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that and we haven&rsquo;t exhausted those.</p>
<p>But for the kind of high utility experiences</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m personally passionate about</p>
<p>of what Alexa needs to do, reasoning has to be solved</p>
<p>to the same extent as you can think</p>
<p>of natural language understanding and speech recognition</p>
<p>to the extent of understanding intents</p>
<p>has been how accurate it has become.</p>
<p>But reasoning, we have very, very early days.</p>
<p>Let me ask it another way.</p>
<p>How hard of a problem do you think that is?</p>
<p>Hardest of them.</p>
<p>I would say hardest of them because again,</p>
<p>the hypothesis space is really, really large.</p>
<p>And when you go back in time, like you were saying,</p>
<p>I wanna, I want Alexa to remember more things</p>
<p>that once you go beyond a session of interaction,</p>
<p>which is by session, I mean a time span,</p>
<p>which is today to versus remembering which restaurant I like.</p>
<p>And then when I&rsquo;m planning a night out to say,</p>
<p>do you wanna go to the same restaurant?</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re up the stakes big time.</p>
<p>And this is where the reasoning dimension</p>
<p>also goes way, way bigger.</p>
<p>So you think the space, we&rsquo;ll be elaborating that</p>
<p>a little bit, just philosophically speaking,</p>
<p>do you think when you reason about trying to model</p>
<p>what the goal of a person is in the context</p>
<p>of interacting with Alexa, you think that space is huge?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s huge, absolutely huge.</p>
<p>Do you think, so like another sort of devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p>would be that we human beings are really simple</p>
<p>and we all want like just a small set of things.</p>
<p>And so do you think it&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re not talking about</p>
<p>a fulfilling general conversation.</p>
<p>Perhaps actually the Alexa prize is a little bit after that.</p>
<p>Creating a customer, like there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>of the interactions, it feels like are clustered</p>
<p>in groups that are, don&rsquo;t require general reasoning.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right in terms of the head</p>
<p>of the distribution of all the possible things</p>
<p>customers may wanna accomplish.</p>
<p>But the tail is long and it&rsquo;s diverse, right?</p>
<p>So from that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many, many long tails.</p>
<p>So from that perspective, I think you have</p>
<p>to solve that problem otherwise,</p>
<p>and everyone&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, we see this already</p>
<p>in terms of the skills, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re an average surfer, which I am not, right?</p>
<p>But somebody is asking Alexa about surfing conditions, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a skill that is there for them to get to, right?</p>
<p>That tells you that the tail is massive.</p>
<p>Like in terms of like what kind of skills</p>
<p>people have created, it&rsquo;s humongous in terms of it.</p>
<p>And which means there are these diverse needs.</p>
<p>And when you start looking at the combinations</p>
<p>of these, right?</p>
<p>Even if you had pairs of skills and 90,000 choose two,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still a big set of combinations.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m saying there&rsquo;s a huge to do here now.</p>
<p>And I think customers are, you know,</p>
<p>wonderfully frustrated with things.</p>
<p>And they have to keep getting to do better things for them.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not known to be super patient.</p>
<p>So you have to.</p>
<p>Do it fast.</p>
<p>You have to do it fast.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned the idea of a press release,</p>
<p>the research and development, Amazon Alexa</p>
<p>and Amazon general, you kind of think of what</p>
<p>the future product will look like.</p>
<p>And you kind of make it happen.</p>
<p>You work backwards.</p>
<p>So can you draft for me, you probably already have one,</p>
<p>but can you make up one for 10, 20, 30, 40 years out</p>
<p>that you see the Alexa team putting out</p>
<p>just in broad strokes, something that you dream about?</p>
<p>I think let&rsquo;s start with the five years first, right?</p>
<p>So, and I&rsquo;ll get to the 40 years too.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m pretty sure you have a real five year one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t want to, but yeah,</p>
<p>in broad strokes, let&rsquo;s start with five years.</p>
<p>I think the five year is where, I mean,</p>
<p>I think of in these spaces, it&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re in the thick of things</p>
<p>to think beyond the five year space,</p>
<p>because a lot of things change, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if you ask me five years back,</p>
<p>will Alexa will be here?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have, I think it has surpassed</p>
<p>my imagination of that time, right?</p>
<p>So I think from the next five years perspective,</p>
<p>from a AI perspective, what we&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>is that notion, which you said goal oriented dialogues</p>
<p>and open domain like Alexa prize.</p>
<p>I think that bridge is gonna get closed.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t be different.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you why that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>You mentioned shopping.</p>
<p>How do you shop?</p>
<p>Do you shop in one shot?</p>
<p>Sure, your double A batteries, paper towels.</p>
<p>Yes, how long does it take for you to buy a camera?</p>
<p>You do ton of research, then you make a decision.</p>
<p>So is that a goal oriented dialogue</p>
<p>when somebody says, Alexa, find me a camera?</p>
<p>Is it simply inquisitiveness, right?</p>
<p>So even in the something that you think of it as shopping,</p>
<p>which you said you yourself use a lot of,</p>
<p>if you go beyond where it&rsquo;s reorders</p>
<p>or items where you sort of are not brand conscious</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>So that was just in shopping.</p>
<p>Just to comment quickly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never bought anything through Alexa</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t bought before on Amazon on the desktop</p>
<p>after I clicked in a bunch of read a bunch of reviews,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s repurchase.</p>
<p>So now you think in,</p>
<p>even for something that you felt like is a finite goal,</p>
<p>I think the space is huge because even products,</p>
<p>the attributes are many,</p>
<p>and you wanna look at reviews,</p>
<p>some on Amazon, some outside,</p>
<p>some you wanna look at what CNET is saying</p>
<p>or another consumer forum is saying</p>
<p>about even a product for instance, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just shopping where you could argue</p>
<p>the ultimate goal is sort of known.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t talked about Alexa,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the weather in Cape Cod this weekend, right?</p>
<p>So why am I asking that weather question, right?</p>
<p>So I think of it as how do you complete goals</p>
<p>with minimum steps for our customers, right?</p>
<p>And when you think of it that way,</p>
<p>the distinction between goal oriented and conversations</p>
<p>for open domain say goes away.</p>
<p>I may wanna know what happened</p>
<p>in the presidential debate, right?</p>
<p>And is it I&rsquo;m seeking just information</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m looking at who&rsquo;s winning the debates, right?</p>
<p>So these are all quite hard problems.</p>
<p>So even the five year horizon problem,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I sure hope we&rsquo;ll solve these.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re optimistic because that&rsquo;s a hard problem.</p>
<p>Which part?</p>
<p>The reasoning enough to be able to help explore</p>
<p>complex goals that are beyond something simplistic.</p>
<p>That feels like it could be, well, five years is a nice.</p>
<p>Is a nice bar for it, right?</p>
<p>I think you will, it&rsquo;s a nice ambition</p>
<p>and do we have press releases for that?</p>
<p>Absolutely, can I tell you what specifically</p>
<p>the roadmap will be?</p>
<p>No, right?</p>
<p>And what, and will we solve all of it</p>
<p>in the five year space?</p>
<p>No, this is, we&rsquo;ll work on this forever actually.</p>
<p>This is the hardest of the AI problems</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t see that being solved even in a 40 year horizon</p>
<p>because even if you limit to the human intelligence,</p>
<p>we know we are quite far from that.</p>
<p>In fact, every aspects of our sensing to neural processing,</p>
<p>to how brain stores information and how it processes it,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t yet know how to represent knowledge, right?</p>
<p>So we are still in those early stages.</p>
<p>So I wanted to start, that&rsquo;s why at the five year,</p>
<p>because the five year success would look like that</p>
<p>in solving these complex goals.</p>
<p>And the 40 year would be where it&rsquo;s just natural</p>
<p>to talk to these in terms of more of these complex goals.</p>
<p>Right now, we&rsquo;ve already come to the point</p>
<p>where these transactions you mentioned</p>
<p>of asking for weather or reordering something</p>
<p>or listening to your favorite tune,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s natural for you to ask Alexa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now unnatural to pick up your phone, right?</p>
<p>And that I think is the first five year transformation.</p>
<p>The next five year transformation would be,</p>
<p>okay, I can plan my weekend with Alexa</p>
<p>or I can plan my next meal with Alexa</p>
<p>or my next night out with seamless effort.</p>
<p>So just to pause and look back at the big picture of it all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, you&rsquo;re a part of a large team</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s creating a system that&rsquo;s in the home</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not human, that gets to interact with human beings.</p>
<p>So we human beings, we these descendants of apes</p>
<p>have created an artificial intelligence system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to have conversations.</p>
<p>I mean, that to me, the two most transformative robots</p>
<p>of this century, I think will be autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re a little bit transformative</p>
<p>in a more boring way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a tool.</p>
<p>I think conversational agents in the home</p>
<p>is like an experience.</p>
<p>How does that make you feel?</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re at the center of creating that?</p>
<p>Do you sit back in awe sometimes?</p>
<p>What is your feeling about the whole mess of it?</p>
<p>Can you even believe that we&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to create something like this?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a privilege.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so fortunate like where I ended up, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been a long journey.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been in this space for a long time in Cambridge,</p>
<p>right, and it&rsquo;s so heartwarming to see</p>
<p>the kind of adoption conversational agents are having now.</p>
<p>Five years back, it was almost like,</p>
<p>should I move out of this because we are unable</p>
<p>to find this killer application that customers would love</p>
<p>that would not simply be a good to have thing</p>
<p>in research labs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so fulfilling to see it make a difference</p>
<p>to millions and billions of people worldwide.</p>
<p>The good thing is that it&rsquo;s still very early.</p>
<p>So I have another 20 years of job security</p>
<p>doing what I love.</p>
<p>Like, so I think from that perspective,</p>
<p>I tell every researcher that joins</p>
<p>or every member of my team,</p>
<p>that this is a unique privilege.</p>
<p>Like I think, and we have,</p>
<p>and I would say not just launching Alexa in 2014,</p>
<p>which was first of its kind.</p>
<p>Along the way we have, when we launched Alexa Skills Kit,</p>
<p>it became democratizing AI.</p>
<p>When before that there was no good evidence</p>
<p>of an SDK for speech and language.</p>
<p>Now we are coming to this where you and I</p>
<p>are having this conversation where I&rsquo;m not saying,</p>
<p>oh, Lex, planning a night out with an AI agent, impossible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s in the realm of possibility</p>
<p>and not only possibility, we&rsquo;ll be launching this, right?</p>
<p>So some elements of that, it will keep getting better.</p>
<p>We know that is a universal truth.</p>
<p>Once you have these kinds of agents out there being used,</p>
<p>they get better for your customers.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where,</p>
<p>I think the amount of research topics</p>
<p>we are throwing out at our budding researchers</p>
<p>is just gonna be exponentially hard.</p>
<p>And the great thing is you can now get immense satisfaction</p>
<p>by having customers use it,</p>
<p>not just a paper in NeurIPS or another conference.</p>
<p>I think everyone, myself included,</p>
<p>are deeply excited about that future.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better place to end, Rohit.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to us.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
