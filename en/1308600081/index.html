    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to discuss your brain chemistry</p>
<p>and how to control and optimize your brain chemistry</p>
<p>for all aspects of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Many times before on the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>and frankly, every time I&rsquo;m a guest</p>
<p>on another podcast,</p>
<p>I get questions about science and science-based tools</p>
<p>for things like enhancing sleep, enhancing focus,</p>
<p>enhancing creativity, improving relationships,</p>
<p>getting over grief, and on and on,</p>
<p>all of which are valid questions</p>
<p>and for which there are protocols</p>
<p>that are based in science and that work</p>
<p>the first time and every time.</p>
<p>However, far more important than knowing a protocol</p>
<p>is understanding why a given protocol works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m always hammering on mechanism</p>
<p>and explaining the cells and circuits and chemicals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get at least to some detail</p>
<p>so that people can understand not just what to do,</p>
<p>but why it works and therefore how to change a protocol</p>
<p>as their life circumstances change or as goals change.</p>
<p>Now, today we are going to go even a layer deeper.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to explore the foundations of your biology</p>
<p>in your brain and body that allow any protocol to work</p>
<p>because as it turns out, all of the protocols out there,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a breathing protocol or a supplement</p>
<p>or an exercise routine, they all tap into</p>
<p>and leverage a core set of just a few biological mechanisms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Beneath everything you are able to do and feel,</p>
<p>and indeed beneath every protocol that allows you</p>
<p>to change for the better and optimize your mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a small subset of chemicals</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re leveraging toward that change.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to talk about the four major pillars</p>
<p>of neurochemistry that allow you to, for instance,</p>
<p>be focused when you want to focus,</p>
<p>that allow you to relax when you need to relax</p>
<p>and de-stress, that allow you to optimize your sleep,</p>
<p>that allow you to optimize your exercise routine</p>
<p>or to work through a pain point in relationship</p>
<p>or in career or in your relationship to yourself.</p>
<p>So what I can say for sure is that by the end</p>
<p>of this episode, you will have a much richer understanding</p>
<p>about how your brain and nervous system</p>
<p>and indeed your entire body work</p>
<p>and you will have a much firmer understanding</p>
<p>as to which protocols and tools to reach for</p>
<p>given your particular goals in the moment,</p>
<p>in the day, across the week, across the month,</p>
<p>across the year, and indeed across your entire lifespan.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re really going for today are principles,</p>
<p>deeper understanding of why any given protocol works.</p>
<p>And we are also going to discuss specific protocols.</p>
<p>Some of those protocols I&rsquo;ve discussed on previous episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>but I must say many of the protocols and tools</p>
<p>that I will discuss are brand new and based on research</p>
<p>that I have not discussed at all,</p>
<p>simply because the research papers came out only recently</p>
<p>or these are papers that I only recently unearthed.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m going to share with you two recent studies</p>
<p>in a moment that are exceedingly important</p>
<p>for optimizing your sleep.</p>
<p>And these are studies that, again, I&rsquo;ve never discussed</p>
<p>in any episode on sleep or on any other podcast.</p>
<p>So by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have far more knowledge</p>
<p>about your biology and psychology</p>
<p>than you did at the start.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll be armed with many more tools</p>
<p>and most importantly, principles so that you can navigate</p>
<p>not just the tools presented on this podcast,</p>
<p>but in the vast landscape of tools that are out there</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Every so often I come across a study or set of studies</p>
<p>that I get so excited about that I start telling everybody</p>
<p>in my immediate life.</p>
<p>And I insist on also sharing it with you,</p>
<p>the listeners of this podcast,</p>
<p>because I find the information</p>
<p>to be so incredibly interesting and actionable.</p>
<p>The two studies that I&rsquo;m going to discuss</p>
<p>both relate to sleep and sleep states</p>
<p>and how to access better sleep.</p>
<p>The first one was published in the journal Cell Reports,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is</p>
<p>A Rapid and Reversible Control of Human Metabolism</p>
<p>by Individual Sleep States.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to the study in the show captions.</p>
<p>The first author is Nora Nowak, N-O-W-A-K.</p>
<p>And basically what they did is they measured</p>
<p>the different forms of metabolism</p>
<p>that occur while humans sleep.</p>
<p>As far as I know,</p>
<p>this is one of the first studies of this kind.</p>
<p>There are many studies of metabolism.</p>
<p>There are many studies of sleep.</p>
<p>This study focused on how different states of sleep,</p>
<p>such as rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>which is associated with dreaming</p>
<p>and high emotional content dreams versus slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>which tends to be more focused on physical repair</p>
<p>of the body, more mundane dreams,</p>
<p>how those different states of mind during sleep</p>
<p>relate to different aspects of metabolism.</p>
<p>And what they found was absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p>First of all, they found that sleep states</p>
<p>regulate more than 50%,</p>
<p>half of all the metabolite features detected</p>
<p>in human breath.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that you can figure out</p>
<p>what humans are metabolizing in particular,</p>
<p>more lipids or more carbohydrate,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re relying more on glucose metabolism</p>
<p>based on the contents of their breath.</p>
<p>This is true during waking and during sleep.</p>
<p>And this is what allowed them</p>
<p>to do these incredible measurements</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s being metabolized during sleep.</p>
<p>They measured close to 2000 metabolites in breath</p>
<p>every 10 seconds across the entire night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>And what they found was that there are major pathways</p>
<p>related to lipid metabolism, fat metabolism,</p>
<p>or to carbohydrate metabolism,</p>
<p>or other forms of metabolism that are up or down regulated</p>
<p>as human beings transition between slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>rapid eye movement sleep, and waking.</p>
<p>And you might say waking.</p>
<p>Well, yes, they also looked as people fell asleep</p>
<p>and as they emerged from sleep.</p>
<p>And believe it or not, every so often during sleep,</p>
<p>you wake up, you didn&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>but you wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>you look around and you go back to sleep.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not aware of it because you&rsquo;re still in a</p>
<p>rather sleep-like state, although you are awake.</p>
<p>What they found was that sleep</p>
<p>and the various states of sleep</p>
<p>regulated individual metabolic pathways.</p>
<p>They found, for instance,</p>
<p>that the switch from sleep to wakefulness</p>
<p>reduces fatty acid oxidation.</p>
<p>So that means while you&rsquo;re asleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re oxidating more fatty acids.</p>
<p>And as you wake up, that becomes less the case.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a switch in slow wave sleep</p>
<p>that increases fatty acid oxidation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this transition from rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>to other aspects of sleep that brings about things</p>
<p>like the so-called TCA cycle.</p>
<p>Some of you familiar with metabolism</p>
<p>will be familiar with the TCA cycle,</p>
<p>the so-called tricarbolic acid cycle intermediates.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fancy nerd speak for specific aspects of metabolism</p>
<p>being regulated during this</p>
<p>rapid eye movement sleep transition.</p>
<p>What does all this mean?</p>
<p>And how is this actionable?</p>
<p>Well, on many episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>such as the master sleep episode</p>
<p>and the episode that we&rsquo;re going into in further depth today,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about sleep and how to optimize sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been thought of, but not really tamped down,</p>
<p>that quality and depth of sleep and duration of sleep</p>
<p>is important for metabolism during the daytime.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>If people are sleep-deprived</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not sleeping enough,</p>
<p>things like glucose metabolism, et cetera,</p>
<p>get really disrupted during the daytime.</p>
<p>But what this current study shows</p>
<p>is that the metabolism that you experience during sleep,</p>
<p>or to be more specific,</p>
<p>the range of different types of metabolism</p>
<p>that you experience during sleep may serve to tune up</p>
<p>or to ensure that the specific aspects of metabolism</p>
<p>that you require during wakefulness are working properly.</p>
<p>In addition to that,</p>
<p>this study clearly shows that getting enough sleep</p>
<p>allows you to transition</p>
<p>through all the various forms of metabolism</p>
<p>and use all those different forms of metabolites</p>
<p>during sleep in a way that&rsquo;s immensely beneficial</p>
<p>for the systems of your brain and body.</p>
<p>So the take-home message here is that,</p>
<p>as the authors state,</p>
<p>sleep and experiencing the different states of sleep,</p>
<p>slow-wave sleep early in the night, predominantly,</p>
<p>plus rapid eye movement sleep toward the end of the night,</p>
<p>is extremely important for optimizing metabolic circuits</p>
<p>for human performance and health.</p>
<p>In other words, by not getting sufficient duration sleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowing your body and brain to transition</p>
<p>through all the different aspects of fuel utilization,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not teaching your brain and body</p>
<p>how to use similar types of fuels during wakefulness.</p>
<p>So again, all of this points to the fact</p>
<p>that we need to be getting sufficient quality</p>
<p>and duration of sleep.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re sleep-deprived even by an hour or so,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get far less rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>because rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>is what occurs toward the end of a sleep night.</p>
<p>During the early part of the night,</p>
<p>far more slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>In getting less rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>we know it makes you more emotionally labile,</p>
<p>but now we know it&rsquo;s also going to alter certain forms</p>
<p>of glucose metabolism during the night</p>
<p>and during wakefulness.</p>
<p>So that all underscores the need to get sleep.</p>
<p>But then the question is how to get enough sleep</p>
<p>and how to make sure you get</p>
<p>into all these different sleep states.</p>
<p>And this is particularly important</p>
<p>for you so-called night owls.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of controversy out there</p>
<p>as to whether or not different so-called chronotypes exist,</p>
<p>that is people who just naturally or genetically</p>
<p>want to be an early bird,</p>
<p>wake up early and go to bed early.</p>
<p>So these people that wake up at 4 a.m.</p>
<p>and would be most comfortable going to bed</p>
<p>by 7 or 8 p.m. or 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Then there are so-called night owls,</p>
<p>people that would feel best or tend to feel best</p>
<p>when they go to sleep at 1 a.m., 2 a.m., even 3 a.m.</p>
<p>and like to wake up later, 8, 9, 10,</p>
<p>or even 11 a.m. or noon.</p>
<p>And then of course, most people go to sleep</p>
<p>somewhere between 10 p.m. and midnight</p>
<p>and wake up somewhere between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m.</p>
<p>or I suppose more typically 6 a.m. and 8 a.m.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not real chronotypes exist</p>
<p>or whether or not people simply select schedules</p>
<p>for sleep and wakefulness that they like</p>
<p>because of their social schedules</p>
<p>or the activities they enjoy.</p>
<p>For instance, some people like to really go out.</p>
<p>They like to go out dancing or hear music</p>
<p>or spend time in venues that are only open late at night</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t even open until noon or after.</p>
<p>Other people like myself rarely go out at night,</p>
<p>but I like to get up early.</p>
<p>I like to exercise.</p>
<p>I like to see the sunrise, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m a morning person</p>
<p>or an evening person.</p>
<p>I just know the things I enjoy tend to happen</p>
<p>in the early part of the day</p>
<p>and the things that I don&rsquo;t enjoy quite as much</p>
<p>tend to happen late at night.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>there are real genetic propensities to be a night owl</p>
<p>or an early bird or a sort of typical person</p>
<p>right there in the middle,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important that people have some control</p>
<p>over their sleep schedule.</p>
<p>And even more important,</p>
<p>that people are able to get sufficient amount</p>
<p>of REM sleep and slow-wave sleep for many reasons,</p>
<p>but including the reasons I discussed</p>
<p>in the previous study related to metabolism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited, therefore,</p>
<p>about a study that came out in Sleep Medicine.</p>
<p>This was a few years ago, but somehow I missed this one.</p>
<p>It was published in 2019.</p>
<p>And the title of this article is</p>
<p>Resetting the Late Timing of Night Owls</p>
<p>Has a Positive Impact on Mental Health,</p>
<p>Physical Health, and Performance.</p>
<p>This is a study done in humans</p>
<p>focusing specifically on people</p>
<p>that like to stay up late and sleep in,</p>
<p>but who desire to be able to get up</p>
<p>and feel alert in order to go to work or study,</p>
<p>and they want to go to sleep a bit earlier.</p>
<p>And so there are a lot of questions embedded in this study,</p>
<p>in particular, whether or not people</p>
<p>can actually shift their schedule by a few hours or more.</p>
<p>Some people out there contend that if you&rsquo;re a night owl,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just going to be impossible</p>
<p>or very, very challenging to do.</p>
<p>Turns out it&rsquo;s not impossible,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not even that challenging to do,</p>
<p>provided you do the right things.</p>
<p>Just a brief overview of the study,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll give you the key takeaways.</p>
<p>It was a randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p>It involved a number of different people,</p>
<p>both male and female.</p>
<p>And what they did was they used non-pharmacological,</p>
<p>practical interventions in a real-world setting.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m paraphrasing.</p>
<p>They used targeted light exposure.</p>
<p>They used consistent sleep-wake times.</p>
<p>They used fixed meal times, caffeine intake, and exercise.</p>
<p>And this is one of the reasons I love this study so much,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve done episodes where I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>temperature, exercise, feeding, and most importantly,</p>
<p>light exposure as a way to control</p>
<p>and shift your sleep-wake cycles,</p>
<p>your so-called circadian timing and entrainment.</p>
<p>What did they find?</p>
<p>Well, they found, quote,</p>
<p>significant improvements in terms of mood,</p>
<p>so far less depression and stress, subjectively measured,</p>
<p>as well as improved cognitive performance</p>
<p>that was objectively measured, so improved reaction times,</p>
<p>improved physical grip strength,</p>
<p>which is actually a measure not just of strength per se,</p>
<p>but also of nervous system function,</p>
<p>and a number of things that people could do</p>
<p>in order to optimize their morning hours,</p>
<p>even though they were night owls previously.</p>
<p>What did they have people do?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m just going to list this off</p>
<p>in sort of a rapid-fire succession,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll provide a link to the study</p>
<p>if you want to learn more.</p>
<p>First of all, they told participants to try and wake up</p>
<p>two to three hours before their typical wake-up time,</p>
<p>two to three hours.</p>
<p>That seems brutal to me and probably seems brutal to you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re somebody who typically wakes up at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>to try and get up at eight or even 7 a.m. consistently.</p>
<p>But they were also asked to maximize</p>
<p>outdoor light exposure during the mornings,</p>
<p>for reasons that, if you&rsquo;ve listened to this podcast before,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve heard me talk about before,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m constantly talking about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably go into the grave shouting,</p>
<p>please get as much light exposure from sunlight</p>
<p>early in the day as possible because it sets in motion</p>
<p>a huge number of things that are beneficial</p>
<p>for your mental health and physical health,</p>
<p>including dopamine production,</p>
<p>timing melatonin production correctly,</p>
<p>reducing cortisol peaks late in the day, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So they asked them to get a lot of outdoor light exposure.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t give them a specific amount,</p>
<p>but they said maximize outdoor light exposure</p>
<p>during the mornings, the time before noon.</p>
<p>And again, they had them waking up two to three hours</p>
<p>before their habitual wake-up time.</p>
<p>They were also told, and this is very important</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to shift your schedule earlier,</p>
<p>to try and keep sleep-wake times fixed</p>
<p>between their work days and their weekends.</p>
<p>So not sleeping in on the weekends</p>
<p>or not having any sleep-in days,</p>
<p>regardless of how well they slept the night before.</p>
<p>How fixed?</p>
<p>Within 15 to 30 minutes of their pre-designated time.</p>
<p>So if they were waking up at seven o&rsquo;clock one day,</p>
<p>they set their alarm and they made sure</p>
<p>they got out of bed at seven o&rsquo;clock every day,</p>
<p>plus or minus 30 minutes, but never later than 7.30,</p>
<p>never earlier than 6.30.</p>
<p>Participants were also asked to try and go to sleep</p>
<p>two to three hours before their habitual bedtime.</p>
<p>So again, these are people that want to stay up late,</p>
<p>like 11 p.m. perhaps, but even as late as 1 a.m. or 2 a.m.,</p>
<p>and now they are asked to go to sleep two to three hours</p>
<p>before their habitual bedtime</p>
<p>and to wake up two to three hours earlier,</p>
<p>as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>They were also told, and I love this</p>
<p>because it fits with many of the things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about on this podcast before,</p>
<p>to try and limit light exposure during the evenings.</p>
<p>Dim the lights or limit altogether artificial lights.</p>
<p>Lot of reasons for that.</p>
<p>I covered that in the Master Sleep episode.</p>
<p>I covered that in the Optimize Health Using Light episode.</p>
<p>You can find those at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re asking them to do that here.</p>
<p>And they asked participants to keep a regular schedule</p>
<p>for their daily meals.</p>
<p>Not eating on the hour consistently, you know,</p>
<p>at 9 a.m., noon, 3 p.m. exactly,</p>
<p>but within, again, about 15 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always eating at the same times.</p>
<p>That was also important.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s because we have these so-called</p>
<p>food-entrained circadian clocks.</p>
<p>When you eat tells your body when to be alert</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re not eating, when to be asleep.</p>
<p>And they were told to not drink any caffeine</p>
<p>after 3 p.m. in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Another theme that we&rsquo;ve talked about on this podcast.</p>
<p>They were also told not to take naps after 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Naps are an interesting feature of the sleep-wake cycle.</p>
<p>To be very brief about this and to pull from the episode</p>
<p>that I did with World Sleep Expert</p>
<p>from University of California, Berkeley, Matt Walker,</p>
<p>naps are great for many people,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t nap if it interferes with your nighttime sleep.</p>
<p>And in this study, they told them don&rsquo;t nap after 4 p.m.</p>
<p>And if you are a napper, don&rsquo;t nap for more than 90 minutes.</p>
<p>10-minute naps are fine, 20-minute naps are fine,</p>
<p>zero-minute naps are fine,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t nap for more than 90 minutes</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t nap after 4 p.m.</p>
<p>And to exercise during the morning.</p>
<p>Now, this one can be a bit controversial</p>
<p>because I know a lot of the PTs out there</p>
<p>and a lot of the online, you know, gym rats</p>
<p>and people who, and runners too for that matter,</p>
<p>will say, well, according to body temperature and research,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s best to exercise in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s better to exercise sometime</p>
<p>as opposed to no time.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re focused on how to shift your schedule earlier,</p>
<p>meaning get up early and go to sleep earlier,</p>
<p>this study had people exercise in the early part of the day,</p>
<p>certainly before 2 p.m. and ideally before noon.</p>
<p>So again, this is a really important study</p>
<p>because it combines a lot of different variables</p>
<p>to arrive at this very impressive shift</p>
<p>where people can get up two to three hours earlier</p>
<p>and then pretty consistently and reflexively</p>
<p>start going to bed two to three hours earlier,</p>
<p>feeling more alert during the day.</p>
<p>Again, improvements in cognitive performance,</p>
<p>mood, and physical performance, grip strength, et cetera.</p>
<p>Very few studies are able to or willing to tackle</p>
<p>so many variables and combine them in one study.</p>
<p>This paper, I think, does a marvelous job of doing this</p>
<p>and is incorporating things that individually</p>
<p>each have some support for them in animal studies</p>
<p>and previous human studies.</p>
<p>But as far as I know, this is one of the few studies</p>
<p>that really combines all these different features</p>
<p>in one place.</p>
<p>Eating times, keeping those consistent,</p>
<p>getting maximal sunlight exposure earlier in the day,</p>
<p>getting up at a consistent time,</p>
<p>going to sleep at a consistent time, and on and on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really marvelous study for that reason.</p>
<p>And I think for any of you that are night owls</p>
<p>and any of you that want to reinforce your early waking</p>
<p>and early to bed times, and I think for most all of you</p>
<p>who fall into that general middle category</p>
<p>of tend to go to sleep somewhere between 10 p.m. and midnight</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s most people,</p>
<p>and tend to wake up sometime between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m.,</p>
<p>well, maybe you want to become more of an early riser</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re going to travel</p>
<p>or the seasons are changing and you want to shift your time</p>
<p>or you have a new job, et cetera,</p>
<p>or something that&rsquo;s actually very common</p>
<p>in terms of relationship struggle.</p>
<p>You want to match your wake sleep times</p>
<p>or maybe you want to offset your wake sleep times</p>
<p>from a significant other.</p>
<p>These sorts of approaches that I described here</p>
<p>and that are supported by the data in this paper</p>
<p>are absolutely powerful and science supported.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certain that if you were to apply them,</p>
<p>that you would see essentially the same effects</p>
<p>that were observed here.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about how to optimize</p>
<p>and indeed how to control your brain chemistry</p>
<p>for sake of health and performance.</p>
<p>Now, in order to do that,</p>
<p>we all need to be on the same page about some basic facts.</p>
<p>Some of those basic facts</p>
<p>involve learning some basic biology,</p>
<p>and I promise that even if you don&rsquo;t have a biology</p>
<p>or chemistry background,</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;m about to say</p>
<p>should be accessible and clear to you.</p>
<p>The important thing to know is that your brain</p>
<p>and your spinal cord</p>
<p>and the rest of your so-called nervous system</p>
<p>control all the organs of your body,</p>
<p>and that all the organs of your body feed back,</p>
<p>meaning they communicate through chemicals and other means</p>
<p>to your nervous system.</p>
<p>Now, your nervous system plays a particularly important role</p>
<p>in generating everything from sleep to wakefulness,</p>
<p>creativity, stress, calm, et cetera,</p>
<p>by way of a particular type of cell-cell interaction,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s called synaptic communication.</p>
<p>What is synaptic communication?</p>
<p>Well, in order to understand that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s dial back a little bit further</p>
<p>and try and understand for a moment</p>
<p>what makes up your nervous system.</p>
<p>In its simplest form,</p>
<p>your nervous system is made of nerve cells</p>
<p>that we call neurons.</p>
<p>Neurons communicate with one another through chemicals.</p>
<p>They release certain chemicals that make other neurons</p>
<p>more or less likely to be electrically active.</p>
<p>What do we mean by electrically active?</p>
<p>We mean, as it sounds,</p>
<p>electricity passing down through cells,</p>
<p>and then literally causing electricity in other cells.</p>
<p>The simplest way to think about this</p>
<p>is maybe when you were a kid or maybe even still now,</p>
<p>you would wear socks and you&rsquo;d shuffle along the floor</p>
<p>to generate some static electricity,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;d touch someone</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d shock them with your finger.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a younger brother,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;d occasionally do that to my sister.</p>
<p>I had friends, we would do that to one another.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s kind of silly and childish,</p>
<p>yet it illustrates the principle</p>
<p>that we can generate electricity</p>
<p>and pass electricity to other beings,</p>
<p>or in the case of neurons, from one neuron to the next.</p>
<p>The way neurons do that is that in between the neurons,</p>
<p>there are little spaces,</p>
<p>those little spaces are called synapses,</p>
<p>and neurons literally vomit.</p>
<p>Well, they don&rsquo;t literally vomit,</p>
<p>but they release little packets</p>
<p>of so-called transmitter chemical into that space</p>
<p>we call a synapse.</p>
<p>It travels across the synapse,</p>
<p>it attaches to the cell on the other side, the other neuron,</p>
<p>and then depending on what that chemical is,</p>
<p>it either makes that next neuron more electrically active</p>
<p>or less electrically active, so-called excitation.</p>
<p>It either excites the next neuron</p>
<p>to be electrically active also,</p>
<p>or it inhibits, it prevents the next neuron</p>
<p>from being electrically active.</p>
<p>So again, very simply, we have nerve cells</p>
<p>that communicate with one another</p>
<p>through electricity and chemicals</p>
<p>that inspire that electricity,</p>
<p>and the little gaps between neurons are called synapses.</p>
<p>If you can understand that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain you can make it through the rest of the episode</p>
<p>and that you will get all the depth</p>
<p>and important detail that you need to know.</p>
<p>But I want to go just a little bit further</p>
<p>and explain that neurons don&rsquo;t just talk one-to-one,</p>
<p>there are trillions of neurons in your nervous system</p>
<p>that allow you to be happy, to be in love,</p>
<p>to be sad, to be in grief, to remember things, and so on.</p>
<p>And what you do at any moment,</p>
<p>what you feel and what you think,</p>
<p>relates to which so-called neural circuits are active.</p>
<p>So a lot of times we think about brain areas,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve all seen these pictures of the brain</p>
<p>where someone was in a fMRI scanner,</p>
<p>or they were in a brain scanner of some sort,</p>
<p>and they saw a picture of something</p>
<p>and a certain area of the brain lights up, as it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>That lighting up of the brain really reflects the activity</p>
<p>of hundreds, if not thousands,</p>
<p>maybe even millions of neurons in that region.</p>
<p>Those images of brain areas lighting up,</p>
<p>and indeed talking about brain areas lighting up,</p>
<p>can be a little bit or a lot misleading,</p>
<p>because in fact, no single brain area</p>
<p>controls any one single perception</p>
<p>or behavior or feeling state.</p>
<p>Rather, we have so-called neural circuits,</p>
<p>chains of neurons, chains of specific neurons, that is,</p>
<p>that create different states of mind,</p>
<p>that lead to specific behaviors,</p>
<p>that lead to specific emotional states.</p>
<p>And those neural circuits are made up</p>
<p>of lots of different brain areas</p>
<p>that light up in particular sequences.</p>
<p>And when I say light up, excuse me,</p>
<p>what I mean is that particular brain areas either excite</p>
<p>or prevent the excitation,</p>
<p>that is, they inhibit other brain areas</p>
<p>in a particular sequence.</p>
<p>Much like keys on a piano played in a particular sequence,</p>
<p>makes up a particular song,</p>
<p>particular brain areas activated or made silent</p>
<p>in a particular sequence leads to a particular behavior,</p>
<p>like getting up out of a chair,</p>
<p>or a particular feeling state,</p>
<p>like being particularly happy one day when you wake up,</p>
<p>or particularly depressed,</p>
<p>whether or not that depression is caused by a life event,</p>
<p>or whether or not it arises spontaneously.</p>
<p>So we have neurons, we have synapses,</p>
<p>and we have neural circuits.</p>
<p>And vitally important is the fact</p>
<p>that which neural circuits are active,</p>
<p>and which neural circuits are likely to be less active</p>
<p>at any given moment,</p>
<p>depends on two major categories of chemicals.</p>
<p>It depends on hormones,</p>
<p>and it depends on so-called neuromodulators.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re mainly going to focus on neuromodulators today,</p>
<p>because those are the things</p>
<p>that if you can learn to control them,</p>
<p>and indeed there are tools to control them,</p>
<p>then you can control which neural circuits</p>
<p>are more likely or less likely to be active in you</p>
<p>at any given moment.</p>
<p>And in doing so, you can control</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re going to be alert and focused,</p>
<p>or deeply asleep.</p>
<p>You can control whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be in a creative state,</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re going to be in a state of mind,</p>
<p>more fit, more capable that is,</p>
<p>of doing focused work, or math,</p>
<p>or more so-called linear types of work</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a correct answer,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a specific thing to follow,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re simply going to plug and chug, as it were,</p>
<p>through a particular set of steps</p>
<p>in order to accomplish something.</p>
<p>Or, for instance, whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be in a more relaxed and creative state</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re thinking about new ideas,</p>
<p>or new ideas just seem to be spontaneously coming to mind.</p>
<p>All of that can be controlled to a considerable extent</p>
<p>by leveraging these so-called neuromodulators.</p>
<p>What are neuromodulators?</p>
<p>Neuromodulators are particular chemicals</p>
<p>that make it likely that certain neural circuits</p>
<p>will be active and not others.</p>
<p>And the four neuromodulators</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to talk about today</p>
<p>that are of the utmost importance for your goals</p>
<p>are dopamine, epinephrine, also called adrenaline,</p>
<p>serotonin, and acetylcholine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to teach you</p>
<p>how each of those different categories</p>
<p>of neuromodulators work,</p>
<p>and the things that you can do</p>
<p>to control those neuromodulators,</p>
<p>that is, increase them or decrease them</p>
<p>through behavioral tools and supplementation</p>
<p>in ways that allow you to access the brain and body states</p>
<p>that you want at the times that you want.</p>
<p>Just very quickly, I want to talk about</p>
<p>how neuromodulators are able to work,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not it&rsquo;s dopamine or serotonin</p>
<p>or epinephrine, et cetera.</p>
<p>There are many features of how neuromodulators work,</p>
<p>but for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>we only need to focus on two of those features,</p>
<p>and those are fast-acting features</p>
<p>and longer, slower features,</p>
<p>or what we call baseline features.</p>
<p>What am I talking about when I say faster or baseline?</p>
<p>Well, consider that at any given moment,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re asleep or awake,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s morning or afternoon or night,</p>
<p>you have some amount of dopamine being released</p>
<p>in your brain and body, some amount of serotonin,</p>
<p>some amount of epinephrine,</p>
<p>and some amount of acetylcholine.</p>
<p>It is rarely, if ever the case,</p>
<p>that you have zero dopamine or zero serotonin.</p>
<p>You know, so often we hear</p>
<p>about someone being dopamine depleted,</p>
<p>or these days you hear a lot about that anyways,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ll hear that people&rsquo;s serotonin is bottomed out.</p>
<p>In reality, none of these neuromodulators</p>
<p>ever disappear completely,</p>
<p>but they tend to be present at different levels</p>
<p>or different relative levels.</p>
<p>Another important thing to point out</p>
<p>is that they don&rsquo;t work alone.</p>
<p>In fact, as you&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>dopamine and epinephrine are close cousins</p>
<p>that collaborate in terms of creating states</p>
<p>of focus and motivation, for instance,</p>
<p>or in creating states of energy</p>
<p>and the pursuit of particular goals.</p>
<p>When I say they&rsquo;re close cousins,</p>
<p>what I mean is that they tend to impact</p>
<p>some of the same neural circuits,</p>
<p>and believe it or not,</p>
<p>dopamine and epinephrine are chemically related too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you right now</p>
<p>that epinephrine is actually derived from dopamine.</p>
<p>Chemically, epinephrine, that is adrenaline,</p>
<p>is made from the molecule dopamine.</p>
<p>Now, dopamine and serotonin can also work together</p>
<p>to impact certain circuits in the brain,</p>
<p>but in large part, they operate on separate circuits.</p>
<p>And acetylcholine, which you&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>is involved in states of focus and can actually open up.</p>
<p>It can literally create states in the mind</p>
<p>in which your brain is more plastic</p>
<p>and able to change and learn more quickly.</p>
<p>Well, acetylcholine can do that on its own,</p>
<p>but rarely does it do it on its own.</p>
<p>More typically, it gets assistance</p>
<p>from some of the other neuromodulators.</p>
<p>Now, that might seem like it complicates the picture,</p>
<p>but it actually makes the picture far simpler</p>
<p>because what we can say for sure</p>
<p>is that the fast actions of dopamine,</p>
<p>or the fast actions of epinephrine, serotonin,</p>
<p>or acetylcholine are actions that occur</p>
<p>on the order of seconds or minutes</p>
<p>or up to about an hour or so,</p>
<p>whereas the slower actions of those neuromodulators</p>
<p>tend to occur on the order of hours, days, or even weeks.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps surprisingly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to focus on the slow actions</p>
<p>of the neuromodulators first</p>
<p>because those slow actions of the neuromodulators</p>
<p>are happening in you and in me and in everyone right now,</p>
<p>and they set the backdrop, the context,</p>
<p>in which the various tools to manipulate dopamine,</p>
<p>epinephrine, serotonin, or acetylcholine will work.</p>
<p>What do I mean by the context or the backdrop</p>
<p>or the baseline?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s fair to say that most people</p>
<p>are awake during the daytime and asleep at night.</p>
<p>I do realize that there are people</p>
<p>who are going to be doing shift work</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re raising young children</p>
<p>or that might have a sick person at home</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re tending to, et cetera,</p>
<p>or even have insomnia, they&rsquo;re tending to them.</p>
<p>So schedules of sleep and wakefulness will vary,</p>
<p>but in general, everybody,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you&rsquo;re nocturnal</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re so-called diurnal, you&rsquo;re awake during the day,</p>
<p>pretty much everybody follows a schedule</p>
<p>in which from zero to nine hours after waking,</p>
<p>that is from the time you wake up</p>
<p>until about nine hours later,</p>
<p>the neuromodulators dopamine and epinephrine</p>
<p>tend to be at their highest levels</p>
<p>that they will be at any point in the 24-hour period,</p>
<p>in any period of the day.</p>
<p>So we can call this zero to nine-hour period,</p>
<p>phase one of the day, just for simplicity.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve referred to this before in a previous episode,</p>
<p>but not in this exact context.</p>
<p>From nine to about 16 hours is what we will call phase two.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when dopamine and epinephrine levels</p>
<p>tend to subside a bit</p>
<p>compared to the earlier phase one part of the day,</p>
<p>and serotonin levels start to increase.</p>
<p>And then phase three of the 24-hour cycle,</p>
<p>which is from about, and again,</p>
<p>about these are approximates,</p>
<p>from about 17 hours after waking</p>
<p>until about 24 hours after waking,</p>
<p>is phase three of the day.</p>
<p>And during that time, there is chaos</p>
<p>in terms of which neuromodulators</p>
<p>are most present in the brain.</p>
<p>And when I chaos, what I mean is that during sleep,</p>
<p>you have incredible peaks in acetylcholine</p>
<p>and drops in acetylcholine.</p>
<p>You have incredible peaks in dopamine and drops in dopamine.</p>
<p>You have incredible peaks in serotonin</p>
<p>and drops in serotonin.</p>
<p>Most often, you are not going to see much,</p>
<p>if any, release of epinephrine adrenaline.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because epinephrine, also called adrenaline,</p>
<p>tends to wake us up and put us into action mode behaviors.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s simply not happening during sleep.</p>
<p>But for the other three neuromodulators,</p>
<p>across the night, it&rsquo;s sort of chaos.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got peaks and drops and peaks and drops</p>
<p>in different combinations</p>
<p>than you would ever see in wakefulness.</p>
<p>And this plays important roles in dreaming,</p>
<p>important roles in some of the reparative functions</p>
<p>of sleep.</p>
<p>The point is that during that phase three,</p>
<p>the levels of neuromodulators are all over the place,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not random, right?</p>
<p>I say it&rsquo;s chaos, but it&rsquo;s organized</p>
<p>according to the specific reparative goals of sleep,</p>
<p>the specific metabolic roles of sleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to focus too much on phase three today,</p>
<p>because phase three of the 24-hour cycle,</p>
<p>that 17 to 24-hour period,</p>
<p>is one in which you ought to be deeply asleep,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re nocturnal or diurnal, right?</p>
<p>17 hours after waking, you ought to be asleep.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of episodes of this podcast.</p>
<p>And indeed today, I started talking about</p>
<p>two particular studies related to sleep.</p>
<p>There are a lot of tools to enhance sleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>And of course, there are things that you can do</p>
<p>in the late portion of phase two of the day</p>
<p>in order to enhance your transition time</p>
<p>into and depth of sleep.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t really do much during sleep, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not taking supplements,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not doing breathing practices.</p>
<p>There are things to fall back asleep,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not really doing much during sleep.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re mainly going to focus on</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re calling phase one and phase two.</p>
<p>Phase one being this dopamine epinephrine-dominated</p>
<p>phase of our day, and phase two being this more</p>
<p>serotonergic or serotonin-dominated portion of the day.</p>
<p>And then you might say, well, what about acetylcholine?</p>
<p>You forgot about acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Well, we didn&rsquo;t forget about acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is under control</p>
<p>more in terms of what we happen to be doing</p>
<p>at any given moment,</p>
<p>whether or not we&rsquo;re focusing or not focusing,</p>
<p>whether or not we&rsquo;re learning or not learning.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m referring to acetylcholine</p>
<p>specifically in the context of the brain and thinking,</p>
<p>because as some of you are probably shouting out there,</p>
<p>right, if you&rsquo;re exercise physiologists</p>
<p>or you know anything about how the brain controls movement,</p>
<p>acetylcholine is used at the nerve to muscle synapse, right?</p>
<p>So neurons don&rsquo;t just control other neurons electrically.</p>
<p>The way you&rsquo;re able to move, in fact,</p>
<p>is because neurons are controlling</p>
<p>the electric activity of muscles,</p>
<p>literally the contraction of muscle fibers,</p>
<p>and that control is exerted</p>
<p>through the release of acetylcholine.</p>
<p>So acetylcholine is working at muscles as well,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not focused on that today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re focused on what we can do during phase one of the day</p>
<p>and what we can do during phase two of the day</p>
<p>to control the specific neuromodulators,</p>
<p>dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine</p>
<p>toward particular end goals.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve been harping on</p>
<p>for the last five or 10 minutes or so,</p>
<p>it is important to understand</p>
<p>that in the early phase one part of the day,</p>
<p>again, zero to nine hours,</p>
<p>dopamine and epinephrine already dominate</p>
<p>the neuromodulator landscape.</p>
<p>That is, they are already elevated,</p>
<p>and then they will taper off in phase two,</p>
<p>whereas in phase two of the day,</p>
<p>serotonin tends to dominate</p>
<p>more than dopamine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>And so if you think about that,</p>
<p>what it means is that if your goal is to increase serotonin</p>
<p>in order to get some particular effect</p>
<p>on your mental performance</p>
<p>or physical performance or health,</p>
<p>or if your goal is to increase your dopamine or epinephrine</p>
<p>to get some particular effect on your mental health,</p>
<p>physical performance, et cetera,</p>
<p>well, then you need to consider</p>
<p>what the background level of dopamine or epinephrine</p>
<p>or serotonin happens to be.</p>
<p>Because in doing so, you will know which tool to select</p>
<p>and how hard you need to push on that tool, right?</p>
<p>If your levels of dopamine are already riding pretty high</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the early part of the day,</p>
<p>well, then it doesn&rsquo;t take a whole lot more</p>
<p>to get dopamine to a level in which it can, for instance,</p>
<p>change your level of motivation.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re in the late part of the day,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say eight or 9 p.m.</p>
<p>and you have a lot of serotonin</p>
<p>swimming around in your system</p>
<p>and you really need to be focused and alert,</p>
<p>well, you can do that</p>
<p>by leveraging the dopamine and epinephrine system</p>
<p>and indeed the acetylcholine system too,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to have to resort to tools</p>
<p>that can do that far more potently</p>
<p>and that can do that in a much more sustained way</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to access the state that you want.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s really important to understand</p>
<p>what the backdrop of these neuromodulators is,</p>
<p>the so-called baseline,</p>
<p>and that they vary across the day</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to be able to leverage tools</p>
<p>to optimize your brain chemistry.</p>
<p>Anyone that tells you,</p>
<p>do this protocol in order to increase your dopamine,</p>
<p>do this protocol or take this supplement</p>
<p>to increase your serotonin,</p>
<p>they can be telling you the absolute truth,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t consider the backdrop</p>
<p>over which that supplement or behavior</p>
<p>is going to have its effect,</p>
<p>well, then you can&rsquo;t really predict the effect it will have,</p>
<p>but if you can understand these backdrop baseline elements</p>
<p>to how neuromodulators work,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;re in a terrific position</p>
<p>to leverage the best tools in the immediate and short term,</p>
<p>and that is on the order of seconds, minutes, and hours.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the more pointed,</p>
<p>directed effects of specific tools on neuromodulators,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just briefly mention hormones</p>
<p>because they are also important for understanding</p>
<p>the background and the context</p>
<p>and these baseline levels of neuromodulators.</p>
<p>Now, here I&rsquo;m going to paint with a bit of a broad brush,</p>
<p>but what I will say is accurate</p>
<p>even though it might not be exhaustive.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is everything I&rsquo;m about to say is true,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t cover every example in detail</p>
<p>and nuanced possibility out there.</p>
<p>Hormones have many different effects on the brain and body,</p>
<p>and not unlike neuromodulators,</p>
<p>some of those effects are very fast,</p>
<p>some of them are very slow.</p>
<p>In fact, certain hormones,</p>
<p>for instance, the steroid hormones,</p>
<p>like estrogen and like testosterone and corticosterones,</p>
<p>and here, of course,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to the steroid hormones for what they are.</p>
<p>They are indeed steroid hormones,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not talking about steroids that people inject</p>
<p>for sports performance or for physical augmentation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the steroid hormones</p>
<p>that you make naturally</p>
<p>because indeed you make these naturally.</p>
<p>Well, the steroid hormones</p>
<p>can actually control gene expression.</p>
<p>They can change the identity of cells</p>
<p>and the genes and proteins that cells express.</p>
<p>This is why during puberty, for instance,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen are released into the body,</p>
<p>growth hormone is released into the body,</p>
<p>and bodies and voices and personalities</p>
<p>and brains change tremendously</p>
<p>because literally there is a transformation</p>
<p>of the breast tissue, of the testicular tissue,</p>
<p>of the ovarian tissue, of the bones, of the muscles,</p>
<p>of the tissues and cells that control hair growth.</p>
<p>Gene expression changes in all those cell types</p>
<p>and the child becomes an adolescent,</p>
<p>becomes a young adult, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what puberty really is.</p>
<p>In fact, puberty is perhaps the most dramatic transformation</p>
<p>that we go through in our entire lifespan</p>
<p>in terms of our aging,</p>
<p>because indeed it reflects a very rapid,</p>
<p>I should mention, period of aging,</p>
<p>and transformation of the identity of cells.</p>
<p>So steroid hormones and other hormones</p>
<p>can have very slow, long-lasting actions in that way.</p>
<p>They can also have very fast actions.</p>
<p>So for instance, adrenaline, epinephrine,</p>
<p>released from the adrenal glands</p>
<p>can immediately make your heart beat faster,</p>
<p>can immediately change the circumference</p>
<p>of your blood vessels and arteries and capillaries</p>
<p>and change the way blood flows.</p>
<p>It can change the way you see the world, literally.</p>
<p>It does change the way you see the world</p>
<p>through your visual system.</p>
<p>And that all happens on the order</p>
<p>of hundreds of milliseconds or seconds.</p>
<p>These are extremely fast actions.</p>
<p>Corticosteroin also can have fast actions and slow actions.</p>
<p>But since this isn&rsquo;t a discussion about hormones per se,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve done entire episodes</p>
<p>like the Optimize Testosterone and Estrogen episode,</p>
<p>you can find that at hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>or the interview with the incredibly knowledgeable</p>
<p>and clear and really wonderful tutor</p>
<p>of actionable information, Dr. Kyle Gillette,</p>
<p>who is also on this podcast.</p>
<p>You can learn a lot about hormones there.</p>
<p>Today, we want to think about hormones</p>
<p>as they relate to these neuromodulators,</p>
<p>the dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, and acetylcholine.</p>
<p>And in general, testosterone tends to collaborate with</p>
<p>and increase the action of dopamine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not always the case,</p>
<p>but in general, when testosterone goes up, dopamine goes up.</p>
<p>And sometimes even vice versa.</p>
<p>When dopamine goes up, testosterone go up.</p>
<p>And this is true for both males and for females.</p>
<p>In general, when corticosteroins like cortisol</p>
<p>and some related steroid hormones increase,</p>
<p>epinephrine levels go up.</p>
<p>And in general, when hormones like oxytocin</p>
<p>or prolactin are increased, levels of serotonin go up.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t draw a direct link between any one hormone system</p>
<p>and acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine kind of sits off in a category</p>
<p>of its own in that way.</p>
<p>But again, in general,</p>
<p>testosterone and dopamine tend to collaborate</p>
<p>in the same direction.</p>
<p>Cortisol and epinephrine tend to collaborate</p>
<p>in the same direction.</p>
<p>Oxytocin and prolactin, which are hormones,</p>
<p>and serotonin tend to collaborate in the same direction.</p>
<p>And then we have poor old lonely acetylcholine</p>
<p>off on its own, but it&rsquo;s not poor and lonely.</p>
<p>It actually has incredibly potent effects on its own.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really that it just doesn&rsquo;t need much help</p>
<p>from the hormone systems,</p>
<p>or at least not the steroid hormone systems</p>
<p>in order to have its tremendous effects.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of what people think about and will do</p>
<p>when trying to improve mental health and physical health</p>
<p>is they will try and increase or decrease</p>
<p>certain categories of hormones of the sort that I mentioned,</p>
<p>testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, and so on.</p>
<p>But oftentimes the effects of those manipulations</p>
<p>in hormones that are going to be most salient</p>
<p>are not going to be due to the direct effects</p>
<p>of those hormones.</p>
<p>Sometimes it could be,</p>
<p>but oftentimes it&rsquo;s going to be due to their effects</p>
<p>on the brain and nervous system</p>
<p>by way of how those hormones impact neuromodulators.</p>
<p>So for instance, there are various things</p>
<p>that people can do, both men and women,</p>
<p>to increase their testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>in the appropriate ratios.</p>
<p>I talked about one such approach a previous episode,</p>
<p>and that is to get sunlight onto a large portion</p>
<p>of one&rsquo;s skin each day.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this actually works,</p>
<p>and it works because your skin</p>
<p>is actually an endocrine organ, a hormone-secreting organ.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful study.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered it on this podcast before.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to this study again,</p>
<p>but it had people spend at least 20 minutes or so,</p>
<p>closer to 30 minutes each day,</p>
<p>trying to maximize sunlight exposure</p>
<p>to as much of their skin as they could</p>
<p>in terms of still maintaining decent exposure,</p>
<p>meaning not overexposing themselves in a cultural way,</p>
<p>meaning wearing enough clothes that they were decent,</p>
<p>but still getting a lot of sun exposure</p>
<p>a couple of times per week or more.</p>
<p>What they found was that people&rsquo;s testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen levels went up,</p>
<p>feelings of well-being went up,</p>
<p>feelings of well, or I should say,</p>
<p>increases in libido were observed as well.</p>
<p>They subjectively reported more passion, et cetera.</p>
<p>Testosterone and estrogen did indeed both go up,</p>
<p>and again, I want to highlight that increases in estrogen,</p>
<p>not just testosterone,</p>
<p>are related to increases in libido in both men and women.</p>
<p>This is why you never want to crush your estrogen</p>
<p>down to zero, whether or not you&rsquo;re male or female,</p>
<p>if you want to maintain some sort of healthy libido</p>
<p>and general feelings of well-being unrelated to libido.</p>
<p>Well, many of those effects we know</p>
<p>are not due to direct effects of testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>but rather are due to the effects of testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen on the neuromodulators dopamine and serotonin,</p>
<p>because much of libido and feelings of well-being</p>
<p>and feelings of relaxation,</p>
<p>but also desire, motivation, et cetera,</p>
<p>originate because of the activation of neural circuits</p>
<p>that dopamine controls and promotes</p>
<p>and that serotonin promote and control.</p>
<p>So this is very important to understand</p>
<p>as we move toward more specific discussion of the chemicals</p>
<p>that we call neuromodulators,</p>
<p>because hormones are controlling those neuromodulators</p>
<p>in a very slow modulatory way.</p>
<p>So yes, I said it.</p>
<p>Hormones modulate neuromodulators.</p>
<p>I sort of said it twice on purpose.</p>
<p>And this is a dramatic and potent effect.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just give you one more example.</p>
<p>The hormone prolactin tends to be antagonistic.</p>
<p>It tends to reduce amounts of dopamine</p>
<p>or at least when prolactin levels are high,</p>
<p>dopamine levels tend to be lower.</p>
<p>You observe this after the birth of a new child.</p>
<p>You observe this post-coitally after mating</p>
<p>in all species, humans and animals.</p>
<p>When prolactin is elevated, serotonin tends to be elevated.</p>
<p>And when prolactin is elevated,</p>
<p>levels of dopamine and the effects of dopamine</p>
<p>tend to subside.</p>
<p>Now, as I move toward explaining</p>
<p>what each of the four categories of neuromodulators do,</p>
<p>this will start to make more and more sense</p>
<p>as to why this would be.</p>
<p>I always say, I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase,</p>
<p>meaning I didn&rsquo;t design these circuits.</p>
<p>And if anyone tells you that they did,</p>
<p>you should back away quickly</p>
<p>because none of us designed these circuits.</p>
<p>This is the way that evolution</p>
<p>and nature created these systems.</p>
<p>And they tend to work in a bit of a seesaw fashion,</p>
<p>prolactin up, dopamine down, right?</p>
<p>Dopamine up, prolactin down.</p>
<p>In general, that is the way they work.</p>
<p>So if we are to take a look at how each of these</p>
<p>neuromodulator systems functions on its own,</p>
<p>while understanding that they never truly function</p>
<p>on their own, we can start to really make sense</p>
<p>of the landscape of tools that are available to us</p>
<p>and which tools are going to be most powerful to select</p>
<p>if our goal is, for instance, to be focused,</p>
<p>or if our goal is to be less stressed,</p>
<p>or if our goal is to be highly motivated</p>
<p>and highly focused for sake of learning.</p>
<p>All of that is indeed possible</p>
<p>if you understand these four neuromodulators</p>
<p>and you understand that while there are many tools</p>
<p>ranging from pharmacologic to behavioral</p>
<p>that can tap into these neuromodulator systems</p>
<p>that can kind of press on the gas of dopamine,</p>
<p>pull back on serotonin and so on,</p>
<p>but that there are particular tools,</p>
<p>both behavioral and supplementation-based</p>
<p>and to some extent, prescription drug-based too,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll touch on a few of those.</p>
<p>If you understand that and why they work,</p>
<p>well, then you can create a sort of kit,</p>
<p>a grab bag of things that you can use in any context,</p>
<p>or I should say that you can look to,</p>
<p>depending on the context you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>and create the states of body and mind that you want.</p>
<p>Now, once again, painting with a somewhat broad brush,</p>
<p>but nonetheless an accurate brush,</p>
<p>we can say that dopamine, when elevated above baseline,</p>
<p>tends to increase states of motivation,</p>
<p>both mental and physical motivation,</p>
<p>drive, and to some extent, focus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it many times before, and I&rsquo;ll say it again,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of misconception about dopamine.</p>
<p>Many people out there think that dopamine</p>
<p>is all about pleasure.</p>
<p>You hear about dopamine hits or people chasing dopamine</p>
<p>or the need to have a dopamine fast, et cetera.</p>
<p>Dopamine is not about pleasure.</p>
<p>Dopamine is about motivation, craving, and pursuit</p>
<p>for goals or for things that are outside</p>
<p>our immediate possession and experience.</p>
<p>The motivation and pursuit of a mate,</p>
<p>the motivation and pursuit to mate,</p>
<p>the motivation and pursuit of food,</p>
<p>the motivation and pursuit of a career goal,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Things we do not yet have, but that we want,</p>
<p>and we get into sort of a forward center of mass</p>
<p>and a pursuit of, and that pursuit can be physical,</p>
<p>that pursuit can be cognitive,</p>
<p>it can be both cognitive and physical,</p>
<p>and it can involve talking about something, right?</p>
<p>Because in some professions,</p>
<p>pursuit of things involves talking.</p>
<p>I think about lawyers, they talk a lot in pursuit</p>
<p>of winning cases and money, et cetera,</p>
<p>putting people in jail or keeping people out of jail,</p>
<p>et cetera, that&rsquo;s done with their mouths,</p>
<p>not with their bodies.</p>
<p>Athletes in a state of motivated training</p>
<p>or in motivated competition use their bodies,</p>
<p>which all of this is obvious, of course,</p>
<p>but perhaps what is not so obvious</p>
<p>is that one molecule, not working alone,</p>
<p>but predominantly one molecule, dopamine,</p>
<p>is responsible for all of those motivated states,</p>
<p>which again, underscores the power</p>
<p>of these neuromodulators.</p>
<p>So dopamine, we can think of,</p>
<p>at least in the context of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>as controlling and indeed promoting motivation,</p>
<p>drive, and pursuit, and to some extent, focus.</p>
<p>Epinephrine and a closely related molecule</p>
<p>called norepinephrine, and again, I want to emphasize</p>
<p>that epinephrine is adrenaline,</p>
<p>and adrenaline is epinephrine.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine is noradrenaline,</p>
<p>and noradrenaline is norepinephrine,</p>
<p>but today we&rsquo;re going to just simply talk</p>
<p>about epinephrine and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>That category of neuromodulator is mainly responsible</p>
<p>for generating our energy,</p>
<p>our level of fuel and baseline level</p>
<p>of forward center of mass, as I like to call it.</p>
<p>You can also think of it as how high your RPM are.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re not a car,</p>
<p>and the car analogy sort of falls apart</p>
<p>as we go further into the biology,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a decent one for now.</p>
<p>When epinephrine levels are high, we tend to feel agitated.</p>
<p>We tend to feel like we want to move.</p>
<p>We tend to feel like we can&rsquo;t shut down our thinking</p>
<p>and our anticipation of what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>
<p>And when epinephrine levels are very, very low,</p>
<p>we actually have less physical energy.</p>
<p>We tend to have less mental energy</p>
<p>in terms of generating thoughts very quickly,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>dopamine and epinephrine are closely related,</p>
<p>so much so that we know for a fact</p>
<p>that epinephrine is actually manufactured</p>
<p>from the molecule dopamine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m talking about these two neuromodulators</p>
<p>in very close juxtaposition,</p>
<p>because they do indeed collaborate with one another.</p>
<p>But for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>we can just think of epinephrine as increasing energy,</p>
<p>adrenaline increases energy and our state of readiness.</p>
<p>It also, I should mention, activates our immune system.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief</p>
<p>that stress inhibits our immune system,</p>
<p>epinephrine is deployed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s released at great levels in our brain and body</p>
<p>when we are stressed,</p>
<p>and that actually protects us against infections</p>
<p>of multiple kinds, at least in the short term.</p>
<p>That and all the details of that and tools related to that</p>
<p>were covered in our episode on the immune system,</p>
<p>if you want to check that out.</p>
<p>Now, the neuromodulator serotonin</p>
<p>creates a number of different states in the brain and body,</p>
<p>but for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to think about the predominant states</p>
<p>that it creates, and those are states of contentness,</p>
<p>being happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed,</p>
<p>and to some extent, even some relief from pain</p>
<p>or lack of pain.</p>
<p>Serotonin is associated with a feeling of satiety,</p>
<p>of having enough of what we already have.</p>
<p>Now, when serotonin is very, very high,</p>
<p>people can even be sedate.</p>
<p>They can be completely amotivated,</p>
<p>no motivation to seek out things like food or sex or work,</p>
<p>or et cetera, whereas when serotonin levels are very low,</p>
<p>people can actually exhibit agitation</p>
<p>and high levels of stress.</p>
<p>So the levels matter here,</p>
<p>but again, for sake of today&rsquo;s conversation,</p>
<p>when we leverage serotonin,</p>
<p>we are really leveraging a neuromodulator</p>
<p>that tends to increase the activity of neural circuits</p>
<p>in the brain and body that make us feel relaxed and happy,</p>
<p>and it tends to decrease the activity of neural circuits</p>
<p>that make us rabidly in pursuit of things</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have, right?</p>
<p>The opposite of content and sated is motivation, desire,</p>
<p>and hunger and thirst for things that we don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So serotonin is the molecule of peace.</p>
<p>It is the molecule of contentness.</p>
<p>It is the molecule of having enough,</p>
<p>at least for the time being,</p>
<p>or the feeling that we have enough for the time being.</p>
<p>Now, acetylcholine is a fourth category of neuromodulator</p>
<p>that, as I mentioned earlier, is somewhat, not totally,</p>
<p>but somewhat distinct from any direct control</p>
<p>by the major hormone systems of the body,</p>
<p>or at least the major steroid hormone systems.</p>
<p>And acetylcholine, we can say,</p>
<p>is mainly associated with states of focus.</p>
<p>And we can go a step further and say</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s mainly associated with steps of focus</p>
<p>as they relate to learning and encoding new information,</p>
<p>so-called neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Now, neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>or the brain and nervous system&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to change in response to experience,</p>
<p>can be impacted by an enormous number of different chemicals,</p>
<p>not just acetylcholine.</p>
<p>But acetylcholine has a particularly potent ability</p>
<p>to open up the thing that we call neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>to allow plasticity to happen in one moment,</p>
<p>whereas in a previous moment,</p>
<p>it could not occur because acetylcholine</p>
<p>had not been released in the brain or in the spinal cord.</p>
<p>So acetylcholine is involved in focus and in learning,</p>
<p>but it is not necessarily always associated</p>
<p>with learning in the context of highly motivated,</p>
<p>really ramped up states.</p>
<p>It can be, but acetylcholine can also be released</p>
<p>and can encourage the learning and neuroplasticity</p>
<p>associated with calm states.</p>
<p>For instance, if somebody has a newborn child,</p>
<p>we know that they are flooded with oxytocin,</p>
<p>which has actually even been called the love hormone,</p>
<p>although it does many things in addition</p>
<p>to control feelings of romantic attachment</p>
<p>and attachment to children, et cetera.</p>
<p>It does all of that, but it does a lot more as well.</p>
<p>But when people have a new child,</p>
<p>they also tend to be hyper-focused on that child,</p>
<p>not just its wellbeing, but they narrow all their thinking,</p>
<p>all their vision, all their hearing to that child,</p>
<p>and there are obvious adaptive reasons</p>
<p>for wanting to do that.</p>
<p>I recall a family dinner we had,</p>
<p>gosh, this was over 10 years ago.</p>
<p>We had a couple over.</p>
<p>My mom was in the habit of inviting people over</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t have places to go on the holidays</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just who she is,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s quite nice.</p>
<p>So she brought over this couple.</p>
<p>They had a newborn.</p>
<p>I think this baby had been born</p>
<p>maybe two or three weeks before,</p>
<p>and it was seated, or not seated.</p>
<p>It was lying down.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>It was like a potato bug.</p>
<p>It could barely hold its head up.</p>
<p>But it was lying in a little bassinet on the floor</p>
<p>as we ate dinner, and it was almost hilarious.</p>
<p>It actually was hilarious.</p>
<p>We laughed a lot about this,</p>
<p>that the entire meal,</p>
<p>they were basically staring at this baby.</p>
<p>They were so clearly in love with the baby</p>
<p>and so flooded with oxytocin and also prolactin</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t take their focus off this baby.</p>
<p>It was actually really wonderful and endearing to see.</p>
<p>But in addition to that, I&rsquo;d be willing to bet,</p>
<p>had I been able to do a little bit of microdialysis,</p>
<p>which is an ability to measure the amounts</p>
<p>of neuromodulator at a given location in the brain,</p>
<p>had I been able to do that experiment on them</p>
<p>in that moment, I would have found</p>
<p>that levels of acetylcholine were exceedingly high</p>
<p>because they were so hyper-focused on this child,</p>
<p>not just in love with, but focused on that child.</p>
<p>And without a doubt, the neural circuits</p>
<p>related to focus and plasticity were heavily engaged,</p>
<p>again, for obvious adaptive reasons</p>
<p>related to child rearing and learning the coos and cries</p>
<p>and pain signals and pleasure signals of one&rsquo;s offspring.</p>
<p>So we have dopamine associated with motivation,</p>
<p>drive and pursuit, and to some extent focus.</p>
<p>We have epinephrine and norepinephrine associated</p>
<p>with energy of having a forward center of mass</p>
<p>mentally and or physically.</p>
<p>We have serotonin, which is associated</p>
<p>with a peaceful, content, sated state of being.</p>
<p>And we have acetylcholine, which is associated with focus</p>
<p>and in particular focus as it relates to learning</p>
<p>and encoding new information.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you want to be more motivated.</p>
<p>You want to be more in pursuit of goals</p>
<p>and you want to have more energy and to be more focused.</p>
<p>There are many ways to go about that.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a near infinite cloud of opportunities,</p>
<p>everything from prescription drugs to illicit drugs,</p>
<p>which I certainly do not recommend,</p>
<p>supplements, nutrition.</p>
<p>You can listen to particular music.</p>
<p>You can do all sorts of cognitive, behavioral,</p>
<p>nutritional supplementation tricks,</p>
<p>or you can just understand that what you&rsquo;re really after</p>
<p>are increases in dopamine above baseline that you control.</p>
<p>And there are ways to control them that are quite potent.</p>
<p>And science tells us which tools are going to be</p>
<p>the most potent and the most versatile for you.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to share those tools with you now</p>
<p>with the caveat that each one of those tools</p>
<p>could be its own entire podcast episode</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;ve done it near entire episodes</p>
<p>on each of these tools or small collections of these tools.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to cover these in somewhat superficial manner.</p>
<p>We can provide links to previous episodes</p>
<p>that relate to each of these tools in detail,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll give you enough detail about them</p>
<p>that would allow you to incorporate them into your routine</p>
<p>should you choose.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to increase dopamine</p>
<p>for sake of increasing motivation.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to understand</p>
<p>what the natural behavioral tools are</p>
<p>for increasing dopamine</p>
<p>and to do those as consistently as possible.</p>
<p>Again, these are tools that you&rsquo;ll want to do</p>
<p>nearly every day, if not every day.</p>
<p>And I know I&rsquo;m sounding like a broken record on this one,</p>
<p>but here again, we come to sunlight.</p>
<p>And I should say not just the desire to,</p>
<p>but really the need for viewing the maximum amount</p>
<p>of sunlight that one can reasonably get</p>
<p>given schedules and locations in the world,</p>
<p>time of year, et cetera, in the early part of the day.</p>
<p>Within the first hour of waking,</p>
<p>ideally, but certainly in the first three hours of your day,</p>
<p>you are going to want to maximize</p>
<p>sunlight exposure to your eyes.</p>
<p>Never look at the sun or any other light so bright</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s painful to look at.</p>
<p>And yes, of course, blinking is fine,</p>
<p>but no, take sunglasses off,</p>
<p>go outside once the sun is out</p>
<p>and get some natural light in your eyes.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s appropriate,</p>
<p>or I should say in a way that&rsquo;s appropriate,</p>
<p>maximize the amount of sunlight exposure to your skin,</p>
<p>but please don&rsquo;t get burned.</p>
<p>Please do wear sunscreen if you&rsquo;re prone to getting burned.</p>
<p>Typically early day sunlight is not going to burn you,</p>
<p>at least not most people,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re extremely fair skinned.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t get burned,</p>
<p>do what you need to in order to protect yourself from burn.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some emerging controversy about sunscreen</p>
<p>and which ones are safe and which ones aren&rsquo;t safe.</p>
<p>We have not done an episode on that yet,</p>
<p>but I find it to be an important and interesting topic.</p>
<p>Daria Rose, Dr. Daria Rose, I should say,</p>
<p>has a podcast called the Daria Rose Podcast</p>
<p>and did an episode all about sunscreens,</p>
<p>which are safe, which are not safe,</p>
<p>by interviewing an expert on that.</p>
<p>So I refer you to that podcast as it relates to sunscreen,</p>
<p>but get some natural light exposure in your eyes.</p>
<p>And if you wake up before the sun comes out,</p>
<p>turn on as many bright lights inside</p>
<p>as you can turn on reasonably</p>
<p>given your electric bill, et cetera.</p>
<p>Get a lot of bright sunlight exposure early in the day</p>
<p>and get a lot of sunlight exposure to your skin</p>
<p>in the early part of the day</p>
<p>in a way that doesn&rsquo;t burn you,</p>
<p>meaning burn your skin or blind you.</p>
<p>Please, please don&rsquo;t do anything that harms your vision,</p>
<p>like staring into bright light that&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>What does that do?</p>
<p>Well, it sets in motion</p>
<p>a number of different biological cascades.</p>
<p>Some are very fast.</p>
<p>There are fast actions of sunlight that will trigger,</p>
<p>for instance, dopamine release</p>
<p>from different parts of your brain and your endocrine system.</p>
<p>And we now know that it increases levels</p>
<p>of genes related to thyroid hormone</p>
<p>and actually increases certain dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a wonderful paper.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to this paper</p>
<p>that shows that sunlight exposure</p>
<p>can actually increase the amount of so-called DRD4.</p>
<p>This is a particular type of dopamine receptor,</p>
<p>the dopamine receptor four.</p>
<p>The genes for dopamine receptor four</p>
<p>are actually under photic control.</p>
<p>So if you get sunlight exposure to your eyes</p>
<p>and it does have to be to your eyes</p>
<p>in the early part of the day,</p>
<p>you increase the amount of dopamine receptor that you have,</p>
<p>which allows whatever circulating dopamine</p>
<p>happens to be there to have a greater effect on motivation.</p>
<p>And I should say also on mood and feelings</p>
<p>of being in pursuit</p>
<p>and generally in craving and pursuit of things in life.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s another way to increase the effect</p>
<p>of whatever dopamine happens to be circulating</p>
<p>in your brain and body.</p>
<p>And this again relates to increasing the number</p>
<p>or the efficacy of the receptors for dopamine.</p>
<p>Now here we&rsquo;re not talking about the dopamine receptor four,</p>
<p>but a different category of dopamine receptors,</p>
<p>the D2 and D3 receptors,</p>
<p>which are expressed multiple places in your brain and body</p>
<p>and bind dopamine,</p>
<p>meaning dopamine parks in them like a parking spot</p>
<p>and allows dopamine to generally increase the activity</p>
<p>of the neurons and cells</p>
<p>that express those dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that regular ingestion of caffeine</p>
<p>at safe and appropriate levels about 100 to 250 milligrams</p>
<p>is going to increase the number</p>
<p>of D2 and D3 dopamine receptors.</p>
<p>I talked a little bit about this on a previous episode.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;ll provide links to these studies,</p>
<p>but this is an important finding, I believe,</p>
<p>because this is not about the acute,</p>
<p>the immediate effects of caffeine on alertness,</p>
<p>although those occur too.</p>
<p>When you drink caffeine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to increase your levels of adrenaline</p>
<p>and so-called epinephrine,</p>
<p>which will increase your energy levels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to decrease levels of something called adenosine,</p>
<p>which builds up while you&rsquo;re sleepy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to make you feel less sleepy,</p>
<p>more alert, more energetic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of obvious.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s less obvious is that it&rsquo;s increasing the number</p>
<p>and efficacy of dopamine receptors</p>
<p>so that whatever dopamine happens to be around</p>
<p>in your system is going to have more of a potent effect.</p>
<p>So how much caffeine should you drink?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to vary from person to person.</p>
<p>Some people are very sensitive to caffeine, others are not.</p>
<p>I tend to be fairly insensitive to caffeine</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been drinking it for a long period of time.</p>
<p>But, you know, after one or two cups of espresso or coffee,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve had enough.</p>
<p>I tend to drink my caffeine early in the day,</p>
<p>which is what I&rsquo;m going to recommend that you do,</p>
<p>not drinking caffeine past two and certainly not 4 p.m.</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on a typical schedule</p>
<p>and you want to be able to sleep that night,</p>
<p>even if you can fall asleep.</p>
<p>Having too much caffeine in your system is not good</p>
<p>because it disrupts the architecture of sleep.</p>
<p>And now knowing about all the metabolic variability</p>
<p>across the night, according to different stages of sleep,</p>
<p>it should be even more obvious</p>
<p>as to why disrupting the architecture of sleep</p>
<p>would be bad for you.</p>
<p>So limit that caffeine intake to early in the day</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t go ballistic if you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>certainly don&rsquo;t go ballistic in any case.</p>
<p>But for most people,</p>
<p>anywhere from 100 to 400 milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>is going to have this effect.</p>
<p>And this effect, again, is a slow accumulating effect</p>
<p>by drinking caffeine consistently day to day.</p>
<p>I get my caffeine mainly from yerba mate tea.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that it&rsquo;s probably a good idea</p>
<p>to stay away from the smoked mates.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some evidence those can be carcinogenic,</p>
<p>but I brew my own yerba mate tea</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll drink coffee or espresso</p>
<p>or sometimes both, frankly,</p>
<p>as long as I&rsquo;m hydrating enough and I&rsquo;m getting enough salt,</p>
<p>then I tend to feel fine with that much caffeine.</p>
<p>The other way to increase dopamine</p>
<p>and to make sure that your baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>are high enough is to make sure that you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>sufficient numbers of tyrosine-rich foods.</p>
<p>You can look up which foods include tyrosine.</p>
<p>Tyrosine is a precursor to dopamine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amino acid that is a direct pathway</p>
<p>to dopamine synthesis.</p>
<p>And tyrosine foods include things like certain meats,</p>
<p>Parmesan cheese, very high in tyrosine, for instance.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s something called the cheese effect,</p>
<p>believe it or not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go too far off topic,</p>
<p>but the cheese effect is kind of interesting</p>
<p>because certain people will take antidepressants</p>
<p>that are so-called MAO inhibitors,</p>
<p>monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</p>
<p>Anytime you hear A-S-E, that&rsquo;s an enzyme,</p>
<p>they will take these inhibitors that prevent</p>
<p>the breakdown of dopamine and other so-called catecholamines</p>
<p>which allow more dopamine to be in circulation.</p>
<p>But if these people eat certain cheeses,</p>
<p>including Parmesan cheese, and there are other foods,</p>
<p>of course, that include not just tyrosine,</p>
<p>but one of the derivatives of tyrosine called teramine,</p>
<p>that generates what&rsquo;s called the cheese effect,</p>
<p>which is people get potent migraines, headaches,</p>
<p>blood pressure goes up.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, because they&rsquo;ve got a lot of tyrosine in their system</p>
<p>and dopamine in their system,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got less of the enzyme that removes that dopamine</p>
<p>or limits its action.</p>
<p>And so they have an excess of dopamine</p>
<p>and dopamine has effects on blood pressure, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the cheese effect is something to avoid.</p>
<p>If you are somebody who&rsquo;s taking drugs that tap into</p>
<p>or manipulate the dopamine pathway,</p>
<p>either for Parkinson&rsquo;s or depressions,</p>
<p>obviously you&rsquo;re going to want to be careful about</p>
<p>adjusting up or down levels of dopamine too potently.</p>
<p>So mind the cheese effect if you&rsquo;re taking an MAO inhibitor.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of information about this online.</p>
<p>For most people, eating foods like Parmesan cheese,</p>
<p>eating foods like certain meats and certain vegetables</p>
<p>also can increase tyrosine levels,</p>
<p>which will increase dopamine synthesis.</p>
<p>So these are ways of modulating more or less the baseline</p>
<p>of dopamine that you are able to produce</p>
<p>and the ways that dopamine can have its action</p>
<p>by way of binding to receptors more potently.</p>
<p>Now, there are other ways to increase dopamine</p>
<p>in a more acute or directed way,</p>
<p>ways to spike your dopamine,</p>
<p>to enhance your state of motivation, mood, focus, and so on.</p>
<p>And in thinking about the vast landscape of tools</p>
<p>that can do that, we have one category of tools,</p>
<p>which are the really, really bad things</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t recommend anybody do.</p>
<p>In fact, I recommend nobody do ever,</p>
<p>which are things like cocaine, methamphetamine, et cetera.</p>
<p>They are incredibly destructive for lives</p>
<p>because of the way that they so potently increase dopamine</p>
<p>and then the crash in dopamine that occurs later.</p>
<p>I mean, they can indeed and often do ruin lives.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re leaving those off the table.</p>
<p>There are, of course, prescription drugs</p>
<p>that many people, especially people</p>
<p>who have clinically diagnosed ADHD,</p>
<p>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,</p>
<p>rely on and, in fact, benefit from in many cases,</p>
<p>things like Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there&rsquo;s also a lot of interest</p>
<p>in use of things like modafinil, R-modafinil.</p>
<p>I covered all of those in the episode on ADHD,</p>
<p>and you can find that at hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>and the other places this podcast is found.</p>
<p>Prescription drugs aside,</p>
<p>because they require a prescription and a discussion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in-depth and appropriate with your physician,</p>
<p>healthcare provider,</p>
<p>there are supplements</p>
<p>that can very potently increase dopamine as well,</p>
<p>perhaps not to the extent</p>
<p>that some of those other prescription drugs can,</p>
<p>but certainly to a degree that will impact</p>
<p>and increase dopamine and motivation</p>
<p>and the other states dopamine is associated with.</p>
<p>And the two main categories of supplements</p>
<p>that are very effective in raising dopamine,</p>
<p>and here I should provide the caveat</p>
<p>that anytime you&rsquo;re going to add or remove anything</p>
<p>from your supplementation protocols,</p>
<p>please talk to a physician</p>
<p>who is knowledgeable on these topics.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody who has</p>
<p>or is taking drugs for depression or mania,</p>
<p>please be very cautious</p>
<p>about manipulating your dopamine in any case.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just say that to protect us,</p>
<p>I say that to protect you.</p>
<p>But if we were to look at the supplement landscape</p>
<p>and ask which supplements increase dopamine,</p>
<p>there are a vast number of them,</p>
<p>but the three main ones,</p>
<p>the most effective ones that are readily available out there</p>
<p>without a prescription are mucuna prurines.</p>
<p>This is actually the outside of a velvety bean</p>
<p>that has been extracted and put into a supplement.</p>
<p>Mucuna prurines is actual L-DOPA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 99% L-DOPA, which is a prescription drug</p>
<p>that is given for Parkinson&rsquo;s and for other purposes</p>
<p>where increasing dopamine is important.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend mucuna prurines.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that no one should take it,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t take it and I don&rsquo;t recommend it</p>
<p>because it tends to so potently</p>
<p>and acutely increase dopamine</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a pretty substantial crash afterwards.</p>
<p>So I avoid it and I don&rsquo;t generally suggest</p>
<p>that anyone take it unless there&rsquo;s really a clinical need</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re working very closely with somebody</p>
<p>that can really monitor that.</p>
<p>The other two supplements that can increase dopamine</p>
<p>in a short-term way, but in a significant way,</p>
<p>are L-tyrosine, so you can buy that</p>
<p>as a supplement amino acid.</p>
<p>I sometimes take this.</p>
<p>I would say I probably take it about once a week maximum</p>
<p>for work bouts or workouts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it in dosages of anywhere</p>
<p>from 500 milligrams to 1,000 milligrams.</p>
<p>People vary tremendously in their sensitivity</p>
<p>to supplementing L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>I know people that can take two grams.</p>
<p>I know people that can barely take 100 milligrams.</p>
<p>I know people that the best dose for them is zero milligrams.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of variation there</p>
<p>depending on sensitivity</p>
<p>and their natural baseline levels of dopamine</p>
<p>and whether or not they&rsquo;re doing a lot of other things</p>
<p>to support dopamine.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, taking L-tyrosine will lead</p>
<p>to fairly substantial increases in dopamine</p>
<p>within about 15 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>And it lasts for about 30 minutes to two hours.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s kind of a tapering off.</p>
<p>Some people experience a little bit of an emotional</p>
<p>or, and, or I should say energetic crash.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then the other supplement that I certainly use</p>
<p>and that I know a number of other people use</p>
<p>is more fast acting, but more potent,</p>
<p>which is phenolethylamine.</p>
<p>This relates to the so-called PEA molecule, P-P-E-A.</p>
<p>And phenolethylamine increases dopamine</p>
<p>and some metabolites related to dopamine</p>
<p>in ways that really increase energy</p>
<p>and feelings of wellbeing and motivation.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s fast acting.</p>
<p>So my particular protocol, the one I use,</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ll take phenolethylamine at dosages</p>
<p>of about 300 to 600 milligrams,</p>
<p>along with some L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll take it on its own with a molecule,</p>
<p>or I should say a compound</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about a little bit later</p>
<p>as it relates to acetylcholine alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>But tyrosine and phenolethylamine taken alone or together</p>
<p>will make you feel more motivated and more alert,</p>
<p>more willing and able to lean</p>
<p>into particular motivated behaviors,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re physical or cognitive.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about these compounds</p>
<p>and their supplementation and their effects,</p>
<p>I encourage you to check out</p>
<p>the ever valuable website, examine.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s zero cost to access and they provide references</p>
<p>and some more details about these sorts of compounds</p>
<p>and other related compounds.</p>
<p>Now, if we were going to look at behavioral tools</p>
<p>for potently increasing dopamine,</p>
<p>that too is a vast landscape.</p>
<p>And we know based on hundreds, if not thousands of studies,</p>
<p>that things like winning at some sort of competition</p>
<p>or succeeding in reaching a goal</p>
<p>can certainly increase dopamine.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about this in the episode</p>
<p>on dopamine motivation and drive.</p>
<p>But leaving that aside,</p>
<p>there are certain behavioral protocols</p>
<p>that are unrelated to your overall goals and motivations</p>
<p>that can increase dopamine in a very sustained way.</p>
<p>And without question,</p>
<p>the most potent behavioral tool for doing that</p>
<p>is going to be deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Deliberate cold exposure has been talked about a lot here</p>
<p>and elsewhere in terms of its ability</p>
<p>to do things like reduce inflammation</p>
<p>as a way to test and improve resilience</p>
<p>because uncomfortable cold,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s applied safely,</p>
<p>is a great way to learn to be more resilient</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re essentially staying</p>
<p>or forcing yourself to stay in a circumstance</p>
<p>where your system is flooded with adrenaline.</p>
<p>But one lesser known aspect of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>is one that&rsquo;s been demonstrated quite convincingly</p>
<p>in humans.</p>
<p>It comes from a study published in the year 2000.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll link to this study.</p>
<p>I love this study, by the way.</p>
<p>I covered it many times on this podcast</p>
<p>because I love it so much and I think it&rsquo;s truly important.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the study from Sromick et al.</p>
<p>Entitled Human Physiological Responses to Immersion</p>
<p>into Water of Different Temperatures.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into this into a ton of detail</p>
<p>for sake of time,</p>
<p>but basically what they show</p>
<p>is that putting people into cold water,</p>
<p>and I should mention the water that they used in this study</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t that cold.</p>
<p>They had a bunch of different conditions,</p>
<p>but they had people that got into, for instance,</p>
<p>60 degree Fahrenheit water for up to two hours.</p>
<p>I had them sitting there in a lawn chair up to their neck,</p>
<p>had very long sustained increases in dopamine transmission</p>
<p>and dopamine circulation in their brain and body.</p>
<p>And also some of the other catecholamines.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before,</p>
<p>dopamine tends to collaborate with epinephrine</p>
<p>and vice versa.</p>
<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t need to put yourself</p>
<p>into 60 degree Fahrenheit water</p>
<p>to get these kinds of sustained increases.</p>
<p>And you certainly don&rsquo;t need to do it for two hours.</p>
<p>We have strong reason to believe</p>
<p>based on subsequent studies,</p>
<p>in fact, published just this last year,</p>
<p>that getting into much colder water of say 50 degrees</p>
<p>or 55 degrees or even 45 degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p>can potently increase dopamine and epinephrine as well.</p>
<p>And that you don&rsquo;t need to expose yourself</p>
<p>to that cold water for nearly as long.</p>
<p>So perhaps even as short as one minute</p>
<p>or even 30 seconds exposure to really cold water</p>
<p>can lead to these potent long-lasting increases in dopamine.</p>
<p>Many people will ask which protocols to follow.</p>
<p>For instance, will a cold shower suffice?</p>
<p>Very likely yes, if your shower gets cold enough.</p>
<p>Do you need ice floating in the bath?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s all about the temperature</p>
<p>and not whether or not there&rsquo;s ice present or not.</p>
<p>How long to stay in there?</p>
<p>There are a lot of details</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have time to go into this episode.</p>
<p>Please see the episode on the use of deliberate cold</p>
<p>for health and performance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find that hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>We have a newsletter related to this.</p>
<p>It gets into a lot of detailed protocols.</p>
<p>But in general, we can say that the way to evoke dopamine</p>
<p>and epinephrine release using cold water</p>
<p>is to ideally you would do cold water immersion.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;d use cold shower.</p>
<p>But you want to use a temperature that is safe,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re not going to have a heart attack,</p>
<p>but that is uncomfortable</p>
<p>such that you really want to get out</p>
<p>and then staying in for anywhere from one minute</p>
<p>to 10 minutes depending on how cold adapted you are.</p>
<p>And then getting out and drying off</p>
<p>and going about your day</p>
<p>unless you have some other protocol</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to extract from the cold.</p>
<p>So this is a cold exposure protocol</p>
<p>specifically aimed at increasing dopamine.</p>
<p>For some people out there, you might think</p>
<p>this is kind of silly using cold water to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>But when you look at the data in humans</p>
<p>on the effect of cold water exposure</p>
<p>to stimulate long-lasting, very significant increases</p>
<p>in dopamine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll agree that this is a really potent tool</p>
<p>that provided it&rsquo;s given safely and gone about safely</p>
<p>is giving you the kinds of increases in dopamine</p>
<p>that you would seek using prescription pharmacology.</p>
<p>Now it shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a replacement</p>
<p>for prescription pharmacology,</p>
<p>although people have done that to success.</p>
<p>One of the previous guests on the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>was Dr. Anna Lembke,</p>
<p>our director of the Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic</p>
<p>at Stanford.</p>
<p>She has an amazing book called Dopamine Nation,</p>
<p>all about dopamine and both its uses,</p>
<p>healthy and its perils in things like addiction.</p>
<p>And she describes a patient of hers</p>
<p>that used deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>to try and maintain dopamine levels</p>
<p>while coming off of drugs</p>
<p>that were increasing dopamine so potently</p>
<p>that they were putting him down the path of addiction.</p>
<p>So the use of cold water for increasing dopamine</p>
<p>is a real tool.</p>
<p>I would say a power tool.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s the kind of thing</p>
<p>that if you want to increase dopamine for sake of motivation</p>
<p>it might be your first go-to</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re also doing the things</p>
<p>to maintain dopamine baseline,</p>
<p>like sunlight exposure in particular,</p>
<p>making sure you&rsquo;re getting sufficient amounts of tyrosine,</p>
<p>containing foods, and so on.</p>
<p>And now just very briefly,</p>
<p>I want to point to a few quick tools</p>
<p>that good peer-reviewed data tell us can be leveraged</p>
<p>in order to make sure that you have sufficient dopamine</p>
<p>when you want it or that it&rsquo;s available</p>
<p>for it to be released by any number of the tools</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve provided thus far.</p>
<p>And those are sufficient number of B vitamins.</p>
<p>So it turns out that B vitamins,</p>
<p>in particular B6 or vitamin B6</p>
<p>can potently reduce prolactin levels.</p>
<p>And again, prolactin and dopamine</p>
<p>tend to work in kind of push-pull fashion.</p>
<p>That said, you should be cautious</p>
<p>about taking excessive levels of B6.</p>
<p>It is a vitamin that if you take too much,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll likely excrete it through your urine,</p>
<p>but there is evidence that having excessively high levels</p>
<p>of B6 or supplementing with excessively high levels of B6</p>
<p>can cause some peripheral neuropathy,</p>
<p>some death of nerves in the periphery.</p>
<p>If you want to know what dosage levels are relevant there,</p>
<p>just simply look it up online.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of information about this,</p>
<p>but you do want to make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting enough B6, B12, et cetera,</p>
<p>such that you can keep prolactin levels in check.</p>
<p>And if you suspect that you have a dopamine deficiency,</p>
<p>please talk to your doctor</p>
<p>and talk to them about ways you might adjust</p>
<p>that prolactin down and thereby dopamine up.</p>
<p>The other way to ensure that dopamine levels stay high</p>
<p>or put differently,</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t quash whatever dopamine</p>
<p>you have in your system</p>
<p>is to really avoid bright light exposure to your eyes</p>
<p>between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
<p>Or another way of putting this,</p>
<p>because I realize people sleep at different times, et cetera,</p>
<p>is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes,</p>
<p>not just blue light, but all colors of light.</p>
<p>In phase three, that is 17 to 24 hours after waking up,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really when you should be asleep</p>
<p>or trying to get asleep if you&rsquo;re having trouble sleeping.</p>
<p>Work from Samer Hattar&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>the director of the chronobiology unit</p>
<p>at the National Institutes of Mental Health.</p>
<p>Again, a previous Huberman Lab podcast guest.</p>
<p>Tell us that bright light exposure in phase three</p>
<p>of your circadian cycle, 17 to 24 hours after waking,</p>
<p>can have dramatic effects in reducing dopamine levels</p>
<p>by way of activating a neural circuit</p>
<p>involving something called the habenula.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into too many details right now,</p>
<p>but really try and keep the lights dim</p>
<p>in the middle of the night or off,</p>
<p>if you can do that safely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really going to help</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re turning on your phone brightly,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re turning on bright lights,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just going to negatively impact melatonin,</p>
<p>the hormone that helps you fall and stay asleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also going to negatively impact dopamine levels,</p>
<p>not just that night, but the subsequent day.</p>
<p>So that more or less summarizes our coverage</p>
<p>of ways to use behavior and supplementation and nutrition,</p>
<p>to increase dopamine and dopamine receptor efficacy</p>
<p>and number, and to keep sufficient amounts of dopamine</p>
<p>in your system day to day for motivation, mood, and focus.</p>
<p>And of course, keep in mind those things</p>
<p>that can suppress dopamine, the bright light exposure,</p>
<p>elevated prolactin, and so on.</p>
<p>My hope is that by understanding those tools</p>
<p>and how they work and understanding</p>
<p>that dopamine does certain things and not others,</p>
<p>that you can assemble a versatile kit of behaviors</p>
<p>and other things that you can do</p>
<p>in order to adjust your dopamine levels</p>
<p>according to your particular goals.</p>
<p>I want to just briefly return to the fact, however,</p>
<p>that all of that is riding on</p>
<p>that phase one, phase two background,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s probably going to take</p>
<p>less cold water exposure,</p>
<p>or I should say less time doing cold water exposure</p>
<p>early in the day to get a big increase in dopamine</p>
<p>than it would later in the day,</p>
<p>because later in the day,</p>
<p>your baseline levels of dopamine are lower</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got more serotonin circulating.</p>
<p>That should make sense to you now</p>
<p>as to why that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>And does that mean that you should really modify</p>
<p>your protocols dramatically?</p>
<p>Probably not, but you might keep that in mind</p>
<p>that if, for instance,</p>
<p>you need to be in a highly motivated focus state</p>
<p>in the late part of the day, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>it might take a few or more of these tools in combination</p>
<p>in order to accomplish that.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who feels pretty good during the day,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re kind of lacking motivation</p>
<p>and you want to increase dopamine levels</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t yet need to</p>
<p>or want to resort to prescription drugs or supplementation,</p>
<p>well, then you might layer in</p>
<p>a couple behavioral protocols,</p>
<p>paying attention to, of course,</p>
<p>the things that you might be doing</p>
<p>that would also potentially suppress dopamine.</p>
<p>So again, that kit of tools is designed</p>
<p>for you to play with if you choose,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s safe for you to apply them, then do that.</p>
<p>Consider doing them individually,</p>
<p>not trying to hit all the tools all at once, right?</p>
<p>I mean, why throw all those tools</p>
<p>at your dopamine system at once?</p>
<p>Better would be to have those tools in your kit</p>
<p>and be able to deploy them</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you&rsquo;re on travel,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re eating well or less well,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re sleeping well or less well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s highly individual.</p>
<p>And I like to think that in having those tools in hand,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to adjust them and apply them</p>
<p>in the ways that allow you to access</p>
<p>the dopamine increases that you&rsquo;re after.</p>
<p>So next I&rsquo;d like to talk about epinephrine,</p>
<p>also called adrenaline.</p>
<p>I want to point out that epinephrine is released</p>
<p>both in the brain and the body.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a barrier between brain and body</p>
<p>that prevents the epinephrine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released from your adrenal glands</p>
<p>from crossing the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>So your brain has a separate site</p>
<p>called the locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>This is a collection of neurons in the back of the brain</p>
<p>that kind of sprinkler the rest of the brain</p>
<p>with epinephrine and essentially wakes up</p>
<p>whatever neural circuits happen to see,</p>
<p>or I should say, wake up any circuits</p>
<p>where that epinephrine happens to arrive, right?</p>
<p>And generally increase the excitability of those networks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we say epinephrine increases energy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about caloric energy,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s distantly related to this,</p>
<p>but really energy and the desire to move,</p>
<p>the feeling that we can think,</p>
<p>the feeling that we can be alert.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at somebody</p>
<p>and their eyelids are wide open,</p>
<p>in large part, that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>of a lot of adrenaline in their system.</p>
<p>If their pupils are really big</p>
<p>and their eyes are really wide open,</p>
<p>in general, that means they have</p>
<p>a lot of epinephrine circulating there.</p>
<p>Whereas when we&rsquo;re tired and we&rsquo;re kind of hood-eyed</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just sort of sleepy</p>
<p>or our pupils are really small,</p>
<p>in general, that&rsquo;s because levels of epinephrine</p>
<p>and also dopamine, remember they work together,</p>
<p>levels of epinephrine and dopamine tend to be lower.</p>
<p>This is also why when people take any drug,</p>
<p>like again, not recommending this,</p>
<p>amphetamine or cocaine or any stimulant,</p>
<p>their pupils tend to be huge,</p>
<p>their eyes tend to be wide open,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t blink very often.</p>
<p>And the opposite is true when people take sedatives.</p>
<p>So it all starts to make sense</p>
<p>when you think about the basic actions of these things.</p>
<p>For many people, increasing adrenaline</p>
<p>or epinephrine might seem like a crazy idea.</p>
<p>Most people probably associate this molecule with stress</p>
<p>and they would like to be less stressed.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done entire episodes about stress,</p>
<p>how to master stress, how to leverage stress,</p>
<p>how to conquer stress.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great tools to do that</p>
<p>that are behavioral, supplementation-based.</p>
<p>Please see the episode on mastering stress for those tools.</p>
<p>But there are people, including me,</p>
<p>that want to increase our levels of epinephrine</p>
<p>at least early in the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody who wakes up rather slowly.</p>
<p>In fact, right after waking up,</p>
<p>I rarely want to bounce out of bed.</p>
<p>I try and push myself to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always impressed by these chocowilling types</p>
<p>that are up at 4.30 or up at five and already into action.</p>
<p>I tend to be kind of thinking about thinking about</p>
<p>maybe being in action early in the day,</p>
<p>but I try and push myself to get into action,</p>
<p>which itself can increase epinephrine.</p>
<p>I should mention that any physical activity,</p>
<p>any physical activity, walking, running,</p>
<p>weightlifting, swimming, even talking for that matter</p>
<p>is going to increase levels of epinephrine.</p>
<p>Locus coeruleus is a brain structure</p>
<p>that is tightly coupled with behaviors</p>
<p>in a bi-directional way.</p>
<p>That is when you are in action,</p>
<p>you increase the amount of epinephrine released</p>
<p>from locus coeruleus, you wake up the brain.</p>
<p>And conversely, when locus coeruleus is active,</p>
<p>the brain wakes up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s reciprocal, it goes both directions.</p>
<p>So I saw a funny tweet actually earlier today.</p>
<p>It was something like going to the gym gives you energy,</p>
<p>but you need energy to go to the gym.</p>
<p>Sounds like a pyramid scheme to me, which made me chuckle.</p>
<p>But of course overlooks the fact that</p>
<p>indeed, if you have energy,</p>
<p>you are more likely to be willing to get</p>
<p>into physical movement or cognitive movement</p>
<p>and thinking hard or thinking a lot about something.</p>
<p>But also it is absolutely scientifically proven</p>
<p>that being in action increases levels of epinephrine.</p>
<p>This is why exercising early in the day</p>
<p>gives you more energy for rest of day.</p>
<p>You still might experience a little bit of a crash</p>
<p>in the afternoon, especially if you&rsquo;re getting up</p>
<p>extra early, or if you&rsquo;re drinking caffeine</p>
<p>too close to waking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this before.</p>
<p>If you drink too much caffeine close to waking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have an afternoon crash.</p>
<p>Better to push that caffeine intake out</p>
<p>about 90 to 120 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>I know this is really painful for certain people,</p>
<p>but caffeine does increase epinephrine.</p>
<p>Caffeine does other things to limit sleepiness.</p>
<p>And by pushing it out 90 to 120 minutes after waking,</p>
<p>you will avoid the afternoon crash to a large degree.</p>
<p>And if you get up and you exercise</p>
<p>or even do any movement of any kind,</p>
<p>a hundred jumping jacks or a walk, if you can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>anything like that will increase the total amount</p>
<p>of epinephrine that you secrete into your bloodstream</p>
<p>and in your brain, and will get you more energy,</p>
<p>not just in that moment, but throughout the day.</p>
<p>So keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Exercise does indeed give you energy.</p>
<p>It burns caloric energy, but it gives you neural energy</p>
<p>by way of increasing epinephrine transmission</p>
<p>from locus coeruleus.</p>
<p>And presumably if the exercise is intense enough,</p>
<p>adrenaline epinephrine release from the adrenals</p>
<p>within your body as well.</p>
<p>So we have exercise and we have caffeine as potent tools</p>
<p>for increasing epinephrine and thereby energy.</p>
<p>Another potent tool that&rsquo;s purely behavioral,</p>
<p>but is known to work based on excellent studies in humans.</p>
<p>And actually my laboratory has been doing similar types</p>
<p>of studies that are soon to be published, we hope,</p>
<p>is so-called cyclic hyperventilation.</p>
<p>Some of you may be familiar with Wim Hof breathing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also Tummo breathing, which is very similar,</p>
<p>Kundalini breathing.</p>
<p>All of those styles of breathing involve</p>
<p>cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales</p>
<p>and either passive exhales or active exhales,</p>
<p>but repeating inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale</p>
<p>in a very deep and repetitive way.</p>
<p>If you were to do that right now,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if you do it through your nose or mouth,</p>
<p>although ideally you would do the inhale through your nose</p>
<p>and the exhale through your mouth.</p>
<p>If you did that for 25 repetitions,</p>
<p>25 inhales and exhales, you would feel more alert.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d also feel more warm.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you increased epinephrine adrenaline release</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>It works the first time and it works every time</p>
<p>to increase epinephrine and thereby energy.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are protocols and great scientific</p>
<p>studies of using cyclic hyperventilation</p>
<p>for periods of minutes, if not longer,</p>
<p>where for instance, you would do 25 big inhales and exhales</p>
<p>followed by a brief breath hold with your lungs empty,</p>
<p>then repeat 25, then brief breath hold, excuse me,</p>
<p>exhale, hold your lungs empty,</p>
<p>and then repeat again for a third round if you like.</p>
<p>If you do that over and over, you&rsquo;re going to be very alert.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have more energy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to feel like you want to move around</p>
<p>a lot more.</p>
<p>In fact, you might even feel agitated.</p>
<p>So people with a lot of anxiety or prone to panic attack</p>
<p>might want to be cautious in how they train</p>
<p>and embark on that type of breathing,</p>
<p>might want to approach it a little more carefully</p>
<p>or avoid it altogether.</p>
<p>But for most people, cyclic hyperventilation</p>
<p>is simply going to get you more energized</p>
<p>and feeling like you want to move,</p>
<p>feeling like you can think more clearly</p>
<p>and you will be more wide-eyed and alert</p>
<p>because you are releasing adrenaline.</p>
<p>And the cold water exposure protocol</p>
<p>that I talked about earlier,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s covered in our episode on cold</p>
<p>and in the newsletter on cold.</p>
<p>Well, that, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>potently increases dopamine, but also epinephrine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another terrific tool,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s applied by cold shower</p>
<p>or cold immersion or some other thing like cryo,</p>
<p>that is going to make you more alert</p>
<p>because it releases adrenaline.</p>
<p>Now, we can&rsquo;t really say that there are foods</p>
<p>to increase epinephrine.</p>
<p>Rather, there are foods that include a lot of tyrosine</p>
<p>that will increase dopamine.</p>
<p>And remember, dopamine is the molecule</p>
<p>from which epinephrine is synthesized.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t really point to a particular food</p>
<p>or categories of food for increasing epinephrine.</p>
<p>I think caffeine and things like it</p>
<p>will increase epinephrine.</p>
<p>There are, of course, prescription drugs</p>
<p>that will increase epinephrine.</p>
<p>And of course, there are all sorts of so-called</p>
<p>beta blockers that will block the receptors for epinephrine</p>
<p>to make you feel calm for public speaking</p>
<p>or for various heart conditions, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the domain of physicians</p>
<p>and should really be worked out with your cardiologist,</p>
<p>with a physician, et cetera.</p>
<p>I think the tools of exercise</p>
<p>and should you want very potent increases in adrenaline,</p>
<p>high intensity exercise,</p>
<p>as well as the tools of caffeine, cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>and deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>really combined to give you a nice little kit,</p>
<p>I would say a versatile kit,</p>
<p>of ways to increase epinephrine</p>
<p>for sake of having more physical and mental energy.</p>
<p>So next is the neuromodulator acetylcholine.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>acetylcholine is associated with states of focus.</p>
<p>And those states of focus</p>
<p>can be high energy states of focus.</p>
<p>So the ones that are accompanied</p>
<p>by high levels of dopamine and epinephrine</p>
<p>and where we&rsquo;re really excited about</p>
<p>and really lasered in on something,</p>
<p>or they can be the calmer, more relaxed states of focus,</p>
<p>like reading a book or practicing music</p>
<p>or listening very carefully to somebody</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s relaxed and calm.</p>
<p>And yet nonetheless, where we have a narrow cognitive</p>
<p>and typically a narrow visual aperture</p>
<p>and typically also a narrow auditory aperture,</p>
<p>that is our auditory system and our visual system</p>
<p>and our thinking can be very broad.</p>
<p>It can be all over the place,</p>
<p>or it can be very narrow and it can be very focused.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is released from two major sites in the brain,</p>
<p>nucleus basalis, which is in the forebrain,</p>
<p>and extends connections out to many different brain areas</p>
<p>to offer the opportunity to release acetylcholine locally</p>
<p>and more or less in a chemical way,</p>
<p>highlight those particular neurons and synapses</p>
<p>for strengthening for plasticity later.</p>
<p>And it is released from sites in the back of the brain</p>
<p>in a way that can increase the so-called fidelity</p>
<p>of information coming in through our eyes,</p>
<p>our ears, our nose, et cetera.</p>
<p>What do I mean by fidelity?</p>
<p>Well, we are constantly being bombarded</p>
<p>with sensory information through all of our various senses.</p>
<p>And acetylcholine released from this area</p>
<p>in the back of the brain has the ability</p>
<p>to increase the extent to which say visual information</p>
<p>or just visual and auditory information</p>
<p>would make it through to our consciousness,</p>
<p>whereas all the other types of sensory information</p>
<p>that are coming in are filtered out.</p>
<p>So your brain, because it&rsquo;s taking in all this information,</p>
<p>needs to decide what to pay attention to.</p>
<p>And in this way, we can say that acetylcholine</p>
<p>has a lot to do not just with focus in air quotes,</p>
<p>but literally attention,</p>
<p>which neural signals become relevant to our consciousness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole discussion to be had there,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have time for that.</p>
<p>Rather, I&rsquo;d like to focus on what are the tools</p>
<p>that one can use to maintain healthy baselines</p>
<p>of acetylcholine and increase acetylcholine</p>
<p>for sake of learning any type of information,</p>
<p>physical, cognitive, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Now, it turns out there&rsquo;ve been a lot of studies,</p>
<p>including many quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>carried out in humans,</p>
<p>looking at what happens when you increase acetylcholine</p>
<p>levels in the brain,</p>
<p>and you accompany that with the attempt to learn.</p>
<p>And what you find almost always</p>
<p>is that people experience increased focus,</p>
<p>that when measured,</p>
<p>the neuronal responses become more specific,</p>
<p>so less broad-scale activity in the brain</p>
<p>and more specific neural circuit activity,</p>
<p>and that this triggers immediate and long-lasting changes</p>
<p>in the way those circuits work,</p>
<p>even when acetylcholine is not being deployed,</p>
<p>so-called neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>The circuits literally change.</p>
<p>So this is great.</p>
<p>The work of Michael Silver at Berkeley,</p>
<p>the work of Mike Merzenich at UCSF,</p>
<p>the work of Michael Kilgard down in Texas,</p>
<p>all of those laboratories see this again and again and again.</p>
<p>Increased acetylcholine before and during learning,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a much higher probability</p>
<p>that the learning will, quote-unquote, sink in,</p>
<p>that the information will be retained</p>
<p>because those neural circuits change.</p>
<p>Now, ways to increase acetylcholine in a potent way</p>
<p>include, again, nutrition and supplementation.</p>
<p>It is important to have baseline levels of acetylcholine</p>
<p>be sufficiently high as well,</p>
<p>and for that, really the ideal situation</p>
<p>is to regularly ingest foods</p>
<p>that provide enough of the precursors</p>
<p>for acetylcholine to be made.</p>
<p>If you go online and you were to do a search</p>
<p>of which foods contain a lot of choline,</p>
<p>which is related to the synthesis of acetylcholine,</p>
<p>you would get some interesting information back.</p>
<p>For instance, beef liver</p>
<p>is the most potent source of choline.</p>
<p>I know nowadays there&rsquo;s kind of a growing micro-trend,</p>
<p>if you will, of ingesting beef liver, even raw liver,</p>
<p>which, to be honest,</p>
<p>the thought of ingesting raw liver of any kind</p>
<p>activates my area of postrema,</p>
<p>which is the area of the brain that triggers nausea.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m starting to salivate a bit,</p>
<p>not because I&rsquo;m hungry,</p>
<p>but I think the whole concept makes me ill.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, cooked liver,</p>
<p>or raw liver for that matter,</p>
<p>or liver of any kind seems to contain a lot of choline.</p>
<p>I realize most people,</p>
<p>most people are not going to be running out</p>
<p>and ingesting large amounts of beef liver.</p>
<p>Eggs contain a lot of choline.</p>
<p>Beef contains choline.</p>
<p>Soybeans contain choline.</p>
<p>So there are vegan or non-meat sources.</p>
<p>Chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans,</p>
<p>these sorts of things contain a lot of choline.</p>
<p>And there are other vegetables that contain choline.</p>
<p>So depending on your dietary preferences and needs,</p>
<p>you can select certain foods to ingest</p>
<p>to get enough choline,</p>
<p>to synthesize enough baseline acetylcholine.</p>
<p>In the realm of supplementation,</p>
<p>there are some excellent tools</p>
<p>for increasing acetylcholine in the acute short-term,</p>
<p>meaning over the course of about 30 minutes</p>
<p>out to about two hours, or maybe even four hours.</p>
<p>And the number of different molecules that can do that,</p>
<p>that are available without a prescription,</p>
<p>at least in the US, is pretty vast.</p>
<p>The most common of those molecules is actually nicotine.</p>
<p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors</p>
<p>are abundant throughout the body and brain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in various brain circuits.</p>
<p>They are on muscle.</p>
<p>And yes, smoking nicotine, either by vaping or cigarette,</p>
<p>will activate those nicotinic receptors.</p>
<p>But of course, smoking is a terrible thing.</p>
<p>It will also activate things like lung cancer.</p>
<p>So I definitely don&rsquo;t recommend that.</p>
<p>It also activates addiction because of the ways</p>
<p>that it triggers activation of the dopamine circuit.</p>
<p>So I think that triggering activation</p>
<p>of acetylcholine-related pathways</p>
<p>by ingesting nicotine by way of inhalants</p>
<p>is generally a bad idea.</p>
<p>However, some people will chew Nicorette</p>
<p>or other nicotine-type gums.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done that,</p>
<p>but I have friends who actually rely on that.</p>
<p>These are typically former smokers</p>
<p>that are trying not to smoke,</p>
<p>but still want to get some of the focus enhancement</p>
<p>that they experience from nicotine.</p>
<p>Some people are very sensitive to nicotine,</p>
<p>and this is important.</p>
<p>Some people are very sensitive to ingested nicotine.</p>
<p>So nowadays there are nicotine-dipped toothpicks.</p>
<p>There, of course, is nicotine gum</p>
<p>and other sources of nicotine.</p>
<p>Some people can take that and feel fine.</p>
<p>Some people take it and feel absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>I confess I&rsquo;ve never actually tried nicotine</p>
<p>in any of those forms,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know how they work for me.</p>
<p>But some people do use them as cognitive enhancers.</p>
<p>In fact, I know one Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s quite well-known in our field</p>
<p>for chewing Nicorette all day long.</p>
<p>He insists that it really helps him with his focus,</p>
<p>and he is exceedingly smart and productive,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m sure there are other reasons for that.</p>
<p>Supplements that I have used and do use</p>
<p>for increasing acetylcholine</p>
<p>are things like alpha-GPC or huperzine.</p>
<p>Alpha-GPC is in the choline pathway</p>
<p>such that more acetylcholine is synthesized</p>
<p>after you ingest it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the general logic or framework of how it works.</p>
<p>Whereas huperzine is mainly in the enzymatic pathway.</p>
<p>It tends to adjust how much acetylcholine is broken down</p>
<p>and lead to net increases in acetylcholine.</p>
<p>I will often take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC</p>
<p>prior to workouts or prior to cognitive work bouts.</p>
<p>But when I say often,</p>
<p>I tend to do this anywhere from three to four times a week,</p>
<p>typically not every day.</p>
<p>Although there are people,</p>
<p>including people who are trying to offset</p>
<p>age-related cognitive decline,</p>
<p>that will take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC</p>
<p>three times a day every day,</p>
<p>which closely mimics some of the studies</p>
<p>that have been done on humans</p>
<p>looking at offsetting age-related cognitive decline</p>
<p>using things like alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>I should point out that there have been a few studies,</p>
<p>a few, not many,</p>
<p>but these studies emphasize that people</p>
<p>who take a lot of alpha-GPC chronically over time</p>
<p>may be at increased risk for stroke.</p>
<p>I think the data are still out on that</p>
<p>and we need more data.</p>
<p>But for me, in terms of thinking</p>
<p>about the risk-benefit profiles,</p>
<p>taking 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC</p>
<p>most certainly does increase my ability of focus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that.</p>
<p>I tend to take it alongside caffeine and phenylethylamine.</p>
<p>So I take that in combination</p>
<p>either before workouts or work bouts,</p>
<p>really sharpens my focus.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m doing that three, maybe four times per week.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m careful to do that in the early part of the day</p>
<p>so that it does not disrupt my sleep.</p>
<p>Although I have taken alpha-GPC</p>
<p>in the second half of the day</p>
<p>and I had no trouble sleeping at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the exact half-life is</p>
<p>of the given form that&rsquo;s typically in supplementation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually hard to get that information,</p>
<p>but typically the focus effects wear off</p>
<p>after about two, maybe four hours maximum.</p>
<p>Now, one thing that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>has ever been discussed before,</p>
<p>certainly not on this podcast,</p>
<p>is that if you take alpha-GPC even semi-regularly,</p>
<p>you may notice that a particular feature</p>
<p>of your blood work will increase.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s TMAO, which is sometimes associated</p>
<p>with increased cardiovascular risk.</p>
<p>This may, again, may relate to some of the potential risk</p>
<p>of very high levels of alpha-GPC ingestion over many years,</p>
<p>increasing stroke risk.</p>
<p>Again, those studies looked at people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been taking it for up to a decade.</p>
<p>But in any case, one way to prevent the increase in TMAO</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re taking alpha-GPC at all</p>
<p>is to take 600 milligrams of garlic</p>
<p>because it contains something called allicin.</p>
<p>This was a trick that was handed off to me</p>
<p>by Dr. Kyle Gillette,</p>
<p>who again was a guest on this podcast some time ago</p>
<p>talking about hormones and hormone health.</p>
<p>Turns out that ingestion of 600 milligrams of allicin</p>
<p>alongside or even just same day as alpha-GPC</p>
<p>can really clamp those TMAO levels</p>
<p>that would otherwise increase if you&rsquo;re taking alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>And indeed, I&rsquo;ve done the blood work</p>
<p>and that turns out to be the case.</p>
<p>I saw a spike in TMAO.</p>
<p>I started taking 600 milligrams of garlic</p>
<p>and those TMAO levels came down.</p>
<p>And last as it relates to acetylcholine,</p>
<p>but certainly not least,</p>
<p>just as acetylcholine can increase focus,</p>
<p>focus can increase acetylcholine.</p>
<p>I talked a lot about this in the episode on focus,</p>
<p>but there are behavioral tools that you can use</p>
<p>to enhance focus.</p>
<p>Things like staring at a particular visual target</p>
<p>at the same distance at which you&rsquo;re going to perform</p>
<p>some work and doing that for 30 to 60 seconds,</p>
<p>narrowing in a very deliberate way your visual field</p>
<p>and then moving into a focused work about.</p>
<p>That behavioral practice of narrowing your visual aperture</p>
<p>will increase the amount of acetylcholine transmission</p>
<p>in particular neural circuits</p>
<p>that will then make it easier to focus.</p>
<p>How do we know that?</p>
<p>Well, I covered in that episode</p>
<p>some of the peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that relate to protocols that are now actively</p>
<p>being deployed in schools in China and elsewhere,</p>
<p>where kids are doing deliberate visual focus exercises</p>
<p>in order to increase their mental focus.</p>
<p>And while they&rsquo;re not doing micro dialysis</p>
<p>or brain imaging on those kids in real time,</p>
<p>the cognitive effects and indeed the performance effects</p>
<p>in terms of academic ability and output</p>
<p>are pretty impressive.</p>
<p>So acetylcholine increases focus.</p>
<p>We talked about some dietary</p>
<p>and some supplementation based ways to improve acetylcholine</p>
<p>or I should say increase acetylcholine.</p>
<p>And that does in fact lead to increases</p>
<p>in one&rsquo;s ability to focus.</p>
<p>This is why a lot of the prescription drugs</p>
<p>for the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>age-related cognitive decline,</p>
<p>and indeed even some of the drugs</p>
<p>that tap into treatments for ADHD</p>
<p>also involve the acetylcholine system.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing surprising or heretical here,</p>
<p>but it is important to point out</p>
<p>that your behavioral ability to focus</p>
<p>is also related to your ability to access</p>
<p>and deploy acetylcholine.</p>
<p>So never do we want purely pharmacologic treatments</p>
<p>to be the only way that people are increasing</p>
<p>a given neuromodulator.</p>
<p>I always say behaviors first,</p>
<p>then nutrition, then supplementation.</p>
<p>And then if there&rsquo;s a need, certainly a clinical need,</p>
<p>then prescription drugs, et cetera,</p>
<p>of course administered through a physician.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s discuss serotonin.</p>
<p>Serotonin, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>is associated with brain and body states</p>
<p>of well-being, of comfort, of satiety,</p>
<p>and therefore it should come as no surprise</p>
<p>that a lot of the prescription drug treatments</p>
<p>for things like depression</p>
<p>involve increasing levels of serotonin</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>That said, anytime you talk about</p>
<p>prescription drugs for serotonin,</p>
<p>we also want to acknowledge</p>
<p>that there are often side effects</p>
<p>associated with increasing serotonin,</p>
<p>in particular if serotonin levels go too high.</p>
<p>That is, if the dosages of those treatments go too high,</p>
<p>people will, for instance, feel reduced appetite,</p>
<p>reduced libido, increased lethargy, et cetera,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a so-called serotonergic syndrome.</p>
<p>All of that can and should be considered</p>
<p>with a well-trained physician,</p>
<p>so because they&rsquo;re prescription drugs,</p>
<p>controlling the dosage, deciding what dosage to take,</p>
<p>deciding which SSRI to take,</p>
<p>and whether or not to come off those drugs,</p>
<p>how to come off those drugs.</p>
<p>Again, all of that should be handled</p>
<p>with a licensed physician.</p>
<p>That said, there are behavioral tools,</p>
<p>nutritional tools, and supplementation tools</p>
<p>that can tap into the serotonin system,</p>
<p>not to the same degree in potency,</p>
<p>but nonetheless in ways that can still impact</p>
<p>our feelings of well-being in positive ways.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s focus first on the behavioral tools,</p>
<p>and some of these might make people chuckle a little bit,</p>
<p>but I want to point out that a lot of these tools</p>
<p>are quite potent.</p>
<p>In fact, they are power tools for modulating serotonin,</p>
<p>and we know that based on human neuroimaging studies,</p>
<p>human and animal microdialysis studies,</p>
<p>and other studies that really have evaluated</p>
<p>circulating levels of serotonin</p>
<p>and the particular brain circuits that release serotonin</p>
<p>when people do certain things.</p>
<p>What sorts of things?</p>
<p>Well, for instance, physical contact,</p>
<p>in particular with loved ones.</p>
<p>This can be romantic love, this can be children,</p>
<p>so your own children, or your spouse,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not sexual contact,</p>
<p>friend-to-friend contact, even friend-to-animal contact.</p>
<p>You know, as a former dog owner,</p>
<p>I hope to have another dog soon,</p>
<p>because unfortunately Costello passed away,</p>
<p>but there is something really comforting and wonderful</p>
<p>about petting your dog, and certainly,</p>
<p>given that many of the studies on serotonin</p>
<p>and these other neuromodulators were done on animal models,</p>
<p>we also know that serotonin is being evoked in the dog,</p>
<p>and of course in the child,</p>
<p>and in the significant other, et cetera.</p>
<p>So things like holding hands, believe it or not,</p>
<p>hugs, cuddling, et cetera,</p>
<p>can increase serotonin transmission,</p>
<p>and they make people feel good.</p>
<p>This shouldn&rsquo;t really come as a surprise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also gratitude,</p>
<p>and we did an entire episode about gratitude.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of misunderstanding about gratitude.</p>
<p>Oftentimes when people hear gratitude,</p>
<p>they think, oh, gratitude,</p>
<p>this is just being thankful for what you have,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of a weak sauce effect,</p>
<p>meaning, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>maybe a little serotonin goes up,</p>
<p>or maybe there&rsquo;s a little bit of increased feelings</p>
<p>of well-being.</p>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>It turns out, first of all,</p>
<p>that receiving, not giving gratitude,</p>
<p>is what has the most potent effects on increasing serotonin</p>
<p>and activity of the brain circuits that involve serotonin</p>
<p>and that lead to increases in feelings of well-being.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Receiving much more than giving gratitude</p>
<p>is what activates those serotonergic pathways.</p>
<p>So the takeaway from that is both give</p>
<p>and receive gratitude,</p>
<p>and of course, do it in an authentic way.</p>
<p>The other thing about gratitude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s somewhat counterintuitive</p>
<p>is that observing others giving and receiving gratitude</p>
<p>is immensely powerful for evoking serotonin</p>
<p>and the activity of serotonergic circuits</p>
<p>in you, the observer.</p>
<p>So receiving and observing gratitude</p>
<p>turns out to be the most potent way</p>
<p>to increase serotonin in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And these, again, are dramatic effects</p>
<p>that are quite long lasting,</p>
<p>and not the sorts of effects</p>
<p>that are going to lead to side effects,</p>
<p>at least there&rsquo;s no reason to think they would.</p>
<p>Now, what about nutritional approaches</p>
<p>to increasing serotonin?</p>
<p>Well, just as we have tyrosine as an amino acid precursor</p>
<p>upstream of dopamine synthesis,</p>
<p>we have the amino acid tryptophan,</p>
<p>which is upstream of serotonin synthesis.</p>
<p>And one simply has to go online</p>
<p>and put in tryptophan-containing foods,</p>
<p>and you will discover that there are a lot of foods</p>
<p>that are enriched in tryptophan</p>
<p>that can lead to net increases</p>
<p>in the amount of serotonin available in the brain and body.</p>
<p>The most kind of famous or infamous of these</p>
<p>is white meat turkey, the so-called tryptophan effect,</p>
<p>where people get very sleepy after eating white meat turkey,</p>
<p>and it is indeed highly enriched in tryptophan.</p>
<p>Although typically the getting sleepy after eating turkey</p>
<p>is most often associated with the Thanksgiving meal,</p>
<p>and the Thanksgiving meal, at least in the US,</p>
<p>is often associated with people vastly overeating.</p>
<p>And so I do want to point out</p>
<p>that if you fill your gut with food,</p>
<p>no matter what that food is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a diversion of blood to your gut</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to make you feel sleepy</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a diversion of blood away from other tissues.</p>
<p>So if you eat a lot, you&rsquo;re going to get sleepy, period,</p>
<p>whether or not you eat turkey or some other substance.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are a number of foods</p>
<p>that contain a lot of tryptophan,</p>
<p>and that some people will leverage</p>
<p>in order to try and increase</p>
<p>the total amount of circulating serotonin available to them</p>
<p>in order to have a modest increase</p>
<p>in overall mood and wellbeing.</p>
<p>So what are some of these foods?</p>
<p>These are things like milk, in particular, whole milk.</p>
<p>So full fat milk.</p>
<p>I know a number of people choose not to drink milk</p>
<p>because their lactose intolerance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m raising my hand because I&rsquo;m one such person.</p>
<p>Although when I was a kid, I did enjoy milk.</p>
<p>Canned tuna, turkey, as we mentioned before,</p>
<p>high in tryptophan.</p>
<p>Oats, I am a consumer of oatmeal, so that resonates with me.</p>
<p>Cheese, and here I read,</p>
<p>although not as high in tryptophan</p>
<p>as meat and other dairy sources,</p>
<p>certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses</p>
<p>can be rich in tryptophan.</p>
<p>Certain nuts and seeds, certain breads.</p>
<p>Chocolate, I know a number of people</p>
<p>will be relieved to hear that.</p>
<p>I know chocolate lovers are always looking</p>
<p>for an excuse to eat chocolate.</p>
<p>I confess I&rsquo;ve never really liked chocolate,</p>
<p>except, dare I say, I like the smooth 100% chocolates.</p>
<p>I know many people gag when they hear 100%.</p>
<p>I actually really like them.</p>
<p>And some fruits can be highly enriched in tryptophan,</p>
<p>things like bananas and apples and things of that sort,</p>
<p>although not nearly to the degree of things</p>
<p>like turkey, canned tuna, and milk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are other excellent sources of tryptophan</p>
<p>from the diet, including vegan sources,</p>
<p>so please peruse the internet to try and find the sources</p>
<p>that are compatible with your nutritional program,</p>
<p>if indeed your goal is to increase tryptophan.</p>
<p>Now, there are supplements that can increase tryptophan</p>
<p>and can do so quite potently.</p>
<p>One of the ones that has received increasing attention</p>
<p>as of lately is Cysis Quadrangularis, complicated name,</p>
<p>when taken in dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams</p>
<p>can pretty dramatically increase serotonin levels.</p>
<p>In fact, anywhere from 30% to 39% increases</p>
<p>in circulating serotonin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big increase,</p>
<p>and I can provide a link to that study.</p>
<p>The study was focused not so much on serotonin,</p>
<p>but was focused mainly on treatment of obesity and appetite</p>
<p>and weight loss, and it should come as no surprise</p>
<p>that serotonin, if increased,</p>
<p>might lead to decreases in appetite.</p>
<p>A cautionary note, Cysis Quadrangularis</p>
<p>may need to be cycled.</p>
<p>How quickly to cycle it,</p>
<p>meaning do you do two weeks on, two weeks off,</p>
<p>whether or not you need to do more rapid cycling,</p>
<p>like two days on, two days off, is a matter of debate.</p>
<p>There are not a lot of data on this just yet.</p>
<p>There are a lot of opinions about this on the internet,</p>
<p>but again, not a lot of quality peer-reviewed data.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Cysis Quadrangularis has been shown</p>
<p>to potently increase serotonin in humans,</p>
<p>and for people that are seeking to increase serotonin,</p>
<p>maybe in particular for sake of appetite and weight control,</p>
<p>that might be a useful compound.</p>
<p>I know many people also take 5-HTP,</p>
<p>one of the precursors to serotonin,</p>
<p>in dosages of anywhere from 300 to 500 milligrams.</p>
<p>Typically, people are doing this in anticipation of sleep,</p>
<p>meaning in the final hour of wakefulness</p>
<p>before going to sleep.</p>
<p>I myself have tried 5-HTP prior to sleep,</p>
<p>and all I can tell you is that it led to very deep sleep</p>
<p>for about one to three hours,</p>
<p>and then I woke up and I could not fall back asleep.</p>
<p>I ran that experiment twice</p>
<p>before I decided to abandon 5-HTP as a sleep aid,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve never put it into our sleep kit,</p>
<p>or at least my sleep kit.</p>
<p>And when I refer to the sleep kit,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something you can find at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>This is a zero-cost resource</p>
<p>where you can see behavioral tools</p>
<p>and also supplementation tools</p>
<p>that can improve the transition time into</p>
<p>and the depth of sleep,</p>
<p>and none of those rely on 5-HTP supplementation.</p>
<p>That said, I know a number of people</p>
<p>use 5-HTP supplementation outside of sleep,</p>
<p>or I should say during the daytime,</p>
<p>to try and increase serotonin,</p>
<p>and it will indeed increase circulating serotonin.</p>
<p>But again, people vary in their sensitivity</p>
<p>to these sorts of things.</p>
<p>Some people might find, for instance,</p>
<p>that 300 milligrams of 5-HTP is just far too much.</p>
<p>It blunts their appetite, might even reduce libido.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t a lot of very well-controlled studies</p>
<p>looking at this,</p>
<p>and so it has to be figured out on an individual basis</p>
<p>if you decide to approach it at all.</p>
<p>Now, one molecule that I&rsquo;ve found</p>
<p>to be particularly interesting and useful,</p>
<p>and this is one that I haven&rsquo;t talked about</p>
<p>yet on this podcast,</p>
<p>is inositol, in particular, myoinositol.</p>
<p>Myoinositol can have the effect of increasing serotonin</p>
<p>and other neurochemicals,</p>
<p>but primarily, at least in terms of the neuromodulators</p>
<p>discussed today, serotonin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking 900 milligrams of myoinositol</p>
<p>every third night or so</p>
<p>as a test of its ability to improve sleep,</p>
<p>and I have to say, the depth and quality of sleep</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been obtaining on myoinositol</p>
<p>is pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve used it alone</p>
<p>and in combination with the Magnesium 3-Nate</p>
<p>Apigenin Theanine Sleep Kit that I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s included in that, again, zero-cost kit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s available as a PDF on our website.</p>
<p>So myoinositol is known to increase</p>
<p>circulating levels of serotonin.</p>
<p>It has been explored extensively in both animal models</p>
<p>and in humans for its daytime use for treating anxiety.</p>
<p>It does seem to reduce anxiety,</p>
<p>and for all sorts of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been explored for bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do an episode</p>
<p>about bipolar disorder coming up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been explored for the treatment of migraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been explored for ADHD.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been explored for a huge number</p>
<p>of different conditions of brain and body.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ve been using the 900 milligrams of myoinositol</p>
<p>in the 30 to 60 minutes before sleep to improve my sleep,</p>
<p>and it has been doing that very dramatically,</p>
<p>especially when I take it alongside</p>
<p>the rest of those sleep kit supplements.</p>
<p>A quick note about myoinositol</p>
<p>for sake of increasing serotonin.</p>
<p>If you look at the human studies on myoinositol</p>
<p>that are out there,</p>
<p>and in particular focus on the human studies,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find is that the dosages</p>
<p>that are often used are tremendously high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like five grams, eight grams,</p>
<p>18 grams of myoinositol taken throughout the day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how people stomach that,</p>
<p>and in fact, many people drop out of those studies</p>
<p>because of gastric discomfort,</p>
<p>and yet I also wonder how people tolerate it</p>
<p>because it has somewhat of a sedative effect in it,</p>
<p>this kind of anti-anxiety effect,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t even imagine,</p>
<p>given my experience with 900 milligrams,</p>
<p>what one would experience taking multiple</p>
<p>or many more grams per day,</p>
<p>so I certainly am not encouraging that,</p>
<p>and the only reason I mentioned myoinositol</p>
<p>is that it has a known effect of increasing serotonin.</p>
<p>At least in my experience,</p>
<p>it does not lead to this falling deeply asleep</p>
<p>and waking back up.</p>
<p>Actually, to the contrary,</p>
<p>if I wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>to use the bathroom</p>
<p>or I wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>for whatever other reason,</p>
<p>I find it far easier to fall back asleep</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ve taken 900 milligrams of inositol prior to sleep,</p>
<p>so for me, it&rsquo;s proving to be a quite useful compound.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of having any serotonergic deficiency overall.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself depressed,</p>
<p>and of course, I should mention that no supplement,</p>
<p>either added or withdrawn from your protocol,</p>
<p>should ever be used as a direct replacement</p>
<p>for prescription drug treatments</p>
<p>that your physician has given you.</p>
<p>You should always talk to your physician</p>
<p>anytime you remove or add something</p>
<p>to your drug protocol or prescription protocol, of course.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got behavioral protocols</p>
<p>that, as silly as it feels to say,</p>
<p>have been shown to potently increase serotonin,</p>
<p>things like physical contact, cuddling,</p>
<p>holding hands with people that you love, of course, right?</p>
<p>I think if they were people that you despised,</p>
<p>it would have the opposite effect for obvious reasons,</p>
<p>but also receiving gratitude and observing gratitude,</p>
<p>very potent increases in serotonin,</p>
<p>and things like Cysis Quadrangularis,</p>
<p>things like 5-HTP may have their uses, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very potent at increasing serotonin,</p>
<p>but they do seem to have the need to cycle them,</p>
<p>and they are nuanced.</p>
<p>Some people respond well to them,</p>
<p>others, like myself, don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and of course, always be on the lookout</p>
<p>for dramatic or even subtle decreases in appetite or libido</p>
<p>or things that you might not want</p>
<p>if you are going to be tinkering</p>
<p>with your serotonergic levels and pathways.</p>
<p>And then myo-inositol actually is proving</p>
<p>to be quite useful to me.</p>
<p>And whether or not that&rsquo;s because of its effects</p>
<p>on serotonin or through some of its other effects</p>
<p>on maybe reducing anxiety,</p>
<p>which certainly I experience</p>
<p>if I wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like waking up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>but on myo-inositol, I sort of seem to not really care</p>
<p>that I woke up and I fall right back asleep.</p>
<p>So the direct source of the positive effects</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m getting aren&rsquo;t clear,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, I thought I&rsquo;d pass it along</p>
<p>as a useful tool because it is out there</p>
<p>and it is available over the counter</p>
<p>and provided you&rsquo;re taking the appropriate safety steps</p>
<p>in considering whether or not to use it or not,</p>
<p>I think it might be a useful tool.</p>
<p>And of course,</p>
<p>as with all the other neuromodulators we discussed,</p>
<p>you have both a baseline of serotonin</p>
<p>and the ability to give or provide yourself peaks</p>
<p>of serotonin through these various protocols.</p>
<p>The dietary interventions of the sort that I mentioned,</p>
<p>meaning eating foods that are enriched in tryptophan,</p>
<p>those are mainly going to adjust</p>
<p>your baseline levels of tryptophan.</p>
<p>For instance, if you really want to be sleepy,</p>
<p>sure, you could eat some white meat turkey</p>
<p>in hopes that that tryptophan will convert to serotonin</p>
<p>and make you sleepy, et cetera.</p>
<p>But in general,</p>
<p>those are going to be pretty long lasting effects,</p>
<p>especially given the fact that not all of the tryptophan</p>
<p>you will ingest is going to be converted</p>
<p>into serotonin in your brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to have other effects on other tissues</p>
<p>and organs of your body.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if you want to increase serotonin,</p>
<p>providing the appropriate baseline context</p>
<p>is going to be useful.</p>
<p>And again, this is a general theme</p>
<p>of all four of these neuromodulators,</p>
<p>dopamine, epinephrine, acetylcholine, and serotonin.</p>
<p>You want to make sure that you have sufficient</p>
<p>baseline levels of those things</p>
<p>through things like diet, regular behaviors,</p>
<p>and then you have the opportunity to use supplementation.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s appropriate for you,</p>
<p>prescription drugs and certain behavioral protocols</p>
<p>to try and get these potent increases,</p>
<p>these acute increases in whichever the neuromodulators</p>
<p>you happen to want to leverage for your particular goals.</p>
<p>So that brings us to the end of at least this exploration</p>
<p>of the neuromodulators, dopamine, epinephrine,</p>
<p>acetylcholine, and serotonin.</p>
<p>Some of you who are regular listeners of this podcast</p>
<p>might be saying, well, we&rsquo;ve heard all this before, right?</p>
<p>You had an episode on dopamine,</p>
<p>you had an episode on anxiety,</p>
<p>you had an episode on sleep.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;ve tried to provide today is a framework</p>
<p>that cuts through all those episodes,</p>
<p>and at the same time builds out a new,</p>
<p>and what I believe to be a really important theme</p>
<p>and principle, which is that whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using nutritional tools, or supplementation,</p>
<p>or prescription drugs, or any other sort of protocol</p>
<p>to try and create a desired effect of focus,</p>
<p>or energy, motivation, relaxation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re playing with the same neurochemical ingredients.</p>
<p>Just as in the realm of nutrition,</p>
<p>you have macronutrients,</p>
<p>you have proteins, carbohydrates, and fats</p>
<p>that can be adjusted in different ratios</p>
<p>and arranged at different times</p>
<p>in order to achieve certain desired effects.</p>
<p>Well, when it comes to your neurochemistry</p>
<p>and your ability to perform mentally, to perform physically,</p>
<p>and your overall wellbeing,</p>
<p>you are dealing with a small handful</p>
<p>of especially potent molecules.</p>
<p>And I acknowledge that there are many neuromodulators,</p>
<p>there are indeed many neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>glutamine, glycine, GABA, et cetera,</p>
<p>but today we focused on the main four,</p>
<p>meaning the most potent and most widespread neuromodulators</p>
<p>in the brain and body that give you access</p>
<p>to particular brain states and body states</p>
<p>of the sort that most people desire.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m hoping is that rather than decide</p>
<p>that any one tool is the most useful,</p>
<p>or that any one neurochemical is most useful,</p>
<p>for that matter,</p>
<p>that the information that I&rsquo;ve provided today</p>
<p>allows you a kit of versatile tools</p>
<p>that allows you to figure out what levels of dopamine</p>
<p>and augmentation of dopamine</p>
<p>are appropriate and necessary for you,</p>
<p>what levels of acetylcholine</p>
<p>and tools for manipulating acetylcholine</p>
<p>are going to be most useful for you,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Because at least at this stage in time,</p>
<p>that is June 2022,</p>
<p>there is no simple at-home test.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no simple laboratory test</p>
<p>that allows us to know whether or not</p>
<p>our dopamine levels are high</p>
<p>and our serotonin levels are low.</p>
<p>We can look at somebody and their behavior,</p>
<p>we can look at ourselves and our own mood and behavior,</p>
<p>and we can infer what those levels may or may not be,</p>
<p>but unfortunately we don&rsquo;t have a really good test</p>
<p>of dopamine levels or serotonin levels</p>
<p>that would allow us to say,</p>
<p>okay, this person or I need to increase dopamine twofold</p>
<p>in order to achieve the kind of motivation that we want.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Rather, we are confronted with a situation</p>
<p>where we understand generally</p>
<p>what these different neuromodulators do,</p>
<p>the different mental states and physical states</p>
<p>that they tend to put us into, and we reviewed those,</p>
<p>and we know that there are really potent tools</p>
<p>to adjust those neuromodulators,</p>
<p>if not alone, but in certain combinations.</p>
<p>That is, ingestion of caffeine will tap into</p>
<p>and support dopamine and epinephrine.</p>
<p>Increasing dopamine and epinephrine</p>
<p>alongside increasing acetylcholine</p>
<p>will allow us to access certain brain states,</p>
<p>that is, focused, alert, energized brain states,</p>
<p>great for learning and plasticity of all kinds,</p>
<p>whereas augmenting serotonin</p>
<p>is going to put us into a more relaxed state</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like you to keep in mind</p>
<p>that there is no negotiating the fact</p>
<p>that we all have different phases of our 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>during which those very same neuromodulators</p>
<p>tend to be naturally higher or naturally lower,</p>
<p>and I reviewed that at the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>So my wish for you is that you will take this information,</p>
<p>experiment with it as you see fit for you and in a safe way,</p>
<p>and as you go forward to really try and gain intuition</p>
<p>and understanding as to not just how these protocols work,</p>
<p>but how any protocol that you might encounter,</p>
<p>supplement-based, drug-based, behavioral-based,</p>
<p>how those might tap</p>
<p>into these different major neuromodulator systems,</p>
<p>and from that, to be able to better predict and evaluate</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re going to be useful to you,</p>
<p>detrimental to you,</p>
<p>or whether or not they should be used in combinations</p>
<p>that would be more useful to you.</p>
