    <p>The following is a conversation with Tim Urban,</p>
<p>his second time in the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author and illustrator of the amazing blog</p>
<p>called Wait But Why, and is the author of a new book</p>
<p>coming out tomorrow called What&rsquo;s Our Problem?</p>
<p>A Self-Help Book for Societies.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about this book in this podcast,</p>
<p>but you really do need to get it</p>
<p>and experience it for yourself.</p>
<p>It is a fearless, insightful, hilarious,</p>
<p>and I think important book</p>
<p>in this divisive time that we live in.</p>
<p>The Kindle version, the audio book, and the web version</p>
<p>should be all available on date of publication.</p>
<p>I should also mention that my face</p>
<p>might be a bit more beat up than usual.</p>
<p>I got hit in the chin pretty good</p>
<p>since I&rsquo;ve been getting back into training jujitsu,</p>
<p>a sport I love very much, after recovering from an injury.</p>
<p>So if you see marks on my face</p>
<p>during these intros or conversations,</p>
<p>you know that my life is in a pretty good place.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got House of Macadamias for healthy snacks,</p>
<p>Indeed for hiring excellent teams,</p>
<p>and Athletic Greens for health.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to work with our amazing team,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always hiring.</p>
<p>Go to lexfriedman.com slash hiring.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting,</p>
<p>but if you must skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by a sponsor</p>
<p>that brings a smile to my face, House of Macadamias,</p>
<p>a company that ships delicious, high quality,</p>
<p>and healthy macadamia nuts directly to your door.</p>
<p>The snacks that these guys make are delicious,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re in a small portion.</p>
<p>I can share it with guests.</p>
<p>I can share it with friends when they come over,</p>
<p>and I feel like a normal adult.</p>
<p>I feel like an adult because an adult</p>
<p>can moderate their intake of snacks.</p>
<p>I need my snacks portioned perfectly,</p>
<p>because otherwise, if you have a giant jar</p>
<p>of macadamia nuts, they&rsquo;re too delicious.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too good.</p>
<p>The fact that they&rsquo;re segmented perfectly for you</p>
<p>is really nice, whether it&rsquo;s bars or whole nuts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a variety of deliciousness that brings joy to my life,</p>
<p>and I really love it.</p>
<p>Go to houseofmacadamias.com slash lex</p>
<p>to get 20% off your order for every order,</p>
<p>not just the first.</p>
<p>You, the listener, will also get four ounce bag</p>
<p>of macadamias when you order three or more boxes</p>
<p>of any macadamia product.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s houseofmacadamias.com slash lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by, indeed,</p>
<p>a hiring website.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, we&rsquo;re hiring,</p>
<p>and you should be using the best tools for the job</p>
<p>when you do that, because friends,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing more important</p>
<p>than the people you surround yourself with,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna go bro science for a second</p>
<p>and pull out a random statistic.</p>
<p>I remember reading an article yesterday</p>
<p>about the amount of time that an average American</p>
<p>spends in their workplace across different roles</p>
<p>and positions and industries and so on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what the number is,</p>
<p>but it was tremendous.</p>
<p>It was huge.</p>
<p>So those hours are really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important, not just for the productivity</p>
<p>and the success of a company,</p>
<p>but just for your happiness, for your fulfillment.</p>
<p>And so, to me, that&rsquo;s what hiring is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like building up a team of awesome people</p>
<p>that make each other better,</p>
<p>and you should use the best tools for the job.</p>
<p>I certainly use Indeed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Indeed knows when you&rsquo;re growing your own business,</p>
<p>every dollar counts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why with Indeed,</p>
<p>you only pay for quality applications</p>
<p>that match your job requirements.</p>
<p>Visit indeed.com slash Lex to start hiring now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s indeed.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>Terms and conditions apply.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and its AG1 drink, which is an all-in-one daily drink</p>
<p>to support better health and peak performance.</p>
<p>It replaced the multivitamin for me.</p>
<p>It replaced so much for me, and it gave me so much.</p>
<p>In fact, right after I&rsquo;m done saying the words</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying now, I&rsquo;m walking over to the fridge,</p>
<p>which is where I made an AG1 drink that&rsquo;s now cold.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to open the container,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna consume the deliciousness,</p>
<p>knowing that my nutritional basis is taken care of.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain things in life that if you take care of them</p>
<p>they give you the freedom to take on anything</p>
<p>in any way you want, just knowing that when I take care</p>
<p>of the quote-unquote adult stuff,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m free to be a child, basically,</p>
<p>which is to explore the world, to follow my curiosity,</p>
<p>to take big risks, to be fearless,</p>
<p>but also to be joyful, all of that.</p>
<p>And to me, it&rsquo;s kind of the nutrition side of that</p>
<p>is Athletic Greens helped me with that.</p>
<p>I also take electrolytes, that really helps,</p>
<p>and fish oil as well, but that&rsquo;s pretty much about it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I drink a lot of water, of course.</p>
<p>Anyway, they&rsquo;ll give you one month&rsquo;s supply of fish oil</p>
<p>when you sign up at athleticgreens.com slash Lex.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Tim Urban.</p>
<p>You wrote an incredible book called What&rsquo;s Our Problem?,</p>
<p>a self-help book for societies.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you present this view of human history</p>
<p>as a 1,000-page book where each page is 250 years.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a brilliant visualization</p>
<p>because almost nothing happens for most of it.</p>
<p>So what blows your mind most about that visualization</p>
<p>when you just sit back and think about it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a boring book.</p>
<p>So 950 pages, 95% of the book,</p>
<p>hunter-gatherers kind of doing their thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s obviously some major cognitive</p>
<p>and advancements along the way in language.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure the bow and arrow comes around at some point.</p>
<p>So tiny things, but it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, now we have 400 pages till the next thing.</p>
<p>But then you get to page 950 and things start moving.</p>
<p>Recorded history starts at 976.</p>
<p>So basically the bottom row</p>
<p>is when anything interesting happens.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of agriculture for a while</p>
<p>before we know anything about it.</p>
<p>And then recorded history starts.</p>
<p>Yeah, 25 pages of actual recorded history.</p>
<p>So when we think of prehistoric,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about pages one through 975 of the book.</p>
<p>And then history is page 976 to 1,000.</p>
<p>If you were reading the book, it would be like epilogue AD,</p>
<p>the last little 10 pages of the book.</p>
<p>And we think of AD as super long, right?</p>
<p>2,000 years, the Roman Empire, 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s so long.</p>
<p>Human history has been going on for over 2,000 centuries.</p>
<p>Like that is, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s hard to wrap your head around.</p>
<p>And this is, I mean, even that&rsquo;s just the end</p>
<p>of a very long road.</p>
<p>Like, you know, the 100,000 years before that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like that was that different.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s been people like us</p>
<p>that have emotions like us,</p>
<p>that have physical sensations like us for so, so long.</p>
<p>And who are they all?</p>
<p>And what was their life like?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I think we have no idea what it was like to be them.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s craziest about the people of the far past</p>
<p>is not just that they had different lives,</p>
<p>they had different fears,</p>
<p>they had different dangers and different responsibilities,</p>
<p>and they lived in tribes and everything,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>Like, we just take it for granted</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re born on top of this tower of knowledge.</p>
<p>And from the very beginning,</p>
<p>we know that the earth is a ball floating in space,</p>
<p>and we know that we&rsquo;re going to die one day.</p>
<p>And we know that, you know, we evolved from animals.</p>
<p>And all the, those were all like incredible,</p>
<p>you know, epiphanies quite recently.</p>
<p>And the people a long time ago,</p>
<p>they just had no idea what was going on.</p>
<p>And like, I&rsquo;m kind of jealous,</p>
<p>because I feel like it, I mean,</p>
<p>it might&rsquo;ve been scary to not know what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>but it also, I feel like would be,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have a sense of awe and wonder all the time,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>
<p>And once you learn, you&rsquo;re kind of like,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a little grim.</p>
<p>But they probably had the same capacity for consciousness</p>
<p>to experience the world, to wander about the world,</p>
<p>maybe to construct narratives about the world</p>
<p>and myths and so on.</p>
<p>They just had less grounded, systematic facts to play with.</p>
<p>They still probably felt the narratives,</p>
<p>the myths they constructed as intensely as we do.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>They also fell in love.</p>
<p>They also had friends,</p>
<p>and they had falling outs with friends.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t shower much, though.</p>
<p>No, they did not smell nice.</p>
<p>Maybe they did.</p>
<p>Maybe beauty&rsquo;s in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s all relative.</p>
<p>How many people in history have experienced a hot shower?</p>
<p>Like, almost none.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, when were hot showers invented?</p>
<p>100 years ago?</p>
<p>Like, less?</p>
<p>So, like George Washington never had a hot shower.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of weird.</p>
<p>Like, he took cold showers all the time, or like.</p>
<p>And again, we just take this for granted,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s like an unbelievable life experience,</p>
<p>to have a controlled little booth</p>
<p>where it rains hot water on your head.</p>
<p>And then you get out, and it&rsquo;s not everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like contained.</p>
<p>That was like, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of people probably lived and died</p>
<p>with never experiencing hot water.</p>
<p>Maybe they had a way to heat water over a fire.</p>
<p>But like, then it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, there&rsquo;s so many things about our lives now</p>
<p>that are just total anomaly.</p>
<p>It makes you wonder, like,</p>
<p>what is the thing they would notice the most?</p>
<p>I mean, the sewage system.</p>
<p>Like, it doesn&rsquo;t smell in cities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>What does the sewer system do?</p>
<p>I mean, it gets rid of waste efficiently,</p>
<p>such that we don&rsquo;t have to confront it,</p>
<p>both with any of our senses.</p>
<p>And that probably wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>I mean, what else?</p>
<p>Plus all the medical stuff associated with sewage.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, how about the disease?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How about the cockroaches and the rats</p>
<p>and the disease and the plagues?</p>
<p>And, you know, and then when they got,</p>
<p>so they caught more diseases,</p>
<p>but then when they caught the disease,</p>
<p>they also didn&rsquo;t have treatment for it.</p>
<p>So they often would die</p>
<p>or they would just be in a huge amount of pain.</p>
<p>They also didn&rsquo;t know what the disease was.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know about microbes.</p>
<p>That was this new thing,</p>
<p>the idea that these tiny little animals</p>
<p>that are causing these diseases.</p>
<p>So what did they think?</p>
<p>You know, in the bubonic plague,</p>
<p>you know, in the Black Death, the 1300s,</p>
<p>people thought that it was an act of God</p>
<p>because, you know, God&rsquo;s angry at us.</p>
<p>Because why would, you know,</p>
<p>why would you not think that</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t know what it was?</p>
<p>And so the crazy thing is that these were the same primates.</p>
<p>So I do know something about them.</p>
<p>I know in some sense what it&rsquo;s like to be them</p>
<p>because I am a human as well.</p>
<p>And to know that this particular primate</p>
<p>that I know what it&rsquo;s like to be</p>
<p>experienced such different things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, and like, this isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>our life is not the life that this primate</p>
<p>has experienced almost ever.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just a bit strange.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I have a sense that we would get acclimated very quickly.</p>
<p>Like if we threw ourselves back a few thousand years ago,</p>
<p>it would be very uncomfortable at first,</p>
<p>but the whole hot shower thing, you&rsquo;ll get used to it.</p>
<p>After a year, you would not even like miss it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few, I&rsquo;m trying to remember which book</p>
<p>that talks about hiking the Appalachian Trail,</p>
<p>but you kind of miss those hot showers.</p>
<p>But I have a sense like after a few months,</p>
<p>after a few years.</p>
<p>Well, your skill recalibrates.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was saying the other day to a friend</p>
<p>that whatever you&rsquo;re used to,</p>
<p>you start to think that,</p>
<p>oh, the people that have more than me</p>
<p>or are more fortunate, like, it just sounds incredible.</p>
<p>I would be so happy.</p>
<p>But you know, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Because the experience, what would happen is</p>
<p>you would get these new things</p>
<p>or you would get these new opportunities</p>
<p>and then you would get used to it.</p>
<p>And then you would, that&rsquo;s the hedonic treadmill.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d come back to where you are.</p>
<p>And likewise, though, because you think,</p>
<p>oh my God, what if I had to, you know,</p>
<p>have this kind of job that I never would want?</p>
<p>Or I had this kind of marriage that I never would want?</p>
<p>You know what, if you did, you would adjust</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d get used to it</p>
<p>and you might not be that much less happy than you are now.</p>
<p>So on the other side of the you being okay going back,</p>
<p>you know, we would survive if we had to go back.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;d have to learn some skills</p>
<p>but we would buck up.</p>
<p>And you know, people have gone to war before</p>
<p>that were in the, you know, shopkeepers a year before that.</p>
<p>They were in the trenches the next year.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, if you brought them here,</p>
<p>you know, I always think it would be so fun to just bring,</p>
<p>forget the hunter-gatherers, bring a 1700s person here</p>
<p>and tour them around, take them on an airplane</p>
<p>and show them your phone and all the things it can do.</p>
<p>Show them the internet, show them the grocery store.</p>
<p>Imagine taking them to a Whole Foods.</p>
<p>Likewise, I think they would be completely awestruck</p>
<p>and on their knees, crying tears of joy.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;d get used to it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d be complaining about,</p>
<p>like, you know, you don&rsquo;t have the oranges in stock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, and that&rsquo;s, you know.</p>
<p>The grocery store is a tough one to get used to.</p>
<p>Like when I first came to this country,</p>
<p>the abundance of bananas was the thing</p>
<p>that struck me the most.</p>
<p>So like fruits in general, but food in general,</p>
<p>but bananas somehow struck me the most.</p>
<p>That you could just eat them as much as you want.</p>
<p>That took a long time for me.</p>
<p>Probably took several years to really</p>
<p>like get acclimated to that.</p>
<p>Is that-</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you have bananas?</p>
<p>The number of bananas, fresh bananas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, that wasn&rsquo;t available.</p>
<p>Bread, yes.</p>
<p>Bananas, no.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like we don&rsquo;t even know what to,</p>
<p>like we don&rsquo;t even know the proper levels of gratitude.</p>
<p>You know, walking around the grocery store,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know to be like, the bread&rsquo;s nice,</p>
<p>but the bananas are like, we&rsquo;re so lucky.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, I could have been the other way.</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting then where we point our gratitude</p>
<p>in the West, in the United States.</p>
<p>Probably, do we point it away from materialist possessions</p>
<p>towards, or do we just aspire to do that</p>
<p>towards other human beings that we love?</p>
<p>Because in the East, in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>growing up poor, it&rsquo;s having food is the gratitude.</p>
<p>Having transportation is gratitude.</p>
<p>Having warmth and shelter is gratitude.</p>
<p>And now, but see within that,</p>
<p>the deep gratitude is for other human beings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the penguins huddling together</p>
<p>for warmth in the cold.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a person-by-person basis.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure, yes, of course, in the West,</p>
<p>we will, on average, feel gratitude towards different things</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s a different level of gratitude.</p>
<p>Maybe we feel less gratitude than countries that,</p>
<p>you know, obviously, I think the easiest,</p>
<p>the person that&rsquo;s most likely to feel gratitude</p>
<p>is going to be someone whose life happens to be one</p>
<p>where they just move up, up, up throughout their life.</p>
<p>A lot of people in the greatest generation,</p>
<p>you know, people who were born in the 20s or whatever,</p>
<p>and a lot of the boomers, too.</p>
<p>The story is the greatest generation grew up dirt poor</p>
<p>and they often ended up middle-class.</p>
<p>And the boomers, some of them started off middle-class</p>
<p>and many of them ended up quite wealthy.</p>
<p>And I feel like that life trajectory</p>
<p>is naturally going to foster gratitude, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re not gonna take for granted these things</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t have them.</p>
<p>You know, I didn&rsquo;t go out of the country, really,</p>
<p>in my childhood very much.</p>
<p>You know, like, you know, we traveled,</p>
<p>but it was to Virginia to see my grandparents</p>
<p>or Wisconsin to see other relatives,</p>
<p>or, you know, maybe Florida after going to the beach.</p>
<p>And then I started going out of the country</p>
<p>like crazy in my 20s,</p>
<p>because I really, you know, became my favorite thing.</p>
<p>And I feel like because I,</p>
<p>if I had grown up always doing that,</p>
<p>it would have been another thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, it&rsquo;s just something I do.</p>
<p>But I still, every time I go to a new country,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh my God, this is so cool.</p>
<p>And in another country,</p>
<p>this thing I&rsquo;ve only seen on the map,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m there now.</p>
<p>And so I feel like it&rsquo;s, a lot of times,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a product of what you didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>and then you suddenly had.</p>
<p>But I still think it&rsquo;s case by case</p>
<p>in that there&rsquo;s like a meter in everyone&rsquo;s head,</p>
<p>you know, that I think at a 10,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re experiencing just immense gratitude, right?</p>
<p>Which is a euphoric feeling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great feeling.</p>
<p>And it makes you happy to savor what you have,</p>
<p>to look down at the mountain of stuff that you have</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re standing on, right?</p>
<p>To look down at it and say, oh my God, I&rsquo;m so lucky.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so grateful for this and this and this.</p>
<p>And obviously that&rsquo;s a happy exercise.</p>
<p>Now, when you move that meter down to six or seven,</p>
<p>maybe you think that sometimes,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not always thinking that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re sometimes looking up</p>
<p>at this cloud of things that you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>and the things that they have, but you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>or the things you wished you had,</p>
<p>or you thought you were gonna have or whatever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the opposite direction to look, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the, either that&rsquo;s envy, that&rsquo;s yearning,</p>
<p>or often it&rsquo;s, if you think about your past,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s grievance, right?</p>
<p>And so then you go into a one</p>
<p>and you have someone who feels like a complete victim.</p>
<p>They are just a victim of the society,</p>
<p>of their siblings and their parents and their loved one.</p>
<p>And they are, they&rsquo;re wallowing in everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happened wrong to me.</p>
<p>Everything I should have that I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>everything that has gone wrong for me.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a very unhealthy,</p>
<p>mentally unhealthy place to be.</p>
<p>Anyone can go there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an endless list of stuff it can be aggrieved about</p>
<p>and an endless list of stuff you can have gratitude for.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, in some ways it&rsquo;s a choice and it&rsquo;s a habit.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s part of how we were raised</p>
<p>or our natural demeanor, but it&rsquo;s such a good,</p>
<p>you are really good at this, by the way.</p>
<p>Your Twitter is like-</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>Well, like you&rsquo;re, you are constantly just saying,</p>
<p>man, I&rsquo;m lucky, or like, I&rsquo;m so grateful for this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a good thing to do</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re reminding yourself,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also reminding other people to think that way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, we are lucky, you know?</p>
<p>And so anyway, I think that scale can go from one to 10.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s hard to be a 10.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d be very happy if you could be,</p>
<p>but I think trying to be above a five</p>
<p>and looking down at the things you have more often</p>
<p>than you are looking up at the things you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>or being resentful about the things</p>
<p>that people have wronged you.</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing, I think,</p>
<p>was an open question, but I suspect</p>
<p>that you can control that knob for the individual.</p>
<p>Like, you yourself can choose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Stoic philosophy.</p>
<p>You could choose where you are as a matter of habit,</p>
<p>like you said, but you can also probably control that</p>
<p>on a scale of a family, of a tribe,</p>
<p>of a nation, of a society.</p>
<p>I mean, you can describe a lot of the things</p>
<p>that happened in Nazi Germany and different other parts</p>
<p>of history through a sort of societal envy</p>
<p>and resentment that builds up.</p>
<p>Maybe certain narratives pick up</p>
<p>and then they infiltrate your mind</p>
<p>and then now your knob goes to,</p>
<p>from the gratitude for everything,</p>
<p>it goes to resentment and envy and all the rest of it.</p>
<p>Germany between the two World Wars,</p>
<p>you know, like you said, the Soviet kind of mentality.</p>
<p>So yeah, and then when you&rsquo;re soaking in a culture,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s kind of two factors, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on in your own head</p>
<p>and then what&rsquo;s surrounding you.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s surrounding you kind of has concentric circles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s your immediate group of people</p>
<p>because that group of people, if they&rsquo;re a certain way,</p>
<p>if they feel a lot of gratitude</p>
<p>and they talk about it a lot,</p>
<p>that kind of insulates you from the broader culture</p>
<p>because, you know, people are gonna have the most impact</p>
<p>on you or the ones closest.</p>
<p>But often, all the concentric circles</p>
<p>are saying the same thing.</p>
<p>The people around you are feeling the same way</p>
<p>that the broader community,</p>
<p>which is feeling the same way as the broader country.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think this is why</p>
<p>I think American patriotism, you know, nationalism,</p>
<p>you know, can be tribal, can be very, not a good thing.</p>
<p>Patriotism, I think, is a great thing</p>
<p>because really, what is patriotism?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s if you love your country,</p>
<p>you should love your fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a Reagan quote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like patriotism is like,</p>
<p>I think a feeling of like unity,</p>
<p>and, but it also comes along</p>
<p>with an implicit kind of concept of gratitude</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, we are so lucky to live in,</p>
<p>you know, people think it&rsquo;s chauvinist to say</p>
<p>we live in the best country in the world, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, yes, when Americans say that,</p>
<p>no one likes it, right?</p>
<p>But actually, it&rsquo;s not a bad thing to think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice thing to think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of saying, I&rsquo;m so grateful</p>
<p>for all the great things this country gives to me</p>
<p>and this country has done.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, if you heard a Filipino person say,</p>
<p>you know what?</p>
<p>The Philippines is the best country in the world.</p>
<p>No one in America would say that&rsquo;s chauvinist.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d say, awesome, right?</p>
<p>Because when it&rsquo;s coming from someone, you know,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not American, it sounds totally fine.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, national pride is actually good.</p>
<p>Now, again, that can quickly translate</p>
<p>into xenophobia and nationalism.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you have to make sure</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t go off that cliff, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s good ways to formulate that.</p>
<p>Like you talk about, we&rsquo;ll talk about like</p>
<p>high rung progressivism, high rung conservatism.</p>
<p>Those are two different ways of embodying patriotism.</p>
<p>So you could talk about maybe loving the tradition</p>
<p>that this country stands for,</p>
<p>or you could talk about loving the people</p>
<p>that ultimately push progress.</p>
<p>And those are, from an intellectual perspective,</p>
<p>a good way to represent patriotism.</p>
<p>We gotta zoom out, because this graphic is epic.</p>
<p>A lot of images in your book are just epic on their own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brilliantly done.</p>
<p>But this one has famous people for each of the cards.</p>
<p>Like the best of.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And by the way, good for them to be the person that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that I could have chosen</p>
<p>lots of people for each card,</p>
<p>but I think most people would agree,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s a pretty fair choice for each page.</p>
<p>And good for them to be, you know,</p>
<p>you crushed it if you can be the person</p>
<p>for your whole 250 year page, so.</p>
<p>Well, I noticed you put Gandhi, you didn&rsquo;t put Hitler.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of people gonna argue with you</p>
<p>about that particular last page.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right, I could have put,</p>
<p>I actually, I was thinking about Darwin there, too.</p>
<p>Darwin, yeah, Einstein.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You really could have put anyone.</p>
<p>Did you think about putting yourself for a second?</p>
<p>Yeah, I should have, I should have.</p>
<p>That would have been awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that would have endeared the readers to me</p>
<p>from right from the beginning of the first page of the book.</p>
<p>A little bit of a messianic complex going on.</p>
<p>But yeah, so the list of people, just so you know,</p>
<p>so these are 250 year chunks.</p>
<p>The last one being from 1770 to 2020.</p>
<p>And so it goes Gandhi, Shakespeare, Joan of Arc,</p>
<p>Genghis Khan, Charlemagne, Muhammad, Constantine,</p>
<p>Jesus, Cleopatra, Aristotle, Buddha.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting to think about</p>
<p>this very recent human history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 11 pages, so it would be 2750, almost 3,000 years.</p>
<p>Just that there&rsquo;s these figures that stand out</p>
<p>and that define the course of human history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the craziest thing to me</p>
<p>is that Buddha was a dude.</p>
<p>He was a guy with arms and legs and fingernails</p>
<p>that he maybe bit and he liked certain foods</p>
<p>and maybe he got, he had digestive issues sometimes</p>
<p>and he got cuts and they stung.</p>
<p>And he was a guy and he had hopes and dreams</p>
<p>and he probably had a big ego for a while</p>
<p>before I guess Buddha totally overcame that one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like who knows, the mythical figure of Buddha,</p>
<p>who knows how similar he was.</p>
<p>But the fact, same with Jesus, this was a guy.</p>
<p>To me, he&rsquo;s a primate.</p>
<p>What an impact.</p>
<p>He was a cell first and then a baby.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was a fetus at some point.</p>
<p>He was a dumb baby trying to learn how to walk.</p>
<p>Yeah, like having a tantrum because he&rsquo;s frustrated</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s in the terrible twos.</p>
<p>Jesus was in the terrible twos.</p>
<p>Buddha never had a tantrum, let&rsquo;s be honest, the myth.</p>
<p>The mother was like, this baby&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Like wow, wow.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure something out.</p>
<p>It just, I mean, listen, hearing about Genghis Khan,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible to me because it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>this was some Mongolian herder guy</p>
<p>who was taken as a slave and he was like dirt poor,</p>
<p>catching rats as a young teen to feed him and his mom</p>
<p>and I think his brother.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like the odds on, when he was born,</p>
<p>he was just one of probably tens of thousands</p>
<p>of random teen boys living in Mongolia in the 1200s.</p>
<p>The odds of that person, any one of them being</p>
<p>a household name today that we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just crazy like what had to happen.</p>
<p>And for that guy, for that poor, dirt poor herder</p>
<p>to take over the world, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So history just like continually blows my mind.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the reason you and I are related probably.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I mean, also that&rsquo;s the other thing</p>
<p>is that some of these dudes, by becoming king,</p>
<p>by having a better army at the right time,</p>
<p>William the Conqueror or whatever is in the right place</p>
<p>at the right time with the right army</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a weakness at the right moment</p>
<p>and he comes over and he exploits it</p>
<p>and ends up probably having, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a thousand children and those children are high up people</p>
<p>who might be have a ton of,</p>
<p>the species is different now because of him.</p>
<p>Like forget England&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>or European borders look different,</p>
<p>like we look different because of a small handful of people.</p>
<p>When sometimes I think, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh, this part of the world, I can recognize.</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s Greek, someone&rsquo;s Persian, someone&rsquo;s wherever</p>
<p>because they kind of have certain facial features.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, it may have happened.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously that&rsquo;s a population,</p>
<p>but it may be that like someone 600 years ago</p>
<p>that looked like that really spread their seed</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why the ethnicity looks kind of like that now.</p>
<p>Sorry, anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think individuals like that</p>
<p>can turn the direction of history</p>
<p>or is that an illusion that narrative would tell ourselves?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>I mean, so I said that William the Conqueror, right?</p>
<p>Or Hitler, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that Hitler was born</p>
<p>destined to be great at all, right?</p>
<p>I think in a lot of cases,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s some frustrated artist with a temper</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s turning over the table in his studio</p>
<p>and hitting his wife and being kind of a dick</p>
<p>and a total nobody, right?</p>
<p>I think almost all the times</p>
<p>you could have put Hitler baby on earth.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a rando, right?</p>
<p>And maybe sometimes he becomes some kind of,</p>
<p>he uses the speaking ability</p>
<p>because that ability was gonna be there either way,</p>
<p>but maybe he uses it for something else.</p>
<p>But that said, I also don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not that World War II</p>
<p>was gonna happen either way, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that these circumstances were one way</p>
<p>and this person came along at the right time</p>
<p>and those two made a match made in, in this case, hell.</p>
<p>But it makes you wonder, yes, it&rsquo;s a match in hell,</p>
<p>but are there other people that could have taken his place</p>
<p>or do these people that stand out,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the rare spark of that genius</p>
<p>whether it take us towards evil, towards good,</p>
<p>whether those figures singularly define</p>
<p>the trajectory of humanity?</p>
<p>What defines the trajectory of humanity</p>
<p>in the 21st century, for example?</p>
<p>Might be the influence of AI,</p>
<p>might be the influence of nuclear war,</p>
<p>negative or positive, not in the case of nuclear war,</p>
<p>but the bioengineering, nanotech, virology,</p>
<p>what else is there?</p>
<p>Maybe the structure of governments and so on.</p>
<p>Maybe the structure of universities.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There could be singular figures that stand up</p>
<p>and lead the way for human.</p>
<p>There will be.</p>
<p>But I wonder if the society is the thing</p>
<p>that manifests that person</p>
<p>or that person really does have a huge impact.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably a spectrum</p>
<p>where there are some cases when a circumstance was such</p>
<p>that something like what happened was gonna happen.</p>
<p>If you pluck that person from the earth,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether the Mongols is a good example or not,</p>
<p>but maybe it could be that if you plucked Genghis Khan</p>
<p>as a baby, there was because of the specific way</p>
<p>Chinese civilization was at that time</p>
<p>and the specific climate that was causing</p>
<p>a certain kind of pressure on the Mongols</p>
<p>and the way they still had their great archers</p>
<p>and they had their horses</p>
<p>and they had a lot of the same advantages.</p>
<p>So maybe it was waiting to happen.</p>
<p>It was gonna happen either way</p>
<p>and it may not have happened to the extent or whatever.</p>
<p>So maybe, or you could go the full other direction</p>
<p>and say, actually, this was probably not gonna happen.</p>
<p>And I think World War II is an example.</p>
<p>I kind of think World War II really was kind of the work of,</p>
<p>of course, it relied on all these other circumstances.</p>
<p>You had to have the resentment in Germany.</p>
<p>You have to have the Great Depression.</p>
<p>But I think if you take Hitler out,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure World War II doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Well, then it seems like easier to answer these questions</p>
<p>when you look at history, even recent history,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s look at now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll talk about social media.</p>
<p>So who are the key players in social media?</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, what&rsquo;s the name of the MySpace guy, Tom?</p>
<p>Tom, it&rsquo;s just Tom, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a meme going around</p>
<p>where MySpace is like the perfect social media</p>
<p>because no algorithmic involvement.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s happy and positive.</p>
<p>Also, Tom did it right.</p>
<p>At the time we were like, oh man,</p>
<p>Tom only made like a few million dollars.</p>
<p>Ooh, he sucks to not be Zuck.</p>
<p>Tom might be living a nice life right now</p>
<p>where he doesn&rsquo;t have this nightmare</p>
<p>that these other people have.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he&rsquo;s always smiling in his profile picture.</p>
<p>He looks good.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s like Larry Page.</p>
<p>So with Google, that&rsquo;s kind of intermingled</p>
<p>into that whole thing,</p>
<p>into the development of the internet.</p>
<p>Jack Dorsey, now Elon, who else?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s people playing</p>
<p>with the evolution of social media.</p>
<p>And to me, that seems to be connected</p>
<p>to the development of AI.</p>
<p>And it seems like those singular figures</p>
<p>will define the direction of AI development</p>
<p>and social media development</p>
<p>with social media seeming to have such a huge impact</p>
<p>on our collective intelligence.</p>
<p>It does feel in one way like individuals</p>
<p>have an especially big impact right now</p>
<p>in that a small number of people</p>
<p>are pulling some big levers.</p>
<p>And there can be a little meeting</p>
<p>of three people at Facebook.</p>
<p>And they come out of that meeting</p>
<p>and make a decision that totally changes the world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you see a lot of conformity.</p>
<p>You see a lot of,</p>
<p>they all pulled the plug on Trump the same day.</p>
<p>So that suggests that there&rsquo;s some bigger force</p>
<p>that is also kind of driving them,</p>
<p>in which case it&rsquo;s less about the individuals.</p>
<p>I think this is, what is leadership?</p>
<p>I mean, to me, leadership is the ability</p>
<p>to move things in a direction</p>
<p>that the cultural forces are not already taking things.</p>
<p>A lot of times people seem like a leader</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re just kind of hopping on the cultural wave</p>
<p>and they happen to be the person who gets to the top of it.</p>
<p>Now it seems like they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>but actually the wave was already going.</p>
<p>Real leadership is when someone actually changes the wave,</p>
<p>changes the shape of the wave.</p>
<p>I think Elon with SpaceX and with Tesla,</p>
<p>genuinely shaped a wave.</p>
<p>Maybe you could say that EVs were actually,</p>
<p>they were gonna happen anyway,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not much evidence</p>
<p>about at least happening when it did.</p>
<p>If we end up on Mars,</p>
<p>you can say that Elon was a genuine leader there.</p>
<p>And so there are examples.</p>
<p>Now, Zuckerberg definitely has done a lot of leadership</p>
<p>along the way.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also potentially kind of caught in a storm</p>
<p>that is happening and he&rsquo;s one of the figures in it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible that he is a big shaper</p>
<p>if the metaverse becomes a reality.</p>
<p>If in 30 years, we&rsquo;re all living in a virtual world.</p>
<p>To many people, it seems ridiculous now</p>
<p>that that was a poor investment.</p>
<p>Well, he talked about getting,</p>
<p>you know, I think it was something like a billion people</p>
<p>with a VR headset in their pocket</p>
<p>and by, you know, I think it was 10 years from now</p>
<p>back in 2015, so we&rsquo;re behind that.</p>
<p>But he was talking about that.</p>
<p>And honestly, this is something I&rsquo;ve been wrong about</p>
<p>because I went to like one of the Facebook conferences</p>
<p>and tried out all the new Oculus stuff.</p>
<p>And I was like, you know, pretty early</p>
<p>talking to some of the major players there</p>
<p>because I was gonna write a big post about it</p>
<p>that then got swallowed by this book.</p>
<p>But I would have been wrong in the post</p>
<p>because what I would have said was that this thing is,</p>
<p>when I tried it, I was like, this is, you know,</p>
<p>some of them suck, some of them make you nauseous</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just not that, you know,</p>
<p>the headsets were big and, you know,</p>
<p>but I was like, the times when this is good,</p>
<p>I have this feeling, it reminds me of the feeling I had</p>
<p>when I first was five and I went to a friend&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and he had Nintendo and he gave me the controller</p>
<p>and I was looking at the screen and I pressed a button</p>
<p>and Mario jumped.</p>
<p>And I said, I can make something on the screen move.</p>
<p>And the same feeling I had the first time</p>
<p>someone showed me how to send an email,</p>
<p>it was like really early and he&rsquo;s like, you can send this.</p>
<p>And I was like, it goes, I can press enter on my computer</p>
<p>and something happens on your computer.</p>
<p>Those were obviously, you know, when you have that feeling,</p>
<p>it often means you&rsquo;re witnessing a paradigm shift.</p>
<p>And I thought, this is one of those things.</p>
<p>And I still kind of think it is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of weird that it hasn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>like where&rsquo;s the VR revolution, like?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m surprised, because I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>My first and still instinct is,</p>
<p>this feels like it changes everything.</p>
<p>VR feels like it changes everything,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not changing anything.</p>
<p>Like a dumb part of my brain is genuinely convinced</p>
<p>that this is real.</p>
<p>And then the smart part knows it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why the dumb part was like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not walking off that cliff.</p>
<p>The smart part&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re on your rug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>The dumb part of my brain is like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not walking off the cliff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s waiting for like that revolutionary person</p>
<p>who comes in and says, I&rsquo;m gonna create a headset.</p>
<p>Like honestly-</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s Steve Jobs&rsquo; iPhone of-</p>
<p>Honestly, a little bit of a Carmack type guy,</p>
<p>which is why it was really interesting</p>
<p>for him to be involved with Facebook.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically, how do we create a simple dumb thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a hundred bucks, but actually creates that experience.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s going to be some viral killer app on it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to be the gateway into a thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna change everything.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what exactly was the thing</p>
<p>that changed everything with a personal computer.</p>
<p>Is that understood?</p>
<p>Why that, maybe graphics?</p>
<p>What was the use case?</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t the 84 Macintosh a moment when it was like,</p>
<p>this is actually something that normal people</p>
<p>can and want to use?</p>
<p>Because it was less than $5,000, I think.</p>
<p>And I just think it had some like</p>
<p>Steve Jobs user-friendliness already to it</p>
<p>that other ones hadn&rsquo;t had.</p>
<p>I think Windows 95 was a really big deal.</p>
<p>I remember like,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m old enough to remember the MS-DOS</p>
<p>when I was like, kind of remember the command.</p>
<p>And then suddenly this concept of like a window</p>
<p>you drag something into, or you double click an icon,</p>
<p>which now seems like so obvious to us,</p>
<p>was like revolutionary because it made it intuitive.</p>
<p>So, you know, I don&rsquo;t know, yeah.</p>
<p>Windows 95 was good.</p>
<p>It was crazy, yeah.</p>
<p>I forget what the big leaps was,</p>
<p>because that was Windows 2000, it sucked.</p>
<p>And then Windows XP was good.</p>
<p>I moved to Mac around 2004, so I stopped.</p>
<p>You sold your soul to the devil?</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Well, us, the people, still use Windows and Android.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>The device in the operating system of the people.</p>
<p>Not you elitist folk with your books</p>
<p>and your, what else?</p>
<p>And success.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, you write, more technology means better good times,</p>
<p>but it also means badder bad times.</p>
<p>And the scary thing is, if the good and bad</p>
<p>keep exponentially growing, it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>how great the good times become.</p>
<p>If the bad gets to a certain level of bad,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all over for us.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate on this?</p>
<p>Why is there, why does the bad have that property?</p>
<p>That if it&rsquo;s all exponentially getting more powerful,</p>
<p>then the bad is gonna win in the end?</p>
<p>Am I misinterpreting that?</p>
<p>No, so the first thing is, I noticed a trend,</p>
<p>which was like, the centuries,</p>
<p>the good is getting better every century.</p>
<p>Like, the 20th century was the best century yet</p>
<p>in terms of prosperity, in terms of GDP per capita,</p>
<p>in terms of life expectancy, in terms of poverty</p>
<p>and disease, every metric that matters.</p>
<p>The 20th century was incredible.</p>
<p>It also had the biggest wars in history,</p>
<p>the biggest genocide in history,</p>
<p>the biggest existential threat yet with nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The Depression was probably as big an economic.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this interesting thing,</p>
<p>where the stakes are getting higher in both directions.</p>
<p>And so the question is, if you get enough good,</p>
<p>does that protect you against the bad, right?</p>
<p>The dream, and I do think this is possible too,</p>
<p>is the good gets so good.</p>
<p>You know, have you ever read the culture series</p>
<p>that Ian Banks books?</p>
<p>Not yet, but I get criticized on a daily basis</p>
<p>by some of the mutual folks we know</p>
<p>for not having done so.</p>
<p>And I feel like a lesser man for it.</p>
<p>Yes, I need to change that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I got onto it.</p>
<p>And I read six of the 10 books, and they&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>But the thing I love about them is like,</p>
<p>it just paints one of these futuristic societies</p>
<p>where the good has gotten so good</p>
<p>that the bad is no longer even an issue.</p>
<p>Like, basically, and the way that this works</p>
<p>is the AI, you know, the AIs are benevolent</p>
<p>and they control everything.</p>
<p>And so like, there&rsquo;s one random anecdote</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re like, you know, what happens</p>
<p>if you murder someone in,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re still, you know, there&rsquo;s still people</p>
<p>with rage and jealousy or whatever.</p>
<p>So if someone murders someone,</p>
<p>first of all, that person&rsquo;s backed up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like they have to get a new body</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s annoying, but it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not death.</p>
<p>And secondly, that person, what are they gonna do?</p>
<p>Put them in jail?</p>
<p>No, no, no, they&rsquo;re just gonna send a slap drone around,</p>
<p>which is this little like tiny, you know, random drone</p>
<p>that just will float around next to them forever.</p>
<p>And by the way, kind of be their servant.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s kind of fun to have a slap drone,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just making sure that they never do anything.</p>
<p>I was like, oh man, it could just be,</p>
<p>everyone could be so safe and everything could be so,</p>
<p>like, you know, you want a house,</p>
<p>you know, the AIs will build you a house.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s endless space, there&rsquo;s endless resources.</p>
<p>So I do think that that could be part of our future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of what excites me is like there is,</p>
<p>like today would seem like a utopia to Thomas Jefferson,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s world would seem like a utopia</p>
<p>to a caveman.</p>
<p>There is a future, and by the way,</p>
<p>these are happening faster, these jumps, right?</p>
<p>So the thing that would seem like a utopia to us,</p>
<p>we could experience in our own lifetimes, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, especially if, you know,</p>
<p>life extension combines with exponential progress.</p>
<p>I want to get there.</p>
<p>And I think in that part of what makes it utopia</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t have to be as scared of the worst bad guy</p>
<p>in the world trying to do the worst damage</p>
<p>because we have protection.</p>
<p>But that said, I&rsquo;m not sure how that happens.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s either easier said than done.</p>
<p>Nick Bostrom uses the example of,</p>
<p>if nuclear weapons could be manufactured</p>
<p>by microwaving sand, for example,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d probably be in the Stone Age right now</p>
<p>because .001% of people would love to destroy</p>
<p>all of humanity, right?</p>
<p>Some 16-year-old with huge mental health problems</p>
<p>who right now goes and shoots up a school</p>
<p>would say, oh, even better, I&rsquo;m going to blow up a city.</p>
<p>And now suddenly there&rsquo;s copycats, right?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s like, as our technology grows,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be easier for the worst bad guys</p>
<p>to do tremendous damage.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easier to destroy than to build.</p>
<p>So it takes a tiny, tiny number of these people</p>
<p>with enough power to do bad.</p>
<p>So that, to me, I&rsquo;m like, the stakes are going up</p>
<p>because what we have to lose is this incredible utopia.</p>
<p>But also, like, dystopia is real, it happens.</p>
<p>The Romans ended up in a dystopia</p>
<p>they probably earlier thought that was never possible.</p>
<p>Like, we should not get cocky.</p>
<p>And so, to me, that trend is,</p>
<p>the exponential tech is a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so exciting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to be alive now overall</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m an optimist and I find it exciting,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really scary.</p>
<p>And the dumbest thing we can do is not be scared.</p>
<p>Dumbest thing we can do is get cocky and think,</p>
<p>well, my life is always, the last couple generations,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s been fine.</p>
<p>Stop that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your gut?</p>
<p>What percentage of trajectories take us towards the,</p>
<p>as you put, unimaginably good future</p>
<p>versus unimaginably bad future?</p>
<p>As an optimist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to know.</p>
<p>I mean, all I, you know,</p>
<p>one of the things we can do is look at history.</p>
<p>And on one hand, there&rsquo;s a lot of stories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually listening to a great podcast right now</p>
<p>called The Fall of Civilizations.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s literally, every episode is like, you know,</p>
<p>a little, like, two-hour deep dive into some civilizations.</p>
<p>Some are really famous, like the Roman Empire,</p>
<p>some are more obscure, like the Norse and Greenland.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, each one is so interesting.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of civilizations that had their peak.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always the peak, right, when they&rsquo;re thriving,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re at their max size,</p>
<p>and they have their waterways,</p>
<p>and they have their, it&rsquo;s civilized,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s representative, and it&rsquo;s fair,</p>
<p>and whatever, not always, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the peak is the great, you know,</p>
<p>if I could go back in time, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that, you know, the farther you go back,</p>
<p>the worse it gets.</p>
<p>No, no, no, you want to go back to a civilization</p>
<p>during, I would go to the Roman Empire in the year 100.</p>
<p>It sounds great, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to go to the Roman Empire in the year 400.</p>
<p>We might be in the peak right now, here,</p>
<p>whatever this empire is.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, honestly, I think about, like, the 80s,</p>
<p>you know, the 70s, the 80s, the 90s.</p>
<p>Oh, here we go, the music.</p>
<p>No, no, I hate the 80s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much better.</p>
<p>No, the 80s culture is so annoying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, I&rsquo;m, when I listen to these things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking, you know, the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>America, the 90s, was popular.</p>
<p>People forget that now.</p>
<p>Like, Clinton was a superstar around the world.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan was exported internationally.</p>
<p>Then basketball was everywhere, suddenly.</p>
<p>You had, like, music, the sports, whatever.</p>
<p>It was a little, probably, like, the 50s,</p>
<p>you know, coming out of the World War</p>
<p>and the Depression before it,</p>
<p>it was like this kind of, like,</p>
<p>everyone was in a good mood kind of time, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, finish a big project and it&rsquo;s Saturday.</p>
<p>It was like, I feel like the 50s was kind of like,</p>
<p>everyone was having, you know, the 20s,</p>
<p>I feel like everyone was in a good mood, randomly.</p>
<p>Then the 30s, everyone was in a bad mood.</p>
<p>But the 90s, I think we&rsquo;ll look back on it</p>
<p>as a time when everyone was in a good mood.</p>
<p>And it was like, you know, again, of course,</p>
<p>at the time, it doesn&rsquo;t feel that way, necessarily.</p>
<p>But I look at that, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>maybe that was kind of America&rsquo;s peak.</p>
<p>And like, no, maybe not.</p>
<p>But like, it hasn&rsquo;t been popular since, really, worldwide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gone in and out, depending on the country.</p>
<p>But like, it hasn&rsquo;t reached that level of, like,</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s awesome around the world.</p>
<p>And the political, you know, situation&rsquo;s gotten,</p>
<p>you know, really ugly.</p>
<p>And, you know, maybe it&rsquo;s social media.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>But I wonder if it&rsquo;ll ever be as simple</p>
<p>and positive as it was then.</p>
<p>Like, maybe we are in the, you know,</p>
<p>it feels a little like maybe we&rsquo;re in the beginning</p>
<p>of the downfall, or not.</p>
<p>Because these things don&rsquo;t just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a perfect smooth hill.</p>
<p>It goes up and down, up and down.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s another big upcoming.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unclear whether public opinion,</p>
<p>which is kind of what you&rsquo;re talking to,</p>
<p>is correlated strongly with influence.</p>
<p>Because you could say that even though America&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>in a decline in terms of public opinion,</p>
<p>the exporting of technology, that America has still,</p>
<p>with all the talk of China, has still been leading the way,</p>
<p>in terms of AI, in terms of social media,</p>
<p>in terms of just basically any software-related product.</p>
<p>Like chips.</p>
<p>Yeah, chips.</p>
<p>So hardware and software, I mean, America leads the way.</p>
<p>You could argue that Google and Microsoft and Facebook</p>
<p>are no longer American companies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re international companies.</p>
<p>But they really are still at the, you know,</p>
<p>headquartered in Silicon Valley, broadly speaking.</p>
<p>So, and Tesla, of course, and just all of its,</p>
<p>all of the technological innovation still seems</p>
<p>to be happening in the United States.</p>
<p>Although, culturally and politically,</p>
<p>this is not, this is not, it&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>Well, maybe that could shift at any moment</p>
<p>when all the technological development can actually be,</p>
<p>create some positive impact in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That could shift it.</p>
<p>Leadership and so on, with the right messaging.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, I don&rsquo;t feel confident at all</p>
<p>about whether, no, no, I don&rsquo;t mean that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean, I don&rsquo;t feel confident, in my opinion,</p>
<p>that we may be on the downswing, or that we may be,</p>
<p>because I truly don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I think the people,</p>
<p>these are really big macro stories</p>
<p>that are really hard to see when you&rsquo;re inside of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like being on a beach</p>
<p>and running around, you know, a few miles this way,</p>
<p>and trying to suss out the shape of the coastline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really hard to see the big picture.</p>
<p>You get caught up in the micro stories,</p>
<p>the little tiny ups and downs</p>
<p>that are part of some bigger trend.</p>
<p>And also, giant paradigm shifts happen quickly nowadays.</p>
<p>The internet came out of nowhere</p>
<p>and suddenly was like, changed everything.</p>
<p>So there could be a changed everything thing on the way.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a few candidates for it.</p>
<p>But I mean, it feels like the stakes are just high,</p>
<p>higher than it even was for the Romans,</p>
<p>higher than it was for because</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re more powerful as a species.</p>
<p>We have God-like powers with technology</p>
<p>that other civilizations at their peak didn&rsquo;t have, and so.</p>
<p>I wonder if those high stakes and powers</p>
<p>will feel laughable to people that live,</p>
<p>humans, aliens, cyborgs,</p>
<p>whatever lives 100 years from now,</p>
<p>that maybe are a little like,</p>
<p>this feeling of political and technological turmoil</p>
<p>is nothing compared to what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the big question.</p>
<p>So right now, you know the 1890s was like</p>
<p>a super politically contentious decade in the US.</p>
<p>It was like immense tribalism</p>
<p>and the newspapers were all like lying and telling.</p>
<p>There was a lot of what we would associate</p>
<p>with today&rsquo;s media, the worst of it.</p>
<p>And it was over gold or silver being this,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s something that I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>But the point is, it was a little bit of a blip, right?</p>
<p>It happened, it must&rsquo;ve felt like</p>
<p>the end of days at the time.</p>
<p>And then now, most people don&rsquo;t even know about that.</p>
<p>Versus, again, the Roman Empire actually collapsed.</p>
<p>And so the question is just like,</p>
<p>is yeah, in 50 years, will this be,</p>
<p>or like McCarthyism, oh, they had like,</p>
<p>oh, that was like a crazy few years in America</p>
<p>and then it was fine.</p>
<p>Or is this the beginning of something really big?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder if we can predict</p>
<p>what the big thing is at the beginning.</p>
<p>It feels like we&rsquo;re not, we&rsquo;re just here along for the ride</p>
<p>and at the local level and at every level</p>
<p>are trying to do our best.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re all just-</p>
<p>How do we do our best?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one thing I know for sure</p>
<p>is that we need to have our wits about us and do our best.</p>
<p>And the way that we can do that,</p>
<p>you know, we have to be as wise as possible, right?</p>
<p>To proceed forward.</p>
<p>And wisdom is an emergent property of discourse.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a proponent of wisdom versus stupidity?</p>
<p>Because you can make an,</p>
<p>I can steal man the case for stupidity.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>I probably can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s some, I think wisdom,</p>
<p>and you talk about this,</p>
<p>can come with a false confidence, arrogance.</p>
<p>I mean, you talk about this in the book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too easy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not wisdom then.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re being arrogant, you&rsquo;re being unwise.</p>
<p>Unwise.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, I think wisdom is doing</p>
<p>what people a hundred years from now</p>
<p>with the hindsight that we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>would do if they could come back in time</p>
<p>and they knew everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how do we figure out how to have hindsight</p>
<p>when we actually are not?</p>
<p>What if stupidity is the thing</p>
<p>that people from a hundred years from now</p>
<p>will see as wise?</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>The idiot by Dostoevsky,</p>
<p>being naive and trusting everybody,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Well, then you get lucky.</p>
<p>Then maybe you get to a good future</p>
<p>by stumbling upon it.</p>
<p>But ideally, you can get there.</p>
<p>Like, I think a lot of,</p>
<p>America, the great things about it</p>
<p>are a product of the wisdom of previous Americans.</p>
<p>You know, the Constitution was a pretty,</p>
<p>you know, pretty wise system to set up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much stupid stumbling around.</p>
<p>Well, there is, I mean,</p>
<p>with Dostoevsky&rsquo;s The Idiot,</p>
<p>Prince Mishkin, and Brothers Karamazov,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Alyosha Karamazov.</p>
<p>You err on the side of love</p>
<p>and almost like a naive trust in other human beings.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be,</p>
<p>at least in my perspective,</p>
<p>in the long term,</p>
<p>for the success of the species is actually wisdom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a compass.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good compass.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in the fog, it&rsquo;s a compass.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Love is a compass.</p>
<p>Okay, but here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>So I think we should have,</p>
<p>a compass is nice,</p>
<p>but you know what else is nice?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a flashlight in the fog.</p>
<p>That can help.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see that far,</p>
<p>but you can see, oh, you can see four feet ahead</p>
<p>instead of one foot.</p>
<p>And that, to me, is discourse.</p>
<p>That is open, vigorous discussion</p>
<p>in a culture that fosters that</p>
<p>is how the species,</p>
<p>is how the American citizens as a unit</p>
<p>can be as wise as possible,</p>
<p>and maybe see four feet ahead</p>
<p>instead of one foot ahead.</p>
<p>That said, Charles Bukowski said</p>
<p>that love is a fog that fades</p>
<p>with the first light of reality.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how that works out,</p>
<p>but I feel like there&rsquo;s intermixing</p>
<p>of metaphors that works.</p>
<p>Okay, you also write that quote,</p>
<p>as the authors of the story of us,</p>
<p>which is this thousand page book,</p>
<p>we have no mentors, no editors,</p>
<p>no one to make sure it all turns out okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all in our hands.</p>
<p>This scares me,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also what gives me hope.</p>
<p>If we can all get just a little wiser together,</p>
<p>it may be enough to nudge the story</p>
<p>onto a trajectory that points</p>
<p>towards an unimaginably good future.</p>
<p>Do you think we can possibly define</p>
<p>what a good future looks like?</p>
<p>I mean, this is the problem</p>
<p>that we ran into with communism,</p>
<p>of thinking of utopia,</p>
<p>of having a deep confidence</p>
<p>about what a utopian world looks like.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a deep confidence.</p>
<p>That was a deep confidence</p>
<p>about the instrumental way to get there.</p>
<p>It was that, you know,</p>
<p>I think a lot of us can agree</p>
<p>that if everyone had everything they needed</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t have disease or poverty</p>
<p>and people could live as long as they wanted to</p>
<p>and choose when to die,</p>
<p>and there was no existential,</p>
<p>major existential threat could be controlled,</p>
<p>I think almost everyone can agree that would be great.</p>
<p>That communism is a,</p>
<p>that was, they said,</p>
<p>this is the way to get there.</p>
<p>And that is, that&rsquo;s a different question, you know?</p>
<p>So the unimaginably good future I&rsquo;m picturing,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people would picture,</p>
<p>and I think most people would agree.</p>
<p>Now, not everyone,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there</p>
<p>who would say humans are the scourge on the earth</p>
<p>and we should de-growth or something,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of people would agree that,</p>
<p>you know, just again,</p>
<p>take Thomas Jefferson, bring him here.</p>
<p>He would see it as a utopia for obvious reasons,</p>
<p>for the medicine, the food, the transportation,</p>
<p>just how, the quality of life and the safety</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>So extrapolate that forward for us.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re Thomas Jefferson, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the equivalent?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>And the big question is,</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t try to say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the way to get there.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the actual specific way to get there.</p>
<p>I try to say, how do we have a flashlight</p>
<p>so that we can together figure it out?</p>
<p>Like, how do we give ourselves the best chance</p>
<p>of figuring out the way to get there?</p>
<p>And I think part of the problem with communists</p>
<p>and people, ideologues,</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re way too overconfident</p>
<p>that they know the way to get there.</p>
<p>And it becomes a religion to them, this solution.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re not, you can&rsquo;t update</p>
<p>once you have a solution as a religion.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>I felt a little violated when you said communists</p>
<p>and stared deeply into myself.</p>
<p>In this book, you&rsquo;ve developed a framework</p>
<p>for how to fix everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called The Ladder.</p>
<p>Can you explain it?</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s not a framework for how to fix everything.</p>
<p>I would never say that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain it to Tim Urban at some point.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How this humor thing works.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>A framework of how to think about collaboration</p>
<p>between humans, such that we could fix things.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a compass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a, it&rsquo;s like a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a ruler that we can,</p>
<p>once we look at it together and see what it is,</p>
<p>we can all say, oh, we want to go to that side</p>
<p>of the ruler, not this side.</p>
<p>And so it gives us a direction to go.</p>
<p>And so what are the parts of The Ladder?</p>
<p>So I have these two characters.</p>
<p>This orange guy, this primitive mind is,</p>
<p>this is our software.</p>
<p>That is the software that was in a 50,000 BC person&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>that was specifically optimized</p>
<p>to help that person survive in that world.</p>
<p>And not even, not just not really survive,</p>
<p>but help them pass their genes on in that world.</p>
<p>And civilization happened quickly</p>
<p>and brains change slowly.</p>
<p>And so that unchanged dude is still running the show</p>
<p>in our head.</p>
<p>And I use the example of like Skittles.</p>
<p>Like, why do we eat Skittles?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trash.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously bad for you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because the primitive mind</p>
<p>in the world that it was programmed for,</p>
<p>there was no Skittles.</p>
<p>And it was just fruit.</p>
<p>And if there was a dense, chewy, sweet fruit like that,</p>
<p>it meant you just found like a calorie gold mine.</p>
<p>Energy, energy, take it.</p>
<p>Take it, eat as much as you can.</p>
<p>Gorge on it.</p>
<p>Hopefully you get a little fat.</p>
<p>It would be the dream.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re so good with energy for a while.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to stress about it anymore.</p>
<p>So today Mars Inc. is clever and says,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not sell things to people&rsquo;s higher minds,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the other character.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s sell to people&rsquo;s primitive minds.</p>
<p>Primitive minds are dumb.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s trick them into thinking</p>
<p>this is this thing you should eat.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll eat it.</p>
<p>Now Mars Inc. is a huge company.</p>
<p>Actually, just to linger real quick.</p>
<p>So you said primitive mind and higher mind.</p>
<p>So those are the two things that make up</p>
<p>this bigger mind that is the modern human being.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s not perfect.</p>
<p>Obviously there&rsquo;s a lot of crossover.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who will yell at me for saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two minds and you know that.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s still a useful framework</p>
<p>where you have this software that has making decisions</p>
<p>based on a world that you&rsquo;re not in anymore.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got this other character.</p>
<p>I call it the higher mind.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the part of you that knows</p>
<p>that skills are not good and can override the instinct.</p>
<p>And the reason you don&rsquo;t always eat Skittles</p>
<p>is because the higher mind says,</p>
<p>no, no, no, we&rsquo;re not doing that.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s bad and I know that, right?</p>
<p>Now, you can apply that to a lot of things.</p>
<p>The higher mind is the one that knows</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t procrastinate.</p>
<p>The primitive mind is the one that wants to conserve energy</p>
<p>and not do anything icky and can&rsquo;t see the future,</p>
<p>so he procrastinates.</p>
<p>You know, you can apply this.</p>
<p>No, I, in this book, apply it to</p>
<p>how we form our beliefs is one of the ways.</p>
<p>And then eventually to politics and political movements.</p>
<p>But like, if you think about,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s the equivalent of the Skittles tug of war</p>
<p>in your head for how do you form your beliefs?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that the primitive mind in the world</p>
<p>that it was optimized for,</p>
<p>it wanted to feel conviction about its beliefs.</p>
<p>It wanted to be sure that it was,</p>
<p>it wanted to feel conviction</p>
<p>and it wanted to agree with the people around it.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t want to stand out.</p>
<p>It wanted to fervently agree with the tribe</p>
<p>about the tribe&rsquo;s sacred beliefs, right?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a big part of us that wants to do that,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t like changing our mind.</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s part of our,</p>
<p>the primitive mind identifies with beliefs.</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s a threat, a physical threat to you,</p>
<p>to your primitive mind when you change your mind</p>
<p>or when someone disagrees with you in a smart way.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that huge force in us,</p>
<p>which is confirmation bias.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where that comes from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this desire to keep believing what we believe</p>
<p>and this desire to also fit in with our beliefs,</p>
<p>to believe what the people around us believe.</p>
<p>And that can be fun in some ways.</p>
<p>We all like the same sports team and we&rsquo;re all super into it</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all gonna be biased about that call together.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not always bad,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a very smart way to be.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re actually, you&rsquo;re working kind of for those ideas.</p>
<p>Those ideas are like your boss</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re working so hard to keep believing those.</p>
<p>Those ideas are, you know,</p>
<p>a really good paper comes in that you read</p>
<p>that conflicts with those ideas.</p>
<p>And you will do all this work to say that paper&rsquo;s bullshit</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a faithful employee of those ideas.</p>
<p>Now the higher mind, to me,</p>
<p>the same party that can override the Skittles</p>
<p>can override this and can search for something</p>
<p>that makes a lot more sense, which is truth.</p>
<p>Because what rational being wouldn&rsquo;t want to know the truth?</p>
<p>Who wants to be delusional?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this tug of war</p>
<p>because the higher mind doesn&rsquo;t identify with ideas.</p>
<p>Why would you?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an experiment you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mental model.</p>
<p>And if someone can come over and say, you&rsquo;re wrong,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say, where, where, show me, show me.</p>
<p>And if they point out something that is wrong,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say, oh, thanks.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>I just got a little smarter, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna identify with the thing.</p>
<p>Go, yeah, kick it.</p>
<p>See if you can break it.</p>
<p>If you can break it, it&rsquo;s not that good, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s both of these in our heads</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this tug of war between them.</p>
<p>And sometimes, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re telling me about something with AI,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably gonna think with my higher mind</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not identified with it.</p>
<p>If you go and you criticize the ideas in this book</p>
<p>or you criticize my religious beliefs,</p>
<p>you criticize, I might have a harder time</p>
<p>because the primitive mind says, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Those are our special ideas.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, so that&rsquo;s one way to use this ladder</p>
<p>is like, it&rsquo;s a spectrum.</p>
<p>You know, at the top,</p>
<p>the higher mind is doing all the thinking.</p>
<p>And then as you go down, it becomes more of a tug of war.</p>
<p>And at the bottom, the primitive mind is in total control.</p>
<p>And this is distinct, as you show,</p>
<p>from the spectrum of ideas.</p>
<p>So this is how you think versus what you think.</p>
<p>And those are distinct.</p>
<p>Those are different dimensions.</p>
<p>We need a vertical axis.</p>
<p>We have all these horizontal axes,</p>
<p>left, right, center, or, you know,</p>
<p>this opinion all the way to this opinion.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s much more important</p>
<p>than where you stand is how you got there, right?</p>
<p>And how you think.</p>
<p>So this helps if I can say this person&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>on the left or on the right, but they&rsquo;re up high,</p>
<p>I think, in other words, I think they got there</p>
<p>using evidence and reason</p>
<p>and they were willing to change their mind.</p>
<p>Now, that means a lot to me, what they have to say.</p>
<p>If I think they&rsquo;re just a tribal person</p>
<p>and I can predict all their beliefs from hearing one</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so obvious what political beliefs,</p>
<p>that person&rsquo;s views are irrelevant to me</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not real.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t come from information.</p>
<p>They came from a tribe&rsquo;s kind of, you know,</p>
<p>sacred 10 commandments.</p>
<p>I really like the comic you have in here with the boxer.</p>
<p>This is the best boxer in the world.</p>
<p>Wow, cool.</p>
<p>Who has he beaten?</p>
<p>No one, he&rsquo;s never fought anyone.</p>
<p>Then how do you know he&rsquo;s the best boxer in the world?</p>
<p>I can just tell.</p>
<p>Now, I mean, this connects with me</p>
<p>and I think with a lot of people</p>
<p>just because in martial arts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s especially kind of true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this whole legend about different martial artists</p>
<p>and that kind of would construct like action figures,</p>
<p>like, you know, thinking that Steven Seagal</p>
<p>is the best fighter in the world or Chuck Norris.</p>
<p>But Chuck Norris is actually backed up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done really well in competition,</p>
<p>but still the ultimate test for particular for martial arts</p>
<p>is what we now know as mixed martial arts, UFC and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the actual scientific testing ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a meritocracy.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s within certain rules</p>
<p>and you can criticize those rules,</p>
<p>like this doesn&rsquo;t actually represent the broader combat</p>
<p>that you would think of</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re thinking about martial arts,</p>
<p>but reality is you&rsquo;re actually testing things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you realize that Aikido</p>
<p>and some of these kind of woo-woo martial arts</p>
<p>in their certain implementations</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work in the way you think they would</p>
<p>in the context of fighting.</p>
<p>I think this is one of the places where everyone can agree,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s a really nice comic.</p>
<p>Because then you start to talk about,</p>
<p>map this onto ideas that people take personally,</p>
<p>it starts becoming a lot more difficult</p>
<p>to basically highlight that we&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>with not with our higher mind, but with our primitive mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, if I&rsquo;m thinking with my higher mind,</p>
<p>and now here, you can use different things</p>
<p>for an idea as a metaphor.</p>
<p>So here, the metaphor is a boxer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For one of your conclusions.</p>
<p>For one of your beliefs.</p>
<p>And if all I care about is truth,</p>
<p>in other words, that means all I care about</p>
<p>is having a good boxer,</p>
<p>I would say, go, yeah, try, see if this person&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>In other words, I would get into arguments,</p>
<p>which is throwing my boxer out there</p>
<p>to fight against other ones.</p>
<p>And if I think my argument&rsquo;s good, by the way,</p>
<p>I love boxing.</p>
<p>If I think my guy is amazing, Mike Tyson,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking, oh yeah, bring it on.</p>
<p>Who wants to come see?</p>
<p>I bet no one can beat my boxer.</p>
<p>I love a good debate, right, in that case.</p>
<p>Now, what would you think about my boxer?</p>
<p>If not only was I telling you he was great,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s never boxed anyone, but then you said,</p>
<p>okay, well, your idea came over to try to punch him.</p>
<p>And I screamed and I said, what are you doing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s violence and you&rsquo;re an awful person.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna be friends with you anymore</p>
<p>because you would think this boxer obviously sucks.</p>
<p>Or at least I think it sucks, deep down,</p>
<p>because why would I be so anti anyone?</p>
<p>No boxing allowed.</p>
<p>So I think if you&rsquo;re in, so I call this a ladder, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in low-rung land,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a culture or whatever,</p>
<p>a debate, an argument, when someone says,</p>
<p>no, that&rsquo;s totally wrong, what you&rsquo;re saying about that,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s why, you&rsquo;re actually being totally biased,</p>
<p>it sounds like a fight.</p>
<p>People are gonna say, oh wow, we got in a fight.</p>
<p>It was really awkward.</p>
<p>Are we still friends with that person?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s not a culture of boxing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a culture where you don&rsquo;t touch each other&rsquo;s ideas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insensitive.</p>
<p>Versus in a high-rung culture, it&rsquo;s sport.</p>
<p>I mean, like every one of your podcasts,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re agreeing or disagreeing,</p>
<p>the tone is the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, oh, this got awkward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, the tone is identical</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just playing intellectually either way</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a good high-rung space.</p>
<p>At his best, but people do take stuff personally.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually one of the skills of conversation</p>
<p>just as a fan of podcasts,</p>
<p>is when you sense that people take a thing personally,</p>
<p>you have to like, there&rsquo;s sort of methodologies</p>
<p>and little paths you can take to calm things down.</p>
<p>Like go around, don&rsquo;t take it as a violation of like that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to suss out which of their ideas</p>
<p>are sacred to them, and which ones are, ah, bring it on.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the skill of it, I suppose,</p>
<p>that sometimes it&rsquo;s the certain wordings</p>
<p>in the way you challenge those ideas are important.</p>
<p>You can challenge them indirectly</p>
<p>and then together, walk together in that way.</p>
<p>Because what I&rsquo;ve learned is people are used to their ideas</p>
<p>being attacked in a certain way, in a certain tribal way.</p>
<p>And if you just avoid those,</p>
<p>like for example, if you have political discussions</p>
<p>and just never mentioned left or right</p>
<p>or Republican and Democrat, none of that,</p>
<p>just talk about different ideas</p>
<p>and avoid certain kind of triggering words.</p>
<p>You can actually talk about ideas</p>
<p>versus falling into this path</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s well-established through battles</p>
<p>that people have previously fought.</p>
<p>When you say triggering, I mean,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s getting triggered?</p>
<p>The primitive mind.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying in this language</p>
<p>is how do you have conversations</p>
<p>with other people&rsquo;s higher minds,</p>
<p>almost like whispering, without waking up the primitive mind.</p>
<p>Primitive mind is there sleeping, right?</p>
<p>And as soon as you say something,</p>
<p>the left primitive mind gets up and says, what?</p>
<p>What are you saying about the left?</p>
<p>And now everything goes off the rails.</p>
<p>What do you make of conspiracy theories</p>
<p>under this framework of the latter?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing about conspiracy theories</p>
<p>is that once in a while, they&rsquo;re true, right?</p>
<p>Because sometimes there&rsquo;s an actual conspiracy.</p>
<p>Actually, humans are pretty good at real conspiracies,</p>
<p>secret things, and then I just watched the Madoff doc,</p>
<p>great new Netflix doc, by the way.</p>
<p>And so the question is,</p>
<p>how do you create a system that is good at,</p>
<p>you put the conspiracy theory in,</p>
<p>and it either goes, eh, or it says,</p>
<p>this is interesting, let&rsquo;s keep exploring it.</p>
<p>Like, how do you do something that it can,</p>
<p>how do you assess?</p>
<p>And so again, I think the high-rung culture</p>
<p>is really good at it because a real conspiracy,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen is you put it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a little machine you put</p>
<p>in the middle of the table,</p>
<p>and everyone starts firing darts at it,</p>
<p>or bow and arrow, or whatever,</p>
<p>and everyone starts kicking it and trying to,</p>
<p>and almost all conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>they quickly crumble, right?</p>
<p>Because they actually, you know,</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s election one is,</p>
<p>I actually dug in and I looked at every claim</p>
<p>that he or his team made,</p>
<p>and I was like, all of these,</p>
<p>none of these hold up to scrutiny, none of them.</p>
<p>I was open-minded, but none of them did.</p>
<p>So that was one that as soon as it&rsquo;s open to scrutiny,</p>
<p>it crumbles.</p>
<p>The only way that conspiracy can stick around</p>
<p>in a community is if it is a culture</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s being treated as a sacred idea</p>
<p>that no one should kick or throw a dart at,</p>
<p>because if you throw a dart, it&rsquo;s gonna break.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s being, and so what you want</p>
<p>is a culture where no idea is sacred.</p>
<p>Anything can get thrown at,</p>
<p>and so I think that then what you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>is that 94 out of 100 conspiracy theories come in,</p>
<p>and they fall down.</p>
<p>The other, maybe four of the others come in,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as extreme as people say,</p>
<p>and then maybe one is a huge deal,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually a real conspiracy.</p>
<p>Well, isn&rsquo;t there a lot of gray area,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of mystery?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that where the conspiracy theories seep in?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s great to hear that you&rsquo;ve really looked</p>
<p>into the Trump election fraud claims,</p>
<p>but aren&rsquo;t they resting on a lot of kind of gray area,</p>
<p>like fog, basically saying that there is dark forces</p>
<p>in the shadows that are actually controlling everything?</p>
<p>I mean, the same thing with maybe you can,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s safer conspiracy theories, less controversial ones,</p>
<p>like have we landed on the moon, right?</p>
<p>Did the United States ever land on the moon?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, you know, like the reason</p>
<p>those conspiracy theories work is you could construct,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s incentives and motivation</p>
<p>for faking the moon landing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very little data supporting the moon landing</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s very public and kind of looks fake.</p>
<p>Space kind of looks fake.</p>
<p>And that would be a big story if it turned out to be fake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, that would be the argument against it.</p>
<p>Like are people really, as a collective,</p>
<p>going to hold onto a story that big?</p>
<p>Yeah, so that, but there&rsquo;s a lot,</p>
<p>the reason they work is there&rsquo;s mystery.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a great documentary</p>
<p>called Behind the Curve about flat earthers,</p>
<p>and one of the things that you learn about flat earthers</p>
<p>is they believe all the conspiracies,</p>
<p>not just the flat earth.</p>
<p>They are convinced the moon landing is fake.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re convinced 9-11 was an American con job.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re convinced, you know,</p>
<p>that name a conspiracy and they believe it.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s so interesting is that</p>
<p>I think of it as a skepticism spectrum.</p>
<p>So on one side, you, it&rsquo;s like a filter in your head,</p>
<p>filter in the beliefs section of your brain.</p>
<p>On one end of the spectrum, you are gullible,</p>
<p>perfectly gullible.</p>
<p>You believe anything someone says, right?</p>
<p>On the other side, you&rsquo;re paranoid.</p>
<p>You think everyone&rsquo;s lying to you, right?</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s, everything is false.</p>
<p>Nothing that anyone says is true, right?</p>
<p>So obviously those aren&rsquo;t good places to be.</p>
<p>Now, the healthy place, I think that the,</p>
<p>so I think the healthy place is to be</p>
<p>somewhere in the middle,</p>
<p>but also you can learn to trust certain sources</p>
<p>and then, you know, you don&rsquo;t have to do as much,</p>
<p>apply as much skepticism to them.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s what, like,</p>
<p>and when you start having a bias,</p>
<p>just say you have a political bias,</p>
<p>when your side says something,</p>
<p>you will find yourself moving towards</p>
<p>the gullible side of the spectrum.</p>
<p>You read an article written that supports your views,</p>
<p>you move to the gullible side of the spectrum</p>
<p>and you just believe it and you don&rsquo;t have any,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s that skepticism that you normally have, right?</p>
<p>And then you move, and then you,</p>
<p>as soon as it&rsquo;s the other person talking,</p>
<p>the other team talking, you move to the skeptical,</p>
<p>closer to the, you know, in denial, paranoid side.</p>
<p>Now, flat earthers are the extreme.</p>
<p>They are either at 10 or one.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s so interesting</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the people who are saying,</p>
<p>ah, no, I won&rsquo;t believe you, I&rsquo;m not gullible,</p>
<p>no, everyone else is gullible about the moon landing,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then yet, when there&rsquo;s this evidence like,</p>
<p>oh, because you can&rsquo;t see Seattle,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t see the buildings over that horizon,</p>
<p>and you should, which isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>You should be, if the Earth were round,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see them.</p>
<p>Therefore, so suddenly they become</p>
<p>the most gullible person.</p>
<p>They hear any theory about the Earth flat, they believe it.</p>
<p>It goes right into their beliefs.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re actually jumping back and forth</p>
<p>between refusing to believe anything and believe anything.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re the extreme example,</p>
<p>but I think when it comes to conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>the people that get themselves into trouble</p>
<p>are the ones who, they become really gullible</p>
<p>when they hear a conspiracy theory</p>
<p>that kind of fits with their worldview.</p>
<p>And they likewise, when there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of obviously true and it&rsquo;s not a big lie,</p>
<p>they will actually, they&rsquo;ll think it is.</p>
<p>They just tighten up their kind of skepticism filter.</p>
<p>And so, yeah.</p>
<p>So I think the healthy places to be is where you are not,</p>
<p>because you also don&rsquo;t want to be the person who says,</p>
<p>every conspiracy, you hear the word conspiracy theory</p>
<p>and it sounds like a synonym</p>
<p>for quack job crazy theory, right?</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;d be somewhere in the middle of that spectrum</p>
<p>and to learn to fine tune it.</p>
<p>Which is a tricky place to operate,</p>
<p>because you kind of have to,</p>
<p>every time you hear a new conspiracy theory,</p>
<p>you should approach it with an open mind.</p>
<p>And also if you don&rsquo;t have enough time to investigate,</p>
<p>which most people don&rsquo;t, kind of still have a humility</p>
<p>not to make a conclusive statement that that&rsquo;s nonsense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of social pressure, actually,</p>
<p>to immediately laugh off any conspiracy theory,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s done by the bad guys, right?</p>
<p>You will quickly get mocked and laughed at</p>
<p>and not taken seriously if you give any credence.</p>
<p>You know, back the lab leak was a good one,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, turned out that that was</p>
<p>at least very credible, if not true.</p>
<p>And that was a perfect example of one</p>
<p>where when it first came out,</p>
<p>not only so, so Brett Weinstein talked about it.</p>
<p>And then I, in a totally different conversation,</p>
<p>said something complimentary about him</p>
<p>on a totally different subject.</p>
<p>And people were saying,</p>
<p>Tam, you might have gone a little off the deep end.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like quoting someone who is like a lab leak person.</p>
<p>So I was getting my reputation dinged</p>
<p>for complimenting on a different topic</p>
<p>someone whose reputation was totally sullied</p>
<p>because they questioned an orthodoxy, right?</p>
<p>So you see, so what does that make me want to do?</p>
<p>Distance myself from Brett Weinstein.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, at least that&rsquo;s the incentive that&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>and what does that make other people want to do?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t become the next Brett Weinstein.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say it out loud because you don&rsquo;t want to become</p>
<p>someone that no one wants to compliment anymore, right?</p>
<p>You can see the social pressure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, and of course, when there is a conspiracy,</p>
<p>that social pressure is its best friend.</p>
<p>Because then they see the people from outside</p>
<p>are seeing that social pressure enact,</p>
<p>like a Tim Urban becoming more and more and more extreme</p>
<p>to the other side.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re going to take the more and more</p>
<p>and more extreme.</p>
<p>I mean, this, what do you see that the pandemic did,</p>
<p>that COVID did to our civilization in that regard,</p>
<p>in the forces?</p>
<p>Why was it so divisive?</p>
<p>Do you understand that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so COVID, I thought might be,</p>
<p>we always know the ultimate example of the topic</p>
<p>that will unite us all is the alien attack.</p>
<p>Although honestly, I don&rsquo;t even have that much faith then.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;d be like, some people are super like,</p>
<p>you know, pro-alien and some people are anti-alien.</p>
<p>But anyway.</p>
<p>I was actually starting to interrupt</p>
<p>because I was talking to a few astronomers</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the first folks that made me kind of sad</p>
<p>in that if we did discover life on Mars, for example,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s going to be potentially a division over that too</p>
<p>whereas half the people will not believe that&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>Well, because we live in a current society</p>
<p>where the political divide has subsumed everything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not always like that.</p>
<p>It goes into stages like that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a really bad one where it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>in the book, I call it like a vortex,</p>
<p>like almost like a whirlpool</p>
<p>that pulls everything into it, it pulls.</p>
<p>And so normally you&rsquo;d say, okay, you know,</p>
<p>immigration naturally going to be contentious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always political, right?</p>
<p>But like COVID seemed like,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s one of those that will unite us all.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s fight this not human virus thing.</p>
<p>Like obvious is no one&rsquo;s sensitive.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s like getting hurt when we insult the virus.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s all be, we have this threat,</p>
<p>this common threat that&rsquo;s a threat to everyone</p>
<p>of every nationality in every country, every ethnicity.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t do that at all.</p>
<p>The whirlpool was too powerful.</p>
<p>So it pulled COVID in and suddenly masks,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on the left, you like them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on the right, you hate them.</p>
<p>And suddenly lockdowns, if you&rsquo;re on the left,</p>
<p>you like them and on the right, you hate them.</p>
<p>And vaccines, this is people forget this.</p>
<p>When Trump first started talking about the vaccine,</p>
<p>Biden, Harris, Cuomo,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all saying, I&rsquo;m not taking that vaccine.</p>
<p>Not from this CDC.</p>
<p>Because it was too rushed or something like that.</p>
<p>No, but because I&rsquo;m not trusting anything that Trump says.</p>
<p>Trump wants me to take it, I&rsquo;m not taking it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not taking it from this CDC.</p>
<p>So this was, Trump was almost out of office.</p>
<p>But at the time, if Trump had been,</p>
<p>it would have been, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it would have stayed.</p>
<p>Right likes vaccines, the left doesn&rsquo;t like vaccines.</p>
<p>Instead, the president switched.</p>
<p>And all those people are suddenly saying,</p>
<p>they were actually specifically saying that if you,</p>
<p>you know, that like, if you&rsquo;re saying the CDC</p>
<p>is not trustworthy, that&rsquo;s misinformation.</p>
<p>Which is exactly what they were saying about the other CDC.</p>
<p>And they were saying it because they genuinely</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t trust Trump, which is fair.</p>
<p>But now when other people don&rsquo;t trust the Biden CDC,</p>
<p>suddenly it&rsquo;s this kind of misinformation</p>
<p>that needs to be censored.</p>
<p>So it was a sad moment because it was a couple of months,</p>
<p>even a week or so, I mean a month or so</p>
<p>at the very beginning when it felt like a lot</p>
<p>of our other squabbles were kind of like,</p>
<p>oh, I feel like they&rsquo;re kind of irrelevant right now.</p>
<p>And then very quickly the whirlpool sucked it in.</p>
<p>And in a way where I think it damaged the reputation</p>
<p>of these, a lot of the trust in a lot of these institutions</p>
<p>for the long run.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also an individual psychological impact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a vicious negative feedback cycle</p>
<p>where they were deeply affected on an emotional level</p>
<p>and people just were not their best selves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s definitely true.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, talk about the primitive mind.</p>
<p>I mean, one thing that we&rsquo;ve been dealing with</p>
<p>for our whole human history is pathogens.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s emotional, right?</p>
<p>It brings out, you know, there&rsquo;s really interesting studies</p>
<p>where like if, they studied the phenomenon of disgust,</p>
<p>which is one of these like, you know, smiling is universal.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to ever translate a smile, right?</p>
<p>Certain, you know, throwing your hands up</p>
<p>when your sports team wins is universal</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s part of our coding.</p>
<p>And so is disgust to kind of make this like, you know,</p>
<p>face where you wrinkle up your nose</p>
<p>and you kind of put out your tongue and maybe even gag.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s to expel, expel whatever,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the reaction when something</p>
<p>is potentially a pathogen that might harm us, right?</p>
<p>Feces, vomit, whatever.</p>
<p>But they did this interesting study where people who,</p>
<p>in two groups, the control group, you know,</p>
<p>was shown images of,</p>
<p>and I might be getting two studies mixed up,</p>
<p>but they were showing images of like car crashes</p>
<p>and like disturbing, but not disgusting.</p>
<p>And the other one was shown like, you know,</p>
<p>like, you know, rotting things</p>
<p>and just things that were disgusting.</p>
<p>And then they were asked about immigration.</p>
<p>These were Canadians and the group that was,</p>
<p>had the disgust feeling going through,</p>
<p>pulsing through their body was way more likely</p>
<p>to prefer like immigrants from white countries.</p>
<p>And the group that was, had been shown car accidents,</p>
<p>they were, they still prefer the groups</p>
<p>from white countries, but much less so.</p>
<p>And so what does that mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because the disgust impulse makes us scared of,</p>
<p>you know, sexual practices that are foreign,</p>
<p>of ethnicities that are not look,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t look like us, of, it&rsquo;s still xenophobia.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s ugly, it&rsquo;s really ugly stuff.</p>
<p>This is of course also how, you know,</p>
<p>the Nazi propaganda with cockroaches and,</p>
<p>or it was, Rwandan was cockroaches, you know,</p>
<p>the Nazis was rats and, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s specifically, it&rsquo;s a dehumanizing emotion.</p>
<p>So anyway, we were talking about COVID,</p>
<p>but I think it does, it taps deep into like</p>
<p>the human psyche and it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t think it brings out our,</p>
<p>I think, like you said,</p>
<p>I think it brings out an ugly side in us.</p>
<p>You describe an idea lab as being opposite of echo chambers.</p>
<p>So we know what echo chambers are.</p>
<p>And you said like, there&rsquo;s basically no good term</p>
<p>for the opposite of an echo chamber.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s an idea lab?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, first of all, both of these,</p>
<p>we think of an echo chamber as like a group maybe,</p>
<p>or even a place, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a culture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an intellectual culture.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And this goes along with the high rung, low,</p>
<p>so high rung and low rung thinking is individual.</p>
<p>So I was talking about what&rsquo;s going on in your head,</p>
<p>but this is very connected to the social scene around us.</p>
<p>And so groups will do high rung</p>
<p>and low rung thinking together.</p>
<p>Basically it&rsquo;s, so an echo chamber to me</p>
<p>is a collaborative low rung thinking.</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s a culture where the cool,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s based around a sacred set of ideas.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the coolest thing you can do</p>
<p>in an echo chamber culture is talk about how great</p>
<p>the sacred ideas are and how bad and evil</p>
<p>and stupid and wrong the people are</p>
<p>who have the other views.</p>
<p>And this, and it&rsquo;s quite boring, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite boring, you know, it&rsquo;s very hard to learn.</p>
<p>And changing your mind is not cool</p>
<p>in an echo chamber culture.</p>
<p>It makes you seem wishy-washy.</p>
<p>It makes you seem like, you know,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re waffling and you&rsquo;re flip-flopping or whatever.</p>
<p>Showing conviction about the sacred ideas</p>
<p>in echo chamber culture is awesome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just like, you know, obviously this,</p>
<p>it makes you seem smart.</p>
<p>While being, you know, humble makes you seem dumb.</p>
<p>So now flip all of those things on their heads.</p>
<p>And you have the opposite, which is idea lab culture,</p>
<p>which is collaborative high rung thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s collaborative truth finding.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also just, it&rsquo;s just a totally different vibe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place where arguing is a fun thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, no one&rsquo;s getting offended.</p>
<p>And criticizing like the thing everyone believes</p>
<p>is actually, it makes you seem like interesting.</p>
<p>Like, oh, really, why do you think we&rsquo;re all wrong?</p>
<p>And expressing too much conviction</p>
<p>makes people lose trust in you.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t make you seem smart, it makes you seem stupid</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re acting like you do.</p>
<p>I really like this diagram of where on the x-axis</p>
<p>is agreement and the y-axis is decency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in an idea lab.</p>
<p>In an echo chamber, there&rsquo;s only one axis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s asshole to non-asshole.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>This is a really important thing to understand</p>
<p>about the difference between, you call it decency here,</p>
<p>about assholishness and disagreement.</p>
<p>So my college friends, we love to argue, right?</p>
<p>And no one thought anyone was an asshole for,</p>
<p>it was just for sport.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;d realize we&rsquo;re not even disagreeing</p>
<p>on something and that would be disappointing.</p>
<p>And be like, oh, I think we agree.</p>
<p>And it was kind of like sad.</p>
<p>It was like, oh, well, there goes the fun.</p>
<p>And one of the members of this group has this,</p>
<p>she brought her new boyfriend to one of our like hangouts.</p>
<p>And there was like a heated, heated debate.</p>
<p>Just one of our typical things.</p>
<p>And afterwards, the next day he said like,</p>
<p>is everything okay?</p>
<p>And she was like, what do you mean?</p>
<p>And he said like after the fight.</p>
<p>And she was like, what fight?</p>
<p>And he was like, you know, the fight last night.</p>
<p>And she was like, and she had to,</p>
<p>and then she was like, you mean like the arguing?</p>
<p>And he was like, yeah.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s someone who is not used</p>
<p>to idea lab culture coming into it.</p>
<p>And seeing it as like, that was like,</p>
<p>this is like, are they still friends, right?</p>
<p>And idea lab is nice for the people in them</p>
<p>because individuals thrive.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to just conform.</p>
<p>It makes you seem boring in an idea,</p>
<p>but you want to be yourself.</p>
<p>You want to challenge things.</p>
<p>You want to have a unique brain.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And you also have people criticizing your ideas,</p>
<p>which makes you smarter.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t always feel good,</p>
<p>but you become more correct and smarter.</p>
<p>An echo chamber is the opposite</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not good for the people in it.</p>
<p>Your learning skills atrophy, and I think it&rsquo;s boring.</p>
<p>But the thing is they also have emergent properties.</p>
<p>So the emergent property of an idea lab</p>
<p>is like super intelligence.</p>
<p>Just you and me alone, just the two of us.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re working together on something,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re being really grown up about it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re disagreeing, we&rsquo;re not, you know,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s sensitive about anything,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to each find flaws in the other one&rsquo;s arguments</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t have found on your own.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to have double the epiphanies, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like the two of us together</p>
<p>is like as smart as 1.5.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 50% smarter than either of us alone, right?</p>
<p>So you have this 1.5 intelligent</p>
<p>kind of joint being that we&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>Now bring a third person and fourth person in, right?</p>
<p>You see, it starts to scale up.</p>
<p>This is why science institutions can discover</p>
<p>relativity and quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and these things that no individual human, you know,</p>
<p>was going to come up with without a ton of collaboration</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s this giant idea lab.</p>
<p>So it has an emergent property of super intelligence.</p>
<p>An echo chamber is the opposite</p>
<p>where it has the emergent property of stupidity.</p>
<p>I mean, it has the emergent property</p>
<p>of a bunch of people all, you know, paying field,</p>
<p>you know, fealty to this set of sacred ideas.</p>
<p>And so you lose this magical thing about language</p>
<p>and humans, which is collaborative intelligence.</p>
<p>You lose it.</p>
<p>It disappears.</p>
<p>But there is that axis of decency,</p>
<p>which is really interesting</p>
<p>because you kind of painted this picture</p>
<p>of you and your friends arguing really harshly.</p>
<p>But underlying that is a basic camaraderie, respect,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of mechanisms</p>
<p>we humans have constructed to communicate,</p>
<p>like mutual respect or maybe communicate</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re here for the idea lab version of this.</p>
<p>Totally, you don&rsquo;t get personal, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not getting personal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not taking things personally.</p>
<p>People are respected in an idea lab</p>
<p>and ideas are disrespected.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s ways to signal that.</p>
<p>So like with friends, you&rsquo;ve already done the signaling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already established a relationship.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is online.</p>
<p>I think you have to do some of that work.</p>
<p>To me, the sort of steel manning the other side,</p>
<p>or no, having empathy and hearing out,</p>
<p>being able to basically repeat the argument</p>
<p>the other person is making before you</p>
<p>and showing like respect to that argument.</p>
<p>I could see how you could think that</p>
<p>before you make a counter argument.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a bunch of ways to communicate</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re here not to do kind of,</p>
<p>what is it, low rung, you know,</p>
<p>shit talking, mockery, derision,</p>
<p>but are actually here ultimately</p>
<p>to discover the truth in the space of ideas</p>
<p>and the tension of those ideas.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a skill that we&rsquo;re all learning</p>
<p>as a civilization of how to do</p>
<p>that kind of communication effectively.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I think disagreement,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m learning on the internet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a really tricky skill.</p>
<p>High effort, high decency, disagreement.</p>
<p>I gotta listen to, there&rsquo;s a really good debate podcast,</p>
<p>Intelligence Squared, and they can go pretty hard</p>
<p>in the paint.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a classic idea lab.</p>
<p>Exactly, but how do we map that to social media?</p>
<p>When people will say, well, like Lex or anybody,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not, you hate disagreement.</p>
<p>You wanna censor disagreement.</p>
<p>No, I love Intelligence Squared type of disagreement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>You wanna reduce assholery.</p>
<p>And for me personally, I don&rsquo;t want to reduce assholery.</p>
<p>You know, I kind of like assholery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like fun in many ways,</p>
<p>but the problem is when the asshole shows up to the party,</p>
<p>they make it less fun for the party</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s there for the idea lab.</p>
<p>And the other people, especially the quiet voices</p>
<p>at the back of the room, they leave.</p>
<p>And so all you&rsquo;re left is with assholes.</p>
<p>Well, political Twitter to me is one of those parties.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big party where a few assholes</p>
<p>have really sent a lot of the quiet thinkers away.</p>
<p>And so if you think about this graph again,</p>
<p>some place like Twitter,</p>
<p>a great way to get followers is to be an asshole</p>
<p>with a certain, you know, pumping a certain ideology.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get a huge amount of followers.</p>
<p>And for those followers,</p>
<p>and the followers you&rsquo;re gonna get,</p>
<p>the people who like you are probably going to be people</p>
<p>who are really thinking with their primitive mind</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re seeing you&rsquo;re being an asshole,</p>
<p>but because you agree with them, they love you.</p>
<p>And they think they don&rsquo;t see any problem</p>
<p>with how you&rsquo;re being.</p>
<p>Yeah, they don&rsquo;t see the asshole.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating thing.</p>
<p>Well, because look at the thing on the right.</p>
<p>Agreement and decency are the same.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in that mindset,</p>
<p>the bigger the asshole, the better.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re agreeing with me, you&rsquo;re my man.</p>
<p>I love what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Yes, show them, right?</p>
<p>And the algorithm helps those people.</p>
<p>Those people do great on the algorithm.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fascinating dynamic that happens</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve currently hired somebody</p>
<p>that looks at my social media and they block people</p>
<p>because the assholes will roll in.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not actually there to have</p>
<p>an interesting disagreement, which I love.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there to do kind of mockery.</p>
<p>And then when they get blocked,</p>
<p>they then celebrate that to their echo chamber.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, look at this, I got him, or whatever.</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;ll say some annoying thing like,</p>
<p>oh, so he talks about he likes,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;d done this, they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>oh, he says he likes Idea Labs,</p>
<p>but he actually wants to create an echo chamber.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like, nope, you&rsquo;re an asshole.</p>
<p>Look at the other 50 people on this thread</p>
<p>that disagreed with me respectfully.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not blocked.</p>
<p>Yep, exactly.</p>
<p>And so they see it as some kind of hypocrisy</p>
<p>because again, they only see the thing on the right.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not understanding that there&rsquo;s two axes,</p>
<p>that I see it as two axes.</p>
<p>And so you seem petty in that moment,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, no, no, no,</p>
<p>this is very specific what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually killing the conversation.</p>
<p>And generally, I give all those folks a pass</p>
<p>and just send them love telepathically.</p>
<p>But yes, getting rid of assholes in the conversation</p>
<p>is the way you allow for the disagreement.</p>
<p>You do a lot of, I think when primitive-mindedness</p>
<p>comes at you, at least on Twitter,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re feeling internally in that moment,</p>
<p>but you do a lot of, I&rsquo;m gonna meet that</p>
<p>with my higher mind.</p>
<p>And you come out and you&rsquo;ll be like,</p>
<p>thanks for all the criticism, I love you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually an amazing response</p>
<p>because what it does is that it unriles up</p>
<p>that person&rsquo;s primitive mind</p>
<p>and actually wakes up their higher mind</p>
<p>who says, oh, okay, this guy&rsquo;s not so bad.</p>
<p>And suddenly, civility comes back.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very powerful.</p>
<p>Hopefully long-term, but the thing is</p>
<p>they do seem to drive away high-quality disagreement</p>
<p>because it takes so much effort</p>
<p>to disagree in a high-quality way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this on my blog.</p>
<p>One of the things I pride myself on</p>
<p>is my comment section is awesome.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s being respectful.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s afraid to disagree with me</p>
<p>and tear my post apart, but in a totally respectful way</p>
<p>where the underlying thing is like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here because I like this guy and his writing</p>
<p>and people disagree with each other.</p>
<p>And they get in these long, and it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>and I read it and I&rsquo;m learning.</p>
<p>And then a couple of posts,</p>
<p>especially the ones I&rsquo;ve written about politics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like, it seems like any other comment section.</p>
<p>People are being nasty to me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re being nasty to each other.</p>
<p>And then I looked down one of them</p>
<p>and I realized almost all of this</p>
<p>is the work of three people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who you need to block.</p>
<p>Those people need to be blocked.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not being thin-skinned.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not being petty doing it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually protecting an idea lab.</p>
<p>Because what really aggressive people like that do</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;ll turn it into their own echo chamber.</p>
<p>Because now everyone is scared</p>
<p>to kind of disagree with them, it&rsquo;s unpleasant.</p>
<p>And so people who will chime in</p>
<p>are the people who agree with them.</p>
<p>And suddenly, they&rsquo;ve taken over the space.</p>
<p>And I kind of believe that those people</p>
<p>on a different day could actually</p>
<p>do high-effort disagreement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re in a certain kind of mood.</p>
<p>And a lot of us, just like you said,</p>
<p>with a primitive mind, could get into that mood.</p>
<p>And I believe it&rsquo;s actually the job</p>
<p>of the technology, the platform,</p>
<p>to incentivize those folks to be like,</p>
<p>are you sure this is the best you can do?</p>
<p>If you really wanna talk shit about this idea, do better.</p>
<p>And then we need to create incentives</p>
<p>where you get likes for high-effort disagreement.</p>
<p>Because currently, you get likes</p>
<p>for something that&rsquo;s slightly funny</p>
<p>and is a little bit mockery.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically signals to some kind of echo chamber</p>
<p>that this person is a horrible person,</p>
<p>is a hypocrite, is evil, whatever.</p>
<p>That feels like it&rsquo;s solvable with technology.</p>
<p>Because I think in our private lives,</p>
<p>none of us want that.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s making me think</p>
<p>that I wanna like, because a much easier way</p>
<p>for me to do it just for my world</p>
<p>would be to say something like,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s this axis, this is part of what I like</p>
<p>about the ladder, is it&rsquo;s a language</p>
<p>that specifically what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is high-rung disagreement, good,</p>
<p>low-rung disagreement, bad, right?</p>
<p>And so it gives us a language for that.</p>
<p>And so what I would say is I would have my readers</p>
<p>understand this axis, and then I would specifically say</p>
<p>something like, please do it but why a favor,</p>
<p>and upvote regardless of what they&rsquo;re saying horizontally,</p>
<p>regardless of what their actual view is.</p>
<p>Upvote high-rungness.</p>
<p>They can be tearing me apart,</p>
<p>they can be saying great, they can be praising me, whatever.</p>
<p>Upvote high-rungness and downvote low-rungness.</p>
<p>And if enough people are doing that,</p>
<p>suddenly there&rsquo;s all this incentive</p>
<p>to try to say, no, I need to calm my emotion down here</p>
<p>and not be personal, because I&rsquo;m gonna get voted</p>
<p>into oblivion by these people.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people would be very good at that.</p>
<p>And not only would they be good at that,</p>
<p>they would want that, that task of saying,</p>
<p>I know I completely disagree with this person,</p>
<p>but this was a high-effort, high-rung disagreement.</p>
<p>It gets everyone thinking about that other axis, too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just looking at where do you stand horizontally,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying, well, how did you get there,</p>
<p>and how are you, are you treating ideas like machines,</p>
<p>or are you treating them like little babies?</p>
<p>And that there should be some kind of labeling</p>
<p>on personal attacks versus idea disagreement.</p>
<p>Sometimes people throw in both a little bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, all right, no, there should be a disincentive</p>
<p>at personal attacks versus idea attacks.</p>
<p>One metric is a respectful disagreement.</p>
<p>If I see, just say someone else&rsquo;s Twitter,</p>
<p>and I see you put out a thought,</p>
<p>and I see someone say, I don&rsquo;t see it that way,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where I think you went wrong,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just explaining.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking that if Lex reads that,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be interested.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna wanna post more stuff, right?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s gonna like that.</p>
<p>If I see someone being like,</p>
<p>wow, this really shows the kind of person that you become,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking, that person is making Lex</p>
<p>want to be on Twitter less.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making him, and so what&rsquo;s that doing?</p>
<p>What that person&rsquo;s actually doing is they&rsquo;re putting,</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re actually, they&rsquo;re chilling discussion,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re making it unpleasant to,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making it scary to say what you think.</p>
<p>And the first person isn&rsquo;t at all.</p>
<p>The first person is making you wanna say more stuff.</p>
<p>So, and those are both disagreed.</p>
<p>Those are people who both disagree with you.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>I want to, great disagreements with friends in meat space</p>
<p>is like you&rsquo;re, they disagree with you.</p>
<p>They could be even yelling at you.</p>
<p>Honestly, they could even have some shit talk</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like personal attacks.</p>
<p>It still feels good.</p>
<p>Because you know them well,</p>
<p>and you know that that shit talk,</p>
<p>because yeah, friends shit talk all the time,</p>
<p>playing a sport or a game.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s because they know each other well enough</p>
<p>to know that this is fun.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having fun, and obviously I love you.</p>
<p>Like, you know, and that&rsquo;s important online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot harder.</p>
<p>Yeah, that obviously I love you</p>
<p>that underlies a lot of human interaction</p>
<p>seems to be easily lost online.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some people on Twitter and elsewhere</p>
<p>just behave their worst.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I know that&rsquo;s not who you are.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Like, why are you, who is this human?</p>
<p>I know someone personally who is one of the best people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It just, I love this guy.</p>
<p>Like one of the best, like fun, funny, like nicest dudes.</p>
<p>And he, if you looked at his Twitter only,</p>
<p>you would think he&rsquo;s a culture warrior,</p>
<p>an awful culture warrior.</p>
<p>And, you know, biased and just stoking anger.</p>
<p>And it comes out of a good place.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna give any other info about,</p>
<p>you know, specific, but like,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re describing a lot of people.</p>
<p>It comes out of a good place</p>
<p>because he really cares about what, you know,</p>
<p>it comes out, but it&rsquo;s just, I can&rsquo;t square the two.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, and that&rsquo;s, you have to,</p>
<p>once you know someone like that,</p>
<p>you can realize, okay, apply that to everyone.</p>
<p>Because a lot of these people are lovely people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just bring, even just, you know,</p>
<p>back in the, before social media,</p>
<p>you ever had a friend who like,</p>
<p>was just like, they had this like dickishness</p>
<p>on text or email that they didn&rsquo;t have in person.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, wow, like email you is like kind of a dick.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it just, certain people</p>
<p>have a different persona behind the screen.</p>
<p>It has, for me personally, become a bit of a meme</p>
<p>that Lex blocks with love.</p>
<p>But there is a degree to that where this is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see people on social media</p>
<p>as representing who they really are.</p>
<p>I really do have love for them.</p>
<p>I really do think positive thoughts of them</p>
<p>throughout the entirety of the experience.</p>
<p>I see this as some weird side effect</p>
<p>of online communication.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, to me, blocking is not</p>
<p>some kind of a derisive act towards that individual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like saying-</p>
<p>Well, a lot of times what&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>is they have slipped into a very common delusion</p>
<p>that dehumanizes others.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re a bad person.</p>
<p>We all can do it.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re dehumanizing you,</p>
<p>or whoever they&rsquo;re being nasty to,</p>
<p>because in a way they would never do in person,</p>
<p>because in a person they&rsquo;re reminded that&rsquo;s a person.</p>
<p>Remember I said the dumb part of my brain</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m doing VR won&rsquo;t step off the cliff,</p>
<p>but the smart part of my brain knows I&rsquo;m just on the rug?</p>
<p>That dumb part of our brain is really dumb in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the part of your brain where you can</p>
<p>set the clock five minutes fast to help you not be late.</p>
<p>The smart part of your brain knows that you did that,</p>
<p>but the dumb part will fall for it, right?</p>
<p>That same dumb part of your brain can forget</p>
<p>that the person behind that screen,</p>
<p>that behind that handle, is a human that has feelings.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re a bad person</p>
<p>for forgetting that, because it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Well, this really interesting idea,</p>
<p>and I wonder if it&rsquo;s true that you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>is that both primitive-mindedness</p>
<p>and high-mindedness tend to be contagious.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re right that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to make both contagious,</p>
<p>because our sort of popular intuition is</p>
<p>only one of the primitive-mindedness is contagious,</p>
<p>as exhibited by social media.</p>
<p>To compliment you again, don&rsquo;t you think that your,</p>
<p>your Twitter to me is like, I was just looking down,</p>
<p>and I mean, it is a, it&rsquo;s just high-mindedness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just high-mindedness, down, down, down, down, down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gratitude, it&rsquo;s optimism, it&rsquo;s love, it&rsquo;s forgiveness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all these things that are the opposite</p>
<p>of grievance and victimhood and resentment and pessimism,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s, I think, a reason that a lot of people</p>
<p>follow you, because it is contagious.</p>
<p>It makes other people feel those feelings.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve been recently,</p>
<p>over the past few months, attacked quite a lot,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fascinating to watch,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s over things that,</p>
<p>I think I probably have done stupid things,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m being attacked for things</p>
<p>that are totally not worthy of attack.</p>
<p>I got attacked for a book list.</p>
<p>I saw that book list, by the way.</p>
<p>I thought it was great.</p>
<p>But you can always kind of find ways to,</p>
<p>I guess the assumption is this person surely is a fraud</p>
<p>or some other explanation.</p>
<p>He sure has dead bodies in the basement</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s hiding or something like this,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m going to construct a narrative around that</p>
<p>and mock and attack that.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how that works,</p>
<p>but there is, there does,</p>
<p>and I think you write this in the book,</p>
<p>there seems to be a gravity pulling people</p>
<p>towards the primitive mind and it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Well, when it comes to anything political, right?</p>
<p>Religious, certain things are bottom-heavy for our psyche.</p>
<p>They have a magnet that pulls our psyches</p>
<p>downwards on the ladder, and why?</p>
<p>Why does politics pull our psyches down on the ladder?</p>
<p>Because for the tens of thousand years</p>
<p>that we were evolving during human history,</p>
<p>it was life or death.</p>
<p>Politics was life or death,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s actually an amazing study</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like they challenged</p>
<p>like 20 different beliefs of a person,</p>
<p>and different parts of the person&rsquo;s brain,</p>
<p>and they had an MRI going,</p>
<p>different parts of the person&rsquo;s brain lit up</p>
<p>when non-political beliefs were challenged</p>
<p>versus political beliefs were challenged.</p>
<p>When political beliefs were challenged,</p>
<p>when non-political beliefs were challenged,</p>
<p>the rational, prefrontal cortex type areas were lit up.</p>
<p>When the political beliefs were challenged,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m getting over my head here,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like the parts of your brain,</p>
<p>the default mode network,</p>
<p>the parts of your brain associated with introspection</p>
<p>and your own identity were lit up,</p>
<p>and they were much more likely to change their mind</p>
<p>on all the beliefs, the non-political beliefs.</p>
<p>When that default mode network part of your brain lit up,</p>
<p>you were gonna, if anything,</p>
<p>get more firm in those beliefs</p>
<p>when you had them challenged.</p>
<p>So politics is one of those topics</p>
<p>that just literally, literally lights up</p>
<p>different part of our brain.</p>
<p>Again, I think we come back to primitive mind,</p>
<p>higher mind here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it gets our higher,</p>
<p>this is one of the things our primitive mind</p>
<p>comes programmed to care a ton about,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s gonna be very hard for us</p>
<p>to stay rational and calm and looking for truth</p>
<p>because we have all this gravity to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird because politics, like what is politics?</p>
<p>Like you talk about, it&rsquo;s a bunch of different issues,</p>
<p>and each individual issue, if we really talk about it,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>Yeah, tax policy, like why are we being emotional</p>
<p>about this?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re actually that,</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, we&rsquo;re emotional about something else.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think what we&rsquo;re emotional about is my side,</p>
<p>the side I&rsquo;ve identified with,</p>
<p>is in power and making the decisions,</p>
<p>and your side is out of power,</p>
<p>and if your side&rsquo;s in power, that&rsquo;s really scary for me</p>
<p>because that goes back to the idea of who&rsquo;s making,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s pulling the strings in this tribe, right?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the chief?</p>
<p>Is it your family&rsquo;s patriarch or is it mine?</p>
<p>We might not have food if we don&rsquo;t win this</p>
<p>kind of whatever chief election,</p>
<p>so I think that it&rsquo;s not about the tax policy</p>
<p>or anything like that,</p>
<p>and then it gets tied to this broader,</p>
<p>I think a lot of our tribalism</p>
<p>has really coalesced around this.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have that much religious tribalism in the US,</p>
<p>not the Protestants and the Catholics hate each other,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have that really, right?</p>
<p>And honestly, people like to say</p>
<p>we have racial tribalism and everything,</p>
<p>but a white, even kind of a racist white conservative guy,</p>
<p>I think takes the black conservative</p>
<p>over the woke white person any day of the week right now.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the strongest source of the division.</p>
<p>It tells me that I think politics</p>
<p>has way stronger tribalism right now.</p>
<p>I think that that white racist guy</p>
<p>loves the black conservative guy</p>
<p>compared to the white woke guy, right?</p>
<p>Again, not that racial tribalism isn&rsquo;t a thing,</p>
<p>of course it&rsquo;s always a thing,</p>
<p>but political tribalism is the number one right now.</p>
<p>So race is almost a topic for the political division</p>
<p>versus the actual element of the tribe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a political football, it&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, I mean, this is dark because,</p>
<p>so this is a book about human civilization,</p>
<p>this is a book about human nature,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a book of politics, about politics.</p>
<p>It is, just the way you list it out in the book,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of dark how we just fall</p>
<p>into these left and right checklists.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re on the left, it&rsquo;s maintain Roe v. Wade,</p>
<p>universal healthcare good, mainstream media fine,</p>
<p>guns kill people, U.S. is a racist country,</p>
<p>protect immigrants, tax cuts bad,</p>
<p>climate change awful, raise minimum wage.</p>
<p>And on the right is the flip of that,</p>
<p>reverse Roe v. Wade, universal healthcare bad,</p>
<p>mainstream media bad, people kill people,</p>
<p>not guns kill people, U.S. was a racist country,</p>
<p>protect borders, tax cuts good,</p>
<p>climate change overblown, don&rsquo;t raise minimum wage.</p>
<p>I mean, it has, you almost don&rsquo;t have to think</p>
<p>about any of this, it&rsquo;s like literally.</p>
<p>So when you say it&rsquo;s a book about politics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting because it&rsquo;s a book</p>
<p>about the vertical axis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s specifically not a book about the horizontal axis</p>
<p>in that I&rsquo;m not talking, I don&rsquo;t actually talk</p>
<p>about any of these issues.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t put out an opinion on them.</p>
<p>Those are all horizontal, right?</p>
<p>But when you, so rather than having another book</p>
<p>about those issues, about right versus left,</p>
<p>I wanted to do a book about this other axis.</p>
<p>And so on this axis, the reason I had this checklist</p>
<p>is that this is a low, part of the low rung politics world.</p>
<p>Right, low rung politics is a checklist.</p>
<p>And that checklist evolves, right?</p>
<p>Like Russia suddenly is like popular with the right</p>
<p>as opposed to, you know, it used to be in the 60s,</p>
<p>the left was the one defending Stalin.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll switch, it doesn&rsquo;t even matter,</p>
<p>the substance doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s that this is</p>
<p>the approved checklist of the capital P party</p>
<p>and this is what everyone believes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a low rung thing.</p>
<p>The high rungs, this is not what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>High rung politics, you tell me your one view on this,</p>
<p>I have no idea what you think about anything else.</p>
<p>Right, and you&rsquo;re gonna say I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about a lot of stuff because inherently</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna have that strong an opinion</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have that much info,</p>
<p>these are complex things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and people are all over the place.</p>
<p>You know you&rsquo;re talking to someone who has been</p>
<p>subsumed with low rung politics when if they tell you</p>
<p>their opinion on any one of these issues,</p>
<p>you know you could just rattle off their opinion</p>
<p>on every single other one.</p>
<p>And if in three years it becomes fashionable</p>
<p>to have this new view, they&rsquo;re gonna have it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re not thinking, that&rsquo;s echo chamber culture.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been using kind of a shorthand of centrist</p>
<p>to describe this kind of high rung thinking</p>
<p>but people tend to, I mean it seems to be difficult</p>
<p>to be a centrist or whatever, a high rung thinker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like people want to label you as a person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s too cowardly to take a stance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Somehow, as opposed to saying I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>as a first statement.</p>
<p>Well the problem with centrist is that would mean</p>
<p>that in each of these, tax cuts bad, tax cuts good.</p>
<p>It means that you are saying I am in,</p>
<p>that I think we should have some tax cuts</p>
<p>but not that many.</p>
<p>You might not think that.</p>
<p>You might actually do some research and say</p>
<p>actually I think tax cuts are really important.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean oh I&rsquo;m not a centrist anymore,</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m a far, you know.</p>
<p>No, no, no, that&rsquo;s why we need the second axis.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re trying to be when you say centrist</p>
<p>is high rung.</p>
<p>Which means you might be all over the place horizontally.</p>
<p>You might agree with the far left on this thing,</p>
<p>the far right on this thing.</p>
<p>You might agree with the centrists on this thing.</p>
<p>But calling yourself a centrist actually like</p>
<p>is putting yourself in a prison on the horizontal axis.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s saying that whatever on the different topics,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m right in between the two policy wise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not where you are.</p>
<p>So yeah, that&rsquo;s what we, we&rsquo;re badly missing</p>
<p>this other axis.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean I still do think it&rsquo;s like for me,</p>
<p>I am a centrist when you project it down to the horizontal.</p>
<p>But the point is you&rsquo;re missing so much data</p>
<p>by not considering the vertical.</p>
<p>Because on average maybe it falls somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>But in reality there&rsquo;s just a lot of nuance issue to issue</p>
<p>that involves just thinking and uncertainty</p>
<p>and changing given the context of the current</p>
<p>geopolitics and economics and just always considering,</p>
<p>always questioning, always evolving your views,</p>
<p>all of that.</p>
<p>Not just about like, oh, I think we should be</p>
<p>in the center on this.</p>
<p>But another way to be in the center is</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s some phenomenon happening,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a terrorist attack.</p>
<p>You know, and one side wants to say</p>
<p>this has nothing to do with Islam.</p>
<p>And the other one, the other side wants to say</p>
<p>this is radical Islam.</p>
<p>Right, what&rsquo;s in between those?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s saying this is complicated and nuanced</p>
<p>and we have to learn more.</p>
<p>And it probably has something to do with Islam</p>
<p>and something to do with the economic circumstances</p>
<p>and something to do with, you know, geopolitics.</p>
<p>So in a case like that, you actually do get</p>
<p>really un-nuanced when you go to the extremes</p>
<p>and all of that nuance, which is where</p>
<p>all the truth usually is, is going to be in the middle.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>But there is a truth to the fact that</p>
<p>if you take that nuance on those issues,</p>
<p>like war in Ukraine, COVID,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be attacked by both sides.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>People who are really strongly on one side or the other</p>
<p>hate centrist people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten this myself.</p>
<p>And you know, the slur that I&rsquo;ve had thrown at me</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m an enlightened centrist in a very mocking way.</p>
<p>So what are they actually saying?</p>
<p>What does enlightened centrist mean?</p>
<p>It means someone who is, you know,</p>
<p>Steven Pinker or Jonathan Haidt gets accused of,</p>
<p>is, you know, that they&rsquo;re highfalutin,</p>
<p>you know, intellectual world.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t actually have any,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t actually take a side.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually get their hands dirty.</p>
<p>And they can be superior to both sides</p>
<p>without actually taking a stand, right?</p>
<p>So I see the argument and I disagree with it</p>
<p>because I firmly believe that the hardcore tribes,</p>
<p>they think they&rsquo;re taking a stand</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re out in the streets</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re pushing for something.</p>
<p>I think what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re just driving the whole country downwards.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re hurting all the causes they care about.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that we need everyone to be sitting there,</p>
<p>you know, refusing to take a side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that you can be far left and far right,</p>
<p>but be upper left and upper right.</p>
<p>If we talk about the,</p>
<p>you use the word liberal a lot in the book</p>
<p>to mean something that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>in modern political discourse mean.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this higher philosophical view.</p>
<p>And then you use the words progressive to mean the left</p>
<p>and conservative to mean the right.</p>
<p>Can you describe the concept of liberal games</p>
<p>and power games?</p>
<p>So the power games is what I call the like,</p>
<p>basically just the laws of nature as the,</p>
<p>when laws of nature are the laws of the land,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the power game.</p>
<p>So animals, watch any David Attenborough special.</p>
<p>And when the little lizard is running away</p>
<p>from the, you know, the bigger animal or whatever,</p>
<p>I use an example of a bunny and a bear.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if bears eat bunnies.</p>
<p>They probably don&rsquo;t, but pretend bears eat bunnies, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like in the power games,</p>
<p>the bear is chasing the bunny.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fairness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, okay, well, what&rsquo;s right?</p>
<p>What, you know, what, what, what, what, what&rsquo;s legal?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>If the bear is fast enough, it can eat the bunny.</p>
<p>If the bunny is, can get away, it can stay living.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only rule.</p>
<p>Now, humans have spent a lot of time</p>
<p>in essentially that environment.</p>
<p>So when you have a totalitarian dictatorship,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, and so what&rsquo;s the rule of the power games?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everyone can do whatever they want</p>
<p>if they have the power to do so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a game of power.</p>
<p>So if the bunny gets away,</p>
<p>the bunny actually has more power</p>
<p>than the bear in that situation, right?</p>
<p>And likewise, the totalitarian dictatorship,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no rules.</p>
<p>A dictator can do whatever they want.</p>
<p>They can torture.</p>
<p>They can, you know, flatten a rebellion</p>
<p>with a lot of murder because they have the power to do so.</p>
<p>What are you gonna do, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s kind of the state of nature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our natural way.</p>
<p>You know, when you look at, watch a mafia movie,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s, we do a lot of, we have it in us.</p>
<p>We all have, we all can snap into power games mode</p>
<p>when it becomes all about, you know,</p>
<p>just actual raw power.</p>
<p>Now, the liberal games is, you know,</p>
<p>something that civilizations for thousands of years</p>
<p>have been working on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not invented by America or modern times,</p>
<p>but America&rsquo;s kind of was like the latest crack at it yet,</p>
<p>which is this idea,</p>
<p>instead of everyone can do what they want</p>
<p>if they have the power to do so,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everyone can do what they want</p>
<p>as long as it doesn&rsquo;t harm anyone else.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s really complicated.</p>
<p>How do you define harm?</p>
<p>And the idea is that everyone has a list of rights</p>
<p>which are protected by the government.</p>
<p>And then they have, they&rsquo;re inalienable rights</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re protected.</p>
<p>Those are protected, again, by, you know,</p>
<p>from an invasion by other people.</p>
<p>And so you have this kind of fragile balance.</p>
<p>And so the idea with the liberal games is you,</p>
<p>that there are laws, but it&rsquo;s not totalitarian.</p>
<p>They will build very clear, strict laws</p>
<p>kind of around the edges of what you can and can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>And then everything else, freedom.</p>
<p>So unlike a totalitarian dictatorship,</p>
<p>actually it&rsquo;s very loose.</p>
<p>You can, there&rsquo;s a lot of things can happen</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of up to the people,</p>
<p>but there are still laws that protect</p>
<p>the very basic inalienable rights and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this much looser thing.</p>
<p>Now, the vulnerability there is that it,</p>
<p>so the benefits of it are obvious, right?</p>
<p>Freedom is great.</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s the most fair.</p>
<p>They, you know, that equality of opportunity</p>
<p>seemed like the most fair thing.</p>
<p>And, you know, equality before the law,</p>
<p>you know, due process and all of this stuff.</p>
<p>So it seems fair to the founders of the US</p>
<p>and other enlightenment thinkers.</p>
<p>And it also is a great way to manifest productivity, right?</p>
<p>You know, you have Adam Smith saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not from the benevolence of the butcher or the baker</p>
<p>that we get our dinner, but from their own self-interest.</p>
<p>So you have, you can harness kind of selfishness</p>
<p>for progress, but it has a vulnerability,</p>
<p>which is that because the laws,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the totalitarian laws,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have an excess of laws for no reason.</p>
<p>They want to control everything.</p>
<p>And the US, you know, in the US we say,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to do that.</p>
<p>So the second, it&rsquo;s almost two puzzle pieces.</p>
<p>You have the laws, and then you&rsquo;ve got a liberal culture.</p>
<p>Liberal laws have to be married to liberal culture,</p>
<p>kind of a defense of liberal spirit</p>
<p>in order to truly have the liberal games going on.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s vulnerable because free speech,</p>
<p>you can have the first amendment, that&rsquo;s the laws part.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re in a culture where anyone who, you know,</p>
<p>speaks out against orthodoxy</p>
<p>is going to be shunned from the community,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re lacking the second piece of the puzzle there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re lacking liberal culture.</p>
<p>And so therefore you might as well be in a,</p>
<p>you might as well not even have the first amendment.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of examples like that</p>
<p>where the culture has to do its part</p>
<p>for the true liberal games to be enjoyed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just much more complicated,</p>
<p>much more nuanced than the power games.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a set of basic laws</p>
<p>that then are coupled with a basic spirit</p>
<p>to create this very awesome human environment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also very vulnerable.</p>
<p>So what do you mean the culture has to play along?</p>
<p>So for something like a freedom of speech to work,</p>
<p>there has to be a basic, what, decency?</p>
<p>That if all people are perfectly good,</p>
<p>then perfect freedom without any restrictions is great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where the human nature starts getting a little iffy.</p>
<p>We start being cruel to each other,</p>
<p>we start being greedy and desiring of harm,</p>
<p>and also the narcissists and sociopaths</p>
<p>and psychopaths in society.</p>
<p>All of that, that&rsquo;s when you start to have to inject</p>
<p>some limitations on that freedom.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean if, so what the government basically says</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re going to let everyone be mostly free.</p>
<p>But no one is gonna be free to physically harm other people</p>
<p>or to steal their property, right?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re all agreeing to sacrifice that 20%</p>
<p>of our freedom, and then in return,</p>
<p>all of us in theory can be 80% free.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of the bargain.</p>
<p>But now that&rsquo;s a lot of freedom to leave people with.</p>
<p>And a lot of people choose,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re so free in the US,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually free to be unfree if you choose.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of what an echo chamber is to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you can choose to kind of be friends with people</p>
<p>who essentially make it so uncomfortable</p>
<p>to speak your mind that it&rsquo;s no actual effective difference</p>
<p>for you than if you lived in a country.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t criticize Christianity in a certain community,</p>
<p>that you have a First Amendment,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not gonna get arrested by the government</p>
<p>for criticizing Christianity.</p>
<p>But if you have this, if the social penalties</p>
<p>are so extreme that it&rsquo;s just never worth it,</p>
<p>you might as well be in a country</p>
<p>that imprisons people for criticizing Christianity.</p>
<p>And so that same thing goes for wokeness, right?</p>
<p>This is what people get, cancel culture and stuff.</p>
<p>So when the reason these things are bad</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re actually,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re depriving Americans of the beauty</p>
<p>of the freedom of the liberal games</p>
<p>by imposing a social culture that is very Power Games-esque.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a Power Games culture comes in,</p>
<p>and you might as well be in the Power Games now.</p>
<p>And so liberal, if you live in a liberal democracy,</p>
<p>there will always be challenges to a liberal culture,</p>
<p>lowercase l, liberal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll always be challenges to a liberal culture</p>
<p>from people who are much more interested</p>
<p>in playing the Power Games.</p>
<p>And there has to be kind of an immune system</p>
<p>that stands up to that culture and says,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not how we do things here in America, actually.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t excommunicate people</p>
<p>for not having the right religious beliefs or not,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t disinvite a speaker from campus</p>
<p>for having the wrong political beliefs.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t stand up for itself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the immune system of the country failing</p>
<p>and Power Games rushes in.</p>
<p>So before chapter four in your book,</p>
<p>and the chapters that will surely result</p>
<p>in you being burned at the stake,</p>
<p>you write, quote, we&rsquo;ll start our pitchfork tour</p>
<p>in this chapter by taking a brief trip</p>
<p>through the history of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Then in the following chapters,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll take a Tim&rsquo;s career tanking deep dive</p>
<p>into America&rsquo;s social justice movement</p>
<p>as you started to talk about.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the history of the Republican Party?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at this through my vertical ladder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, what is this familiar story</p>
<p>of the Republicans from the 60s to today?</p>
<p>What does it look like through the vertical lens, right?</p>
<p>Does it look different?</p>
<p>And is there an interesting story here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been kind of hidden</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re always looking at the horizontal.</p>
<p>Now the horizontal story, you&rsquo;ll hear people talk about it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll say something like the Republicans</p>
<p>have moved farther and farther to the right.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s not really true.</p>
<p>Like, was Trump more right-wing than Reagan?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s left.</p>
<p>In terms of actual policy, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;re using this.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s just like you&rsquo;re calling yourself centrist</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not exactly what you mean,</p>
<p>even though it also is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So again, I was like, okay, look,</p>
<p>this vertical lens helps with other things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s apply it to the Republicans.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what I saw is I looked at the 60s</p>
<p>and I saw an interesting story,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think not everyone&rsquo;s familiar</p>
<p>with what happened in the early 60s.</p>
<p>But in 1960, the Republican Party was very,</p>
<p>it was a plurality.</p>
<p>You had progressives, like genuine Rockefeller,</p>
<p>pretty progressive people,</p>
<p>all the way to, then you had the moderates</p>
<p>like Eisenhower and Dewey.</p>
<p>And then you go all the way to the farther right,</p>
<p>you had Goldwater and what we might call,</p>
<p>I call them the fundamentalists.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s this interesting plurality, right?</p>
<p>Something we don&rsquo;t have today.</p>
<p>And what happened was the Goldwater contingent,</p>
<p>which was the underdog, they were small, right?</p>
<p>Eisenhower was the president or had just been the president</p>
<p>and was, it seemed like the moderates were,</p>
<p>he said, you have to be close</p>
<p>to the center of the chessboard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you maintain power.</p>
<p>These people were very far</p>
<p>from the center of the chessboard,</p>
<p>but they ended up basically have like a hostile takeover.</p>
<p>They conquered their own party</p>
<p>and they did it by breaking all of the kind</p>
<p>of unwritten rules and norms.</p>
<p>So they did things like they first started</p>
<p>with like the college Republicans,</p>
<p>which was like this feeder group that turned in,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of the politicians started there</p>
<p>and they went to the election</p>
<p>and they wouldn&rsquo;t let the current president,</p>
<p>the incumbent, speak.</p>
<p>And they were throwing chairs and there were fistfights.</p>
<p>And eventually people gave up and they just sat there</p>
<p>and they sat in the chair talking for, you know,</p>
<p>their candidate until everyone eventually left</p>
<p>and then they declared victory.</p>
<p>So basically they came in,</p>
<p>there was a certain set of rules, agreed upon rules,</p>
<p>and they came in playing the power games saying,</p>
<p>well, actually, if we do this, you won&rsquo;t have the power,</p>
<p>you know, we have the power to take it</p>
<p>if we just break all the rules, right?</p>
<p>And so they did and they won.</p>
<p>And that became this hugely influential thing,</p>
<p>which then they conquered California through, again,</p>
<p>these people were taken aback,</p>
<p>these proper Republican candidates were appalled</p>
<p>by the kind of like, you know,</p>
<p>the insults that were being hurled at them</p>
<p>and the intimidation and the bullying.</p>
<p>And eventually they ended up in the National Convention,</p>
<p>which was called like the right wing Woodstock.</p>
<p>It was like, you know,</p>
<p>the Republican National Convention in 64 was just,</p>
<p>again, there was jeering and they wouldn&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>the moderates or the progressives even speak.</p>
<p>And there was racism, you know,</p>
<p>Jackie Robinson was there and he was a proud Republican.</p>
<p>And he said that like,</p>
<p>he feels like he was a Jew in Hitler&rsquo;s Germany</p>
<p>with the way that blacks were being treated there.</p>
<p>And it was nasty.</p>
<p>But what did they do?</p>
<p>They had fiery, you know, plurality enough to win.</p>
<p>And they won.</p>
<p>They ended up getting crushed in the general election</p>
<p>and they kind of faded away.</p>
<p>But to me, I was like, that was an interesting story.</p>
<p>I see it as, I have this character in the book</p>
<p>called the Golem, which is a big,</p>
<p>kind of a big, dumb, powerful monster.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the, you know,</p>
<p>the emergent property of like a political echo chamber.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this big giant, it&rsquo;s stupid,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s powerful and scary.</p>
<p>And to me, I was like, a Golem rose up,</p>
<p>conquered the party for a second,</p>
<p>knocked it on its ass and then faded away.</p>
<p>And to me, when I look at the Trump revolution</p>
<p>and a lot, and not just Trump, the last 20 years,</p>
<p>I see that same lower right,</p>
<p>that lower right monster kind of</p>
<p>making another charge for it, but this time succeeding</p>
<p>and really taking over the party for a long period of time.</p>
<p>I see the same story,</p>
<p>which is the power games are being played</p>
<p>in a situation when it had always been,</p>
<p>the government relies on all these unwritten rules</p>
<p>and norms to function.</p>
<p>But for example, you have in 2016,</p>
<p>Merrick Garland gets nominated by Obama</p>
<p>and the unwritten norm says</p>
<p>that when the president nominates a justice,</p>
<p>then you pass them through</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s some egregious thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what has happened.</p>
<p>But they said, actually, this is the last year</p>
<p>of his presidency and the people should choose.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should set a new precedent</p>
<p>where the president can&rsquo;t nominate people,</p>
<p>nominate a Supreme Court justice in the last year.</p>
<p>So they passed it through and it ends up being Gorsuch.</p>
<p>And so they lose that seat.</p>
<p>Now, three years later, it&rsquo;s Trump&rsquo;s last year</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s another election year and Ginsburg dies.</p>
<p>And what did they say?</p>
<p>They say, oh, let&rsquo;s keep our precedent.</p>
<p>They said, no, actually, we changed our mind.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna nominate Amy Barrett.</p>
<p>So to me, that is classic power games, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no actual rule and what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is they did technically have the power</p>
<p>to block the nomination then,</p>
<p>and then they technically had the power</p>
<p>to put someone in and they&rsquo;re pretending</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some principle to it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re going for the short-term edge</p>
<p>at the expense of what is like the workings</p>
<p>of the system in the long run.</p>
<p>And then what did the Democrats have to do</p>
<p>in that situation?</p>
<p>Because both parties have been doing this,</p>
<p>is they either can lose now all the time</p>
<p>or they start playing the power games too.</p>
<p>And now you have a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like both end up doing this thing</p>
<p>and everyone ends up worse off, the debt ceiling,</p>
<p>all these power plays that are being made</p>
<p>with these holding the country hostage.</p>
<p>This is power games.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s what Goldwater was doing in the 60s,</p>
<p>but it was a healthier time in a way</p>
<p>because there was this plurality within the parties,</p>
<p>reduced some of the national tribalism,</p>
<p>and there wasn&rsquo;t as much of an appeal to that.</p>
<p>But today, it&rsquo;s just like do whatever you have to do</p>
<p>to beat the enemies.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m seeing a rise in power games.</p>
<p>And I talk about the Republicans</p>
<p>because they did a lot of these things first.</p>
<p>They have been a little bit more egregious,</p>
<p>but both parties have been doing it</p>
<p>over the last 20, 30 years.</p>
<p>Can you place blame,</p>
<p>or maybe there&rsquo;s a different term for it,</p>
<p>at the subsystems of this?</p>
<p>So is it the media?</p>
<p>Is it the politicians, like in the Senate and Congress?</p>
<p>Is it Trump, so the leadership?</p>
<p>Is it, or maybe it&rsquo;s us, human beings?</p>
<p>Maybe social media versus mainstream media.</p>
<p>Is there a sense of where,</p>
<p>what is the cause and what is the symptom?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very complex.</p>
<p>So Ezra Klein has a great book, Why We&rsquo;re Polarized,</p>
<p>where he talks about a lot of this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some of these,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really no one&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>First of all, the environment has changed</p>
<p>in a bunch of ways you just mentioned.</p>
<p>And what happens when you take human nature,</p>
<p>which is a constant,</p>
<p>and you put it into an environment,</p>
<p>behavior comes out.</p>
<p>The environment&rsquo;s the independent variable.</p>
<p>When that changes, the dependent variable,</p>
<p>the behavior, changes with it, right?</p>
<p>And so the environment has changed in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>So one major one is,</p>
<p>it used to, for a long time, actually,</p>
<p>first it was the Republicans,</p>
<p>and then the Democrats just had a stranglehold on Congress.</p>
<p>There was no, it was not even competitive.</p>
<p>The Democrats, for 40 years, had the majority.</p>
<p>And so therefore, it actually is a decent environment</p>
<p>to compromise it, because now we can both,</p>
<p>you know, what you want is Congress people</p>
<p>thinking about their home district,</p>
<p>and voting yes on a national policy,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re gonna get a good deal on it back at home.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually healthy,</p>
<p>as opposed to voting in lockstep together,</p>
<p>because this is what the red party is doing,</p>
<p>regardless of what&rsquo;s good for my home district.</p>
<p>You know, an example is Obamacare.</p>
<p>You know, there were certain Republican districts</p>
<p>that would have actually, officially,</p>
<p>been benefited by Obamacare,</p>
<p>but every Republican voted against it.</p>
<p>So, and part of the reason is,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no longer this obvious majority.</p>
<p>Every few years, it switches.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 50-50 thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, partially because it&rsquo;s become,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve been so subsumed with this one national divide</p>
<p>of left versus right, that people are not,</p>
<p>people are whoever, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re voting for the same party for president,</p>
<p>all the way down the ticket now.</p>
<p>And so you have this just kind of 50-50 color war,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s awful for compromise.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like 10 of these things, you know,</p>
<p>that have redistricting, but also, it is social media.</p>
<p>It is, I call it hyper-charged tribalism.</p>
<p>You know, in the 60s,</p>
<p>you had kind of distributed tribalism.</p>
<p>You had some people that are worked up about the USSR,</p>
<p>right, they&rsquo;re national, that&rsquo;s what they care about.</p>
<p>US versus foreign.</p>
<p>You had some people that were saying left versus right,</p>
<p>like they are today.</p>
<p>And then other people that were saying</p>
<p>that they were fighting within the party.</p>
<p>But today, you don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>You have ideological realignment,</p>
<p>so you kind of got rid of a lot of the in-party fighting.</p>
<p>And then there hasn&rsquo;t been that big of a foreign threat,</p>
<p>nothing like the USSR for a long time.</p>
<p>So you kind of lost that,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s left is just this left versus right thing.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s kind of this hyper-charged whirlpool</p>
<p>that subsumes everything.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I mean, people point to Newt Gingrich,</p>
<p>you know, and people like there&rsquo;s certain characters</p>
<p>that enacted policies that stoked this kind of thing,</p>
<p>but I think this is a much bigger</p>
<p>kind of environmental shift.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s going back to our questions</p>
<p>about the role of individuals in human history.</p>
<p>So the interesting,</p>
<p>one of the many interesting questions here is about Trump.</p>
<p>Is he a symptom or a cause?</p>
<p>Because he seems to be, from the public narrative,</p>
<p>such a significant catalyst</p>
<p>for some of the things we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>This goes back to what we were talking about earlier,</p>
<p>right, like is it the person or is it the times?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s a perfect example of it&rsquo;s a both situation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, if you plucked Trump out of this situation,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that Trump was inevitable,</p>
<p>but I think we were very vulnerable to a demagogue.</p>
<p>And if you hadn&rsquo;t been, Trump would have had no chance.</p>
<p>And so why were we vulnerable to a demagogue</p>
<p>is because you have these,</p>
<p>well, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s specifically on the right.</p>
<p>If you actually look at the stats, it&rsquo;s pretty bad.</p>
<p>Like the people who,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just who voted for Trump.</p>
<p>A lot of people just vote for the red, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is who voted for Obama against Romney</p>
<p>and then voted for Trump?</p>
<p>Who, you know, these are not racists, right?</p>
<p>These are not hardcore Republicans.</p>
<p>They voted for Obama.</p>
<p>And where did the switch come from?</p>
<p>Places that had economic despair,</p>
<p>where bridges were not working well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a signifier.</p>
<p>You know, where paint&rsquo;s chipping in the schools.</p>
<p>You know, these little things like this.</p>
<p>So I think that, you know, you had this,</p>
<p>a lot of these kind of rural towns,</p>
<p>you have true despair.</p>
<p>And then you also have the number one indicator</p>
<p>of voting for Trump was distrust in media.</p>
<p>And the media has become much less trustworthy, you know?</p>
<p>And so you have all these ingredients</p>
<p>that actually make us very vulnerable to a demagogue</p>
<p>and a demagogue is someone who takes advantage, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s someone who comes in and says,</p>
<p>I can pull all the right strings</p>
<p>and push all the right emotional buttons right now</p>
<p>and get my self power by taking advantage</p>
<p>of the circumstances.</p>
<p>And that is what Trump totally did.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder how easy it is for somebody</p>
<p>who is a charismatic leader to capitalize</p>
<p>on cultural resentment when there&rsquo;s economic hardship</p>
<p>to channel that.</p>
<p>So John Haidt wrote a great article</p>
<p>about like, we basically,</p>
<p>like truth is in an all time low right now.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, the media is not penalized for lying, right?</p>
<p>MSNBC, Fox News, these are not penalized</p>
<p>for being inaccurate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re penalized if they stray from the orthodoxy.</p>
<p>On social media, it&rsquo;s not the truest tweets</p>
<p>that go viral, right?</p>
<p>And so Trump understood that better than anyone, right?</p>
<p>He took advantage of it.</p>
<p>He was living in the current world</p>
<p>when everyone else was stuck in the past.</p>
<p>And he saw that and he just lied.</p>
<p>He, everything he said, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>truth was not relevant at all, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just truly, it&rsquo;s not relevant to him</p>
<p>when what he&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t care and he knew that neither do</p>
<p>a subset of the country.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this,</p>
<p>just reading articles by journalists,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re not a famous journalist in yourself,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re more like in your times journalist.</p>
<p>So the big famous thing is the institution</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a part of.</p>
<p>Like, you can just lie.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re not going to get punished for it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be rewarded for the popularity</p>
<p>of an article.</p>
<p>So if you write 10 articles,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a huge incentive to just make stuff up.</p>
<p>You gotta get clicks.</p>
<p>To get clicks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first and foremost.</p>
<p>And like culturally, people will attack that article</p>
<p>to say it&rsquo;s dishonest, like one half the country</p>
<p>will attack that article for saying it&rsquo;s dishonest.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll kind of forget the,</p>
<p>you will not have a reputational hit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There won&rsquo;t be a memory like this person made up</p>
<p>a lot of stuff in the past.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;ll take one article at a time</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll attach the reputation hits</p>
<p>will be to New York Times, the institution.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so for the individual journalist,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge incentive to make stuff up.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wild.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s scary because it&rsquo;s almost like you can&rsquo;t survive</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just an old school honest journalist</p>
<p>who really works hard and tries to get it right</p>
<p>and does it with nuance.</p>
<p>What you can be is you can be a big time substacker</p>
<p>or a big time podcaster.</p>
<p>A lot of people do have a reputation for accuracy</p>
<p>and rigor and they have huge audiences.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re working in a big company right now,</p>
<p>I think that many of the big media brands</p>
<p>are very much controlled by the left.</p>
<p>But I will say that the ones that are controlled</p>
<p>by the right are even more egregious.</p>
<p>Not just in terms of accuracy,</p>
<p>but also in terms of,</p>
<p>the New York Times for all of its criticisms,</p>
<p>they have a handful of,</p>
<p>here and there they put out a pretty,</p>
<p>an article that strays from the,</p>
<p>Barry Weiss wrote there for a long time.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>they wrote an article criticizing free speech</p>
<p>on campus stuff recently.</p>
<p>And they have a couple very left progressive friendly</p>
<p>conservatives, but they have conservatives</p>
<p>that are writing the op-eds.</p>
<p>Fox News, you&rsquo;re not seeing thoughtful,</p>
<p>Breitbart, you&rsquo;re not seeing thoughtful</p>
<p>progressives writing there, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some degree to which the New York Times,</p>
<p>I think still incentivizing the values,</p>
<p>the vertical, the high effort.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re allowed to have a conservative opinion</p>
<p>if you do a really damn good job.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s a very thorough, in-depth kind of-</p>
<p>And if you kind of pander to the progressive senses</p>
<p>in all the right ways.</p>
<p>I always joke that Ted,</p>
<p>they always have a couple token conservatives,</p>
<p>but they get on stage and they&rsquo;re basically like,</p>
<p>so totally, the progressivism&rsquo;s right about all of this,</p>
<p>but maybe, maybe libertarianism isn&rsquo;t all bad.</p>
<p>So there is an element, but you know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better than being a total tribal.</p>
<p>I think you can see the New York Times tug of war,</p>
<p>the internal tug of war.</p>
<p>You can see it,</p>
<p>because then they also have these awful instances,</p>
<p>or like the firing of James Bennett,</p>
<p>which is this whole other story.</p>
<p>But they have, yeah, you can see it going both ways.</p>
<p>But in the 60s, what did you have?</p>
<p>You had ABC, NBC, CBS.</p>
<p>The 70s, you had these three news channels</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t always right.</p>
<p>And they definitely sometimes spun a narrative together,</p>
<p>maybe about the Vietnam or whatever.</p>
<p>But if one of them was just lying,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be embarrassed for it.</p>
<p>They would be penalized.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be dinged and they&rsquo;d be known as,</p>
<p>this is the trash one.</p>
<p>And that would be terrible for their ratings,</p>
<p>because they weren&rsquo;t just catering to half the country.</p>
<p>They all were catering to the whole country.</p>
<p>So both on the axis of accuracy</p>
<p>and on the axis of neutrality,</p>
<p>they had to try to stay somewhere in the reasonable range.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just gone.</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;m really curious about</p>
<p>is I think your book is incredible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very curious to see how it&rsquo;s written about by the press.</p>
<p>Because I could see, I could myself write</p>
<p>with the help of Chad JPT, of course,</p>
<p>clickbait articles in either direction.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine.</p>
<p>Your whole book is beautifully written</p>
<p>for clickbait articles.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If any journalists out there need help,</p>
<p>I can help.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can write the most atrocious criticisms.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m ready, I&rsquo;m braced.</p>
<p>Yeah, so speaking of which,</p>
<p>you write about social justice.</p>
<p>You write about two kinds of social justice,</p>
<p>liberal social justice and SJF,</p>
<p>social justice fundamentalism.</p>
<p>What are those?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the term wokeness is so loaded with baggage,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like mocking and derogatory.</p>
<p>And I was trying not to do that in this book.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a term loaded with baggage,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already kind of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from the first minute, you&rsquo;re already behind.</p>
<p>So to me,</p>
<p>it also, when people say wokeness is bad,</p>
<p>social justice is bad,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
<p>Because the proudest tradition in the US</p>
<p>is liberal social justice.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that, again,</p>
<p>liberal meaning with lowercase L.</p>
<p>It is intertwined with liberalism.</p>
<p>So Martin Luther King, classic example,</p>
<p>his I Have a Dream speech,</p>
<p>he says stuff like,</p>
<p>this country has made a promise to all of its citizens,</p>
<p>and it has broken that promise to its black citizens.</p>
<p>In other words, liberalism, the constitution,</p>
<p>the core ideals, those are great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not living up to them, we&rsquo;re failing on some of them.</p>
<p>So civil disobedience,</p>
<p>the goal of it wasn&rsquo;t to hurt liberalism,</p>
<p>it was to specifically break the laws</p>
<p>that were already violating,</p>
<p>the laws that were a violation of liberalism,</p>
<p>to expose that this is illiberal,</p>
<p>that the constitution should not have people</p>
<p>of different skin color sitting</p>
<p>in different parts of the bus.</p>
<p>And so it was really patriotic, the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>It was saying, this is a beautiful,</p>
<p>we have a, liberalism is this beautiful thing,</p>
<p>and we need to do better at it.</p>
<p>So I call it liberal social justice,</p>
<p>and it used the tools of liberalism</p>
<p>to try to improve the flaws.</p>
<p>And they were going on, so free speech.</p>
<p>Mario Savio in the 60s was, he&rsquo;s a leftist.</p>
<p>And what were the leftists doing</p>
<p>in the 60s on Berkeley campus?</p>
<p>They were saying, we need more free speech,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what liberal social justice</p>
<p>was fighting for.</p>
<p>But you can also go back to the 20s, women&rsquo;s suffrage.</p>
<p>I mean, emancipation, the thing that America</p>
<p>obviously has all of its, these are all ugly things</p>
<p>that it had to get out of, but it got out of them,</p>
<p>one by one, and it&rsquo;s still getting out of them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s cool about America.</p>
<p>And liberal social justice basically is the practice</p>
<p>of saying, where are we not being perfect liberals?</p>
<p>And now let&rsquo;s fix that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the idea of liberalism</p>
<p>that permeates the history of the United States.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s, so many good images in this book.</p>
<p>But one of them is highlighting the interplay</p>
<p>of different ideas over the past, let&rsquo;s say 100 years.</p>
<p>So liberalism is on one side, there&rsquo;s that thread.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Marxism on the other,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s postmodernism.</p>
<p>How do those interplay together?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting because Marxism is,</p>
<p>and all of its various descendants,</p>
<p>obviously there&rsquo;s a lot of things that are rooted</p>
<p>in Marxism that aren&rsquo;t the same thing</p>
<p>as what Karl Marx preached.</p>
<p>But what do they all have in common?</p>
<p>They think liberalism is bad, right?</p>
<p>They actually think that the opposite</p>
<p>of what Martin Luther King and other people</p>
<p>in the civil rights and other movements,</p>
<p>they think the opposite.</p>
<p>He thinks liberalism is good, we need to preserve it.</p>
<p>They said liberalism is the problem.</p>
<p>These other problems with racism and inequality</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re seeing, those are inevitable results</p>
<p>of liberalism.</p>
<p>Liberalism is a rigged game,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just the power games in disguise.</p>
<p>There is no liberal games.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the power games in disguise,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the upper people that oppress the lower people,</p>
<p>and they convince the lower people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about false consciousness.</p>
<p>They convince the lower people that everything is fair,</p>
<p>and now the lower people vote against their own interests,</p>
<p>and they work to preserve the system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s oppressing them.</p>
<p>And what do we need to do?</p>
<p>We need to actually, it&rsquo;s much more revolutionary.</p>
<p>We need to overthrow liberalism, right?</p>
<p>So people think, oh, what we call a wokeness</p>
<p>is just a normal social justice activism,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more extreme, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this, no, no, it&rsquo;s the polar opposite, polar opposite.</p>
<p>And so now that&rsquo;s the Marxist threat.</p>
<p>Now, postmodernism is kind of this term</p>
<p>that is super controversial,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think anyone calls themselves a postmodernist</p>
<p>or take all of this with a grain of salt</p>
<p>in terms of the term,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s the definition of radical?</p>
<p>The definition of radical to me is</p>
<p>how deep you want change to happen at.</p>
<p>So a liberal progressive and a conservative progressive</p>
<p>will disagree about policies.</p>
<p>The liberal progressive wants to change a lot of policies,</p>
<p>change, change, change, right?</p>
<p>And the conservative is more wants to keep things</p>
<p>the way they are.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re both conservative when it comes to liberalism,</p>
<p>beneath it, the liberal kind of foundation of the country.</p>
<p>They both become conservatives about that.</p>
<p>The Marxist is more radical</p>
<p>because they want to go one notch deeper</p>
<p>and actually overthrow that foundation.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s below liberalism</p>
<p>is kind of the core tenets of modernity,</p>
<p>this idea of reason and the notion</p>
<p>that there is an objective truth</p>
<p>and science as the scientific method, right?</p>
<p>These things are actually beneath, and even the Marxist,</p>
<p>if you look at the Frankfurt School,</p>
<p>you know, these post-Marxist thinkers and Marx himself,</p>
<p>they were not anti-science.</p>
<p>They believed in that bottom-bottom foundation.</p>
<p>They actually wanted to preserve modernity,</p>
<p>but they wanted to get rid of liberalism on top of it.</p>
<p>The post-modernist is even more radical</p>
<p>because they want to actually go down</p>
<p>to the bottom level and overthrow it.</p>
<p>They think science itself is a tool of oppression.</p>
<p>They think it&rsquo;s a tool</p>
<p>where oppression kind of flows through.</p>
<p>They think that the white Western world</p>
<p>has invented these concepts,</p>
<p>like they claim that there&rsquo;s an objective truth</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s reason and science,</p>
<p>and they think all of that is just one metanarrative,</p>
<p>and it goes a long way</p>
<p>to serve the interests of the powerful.</p>
<p>So in the sense that it&rsquo;s almost caricatured,</p>
<p>but that is to the core of their belief</p>
<p>that math could be racist, for example.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Not the education of math, but literally math, mathematics.</p>
<p>The notion in math</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a right answer and a wrong answer.</p>
<p>That, they believe, is a metanarrative</p>
<p>that serves white supremacy,</p>
<p>or the post-modernist might have said</p>
<p>it serves just the powerful or the wealthy,</p>
<p>so what social justice fundamentalism is,</p>
<p>is you take the Marxist thread</p>
<p>that has been going on in lots of countries,</p>
<p>and whoever the upper and lower is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they all have in common,</p>
<p>but the upper and lower,</p>
<p>for Marx was the ruling class and the oppressed class.</p>
<p>It was economic.</p>
<p>But you come here,</p>
<p>and the economic class doesn&rsquo;t resonate as much here</p>
<p>as it did maybe in some of those other places,</p>
<p>but what does resonate here in the 60s and 70s</p>
<p>is race and gender</p>
<p>and these kind of social justice disagreements.</p>
<p>And so what social justice fundamentalism is,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s basically this tried-and-true framework</p>
<p>of this Marxist framework,</p>
<p>kind of with a new skin on it,</p>
<p>which is American social justice,</p>
<p>and then made even more radical</p>
<p>with the infusion of post-modernism,</p>
<p>where not just is liberalism bad,</p>
<p>but actually, like you said, math can be racist.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this kind of philosophical Frankenstein,</p>
<p>this stitched together of these,</p>
<p>and so again, it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>they wear the same uniform as the liberal social justice.</p>
<p>They say social justice, racial equality,</p>
<p>but it has nothing to do with liberal social justice.</p>
<p>It is directly opposed to liberal social justice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating, the evolution of ideas.</p>
<p>If we ignore the harm done by it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating how humans get together</p>
<p>and evolve these ideas.</p>
<p>So as you show, Marxism is the idea</p>
<p>that society is a zero-sum.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess zero-sum is a really important thing here.</p>
<p>Zero-sum struggle between the ruling class</p>
<p>and the working class,</p>
<p>with power being exerted through politics and economics.</p>
<p>Then you add critical theory, Marxism 2.0 on top of that,</p>
<p>and you add to politics and economics,</p>
<p>you add culture and institutions.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, for post-modernism,</p>
<p>you add science, you add morality,</p>
<p>basically anything else you can think of.</p>
<p>To stitch together Frankenstein,</p>
<p>and if you notice, and which is not necessarily bad,</p>
<p>but in this case, I think it&rsquo;s actually violating</p>
<p>the Marxist tradition by being anti-science.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s violating the post-modernism,</p>
<p>because what post-modernists were,</p>
<p>they were radical skeptics.</p>
<p>Not just of, they were radical skeptics,</p>
<p>not just of the way things were, but of their own beliefs.</p>
<p>And social justice fundamentalism is suddenly,</p>
<p>is not at all self-critical.</p>
<p>It says that we have the answers,</p>
<p>which is the opposite of what post-modernists</p>
<p>would ever say.</p>
<p>No, you just have another meta-narrative.</p>
<p>So, and it&rsquo;s also violating, of course,</p>
<p>the tradition of liberal social justice in a million ways,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s anti-liberal.</p>
<p>And so this Frankenstein comes together.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, liberal social justice</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a Frankenstein.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear, it&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a crisp ideology that says we need,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to make,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to get to a more perfect union.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to keep the promises</p>
<p>made in the Constitution.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s trying to do.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s much simpler in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>So you write that my big problem</p>
<p>with social justice fundamentalism</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t the ideology itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what scholars and activists started to do</p>
<p>sometimes around 2013,</p>
<p>when they began to wield a cudgel</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not supposed to have any place</p>
<p>in the country like the US.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the actions, not the ideas.</p>
<p>Well, to be clear, I don&rsquo;t like the ideology.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a low-rung ideology.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s morally inconsistent</p>
<p>based on its flip-flops on its morals,</p>
<p>depending on the group.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s echo chambery.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s full of inaccuracies</p>
<p>and kind of can&rsquo;t stand up to debate.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a low,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a ton of low-rung ideologies I don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like a lot of religious doctrines.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like a lot of political doctrines, right?</p>
<p>The US is a place inherently</p>
<p>that is a mishmash of a ton of ideologies.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna like two thirds of them</p>
<p>at any given time.</p>
<p>So my problem, the reason I&rsquo;m writing about this</p>
<p>is not because I&rsquo;m like, by the way,</p>
<p>this ideology is not something I like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not interesting.</p>
<p>The reason that it must be written about right now,</p>
<p>this particular ideology,</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s not playing nicely with others.</p>
<p>But if you wanna be a hardcore evangelical Christian,</p>
<p>in the US says live and let live.</p>
<p>Not only are you allowed to have an echo chamber</p>
<p>of some kind, it&rsquo;s actively protected here.</p>
<p>Live and let live.</p>
<p>They can do what they want.</p>
<p>Now, if the evangelical Christian started saying,</p>
<p>by the way, anyone who says anything</p>
<p>that conflicts with evangelical Christianity</p>
<p>is going to be severely socially punished</p>
<p>and they have the cultural power to do so,</p>
<p>which they don&rsquo;t in this case.</p>
<p>They might like to, but they don&rsquo;t have the power.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re able to get anyone fired who they want.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re able to actually change the curriculum</p>
<p>in all these schools to suddenly not conflict</p>
<p>with no more evolution in the textbooks</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>Now I would write a book about evangelical Christianity</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what every liberal,</p>
<p>regardless of what you think</p>
<p>of the actual horizontal beliefs,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter what they believe</p>
<p>when they start violating live and let live</p>
<p>and shutting down other segments of society.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like a, it&rsquo;s not the best analogy,</p>
<p>but an echo chamber is like a benign tumor.</p>
<p>And what you have to watch out for</p>
<p>is a tumor that starts to metastasize,</p>
<p>starts to forcefully spread and damage the tissue around it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what this particular ideology has been doing.</p>
<p>Do you worry about it, you know,</p>
<p>as an existential threat to liberalism</p>
<p>in the West, in the United States?</p>
<p>Is it a problem or is it the biggest problem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s threatening all of human civilization?</p>
<p>I would never, I would not say it&rsquo;s the biggest problem.</p>
<p>It might be.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t, if someone, if it turns out in 50 years</p>
<p>someone says actually it was, I wouldn&rsquo;t be shocked.</p>
<p>But I also, I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of problems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>It is popular to say that kind of thing though.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s less popular to say the same thing</p>
<p>about AI or nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>which worries me that I&rsquo;m more worried</p>
<p>about nuclear weapons even still</p>
<p>than I am about wokeism.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve gotten, I&rsquo;ve had probably</p>
<p>a thousand arguments about this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one nice thing about spending six years</p>
<p>procrastinating on getting a book done</p>
<p>is you end up test, battle testing your ideas</p>
<p>a million times.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve heard this one a lot, right?</p>
<p>Which is, there&rsquo;s kind of three groups</p>
<p>of former Obama voters.</p>
<p>One is super woke now.</p>
<p>Another one is super anti-woke now.</p>
<p>And the third is what you just said,</p>
<p>which is sure, wokeness is over the top, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re not woke,</p>
<p>but I think that the anti-woke people</p>
<p>are totally lost their mind.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just not that big a deal, right?</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s why I disagree with that.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not wokeness itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that a radical political movement,</p>
<p>of which there will always be a lot in the country,</p>
<p>has managed to do something that a radical movement</p>
<p>is not supposed to be able to do in the US.</p>
<p>Which is they&rsquo;ve managed to</p>
<p>hijack institutions all across the country,</p>
<p>and hijack medical journals, and universities,</p>
<p>and the ACLU, all the activist organizations,</p>
<p>and nonprofits, and NGOs.</p>
<p>And certain tech companies.</p>
<p>Yeah, and many tech companies.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not that I think this thing is so bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little like we said with Trump.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that, the reason Trump scares me</p>
<p>is not because Trump&rsquo;s so bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that because it shows,</p>
<p>it reveals that we were vulnerable to a demagogue candidate.</p>
<p>And what wokeness reveals to me is that we are currently,</p>
<p>and until something changes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll continue to be vulnerable to a bully movement,</p>
<p>and a forcefully expansionist movement</p>
<p>that wants to actually destroy the working class</p>
<p>in their liberal gears and tear them apart.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s the way I view a liberal democracy</p>
<p>is it is a bunch of these institutions</p>
<p>that were trial and error crafted over hundreds of years.</p>
<p>And they all rely on trust, public trust.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain kind of feeling of unity</p>
<p>that actually is critical</p>
<p>to a liberal democracy&rsquo;s functioning.</p>
<p>And what I see this thing is, is as a parasite on that,</p>
<p>that whose goal is, and I&rsquo;m not saying each,</p>
<p>each individual in this is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re bad people.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s the ideology itself has the property of,</p>
<p>its goal is to tear apart the pretty delicate workings</p>
<p>of the liberal democracy</p>
<p>and shred the critical lines of trust.</p>
<p>And so you talk about AI,</p>
<p>and you talk about all these other big problems,</p>
<p>nuclear, right?</p>
<p>The reason I, I like writing about that stuff</p>
<p>a lot more than I like writing about politics.</p>
<p>This was a fun topic for me,</p>
<p>is because I realized that all of those things,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re gonna have a good future with those things,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually threats,</p>
<p>like I said, we need to have our wits about us.</p>
<p>And we need the liberal gears and levers working.</p>
<p>We need the liberal machine working.</p>
<p>And so if something&rsquo;s threatening to undermine that,</p>
<p>it affects everything else.</p>
<p>We need to have our scientific mind about us,</p>
<p>about these foundational ideas.</p>
<p>But I guess my sense of hope comes from</p>
<p>observing the immune system respond to wokeism.</p>
<p>There seems to be a pro-liberalism immune system.</p>
<p>And not only that, so like there&rsquo;s intellectuals,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that are willing to do the fight.</p>
<p>You talk about courage, or being courageous.</p>
<p>And there is a hunger for that,</p>
<p>such that those ideas can become viral,</p>
<p>and they take over.</p>
<p>So I just don&rsquo;t see a mechanism by which wokeism</p>
<p>accelerates like exponentially,</p>
<p>and takes over, like it&rsquo;s expand.</p>
<p>It feels like as it expands, the immune system responds.</p>
<p>The immune system of liberalism,</p>
<p>of basically a country, at least in the United States,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s still ultimately at the core of the individual values</p>
<p>the freedom of speech, just freedoms in general.</p>
<p>The freedom of an individual.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the battle, which is stronger.</p>
<p>So to me it is like a virus in an immune system.</p>
<p>And I totally agree, I see the same story happening.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sitting here rooting for the immune system.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re still worried.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>So a liberal democracy is always gonna be vulnerable</p>
<p>to a movement like this, right?</p>
<p>And there will be more.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not a totalitarian dictatorship.</p>
<p>Because if you can socially pressure people</p>
<p>to not say what they&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>you can suddenly start to just take over, right?</p>
<p>You can break the liberalism of the liberal democracy</p>
<p>quite easily, and suddenly a lot of things are illiberal.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the same vulnerability,</p>
<p>the same system that&rsquo;s vulnerable to that,</p>
<p>also is hard to truly conquer.</p>
<p>Because now the Maoists, right, similar kind of vibe.</p>
<p>They were saying that science is evil,</p>
<p>and that the intellectuals are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all this big conspiracy.</p>
<p>But they could murder you.</p>
<p>And they had the hard cudgel in their hand, right?</p>
<p>And the hard cudgel is scary.</p>
<p>And you can conquer a country with the hard cudgel.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t use that in the US.</p>
<p>So what they have is a soft cudgel,</p>
<p>which can have the same effect initially.</p>
<p>You can scare people into shutting up.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t maybe imprison them and murder them.</p>
<p>But if you can socially ostracize them and get them fired,</p>
<p>that basically is gonna have the same effect.</p>
<p>So the soft cudgel can have the same effect for a while.</p>
<p>But the thing is, it&rsquo;s a little bit of a house of cards.</p>
<p>Because it relies on fear.</p>
<p>And as soon as that fear goes away,</p>
<p>the whole thing falls apart, right?</p>
<p>The soft cudgel requires people to be so scared</p>
<p>of getting canceled or getting whatever.</p>
<p>And as soon as some people start,</p>
<p>you know, Toby Lutka of Shopify, I always think about.</p>
<p>He just said, you know what,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not scared of this soft cudgel.</p>
<p>And spoke up and said, we&rsquo;re not political at this company,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not a family, we&rsquo;re a team,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna do this.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>Like, they&rsquo;re thriving.</p>
<p>He will be on this podcast.</p>
<p>He seems like a fascinating human being.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>He spoke up, he&rsquo;s saying that we&rsquo;re not going to.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the smartest and kindest dudes.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s also, he has courage at a time when it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing, is that it&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>than that you need so much less courage</p>
<p>against a soft cudgel than you do.</p>
<p>The Iranians throwing their hijabs into the fire,</p>
<p>those people&rsquo;s courage just blows away</p>
<p>any courage we have here.</p>
<p>Because they might get executed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing, is that you can actually</p>
<p>have courage right now, and it&rsquo;s, so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I understand.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>Oh man, the irony of that.</p>
<p>And you talk about, so two things to fight this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things, awareness and courage.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the awareness piece?</p>
<p>The awareness piece is,</p>
<p>is first just understanding the stakes.</p>
<p>Like, getting our heads out of the sand</p>
<p>and being like, technology&rsquo;s blowing up exponentially.</p>
<p>Our society&rsquo;s trust is devolving.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re kind of falling apart in some important ways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re losing our grip on some stability at the worst time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first point, just the big picture.</p>
<p>And then also, awareness of, I think, this vertical axis</p>
<p>or whatever your version of it is.</p>
<p>This concept of, how do I really form my beliefs?</p>
<p>Where do they actually come from?</p>
<p>Are they someone else&rsquo;s beliefs?</p>
<p>Am I following a checklist?</p>
<p>How about my values?</p>
<p>I used to identify with the blue party or the red party,</p>
<p>but now they&rsquo;ve changed, and I suddenly am okay with that.</p>
<p>Is that because my values changed with it,</p>
<p>or am I actually anchored to the party,</p>
<p>not to any principle?</p>
<p>Asking yourself these questions.</p>
<p>Asking, looking for where do I feel disgusted</p>
<p>by fellow human beings?</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m being a crazy tribal person</p>
<p>without realizing it.</p>
<p>How about the people around me?</p>
<p>Am I being bullied by some echo chamber without realizing it?</p>
<p>Am I the bully somewhere?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first, I think, just to kind of</p>
<p>do a self-audit.</p>
<p>And I think that just some awareness like that,</p>
<p>just a self-audit about these things can go a long way,</p>
<p>but if you keep it to yourself, it&rsquo;s almost useless.</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>awareness without courage does very little.</p>
<p>So courage is when you take that awareness</p>
<p>and you actually export it out into the world,</p>
<p>and it starts affecting other people.</p>
<p>And so courage can happen on multiple levels.</p>
<p>It can happen by, first of all,</p>
<p>just stop saying stuff you don&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re being pressured by a kind of an ideology</p>
<p>or a movement to say stuff that you don&rsquo;t actually believe,</p>
<p>just stop, just stay on your ground and don&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s courage, that&rsquo;s one first step.</p>
<p>Start speaking out in small groups.</p>
<p>Start actually speaking your mind, see what happens.</p>
<p>The sky doesn&rsquo;t usually fall.</p>
<p>Actually, people usually respect you for it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not every group, but you&rsquo;d be surprised.</p>
<p>And then eventually, maybe start speaking out</p>
<p>in bigger groups, start going public.</p>
<p>Go public with it, and you don&rsquo;t need everyone doing this.</p>
<p>Look, some people will lose their jobs for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking to those people.</p>
<p>Most people won&rsquo;t lose their jobs,</p>
<p>but they have the same fear as if they would, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what, are you gonna get criticized,</p>
<p>or are you gonna get a bunch of people,</p>
<p>angry Twitter people will criticize you?</p>
<p>Like, yeah, it&rsquo;s not pleasant,</p>
<p>but actually that&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>like our primitive mind&rsquo;s fear that really,</p>
<p>back when it was programmed, that kind of ostracism</p>
<p>or criticism will leave you out of the tribe and you&rsquo;ll die.</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s kind of a delusional fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not actually that scary.</p>
<p>And the people who realize that</p>
<p>can exercise incredible leadership right now.</p>
<p>So you have a really interesting description of censorship,</p>
<p>of self-censorship also, as you&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s King Mustache?</p>
<p>And this gap, I think, I hope you write even more,</p>
<p>even more than you&rsquo;ve written in the book</p>
<p>about these ideas, because it&rsquo;s so strong.</p>
<p>This censorship gaps that are created</p>
<p>between the dormant thought pile</p>
<p>and the kind of thing under the speech curve.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So first of all, so I like to think of,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a useful tool,</p>
<p>is this thing called a thought pile,</p>
<p>which is if you have a, on any given issue,</p>
<p>you have a horizontal spectrum,</p>
<p>and just say I could take your brain out of your head</p>
<p>and I put it on the thought pile</p>
<p>right where you happen to believe about that issue.</p>
<p>Now, I did that for everyone in the community</p>
<p>or in a society, and you&rsquo;re gonna end up</p>
<p>with a big mushy pile that I think</p>
<p>will often form a bell curve.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s really politicized,</p>
<p>it might form like a camel with two humps,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like concentrated here.</p>
<p>But for a typical issue, it&rsquo;ll just form a fear of AI.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have a bell curve, right?</p>
<p>Things like this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thought pile.</p>
<p>Now, the second thing is a line</p>
<p>that I call the speech curve,</p>
<p>which is what people are saying.</p>
<p>So the speech curve is high</p>
<p>when not just a lot of people are saying it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s being said from the biggest platforms,</p>
<p>being said in the New York Times,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s being said by the president</p>
<p>on the State of the Union.</p>
<p>Those things are the top of the speech curve.</p>
<p>Now, and then when the speech curve&rsquo;s lower,</p>
<p>it means it&rsquo;s being said either whispered in small groups,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just not very many people are talking about it.</p>
<p>Now, when a free speech democracy</p>
<p>is healthy on a certain topic,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the speech curve sitting</p>
<p>right on top of the thought pile.</p>
<p>They mirror each other,</p>
<p>which is naturally what would happen.</p>
<p>More people think something that&rsquo;s gonna be said</p>
<p>more often and from higher platforms.</p>
<p>What censorship does,</p>
<p>and censorship can be from the government,</p>
<p>so I use the tale of King Mustache,</p>
<p>and King Mustache, he&rsquo;s a little tiny tyrant,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s very sensitive,</p>
<p>and people are making fun of his mustache,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re saying he&rsquo;s not a good king,</p>
<p>and he does not like that.</p>
<p>So what does he do?</p>
<p>He enacts a policy, and he says,</p>
<p>anyone who is heard criticizing me or my mustache</p>
<p>or my rule will be put to death.</p>
<p>And immediately at the town,</p>
<p>it was because his father was very liberal.</p>
<p>It was always free speech in his kingdom.</p>
<p>But now King Mustache has taken over,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s saying this is a new rules now,</p>
<p>and so a few people yell out,</p>
<p>and they say, that&rsquo;s not how we do things here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I call a moment of truth.</p>
<p>Did the king&rsquo;s guards stand with the principles</p>
<p>of the kingdom and say, yeah, King Mustache,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what we do,</p>
<p>in which case he would kind of have to,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s nothing he can do.</p>
<p>Or are they going to execute?</p>
<p>So in this case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as if he laid down an electric fence</p>
<p>over a part of the stockpile and said,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s allowed to speak over here.</p>
<p>The speech curve, maybe people will think these things,</p>
<p>but the speech curve cannot go over here.</p>
<p>But the electric fence wasn&rsquo;t actually electrified</p>
<p>until the king&rsquo;s guards, in a moment of truth,</p>
<p>get scared and say, okay,</p>
<p>and they hang the five people who spoke out.</p>
<p>So in that moment, that fence just became electric.</p>
<p>And now no one criticizes King Mustache anymore.</p>
<p>So I use this as an allegory.</p>
<p>Now, of course, he has a hard cudgel</p>
<p>because he can execute people.</p>
<p>But now when we look at the US,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re seeing right now is a lot of pressure,</p>
<p>which is very similar.</p>
<p>An electric fence is being laid down saying,</p>
<p>no one can criticize these ideas.</p>
<p>And if you do, you won&rsquo;t be executed, you&rsquo;ll be canceled.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be fired.</p>
<p>Now, is that fence electrified from there?</p>
<p>No, they don&rsquo;t work at the company, they can&rsquo;t fire you.</p>
<p>But they can start a Twitter mob</p>
<p>when someone violates that speech curve,</p>
<p>when someone violates that speech rule.</p>
<p>And then the leadership at the company</p>
<p>has the moment of truth.</p>
<p>And what the leaders should do</p>
<p>is stand up for their company&rsquo;s values,</p>
<p>which is almost always in favor of the employee and say,</p>
<p>look, even if they made a mistake,</p>
<p>they make people make mistakes, we&rsquo;re not gonna fire them.</p>
<p>Or maybe that person actually said something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s reasonable and we should discuss it.</p>
<p>But either way, we&rsquo;re not gonna fire them.</p>
<p>And if they said no, what happens is the Twitter mob</p>
<p>actually doesn&rsquo;t have, they can&rsquo;t execute you.</p>
<p>They go away.</p>
<p>And the fence has proven to have no electricity.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been the problem with the past few years</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s happened again and again</p>
<p>is the leader gets scared</p>
<p>and they get scared of the Twitter mob and they fire them.</p>
<p>Boom, that fence has electricity.</p>
<p>And now actually, if you cross that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just a threat.</p>
<p>Like you will have, you&rsquo;ll be out of a job.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s really bad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have a huge penalty.</p>
<p>You might not be able to feed your kids.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an electric fence that goes up.</p>
<p>Now, what happens when an electric fence goes up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s proven to actually be electrified?</p>
<p>The speech curve morphs into a totally different position.</p>
<p>And now these new people say,</p>
<p>instead of having the kind of marketplace of ideas</p>
<p>that turns into a kind of a natural bell curve,</p>
<p>they say, no, no, no, these ideas are okay to say.</p>
<p>Not just okay, you&rsquo;ll be socially rewarded.</p>
<p>And these ones don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the rules of their own echo chamber</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re now applying to everyone and it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>And so the speech curve distorts.</p>
<p>And so you end up with now,</p>
<p>instead of one region,</p>
<p>which is a region of kind of active communal thinking,</p>
<p>what people are thinking and saying,</p>
<p>you now have three regions.</p>
<p>You have a little active communal thinking,</p>
<p>but mostly you now have this dormant thought pile,</p>
<p>which is all these opinions</p>
<p>that suddenly everyone&rsquo;s scared to say out loud.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s thinking, but they&rsquo;re scared to say it out loud.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s thinking, but no one&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>And then you have this other region,</p>
<p>which is the approved ideas</p>
<p>of this now cultural kind of dictator.</p>
<p>And those are being spoken from the largest platforms</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re being repeated by the president</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re being repeated all over the place,</p>
<p>even though people don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s this distortion.</p>
<p>And what happens is the society becomes really stupid</p>
<p>because active communal thinking</p>
<p>is the region where we can actually think together.</p>
<p>And now no one can think together.</p>
<p>And it gets siloed into small private conversations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really powerful what you said</p>
<p>about institutions and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not trivial from a leadership position</p>
<p>to be like, no, we defend the employee</p>
<p>or we defend the, yeah, the employee,</p>
<p>the person with us on our,</p>
<p>like, because we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no actual ground</p>
<p>to any kind of violation we&rsquo;re hearing about.</p>
<p>So the mob, they resist the mob.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ultimately to the leader, I guess,</p>
<p>of a particular institution or a particular company.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>No, yeah, no, no, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>If it were easy, there wouldn&rsquo;t be all of these failings.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s the immune system failing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the liberal immune system of that company failing,</p>
<p>but also then it&rsquo;s an example,</p>
<p>which means that a lot of other,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s failing kind of to the country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s not, because we have primitive minds</p>
<p>that are wired to care so much</p>
<p>about what people think of us.</p>
<p>And even if we&rsquo;re not gonna,</p>
<p>first of all, we&rsquo;re scared that it&rsquo;s gonna start a,</p>
<p>because what do mobs do?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t just say, I&rsquo;m gonna criticize you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna criticize anyone who still buys your product.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna criticize anyone who goes on your podcast.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now suddenly, if Lex becomes tarnished enough,</p>
<p>now I go on the podcast and people are saying,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m not buying his book.</p>
<p>He went on Lex Friedman, no thanks, right?</p>
<p>And now I get, I call it a smear web.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve been smeared and it&rsquo;s so,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in such a bad time that it smear travels to me.</p>
<p>And now meanwhile, someone who buys my book</p>
<p>and tries to share it,</p>
<p>someone said, you&rsquo;re buying that guy&rsquo;s book?</p>
<p>You know, he goes on Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>You see how this happens, right?</p>
<p>So that hasn&rsquo;t happened in this case,</p>
<p>but that, so we are so wired.</p>
<p>A, that is kind of bad, right?</p>
<p>Like that is actually like bad for you,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re wired to care about it so much</p>
<p>because it meant life or death back in the day.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And luckily in this case,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re both probably can smear each other in this conversation.</p>
<p>This is wonderful.</p>
<p>I smear you all the time.</p>
<p>Given the nature of your book.</p>
<p>What do you think about freedom of speech</p>
<p>as a term and as an idea,</p>
<p>as a way to resist the mechanism,</p>
<p>this mechanism of dormant thought pile</p>
<p>and artificially generated speech?</p>
<p>This ideal of the freedom of speech</p>
<p>and protecting speech and celebrating speech.</p>
<p>Well, so this is kind of the point</p>
<p>I was talking about earlier,</p>
<p>about King Mustache made a rule against,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s created official.</p>
<p>I just love the,</p>
<p>one of the amazing things about your book,</p>
<p>as you get later and later in the book,</p>
<p>you cover more and more difficult issues</p>
<p>as a way to illustrate the importance</p>
<p>of the vertical perspective.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about using hilarious drawings</p>
<p>throughout that make it much more fun.</p>
<p>And it takes you away from the personal somehow.</p>
<p>And you start thinking in the space of ideas</p>
<p>versus like outside of the tribal type of thinking.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really brilliant,</p>
<p>I mean, I would advise for anybody to do,</p>
<p>when they write controversial books,</p>
<p>to have hilarious drawings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Put the silly stick figure in your thing</p>
<p>and it lightens, it does, it lightens the mood.</p>
<p>It gets people&rsquo;s guard down a little bit.</p>
<p>And it works.</p>
<p>It reminds people that we&rsquo;re all friends here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s laugh at ourselves,</p>
<p>laugh at the fact that we&rsquo;re in a culture war a little bit</p>
<p>and now we can talk about it,</p>
<p>as opposed to getting religious about it.</p>
<p>But basically, King Mustache had no First Amendment.</p>
<p>He said, the government is censoring,</p>
<p>which is very common around the world.</p>
<p>Governments censor all the time.</p>
<p>The US, again, there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>you can argue there&rsquo;s some controversial things recently,</p>
<p>but basically the US,</p>
<p>the First Amendment isn&rsquo;t the problem, right?</p>
<p>No one is being arrested for saying the wrong thing,</p>
<p>but this graph is still happening.</p>
<p>And so, so freedom of speech,</p>
<p>when people, what people like to say is,</p>
<p>if someone&rsquo;s complaining about a cancel culture</p>
<p>and saying, this is an anti-free speech,</p>
<p>people like to point out, no, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s not arresting you for anything.</p>
<p>This is called the free market, buddy.</p>
<p>This is called, you&rsquo;re putting your ideas out</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting criticized</p>
<p>and your precious marketplace of ideas,</p>
<p>there it is, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve gotten this a lot.</p>
<p>And this is not making a critical distinction</p>
<p>between cancel culture and criticism culture.</p>
<p>Criticism culture is a little bit of this kind of</p>
<p>high-rung idea lab stuff we talked about.</p>
<p>Criticism culture attacks the idea</p>
<p>and encourages further discussion, right?</p>
<p>It enlivens discussion.</p>
<p>It makes everyone smarter.</p>
<p>Cancel culture attacks the person.</p>
<p>Very different.</p>
<p>Criticism culture says, here&rsquo;s why this idea is so bad.</p>
<p>Let me tell you.</p>
<p>Cancel culture says, here&rsquo;s why this person is bad</p>
<p>and no one should talk to them and they should be fired.</p>
<p>And what does that do?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t enliven the discussion.</p>
<p>It makes everyone scared to talk and it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>It shuts down discussion.</p>
<p>So you still have your First Amendment,</p>
<p>but First Amendment plus cancel culture equals,</p>
<p>you might as well be in King must,</p>
<p>you might as well have government censorship, right?</p>
<p>First Amendment plus criticism culture, great.</p>
<p>Now you have this vibrant marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a very clear difference.</p>
<p>And so when people criticize the cancel culture</p>
<p>and then someone says, oh, see, you&rsquo;re so sensitive now.</p>
<p>Look, you&rsquo;re doing the cancel culture yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to punish this person for criticizing.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Every good liberal, and I mean that in the lower case,</p>
<p>which is that anyone who believes in liberal democracies,</p>
<p>regardless of what they believe should stand up</p>
<p>and say no to cancel culture and say, this is not okay,</p>
<p>regardless of what the actual topic is.</p>
<p>And that makes them a good liberal</p>
<p>versus if they&rsquo;re trying to cancel</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s just criticizing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing the opposite.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re shutting.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the opposite things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very easy to get confused.</p>
<p>You can see people take advantage of the,</p>
<p>and sometimes they just don&rsquo;t know it themselves.</p>
<p>The lines here can be very confusing.</p>
<p>The wording can be very confusing.</p>
<p>And without that wording,</p>
<p>suddenly it looks like someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s criticizing cancel culture is canceling,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>You applied this thinking to universities in particular.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great, yet another great image</p>
<p>on the trade-off between knowledge and conviction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s commonly,</p>
<p>actually you can maybe explain to me the difference,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s often referred to as the Dunning-Kruger effect,</p>
<p>where when you first learn of a thing,</p>
<p>you have an extremely high confidence</p>
<p>about self-estimation of how well you understand that thing.</p>
<p>You actually say that Dunning-Kruger means something else.</p>
<p>So yeah, when I post this,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s like Dunning-Kruger,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s what everyone thinks Dunning-Kruger is.</p>
<p>Dunning-Kruger is a little different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you have a diagonal line like this one,</p>
<p>which is the place you are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the, I call it like the humility tightrope,</p>
<p>but the humility sweet spot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly the right level of humility</p>
<p>based on what you know.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re below it, you&rsquo;re insecure.</p>
<p>You actually have too much humility.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have enough confidence</p>
<p>because you know more than you&rsquo;re giving yourself credit for</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re above the line,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the arrogance zone, right?</p>
<p>You need a dose of humility, right?</p>
<p>You think you know more than you do.</p>
<p>So we all want to stay on that tightrope,</p>
<p>and Dunning-Kruger is basically a straight line</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just has a lower slope.</p>
<p>So you start off, you still are getting more confident</p>
<p>as you go along, but you start off above that line</p>
<p>and as you learn more, you end up below the line later.</p>
<p>So, but anyway.</p>
<p>So this wavy thing.</p>
<p>This wavy thing is a different phenomenon</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s related, but.</p>
<p>So this idea, so for people just listening,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a child&rsquo;s hill, pretty damn sure you know a whole lot</p>
<p>and feeling great about it, that&rsquo;s in the beginning.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s an insecure canyon, you crash down,</p>
<p>acknowledging that you don&rsquo;t know that much.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a growth mountain.</p>
<p>Grown up mountain.</p>
<p>Grown up mountain, where after you feel ashamed</p>
<p>and embarrassed about not knowing that much,</p>
<p>you begin to realize that knowing how little you know</p>
<p>is the first step in becoming someone</p>
<p>who actually knows stuff, and that&rsquo;s the grown up mountain.</p>
<p>And you climb and climb and climb.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying that in universities,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re pinning people at the top of the child&rsquo;s hill.</p>
<p>So for me, this is a very, you know,</p>
<p>I think of myself with this, because I went to college,</p>
<p>like a lot of 18 year olds, and I was very cocky.</p>
<p>I just thought I knew a lot, you know?</p>
<p>And when it came to politics, I was like bright blue,</p>
<p>just because I grew up in a bright blue suburb,</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t thinking that hard about it,</p>
<p>and I thought that, you know?</p>
<p>And what I did when I went to college</p>
<p>is met a lot of smart conservatives</p>
<p>and a lot of smart progressives,</p>
<p>but I met a lot of people who weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just going down a checklist, and they knew stuff.</p>
<p>And suddenly I realized that a lot of these views I have</p>
<p>are not based on knowledge.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re based on other people&rsquo;s conviction.</p>
<p>Everyone else thinks that&rsquo;s true, so now I think it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Whoa, I&rsquo;m actually like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m transferring someone else&rsquo;s conviction to me,</p>
<p>and who knows why they have conviction?</p>
<p>They might have conviction</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re transferring from someone else.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a smart dude, I thought.</p>
<p>Why am I like giving away my own independent,</p>
<p>you know, learning abilities here,</p>
<p>and just adopting other views?</p>
<p>So anyway, it was this humbling experience.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t just about politics, by the way.</p>
<p>It was that I had strong views about a lot of stuff,</p>
<p>and I just, I got lucky, or not lucky, I sought out,</p>
<p>you know, the kind of people I sought out</p>
<p>were the type that loved to disagree,</p>
<p>and they were, man, they knew stuff.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re quickly, and again,</p>
<p>ideal lab culture, it was an ideal lab.</p>
<p>And also, I also went to, I started getting in the habit,</p>
<p>I started loving listening to people who disagreed with me,</p>
<p>because it was so exhilarating listening to a smart,</p>
<p>when I thought there was no credence</p>
<p>to this other argument, right?</p>
<p>This side of this debate is obviously wrong.</p>
<p>I wanted to see an intelligence squared</p>
<p>from that debate in particular.</p>
<p>I wanted to go see, I&rsquo;ve actually gotten</p>
<p>into intelligence squared in college.</p>
<p>I wanted to see a smart person who disagrees with me talk.</p>
<p>It became so fascinating to me, right?</p>
<p>It was the most interesting thing.</p>
<p>That was a new thing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think I liked that.</p>
<p>And so what did that do?</p>
<p>That shoved me down the humble tumble here, number three.</p>
<p>It shoved me down where I started to,</p>
<p>and then I went the other way,</p>
<p>where I realized that I had been,</p>
<p>a lot of my identity had been based</p>
<p>on this faux feeling of knowledge,</p>
<p>this idea that I thought I knew everything.</p>
<p>Now that I don&rsquo;t have that, I felt really dumb,</p>
<p>and I felt really almost embarrassed of what I knew.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where I call this insecure canyon.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s sometimes when you&rsquo;re so used</p>
<p>to thinking you know everything,</p>
<p>and then you realize you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then you start to realize</p>
<p>that actually really awesome thinkers,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t judge me for this.</p>
<p>They totally respect if I say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about this.</p>
<p>They say, oh, cool, you should read this and this and this.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t say, you don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t say that, right?</p>
<p>And so, and not that I&rsquo;m, by the way,</p>
<p>this is not to say I&rsquo;m now on Grown Up Mountain</p>
<p>and you should all join me.</p>
<p>I often find myself drifting up with like a helium balloon.</p>
<p>Oh, I think I read about the new thing,</p>
<p>and suddenly I think I have all,</p>
<p>I think I read three things about a new AI thing,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ll go do a talk on this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I just, I&rsquo;m gonna just be spouting out</p>
<p>the opinion of the person I just read,</p>
<p>so I have to remind myself.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>Now, the reason my problem with college is today</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s, I was, I graduated in 2004.</p>
<p>This is a recent change,</p>
<p>is that all of those speakers I went</p>
<p>who disagreed with me, a lot of them were conservative.</p>
<p>So many of those speakers</p>
<p>would not be allowed on campuses today.</p>
<p>And so many of the discussions I had</p>
<p>were in big groups or classrooms.</p>
<p>And this was still, you know, this was a liberal campus.</p>
<p>So many of those disagreements,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not happening today.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve interviewed a ton of college students.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s chilly.</p>
<p>It is, you know, people keep to themselves.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening is,</p>
<p>not only are people losing that push off Child&rsquo;s Hill,</p>
<p>which was so valuable to me,</p>
<p>so valuable to me as a thinker.</p>
<p>It kind of started my life as a better thinker.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re losing that, but actually,</p>
<p>what college, a lot of the college classes</p>
<p>and the vibe in colleges,</p>
<p>a lot of it is now saying</p>
<p>that there is one right set of views.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this kind of, you know, woke ideology.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And anyone who disagrees with it is bad.</p>
<p>And anyone, and don&rsquo;t speak up, you know,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re gonna agree with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s teaching people that Child&rsquo;s Hill is that,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s nailing people&rsquo;s feet to Child&rsquo;s Hill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s teaching people that these are right.</p>
<p>This views are right.</p>
<p>And like, you don&rsquo;t have any,</p>
<p>you have nothing to,</p>
<p>you should feel a complete conviction about them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do we fix it?</p>
<p>Is it part of the administration?</p>
<p>Is it part of the culture?</p>
<p>Is it part of the,</p>
<p>is it part of like actually instilling</p>
<p>in the individual, like 18 year olds,</p>
<p>the idea that this is the beautiful way to live</p>
<p>is to embrace the disagreement and the growth from that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awareness and courage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>So first of all, just get,</p>
<p>awareness is people need to see what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>
<p>That kids are getting, losing the,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to college and becoming better,</p>
<p>tougher, more robust thinkers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually going to college and becoming zealots.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting taught to be zealots.</p>
<p>And the website still advertises, you know,</p>
<p>wide variety of, you know, the website is a bait and switch.</p>
<p>You list all the universities, yeah, Harvard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bait and switch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still saying here,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re coming here for a wide intellectual,</p>
<p>basically they&rsquo;re advertising this as an ideal lab.</p>
<p>And you get there and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>actually it&rsquo;s an echo chamber that you&rsquo;re paying money for.</p>
<p>So if people realize that,</p>
<p>they start to get mad, hopefully.</p>
<p>And then courage, I mean, starts, you know,</p>
<p>yes, brave students.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been some very brave students who have started,</p>
<p>you know, big think clubs and stuff like that,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re going to have, you know,</p>
<p>present both sides of a debate here.</p>
<p>And that, that takes courage,</p>
<p>but also courage and leadership.</p>
<p>Like the, it&rsquo;s like, if you look at these colleges,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s specifically the leaders who show strength,</p>
<p>who get the best results.</p>
<p>Remember the cudgel is soft.</p>
<p>So if a leader of one of these places says, you know,</p>
<p>that the college presidents who have shown some strength,</p>
<p>they actually don&rsquo;t get as much trouble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ones who pander, the ones who,</p>
<p>you know, in that moment of truth, they shrink away.</p>
<p>Then they get a lot more trouble.</p>
<p>The mob smells blood.</p>
<p>For the listener, the podcast favorite Liv Burry</p>
<p>just entered, and your friend just entered the room.</p>
<p>Do you mind if she joins us?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a story she has about you.</p>
<p>So Liv, you mentioned something that there&rsquo;s a funny story</p>
<p>about, we haven&rsquo;t talked at all</p>
<p>about the actual process of writing the book.</p>
<p>Is there, you guys made a bet of some kind?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is this a true story?</p>
<p>Is this a completely false fabric?</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Liv is, she&rsquo;s mean.</p>
<p>When she, I did not know mean Liv.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, she&rsquo;s like a bully.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like scary.</p>
<p>I have to have that screenshot.</p>
<p>So Liv was FaceTiming me and she was like,</p>
<p>she was like being intimidating.</p>
<p>I took a screenshot and I made it my phone background.</p>
<p>So every time I opened it, I was like, ah.</p>
<p>So to give the background of this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because if you hadn&rsquo;t noticed,</p>
<p>Tim started writing this book, how many years ago, six?</p>
<p>2016, mid 2016.</p>
<p>Right, as sort of a response to like the Trump stuff.</p>
<p>Not even, yeah, it was just supposed to be a mini post.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, I&rsquo;m so like,</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m looking at all these like future tech things</p>
<p>and I feel this like uneasiness,</p>
<p>like, ah, we&rsquo;re gonna like mess up all these things.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like some cloud over our society.</p>
<p>Let me just write a mini post.</p>
<p>And I opened it up to WordPress to write a one day</p>
<p>little essay and things went.</p>
<p>On politics.</p>
<p>It was gonna be on like this feeling I had that like,</p>
<p>this feeling I had that we were,</p>
<p>our tech was just growing and growing</p>
<p>and we were becoming less wise.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up, what&rsquo;s up with that?</p>
<p>And I just wanted to write like,</p>
<p>just like a little like a little thousand word essay</p>
<p>on like something I think we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>And that was the beginning of this six year nightmare.</p>
<p>Did you anticipate that the blog post</p>
<p>would take a long while?</p>
<p>Um, I don&rsquo;t remember the process fully in terms of,</p>
<p>I remember you saying, oh, I&rsquo;m actually writing this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s turning into a bigger thing.</p>
<p>And I was like, hmm.</p>
<p>You know, because the more we talked about it,</p>
<p>I remember we were talking about it.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, this goes deep.</p>
<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t really understand the full scope</p>
<p>of the situation, like nowhere near.</p>
<p>And you sort of explained it.</p>
<p>I was like, ah, okay, yeah, I see that.</p>
<p>And then the more we dug into it,</p>
<p>the sort of the deeper and deeper and deeper it went.</p>
<p>But no, I did not anticipate it would be six years.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>When was your TED talk on procrastination?</p>
<p>So that was, that was March of 2016.</p>
<p>And I started this book three months later</p>
<p>and fell into the biggest procrastination hole</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever fallen into.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>The irony isn&rsquo;t lost on me.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s, I just like,</p>
<p>I like how much cred I have as a, as for that TED talk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I am legit procrastinator.</p>
<p>That is not, I&rsquo;m not just saying it, like.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t just that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Because I mean, you did, you know,</p>
<p>you did intend it to start out as a blog post,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>actually this needs to maybe multiple,</p>
<p>actually let&rsquo;s make it into a full series.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll turn it into a book.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>And, and, and what,</p>
<p>but also what Liv witnessed a few times,</p>
<p>and my wife has witnessed like 30 of these,</p>
<p>is like these, these 180 epiphanies,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ll be like, I&rsquo;ll like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have a moment when I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know what, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s a really good idea,</p>
<p>but sometimes it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just dreading having to finish this the way it is.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s epiphanies where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know what?</p>
<p>I need to start over from the beginning</p>
<p>and just make this like a short,</p>
<p>20 little blog posts list.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll say, no, no, no,</p>
<p>I have like a new epiphany I have to,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s these, and, and yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like the crazy person a little bit.</p>
<p>But anyway, can I tell the story of the, the, the bed?</p>
<p>Go for it.</p>
<p>All right, so things came to a head</p>
<p>when we were in,</p>
<p>we were all on vacation in Dominican Republic,</p>
<p>Tim and his wife, me and Igor,</p>
<p>and we were in the ocean.</p>
<p>And I remember you&rsquo;d been in the ocean for like an hour,</p>
<p>just bobbing in there, becoming it.</p>
<p>And we got talking and we were talking about the book</p>
<p>and, you know, you were expressing just like this,</p>
<p>you know, the, just the horror of the situation,</p>
<p>basically you&rsquo;re like, look, I just,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so close, but there&rsquo;s still this,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>and an idea popped into my head,</p>
<p>which is the, you know, poker players often,</p>
<p>we, we will set ourselves like negative bets,</p>
<p>you know, like essentially if we don&rsquo;t get a job done,</p>
<p>then we have to do something we really don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>So instead of having a carrot,</p>
<p>like a really, really big stick.</p>
<p>So I had the idea to ask Tim, okay,</p>
<p>what is the worst either organization or individual</p>
<p>that you, if you had to, you know,</p>
<p>that you would loathe to give a large sum of money to?</p>
<p>And he thought about it for a little while</p>
<p>and he gave his answer.</p>
<p>And I was like, all right, what&rsquo;s your net worth?</p>
<p>He said his net worth.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>10% of your net worth to that thing.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t get the draft,</p>
<p>because, oh, that&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>but just before that I asked him,</p>
<p>how long, like if you had a gun to your head</p>
<p>or to your wife&rsquo;s head,</p>
<p>and you had to get the book into a state</p>
<p>where you could like send off an edit to the,</p>
<p>a draft to your editor, how long?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, oh, I guess like I could get it</p>
<p>like 95% good in a month.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, great.</p>
<p>In one month&rsquo;s time, if you do not have that edit,</p>
<p>handed in, there&rsquo;s draft handed in, really scary.</p>
<p>10% of your net worth is going to this thing</p>
<p>that you really, really think is terrible.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re forgetting the kicker.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>The kicker was that,</p>
<p>because, you know, procrastinators, they self-defeat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>And then Liv says, I&rsquo;m going to sweeten the deal.</p>
<p>And I am going to basically match you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to put in,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to send this like a huge amount</p>
<p>of my own money there if you don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So, and I can&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s, that would be really bad.</p>
<p>So not only are you screwing yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re screwing a friend.</p>
<p>And she was like, and as your friend,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m your friend, I will send it.</p>
<p>I will send the money.</p>
<p>I mean, like that, you know, like tyranny.</p>
<p>And I got the draft in.</p>
<p>I got the draft in. Just, just!</p>
<p>I know, well, I was-</p>
<p>Ego could have tested this.</p>
<p>Actually, it was funny,</p>
<p>because it was like supposed to be</p>
<p>by the summer solstice or whatever it was.</p>
<p>It was like a certain date.</p>
<p>And I got it in at four,</p>
<p>I got, no, I got it in at 4 a.m.</p>
<p>like the next morning.</p>
<p>But then, and, and, and, and they were both like,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, it does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still, for me, it&rsquo;s the same day still.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how fucked in the head you have to be?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To like literally technically pass the deadline</p>
<p>by four hours for an obscene amount of money</p>
<p>to a thing you loathe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how bad his sickness is.</p>
<p>Because I knew the hard, hard deadline.</p>
<p>I knew that there was no way she was going to</p>
<p>actually send that money because it was 4 a.m.</p>
<p>So I knew I actually had the whole night.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I should actually punish you and just,</p>
<p>I should send like a nominal amount to that thing.</p>
<p>No, thanks.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>Is there some micro like lessons from that,</p>
<p>from how to avoid procrastination</p>
<p>writing a book that you&rsquo;ve learned?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of things.</p>
<p>I mean, like first don&rsquo;t take,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t write like a dissertation</p>
<p>about like proving some grand theory of society,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really procrastinating.</p>
<p>Like I would have been an awful PhD student</p>
<p>for that reason.</p>
<p>And so like I&rsquo;m going to do another book</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be like a bunch of short chapters</p>
<p>that are one-offs,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t feed into procrastination.</p>
<p>But your book is like a giant like framework.</p>
<p>There is grand theories all through your book.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>And I learned not to do that again.</p>
<p>I did it once.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do it again.</p>
<p>Oh, with the book was a mistake.</p>
<p>So the book is a giant mistake.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do another one.</p>
<p>Look, some people should.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not for me.</p>
<p>You just did it.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>And it almost killed me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first one.</p>
<p>But secondly, yeah.</p>
<p>Basically there&rsquo;s two ways to fix procrastination.</p>
<p>One is you fix,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a picture you have a boat that&rsquo;s leaking</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not working very well.</p>
<p>You can fix it in two ways.</p>
<p>You can get your hammer and nails out</p>
<p>and your boards and actually fix the boat.</p>
<p>Or you can duct tape it for now</p>
<p>to get yourself across the river,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not actually fixed.</p>
<p>So ideally down the road,</p>
<p>I have repaired whatever kind of bizarre mental illness</p>
<p>that I have that makes me procrastinate</p>
<p>in a very like,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t self-defeat in this way anymore.</p>
<p>But in the meantime,</p>
<p>I can duct tape the boat</p>
<p>by bringing what I call the panic monster</p>
<p>into the situation via things like this</p>
<p>and this scary person.</p>
<p>And having external pressure,</p>
<p>to have external pressure of some kind is critical for me.</p>
<p>Yes, I don&rsquo;t have the muscle to do the work</p>
<p>I need to do without external pressure.</p>
<p>By the way, Liv,</p>
<p>is there a possible future where you write a book?</p>
<p>And meanwhile, by the way,</p>
<p>huge procrastinator.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the funny thing about this.</p>
<p>How long did your last video take you?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Is there advice that you give to Liv</p>
<p>how to get the videos done faster?</p>
<p>Well, it would be the same exact thing.</p>
<p>I mean, actually I can give good procrastination advice.</p>
<p>Panic monster?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we should do it together.</p>
<p>It should be like we have this date,</p>
<p>but you know, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>We should actually just do another bet.</p>
<p>I have to have my script done by this time.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I gotta get the third part out.</p>
<p>Because then you&rsquo;ll actually do it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>the thing is the time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if you could take three weeks on a video</p>
<p>and instead you take 10 weeks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like, oh, well, I also,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having more fun in those 10 weeks.</p>
<p>The whole 10 weeks are bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s torture.</p>
<p>Bad.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just having a bad time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting less work done and less work out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re enjoying your personal life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad for your relationships.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad for your own-</p>
<p>But you keep doing it anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, a lot of people have troubles</p>
<p>keeping a diet, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Primitive mind.</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you point at me when you said that?</p>
<p>That was offensive.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your procrastination weakness?</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s he doing right now?</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Everything, preparing for a conversation.</p>
<p>I had your book, amazing book.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I started reading it.</p>
<p>I was like, this is awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so awesome that I&rsquo;m going to save it</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m behind a computer and can take notes,</p>
<p>like good notes.</p>
<p>Of course, that resulted in like a last minute,</p>
<p>everything, everything.</p>
<p>Everything I&rsquo;m doing in my life.</p>
<p>Not everyone&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>People self-defeat in different ways.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t have this particular problem.</p>
<p>Adam Grant, he calls himself a procrastinator,</p>
<p>where if he gets an assignment,</p>
<p>he will go home and do it until it&rsquo;s done and hand it in,</p>
<p>which is also not necessarily good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re rushing it either way, but it&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>But some people have the opposite thing,</p>
<p>where they will, the looming deadline</p>
<p>makes them so anxious that they go and fix it, right?</p>
<p>And the procrastinator, I think, has a similar anxiety,</p>
<p>but they solve it in a totally different way.</p>
<p>Well, they don&rsquo;t solve it.</p>
<p>They just live with the anxiety.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>They just live with the anxiety.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an even bigger group of people.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s these people, the Adam Grants.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people like me.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s people who have a healthy relationship</p>
<p>with deadlines, but they&rsquo;re still part of a bigger group</p>
<p>of people that actually,</p>
<p>they need a deadline there to do something.</p>
<p>So they actually, they still are motivated by a deadline.</p>
<p>And as soon as you have all the things in life</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have a deadline, like working out</p>
<p>and like working on that album you wanted to write,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t do anything either.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s actually like, that&rsquo;s why procrastination</p>
<p>is a much bigger problem than people realize</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just the funny last second people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s anyone who actually can&rsquo;t get things done</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have a deadline.</p>
<p>You dedicate your book, quote, to Tandis,</p>
<p>who never planned on being married to someone</p>
<p>who would spend six years talking about his book</p>
<p>on politics, but here we are.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the secret to a successful relationship</p>
<p>with a procrastinator?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s maybe for both of you.</p>
<p>Well, I think the first and most important thing.</p>
<p>You already started with a political answer.</p>
<p>I can tell.</p>
<p>Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>No, the first and most important thing is,</p>
<p>because people who don&rsquo;t procrastinate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you will, people, and the instinct</p>
<p>is to judge it as like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s either just think they&rsquo;re just being like a loser</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re taking it, or they&rsquo;ll take it personally,</p>
<p>you know, and instead to see this as like,</p>
<p>this is some form of addiction or some form</p>
<p>of ailment, you know, they&rsquo;re not just being a dick, right?</p>
<p>Like they have a problem and so some compassion,</p>
<p>but then also maybe finding that line where you can,</p>
<p>you know, maybe apply some tough love, some middle ground.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you might say that, you know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want the significant other relationship</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re the one nagging you.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s, you don&rsquo;t want them even being part of that.</p>
<p>And I think maybe it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>better to have a live, do it instead.</p>
<p>Right, having someone who can like create</p>
<p>the infrastructure where they aren&rsquo;t the direct stick.</p>
<p>You need a bit of carrot and stick, right?</p>
<p>Maybe they can be the person who keeps reminding them</p>
<p>of the carrot and then they set up the friend group</p>
<p>to be the stick.</p>
<p>And then that keeps your relationship in a good place.</p>
<p>Stick, like looming in the background,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your friend group.</p>
<p>Okay, at the beginning of the conversation,</p>
<p>we talked about how all of human history</p>
<p>can be presented as a thousand page book.</p>
<p>What are you excited about for the 1000th,</p>
<p>how do you say that, first page?</p>
<p>So the next 250 years.</p>
<p>What are you most excited about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m most excited about,</p>
<p>have you read The Fable of the Dragon?</p>
<p>Okay, well, it&rsquo;s an allegory for death</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, you know, Nick Bostrom,</p>
<p>and he talks about the, he compares death to a dragon</p>
<p>that eats 60 million people,</p>
<p>or whatever the number is, every year.</p>
<p>And you just, every year we shepherd those people up</p>
<p>and they feed them to the dragon.</p>
<p>And that there&rsquo;s a Stockholm syndrome</p>
<p>when we say that&rsquo;s just a lot of man.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we have to do.</p>
<p>And anyone who says, maybe we should try to beat the dragon,</p>
<p>they get called vain and narcissistic.</p>
<p>But someone who tries to, someone who does chemo,</p>
<p>no one calls them vain or narcissistic.</p>
<p>They say they&rsquo;re good, good for you, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a hero, you&rsquo;re fighting the good fight.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s some disconnect here.</p>
<p>And I think that if we can get out of that</p>
<p>Stockholm syndrome and realize that death</p>
<p>is just the machine, the human physical machine failing,</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s no law of nature that says</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t, with enough technology,</p>
<p>repair the machine and keep it going until,</p>
<p>no one, I don&rsquo;t think anyone wants to live forever.</p>
<p>People think they do, no one does.</p>
<p>But until people are ready.</p>
<p>And I think when we hit a world where we can,</p>
<p>we have enough tech that we can continue</p>
<p>to keep the human machine alive until the person says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done, I&rsquo;m ready.</p>
<p>I think we will look back and we will think</p>
<p>that anything before that time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be the real A.D., B.C.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll look back at B.C. before the big advancement</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll seem so sad and so heartbreaking, barbaric.</p>
<p>And people will say, I can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that humans like us had to live with that</p>
<p>when they lost loved ones and they died</p>
<p>before they were ready.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the ultimate achievement.</p>
<p>But we need to stop criticizing and smearing people</p>
<p>who, you talk about it.</p>
<p>So you think that&rsquo;s actually doable in the next 250 years?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>A lot happens in 250 years,</p>
<p>especially when technology really exponentially, yeah.</p>
<p>And you think humans will be around</p>
<p>versus A.I. completely takes over</p>
<p>where mortality means something completely different?</p>
<p>I mean, look, the optimist in me,</p>
<p>and maybe the stupid kind of 2023 person in me,</p>
<p>says, yeah, of course, we&rsquo;ll make it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p>
<p>But you know, I mean, we are going into,</p>
<p>you know, I have a friend who knows</p>
<p>as much about the future as anyone I know.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s really, he&rsquo;s a big investor in future tech</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s really on the pulse of things</p>
<p>and he just says, the future&rsquo;s gonna be weird.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he says.</p>
<p>The future&rsquo;s gonna be weird and it&rsquo;s gonna be weird.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look at the last few decades of your life</p>
<p>and apply that forward and say,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just what life is like.</p>
<p>No, no, no, it&rsquo;s gonna be weird and different.</p>
<p>Well, some of my favorite things in this world are weird.</p>
<p>And speaking of which, it&rsquo;s good to have this conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to have you as friends.</p>
<p>This was an incredible one.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming back and Liv,</p>
<p>thanks for talking with me a bunch more times.</p>
<p>This was awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lex.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Winston Churchill.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s no enemy within,</p>
<p>the enemies outside cannot hurt you.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
