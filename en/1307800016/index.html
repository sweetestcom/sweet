    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 15, Etruscans, Romans, and a Modified Alphabet.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to turn our attention from the Eastern Mediterranean to the West,</p>
<p>specifically to Italy.</p>
<p>In the past few episodes, I&rsquo;ve discussed the significant influence of Greek on English.</p>
<p>Now we start to look at the tremendous influence of Latin.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned in earlier episodes, Modern English is pretty much a blend of Germanic</p>
<p>languages and Latin.</p>
<p>If you look through a modern English dictionary, you actually have to work to find words that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t find their way into English through either Latin or the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>There are obviously words from other sources, but their numbers are tiny in comparison to</p>
<p>the words we get from Old English, Old Norse, Latin, French, and Greek words that come into</p>
<p>English through Latin and French.</p>
<p>Now, as I&rsquo;ve looked over my notes in preparing this episode, I came to the very quick realization</p>
<p>that I could spend many episodes on Latin and its influences on English.</p>
<p>But for now, I&rsquo;m going to focus on the basics.</p>
<p>How did Latin emerge from the original Indo-European language?</p>
<p>How did Rome emerge as such a powerful city-state?</p>
<p>And how did Latin spread from the Italian peninsula to eventually encompass almost all</p>
<p>of continental Europe west of the Rhine?</p>
<p>Since a lot of Latin influence on English came with the Norman French in 1066, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>discuss that part of the story later when we get to the Norman invasion and the period</p>
<p>of Middle English.</p>
<p>So for now, the focus will be on the early Latin language and its influence on the Germanic</p>
<p>languages to the north.</p>
<p>And speaking of those Germanic languages, they are also part of this story.</p>
<p>As we look at the spread of the Roman Empire and its Latin language into Western Europe,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll start to look at the people who inhabited that area, specifically the Celts and the</p>
<p>Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But for this episode, we&rsquo;re just going to look at what happened first in Italy.</p>
<p>I should also note that this story also includes the spread of the alphabet, because the alphabet</p>
<p>was exported from Greece and underwent a lot of change by the time the Romans were done</p>
<p>with it.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve mentioned in the last couple of episodes, I&rsquo;m working on a special series</p>
<p>dedicated to the history of the alphabet and each of the letters which we use today.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still putting that together and I hope to have it completed very soon, so stay</p>
<p>tuned for more information on that.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s begin this episode with the arrival of Indo-European speaking tribes into the</p>
<p>Italian peninsula.</p>
<p>And the time frame here is not known with any real certainty.</p>
<p>The last time I discussed the ancestors of the Latin speakers was back in episode 11.</p>
<p>And I discussed the early expansion of the Indo-European tribes into Europe.</p>
<p>And I mentioned that a group of Indo-European tribes had moved around the western side of</p>
<p>the Black Sea into the region south of the Carpathian Mountains in the Danube Valley.</p>
<p>Now as you may recall from that episode, the Carpathian Mountains form a wedge shape on</p>
<p>the western side of the Black Sea.</p>
<p>And as a result, that mountain range tended to force westward moving tribes either northwestward</p>
<p>along the northern side of the Carpathians or southwestward along the southern side into</p>
<p>the Balkans and down into the Danube Valley.</p>
<p>Basically in the region where the river Danube flows from Central Europe into the Black Sea.</p>
<p>And I noted back in that episode that it&rsquo;s believed that the ancestors of the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes took the northwestward route since that route was a direct path to northern</p>
<p>Europe where the Germanic languages and the Germanic speaking tribes eventually emerged.</p>
<p>Now for this same reason, many historians believe that the Latin speakers must have</p>
<p>taken the southern route through the Balkan region and the Danube Valley since the Latin</p>
<p>speakers ended up in southern Europe in Italy.</p>
<p>But not all historians agree with that view.</p>
<p>Some believe that the ancestors of the Latin speakers took essentially the same path as</p>
<p>the Germanic speaking tribes along that northwestern route and that once they found themselves</p>
<p>in north central Europe, they then migrated southward into Italy.</p>
<p>And I just wanted to acknowledge at this point that there are differing views about how the</p>
<p>early Latin speaking tribes found their way into Italy.</p>
<p>Now the version of the story which I presented back in episode 11 was the southern theory.</p>
<p>I suggested that the ancestors of the Latin speakers had migrated southward from the Black</p>
<p>Sea region and were located in the Danube Valley in the Balkan region around the third</p>
<p>millennium BC.</p>
<p>And I also noted in that episode that some language historians believe that the Indo-European</p>
<p>tribes in this region included both the ancestors of the Latin speaking tribes and the Celtic</p>
<p>speaking tribes.</p>
<p>And this is based upon some strong linguistic similarities between those two languages.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s believed that the ancestors of the Celtic speaking tribes migrated from this</p>
<p>region in the vicinity of modern Hungary and from there they migrated northward into central</p>
<p>Europe into the region around modern Austria and Bavaria.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll take a much closer look at the Celtic tribes in an upcoming episode.</p>
<p>In fact, the story of modern English is really the story of the convergence of the Latin</p>
<p>speaking Romans from Italy, the Germanic speaking tribes from northern Europe into an area previously</p>
<p>occupied by Celtic speaking people in Britain.</p>
<p>So the history of these three groups is essential to our story and really essential to the overall</p>
<p>history of Western Europe.</p>
<p>But for now, let&rsquo;s look back to the Danube Valley, where we probably still have the ancestors</p>
<p>of the Latin speakers.</p>
<p>Over the next 1500 to 2000 years, we have a general migration of these tribes into Italy.</p>
<p>And the exact time frames, again, are not known with any real certainty.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s keep in mind that it&rsquo;s believed that there were a variety of Indo-European</p>
<p>tribes in this region during this time frame.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already discussed the migration of tribes from the same region into Greece, which led</p>
<p>to the destruction of the early Greek Mycenaean civilization and the ultimate expansion and</p>
<p>invasion of Sea Peoples throughout the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And the Dorian Greek ancestors are believed to be direct descendants of these migrating</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>We know with some certainty that there were tribes in this Balkan region north of Greece</p>
<p>in and around southeastern Europe around 1200 BC during the time in which Greece was experiencing</p>
<p>these pressures and invasions from the north.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very possible that these expansions were due to population growth.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also possible that some of these tribes in this region included the ancestors</p>
<p>of the Latin speakers.</p>
<p>But again, I say it&rsquo;s possible because there are some historians who advocate this connection,</p>
<p>but we may never know for certain whether the Latin-speaking ancestors were in fact</p>
<p>part of these tribes.</p>
<p>But we can say that Indo-European tribes were starting to appear in Italy a short time later.</p>
<p>By the time of the written history of Italy a few centuries later, most of the people</p>
<p>who inhabited Italy spoke Indo-European languages, what we know today as the Italic languages.</p>
<p>And one group of those tribes settled in an area along the western coast of Italy.</p>
<p>And these were the ancestors of the Latin speakers.</p>
<p>But again, early Latin was only one of several Indo-European languages being spoken in Italy</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>In fact, the earliest known Latin dialects were actually quite different from other Indo-European</p>
<p>languages being spoken in Italy early on.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s focus on western Italy because what happened here over the next few centuries</p>
<p>would set in motion a series of events which would ultimately define much of the history</p>
<p>of the western world.</p>
<p>Some of these Indo-European tribes, who spoke a very early version of Latin, began to settle</p>
<p>in and around the Tiber River in western Italy around 800 BC.</p>
<p>This region was surrounded by several hills which afforded these tribes some protection</p>
<p>from outside tribes.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that these were just a portion of the interrelated Latin-speaking tribes.</p>
<p>Some of the other Latin-speaking tribes settled in neighboring territories.</p>
<p>Now this hilly region around the Tiber River would eventually emerge into a settlement</p>
<p>which we would come to know as Rome.</p>
<p>Now the actual beginnings of Roman history are obscure.</p>
<p>The later day Romans created their own myths to explain the early history of the city.</p>
<p>One famous myth told of twin brothers named Romulus and Remus.</p>
<p>They built the early city and Romulus became the first king, thereby giving the city its</p>
<p>name, Rome.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a lot more to this mythological story, but it was myth.</p>
<p>The actual story is revealed by archaeology.</p>
<p>By around 750 BC, settlers were living in huts around the Palatine Hill, which was one</p>
<p>of the hills near the Tiber River.</p>
<p>Eventually settlements spread out and began to appear on several of the neighboring hills.</p>
<p>About a century later, say around 650 BC, the various settlements joined together to</p>
<p>form the city-state of Rome.</p>
<p>Now this early settlement of Rome was located at the northern limit of a fertile agricultural</p>
<p>region known as Latium.</p>
<p>And Latium extended up to the Tiber River, and the inhabitants of this general area were</p>
<p>known as the Latins.</p>
<p>And the language of the people in this region came to be known as Latin.</p>
<p>So the name Latin came from the region where these Indo-European tribes settled, Latium.</p>
<p>Now as I said, these initial Indo-European settlers in and around the region of Rome</p>
<p>were just some of the many competing tribes during this period in and around the same</p>
<p>region.</p>
<p>Most of these competing tribes also spoke Indo-European languages, including several</p>
<p>who spoke early dialects which we would come to know as Latin.</p>
<p>All of these tribes had their own gods and customs, and they fought amongst themselves</p>
<p>for power and influence.</p>
<p>And they were shepherds, and hunters, and farmers.</p>
<p>But over time, the peoples who inhabited the hills around the emerging settlement of Rome</p>
<p>began to speak a specific dialect and began to emerge as a distinct group of early people</p>
<p>who we can begin to call the Romans.</p>
<p>But before we go any further in our discussion of the early Romans, we have to stop and consider</p>
<p>their immediate neighbors to the north, the Etruscans.</p>
<p>The Etruscans are extremely important to this story for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, for much of the very early history of Rome, the settlement was under the control</p>
<p>and influence of those Etruscans.</p>
<p>So even though the Latin-speaking tribes occupied much of early Rome, the emerging city was</p>
<p>actually governed and controlled by the Etruscans.</p>
<p>And the second reason why the Etruscans are so important is because the alphabet went</p>
<p>through them before it got to the Latin-speaking Romans.</p>
<p>The Etruscans had borrowed the alphabet from the Greeks and made some basic changes to</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And about a century later, the early Latin-speaking Romans took the alphabet from the Etruscans</p>
<p>and applied it to their Indo-European language and made some more changes to it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at these Etruscans.</p>
<p>And first, let&rsquo;s consider the geography for a second.</p>
<p>Now Rome lies about midway along the western coast of Italy.</p>
<p>And during these ancient times, the area just to the north of Rome, all the way to the north</p>
<p>of modern Italy, was the Etruscan territory.</p>
<p>And it was basically the northwestern corner of Italy, and it includes modern-day Tuscany</p>
<p>and its capital, Florence.</p>
<p>Now the Etruscan civilization was actually in place before the Latin-speaking tribes</p>
<p>arrived in the hills around modern Rome.</p>
<p>And the first thing to understand about the Etruscans is that they were not Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>Historians don&rsquo;t know exactly where the Etruscans came from, but they seem to have emerged as</p>
<p>a distinct civilization in the 8th century BC.</p>
<p>Now grave evidence confirms that the Etruscans were in Italy by 750 BC.</p>
<p>And this would have been shortly before or around the same time that the first Indo-Europeans</p>
<p>were beginning to settle into the territory that would eventually emerge as Rome.</p>
<p>So that makes the Etruscan civilization the first civilized society in Italy.</p>
<p>And the Etruscans built cities, and they engaged in commerce, and they had a very advanced</p>
<p>culture.</p>
<p>Now the Etruscans were similar to the Phoenicians in many respects.</p>
<p>They were both a loose collection of city-states.</p>
<p>And they were both focused primarily on trade and commerce, not military conquest or empire.</p>
<p>And like the Phoenicians, the Etruscans did not have a strong central government.</p>
<p>And this weakness would have major implications for the civilization later on.</p>
<p>But for now, it was a quickly emerging commercial and cultural power in northern Italy.</p>
<p>And again, this was a time when Rome would have been nothing more than a simple village,</p>
<p>if even that.</p>
<p>Now in terms of the Etruscan civilization itself, their art was superb, and it rivaled</p>
<p>the best art of classical Greece.</p>
<p>And the Etruscans also built sophisticated roads, and drains, and aqueducts.</p>
<p>And they were very skilled metalworkers, and they produced high-quality products from tin</p>
<p>and copper, iron and gold, which was abundant in the Etruscan hills.</p>
<p>And this is one of the main reasons why the Greeks were so interested in the Etruscan</p>
<p>civilization.</p>
<p>The Greeks were interested in the metals, as well as the metal artwork and other artifacts</p>
<p>produced by the Etruscans.</p>
<p>And the Etruscans began trading these goods across the Mediterranean into Europe itself.</p>
<p>And by the 7th century BC, they were trading heavily with the Greeks, who supplied the</p>
<p>Etruscans with a variety of luxury goods.</p>
<p>And the Etruscans are also famous for works of art, including frescoes and decorated urns.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s turn to the Etruscan language.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, the Etruscan civilization was not an Indo-European civilization.</p>
<p>The Etruscan language was distinct, and it was unlike any other known language in the</p>
<p>ancient world.</p>
<p>The origin of the Etruscans is a mystery.</p>
<p>The Greek historian Herodotus said that they came from Lydia in Anatolia, and many later-day</p>
<p>Roman historians also accepted this theory.</p>
<p>Now Lydia was an area of Anatolia, near the Hittite Empire, and the Lydian language was</p>
<p>closely related to Hittite within the Anatolian family of languages.</p>
<p>So that means Lydian and Hittite were both Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>But the Etruscan language was not an Indo-European language.</p>
<p>Now the Greek historian Dionysius said that the Etruscans were native people who had inhabited</p>
<p>this region of Italy from the earliest known times.</p>
<p>And he noted that they did not speak a Lydian language.</p>
<p>And today historians are still divided on the issue.</p>
<p>But one thing we can say is that regardless of their origin, the Etruscan language was</p>
<p>definitely not Indo-European.</p>
<p>Now most of what is known about the language comes from a small number of inscriptions</p>
<p>which have been discovered.</p>
<p>About 10,000 brief inscriptions have survived in Etruscan, but linguists have had a very</p>
<p>difficult time translating those inscriptions.</p>
<p>And only about 100 root words have been translated with any degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>But these translations reveal that some of these words may have filtered down into the</p>
<p>Roman settlement to the south and found their way into later day Latin and eventually found</p>
<p>their way into modern English.</p>
<p>The modern English word histrionics comes from the Latin word hister which meant actor.</p>
<p>And the Latin word hister may have come from the Etruscan language.</p>
<p>Also words like person, personal, and persona come from the Latin word persona.</p>
<p>And this word may have come from the Etruscan word persu which meant mask in Etruscan.</p>
<p>And the modern English word atrium comes from Latin, but it too may have had Etruscan origins.</p>
<p>And words like military and militia come from a Latin root word milis which meant soldier</p>
<p>in Latin and again may have come from Etruscan.</p>
<p>And the modern English word satellite also came from Latin but may have originally derived</p>
<p>from the Etruscan word satellus which meant bodyguard.</p>
<p>So these are just some examples of Etruscan words which found their way into Latin and</p>
<p>eventually into English.</p>
<p>But there were quite a few other Etruscan words which entered Latin and didn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>their way into English.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really interesting here is the connection between the Etruscans and the Greeks.</p>
<p>Remember from our discussion of the Greeks in earlier episodes that the Greeks had established</p>
<p>colonies throughout the northern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And this included colonies in Sicily and southern Italy.</p>
<p>And these Greek influences poured into the early Etruscan civilization.</p>
<p>And both Etruscan and Greek influences began to pour into the emerging settlement at Rome</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>Now because of their extensive contacts with the Greeks and the Greek colonies, the Etruscans</p>
<p>began to borrow words from the Greeks, especially words related to ships and shipping.</p>
<p>Of the total number of Etruscan words which passed into later day Latin, about 25% of</p>
<p>the Etruscan words came from Greek origins.</p>
<p>And when nautical terms are taken into account, the proportion rises to 75% being from Greek</p>
<p>origin.</p>
<p>And among the words which came from Greek via Etruscan were the Latin words for ant,</p>
<p>cloak, mask, steering oar, and pretty boy.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the Etruscan words for wineskin flask, handled cup, jug,</p>
<p>and oil bottle also closely resemble the Greek words for such items.</p>
<p>But for purposes of the history of English, the most important thing the Etruscans borrowed</p>
<p>from the Greeks was not some words, it was the Greek alphabet.</p>
<p>Just as the Greeks had discovered and adopted the alphabet through their trading connections</p>
<p>with the Phoenicians, the same thing happened again here.</p>
<p>The Etruscans encountered the Greek traders, and they too discovered the alphabet which</p>
<p>the Greeks had been using for about a century.</p>
<p>So they did just what the Greeks had done.</p>
<p>They took the alphabet and they applied it to their language.</p>
<p>It appears that the Etruscans adopted the alphabet from the Greeks around 700 BC, maybe</p>
<p>a bit earlier.</p>
<p>And that was about a century after the Greeks had adopted it from the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>A writing tablet has been unearthed from an Etruscan tomb near Florence which dates to</p>
<p>around 660 BC.</p>
<p>And the tablet frame has 26 letters written from right to left.</p>
<p>And they are identical to the letters used in Western Greece which suggest that the Etruscans</p>
<p>borrowed the letters from the Greeks initially in their exact same form.</p>
<p>A clue as to the date of the inscription is the fact that the list of letters omits the</p>
<p>final Greek letter omega which appeared in the Greek alphabet around 660 BC.</p>
<p>Therefore this Etruscan tablet was likely created prior to that date, prior to 660 BC.</p>
<p>Now the Greek letter omega never made it to the Etruscan alphabet.</p>
<p>And the Etruscans eventually dropped five other Greek letters which represented sounds</p>
<p>that did not exist in Etruscan.</p>
<p>The Etruscan language apparently had no B sound, ba, no D sound, da, and no G sound,</p>
<p>ga.</p>
<p>Now linguists call these sounds voice stops and apparently Etruscans did not use voice</p>
<p>stops at all in their language.</p>
<p>Now there are unvoiced versions of those sounds.</p>
<p>The unvoiced version of B, ba, is P, pa.</p>
<p>And the unvoiced version of the D sound, da, is the T sound, ta.</p>
<p>And the unvoiced version of the G sound, ga, is the K sound, ka.</p>
<p>And the Etruscan language had all of these unvoiced sounds.</p>
<p>The P sound, the T sound, and the K sound.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ll remember back to the episode I did about the letter C, that&rsquo;s part of</p>
<p>what happened to that letter at this point.</p>
<p>Remember that the third letter in Greek was gamma and it had the G sound.</p>
<p>But as I just said, the Etruscans didn&rsquo;t have a G sound.</p>
<p>They only had the unvoiced version of that sound which was the K sound.</p>
<p>So the third letter, gamma, was pronounced by the Etruscans with a K sound because they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have a G sound.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s ultimately how the Romans inherited it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the third letter became the modern letter C in Latin and was used to represent</p>
<p>the K sound just as the Etruscans had used it.</p>
<p>And that was just one of the many changes which occurred to the alphabet during the</p>
<p>time that the Etruscans used it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll discuss those changes in much more detail in the alphabet series which I&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>releasing soon.</p>
<p>But the key here is that Greek was an Indo-European language and the Etruscan language was not.</p>
<p>So the Etruscans had to make changes to the alphabet to make it fit their language.</p>
<p>Now this was the same process that the Greeks had to go through when they tried to apply</p>
<p>the Phoenician alphabet to their language.</p>
<p>And when the Romans later borrowed the alphabet from the Etruscans, they also had to make</p>
<p>some significant changes.</p>
<p>Because at that point, the alphabet was moving from a non-Indo-European language, Etruscan,</p>
<p>to an Indo-European language, Latin.</p>
<p>So once again, changes had to be made to make the sounds work in that language.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting though that the alphabet has undergone relatively few changes by comparison</p>
<p>since the Romans adopted it.</p>
<p>And at least as it relates to English, that&rsquo;s partly due to the fact that English and Latin</p>
<p>are both Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>English didn&rsquo;t have to make a lot of changes to the Roman alphabet because both languages</p>
<p>generally have the same sounds.</p>
<p>I mean, there are some differences between Latin phonemes and Old English phonemes, but</p>
<p>compared to non-Indo-European languages, the differences were minimal.</p>
<p>And therefore, very few changes had to be made to the alphabet to make it fit English.</p>
<p>Now once the Etruscans had borrowed the alphabet from the Greeks and adapted it to their language,</p>
<p>it quickly spread throughout the Etruscan territory.</p>
<p>And this is a recurring theme at this point.</p>
<p>Just like in Greece, as soon as a new society discovered and borrowed the alphabet into</p>
<p>their language, literacy quickly spread throughout the society since the alphabet was so easy</p>
<p>to learn and master.</p>
<p>And because of the power and influence of the Etruscan civilization in Italy, especially</p>
<p>northern Italy, the alphabet quickly spread out from the Etruscan territory to the non-Etruscan</p>
<p>people who lived around them and throughout northern Italy.</p>
<p>And this included the Latin-speaking Romans to their south who inherited the alphabet</p>
<p>from the Etruscans around 600 BC.</p>
<p>So around 800 BC, the Greeks had borrowed the alphabet.</p>
<p>And around 700 BC, the Etruscans had borrowed it.</p>
<p>And around 600 BC, the Romans had borrowed it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re moving in hundred-year increments, and that illustrates how quickly the alphabet</p>
<p>was spreading throughout the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>One other quick note about Etruscan writing before we turn our attention back to the Romans.</p>
<p>The Etruscans wrote sentences in both directions, left to right and right to left, but they</p>
<p>preferred to write from right to left, like the original Phoenicians and the early Greeks</p>
<p>had done.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not until we get to the Romans that we finally see a consistent change to the</p>
<p>left-to-right style of writing that we use today.</p>
<p>So with the Etruscan civilization firmly entrenched in northwestern Italy, and with</p>
<p>a new alphabet for writing their language, we can now turn our attention back to the</p>
<p>early settlement to the south which was slowly emerging as the city of Rome.</p>
<p>But when we left Rome, it wasn&rsquo;t really a city yet.</p>
<p>We had some Indo-European tribes who spoke an early version of Latin, and they lived</p>
<p>in huts in the hills around the Tiber River in the area which would eventually become</p>
<p>Rome.</p>
<p>They herded sheep and cattle and maintained goats and pigs, and each of the seven hills</p>
<p>of Rome was probably a separate village at this early point.</p>
<p>But as the settlement or various settlements grew and began to emerge as an actual city,</p>
<p>it soon fell under the control of the powerful Etruscan civilization, which again was located</p>
<p>immediately to the north of the city.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unclear if early Rome was under Etruscan control from the very beginning of the settlement,</p>
<p>or if Etruscans invaded at some point as it began to grow, but we can say with some</p>
<p>certainty that Rome was governed by Etruscan kings by the time it emerged as an actual</p>
<p>city-state.</p>
<p>The Etruscan kings united the various settlements in the seven hills into an actual unified</p>
<p>city.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now at about 600 BC, and we can finally think of Rome as an actual city for the first</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no doubt that the Etruscans helped to develop the city of Rome.</p>
<p>The influence was so great during this early period that we can think of early Rome as</p>
<p>basically an Etruscan city.</p>
<p>Its leaders and its culture was essentially Etruscan.</p>
<p>But its inhabitants were Latin-speaking Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>And this dichotomy was bound to create long-term conflicts, which it ultimately did.</p>
<p>The city came to be known as Romulus, which as you may recall was the name which the later-day</p>
<p>Romans gave to the mythical king who supposedly built the city.</p>
<p>So the name Romulus had been around from the beginning, and you can probably see how the</p>
<p>later Romans would have incorporated it into their founding myth.</p>
<p>Now the Etruscans not only ruled over Rome, they also heavily influenced its early culture.</p>
<p>In fact, we often take note of the Greek influence on Roman culture, but the Etruscan influence</p>
<p>is often overlooked.</p>
<p>In military and political matters, the Romans borrowed heavily from the Etruscans.</p>
<p>They imitated the clothing of the Etruscan nobility, and in fact, one of the most iconic</p>
<p>symbols of the Roman army is the military standard topped with a bronze eagle.</p>
<p>But you might not know that the Romans actually borrowed that from the Etruscans.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a fan of Roman military history, you probably know that the Roman generals</p>
<p>famously wore scarlet military cloaks in battle.</p>
<p>And again, this idea was taken from the Etruscans.</p>
<p>Since we&rsquo;re talking about Etruscan influence on the Romans, and since this is a podcast</p>
<p>about the history of English, we now have to talk about the big event which happened</p>
<p>next, because we live with the consequences of this event every single day.</p>
<p>Around 600 BC, those Latin-speaking people in the settlement that we can now officially</p>
<p>call the New City of Rome, borrowed one more thing from the Etruscans, and that was the</p>
<p>alphabet.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the Etruscans had borrowed the alphabet from the Greeks around</p>
<p>700 BC, so the Romans had borrowed it from the Etruscans only a century later.</p>
<p>And even though the Etruscans hadn&rsquo;t been using the alphabet for very long, they had</p>
<p>made some significant changes to it in order to make it fit their non-Indo-European language.</p>
<p>But now the Romans were borrowing this modified alphabet from a non-Indo-European language</p>
<p>back into another Indo-European language, in this case Latin.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the alphabet is based entirely around the sounds, or phonemes, of</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>And when you move from one language family to another, the phonemes can change significantly.</p>
<p>And languages don&rsquo;t always share the same sounds, so some letters become useless, and</p>
<p>other letters have to be invented to make the alphabet fit the new language.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what those early Romans had to do when they took the alphabet from</p>
<p>the Etruscans.</p>
<p>And once the Romans were done with it, they had created an alphabet which is basically</p>
<p>the same alphabet which we use today in modern English.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s keep in mind that Rome was just a fledgling settlement that we can barely</p>
<p>call a city at this point, and it was ruled by Etruscan kings and was heavily influenced</p>
<p>by the neighboring Etruscan civilization which was now at its peak.</p>
<p>So these Latin-speaking people in and around Rome were just looking for a way to write</p>
<p>their own native language in this new form of writing called an alphabet.</p>
<p>And the Etruscans would have probably considered that very early version of Latin to be a semi-barbarian</p>
<p>language at the time.</p>
<p>But a ceramic wine container dated to around 620 BC has been found around Rome which contains</p>
<p>the Etruscan alphabet, but it spells words in Latin.</p>
<p>The inscription identifies the owner and the maker of the container.</p>
<p>And another inscription dating from the same time frame also contains Etruscan writing,</p>
<p>but again the words are Latin.</p>
<p>And this indicates that the Latin speakers had adopted, or were beginning to adopt, the</p>
<p>Etruscan alphabet by around 620 BC.</p>
<p>And from that date until around 250 BC, so around 350 years, historians and archaeologists</p>
<p>have discovered 650 inscriptions written in the early Latin alphabet.</p>
<p>Now in the case of the Greek and the Phoenician alphabets, we have letter lists.</p>
<p>In other words, we have their version of the ABCs in order from A or Aleph or Alpha to</p>
<p>the final letter in the alphabet.</p>
<p>Now if you think about it, there&rsquo;s no particular reason for having all of the letters organized</p>
<p>in a particular order, you know, A before B and B before C and so on.</p>
<p>But all languages with alphabets do it.</p>
<p>And linguists believe that the ordering of the letters in the alphabet is simply a memory</p>
<p>device.</p>
<p>It makes it easier to learn the letters if you can learn them all in a particular order.</p>
<p>And so one of the first things children do is they learn their ABCs in order.</p>
<p>However, out of all the early Latin inscriptions from 620 BC to 250 BC, there are no alphabet</p>
<p>lists.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost certain the Romans had them, because when the lists finally do appear later,</p>
<p>the letters are still in basically the same order which the Greeks and the Etruscans had</p>
<p>used.</p>
<p>But without a specific alphabet list, linguists have had to look closely at the surviving</p>
<p>inscriptions to determine how many letters the Romans were actually using.</p>
<p>And based on that research, it appears that the Romans were using 21 letters during this</p>
<p>period.</p>
<p>And the Etruscans had stopped using the Greek letter for the O sound, so the Romans brought</p>
<p>that letter back.</p>
<p>And remember that the Etruscan language didn&rsquo;t have a B sound or a D sound or a G sound.</p>
<p>But of course, Latin did have those sounds.</p>
<p>So the Romans reshuffled the forms and the sounds of the letters for those three sounds.</p>
<p>So as you may recall from an earlier episode, the third letter, which the Greeks had called</p>
<p>gamma with a G sound, now came into Latin with the Etruscan K sound, since the Etruscan</p>
<p>language didn&rsquo;t have a G sound.</p>
<p>So the third letter became the Roman letter C with a K sound.</p>
<p>But whereas the Etruscans didn&rsquo;t have a G sound, the Romans did have a G sound.</p>
<p>So they eventually had to create a new letter for the G sound, which became the Roman letter</p>
<p>G.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the uppercase C and the uppercase G resemble each other.</p>
<p>And there was also a reason why the new letter G was placed in the seventh position after</p>
<p>the letter F.</p>
<p>The seventh letter of the Etruscan alphabet had the Z or Zed sound, which the Etruscans</p>
<p>had borrowed from the Greeks.</p>
<p>But unlike Greek and Etruscan, early Latin didn&rsquo;t have the Z sound or the Zed sound.</p>
<p>So the seventh letter, called Zay by the Etruscans, was unnecessary in Latin.</p>
<p>So the Romans got rid of Zay and they put that new letter G in its place.</p>
<p>And of course the letter Zay would reappear during the classical Roman period when the</p>
<p>Romans started to borrow a lot of words from Greek and they suddenly needed to represent</p>
<p>that Z sound again.</p>
<p>So at that point they reintroduced the letter as Z or Zed and put it at the end of the alphabet.</p>
<p>I should also note that the Romans tinkered with the letter F as well.</p>
<p>Up to this point, the sixth letter of the alphabet represented the W sound, wuh, in</p>
<p>Greek and Etruscan.</p>
<p>And the Romans moved this sound nearer to the back of the alphabet and that freed up</p>
<p>the sixth letter.</p>
<p>Now the Greeks and Etruscans didn&rsquo;t actually have an F sound in their respective languages.</p>
<p>And remember from way back in an earlier episode that the Greeks had a P-F sound that was probably</p>
<p>a sound that was in transition from the original P sound to an F sound.</p>
<p>And you may remember that that was one of the sound changes which Jacob Grimm had also</p>
<p>noticed within the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the change that distinguishes the Germanic father from the Latin pater.</p>
<p>And you may remember that the Greeks had invented a new letter called Phi, or they probably</p>
<p>called it The, to cover that in-between P-F sound.</p>
<p>And that was as close as the Greeks actually came to an F sound.</p>
<p>But the Romans did have an F sound in Latin.</p>
<p>And that Greek sound Phi was by this point being pronounced simply as an F, just like</p>
<p>we do today in words like phone and philosophy, because that sound had completed its transition</p>
<p>to the F sound by this point.</p>
<p>So the Romans had to find a way to write the F sound since the alphabet that they borrowed</p>
<p>from the Etruscans did not have a letter for the F sound.</p>
<p>So they used that sixth letter which had previously represented the W sound but was</p>
<p>now free.</p>
<p>So our modern letter F with the F sound was born.</p>
<p>And the Romans decided to use that letter for native Latin words.</p>
<p>But for those Greek words which were being borrowed into Latin, they chose to use the</p>
<p>PH combination to represent the original Greek letter Phi.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we still have that PH spelling for the F sound in modern English.</p>
<p>It represents words that were borrowed into Latin from Greek which had that original Phi</p>
<p>letter to represent that in-between P-F sound.</p>
<p>Now these are just a few of the changes that the Romans made to the alphabet.</p>
<p>And the examples I just gave cover several centuries of Roman history.</p>
<p>So the Roman letter changes occurred over many years.</p>
<p>And this is a good point to mention again the alphabet series which I hope to have</p>
<p>available very shortly.</p>
<p>And that series will focus on all of these changes in much more detail.</p>
<p>But the basic point here is that the very early Romans borrowed the Etruscan alphabet</p>
<p>around 600 BC when Rome was barely a city.</p>
<p>And they began to modify the alphabet to make it fit Latin which was a quite different language</p>
<p>from the Etruscan language.</p>
<p>And much like the Etruscans and Greeks who preceded them, the early Romans wrote sentences</p>
<p>in both directions, right to left and left to right.</p>
<p>But over time, as I mentioned earlier, they settled on the same left to right approach</p>
<p>which we use today.</p>
<p>So now we have the emerging city-state of Rome, governed by Etruscan kings, infiltrated</p>
<p>with Etruscan culture, and using a modified Etruscan alphabet.</p>
<p>But the Romans, remember, were not Etruscans.</p>
<p>They were Latin-speaking Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>And the power in this relationship was almost ready to change hands.</p>
<p>So next time, I&rsquo;m going to look at the rise of Rome as an independent city-state, and</p>
<p>eventually as an imperial power.</p>
<p>And along the way, I&rsquo;m going to begin looking at Latin words and phrases from this period</p>
<p>which are still found in modern English.</p>
<p>So next time, it&rsquo;s all about the rise of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>So until then, thanks for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
