    <p>Before we jump into the episode, I have a quick announcement to make.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s hard to believe, but we&rsquo;re actually coming up on the one-year anniversary</p>
<p>of The Deck.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been kind of working on something kind of in secret in the background.</p>
<p>You see, in the middle of investigating all of these cases that we&rsquo;ve told you over</p>
<p>the last year, our reporter Emily and I stumbled across a case right here in Indiana that was</p>
<p>so wild, there was no way we could tell it in just one episode.</p>
<p>And there was no way we could leave it alone.</p>
<p>We became engrossed in this case and determined to try and solve it for the family.</p>
<p>So for the last year almost, we have been on the ground.</p>
<p>And I want to bring you that story in a special way, in a live documentary-style experience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I am hitting the road and going on tour for what I&rsquo;m calling The Deck Investigates.</p>
<p>There is so much to unpack and I promise I am going to blow you away.</p>
<p>Pre-sale for The Deck Investigates tour starts December 8th.</p>
<p>So if you want all the details, be sure to follow The Deck Podcast on Facebook, Instagram,</p>
<p>and Twitter.</p>
<p>And you can even text me at 317-733-7485 and I&rsquo;ll keep you up to date.</p>
<p>I also have all the tour dates on my website, ashleyflowers.com.</p>
<p>So stay in the know.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;m coming to a city near you and I&rsquo;ll see you soon.</p>
<p>All right, now let&rsquo;s get to this week&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>Our card this week is Dale Williams, the Jack of Hearts from Colorado.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1999, a small town was rattled by the disappearance of a dedicated father</p>
<p>and husband who seemed to vanish into thin air, inspiring an investigation by four law</p>
<p>enforcement agencies spanning more than 20 years.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s still cold today, investigators remain determined to find answers as new theories</p>
<p>and possible leads emerge from the decades of rumors surrounding the case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was the evening of May 27, 1999, when a woman named Diana Williams started to get</p>
<p>worried because she hadn&rsquo;t been able to contact her husband all day.</p>
<p>42-year-old Dale Williams was working at the auto body repair shop that he owned in the</p>
<p>rural town of Nucla, Colorado, and she had called him shortly after noon to see if he</p>
<p>had something to eat for lunch.</p>
<p>The phone rang and rang, but there was no answer.</p>
<p>And initially, this didn&rsquo;t make her panic because she figured that he was just busy</p>
<p>with a customer or the sounds of his tools drowned out her call.</p>
<p>Besides, she knew that she&rsquo;d get to talk to him when he got home for dinner that night.</p>
<p>But evening had come and Diana and their youngest daughter, 17-year-old Sarah, were still waiting</p>
<p>for Dale to come home.</p>
<p>So Diana tried to call the shop again, but again, Dale didn&rsquo;t pick up.</p>
<p>Now she&rsquo;s thinking maybe he just got caught up working on a car and was just running late.</p>
<p>So just to be sure, detectives told our reporter that Diana decided to let Sarah stay at home</p>
<p>while she went out to drive by the shop.</p>
<p>Now there is a slight discrepancy here.</p>
<p>Some other source material says that she didn&rsquo;t actually visit the shop until the next morning.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also some confusion on how the shop looked as well.</p>
<p>Now official reports from the investigation say that the shop was closed, lights off,</p>
<p>no cars around.</p>
<p>But people in Dale&rsquo;s family say that it looked like Dale had just walked away and was about</p>
<p>to come right back to work at any moment.</p>
<p>But one thing every source does agree on is that Diana didn&rsquo;t find any sign of Dale</p>
<p>or his 1994 white Ford pickup truck.</p>
<p>And that truck would have been hard to miss because it had the company&rsquo;s name and logo</p>
<p>on the side of it.</p>
<p>Diana was worried, but there was a thousand places Dale could have been and she knew she&rsquo;d</p>
<p>see him in the morning, if nothing else.</p>
<p>So she went home to her daughter and the two of them went to bed.</p>
<p>But morning came and went on Friday the 28th, and there were still no signs of Dale anywhere.</p>
<p>Diana was super worried at this point.</p>
<p>So a bit after noon, she decided to go look for him at the auto body shop one more time.</p>
<p>But again, he wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>So next, Diana went to Dale&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s house, her name&rsquo;s Ida, to see if maybe she&rsquo;d seen</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>But Ida hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>She hadn&rsquo;t even heard from him, which was actually even more concerning because Dale</p>
<p>pretty much talked to his mom on the phone every day.</p>
<p>Together, Diana and Ida started searching the town for Dale.</p>
<p>They called other family, other friends, and even drove around to local junkyards, all</p>
<p>while in the back of their minds wondering if maybe he had some kind of accident.</p>
<p>They searched high and low in the small town that towed the line of 1,000 residents.</p>
<p>And as they did, word was spreading fast.</p>
<p>Within hours, pretty much everyone knew Dale was missing, but no one knew where he was.</p>
<p>So after a few hours, they went to the Nucla Marshal&rsquo;s office to file a missing persons</p>
<p>report.</p>
<p>It was extremely rare for Nucla to have any missing people, so the Marshal&rsquo;s office put</p>
<p>in a request for help from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not a request that would get processed right away, especially because they were coming</p>
<p>up on Memorial Day weekend, so most of their offices were already closed.</p>
<p>So in order to not lose too much time while they waited for the CBI, the Marshal started</p>
<p>investigating throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>In any investigation, the first thing you want to do is get to know your victim.</p>
<p>And that was easy, because Dale was so well known around the small community.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s his oldest daughter, Toni, who was 19 years old and attending college out of</p>
<p>town when her father went missing.</p>
<p>He did a lot for the community.</p>
<p>He would help anybody that he could with anything from, like, jobs, car work.</p>
<p>He would deliver presents dressed up as Santa Claus to kids in the community.</p>
<p>He just did a lot.</p>
<p>He would do, like, auctioneer stuff for fundraising.</p>
<p>He drove the homecoming queens every year in the parade and out on the field.</p>
<p>And he was just a really fun dad.</p>
<p>We had a lot of really good times with him.</p>
<p>Dale wasn&rsquo;t just there for his community, but for his family as well.</p>
<p>Diana, Toni, and Sarah were extremely close to their dad, and he doted on them.</p>
<p>So everyone knew he wouldn&rsquo;t just leave them without a word.</p>
<p>Growing up, my dad, or my sister and I, were just pretty much everything for my dad.</p>
<p>We did a lot of, like, picnics and, like, four-wheel drive adventures that I can still</p>
<p>remember.</p>
<p>But he was a really incredible dad.</p>
<p>As the investigation kicked off, the community that Dale loved and supported for so long</p>
<p>was now stepping up to support his family and to help in the search for him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officers were checking out the body shop and talking to the people who came</p>
<p>forward with information.</p>
<p>The first man investigators talked to was a friend of Dale&rsquo;s and a local pastor, this</p>
<p>guy named Tom Ross.</p>
<p>He and his son, who was only a little kid at the time, were at Dale&rsquo;s body shop like</p>
<p>mid-morning on Thursday, the day that Dale disappeared.</p>
<p>Tom told officers that Dale had time for a break, so the two men played a game of darts</p>
<p>and just kind of caught up with one another.</p>
<p>And while they were hanging out, the shop phone rang at maybe around noon.</p>
<p>He said it was a call from someone who was stranded with a broken-down vehicle near Bedrock,</p>
<p>right outside of Paradox, Colorado.</p>
<p>This is about 40 minutes from Nucla.</p>
<p>Tom said that he overheard Dale say the location and mentioned bringing the tow truck before</p>
<p>he hung up.</p>
<p>He then told Tom he had to go, so they both left the shop and went their separate ways.</p>
<p>Now, the second person who came forward to police was a woman named Tammy Lorenz.</p>
<p>She told officers that Dale came to her work just after noon that day and said that he</p>
<p>needed to reschedule her appointment to replace her windshield from later that afternoon to</p>
<p>the next week.</p>
<p>She said he seemed like he was in a hurry and he left fairly quickly after they spoke.</p>
<p>This version of events continued to look legit when yet another witness told investigators</p>
<p>that they saw Dale&rsquo;s truck leaving town, heading towards the town of Natarita, which</p>
<p>is only a few miles south on the way to Bedrock.</p>
<p>But what really caught investigators&rsquo; attention is that this person saw Dale&rsquo;s white Ford,</p>
<p>but his tow truck, which he mentioned on the call that he would need to bring and which</p>
<p>anyone would need to bring for a broken down car.</p>
<p>While officers couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence of Dale&rsquo;s exact destination in Bedrock,</p>
<p>or if he ever made it there safely, they got another tip from a witness who said that they</p>
<p>saw him at a local grocery store in Natarita hours later, like around 6 p.m. on the 27th.</p>
<p>They were going in as he was leaving, and they exchanged a brief hello as they passed.</p>
<p>He said he appeared to be alone, and nothing in investigators&rsquo; reports indicated that</p>
<p>he had any belongings with him.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people were quick to question this sighting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re thinking that this witness had their days mixed up, because why would Dale disappear</p>
<p>from Nucla, stop at this store hours later, and then just disappear again?</p>
<p>But investigators actually confirmed that the witness was at the store that very evening</p>
<p>through a check that they had written to pay for their items.</p>
<p>Investigators had a lot of questions after this timeline came together.</p>
<p>The first was that Dale&rsquo;s shop was focused on bodywork, not necessarily mechanical issues.</p>
<p>So why would he be the one to go help someone having mechanical problems?</p>
<p>But his family has the answer to that question.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of people who aren&rsquo;t familiar with Nucla or small town communities kind</p>
<p>of misconstrue this information a lot.</p>
<p>So in Nucla, in any small town, there are people who have many talents and offer their</p>
<p>abilities and services to anybody that they can possibly help.</p>
<p>So even though my dad was an auto body man and would only work on the outside of cars</p>
<p>technically, he could also do some engine repair or things like that.</p>
<p>My dad would, just because, God, it&rsquo;s so annoying.</p>
<p>People are like, why didn&rsquo;t they just call AAA?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re in the armpit of America.</p>
<p>But if he really was just being a good Samaritan, why not take his tow truck?</p>
<p>And why in the world was he gone for so long?</p>
<p>I mean, remember, he allegedly left Nucla around 1230 in the afternoon, but the last</p>
<p>sighting of him was at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Also, did he stay in Natarita the whole time and never even make it to bedrock?</p>
<p>Or was he in bedrock for hours and hours and then stopped in Natarita on his way home?</p>
<p>And more importantly, where did he go after?</p>
<p>These questions left investigators&rsquo; heads spinning.</p>
<p>But luckily, the CBI was preparing to help and hopefully uncover some answers.</p>
<p>By the time CBI started processing the marshal&rsquo;s office request on Monday, May 31st, CBI cold</p>
<p>case unit analyst Audrey Simkin said the process moved fairly quickly.</p>
<p>So once the call came in from Nucla, it was run kind of through our process at the time</p>
<p>to determine if assistance could be provided.</p>
<p>And then ultimately it was determined that we could assist in the case.</p>
<p>And so an agent from our office went out to meet with the Nucla marshal&rsquo;s office and</p>
<p>kind of talk with them about the case.</p>
<p>The CBI agent arrived in Nucla on Wednesday, June 2nd, and immediately began catching up.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, they, along with local officers, had interviewed anyone who was even</p>
<p>slightly associated with Dale, which, again, was almost the entire town.</p>
<p>And at this point in the case, a few rumors were starting to pop up around town.</p>
<p>Some people were even saying that Dale may have been involved in illegal activity like</p>
<p>drug trafficking and was having financial problems.</p>
<p>But Audrey said that those were just rumors.</p>
<p>There were no legitimate signs that Dale was involved in anything suspicious.</p>
<p>It seemed like they interviewed people who were acquaintances of him and who may have</p>
<p>been involved in shady activity, but nothing indicated that he too was involved in that</p>
<p>shady activity, only that they knew each other.</p>
<p>Now if they were really tight or if it&rsquo;s a small town and they just knew of each other,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of the question.</p>
<p>But just to cover all their bases, officers also looked into the Williams&rsquo; financials.</p>
<p>But again, they didn&rsquo;t find anything suspicious.</p>
<p>They also looked at different properties in town that he owned, like his wife and him,</p>
<p>you know, worked at the video shop and kind of had that.</p>
<p>He had the body shop.</p>
<p>I think he had a couple of rental properties, but I didn&rsquo;t see any red flags that would</p>
<p>indicate the money transaction.</p>
<p>Also, it didn&rsquo;t seem like they were really well outside of their means as far as, you</p>
<p>know what I mean, with debts and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So ultimately, the rumors were yet another dead end for investigators.</p>
<p>And throughout the rest of June, the case really started to cool off.</p>
<p>Police weren&rsquo;t getting any new leads, even with the investigators&rsquo; dedication and the</p>
<p>formation of a task force made up of the marshal&rsquo;s office, the CBI, Montrose County Sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>office and the FBI.</p>
<p>But then on July 4th, they finally caught a huge break.</p>
<p>A local family called in and said they were out celebrating the holiday at this popular</p>
<p>spot where two rivers connect, the San Miguel and the Dolores rivers.</p>
<p>The family said they were swimming in this part because it&rsquo;s the deepest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 10 feet there.</p>
<p>And when they were there, they noticed something in the water, something really big sitting</p>
<p>at the bottom.</p>
<p>They swam around to investigate, and that&rsquo;s when they realized that it was a truck completely</p>
<p>submerged under the water.</p>
<p>Now, this area that they&rsquo;re in, this is like 20 miles from Nucla and Natarita, where Dale</p>
<p>was last seen.</p>
<p>But authorities rushed to check it out.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t tell much from their vantage point other than that the truck was white,</p>
<p>which was another checkmark ticked off for reasons that it could be Dale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But they needed to pull it out of the water to be sure.</p>
<p>Investigators called for backup from forensic teams and pulled the truck from the current.</p>
<p>And they were met with mixed emotions when they saw the logo running down the side.</p>
<p>There was no doubt this was Dale&rsquo;s truck.</p>
<p>There didn&rsquo;t seem to be any damage on the outside of the vehicle that wasn&rsquo;t caused</p>
<p>by the river, like nothing from an accident or anything like that.</p>
<p>But they noticed right away that his toolbox was missing.</p>
<p>Now, this wasn&rsquo;t like a little tin one that you carry around.</p>
<p>This was one of those long metal containers that went along the back of a truck and attached</p>
<p>to the bed.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t have been knocked off easily.</p>
<p>When they looked inside the truck, they saw that the keys were still in the ignition and</p>
<p>turned to the on position.</p>
<p>The steering wheel was jammed all the way to one side, and there weren&rsquo;t any signs</p>
<p>that the brakes had been used before it was submerged.</p>
<p>And there was something else off when they looked inside the truck.</p>
<p>There was no sign of Dale, no personal belongings or clothes, but also to their relief, no sign</p>
<p>of blood or injuries.</p>
<p>But then they noticed a detail that made some people close to Dale think that he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>in the car at all before it was put in the water.</p>
<p>See, the driver&rsquo;s side window was only halfway down.</p>
<p>And to Toni, this detail is crucial.</p>
<p>My dad had this weird thing about him where he would drive with the window all the way</p>
<p>up or all the way down, and it wasn&rsquo;t in between, you know, and that truck did not</p>
<p>have power windows.</p>
<p>It had the old roll down windows.</p>
<p>So when we found out that the window on the truck on the driver&rsquo;s side, well, and the</p>
<p>passenger side, I believe, was open a little too.</p>
<p>When we found out that it was not all the way down, we definitely knew that it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>my dad driving.</p>
<p>That was just one of his little quirks.</p>
<p>Officers searched the scene both in and out of the water, and they eventually found tire</p>
<p>tracks on the side of the embankment that matched the truck&rsquo;s tires.</p>
<p>Given that these tracks were still intact, investigators thought that the truck couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have been submerged the entire time Dale was missing, which was about six weeks at this</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>They thought either the tracks would have been erased or someone else would have come</p>
<p>across the truck before then.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t find anything else helpful in the river, definitely not the toolbox that</p>
<p>was missing.</p>
<p>So they did a more thorough exam on the truck itself.</p>
<p>But with the water damage and the limited technology of the 90s, they didn&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>anything else there either.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of July 1999, investigators kept circling back to their initial leads.</p>
<p>They were sure that the answers were somewhere in the clues that they already had.</p>
<p>But there was another lead investigators were still having trouble fleshing out.</p>
<p>That phone call that Dale got on the 27th, just before he left the shop.</p>
<p>Reports from officers&rsquo; investigations are kind of all over the place about this.</p>
<p>And Brooks Bennett, another investigator with the CBI, who is actually the lead detective</p>
<p>on the case with Audrey, says that none of the scenarios that they explored were ever</p>
<p>proven.</p>
<p>Basically everything they have, all rumors.</p>
<p>Some said that the FBI tracked the cell phone to an unknown woman who was later cleared</p>
<p>of any involvement, while others said that the call came from a stolen cell phone.</p>
<p>Now Brooks said that this call was investigated, quote, nine ways to Sunday by a lot of different</p>
<p>people, end quote.</p>
<p>But in the end, even trying to track the call was, and continues to be, a dead end.</p>
<p>And part of this may be because in Nucla in 1999, cell service was basically non-existent.</p>
<p>So while cell phones did exist, Tony says that it would have been even more rare for</p>
<p>someone to have one in this area.</p>
<p>I bet you that they hadn&rsquo;t had, like, real good cell coverage until, like, 2015, 16.</p>
<p>Where Paradox is located, it&rsquo;s in a really deep valley between mountains.</p>
<p>I would certainly be surprised if there&rsquo;s any cell coverage out there right now, really.</p>
<p>Now Tony says that the call actually came from a landline in the area, not a cell phone.</p>
<p>Now this theory hasn&rsquo;t been proven either, but this was just as hard for investigators</p>
<p>to look into because of the technology they had.</p>
<p>And then in Nucla, Nucla and Natarita, the telephone service was provided by the local</p>
<p>telephone company, not, you know, AT&amp;T and Grand Junction or anything like that.</p>
<p>We had our own little telephone company.</p>
<p>So from what I understand, talking to other investigators and stuff, that tracing the</p>
<p>call during that time in 1999 was a landline call, was nearly impossible.</p>
<p>And they wouldn&rsquo;t keep the records.</p>
<p>It would take until the year 2000 before there was any movement in the case.</p>
<p>And it stemmed from something weird that had been happening in Nucla.</p>
<p>You see, throughout that year, investigators had worked with Dale&rsquo;s family to absolutely</p>
<p>cover the town in missing persons flyers.</p>
<p>But as spring turned into summer, mysteriously, the flyers were disappearing.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t just like falling down randomly and floating around town.</p>
<p>They were straight up gone, like someone was ripping them down and tossing them out somewhere.</p>
<p>Officers decided to put up a surveillance camera at the local post office near one of</p>
<p>the flyers to figure out what was going on and maybe catch someone in the act.</p>
<p>And it worked.</p>
<p>A man was captured on video pulling the flyers down one by one.</p>
<p>Investigators didn&rsquo;t know the man seen in the video, so they showed the footage to</p>
<p>Dale&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>And when Diana saw it, she had to catch her breath.</p>
<p>He was a friend of theirs, or at least he used to be.</p>
<p>That man and his wife, who I&rsquo;ll just refer to as the Joneses, were both friends with</p>
<p>Dale and Diana until like 1998, when Mrs. Jones decided that she wanted out of her marriage.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any like specific abuse related here, just that maybe the relationship</p>
<p>was rocky, which I think was probably why she was seeking to move on.</p>
<p>So like any good friends would do, Dale and Diana supported Mrs. Jones through the divorce</p>
<p>and then secretly helped her leave the state that year.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t tell Mr. Jones where she went, so this guy was angry to say the least.</p>
<p>According to an episode of Unsolved Mysteries, Diana said that he let them know just how</p>
<p>angry about a month later when Dale found torn up photos of the couples together, along</p>
<p>with .22 caliber bullets scattered outside of his shop.</p>
<p>Diana said that this was even more concerning than it seemed on the surface because the</p>
<p>pictures and Dale&rsquo;s .22 caliber revolver had actually been stolen from his shop just</p>
<p>a couple of weeks prior.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, they don&rsquo;t know for sure if Mr. Jones was behind this, but all signs</p>
<p>kind of pointed to him, and the harassment just continued.</p>
<p>A few days later, someone put Dale&rsquo;s revolver in the drop box of the video store that Diana</p>
<p>managed.</p>
<p>She was freaked out, but Dale assured her that everything would be okay.</p>
<p>But now, now that he was missing, nothing was okay.</p>
<p>Investigators started looking into Mr. Jones and eventually interviewed him.</p>
<p>And this is where my timeline gets a little hazy.</p>
<p>My sources say that Mr. Jones was interviewed a total of four times throughout this investigation,</p>
<p>including one interview that was part of their initial efforts to talk to everyone in town.</p>
<p>But of course, that was before he had displayed any shady behavior like pulling the posters</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a lot of details from the interviews following the flyer incidents.</p>
<p>I know that he denied being involved in any of those threatening actions from before Dale</p>
<p>disappeared.</p>
<p>Of course, he couldn&rsquo;t deny tearing down the missing person flyers.</p>
<p>I mean, they had him on camera.</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t tough to deduce it&rsquo;s probably because he was still mad at Dale.</p>
<p>Eventually, he provided an alibi for when Dale went missing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t know what that alibi was.</p>
<p>Audrey and Brooks can&rsquo;t share that information as this is still an ongoing investigation</p>
<p>and some information has to be protected.</p>
<p>In my mind, though, this guy is super suspicious.</p>
<p>And thankfully, officers don&rsquo;t just like forget about him after this.</p>
<p>Remember, I said that he was interviewed a total of four times.</p>
<p>They did a little more digging on him and finally contacted the former Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>But she pretty much just confirmed everything Diana had told them and that was that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at this point that the case officially went cold.</p>
<p>For years, Dale&rsquo;s case sat on the shelf just collecting dust.</p>
<p>There were a few glimmers of hope here and there.</p>
<p>Like human skeletal remains were found in 2003 near Natarita.</p>
<p>But testing proved that they weren&rsquo;t Dale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And in 2006, someone found an empty toolbox off the side of the highway around the areas</p>
<p>that Dale would have been driving the day he went missing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important to note that the toolbox that was found was like a handheld toolbox,</p>
<p>not the one missing from the back of his truck.</p>
<p>But either way, they showed it to Dale&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p>And he actually said, yes, this was Dale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So they turned it over to police, but nothing came of that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still just sitting in evidence today.</p>
<p>Two years prior in July of 2004, Diana had Dale declared legally dead.</p>
<p>It was a heartbreaking decision, but something that was necessary for the family to clear</p>
<p>up some legal matters with bills and things like that.</p>
<p>Over the years, occasional tips and sightings came trickling in.</p>
<p>And although none of them ever panned out, it did make people wonder, had Dale just left?</p>
<p>To be sure that wasn&rsquo;t the case, investigators looked into his social security number in 2007.</p>
<p>Not for his case specifically, but in general, you can look to see like if anybody&rsquo;s used</p>
<p>a specific social security number.</p>
<p>So in some of the open source databases, you can kind of look to see if there&rsquo;s any connection</p>
<p>and who those people might be.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they&rsquo;re family members, right, who have a connection there.</p>
<p>But then you can also reach out and just see if there&rsquo;s been any wage report under that</p>
<p>social security number, which it looks like in 2007, maybe a tip came in saying, hey,</p>
<p>we saw him wherever.</p>
<p>And then as part of that, the analyst dug in a little deeper and noticed that the social</p>
<p>security number somehow was tied in that whatever she was looking at, but then was able to go</p>
<p>back and confirm that there was no employment and that whatever address or whatever she</p>
<p>was looking at was actually tied back to Diana and the girls, which, you know, maybe</p>
<p>there was something after the death certificate or whatever with that, which wouldn&rsquo;t be uncommon.</p>
<p>The next big push in the case came two years later.</p>
<p>The CBI had been off the case for years since it went cold, but in 2010, they received a</p>
<p>grant specifically to fund the review of cold cases, including Dale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So Audrey and Brooks both joined the case.</p>
<p>Now, with more time and resources, Brooks and Audrey got DNA swabs from Dale&rsquo;s mother,</p>
<p>brother and one of his daughters in 2012.</p>
<p>They also got a hold of his dental records and uploaded all of that information to CODIS.</p>
<p>So given the record keeping that&rsquo;s done with Dale&rsquo;s case, I&rsquo;m confident that if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>remains out there and those remains have been tested and gone through the necessary steps</p>
<p>to make sure that they&rsquo;re complete, right, and uploaded to CODIS, that we would get a</p>
<p>notification that we found him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we just aren&rsquo;t there yet.</p>
<p>Those remains, I don&rsquo;t believe, have been located.</p>
<p>Now, in 2013, Sarah and Tony were finally interviewed for the first time.</p>
<p>Brooks just wanted to start from scratch with the family, so he traveled to each of the</p>
<p>girls and talked with them.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t it bananas, or at least it was to me that they weren&rsquo;t interviewed before?</p>
<p>I mean, yes, Tony wasn&rsquo;t even in town when everything went down, but still, you&rsquo;d think</p>
<p>they would have interviewed anyone and everyone who could have had even the smallest bit of</p>
<p>insight into Dale&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Now, my sources say that investigators emailed back and forth with the family several times</p>
<p>in the early days of the case and even talked about scheduling formal interviews with every</p>
<p>member, but it just didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>The media kept the case in the public eye, especially with that unsolved mysteries feature,</p>
<p>which surrounded it with lots of media buzz for a while.</p>
<p>As with a lot of cases, this exposure sparked an online rumor mill that kind of spiraled.</p>
<p>I mean, every single person suddenly had a theory on what had happened to Dale and thought</p>
<p>that their theory was the right theory.</p>
<p>One person who commented on the unsolved mysteries webpage claimed that they saw a man</p>
<p>experiencing homelessness who looked like Dale in Sacramento, California.</p>
<p>Others said that Dale&rsquo;s body could have been thrown down some kind of abandoned mine shaft</p>
<p>that are scattered all throughout the region.</p>
<p>But Audrey says that they never had a concrete reason to believe that this was a viable theory</p>
<p>or any reason to search any mines.</p>
<p>So over the next few years, Audrey and Brooks spent their time raising awareness for Dale&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case.</p>
<p>In 2014, Dale was featured in Colorado&rsquo;s first cold case deck as the Jack of Hearts.</p>
<p>For the 20th anniversary of his disappearance, they put out media blasts and distributed</p>
<p>flyers in and around Nucla.</p>
<p>And in 2021, they even placed two billboards in Colorado with Dale&rsquo;s picture and information.</p>
<p>But even with all of these efforts, not one new lead emerged.</p>
<p>Today, the case is as cold as ever.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean things are silent or that Audrey and Brooks are slowing down anytime</p>
<p>soon, even with more than 400 other cold cases on their plates.</p>
<p>So really, it&rsquo;s going to be dependent on somebody coming forward now with new information</p>
<p>who, for whatever reason, feels more comfortable.</p>
<p>That probably blows this case open because, unfortunately, with us not having a lot of</p>
<p>physical evidence to tie anybody to anything, some of those new kind of traditional methods</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re used to seeing work probably aren&rsquo;t applicable here.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m hopeful that someday someone will say something, even if we don&rsquo;t find him,</p>
<p>that we find out what happened to him.</p>
<p>I mean, in the best world and the best circumstance, we&rsquo;d find him as well.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It only takes one little tiny crack to break a case wide open.</p>
<p>And Audrey and Brooks are chiseling at every weak spot they can find.</p>
<p>In fact, during our reporter&rsquo;s interview with Audrey, she came across a body found</p>
<p>on September 18, 2014, in one of the databases that could possibly be Dale.</p>
<p>But it was not in Colorado.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just across state lines in Utah.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want to blow this out of proportion because it looked like a lot of the John Doe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>information hadn&rsquo;t been uploaded yet.</p>
<p>But it opens up a new question.</p>
<p>Should the CBI be looking for matches and John Doe&rsquo;s in Utah as well as Colorado,</p>
<p>or maybe even beyond that?</p>
<p>Another area in Dale&rsquo;s case that Tony is really hoping will be explored is touch DNA</p>
<p>from Dale&rsquo;s truck.</p>
<p>According to Scientific American, it&rsquo;s named for the way it analyzes skin cells in places</p>
<p>where someone has touched a surface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a process that takes a few days, and seven or eight cells from the outermost layer</p>
<p>of skin must be collected and then tested to reveal a highly specific genetic portrait</p>
<p>of a person.</p>
<p>Seven or eight cells.</p>
<p>Can you even fathom that?</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>My sources say that while the truck is still in evidence, it&rsquo;s actually been stored</p>
<p>outside since it was found in 1999.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been exposed to decades of extreme weather and natural wear and tear.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s after it was underwater for who knows how long.</p>
<p>So all of that makes it a lot harder to test.</p>
<p>Brooks did have the truck fully re-examined after he took over the case, but they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any luck finding evidence inside or outside.</p>
<p>Tony, though, still hasn&rsquo;t given up on hope that the truth about her father&rsquo;s fate</p>
<p>will one day be revealed.</p>
<p>But she does believe that despite the online rumors, he isn&rsquo;t out there alive somewhere.</p>
<p>I think that he may have put together some information that may have been, that may</p>
<p>have gotten somebody else in some serious trouble.</p>
<p>And then they conjured up a plan to, you know, eliminate that.</p>
<p>And I think that he walked into a gunfight.</p>
<p>And I think they dumped his body before they dumped his truck.</p>
<p>I think they hid the truck for a bit, but I think they got rid of the body immediately.</p>
<p>And that was it.</p>
<p>I just think that, I think that he might be in the toolbox somewhere, you know, also.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think they may have put him in the toolbox and then, you know, discarded</p>
<p>the toolbox.</p>
<p>A lot of people still tag Sarah and Tony in a seemingly endless stream of tips online.</p>
<p>Some people on Reddit even claim that they were finding Dale&rsquo;s tools in the woods</p>
<p>along roads in the area, almost like they had been thrown from a vehicle.</p>
<p>And Tony says that some of these tools, engraved by Dale with a large D on their</p>
<p>handles, have actually been returned to her mom, who still lives in Nucla.</p>
<p>Now, my other sources couldn&rsquo;t confirm these claims.</p>
<p>But remember that toolbox that was found?</p>
<p>I mean, in my mind, it makes sense that if someone finds this empty container, the tools</p>
<p>that were inside had to turn up somewhere at some point, too, right?</p>
<p>Each spark of hope is just as bright for Tony and her family.</p>
<p>But each letdown just hits even harder.</p>
<p>But, I don&rsquo;t know, I feel like it&rsquo;s different because there hasn&rsquo;t been any closure.</p>
<p>And so, you know, no closure for me or my sister or anybody, anybody that my dad was</p>
<p>associated with or made an impact in their life has had closure.</p>
<p>And so this when a lot of people cared about him.</p>
<p>So when whoever did whatever they did, they didn&rsquo;t just affect his family.</p>
<p>You know, they affected a community.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been 23 years and it would be really nice to have some closure to this case.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But I at this point, I I want to see justice 100 percent.</p>
<p>And there was a time where I was like, you know, I just want to have closure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want justice.</p>
<p>I just want closure.</p>
<p>But the older I get, the angrier I get about it and more callous about it.</p>
<p>And I think that, boy, I just people got to meet their makers at one point.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re taking this to your grave, you&rsquo;re not going where you want to go.</p>
<p>So, you know, if people believe that way, so and most of them do down there.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t believe that people have lived with this that long,</p>
<p>this secret, knowing the trauma that it has caused people.</p>
<p>Today, Toni has three kids of her own,</p>
<p>and she often wonders what her father would be like as a grandparent.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine him being a very boring grandpa because of the way that</p>
<p>my sister and I grew up.</p>
<p>So I think that they would have really enjoyed him.</p>
<p>But I have like, you know, I have little memories of the trinkets and stuff like that</p>
<p>of my dad around the house and stuff.</p>
<p>And but my kids are older.</p>
<p>My daughter&rsquo;s 14 and then my boys are 20 and 21.</p>
<p>So, you know, the majority of their lifetime,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really, that&rsquo;s pretty, that&rsquo;s pretty hard because you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>since the case is still open and it&rsquo;s been investigated for the last 23 years,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s my son&rsquo;s entire life, you know?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, someone out there knows what happened to Dale.</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s been carrying the weight of that knowledge for more than two decades.</p>
<p>And Toni hopes that that person will come forward</p>
<p>and at least provide some resolution to the family that they stole from</p>
<p>all those years ago.</p>
<p>Well, the great thing is, is that they live in a small community</p>
<p>so they can physically see the pain and trauma that they have caused</p>
<p>in my family&rsquo;s life and friends.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m certainly glad that they enjoy their children and their grandchildren</p>
<p>because they have completely stolen that from our family.</p>
<p>Audrey and Brooks are looking for any remains that match Dale&rsquo;s description.</p>
<p>A white male with brown hair, blue eyes,</p>
<p>and scars under his chin and on his jawbones.</p>
<p>He also had a birthmark under his left jaw.</p>
<p>So if you know anything about remains,</p>
<p>even about that phone call that came in the day he went missing,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t hesitate to call the CBI Grand Junction Regional Office</p>
<p>at 970-248-7500.</p>
