    <p>The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram,</p>
<p>his second time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a computer scientist, mathematician,</p>
<p>theoretical physicist, and the founder and CEO</p>
<p>of Wolfram Research, a company behind Mathematica,</p>
<p>Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language,</p>
<p>and the new Wolfram Physics Project.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author of several books,</p>
<p>including A New Kind of Science, and the new book,</p>
<p>A Project to Find the Fundamental Theory of Physics.</p>
<p>This second round of our conversation is primarily focused</p>
<p>on this latter endeavor of searching for the physics</p>
<p>of our universe in simple rules that do their work</p>
<p>on hypergraphs and eventually generate the infrastructure</p>
<p>from which space, time, and all of modern physics can emerge.</p>
<p>Quick summary of the sponsors,</p>
<p>SimpliSafe, Sunbasket, and Masterclass.</p>
<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that to me,</p>
<p>the idea that seemingly infinite complexity can arise</p>
<p>from very simple rules and initial conditions</p>
<p>is one of the most beautiful and important</p>
<p>mathematical and philosophical mysteries in science.</p>
<p>I find that both cellular automata</p>
<p>and the hypergraph data structure</p>
<p>that Stephen and team are currently working on</p>
<p>to be the kind of simple, clear mathematical playground</p>
<p>within which fundamental ideas about intelligence,</p>
<p>consciousness, and the fundamental laws of physics</p>
<p>can be further developed in totally new ways.</p>
<p>In fact, I think I&rsquo;ll try to make a video or two</p>
<p>about the most beautiful aspects of these models</p>
<p>in the coming weeks, especially, I think,</p>
<p>trying to describe how fellow curious minds like myself</p>
<p>can jump in and explore them either just for fun</p>
<p>or potentially for publication of new innovative research</p>
<p>in math, computer science, and physics.</p>
<p>But honestly, I think the emerging complexity</p>
<p>in these hypergraphs can capture the imagination</p>
<p>of everyone, even if you&rsquo;re someone</p>
<p>who never really connected with mathematics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my hope, at least, to have these conversations</p>
<p>that inspire everyone to look up to the skies</p>
<p>and into our own minds in awe of our amazing universe.</p>
<p>Let me also mention that this is the first time</p>
<p>I ever recorded a podcast outdoors</p>
<p>as a kind of experiment to see if this is an option</p>
<p>in times of COVID.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if the audio is not great.</p>
<p>I did my best and promise to keep improving</p>
<p>and learning as always.</p>

<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do a few minutes of ads now</p>
<p>and no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I tried to make these interesting,</p>
<p>but I do give you timestamps, so you&rsquo;re welcome to skip,</p>
<p>but still, please do check out the sponsors</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>Also, let me say, even though I&rsquo;m talking way too much,</p>
<p>that I did a survey and it seems like over 90% of people</p>
<p>either enjoy these ad reads somehow magically</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t mind them, at least.</p>
<p>That honestly just warms my heart</p>
<p>that people are that supportive.</p>

<p>One of my favorite movies is Leon or The Professional</p>
<p>with Jean Reno, Gary Oldman,</p>
<p>and the brilliant young Natalie Portman.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen the movie,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a hit man with a minimalist life that resembles my own.</p>
<p>In fact, when I was younger, the idea of being a hit man</p>
<p>or targeting evil in a skilled way,</p>
<p>which is how I thought about it, really appealed to me.</p>
<p>The skill of it, the planning, the craftsmanship.</p>
<p>In another life, perhaps,</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t love engineering and science so much,</p>
<p>I could see myself being something like a Navy SEAL.</p>
<p>And in general, I love the idea of serving my country,</p>
<p>of serving society by contributing my skill</p>
<p>in some small way.</p>

<p>This is the last read of the trial they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>so this is the time to get them if you&rsquo;re considering it.</p>
<p>And if you do, it&rsquo;ll help ensure</p>
<p>that they decide to support this podcast long term.</p>
<p>Their meals are healthy and delicious,</p>
<p>a nice break from the minimalist meals of meat</p>
<p>and vegetables that I usually eat.</p>
<p>Maybe on a personal note,</p>
<p>one of my favorite things to do is watch people cook,</p>
<p>especially people who love cooking,</p>
<p>and hang out with people over amazing meals.</p>
<p>I still tend to be strict in my diet no matter what,</p>
<p>even in fancy restaurants,</p>
<p>but it brings me joy to see friends and family indulge</p>
<p>something like a cake that has way too many calories</p>
<p>or ice cream or whatever.</p>
<p>My mom, in fact, for much of my life,</p>
<p>made this cake called an anthill on my birthday</p>
<p>that brings me a lot of joy and way too many calories.</p>
<p>I was thinking of doing a video with my mom as she makes it.</p>
<p>I thought it&rsquo;d be a fun thing to do together.</p>
<p>Anyway, go to SunBasket.com slash Lex and use code LEX.</p>

<p>Masterclass has been a really special sponsor.</p>
<p>They believe in this podcast in a way that gives me strength</p>
<p>and motivation to take intellectual risks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of doing a few solo podcast episodes</p>
<p>on difficult topics, especially in history,</p>
<p>like the rise and fall of the Third Reich or Stalin, Putin,</p>
<p>and many other difficult topics that I&rsquo;m fascinated by.</p>
<p>I have a worldview that seeks inspiring positive insights,</p>
<p>even and perhaps especially from periods of tragedy and evil</p>
<p>that perhaps some folks may find value in.</p>
<p>If I can only learn to convey the ideas in my mind</p>
<p>as clearly as I think them.</p>
<p>I think deeply and rigorously and precisely,</p>
<p>but to be honest, have trouble speaking in a way</p>
<p>that reflects that rigor of thought.</p>
<p>So it really does mean a lot, the love and support I get</p>
<p>as I try to get better at this thing,</p>
<p>at this talking thing.</p>

<p>And now finally, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Stephen Wolfram.</p>
<p>You said that there are moments in history of physics</p>
<p>and maybe mathematical physics or even mathematics</p>
<p>where breakthroughs happen</p>
<p>and then a flurry of progress follows.</p>
<p>So if you look back through the history of physics,</p>
<p>what moments stand out to you as important such breakthroughs</p>
<p>where a flurry of progress follows?</p>
<p>So the big famous one was 1920s,</p>
<p>the invention of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>where in about five or 10 years,</p>
<p>lots of stuff got figured out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s now quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Can you mention the people involved?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was kind of the Schrodinger, Heisenberg,</p>
<p>Einstein had been a key figure, originally Planck,</p>
<p>then Dirac was a little bit later.</p>
<p>That was something that happened at that time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of before my time, right?</p>
<p>In my time was in the 1970s,</p>
<p>there was this sort of realization</p>
<p>that quantum field theory was actually going to be useful</p>
<p>in physics and QCD, quantum thermodynamics theory</p>
<p>of quarks and gluons and so on was really getting started.</p>
<p>And there was again, sort of big flurry of things</p>
<p>happened then, I happened to be a teenager at that time</p>
<p>and happened to be really involved in physics.</p>
<p>And so I got to be part of that, which was really cool.</p>
<p>Who were the key figures</p>
<p>aside from your young selves at that time?</p>
<p>You know, who won the Nobel Prize for QCD, okay?</p>
<p>People, David Gross, Frank Wilczek, you know, David Politzer.</p>
<p>The people who are the sort of the slightly older generation,</p>
<p>Dick Feynman, Murray Gellman, people like that,</p>
<p>who were Steve Weinberg, Gerhard Hoft, he&rsquo;s younger,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in the younger group actually.</p>
<p>But these are all, you know, characters who were involved.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s funny because those are all people</p>
<p>who are kind of in my time and I know them</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t seem like sort of historical,</p>
<p>you know, iconic figures.</p>
<p>They seem more like everyday characters, so to speak.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s always, you know, when you look at history</p>
<p>from long afterwards, it always seems like</p>
<p>everything happened instantly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s usually not the case.</p>
<p>There was usually a long buildup,</p>
<p>but usually there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some methodological thing happens</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of low hanging fruit</p>
<p>to be picked.</p>
<p>And that usually lasts five or 10 years.</p>
<p>You know, we see it today with machine learning</p>
<p>and, you know, deep learning neural nets and so on.</p>
<p>You know, methodological advance,</p>
<p>things actually started working in, you know, 2011, 2012</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s been this sort of rapid</p>
<p>picking of low hanging fruit, which is probably, you know,</p>
<p>some significant fraction of the way done, so to speak.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a key moment?</p>
<p>Like if I had to really introspect,</p>
<p>like what was the key moment</p>
<p>for the deep learning, quote unquote, revolution?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the AlexNet business.</p>
<p>AlexNet with ImageNet.</p>
<p>So is there something like that with physics</p>
<p>where, so deep learning neural networks</p>
<p>have been around for a long time.</p>
<p>Absolutely, since the 1940s, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of little pieces that came together</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden everybody&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Like, wow, there&rsquo;s something here.</p>
<p>Like even just looking at your own work,</p>
<p>just your thinking about the universe,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s simple rules can create complexity.</p>
<p>You know, at which point was there a thing</p>
<p>where your eyes light up?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wait a minute, there&rsquo;s something here.</p>
<p>Is it the very first idea</p>
<p>or is it some moment along the line of implementations</p>
<p>and experiments and so on?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of different stages to this.</p>
<p>I mean, one is the think about the world computationally.</p>
<p>Can we use programs instead of equations</p>
<p>to make models of the world?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that I got interested in</p>
<p>in the beginning of the 1980s.</p>
<p>I did a bunch of computer experiments.</p>
<p>When I first did them, I didn&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>I could see some significance to them,</p>
<p>but it took me a few years to really say,</p>
<p>wow, there&rsquo;s a big important phenomenon here</p>
<p>that lets sort of complex things arise</p>
<p>from very simple programs.</p>
<p>That kind of happened back in 1984 or so.</p>
<p>Then, you know, a bunch of other years go by,</p>
<p>then I start actually doing a lot</p>
<p>of much more systematic computer experiments and things</p>
<p>and find out that the, you know,</p>
<p>this phenomenon that I could only have said occurs</p>
<p>in one particular case</p>
<p>is actually something incredibly general.</p>
<p>And then that led me to this thing called</p>
<p>principle of computational equivalence.</p>
<p>And that was a long story.</p>
<p>And then, you know, as part of that process,</p>
<p>I was like, okay, you can make simple programs,</p>
<p>can make models of complicated things.</p>
<p>What about the whole universe?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our sort of ultimate example of a complicated thing.</p>
<p>And so I got to thinking, you know,</p>
<p>could we use these ideas to study fundamental physics?</p>
<p>You know, I happen to know a lot about,</p>
<p>you know, traditional fundamental physics.</p>
<p>My first, you know, I had a bunch of ideas</p>
<p>about how to do this in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>I made a bunch of technical progress.</p>
<p>I figured out a bunch of things</p>
<p>I thought were pretty interesting.</p>
<p>You know, I wrote about them back in 2002.</p>
<p>With the new kind of science</p>
<p>in the cellular automata world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s echoes in the cellular automata world</p>
<p>with your new Wolfram physics project.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to all that.</p>
<p>Allow me to sort of romanticize a little more</p>
<p>on the philosophy of science.</p>
<p>So Thomas Kuhn, philosopher of science,</p>
<p>describes that, you know, the progress in science</p>
<p>is made with these paradigm shifts.</p>
<p>And so to link on the sort of original line of discussion,</p>
<p>do you agree with this view</p>
<p>that there is revolutions in science</p>
<p>that just kind of flip the table?</p>
<p>What happens is it&rsquo;s a different way</p>
<p>of thinking about things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different methodology for studying things.</p>
<p>And that opens stuff up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this idea of,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a famous biographer,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s called the innovators.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a biographer of Steve Jobs, of Albert Einstein.</p>
<p>He also wrote a book,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called the innovators,</p>
<p>where he discusses how a lot of the innovations</p>
<p>in the history of computing has been done by groups.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a complicated group dynamic going on,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a romanticized notion</p>
<p>that the individual is at the core of the revolution.</p>
<p>Like where does your sense fall?</p>
<p>Is ultimately like one person responsible</p>
<p>for these revolutions that creates the spark</p>
<p>or one or two, whatever,</p>
<p>or is it just the big mush and mess and chaos</p>
<p>of people interacting, of personalities interacting?</p>
<p>I think it ends up being like many things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s leadership and there ends up being,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot easier for one person to have a crisp new idea</p>
<p>than it is for a big committee to have a crisp new idea.</p>
<p>And I think, but I think it can happen</p>
<p>that you have a great idea,</p>
<p>but the world isn&rsquo;t ready for it.</p>
<p>And you can, I mean, this has happened to me plenty, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you have an idea, it&rsquo;s actually a pretty good idea,</p>
<p>but things aren&rsquo;t ready,</p>
<p>either you&rsquo;re not really ready for it,</p>
<p>or the ambient world isn&rsquo;t ready for it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to get the thing to get traction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, when I look at a new kind of science,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now living inside the history,</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t tell the story of these decades,</p>
<p>but it seems like the new kind of science</p>
<p>has not had the revolutionary impact</p>
<p>I would think it might.</p>
<p>Like, it feels like at some point, of course it might be,</p>
<p>but it feels at some point people will return to that book</p>
<p>and say, that was something special here.</p>
<p>This was incredible.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Or do you think that&rsquo;s already happened?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, it&rsquo;s happened, except that people aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the sort of the heroism of it may not be there,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s happened is for 300 years,</p>
<p>people basically said,</p>
<p>if you want to make a model of things in the world,</p>
<p>mathematical equations are the best place to go.</p>
<p>Last 15 years, doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>New models that get made of things</p>
<p>most often are made with programs, not with equations.</p>
<p>Now, was that sort of going to happen anyway?</p>
<p>Was that a consequence of my particular work</p>
<p>and my particular book?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I am always amazed at the amounts of feedback</p>
<p>that I get from people where they say,</p>
<p>oh, by the way, I started doing this whole line of research</p>
<p>because I read your book, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, can you tell that</p>
<p>from the academic literature?</p>
<p>Was there a chain of academic references?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>One of the interesting side effects of publishing</p>
<p>in the way you did this tome</p>
<p>is it serves as an education tool and an inspiration</p>
<p>to hundreds of thousands, millions of people,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s not a single,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a chain of papers with spiffy titles,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t create a splash of citations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s had plenty of citations, but it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I think that people think of it as probably more,</p>
<p>you know, conceptual inspiration than kind of a,</p>
<p>you know, this is a line from here to here to here</p>
<p>in our particular field.</p>
<p>I think that the thing which I am disappointed by</p>
<p>and which will eventually happen</p>
<p>is this kind of study of the sort of pure computationalism,</p>
<p>this kind of study of the abstract behavior</p>
<p>of the computational universe.</p>
<p>That should be a big thing that lots of people do.</p>
<p>You mean in mathematics purely, almost like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like pure mathematics, but it isn&rsquo;t mathematics.</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t, it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new kind of mathematics.</p>
<p>Is it a new title of the book?</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the book is called that.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s not coincidental.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that I haven&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>really rigorous investigation</p>
<p>by thousands of people of this idea.</p>
<p>I mean, you look at your competition around rule 30.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>If you can say something.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect of this thing that could be predicted?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fundamental question of science.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the core.</p>
<p>Well, that has been a question of science.</p>
<p>I think that is some people&rsquo;s view of what science is about</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not clear that&rsquo;s the right view.</p>
<p>In fact, as we live through this pandemic</p>
<p>full of predictions and so on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting moment to be pondering</p>
<p>what science&rsquo;s actual role in those kinds of things is.</p>
<p>Or you think it&rsquo;s possible that in science,</p>
<p>clean, beautiful, simple prediction</p>
<p>may not even be possible in real systems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the open question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s open.</p>
<p>I think that question is answered and the answer is no.</p>
<p>Well, no, no.</p>
<p>The answer could be just humans are not smart enough yet.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t have the tools yet.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s sort of the big discovery</p>
<p>of this principle of computational equivalence of mine.</p>
<p>And this is something which is kind of a follow on</p>
<p>to G√∂del&rsquo;s theorem, to Turing&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>on the halting problem, all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>That there is this fundamental limitation</p>
<p>built into science,</p>
<p>this idea of computational irreducibility</p>
<p>that says that even though you may know the rules</p>
<p>by which something operates,</p>
<p>that does not mean that you can readily sort of</p>
<p>be smarter than it and jump ahead</p>
<p>and figure out what it&rsquo;s going to do.</p>
<p>Yes, but do you think there&rsquo;s a hope</p>
<p>for pockets of computational reducibility?</p>
<p>Computational reducibility.</p>
<p>And then a set of tools and mathematics</p>
<p>that help you discover such pockets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we live is in the pockets of reducibility.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, and this is one of the things</p>
<p>that sort of come out of this physics project</p>
<p>and actually something that, again,</p>
<p>I should have realized many years ago, but didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>is it could very well be that everything about the world</p>
<p>is computationally reducible and completely unpredictable.</p>
<p>But in our experience of the world,</p>
<p>there is at least some amount of prediction we can make.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because we have sort of chosen a slice of,</p>
<p>probably talk about this in much more detail,</p>
<p>but I mean, we&rsquo;ve kind of chosen a slice</p>
<p>of how to think about the universe</p>
<p>in which we can kind of sample</p>
<p>a certain amount of computational reducibility.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of where we exist.</p>
<p>And it may not be the whole story of how the universe is,</p>
<p>but it is the part of the universe that we care about</p>
<p>and we sort of operate in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, in science,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been sort of a very special case of that.</p>
<p>That is science has chosen to talk a lot about places</p>
<p>where there is this computational reducibility</p>
<p>that it can find, you know,</p>
<p>the motion of the planets can be more or less predicted.</p>
<p>You know, something about the weather</p>
<p>is much harder to predict.</p>
<p>Something about, you know, other kinds of things</p>
<p>that are much harder to predict.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, these are, but science has tended to,</p>
<p>you know, concentrate itself on places</p>
<p>where its methods have allowed successful prediction.</p>
<p>So you think rule 30, if we could linger on it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just such a beautiful, simple formulation</p>
<p>of the essential concept underlying</p>
<p>all the things we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s pockets of reducibility</p>
<p>inside rule 30?</p>
<p>Yes, that is the question of how big are they?</p>
<p>What will they allow you to say?</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, and figuring out where those pockets are,</p>
<p>I mean, in a sense, that&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s sort of a,</p>
<p>you know, that is an essential thing</p>
<p>that one would like to do in science.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, the important thing to realize</p>
<p>that has not been, you know, is that science,</p>
<p>if you just pick an arbitrary thing,</p>
<p>you say, what&rsquo;s the answer to this question?</p>
<p>That question may not be one</p>
<p>that has a computationally reducible answer.</p>
<p>That question, if you choose, you know,</p>
<p>if you walk along the series of questions</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got one that&rsquo;s reducible</p>
<p>and you get to another one that&rsquo;s nearby</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s reducible too,</p>
<p>if you stick to that kind of stick to the land,</p>
<p>so to speak, then you can go down this chain</p>
<p>of sort of reducible, answerable things.</p>
<p>But if you just say, I&rsquo;m just pick a question at random,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have my computer pick a question at random.</p>
<p>Most likely it&rsquo;s gonna be reducible.</p>
<p>Most likely it will be reducible.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re thrown in the world, so to speak,</p>
<p>we, you know, when we engineer things,</p>
<p>we tend to engineer things to sort of keep</p>
<p>in the zone of reducibility.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re throwing things by the natural world,</p>
<p>for example, not at all certain</p>
<p>that we will be kept in this kind of zone of reducibility.</p>
<p>Can we talk about this pandemic then?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>For a second, is a, so how do we,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s obviously huge amount of economic pain</p>
<p>that people are feeling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge incentive and medical pain,</p>
<p>health, just all kind of psychological.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge incentive to figure this out,</p>
<p>to walk along the trajectory of reducible, of reducibility.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of disparate data.</p>
<p>You know, people understand generally how viruses spread,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very complicated</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, there could be a lot of variability also,</p>
<p>like so many, obviously a nearly infinite number</p>
<p>of variables that represent human interaction.</p>
<p>And so you have to figure out,</p>
<p>from the perspective of reducibility,</p>
<p>figure out which variables are really important</p>
<p>in this kind of, from an epidemiological perspective.</p>
<p>So why aren&rsquo;t we, you kind of said</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re clearly failing.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s a complicated thing.</p>
<p>So, I mean, you know, when this pandemic started up,</p>
<p>you know, I happened to be in the middle</p>
<p>of being about to release this whole physics project thing,</p>
<p>but I thought, you know.</p>
<p>The timing is just cosmically absurd.</p>
<p>A little bit bizarre, but you know,</p>
<p>but I thought, you know,</p>
<p>I should do the public service thing of, you know,</p>
<p>trying to understand what I could about the pandemic.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;d been curating data about it</p>
<p>and all that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But, you know, so I started looking at the data</p>
<p>and started looking at modeling</p>
<p>and I decided it&rsquo;s just really hard.</p>
<p>You need to know a lot of stuff that we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about human interactions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually clear now that there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know about viruses</p>
<p>and about the way immunity works and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, I think what will come out in the end</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a certain amount of what happens</p>
<p>that we just kind of have to trace each step</p>
<p>and see what happens.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain amount of stuff</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s going to be a big narrative</p>
<p>about this happened because, you know, of T cell immunity.</p>
<p>This could happen because there&rsquo;s this whole giant</p>
<p>sort of field of asymptomatic viral stuff out there.</p>
<p>You know, there will be a narrative</p>
<p>and that narrative, whenever there&rsquo;s a narrative,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a sign of reducibility.</p>
<p>But when you just say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s from first principles figure out what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>then you can potentially be stuck</p>
<p>in this kind of a mess of irreducibility</p>
<p>where you just have to simulate each step</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t do that unless you know details about,</p>
<p>you know, human interaction networks</p>
<p>and so on and so on and so on.</p>
<p>The thing that has been very sort of frustrating to see</p>
<p>is the mismatch between people&rsquo;s expectations</p>
<p>about what science can deliver</p>
<p>and what science can actually deliver, so to speak.</p>
<p>Because people have this idea that, you know, it&rsquo;s science.</p>
<p>So there must be a definite answer</p>
<p>and we must be able to know that answer.</p>
<p>And, you know, this is, it is both, you know,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve, after you&rsquo;ve played around</p>
<p>with sort of little programs in the computational universe,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have that intuition anymore.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, I always, I&rsquo;m always fond of saying,</p>
<p>you know, the computational animals</p>
<p>are always smarter than you are.</p>
<p>That is, you know, you look at one of these things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, it can&rsquo;t possibly do such and such a thing.</p>
<p>Then you run it and it&rsquo;s like, wait a minute,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s doing that thing.</p>
<p>How does that work?</p>
<p>Okay, now I can go back and understand it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the brave thing about science</p>
<p>is that in the chaos of the irreducible universe,</p>
<p>we nevertheless persist to find those pockets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the whole point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, you say that the limits of science,</p>
<p>but that, you know, yes, it&rsquo;s highly limited,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a hope there.</p>
<p>And like, there&rsquo;s so many questions I want to ask here.</p>
<p>So one, you said narrative, which is really interesting.</p>
<p>So obviously from a, at every level of society,</p>
<p>you look at Twitter, everybody&rsquo;s constructing narratives</p>
<p>about the pandemic, about not just the pandemic,</p>
<p>but all the cultural tension that we&rsquo;re going through.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s narratives,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not necessarily connected</p>
<p>to the underlying reality of these systems.</p>
<p>So our human narratives, I don&rsquo;t even know if they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like those pockets of reducibility</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s like constructing things</p>
<p>that are not actually representative of reality,</p>
<p>and thereby not giving us like good solutions</p>
<p>to how to predict the system.</p>
<p>Look, it gets complicated because, you know,</p>
<p>people want to say, explain the pandemic to me,</p>
<p>explain what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>In the future.</p>
<p>Yes, but also, can you explain it?</p>
<p>Is there a story to tell?</p>
<p>What already happened in the past?</p>
<p>Yeah, or what&rsquo;s going to happen,</p>
<p>but I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s similar to sort of</p>
<p>explaining things in AI or in any computational system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, explain what happened.</p>
<p>Well, it could just be this happened</p>
<p>because of this detail and this detail and this detail,</p>
<p>and a million details,</p>
<p>and there isn&rsquo;t a big story to tell.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no kind of big arc of the story that says,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s because, you know, there&rsquo;s a viral field</p>
<p>that has these properties</p>
<p>and people start showing symptoms.</p>
<p>You know, when the seasons change,</p>
<p>people will show symptoms</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t even understand, you know,</p>
<p>seasonal variation of flu, for example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something where, you know,</p>
<p>there could be a big story,</p>
<p>or it could be just a zillion little details that mount up.</p>
<p>See, but, okay, let&rsquo;s pretend that this pandemic,</p>
<p>like the coronavirus, resembles something</p>
<p>like the 1D rule 30 cellular automata, okay?</p>
<p>So, I mean, that&rsquo;s how epidemiologists model virus spread.</p>
<p>Indeed, yes.</p>
<p>They sometimes use cellular automata, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, and okay, so you could say it&rsquo;s simplistic,</p>
<p>but okay, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s representative</p>
<p>of actually what happens.</p>
<p>You know, the dynamic of,</p>
<p>you have a graph,</p>
<p>it probably is closer to the hypergraph model.</p>
<p>It is, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, that&rsquo;s another funny thing.</p>
<p>As we were getting ready to release this physics project,</p>
<p>we realized that a bunch of things we&rsquo;d worked out</p>
<p>about foliations of causal graphs and things</p>
<p>were directly relevant to thinking about contact tracing.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And interactions with cell phones and so on,</p>
<p>which is really weird.</p>
<p>But like, it just feels like,</p>
<p>it feels like we should be able to get</p>
<p>some beautiful core insight about the spread</p>
<p>of this particular virus</p>
<p>on the hypergraph of human civilization, right?</p>
<p>I tried, I didn&rsquo;t manage to figure it out.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re one person.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, I think actually it&rsquo;s a funny thing</p>
<p>because it turns out the main model,</p>
<p>you know, this SIR model,</p>
<p>I only realized recently was invented by the grandfather</p>
<p>of a good friend of mine from high school.</p>
<p>So that was just a, you know, it&rsquo;s a weird thing, right?</p>
<p>The question is, you know, okay, so you know,</p>
<p>on this graph of how humans are connected,</p>
<p>you know something about what happens</p>
<p>if this happens and that happens.</p>
<p>That graph is made in complicated ways</p>
<p>that depends on all sorts of issues</p>
<p>that where we don&rsquo;t have the data</p>
<p>about how human society works well enough</p>
<p>to be able to make that graph.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually, one of my kids did a study</p>
<p>of sort of what happens on different kinds of graphs</p>
<p>and how robust are the results, okay?</p>
<p>His basic answer is there are a few general results</p>
<p>that you can get that are quite robust.</p>
<p>Like, you know, a small number of big gatherings</p>
<p>is worse than a large number of small gatherings, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite robust.</p>
<p>But when you ask more detailed questions,</p>
<p>it seemed like it just depends.</p>
<p>It depends on details.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s kind of telling you in that case,</p>
<p>you know, the irreducibility matters, so to speak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s not gonna be this kind of one</p>
<p>sort of master theorem that says,</p>
<p>and therefore this is how things are gonna work.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s a certain kind of,</p>
<p>from a graph perspective,</p>
<p>the certain kind of dynamic to human interaction.</p>
<p>So like large groups and small groups,</p>
<p>I think it matters who the groups are.</p>
<p>For example, you could imagine large,</p>
<p>depends how you define large,</p>
<p>but you can imagine groups of 30 people,</p>
<p>as long as they are cliques or whatever.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>As long as the outgoing degree of that graph is small</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>like you can imagine some beautiful underlying rule</p>
<p>of human dynamic interaction where I can still be happy,</p>
<p>where I can have a conversation with you</p>
<p>and a bunch of other people that mean a lot to me in my life</p>
<p>and then stay away from the bigger, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>not going to a Miley Cyrus concert or something like that</p>
<p>and figuring out mathematically some nice.</p>
<p>See, this is an interesting thing.</p>
<p>So I mean, this is the question of what you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>is kind of the problem of the many situations</p>
<p>where you would like to get away</p>
<p>from computational irreducibility.</p>
<p>A classic one in physics is thermodynamics.</p>
<p>The second law of thermodynamics,</p>
<p>the law that says entropy tends to increase things</p>
<p>that start orderly tend to get more disordered,</p>
<p>or which is also the thing that says,</p>
<p>given that you have a bunch of heat,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard, heat is the microscopic motion of molecules,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to turn that heat into systematic mechanical work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to just take something being hot</p>
<p>and turn that into, oh, all the atoms are gonna line up</p>
<p>in the bar of metal and the piece of metal</p>
<p>is gonna shoot in some direction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially the same problem</p>
<p>as how do you go from this computationally irreducible</p>
<p>mess of things happening</p>
<p>and get something you want out of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of mining, you&rsquo;re kind of,</p>
<p>now, actually I&rsquo;ve understood in recent years</p>
<p>that the story of thermodynamics</p>
<p>is actually precisely a story of computational irreducibility,</p>
<p>but it is a, it is already an analogy.</p>
<p>You can kind of see that as can you take the,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re asking to do there</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re asking to go from the kind of,</p>
<p>the mess of all these complicated human interactions</p>
<p>and all this kind of computational processes going on</p>
<p>and you say, I want to achieve</p>
<p>this particular thing out of it.</p>
<p>I want to kind of extract from the heat of what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I want to kind of extract this useful piece</p>
<p>of sort of mechanical work that I find helpful.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope for the pandemic?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about physics,</p>
<p>but for the pandemic, can that be extracted?</p>
<p>Do you think?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition?</p>
<p>The good news is the curves basically,</p>
<p>for reasons we don&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>the curves, the clearly measurable mortality curves</p>
<p>and so on for the Northern Hemisphere have gone down.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the bad news is that it could be a lot worse</p>
<p>for future viruses.</p>
<p>And what this pandemic revealed is we&rsquo;re highly unprepared</p>
<p>for the discovery of the pockets of reducibility</p>
<p>within a pandemic that&rsquo;s much more dangerous.</p>
<p>Well, my guess is the specific risk of viral pandemics,</p>
<p>you know, that the pure virology</p>
<p>and immunology of the thing,</p>
<p>this will cause that to advance to the point</p>
<p>where this particular risk</p>
<p>is probably considerably mitigated.</p>
<p>But is the structure of modern society robust</p>
<p>to all kinds of risks?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is clearly no.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s surprising to me the extent to which people,</p>
<p>as I say, it&rsquo;s kind of scary actually</p>
<p>how much people believe in science.</p>
<p>That is people say, oh, you know,</p>
<p>because the science says this, that and the other,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do this and this and this,</p>
<p>even though from a sort of common sense point of view,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit crazy and people are not prepared</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t really work in society</p>
<p>as it is for people to say,</p>
<p>well, actually we don&rsquo;t really know how the science works.</p>
<p>People say, well, tell us what to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, because then, yeah, what&rsquo;s the alternative?</p>
<p>For the masses, it&rsquo;s difficult to sit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to meditate on computational reducibility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to sit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to enjoy a good dinner meal</p>
<p>while knowing that you know nothing about the world.</p>
<p>Well, I think this is a place where, you know,</p>
<p>this is what politicians and political leaders do</p>
<p>for a living, so to speak,</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve got to make some decision about what to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Tell some narrative that while amidst the mystery</p>
<p>and knowing not much about the past or the future,</p>
<p>still telling a narrative that somehow gives people hope</p>
<p>that we know what the heck we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and get society through the issue.</p>
<p>You know, even though, you know,</p>
<p>the idea that we&rsquo;re just gonna, you know,</p>
<p>sort of be able to get the definitive answer from science</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna tell us exactly what to do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you know, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because let me point out that if that was possible,</p>
<p>if science could always tell us what to do,</p>
<p>then in a sense, our, you know,</p>
<p>that would be a big downer for our lives.</p>
<p>If science could always tell us</p>
<p>what the answer is gonna be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of fun to live one&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>and just sort of see what happens.</p>
<p>If one could always just say,</p>
<p>let me check my science.</p>
<p>Oh, I know, you know,</p>
<p>the result of everything is gonna be 42.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to live my life and do what I do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, we already know the answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually good news in a sense</p>
<p>that there is this phenomenon</p>
<p>of computational irreducibility</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t allow you to just sort of jump through time</p>
<p>and say, this is the answer, so to speak.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, so that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>The bad thing is it doesn&rsquo;t allow you to jump through time</p>
<p>and know what the answer is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re gonna be okay as a human civilization?</p>
<p>You said, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll prosper or destroy ourselves?</p>
<p>In general?</p>
<p>In general.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an optimist.</p>
<p>No, I think that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see, for example,</p>
<p>with this, you know, pandemic,</p>
<p>I, you know, to me, you know,</p>
<p>when you look at like organizations, for example,</p>
<p>you know, having some kind of perturbation,</p>
<p>some kick to the system,</p>
<p>usually the end result of that is actually quite good.</p>
<p>You know, unless it kills the system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually quite good usually.</p>
<p>And I think in this case, you know, people,</p>
<p>I mean, my impression, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little weird for me because, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a remote tech CEO for 30 years.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, you know, this is bizarrely, you know,</p>
<p>and the fact that, you know, like this coming to see you here</p>
<p>is the first time in six months that I&rsquo;ve been like,</p>
<p>you know, in a building other than my house, okay?</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m a kind of ridiculous outlier</p>
<p>in these kinds of things.</p>
<p>But overall, your sense is when you shake up the system</p>
<p>and throw in chaos that you challenge the system,</p>
<p>we humans emerge better.</p>
<p>Seems to be that way.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s to know?</p>
<p>I think that, you know, people, you know,</p>
<p>my sort of vague impression is that people are sort of,</p>
<p>you know, oh, what&rsquo;s actually important?</p>
<p>You know, what is worth caring about and so on?</p>
<p>And that seems to be something that perhaps is more,</p>
<p>you know, emergent in this kind of situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fascinating that on the individual level,</p>
<p>we have our own complex cognition.</p>
<p>We have consciousness, we have intelligence,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to figure out little puzzles.</p>
<p>And then that somehow creates this graph</p>
<p>of collective intelligence.</p>
<p>Well, we figure out, and then you throw in these viruses</p>
<p>of which there&rsquo;s millions different, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s entire taxonomy and the viruses are thrown</p>
<p>into the system of collective human intelligence.</p>
<p>And when little humans figure out what to do about it,</p>
<p>we get like, we tweet stuff about information.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s doctors as conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>And then we play with different information.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole of it is fascinating.</p>
<p>I am like you also very optimistic,</p>
<p>but you said the computational reducibility.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a fear of the darkness</p>
<p>of the uncertainty before us.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. And it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing is, if you knew everything,</p>
<p>it will be boring.</p>
<p>And it would be, and then, and worse than boring,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>It would reveal the pointlessness, so to speak.</p>
<p>And in a sense, the fact that there is</p>
<p>this computational irreducibility,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like as we live our lives, so to speak,</p>
<p>something is being achieved.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re computing what our lives, you know,</p>
<p>what happens in our lives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>So the computational reducibility is kind of like,</p>
<p>it gives the meaning to life.</p>
<p>It is the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Computational reducibility is the meaning of life.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>It gives it meaning, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s what causes it to not be something</p>
<p>where you can just say, you know,</p>
<p>you went through all those steps to live your life,</p>
<p>but we already knew what the answer was.</p>
<p>Hold on one second.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use my handy Wolfram Alpha sunburn</p>
<p>computation thing, so long as I can get network here.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Oh, actually, you know what?</p>
<p>It says sunburn unlikely.</p>
<p>This is a QA moment.</p>
<p>This is a good moment.</p>
<p>Okay, well, let me just check what it thinks.</p>
<p>See why it thinks that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like my intuition.</p>
<p>This is one of these cases where we can,</p>
<p>the question is, do we trust the science</p>
<p>or do we use common sense?</p>
<p>The UV thing is cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, well, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>This is a QA moment, as I say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, do we trust the product?</p>
<p>Yes, we trust the product, so.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be a data point either way.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m desperately sunburned,</p>
<p>I will send in an angry feedback.</p>
<p>Because we mentioned the concept so much</p>
<p>and a lot of people know it,</p>
<p>but can you say what computational reducibility is?</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>The question is, if you think about things</p>
<p>that happen as being computations,</p>
<p>you think about some process in physics,</p>
<p>something that you compute in mathematics, whatever else,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a computation in the sense it has definite rules.</p>
<p>You follow those rules.</p>
<p>You follow them many steps and you get some result.</p>
<p>So then the issue is,</p>
<p>if you look at all these different kinds of computations</p>
<p>that can happen,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re computations</p>
<p>that are happening in the natural world,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re happening in our brains,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re happening in our mathematics,</p>
<p>whatever else,</p>
<p>the big question is, how do these computations compare?</p>
<p>Is, are there dumb computations and smart computations</p>
<p>or are they somehow all equivalent?</p>
<p>And the thing that I kind of was sort of surprised to realize</p>
<p>from a bunch of experiments that I did in the early nineties</p>
<p>and now we have tons more evidence for it,</p>
<p>this thing I call the principle of computational equivalence,</p>
<p>which basically says, when one of these computations,</p>
<p>one of these processes that follows rules,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s doing something obviously simple,</p>
<p>then it has reached the sort of equivalent level</p>
<p>of computational sophistication of everything.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>That means that, you might say, gosh,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m studying this little tiny program on my computer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m studying this little thing in nature,</p>
<p>but I have my brain</p>
<p>and my brain is surely much smarter than that thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be able to systematically outrun</p>
<p>the computation that it does</p>
<p>because I have a more sophisticated computation</p>
<p>that I can do.</p>
<p>But what the principle of computational equivalence says</p>
<p>is that doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Our brains are doing computations</p>
<p>that are exactly equivalent to the kinds of computations</p>
<p>that are being done in all these other sorts of systems.</p>
<p>And so what consequences does that have?</p>
<p>Well, it means that we can&rsquo;t systematically</p>
<p>outrun these systems.</p>
<p>These systems are computationally irreducible</p>
<p>in the sense that there&rsquo;s no sort of shortcut</p>
<p>that we can make that jumps to the answer.</p>
<p>Now the general case.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>But the, so what has happened,</p>
<p>what science has become used to doing</p>
<p>is using the little sort of pockets</p>
<p>of computational reducibility,</p>
<p>which by the way are an inevitable consequence</p>
<p>of computational irreducibility,</p>
<p>that there have to be these pockets</p>
<p>scattered around of computational reducibility</p>
<p>to be able to find those particular cases</p>
<p>where you can jump ahead.</p>
<p>I mean, one thing sort of a little bit</p>
<p>of a parable type thing that I think is fun to tell.</p>
<p>If you look at ancient Babylon,</p>
<p>they were trying to predict three kinds of things.</p>
<p>They tried to predict where the planets would be,</p>
<p>what the weather would be like,</p>
<p>and who would win or lose a certain battle.</p>
<p>And they had no idea which of these things</p>
<p>would be more predictable than the other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>And it turns out where the planets are</p>
<p>is a piece of computational reducibility</p>
<p>that 300 years ago or so we pretty much cracked.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s been technically difficult</p>
<p>to get all the details right,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically, we got that.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s gonna win or lose the battle?</p>
<p>No, we didn&rsquo;t crack that one.</p>
<p>That one, that one, right.</p>
<p>Game theorists are trying.</p>
<p>Yes. And then the weather.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of halfway on that one.</p>
<p>Halfway?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we&rsquo;re doing okay on that one.</p>
<p>Long term climate, different story.</p>
<p>But the weather, we&rsquo;re much closer on that.</p>
<p>But do you think eventually we&rsquo;ll figure out the weather?</p>
<p>So do you think eventually most think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll figure out the local pockets in everything,</p>
<p>essentially the local pockets of reducibility?</p>
<p>No, I think that it&rsquo;s an interesting question,</p>
<p>but I think that there is an infinite collection</p>
<p>of these local pockets.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll never run out of local pockets.</p>
<p>And by the way, those local pockets</p>
<p>are where we build engineering, for example.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we, if we want to have a predictable life,</p>
<p>so to speak, then we have to build</p>
<p>in these sort of pockets of reducibility.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if we were sort of existing</p>
<p>in this kind of irreducible world,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d never be able to have definite things</p>
<p>to know what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>I have to say, I think one of the features,</p>
<p>when we look at sort of today from the future, so to speak,</p>
<p>I suspect one of the things where people will say</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe they didn&rsquo;t see that</p>
<p>is stuff to do with the following kind of thing.</p>
<p>So if we describe, oh, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>something like heat, for instance,</p>
<p>we say, oh, the air in here, it&rsquo;s this temperature,</p>
<p>this pressure, that&rsquo;s as much as we can say.</p>
<p>Otherwise, just a bunch of random molecules bouncing around.</p>
<p>People will say, I just can&rsquo;t believe they didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that there was all this detail</p>
<p>and how all these molecules were bouncing around</p>
<p>and they could make use of that.</p>
<p>And actually, I realized there&rsquo;s a thing</p>
<p>I realized last week, actually,</p>
<p>was a thing that people say, one of the scenarios</p>
<p>for the very long term history of our universe</p>
<p>is a so called heat death of the universe,</p>
<p>where basically everything just becomes</p>
<p>thermodynamically boring.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s just this big kind of gas</p>
<p>and thermal equilibrium.</p>
<p>People say, that&rsquo;s a really bad outcome.</p>
<p>But actually, it&rsquo;s not a really bad outcome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an outcome where there&rsquo;s all this computation going on</p>
<p>and all those individual gas molecules</p>
<p>are all bouncing around in very complicated ways</p>
<p>doing this very elaborate computation.</p>
<p>It just happens to be a computation that right now,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t found ways to understand.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t found ways, our brains haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and our mathematics and our science and so on,</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t found ways to tell an interesting story about that.</p>
<p>It just looks boring to us.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s a hopeful view</p>
<p>of the heat death, quote unquote, of the universe</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s actual beautiful complexity going on.</p>
<p>Similar to the kind of complexity we think of</p>
<p>that creates rich experience in human life and life on Earth.</p>
<p>So those little molecules interacting complex ways,</p>
<p>that could be intelligence in that, there could be.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, this is what you learn from this principle.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a hopeful message.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, this is what you kind of learn</p>
<p>from this principle of computational equivalence.</p>
<p>You learn it&rsquo;s both a message of sort of hope</p>
<p>and a message of kind of, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not as special as you think you are, so to speak.</p>
<p>I mean, because, you know, we imagine that</p>
<p>with sort of all the things we do with human intelligence</p>
<p>and all that kind of thing,</p>
<p>and all of the stuff we&rsquo;ve constructed in science,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re very special.</p>
<p>But actually it turns out, well, no, we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just doing computations</p>
<p>like things in nature do computations,</p>
<p>like those gas molecules do computations,</p>
<p>like the weather does computations.</p>
<p>The only thing about the computations that we do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really special is that we understand</p>
<p>what they are, so to speak.</p>
<p>In other words, we have a, you know,</p>
<p>to us they&rsquo;re special because kind of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re connected to our purposes,</p>
<p>our ways of thinking about things and so on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s some, but so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very human centric.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re just attached to this kind of thing.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk a little bit of physics.</p>
<p>Maybe let&rsquo;s ask the biggest question.</p>
<p>What is a theory of everything in general?</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, the question is,</p>
<p>can we kind of reduce what has been physics</p>
<p>as a something where we have to sort of pick away and say,</p>
<p>do we roughly know how the world works</p>
<p>to something where we have a complete formal theory</p>
<p>where we say, if we were to run this program</p>
<p>for long enough, we would reproduce everything,</p>
<p>you know, down to the fact that we&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>this conversation at this moment,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Any physical phenomena, any phenomena in this world?</p>
<p>Any phenomenon in the universe.</p>
<p>But the, you know, because of computational irreducibility,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not, you know, that&rsquo;s not something where you say,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;ve got the fundamental theory of everything.</p>
<p>Then, you know, tell me whether, you know,</p>
<p>lions are gonna eat tigers or something.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a, no, you have to run this thing</p>
<p>for, you know, 10 to the 500 steps or something</p>
<p>to know something like that, okay?</p>
<p>So at some moment, potentially, you say,</p>
<p>this is a rule and run this rule enough times</p>
<p>and you will get the whole universe, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it means to kind of have</p>
<p>a fundamental theory of physics as far as I&rsquo;m concerned</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve got this rule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s potentially quite simple.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know for sure it&rsquo;s simple,</p>
<p>but we have various reasons to believe it might be simple.</p>
<p>And then you say, okay, I&rsquo;m showing you this rule.</p>
<p>You just run it only 10 to the 500 times</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get everything.</p>
<p>In other words, you&rsquo;ve kind of reduced the problem</p>
<p>of physics to a problem of mathematics, so to speak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s as if, you know, you&rsquo;d like,</p>
<p>you generate the digits of pi.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a definite procedure.</p>
<p>You just generate them and it&rsquo;d be the same thing</p>
<p>if you have a fundamental theory of physics</p>
<p>of the kind that I&rsquo;m imagining, you know,</p>
<p>you get this rule and you just run it out</p>
<p>and you get everything that happens in the universe.</p>
<p>So a theory of everything is a mathematical framework</p>
<p>within which you can explain everything that happens</p>
<p>in the universe, it&rsquo;s kind of in a unified way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s a bunch of disparate modules of,</p>
<p>does it feel like if you create a rule</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about the Wolfram physics model,</p>
<p>which is fascinating, but if you have a simple set</p>
<p>of rules with a data structure, like a hypergraph,</p>
<p>does that feel like a satisfying theory of everything?</p>
<p>Because then you really run up against the irreducibility,</p>
<p>computational irreducibility.</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s a really interesting question.</p>
<p>So I, you know, what I thought was gonna happen</p>
<p>is I thought we, you know, I thought we had a pretty good,</p>
<p>I had a pretty good idea for what the structure</p>
<p>of this sort of theory that sort of underneath space</p>
<p>and time and so on might be like.</p>
<p>And I thought, gosh, you know, in my lifetime,</p>
<p>so to speak, we might be able to figure out what happens</p>
<p>in the first 10 to the minus 100 seconds of the universe.</p>
<p>And that would be cool, but it&rsquo;s pretty far away</p>
<p>from anything that we can see today.</p>
<p>And it will be hard to test whether that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>and so on and so on and so on.</p>
<p>To my huge surprise, although it should have been obvious</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s embarrassing that it wasn&rsquo;t obvious to me,</p>
<p>but to my huge surprise,</p>
<p>we managed to get unbelievably much further than that.</p>
<p>And basically what happened is that it turns out</p>
<p>that even though there&rsquo;s this kind of bed</p>
<p>of computational irreducibility,</p>
<p>that sort of these, all these simple rules run into,</p>
<p>there are certain pieces of computational reducibility</p>
<p>that quite generically occur</p>
<p>for large classes of these rules.</p>
<p>And, and this is the really exciting thing</p>
<p>as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,</p>
<p>the big pieces of computational reducibility</p>
<p>are basically the pillars of 20th century physics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the amazing thing,</p>
<p>that general relativity and quantum field theory</p>
<p>is sort of the pillars of 20th century physics</p>
<p>turn out to be precisely the stuff you can say.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot you can&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot that&rsquo;s kind of at this irreducible level</p>
<p>where you kind of don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen,</p>
<p>you have to run it, you know,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t run it within our universe,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the thing is there are things you can say</p>
<p>and the things you can say turn out to be very beautifully</p>
<p>exactly the structure that was found</p>
<p>in 20th century physics,</p>
<p>namely general relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>And general relativity and quantum mechanics</p>
<p>are these pockets of reducibility that we think of as,</p>
<p>that 20th century physics</p>
<p>is essentially pockets of reducibility.</p>
<p>And then it is incredibly surprising</p>
<p>that any kind of model that&rsquo;s generative</p>
<p>from simple rules would have such pockets.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think what&rsquo;s surprising</p>
<p>is we didn&rsquo;t know where those things came from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like general relativity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very nice mathematically elegant theory.</p>
<p>Why is it true?</p>
<p>You know, quantum mechanics, why is it true?</p>
<p>What we realized is that from this,</p>
<p>that these theories are generic</p>
<p>to a huge class of systems</p>
<p>that have these particular</p>
<p>very unstructured underlying rules.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing that is sort of remarkable</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the thing to me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s really beautiful.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, and the thing that&rsquo;s even more beautiful</p>
<p>is that it turns out that, you know,</p>
<p>people have been struggling for a long time.</p>
<p>You know, how does general relativity theory of gravity</p>
<p>relate to quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>They seem to have all kinds of incompatibilities.</p>
<p>It turns out what we realized is</p>
<p>at some level they are the same theory.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just great as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<p>So maybe like taking a little step back</p>
<p>from your perspective, not from the low,</p>
<p>not from the beautiful hypergraph,</p>
<p>well, from physics model perspective,</p>
<p>but from the perspective of 20th century physics,</p>
<p>what is general relativity?</p>
<p>What is quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>How do you think about these two theories</p>
<p>from the context of the theory of everything?</p>
<p>Like just even definition.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.</p>
<p>So I mean, you know, a little bit of history of physics,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So, I mean the, you know, okay,</p>
<p>very, very quick history of this, right?</p>
<p>So, I mean, you know, physics, you know,</p>
<p>in ancient Greek times, people basically said,</p>
<p>we can just figure out how the world works.</p>
<p>As you know, we&rsquo;re philosophers,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna figure out how the world works.</p>
<p>You know, some philosophers thought there were atoms.</p>
<p>Some philosophers thought there were,</p>
<p>you know, continuous flows of things.</p>
<p>People had different ideas about how the world works.</p>
<p>And they tried to just say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna construct this idea of how the world works.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t really have sort of notions</p>
<p>of doing experiments and so on quite the same way</p>
<p>as developed later.</p>
<p>So that was sort of an early tradition</p>
<p>for thinking about sort of models of the world.</p>
<p>Then by the time of 1600s, time of Galileo and then Newton,</p>
<p>sort of the big idea there was, you know,</p>
<p>title of Newton&rsquo;s book, you know, Principia Mathematica,</p>
<p>mathematical principles of natural philosophy.</p>
<p>We can use mathematics to understand natural philosophy,</p>
<p>to understand things about the way the world works.</p>
<p>And so that then led to this kind of idea that, you know,</p>
<p>we can write down a mathematical equation</p>
<p>and have that represent how the world works.</p>
<p>So Newton&rsquo;s one of his most famous ones</p>
<p>is his universal law of gravity,</p>
<p>inverse square law of gravity</p>
<p>that allowed him to compute all sorts of features</p>
<p>of the planets and so on.</p>
<p>Although some of them he got wrong</p>
<p>and it took another hundred years</p>
<p>for people to actually be able to do the math</p>
<p>to the level that was needed.</p>
<p>But so that had been this sort of tradition</p>
<p>was we write down these mathematical equations.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know where these equations come from.</p>
<p>We write them down.</p>
<p>Then we figure out, we work out the consequences</p>
<p>and we say, yes, that agrees with what we actually observe</p>
<p>in astronomy or something like this.</p>
<p>So that tradition continued.</p>
<p>And then the first of these two</p>
<p>sort of great 20th century innovations was,</p>
<p>well, the history is actually a little bit more complicated,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say that there were two,</p>
<p>quantum mechanics and general relativity.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics kind of 1900</p>
<p>was kind of the very early stuff done by Planck</p>
<p>that led to the idea of photons, particles of light.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s take general relativity first.</p>
<p>One feature of the story is that special relativity</p>
<p>thing Einstein invented in 1905</p>
<p>was something which surprisingly</p>
<p>was a kind of logically invented theory.</p>
<p>It was not a theory where it was something where</p>
<p>given these ideas that were sort of axiomatically</p>
<p>thought to be true about the world,</p>
<p>it followed that such and such a thing would be the case.</p>
<p>It was a little bit different</p>
<p>from the kind of methodological structure</p>
<p>of some existing theories in the more recent times,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just been, we write down an equation</p>
<p>and we find out that it works.</p>
<p>So what happened there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some reasoning about the light.</p>
<p>The basic idea was the speed of light</p>
<p>appears to be constant.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re traveling very fast,</p>
<p>you shine a flashlight, the light will come out.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re going at half the speed of light,</p>
<p>the light doesn&rsquo;t come out of your flashlight</p>
<p>at one and a half times the speed of light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still just the speed of light.</p>
<p>And to make that work,</p>
<p>you have to change your view of how space and time work</p>
<p>to be able to account for the fact</p>
<p>that when you&rsquo;re going faster,</p>
<p>it appears that length is foreshortened</p>
<p>and time is dilated and things like this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s special relativity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s special relativity.</p>
<p>So then Einstein went on with sort of</p>
<p>vaguely similar kinds of thinking.</p>
<p>In 1915, invented general relativity,</p>
<p>which is the theory of gravity.</p>
<p>And the basic point of general relativity</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a theory that says,</p>
<p>when there is mass in space, space is curved.</p>
<p>And what does that mean?</p>
<p>Usually you think of what&rsquo;s the shortest distance</p>
<p>between two points.</p>
<p>Like ordinarily on a plane in space, it&rsquo;s a straight line.</p>
<p>Photons, light goes in straight lines.</p>
<p>Well, then the question is,</p>
<p>is if you have a curved surface,</p>
<p>a straight line is no longer straight.</p>
<p>On the surface of the earth,</p>
<p>the shortest distance between two points is a great circle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a circle.</p>
<p>So, you know, Einstein&rsquo;s observation was</p>
<p>maybe the physical structure of space</p>
<p>is such that space is curved.</p>
<p>So the shortest distance between two points,</p>
<p>the path, the straight line in quotes,</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be straight anymore.</p>
<p>And in particular, if a photon is, you know,</p>
<p>traveling near the sun or something,</p>
<p>or if a particle is going,</p>
<p>something is traveling near the sun,</p>
<p>maybe the shortest path will be one</p>
<p>that is something which looks curved to us</p>
<p>because it seems curved to us</p>
<p>because space has been deformed by the presence of mass</p>
<p>associated with that massive object.</p>
<p>So the kind of the idea there is,</p>
<p>think of the structure of space</p>
<p>as being a dynamical changing kind of thing.</p>
<p>But then what Einstein did</p>
<p>was he wrote down these differential equations</p>
<p>that basically represented the curvature of space</p>
<p>and its response to the presence of mass and energy.</p>
<p>And that ultimately is connected to the force of gravity,</p>
<p>which is one of the forces that seems to,</p>
<p>based on its strength,</p>
<p>operate on a different scale than some of the other forces.</p>
<p>So it operates in a scale that&rsquo;s very large.</p>
<p>What happens there is just this curvature of space,</p>
<p>which causes, you know, the paths of objects to be deflected.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what gravity does.</p>
<p>It causes the paths of objects to be deflected.</p>
<p>And this is an explanation for gravity, so to speak.</p>
<p>And the surprise is that from 1915 until today,</p>
<p>everything that we&rsquo;ve measured about gravity</p>
<p>precisely agrees with general relativity.</p>
<p>And that, you know, it wasn&rsquo;t clear black holes</p>
<p>were sort of a predict,</p>
<p>well, actually the expansion of the universe</p>
<p>was an early potential prediction,</p>
<p>although Einstein tried to sort of patch up his equations</p>
<p>to make it not cause the universe to expand,</p>
<p>because it was kind of so obvious</p>
<p>the universe wasn&rsquo;t expanding.</p>
<p>And, you know, it turns out it was expanding</p>
<p>and he should have just trusted the equations.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a lesson for those of us</p>
<p>interested in making fundamental theories of physics</p>
<p>is you should trust your theory and not try and patch it</p>
<p>because of something that you think might be the case</p>
<p>that might turn out not to be the case.</p>
<p>Even if the theory says something crazy is happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Like the universe is expanding.</p>
<p>Like the universe is expanding, right, which is,</p>
<p>but, you know, then it took until the 1940s,</p>
<p>probably even really until the 1960s,</p>
<p>until people understood that black holes</p>
<p>were a consequence of general relativity and so on.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, you know, the big surprise has been</p>
<p>that so far this theory of gravity has perfectly agreed</p>
<p>with, you know, these collisions of black holes</p>
<p>seen by their gravitational waves, you know,</p>
<p>it all just works.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been kind of one pillar of the story of physics</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mathematically complicated to work out</p>
<p>the consequences of general relativity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s no, I mean,</p>
<p>and some things are kind of squiggly and complicated.</p>
<p>Like people believe, you know, energy is conserved.</p>
<p>Okay, well, energy conservation doesn&rsquo;t really work</p>
<p>in general activity in the same way as it ordinarily does.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all a big mathematical story</p>
<p>of how you actually nail down something that is definitive</p>
<p>that you can talk about it and not specific to the,</p>
<p>you know, reference frames you&rsquo;re operating in</p>
<p>and so on and so on and so on.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, general relativity is a straight shot</p>
<p>in the sense that you have this theory,</p>
<p>you work out its consequences.</p>
<p>And that theory is useful in terms of basic science</p>
<p>and trying to understand the way black holes work,</p>
<p>the way the creation of galaxies work,</p>
<p>sort of all of these kinds of cosmological things,</p>
<p>understanding what happened, like you said, at the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Yeah. Like all those kinds of,</p>
<p>well, no, not at the Big Bang actually, right?</p>
<p>But the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, features of the expansion of the universe, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, and there are lots of details</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t quite know how it&rsquo;s working, you know,</p>
<p>is there, you know, where&rsquo;s the dark matter,</p>
<p>is there dark energy, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, the, you know,</p>
<p>the testable features of general relativity,</p>
<p>it all works very beautifully.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in a sense, it is mathematically sophisticated,</p>
<p>but it is not conceptually hard to understand in some sense.</p>
<p>Okay. So that&rsquo;s general relativity.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s its friendly neighbor, like you said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two theories, quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Right. So quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>the sort of the way that that originated was,</p>
<p>one question was, is the world continuous or is it discrete?</p>
<p>You know, in ancient Greek times,</p>
<p>people have been debating this.</p>
<p>People debated it, you know, throughout history.</p>
<p>Is light made of waves?</p>
<p>Is it continuous? Is it discrete?</p>
<p>Is it made of particles, corpuscles, whatever.</p>
<p>You know, what had become clear in the 1800s is that atoms,</p>
<p>that, you know, materials are made of discrete atoms.</p>
<p>You know, when you take some water,</p>
<p>the water is not a continuous fluid,</p>
<p>even though it seems like a continuous fluid</p>
<p>to us at our scale.</p>
<p>But if you say, let&rsquo;s look at it,</p>
<p>smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller scale,</p>
<p>eventually you get down to these, you know,</p>
<p>these molecules and then atoms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made of discrete things.</p>
<p>The question is sort of how important is this discreteness?</p>
<p>Just what&rsquo;s discrete, what&rsquo;s not discrete?</p>
<p>Is energy discrete?</p>
<p>Is, you know, what&rsquo;s discrete, what&rsquo;s not?</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Does it have mass?</p>
<p>Those kinds of questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, right.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a question, I mean, for example,</p>
<p>is mass discrete is an interesting question,</p>
<p>which is now something we can address.</p>
<p>But, you know, what happened in the coming up to the 1920s,</p>
<p>there was this kind of mathematical theory developed</p>
<p>that could explain certain kinds of discreteness</p>
<p>in particularly in features of atoms and so on.</p>
<p>And, you know, what developed was this mathematical theory</p>
<p>that was the theory of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>theory of wave functions, Schrodinger&rsquo;s equation,</p>
<p>things like this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mathematical theory that allows you to calculate</p>
<p>lots of features of the microscopic world,</p>
<p>lots of things about how atoms work,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, the calculations all work just great.</p>
<p>The question of what does it really mean</p>
<p>is a complicated question.</p>
<p>Now, I mean, to just explain a little bit historically,</p>
<p>the, you know, the early calculations of things like atoms</p>
<p>worked great in 1920s, 1930s and so on.</p>
<p>There was always a problem.</p>
<p>There were, in quantum field theory,</p>
<p>which is a theory of, in quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with a certain number of electrons</p>
<p>and you fix the number of electrons.</p>
<p>You say, I&rsquo;m dealing with a two electron thing.</p>
<p>In quantum field theory,</p>
<p>you allow for particles being created and destroyed.</p>
<p>So you can emit a photon that didn&rsquo;t exist before.</p>
<p>You can absorb a photon, things like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a more complicated,</p>
<p>mathematically complicated theory.</p>
<p>And it had all kinds of mathematical issues</p>
<p>and all kinds of infinities that cropped up.</p>
<p>And it was finally figured out more or less</p>
<p>how to get rid of those.</p>
<p>But there were only certain ways of doing the calculations</p>
<p>and those didn&rsquo;t work for atomic nuclei among other things.</p>
<p>And that led to a lot of development up until the 1960s</p>
<p>of alternative ideas for how one could understand</p>
<p>what was happening in atomic nuclei, et cetera,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>End result, in the end,</p>
<p>the kind of most quotes obvious mathematical structure</p>
<p>of quantum field theory seems to work.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s mathematically difficult to deal with,</p>
<p>but you can calculate all kinds of things.</p>
<p>You can calculate to a dozen decimal places,</p>
<p>certain things, you can measure them.</p>
<p>It all works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all beautiful.</p>
<p>Now you say&hellip;</p>
<p>The underlying fabric is the model</p>
<p>of that particular theory is fields.</p>
<p>Like you keep saying fields.</p>
<p>Those are quantum fields.</p>
<p>Those are different from classical fields.</p>
<p>A field is something like you say,</p>
<p>like you say the temperature field in this room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there is a value of temperature</p>
<p>at every point around the room.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some, or you can say the wind field</p>
<p>would be the vector direction of the wind at every point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s continuous.</p>
<p>Yes, and that&rsquo;s a classical field.</p>
<p>The quantum field is a much more</p>
<p>mathematically elaborate kind of thing.</p>
<p>And I should explain that one of the pictures</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics that&rsquo;s really important is,</p>
<p>in classical physics, one believes</p>
<p>that sort of definite things happen in the world.</p>
<p>You pick up a ball, you throw it,</p>
<p>the ball goes in a definite trajectory</p>
<p>that has certain equations of motion.</p>
<p>It goes in a parabola, whatever else.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, the picture is</p>
<p>definite things don&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Instead, sort of what happens is this whole</p>
<p>sort of structure of all many different paths being followed</p>
<p>and we can calculate certain aspects of what happens,</p>
<p>certain probabilities of different outcomes and so on.</p>
<p>And you say, well, what really happened?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really going on?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the sort of, what&rsquo;s the underlying,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the underlying story?</p>
<p>How do we turn this mathematical theory</p>
<p>that we can calculate things with</p>
<p>into something that we can really understand</p>
<p>and have a narrative about?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been really, really hard for quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>My friend, Dick Feynman, always used to say,</p>
<p>nobody understands quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>even though he&rsquo;d made his whole career</p>
<p>out of calculating things about quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a little bit.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s what the quantum field theory is very,</p>
<p>very accurate at predicting a lot of the physical phenomena.</p>
<p>So it works.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But there are things about it, it has certain,</p>
<p>when we apply it, the standard model of particle physics,</p>
<p>for example, we, which we apply to calculate</p>
<p>all kinds of things that works really well.</p>
<p>And you say, well, it has certain parameters.</p>
<p>It has a whole bunch of parameters actually.</p>
<p>You say, why is the, why does the muon particle exist?</p>
<p>Why is it 206 times the mass of the electron?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, no idea.</p>
<p>But so the standard model of physics is one of the models</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very accurate for describing</p>
<p>three of the fundamental forces of physics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s looking at the world of the very small.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s back to the neighbor of gravity,</p>
<p>of general relativity.</p>
<p>So, and then in the context of a theory of everything,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s traditionally the task of the unification</p>
<p>of these theories?</p>
<p>And why is it hard?</p>
<p>The issue is you try to use the methods</p>
<p>of quantum field theory to talk about gravity</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Just like there are photons of light.</p>
<p>So there are gravitons,</p>
<p>which are sort of the particles of gravity.</p>
<p>And when you try and compute sort of the properties</p>
<p>of the particles of gravity,</p>
<p>the kind of mathematical tricks that get used</p>
<p>in working things out in quantum field theory don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, so that&rsquo;s been a sort of fundamental issue.</p>
<p>And when you think about black holes,</p>
<p>which are a place where sort of the structure of space</p>
<p>is, you know, has sort of rapid variation</p>
<p>and you get kind of quantum effects mixed in</p>
<p>with effects from general relativity,</p>
<p>things get very complicated</p>
<p>and there are apparent paradoxes and things like that.</p>
<p>And people have, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been a bunch of mathematical developments</p>
<p>in physics over the last, I don&rsquo;t know, 30 years or so,</p>
<p>which have kind of picked away at those kinds of issues</p>
<p>and got hints about how things might work.</p>
<p>But it hasn&rsquo;t been, you know,</p>
<p>and the other thing to realize is,</p>
<p>as far as physics is concerned,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like here&rsquo;s general relativity,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s quantum field theory, you know, be happy.</p>
<p>Yeah, so do you think there&rsquo;s a quantization of gravity,</p>
<p>so quantum gravity, what do you think of efforts</p>
<p>that people have tried to, yeah,</p>
<p>what do you think in general of the efforts</p>
<p>of the physics community to try to unify these laws?</p>
<p>So I think what&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I would have said something very different</p>
<p>before what&rsquo;s happened with our physics project.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the remarkable thing is</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve been able to do is to make</p>
<p>from this very simple, structurally simple,</p>
<p>underlying set of ideas,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been able to build this, you know,</p>
<p>very elaborate structure that&rsquo;s both very abstract</p>
<p>and very sort of mathematically rich.</p>
<p>And the big surprise, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,</p>
<p>is that it touches many of the ideas that people have had.</p>
<p>So in other words, things like string theory and so on,</p>
<p>twister theory, it&rsquo;s like the, you know,</p>
<p>we might&rsquo;ve thought, I had thought we&rsquo;re out on a prong,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re building something that&rsquo;s computational,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely different from what other people have done.</p>
<p>But actually it seems like what we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>is to provide essentially the machine code that, you know,</p>
<p>these things are various features</p>
<p>of domain specific languages, so to speak,</p>
<p>that talk about various aspects of this machine code.</p>
<p>And I think this is something that to me is very exciting</p>
<p>because it allows one both for us to provide</p>
<p>sort of a new foundation for what&rsquo;s been thought about there</p>
<p>and for all the work that&rsquo;s been done in those areas</p>
<p>to give us, you know, more momentum</p>
<p>to be able to figure out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Now, you know, people have sort of hoped,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re just gonna be able to get, you know,</p>
<p>string theory to just answer everything.</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t worked out.</p>
<p>And I think we now kind of can see a little bit about</p>
<p>just sort of how far away certain kinds of things are</p>
<p>from being able to explain things.</p>
<p>Some things, one of the big surprises to me,</p>
<p>actually I literally just got a message</p>
<p>about one aspect of this is the, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s turning out to be easier.</p>
<p>I mean, this project has been so much easier</p>
<p>than I could ever imagine it would be.</p>
<p>That is, I thought we would be, you know,</p>
<p>just about able to understand</p>
<p>the first 10 to the minus 100 seconds of the universe.</p>
<p>And, you know, it would be a hundred years</p>
<p>before we get much further than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just turned out, it actually wasn&rsquo;t that hard.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not finished, but, you know.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re seeing echoes of all the disparate theories</p>
<p>of physics in this framework.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a very interesting, you know,</p>
<p>sort of history of science like phenomenon.</p>
<p>I mean, the best analogy that I can see</p>
<p>is what happened with the early days</p>
<p>of computability and computation theory.</p>
<p>You know, Turing machines were invented in 1936.</p>
<p>People sort of understand computation</p>
<p>in terms of Turing machines,</p>
<p>but actually there had been preexisting theories</p>
<p>of computation, combinators, general recursive functions,</p>
<p>Lambda calculus, things like this.</p>
<p>But people hadn&rsquo;t, those hadn&rsquo;t been concrete enough</p>
<p>that people could really wrap their arms around them</p>
<p>and understand what was going on.</p>
<p>And I think what we&rsquo;re gonna see in this case</p>
<p>is that a bunch of these mathematical theories,</p>
<p>including some very,</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things that&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>is one of the most abstract things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s come out of sort of mathematics,</p>
<p>higher category theory, things about infinity group voids,</p>
<p>things like this, which to me always just seemed</p>
<p>like they were floating off into the stratosphere,</p>
<p>ionosphere of mathematics, turn out to be things</p>
<p>which our sort of theory anchors down</p>
<p>to something fairly definite and says are super relevant</p>
<p>to the way that we can understand how physics works.</p>
<p>Give me a sec.</p>
<p>By the way, I just threw a hat on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said that with this metaphor analogy</p>
<p>that the theory of everything is a big mountain</p>
<p>and you have a sense that however far we are up the mountain,</p>
<p>that the Wolfram physics model view of the universe</p>
<p>is at least the right mountain.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the right mountain, yes, without question.</p>
<p>Which aspect of it is the right mountain?</p>
<p>So for example, I mean, so there&rsquo;s so many aspects</p>
<p>to just the way of the Wolfram physics project,</p>
<p>the way it approaches the world that&rsquo;s clean, crisp,</p>
<p>and unique and powerful, so there&rsquo;s a discreet nature to it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hypergraph, there&rsquo;s a computational nature,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a generative aspect, you start from nothing,</p>
<p>you generate everything, do you think the actual model</p>
<p>is actually a really good one,</p>
<p>or do you think this general principle</p>
<p>from simplicity generating complexity is the right,</p>
<p>like what aspect of the mountain is the correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, right, I think that the kind of the meta idea</p>
<p>about using simple computational systems to do things,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the ultimate big paradigm</p>
<p>that is sort of super important.</p>
<p>The details of the particular model are very nice and clean</p>
<p>and allow one to actually understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>They are not unique, and in fact, we know that.</p>
<p>We know that there&rsquo;s a very, very, very, very,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a large number of different ways</p>
<p>to describe essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I can describe things in terms of hypergraphs,</p>
<p>I can describe them in terms of higher category theory,</p>
<p>I can describe them in a bunch of different ways.</p>
<p>They are in some sense all the same thing,</p>
<p>but our sort of story about what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and the kind of cultural mathematical resonances</p>
<p>are a bit different.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s perhaps worth sort of saying a little bit</p>
<p>about kind of the foundational ideas</p>
<p>of these models and things.</p>
<p>Great, so can you maybe, can we like rewind?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about it a little bit,</p>
<p>but can you say like what the central idea is</p>
<p>of the Wolfram Physics Project?</p>
<p>Right, so the question is we&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in finding sort of simple computational rule</p>
<p>that describes our whole universe.</p>
<p>Can we just pause on that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so beautiful, that&rsquo;s such a beautiful idea</p>
<p>that we can generate our universe</p>
<p>from a data structure, a simple structure,</p>
<p>simple set of rules, and we can generate our entire universe.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the idea. That&rsquo;s awe inspiring.</p>
<p>Right, but so the question is how do you actualize that?</p>
<p>What might this rule be like?</p>
<p>And so one thing you quickly realize is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna pack everything about our universe</p>
<p>into this tiny rule, not much that we are familiar with</p>
<p>in our universe will be obvious in that rule.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t get to fit all these parameters of the universe,</p>
<p>all these features of, you know, this is how space works,</p>
<p>this is how time works, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to fit that all in.</p>
<p>It all has to be sort of packed in to this thing,</p>
<p>something much smaller, much more basic,</p>
<p>much lower level machine code, so to speak, than that.</p>
<p>And all the stuff that we&rsquo;re familiar with</p>
<p>has to kind of emerge from the operation.</p>
<p>So the rule in itself,</p>
<p>because of the computational reducibility,</p>
<p>is not gonna tell you the story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna give you the answer to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna let you predict</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re gonna have for lunch tomorrow,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not going to let you predict</p>
<p>basically anything about your life, about the universe.</p>
<p>Right, and you&rsquo;re not going to be able to see in that rule,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s the three</p>
<p>for the number of dimensions of space and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not gonna be there.</p>
<p>Spacetime is not going to be obviously.</p>
<p>Right, so the question is then,</p>
<p>what is the universe made of?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a basic question.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had some assumptions</p>
<p>about what the universe is made of</p>
<p>for the last few thousand years</p>
<p>that I think in some cases just turn out not to be right.</p>
<p>And the most important assumption</p>
<p>is that space is a continuous thing.</p>
<p>That is that you can, if you say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s pick a point in space.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna do geometry.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna pick a point.</p>
<p>We can pick a point absolutely anywhere in space.</p>
<p>Precise numbers we can specify of where that point is.</p>
<p>In fact, Euclid who kind of wrote down</p>
<p>the original kind of axiomatization of geometry</p>
<p>back in 300 BC or so,</p>
<p>his very first definition, he says,</p>
<p>a point is that which has no part.</p>
<p>A point is this indivisible infinitesimal thing.</p>
<p>Okay, so we might&rsquo;ve said that about material objects.</p>
<p>We might&rsquo;ve said that about water, for example.</p>
<p>We might&rsquo;ve said water is a continuous thing</p>
<p>that we can just pick any point we want in some water,</p>
<p>but actually we know it isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>We know that water is made of molecules that are discrete.</p>
<p>And so the question, one fundamental question</p>
<p>is what is space made of?</p>
<p>And so one of the things that&rsquo;s sort of a starting point</p>
<p>for what I&rsquo;ve done is to think of space as a discrete thing,</p>
<p>to think of there being sort of atoms of space</p>
<p>just as there are atoms of material things,</p>
<p>although very different kinds of atoms.</p>
<p>And by the way, I mean, this idea,</p>
<p>you know, there were ancient Greek philosophers</p>
<p>who had this idea.</p>
<p>There were, you know, Einstein actually thought</p>
<p>this is probably how things would work out.</p>
<p>I mean, he said, you know, repeatedly he thought</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way it would work out.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the mathematical tools in our time,</p>
<p>which was 1940s, 1950s and so on to explore this.</p>
<p>Like the way he thought,</p>
<p>you mean that there is something very, very small</p>
<p>and discrete that&rsquo;s underlying space.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that means that, so, you know, the mathematical theory,</p>
<p>mathematical theories in physics assume that space</p>
<p>can be described just as a continuous thing.</p>
<p>You can just pick coordinates</p>
<p>and the coordinates can have any values.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you define space.</p>
<p>Space is this just sort of background sort of theater</p>
<p>on which the universe operates.</p>
<p>But can we draw a distinction between space</p>
<p>as a thing that could be described by three values,</p>
<p>coordinates, and how you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>are you using the word space more generally when you say?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just talking about space</p>
<p>as in what we experience in the universe.</p>
<p>So that you think this 3D aspect of it is fundamental.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think that 3D is fundamental at all, actually.</p>
<p>I think that the thing that has been assumed</p>
<p>is that space is this continuous thing</p>
<p>where you can just describe it by,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say three numbers, for instance.</p>
<p>But most important thing about that</p>
<p>is that you can describe it by precise numbers</p>
<p>because you can pick any point in space</p>
<p>and you can talk about motions,</p>
<p>any infinitesimal motion in space.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what continuous means.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what continuous means.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, you know, Newton invented calculus</p>
<p>to describe these kind of continuous small variations</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>That was, that&rsquo;s kind of a fundamental idea</p>
<p>from Euclid on that&rsquo;s been a fundamental idea about space.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Is that right or wrong?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right at the level of our experience most of the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not right at the level of the machine code,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Machine code.</p>
<p>Yeah, of the simulation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the very lowest level of the fabric of the universe,</p>
<p>at least under the Wolfram physics model</p>
<p>is your senses is discrete.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So now what does that mean?</p>
<p>So it means what is space then?</p>
<p>So in models, the basic idea is you say</p>
<p>there are these sort of atoms of space.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re these points that represent,</p>
<p>you know, represent places in space,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just discrete points.</p>
<p>And the only thing we know about them</p>
<p>is how they&rsquo;re connected to each other.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know where they are.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have coordinates.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get to say this is a position, such and such.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, here&rsquo;s a big bag of points.</p>
<p>Like in our universe,</p>
<p>there might be 10 to the 100 of these points.</p>
<p>And all we know is this point is connected</p>
<p>to this other point.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>all we have is the friend network, so to speak.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have, you know, people&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>physical addresses.</p>
<p>All we have is the friend network of these points.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The underlying nature of reality is kind of like a Facebook.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know their location, but we have the friends.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, right.</p>
<p>We know which point is connected to which other points.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all we know.</p>
<p>And so you might say, well,</p>
<p>how on earth can you get something</p>
<p>which is like our experience of, you know,</p>
<p>what seems like continuous space?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is,</p>
<p>by the time you have 10 to the 100 of these things,</p>
<p>those connections can work in such a way</p>
<p>that on a large scale,</p>
<p>it will seem to be like continuous space</p>
<p>in let&rsquo;s say three dimensions</p>
<p>or some other number of dimensions</p>
<p>or 2.6 dimensions or whatever else.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re much, much, much, much larger.</p>
<p>So like the number of relationships here we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is just a humongous amount.</p>
<p>So the kind of thing you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is very, very, very small relative</p>
<p>to our experience of daily life.</p>
<p>Right, so I mean, you know,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know exactly the size,</p>
<p>but maybe 10 to the minus,</p>
<p>maybe around 10 to the minus 100 meters.</p>
<p>So, you know, the size of, to give a comparison,</p>
<p>the size of a proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters.</p>
<p>And so this is something incredibly tiny compared to that.</p>
<p>And the idea that from that would emerge</p>
<p>the experience of continuous space is mind blowing.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s your intuition why that&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>Like, first of all, I mean, we&rsquo;ll get into it,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if we will</p>
<p>through the medium of conversation,</p>
<p>but the construct of hypergraphs is just beautiful.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Cellular automata are beautiful.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>But this thing about, you know,</p>
<p>continuity arising from discrete systems</p>
<p>is in today&rsquo;s world is actually not so surprising.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, your average computer screen, right?</p>
<p>Every computer screen is made of discrete pixels.</p>
<p>Yet we have the, you know,</p>
<p>we have the idea that we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>these continuous pictures.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>the fact that on a large scale,</p>
<p>continuity can arise from lots of discrete elements.</p>
<p>This is at some level unsurprising now.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>But the pixels have a very definitive structure</p>
<p>of neighbors on a computer screen.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no concept of spatial,</p>
<p>of space inherent in the underlying fabric of reality.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>So the point is that, but there are cases where there are.</p>
<p>So for example, let&rsquo;s just imagine you have a square grid.</p>
<p>Okay, and at every point on the grid,</p>
<p>you have one of these atoms of space</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s connected to four other,</p>
<p>four other atoms of space on the, you know,</p>
<p>Northeast, Southwest corners, right?</p>
<p>There you have something where if you zoom out from that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a computer screen.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the relationship creates the spatial,</p>
<p>like the relationship creates a constraint,</p>
<p>which then in an emergent sense creates a like,</p>
<p>yeah, like basically a spatial coordinate for that thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Even though the individual point doesn&rsquo;t have a space.</p>
<p>Even though the individual point doesn&rsquo;t know anything,</p>
<p>it just knows what its neighbors are.</p>
<p>On a large scale, it can be described by saying,</p>
<p>oh, it looks like it&rsquo;s a, you know,</p>
<p>this grid is zoomed out grid.</p>
<p>You can say, well, you can describe these different points</p>
<p>by saying they have certain positions,</p>
<p>coordinates, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, in the sort of real setup,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more complicated than that.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t just a square grid or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something much more dynamic and complicated,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>But so, you know, the first idea,</p>
<p>the first key idea is, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the universe made of?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made of atoms of space basically</p>
<p>with these connections between them.</p>
<p>What kind of connections do they have?</p>
<p>Well, so the simplest kind of thing you might say is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got something like a graph</p>
<p>where every atom of space,</p>
<p>where we have these edges that go between,</p>
<p>these connections that go between atoms of space.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not saying how long these edges are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just saying there is a connection</p>
<p>from this place, from this atom to this atom.</p>
<p>Just a quick pause,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of very people that listen to this.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, because I did a poll actually,</p>
<p>what do you think a graph is a long time ago?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of funny how few people</p>
<p>know the term graph outside of computer science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it a network.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it a network is better.</p>
<p>So, but every time, I like the word graph though.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s define, let&rsquo;s just say that a graph</p>
<p>will use terms nodes and edges maybe.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just the nodes represent some abstract entity</p>
<p>and then the edges represent relationships</p>
<p>between those entities.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what a graph says.</p>
<p>Sorry, so there you go.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the basic structure.</p>
<p>That is the simplest case of a basic structure.</p>
<p>Actually, it tends to be better to think about hypergraphs.</p>
<p>So a hypergraph is just, instead of saying</p>
<p>there are connections between pairs of things,</p>
<p>we say there are connections between any number of things.</p>
<p>So there might be ternary edges.</p>
<p>So instead of just having two points</p>
<p>are connected by an edge,</p>
<p>you say three points are all associated with a hyperedge,</p>
<p>are all connected by a hyperedge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, at some level, that&rsquo;s a detail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a detail that happens to make the, for me,</p>
<p>sort of in the history of this project,</p>
<p>the realization that you could do things that way</p>
<p>broke out of certain kinds of arbitrariness</p>
<p>that I felt that there was in the model</p>
<p>before I had seen how this worked.</p>
<p>I mean, a hypergraph can be mapped to a graph.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a convenient representation.</p>
<p>Mathematical speaking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct. That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>But so then, so, okay, so the first question,</p>
<p>the first idea of these models of ours is</p>
<p>space is made of these connected sort of atoms of space.</p>
<p>The next idea is space is all there is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing except for this space.</p>
<p>So in traditional ideas in physics,</p>
<p>people have said there&rsquo;s space, it&rsquo;s kind of a background.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s matter, all these particles, electrons,</p>
<p>all these other things, which exist in space, right?</p>
<p>But in this model, one of the key ideas is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing except space.</p>
<p>So in other words, everything that exists in the universe</p>
<p>is a feature of this hypergraph.</p>
<p>So how can that possibly be?</p>
<p>Well, the way that works is</p>
<p>that there are certain structures in this hypergraph</p>
<p>where you say that little twisty knotted thing,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know exactly how this works yet,</p>
<p>but we have sort of idea about how it works mathematically.</p>
<p>This sort of twisted knotted thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the core of an electron.</p>
<p>This thing over there that has this different form,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>So the different peculiarities of the structure</p>
<p>of this graph are the very things</p>
<p>that we think of as the particles inside the space,</p>
<p>but in fact, it&rsquo;s just a property of the space.</p>
<p>Mind blowing, first of all, that it&rsquo;s mind blowing,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll probably talk in its simplicity and beauty.</p>
<p>Yes, I think it&rsquo;s very beautiful.</p>
<p>I mean, this is, I&rsquo;m&hellip;</p>
<p>But okay, but that&rsquo;s space,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s another concept</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t really kind of mention,</p>
<p>but you think it of computation as a transformation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about time in a second.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just, I mean, on the subject of space,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this question of kind of what,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this idea, there is this hypergraph,</p>
<p>it represents space,</p>
<p>and it represents everything that&rsquo;s in space.</p>
<p>The features of that hypergraph,</p>
<p>you can say certain features in this part we do know,</p>
<p>certain features of the hypergraph</p>
<p>represent the presence of energy, for example,</p>
<p>or the presence of mass or momentum,</p>
<p>and we know what the features of the hypergraph</p>
<p>that represent those things are,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all just the same hypergraph.</p>
<p>So one thing you might ask is,</p>
<p>you know, if you just look at this hypergraph and you say,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna talk about sort of what the hypergraph does,</p>
<p>but if you say, you know,</p>
<p>how much of what&rsquo;s going on in this hypergraph</p>
<p>is things we know and care about,</p>
<p>like particles and atoms and electrons</p>
<p>and all this kind of thing,</p>
<p>and how much is just the background of space?</p>
<p>So it turns out, so far as in one rough estimate of this,</p>
<p>everything that we care about in the universe</p>
<p>is only one part in 10 to the 120</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s actually going on.</p>
<p>The vast majority of what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is purely things that maintain the structure of space.</p>
<p>That, in other words, that the things that are</p>
<p>the features of space that are the things</p>
<p>that we consider notable,</p>
<p>like the presence of particles and so on,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tiny little piece of froth</p>
<p>on the top of all this activity</p>
<p>that mostly is just intended to,</p>
<p>you know, mostly, I can&rsquo;t say intended,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no intention here,</p>
<p>that just maintains the structure of space.</p>
<p>Let me load that in.</p>
<p>It just makes me feel so good as a human being.</p>
<p>To be the froth on the one in a 10 to the 120</p>
<p>or something of, well.</p>
<p>And also just humbling how,</p>
<p>in this mathematical framework,</p>
<p>how much work needs to be done</p>
<p>on the infrastructure of our universe.</p>
<p>Right, to maintain the infrastructure of our universe</p>
<p>is a lot of work.</p>
<p>We are merely writing a little tiny things</p>
<p>on top of that infrastructure.</p>
<p>But you were just starting to talk a little bit about,</p>
<p>we talked about space,</p>
<p>that represents all the stuff that&rsquo;s in the universe.</p>
<p>The question is, what does that stuff do?</p>
<p>And for that, we have to start talking about time</p>
<p>and what is time and so on.</p>
<p>And, you know, one of the basic idea of this model</p>
<p>is time is the progression of computation.</p>
<p>So in other words, we have a structure of space</p>
<p>and there is a rule that says</p>
<p>how that structure of space will change.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the application,</p>
<p>the repeated application of that rule</p>
<p>that defines the progress of time.</p>
<p>And what does the rule look like</p>
<p>in the space of hypergraphs?</p>
<p>Right, so what the rule says is something like,</p>
<p>if you have a little tiny piece of hypergraph</p>
<p>that looks like this,</p>
<p>then it will be transformed into a piece of hypergraph</p>
<p>that looks like this.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all it says.</p>
<p>It says you pick up these elements of space</p>
<p>and you can think of these edges,</p>
<p>these hyper edges as being relations</p>
<p>between elements in space.</p>
<p>You might pick up these two relations</p>
<p>between elements in space.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not saying where those elements are</p>
<p>or what they are,</p>
<p>but every time there&rsquo;s a certain arrangement</p>
<p>of elements in space,</p>
<p>then arrangement in the sense of the way they&rsquo;re connected,</p>
<p>then we transform it into some other arrangement.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a little tiny pattern</p>
<p>and you transform it into another little pattern.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And then because of this,</p>
<p>I mean, again, it&rsquo;s kind of similar to cellular automata</p>
<p>in that like on paper, the rule looks like super simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, from this, the universe can be born.</p>
<p>But like once you start applying it,</p>
<p>beautiful structure starts being,</p>
<p>potentially can be created.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re applying that rule</p>
<p>to different parts,</p>
<p>like anytime you match it within the hypergraph.</p>
<p>And then one of the like incredibly beautiful</p>
<p>and interesting things to think about</p>
<p>is the order in which you apply that rule,</p>
<p>because that pattern appears all over the place.</p>
<p>Right, so this is a big complicated thing,</p>
<p>very hard to wrap one&rsquo;s brain around, okay?</p>
<p>So you say the rule is every time you see this little pattern</p>
<p>transform it in this way.</p>
<p>But yet, as you look around the space</p>
<p>that represents the universe,</p>
<p>there may be zillions of places</p>
<p>where that little pattern occurs.</p>
<p>So what it says is just do this,</p>
<p>apply this rule wherever you feel like.</p>
<p>And what is extremely non trivial is,</p>
<p>well, okay, so this is happening sort of</p>
<p>in computer science terms, sort of asynchronously,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just doing it wherever you feel like doing it.</p>
<p>And the only constraint is</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re going to apply the rule somewhere,</p>
<p>the things to which you apply the rule,</p>
<p>the little elements to which you apply the rule,</p>
<p>if they have to be,</p>
<p>okay, well, you can think of each application of the rule</p>
<p>as being kind of an event that happens in the universe.</p>
<p>And the input to an event has to be ready</p>
<p>for the event to occur.</p>
<p>That is, if one event occurred,</p>
<p>if one transformation occurred,</p>
<p>and it produced a particular atom of space,</p>
<p>then that atom of space has to already exist</p>
<p>before another transformation that&rsquo;s going to apply</p>
<p>to that atom of space can occur.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like the prerequisite for the event.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So that defines a kind of,</p>
<p>this sort of set of causal relationships between events.</p>
<p>It says, this event has to have happened before this event.</p>
<p>But that is&hellip;</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not a very limiting constraint.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting&hellip;</p>
<p>You still get the zillion,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a technical term, options.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>But, okay, so this is where things get a little bit more</p>
<p>elaborate, but&hellip;</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re mind blowing, so&hellip;</p>
<p>Right, but so what happens is,</p>
<p>so the first thing you might say is,</p>
<p>you know, let&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, okay, so this question about the freedom</p>
<p>of which event you do when.</p>
<p>Well, let me sort of state an answer and then explain it.</p>
<p>Okay, the validity of special relativity</p>
<p>is a consequence of the fact that in some sense,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter in what order you do</p>
<p>these underlying things, so long as they respect</p>
<p>this kind of set of causal relationships.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the part that&rsquo;s in a certain sense</p>
<p>is a really important one,</p>
<p>but the fact that it sometimes doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another, like, beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Well, okay, so there&rsquo;s this idea</p>
<p>of what I call causal invariance.</p>
<p>Causal invariance, exactly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Really, really powerful idea.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s a powerful idea,</p>
<p>which has actually arisen in different forms</p>
<p>many times in the history of mathematics,</p>
<p>mathematical logic, even computer science,</p>
<p>has many different names.</p>
<p>I mean, our particular version of it</p>
<p>is a little bit tighter than other versions,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically the same idea.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to think about that idea.</p>
<p>So imagine that&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about it in terms of math for a second.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re doing algebra and you&rsquo;re told,</p>
<p>you know, multiply out this series of polynomials</p>
<p>that are multiplied together, okay?</p>
<p>You say, well, which order should I do that in?</p>
<p>Say, well, do I multiply the third one by the fourth one</p>
<p>and then do it by the first one?</p>
<p>Or do I do the fifth one by the sixth one and then do that?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You can multiply them out in any order,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll always get the same answer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a property&hellip;</p>
<p>If you think about kind of making a kind of network</p>
<p>that represents in what order you do things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get different orders</p>
<p>for different ways of multiplying things out,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll always get the same answer.</p>
<p>Same thing if you&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re sorting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a bunch of A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in random, some random order,</p>
<p>you know, BAA, BBBAA, whatever.</p>
<p>And you have a little rule that says,</p>
<p>every time you see BA, flip it around to AB, okay?</p>
<p>Eventually you apply that rule enough times,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have sorted the string</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s all the A&rsquo;s first and then all the B&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Again, there are many different orders</p>
<p>in which you can do that to many different sort of places</p>
<p>where you can apply that update.</p>
<p>In the end, you&rsquo;ll always get the string sorted the same way.</p>
<p>I know with sorting the string, it sounds obvious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s to me surprising</p>
<p>that there is in complicated systems,</p>
<p>obviously with a string,</p>
<p>but in a hypergraph that the application of the rule,</p>
<p>asynchronous rule can lead to the same results sometimes.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, that is not obvious.</p>
<p>And it was something that, you know,</p>
<p>I sort of discovered that idea for these kinds of systems</p>
<p>and back in the 1990s.</p>
<p>And for various reasons, I was not satisfied</p>
<p>by how sort of fragile finding that particular property was.</p>
<p>And let me just make another point,</p>
<p>which is that it turns out that even if the underlying rule</p>
<p>does not have this property of causal invariance,</p>
<p>it can turn out that every observation</p>
<p>made by observers of the rule can,</p>
<p>they can impose what amounts to causal invariance</p>
<p>on the rule.</p>
<p>We can explain that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated.</p>
<p>I mean, technically that has to do with this idea</p>
<p>of completions, which is something that comes up</p>
<p>in term rewriting systems,</p>
<p>automated theorem proving systems and so on.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s ignore that for a second.</p>
<p>We can come to that later.</p>
<p>But is it useful to talk about observation?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so great.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some concept of causal invariance</p>
<p>as you apply these rules in an asynchronous way,</p>
<p>you can think of those transformations as events.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this hypergraph that represents space</p>
<p>and all of these events happening in the space</p>
<p>and the graph grows in interesting complicated ways.</p>
<p>And eventually the froth arises of what we experience</p>
<p>as human existence.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some version of the picture,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s explain a little bit more.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a little more detail like?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, so one thing that is sort of surprising</p>
<p>in this theory is one of the sort of achievements</p>
<p>of 20th century physics was kind of bringing</p>
<p>space and time together.</p>
<p>That was, you know, special relativity.</p>
<p>People talk about space time, this sort of unified thing</p>
<p>where space and time kind of a mixed</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a nice mathematical formalism</p>
<p>that in which, you know, space and time sort of appear</p>
<p>as part of the space time continuum,</p>
<p>the space time, you know, four vectors and things like this.</p>
<p>You know, we talk about time as the fourth dimension</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, and it seems like the theory of relativity</p>
<p>sort of says space and time are fundamentally</p>
<p>the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>So one of the things that took a while to understand</p>
<p>in this approach of mine is that in my kind of approach,</p>
<p>space and time are really not fundamentally</p>
<p>the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>Space is the extension of this hypergraph.</p>
<p>Time is the kind of progress of this inexorable computation</p>
<p>of these rules getting applied to the hypergraph.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, they seem like very different kinds of things.</p>
<p>And so that at first seems like</p>
<p>how can that possibly be right?</p>
<p>How can that possibly be Lorentz invariant?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the term for things being, you know,</p>
<p>following the rules of special relativity.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that when you have causal invariants</p>
<p>that, and let&rsquo;s see, we can, it&rsquo;s worth explaining</p>
<p>a little bit how this works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit elaborate,</p>
<p>but the basic point is that even though space and time</p>
<p>sort of come from very different places,</p>
<p>it turns out that the rules of sort of space time</p>
<p>that special relativity talks about come out of this model</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re looking at large enough systems.</p>
<p>So a way to think about this, you know,</p>
<p>in terms of when you&rsquo;re looking at large enough systems,</p>
<p>the part of that story is when you look at some fluid</p>
<p>like water, for example, there are equations</p>
<p>that govern the flow of water.</p>
<p>Those equations are things that apply on a large scale.</p>
<p>If you look at the individual molecules,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know anything about those equations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the sort of the large scale effect</p>
<p>of those molecules turns out to follow those equations.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same kind of thing happening in our models.</p>
<p>I know this might be a small point,</p>
<p>but it might be a very big one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about space and time</p>
<p>at the lowest level of the model, which is space.</p>
<p>The hypergraph time is the evolution of this hypergraph.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also space time that we think about</p>
<p>and general relativity for your special relativity.</p>
<p>Like how do you go from the lowest source code</p>
<p>of space and time as we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>to the more traditional terminology of space and time?</p>
<p>So the key thing is this thing we call the causal graph.</p>
<p>So the causal graph is the graph</p>
<p>of causal relationships between events.</p>
<p>So every one of these little updating events,</p>
<p>every one of these little transformations</p>
<p>of the hypergraph happens somewhere in the hypergraph,</p>
<p>happens at some stage in the computation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an event.</p>
<p>That event has a causal relationship to other events</p>
<p>in the sense that if another event needs as its input,</p>
<p>the output from the first event,</p>
<p>there will be a causal relationship</p>
<p>of the future event will depend on the past event.</p>
<p>So you can say it has a causal connection.</p>
<p>And so you can make this graph</p>
<p>of causal relationships between events.</p>
<p>That graph of causal relationships,</p>
<p>causal invariance implies that that graph is unique.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter even though you think,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m, let&rsquo;s say we were sorting a string, for example,</p>
<p>I did that particular transposition of characters</p>
<p>at this time, then I did that one, then I did this one.</p>
<p>Turns out if you look at the network of connections</p>
<p>between those updating events, that network is the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, if you were to, the structure.</p>
<p>So in other words, if you were to draw that,</p>
<p>if you were to put that network on a picture</p>
<p>of where you&rsquo;re doing all the updating,</p>
<p>the places where you put the nodes of the network</p>
<p>will be different, but the way the nodes are connected</p>
<p>will always be the same.</p>
<p>So, but the causal graph is, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of an observation, it&rsquo;s not enforced,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just emergent from a set of events.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feature of, okay, so what it is is.</p>
<p>The characteristic, I guess, of the way events happen.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s an event can&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>until its input is ready.</p>
<p>And so that creates this network of causal relationships.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the causal graph.</p>
<p>And the thing that the next thing to realize is,</p>
<p>okay, we, when you&rsquo;re going to observe</p>
<p>what happens in the universe,</p>
<p>you have to sort of make sense of this causal graph.</p>
<p>So, and you are an observer who yourself</p>
<p>is part of this causal graph.</p>
<p>And so that means, so let me give you an example</p>
<p>of how that works.</p>
<p>So imagine we have a really weird theory of physics</p>
<p>of the world where it says this updating process,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only gonna be one update at every moment in time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just gonna be like a Turing machine.</p>
<p>It has a little head that runs around</p>
<p>and just is always just updating one thing at a time.</p>
<p>So you say, I have a theory of physics</p>
<p>and the theory of physics says,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just this one little place where things get updated.</p>
<p>You say, that&rsquo;s completely crazy because,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s plainly obvious that things are being updated</p>
<p>sort of at the same time.</p>
<p>Async obviously, yeah, at the same time, yeah.</p>
<p>But the fact is that the thing is that if I&rsquo;m talking to you</p>
<p>and you seem to be being updated as I&rsquo;m being updated,</p>
<p>but if there&rsquo;s just this one little head</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s running around updating things,</p>
<p>I will not know whether you&rsquo;ve been updated or not</p>
<p>until I&rsquo;m updated.</p>
<p>So in other words, draw this causal graph</p>
<p>of the causal relationship between the updatings in you</p>
<p>and the updatings in me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll still be the same causal graph,</p>
<p>whether even though the underlying sort of story</p>
<p>of what happens is, oh, there&rsquo;s just this one little thing</p>
<p>and it goes and updates in different places in the universe.</p>
<p>So is that clear or is that a hypothesis?</p>
<p>Is that clear that there&rsquo;s a unique causal graph?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s causal invariance, there&rsquo;s unique causal graph.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s okay to think of what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>as a hypergraph and the operations on it</p>
<p>as a kind of touring machine with a single head,</p>
<p>like a single guy running around updating stuff.</p>
<p>Is that safe to intuitively think of it this way?</p>
<p>Let me think about that for a second.</p>
<p>Yes, I think so.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s nothing, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I mean, you can say, okay, there is one,</p>
<p>the reason I&rsquo;m pausing for a second is that I&rsquo;m wondering,</p>
<p>well, when you say running around,</p>
<p>depends how far it jumps every time it runs.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But I mean like one operation at a time.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can think of it as one operation at a time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier for the human brain to think of it that way</p>
<p>as opposed to simultaneous.</p>
<p>Well, maybe it&rsquo;s not, okay, but the thing is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not how we experience the world.</p>
<p>What we experience is we look around,</p>
<p>everything seems to be happening</p>
<p>at successive moments in time everywhere in space.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That is the, and that&rsquo;s partly a feature</p>
<p>of our particular construction.</p>
<p>I mean, that is the speed of light is really fast</p>
<p>compared to, you know, we look around, you know,</p>
<p>I can see maybe a hundred feet away right now.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s the, my brain does not process very much</p>
<p>in the time it takes light to go a hundred feet.</p>
<p>The brain operates at a scale of hundreds of milliseconds</p>
<p>or something like that, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And speed of light is much faster.</p>
<p>Right, you know, light goes,</p>
<p>in a billionth of a second light has gone afoot.</p>
<p>So it goes a billion feet every second.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain moments through this conversation</p>
<p>where I imagine the absurdity of the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s two descendants of apes modeled by a hypergraph</p>
<p>that are communicating with each other</p>
<p>and experiencing this whole thing</p>
<p>as a real time simultaneous update with,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking in photons from you right now,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something much, much deeper going on here.</p>
<p>Right, it does have a.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s paralyzing sometimes to just.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>To remember that.</p>
<p>Right, no, I mean, you know, it&rsquo;s a, you know.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, no.</p>
<p>As a small little tangent, I just remembered</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>I mean, about the fabric of reality.</p>
<p>Right, so we&rsquo;ve got this causal graph</p>
<p>that represents the sort of causal relationships</p>
<p>between all these events in the universe.</p>
<p>That causal graph kind of is a representation of space time,</p>
<p>but our experience of it requires</p>
<p>that we pick reference frames.</p>
<p>This is kind of a key idea.</p>
<p>Einstein had this idea that what that means is</p>
<p>we have to say, what are we going to pick</p>
<p>as being the sort of what we define</p>
<p>as simultaneous moments in time?</p>
<p>So for example, we can say, you know,</p>
<p>how do we set our clocks?</p>
<p>You know, if we&rsquo;ve got a spacecraft landing on Mars,</p>
<p>you know, do we say that, you know,</p>
<p>what time is it landing at?</p>
<p>Was it, you know, even though there&rsquo;s a 20 minute</p>
<p>speed of light delay or something, you know,</p>
<p>what time do we say it landed at?</p>
<p>How do we set up sort of time coordinates for the world?</p>
<p>And that turns out to be that there&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>this arbitrariness to how we set these reference frames</p>
<p>that defines sort of what counts as simultaneous.</p>
<p>And what is the essence of special relativity</p>
<p>is to think about reference frames going at different speeds</p>
<p>and to think about sort of how they assign,</p>
<p>what counts as space, what counts as time and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all a bit technical, but the basic bottom line is</p>
<p>that this causal invariance property,</p>
<p>that means that it&rsquo;s always the same causal graph,</p>
<p>independent of how you slice it with these reference frames,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll always sort of see the same physical processes go on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically why special relativity works.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something like special relativity,</p>
<p>like everything around space and time</p>
<p>that fits this idea of the causal graph.</p>
<p>Right, well, you know, one way to think about it is</p>
<p>given that you have a basic structure</p>
<p>that just involves updating things in these,</p>
<p>you know, connected updates and looking at</p>
<p>the causal relationships between connected updates,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s enough when you unravel the consequences of that,</p>
<p>that together with the fact that there are lots</p>
<p>of these things and that you can take a continuum limit</p>
<p>and so on implies special relativity.</p>
<p>And so that, it&rsquo;s kind of not a big deal</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of a, you know,</p>
<p>it was completely unobvious when you started off</p>
<p>with saying, we&rsquo;ve got this graph,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being updated in time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>that just looks like nothing to do with special relativity.</p>
<p>And yet you get that.</p>
<p>And what, I mean, then the thing,</p>
<p>I mean, this was stuff that I figured out back in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The next big thing you get is general relativity.</p>
<p>And so in this hypergraph,</p>
<p>the sort of limiting structure,</p>
<p>when you have a very big hypergraph,</p>
<p>you can think of as being just like, you know,</p>
<p>water seems continuous on a large scale.</p>
<p>So this hypergraph seems continuous on a large scale.</p>
<p>One question is, you know,</p>
<p>how many dimensions of space does it correspond to?</p>
<p>So one question you can ask is,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve just got a bunch of points</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re connected together,</p>
<p>how do you deduce what effective dimension of space</p>
<p>that bundle of points corresponds to?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty easy to explain.</p>
<p>So basically if you say you&rsquo;ve got a point</p>
<p>and you look at how many neighbors does that point have?</p>
<p>Okay, imagine it&rsquo;s on a square grid.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;ll have four neighbors.</p>
<p>Go another level out.</p>
<p>How many neighbors do you get then?</p>
<p>What you realize is as you go more and more levels out,</p>
<p>as you go more and more distance on the graph out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re capturing something which is essentially a circle</p>
<p>in two dimensions so that, you know,</p>
<p>the number of the area of a circle is pi R squared.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the number of points that you get to</p>
<p>goes up like the distance you&rsquo;ve gone squared.</p>
<p>And in general, in D dimensional space,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s R to the power D.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the number of points you get to</p>
<p>if you go R steps on the graph grows like</p>
<p>the number of steps you go to the power of the dimension.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a way that you can estimate</p>
<p>the effective dimension of one of these graphs.</p>
<p>So what does that grow to?</p>
<p>So how does the dimension grow?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, I mean, obviously the visual aspect</p>
<p>of these hypergraphs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re often visualized in three dimensions.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a certain kind of structure,</p>
<p>like you said, there&rsquo;s, I mean, a circle, a sphere,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a planar aspect to it,</p>
<p>to this graph to where it kind of,</p>
<p>it almost starts creating a surface,</p>
<p>like a complicated surface, but a surface.</p>
<p>So how does that connect to effective dimension?</p>
<p>Okay, so if you can lay out the graph</p>
<p>in such a way that the points in the graph that,</p>
<p>you know, the points that are neighbors on the graph</p>
<p>are neighbors as you lay them out,</p>
<p>and you can do that in two dimensions,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s gonna approximate a two dimensional thing.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t do that in two dimensions,</p>
<p>if everything would have to fold over a lot</p>
<p>in two dimensions,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s not approximating a two dimensional thing.</p>
<p>Maybe you can lay it out in three dimensions.</p>
<p>Maybe you have to lay it out in five dimensions</p>
<p>to have it be the case</p>
<p>that it sort of smoothly lays out like that.</p>
<p>Well, but okay, so I apologize</p>
<p>for the different tangent questions,</p>
<p>but you know, there&rsquo;s an infinity number of possible rules.</p>
<p>So we have to look for rules</p>
<p>that create the kind of structures</p>
<p>that are reminiscent for,</p>
<p>that have echoes of the different physics theories in them.</p>
<p>So what kind of rules,</p>
<p>is there something simple to be said</p>
<p>about the kind of rules that you have found beautiful,</p>
<p>that you have found powerful?</p>
<p>Right, so I mean, what, you know,</p>
<p>one of the features of computational irreducibility is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, you can&rsquo;t say in advance,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen with any particular,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say, I&rsquo;m gonna pick these rules</p>
<p>from this part of rule space, so to speak,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna be the ones that are gonna work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you can make some statements along those lines,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t generally say that.</p>
<p>Now, you know, the state of what we&rsquo;ve been able to do</p>
<p>is, you know, different properties of the universe,</p>
<p>like dimensionality, you know, integer dimensionality,</p>
<p>features of other features of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>At this point, what we&rsquo;ve got is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got rules that any one of those features,</p>
<p>we can get a rule that has that feature.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the sort of, the final,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a rule which has all of these features,</p>
<p>we do not have that yet.</p>
<p>So if I were to try to summarize</p>
<p>the Wolfram physics project, which is, you know,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s been in your brain for a long time,</p>
<p>but really has just exploded in activity,</p>
<p>you know, only just months ago.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an evolving thing, and next week,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to publish this conversation</p>
<p>as quickly as possible, because by the time it&rsquo;s published,</p>
<p>already new things will probably have come out.</p>
<p>So if I were to summarize it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about the basics of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hypergraph that represents space,</p>
<p>there is transformations in that hypergraph</p>
<p>that represents time.</p>
<p>The progress of time.</p>
<p>The progress of time, there&rsquo;s a causal graph</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a characteristic of this,</p>
<p>and the basic process of science,</p>
<p>of, yeah, of science within the Wolfram physics model</p>
<p>is to try different rules and see which properties</p>
<p>of physics that we know of, known physical theories,</p>
<p>are, appear within the graphs that emerge from that rule.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought it was going to be.</p>
<p>Uh oh, okay.</p>
<p>So what is it?</p>
<p>It turns out we can do a lot better than that.</p>
<p>It turns out that using kind of mathematical ideas,</p>
<p>we can say, and computational ideas,</p>
<p>we can make general statements,</p>
<p>and those general statements turn out to correspond</p>
<p>to things that we know from 20th century physics.</p>
<p>In other words, the idea of you just try a bunch of rules</p>
<p>and see what they do,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I thought we were gonna have to do.</p>
<p>But in fact, we can say, given causal invariance</p>
<p>and computational irreducibility, we can derive,</p>
<p>and this is where it gets really pretty interesting,</p>
<p>we can derive special relativity,</p>
<p>we can derive general relativity,</p>
<p>we can derive quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where things really start to get exciting,</p>
<p>is, you know, it wasn&rsquo;t at all obvious to me</p>
<p>that even if we were completely correct,</p>
<p>and even if we had, you know, this is the rule,</p>
<p>you know, even if we found the rule,</p>
<p>to be able to say, yes, it corresponds</p>
<p>to things we already know,</p>
<p>I did not expect that to be the case.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>So for somebody who is a simple mind</p>
<p>and definitely not a physicist, not even close,</p>
<p>what does derivation mean in this case?</p>
<p>Okay, so let me, this is an interesting question.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s, so one thing&hellip;</p>
<p>In the context of computational irreducibility.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, right, right.</p>
<p>So what you have to do, let me go back to, again,</p>
<p>the mundane example of fluids and water</p>
<p>and things like that, right?</p>
<p>So you have a bunch of molecules bouncing around.</p>
<p>You can say, just as a piece of mathematics,</p>
<p>I happen to do this from cellular automata</p>
<p>back in the mid 1980s, you can say,</p>
<p>just as a matter of mathematics,</p>
<p>you can say the continuum limit</p>
<p>of these little molecules bouncing around</p>
<p>is the Navier Stokes equations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a piece of mathematics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it doesn&rsquo;t rely on&hellip;</p>
<p>You have to make certain assumptions</p>
<p>that you have to say there&rsquo;s enough randomness</p>
<p>in the way the molecules bounce around</p>
<p>that certain statistical averages work,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Okay, it is a very similar derivation</p>
<p>to derive, for example, the Einstein equations.</p>
<p>Okay, so the way that works, roughly,</p>
<p>the Einstein equations are about curvature of space.</p>
<p>Curvature of space, I talked about sort of</p>
<p>how you can figure out dimension of space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a similar kind of way of figuring out</p>
<p>if you just sort of say, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making a larger and larger ball</p>
<p>or larger and larger, if you draw a circle</p>
<p>on the surface of the earth, for example,</p>
<p>you might think the area of a circle is pi r squared,</p>
<p>but on the surface of the earth,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a sphere, it&rsquo;s not flat,</p>
<p>the area of a circle isn&rsquo;t precisely pi r squared.</p>
<p>As the circle gets bigger, the area is slightly smaller</p>
<p>than you would expect from the formula pi r squared</p>
<p>as a little correction term that depends on the ratio</p>
<p>of the size of the circle to the radius of the earth.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s the same basic thing,</p>
<p>allows you to measure from one of these hypergraphs</p>
<p>what is its effective curvature.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>So the little piece of mathematics</p>
<p>that explains special general relativity</p>
<p>can map nicely to describe fundamental property</p>
<p>of the hypergraphs, the curvature of the hypergraphs.</p>
<p>So special relativity is about the relationship</p>
<p>of time to space.</p>
<p>General relativity is about curvature</p>
<p>and this space represented by this hypergraph.</p>
<p>So what is the curvature of a hypergraph?</p>
<p>Okay, so first I have to explain,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re explaining is,</p>
<p>first thing you have to have is a notion of dimension.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to talk about curvature of things.</p>
<p>If you say, oh, it&rsquo;s a curved line,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know what a line is yet.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, what is the dimension of a hypergraph then?</p>
<p>From where, we&rsquo;ve talked about effective dimension, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s what this is about.</p>
<p>What this is about is, you have your hypergraph,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got a trillion nodes in it.</p>
<p>What is it roughly like?</p>
<p>Is it roughly like a grid, a two dimensional grid?</p>
<p>Is it roughly like all those nodes are arranged online?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it roughly like?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a pretty simple mathematical way</p>
<p>to estimate that by just looking at this thing</p>
<p>I was describing, this sort of the size of a ball</p>
<p>that you construct in the hypergraph.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, you just measure that,</p>
<p>you can just compute it on a computer for a given hypergraph</p>
<p>and you can say, oh, this thing is wiggling around,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s roughly corresponds to two or something like that,</p>
<p>or roughly corresponds to 2.6 or whatever.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how you have a notion of dimension</p>
<p>in these hypergraphs.</p>
<p>Curvature is something a little bit beyond that.</p>
<p>If you look at how the size of this ball increases</p>
<p>as you increase its radius,</p>
<p>curvature is a correction</p>
<p>to the size increase associated with dimension.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sort of a second order term</p>
<p>in determining the size.</p>
<p>Just like the area of a circle is roughly pi R squared.</p>
<p>So it goes up like R squared.</p>
<p>The two is because it&rsquo;s in two dimensions,</p>
<p>but when that circle is drawn on a big sphere,</p>
<p>the actual formula is pi R squared times one minus</p>
<p>R squared over A squared and some coefficient.</p>
<p>So in other words, there&rsquo;s a correction to,</p>
<p>and that correction term, that gives you curvature.</p>
<p>And that correction term</p>
<p>is what makes this hypergraph correspond,</p>
<p>have the potential to correspond to curved space.</p>
<p>Now, the next question is, is that curvature,</p>
<p>is the way that curvature works</p>
<p>the way that Einstein&rsquo;s equations for general relativity,</p>
<p>is it the way they say it should work?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes.</p>
<p>And so how does that work?</p>
<p>The calculation of the curvature of this hypergraph</p>
<p>for some set of rules?</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the rules are.</p>
<p>So long as they have causal invariance</p>
<p>and computational irreducibility,</p>
<p>and they lead to finite dimensional space,</p>
<p>noninfinite dimensional space.</p>
<p>Noninfinite dimensional.</p>
<p>It can grow infinitely,</p>
<p>but it can&rsquo;t be infinite dimensional.</p>
<p>So what is a infinitely dimensional hypergraph look like?</p>
<p>So that means, for example, so in a tree,</p>
<p>you start from one root of the tree,</p>
<p>it doubles, doubles again, doubles again, doubles again.</p>
<p>And that means if you ask the question,</p>
<p>starting from a given point,</p>
<p>how many points do you get to?</p>
<p>Remember, in like a circle,</p>
<p>you get to R squared, the two there.</p>
<p>On a tree, you get to, for example, two to the R.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exponential dimensional, so to speak,</p>
<p>or infinite dimensional.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of, in the space of all possible rules,</p>
<p>how many lead to infinitely dimensional hypergraphs?</p>
<p>Is that? No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is that an important thing to know?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s an important thing to know.</p>
<p>I would love to know the answer to that.</p>
<p>But it gets a little bit more complicated</p>
<p>because, for example, it&rsquo;s very possibly the case</p>
<p>that in our physical universe,</p>
<p>that the universe started infinite dimensional.</p>
<p>And it only, as the Big Bang,</p>
<p>it was very likely infinite dimensional.</p>
<p>And as the universe sort of expanded and cooled,</p>
<p>its dimension gradually went down.</p>
<p>And so one of the bizarre possibilities,</p>
<p>which actually there are experiments you can do</p>
<p>to try and look at this,</p>
<p>the universe can have dimension fluctuations.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>we think we live in a three dimensional universe,</p>
<p>but actually there may be places</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s actually 3.01 dimensional,</p>
<p>or where it&rsquo;s 2.99 dimensional.</p>
<p>And it may be that in the very early universe,</p>
<p>it was actually infinite dimensional,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s only a late stage phenomenon</p>
<p>that we end up getting three dimensional space.</p>
<p>But from your perspective of the hypergraph,</p>
<p>one of the underlying assumptions you kind of implied,</p>
<p>but you have a sense, a hope set of assumptions</p>
<p>that the rules that underlie our universe,</p>
<p>or the rule that underlies our universe is static.</p>
<p>Is that one of the assumptions</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re currently operating under?</p>
<p>Yes, but there&rsquo;s a footnote to that,</p>
<p>which we should get to,</p>
<p>because it requires a few more steps.</p>
<p>Well, actually then, let&rsquo;s backtrack to the curvature,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about as long as it&rsquo;s finite dimensional.</p>
<p>Finite dimensional computational irreducibility</p>
<p>and causal invariance,</p>
<p>then it follows that the large scale structure</p>
<p>will follow Einstein&rsquo;s equations.</p>
<p>And now let me again, qualify that a little bit more,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit more complexity to it.</p>
<p>The, okay, so Einstein&rsquo;s equations in their simplest form</p>
<p>apply to the vacuum, no matter, just the vacuum.</p>
<p>And they say, in particular, what they say is,</p>
<p>if you have, so there&rsquo;s this term GD6,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a term that means shortest path,</p>
<p>comes from measuring the shortest paths on the Earth.</p>
<p>So you look at a bunch of, a bundle of GD6,</p>
<p>a bunch of shortest paths,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the paths that photons</p>
<p>would take between two points.</p>
<p>Then the statement of Einstein&rsquo;s equations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically a statement about a certain the,</p>
<p>that as you look at a bundle of GD6,</p>
<p>the structure of space has to be such that,</p>
<p>although the cross sectional area of this bundle may,</p>
<p>although the actual shape of the cross section may change,</p>
<p>the cross sectional area does not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a version, that&rsquo;s the most simple minded version</p>
<p>of R mu nu minus a half R G mu nu equals zero,</p>
<p>which is the more mathematical version</p>
<p>of Einstein&rsquo;s equations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a statement of the thing called the Ritchie tensor</p>
<p>is equal to zero.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Einstein&rsquo;s equations for the vacuum.</p>
<p>Okay, so we get that as a result of this model,</p>
<p>but footnote, big footnote,</p>
<p>because all the matter in the universe</p>
<p>is the stuff we actually care about.</p>
<p>The vacuum is not stuff we care about.</p>
<p>So the question is, how does matter come into this?</p>
<p>And for that, you have to understand what energy is</p>
<p>in these models.</p>
<p>And one of the things that we realized, you know,</p>
<p>late last year was that there&rsquo;s a very simple interpretation</p>
<p>of energy in these models, okay?</p>
<p>And energy is basically, well, intuitively,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the amount of activity in these hypergraphs</p>
<p>and the way that that remains over time.</p>
<p>So a little bit more formally,</p>
<p>you can think about this causal graph</p>
<p>as having these edges that represent causal relationships.</p>
<p>You can think about, oh boy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one more concept that we didn&rsquo;t get to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the notion of space like hypersurfaces.</p>
<p>So this is not as scary as it sounds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common notion in general activity.</p>
<p>The notion is you are defining what is a possibly,</p>
<p>where in space time might be a particular moment in time.</p>
<p>So in other words, what is a consistent set of places</p>
<p>where you can say, this is happening now, so to speak.</p>
<p>And you make the series of sort of slices</p>
<p>through the space time, through this causal graph</p>
<p>to represent sort of what we consider</p>
<p>to be successive moments in time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhat arbitrary because you can deform that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going at a different speed in a special activity,</p>
<p>you tip those things, there are different kinds</p>
<p>of deformations, but only certain deformations</p>
<p>are allowed by the structure of the causal graph.</p>
<p>Anyway, be that as it may, the basic point is</p>
<p>there is a way of figuring out,</p>
<p>you say, what is the energy associated</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s going on in this hypergraph?</p>
<p>And the answer is there is a precise definition of that.</p>
<p>And it is the formal way to say it is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the flux of causal edges</p>
<p>through space like hypersurfaces.</p>
<p>The slightly less formal way to say it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically the amount of activity.</p>
<p>See, the reason it gets tricky is you might say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the amount of activity per unit volume</p>
<p>in this hypergraph, but you haven&rsquo;t defined what volume is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit, you have to be a little more careful.</p>
<p>But this hypersurface gives some more formalism to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it gives a way to connect that.</p>
<p>But intuitive, we should think about as the just activity.</p>
<p>Right, so the amount of activity that kind of remains</p>
<p>in one place in the hypergraph corresponds to energy.</p>
<p>The amount of activity that is kind of where an activity here</p>
<p>affects an activity somewhere else,</p>
<p>corresponds to momentum.</p>
<p>And so one of the things that&rsquo;s kind of cool</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m trying to think about</p>
<p>how to say this intuitively.</p>
<p>The mathematics is easy,</p>
<p>but the intuitive version, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>But basically the way that things sort of stay</p>
<p>in the same place and have activity</p>
<p>is associated with rest mass.</p>
<p>And so one of the things that you get to derive</p>
<p>is E equals MC squared.</p>
<p>That is a consequence of this interpretation of energy</p>
<p>in terms of the way the causal graph works,</p>
<p>which is the whole thing is sort of a consequence</p>
<p>of this whole story about updates and hypergraphs and so on.</p>
<p>So can you linger on that a little bit?</p>
<p>How do we get E equals MC squared?</p>
<p>So where does the mass come from?</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>I mean, is there an intuitive, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>First of all, you&rsquo;re pretty deep</p>
<p>in the mathematical explorations of this thing right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a very, we&rsquo;re in a flux currently.</p>
<p>So maybe you haven&rsquo;t even had time</p>
<p>to think about intuitive explanations, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this one is, look, roughly what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>that derivation is actually rather easy.</p>
<p>And everybody, and I&rsquo;ve been saying</p>
<p>we should pay more attention to this derivation</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such, you know,</p>
<p>cause people care about this one.</p>
<p>But everybody says, it&rsquo;s just easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some concept of energy</p>
<p>that can be intuitively thought of as the activity,</p>
<p>the flux, the level of changes that are occurring</p>
<p>based on the transformations within a certain volume,</p>
<p>however the heck do you find the volume.</p>
<p>Okay, so, and then mass.</p>
<p>Well, mass is associated with kind of the energy</p>
<p>that does not cause you to,</p>
<p>that does not somehow propagate through time.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, one of the things that was not obvious</p>
<p>in the usual formulation of special relativity</p>
<p>is that space and time are connected in a certain way.</p>
<p>Energy and momentum are also connected in a certain way.</p>
<p>The fact that the connection of energy to momentum</p>
<p>is analogous to the connection to space</p>
<p>between space and time</p>
<p>is not self evident in ordinary relativity.</p>
<p>It is a consequence of this, of the way this model works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an intrinsic consequence of the way this model works.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all to do with that,</p>
<p>with unraveling that connection</p>
<p>that ends up giving you this relationship</p>
<p>between energy and, well, it&rsquo;s energy, momentum, mass,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all connected.</p>
<p>And so like, that&rsquo;s hence the general relativity.</p>
<p>You have a sense that it appears to be baked in</p>
<p>to the fundamental properties</p>
<p>of the way these hypergraphs are evolved.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t yet get to,</p>
<p>so I got as far as special relativity and equals MC squared.</p>
<p>The one last step is, in general relativity,</p>
<p>the final connection is energy and mass</p>
<p>cause curvature in space.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that when you understand</p>
<p>this interpretation of energy,</p>
<p>and you kind of understand the correspondence</p>
<p>to curvature and hypergraphs,</p>
<p>then you can finally sort of, the big final answer is,</p>
<p>you derive the full version of Einstein&rsquo;s equations</p>
<p>for space, time and matter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s some.</p>
<p>Is that, have you, that last piece with curvature,</p>
<p>have, is that, have you arrived there yet?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, we&rsquo;re there, yes.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the way that we,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re really, really going to know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve arrived, okay?</p>
<p>So, you know, we have the mathematical derivation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all fine, but, you know,</p>
<p>mathematical derivations, okay.</p>
<p>So one thing that&rsquo;s sort of a,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re taking this limit</p>
<p>of what happens when you, the limit,</p>
<p>you have to look at things which are large</p>
<p>compared to the size of an elementary length,</p>
<p>small compared to the whole size of the universe,</p>
<p>large compared to certain kinds of fluctuations,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a tower</p>
<p>of many, many of these mathematical limits</p>
<p>that have to be taken.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a pure mathematician saying,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the precise proof?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, there are all these limits,</p>
<p>we can, you know, we can try each one of them</p>
<p>computationally and we could say, yeah, it really works,</p>
<p>but the formal mathematics is really hard to do.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, in the case of deriving</p>
<p>the equations of fluid dynamics from molecular dynamics,</p>
<p>that derivation has never been done.</p>
<p>There is no rigorous version of that derivation.</p>
<p>So, so that could be.</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t do the limits?</p>
<p>Yeah, because you can&rsquo;t do the limits.</p>
<p>But so the limits allow you to try to describe</p>
<p>something general about the system</p>
<p>and very, very particular kinds of limits that you need</p>
<p>to take with these very.</p>
<p>Right, and the limits will definitely work</p>
<p>the way we think they work.</p>
<p>And we can do all kinds of computer experiments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a hard derivation.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just the mathematical structure</p>
<p>kind of, you know, ends up running right into</p>
<p>computational irreducibility.</p>
<p>And you end up with a bunch of, a bunch of difficulty there.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the way that we&rsquo;re getting really confident</p>
<p>that we know completely what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>which is when people study things like black hole mergers,</p>
<p>using Einstein&rsquo;s equations, what do they actually do?</p>
<p>Well, they actually use Mathematica or a whole bunch</p>
<p>to analyze the equations and so on.</p>
<p>But in the end, they do numerical relativity,</p>
<p>which means they take these nice mathematical equations</p>
<p>and they break them down so that they can run them</p>
<p>on a computer.</p>
<p>And they break them down into something</p>
<p>which is actually a discrete approximation</p>
<p>to these equations.</p>
<p>Then they run them on a computer, they get results.</p>
<p>Then you look at the gravitational waves</p>
<p>and you see if they match, okay?</p>
<p>It turns out that our model gives you a direct way</p>
<p>to do numerical relativity.</p>
<p>So in other words, instead of saying,</p>
<p>you start from these continuum equations from Einstein,</p>
<p>you break them down into these discrete things,</p>
<p>you run them on a computer,</p>
<p>you say, we&rsquo;re doing it the other way around.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting from these discrete things</p>
<p>that come from our model.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just running big versions on the computer.</p>
<p>And, you know, what we&rsquo;re saying is,</p>
<p>and this is how things will work.</p>
<p>So the way I&rsquo;m calling this is proof by compilation,</p>
<p>so to speak, that is, in other words,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking something where, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got this description of a black hole system.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re showing that the, you know,</p>
<p>what we get by just running our model agrees</p>
<p>with what you would get by doing the computation</p>
<p>from the Einstein equations.</p>
<p>As a small tangent or actually a very big tangent,</p>
<p>but proof by compilation is a beautiful concept.</p>
<p>In a sense, the way of doing physics with this model</p>
<p>is by running it or compiling it.</p>
<p>And have you thought about,</p>
<p>and these things can be very large,</p>
<p>is there a totally new possibilities of computing hardware</p>
<p>and computing software,</p>
<p>which allows you to perform this kind of compilation?</p>
<p>Well, algorithms, software, hardware.</p>
<p>So first comment is these models seem to give one</p>
<p>a lot of intuition about distributed computing,</p>
<p>a lot of different intuition about how to think</p>
<p>about parallel computation.</p>
<p>And that particularly comes from the quantum mechanics</p>
<p>side of things, which we didn&rsquo;t talk about much yet.</p>
<p>But the question of what, you know,</p>
<p>given our current computer hardware,</p>
<p>how can we most efficiently simulate things?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually partly a story of the model itself,</p>
<p>because the model itself has deep parallelism in it.</p>
<p>The ways that we are simulating it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just starting to be able to use that deep parallelism</p>
<p>to be able to be more efficient</p>
<p>in the way that we simulate things.</p>
<p>But in fact, the structure of the model itself</p>
<p>allows us to think about parallel computation</p>
<p>in different ways.</p>
<p>And one of my realizations is that, you know,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very hard to get in your brain</p>
<p>how you deal with parallel computation.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re always worrying about, you know,</p>
<p>if multiple things can happen on different computers</p>
<p>at different times, oh, what happens</p>
<p>if this thing happens before that thing?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve really got, you know,</p>
<p>we have these race conditions where something can race</p>
<p>to get to the answer before another thing.</p>
<p>And you get all tangled up because you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>which thing is gonna come in first.</p>
<p>And usually when you do parallel computing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big obsession to lock things down</p>
<p>to the point where you&rsquo;ve had locks and mutexes</p>
<p>and God knows what else,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve arranged it so that there can only be</p>
<p>one sequence of things that can happen.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have to think about</p>
<p>all the different kinds of things that can happen.</p>
<p>Well, in these models, physics is throwing us into,</p>
<p>forcing us to think about all these possible things</p>
<p>that can happen.</p>
<p>But these models together with what we know from physics</p>
<p>is giving us new ways to think about</p>
<p>all possible things happening,</p>
<p>about all these different things happening in parallel.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m guessing&hellip;</p>
<p>They have built in protection for some of the parallelism.</p>
<p>Well, causal invariance is the built in protection.</p>
<p>Causal invariance is what means that</p>
<p>even though things happen in different orders,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter in the end.</p>
<p>As a person who struggled with concurrent programming</p>
<p>in like Java,</p>
<p>with all the basic concepts of concurrent programming,</p>
<p>that if there could be built up</p>
<p>a strong mathematical framework for causal invariance,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so liberating.</p>
<p>And that could be not just liberating,</p>
<p>but really powerful for massively distributed computation.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>No, I mean, what&rsquo;s eventual consistency</p>
<p>in distributed databases</p>
<p>is essentially the causal invariance idea.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>But have you thought about,</p>
<p>like really large simulations?</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I&rsquo;m also thinking about,</p>
<p>look, the fact is I&rsquo;ve spent much of my life</p>
<p>as a language designer, right?</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t possibly not think about,</p>
<p>what does this mean for designing languages</p>
<p>for parallel computation?</p>
<p>In fact, another thing that&rsquo;s one of these&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always embarrassed at how long it&rsquo;s taken me</p>
<p>to figure stuff out.</p>
<p>But back in the 1980s,</p>
<p>I worked on trying to make up languages</p>
<p>for parallel computation.</p>
<p>I thought about doing graph rewriting.</p>
<p>I thought about doing these kinds of things,</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t see how to actually make the connections</p>
<p>to actually do something useful.</p>
<p>I think now physics is kind of showing us</p>
<p>how to make those things useful.</p>
<p>And so my guess is that in time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be talking about, we do parallel programming.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be talking about programming</p>
<p>in a certain reference frame,</p>
<p>just as we think about thinking about physics</p>
<p>in a certain reference frame.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a certain coordination of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>We say, we&rsquo;re gonna program in this reference frame.</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s change the reference frame</p>
<p>to this reference frame.</p>
<p>And then our program will seem different</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have a different way to think about it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still the same program underneath.</p>
<p>So let me ask on this topic,</p>
<p>cause I put out that I&rsquo;m talking to you.</p>
<p>I got way more questions than I can deal with,</p>
<p>but what pops to mind is a question somebody asked</p>
<p>on Reddit I think is, please ask Dr. Wolfram,</p>
<p>what are the specs of the computer running the universe?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about specs of hardware and software</p>
<p>for simulations of a large scale thing.</p>
<p>What about a scale that is comparative</p>
<p>to something that eventually leads</p>
<p>to the two of us talking and about?</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>So actually I did try to estimate that.</p>
<p>And we actually have to go a couple more stages</p>
<p>before we can really get to that answer</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about this thing.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you build these abstract systems</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to explain the universe,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re quite a number of levels deep, so to speak.</p>
<p>But the&hellip;</p>
<p>You mean conceptually or like literally?</p>
<p>Cause you&rsquo;re talking about small objects</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s 10 to the 120 something.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>It is conceptually deep.</p>
<p>And one of the things that&rsquo;s happening sort of structurally</p>
<p>in this project is, you know, there were ideas,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another layer of ideas,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another layer of ideas</p>
<p>to get to the different things that correspond to physics.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just different layers of ideas.</p>
<p>And they are, you know, it&rsquo;s actually probably,</p>
<p>if anything, getting harder to explain this project</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m realizing that the fraction of way through</p>
<p>that I am so far and explaining this to you is less than,</p>
<p>than, you know, it might be because we know more now,</p>
<p>you know, every week basically we know a little bit more.</p>
<p>And like&hellip;</p>
<p>Those are just layers on the initial fundamental structure.</p>
<p>Yes, but the layers are, you know,</p>
<p>you might be asking me, you know,</p>
<p>how do we get the difference between fermions and bosons,</p>
<p>the difference between particles</p>
<p>that can be all in the same state</p>
<p>and particles that exclude each other, okay.</p>
<p>Last three days, we&rsquo;ve kind of figured that out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But, and it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very cool.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very&hellip;</p>
<p>And those are some kind of properties at a certain level,</p>
<p>layer of abstraction on the graph.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, but the layers of abstraction are kind of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re compounding.</p>
<p>Stacking up.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s difficult, but&hellip;</p>
<p>But okay.</p>
<p>But the specs nevertheless remain the same.</p>
<p>Okay, the specs underneath.</p>
<p>So I have an estimate.</p>
<p>So the question is, what are the units?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got these different fundamental constants</p>
<p>about the world.</p>
<p>So one of them is the speed of light, which is the&hellip;</p>
<p>So the thing that&rsquo;s always the same</p>
<p>in all these different ways of thinking about the universe</p>
<p>is the notion of time, because time is computation.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s an elementary time,</p>
<p>which is sort of the amount of time that we ascribe</p>
<p>to elapsing in a single computational step.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the elementary time.</p>
<p>So then there&rsquo;s an elementary&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a parameter or whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a constant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s whatever we define it to be,</p>
<p>because I mean, we don&rsquo;t, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s all relative, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Yes, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is,</p>
<p>because we could be, it could be slower.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a number which we use to convert that</p>
<p>to seconds, so to speak,</p>
<p>because we are experiencing things</p>
<p>and we say this amount of time has elapsed, so to speak.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re within this thing.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter, right?</p>
<p>But what does matter is the ratio,</p>
<p>what we can, the ratio of the spatial distance</p>
<p>and this hypergraph to this moment of time.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s an arbitrary thing,</p>
<p>but we measure that in meters per second, for example,</p>
<p>and that ratio is the speed of light.</p>
<p>So the ratio of the elementary distance</p>
<p>to the elementary time is the speed of light, okay?</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s another,</p>
<p>there are two other levels of this, okay?</p>
<p>So there is a thing which we can talk about,</p>
<p>which is the maximum entanglement speed,</p>
<p>which is a thing that happens at another level</p>
<p>in this whole sort of story</p>
<p>of how these things get constructed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sort of maximum speed in quantum,</p>
<p>in the space of quantum states.</p>
<p>Just as the speed of light</p>
<p>is a maximum speed in physical space,</p>
<p>this is a maximum speed in the space of quantum states.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another level which is associated</p>
<p>with what we call ruleal space,</p>
<p>which is another one of these maximum speeds.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get to this.</p>
<p>So these are limitations on the system</p>
<p>that are able to capture the kind of physical universe</p>
<p>which we live in.</p>
<p>The quantum mechanical.</p>
<p>There are inevitable features of having a rule</p>
<p>that has only a finite amount of information in the rule.</p>
<p>So long as you have a rule that only involves</p>
<p>a bounded amount, a limited amount of,</p>
<p>only involving a limited number of elements,</p>
<p>limited number of relations,</p>
<p>it is inevitable that there are these speed constraints.</p>
<p>We knew about the one for speed of light.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know about the one for maximum entanglement speed,</p>
<p>which is actually something that is possibly measurable,</p>
<p>particularly in black hole systems and things like this.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is long, long story short.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking what the processing specs of the universe,</p>
<p>of the sort of computation of the universe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a question of even what are the units</p>
<p>of some of these measurements, okay?</p>
<p>So the units I&rsquo;m using are Wolfram language instructions</p>
<p>per second, okay?</p>
<p>Because you gotta have some,</p>
<p>what computation are you doing?</p>
<p>There gotta be some kind of frame of reference.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So, because it turns out in the end,</p>
<p>there will be, there&rsquo;s sort of an arbitrariness</p>
<p>in the language that you use to describe the universe.</p>
<p>So in those terms, I think it&rsquo;s like 10 to the 500,</p>
<p>Wolfram language operations per second, I think,</p>
<p>is the, I think it&rsquo;s of that order.</p>
<p>You know, basically.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the scale of the computation.</p>
<p>What about memory?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s an interesting thing to say</p>
<p>about storage and memory.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a question of how many sort of atoms</p>
<p>of space might there be?</p>
<p>You know, maybe 10 to the 400.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly how to estimate these numbers.</p>
<p>I mean, this is based on some, I would say,</p>
<p>somewhat rickety way of estimating things.</p>
<p>You know, when there start to be able to be experiments done,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re lucky, there will be experiments</p>
<p>that can actually nail down some of these numbers.</p>
<p>And because of computation reducibility,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not much hope for very efficient compression,</p>
<p>like very efficient representation</p>
<p>of this atom space? Good question.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s probably certain things, you know,</p>
<p>the fact that we can deduce anything,</p>
<p>okay, the question is how deep does the reducibility go?</p>
<p>Right. Okay.</p>
<p>And I keep on being surprised</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a lot deeper than I thought.</p>
<p>Okay, and so one of the things is that,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a question of sort of how much</p>
<p>of the whole of physics do we have to be able to get</p>
<p>in order to explain certain kinds of phenomena?</p>
<p>Like for example, if we want to study quantum interference,</p>
<p>do we have to know what an electron is?</p>
<p>Turns out I thought we did, turns out we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I thought to know what energy is,</p>
<p>we would have to know what electrons were.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you get a lot of really powerful shortcuts.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of sort of bulk information about the world.</p>
<p>The thing that I&rsquo;m excited about last few days, okay,</p>
<p>is the idea of fermions versus bosons, fundamental idea</p>
<p>that I mean, it&rsquo;s the reason we have matter</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t just self destruct,</p>
<p>is because of the exclusion principle</p>
<p>that means that two electrons can never be</p>
<p>in the same quantum state.</p>
<p>Is it useful for us to maybe first talk</p>
<p>about how quantum mechanics fits</p>
<p>into the Wolfram physics model?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>So we talked about general relativity.</p>
<p>Now, what have you found from quantum mechanics</p>
<p>within and outside of the Wolfram physics?</p>
<p>Right, so I mean, the key idea of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>that sort of the typical interpretation</p>
<p>is classical physics says a definite thing happens.</p>
<p>Quantum physics says there&rsquo;s this whole set of paths</p>
<p>of things that might happen.</p>
<p>And we are just observing some overall probability</p>
<p>of how those paths work.</p>
<p>Okay, so when you think about our hypergraphs</p>
<p>and all these little updates that are going on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very remarkable thing to realize,</p>
<p>which is if you say, well,</p>
<p>which particular sequence of updates should you do?</p>
<p>Say, well, it&rsquo;s not really defined.</p>
<p>You can do any of a whole collection</p>
<p>of possible sequences of updates.</p>
<p>Okay, that set of possible sequences of updates</p>
<p>defines yet another kind of graph</p>
<p>that we call a multiway graph.</p>
<p>And a multiway graph just is a graph</p>
<p>where at every node, there is a choice</p>
<p>of several different possible things that could happen.</p>
<p>So for example, you go this way, you go that way.</p>
<p>Those are two different edges in the multiway graph.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re building up the set of possibilities.</p>
<p>So actually, like, for example, I just made the one,</p>
<p>the multiway graph for tic tac toe, okay?</p>
<p>So tic tac toe, you start off with some board</p>
<p>that, you know, is everything is blank,</p>
<p>and then somebody can put down an X somewhere,</p>
<p>an O somewhere, and then there are different possibilities.</p>
<p>At each stage, there are different possibilities.</p>
<p>And so you build up this multiway graph</p>
<p>of all those possibilities.</p>
<p>Now notice that even in tic tac toe,</p>
<p>you have the feature that there can be something</p>
<p>where you have two different things that happen</p>
<p>and then those branches merge</p>
<p>because you end up with the same shape,</p>
<p>you know, the same configuration of the board,</p>
<p>even though you got there in two different ways.</p>
<p>So the thing that&rsquo;s sort of an inevitable feature</p>
<p>of our models is that just like quantum mechanics suggests,</p>
<p>definite things don&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Instead, you get this whole multiway graph</p>
<p>of all these possibilities.</p>
<p>Okay, so then the question is, so, okay,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s sort of a picture of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Now you say, okay, well, quantum mechanics</p>
<p>has all these features of, you know,</p>
<p>all this mathematical structure and so on.</p>
<p>How do you get that mathematical structure?</p>
<p>Okay, a couple of things to say.</p>
<p>So quantum mechanics is actually, in a sense,</p>
<p>two different theories glued together.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics is the theory</p>
<p>of how quantum amplitudes work</p>
<p>that more or less give you the probabilities</p>
<p>of things happening.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the theory of quantum measurement,</p>
<p>which is the theory of how we actually</p>
<p>conclude definite things.</p>
<p>Because the mathematics just gives you</p>
<p>these quantum amplitudes, which are more or less</p>
<p>probabilities of things happening,</p>
<p>but yet we actually observe definite things in the world.</p>
<p>Quantum measurement has always been a bit mysterious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been something where people just say,</p>
<p>well, the mathematics says this,</p>
<p>but then you do a measurement,</p>
<p>and there are philosophical arguments</p>
<p>about what the measurement is.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not something where there&rsquo;s a theory</p>
<p>of the measurement.</p>
<p>Somebody on Reddit also asked,</p>
<p>please ask Stephen to tell his story</p>
<p>of the double slit experiment.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, I can.</p>
<p>Is that, does that make sense?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it makes sense.</p>
<p>Absolutely makes sense.</p>
<p>Why, is this like a good way to discuss?</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>Let me go, let me explain a couple of things first.</p>
<p>So the structure of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>is mathematically quite complicated.</p>
<p>One of the features, let&rsquo;s see,</p>
<p>well, how to describe this.</p>
<p>Okay, so first point is there&rsquo;s this multiway graph</p>
<p>of all these different paths of things</p>
<p>that can happen in the world.</p>
<p>And the important point is that these,</p>
<p>you can have branchings and you can have mergings.</p>
<p>Okay, so this property turns out causal invariance</p>
<p>is the statement that the number of mergings</p>
<p>is equal to the number of branchings.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in other words, every time there&rsquo;s a branch,</p>
<p>eventually there will also be a merge.</p>
<p>In other words, every time there were two possibilities</p>
<p>for what might&rsquo;ve happened, eventually those will merge.</p>
<p>Beautiful concept by the way, but yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So that idea, okay, so then, so that&rsquo;s one thing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s closely related to the sort of objectivity</p>
<p>in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>The fact that we believe definite things happen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because although there are all these different paths,</p>
<p>in some sense, because of causal invariance,</p>
<p>they all imply the same thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m cheating a little bit in saying that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s roughly the essence of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Okay, next thing to think about</p>
<p>is you have this multiway graph,</p>
<p>it has all these different possible things</p>
<p>that are happening.</p>
<p>Now we ask, this multiway graph</p>
<p>is sort of evolving with time.</p>
<p>Over time, it&rsquo;s branching, it&rsquo;s merging,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s doing all these things, okay?</p>
<p>Question we can ask is if we slice it at a particular time,</p>
<p>what do we see?</p>
<p>And that slice represents in a sense,</p>
<p>something to do with the state of the universe</p>
<p>at a particular time.</p>
<p>So in other words, we&rsquo;ve got this multiway graph</p>
<p>of all these possibilities,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re asking, okay, we take the slice,</p>
<p>this slice represents, okay,</p>
<p>each of these different paths</p>
<p>corresponds to a different quantum possibility</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>When we take the slice, we&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>what are the set of quantum possibilities</p>
<p>that exist at a particular time?</p>
<p>And when you say slice, you slice the graph</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a bunch of leaves.</p>
<p>A bunch of leaves.</p>
<p>Those represent the state of things.</p>
<p>Right, but then, okay, so the important thing</p>
<p>that you are quickly picking up on</p>
<p>is that what matters is kind of</p>
<p>how these leaves are related to each other.</p>
<p>So a good way to tell how leaves are related</p>
<p>is just to say on the step before</p>
<p>do they have a common ancestor?</p>
<p>So two leaves might be,</p>
<p>they might have just branched from one thing</p>
<p>or they might be far away,</p>
<p>way far apart in this graph</p>
<p>where to get to a common ancestor,</p>
<p>maybe you have to go all the way back</p>
<p>to the beginning of the graph,</p>
<p>all the way back to the beginning.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some kind of measure of distance.</p>
<p>Right, but what you get is by making the slice,</p>
<p>we call it branchial space, the space of branches.</p>
<p>And in this branchial space,</p>
<p>you have a graph that represents the relationships</p>
<p>between these quantum states in branchial space.</p>
<p>You have this notion of distance in branchial space.</p>
<p>Okay, so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s connected to quantum entanglement.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, it&rsquo;s basically,</p>
<p>the distance in branchial space</p>
<p>is kind of an entanglement distance.</p>
<p>So this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very nice model.</p>
<p>Right, it is very nice, it&rsquo;s very beautiful.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so clean.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really, and it tells one,</p>
<p>okay, so anyway, so then this branchial space</p>
<p>has this sort of map of the entanglements</p>
<p>between quantum states.</p>
<p>So in physical space, we have,</p>
<p>so you can say, take, let&rsquo;s say the causal graph,</p>
<p>and we can slice that at a particular time,</p>
<p>and then we get this map</p>
<p>of how things are laid out in physical space.</p>
<p>When we do the same kind of thing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thing called the multiway causal graph,</p>
<p>which is the analog of a causal graph</p>
<p>for the multiway system.</p>
<p>We slice that, we get essentially the relationships</p>
<p>between things, not in physical space,</p>
<p>but in the space of quantum states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like which quantum state</p>
<p>is similar to which other quantum state.</p>
<p>Okay, so now I think next thing to say</p>
<p>is just to mention how quantum measurement works.</p>
<p>So quantum measurement has to do with reference frames</p>
<p>in branchial space.</p>
<p>So, okay, so measurement in physical space,</p>
<p>it matters whether how we assign spatial position</p>
<p>and how we define coordinates in space and time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we make measurements in ordinary space.</p>
<p>Are we making a measurement based on us sitting still here?</p>
<p>Are we traveling at half the speed of light</p>
<p>and making measurements that way?</p>
<p>These are different reference frames</p>
<p>in which we&rsquo;re making our measurements.</p>
<p>And the relationship between different events</p>
<p>and different points in space and time</p>
<p>will be different depending on what reference frame we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Okay, so then we have this idea</p>
<p>of quantum observation frames,</p>
<p>which are the analog of reference frames,</p>
<p>but in branchial space.</p>
<p>And so what happens is what we realize</p>
<p>is that a quantum measurement is the observer</p>
<p>is sort of arbitrarily determining this reference frame.</p>
<p>The observer is saying, I&rsquo;m going to understand the world</p>
<p>by saying that space and time are coordinated this way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna understand the world by saying</p>
<p>that quantum states and time are coordinated in this way.</p>
<p>And essentially what happens is</p>
<p>that the process of quantum measurement</p>
<p>is a process of deciding how you slice up</p>
<p>this multiway system in these quantum observation frames.</p>
<p>So in a sense, the observer, the way the observer enters</p>
<p>is by their choice of these quantum observation frames.</p>
<p>And what happens is that the observer,</p>
<p>because, okay, this is again,</p>
<p>another stack of other concepts, but anyway,</p>
<p>because the observer is computationally bounded,</p>
<p>there is a limit to the type of quantum observation frames</p>
<p>that they can construct.</p>
<p>Interesting, okay, so there&rsquo;s some constraints,</p>
<p>some limit on the choice of observation frames.</p>
<p>Right, and by the way, I just want to mention</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a, I mean, it&rsquo;s bizarre,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a hierarchy of these things.</p>
<p>So in thermodynamics,</p>
<p>the fact that we believe entropy increases,</p>
<p>we believe things get more disordered,</p>
<p>is a consequence of the fact</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t track each individual molecule.</p>
<p>If we could track every single molecule,</p>
<p>we could run every movie in reverse, so to speak,</p>
<p>and we would not see that things are getting more disordered.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s because we are computationally bounded,</p>
<p>we can only look at these big blobs</p>
<p>of what all these molecules collectively do,</p>
<p>that we think that things are,</p>
<p>that we describe it in terms of entropy increasing</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same phenomenon, basically,</p>
<p>and also a consequence of computational irreducibility</p>
<p>that causes us to basically be forced to conclude</p>
<p>that definite things happen in the world,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s this quantum,</p>
<p>this set of all these different quantum processes</p>
<p>that are going on.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I&rsquo;m skipping a little bit,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a rough picture.</p>
<p>And in the evolution of the Wolfram Physics Project,</p>
<p>where do you feel we stand on some of the puzzles</p>
<p>that are along the way?</p>
<p>See, you&rsquo;re skipping along a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how much these things are unraveling.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, these things, look,</p>
<p>it used to be the case that I would agree with Dick Feynman,</p>
<p>nobody understands quantum mechanics, including me, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting to the point where I think</p>
<p>I actually understand quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>My exercise, okay, is can I explain quantum mechanics</p>
<p>for real at the level of kind of middle school</p>
<p>type explanation?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m getting closer, it&rsquo;s getting there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite there, I&rsquo;ve tried it a few times,</p>
<p>and I realized that there are things</p>
<p>where I have to start talking about</p>
<p>elaborate mathematical concepts and so on.</p>
<p>But I think, and you&rsquo;ve got to realize</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not self evident that we can explain</p>
<p>at an intuitively graspable level,</p>
<p>something which, about the way the universe works,</p>
<p>the universe wasn&rsquo;t built for our understanding,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>But I think then, okay, so another important idea</p>
<p>is this idea of branchial space, which I mentioned,</p>
<p>this sort of space of quantum states.</p>
<p>It is, okay, so I mentioned Einstein&rsquo;s equations</p>
<p>describing the effect of mass and energy</p>
<p>on trajectories of particles, on GD6.</p>
<p>The curvature of physical space is associated</p>
<p>with the presence of energy,</p>
<p>according to Einstein&rsquo;s equations, okay?</p>
<p>So it turns out that, rather amazingly,</p>
<p>the same thing is true in branchial space.</p>
<p>So it turns out the presence of energy</p>
<p>or more accurately Lagrangian density,</p>
<p>which is a kind of relativistic invariant version of energy,</p>
<p>the presence of that causes essentially deflection of GD6</p>
<p>in this branchial space, okay?</p>
<p>So you might say, so what?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that the sort of the best formulation</p>
<p>we have of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>this Feynman path integral,</p>
<p>is a thing that describes quantum processes</p>
<p>in terms of mathematics that can be interpreted as,</p>
<p>well, in quantum mechanics, the big thing</p>
<p>is you get these quantum amplitudes,</p>
<p>which are complex numbers that represent,</p>
<p>when you combine them together,</p>
<p>represent probabilities of things happening.</p>
<p>And so the big story has been,</p>
<p>how do you derive these quantum amplitudes?</p>
<p>And people think these quantum amplitudes,</p>
<p>they have a complex number,</p>
<p>has a real part and an imaginary part.</p>
<p>You can also think of it as a magnitude and a phase.</p>
<p>And people have sort of thought these quantum amplitudes</p>
<p>have magnitude and phase, and you compute those together.</p>
<p>Turns out that the magnitude and the phase</p>
<p>come from completely different places.</p>
<p>The magnitude comes, okay, so how do you compute things</p>
<p>in quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>Roughly, I&rsquo;m telling you, I&rsquo;m getting there</p>
<p>to be able to do this at a middle school level,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not there yet.</p>
<p>Roughly what happens is you&rsquo;re asking,</p>
<p>does this state in quantum mechanics</p>
<p>evolve to this other state in quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>And you can think about that like a particle traveling</p>
<p>or something traveling through physical space,</p>
<p>but instead it&rsquo;s traveling through branchial space.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s happening is, does this quantum state evolve</p>
<p>to this other quantum state?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying, does this object move</p>
<p>from this place in space to this other place in space?</p>
<p>Okay, now the way that these quantum amplitudes</p>
<p>characterize kind of to what extent the thing</p>
<p>will successfully reach some particular point</p>
<p>in branchial space, just like in physical space,</p>
<p>you could say, oh, it had a certain velocity</p>
<p>and it went in this direction.</p>
<p>In branchial space, there&rsquo;s a similar kind of concept.</p>
<p>Is there a nice way to visualize for me now</p>
<p>mentally branchial space?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you have this hypergraph,</p>
<p>sorry, you have this multiway graph.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this big branching thing, branching and merging thing.</p>
<p>But I mean, like moving through that space,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to understand what that looks like.</p>
<p>You know, that space is probably exponential dimensional,</p>
<p>which makes it again, another can of worms</p>
<p>in understanding what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>That space as in an ordinary space,</p>
<p>this hypergraph, the spatial hypergraph</p>
<p>limits to something which is like a manifold,</p>
<p>like something like three dimensional space.</p>
<p>Almost certainly the multiway graph limits</p>
<p>to a Hilbert space, which is something that,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just a weird exponential dimensional space.</p>
<p>And by the way, you can ask, I mean,</p>
<p>there are much weirder things that go on.</p>
<p>For example, one of the things I&rsquo;ve been interested in</p>
<p>is the expansion of the universe in branchial space.</p>
<p>So we know the universe is expanding in physical space,</p>
<p>but the universe is probably also expanding</p>
<p>in branchial space.</p>
<p>So that means the number of quantum states</p>
<p>of the universe is increasing with time.</p>
<p>The diameter of the thing is growing.</p>
<p>Right, so that means that the,</p>
<p>and by the way, this is related</p>
<p>to whether quantum computing can ever work.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Okay, so let me explain why.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about, okay, so first of all,</p>
<p>just to finish the thought about quantum amplitudes,</p>
<p>that the incredibly beautiful thing,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just very excited about this.</p>
<p>The fine path integral is this formula.</p>
<p>It says that the amplitude, the quantum amplitude</p>
<p>is E to the I S over H bar,</p>
<p>where S is the thing called the action.</p>
<p>And it, okay, so that can be thought of</p>
<p>as representing a deflection of the angle</p>
<p>of this path in the multiway graph.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a deflection of a geodesic in the multiway path</p>
<p>that is caused by this thing called the action,</p>
<p>which is essentially associated with energy, okay?</p>
<p>And so this is a deflection of a path in branchial space</p>
<p>that is described by this path integral,</p>
<p>which is the thing that is the mathematical essence</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Turns out that deflection is,</p>
<p>the deflection of geodesics in branchial space</p>
<p>follows the exact same mathematical setup</p>
<p>as the deflection of geodesics in physical space,</p>
<p>except the deflection of geodesics in physical space</p>
<p>is described with Einstein&rsquo;s equations.</p>
<p>The deflection of geodesics in branchial space</p>
<p>is defined by the Feynman path integral,</p>
<p>and they are the same.</p>
<p>In other words, they are mathematically the same.</p>
<p>So that means that general relativity</p>
<p>is a story of essentially motion in physical space.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics is a story of essentially motion</p>
<p>in branchial space.</p>
<p>And the underlying equation for those two things,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s presented differently</p>
<p>because one&rsquo;s interested in different things</p>
<p>in branchial space than physical space,</p>
<p>but the underlying equation is the same.</p>
<p>So in other words, it&rsquo;s just these two theories,</p>
<p>which are those two sort of pillars</p>
<p>of 20th century physics,</p>
<p>which have seemed to be off in different directions,</p>
<p>are actually facets of the exact same theory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exciting to see where that evolves</p>
<p>and exciting that that just is there.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, to me,</p>
<p>look, having spent some part of my early life</p>
<p>working in the context of these theories</p>
<p>of 20th century physics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, they just, they seem so different.</p>
<p>And the fact that they&rsquo;re really the same</p>
<p>is just really amazing.</p>
<p>Actually, you mentioned double slit experiment, okay?</p>
<p>So the double slit experiment</p>
<p>is an interference phenomenon where you say there are,</p>
<p>you can have a photon or an electron,</p>
<p>and you say there are these two slits</p>
<p>that could have gone through either one,</p>
<p>but there is this interference pattern</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s destructive interference,</p>
<p>where you might&rsquo;ve said in classical physics,</p>
<p>oh, well, if there are two slits,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a better chance</p>
<p>that it gets through one or the other of them.</p>
<p>But in quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this phenomenon of destructive interference</p>
<p>that means that even though there are two slits,</p>
<p>two can lead to nothing,</p>
<p>as opposed to two leading to more</p>
<p>than, for example, one slit.</p>
<p>And what happens in this model,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve just been understanding this</p>
<p>in the last few weeks, actually,</p>
<p>is that what essentially happens</p>
<p>is that the double slit experiment</p>
<p>is a story of the interface</p>
<p>between branchial space and physical space.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s essentially happening</p>
<p>is that the destructive interference</p>
<p>is the result of the two possible paths</p>
<p>associated with photons going through those two slits</p>
<p>winding up at opposite ends of branchial space.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s sort of nothing there</p>
<p>when you look at it,</p>
<p>is because these two different sort of branches</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get merged together</p>
<p>to produce something that you can measure</p>
<p>in physical space.</p>
<p>Is there a lot to be understood about branchial space?</p>
<p>I guess, mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a very beautiful mathematical thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very, I mean, by the way,</p>
<p>this whole theory is just amazingly rich</p>
<p>in terms of the mathematics that it says should exist.</p>
<p>Okay, so for example,</p>
<p>calculus is a story of infinitesimal change</p>
<p>in integer dimensional space,</p>
<p>one dimensional, two dimensional, three dimensional space.</p>
<p>We need a theory of infinitesimal change</p>
<p>in fractional dimensional and dynamic dimensional space.</p>
<p>No such theory exists.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s tools of mathematics that are needed here.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And this is a motivation for that actually.</p>
<p>Right, and there are indications</p>
<p>and we can do computer experiments</p>
<p>and we can see how it&rsquo;s gonna come out,</p>
<p>but we need to, the actual mathematics doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>And in branchial space, it&rsquo;s actually even worse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even more sort of layers of mathematics that are,</p>
<p>we can see how it works roughly</p>
<p>by doing computer experiments,</p>
<p>but to really understand it,</p>
<p>we need more sort of mathematical sophistication.</p>
<p>So quantum computers.</p>
<p>Okay, so the basic idea of quantum computers,</p>
<p>the promise of quantum computers</p>
<p>is quantum mechanics does things in parallel.</p>
<p>And so you can sort of intrinsically do computations</p>
<p>in parallel.</p>
<p>And somehow that can be much more efficient</p>
<p>than just doing them one after another.</p>
<p>And I actually worked on quantum computing a bit</p>
<p>with Dick Feynman back in 1981, two, three,</p>
<p>that kind of timeframe.</p>
<p>And we&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating image.</p>
<p>You and Feynman working on quantum computers.</p>
<p>Well, we tried to work,</p>
<p>the big thing we tried to do was invent a randomness chip</p>
<p>that would generate randomness at a high speed</p>
<p>using quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>And the discovery that that wasn&rsquo;t really possible</p>
<p>was part of the story of,</p>
<p>we never really wrote anything about it.</p>
<p>I think maybe he wrote some stuff,</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t write stuff about what we figured out</p>
<p>about sort of the fact that it really seemed like</p>
<p>the measurement process in quantum mechanics</p>
<p>was a serious damper on what was possible to do</p>
<p>in sort of the possible advantages of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>for computing.</p>
<p>But anyway, so the sort of the promise of quantum computing</p>
<p>is let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re trying to factor an integer.</p>
<p>Well, you can, instead of,</p>
<p>when you factor an integer, you might say,</p>
<p>well, does this factor work?</p>
<p>Does this factor work?</p>
<p>In ordinary computing,</p>
<p>it seems like we pretty much just have to try</p>
<p>all these different factors,</p>
<p>kind of one after another.</p>
<p>But in quantum mechanics, you might have the idea,</p>
<p>oh, you can just sort of have the physics,</p>
<p>try all of them in parallel, okay?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this algorithm, Shor&rsquo;s algorithm,</p>
<p>which allows you,</p>
<p>according to the formalism of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>to do everything in parallel</p>
<p>and to do it much faster than you can on a classical computer.</p>
<p>Okay, the only little footnote is</p>
<p>you have to figure out what the answer is.</p>
<p>You have to measure the result.</p>
<p>So the quantum mechanics internally has figured out</p>
<p>all these different branches,</p>
<p>but then you have to pull all these branches together</p>
<p>to say, and the classical answer is this, okay?</p>
<p>The standard theory of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>does not tell you how to do that.</p>
<p>It tells you how the branching works,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t tell you the process</p>
<p>of corralling all these things together.</p>
<p>And that process, which intuitively you can see</p>
<p>is gonna be kind of tricky,</p>
<p>but our model actually does tell you</p>
<p>how that process of pulling things together works.</p>
<p>And the answer seems to be, we&rsquo;re not absolutely sure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only got to two times three so far</p>
<p>which is kind of in this factorization</p>
<p>in quantum computers.</p>
<p>But we can, what seems to be the case</p>
<p>is that the advantage you get from the parallelization</p>
<p>from quantum mechanics is lost</p>
<p>from the amount that you have to spend</p>
<p>pulling together all those parallel threads</p>
<p>to get to a classical answer at the end.</p>
<p>Now, that phenomenon is not unrelated</p>
<p>to various decoherence phenomena</p>
<p>that are seen in practical quantum computers and so on.</p>
<p>I mean, I should say as a very practical point,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, should people stop bothering</p>
<p>to do quantum computing research?</p>
<p>No, because what they&rsquo;re really doing</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re trying to use physics</p>
<p>to get to a new level of what&rsquo;s possible in computing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a completely valid activity.</p>
<p>Whether you can really put, you know,</p>
<p>whether you can say,</p>
<p>oh, you can solve an NP complete problem.</p>
<p>You can reduce exponential time to polynomial time.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re not sure.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m suspecting the answer is no,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not relevant to the practical speed ups</p>
<p>you can get by using different kinds of technologies,</p>
<p>different kinds of physics to do basic computing.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying, I mean,</p>
<p>some of the models you&rsquo;re playing with,</p>
<p>the indication is that to get all the sheep back together</p>
<p>and, you know, to corral everything together,</p>
<p>to get the actual solution to the algorithm is&hellip;</p>
<p>You lose all the&hellip;</p>
<p>You lose all of the&hellip;</p>
<p>By the way, I mean, so again, this question,</p>
<p>do we actually know what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>about quantum computing and so on?</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re doing proof by compilation.</p>
<p>So we have a quantum computing framework</p>
<p>in Wolfram language,</p>
<p>and which is, you know,</p>
<p>a standard quantum computing framework</p>
<p>that represents things in terms of the standard,</p>
<p>you know, formalism of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>And we have a compiler that simply compiles</p>
<p>the representation of quantum gates into multiway systems.</p>
<p>So, and in fact, the message that I got</p>
<p>was from somebody who&rsquo;s working on the project</p>
<p>who has managed to compile one of the sort of</p>
<p>a core formalism based on category theory</p>
<p>and core quantum formalism into multiway systems.</p>
<p>So this is&hellip;</p>
<p>When you say multiway system, these multiway graphs?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re compiling&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And then you can do all kinds of experiments</p>
<p>on that multiway graph.</p>
<p>Right, but the point is that what we&rsquo;re saying is</p>
<p>the thing we&rsquo;ve got this representation</p>
<p>of let&rsquo;s say Shor&rsquo;s algorithm</p>
<p>in terms of standard quantum gates.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a pure matter of sort of computation</p>
<p>to just say that is equivalent.</p>
<p>We will get the same result as running this multiway system.</p>
<p>Can you do complexity analysis on that multiway system?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been trying to do, yes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting there.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t done that yet.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a pretty good indication</p>
<p>of how that&rsquo;s gonna work out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done, as I say, our computer experiments.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve unimpressively gotten to about two times three</p>
<p>in terms of factorization,</p>
<p>which is kind of about how far people have got</p>
<p>with physical quantum computers as well.</p>
<p>But yes, we will be able to do&hellip;</p>
<p>We definitely will be able to do complexity analysis</p>
<p>and we will be able to know.</p>
<p>So the one remaining hope for quantum computing</p>
<p>really, really working at this formal level</p>
<p>of quantum brand exponential stuff being done</p>
<p>in polynomial time and so on.</p>
<p>The one hope, which is very bizarre,</p>
<p>is that you can kind of piggyback</p>
<p>on the expansion of branchial space.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how that might work.</p>
<p>So you think, you know, energy conservation,</p>
<p>standard thing in high school physics,</p>
<p>energy is conserved, right?</p>
<p>But now you imagine, you think about energy</p>
<p>in the context of cosmology</p>
<p>and the context of the whole universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a much more complicated story.</p>
<p>The expansion of the universe kind of violates</p>
<p>energy conservation.</p>
<p>And so for example, if you imagine you&rsquo;ve got two galaxies,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re receding from each other very quickly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got two big central black holes.</p>
<p>You connect a spring between these two central black holes.</p>
<p>Not easy to do in practice,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s imagine you could do it.</p>
<p>Now that spring is being pulled apart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting more potential energy in the spring</p>
<p>as a result of the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>So in a sense, you are piggybacking on the expansion</p>
<p>that exists in the universe</p>
<p>and the sort of violation of energy conservation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with that cosmological expansion</p>
<p>to essentially get energy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re essentially building a perpetual motion machine</p>
<p>by using the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>And that is a physical version of that.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that the same thing can be done</p>
<p>in branchial space to essentially mine the expansion</p>
<p>of the universe in branchial space</p>
<p>as a way to get sort of quantum computing for free,</p>
<p>so to speak, just from the expansion of the universe</p>
<p>in branchial space.</p>
<p>Now, the physical space version is kind of absurd</p>
<p>and involves springs between black holes and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conceivable that the branchial space version</p>
<p>is not as absurd</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s actually something you can reach</p>
<p>with physical things you can build in labs and so on.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>Okay, so like you were saying,</p>
<p>the branch of space might be expanding</p>
<p>and there might be something that could be exploited.</p>
<p>Right, in the same kind of way</p>
<p>that you can exploit that expansion of the universe</p>
<p>in principle, in physical space.</p>
<p>You just have like a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Right, I think that the,</p>
<p>look, I think the real answer is going to be</p>
<p>that for practical purposes,</p>
<p>the official brand that says you can do exponential things</p>
<p>in polynomial time is probably not gonna work.</p>
<p>For people curious to kind of learn more,</p>
<p>so this is more like, it&rsquo;s not middle school,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go to elementary school for a second.</p>
<p>Maybe middle school, let&rsquo;s go to middle school.</p>
<p>So if I were to try to maybe write a pamphlet</p>
<p>of like Wolfram physics project for dummies,</p>
<p>AKA for me, or maybe make a video on the basics,</p>
<p>but not just the basics of the physics project,</p>
<p>but the basics plus the most beautiful central ideas.</p>
<p>How would you go about doing that?</p>
<p>Could you help me out a little bit?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I mean, as a really practical matter,</p>
<p>we have this kind of visual summary picture that we made,</p>
<p>which I think is a pretty good,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;ve tried to explain this to people</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a pretty good place to start.</p>
<p>As you got this rule, you apply the rule,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building up this big hypergraph,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got all these possibilities,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of thinking about that</p>
<p>in terms of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a decent place to start.</p>
<p>So basically the things we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>which is space represented as a hypergraph,</p>
<p>transformation of that space is kind of time.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then&hellip;</p>
<p>Structure of that space,</p>
<p>the curvature of that space has gravity.</p>
<p>That can be explained without going anywhere</p>
<p>near quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s actually easier to explain</p>
<p>than special relativity.</p>
<p>Oh, so going into general, so go into curvature.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, special relativity,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little bit elaborate to explain.</p>
<p>And honestly, you only care about it</p>
<p>if you know about special relativity,</p>
<p>if you know how special relativity</p>
<p>is ordinarily derived and so on.</p>
<p>So general relativity is easier.</p>
<p>Is easier, yes.</p>
<p>And then what about quantum?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the easiest way to reveal&hellip;</p>
<p>I think the basic point is just this.</p>
<p>This fact that there are all these different branches,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this kind of map of how the branches work.</p>
<p>And that, I mean, I think actually the recent things</p>
<p>that we have about the double slit experiment</p>
<p>are pretty good, because you can actually see this.</p>
<p>You can see how the double slit phenomenon arises</p>
<p>from just features of these graphs.</p>
<p>Now, having said that,</p>
<p>there is a little bit of sleight of hand there</p>
<p>because the true story of the way</p>
<p>that double slit thing works</p>
<p>depends on the coordination of branchial space</p>
<p>that, for example, in our internal team,</p>
<p>there is still a vigorous battle going on</p>
<p>about how that works.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s becoming clear is&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s becoming clear</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s mathematically really quite interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, that is that there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>It involves essentially putting space filling curves.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll basically have a thing</p>
<p>which is naturally two dimensional,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sort of mapping it into one dimension</p>
<p>with a space filling curve.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, why is it this space filling curve</p>
<p>and another space filling curve?</p>
<p>And that becomes a story about Riemann surfaces and things,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite elaborate.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a more, a little bit sleight of hand way</p>
<p>of doing it where it&rsquo;s surprisingly direct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>So a question that might be difficult to answer,</p>
<p>but for several levels of people,</p>
<p>could you give me advice on how we can learn more?</p>
<p>Specifically, there is people that are completely outside</p>
<p>and just curious and are captivated</p>
<p>by the beauty of hypergraphs, actually.</p>
<p>So people that just wanna explore, play around with this.</p>
<p>Second level is people from, say, people like me</p>
<p>who somehow got a PhD in computer science,</p>
<p>but are not physicists.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, the work you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is of computational nature.</p>
<p>So it feels very accessible.</p>
<p>So what can a person like that do to learn enough physics</p>
<p>or not to be able to, one, explore the beauty of it,</p>
<p>and two, the final level of contribute something</p>
<p>of a level of even publishable,</p>
<p>like strong, interesting ideas.</p>
<p>So at all those layers, complete beginner,</p>
<p>a CS person, and the CS person that wants to publish.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that, I&rsquo;ve written a bunch of stuff,</p>
<p>a person called Jonathan Gorod,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been a key person working on this project,</p>
<p>has also written a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>And some other people started writing things too.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a physicist.</p>
<p>Physicist.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s, I would say, a mathematical physicist.</p>
<p>Mathematical.</p>
<p>Mathematical physicist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pretty mathematically sophisticated.</p>
<p>He regularly outmathematicizes me.</p>
<p>Yeah, strong mathematical physicist.</p>
<p>Yeah, I looked at some of the papers.</p>
<p>Right, but so, I mean,</p>
<p>I wrote this kind of original announcement blog post</p>
<p>about this project, which people seem to have found.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really happy, actually, that people who,</p>
<p>people seem to have grokked key points from that,</p>
<p>much deeper key points, people seem to have grokked</p>
<p>than I thought they would grokk.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a kind of a long blog post</p>
<p>that explains some of the things we talked about,</p>
<p>like the hypergraph and the basic rules.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, does it, I forget,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have any quantum mechanics in here.</p>
<p>It does. It does.</p>
<p>But we know a little bit more since that blog post</p>
<p>that probably clarifies,</p>
<p>but that blog post does a pretty decent job.</p>
<p>And, you know, talking about things like, again,</p>
<p>something we didn&rsquo;t mention,</p>
<p>the fact that the uncertainty principle</p>
<p>is a consequence of curvature in branchial space.</p>
<p>How much physics should a person know</p>
<p>to be able to understand the beauty of this framework</p>
<p>and to contribute something novel?</p>
<p>Okay, so I think that those are different questions.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I think that the, why does this work?</p>
<p>Why does this make any sense?</p>
<p>To really know that,</p>
<p>you have to know a fair amount of physics, okay?</p>
<p>And for example, have a decent understanding.</p>
<p>When you say, why does this work?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re referring to the connection between this model</p>
<p>and general relativity, for example.</p>
<p>You have to understand something about general relativity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a side of this where just</p>
<p>as the pure mathematical framework is fascinating.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If you throw the physics out completely.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s quite accessible to, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>I wrote this sort of long technical introduction</p>
<p>to the project, which seems to have been very accessible</p>
<p>to people who are, you know, who understand computation</p>
<p>and formal abstract ideas, but are not specialists</p>
<p>in physics or other kinds of things.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing with the physics part of it is,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s both a way of thinking</p>
<p>and literally a mathematical formalism.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>to know that we get the Einstein equations,</p>
<p>to know we get the energy momentum tensor,</p>
<p>you kind of have to know what the energy momentum tensor is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s physics.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of graduate level physics basically.</p>
<p>And so that, you know, making that final connection</p>
<p>is requires some depth of physics knowledge.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the unfortunate thing,</p>
<p>the difference in machine learning and physics</p>
<p>in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Is it really out of reach of a year or two worth of study?</p>
<p>No, you could get it in a year or two,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t get it in a month.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>So, but it doesn&rsquo;t require necessarily like 15 years.</p>
<p>No, it does not.</p>
<p>And in fact, a lot of what has happened with this project</p>
<p>makes a lot of this stuff much more accessible.</p>
<p>There are things where it has been quite difficult</p>
<p>to explain what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And it requires much more, you know,</p>
<p>having the concreteness of being able to do simulations,</p>
<p>knowing that this thing that you might&rsquo;ve thought</p>
<p>was just an analogy is really actually what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>makes one feel much more secure</p>
<p>about just sort of saying, this is how this works.</p>
<p>And I think it will be, you know,</p>
<p>the, I&rsquo;m hoping the textbooks of the future,</p>
<p>the physics textbooks of the future,</p>
<p>there will be a certain compression.</p>
<p>There will be things that used to be</p>
<p>very much more elaborate because for example,</p>
<p>even doing continuous mathematics</p>
<p>versus this discrete mathematics,</p>
<p>that, you know, to know how things work</p>
<p>in continuous mathematics,</p>
<p>you have to be talking about stuff</p>
<p>and waving your hands about things.</p>
<p>Whereas with discrete, the discrete version,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like, here is a picture.</p>
<p>This is how it works.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no, oh, do we get the limit right?</p>
<p>Did this, you know, did this thing that is of,</p>
<p>you know, zero, you know, measure zero object,</p>
<p>you know, interact with this thing in the right way.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have that whole discussion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, here&rsquo;s a picture, you know,</p>
<p>this is what it does.</p>
<p>And, you know, you can, then it takes more effort to say,</p>
<p>what does it do in the limit when the picture gets very big?</p>
<p>But you can do experiments</p>
<p>to build up an intuition actually.</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>And you can get sort of core intuition for what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of contributing to this, the, you know,</p>
<p>I would say that the study of the computational universe</p>
<p>and how all these programs work</p>
<p>in the computational universe,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just an unbelievable amount to do there.</p>
<p>And it is very close to the surface.</p>
<p>That is, you know, high school kids,</p>
<p>you can do experiments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, you know, and you can discover things.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, we, you can discover stuff about,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like this thing about expansion</p>
<p>of branchial space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an absolutely accessible thing to look at.</p>
<p>Now, you know, the main issue with doing these things</p>
<p>is not, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of technical depth difficulty</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>The actual doing of the experiments, you know,</p>
<p>all the code is all on our website to do all these things.</p>
<p>The real thing is sort of the judgment</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s the right experiment to do.</p>
<p>How do you interpret what you see?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the part that, you know,</p>
<p>people will do amazing things with.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the part that, but,</p>
<p>but it isn&rsquo;t like you have to have done 10 years of study</p>
<p>to get to the point where you can do the experiments.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cool thing you can do experiments day one,</p>
<p>basically.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the amazing thing about,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve actually put the tools out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mysterious.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still, I would say, maybe you can correct me.</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s a huge number of log hanging fruit</p>
<p>on the mathematical side, at least not the physics side,</p>
<p>perhaps.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s, look on the, on the, okay.</p>
<p>On the physics side, we are,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re definitely in harvesting mode, you know.</p>
<p>Of which, which fruit, the low hanging ones or?</p>
<p>The low hanging ones, yeah, right.</p>
<p>I mean, basically here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain list of, you know,</p>
<p>here are the effects in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Here are the effects in general activity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like industrial harvesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, can we get this one, this one, this one,</p>
<p>this one, this one?</p>
<p>And the thing that&rsquo;s really, you know,</p>
<p>interesting and satisfying, and it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>is one climbing the right mountain?</p>
<p>Does one have the right model?</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s just amazing is, you know,</p>
<p>we keep on like, are we going to get this one?</p>
<p>How hard is this one?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, you know, it looks really hard.</p>
<p>It looks really hard.</p>
<p>Oh, actually we can get it.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re continually surprised.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like I&rsquo;ve been following your progress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of exciting.</p>
<p>All the, in harvesting mode,</p>
<p>all the things you&rsquo;re picking up along the way.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>No, I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the thing that is,</p>
<p>I keep on thinking it&rsquo;s going to be more difficult</p>
<p>than it is.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a, you know, that&rsquo;s a, who knows what,</p>
<p>I mean, the one thing, so the, the, the,</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s been a, was a big thing</p>
<p>that I think we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re pretty close to.</p>
<p>I mean, I can give you a little bit of the roadmap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of interesting to see, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>what are particles?</p>
<p>What are things like electrons?</p>
<p>How do they really work?</p>
<p>Are you close to get like, what, what&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>are you close to trying to understand like the atom,</p>
<p>the electrons, neutrons, protons?</p>
<p>Okay, so this is, this is the stack.</p>
<p>So the first thing we want to understand is</p>
<p>the quantization of spin.</p>
<p>So particles, they, they kind of spin,</p>
<p>they have a certain angular momentum,</p>
<p>that angular momentum,</p>
<p>even though the masses of particles are all over the place,</p>
<p>you know, the electron has a mass of 0.511 MeV,</p>
<p>but you know, the proton is 938 MeV, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>et cetera, they&rsquo;re all kind of random numbers.</p>
<p>The, the spins of all these particles</p>
<p>are either integers or half integers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fact that was discovered in the 1920s, I guess.</p>
<p>The, I think that we are close to understanding</p>
<p>why spin is quantized.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a, and it, it appears to be</p>
<p>a quite elaborate mathematical story</p>
<p>about homotopic groups in twister space</p>
<p>and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>But bottom line is that seems within reach.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s a big deal</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a very core feature of understanding</p>
<p>how particles work in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Another core feature is this difference between particles</p>
<p>that obey the exclusion principle and sort of stay apart,</p>
<p>that leads to the stability of matter and things like that,</p>
<p>and particles that love to get together</p>
<p>and be in the same state, things like photons,</p>
<p>that, and that&rsquo;s what leads to phenomena like lasers,</p>
<p>where you can get sort of coherently</p>
<p>everything in the same state.</p>
<p>That difference is the particles of integer spin</p>
<p>are bosons like to get together in the same state,</p>
<p>the particles of half integer spin are fermions,</p>
<p>like electrons that they tend to stay apart.</p>
<p>And so the question is, can we get that in our models?</p>
<p>And, oh, just the last few days, I think we made,</p>
<p>I mean, I think the story of,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s one of these things where we&rsquo;re really close.</p>
<p>Is this connected fermions and bosons?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So this was what happens is what seems to happen, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, subject to revision in the next few days.</p>
<p>But what seems to be the case is that</p>
<p>bosons are associated with essentially</p>
<p>merging in multiway graphs,</p>
<p>and fermions are associated with branching</p>
<p>in multiway graphs.</p>
<p>And that essentially the exclusion principle</p>
<p>is the fact that in branchial space,</p>
<p>things have a certain extent in branchial space</p>
<p>that in which things are being sort of forced apart</p>
<p>in branchial space, whereas the case of bosons,</p>
<p>they get, they come together in branchial space.</p>
<p>And the real question is, can we explain the relationship</p>
<p>between that and these things called spinners,</p>
<p>which are the representation of half integer spin particles</p>
<p>that have this weird feature that usually when you go</p>
<p>around 360 degree rotation,</p>
<p>you get back to where you started from.</p>
<p>But for a spinner, you don&rsquo;t get back</p>
<p>to where you started from.</p>
<p>It takes 720 degrees of rotation to get back</p>
<p>to where you started from.</p>
<p>And we are just, it feels like we are,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just incredibly close to actually having that,</p>
<p>understanding how that works.</p>
<p>And it turns out, it looks like,</p>
<p>my current speculation is that it&rsquo;s as simple</p>
<p>as the directed hypergraphs versus undirected hypergraphs,</p>
<p>the relationship between spinners and vectors.</p>
<p>So, which is just interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be interesting if these are all these kind</p>
<p>of nice properties of this multi way graphs of branching</p>
<p>and rejoining.</p>
<p>Spinners have been very mysterious.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s what they turn out to be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be an easy explanation</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Directive versus undirective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, and that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s only two different cases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why are spinners important in quantum mechanics?</p>
<p>Can you just give a&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, so spinners are important because they are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the representation of electrons</p>
<p>which have half an inch of spin.</p>
<p>They are, the wave functions of electrons are spinners.</p>
<p>Just like the wave functions of photons are vectors,</p>
<p>the wave functions of electrons are spinners.</p>
<p>And they have this property that when you rotate</p>
<p>by 360 degrees, they come back to minus one of themselves</p>
<p>and take 720 degrees to get back to the original value.</p>
<p>And they are a consequence of,</p>
<p>we usually think of rotation in space as being,</p>
<p>when you have this notion of rotational invariance</p>
<p>and rotational invariance, as we ordinarily experience it,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the feature.</p>
<p>If you go through 360 degrees,</p>
<p>you go back to where you started from,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not true for electrons.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why understanding how that works is important.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been playing with Mobius Strip</p>
<p>quite a bit lately, just for fun.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>It adds some funk, it has the same kind of funky properties.</p>
<p>Yes, right, exactly.</p>
<p>You can have this so called belt trick,</p>
<p>which is this way of taking an extended object</p>
<p>and you can see properties like spinners</p>
<p>with that kind of extended object that&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, it would be very cool if there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it somehow connects the directive versus undirective.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be as simple as that, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the thing that,</p>
<p>this is the big sort of bizarre surprise is that,</p>
<p>because I learned physics as probably, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a fifth generation in the sense that,</p>
<p>if you go back to the 1920s and so on,</p>
<p>there were the people who were originating</p>
<p>quantum mechanics and so on.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a little less than that.</p>
<p>Maybe I was like a third generation or something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but the people from whom I learned physics</p>
<p>were the people who had been students of the students</p>
<p>of the people who originated</p>
<p>the current understanding of physics.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re now at probably the seventh generation</p>
<p>of physicists or something</p>
<p>from the early days of 20th century physics.</p>
<p>And whenever a field gets that many generations deep,</p>
<p>it seems the foundations seem quite inaccessible.</p>
<p>And they seem, it seems like</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t possibly understand that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through seven academic generations</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s been, you know, that&rsquo;s been this thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been difficult to understand for that long.</p>
<p>It just can&rsquo;t be that simple.</p>
<p>But in a sense, maybe that journey takes you</p>
<p>to a simple explanation that was there all along.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole. Right, right, right.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, and the thing for me personally,</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s been quite interesting is, you know,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect this project to work in this way.</p>
<p>And I, you know, but I had this sort of weird piece</p>
<p>of personal history that I used to be a physicist</p>
<p>and I used to do all this stuff.</p>
<p>And I know, you know, the standard canon of physics,</p>
<p>I knew it very well.</p>
<p>And, you know, but then I&rsquo;d been working</p>
<p>on this kind of computational paradigm</p>
<p>for basically 40 years.</p>
<p>And the fact that, you know, I&rsquo;m sort of now coming back</p>
<p>to, you know, trying to apply that in physics,</p>
<p>it kind of felt like that journey was necessary.</p>
<p>Was this, when did you first try to play with a hypergraph?</p>
<p>So what happened is,</p>
<p>yeah, so what I had was, okay, so this is again,</p>
<p>you know, one always feels dumb after the fact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious after the fact.</p>
<p>But so back in the early 1990s,</p>
<p>I realized that using graphs</p>
<p>as a sort of underlying thing underneath space and time</p>
<p>was going to be a useful thing to do.</p>
<p>I figured out about multiway systems.</p>
<p>I figured out the things about general relativity</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d figured out by the end of the 1990s.</p>
<p>But I always felt there was a certain inelegance</p>
<p>because I was using these graphs</p>
<p>and there were certain constraints on these graphs</p>
<p>that seemed like they were kind of awkward.</p>
<p>It was kind of like, you can pick,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you couldn&rsquo;t pick any rule.</p>
<p>It was like pick any number, but the number has to be prime.</p>
<p>It was kind of like you couldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it was kind of an awkward special constraint.</p>
<p>I had these trivalent graphs,</p>
<p>graphs with just three connections from every node.</p>
<p>Okay, so, but I discovered a bunch of stuff with that.</p>
<p>And I thought it was kind of inelegant.</p>
<p>And, you know, the other piece of sort of personal history</p>
<p>is obviously I spent my life</p>
<p>as a computational language designer.</p>
<p>And so the story of computational language design</p>
<p>is a story of how do you take all these random ideas</p>
<p>in the world and kind of grind them down</p>
<p>into something that is computationally</p>
<p>as simple as possible.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I&rsquo;ve been very interested</p>
<p>in kind of simple computational frameworks</p>
<p>for representing things and have, you know,</p>
<p>ridiculous amounts of experience in trying to do that.</p>
<p>And actually all of those trajectories of your life</p>
<p>kind of came together.</p>
<p>So you make it sound like you could have come up</p>
<p>with everything you&rsquo;re working on now decades ago,</p>
<p>but in reality.</p>
<p>Look, two things slowed me down.</p>
<p>I mean, one thing that slowed me down was</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to make it elegant.</p>
<p>And that turns out hypergraphs were the key to that.</p>
<p>And that I figured out about less than two years ago now.</p>
<p>And the other, I mean, I think,</p>
<p>so that was sort of a key thing.</p>
<p>Well, okay, so the real embarrassment of this project, okay,</p>
<p>is that the final structure that we have</p>
<p>that is the foundation for this project</p>
<p>is basically a kind of an idealized version,</p>
<p>a formalized version of the exact same structure</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve used to build computational languages</p>
<p>for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>But it took me, but I didn&rsquo;t realize that.</p>
<p>And, you know.</p>
<p>And there yet may be others.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re focused on physics now,</p>
<p>but I mean, that&rsquo;s what the new kind of science was about.</p>
<p>Same kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And this, in terms of mathematically,</p>
<p>well, the beauty of it.</p>
<p>So there could be entire other kind of objects</p>
<p>that are useful for,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re not talking about, you know,</p>
<p>machine learning, for example.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s other variants of the hypergraph</p>
<p>that are very useful for reasoning.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll see whether the multiway graph</p>
<p>or machine learning system is interesting.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s leave it at that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s conversation number three.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re not gonna go there right now, but.</p>
<p>One of the things you&rsquo;ve mentioned</p>
<p>is the space of all possible rules</p>
<p>that we kind of discussed a little bit.</p>
<p>That, you know, that could be, I guess,</p>
<p>the set of possible rules is infinite.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, so here&rsquo;s the big sort of one of the conundrums</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m kind of trying to deal with is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say we think we found the rule for the universe</p>
<p>and we say, here it is.</p>
<p>You know, write it down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little tiny thing.</p>
<p>And then we say, gosh, that&rsquo;s really weird.</p>
<p>Why did we get that one?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re in this whole situation</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s fairly simple.</p>
<p>How did we come up the winners</p>
<p>getting one of the simple possible universe rules?</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t we get what some incredibly complicated rule?</p>
<p>Why do we get one of the simpler ones?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a thing which, you know,</p>
<p>in the history of science, you know,</p>
<p>the whole sort of story of Copernicus and so on was,</p>
<p>you know, we used to think the earth</p>
<p>was the center of the universe,</p>
<p>but now we find out it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re actually just in some, you know,</p>
<p>random corner of some random galaxy</p>
<p>out in this big universe, there&rsquo;s nothing special about us.</p>
<p>So if we get, you know, universe number 317</p>
<p>out of all the infinite number of possibilities,</p>
<p>how do we get something that small and simple?</p>
<p>Right, so I was very confused by this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what are we going to say about this?</p>
<p>How are we going to explain this?</p>
<p>And I thought it was, might be one of these things</p>
<p>where you just, you know, you can get it to the threshold,</p>
<p>and then you find out its rule number, such and such,</p>
<p>and you just have no idea why it&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>Okay, so then I realized</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually more bizarre than that, okay?</p>
<p>So we talked about multiway graphs.</p>
<p>We talked about this idea that</p>
<p>you take these underlying transformation rules</p>
<p>on these hypergraphs, and you apply them</p>
<p>wherever the rule can apply, you apply it.</p>
<p>And that makes this whole multiway graph of possibilities.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s go a little bit weirder.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that at every place,</p>
<p>not only do you apply a particular rule</p>
<p>in all possible ways it can apply,</p>
<p>but you apply all possible rules</p>
<p>in all possible ways they can apply.</p>
<p>As you say, that&rsquo;s just crazy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s way too complicated.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never going to be able to conclude anything.</p>
<p>Okay, however, turns out that&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me there&rsquo;s some kind of invariance.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So what happens is&hellip;</p>
<p>And that would be amazing.</p>
<p>Right, so this thing that you get</p>
<p>is this kind of ruleal multiway graph,</p>
<p>this multiway graph that is a branching of rules</p>
<p>as well as a branching of possible applications of rules.</p>
<p>This thing has causal invariance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an inevitable feature that it shows causal invariance.</p>
<p>And that means that you can take different reference frames,</p>
<p>different ways of slicing this thing,</p>
<p>and they will all in some sense be equivalent.</p>
<p>If you make the right translation, they will be equivalent.</p>
<p>So, okay, so the basic point here is&hellip;</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s true, that would be beautiful.</p>
<p>It is true, and it is beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just an intuition, there is some&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no, no, there&rsquo;s real mathematics behind this,</p>
<p>and it is&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s where it comes in.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Right, so by the way, I mean,</p>
<p>the mathematics it&rsquo;s connected to</p>
<p>is the mathematics of higher category theory</p>
<p>and group voids and things like this,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve always been afraid of,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m finally wrapping my arms around it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also related to&hellip;</p>
<p>It also relates to computational complexity theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also deeply related to the P versus NP problem</p>
<p>and other things like this.</p>
<p>Again, it seems completely bizarre</p>
<p>that these things are connected,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s connected.</p>
<p>This space of all possible&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, so a Turing machine, very simple model of computation.</p>
<p>You know, you just got this tape</p>
<p>where you write down, you know, ones and zeros</p>
<p>or something on the tape,</p>
<p>and you have this rule that says, you know,</p>
<p>you change the number,</p>
<p>you move the head on the tape, et cetera.</p>
<p>You have a definite rule for doing that.</p>
<p>A deterministic Turing machine</p>
<p>just does that deterministically.</p>
<p>Given the configuration of the tape,</p>
<p>it will always do the same thing.</p>
<p>A non deterministic Turing machine</p>
<p>can have different choices that it makes at every step.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you know this stuff,</p>
<p>you probably teach this stuff.</p>
<p>It, you know, so a non deterministic Turing machine</p>
<p>has the set of branching possibilities,</p>
<p>which is in fact, one of these multiway graphs.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you say,</p>
<p>imagine the extremely non deterministic Turing machine,</p>
<p>the Turing machine that can just do,</p>
<p>that takes any possible rule at each step,</p>
<p>that is this real multiway graph.</p>
<p>The set of possible histories</p>
<p>of that extreme non deterministic Turing machine</p>
<p>is a Rulio multiway graph.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re, what term are you using?</p>
<p>Rulio?</p>
<p>Rulio.</p>
<p>Rulio, I like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird word.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a weird word, right?</p>
<p>Rulio multiway graph.</p>
<p>Okay, so this, so that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think of the space of rules.</p>
<p>So these are basic transformations.</p>
<p>So in a Turing machine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it says, move left, move, you know,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a one, if it&rsquo;s a black square under the head,</p>
<p>move left and right to green square.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a rule.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very basic rule,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m trying to see the rules on the hypergraphs,</p>
<p>how rich of the programs can they be?</p>
<p>Or do they all ultimately just map into something simple?</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re all, I mean, hypergraphs,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another layer of complexity on this whole thing.</p>
<p>You can think about these in transformations of hypergraphs,</p>
<p>but Turing machines are a little bit simpler.</p>
<p>You just think of it Turing machines, okay.</p>
<p>Right, they&rsquo;re a little bit simpler.</p>
<p>So if you look at these extreme</p>
<p>non deterministic Turing machines,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re mapping out all the possible non deterministic paths</p>
<p>that the Turing machine can follow.</p>
<p>And if you ask the question, can you reach, okay,</p>
<p>so a deterministic Turing machine follows a single path.</p>
<p>The non deterministic Turing machine fills out</p>
<p>this whole sort of ball of possibilities.</p>
<p>And so then the P versus MP problem</p>
<p>ends up being questions about,</p>
<p>and we haven&rsquo;t completely figured out</p>
<p>all the details of this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically has to do with questions</p>
<p>about the growth of that ball relative</p>
<p>to what happens with individual paths and so on.</p>
<p>So essentially there&rsquo;s a geometrization</p>
<p>of the P versus MP problem that comes out of this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sideshow, okay.</p>
<p>The main event here is the statement</p>
<p>that you can look at this multiway graph</p>
<p>where the branches correspond</p>
<p>not just to different applications of a single rule,</p>
<p>but to different applications of different rules, okay.</p>
<p>And that then that when you say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be an observer embedded in that system</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to try and make sense</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on in the system.</p>
<p>And to do that, I essentially am picking a reference frame</p>
<p>and that turns out to be, well, okay.</p>
<p>So the way this comes out essentially</p>
<p>is the reference frame you pick</p>
<p>is the rule that you infer is what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in the universe, even though all possible rules</p>
<p>are being run, although all those possible rules</p>
<p>are in a sense giving the same answer</p>
<p>because of causal invariance.</p>
<p>But what you see could be completely different.</p>
<p>If you pick different reference frames,</p>
<p>you essentially have a different description language</p>
<p>for describing the universe.</p>
<p>Okay, so what does this really mean in practice?</p>
<p>So imagine there&rsquo;s us.</p>
<p>We think about the universe in terms of space and time</p>
<p>and we have various kinds of description models and so on.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s imagine the friendly aliens, for example, right?</p>
<p>How do they describe their universe?</p>
<p>Well, you know, our description of the universe</p>
<p>probably is affected by the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>we are about the size we are, you know,</p>
<p>a meter ish tall, so to speak.</p>
<p>We have brain processing speeds,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re about the speeds we have.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not the size of planets, for example,</p>
<p>where the speed of light really would matter.</p>
<p>You know, in our everyday life,</p>
<p>the speed of light doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>Everything can be, you know,</p>
<p>the fact that the speed of light is finite is irrelevant.</p>
<p>It could as well be infinite.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t make any difference.</p>
<p>You know, it affects the ping times on the internet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about the level of how we notice the speed of light.</p>
<p>In our sort of everyday existence,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really notice it.</p>
<p>And so we have a way of describing the universe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s based on our sensory, you know, our senses,</p>
<p>these days also on the mathematics we&rsquo;ve constructed</p>
<p>and so on, but the realization is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the only way to do it.</p>
<p>There will be completely, utterly incoherent descriptions</p>
<p>of the universe, which correspond</p>
<p>to different reference frames in this sort of ruleal space.</p>
<p>In the ruleal space, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So we have some kind of reference frame</p>
<p>in this ruleal space, and from that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we are attributing this rule to the universe.</p>
<p>So in other words, when we say,</p>
<p>why is it this rule and not another,</p>
<p>the answer is just, you know,</p>
<p>shine the light back on us, so to speak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of the reference frame that we&rsquo;ve picked</p>
<p>in our way of understanding what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in this sort of space of all possible rules and so on.</p>
<p>But also in the space from this reference frame,</p>
<p>because of the ruleal, the invariance,</p>
<p>that simple, that the rule on which the universe,</p>
<p>with which you can run the universe,</p>
<p>might as well be simple.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, but okay, so here&rsquo;s another point.</p>
<p>So this is, again, these are a little bit mind twisting</p>
<p>in some ways, but the, okay, another thing that&rsquo;s sort of,</p>
<p>we know from computation is this idea</p>
<p>of computation universality.</p>
<p>The fact that given that we have a program</p>
<p>that runs on one kind of computer, we can as well,</p>
<p>you know, we can convert it to run</p>
<p>on any other kind of computer.</p>
<p>We can emulate one kind of computer with another.</p>
<p>So that might lead you to say, well,</p>
<p>you think you have the rule for the universe,</p>
<p>but you might as well be running it on a Turing machine</p>
<p>because we know we can emulate any computational rule</p>
<p>on any kind of machine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s essentially the same thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being said here.</p>
<p>That is that what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>these different interpretations of physics correspond</p>
<p>to essentially running physics</p>
<p>on different underlying, you know,</p>
<p>thinking about the physics as running in different</p>
<p>with different underlying rules</p>
<p>as if different underlying computers were running them.</p>
<p>And, but because of computation universality</p>
<p>or more accurately, because of this principle</p>
<p>of computational equivalence thing of mine,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that they are,</p>
<p>these things are ultimately equivalent.</p>
<p>So the only thing that is the ultimate fact</p>
<p>about the universe, the ultimate fact that doesn&rsquo;t depend</p>
<p>on any of these, you know, we don&rsquo;t have to talk</p>
<p>about specific rules, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>The ultimate fact is the universe is computational</p>
<p>and it is the things that happen in the universe</p>
<p>are the kinds of computations that the principle</p>
<p>of computational equivalence says should happen.</p>
<p>Now that might sound like you&rsquo;re not really saying</p>
<p>anything there, but you are because you can,</p>
<p>you could in principle have a hyper computer</p>
<p>that things that take an ordinary computer</p>
<p>an infinite time to do the hyper computer can just say,</p>
<p>oh, I know the answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this immediately.</p>
<p>What this is saying is the universe is not a hyper computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not simpler than a,</p>
<p>an ordinary Turing machine type computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly like an ordinary Turing machine type computer.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s in the end,</p>
<p>the sort of net net conclusion is that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that is the sort of the hard immovable fact</p>
<p>about the universe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the fundamental principle of the universe</p>
<p>is that it is computational and not hyper computational</p>
<p>and not sort of infra computational.</p>
<p>It is this level of computational ability</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, it kind of has,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s sort of the, the, the core fact, but now,</p>
<p>you know, this, this idea that you can have these different</p>
<p>kind of a rule reference frames,</p>
<p>these different description languages for the universe.</p>
<p>It makes me, you know, I used to think, okay, you know,</p>
<p>imagine the aliens,</p>
<p>imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence thing, you know,</p>
<p>at least they experienced the same physics.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;ve realized it isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>They could have a different rule frame.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>That they can end up with a, a, a,</p>
<p>a description of the universe that is utterly,</p>
<p>utterly incoherent with ours.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also interesting in terms of how we think about,</p>
<p>well, intelligence, the nature of intelligence and so on.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m fond of the quote, you know,</p>
<p>the weather has a mind of its own because these are,</p>
<p>you know, these are sort of computationally that,</p>
<p>that system is computationally equivalent to the system</p>
<p>that is our brains and so on.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s different is we don&rsquo;t have a way to understand,</p>
<p>you know, what the weather is trying to do, so to speak.</p>
<p>We have a story about what&rsquo;s happening in our brains.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a sort of connection</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s happening there.</p>
<p>So we actually, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>last time we talked maybe over a year ago,</p>
<p>we talked about how it was more based on your work</p>
<p>with Arrival.</p>
<p>We talked about how would we communicate</p>
<p>with alien intelligences.</p>
<p>Can you maybe comment on how we might,</p>
<p>how the Wolfram Physics Project changed your view,</p>
<p>how we might be able to communicate</p>
<p>with alien intelligence?</p>
<p>Like if they showed up,</p>
<p>is it possible that because of our comprehension</p>
<p>of the physics of the world might be completely different,</p>
<p>we would just not be able to communicate at all?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, you know, intelligence is everywhere.</p>
<p>The fact this idea that there&rsquo;s this notion of,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s gonna be this amazing</p>
<p>extraterrestrial intelligence</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be this unique thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>You know, I think people will realize this</p>
<p>about the time when people decide</p>
<p>that artificial intelligences are kind of</p>
<p>just natural things that are like human intelligences.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll realize that extraterrestrial intelligences</p>
<p>or intelligences associated with physical systems</p>
<p>and so on, it&rsquo;s all the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ultimately computation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all just computation.</p>
<p>And the issue is, can you, are you sort of inside it?</p>
<p>Are you thinking about it?</p>
<p>Do you have sort of a story you&rsquo;re telling yourself</p>
<p>about it?</p>
<p>And you know, the weather could have a story</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s telling itself about what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>We just, it&rsquo;s utterly incoherent with the stories</p>
<p>that we tell ourselves based on how our brains work.</p>
<p>I mean, ultimately it must be a question</p>
<p>whether we can align.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Align with the kind of intelligence.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a systematic way of doing it.</p>
<p>Right, so the question is in the space</p>
<p>of all possible intelligences,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the, how do you think about the distance</p>
<p>between description languages</p>
<p>for one intelligence versus another?</p>
<p>And needless to say, I have thought about this</p>
<p>and you know, I don&rsquo;t have a great answer yet,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s a thing</p>
<p>where there will be things that can be said</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be things that where you can sort of</p>
<p>start to characterize, you know,</p>
<p>what is the translation distance between this,</p>
<p>you know, version of the universe</p>
<p>or this kind of set of computational rules</p>
<p>and this other one.</p>
<p>In fact, okay, so this is a, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this idea of algorithmic information theory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this question of sort of what is the,</p>
<p>when you have something,</p>
<p>what is the sort of shortest description you can make of it</p>
<p>where that description could be saying,</p>
<p>run this program to get the thing, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty sure that there will be a physicalization</p>
<p>of the idea of algorithmic information</p>
<p>and that, okay, this is again, a little bit bizarre,</p>
<p>but so I mentioned that there&rsquo;s the speed of light,</p>
<p>maximum speed of information transmission in physical space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a maximum speed of information transmission</p>
<p>in branchial space, which is a maximum entanglement speed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a maximum speed of information transmission</p>
<p>in ruleal space, which is,</p>
<p>has to do with a maximum speed of translation</p>
<p>between different description languages.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not fully wrapped my brain around this one.</p>
<p>Yeah, that one just blows my mind to think about that,</p>
<p>but that starts getting closer to the, yeah,</p>
<p>the intelligence. It&rsquo;s kind of a physicalization.</p>
<p>Right, and it&rsquo;s also a physicalization</p>
<p>of algorithmic information.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s probably a connection between,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s probably a connection</p>
<p>between the notion of energy and some of these things,</p>
<p>which again, I hadn&rsquo;t seen all this coming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a little bit resistant</p>
<p>to the idea of connecting physical energy</p>
<p>to things in computation theory,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s probably coming.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what essentially at the core</p>
<p>with the physics project is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re connecting information theory with physics.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s computation.</p>
<p>Computation with our physical universe.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that our physical universe is,</p>
<p>right, that we can think of it as a computation</p>
<p>and that we can have discussions like,</p>
<p>the theory of the physical universe</p>
<p>is the same kind of a theory as the P versus MP problem</p>
<p>and so on is really, I think that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And the fact that, well, okay,</p>
<p>so this kind of brings me to one more thing</p>
<p>that I have to in terms of this sort of unification</p>
<p>of different ideas, which is metamathematics.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s talk about that.</p>
<p>You mentioned that earlier.</p>
<p>What the heck is metamathematics and&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s what, okay.</p>
<p>So what is mathematics?</p>
<p>Mathematics, sort of at a lowest level,</p>
<p>one thinks of mathematics as you have certain axioms.</p>
<p>You say things like X plus Y is the same as Y plus X.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an axiom about addition.</p>
<p>And then you say, we&rsquo;ve got these axioms</p>
<p>and from these axioms, we derive all these theorems</p>
<p>that fill up the literature of mathematics.</p>
<p>The activity of mathematicians</p>
<p>is to derive all these theorems.</p>
<p>Actually, the axioms of mathematics are very small.</p>
<p>You can fit, when I did my new kind of science book,</p>
<p>I fit all of the standard axioms of mathematics</p>
<p>on basically a page and a half.</p>
<p>Not much stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a very simple rule</p>
<p>from which all of mathematics arises.</p>
<p>The way it works though is a little different</p>
<p>from the way things work in sort of a computation</p>
<p>because in mathematics, what you&rsquo;re interested in</p>
<p>is a proof and the proof says,</p>
<p>from here, you can use, from this expression, for example,</p>
<p>you can use these axioms to get to this other expression.</p>
<p>So that proves these two things are equal.</p>
<p>Okay, so we can begin to see how this has been going to work.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gonna happen is there are paths</p>
<p>in metamathematical space.</p>
<p>So what happens is each, two different ways to look at it.</p>
<p>You can just look at it as mathematical expressions</p>
<p>or you can look at it as mathematical statements,</p>
<p>postulates or something.</p>
<p>But either way, you think of these things</p>
<p>and they are connected by these axioms.</p>
<p>So in other words, you have some fact</p>
<p>or you have some expression, you apply this axiom,</p>
<p>you get some other expression.</p>
<p>And in general, given some expression,</p>
<p>there may be many possible different expressions</p>
<p>you can get.</p>
<p>You basically build up a multiway graph</p>
<p>and a proof is a path through the multiway graph</p>
<p>that goes from one thing to another thing.</p>
<p>The path tells you how did you get from one thing</p>
<p>to the other thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the story of how you got from this to that.</p>
<p>The theorem is the thing at one end</p>
<p>is equal to the thing at the other end.</p>
<p>The proof is the path you go down</p>
<p>to get from one thing to the other.</p>
<p>You mentioned that G√∂del&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem</p>
<p>fits naturally there.</p>
<p>How does it fit?</p>
<p>Yeah, so what happens there is that the G√∂del&rsquo;s theorem</p>
<p>is basically saying that there are paths of infinite length.</p>
<p>That is that there&rsquo;s no upper bound.</p>
<p>If you know these two things,</p>
<p>you say, I&rsquo;m trying to get from here to here,</p>
<p>how long do I have to go?</p>
<p>You say, well, I&rsquo;ve looked at all the paths of length 10.</p>
<p>Somebody says, that&rsquo;s not good enough.</p>
<p>That path might be of length a billion.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no upper bound on how long that path is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what leads to the incompleteness theorem.</p>
<p>So I mean, the thing that is kind of an emerging idea</p>
<p>is you can start asking,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the analog of Einstein&rsquo;s equations</p>
<p>in metamathematical space?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the analog of a black hole</p>
<p>in metamathematical space?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hope of this?</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating to model all the mathematics</p>
<p>in this way.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>This is mathematics in bulk.</p>
<p>So human mathematicians have made a few million theorems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve published a few million theorems.</p>
<p>But imagine the infinite future of mathematics.</p>
<p>Apply something to mathematics</p>
<p>that mathematics likes to apply to other things.</p>
<p>Take a limit.</p>
<p>What is the limit of the infinite future of mathematics?</p>
<p>What does it look like?</p>
<p>What is the continuum limit of mathematics?</p>
<p>What is the, as you just fill in</p>
<p>more and more and more theorems,</p>
<p>what does it look like?</p>
<p>What does it do?</p>
<p>How does, what kinds of conclusions can you make?</p>
<p>So for example, one thing I&rsquo;ve just been doing</p>
<p>is taking Euclid.</p>
<p>So Euclid, very impressive.</p>
<p>He had 10 axioms, he derived 465 theorems, okay?</p>
<p>His book, you know,</p>
<p>that was the sort of defining book of mathematics</p>
<p>for 2000 years.</p>
<p>So you can actually map out,</p>
<p>and I actually did this 20 years ago,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve done it more seriously now.</p>
<p>You can map out the theorem dependency</p>
<p>of those 465 theorems.</p>
<p>So from the axioms, you grow this graph,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a multiway graph,</p>
<p>of how all these theorems get proved from other theorems.</p>
<p>And so you can ask questions about, you know,</p>
<p>well, you can ask things like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the hardest theorem in Euclid?</p>
<p>The answer is, the hardest theorem</p>
<p>is that there are five platonic solids.</p>
<p>That turns out to be the hardest theorem in Euclid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually his last theorem in all his books.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the final.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hardness, the distance you have to travel?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s 33 steps from the,</p>
<p>the longest path in the graph is 33 steps.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the, there&rsquo;s a 33 step path you have to follow</p>
<p>to go from the axioms, according to Euclid&rsquo;s proofs,</p>
<p>to the statement there are five platonic solids.</p>
<p>So, okay, so then the question is,</p>
<p>in, what does it mean if you have this map?</p>
<p>Okay, so in a sense, this metamathematical space</p>
<p>is the infrastructural space of all possible theorems</p>
<p>that you could prove in mathematics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the geometry of metamathematics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the geography of mathematics.</p>
<p>That is, where did people choose to live in space?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what, for example,</p>
<p>exploring the sort of empirical metamathematics</p>
<p>that Euclid is doing.</p>
<p>You could put each individual, like, human mathematician,</p>
<p>you can embed them into that space.</p>
<p>I mean, they kind of live.</p>
<p>They represent a path in the space.</p>
<p>The little path.</p>
<p>The things they do.</p>
<p>Maybe a set of paths.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So like a set of axioms that are chosen.</p>
<p>Right, so for example,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an example of a thing that I realized.</p>
<p>So one of the surprising things about,</p>
<p>well, there are two surprising facts about math.</p>
<p>One is that it&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>and the other is that it&rsquo;s doable, okay?</p>
<p>So first question is, why is math hard?</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve got these axioms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very small.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you just solve every problem in math easily?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just logic.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, logic happens to be a particular special case</p>
<p>that does have certain simplicity to it.</p>
<p>But general mathematics, even arithmetic,</p>
<p>already doesn&rsquo;t have the simplicity that logic has.</p>
<p>So why is it hard?</p>
<p>Because of computational irreducibility.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because what happens is, to know what&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>and this is this whole story about the path</p>
<p>you have to follow and how long is the path,</p>
<p>and G√∂del&rsquo;s theorem is the statement</p>
<p>that the path is not a bounded length,</p>
<p>but the fact that the path is not always compressible</p>
<p>to something tiny is a story of computational irreducibility.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why math is hard.</p>
<p>Now, the next question is, why is math doable?</p>
<p>Because it might be the case that most things you care about</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have finite length paths.</p>
<p>Most things you care about might be things</p>
<p>where you get lost in the sea of computational irreducibility</p>
<p>and worse, undecidability.</p>
<p>That is, there&rsquo;s just no finite length path</p>
<p>that gets you there.</p>
<p>Why is mathematics doable?</p>
<p>G√∂del proved his incompleteness theorem in 1931.</p>
<p>Most working mathematicians don&rsquo;t really care about it.</p>
<p>They just go ahead and do mathematics,</p>
<p>even though it could be that the questions they&rsquo;re asking</p>
<p>are undecidable.</p>
<p>It could have been that Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem</p>
<p>is undecidable.</p>
<p>It turned out it had a proof.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long, complicated proof.</p>
<p>The twin prime conjecture might be undecidable.</p>
<p>The Riemann hypothesis might be undecidable.</p>
<p>These things might be, the axioms of mathematics</p>
<p>might not be strong enough to reach those statements.</p>
<p>It might be the case that depending on what axioms</p>
<p>you choose, you can either say that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>And by the way, from Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem,</p>
<p>there could be a shorter path.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the notion of geodesics in metamathematical space</p>
<p>is the notion of shortest proofs in metamathematical space.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a, you know, human mathematicians</p>
<p>do not find shortest paths,</p>
<p>nor do automated theorem provers.</p>
<p>But the fact, and by the way, the, I mean,</p>
<p>this stuff is so bizarrely connected.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re into automated theorem proving,</p>
<p>there are these so called critical pair lemmas</p>
<p>and automated theorem proving.</p>
<p>Those are precisely the branch pairs in our,</p>
<p>that in multiway graphs.</p>
<p>Let me just finish on the why mathematics is doable.</p>
<p>Oh yes, the second part.</p>
<p>So you know why it&rsquo;s hard, why is it doable?</p>
<p>Right, why do we not just get lost</p>
<p>in undecidability all the time?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, and here&rsquo;s another fact,</p>
<p>is in doing computer experiments</p>
<p>and doing experimental mathematics,</p>
<p>you do get lost in that way.</p>
<p>When you just say, I&rsquo;m picking a random integer equation.</p>
<p>How do I, does it have a solution or not?</p>
<p>And you just pick it at random</p>
<p>without any human sort of path getting there.</p>
<p>Often, it&rsquo;s really, really hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to answer those questions.</p>
<p>We just pick them at random from the space of possibilities.</p>
<p>But what I think is happening is,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a case where you just fell off</p>
<p>into this ocean of sort of irreducibility and so on.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening is human mathematics</p>
<p>is a story of building a path.</p>
<p>You started off, you&rsquo;re always building out</p>
<p>on this path where you are proving things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this proof trajectory</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re basically, the human mathematics</p>
<p>is the sort of the exploration of the world</p>
<p>along this proof trajectory, so to speak.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just parachuting in from anywhere.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re following Lewis and Clark or whatever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually going, doing the path.</p>
<p>And the fact that you are constrained to go along that path</p>
<p>is the reason you don&rsquo;t end up with,</p>
<p>every so often you&rsquo;ll see a little piece of undecidability</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll avoid that part of the path.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s basically the story of why human mathematics</p>
<p>has seemed to be doable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a story of exploring these paths</p>
<p>that are by their nature,</p>
<p>they have been constructed to be paths that can be followed.</p>
<p>And so you can follow them further.</p>
<p>Now, why is this relevant to anything?</p>
<p>So, okay, so here&rsquo;s my belief.</p>
<p>The fact that human mathematics works that way</p>
<p>is I think there&rsquo;s some sort of connections</p>
<p>between the way that observers work in physics</p>
<p>and the way that the axiom systems of mathematics are set up</p>
<p>to make mathematics be doable in that kind of way.</p>
<p>And so, in other words, in particular,</p>
<p>I think there is an analog of causal invariance,</p>
<p>which I think is, and this is again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of the upper reaches of mathematics</p>
<p>and stuff that it&rsquo;s a thing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this thing called homotopy type theory,</p>
<p>which is an abstract, it&rsquo;s came out of category theory,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sort of an abstraction of mathematics.</p>
<p>Mathematics itself is an abstraction,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an abstraction of the abstraction of mathematics.</p>
<p>And there is the thing called the univalence axiom,</p>
<p>which is a sort of a key axiom in that set of ideas.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m pretty sure the univalence axiom</p>
<p>is equivalent to causal invariance.</p>
<p>What was the term you used again?</p>
<p>Univalence.</p>
<p>Is that something for somebody like me accessible?</p>
<p>Or is this?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a statement of it that&rsquo;s fairly accessible.</p>
<p>I mean, the statement of it is,</p>
<p>basically it says things which are equivalent</p>
<p>can be considered to be identical.</p>
<p>In which space?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s in higher category.</p>
<p>In category.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s a, but I mean,</p>
<p>the thing just to give a sketch of how that works.</p>
<p>So category theory is an attempt to idealize,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an attempt to sort of have a formal theory</p>
<p>of mathematics that is at a sort of higher level</p>
<p>than mathematics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where you just think about these mathematical objects</p>
<p>and these categories of objects and these morphisms,</p>
<p>these connections between categories.</p>
<p>Okay, so it turns out the morphisms and categories,</p>
<p>at least weak categories,</p>
<p>are very much like the paths in our hypergraphs and things.</p>
<p>And it turns out, again, this is where it all gets crazy.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that these things are connected</p>
<p>is just bizarre.</p>
<p>So category theory, our causal graphs</p>
<p>are like second order category theory.</p>
<p>And it turns out you can take the limits</p>
<p>of infinite order category theory.</p>
<p>So just give roughly the idea.</p>
<p>This is a roughly explainable idea.</p>
<p>So a mathematical proof will be a path</p>
<p>that says you can get from this thing to this other thing.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the path that you get from this thing</p>
<p>to this other thing.</p>
<p>But in general, there may be many paths,</p>
<p>many proofs that get you many different paths</p>
<p>that all successfully go from this thing</p>
<p>to this other thing, okay?</p>
<p>Now you can define a higher order proof,</p>
<p>which is a proof of the equivalence of those proofs.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>A path between those proofs essentially.</p>
<p>Yes, a path between the paths, okay?</p>
<p>And so you do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sort of second order thing.</p>
<p>That path between the paths is essentially related</p>
<p>to our causal graphs.</p>
<p>Then you can take the limit.</p>
<p>Wow, okay.</p>
<p>The path between path, between path, between path.</p>
<p>The infinite limit.</p>
<p>That infinite limit turns out to be</p>
<p>our Rulial Multiway System.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Rulial Multiway System,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fascinating, both in the physics world</p>
<p>and as you&rsquo;re saying now, that&rsquo;s fast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve loaded it in completely, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not sure I have either.</p>
<p>And it may be one of these things where,</p>
<p>in another five years or something, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it was obvious, but I didn&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>No, but the thing which is sort of interesting to me</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s sort of an upper reach of mathematics,</p>
<p>of the abstraction of mathematics.</p>
<p>This thing, there&rsquo;s this mathematician called Grothendieck</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s generally viewed as being sort of one</p>
<p>of the most abstract,</p>
<p>sort of creator of the most abstract mathematics</p>
<p>of 1970s ish timeframe.</p>
<p>And one of the things that he constructed was this thing</p>
<p>he called the Infinity Grupoid.</p>
<p>And he has this sort of hypothesis</p>
<p>about the inevitable appearance of geometry</p>
<p>from essentially logic in the structure of this thing.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out this Rulial Multiway System</p>
<p>is the Infinity Grupoid.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this limiting object.</p>
<p>And this is an instance of that limiting object.</p>
<p>So what to me is, I mean, again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been always afraid of this kind of mathematics</p>
<p>because it seemed incomprehensibly abstract to me.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m sort of excited about with this</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ve sort of concretified the way</p>
<p>that you can reach this kind of mathematics,</p>
<p>which makes it, well, both seem more relevant</p>
<p>and also the fact that I don&rsquo;t yet know exactly</p>
<p>what mileage we&rsquo;re gonna get from using</p>
<p>the sort of the apparatus that&rsquo;s been built</p>
<p>in those areas of mathematics to analyze what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But the thing that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So both ways.</p>
<p>So using mathematics to understand what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and using what you&rsquo;re doing computationally</p>
<p>to understand that.</p>
<p>Right, so for example,</p>
<p>the understanding of metamathematical space,</p>
<p>one of the reasons I really want to do that</p>
<p>is because I want to understand quantum mechanics better.</p>
<p>And that, what you see,</p>
<p>we live that kind of the multiway graph of mathematics</p>
<p>because we actually know this is a theorem we&rsquo;ve heard of.</p>
<p>This is another one we&rsquo;ve heard of.</p>
<p>We can actually say these are actual things in the world</p>
<p>that we relate to,</p>
<p>which we can&rsquo;t really do as readily for the physics case.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of a way to help my intuition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, there are bizarre things</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s the analog of Einstein&rsquo;s equations</p>
<p>in metamathematical space?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the analog of a black hole?</p>
<p>It turns out it looks like not completely sure yet,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this notion of nonconstructive proofs</p>
<p>in mathematics.</p>
<p>And I think those relate to,</p>
<p>well, actually they relate to things</p>
<p>related to event horizons.</p>
<p>So the fact that you can take ideas from physics</p>
<p>like event horizons.</p>
<p>And map them into the same kind of space, metamath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really.</p>
<p>So do you think there&rsquo;ll be,</p>
<p>do you think you might stumble upon</p>
<p>some breakthrough ideas in theorem proving?</p>
<p>Like for, from the other direction?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I mean, what&rsquo;s really nice is that we are using,</p>
<p>so this absolutely directly maps to theorem proving.</p>
<p>So pods and multiway graphs,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what a theorem prover is trying to do.</p>
<p>But I also mean like automated theorem.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, right.</p>
<p>So the finding of pods, the finding of shortest pods</p>
<p>or finding of pods at all</p>
<p>is what automated theorem provers do.</p>
<p>And actually what we&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve actually been using automated theorem proving</p>
<p>both in the physics project to prove things</p>
<p>and using that as a way to understand multiway graphs.</p>
<p>And because what an automated theorem prover is doing</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s trying to find a path through a multiway graph</p>
<p>and its critical pair lemmas</p>
<p>are precisely little stubs of branch pairs</p>
<p>going off into branchial space.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s really weird.</p>
<p>You know, we have these visualizations in Wolfram language</p>
<p>of proof graphs from our automated theorem proving system.</p>
<p>And they look reminiscent of.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just bizarre</p>
<p>because we made these up a few years ago</p>
<p>and they have these little triangle things</p>
<p>and they are, we didn&rsquo;t quite get it right.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t quite get the analogy perfectly right,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very close.</p>
<p>You know, just to say,</p>
<p>in terms of how these things are connected.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s another bizarre connection</p>
<p>that I have to mention because which is,</p>
<p>which again, we don&rsquo;t fully know,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a connection to something else</p>
<p>you might not have thought was in the slightest</p>
<p>but connected, which is distributed blockchain like things.</p>
<p>Now you might figure out that that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you would figure out that that&rsquo;s connected</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a story of distributed computing.</p>
<p>And the issue, you know, with the blockchain,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s going to be this one ledger</p>
<p>that globally says, this is what happened in the world.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a bad deal.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got all these different transactions</p>
<p>that are happening and you know,</p>
<p>this transaction in country A</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be reconciled with the transaction</p>
<p>in country B, at least not for a while.</p>
<p>And that story is just like what happens</p>
<p>with our causal graphs.</p>
<p>That whole reconciliation thing is just like</p>
<p>what happens with light cones and all this kind of thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the causal awareness comes into play.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>most of your conversations are about physics,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of funny that this probably</p>
<p>and possibly might have even bigger impact</p>
<p>and revolutionary ideas and totally other disciplines.</p>
<p>Right, well, you see, yeah, right.</p>
<p>So the question is, why is that happening, right?</p>
<p>And the reason it&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about this obviously,</p>
<p>because I like to think about these meta questions of,</p>
<p>you know, what&rsquo;s happening is this model that we have</p>
<p>is an incredibly minimal model.</p>
<p>And once you have an incredibly minimal model,</p>
<p>and this happened with cellular automata as well,</p>
<p>cellular automata are an incredibly minimal model.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s inevitable that it gets you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of an upstream thing</p>
<p>that gets used in lots of different places.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you know, the fact that it gets used,</p>
<p>you know, cellular automata is sort of a minimal model</p>
<p>of let&rsquo;s say road traffic flow or something.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also a minimal model of something in,</p>
<p>you know, chemistry,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re also a minimal model of something</p>
<p>in epidemiology, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re such a simple model that they can,</p>
<p>that they apply to all these different things.</p>
<p>Similarly, this model that we have with the physics project</p>
<p>is another, cellular automata are a minimal model</p>
<p>of parallel, of basically of parallel computation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve defined space and time.</p>
<p>These models are minimal models</p>
<p>where you have not defined space and time.</p>
<p>And they have been very hard to understand in the past,</p>
<p>but the, I think the,</p>
<p>perhaps the most important breakthrough there</p>
<p>is the realization that these are models of physics.</p>
<p>And therefore that you can use everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been developed in physics</p>
<p>to get intuition about how things like that work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you can potentially use ideas from physics</p>
<p>to get intuition about how to do parallel computing.</p>
<p>And because the underlying model is the same.</p>
<p>But we have all of this achievement in physics.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, you might say,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;ve come up with the fundamental theory of physics</p>
<p>that throws out what people have done in physics before.</p>
<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t, but also the real power</p>
<p>is to use what&rsquo;s been done before in physics</p>
<p>to apply it in these other places.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>This kind of brings up,</p>
<p>I know you probably don&rsquo;t particularly love commenting</p>
<p>on the work of others,</p>
<p>but let me bring up a couple of personalities</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s fun and people are curious about it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s Sabine Hassenfelder.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with her.</p>
<p>She wrote this book that I need to read,</p>
<p>but I forget what the title is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s Beauty Leads Us Astray in Physics</p>
<p>is a subtitle or something like that.</p>
<p>Which so much about what we&rsquo;re talking about now,</p>
<p>like this simplification,</p>
<p>to us humans seems to be beautiful.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a certain intuition with physicists,</p>
<p>with people that a simple theory,</p>
<p>like this reducibility,</p>
<p>pockets of reducibility is the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>And I think what she tries to argue is no,</p>
<p>we just need to come up with theories</p>
<p>that are just really good at predicting physical phenomena.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to have a bunch of disparate theories</p>
<p>as opposed to trying to chase this beautiful theory</p>
<p>of everything is the ultimate beautiful theory,</p>
<p>a simple one.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your response to that?</p>
<p>Well, so what you&rsquo;re quoting,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the Sabine Hassenfelder&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>exactly what she said,</p>
<p>but I mean that you&rsquo;re quoting the title of her book.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me respond to what you were describing,</p>
<p>which may or may not have nothing to do with</p>
<p>what Sabine Hassenfelder says or thinks.</p>
<p>Sorry, Sabine.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Sorry for misquoting.</p>
<p>But I mean, the question is,</p>
<p>is beauty a guide to whether something is correct?</p>
<p>Which is kind of also the story of Occam&rsquo;s razor.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of different explanations of things,</p>
<p>is the thing that is the simplest explanation</p>
<p>likely to be the correct explanation?</p>
<p>And there are situations where that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>and there are situations where it isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Sometimes in human systems, it is true</p>
<p>because people have kind of,</p>
<p>in evolutionary systems, sometimes it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s sort of been kicked</p>
<p>to the point where it&rsquo;s minimized.</p>
<p>But in physics, does Occam&rsquo;s razor work?</p>
<p>Is there a simple, quotes, beautiful explanation for things</p>
<p>or is it a big mess?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t intrinsically know.</p>
<p>I think that the, I wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>before I worked on the project in recent times,</p>
<p>I would have said,</p>
<p>we do not know how complicated</p>
<p>the rule for the universe will be.</p>
<p>And I would have said, the one thing we know,</p>
<p>which is a fundamental fact about science,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing that makes science possible,</p>
<p>is that there is order in the universe.</p>
<p>I mean, early theologians would have used that</p>
<p>as an argument for the existence of God</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, why is there order in the universe?</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t every single particle in the universe</p>
<p>just do its own thing?</p>
<p>Something must be making there be order in the universe.</p>
<p>We, in the sort of early theology point of view,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the role of God is to do that, so to speak.</p>
<p>In our, we might say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the role of a formal theory to do that.</p>
<p>And then the question is,</p>
<p>but how simple should that theory be?</p>
<p>And should that theory be one that,</p>
<p>where I think the point is, if it&rsquo;s simple,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost inevitably somewhat beautiful</p>
<p>in the sense that, because all the stuff that we see</p>
<p>has to fit into this little tiny theory.</p>
<p>And the way it does that has to be,</p>
<p>it depends on your notion of beauty,</p>
<p>but I mean, for me, the sort of the surprising</p>
<p>connectivity of it is, at least in my aesthetic,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that responds to my aesthetic.</p>
<p>But the question is, I mean,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a fascinating person in the sense that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at once talking about computational,</p>
<p>the fundamental computational reducibility of the universe,</p>
<p>and on the other hand,</p>
<p>trying to come up with a theory of everything,</p>
<p>which simply describes the,</p>
<p>the simple origins of that computational reducibility.</p>
<p>I mean, both of those things are kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s paralyzing to think that we can&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>of the universe in the general case,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hopeful to think like,</p>
<p>one, we can think of a rule</p>
<p>and that generates this whole complexity,</p>
<p>and two, we can find pockets of reducibility</p>
<p>that are powerful for everyday life</p>
<p>to do different kinds of predictions.</p>
<p>I suppose Sabine wants to find,</p>
<p>focus on the finding of small pockets of reducibility</p>
<p>versus the theory of everything.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a funny thing because,</p>
<p>you know, a bunch of people have started working</p>
<p>on this physics project,</p>
<p>people who are physicists, basically,</p>
<p>and it is really a fascinating sociological phenomenon</p>
<p>because what, you know,</p>
<p>when I was working on this before in the 1990s,</p>
<p>you know, wrote it up, put it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 100 pages of this 1200 page book</p>
<p>that I wrote, New Kind of Science,</p>
<p>is, you know, 100 pages of that is about physics,</p>
<p>but I saw it at that time,</p>
<p>not as a pinnacle achievement,</p>
<p>but rather as a use case, so to speak.</p>
<p>I mean, my main point was this new kind of science,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, you can apply it to biology,</p>
<p>you can apply it to, you know, other kinds of physics,</p>
<p>you can apply it to fundamental physics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just an application, so to speak,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the core thing.</p>
<p>But then, you know, one of the things that was interesting</p>
<p>with that book was, you know,</p>
<p>book comes out, lots of people think it&rsquo;s pretty interesting</p>
<p>and lots of people start using what it has</p>
<p>in different kinds of fields.</p>
<p>The one field where there was sort of a heavy pitchforking</p>
<p>was from my friends, the fundamental physics people,</p>
<p>which was, it&rsquo;s like, no,</p>
<p>this can&rsquo;t possibly be right.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>if what you&rsquo;re doing is right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll overturn 50 years of what we&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, it won&rsquo;t, was what I was saying.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, but, you know, for a while,</p>
<p>when I started, you know, I was going to go on back in 2002,</p>
<p>well, 2004, actually, I was going to go on</p>
<p>working on this project.</p>
<p>And I actually stopped,</p>
<p>partly because it&rsquo;s like, why am I, you know,</p>
<p>this is like, I&rsquo;ve been in business a long time, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m building a product for a target market</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t want the product.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Why work, yeah, yeah, why work against the,</p>
<p>swim against the current or whatever.</p>
<p>Right, but you see what&rsquo;s happened,</p>
<p>which is sort of interesting is that,</p>
<p>so a couple of things happened and it was like,</p>
<p>you know, it was like, I don&rsquo;t want to do this project</p>
<p>because I can do so many other things,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m really interested in where, you know,</p>
<p>people say, great, thanks for those tools.</p>
<p>Thanks for those ideas, et cetera.</p>
<p>Whereas, you know, if you&rsquo;re dealing with kind of a,</p>
<p>you know, a sort of a structure where people are saying,</p>
<p>no, no, we don&rsquo;t want this new stuff.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need any new stuff.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really fine with what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s like literally like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>millions of people who are thankful for Wolfram Alpha.</p>
<p>A bunch of people wrote to me, how thankful,</p>
<p>they are a different crowd</p>
<p>than the theoretical physics community, perhaps.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, but you know,</p>
<p>the theoretical physics community</p>
<p>pretty much uniformly uses Wolfram language</p>
<p>and Mathematica, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know, and that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but the thing is what happens, you know,</p>
<p>this is what happens, mature fields do not, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re doing what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>We have the methods that we have</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just fine here.</p>
<p>Now what&rsquo;s happened in the last 18 years or so,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a couple of things have happened.</p>
<p>First of all, the hope that, you know,</p>
<p>string theory or whatever would deliver</p>
<p>the fundamental theory of physics,</p>
<p>that hope has disappeared.</p>
<p>That the, another thing that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>is the sort of the interest in computation around physics</p>
<p>has been greatly enhanced</p>
<p>by the whole quantum information,</p>
<p>quantum computing story.</p>
<p>People, you know, the idea there might be something</p>
<p>sort of computational related to physics</p>
<p>has somehow grown.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, it&rsquo;s sort of interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, right now, if we say, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, if you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>who else is trying to come up</p>
<p>with the fundamental theory of physics?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there aren&rsquo;t professional,</p>
<p>no professional physicists, no professional physicists.</p>
<p>What are your, I mean, you&rsquo;ve talked with him,</p>
<p>but just as a matter of personalities,</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s a beautiful story.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Eric Weinstein&rsquo;s work?</p>
<p>You know, I think his, I mean,</p>
<p>he did a PhD thesis in mathematical physics at Harvard.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a mathematical physicist.</p>
<p>And, you know, it seems like it&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s in that framework.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how much further it&rsquo;s got than his PhD thesis,</p>
<p>which was 20 years ago or something.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, the, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fairly specific piece of mathematical physics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite nice.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>What trajectory do you hope it takes?</p>
<p>I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I think in his particular case,</p>
<p>I mean, from what I understand,</p>
<p>which is not everything at all,</p>
<p>but, you know, I think I know the rough tradition,</p>
<p>at least what he&rsquo;s operating in is sort of theory of gauge theories.</p>
<p>Gauge theories, yeah.</p>
<p>Local gauge invariants and so on.</p>
<p>Okay, we are very close to understanding</p>
<p>how local gauge invariants works in our models.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very beautiful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very&hellip;</p>
<p>And, you know, does some of the mathematical structure</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s enthusiastic about fit?</p>
<p>Quite possibly, yes.</p>
<p>So there might be a possibility of trying to understand</p>
<p>how those things fit, how gauge theory fits.</p>
<p>Yeah, very well.</p>
<p>I mean, the question is, you know,</p>
<p>so there are a couple of things</p>
<p>one might try to get in the world.</p>
<p>So for example, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>can we get three dimensions of space?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t managed to get that yet.</p>
<p>Gauge theory, the standard model of particle physics says,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s SU3 cross SU2 cross U1.</p>
<p>Those are the designations of these Lie groups.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, but anyway,</p>
<p>so those are sort of representations</p>
<p>of symmetries of the theory.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it is conceivable</p>
<p>that it is generically true.</p>
<p>Okay, so all those are subgroups of a group called E8,</p>
<p>which is a weird, exceptional Lie group, okay?</p>
<p>It is conceivable, I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>that that will be generic in these models,</p>
<p>that it will be generic,</p>
<p>that the gauge invariance of the model has this property,</p>
<p>just as things like general relativity,</p>
<p>which corresponds to the thing called general covariance,</p>
<p>which is another gauge like invariance.</p>
<p>It could conceivably be the case</p>
<p>that the kind of local gauge invariance</p>
<p>that we see in particle physics is somehow generic.</p>
<p>And that would be a, you know,</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s really cool, I think, you know,</p>
<p>sociologically, although this hasn&rsquo;t really hit yet,</p>
<p>is that all of these different things,</p>
<p>all these different things people have been working on</p>
<p>in these, in some cases,</p>
<p>quite abstruse areas of mathematical physics,</p>
<p>an awful lot of them seem to tie into what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And, you know, it might not be that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful thing, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, but the reason Eric Weinstein is important</p>
<p>is to the point that you mentioned before,</p>
<p>which is, it&rsquo;s strange that the theory of everything</p>
<p>is not at the core of the passion, the dream,</p>
<p>the focus, the funding of the physics community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too hard and people gave up.</p>
<p>I mean, basically what happened is ancient Greece,</p>
<p>people thought we&rsquo;re nearly there.</p>
<p>You know, the world is made of platonic solids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, water is a tetrahedron or something.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost there, okay?</p>
<p>Long period of time where people were like,</p>
<p>no, we don&rsquo;t know how it works.</p>
<p>You know, time of Newton, you know, we&rsquo;re almost there.</p>
<p>Everything is gravitation.</p>
<p>You know, time of Faraday and Maxwell, we&rsquo;re almost there.</p>
<p>Everything is fields, everything is the ether, you know?</p>
<p>Then&hellip;</p>
<p>And the whole time we&rsquo;re making big progress though.</p>
<p>Oh yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>But the fundamental theory of physics is almost a footnote</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the machine code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re operating in the high level languages.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s what we really care about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s relevant for our everyday physics.</p>
<p>You talked about different centuries</p>
<p>and the 21st century will be everything is computation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If that takes us all the way, we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but it might take us pretty far.</p>
<p>Yes, right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I, but I think the point is that it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing biology, you might say,</p>
<p>how can you not be really interested in the origin of life</p>
<p>and the definition of life?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s irrelevant.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re studying the properties of some virus.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter, you know, where, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re operating at some much higher level.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same, what&rsquo;s happening with physics is,</p>
<p>I was sort of surprised actually.</p>
<p>I was sort of mapping out this history of people&rsquo;s efforts</p>
<p>to understand the fundamental theory of physics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s remarkable how little has been done on this question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know, because, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been times when there&rsquo;s been bursts of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re almost there.</p>
<p>And then it decays and people just say,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s too hard, but it&rsquo;s not relevant anyway.</p>
<p>And I think that the thing that, you know,</p>
<p>so the question of, you know, one question is,</p>
<p>why does anybody, why should anybody care, right?</p>
<p>Why should anybody care</p>
<p>what the fundamental theory of physics is?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s intellectually interesting,</p>
<p>but what will be the sort of,</p>
<p>what will be the impact of this?</p>
<p>What, I mean, this is the key question.</p>
<p>What do you think will happen</p>
<p>if we figure out the fundamental theory of physics?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Outside of the intellectual curiosity of us.</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s my best guess, okay?</p>
<p>So if you look at the history of science,</p>
<p>I think a very interesting analogy is Copernicus.</p>
<p>Okay, so what did Copernicus do?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d been this Ptolemaic system</p>
<p>for working out the motion of planets.</p>
<p>It did pretty well.</p>
<p>It used epicycles, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>It had all this computational ways</p>
<p>of working out where planets will be.</p>
<p>When we work out where planets are today,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re basically using epicycles.</p>
<p>But Copernicus had this different way of formulating things</p>
<p>in which he said, you know,</p>
<p>and the earth is going around the sun,</p>
<p>and that had a consequence.</p>
<p>The consequence was you can use this mathematical theory</p>
<p>to conclude something which is absolutely not</p>
<p>what we can tell from common sense, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, trust the mathematics, trust the science, okay?</p>
<p>Now fast forward 400 years,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re in this pandemic,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of like everybody thinks the science</p>
<p>will figure out everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like from the science,</p>
<p>we can just figure out what to do.</p>
<p>We can figure out everything.</p>
<p>That was before Copernicus.</p>
<p>Nobody would have thought if the science says something</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t agree with our everyday experience,</p>
<p>where we just have to compute the science</p>
<p>and then figure out what to do,</p>
<p>people would say that&rsquo;s completely crazy.</p>
<p>And so your sense is,</p>
<p>once we figure out the framework of computation</p>
<p>that can basically do any,</p>
<p>understand the fabric of reality,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be able to derive totally counterintuitive things.</p>
<p>No, the point I think is the following.</p>
<p>That right now, you know,</p>
<p>I talk about computational irreducibility.</p>
<p>People, you know, I was very proud</p>
<p>that I managed to get the term computational irreducibility</p>
<p>into the congressional record last year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, by the way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole nother topic we could talk about.</p>
<p>Fascinating. Different topic.</p>
<p>Different topic.</p>
<p>But Tim, in any case, you know,</p>
<p>but so computational irreducibility</p>
<p>is one of these sort of concepts</p>
<p>that I think is important in understanding</p>
<p>lots of things in the world.</p>
<p>But the question is, it&rsquo;s only important</p>
<p>if you believe the world is fundamentally computational.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But if you know the fundamental theory of physics</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fundamentally computational,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve rooted the whole thing.</p>
<p>That is, you know the world is computational.</p>
<p>And while you can discuss whether, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the case that people would say,</p>
<p>well, you have this whole computational irreducibility,</p>
<p>all these features of computation.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t care about those</p>
<p>because after all the world isn&rsquo;t computational,</p>
<p>you might say.</p>
<p>But if you know, you know, base, base, base thing,</p>
<p>physics is computational,</p>
<p>then you know that that stuff is, you know,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s kind of the grounding for that stuff.</p>
<p>Just as in a sense Copernicus was the grounding</p>
<p>for the idea that you could figure out something</p>
<p>with math and science</p>
<p>that was not what you would intuitively think</p>
<p>from your senses.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;ve got to this point where, for example,</p>
<p>we say, you know, once we have the idea</p>
<p>that computation is the foundational thing</p>
<p>that explains our whole universe,</p>
<p>then we have to say, well, what does it mean</p>
<p>for other things?</p>
<p>Like it means there&rsquo;s computational irreducibility.</p>
<p>That means science is limited in certain ways.</p>
<p>That means this, that means that.</p>
<p>But the fact that we have that grounding means that,</p>
<p>you know, and I think, for example, for Copernicus,</p>
<p>for instance, the implications of his work</p>
<p>on the set of mathematics of astronomy were cool,</p>
<p>but they involved a very small number of people.</p>
<p>The implications of his work for sort of the philosophy</p>
<p>of how you think about things were vast</p>
<p>and involved, you know, everybody more or less.</p>
<p>But do you think, so that&rsquo;s actually the way scientists</p>
<p>and people see the world around us.</p>
<p>So it has a huge impact in that sense.</p>
<p>Do you think it might have an impact more directly</p>
<p>to engineering derivations from physics,</p>
<p>like propulsion systems, our ability to colonize the world?</p>
<p>Like, for example, okay, this is like sci fi,</p>
<p>but if you understand the computational nature, say,</p>
<p>of the different forces of physics, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a notion of being able to warp gravity,</p>
<p>things like this.</p>
<p>Yeah, can we make warp drive?</p>
<p>Warp drive, yeah.</p>
<p>So like, would we be able to, will, you know,</p>
<p>will like Elon Musk start paying attention?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s awfully costly to launch these rockets.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll be able to, yeah, create warp drive?</p>
<p>And, you know, I set myself some homework.</p>
<p>I agreed to give a talk at some NASA workshop</p>
<p>in a few weeks about faster than light travel.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet, but no, but.</p>
<p>You got two weeks.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>But do you think that kind of understanding</p>
<p>of fundamental theory of physics can lead</p>
<p>to those engineering breakthroughs?</p>
<p>Okay, I think it&rsquo;s far away, but I&rsquo;m not certain.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, this is the thing that,</p>
<p>I set myself an exercise when gravity waves,</p>
<p>gravitational waves were discovered, right?</p>
<p>I set myself the exercise of what would black hole</p>
<p>technology look like?</p>
<p>In other words, right now, you know,</p>
<p>black holes are far away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, you know, how on earth can we do things with them?</p>
<p>But just imagine that we could get, you know,</p>
<p>pet black holes right in our backyard.</p>
<p>You know, what kind of technology could we build with them?</p>
<p>I got a certain distance, not that far,</p>
<p>but I think in, you know, so there are ideas, you know,</p>
<p>I have this, one of the weirder ideas is things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling space tunnels,</p>
<p>which are higher dimensional pieces of space time,</p>
<p>where basically you can, you know,</p>
<p>in our three dimensional space,</p>
<p>there might be a five dimensional, you know,</p>
<p>region, which actually will appear as a white hole</p>
<p>at one end and a black hole at the other end,</p>
<p>you know, who knows whether they exist.</p>
<p>And then the questions, another one,</p>
<p>okay, this is another crazy one,</p>
<p>is the thing that I&rsquo;m calling a vacuum cleaner, okay?</p>
<p>So, I mentioned that, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all this activity in the universe,</p>
<p>which is maintaining the structure of space.</p>
<p>And that leads to a certain energy density</p>
<p>effectively in space.</p>
<p>And so the question, in fact, dark energy</p>
<p>is a story of essentially negative mass</p>
<p>produced by the absence of energy</p>
<p>you thought would be there, so to speak.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know exactly how it works</p>
<p>in either our model or the physical universe,</p>
<p>but this notion of a vacuum cleaner is a thing where,</p>
<p>you know, you have all these things</p>
<p>that are maintaining the structure of space,</p>
<p>but what if you could clean out some of that stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s maintaining the structure of space</p>
<p>and make a simpler vacuum somewhere?</p>
<p>You know, what would that do?</p>
<p>A totally different kind of vacuum.</p>
<p>Right, and that would lead to negative energy density,</p>
<p>which would need to, so gravity is usually</p>
<p>a purely attractive force, but negative mass</p>
<p>would lead to repulsive gravity</p>
<p>and lead to all kinds of weird things.</p>
<p>Now, can it be done in our universe?</p>
<p>You know, my immediate thought is no,</p>
<p>but you know, the fact is that, okay, so here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Well, once you understand the fact,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re saying like, at this level of abstraction,</p>
<p>can we reach to the lower levels and mess with it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Once you understand the levels, I think you can start to.</p>
<p>I know, and I&rsquo;m, you know, I have to say</p>
<p>that this reminds me of people telling one years ago</p>
<p>that, you know, you&rsquo;ll never transmit data</p>
<p>over a copper wire at more than 1,000,</p>
<p>you know, 1,000 board or something, right?</p>
<p>And this is, why did that not happen?</p>
<p>You know, why do we have this much,</p>
<p>much faster data transmission?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve understood many more of the details</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s actually going on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same exact story here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same, you know, I think that this,</p>
<p>as I say, I think one of the features of sort of,</p>
<p>one of the things about our time</p>
<p>that will seem incredibly naive in the future</p>
<p>is the belief that, you know, things like heat</p>
<p>is just random motion of molecules,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just throw up your hands, it&rsquo;s just random.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t say anything about it.</p>
<p>That will seem naive.</p>
<p>Yeah, at the heat death of the universe,</p>
<p>those particles would be laughing at us humans thinking.</p>
<p>Yes, right.</p>
<p>That life is not beautiful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have a whole civilization, you know.</p>
<p>Humans used to think they&rsquo;re special</p>
<p>with their little brains.</p>
<p>Well, right, but also, and they used to think</p>
<p>that this would just be random and uninteresting.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, but so this question about whether you can,</p>
<p>you know, mess with the underlying structure</p>
<p>and how you find a way to mess with the underlying structure,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a, you know, I have to say, you know,</p>
<p>my immediate thing is, boy, that seems really hard,</p>
<p>but then, and you know,</p>
<p>possibly computational irreducibility will bite you,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s always some path</p>
<p>of computational reducibility.</p>
<p>And that path of computational reducibility</p>
<p>is the engineering invention that has to be made.</p>
<p>Those little pockets can have huge engineering impact.</p>
<p>Right, and I think that that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I mean, we live in, you know, we make use of so many</p>
<p>of those pockets.</p>
<p>And the fact is, you know, I, you know, this is, yes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a, you know, it&rsquo;s one of these things where,</p>
<p>where, you know, I&rsquo;m a person who likes to figure out ideas</p>
<p>and so on, and the sort of tests of my level of imagination,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>And so a couple of places where there&rsquo;s sort of serious</p>
<p>humility in terms of my level of imagination,</p>
<p>one is this thing about different reference frames</p>
<p>for understanding the universe,</p>
<p>where like, imagine the physics of the aliens,</p>
<p>what will it be like?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you know?</p>
<p>And I mean, I think that&hellip;</p>
<p>But once you have the framework in place,</p>
<p>you can at least reason about the things you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe can&rsquo;t know, or like, it&rsquo;s too hard for you to know,</p>
<p>but then the mathematics can, that&rsquo;s exactly it,</p>
<p>allow you to reach beyond where you can reason about.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m, you know, I&rsquo;m trying to not have, you know,</p>
<p>if you think back to Alan Turing, for example,</p>
<p>and, you know, when he invented Turing machines, you know,</p>
<p>and imagining what computers would end up doing,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, and it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult, right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, and I mean, this thing&hellip;</p>
<p>Made a few reasonable predictions,</p>
<p>but most of it, he couldn&rsquo;t predict, possibly.</p>
<p>By the time, by 1950, he was making reasonable predictions</p>
<p>about some things.</p>
<p>But not the 30s, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, not when he first, you know, conceptualized,</p>
<p>you know, and he conceptualized universal computing</p>
<p>for a very specific mathematical reason</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t as general.</p>
<p>But yes, it&rsquo;s a good sort of exercise in humility</p>
<p>to realize that it&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to figure these things out.</p>
<p>The engineering of the universe,</p>
<p>if we know how the universe works, how can we engineer it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a beautiful vision.</p>
<p>By the way, I have to mention one more thing,</p>
<p>which is the ultimate question from physics is,</p>
<p>okay, so we have this abstract model of the universe.</p>
<p>Why does the universe exist at all, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, we might say there is a formal model</p>
<p>that if you run this model, you get the universe,</p>
<p>or the model gives you, you know, a model of the universe,</p>
<p>right, you run this mathematical thing</p>
<p>and the mathematics unfolds in the way</p>
<p>that corresponds to the universe.</p>
<p>But the question is, why was that actualized?</p>
<p>Why does the actual universe actually exist?</p>
<p>And so this is another one of these humility</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, can you figure this out?</p>
<p>I have a guess, okay, about the answer to that.</p>
<p>And my guess is somewhat unsatisfying,</p>
<p>but my guess is that it&rsquo;s a little bit similar</p>
<p>to G√∂del&rsquo;s second incompleteness theorem,</p>
<p>which is the statement that from within,</p>
<p>as an axiomatic theory like piano arithmetic,</p>
<p>you cannot from within that theory</p>
<p>prove the consistency of the theory.</p>
<p>So my guess is that for entities within the universe,</p>
<p>there is no finite determination that can be made</p>
<p>of the statement the universe exists</p>
<p>is essentially undecidable to any entity</p>
<p>that is embedded in the universe.</p>
<p>Within that universe, how does that make you feel?</p>
<p>Does that put you at peace that it&rsquo;s impossible,</p>
<p>or is it really ultimately frustrating?</p>
<p>Well, I think it just says that it&rsquo;s not a kind of question</p>
<p>that, you know, there are things that it is reasonable.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s kinds of, you know,</p>
<p>you can talk about hyper computation as well.</p>
<p>You can say, imagine there was a hyper computer,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what it would do.</p>
<p>So okay, great, it would be lovely to have a hyper computer,</p>
<p>but unfortunately we can&rsquo;t make it in the universe.</p>
<p>Like it would be lovely to answer this,</p>
<p>but unfortunately we can&rsquo;t do it in the universe.</p>
<p>And you know, this is all we have, so to speak.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s really just a statement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of, in the end, it&rsquo;ll be a kind of a logical,</p>
<p>logically inevitable statement, I think.</p>
<p>I think it will be something where it is,</p>
<p>as you understand what it means to have,</p>
<p>what it means to have a sort of predicate of existence</p>
<p>and what it means to have these kinds of things,</p>
<p>it will sort of be inevitable that this has to be the case,</p>
<p>that from within that universe, you can&rsquo;t establish</p>
<p>the reason for its existence, so to speak.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t prove that it exists and so on.</p>
<p>And nevertheless, because of computational reducibility,</p>
<p>the future is ultimately not predictable, full of mystery,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what makes life worth living.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, right.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s funny for me,</p>
<p>because as a pure sort of human being doing what I do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, like I&rsquo;m interested in people,</p>
<p>I like sort of the whole human experience, so to speak.</p>
<p>And yet, it&rsquo;s a little bit weird when I&rsquo;m thinking,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s all hypergraphs down there,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all just.</p>
<p>Hypergraphs all the way down.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like turtles all the way down.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of, you know, to me, it is a funny thing,</p>
<p>because every so often I get this, you know,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m thinking about, I think we&rsquo;ve really gotten,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ve really figured out kind of the essence</p>
<p>of how physics works, and I&rsquo;m like thinking to myself,</p>
<p>you know, here&rsquo;s this physical thing,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, you know,</p>
<p>this feels like a very definite thing.</p>
<p>How can it be the case that this is just</p>
<p>some rule or reference frame of, you know,</p>
<p>this infinite creature that is so abstract and so on?</p>
<p>And I kind of, it is a, it&rsquo;s a funny sort of feeling</p>
<p>that, you know, we are, we&rsquo;re sort of, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>in the end, it&rsquo;s just sort of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just happy we&rsquo;re just humans type thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like, but we&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>we make things as, it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re just a tiny speck.</p>
<p>We are, in a sense, the, we are more important</p>
<p>by virtue of the fact that, in a sense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s, there is no ultimate, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re important because,</p>
<p>because, you know, we&rsquo;re here, so to speak,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s a thing</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re saying, you know, we are just but one</p>
<p>sort of intelligence out of all these other intelligences.</p>
<p>And so, you know, ultimately there&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>the super intelligence, which is all of these put together</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be very different from us.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s actually going to be equivalent to us.</p>
<p>And the thing that makes us a sort of special</p>
<p>is just the details of us, so to speak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something where we can say,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s this other thing, you know,</p>
<p>just, you think humans are cool,</p>
<p>just wait until you&rsquo;ve seen this.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s going to be much more impressive.</p>
<p>Well, no, it&rsquo;s all going to be</p>
<p>kind of computationally equivalent.</p>
<p>And the thing that, you know, it&rsquo;s not going to be,</p>
<p>oh, this thing is amazingly much more impressive</p>
<p>and amazingly much more meaningful, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re it.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the&hellip;</p>
<p>And the symbolism of this particular moment.</p>
<p>So this has been one of the,</p>
<p>one of the favorite conversations I&rsquo;ve ever had, Stephen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor to talk to you,</p>
<p>to talk about a topic like this for four plus hours</p>
<p>on the fundamental theory of physics.</p>
<p>And yet we&rsquo;re just two finite descendants of apes</p>
<p>that have to end this conversation</p>
<p>because darkness have come upon us.</p>
<p>Right, and we&rsquo;re going to get bitten by mosquitoes</p>
<p>and all kinds of terrible things.</p>
<p>The symbolism of that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the most basic fabric of reality</p>
<p>and having to end because of the fact that things end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tragic and beautiful, Stephen.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Huge honor.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do in the next couple of days</p>
<p>and next week, a month.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all watching with excitement.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
