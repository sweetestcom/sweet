    <p>Hey, everybody, welcome to another all in podcast.</p>
<p>This is an all bestie, no guestie episode of all in.</p>
<p>The last time you heard from the besties, it was election night</p>
<p>and it was a shit show, a fucking crazy shit show.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>I mean, we if we go back and look at that historical document,</p>
<p>we had moments where we thought Trump was going to absolutely crush.</p>
<p>Then we had moments of confusion.</p>
<p>And now here we are.</p>
<p>And I think we have to give a couple of bestie kudos to first off Chamath</p>
<p>pointing out Pennsylvania was going to be big.</p>
<p>And then second, when we went through the possible scenarios of who</p>
<p>what what could possibly happen, a big giant blue wave,</p>
<p>Trump winning it all, and then maybe something in the middle</p>
<p>option three came through.</p>
<p>And that was Saksipu nailed it.</p>
<p>I think that was your assumption, Sax.</p>
<p>The soft landing, the soft landing. Yeah.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we just for the people who didn&rsquo;t tune in live?</p>
<p>Sorry, Jason, can I ask a question?</p>
<p>Saksipu, Saksipu, was that your</p>
<p>like projection or was it from that</p>
<p>from that guy who lives in his dad&rsquo;s basement, his mom&rsquo;s basement?</p>
<p>My my researcher.</p>
<p>Well, Newman, Newman works for me.</p>
<p>Newman, Newman.</p>
<p>Yeah. Newman, Newman and I worked together on on those takes.</p>
<p>But yeah, the take that we thought was was possible, but probably unlikely,</p>
<p>but could represent a really good scenario was the soft landing</p>
<p>where you get a split decision.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what the American people voted for.</p>
<p>You know, you had the Democratic frame on the election</p>
<p>was that we needed a return to normalcy and decency.</p>
<p>The Republican frame was that the radical left cannot be trusted with power.</p>
<p>And voters basically said they were both right.</p>
<p>They sort of surgically removed Donald Trump while thwarting</p>
<p>the radical left&rsquo;s dream of total control in Washington.</p>
<p>And what the electorate seems to be saying is they want the parties</p>
<p>now to work together instead of voting for extreme ideology.</p>
<p>But TBD, Sax, I mean, Georgia is still up for grabs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to go after it hard, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they filed in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think there&rsquo;s a series of court challenges we can talk about.</p>
<p>I think that they&rsquo;re unlikely to prevail.</p>
<p>Very, very unlikely.</p>
<p>I think Joe Biden will be the next president.</p>
<p>We can kind of compare this to, you know, Bush v.</p>
<p>Gore from 2000.</p>
<p>And if you you want to compare Trump&rsquo;s case to Gore&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weaker in every respect.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, with Bush v.</p>
<p>Gore, Gore only had to overturn one state, which was Florida,</p>
<p>whereas Trump has to now contest and overturn three or four states</p>
<p>simultaneously. Second, you know, Gore was within a few hundred votes of Bush.</p>
<p>It was extremely close.</p>
<p>Trump is no closer than about 12000 votes in Georgia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the closest one.</p>
<p>Third, you know, Gore</p>
<p>or Bush never trailed Gore in any in any recount.</p>
<p>And and Trump has that problem that he&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s very far behind Gore as well.</p>
<p>So you look at those three things and you&rsquo;d say, you know, Gore couldn&rsquo;t overcome it.</p>
<p>And he had a closer situation than this.</p>
<p>And of course, I&rsquo;d say finally, you know, W had the velvet</p>
<p>hammer, James Baker, working for him, whereas Trump frankly has Rudy Giuliani,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s throwing press conferences in the parking lot of forces and landscaping</p>
<p>between a dildo shop and a crematorium.</p>
<p>And I mean, you can&rsquo;t make this stuff up.</p>
<p>I think somebody was tweeting, you know, it&rsquo;s this is perfect</p>
<p>because, you know, they were saying they wanted Rudy to fuck off and die.</p>
<p>So it was so appropriate</p>
<p>that this press conference was held between a dildo shop and a crematorium.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s not exactly the A team</p>
<p>that Trump&rsquo;s got playing for him here in the courts.</p>
<p>But I mean, David Bossie, by the way, David Bossie, who is in charge of the whole</p>
<p>thing, David Bossie is not even a lawyer.</p>
<p>And then he gets covid.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s on the sidelines.</p>
<p>I mean, just there&rsquo;s so many angles we can take here,</p>
<p>including the fact that am I correct that?</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s campaign adviser got covid</p>
<p>like the day after or no, no, no.</p>
<p>Mark Meadows, Chief of Staff, Chief of Staff got it.</p>
<p>But David Bossie, who&rsquo;s in charge of this whole recount process, got covid as well.</p>
<p>OK, so I want to just shift us now to what could have so many things</p>
<p>went right for the Democrats.</p>
<p>But there was also something very clear here that happened, which is the</p>
<p>what I call the HSP, the Hysterical Socialist Party of America,</p>
<p>I think was dealt a death blow.</p>
<p>If you look, this was very close.</p>
<p>And so, you know, even if we want to talk about the Electoral College,</p>
<p>et cetera, these are still very low numbers.</p>
<p>I believe if the Pfizer news comes out last week,</p>
<p>Trump wins or if any combination</p>
<p>of AOC Biden, AOC, Bernie or Warren</p>
<p>were in any way involved in this election process</p>
<p>and weren&rsquo;t pushed to the side, the squad was squashed</p>
<p>because we knew that if they got any kind of play.</p>
<p>Trump sails into victory.</p>
<p>So when we look at what happens going forward</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll let any one of the three of you take this,</p>
<p>what does this say about the Hysterical Socialist Party,</p>
<p>the HSP, the squad, the Bernie bros?</p>
<p>What does this say about them?</p>
<p>Well, you have a you have a look, you have a you have a loud group</p>
<p>of people on both sides.</p>
<p>And the reality is that both extremes of both parties</p>
<p>actually after this election have very little to stand on that&rsquo;s unique,</p>
<p>because if you think about what the plurality of Americans want</p>
<p>is actually just a common, decent, centrist, do no harm alternative.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to pick that more times</p>
<p>than they&rsquo;re not going to pick it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when things get extreme, like in 2016,</p>
<p>in order to send a message, will they do it?</p>
<p>And until it&rsquo;s resolved, they tried to do it again now.</p>
<p>So we should actually talk about that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that this was, you know, a runaway.</p>
<p>It was way too close on too many dimensions that actually matter</p>
<p>for the future prosperity of America.</p>
<p>But that being said, what does it mean for the future?</p>
<p>I think the future is like a Pete Buttigieg must be high fiving,</p>
<p>you know, the people in his camp right now, because a common,</p>
<p>decent, thoughtful, centrist platform will win.</p>
<p>For example, like let&rsquo;s just say you believe in gay rights.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be at the fringes to believe in that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mainstream.</p>
<p>You believe in like a reasonable form of health care.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mainstream.</p>
<p>If you believe in climate change, it&rsquo;s mainstream.</p>
<p>You start to go and tick off the things that the extremes</p>
<p>would want to believe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little room for them to stand on.</p>
<p>So one party is going to be basically about like a federalized</p>
<p>nanny state, and the other party will be a bunch of conspiracy</p>
<p>theorist crazies.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s going to force more and more people to the middle.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the future.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a much safer place to be than I think</p>
<p>where we could have been if, you know, Trump had won or if</p>
<p>the extreme left had basically been been validated with</p>
<p>a candidate that won.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I would add to that, that the proof of that, the proof</p>
<p>of the electorate&rsquo;s desire to attack towards the center as</p>
<p>you look at the down ballot election.</p>
<p>So, you know, in the Senate, the Republicans are still holding</p>
<p>on to a majority pending the Florida runoff, but the Democrats</p>
<p>failed to take out Susan Collins, Tom Tillis, Steve Daines.</p>
<p>These were three incumbent Republicans who are way behind</p>
<p>in the polls heading into election day.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t come close to taking out Lindsey Graham or Mitch</p>
<p>McConnell, despite spending a million dollars.</p>
<p>Get out of this one alive.</p>
<p>Explain that.</p>
<p>Susan Collins.</p>
<p>No, Lady G.</p>
<p>Lindsey Graham.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>You know, Lindsey Graham, they said that it was neck and</p>
<p>neck, and he actually ended up winning that state by like</p>
<p>14 points.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t close.</p>
<p>The polls were wildly off.</p>
<p>And you saw that across the board in the House to Democrats</p>
<p>expected a gain of 10 to 15 seats.</p>
<p>Instead, they&rsquo;ve lost about 10 seats.</p>
<p>They failed to defeat a single GOP incumbent.</p>
<p>The GOP House members ran about two or three points ahead</p>
<p>of President Trump, and then the Democrats were completely</p>
<p>shut out in Texas, which was supposed to be going purple.</p>
<p>There were eight open GOP seats.</p>
<p>Democrats won none of them.</p>
<p>So anyway, I&rsquo;m providing some support to the idea that this</p>
<p>was a split decision election.</p>
<p>The voters voted to remove both of the or voted against</p>
<p>the extremes of both parties.</p>
<p>So, Friedberg, when you look at this, you see, I think,</p>
<p>an absolute just people don&rsquo;t want to deal with Trump anymore.</p>
<p>How much of this do you think is Trump derangement system</p>
<p>syndrome and what got Trump into office, eventually taking</p>
<p>him out, which is the guy just takes up too much oxygen</p>
<p>in the room.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s coming from me.</p>
<p>And the guy is just incredibly annoying to have to deal</p>
<p>with day to day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also coming from you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also coming from me.</p>
<p>Friedberg, what do you think?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve been at a rave for four years, and everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming down from the Mali.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not going to go to a Marilyn Manson concert right</p>
<p>after being at a rave.</p>
<p>You want to go sit in the parking lot, and you just want</p>
<p>to chill out a little bit.</p>
<p>And we all just want to have a beer and relax.</p>
<p>You know, like, I mean, I think I need some five HTP and</p>
<p>a banana.</p>
<p>You want to go sit in the 7-Eleven parking lot at four in</p>
<p>the morning, and you want to, like, go get a fucking sweet</p>
<p>cappuccino and smoke a cigarette and relax.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s been too much.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s like, everyone&rsquo;s just kind of ready to chill</p>
<p>out a bit.</p>
<p>And so this whole fucking swinging back to the concert across</p>
<p>the road sounds just as bad as what we&rsquo;ve just been through.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just, you know, let&rsquo;s just live our lives a little</p>
<p>bit. And we&rsquo;ll come back in four years and figure out how</p>
<p>to fuck things up again.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of the psyche.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think voters want a presidency they can forget about.</p>
<p>You know, I think Trump&rsquo;s sort of Achilles heel as he demanded</p>
<p>too much of the voters constant time and attention.</p>
<p>There was, like, this psychic cost to it.</p>
<p>It obviously antagonized the other side and drove turnout</p>
<p>for the Democrats.</p>
<p>But it seems like voters are saying, look, just leave us</p>
<p>alone. We want to just forget about what&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>Washington for four years.</p>
<p>And now they can, because pending the Georgia runoff, it</p>
<p>looks like Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden will have to be in</p>
<p>a power sharing arrangement, and nothing gets done unless</p>
<p>the two of them agree.</p>
<p>And by the way, just on that, there was a great tweet by</p>
<p>Paul Graham.</p>
<p>He said the day after the election, something to the effect</p>
<p>of it feels like some background process in my computer</p>
<p>had was just killed that was consuming 5% of my CPU.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>Mac operating system spinning wheel of death.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s David is so right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s been this omnipresent thing in all</p>
<p>of our lives over the last four years.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just exhausting.</p>
<p>And, you know, there wasn&rsquo;t that much value that came from</p>
<p>paying so much attention and worrying so much.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just a great opportunity to come off the</p>
<p>sugar high and reset ourselves and take a nap.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very astute point, Chamath, in that what</p>
<p>was gained from this Trump derangement from this Trump</p>
<p>sucking all of the attention and constantly tweeting.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think the big win here, Freeberg is, if you</p>
<p>look, the proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p>Trump, we find out on Saturday morning that Trump is, you</p>
<p>know, has lost and Biden has won.</p>
<p>And 48 hours later, we find out Pfizer has 90% efficacy</p>
<p>on their vaccine.</p>
<p>Obviously, these two things are highly correlated.</p>
<p>Biden has already delivered the vaccine in just 48 hours.</p>
<p>And then today we got the rapid testing has been approved</p>
<p>by the FDA.</p>
<p>I mean, look at this.</p>
<p>But if at this rate, Biden is going to cure global warming</p>
<p>by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Look, first off, I think it&rsquo;s a little it is pretty</p>
<p>paradoxical that the vaccine news came 48 hours.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s paradoxical.</p>
<p>I mean, that was crazy.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s supposed to be an October surprise, not a</p>
<p>November surprise.</p>
<p>I think if Trump has any legitimate argument about being</p>
<p>done dirty in this election, it is over this vaccine news,</p>
<p>because, you know, the Chinese announced it three hours after</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s declared president.</p>
<p>Pfizer announces it a day after Biden&rsquo;s declared president.</p>
<p>I mean, when Trump went around the was campaigning, saying</p>
<p>a vaccine was mere weeks away, everyone thought that was</p>
<p>bullshit.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, he was telling the truth.</p>
<p>And if those guys had announced it, Jason, like you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>two weeks before the election, it might have changed this</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>But you guys might have 100% and this is not something he can</p>
<p>go to the courts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he can go to the courts and get the election</p>
<p>recounted overturned because of this.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s legally actionable.</p>
<p>But I do think that on this news alone, Trump in four years</p>
<p>will be able to claim on some level that this was a stolen</p>
<p>election.</p>
<p>But couldn&rsquo;t the same be said about Hillary&rsquo;s email server,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So like 100% news came out like, oh, and it was like timed</p>
<p>around the election.</p>
<p>And I do think that there was a concerted effort to not let</p>
<p>you know, the progress with COVID get in the way of the</p>
<p>election in any way, you know, biased it either way.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s like pretty reasonable and fair to say,</p>
<p>like, let&rsquo;s just not make this part of the news cycle leading</p>
<p>into the election.</p>
<p>And this was expected, like, if you guys go back a couple of</p>
<p>podcasts, like you had a prediction on when we would have</p>
<p>a vaccine, I think I predicted end of September, because of</p>
<p>the way that they set up the production cycle in parallel</p>
<p>with the testing cycle, and the way that they were fast</p>
<p>tracking a lot of the testing in a way that wasn&rsquo;t normal</p>
<p>for this sort of development.</p>
<p>And it was it was going to happen this fall.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m an executive at one of these companies, I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>my vaccine to become a politicized event, right?</p>
<p>Like, I just want to be like, I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the reasonable</p>
<p>thing to say, like, let&rsquo;s just put it on hold.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s deal with it all after the election.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still moving forward.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not holding anything up in terms of production and getting</p>
<p>this thing across the finish line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the announcement of where we are.</p>
<p>So why make that part of the new cycle, you know, and I think</p>
<p>like people learned their lesson with Hillary&rsquo;s server last</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this one news, you know, bombshell drops in the</p>
<p>news cycle spins up and she loses the election.</p>
<p>Everyone blames her losing the election for that coming out.</p>
<p>No one wants to be culpable for that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Pfizer exec.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to make fucking medicine.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t want to be on the hook for said another way.</p>
<p>Someone winning or losing an election said another way.</p>
<p>Chamath.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to go to a Warriors finals game versus the Lakers</p>
<p>and have the refs called, you know, decide the game in the</p>
<p>final couple of minutes.</p>
<p>So do you think Chamath this is if you were running Pfizer, if</p>
<p>you were on the board of Pfizer and you have this information</p>
<p>and you know, it can come out in this two week window at any</p>
<p>time, what decision would you make Chamath?</p>
<p>Well, just imagine that the vaccine was 90% ineffective,</p>
<p>and it was announced two weeks before the election.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have an entire cohort of people saying this was meant to</p>
<p>basically sabotage the election and the other direction.</p>
<p>So the point is, it&rsquo;s a no win situation.</p>
<p>The only answer is to wait until after the election, because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only way that you can actually say, you know, we</p>
<p>were not we were being impartial.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sympathetic to this idea that all the news had to wait</p>
<p>two or three days, or maybe it was two or three weeks.</p>
<p>Now, knowing in advance what the answer was, obviously, you</p>
<p>can read into that.</p>
<p>But I think even if it was 90% ineffective, it should have</p>
<p>waited till after the election as well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get the sense that you do agree with that.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>I mean, we know from our time working in large companies that</p>
<p>it takes them weeks to even approve a press release.</p>
<p>And so Pfizer had this news weeks ago.</p>
<p>Now, I understand their reason for not wanting to appear to be</p>
<p>influencing the outcome of the election.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why they held on to it.</p>
<p>I think everybody saw the way that Facebook was scapegoated</p>
<p>four years ago for the election, and no one wants to no</p>
<p>corporation wants to put themselves in that position of</p>
<p>being accused of affecting the election outcome one way or</p>
<p>another. I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s why they did it as opposed to a</p>
<p>conspiracy against Trump.</p>
<p>But this news was available.</p>
<p>I think we will find out weeks ago.</p>
<p>And so I guess you&rsquo;d have to blame or there&rsquo;d be some</p>
<p>culpability on the part of Trump&rsquo;s election team or his</p>
<p>head of the FDA or what have you.</p>
<p>They must have known some of this information, and you would</p>
<p>think they would have done a better job getting it out there.</p>
<p>No, he did say it every rally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just around the corner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just around the corner.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re around in the corner, and we all thought it was bullshit.</p>
<p>You thought it was bullshit.</p>
<p>We thought it was bullshit, right?</p>
<p>And you know why we thought it was bullshit?</p>
<p>Well, because Trump Trump does have a tendency towards</p>
<p>hyperbole, hyperbole on Trump&rsquo;s most honest day.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s hyperbolic.</p>
<p>On Trump&rsquo;s average day, he is lying incessantly.</p>
<p>So if anything, if he was right, and he was right that we were</p>
<p>turning the corner and the vaccine was coming, and it was</p>
<p>going to be beautiful, beautiful, perfect vaccine, and everybody</p>
<p>was going to get it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s paying the price for being a liar for four years.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the kind of thing.</p>
<p>Boy who cried wolf.</p>
<p>Well, and so does the media, by the way, but but yeah, look,</p>
<p>in order for a piece of news this big to be believed before</p>
<p>the election, it can&rsquo;t come from a candidate.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty amazing that none of this news</p>
<p>got out there through some other source, you would think that</p>
<p>some of the people on the health care task force that Trump</p>
<p>appointed might have been, you know, surfacing this or paying</p>
<p>attention to it.</p>
<p>Maybe Pfizer did a really good job of hiding it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it is pretty amazing that didn&rsquo;t come out sooner.</p>
<p>Well, the other crazy thing is like, you know, even the Pfizer</p>
<p>team didn&rsquo;t exactly know what was going on.</p>
<p>The chief, the head of vaccine research, she said, we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>part of the federal government&rsquo;s, you know, warp speed</p>
<p>program.</p>
<p>And then two days later, Pfizer was like, actually, we are part</p>
<p>of the warp speed program.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that, you know, we&rsquo;re a supplier.</p>
<p>The whole point is that I&rsquo;m not sure that Pfizer actually</p>
<p>knew two weeks in advance, David, I think that they were</p>
<p>probably trickling stuff together, and they probably had</p>
<p>a sense of it at the end of the last week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised it didn&rsquo;t leak.</p>
<p>To be quite honest, that&rsquo;s the more shocking thing, which</p>
<p>means that it was probably something that very, very, very</p>
<p>few people knew about.</p>
<p>Well, the CEO, the CEO put out a statement saying that he would</p>
<p>be first in line to take the new vaccine, which I thought was,</p>
<p>you know, a great statement, because a lot of people were</p>
<p>questioning whether you know how real it was, or how rushed</p>
<p>it was.</p>
<p>But in order for him to do that, and in order just to get like a</p>
<p>press release announced, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the kind of thing</p>
<p>that comes together in the, you know, one or two day period</p>
<p>between the announcement of Joe Biden winning the election and</p>
<p>their and their announcement.</p>
<p>So, you know, I just think they had to know weeks ago.</p>
<p>I just want to say to my Greek brother, Alberto Borlas, the CEO</p>
<p>of Pfizer, a great Greek, who has led to the saving of the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>Oopah.</p>
<p>Saganaki is on me.</p>
<p>If you if you if you take 90% efficacy, and you assume at most</p>
<p>in the United States, 40% of people will take the actual</p>
<p>vaccination, you&rsquo;ll have 36% of the population covered, which is</p>
<p>still not enough to get the are not less than one.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Freeberg?</p>
<p>What do you know?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an epidemiologist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to.</p>
<p>What I mean, does it sound directionally correct to you</p>
<p>that people in the States are going to take it?</p>
<p>I think I think you don&rsquo;t take it.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this like,</p>
<p>everyone who&rsquo;s high risk will take it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And as of about two months ago, you know, it was estimated that</p>
<p>30% of people on the East Coast had already developed immunity</p>
<p>due to the seroprevalence studies that showed antibodies.</p>
<p>On the West Coast, it was much lower, closer to 3%.</p>
<p>You can estimate based on the growth in cases since then, and</p>
<p>assuming we&rsquo;re kind of missing a bunch, we&rsquo;re probably on a</p>
<p>national basis, we&rsquo;re at 10% back then, on a national basis,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably up to 20% right now of Americans have already</p>
<p>been effectively immunized by getting the virus.</p>
<p>So, you know, if that&rsquo;s true, then you&rsquo;re at 55%.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re getting pretty close to a, you know, an ability to</p>
<p>kind of inhibit this thing from, from spreading rapidly again.</p>
<p>So how do we each feel?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just go around the horn.</p>
<p>How do we each feel about the COVID-19 endgame?</p>
<p>When will we see all schools open, all NBA arenas open with</p>
<p>no distancing, give us a quarter in 2021, when in America,</p>
<p>enough vaccines will have been delivered and distributed and</p>
<p>rapid testing, that life goes back to, let&rsquo;s call it 85% of</p>
<p>normal.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think you ever get there.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, we talked about this a couple episodes</p>
<p>ago, but it&rsquo;s after 911, you know, the TSA emerged, and</p>
<p>American travel never went back to the way it was before.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;ll be a lot about the way we live that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be, you know, kind of permanently scarred and</p>
<p>permanently changed here for a while, whether it is taking</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s temperatures at football games, wearing masks,</p>
<p>and, you know, farmers markets, who knows, it&rsquo;s going to be all</p>
<p>these weird rules are going to pop up, they&rsquo;re going to last</p>
<p>for years, regardless of how much immunization takes place,</p>
<p>regardless of how cheap and available testing is, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have this scar for a long time, in terms of how we</p>
<p>live as a society.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should kid ourselves that we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>go back to quote, unquote, normal.</p>
<p>And I do think kids are going to get tested and schools are</p>
<p>going to be like, this friggin, you know, almost like TSAs now,</p>
<p>you know, kids are going to go into school and get tested</p>
<p>regularly, and they&rsquo;re going to do all sorts of stuff that we</p>
<p>would have never dreamed imaginable in a free country a</p>
<p>year ago.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s permanent.</p>
<p>I think, you know, we&rsquo;re going to, you&rsquo;re already seeing</p>
<p>people going nuts at bars and restaurants, and people that</p>
<p>have had it are out there partying and living their life</p>
<p>again. So there&rsquo;s certainly don&rsquo;t you think if you get the</p>
<p>vaccine, you&rsquo;re just going to be like YOLO? I&rsquo;ve had enough of</p>
<p>this? Yeah, but I don&rsquo;t think that that systems are going to</p>
<p>change back to normal. I think systems have changed to the</p>
<p>point that we&rsquo;ve now got a way of living that we think is</p>
<p>safer that we think is we are now kind of inhibited because of</p>
<p>the system.</p>
<p>You agree? Yeah, there&rsquo;ll be a lot fewer. It&rsquo;s what Dave</p>
<p>Chappelle said on Saturday, there&rsquo;ll be a lot fewer mass</p>
<p>shootings. The pandemic has done a great job of keeping the</p>
<p>whites at home.</p>
<p>We watched it. All you besties watched it together. All you</p>
<p>all you guys got on your mass shooting rampages. You know, the</p>
<p>whites are at home. They&rsquo;re frustrated, but they&rsquo;re at home.</p>
<p>Thank God. So I think there&rsquo;ll be some advantages.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, but let&rsquo;s talk about it. Chamath does does 2021</p>
<p>mean kids go back to school? I think 2021 September, no</p>
<p>problem. No, I think free burgers, right? I think that the</p>
<p>best we&rsquo;ll get back to is sort of this 80% state and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it happens until probably 2022. And maybe 2023. But</p>
<p>probably 2022. Because you have to remember, like, we have to</p>
<p>ramp up now billions of vaccine production. Like it&rsquo;s a this is</p>
<p>a non trivial path from here to quote unquote, mass market. And</p>
<p>that takes a long time. I think we have to figure out how we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to administer it. By the way, it&rsquo;s and the way that the</p>
<p>Pfizer vaccine works, and maybe these other folks is you get the</p>
<p>shot. And then, you know, three months, three weeks later, I</p>
<p>think you get a booster. So you have to take two cycles of this</p>
<p>thing. And it&rsquo;s not gonna last forever. And it&rsquo;s not gonna</p>
<p>last forever. So this is a free burgers, right? It&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>beginning of a very different way of living. I think I think</p>
<p>that the good part about it is that, you know, we&rsquo;ve made a lot</p>
<p>of changes that makes our lives a lot more efficient. The bad</p>
<p>part about it is we&rsquo;re even more detached from our neighbors.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;re probably even more likely to be a little</p>
<p>bit more separated if we don&rsquo;t make an effort to be together.</p>
<p>Saks, do you buy this? Because I get the sense that you might be</p>
<p>more optimistic than free bird. Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess I guess I am. I think COVID is going to be a distant</p>
<p>memory by next summer. I think we&rsquo;ll have one to two quarters</p>
<p>of transition. But I think that once the vaccines widely</p>
<p>available, plus the treatment and the testings for the people</p>
<p>who slip through the cracks. Yeah, I tend to think things are</p>
<p>going to snap back very fast. And COVID will just be this bad</p>
<p>memory, a very distant, bad memory. And I think, in fact, I</p>
<p>think things may bounce back the other way. Everyone having been</p>
<p>cooped up and afraid of getting some life threatening illness</p>
<p>are going to come out of this really wanting to party. I think</p>
<p>the whole world&rsquo;s going to be like Tel Aviv for, you know, a</p>
<p>few months or something. And, yeah, I mean, I really do think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to bounce back, I think, to the point politically,</p>
<p>where a few years from now, people could ask, wait, what,</p>
<p>why? Why was it again, that Trump lost, you know, you know,</p>
<p>this COVID thing will be, it will be so in the rearview</p>
<p>mirror that will wonder why we were so afraid of it.</p>
<p>I think this is, I&rsquo;m going to go with David&rsquo;s saxes position</p>
<p>here, because of the simple fact that we had 130,000 confirmed</p>
<p>cases, you know, up until this election period, the last week</p>
<p>or so, and deaths, still, not spiking, it&rsquo;s a little just a</p>
<p>major minor uptick, you know, we had a day with like, I think,</p>
<p>maybe 1500, but still staying in that, you know, 1000 range,</p>
<p>even with cases spiking. And I think that we were so</p>
<p>incompetent with test and trace in this country, that we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see exactly what happens in an authoritarian country, or a</p>
<p>country that is lucky enough to be an island and has easy</p>
<p>borders, which we almost do. I mean, we basically have two</p>
<p>borders, we&rsquo;re like, two thirds of two, you know, 50% island.</p>
<p>But Hawaii, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia, all quarantine</p>
<p>people on the way in, they tested them, and they had</p>
<p>extremely, extremely low death counts, and extremely low case</p>
<p>counts, with the vaccine, being half as effective as you know,</p>
<p>they claim, and rapid testing, which some of us have no, some</p>
<p>of us know people who have experienced rapid testing at</p>
<p>homes. That combination, I believe, is going to make this</p>
<p>go so low. And the people who are high risk are still going to</p>
<p>be scared staying home. I think, like David, come the summer of</p>
<p>next summer, people are going to be at a rave with freebirds,</p>
<p>you know, custom made Molly or whatever he&rsquo;s making during this</p>
<p>downtime, going absolutely bonkers. I think Burning Man</p>
<p>next year, becomes like the, the greatest Burning Man ever,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be it&rsquo;ll be the burn of all burns. Why was let&rsquo;s shift</p>
<p>a bit over to the economy. What a rip? Did we see when that</p>
<p>Pfizer, I mean, the election and Pfizer this week, led to a huge</p>
<p>rip. Obviously, there&rsquo;s a little bit of cyclical movement,</p>
<p>the tech stocks were the big winners. Now people are starting</p>
<p>to buy Disney back up to 140. I guess people assume the parks</p>
<p>will reopen. What&rsquo;s our outlook for the stock market in David</p>
<p>saxes, you know, scenario three, you know, I don&rsquo;t say gridlock</p>
<p>government, but forced to compromise government, what do</p>
<p>we think the markets look like the next two years? I think you</p>
<p>have to go ahead.</p>
<p>I was gonna say gridlock is great for the markets. But both</p>
<p>when Bill Clinton was president with a Republican House, and</p>
<p>when Obama was president, and there was a Republican House,</p>
<p>and I guess, Senate for a period of time, gridlock is great for</p>
<p>the markets, especially given the amount of stimulus that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taken place. I mean, you had the Trump tax cuts, especially</p>
<p>those corporate tax cuts, really set the market on fire. And</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got this pumping by the Fed and the Treasury, all</p>
<p>the stimulus money for COVID. I mean, those conditions, and then</p>
<p>you know, why is gridlock good? We didn&rsquo;t explain that here.</p>
<p>Well, because we&rsquo;re playing to somebody who doesn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>why gridlock is good. Why gridlock is good? Well, because</p>
<p>it creates predictability for business. And it means that</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s not going to get in the way and do something to</p>
<p>screw up the good times. I mean, we have fundamentally, you know,</p>
<p>great underlying conditions for economic growth, which is we</p>
<p>have now pretty low taxes. And we had this, for better or worse,</p>
<p>we had this tremendous amount of stimulus, fiscal stimulus.</p>
<p>What we know historically is over the past 100 years, right</p>
<p>since the 20s, independent of Republican administrations or</p>
<p>democratic administrations, you know, more progressive, less</p>
<p>progressive, more conservative, less conservative, during world</p>
<p>wars, not during world wars. The markets go up 8% a year. So</p>
<p>the do no harm solution is that things inflate naturally by 8%,</p>
<p>especially if those things are public stocks. So you know, the</p>
<p>markets love the fact that there&rsquo;s nothing that could</p>
<p>theoretically get in the way of that natural 8%. And then when</p>
<p>you layer on top of it, as David said, all this free money,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like, rocket fuel, jet fuel. But you know, but you</p>
<p>saw, though, that there was a rotation, right, there was a</p>
<p>rotation out of these high growth software names,</p>
<p>particularly the work from home bid kind of got crushed, you</p>
<p>know, I mean, I think zoom was off 25% over two days or some</p>
<p>crazy thing like that. Meanwhile, sort of all of these</p>
<p>theme park stocks and cruise lines and airlines all of a</p>
<p>sudden ripped. So I mean, look, the reality is the scary thing</p>
<p>about all of this is if any of that stuff actually comes to</p>
<p>pass, we&rsquo;re going to see inflation. And the reason is</p>
<p>because if you start going out and spending a bunch of money on</p>
<p>tickets and vacations and flights and this and that and</p>
<p>pumping money into the economy and taking all that stimulus</p>
<p>money, and putting it back to work, prices will go up. And by</p>
<p>the way, that&rsquo;s not such a bad thing for the economy, which</p>
<p>which needs a little bit of it. So all of this is, I think,</p>
<p>generally very, very good news.</p>
<p>Friedberg, do you have a position on what you think will</p>
<p>happen in the coming? Let&rsquo;s look, I would think the midterm</p>
<p>is what people care most about. So that would be, let&rsquo;s call it</p>
<p>two to six quarters.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one potential speed bump still, which is what I</p>
<p>mentioned at the beginning, which is Georgia. The Democrats</p>
<p>could still win both runoffs in Georgia for Senate. And they</p>
<p>could, because Kamala Harris would then have the breaking</p>
<p>vote, it would be a 50, Republican 50, Democrat Senate,</p>
<p>and the Vice President would, would break any ties.</p>
<p>The question is, if you have that same turnout, where do the</p>
<p>libertarians break? Because I think the libertarians were</p>
<p>almost 2% of the vote?</p>
<p>Well, I think, yeah, what&rsquo;s interesting is, um, the I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you guys have, but I&rsquo;ve gotten emails from a lot of</p>
<p>people asking me to donate money for this runoff campaign in</p>
<p>Georgia. I think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>God, I got so many, so many.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna see literally the biggest, the</p>
<p>biggest funding for a Senate runoff race in history by far,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think sacks like probably north of $100 million</p>
<p>being spent, maybe 100 to $200 million being spent on</p>
<p>advertisements in Georgia to try and get people to go vote one</p>
<p>way or the other. The Democrats think they have a real run at</p>
<p>this, they think it&rsquo;s make or break two years to kind of get</p>
<p>their, you know, history changing policies in effect,</p>
<p>Republicans think it&rsquo;s saved the nation time. So everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rushing to Georgia right now. So the markets are going to have</p>
<p>a very close eye on what&rsquo;s going on over there. I think I&rsquo;m, you</p>
<p>know, I&rsquo;m very nervous about it. If the Democrats look like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting much more money into the state, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually going to, you know, get people to the polls and to the</p>
<p>voting booths and actually get into this runoff on January 5,</p>
<p>and actually flip, get both of those seats to be to be blue,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a very different market environment. I</p>
<p>mean, you could see the market drop by 30 40% in the next six</p>
<p>months, we have a situation where it&rsquo;s 4848. There are two</p>
<p>seats up for grabs, those two seats are in a runoff. And I</p>
<p>want to get into the let me correct that Jason. It&rsquo;s 4850.</p>
<p>Yes, the Republicans have a 50 to 48 advantage with two open</p>
<p>seats in the runoff. Actually, sorry, what one seat is open the</p>
<p>other. It has an incumbent Purdue who&rsquo;s facing awesome.</p>
<p>Purdue one in the last election, he got like 49.9% 50. If you get</p>
<p>50%, you get to this runoff in January, Georgia, the only place</p>
<p>that has this where you have to get to 50 in order to win. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy. It&rsquo;s crazy. So weird. Is this just they want the extra</p>
<p>attention? Or who came up with this idea? This seems just like</p>
<p>every state&rsquo;s got its own history. It&rsquo;s crazy. It is one</p>
<p>of the unique things about living in the United States of</p>
<p>America, as opposed to America. Let&rsquo;s talk about exit polls.</p>
<p>Well, this is what&rsquo;s incredible here. Let me tee this up for</p>
<p>you. So in in 2020, Biden got 80% of the black vote, Trump got</p>
<p>six, this is aggregate. So we can break this down by man and</p>
<p>age group. And you can, it looks even, even more interesting.</p>
<p>Latinos, Biden got 67. Trump got 22% of the Latino vote between</p>
<p>the ages of 18 to 34. So boomers, or sorry, pardon me,</p>
<p>Gen Z, and millennials. Again, I would have thought 100% Biden,</p>
<p>it was on it was 62%. Biden 23% went for Trump, one in four,</p>
<p>amongst women. And again, you know, we thought, okay, you know,</p>
<p>suburban women are breaking Biden 8020. It turned out Biden</p>
<p>got 58% of women, Trump got 35% of all the female vote and the</p>
<p>coup de gras whites with the degree. Again, you would have</p>
<p>thought this would have been 8020 9010 and said it was 53%</p>
<p>Biden 38% Trump.</p>
<p>So this really was something that if we look at this, if we</p>
<p>look back on this, the pollsters were completely wrong in</p>
<p>thinking that once again, that these groups of people are</p>
<p>monolithic. And then I think the most the most mind boggling</p>
<p>to me, and I had a candid discussion about this was the</p>
<p>term Latin x is a catch all term for people who are of Latino,</p>
<p>Spanish speaking descent. And what somebody told me who is in</p>
<p>this Latin x group is that it&rsquo;s the most insulting thing they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever been told. It&rsquo;s almost as a term, like the term saying</p>
<p>Oriental to describe people from Asia, you&rsquo;re just grouping us</p>
<p>all into one thing, people from Cuba, Venezuela, and Mexico all</p>
<p>think the same. This is the absolute, you know, endgame of</p>
<p>identity politics, which is, we have to put you in a corner, we</p>
<p>own you, we own your opinion, and you belong to our party,</p>
<p>whichever party it is, oh, you don&rsquo;t have a degree. You&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>GOP hillbilly. Oh, you, you&rsquo;re Latin x. Okay, well, then we own</p>
<p>you. You&rsquo;re a democrat, David, what I know, and I know that</p>
<p>this is an area where, you know, you have a lot of expertise,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, promoting socialism to people who fled</p>
<p>Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela to escape it turns out not to be a</p>
<p>great election strategy. And, and so yeah, it&rsquo;s this, this</p>
<p>idea that Latin x is is one block, it&rsquo;s not it consists of a</p>
<p>bunch of different, of immigrants from a bunch of</p>
<p>different nations. And the ones who fled socialism are not eager</p>
<p>to reenact it in the United States. The Republicans flipped</p>
<p>to house seats in South Florida, where there&rsquo;s a lot of Cuban</p>
<p>Americans. And even in the, the heavily Mexican American</p>
<p>counties in along the Rio Grande in Texas, Trump improved.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, it looks like he improved 59 and 30% 39%,</p>
<p>respectively over his 2016 showing. So this is not just</p>
<p>some fluke of the exit polls. It seems like Trump really made</p>
<p>progress in a lot of these groups that seem to defy their,</p>
<p>you know, what, what the promoters of identity politics,</p>
<p>the way that they want them to vote. Gay Americans were another</p>
<p>one. I think Trump improved his share of the gay vote from 14%</p>
<p>in 2016 to 28% this year. So I mean, really, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>amazing. People are not voting the way that they&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>vote. Trump also improved from 12 to 18% with black men, and</p>
<p>four to 8% of black women. I mean, those are still pretty</p>
<p>low numbers, but there was improvement there. And I think</p>
<p>part of the reason is that not all of the African American</p>
<p>community is on board with defunding the police.</p>
<p>Well, I also think what it means is identity politics is a</p>
<p>stupid strategy, forget whether you&rsquo;re offended by it or not.</p>
<p>At this point, what&rsquo;s clear is it&rsquo;s a stupid fucking strategy.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s a path to losing. Because the more and</p>
<p>more you do it, the more and more you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>disenfranchise individuals who want to be judged sort of sound</p>
<p>mind and body. Right? I mean, if he took 1000 Sri Lankans and</p>
<p>put them in a room and said, Jamal, I&rsquo;m going to judge you as</p>
<p>a Sri Lankan vote, I would tell you to go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>I would be deeply offended by that.</p>
<p>And this is where I think the radical left is going to have to</p>
<p>retool because their theory of how they take power in America</p>
<p>was always that demographics is destiny, that, you know, as the</p>
<p>country simply becomes more diverse, we&rsquo;re gonna, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>automatically going to vote for us. And there&rsquo;s a lot of data</p>
<p>in this election to show that that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>happen. You actually have to run on issues that people care</p>
<p>about. Let&rsquo;s think about this in the context of internet</p>
<p>advertising, right? The world prior to internet advertising,</p>
<p>you had, you know, channels, and you would have an audience</p>
<p>that was estimated to be made up of some demographic set on that</p>
<p>channel, and you would buy an ad spot on that channel. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s who you would reach. And so you would create a message</p>
<p>for that. Now, today, we can create personalized ads and</p>
<p>personalized messages. And internet advertisers are much</p>
<p>more thoughtful about targeting, targeting based on</p>
<p>psychographic profiling, behavioral targeting. And I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s where politics has to head in the United States is</p>
<p>kind of keeping up with this personalization of both</p>
<p>products, but also of media and ads. And, and I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re going to see. If you listen to James Carville, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, you know, a classic kind of democratic campaign advisor,</p>
<p>and he did a podcast just leading up to the election. And</p>
<p>if you listen to this podcast, these guys are very old school,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the whites are going to do this, and the blacks are</p>
<p>going to do that. And the college educator are going to do</p>
<p>this, and the others are going to do that. And they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize that the segmentation that&rsquo;s possible today, I think,</p>
<p>reveals a lot more about the character of the of the</p>
<p>population. They&rsquo;re basically I think it&rsquo;s such an astute point</p>
<p>for a break. They&rsquo;re basically living in the level of</p>
<p>granularity of network cable. It&rsquo;s like cable TV. Yeah.</p>
<p>Got to cable TV. And they&rsquo;re like, okay, bet ESPN, NASCAR,</p>
<p>and get guess what, like, like, the world is much more complex</p>
<p>individuals have found their own personal voice. And they found</p>
<p>their own personal voice through social media, through Instagram</p>
<p>through this ability to kind of define themselves not fit within</p>
<p>a cohort. And I think that&rsquo;s what maybe they always did feel</p>
<p>that way. And we just had never had the technology to get there.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s also about people like</p>
<p>people have complex points of view, you know, the four of us</p>
<p>sit here and none of neither of us, none of us identify as a</p>
<p>party anymore. We all identify with with certain points that we</p>
<p>think are important to us individually. And then we have a</p>
<p>point of view on those points. And I think that&rsquo;s the case for</p>
<p>the majority of the population in the United States. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think people are like, I&rsquo;m just a fucking Democrat, no matter</p>
<p>what number Republican, no matter what people care more</p>
<p>deeply, in a more complex way. And I think politics needs to</p>
<p>resolve to that. And, and that&rsquo;s going to require a shift in how</p>
<p>you communicate, how you message how you get feedback,</p>
<p>how you drive blocks for voting, and it&rsquo;s gonna it&rsquo;s gonna, you</p>
<p>know, be a really interesting change over the next 15 to 20</p>
<p>years. And it may be what saves the republic.</p>
<p>I think this is an incredible observation. It might be the</p>
<p>observation of the episode. And I just want to point to a tweet</p>
<p>I did because this is this election has really led to me</p>
<p>doing two things. One, I&rsquo;ve been just thinking deeply about what</p>
<p>do I actually understand about Americans in America. And then I</p>
<p>also, you know, there&rsquo;s all these red pills around. So I</p>
<p>decided I would crush up a red pill. And I would just, you</p>
<p>know, put a little on my finger, and I try a little red pill for</p>
<p>a second. And everybody told me I&rsquo;ve been red pilled now on</p>
<p>Twitter, and then I&rsquo;m a Trump fan. I&rsquo;m not I hate the guy. I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s horrible. But I did this quick survey here. I said,</p>
<p>if you voted for Trump, I want to understand what percentage of</p>
<p>your vote vote was based on the combination of a cancel culture</p>
<p>be identity politics, see socialism, D coastal elites</p>
<p>telling you how to live, explain other issues that contributed</p>
<p>in a reply, ie spending, immigration, SC, the Supreme</p>
<p>Court, etc. And I just said, 0% 1 to 2526 to 50, and over 50.</p>
<p>And and I got 12,000 votes, go ahead and look at the results.</p>
<p>Not the replies, but go ahead and vote. It doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>which one you pick. Over 50% of people who voted for Trump, and</p>
<p>I know this is unscientific. It&rsquo;s my followers, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely feels directionally correct. The people who felt 26</p>
<p>to over 50% was part of the cancel culture identity culture</p>
<p>was what they were trying to communicate with their vote.</p>
<p>Well, this is this is such an important thing, because I think</p>
<p>this is what we&rsquo;re fighting over the every single 70% of them,</p>
<p>every single election going forward, like if you if you put</p>
<p>this on top of the 70 odd million people that voted, this</p>
<p>kind of roughly makes sense, which is that, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably about 20 million people who will completely vote</p>
<p>Democrat, no matter what, and 20 million people who will</p>
<p>completely vote Republican, no matter what, their their just</p>
<p>eyes are closed, their ears are closed, they don&rsquo;t care. But</p>
<p>when you take those people out, there&rsquo;s this enormous amount of</p>
<p>people in the middle, who have the ability to vote a split</p>
<p>ticket, you know, and as and as and as sexy poo said, like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll vote a Democrat into the White House, but then down</p>
<p>ballot, they&rsquo;ll vote a bunch of Republicans, and they&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>make sure there&rsquo;s a balance of power. So they&rsquo;ve been telling</p>
<p>us about this kind of centricity for years. And so if you want to</p>
<p>win an election, you do two things. Part one is you</p>
<p>understand this dynamic that centrism wins. And part two is</p>
<p>what Friedberg says, which is you understand that we need to</p>
<p>enter sort of the Google CPC world of political advertising,</p>
<p>and really cater not just the ads, but also the message to</p>
<p>individual people and stop the you know, the cat, the gross</p>
<p>high level categorization, which isn&rsquo;t working anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, and Jason, let me can I can I add the connection between</p>
<p>cancel culture and the selection. So, you know,</p>
<p>obviously, the pollsters got everything completely wrong.</p>
<p>And again, again, and but the reason is because of cancel</p>
<p>culture. So in exit polling, 45% of Republicans with college</p>
<p>degrees, express fear that their careers could be at risk if</p>
<p>their views became known, compared to only 23% of</p>
<p>Democrats saying that. And so there were these, you know,</p>
<p>quote, unquote, shy Trump voters, who are afraid to tell</p>
<p>pollsters what they really think. Now, it wasn&rsquo;t the Trump</p>
<p>voters that you think of, when you see the pickup trucks and</p>
<p>the convoys go by or the rallies, sort of those, those</p>
<p>were the voters from 2016, who weren&rsquo;t counted, it was sort of</p>
<p>the non college blue collar voters, the Michael Moore, you</p>
<p>know, people who turned out for Trump and big numbers and</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t properly counted four years ago, the pollsters</p>
<p>actually counted those people correctly this time, the people</p>
<p>they completely underestimated was actually the white college</p>
<p>vote, who swung for a lot of swung from Democrat to</p>
<p>Republican, they voted for Trump because of this issue,</p>
<p>and they were afraid to say anything about it, because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re afraid of getting cancelled.</p>
<p>And by the way, they, they are every other person, everybody</p>
<p>listening to this podcast works with. And so deal with that one.</p>
<p>Right, exactly. Anybody who&rsquo;s not actively virtue signaling</p>
<p>on Twitter for Biden is a Trump voter.</p>
<p>Not sure if that&rsquo;s exactly correct, but I think it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Roughly, you know, if people aren&rsquo;t, if people in tech,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t explicitly endorsing Biden on Twitter, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably closet Trump voters.</p>
<p>It is going to be very interesting for people to go</p>
<p>back to offices, because now we have had a resolution, and</p>
<p>identity politics, cancel culture, and extreme is among</p>
<p>both sides, hysterical and trolling, trolling Republicans</p>
<p>hysterical libs. This has been a loss for both of those</p>
<p>parties. And now the pandemic is ending. We&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>back in offices at some point. I mean, what is office culture</p>
<p>going to be like, are people going to go with the Brian</p>
<p>Armstrong? Let&rsquo;s just get work done here. Let&rsquo;s not talk about</p>
<p>politics. It&rsquo;s just too charged or not. It&rsquo;s going to be a very</p>
<p>interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s every it&rsquo;s every, it&rsquo;s every company&rsquo;s right. You know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s every company&rsquo;s right to care about what they want to</p>
<p>care about every board, every CEO, every controlling</p>
<p>shareholder, and then it&rsquo;s every employee&rsquo;s right to vote with</p>
<p>their feet about whether that&rsquo;s okay or not. And I think that</p>
<p>look, I mean, the whole Brian Armstrong thing, again, just to</p>
<p>say, one of the most pathetically poorly written, you</p>
<p>know, pieces of English prose I&rsquo;ve ever fucking seen, you</p>
<p>know, he&rsquo;s a crypto in fairness, my dog, my dogs, he&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>coder, he&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s a CEO, my dog slamming his her paw on the</p>
<p>keyboard would have created a better pros in that, but he was</p>
<p>coming from a reasonable place, he had the right to say what he</p>
<p>said. The problem is that it&rsquo;s so antithetical to what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>allowed to believe, for example, living in San Francisco. But I</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s going to change because you can&rsquo;t ignore</p>
<p>every other person telling you that there are meaningful</p>
<p>economic issues that matter, and that the prioritization and</p>
<p>the policing of these, you know, sort of high value social</p>
<p>signaling issues are no longer a priority. And I think that</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen is there will be room for a party that</p>
<p>focuses on that, and a group of people, but they will be</p>
<p>relegated, just like on the other side, that will happen to</p>
<p>the Republican version of that as well. I just think this whole</p>
<p>thing to this, honestly, for me, it was, it seems like such a</p>
<p>tight election it is, but I really think the huge winner</p>
<p>here is centrism.</p>
<p>I agree with that. And I would say that this election proves</p>
<p>that Brian Armstrong was right. Because the average American is</p>
<p>tired of these highly charged political situations. And the</p>
<p>last thing they want to do is have these conversations at</p>
<p>work, where they can get reported to where they can</p>
<p>offend their co workers and get reported to HR, but it can make</p>
<p>them feel unsafe. They don&rsquo;t want to have these conversations</p>
<p>at work. Certainly, by the way, only 5% of Coinbase&rsquo;s employees</p>
<p>took Armstrong up on that offer to leave. So the number of</p>
<p>people who actually want to have a politically charged workplace</p>
<p>is very, very small. They&rsquo;re just the noisiest. They&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>squeakiest wheel. I mean, that was a ridiculous deal. I mean,</p>
<p>what did he say six months and we vest as he made it really</p>
<p>attractive to leave if you didn&rsquo;t agree with this policy</p>
<p>that was that written because I couldn&rsquo;t figure that out. It was</p>
<p>an attractive deal to leave if you wanted to leave and 95% chose</p>
<p>to sit Yeah, I did I say it was poorly written. I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it because it was so poorly written. So anyway, so</p>
<p>9095% stayed. So my point is just the number of people who</p>
<p>actually like this highly polarized politically charged</p>
<p>situation in which we&rsquo;re all arguing with our friends over</p>
<p>politics, and children are divorcing their parents because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not woke enough. I mean, people don&rsquo;t want to live</p>
<p>in that kind of country anymore. And I think this is the thing</p>
<p>that Joe Biden really got right in his campaign. I mean, this is</p>
<p>why I mean, this is the only way that his basement strategy</p>
<p>could actually work and result in him getting elected, elected</p>
<p>is people actually do want this return to normalcy.</p>
<p>You know who the biggest loser is going to be coming out of</p>
<p>this, I think not when you think holistically about the</p>
<p>ecosystem. It&rsquo;s going to be the media, because they have made</p>
<p>an absolute fortune over the last four or five years picking</p>
<p>aside. What is the point of watching Rachel Maddow, January</p>
<p>20? What is the point of tuning into Fox News, or reading the</p>
<p>hysterical opinion page of the New York Times, all of these</p>
<p>places that were being propped up by either Trump ism, or</p>
<p>anti Trump ism are now going to find themselves where they</p>
<p>started, which is a job without a job. And we just wanted you to</p>
<p>tell us the news. And there was a straight, there was a great</p>
<p>article, the New York Times have an opinion page, rip the</p>
<p>opinion page out of the New York Times, rip it out of the</p>
<p>Wall Street. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I, no, I disagree. I</p>
<p>think the opposite happens, which is that opinion page was</p>
<p>meant to be where people could have an opinion so that</p>
<p>everything else was fact. And the problem is that all the</p>
<p>other pages became opinion as well. Nobody told anybody.</p>
<p>Nobody can tell the difference.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. They can&rsquo;t tell the difference. And look at that</p>
<p>expose about how Barry or Barry Weiss was run out of the New</p>
<p>York Times. It basically the activists ran her out. And the</p>
<p>reality is activists have completely captured the New York</p>
<p>Times and CNN and MSNBC. And there is no they always had Fox</p>
<p>and the New York they always had Fox, but but now we have no</p>
<p>objective neutral media. And so who&rsquo;s going to call the</p>
<p>election? I mean, you complain about the fact that Trump is</p>
<p>sowing dissent, but who is the universally trusted spokesperson</p>
<p>for neutrality the way that Walter Cronkite was, when he</p>
<p>could just declare it, and that&rsquo;s the way it is. And</p>
<p>people believe that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>Who did the best job Friedberg that night when we were doing</p>
<p>that? Let&rsquo;s reflect on the live stream. I have two questions</p>
<p>for the live stream. Number one, who was your bestie guestie?</p>
<p>Who did you think added the most as a guestie? And why? And</p>
<p>then number two, or do we&rsquo;re doing whatever we&rsquo;re gonna do a</p>
<p>poll, a human value.</p>
<p>Got a lot of feedback on the guesties. There were girly</p>
<p>people. Can I say one more thing? Brad, before before we</p>
<p>go there, there was a there was a really good article in the</p>
<p>New York Times about Maggie Haberman, right? And Maggie,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a fantastic journalist, but built an entire career,</p>
<p>it really amplified came to a head in 2016. And she just</p>
<p>scoop after scoop about Trump. But the most impelling thing</p>
<p>about that whole article was somewhere near the, you know,</p>
<p>third of the way from the bottom. She&rsquo;s like, look, at the</p>
<p>end of the day, she said something like, I&rsquo;m dispensable,</p>
<p>and I know it. And it was the most honest thing, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, despite her popularity, and despite sort of, you know,</p>
<p>how big of a stick she carries, the reality is sans Trump.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just nothing to do. There&rsquo;s nothing to leak. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there, there just is not nearly as much to do.</p>
<p>I did just put in the, the chat here, the Washington Post, Fox</p>
<p>News, The Hill, basically, like the full gamut of, of, of media</p>
<p>opinion, have highlighted that the media generally is the</p>
<p>biggest loser of the of the 2020 election. And I think I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve just lost the the faith of their audience. And, you</p>
<p>know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s just access point, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how many people were, you&rsquo;re either looking for objective,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve lost it, or you&rsquo;re looking for opinionated, and you</p>
<p>feel like you&rsquo;re, you know, you&rsquo;re aligned opinion setting</p>
<p>media partner has betrayed you. You know, the fact that Fox</p>
<p>called it for, for Trump, and Trump&rsquo;s now saying Fox is a</p>
<p>liar. The fact that the New York Times doesn&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being objective anymore. And they&rsquo;re, you know, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running people out of the out of the newsroom. In general, I</p>
<p>just feel like we&rsquo;ve been disenfranchised. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s going to be really hard to kind</p>
<p>of recover from and resolve. And for the love of God, can</p>
<p>somebody please get I don&rsquo;t want you to break any laws. But</p>
<p>however, if we could read the slack channel of the New York</p>
<p>Times reporters leading up to the hundred days of this</p>
<p>election, that would become the greatest best selling book of</p>
<p>all time to watch the New York Times writers bicker with each</p>
<p>other, sacks. I mean, we could do 10 hours on that. No problem.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk. Okay, bestie guest. Guesties. What&rsquo;d you think of</p>
<p>our guests? I thought they were all great. I thought they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>great. Are we now becoming a media critics? We&rsquo;re gonna now?</p>
<p>Yeah. What do we like? Why don&rsquo;t you go? Why are you that</p>
<p>navel gazing? You go.</p>
<p>Jason wants Jason wants to throw mute under the bus. Go ahead,</p>
<p>Jason. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, contraire. Does anyone have</p>
<p>a video they want to person on the</p>
<p>mute in his place? And it was not the it was not the point</p>
<p>guard in this case. Somebody pulled a dream on and pulled</p>
<p>help me up the side and said, Stop, you got to pass the ball.</p>
<p>I do think Brad did a great job. He had some great insights. I</p>
<p>think Bill Gurley had some great insights. We I think we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>really good job of getting some people to rotate in. I enjoyed</p>
<p>it. Yeah, I thought it was really everyone was great. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>give a shout out to my bestie Newman. He was better. He was</p>
<p>better as a political analyst and all those jokers on CNN and</p>
<p>Fox and MSNBC. The dude with the with the map and he kept</p>
<p>touching the map and yeah, it&rsquo;s like that guy gets paid to do</p>
<p>that. I can&rsquo;t believe he gets paid to do that. I&rsquo;m gonna get</p>
<p>my daughter on CNN. She can do that. When the guy on CNN who</p>
<p>does that john john king john king. God bless this guy.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know how much Adderall he&rsquo;s on. But I turned</p>
<p>it on at 8am. And he was zooming into Pennsylvania. And he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, Oh, well, of course, in 2018. This I&rsquo;m 2016. He&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s zoom out. Let&rsquo;s go back to Arizona. Of course, in</p>
<p>Arizona, this place. I was like, is this guy a geography</p>
<p>teacher? I mean, he was amazing. And just the dexterity. He</p>
<p>looked like he was Tom Cruise and minority report with the</p>
<p>finger. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d call him Tom</p>
<p>Cruise. When I look like Tom Cruise, but the minority report</p>
<p>pinch and zoom in and out. It was incredible when when when</p>
<p>does Trump call this thing? That&rsquo;s a great question. Well,</p>
<p>I think he has to run out these court challenges, which will</p>
<p>take a few weeks, but I predict by Thanksgiving, but it may have</p>
<p>to go up to the Supreme Court. But he&rsquo;s gonna he&rsquo;s gonna dot</p>
<p>the dot every i and cross every T that he&rsquo;s got legally. But</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got like we talked about the very beginning, he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>huge uphill challenge. I see the court ultimately ruling</p>
<p>against him or throwing it out. What is the point, David? What</p>
<p>is well, because why shouldn&rsquo;t he? He&rsquo;s not gonna win? No, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know that he he knows that he he I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>his right to exhaust every legal possibility. And let&rsquo;s remember</p>
<p>Al Gore didn&rsquo;t concede for 37 days after the election. So I</p>
<p>certainly think Trump is within his rights over the next few</p>
<p>weeks to run this out. In terms of what the point is, I mean,</p>
<p>other than the obvious attempt to challenge it legally, I do</p>
<p>think this is partly a branding exercise by Trump. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>marketing exercise, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s going to come up with</p>
<p>enough malfeasance to overturn an election. But I do think</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll probably produce a lot of smoke. And this is about</p>
<p>protecting his brand as a winner. And, you know, if he</p>
<p>kicks up enough, you know, examples of voter fraud, or</p>
<p>what have you, he&rsquo;ll always be able to say, you know, years</p>
<p>from now that this was, it was a stolen election. And when you</p>
<p>combine the fact that COVID really did drive this, this</p>
<p>election, you could call that Chinese election interference,</p>
<p>if you want the fact that the vaccine is now here already,</p>
<p>you could call that, you know, some sort of election</p>
<p>interference, he&rsquo;s going to have enough arguments where if he</p>
<p>wants to run four years from now, I think he probably gets</p>
<p>the Republican nomination again, what what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>percentage chance to math that he runs again in four years?</p>
<p>Zero. Freiburg.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think he&rsquo;s gonna be making so much money. He&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna know what to do with himself. He&rsquo;s not going back to</p>
<p>that fucking tortures. He didn&rsquo;t even think about the</p>
<p>White House, like some terrible Blumhouse production movie set.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, fuck that. I&rsquo;m not going back there. It was awful.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s he going? Where&rsquo;s he going? He&rsquo;s going to Shanghai?</p>
<p>Is he going to? You can be in New York, he&rsquo;s gonna buy a law</p>
<p>firm because you&rsquo;re gonna need a law firm to keep everyone at</p>
<p>bay. And he&rsquo;s gonna be probably printing 100 million bucks a</p>
<p>month. You know, put it at Dubai, Saudi Arabia. I think I</p>
<p>think I think he&rsquo;s definitely gonna launch a media business.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll, he&rsquo;ll try to become kingmaker.</p>
<p>I think he will become a kingmaker Republican politics,</p>
<p>he will launch a competitor to Fox News, but it will also be</p>
<p>Fox News hybridized with a grassroots movement like the Tea</p>
<p>Party. And every Republican will need to go get his</p>
<p>endorsement or they will be primaried by the Trump Party.</p>
<p>And I would not put it</p>
<p>agree more, could not disagree more. I think he&rsquo;s a disgrace.</p>
<p>I think he will be. I think what David said is gonna come not</p>
<p>you, David, I&rsquo;m talking about Trump. I think David&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible. No, I think the stuff that comes out after this</p>
<p>the deluge, the number of SDNY suits, all the grift and the</p>
<p>graft, it&rsquo;s all coming out. Not only is he not going to be a</p>
<p>kingmaker, he will not be able to get the backing for this</p>
<p>network. It&rsquo;ll be Breitbart light, and it&rsquo;ll be shut down</p>
<p>within 24 months, he&rsquo;ll fail so miserably, that when he walks</p>
<p>into a restaurant, it&rsquo;ll be like Game of Thrones, shame, shame.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think so. I think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that the Donald Trump that runs for</p>
<p>President 2024 is Donald Trump Jr.</p>
<p>Oh, God, no, he&rsquo;s horrible. whole Republican Party has to</p>
<p>start over. Let&rsquo;s end on this. Pompeo did a press conference.</p>
<p>Is the State Department currently preparing to engage</p>
<p>with the Biden transition team? And if not, at what point does a</p>
<p>delay hamper a smooth transition or pose a risk to</p>
<p>national security? There will be a smooth transition to a</p>
<p>second Trump administration. All right, we&rsquo;re ready. The world</p>
<p>is watching what&rsquo;s taking place here. We&rsquo;re going to count all</p>
<p>the votes. When the process is complete, there&rsquo;ll be electors</p>
<p>selected. There&rsquo;s a process the Constitution lays it out pretty</p>
<p>clearly. The world should have every confidence that the</p>
<p>transition necessary to make sure that the State Department</p>
<p>is functional today, successful today, and successful with the</p>
<p>president who&rsquo;s in office on January 20. A minute afternoon</p>
<p>will also be successful. Can I just say I don&rsquo;t disagree with</p>
<p>the position they&rsquo;re taking. It&rsquo;s not immoral. It&rsquo;s customary</p>
<p>and traditional to concede your election. But, you know,</p>
<p>December 15 is the date that Congress ratifies the electoral</p>
<p>votes to determine who the next president is going to be. And</p>
<p>these guys are just taking a very kind of pragmatic legal</p>
<p>line that is not immoral in a way. They believe that they have</p>
<p>some case on what the vote should be. The votes are all very</p>
<p>close, yada yada. I&rsquo;m not saying that he&rsquo;s going to win by any</p>
<p>chance. But I don&rsquo;t think that folks saying like, let the votes</p>
<p>be counted and let Congress do their job of having the states</p>
<p>tell them who their electoral votes are going to is an</p>
<p>inappropriate position to take. I sound like I might sound like</p>
<p>some conservative, you know, Trump head, but I&rsquo;m not. I think</p>
<p>that these guys, what I&rsquo;m just saying is that these guys aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that immoral in kind of asking for that for that, you know,</p>
<p>sorry, I also think at the fringes of the Republican Party,</p>
<p>this is what you keep all these militia folks and all these</p>
<p>other folks at bay is just you show a really methodical, you</p>
<p>know, stepping away from the spotlight. And I think that this</p>
<p>is, you know, honestly, it&rsquo;s, this is a very deliberate, safe,</p>
<p>calming thing to do. Because there&rsquo;s been nothing about the</p>
<p>Trump administration from 2016, through to this very moment that</p>
<p>has been customary or traditional. And so I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why we all expected him to step in and say, like, I can see like</p>
<p>the way that we&rsquo;ve been doing it. It would be worse. It&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>worse if he had conceded and all of a sudden was holding a bunch</p>
<p>of protests and rallies all over the country that he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>doing anything illegal. No one has any legal requirement to</p>
<p>concede. And, you know, and I think as long as these guys on</p>
<p>December 15, which is the date that we should all be watching</p>
<p>and waiting for, as long as these guys do the appropriate</p>
<p>thing at that point, then, you know, that that&rsquo;s the only point</p>
<p>in which I would have any sort of concern or worry about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with the transition in the government. But sorry, I</p>
<p>think this is about saving face and saving brand a sexy percent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;ll be out by December 15. Meaning it&rsquo;ll this will all</p>
<p>be done. Yeah, I agree. And look, let&rsquo;s remember that Al</p>
<p>Gore was able to challenge the election result for 37 days</p>
<p>without being hysterically accused of undermining</p>
<p>democracy. So let Trump have his day in court. It&rsquo;ll play out</p>
<p>over the next few weeks. I expect that the obstacles he</p>
<p>has has to overcome are too large and he will lose these</p>
<p>lawsuits. It might go to the Supreme Court. It would not be</p>
<p>a bad thing if the Supreme Court were the ones to make this</p>
<p>decision. They&rsquo;re one of the last institutions that still</p>
<p>trusted. Clearly, the media are not. And I think that, you know,</p>
<p>Trump will accept the result, he may not concede, but he will</p>
<p>accept the result when it comes from the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Is there a nonzero chance that he could win on a recount?</p>
<p>He would have to prove systemic fraud, because it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>Florida, where there&rsquo;s just one state and a few hundred votes,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got to overcome over 12,000 votes in at least three</p>
<p>states. So that&rsquo;s the issue is, is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a percent on its acts if you had to lay money on it?</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, it&rsquo;s like sub 10% chance, I think.</p>
<p>Sub 10% chance one in 10, you&rsquo;d give 10 to one odds.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s under 10%. I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s a very small</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the thing. So Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court ruled</p>
<p>seven to two. I mean, you would have thought it was nine to zero.</p>
<p>So clearly, there was some sympathizers in Bush v. Gore. So</p>
<p>hopefully, you know, it&rsquo;s something like seven to two.</p>
<p>And, you know, we move on.</p>
<p>I believe if it gets the Supreme Court, it will be at least</p>
<p>seven to two, if not a one or nine zero. Just because I think</p>
<p>Trump has a much harder case to prove. In Florida, the issue</p>
<p>was simply whether the recount should be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>James Baker went to the Supreme Court to stop the recount</p>
<p>that was in process, because of the fear that the local corrupt</p>
<p>election officials basically steal the election for Gore that</p>
<p>you know, but but but Bush was always ahead in that election.</p>
<p>There was never a time when Bush was behind.</p>
<p>Biden is now ahead in every swing state that matters.</p>
<p>Trump has to now overturn that result in at least three of</p>
<p>those states. I don&rsquo;t know how he does that by 10s of thousands</p>
<p>of votes. I just don&rsquo;t know how he does that. He has to prove</p>
<p>some sort of systemic fraud that took place across the nation</p>
<p>that and look, I think from like a marketing or branding</p>
<p>standpoint, he&rsquo;ll be able to create a lot of smoke. I think</p>
<p>they will actually find quite a bit of misconduct because I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think our elections are perfect. But will it rise to the</p>
<p>standard that the Supreme Court is going to set for overturning</p>
<p>an election? I don&rsquo;t think so. I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ll probably find it on both sides. There&rsquo;s got to</p>
<p>be some crazy. Well, the other Trump supporter who has 10</p>
<p>ballots they signed and there&rsquo;ll be some crazy liberal who did</p>
<p>this. Well, the nuance on that out, the nuanced issue is</p>
<p>whether they can do a constitutionally valid recount by</p>
<p>you know, the time necessary as well. So the longer that this</p>
<p>delays on, then they&rsquo;ll be forced to basically say no to</p>
<p>that also, because otherwise it will be effectively throwing</p>
<p>out an election. And so as we wrap here, San Francisco&rsquo;s</p>
<p>continuous to devolve revenue down 40% in terms of taxes,</p>
<p>budget is double what it&rsquo;s been just a few years ago, crime is</p>
<p>going crazy. Walmart is closing their stores and leaving</p>
<p>Walgreens because of Walgreens, I&rsquo;m sorry, Walgreens, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a Walmart here. And there&rsquo;s 20 there&rsquo;s more homes on the</p>
<p>market now than there have been too much of anything is a bad</p>
<p>thing. If you eat too much broccoli, it&rsquo;s a bad thing. You</p>
<p>know what I mean? So too much of a single party monoculture is</p>
<p>bad. Whether it&rsquo;s Republican or Democrat, you need a diverse</p>
<p>centrist plurality. And in the absence of that, many cities</p>
<p>that veer in one direction or the other will decay and die.</p>
<p>And San Francisco is going to be the tip of the spear for the</p>
<p>left&rsquo;s version. And there&rsquo;s been a bunch of cities that have</p>
<p>already been the examples of the rights version. So you know</p>
<p>what, apparently the water is warm, and they want to join.</p>
<p>Anybody else?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t find a lot to disagree with there. I think San</p>
<p>Francisco, we&rsquo;re basically an Atlas shrugged. I mean, the</p>
<p>half the storefronts are closed, they&rsquo;re boarded up, the city is</p>
<p>completely surrendered to the criminal element, you can&rsquo;t park</p>
<p>your car anywhere in the city without having it getting broken</p>
<p>into they won&rsquo;t prosecute people for crimes, including</p>
<p>increasingly violent crimes. The, you know, the, the city is</p>
<p>about to go bankrupt, and the entrepreneurs are all</p>
<p>disappearing. They&rsquo;re all leaving. I mean, it&rsquo;s right out</p>
<p>of the shrugged.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the, the action is the wrong action,</p>
<p>right? So San Francisco, the biggest disappointment of</p>
<p>election night for me was the new business taxes that were</p>
<p>passed for San Francisco businesses. And, and there was</p>
<p>also this, like, for 99.9999999% of people, they&rsquo;re gonna shrug</p>
<p>and say, I don&rsquo;t give a shit. But there was this new tax of 6%</p>
<p>for homes that get sold over $10 million. Now, if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>successful entrepreneur, an investor, or a CEO of a company</p>
<p>in San Francisco, and you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like a slap in the</p>
<p>face. You add the business tax with that kind of high end</p>
<p>property tax. And it&rsquo;s almost like an invitation to leave the</p>
<p>city. And some people are nodding their head. This 6% is on</p>
<p>leaving or buying transaction when you sell. So you literally</p>
<p>6% off the top. When you sell a home, the city basically just</p>
<p>took 6% of my house. Yeah, the city just took 6% of my house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now they&rsquo;re now a part owner of my house. Yeah, it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>estate tax. And so there are people like there are people in</p>
<p>San Francisco, who we all know, how much warning did you have</p>
<p>before they took your non bedroom? Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>London breed put some people in taxes their 13th bedroom on the</p>
<p>third floor. They&rsquo;re all living there right now. But it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I got like wings I don&rsquo;t even know about. It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Richie Rich&rsquo;s house or something. So look, no, nobody</p>
<p>cries. Nobody cries for super rich people. And you know, but</p>
<p>it was short sighted is the point, right? Right? Exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not complaining about the taxes on me, but it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>do tremendous damage to the city. People are not going to</p>
<p>want to move here. And we Yeah, yeah, I look I&rsquo;ve built</p>
<p>businesses in San Francisco since 2006. And I will not build</p>
<p>another business in San Francisco. And I hear the same</p>
<p>from other entrepreneurs, if you&rsquo;re going to build a</p>
<p>business, do it in the South Bay, do it in the East Bay, do</p>
<p>it in the North Bay or do it in Austin or LA or somewhere else.</p>
<p>But this is just not a place to build businesses. The city is</p>
<p>basically saying we don&rsquo;t want you here. Now, that would be</p>
<p>fine and dandy if the city was being conservative in the way</p>
<p>that they spend and if they were actually reducing their</p>
<p>budget and you know, kind of reducing the city&rsquo;s activities.</p>
<p>The problem is these these taxes diverge with the budget</p>
<p>because the taxes are now going to go down because businesses</p>
<p>are leaving people are selling their homes, they&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to buy expensive homes anymore. And we are seeing a budget</p>
<p>crisis, San Francisco, I think it&rsquo;s looking at a 1.7 to $2</p>
<p>billion budget shortfall this year. I mean, like, where&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>money gonna come from? This is a city with 800,000 and we have</p>
<p>and there was that expose in the San Francisco Chronicle</p>
<p>talking about how there&rsquo;s over 20,000 city workers making over</p>
<p>$150,000 a year, 30,000. Yeah, what are we getting for all of</p>
<p>that? The evidence is not apparent. And this is where</p>
<p>okay, look, I&rsquo;d be happy to give the city 6% of my house and pay</p>
<p>all these high taxes if we actually got something for it.</p>
<p>But the city just keeps getting less and less livable.</p>
<p>Yes, city budget in 2013.</p>
<p>And so we have a fiscal crisis and we have a livability crisis</p>
<p>that I think is even worse. And that&rsquo;s a huge problem. And let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>be frank, San Francisco was always the accidental</p>
<p>beneficiary of Silicon Valley. If you will, San Francisco was</p>
<p>the accidental billionaire. It was Silicon Valley that created</p>
<p>this enormous wealth and all the jobs and the companies. It</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t San Francisco policies or politics that created any of</p>
<p>that. It just so happens that Silicon Valley got big enough.</p>
<p>It started around Stanford, it got big enough that San Francisco</p>
<p>as the nearest metropolitan area really was a beneficiary of</p>
<p>that. And, and, you know, because they never really did</p>
<p>anything to create the conditions for that prosperity,</p>
<p>frankly, they took it for granted. And now that the rug&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been pulled out from under them, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>going to know what to do.</p>
<p>Local San Francisco politicians treated Silicon Valley success</p>
<p>as a grab bag. And Uber set up here and Twitter and Square and</p>
<p>Salesforce. And San Francisco politicians put their hand in</p>
<p>the honey jar and took as much as they could. And it&rsquo;s now</p>
<p>backfiring because new businesses don&rsquo;t want to set up</p>
<p>here. Entrepreneurs don&rsquo;t want to operate here. And as Saks is</p>
<p>pointing out, the, you know, the rapid kind of inflation has</p>
<p>caused this tremendous decline in the quality of service.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s zero accountability, zero checks and balances. So San</p>
<p>Francisco is in for a really, frank, scary reckoning. And a</p>
<p>lot of people are really worried about it. And it&rsquo;s like a very</p>
<p>real problem. It&rsquo;s not like, oh, the city&rsquo;s fucked. Ha ha, like</p>
<p>a $2 billion budget shortfall. You&rsquo;re either going to have to</p>
<p>cut a lot of jobs of public employees, or you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have a city that&rsquo;s going to go bankrupt. And you know, bonds</p>
<p>are going to get defaulted on. And at the same time, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have this mass exodus of people and businesses. And it</p>
<p>is a it is a very kind of unwinding not right now. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a scary moment. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a real great</p>
<p>answer for what I think it&rsquo;s more nuanced, but I think it I</p>
<p>think it will happen. Mark my words, San Francisco will file</p>
<p>for bankruptcy in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Wow. I mean, Pelosi, you know, Pelosi held out a major city</p>
<p>filing for maybe 15, maybe 15 years. But yeah, 10, 15 years.</p>
<p>Remember, a big part of what Pelosi held out on the big</p>
<p>thing she held out on in the stimulus negotiations last</p>
<p>month, was for local and state governments to get bailout</p>
<p>support in this stimulus package. And she&rsquo;s acutely</p>
<p>aware she lives one block away from me down the road here.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s acutely aware of what&rsquo;s going on in San Francisco. And</p>
<p>the solution may not be to bail out these cities and these</p>
<p>states, if they&rsquo;re going to continue to operate the way they</p>
<p>are, because it&rsquo;s, it needs to break in order to rebuild.</p>
<p>Well, you need to cut budget. I mean, any of us running a</p>
<p>business? No, like, you know, if you have a little revenue</p>
<p>coming in, and you&rsquo;re spending too much, where the fuck&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>money coming from? You can&rsquo;t just keep going to Big Papa in</p>
<p>DC and asking him for more money.</p>
<p>What about Masayoshi San? Maybe he&rsquo;ll he consider coming in and</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s back? Maybe</p>
<p>I really I&rsquo;m buying I&rsquo;m going to SPAC San Francisco.</p>
<p>Kamasi Yoshi side do the secondary and then</p>
<p>Listen, I think Chamath Chamath is right about San Francisco</p>
<p>being the proof of what happens when you have a one party</p>
<p>system. And I really hope that the the tech community, the</p>
<p>tech liberals who are listening to this podcast, they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna listen to me because they probably, you know, think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>too conservative. But, you know, Chamath is pretty liberal.</p>
<p>And, you know, he makes the right point. And, you know, we</p>
<p>cannot have a one party system that remains healthy for very</p>
<p>long. We need the pendulum to swing back towards the center.</p>
<p>And, you know, I really hope that, yeah,</p>
<p>power corrupts, absolute power corrupts. Absolutely. As you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;ve said many times, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Lord Acton said that.</p>
<p>We this is literally what the Dark Knight Batman series is</p>
<p>about. It&rsquo;s literally about not having a basic standard of</p>
<p>policing and allowing criminals to run a city. We&rsquo;ve turned</p>
<p>into a goddamn comic book. Like, you have to arrest people who</p>
<p>commit crimes. And I&rsquo;m sorry if that hurts your feelings. And</p>
<p>one of the things that beat people up. Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. And one of the things that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>comic book is the sense of fatalism. You know, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>everybody knows San Francisco is broken, but nobody thinks they</p>
<p>can do anything about it. That&rsquo;s really the tragedy of it.</p>
<p>That is the tragedy. And you know what, if any of us I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>said it before, I&rsquo;m like, I know exactly how you can stop all</p>
<p>these car break ins. You there&rsquo;s a thing called the bait car, you</p>
<p>put 10 bay cars out, you put cameras in them. And now that</p>
<p>Einstein is spoken, boys, I love you. I love you all. I miss</p>
<p>you. I can&rsquo;t wait to see again. And for those of you who&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to advertise on podcast, the advertising rate has been set at</p>
<p>$10 million a year for however many episodes we do. I will</p>
<p>read the ad at the end of the show if you give $10 million to</p>
<p>the charity of Chamath&rsquo;s picking, which apparently is</p>
<p>going to be San Francisco. I think that&rsquo;ll valid point 7% of</p>
<p>the budget. Follow Friedberg on the Twitter, follow David</p>
<p>Sachs, follow Chamath Palihapitiya. If you like the</p>
<p>show, tell your friends and write a review or don&rsquo;t we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care. We just do this because we like hanging out with each</p>
<p>other. We&rsquo;ll see you all. Oh, and if you want to be a guest</p>
<p>on the show, we don&rsquo;t accept any guest recommendations for</p>
<p>the love of God. I don&rsquo;t know how many people are begging to</p>
<p>be on the show. It&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s room enough for four people</p>
<p>maybe on a live show bestie guesties. You&rsquo;re not getting</p>
<p>your CEO of your whatever company on the show. Period. End</p>
<p>the story. And I cannot introduce you to Chamath to</p>
<p>SPAC your company enough of that. Love you besties</p>
