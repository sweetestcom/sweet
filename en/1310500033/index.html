    <p>The following is a conversation with Keoki Jackson.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the CTO of Lockheed Martin,</p>
<p>a company that through its long history</p>
<p>has created some of the most incredible engineering marvels</p>
<p>human beings have ever built,</p>
<p>including planes that fly fast and undetected,</p>
<p>defense systems that intersect nuclear threats</p>
<p>that can take the lives of millions,</p>
<p>and systems that venture out into space,</p>
<p>the moon, Mars, and beyond.</p>
<p>And these days, more and more artificial intelligence</p>
<p>has an assistive role to play in these systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read several books in preparation for this conversation.</p>
<p>It is a difficult one,</p>
<p>because in part Lockheed Martin builds military systems</p>
<p>that operate in a complicated world</p>
<p>that often does not have easy solutions</p>
<p>in the gray area between good and evil.</p>
<p>I hope one day this world will rid itself of war</p>
<p>in all its forms.</p>
<p>But the path to achieving that in a world</p>
<p>that does have evil is not obvious.</p>
<p>What is obvious is good engineering</p>
<p>and artificial intelligence research</p>
<p>has a role to play on the side of good.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin and the rest of our community</p>
<p>are hard at work at exactly this task.</p>
<p>We talk about these and other important topics</p>
<p>in this conversation.</p>
<p>Also, most certainly, both Keoki and I</p>
<p>have a passion for space,</p>
<p>us humans venturing out toward the stars.</p>
<p>We talk about this exciting future as well.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>

<p>spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Keoki Jackson.</p>
<p>I read several books on Lockheed Martin recently.</p>
<p>My favorite in particular is by Ben Rich,</p>
<p>Carlos Concord&rsquo;s personal memoir.</p>
<p>It gets a little edgy at times.</p>
<p>But from that, I was reminded that the engineers</p>
<p>at Lockheed Martin have created some of the most</p>
<p>incredible engineering marvels human beings have ever built</p>
<p>throughout the 20th century and the 21st.</p>
<p>Do you remember a particular project or system at Lockheed</p>
<p>or before that at the Space Shuttle Columbia</p>
<p>that you were just in awe at the fact that us humans</p>
<p>could create something like this?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that I could draw on there.</p>
<p>When you look at the Skunk Works and Ben Rich&rsquo;s book</p>
<p>in particular, of course, it starts off with basically</p>
<p>the start of the jet age and the P 80.</p>
<p>And I had the opportunity to sit next to one</p>
<p>of the Apollo astronauts, Charlie Duke, recently at dinner.</p>
<p>And I said, hey, what&rsquo;s your favorite aircraft?</p>
<p>And he said, well, it was by far the F 104 Starfighter,</p>
<p>which was another aircraft that came out of Lockheed there.</p>
<p>It was the first Mach 2 jet fighter aircraft.</p>
<p>They called it the missile with a man in it.</p>
<p>And so those are the kinds of things I grew up hearing</p>
<p>stories about.</p>
<p>You know, of course, the SR 71 is incomparable</p>
<p>as kind of the epitome of speed, altitude,</p>
<p>and just the coolest looking aircraft ever.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a reconnaissance, that&rsquo;s a plane.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, yeah, intelligence surveillance</p>
<p>and reconnaissance aircraft that was designed</p>
<p>to be able to outrun, basically go faster</p>
<p>than any air defense system.</p>
<p>But, you know, I&rsquo;ll tell you, I&rsquo;m a space junkie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I came to MIT.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what took me ultimately to Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>And I grew up, and so Lockheed Martin, for example,</p>
<p>has been essentially at the heart of every planetary mission,</p>
<p>like all the Mars missions we&rsquo;ve had a part in.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about the 50th anniversary</p>
<p>of Apollo here in the last couple of weeks, right?</p>
<p>But remember, 1976, July 20th, again, National Space Days,</p>
<p>the landing of the Viking lander on the surface of Mars,</p>
<p>just a huge accomplishment.</p>
<p>And when I was a young engineer at Lockheed Martin,</p>
<p>I got to meet engineers who had designed, you know,</p>
<p>various pieces of that mission as well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I grew up on is these planetary missions,</p>
<p>the start of the space shuttle era,</p>
<p>and ultimately had the opportunity</p>
<p>to see Lockheed Martin&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin&rsquo;s part, and we can maybe talk about</p>
<p>some of these here, but Lockheed Martin&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>in all of these space journeys over the years.</p>
<p>Do you dream, and I apologize for getting philosophical</p>
<p>at times, or sentimental.</p>
<p>I do romanticize the notion of space exploration.</p>
<p>So do you dream of the day when us humans colonize</p>
<p>another planet like Mars, or a man, a woman,</p>
<p>a human being steps on Mars?</p>
<p>Absolutely, and that&rsquo;s a personal dream of mine.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t given up yet on my own opportunity</p>
<p>to fly into space, but as, you know,</p>
<p>from the Lockheed Martin perspective,</p>
<p>this is something that we&rsquo;re working towards every day.</p>
<p>And of course, you know, we&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>the Orion spacecraft, which is the most sophisticated</p>
<p>human rated spacecraft ever built.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really designed for these deep space journeys,</p>
<p>you know, starting with the moon,</p>
<p>but ultimately going to Mars and being the platform,</p>
<p>you know, from a design perspective,</p>
<p>we call the Mars base camp to be able to take humans</p>
<p>to the surface, and then after a mission</p>
<p>of a couple of weeks, bring them back up safely.</p>
<p>And so that is something I want to see happen</p>
<p>during my time at Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty excited about that.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, once we prove that&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>you know, colonization might be a little bit further out,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;d hope to see.</p>
<p>So maybe you can give a little bit of an overview</p>
<p>of, so Lockheed Martin has partnered with a few years ago</p>
<p>with Boeing to work with the DOD and NASA</p>
<p>to build launch systems and rockets with the ULA.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s beyond that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Lockheed&rsquo;s mission timeline,</p>
<p>long term dream in terms of space?</p>
<p>You mentioned the moon, I&rsquo;ve heard you talk about asteroids.</p>
<p>As Mars, what&rsquo;s the timeline?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the engineering challenges</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s the dream long term?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the dream long term is to have</p>
<p>a permanent presence in space beyond low earth orbit,</p>
<p>ultimately with a long term presence on the moon</p>
<p>and then to the planets, to Mars.</p>
<p>And&hellip; Sorry to interrupt on that.</p>
<p>So long term presence means&hellip;</p>
<p>Sustained and sustainable presence in an economy,</p>
<p>a space economy that really goes alongside that.</p>
<p>With human beings and being able to launch perhaps</p>
<p>from those, so like hop?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of energy</p>
<p>that goes in those hops, right?</p>
<p>So I think the first step is being able to get there</p>
<p>and to be able to establish sustained bases, right?</p>
<p>And build from there.</p>
<p>And a lot of that means getting, as you know,</p>
<p>things like the cost of launch down</p>
<p>and you mentioned United Launch Alliance.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t wanna speak for ULA,</p>
<p>but obviously they&rsquo;re working really hard</p>
<p>to on their next generation of launch vehicles</p>
<p>to maintain that incredible mission success record</p>
<p>that ULA has, but ultimately continue</p>
<p>to drive down the cost and make the flexibility,</p>
<p>the speed and the access ever greater.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the missions that are in the horizon</p>
<p>that you could talk to?</p>
<p>Is there a hope to get to the moon?</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, I think you know this, or you may know this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to accomplish some of these goals.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a lot of what&rsquo;s in discussion today.</p>
<p>But ultimately the goal is to be able to establish a base</p>
<p>essentially in cislunar space that would allow</p>
<p>for ready transfer from orbit to the lunar surface</p>
<p>and back again.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s sort of that near term,</p>
<p>I say near term in the next decade or so vision,</p>
<p>starting off with a stated objective by this administration</p>
<p>to get back to the moon in the 2024, 2025 timeframe,</p>
<p>which is right around the corner here.</p>
<p>How big of an engineering challenge is that?</p>
<p>I think the big challenge is not so much to go,</p>
<p>but to stay, right?</p>
<p>And so we demonstrated in the 60s</p>
<p>that you could send somebody up,</p>
<p>do a couple of days of mission</p>
<p>and bring them home again successfully.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re talking about doing that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say more to, I don&rsquo;t wanna say an industrial scale,</p>
<p>but a sustained scale, right?</p>
<p>So permanent habitation, regular reuse of vehicles,</p>
<p>the infrastructure to get things like fuel, air,</p>
<p>consumables, replacement parts,</p>
<p>all the things that you need to sustain</p>
<p>that kind of infrastructure.</p>
<p>So those are certainly engineering challenges,</p>
<p>there are budgetary challenges,</p>
<p>and those are all things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna have to work through.</p>
<p>The other thing, and I shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna minimize this,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m excited about human exploration,</p>
<p>but the reality is our technology</p>
<p>and where we&rsquo;ve come over the last 40 years essentially</p>
<p>has changed what we can do with robotic exploration as well.</p>
<p>And to me, it&rsquo;s incredibly thrilling,</p>
<p>and this seems like old news now,</p>
<p>but the fact that we have rovers driving around</p>
<p>the surface of Mars and sending back data</p>
<p>is just incredible.</p>
<p>The fact that we have satellites in orbit around Mars</p>
<p>that are collecting weather,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re looking at the terrain, they&rsquo;re mapping,</p>
<p>all of these kinds of things on a continuous basis,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And the fact that you got the time lag, of course,</p>
<p>going to the planets,</p>
<p>but you can effectively have virtual human presence there</p>
<p>in a way that we have never been able to do before.</p>
<p>And now with the advent of even greater processing power,</p>
<p>better AI systems, better cognitive systems</p>
<p>and decision systems,</p>
<p>you put that together with the human piece</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve really opened up the solar system</p>
<p>in a whole different way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you an example, we&rsquo;ve got OSIRIS REx,</p>
<p>which is a mission to the asteroid Bennu.</p>
<p>So the spacecraft is out there right now</p>
<p>on basically a year mapping activity</p>
<p>to map the entire surface of that asteroid in great detail.</p>
<p>You know, all autonomously piloted, right?</p>
<p>But the idea then that, and this is not too far away,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna go in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got a sort of fancy vacuum cleaner with a bucket,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna collect the sample off the asteroid</p>
<p>and then send it back here to Earth.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we have gone from sort of those</p>
<p>tentative steps in the 70s, you know,</p>
<p>early landings, video of the solar system</p>
<p>to now we&rsquo;ve sent spacecraft to Pluto,</p>
<p>we have gone to comets and brought and intercepted comets,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve brought stardust, you know, material back.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;ve gone far</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s incredible opportunity to go even farther.</p>
<p>So it seems quite crazy that this is even possible,</p>
<p>that can you talk a little bit about</p>
<p>what it means to orbit an asteroid</p>
<p>and with a bucket to try to pick up some soil samples?</p>
<p>Yeah, so part of it is just kind of the, you know,</p>
<p>these are the same kinds of techniques we use here on Earth</p>
<p>for high speed, high accuracy imagery,</p>
<p>stitching these scenes together and creating</p>
<p>essentially high accuracy world maps, right?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing, obviously,</p>
<p>on a much smaller scale with an asteroid.</p>
<p>But the other thing that&rsquo;s really interesting,</p>
<p>you put together sort of that neat control</p>
<p>and, you know, data and imagery problem.</p>
<p>But the stories around how we designed the collection,</p>
<p>I mean, as essentially, you know,</p>
<p>this is the sort of the human ingenuity element, right?</p>
<p>That, you know, essentially had an engineer who had a,</p>
<p>one day he&rsquo;s like, oh, starts messing around with parts,</p>
<p>vacuum cleaner, bucket, you know,</p>
<p>maybe we could do something like this.</p>
<p>And that was what led to what we call</p>
<p>the pogo stick collection, right?</p>
<p>Where basically a thing comes down,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only there for seconds, does that collection,</p>
<p>grabs the, essentially blows the regolith material</p>
<p>into the collection hopper and off it goes.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really land almost.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very short landing.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>So what is, in those, we talked a little bit more</p>
<p>about space, what&rsquo;s the role of the human in all of this?</p>
<p>What are the challenges?</p>
<p>What are the opportunities for humans</p>
<p>as they pilot these vehicles in space?</p>
<p>And for humans that may step foot</p>
<p>on either the moon or Mars?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great question because, you know,</p>
<p>I just have been extolling the virtues of robotic</p>
<p>and, you know, rovers, autonomous systems,</p>
<p>and those absolutely have a role.</p>
<p>I think the thing that we don&rsquo;t know how to replace today</p>
<p>is the ability to adapt on the fly to new information.</p>
<p>And I believe that will come, but we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ways to go.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you think back to Apollo 13</p>
<p>and the ingenuity of the folks on the ground</p>
<p>and on the spacecraft essentially cobbled together</p>
<p>a way to get the carbon dioxide scrubbers to work.</p>
<p>Those are the kinds of things that ultimately, you know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d say not just from dealing with anomalies,</p>
<p>but, you know, dealing with new information.</p>
<p>You see something and rather than waiting</p>
<p>20 minutes or half an hour, an hour</p>
<p>to try to get information back and forth,</p>
<p>but be able to essentially revector on the fly,</p>
<p>collect, you know, different samples,</p>
<p>take a different approach,</p>
<p>choose different areas to explore.</p>
<p>Those are the kinds of things that human presence enables</p>
<p>that is still a ways ahead of us on the AI side.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some interesting stuff</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about on the teaming side here on Earth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty cool to explore.</p>
<p>And in space, let&rsquo;s not leave the space piece out.</p>
<p>So what does teaming, what does AI and humans</p>
<p>working together in space look like?</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the things we&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>is a system called Maya, which is,</p>
<p>you think of it, so it&rsquo;s an AI assistant.</p>
<p>In space. In space, exactly.</p>
<p>And you think of it as the Alexa in space, right?</p>
<p>But this goes hand in hand with a lot of other developments.</p>
<p>And so today&rsquo;s world, everything is essentially model based,</p>
<p>model based systems engineering</p>
<p>to the actual digital tapestry that goes through the design,</p>
<p>the build, the manufacture, the testing,</p>
<p>and ultimately the sustainment of these system.</p>
<p>And so our vision is really that, you know,</p>
<p>when our astronauts are there around Mars,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have that entire digital library</p>
<p>of the spacecraft, of its operations, all the test data,</p>
<p>all the test data and flight data from previous missions</p>
<p>to be able to look and see if there are anomalous conditions</p>
<p>and tell the humans and potentially deal with that</p>
<p>before it becomes a bad situation</p>
<p>and help the astronauts work through those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just, you know,</p>
<p>dealing with problems as they come up,</p>
<p>but also offering up opportunities</p>
<p>for additional exploration capability, for example.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the vision is that, you know,</p>
<p>these are gonna take the best of the human</p>
<p>to respond to changing circumstances</p>
<p>and rely on the best of AI capabilities</p>
<p>to monitor these, you know,</p>
<p>this almost infinite number of data points</p>
<p>and correlations of data points</p>
<p>that humans frankly aren&rsquo;t that good at.</p>
<p>So how do you develop systems in space like this,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Alexa in space or in general,</p>
<p>any kind of control systems,</p>
<p>any kind of intelligent systems</p>
<p>when you can&rsquo;t really test stuff too much out in space?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very expensive to test stuff.</p>
<p>So how do you develop such systems?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the beauty of this digital twin, if you will.</p>
<p>And of course, with Lockheed Martin,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve over the past, you know, five plus decades</p>
<p>been refining our knowledge of the space environment,</p>
<p>of how materials behave, dynamics,</p>
<p>the controls, the radiation environments,</p>
<p>all of these kinds of things.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re able to create very sophisticated models.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not perfect, but they&rsquo;re very good.</p>
<p>And so you can actually do a lot.</p>
<p>I spent part of my career, you know,</p>
<p>simulating communication spacecraft,</p>
<p>you know, missile warning spacecraft, GPS spacecraft</p>
<p>in all kinds of scenarios and all kinds of environments.</p>
<p>So this is really just taking that to the next level.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bringing into that loop</p>
<p>a system depending on how it&rsquo;s developed</p>
<p>that may be non deterministic,</p>
<p>it may be learning as it goes.</p>
<p>And in fact, we anticipate</p>
<p>that it will be learning as it goes.</p>
<p>And so that brings a whole new level of interest,</p>
<p>I guess, into how do you do verification and validation</p>
<p>of these non deterministic learning systems</p>
<p>in scenarios that may go out of the bounds</p>
<p>or the envelope that you have initially designed them to.</p>
<p>So had this system and its intelligence</p>
<p>has the same complexity,</p>
<p>some of the same complexity human does</p>
<p>and learns over time, it&rsquo;s unpredictable</p>
<p>in certain kinds of ways in the,</p>
<p>so you still, you also have to model that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re thinking about it.</p>
<p>So in your thoughts, it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to model the majority of situations,</p>
<p>the important aspects of situations here on earth</p>
<p>and in space enough to test stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is really an active area of research</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re actually funding university research</p>
<p>in a variety of places, including MIT.</p>
<p>This is in the realm of trust and verification</p>
<p>and validation of I&rsquo;d say autonomous systems in general</p>
<p>and then as a subset of that autonomous systems</p>
<p>that incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities.</p>
<p>And this is not an easy problem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working with startup companies,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got internal R&amp;D, but our conviction is</p>
<p>that autonomy and more and more AI enabled autonomy</p>
<p>is gonna be in everything that Lockheed Martin develops</p>
<p>and fields and it&rsquo;s gonna be retrofitting it.</p>
<p>Autonomy and AI are gonna be retrofit</p>
<p>into existing systems, they&rsquo;re gonna be part</p>
<p>of the design for all of our future systems.</p>
<p>And so maybe I should take a step back</p>
<p>and say the way we define autonomy.</p>
<p>So we talk about autonomy essentially a system</p>
<p>that composes, selects and then executes decisions</p>
<p>with varying levels of human intervention.</p>
<p>And so you could think of no autonomy.</p>
<p>So this is essentially the human doing the task.</p>
<p>You can think of effectively partial autonomy</p>
<p>where the human is in the loop.</p>
<p>So making decisions in every case</p>
<p>about what the autonomous system can do.</p>
<p>Either in the cockpit or remotely.</p>
<p>Or remotely, exactly, but still in that control loop.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d call supervisory autonomy.</p>
<p>So the autonomous system is doing most of the work,</p>
<p>the human can intervene to stop it</p>
<p>or to change the direction.</p>
<p>And then ultimately full autonomy</p>
<p>where the human is off the loop altogether.</p>
<p>And for different types of missions</p>
<p>wanna have different levels of autonomy.</p>
<p>So now take that spectrum and this conviction</p>
<p>that autonomy and more and more AI</p>
<p>are in everything that we develop.</p>
<p>The kinds of things that Lockheed Martin does,</p>
<p>a lot of times are safety of life critical kinds of missions.</p>
<p>You think about aircraft, for example.</p>
<p>And so we require and our customers require</p>
<p>an extremely high level of confidence.</p>
<p>One, that we&rsquo;re gonna protect life.</p>
<p>Two, that these systems will behave</p>
<p>in ways that their operators can understand.</p>
<p>And so this gets into that whole field.</p>
<p>Again, being able to verify and validate</p>
<p>that the systems have been and that they will operate</p>
<p>the way they&rsquo;re designed and the way they&rsquo;re expected.</p>
<p>And furthermore, that they will do that</p>
<p>in ways that can be explained and understood.</p>
<p>And that is an extremely difficult challenge.</p>
<p>Yeah, so here&rsquo;s a difficult question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to bring this up,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a good case study</p>
<p>that people are familiar with the Boeing 737 Max</p>
<p>commercial airplane has had two recent crashes</p>
<p>where their flight control software system failed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s software.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t mean to speak about Boeing,</p>
<p>but broadly speaking, we have this</p>
<p>in the autonomous vehicle space too, semi autonomous.</p>
<p>We have millions of lines of code software making decisions.</p>
<p>There is a little bit of a clash of cultures</p>
<p>because software engineers don&rsquo;t have the same culture</p>
<p>of safety often that people who build systems</p>
<p>like at Lockheed Martin do where it has to be</p>
<p>exceptionally safe, you have to test this on.</p>
<p>So how do we get this right when software</p>
<p>is making so many decisions?</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s a lot of things that have to happen.</p>
<p>And by and large, I think it starts with the culture,</p>
<p>which is not necessarily something that A,</p>
<p>is taught in school or B is something that would come,</p>
<p>depending on what kind of software you&rsquo;re developing,</p>
<p>it may not be relevant, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re targeting ads or something like that.</p>
<p>So, and by and large, I&rsquo;d say not just Lockheed Martin,</p>
<p>but certainly the aerospace industry as a whole</p>
<p>has developed a culture that does focus on safety,</p>
<p>safety of life, operational safety, mission success.</p>
<p>But as you note, these systems</p>
<p>have gotten incredibly complex.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re to the point where it&rsquo;s almost impossible,</p>
<p>you know, state spaces become so huge</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s impossible to, or very difficult</p>
<p>to do a systematic verification across the entire set</p>
<p>of potential ways that an aircraft could be flown,</p>
<p>all the conditions that could happen,</p>
<p>all the potential failure scenarios.</p>
<p>Now, maybe that&rsquo;s soluble one day,</p>
<p>maybe when we have our quantum computers</p>
<p>at our fingertips, we&rsquo;ll be able to actually</p>
<p>simulate across an entire, you know,</p>
<p>almost infinite state space.</p>
<p>But today, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of work</p>
<p>to really try to bound the system,</p>
<p>to make sure that it behaves in predictable ways,</p>
<p>and then have this culture of continuous inquiry</p>
<p>and skepticism and questioning to say,</p>
<p>did we really consider the right realm of possibilities?</p>
<p>Have we done the right range of testing?</p>
<p>Do we really understand, you know, in this case,</p>
<p>you know, human and machine interactions,</p>
<p>the human decision process alongside the machine processes?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s that culture,</p>
<p>we call it the culture of mission success at Lockheed Martin</p>
<p>that really needs to be established.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not something, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that people learn by living in it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that has to be promulgated, you know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s done, you know, from the highest levels</p>
<p>at a company of Lockheed Martin, like Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the same is being faced</p>
<p>at certain autonomous vehicle companies</p>
<p>where that culture is not there</p>
<p>because it started mostly by software engineers.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re struggling with.</p>
<p>Is there lessons that you think we should learn</p>
<p>as an industry and a society from the Boeing 737 MAX crashes?</p>
<p>These crashes obviously are tremendous tragedies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re tragedies for all of the people,</p>
<p>the crew, the families, the passengers,</p>
<p>the people on the ground involved.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s also a huge business</p>
<p>and economic setback as well.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, we&rsquo;ve seen that it&rsquo;s impacting</p>
<p>essentially the trade balance of the US.</p>
<p>So these are important questions.</p>
<p>And these are the kinds that, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen similar kinds of questioning at times.</p>
<p>You know, you go back to the Challenger accident.</p>
<p>And it is, I think, always important to remind ourselves</p>
<p>that humans are fallible, that the systems we create,</p>
<p>as perfect as we strive to make them,</p>
<p>we can always make them better.</p>
<p>And so another element of that culture of mission success</p>
<p>is really that commitment to continuous improvement.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something that goes wrong,</p>
<p>a real commitment to root cause</p>
<p>and true root cause understanding,</p>
<p>to taking the corrective actions</p>
<p>and to making the future systems better.</p>
<p>And certainly we strive for, you know, no accidents.</p>
<p>And if you look at the record</p>
<p>of the commercial airline industry as a whole</p>
<p>and the commercial aircraft industry as a whole,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a very nice decaying exponential</p>
<p>to years now where we have</p>
<p>no commercial aircraft accidents at all, right?</p>
<p>Fatal accidents at all.</p>
<p>So that didn&rsquo;t happen by accident.</p>
<p>It was through the regulatory agencies, FAA,</p>
<p>the airframe manufacturers really working on a system</p>
<p>to identify root causes and drive them out.</p>
<p>So maybe we can take a step back</p>
<p>and many people are familiar, but Lockheed Martin broadly,</p>
<p>what kind of categories of systems</p>
<p>are you involved in building?</p>
<p>You know, Lockheed Martin, we think of ourselves</p>
<p>as a company that solves hard mission problems.</p>
<p>And the output of that might be an airplane or a spacecraft</p>
<p>or a helicopter or a radar or something like that.</p>
<p>But ultimately we&rsquo;re driven by these, you know,</p>
<p>what is our customer?</p>
<p>What is that mission that they need to achieve?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what drove the SR71, right?</p>
<p>How do you get pictures of a place</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got sophisticated air defense systems</p>
<p>that are capable of handling any aircraft</p>
<p>that was out there at the time, right?</p>
<p>So that, you know, that&rsquo;s what yielded an SR71.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build a nice flying camera.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And make sure it gets out and it gets back, right?</p>
<p>And that led ultimately to really the start</p>
<p>of the space program in the US as well.</p>
<p>So now take a step back to Lockheed Martin of today.</p>
<p>And we are, you know, on the order of 105 years old now</p>
<p>between Lockheed and Martin, the two big heritage companies.</p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;re made up of a whole bunch</p>
<p>of other companies that came in as well.</p>
<p>General Dynamics, you know, kind of go down the list.</p>
<p>Today, you can think of us in this space</p>
<p>of solving mission problems.</p>
<p>So obviously on the aircraft side, tactical aircraft,</p>
<p>building the most advanced fighter aircraft</p>
<p>that the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re up to now several hundred of those delivered,</p>
<p>building almost a hundred a year.</p>
<p>And of course, working on the things that come after that.</p>
<p>On the space side, we are engaged</p>
<p>in pretty much every venue of space utilization</p>
<p>and exploration you can imagine.</p>
<p>So I mentioned things like navigation and timing GPS,</p>
<p>communication satellites, missile warning satellites.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve built commercial surveillance satellites.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve built commercial communication satellites.</p>
<p>We do civil space.</p>
<p>So everything from human exploration</p>
<p>to the robotic exploration of the outer planets.</p>
<p>And keep going on the space front.</p>
<p>But a couple of other areas that I&rsquo;d like to put out,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re heavily engaged in building</p>
<p>critical defensive systems.</p>
<p>And so a couple that I&rsquo;ll mention, the Aegis Combat System.</p>
<p>This is basically the integrated air and missile defense</p>
<p>system for the US and allied fleets.</p>
<p>And so protects carrier strike groups, for example,</p>
<p>from incoming ballistic missile threats,</p>
<p>aircraft threats, cruise missile threats,</p>
<p>and kind of go down the list.</p>
<p>So the carriers, the fleet itself</p>
<p>is the thing that is being protected.</p>
<p>The carriers aren&rsquo;t serving</p>
<p>as a protection for something else.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a little bit of a different application.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve actually built the version called Aegis Ashore,</p>
<p>which is now deployed in a couple of places around the world.</p>
<p>So that same technology, I mean, basically can be used</p>
<p>to protect either an ocean going fleet</p>
<p>or a land based activity.</p>
<p>Another one, the THAAD program.</p>
<p>So THAAD, this is the Theater High Altitude Area Defense.</p>
<p>This is to protect relatively broad areas</p>
<p>against sophisticated ballistic missile threats.</p>
<p>And so now it&rsquo;s deployed with a lot of US capabilities.</p>
<p>And now we have international customers</p>
<p>that are looking to buy that capability as well.</p>
<p>And so these are systems that defend,</p>
<p>not just defend militaries and military capabilities,</p>
<p>but defend population areas.</p>
<p>We saw maybe the first public use of these</p>
<p>back in the first Gulf War with the Patriot Systems.</p>
<p>And these are the kinds of things</p>
<p>that Lockheed Martin delivers.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that goes into it.</p>
<p>A lot of stuff that goes with it.</p>
<p>So think about the radar systems and the sensing systems</p>
<p>that cue these, the command and control systems</p>
<p>that decide how you pair a weapon</p>
<p>against an incoming threat.</p>
<p>And then all the human and machine interfaces</p>
<p>to make sure that they can be operated successfully</p>
<p>in very strenuous environments.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some incredible engineering</p>
<p>that at every front, like you said.</p>
<p>So maybe if we just take a look at Lockheed history broadly,</p>
<p>maybe even looking at Skunk Works.</p>
<p>What are the biggest,</p>
<p>most impressive milestones of innovation?</p>
<p>So if you look at stealth, I would have called you crazy</p>
<p>if you said that&rsquo;s possible at the time.</p>
<p>And supersonic and hypersonic.</p>
<p>So traveling at, first of all,</p>
<p>traveling at the speed of sound is pretty damn fast.</p>
<p>And supersonic and hypersonic,</p>
<p>three, four, five times the speed of sound.</p>
<p>That seems, I would also call you crazy</p>
<p>if you say you can do that.</p>
<p>So can you tell me how it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to do these kinds of things?</p>
<p>And is there other milestones and innovation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on that you can talk about?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let me start on the Skunk Works saga.</p>
<p>And you kind of alluded to it in the beginning.</p>
<p>Skunk Works is as much an idea as a place.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s driven really by Kelly Johnson&rsquo;s 14 principles.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna list all 14 of them off,</p>
<p>but the idea, and this I&rsquo;m sure will resonate</p>
<p>with any engineer who&rsquo;s worked</p>
<p>on a highly motivated small team before.</p>
<p>The idea that if you can essentially have a small team</p>
<p>of very capable people who wanna work</p>
<p>on really hard problems, you can do almost anything.</p>
<p>Especially if you kind of shield them</p>
<p>from bureaucratic influences,</p>
<p>if you create very tight relationships with your customers</p>
<p>so that you have that team</p>
<p>and shared vision with the customer.</p>
<p>Those are the kinds of things that enable the Skunk Works</p>
<p>to do these incredible things.</p>
<p>And we listed off a number that you brought up stealth.</p>
<p>And I wish I could have seen Ben Rich with a ball bearing</p>
<p>rolling it across the desk to a general officer</p>
<p>and saying, would you like to have an aircraft</p>
<p>that has the radar cross section of this ball bearing?</p>
<p>Probably one of the least expensive</p>
<p>and most effective marketing campaigns</p>
<p>in the history of the industry.</p>
<p>So just for people that are not familiar,</p>
<p>the way you detect aircraft,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of ways,</p>
<p>but radar for the longest time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big blob that appears in the radar.</p>
<p>How do you make a plane disappear</p>
<p>so it looks as big as a ball bearing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s involved in technology wise there?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the broadly sort of the stuff you can speak about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stick to what&rsquo;s in Ben Rich&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>But obviously the geometry of how radar gets reflected</p>
<p>and the kinds of materials that either reflect or absorb</p>
<p>are kind of the couple of the critical elements there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a cat and mouse game, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, radars get better,</p>
<p>stealth capabilities get better.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a really a game</p>
<p>of continuous improvement and innovation there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the idea that something is essentially invisible</p>
<p>is quite fascinating.</p>
<p>But the other one is flying fast.</p>
<p>So speed of sound is 750, 60 miles an hour.</p>
<p>So supersonic is three, you know, Mach three,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, we talk about the supersonic obviously,</p>
<p>and we kind of talk about that as that realm from Mach one</p>
<p>up through about Mach five and then hypersonic.</p>
<p>So, you know, high supersonic speeds would be past Mach five.</p>
<p>And you got to remember Lockheed Martin</p>
<p>and actually other companies have been involved</p>
<p>in hypersonic development since the late 60s.</p>
<p>You know, you think of everything from the X 15</p>
<p>to the space shuttle as examples of that.</p>
<p>I think the difference now is if you look around the world,</p>
<p>particularly the threat environment that we&rsquo;re in today,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re starting to see, you know, publicly,</p>
<p>folks like the Russians and the Chinese</p>
<p>saying they have hypersonic weapons capability</p>
<p>that could threaten US and allied capabilities.</p>
<p>And also basically, you know, the claims are</p>
<p>these could get around defensive systems</p>
<p>that are out there today.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a real sense of urgency.</p>
<p>You hear it from folks like the undersecretary of defense</p>
<p>for research and engineering, Dr. Mike Griffin,</p>
<p>and others in the department of defense that hypersonics</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s really important to the nation</p>
<p>in terms of both parity, but also defensive capabilities.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s something that, you know, we&rsquo;re pleased.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that Lockheed Martin&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>had a heritage in, we&rsquo;ve invested R and D dollars</p>
<p>on our side for many years.</p>
<p>And we have a number of things going on</p>
<p>with various US government customers in that field today</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re very excited about.</p>
<p>So I would anticipate we&rsquo;ll be hearing more about that</p>
<p>in the future from our customers.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve actually haven&rsquo;t read much about this.</p>
<p>Probably you can&rsquo;t talk about much of it at all,</p>
<p>but on the defensive side,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating problem of perception</p>
<p>of trying to detect things that are really hard to see.</p>
<p>Can you comment on how hard that problem is</p>
<p>and how hard is it to stay ahead,</p>
<p>even if we go back a few decades,</p>
<p>stay ahead of the competition?</p>
<p>Well, maybe I&rsquo;d, again, you gotta think of these</p>
<p>as ongoing capability development.</p>
<p>And so think back to the early days of missile defense.</p>
<p>So this would be in the 80s, the SDI program.</p>
<p>And in that timeframe, we proved and Lockheed Martin proved</p>
<p>that you could hit a bullet with a bullet, essentially,</p>
<p>and which is something that had never been done before</p>
<p>to take out an incoming ballistic missile.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s led to these incredible hit to kill</p>
<p>kinds of capabilities, PAC 3.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Patriot Advanced Capability Model 3</p>
<p>that Lockheed Martin builds,</p>
<p>the THAAD system that I talked about.</p>
<p>So now hypersonics, they&rsquo;re different from ballistic systems.</p>
<p>And so we gotta take the next step in defensive capability.</p>
<p>I can, I&rsquo;ll leave that there, but I can only imagine.</p>
<p>Now, let me just comment sort of as an engineer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sad to know that so much that Lockheed has done</p>
<p>in the past is classified or today,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s shrouded in secrecy.</p>
<p>It has to be by the nature of the application.</p>
<p>So like what I do, so what we do here at MIT,</p>
<p>we would like to inspire young engineers, young scientists,</p>
<p>and yet in the Lockheed case,</p>
<p>some of that engineer has to stay quiet.</p>
<p>How do you think about that?</p>
<p>How does that make you feel?</p>
<p>Is there a future where more can be shown</p>
<p>or is it just the nature of this world</p>
<p>that it has to remain secret?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I think the public can see enough of,</p>
<p>and including students who may be in grade school,</p>
<p>high school, college today,</p>
<p>to understand the kinds of really hard problems</p>
<p>that we work on.</p>
<p>And I mean, look at the F35, right?</p>
<p>And obviously a lot of the detailed performance levels</p>
<p>are sensitive and controlled.</p>
<p>But we can talk about what an incredible aircraft this is,</p>
<p>supersonic, super cruise, kind of a fighter,</p>
<p>stealth capabilities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a flying information system in the sky</p>
<p>with data fusion, sensor fusion capabilities</p>
<p>that have never been seen before.</p>
<p>So these are the kinds of things that I believe,</p>
<p>these are the kinds of things that got me excited</p>
<p>when I was a student.</p>
<p>I think these still inspire students today.</p>
<p>And the other thing I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>I mean, people are inspired by space.</p>
<p>People are inspired by aircraft.</p>
<p>Our employees are also inspired by that sense of mission.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just give you an example.</p>
<p>I had the privilege to work</p>
<p>and lead our GPS programs for some time.</p>
<p>And that was a case where I actually worked on a program</p>
<p>that touches billions of people every day.</p>
<p>And so when I said, I worked on GPS,</p>
<p>everybody knew what I was talking about,</p>
<p>even though they didn&rsquo;t maybe appreciate</p>
<p>the technical challenges that went into that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you, I got a briefing one time</p>
<p>from a major in the Air Force.</p>
<p>And he said, I go by callsign GIMP, GPS is my passion.</p>
<p>I love GPS.</p>
<p>And he was involved in the operational test of the system.</p>
<p>And he said, I was out in Iraq,</p>
<p>and I was on a helicopter, Blackhawk helicopter,</p>
<p>and I was bringing back a sergeant</p>
<p>and a handful of troops from a deployed location.</p>
<p>And he said, my job is GPS.</p>
<p>So I asked that sergeant,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s beaten down and kind of half asleep.</p>
<p>And I said, what do you think about GPS?</p>
<p>And he brightened up, his eyes lit up,</p>
<p>and he said, well, GPS,</p>
<p>that brings me and my troops home every day.</p>
<p>I love GPS.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of story where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m really making a difference here</p>
<p>in the kind of work.</p>
<p>So that mission piece is really important.</p>
<p>The last thing I&rsquo;ll say is,</p>
<p>and this gets to some of these questions</p>
<p>around advanced technologies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, they&rsquo;re not just airplanes</p>
<p>and spacecraft anymore.</p>
<p>For people who are excited</p>
<p>about advanced software capabilities,</p>
<p>about AI, about bringing machine learning,</p>
<p>these are the things that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>to exponentially increase the mission capabilities</p>
<p>that go on those platforms.</p>
<p>And those are the kinds of things</p>
<p>that I think are more and more visible to the public.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think autonomy, especially in flight,</p>
<p>is super exciting.</p>
<p>Do you see a day, here we go, back into philosophy,</p>
<p>future when most fighter jets</p>
<p>will be highly autonomous to a degree</p>
<p>where a human doesn&rsquo;t need to be in the cockpit</p>
<p>in almost all cases?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, that&rsquo;s a world</p>
<p>that to a certain extent we&rsquo;re in today.</p>
<p>Now these are remotely piloted aircraft, to be sure.</p>
<p>But we have hundreds of thousands of flight hours a year now</p>
<p>in remotely piloted aircraft.</p>
<p>And then if you take the F35,</p>
<p>there are huge layers, I guess,</p>
<p>in levels of autonomy built into that aircraft</p>
<p>so that the pilot is essentially more of a mission manager</p>
<p>rather than doing the data,</p>
<p>the second to second elements of flying the aircraft.</p>
<p>So in some ways it&rsquo;s the easiest aircraft</p>
<p>in the world to fly.</p>
<p>And kind of a funny story on that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you know</p>
<p>how aircraft carrier landings work,</p>
<p>but basically there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called a tail hook</p>
<p>and it catches wires on the deck of the carrier.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what brings the aircraft</p>
<p>to a screeching halt, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s typically three of these wires.</p>
<p>So if you miss the first, the second one,</p>
<p>you catch the next one, right?</p>
<p>And we got a little criticism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how true this story is,</p>
<p>but we got a little criticism.</p>
<p>The F35 is so perfect, it always gets the second wires.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re wearing out the wire because it always hits that one.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the kind of autonomy that just makes these,</p>
<p>essentially up levels what the human is doing</p>
<p>to more of that mission manager.</p>
<p>So much of that landing by the F35 is autonomous.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just, the control systems are such</p>
<p>that you really have dialed out the variability</p>
<p>that comes with all the environmental conditions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wearing it out.</p>
<p>So my point is to a certain extent,</p>
<p>that world is here today.</p>
<p>Do I think that we&rsquo;re gonna see a day anytime soon</p>
<p>when there are no humans in the cockpit?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that.</p>
<p>But I do think we&rsquo;re gonna see much more</p>
<p>human machine teaming, and we&rsquo;re gonna see that much more</p>
<p>at the tactical edge.</p>
<p>And we did a demo, and you asked about</p>
<p>what the Skunk Works is doing these days.</p>
<p>And so this is something I can talk about,</p>
<p>but we did a demo with the Air Force Research Laboratory.</p>
<p>We called it Have Raider.</p>
<p>And so using an F16 as an autonomous wingman,</p>
<p>and we demonstrated all kinds of maneuvers</p>
<p>and various mission scenarios with the autonomous F16</p>
<p>being that so called loyal or trusted wingman.</p>
<p>And so those are the kinds of things that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve shown what is possible now.</p>
<p>Given that you&rsquo;ve up leveled that pilot</p>
<p>to be a mission manager, now they can control</p>
<p>multiple other aircraft.</p>
<p>Think of them almost as extensions of your own aircraft</p>
<p>flying alongside with you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another example of how this is really</p>
<p>coming to fruition.</p>
<p>And then I mentioned the landings,</p>
<p>but think about just the implications for humans</p>
<p>and flight safety, and this goes a little bit back</p>
<p>to the discussion we were having about</p>
<p>how do you continuously improve the level of safety</p>
<p>through automation while working through the complexities</p>
<p>that automation introduces.</p>
<p>So one of the challenges that you have</p>
<p>in high performance fighter aircraft is what&rsquo;s called G lock.</p>
<p>So this is G induced loss of consciousness.</p>
<p>So you pull nine Gs, you&rsquo;re wearing a pressure suit,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not enough to keep the blood going to your brain,</p>
<p>you black out.</p>
<p>And of course that&rsquo;s bad if you happen to be flying low,</p>
<p>near the deck and in an obstacle or terrain environment.</p>
<p>And so we developed a system in our aeronautics division</p>
<p>called Auto Gcast, so autonomous ground collision</p>
<p>avoidance system.</p>
<p>And we built that into the F16.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually saved seven aircraft, eight pilots already</p>
<p>in a relatively short time it&rsquo;s been deployed.</p>
<p>It was so successful that the Air Force said,</p>
<p>hey, we need to have this in the F35 right away.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve actually done testing of that now on the F35.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve also integrated an autonomous</p>
<p>air collision avoidance system.</p>
<p>So think the air to air problem.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s the integrated collision avoidance system.</p>
<p>But these are the kinds of capabilities,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call them AI.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re very sophisticated models</p>
<p>of the aircraft dynamics coupled with the terrain models</p>
<p>to be able to predict when essentially the pilot</p>
<p>is doing something that is gonna take the aircraft</p>
<p>or the pilot&rsquo;s not doing something in this case.</p>
<p>But it just gives you an example of how autonomy</p>
<p>can be really a lifesaver in today&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a autonomous automated emergency braking in cars.</p>
<p>But is there any exploration of perception of,</p>
<p>for example, detecting a G lock that the pilot is out?</p>
<p>So as opposed to perceiving the external environment</p>
<p>to infer that the pilot is out,</p>
<p>but actually perceiving the pilot directly.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is one of those cases</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;d like to not take action</p>
<p>if you think the pilot&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like systems that try to detect</p>
<p>if a driver&rsquo;s falling asleep on the road, right?</p>
<p>With limited success.</p>
<p>So, I mean, this is what I call</p>
<p>the system of last resort, right?</p>
<p>Where if the aircraft has determined</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going into the terrain, get it out of there.</p>
<p>And this is not something that we&rsquo;re just doing</p>
<p>in the aircraft world.</p>
<p>And I wanted to highlight,</p>
<p>we have a technology we call Matrix,</p>
<p>but this is developed at Sikorsky Innovations.</p>
<p>The whole idea there is what we call optimal piloting.</p>
<p>So not optional piloting or unpiloted, but optimal piloting.</p>
<p>So an FAA certified system.</p>
<p>So you have a high degree of confidence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally pretty deterministic.</p>
<p>So we know that it&rsquo;ll do in different situations,</p>
<p>but effectively be able to fly a mission</p>
<p>with two pilots, one pilot, no pilots.</p>
<p>And you can think of it almost as like a dial</p>
<p>of the level of autonomy that you want,</p>
<p>but able, so it&rsquo;s running in the background at all times</p>
<p>and able to pick up tasks,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s sort of autopilot kinds of tasks</p>
<p>or more sophisticated path planning kinds of activities</p>
<p>to be able to do things like, for example,</p>
<p>land on an oil rig in the North Sea</p>
<p>in bad weather, zero, zero conditions.</p>
<p>And you can imagine, of course,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of military utility to capability like that.</p>
<p>You could have an aircraft that you want to send out</p>
<p>for a crewed mission, but then at night,</p>
<p>if you want to use it to deliver supplies</p>
<p>in an unmanned mode, that could be done as well.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s clear advantages there.</p>
<p>But think about on the commercial side,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an aircraft taken,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna fly out to this oil rig.</p>
<p>If you get out there and you can&rsquo;t land,</p>
<p>then you gotta bring all those people back,</p>
<p>reschedule another flight,</p>
<p>pay the overtime for the crew that you just brought back</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t get where they were going,</p>
<p>pay for the overtime for the folks</p>
<p>that are out there in the oil rig.</p>
<p>This is real economic,</p>
<p>these are dollars and cents kinds of advantages</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bringing in the commercial world as well.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a difficult question from the AI space</p>
<p>that I would love it if you&rsquo;re able to comment.</p>
<p>So a lot of this autonomy in AI you&rsquo;ve mentioned just now</p>
<p>has this empowering effect.</p>
<p>One is the last resort, it keeps you safe.</p>
<p>The other is there&rsquo;s a, with the teaming</p>
<p>and in general, assistive AI.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s always a race.</p>
<p>So the world is full of, the world is complex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of bad actors.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s often a race to make sure</p>
<p>that we keep this country safe, right?</p>
<p>But with AI, there is a concern</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a slightly different race.</p>
<p>Though there&rsquo;s a lot of people in the AI space</p>
<p>that are concerned about the AI arms race.</p>
<p>That as opposed to the United States becoming,</p>
<p>having the best technology and therefore keeping us safe,</p>
<p>even we lose ability to keep control of it.</p>
<p>So this, the AI arms race getting away</p>
<p>from all of us humans.</p>
<p>So do you share this worry?</p>
<p>Do you share this concern</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about military applications</p>
<p>that too much control and decision making capabilities</p>
<p>giving to software or AI?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t see it happening today.</p>
<p>And in fact, this is something from a policy perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously a very dynamic space,</p>
<p>but the Department of Defense has put quite a bit</p>
<p>of thought into that.</p>
<p>And maybe before talking about the policy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just talk about some of the why.</p>
<p>And you alluded to it being a sort of a complicated</p>
<p>and a little bit scary world out there,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some big things happening today.</p>
<p>You hear a lot of talk now about a return</p>
<p>to great powers competition,</p>
<p>particularly around China and Russia with the US,</p>
<p>but there are some other big players out there as well.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;ve seen is the deployment of some very,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say concerning new weapon systems,</p>
<p>particularly with Russia and breaching</p>
<p>some of the IRBM,</p>
<p>Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile Treaties,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been in the news a lot.</p>
<p>The building of islands, artificial islands</p>
<p>in the South China Sea by the Chinese</p>
<p>and then arming those islands.</p>
<p>The annexation of Crimea by Russia,</p>
<p>the invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some pretty scary things.</p>
<p>And then you add on top of that,</p>
<p>the North Korean threat has certainly not gone away.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot going on in the Middle East</p>
<p>with Iran in particular.</p>
<p>And we see this global terrorism threat has not abated.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of reasons to look for technology</p>
<p>to assist with those problems,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s AI or other technologies like hypersonics,</p>
<p>which we discussed.</p>
<p>So now let me give just a couple of hypotheticals.</p>
<p>So people react sort of in the second timeframe, right?</p>
<p>Photon hitting your eye to movement</p>
<p>is on the order of a few tenths of a second</p>
<p>kinds of processing time.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking,</p>
<p>computers are operating in the nanosecond timescale, right?</p>
<p>So just to bring home what that means,</p>
<p>a nanosecond to a second is like a second to 32 years.</p>
<p>So seconds on the battlefield,</p>
<p>in that sense, literally are lifetimes.</p>
<p>And so if you can bring an autonomous</p>
<p>or AI enabled capability</p>
<p>that will enable the human to shrink,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ve heard the term the OODA loop.</p>
<p>So this whole idea that a typical battlefield decision</p>
<p>is characterized by observe.</p>
<p>So information comes in, orient.</p>
<p>How does that, what does that mean in the context?</p>
<p>Decide, what do I do about it?</p>
<p>And then act, take that action.</p>
<p>If you can use these capabilities to compress that OODA loop</p>
<p>to stay inside what your adversary is doing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an incredible powerful force on the battlefield.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really nice way to put it,</p>
<p>that the role of AI and computing in general</p>
<p>has a lot to benefit from just decreasing</p>
<p>from 32 years to one second,</p>
<p>as opposed to on the scale of seconds and minutes and hours</p>
<p>making decisions that humans are better at making.</p>
<p>And it actually goes the other way too.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s on the short timescale.</p>
<p>So humans kind of work in the one second,</p>
<p>two seconds to eight hours.</p>
<p>After eight hours, you get tired,</p>
<p>you gotta go to the bathroom, whatever the case might be.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this whole range of other things.</p>
<p>Think about surveillance and guarding facilities.</p>
<p>Think about moving material, logistics, sustainment.</p>
<p>A lot of these, what they call dull, dirty</p>
<p>and dangerous things that you need</p>
<p>to have sustained activity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of beyond the length of time</p>
<p>that a human can practically do as well.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this range of things that are critical</p>
<p>in military and defense applications</p>
<p>that AI and autonomy are particularly well suited to.</p>
<p>Now, the interesting question that you brought up is,</p>
<p>okay, how do you make sure that stays within human control?</p>
<p>So that was the context for now the policy.</p>
<p>And so there is a DOD directive called 3000.09</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the way we name stuff in this world.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s well worth reading.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a couple of pages long,</p>
<p>but it makes some key points.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really around making sure</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s human agency and control</p>
<p>over use of semi autonomous and autonomous weapons systems,</p>
<p>making sure that these systems are tested,</p>
<p>verified and evaluated in realistic,</p>
<p>real world type scenarios,</p>
<p>making sure that the people are actually trained</p>
<p>on how to use them,</p>
<p>making sure that the systems have human machine interfaces</p>
<p>that can show what state they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>and what kinds of decisions they&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>making sure that you&rsquo;ve established doctrine</p>
<p>and tactics and techniques and procedures</p>
<p>for the use of these kinds of systems.</p>
<p>And so, and by the way, I mean, none of this is easy,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just trying to lay kind of the picture</p>
<p>of how the US has said,</p>
<p>this is the way we&rsquo;re gonna treat AI and autonomous systems,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not a free for all.</p>
<p>And like there are rules of war and rules of engagement</p>
<p>with other kinds of systems,</p>
<p>think chemical weapons, biological weapons,</p>
<p>we need to think about the same sorts of implications.</p>
<p>And this is something that&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>for Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously we are a hundred percent complying</p>
<p>with our customer and the policies and regulations,</p>
<p>but I mean, AI is an incredible enabler,</p>
<p>say within the walls of Lockheed Martin</p>
<p>in terms of improving production efficiency,</p>
<p>doing helping engineers, doing generative design,</p>
<p>improving logistics, driving down energy costs.</p>
<p>I mean, there are so many applications,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also very interested in some of the elements</p>
<p>of ethical application within Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>So we need to make sure that things like privacy</p>
<p>is taken care of, that we do everything we can</p>
<p>to drive out bias in AI enabled kinds of systems,</p>
<p>that we make sure that humans are involved in decisions,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not just delegating accountability to algorithms.</p>
<p>And so for us, it all comes back,</p>
<p>I talked about culture before,</p>
<p>and it comes back to sort of the Lockheed Martin culture</p>
<p>and our core values.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s pretty simple for us and do what&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>respect others, perform with excellence.</p>
<p>And now how do we tie that back to the ethical principles</p>
<p>will govern how AI is used within Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>And we actually have a world, pretty,</p>
<p>so you might not know this,</p>
<p>but there are actually awards for ethics programs.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin&rsquo;s had a recognized ethics program</p>
<p>for many years.</p>
<p>And this is one of the things that our ethics team</p>
<p>is working with our engineering team on.</p>
<p>One of the miracles to me, perhaps a layman,</p>
<p>again, I was born in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So I have echoes, at least in my family history</p>
<p>of World War II and the Cold War.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of why human civilization</p>
<p>has not destroyed itself through nuclear war,</p>
<p>so nuclear deterrence?</p>
<p>And thinking about the future,</p>
<p>does this technology have a role to play here?</p>
<p>And what is the long term future</p>
<p>of nuclear deterrence look like?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is one of those hard, hard questions.</p>
<p>And I should note that Lockheed Martin is both proud</p>
<p>and privileged to play a part in multiple legs</p>
<p>of our nuclear and strategic deterrent systems</p>
<p>like the Trident submarine launch ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>You talk about, is there still a possibility</p>
<p>that the human race could destroy itself?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that possibility is real.</p>
<p>But interestingly, in some sense,</p>
<p>I think the strategic deterrence have prevented</p>
<p>the kinds of incredibly destructive world wars</p>
<p>that we saw in the first half of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Now, things have gotten more complicated since that time</p>
<p>and since the Cold War.</p>
<p>It is more of a multipolar great powers world today.</p>
<p>Just to give you an example, back then,</p>
<p>there were, in the Cold War timeframe,</p>
<p>just a handful of nations</p>
<p>that had ballistic missile capability by last count.</p>
<p>And this is a few years old.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s over 70 nations today that have that.</p>
<p>Similar kinds of numbers</p>
<p>in terms of space based capabilities.</p>
<p>So the world has gotten more complex and more challenging</p>
<p>and the threats, I think, have proliferated</p>
<p>in ways that we didn&rsquo;t expect.</p>
<p>The nation today is in the middle of a recapitalization</p>
<p>of our strategic deterrent.</p>
<p>I look at that as one of the most important things</p>
<p>that our nation can do.</p>
<p>What is involved in deterrence?</p>
<p>Is it being ready to attack</p>
<p>or is it the defensive systems that catch attacks?</p>
<p>A little bit of both.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a complicated game theoretical kind of program.</p>
<p>But ultimately,</p>
<p>we are trying to prevent the use of any of these weapons.</p>
<p>And the theory behind prevention is that</p>
<p>even if an adversary uses a weapon against you,</p>
<p>you have the capability to essentially strike back</p>
<p>and do harm to them that&rsquo;s unacceptable.</p>
<p>And so that will deter them from making use</p>
<p>of these weapons systems.</p>
<p>The deterrence calculus has changed, of course,</p>
<p>with more nations now having these kinds of weapons.</p>
<p>But I think from my perspective, it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>to maintain a strategic deterrent.</p>
<p>You have to have systems that you know will work</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re required to work.</p>
<p>Now you know that they have to be adaptable</p>
<p>to a variety of different scenarios in today&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what this recapitalization of systems</p>
<p>that were built over previous decades,</p>
<p>making sure that they are appropriate, not just for today,</p>
<p>but for the decades to come.</p>
<p>So the other thing I&rsquo;d really like to note</p>
<p>is strategic deterrence has a very different</p>
<p>character today.</p>
<p>We used to think of weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p>in terms of nuclear, chemical, biological.</p>
<p>And today we have a cyber threat.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen examples of the use of cyber weaponry.</p>
<p>And if you think about the possibilities</p>
<p>of using cyber capabilities or an adversary attacking the US</p>
<p>to take out things like critical infrastructure,</p>
<p>electrical grids, water systems,</p>
<p>those are scenarios that are strategic in nature</p>
<p>to the survival of a nation as well.</p>
<p>So that is the kind of world that we live in today.</p>
<p>And part of my hope on this is one that we can also develop</p>
<p>technical or technological systems,</p>
<p>perhaps enabled by AI and autonomy,</p>
<p>that will allow us to contain and to fight back</p>
<p>against these kinds of new threats</p>
<p>that were not conceived when we first developed</p>
<p>our strategic deterrence.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know that Lockheed is involved in cyber,</p>
<p>so I saw that you mentioned that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredibly, nuclear almost seems easier than cyber</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many attack,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many ways that cyber can evolve</p>
<p>in such an uncertain future.</p>
<p>But talking about engineering with a mission,</p>
<p>I mean, in this case that you&rsquo;re engineering systems</p>
<p>that basically save the world.</p>
<p>Well, like I said, we&rsquo;re privileged to work</p>
<p>on some very challenging problems</p>
<p>for very critical customers here in the US</p>
<p>and with our allies abroad as well.</p>
<p>Lockheed builds both military and nonmilitary systems.</p>
<p>And perhaps the future of Lockheed</p>
<p>may be more in nonmilitary applications</p>
<p>if you talk about space and beyond.</p>
<p>I say that as a preface to a difficult question.</p>
<p>So President Eisenhower in 1961 in his farewell address</p>
<p>talked about the military industrial complex</p>
<p>and that it shouldn&rsquo;t grow beyond what is needed.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts on those words,</p>
<p>on the military industrial complex,</p>
<p>on the concern of growth of their developments</p>
<p>beyond what may be needed?</p>
<p>That where it may be needed is a critical phrase, of course.</p>
<p>And I think it is worth pointing out, as you noted,</p>
<p>that Lockheed Martin,</p>
<p>we are in a number of commercial businesses</p>
<p>from energy to space to commercial aircraft.</p>
<p>And so I wouldn&rsquo;t neglect the importance</p>
<p>of those parts of our business as well.</p>
<p>I think the world is dynamic and there was a time,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t seem that long ago to me,</p>
<p>it was while I was a graduate student here at MIT</p>
<p>and we were talking about the peace dividend</p>
<p>at the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>If you look at expenditure on military systems</p>
<p>as a fraction of GDP,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re far below peak levels of the past.</p>
<p>And to me, at least, it looks like a time</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re seeing global threats changing in a way</p>
<p>that would warrant relevant investments</p>
<p>in defensive capabilities.</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;d note,</p>
<p>for military and defensive systems,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not quite a free market, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t sell to people on the street.</p>
<p>And that warrants a very close partnership</p>
<p>between, I&rsquo;d say, the customers and the people</p>
<p>that design, build, and maintain these systems</p>
<p>because of the very unique nature,</p>
<p>the very difficult requirements,</p>
<p>the very great importance on safety</p>
<p>and on operating the way they&rsquo;re intended every time.</p>
<p>And so that does create,</p>
<p>and frankly, it&rsquo;s one of Lockheed Martin&rsquo;s great strengths</p>
<p>is that we have this expertise built up over many years</p>
<p>in partnership with our customers</p>
<p>to be able to design and build these systems</p>
<p>that meet these very unique mission needs.</p>
<p>Yeah, because building those systems is very costly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very little room for mistake.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, yeah, just Ben Rich&rsquo;s book and so on</p>
<p>just tells the story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nerve wracking just reading it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an engineer, it reads like a thriller.</p>
<p>Okay, let me, let&rsquo;s go back to space for a second.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always happy to go back to space.</p>
<p>So a few quick, maybe out there,</p>
<p>maybe fun questions, maybe a little provocative.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the efforts</p>
<p>of the new folks, SpaceX and Elon Musk?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about what Elon is doing?</p>
<p>Do you see him as competition?</p>
<p>Do you enjoy competition?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Yeah, first of all, certainly Elon,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say SpaceX and some of his other ventures</p>
<p>are definitely a competitive force in the space industry.</p>
<p>And do we like competition?</p>
<p>Yeah, we do.</p>
<p>And we think we&rsquo;re very strong competitors.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, you know, competition is what the US</p>
<p>is founded on in a lot of ways</p>
<p>and always coming up with a better way.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>to continue to have fresh eyes coming in, new innovation.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s important to have level playing fields.</p>
<p>And so you wanna make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not giving different requirements</p>
<p>to different players.</p>
<p>But, you know, I tell people, you know,</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time at places like MIT.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be at the MIT Beaverwork Summer Institute</p>
<p>over the weekend here.</p>
<p>And I tell people, this is the most exciting time</p>
<p>to be in the space business in my entire life.</p>
<p>And it is this explosion of new capabilities</p>
<p>that have been driven by things like the, you know,</p>
<p>the massive increase in computing power,</p>
<p>things like the massive increase in comms capabilities,</p>
<p>advanced and additive manufacturing</p>
<p>are really bringing down the barriers to entry in this field</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s driving just incredible innovation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s happening at startups,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also happening at Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>You may not realize this, but Lockheed Martin,</p>
<p>working with Stanford actually built the first CubeSat</p>
<p>that was launched here out of the US</p>
<p>that was called QuakeSat.</p>
<p>And we did that with Stellar Solutions.</p>
<p>This was right around just after 2000, I guess.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve been in that, you know,</p>
<p>from the very beginning.</p>
<p>And, you know, I talked about some of these,</p>
<p>like, you know, Maya and Orion,</p>
<p>but, you know, we&rsquo;re in the middle of what we call smartsats</p>
<p>and software defined satellites</p>
<p>that can essentially restructure and remap their purpose,</p>
<p>their mission on orbit to give you almost, you know,</p>
<p>unlimited flexibility for these satellites</p>
<p>over their lifetimes.</p>
<p>So those are just a couple of examples,</p>
<p>but yeah, this is a great time to be in space.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So Wright Brothers flew for the first time 116 years ago.</p>
<p>So now we have supersonic stealth planes</p>
<p>and all the technology we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>What innovations, obviously you can&rsquo;t predict the future,</p>
<p>but do you see Lockheed in the next 100 years?</p>
<p>If you take that same leap,</p>
<p>how will the world of technology and engineering change?</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s an impossible question,</p>
<p>but nobody could have predicted</p>
<p>that we could even fly 120 years ago.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the edge of possibility</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to be exploring in the next 100 years?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that there is an edge.</p>
<p>I, you know, we&rsquo;ve been around</p>
<p>for almost that entire time, right?</p>
<p>The Lockheed brothers and Glen L. Martin</p>
<p>starting their companies in the basement of a church</p>
<p>and an old service station.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very different companies today</p>
<p>than we were back then, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;ve continuously reinvented ourselves</p>
<p>over all of those decades.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say, I know this for sure,</p>
<p>the world of the future, it&rsquo;s gonna move faster,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be more connected,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be more autonomous,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be more complex than it is today.</p>
<p>And so this is the world, you know,</p>
<p>as a CTO at Lockheed Martin that I think about,</p>
<p>what are the technologies that we have to invest in?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s things like AI and autonomy,</p>
<p>you know, you can think about quantum computing,</p>
<p>which is an area that we&rsquo;ve invested in</p>
<p>to try to stay ahead of these technological changes,</p>
<p>and frankly, some of the threats that are out there.</p>
<p>I believe that we&rsquo;re gonna be out there in the solar system,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna be defending and defending well</p>
<p>against probably, you know, military threats</p>
<p>that nobody has even thought about today.</p>
<p>We are going to be, we&rsquo;re gonna use these capabilities</p>
<p>to have far greater knowledge of our own planet,</p>
<p>the depths of the oceans, you know,</p>
<p>all the way to the upper reaches of the atmosphere</p>
<p>and everything out to the sun</p>
<p>and to the edge of the solar system.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I look forward to,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m excited, I mean, just looking ahead</p>
<p>in the next decade or so to the steps</p>
<p>that I see ahead of us in that time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better place to end,</p>
<p>Keoki, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Lex, it&rsquo;s been a real pleasure,</p>
<p>and sorry it took so long to get up here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m glad we were able to make it happen.</p>
