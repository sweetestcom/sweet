What&amp;rsquo;s up?
How are you?
Good to see you.
It&amp;rsquo;s good to see you as well.

Oh man. Yeah. You guys keep getting watered water on this.'>

    <p>Brian Armstrong. What&rsquo;s up, bro?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Good to see you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to see you as well.</p>
<p>Yeah. Jason just pinged me yesterday and he was like, why don&rsquo;t you just come on as a</p>
<p>guest randomly? And I was like, okay, great. Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so good. I&rsquo;m really excited to hear what J Cal&rsquo;s intro is for you.</p>
<p>Oh man. Yeah. You guys keep getting watered water on this.</p>
<p>Hey everybody. Welcome to episode 77 of the all in podcast, less than 30 days for the</p>
<p>sold out all in summit. And, uh, there&rsquo;s a wait list, but, uh, sadly I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get to anybody on the wait list. We&rsquo;ve got a great, great episode for you.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d bring a bestie guest in, but not tell my bestie. So we&rsquo;ll see if they can</p>
<p>figure out who&rsquo;s coming on the pod today. Uh, but let&rsquo;s get the intros over with.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s investing in SAS at different stages, coming off a Miami bender for the ages,</p>
<p>doing shots with her boy and vanilla ice. The rain man is back. He&rsquo;s twice as nice.</p>
<p>David Sachs, everybody. How are you, sir? How was your adventures with vanilla ice?</p>
<p>Good. I&rsquo;m still here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still here. And so vanilla ice, uh, that costs $1,600 to get him to show up.</p>
<p>What is a vanilla ice cost to show up for a party?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about 10 K. I think it&rsquo;s about 10 to 20.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>A little bit more. Really?</p>
<p>A little more.</p>
<p>And did you go on stage and do ice ice baby with him?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, but, uh, there was some like teenage mutant ninja turtles type dancing around with him.</p>
<p>Whatever. It was interesting.</p>
<p>It was interesting.</p>
<p>People liked it. It was fun. It was fun.</p>
<p>Oh, very nice. Very nice. And you&rsquo;re still in Miami for, uh, whatever tech week. Okay.</p>
<p>So he won&rsquo;t eat your meat, but he&rsquo;ll take your MDMA. He&rsquo;s very interested in your DNA.</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;s in the lab, he&rsquo;s in heaven. He hasn&rsquo;t been the same since that rave in 1997.</p>
<p>The Lord of the Laboratory of the Sultan of Science, David Friedberg. How are you, sir?</p>
<p>That was my favorite one. I liked that one.</p>
<p>Yeah. You peaked in 97 at about 2 AM. You were peaking at about 2 AM.</p>
<p>Did you say he doesn&rsquo;t want your meat, but he wants your MDMA?</p>
<p>Yes. He won&rsquo;t eat your meat, but he&rsquo;ll take your MDMA.</p>
<p>Shout out to producer Nick who really crushed it this week.</p>
<p>Ah, his bank account. This one is too funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to keep it together for these sometimes. His bank account would make a crown prince jealous.</p>
<p>His knitwear collection is overzealous. When he&rsquo;s on CNBC, he makes a scene.</p>
<p>Last time he did leg day was 2019. The Supreme Leader of SPACs, the dictator himself,</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been actually spending a lot of time working out on my legs.</p>
<p>Really, I have been working on shoulders and chest and my legs have always been diesel.</p>
<p>I will be doing a shirt off selfie this summer.</p>
<p>Jekyll, it looks like you have not bought new shirts since you lost all the weight</p>
<p>because that shirt looks about five sides too big.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why. I bought this one halfway through the weight loss and now it&rsquo;s still too big.</p>
<p>So I got another slimmer. I got the slim fit.</p>
<p>No, I got the normal fit and then I got the slim fit.</p>
<p>From peak to now, you&rsquo;ve lost what, like 50 pounds?</p>
<p>213 pounds was my peak like four years ago and I was 167, 168 the other day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So whatever that is.</p>
<p>45 pounds? That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Something. I feel incredible. I&rsquo;ve started running again and, you know,</p>
<p>I did 40 days of skiing this year and I&rsquo;m going to take up kite surfing, I think, this summer.</p>
<p>I want another sport to do, you know, in the summers.</p>
<p>Are the people around you annoyed at your increased energy levels?</p>
<p>Yes, people who work for me are annoyed. I&rsquo;m sleeping better.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s just going better. I highly recommend everybody,</p>
<p>you know, just try to lose some weight.</p>
<p>A lot of options out there for you, including Munique.</p>
<p>All right. We have a very special bestie guestie today.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a lean, mean crypto machine who sort of looks like Mr. Clean.</p>
<p>If you need some tokens, you know who to call.</p>
<p>Satoshi has his picture hanging on his wall.</p>
<p>His NFT game is never lacking.</p>
<p>If you talk about politics at work, you might send you packing.</p>
<p>The king of coins, the tycoon of tokens.</p>
<p>Who is he?</p>
<p>Brian Armstrong.</p>
<p>Brian Armstrong.</p>
<p>Brian Armstrong.</p>
<p>You guys got it. Brian Armstrong&rsquo;s with us.</p>
<p>Hey, Brian, how are you?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up, y&rsquo;all?</p>
<p>You could have gone Vitalik at the first part, but it became Brian by the office part.</p>
<p>Anyway, welcome to the show, Brian.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve obviously talked about you a whole bunch,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been on This Week in Startups, and I think you know all the fellas here.</p>
<p>But thanks for joining the pod.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me. This is awesome. I listen to your show every week.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks for that.</p>
<p>So I guess, you know, the topic we all have talked about a whole bunch is</p>
<p>work and keeping people focused at work.</p>
<p>You took a very bold step, which Toby at Shopify, I think, followed.</p>
<p>And you said, listen, if you&rsquo;re coming to work, our mission is crypto.</p>
<p>Can we stop talking about every other thing in the world and just stay focused on that?</p>
<p>And I think that was, maybe, was that a year and a half ago?</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>You did that.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to know how that worked out for the company.</p>
<p>So maybe you could tell us what it was like to go through that,</p>
<p>because, I mean, you were a target for a period of time we all thought seems reasonable.</p>
<p>And then how has that actually impacted day-to-day life</p>
<p>for the people who decided to opt into working at a single-focused Coinbase?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I would say, you know, short term, it was quite a painful transition.</p>
<p>I think it created a lot of consternation.</p>
<p>There was, you know, some folks in the media decided to go</p>
<p>call a bunch of people who&rsquo;d left the company and,</p>
<p>you know, write hit pieces and all that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And frankly, you know, about 5% of the company opted into the exit package.</p>
<p>So there was some teams that were shorthanded.</p>
<p>A lot of people had to work extra time to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>But long term, I think it turned out to be an incredibly positive decision for the company.</p>
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s a lot of companies in Silicon Valley right now and probably elsewhere that,</p>
<p>you know, the CEOs and the management team almost feel like they&rsquo;re being held hostage by</p>
<p>employees.</p>
<p>And I feel for some of these organizations, you know,</p>
<p>Sundar probably has an incredibly difficult job right now.</p>
<p>We saw that video from Microsoft, I think, last year with Satya and it kind of was with</p>
<p>people talking about their hair color and stuff.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t feel like that they can really</p>
<p>lean in and move the company in the direction they want.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re fearful of kind of all these internal dynamics.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think there&rsquo;s probably a better way to do it than what I did,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re starting a company today, just make that clear up front.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make it clear up front.</p>
<p>And so the company culture started to diverge and drift.</p>
<p>And I had to kind of realign it, which was a painful process.</p>
<p>If I was doing it over again, I&rsquo;d probably just set that as the expectation up front,</p>
<p>and then there wouldn&rsquo;t be this, you know, public, awkward realignment.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think I&rsquo;m really glad that I did it.</p>
<p>I think Coinbase has been very productive since then.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been able to attract a lot of the best and brightest people from some of these</p>
<p>other companies that are like, I don&rsquo;t want to be in those companies anymore.</p>
<p>I want to work at a company where we just focus on the work and the mission,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s actually important.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s been positive.</p>
<p>Brian, I&rsquo;ve always talked about this as being like the difference between a hard</p>
<p>culture and a soft culture where hard cultures are companies that</p>
<p>really define what they do and what they don&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>and what they spend time on and what they don&rsquo;t spend time on.</p>
<p>And sometimes what you don&rsquo;t spend time on can relate to products.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can relate to things outside or externalities to the business.</p>
<p>Do you think that that&rsquo;s become kind of a trend where,</p>
<p>you know, soft culture in Silicon Valley is more about like appeasing</p>
<p>a very fickle employee base?</p>
<p>And as a result, you kind of aren&rsquo;t as clear about what you&rsquo;re not going to talk about and</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t going to talk about and suddenly the troops rule the day and</p>
<p>things get kind of sidetracked and productivity goes down?</p>
<p>I mean, can you talk a little bit about what you&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>with other cultures around the valley and how that&rsquo;s kind of affecting work</p>
<p>and what employees are choosing to go to and not go to?</p>
<p>Yeah. So I think Ben Horowitz always talked about like wartime CEO, peacetime CEO.</p>
<p>And frankly, I&rsquo;m kind of a conflict avoidant person.</p>
<p>I never thought of myself as like wartime CEO.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just like, we&rsquo;re all going in this direction.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go, go, go.</p>
<p>You know, I never really thought of myself like that.</p>
<p>But I think what I&rsquo;m trying to do now is find the happy medium between these two.</p>
<p>So the company should have a really ambitious mission.</p>
<p>And then I think you as the CEO, you do have to say no to things which are off track from that.</p>
<p>You do have to part ways with people who are not helping raise the talent bar in the company.</p>
<p>And so in some ways, you have to be, I guess, hard in that sense.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re only here to make money.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s bonus time or you&rsquo;re out or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we actually have a much softer culture than that, I think, in Silicon Valley, which is</p>
<p>most of the missions of these companies are trying to do great humanitarian efforts.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying to improve the biggest problems in the world.</p>
<p>And so people sign up for those because they want to have a real impact.</p>
<p>And we take time to go for exec off sites.</p>
<p>And we walk in nature.</p>
<p>And we have coaching.</p>
<p>We do all this touchy-feely stuff.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s kind of a mix of both is the right balance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think of myself as like, you know, a Wall Street hedge fund or like the most</p>
<p>touchy-feely culture you can imagine.</p>
<p>Why do you think companies now have sort of veered into this place where they have to</p>
<p>kind of appease these fringes on either side?</p>
<p>Did you spend time trying to figure out like, how did we evolve</p>
<p>there from just being mission focused to having to deal with all this other stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, one theory I have on this is that in Silicon Valley, especially pre-pandemic,</p>
<p>we were all&hellip; It was so competitive to get talent, right?</p>
<p>Google and Facebook, they were just kind of one-upping each other on higher and higher</p>
<p>salaries. And so I know as a CEO of a company that was rising at that time,</p>
<p>I felt incredible scarcity.</p>
<p>I had people leave to get out who got better offers.</p>
<p>And it was like a real issue.</p>
<p>And so I was doing anything I could to retain people and keep them.</p>
<p>And so if an employee said, hey, I want another flavor of water in the kitchen or whatever,</p>
<p>I was like, okay, maybe we should do it.</p>
<p>But I think during the pandemic, we moved to remote first as a culture.</p>
<p>The talent we could get opened up by 100x of people all over the world who were really</p>
<p>hungry and frankly thankful for these jobs.</p>
<p>And that actually changed the scarcity mindset a little bit to say,</p>
<p>hey, if you don&rsquo;t want to be here, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>We have other people we can go recruit and hire in who really are going to value it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably just one piece of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a much more complex issue than that.</p>
<p>I think one other thing is that Google and Facebook, I think, made this a common trend</p>
<p>in the valley where companies would host these open mic Q&amp;As on every Friday or every 2 weeks</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>And it was almost like a town hall.</p>
<p>It felt like a democracy.</p>
<p>And in a democracy, the leader works for the people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re elected by the people.</p>
<p>But what got very awkward was that these open mic Q&amp;As, it became this hostile thing of</p>
<p>how can we make the person squirm and let&rsquo;s ask them these difficult societal issue questions</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t actually related to the company and what we&rsquo;re all building.</p>
<p>And I think that was actually a mistake in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve since gotten rid of these open mic Q&amp;As because it really encourages people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say we were 150-200 people.</p>
<p>Everyone was on the same page.</p>
<p>Everyone was asking good questions.</p>
<p>Once we got to 500-700 people, it started to feel like there was a little bit of an</p>
<p>us versus them.</p>
<p>And then the questions got very off track.</p>
<p>And I realized at a certain point, this is not a democracy.</p>
<p>I want everyone&rsquo;s input.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to rule with an iron fist.</p>
<p>But ultimately, I&rsquo;m the CEO.</p>
<p>I need to help guide this company in one direction and force the hard decisions.</p>
<p>Not everyone&rsquo;s going to like them.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not going to allow people to do grandstanding open mic stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a little bit of a risk for that.</p>
<p>99% of people don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>But if one person does it, it creates this snowball effect.</p>
<p>So we got rid of the open mics.</p>
<p>People can still submit questions, but nobody else can see them.</p>
<p>We read them ahead of the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s a good theme in the questions, we address it.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t grandstand with an open mic.</p>
<p>I saw this.</p>
<p>It was in Twitter.</p>
<p>Nick, maybe you can find it.</p>
<p>But it was this general that had commanded all of these different battalions.</p>
<p>And he was talking about what it was like in all the different theaters in which he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>operated.</p>
<p>And he basically said, 80% of the men and women that serve for me were just absolutely</p>
<p>incredible.</p>
<p>You could always rely on them 100% of the time.</p>
<p>They were 100% aligned.</p>
<p>And then he said there was 15% that was wishy-washy.</p>
<p>And what they were looking for was how you managed and dealt with the 5%.</p>
<p>And the 5% of folks were always trying to push the boundaries and try to figure out</p>
<p>where the escape valve was or where the exception was or whether they would be grandstanding</p>
<p>or whether they tried to break a rule.</p>
<p>And he said his entire energy was focused on keeping those folks extremely focused and</p>
<p>on point or out.</p>
<p>Because that was what solved for the 15%.</p>
<p>Because the 80% would be fine.</p>
<p>But if you didn&rsquo;t deal with the 5%, the 15% would go crazy.</p>
<p>And then the 80% would get dejected.</p>
<p>And it just kind of the whole thing would rot.</p>
<p>And it was a really interesting reminder that there&rsquo;s these people that come into these</p>
<p>companies almost with the desire to see these companies go sideways or just waste their</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>Which is completely counterintuitive because you think you joined for the mission.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t all the time.</p>
<p>And to be fair, you, I think, told people, listen, you, you could as a group of people</p>
<p>off hours, create your own, you know, dinner party and talk about whatever topics you want.</p>
<p>This is just when I&rsquo;m paying you to come to work for those eight hours, you know, on the</p>
<p>company servers, if you&rsquo;re using Slack, or whatever, you know, communication platform</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using, let&rsquo;s just stay focused on getting the work done.</p>
<p>So this could be a viable enterprise.</p>
<p>But you were fine with people if they wanted to self organize and do that on their own</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>Correct?</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t saying you can&rsquo;t have political beliefs, you can&rsquo;t care, not care about BLM</p>
<p>or some right wing.</p>
<p>That was one of the biggest sort of misnomers or miss characterization.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Deliberate mischaracterizations about the policy is that it&rsquo;s somehow silenced people</p>
<p>or prevented them from, you know, taking positions on issues or donating to causes they cared</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>The policy never said that.</p>
<p>It just said that while we&rsquo;re in the office together, on Coinbase time, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>engage in Coinbase&rsquo;s mission and avoid fractious debates that divide us.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a time for those debates and just might not I think a lot of this has to do</p>
<p>with Slack, I&rsquo;d be totally honest.</p>
<p>Yeah, when people are in a Slack room, and they&rsquo;re frustrated, and people can have valid</p>
<p>frustrations, like there are things in the world that are horrible.</p>
<p>And yeah, you want to talk about it.</p>
<p>And yeah, you build friendships at work, it&rsquo;s completely understandable that people would</p>
<p>want to blow off steam.</p>
<p>And, but just people have to look at Slack is not an AOL chat room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not Reddit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not AOL chat.</p>
<p>Maybe you could talk a little bit about electronic communications.</p>
<p>And then I think David has a follow up.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree with you Slack, I think, you know, is an amazing tool, but it does start</p>
<p>to turn into social media.</p>
<p>Once you get more than I don&rsquo;t know, 500 people in a room or 1000 people, a lot of CEOs I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been talking to, we&rsquo;re all trying to figure this out, because we still think Slack is</p>
<p>a net positive to productivity, but it has a huge negative in terms of just both distracting</p>
<p>people with lots of things popping up all the time, but also these kind of social media</p>
<p>flame wars that emerge and mob like behavior.</p>
<p>So some of the things I mean, we&rsquo;ve been trying is, for instance, if we get any kind of a</p>
<p>Slack room that has, say, more than 500 or 1000 people, we&rsquo;ll often try to limit it.</p>
<p>So only you can, you have to be a VP or level nine and above can only post in there.</p>
<p>And otherwise, it&rsquo;s read only.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to, Dunbar&rsquo;s numbers 150 people, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to think who can you remember everyone&rsquo;s name and have some sort of group</p>
<p>affinity with them.</p>
<p>And any too much above Dunbar&rsquo;s number, we try to like cap it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a read only chat room.</p>
<p>But I think these tools need to keep evolving.</p>
<p>And I hope some I know that there&rsquo;s a couple startups, y&rsquo;all might have funded some of</p>
<p>them that are working on this.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an actual neat feature you can do in Slack now, where like that level nine</p>
<p>person can post, and everybody else can post in the thread, like you can reply to the thread,</p>
<p>but the opening salvos and thread have to be started by somebody in that sort of group.</p>
<p>So, but Slack definitely needs to double down on this.</p>
<p>I also think they put that random room in there.</p>
<p>And you put the random room, it&rsquo;s like basically waving the flag, like, it&rsquo;s random, put stuff</p>
<p>in there.</p>
<p>I think you got to delete that if you&rsquo;re running, I tell all startups, delete the random room</p>
<p>and tell people do not post memes and jokes.</p>
<p>David, you had a follow up.</p>
<p>One thing I was gonna say is, so Brian, I agree with everything you said that the one</p>
<p>place maybe where I would nitpick in a way that gives you a little more credit is you</p>
<p>found a Coinbase back in 2012, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you had created this policy on day one, I don&rsquo;t think you or anybody could have</p>
<p>predicted that these issues would arise the way they have.</p>
<p>I remember 2012 was the year I sold my company to Microsoft.</p>
<p>We never had to deal with any of this stuff.</p>
<p>And we were using, we didn&rsquo;t have Slack back then, we were using Yammer, very open culture,</p>
<p>people could communicate on anything.</p>
<p>We never had sort of hyper activist employees.</p>
<p>The word woke didn&rsquo;t even exist yet.</p>
<p>And it just wasn&rsquo;t an issue.</p>
<p>So it would have required you, I think, to see ahead so many years.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s happened is, over the last several years, there&rsquo;s been this drift</p>
<p>towards employee activism inside these companies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s coming from both sides of the political spectrum, to be honest.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s coming from the sort of hyper woke employees, and they engage in petitions</p>
<p>and letter writing campaigns and threats of boycotts.</p>
<p>And they sort of Hector and Mau Mau, these CEOs to basically give in to them.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen it at Apple, the way that Apple was pressured to fire Antonio Garcia</p>
<p>Martinez, and they gave in and now they have a letter writing campaign every month.</p>
<p>And you just saw it in Florida.</p>
<p>I think Bob, what&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>Bob Chaypek at Disney.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s going to survive the year after what just happened at Disney.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because he gave in to the employees, took sides against the governor in Florida</p>
<p>and the legislature, and they just ripped away Disney special privileges in Florida.</p>
<p>You saw it at Netflix, where Ted Sarandos was sort of Mau Mau&rsquo;ed by these employees</p>
<p>who want to cancel Dave Chappelle.</p>
<p>He ultimately stuck by Chappelle, but only after groveling to these employees.</p>
<p>And so I think we&rsquo;re seeing these issues did not exist even five years ago, I would say.</p>
<p>And I think the reason why the Coinbase story is so relevant to a broader audience and what</p>
<p>you did with your policy is so relevant is I just think every company is going to have</p>
<p>to make a decision sooner or later on where they stand.</p>
<p>Do you give into these petitions and mobs and boycotts?</p>
<p>Do you allow unlimited activism inside the four walls of your company?</p>
<p>Or do you take some sort of more neutral stance where you say, listen, we&rsquo;re all going to</p>
<p>leave our politics to the door so we can effectively work together on the company&rsquo;s mission?</p>
<p>I think every company eventually is going to have to either be Coinbase or be Apple.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to be Coinbase or be Disney.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either going to have to give in to the mob and suffer the consequences,</p>
<p>or you take the short term pain of doing what Brian did.</p>
<p>And you basically realign everyone around the mission.</p>
<p>And a year later, you&rsquo;re very happy with where you are.</p>
<p>The good thing with Netflix and Disney, though, is that they&rsquo;re going to be very clear examples</p>
<p>of the business impact of getting distracted.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, Brian took leadership.</p>
<p>But the business impact, at least from the outside looking in was not really measurable.</p>
<p>Obviously, he felt that the team felt that whatever they did, and that business is working.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t done as a public company pre and post.</p>
<p>So the counterfactual is hard to measure.</p>
<p>In the case of Disney and Netflix, it&rsquo;s really clear to measure, right?</p>
<p>Meaning, in all of this confusion, Netflix has completely botched their business model.</p>
<p>In all of this fighting now internally inside of Disney, not only are they going to lose</p>
<p>essentially a fiefdom inside of Florida, but it&rsquo;s going to have repercussions with respect</p>
<p>to taxes, with respect to debt, with respect to the quality of the service they can deploy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll eventually flow through the business.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll be measurable by investors.</p>
<p>And I think, David, I think probably what I think, which is a slighter, sort of more</p>
<p>modified version of what you just said, is in the next few quarters, I think CEOs will</p>
<p>actually be better equipped to numerically point to why taking Brian&rsquo;s path is the value</p>
<p>creating path for shareholders and for stakeholders.</p>
<p>And the cost of getting distracted, quote unquote, can be really expensive if you if</p>
<p>you are a for-profit company.</p>
<p>Brian, you also have the option to run your company and say, you know what?</p>
<p>We care about this issue a whole bunch.</p>
<p>We really care about human rights here.</p>
<p>We really care about communications and freedom of speech.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to run Twitter as a freedom of speech company.</p>
<p>And everybody has to align behind that.</p>
<p>If you believe in censoring, this is not the right company for you.</p>
<p>If you believe in policing speech or you&rsquo;re uncomfortable with uncomfortable speech or</p>
<p>speech that makes you feel uncomfortable, you don&rsquo;t have to work at Twitter.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like you have to, you know, do what Brian did and say, hey, we&rsquo;re just you</p>
<p>got to decide on this.</p>
<p>You got to make a decision and be intentional about it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the higher order bit.</p>
<p>No, I was just going to say my only point is in the absence of intentionality, Jason,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll slip into one realm or the other and not really know what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>And my only point is that you&rsquo;ll be able to measure the impact of unintentionally slipping</p>
<p>and sliding around.</p>
<p>Yeah, versus picking a course and sticking to it.</p>
<p>Let me ask you guys a question.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an individual, and you want to affect social change, where is the forum in the theater</p>
<p>that you think you would go to first, you spend most of your time at work.</p>
<p>And maybe you don&rsquo;t have as much free time to go march and protest in the streets.</p>
<p>And if you did, no one would pay attention to you there anyway.</p>
<p>So sacks, like, I know that you&rsquo;ll probably have a point of view on this.</p>
<p>But like, if you&rsquo;re giving a 19 year old, who has a strong point of view, or a 25 year</p>
<p>old who has a strong point of view about something that they want to see change in society, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the right forum for them to have their protest and to make their voice heard?</p>
<p>I think that companies are a great change agent.</p>
<p>I think we all do being in Silicon Valley, creating startups, we all believe that startups</p>
<p>are a great way to change the world.</p>
<p>Those startups have missions.</p>
<p>Brian&rsquo;s company has a mission around crypto and expanding, democratizing access to the</p>
<p>financial system based on crypto.</p>
<p>Elon has a company that is accelerating the world towards sustainable transport</p>
<p>and sustainable energy.</p>
<p>He wants to make where I quibble a little bit with what Jason said about free speech.</p>
<p>I think Elon wants to make free speech restore its place back in Twitter&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like a separate thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually like should be very core to what they do.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s a mission driven company out there for any young person who cares about</p>
<p>that issue.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s not, if there&rsquo;s not a for profit vehicle, there&rsquo;s a 501, you can go join a</p>
<p>nonprofit company or start one.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Start one, donate money to a cause, you have the whole weekend, you got media, you can</p>
<p>write a blog post.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t think would work is when you have people who don&rsquo;t, who aren&rsquo;t really mission</p>
<p>driven, their mission is whatever the current thing is.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re just kind of like, oscillating from the one, the current, you know, from</p>
<p>one current thing to the next current.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And every three months, there&rsquo;s an issue du jour that that, you know, they care about</p>
<p>more than anything else in the world.</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s not going to be a company that can accommodate that sort of fickle activism.</p>
<p>Brian, can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>Are there any systems, decentralized systems that kind of give individuals,</p>
<p>you know, that you&rsquo;ve viewed interesting models that give people the ability to affect social</p>
<p>change in a way that kind of historically may have been more of a hill to climb, where</p>
<p>people can kind of aggregate resources and aggregate a voice in a way that can kind of</p>
<p>affect outcomes?</p>
<p>And do we think that that kind of becomes a mechanism for social change in the future?</p>
<p>You may, you&rsquo;re making me think of DAOs and things like that.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of that is kind of unproven.</p>
<p>Like DAOs are probably good ways to get new kind of governance systems in place for allocating</p>
<p>capital, or maybe even managing a city or, or a society.</p>
<p>But I, you know, I kind of agree with David, I think the best way to affect change right</p>
<p>now today is for young people is start a company or join a company.</p>
<p>I think young people are sometimes a little enamored with like becoming an activist.</p>
<p>But I think fundamentally, that&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re sort of giving up your power by saying like,</p>
<p>well, they have the power and I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to speak truth to power.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, there&rsquo;s context for that historically, where that may have been</p>
<p>more true.</p>
<p>But I think today, a lot of people, they have more power than they realize.</p>
<p>And if you go start a company, which, by the way, companies are decentralized, too, you</p>
<p>can have lots of little companies all over the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not like, you know, monolithic, usually.</p>
<p>And so if they start a company, they can have a good impact, I think, on the biggest issues</p>
<p>out there.</p>
<p>And I think over time as well, the way that you have real impact is that you prove yourself</p>
<p>in the market of ideas to have a high reputation and to be really reliable.</p>
<p>And that is not something that you can just overpower, you know, because you&rsquo;re 19 or</p>
<p>20 and you&rsquo;re really upset by something.</p>
<p>At some point, you&rsquo;re going to have to really invest your time and dedicate yourself to</p>
<p>something that you really, really care about.</p>
<p>And then the world tends to move to the good ideas.</p>
<p>So I think part of like what we also need to remind folks is that this is like if you</p>
<p>want to make real sustainable change, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter in which area you pick.</p>
<p>It is just really hard.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s really worth it, you should give your life to it.</p>
<p>But what I think people push back on is the more superficial forms of just virtue signaling</p>
<p>and saying, yeah, in this moment, I really want to pretend I care about something.</p>
<p>But when push comes to shove, I&rsquo;m not really willing to take the next step.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I think that most people find that very unreliable.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think a good question to ask for somebody who purports to really care is like, what</p>
<p>do you care about that&rsquo;s not currently in the news?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s not like the hot thing that everyone is basically obsessed with.</p>
<p>Well, and then how are you changing it?</p>
<p>And what is your plan to change it over the next decade or two?</p>
<p>Like, you have it takes it takes many years to effectively create a startup, you know,</p>
<p>five years, 10 years.</p>
<p>And so if your issue does yours is whatever&rsquo;s in the news, you&rsquo;re not going to create that</p>
<p>kind of change.</p>
<p>You know, I do think there are a lot of similarities between mission driven startups and political</p>
<p>movements.</p>
<p>I wrote a blog post called Your Startup is a Movement where I basically say that, you</p>
<p>know, good marketing is about evangelism.</p>
<p>It has everything in common with what good political leaders do.</p>
<p>Basically, they critique the status quo.</p>
<p>They tell you what the world looks like today, what the problem with that is, and where the</p>
<p>world needs to get to, what the solution is, and then how they&rsquo;re going to deliver that</p>
<p>solution.</p>
<p>So you can, I think, as the leader of a company, be very mission driven, you can bring a</p>
<p>bout that change you want to see in the world, you just have to attach a business model to</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a business model, you&rsquo;re just collecting donations.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build on that, Brian, what is the stated mission today of Coinbase?</p>
<p>Yeah, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world.</p>
<p>And if people aren&rsquo;t familiar with that term, economic freedom is kind of an economics term</p>
<p>like GDP, but it looks at the measures of different countries of the world.</p>
<p>And it looks at factors like, are there property rights enforced?</p>
<p>How stable is the currency?</p>
<p>How easy is it to start a business?</p>
<p>Is there corruption and bribery prevalent and things like that?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really cool about economic freedom is that basically countries with higher economic</p>
<p>freedom, like Singapore and the United States and Ireland, they tend to correlate with all</p>
<p>kinds of things we want in society, not just better economic growth, but even higher self</p>
<p>reported happiness of citizens, better treatment of the environment, better income for the</p>
<p>lowest 10% in society.</p>
<p>Gender equality, all that stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, gender equality.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, countries with low economic freedom, Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, these are</p>
<p>some of the lowest.</p>
<p>They tend to have even things we don&rsquo;t want, like higher corruption, higher war, higher</p>
<p>infant mortality.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically when I read the Bitcoin white paper back in 2010, I had this thought</p>
<p>eventually that was like, maybe cryptocurrency is this unique moment in history, this unique</p>
<p>technology that allows us to inject economic freedom into the countries all over the world,</p>
<p>especially now that more and more people have a smartphone.</p>
<p>And we can basically put good financial infrastructure, good property rights, you know, global trade,</p>
<p>a stable currency into 200 countries all over the world as one small group, relatively small</p>
<p>group of people.</p>
<p>And hopefully it has all these positive downstream impacts.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the mission of Coinbase.</p>
<p>When you look at the regulatory environment, it has been far from clear what&rsquo;s allowed</p>
<p>here in the United States.</p>
<p>In fact, you had a pretty strongly worded tweet storm back in September of 2021, some</p>
<p>really sketchy behavior coming out of the SEC race recently, story time, maybe you could</p>
<p>talk a little bit about the SEC&rsquo;s approach to cryptocurrency versus securities, XRP comes</p>
<p>to mind.</p>
<p>And knowing your customer, you&rsquo;ve obviously taken a very conservative approach to what</p>
<p>tokens you put on the platform, and then you have competitors who are offshore who it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of YOLO, anything goes.</p>
<p>What is the current administration doing right, wrong, and what needs to happen here in the</p>
<p>US to for us to be competitive in crypto, while still protecting citizens from, you</p>
<p>know, being bag holders?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a big question.</p>
<p>So, you know, as a startup, you&rsquo;re always trying to thread the needle here, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to wait too long for clarity, because sometimes these things take 5-10 years, and</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll just never launch a product.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re too aggressive, you can blow the place up.</p>
<p>And so what we always did in the early days of Coinbase is we said, we want to go do what</p>
<p>we think is going to be required in the future, go get licenses, go do KYC, go do AML, anti</p>
<p>money laundering.</p>
<p>And so we tried to basically do the right thing, go and talk to these regulators practically.</p>
<p>Now, the US has actually been pretty forward thinking on this, I&rsquo;d say every year we get</p>
<p>more and more clarity.</p>
<p>So Coinbase is now a very regulated financial service business.</p>
<p>You know, I can go through the whole list.</p>
<p>We have a license from the CFTC, a federal regulator, we acquired some broker dealer</p>
<p>licenses, which the SEC regulates, we have money transmission licenses, we&rsquo;re a bit licensed</p>
<p>in New York, etc.</p>
<p>Not just in the United States.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in many, many countries around the world.</p>
<p>So how do we get more clarity?</p>
<p>Well, one thing I&rsquo;ll just say is it&rsquo;s actually better for there to be lack of clarity than</p>
<p>to be clarity that is punitive or bad.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s good that there&rsquo;s a little bit of lack of clarity as long as it&rsquo;s not curtailing</p>
<p>the industry.</p>
<p>But what would be even better is to have clarity that does provide that right balance of good</p>
<p>consumer protection, you know, make sure that there&rsquo;s a fair level playing field for all</p>
<p>the players.</p>
<p>And then it allows innovation to flourish.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s good now is that in the US, you know, the Biden administration put out</p>
<p>an executive order recently kind of asking all the different agencies and departments</p>
<p>to come back with a clear plan.</p>
<p>And they did recognize the potential innovation in crypto in that in that executive order,</p>
<p>which I was really pleasantly surprised to see.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening now is that there was a little bit of jockeying, I think there were</p>
<p>the SEC said, hey, these all look like securities to us.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s quite true.</p>
<p>You know, the CFTC regulates commodities, while some cryptos are going to be commodities.</p>
<p>I think here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m realizing is that crypto is going to be many different things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just going to be one regulator doing it.</p>
<p>So, you know, think about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty clearly a commodity or Ethereum, right?</p>
<p>Like many of these are commodities that probably should be regulated by the commodities regulators,</p>
<p>the CFTC.</p>
<p>Now, if people want to raise money for their company, a security token, that should be</p>
<p>regulated as a security by the SEC.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be great to have more clarity on that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have, we would love to keep working with the SEC to make that a well-trodden path</p>
<p>that any company can go raise money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how it would get listed on an exchange like ours.</p>
<p>And we could register as a broker dealer or whatever license is needed.</p>
<p>Separately, there&rsquo;s also some cryptocurrencies that are going to be currencies like stable</p>
<p>coins.</p>
<p>And, you know, maybe the Treasury should regulate those.</p>
<p>And finally, there&rsquo;s going to be cryptocurrencies that are none of the above their artwork or</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s probably shouldn&rsquo;t even be regulated.</p>
<p>And so the US with various financial, you know, international bodies like G20 and FATF</p>
<p>and all these IMF are probably going to put some policy papers together.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to eventually end up with some kind of a test that says, is this cryptocurrency</p>
<p>a commodity, a security, a currency or something else like artwork?</p>
<p>And then maybe, and by the way, maybe five more things we haven&rsquo;t even thought of that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll end up being in the future.</p>
<p>What would you make the test for?</p>
<p>This is a utility token versus speculative security, because that seems to be the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really hard for people to figure out.</p>
<p>99% of people are buying a token on Coinbase because they want to see it appreciated and</p>
<p>they want to see it gain value.</p>
<p>And only 1% are using it for the actual utility of it.</p>
<p>Is it then a security?</p>
<p>Is it by the percentage of people who use it?</p>
<p>How, how would you as the, you know, the leader in this industry, you know, actually define</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your definition?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think, look, I don&rsquo;t want to be presumptuous here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I think that we can, we can put some policy papers together, but I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>be, you know, it&rsquo;s the policymaker&rsquo;s job to come up with the policy.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to step on anyone&rsquo;s toes.</p>
<p>But that being said, I think there&rsquo;s some existing case law out there.</p>
<p>Like, you know, the Howey test is something from a long time ago.</p>
<p>We could probably build upon that.</p>
<p>So the Howey test kind of says, you know, is this an investment in a common enterprise</p>
<p>with an expectation of profit?</p>
<p>And that would make it, that would make it a security.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of pieces to that.</p>
<p>You know, is it an investment?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re just giving the tokens away, I guess people aren&rsquo;t investing, right?</p>
<p>Is it a common enterprise?</p>
<p>Well, maybe if it&rsquo;s decentralized and you don&rsquo;t actually control this entity, like</p>
<p>you own, you know, less than a majority share or something, maybe then that&rsquo;s not a security,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Or if there&rsquo;s not an expectation of profit, people are using it for something.</p>
<p>So every startup right now in the space has basically had to hire a bunch of expensive</p>
<p>lawyers to go tease apart these old, old rules that some of them were created in like the</p>
<p>1930s, you know, before the internet and everything, and try to understand where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>falling.</p>
<p>And so I think building upon that Howey test, but it could be something that includes a</p>
<p>commodities definition, something, a currency definition.</p>
<p>You know, I think we should, basically it&rsquo;s on us and the other crypto companies out there</p>
<p>to go hire a really smart lawyer who has drafted legislation before and a bill and</p>
<p>actually get a draft of it out there.</p>
<p>And then we can start to circulate it with various policymakers and get their feedback.</p>
<p>And maybe they take it and run with it.</p>
<p>Maybe they say, thanks, we have it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got it from here.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s our next step.</p>
<p>Friedberg, Sachs, Chamath, would you go with the Howey test?</p>
<p>Or do you have thoughts on how to, how the government here in the US should say, this</p>
<p>is a security, this is a utility token?</p>
<p>I think what the EO did was basically kind of give people enough regulatory safety in</p>
<p>the sense that something reasonable will probably happen in the reasonable future so that people</p>
<p>could keep building and iterating.</p>
<p>My big takeaway in the last sort of like nine months is that this thing is now too big to</p>
<p>fail.</p>
<p>And the government basically has to just find a reasonable framework to enable something</p>
<p>because the real big issue, Jason, would be if they did something crazy.</p>
<p>And now, you know, retail would just get completely smoked because I think they are the-</p>
<p>What do you think is reasonable?</p>
<p>I think Congress has to basically pass a sensible set of legislations that clearly demarcate</p>
<p>exactly what Brian said.</p>
<p>This realm of stuff goes to the CFTC.</p>
<p>This realm of stuff goes to the SEC.</p>
<p>Now you guys go and implement.</p>
<p>And if left to their own devices, those two will use these arcane laws and try to negotiate</p>
<p>amongst each other who should be covering what, but they can&rsquo;t arbitrate that decision.</p>
<p>And so as a result, nothing reasonable will happen.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s what has to happen.</p>
<p>Congress has to get together and write something reasonable.</p>
<p>Friedberg, you are building companies at the production board every year.</p>
<p>You build a couple of companies.</p>
<p>You have to go through securities law.</p>
<p>You have to, you know, raise money from accredited investors.</p>
<p>You do it in the traditional way.</p>
<p>But you must be looking at crypto saying, well, I could launch Kana, Munich, whatever</p>
<p>project and have a token associated with it and raise money and raise it globally or start</p>
<p>a DAO.</p>
<p>What do you think is a reasonable way for people like yourself who are playing by the</p>
<p>existing rules to be able to embrace this new technology and these new platforms and</p>
<p>paradigms?</p>
<p>I think the government handle it.</p>
<p>Well, some perspectives important, which is, you know, go back to kind of the 1920s in</p>
<p>the United States.</p>
<p>And there were pre 1920s folks would go around and tell tall tales about interesting business</p>
<p>ideas or business concepts or things that they were going to do if they got a bunch</p>
<p>of money from investors.</p>
<p>And investors gave them money.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t actually deliver on what they said they were going to do.</p>
<p>And they got swindled.</p>
<p>And there was swindle story after swindle story that you can read about.</p>
<p>And we saw this even with the ICO craze of a few years ago, right, where people tell</p>
<p>a tall tale, you expect some value or some asset that you&rsquo;re kind of putting capital</p>
<p>into that will pay off over time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a swindle behind it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the origin of securities laws, in large part is to protect the individual</p>
<p>from being swindled, to protect the storyteller that can take money away from people and figure</p>
<p>out how to kind of rip them off and create a set of laws that the government can then</p>
<p>enforce through the risk of imprisonment against doing those things.</p>
<p>The challenge becomes when there&rsquo;s this more thoughtful way of running capital markets</p>
<p>on the other side.</p>
<p>And how do we actually resolve to some medium ground here?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that you&rsquo;re going to have as quick of a resolution to say, well, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to the old way where anyone can say anything to anyone they want.</p>
<p>And anyone can put money into any project that they want.</p>
<p>Because the role of the arbiter is to protect those from being taken advantage of.</p>
<p>If 85% of those projects are great, and 85% of the investors are intelligent and know</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the 15 it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the 15% that the government is here to protect.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason we have an institution called the government is to create systems</p>
<p>of protection for those who are otherwise unable to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Now, a free market libertarian might say, we should have at it.</p>
<p>But the problem is, we all have, we all feel as a group, at some point, a moral obligation</p>
<p>to protect those who are unprotected.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why these systems emerge over time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why these institutions exist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the government exists.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why these securities laws exist.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s difficult to assume that we can just go back to the kind of,</p>
<p>you know, prototypical days of, you know, let me raise money for anything with any story</p>
<p>without any regulation, and assume that it&rsquo;s going to work out well, because all it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to take is a few of these stories before you have folks standing up in Congress saying,</p>
<p>this is unbelievable.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t let this happen anymore.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go shut down the miners.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go shut down the data centers.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go after every asset we can.</p>
<p>And by the way, they will because look at what just happened with Russia, the way that</p>
<p>governments can kind of coalesce around digital systems now, and make significant change and</p>
<p>block things from happening.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there is a world where we can assume that even with a free and open</p>
<p>internet, that these systems can truly be decentralized, given the reach that governments</p>
<p>have.</p>
<p>And it is going to be in my mind, I&rsquo;ve said this in the past, kind of the great tension</p>
<p>of the 21st century socially, is the decentralized systems that really want to challenge what</p>
<p>we believe to be a lot of overreach that&rsquo;s happening by governments against the government&rsquo;s</p>
<p>believed role to be protecting those who are who need the protection.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s a very long winded moral statement.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a very interesting one.</p>
<p>Brian, what do you what do you think of this?</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>These are complicated issues, right?</p>
<p>We want to balance protecting people, but we also want to not have the government be</p>
<p>in a position where it&rsquo;s picking winners and losers.</p>
<p>And so, you know, just because something is legal doesn&rsquo;t make it make it a good investment.</p>
<p>I guess, you know, you could have you could have owned Netflix last week or something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>And you guys might talk about that in a minute.</p>
<p>But look, I think we all want to get rid of fraud, right?</p>
<p>So if you commit fraud, meaning you lied to investors, then that&rsquo;s going to be a crime,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like we I want to I want to work with anybody in government to go put that make that stuff</p>
<p>not happen.</p>
<p>The danger is if we ever get into a place where we say, well, only wealthy people can</p>
<p>now invest because somehow there&rsquo;s an accredited investor test that&rsquo;s inherently exclusionary.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t like the accredited investor laws.</p>
<p>If we ever get into a place where the government is saying, you know, well, you have to you</p>
<p>have to have X, Y, Z criteria and a person with this many years of experience on their</p>
<p>resume.</p>
<p>And then now we get into like the government sort of designed by committee to pick winners</p>
<p>and losers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s inherently flawed because, you know, a lot of true breakthrough innovation,</p>
<p>they look like bad ideas at the beginning.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the kind of things that a government body would never invest in or put money into,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the inherent tension we have to worry about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re protecting people, but not putting the government in the role of picking winners</p>
<p>and losers.</p>
<p>Sachs, you have any input on this sort of framework, you are investing traditionally</p>
<p>in stocks, but you have also allocated some money to multi coin capital and other folks</p>
<p>who are buying tokens, and then you have to distribute them and you have to deal with</p>
<p>these downstream legal issues.</p>
<p>How are you dealing with them?</p>
<p>And then what do you think is a is a proper framework here in the US for protecting consumers</p>
<p>while allowing innovation?</p>
<p>I think the big picture framework that we have is correct, which is you kind of have</p>
<p>this dichotomy between security tokens and utility tokens.</p>
<p>So security tokens, basically, it&rsquo;s a token that&rsquo;s issued that it&rsquo;s basically like a share</p>
<p>of stock or a fractional ownership in some business doesn&rsquo;t really have a lot of functionality</p>
<p>associated with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of an end run around the securities laws.</p>
<p>They should be treated like securities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, there are a lot of tokens that are issued as part of creating</p>
<p>a new kind of technology network, and those tokens have real functionality.</p>
<p>And if you were to subject them to securities laws, and impose KYC and accreditation, you</p>
<p>have to go through all these hoops, just to add one to your wallet, it would destroy the</p>
<p>potential functionality created by these systems.</p>
<p>So where there&rsquo;s real utility like that, I think the government should foster innovation</p>
<p>by having a lighter hand, don&rsquo;t subject them to securities laws.</p>
<p>And really what entrepreneurs need in the space are some safe harbors and really clear</p>
<p>lines around what would trip them up and have them cross over from utility token and</p>
<p>security token.</p>
<p>So they know to avoid those things.</p>
<p>So they can continue innovating on their core project.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s well said.</p>
<p>I have three ideas, Brian, I want to run by you.</p>
<p>Number one, a sophisticated test for investors in crypto and in startups.</p>
<p>So just like you get a gun test, or, you know, a test or a driver&rsquo;s license, we come up with</p>
<p>a way for people to become sophisticated.</p>
<p>They take a simple test, maybe it&rsquo;s a, you know, whatever number of questions.</p>
<p>And then second, maybe some safe harbors around the scale of a project.</p>
<p>So any crypto project under 10 million can be an experiment.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of like, no need to have rules, people just have to sign a</p>
<p>disclaimer or waiver, this is an experiment, then things may be between 10 and 100 million,</p>
<p>you implement KYC and maybe throttle the number</p>
<p>Jason, those are some good ideas for when you&rsquo;re talking about the bucket of security</p>
<p>tokens.</p>
<p>If you want to start imposing those kinds of rules on utility tokens, you can&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a functioning network with like all these sort of friction.</p>
<p>Hold on, but if then if the project gets scale, then you just have to file a little more have</p>
<p>a little more KYC and then finally, the founders of these projects, they can just launch them</p>
<p>and disappear.</p>
<p>They have no director like duty to the project.</p>
<p>Do you think there needs to be something similar to directors in corporations?</p>
<p>So just three ideas there that I&rsquo;ve heard other people talk about, or I&rsquo;ve been thinking</p>
<p>about, Brian,</p>
<p>those are pretty good.</p>
<p>I like those, actually, I mean, the nice thing about a driver&rsquo;s license test for financial</p>
<p>literacy is that it doesn&rsquo;t measure how much money you have.</p>
<p>So it would allow smart, you know, aspiring people who didn&rsquo;t start with a lot of money,</p>
<p>like a lot of us to also be able to participate early on in these, which would be really great.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s, you know, some kind of a safe harbor or sandbox provision, I think</p>
<p>is a really great idea as well.</p>
<p>And lastly, yeah, I mean, if you were able to, basically, I think your three ideas are</p>
<p>great.</p>
<p>So those are good.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re good for securities.</p>
<p>But I mean, if you just want to buy gas on a blockchain to run your program, where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a user of an application that&rsquo;s being run on a blockchain, you just want to buy a token</p>
<p>for gas.</p>
<p>Do you really have to go through all these like KYC type hoops?</p>
<p>Hopefully not, especially if it&rsquo;s a utility.</p>
<p>I mean, self custodial wallets and dApps or decentralized apps are this huge area of innovation</p>
<p>that, you know, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to like, imagine if the US government had said you</p>
<p>need to come in and register to make a website or something like that, that would have been</p>
<p>a terrible thing for innovation globally.</p>
<p>So you have to remember, too, that a lot of this is going to flow to the country with</p>
<p>the most permissive laws.</p>
<p>So a lot of governments around the world, not the most permissive, but the most well</p>
<p>structured that balances all the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Maybe clear.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The thing that I would just add to this, though, is that there&rsquo;s a lot more than just AML and</p>
<p>KYC guys that has to happen for this to be a functioning ecosystem.</p>
<p>We average, I think, one hack a week in the crypto ecosystem, right?</p>
<p>This Beanstalk hack happened, what, just a few days ago, that was almost $200 million.</p>
<p>Last month, Axie Infinity, what was that?</p>
<p>Almost $600 million.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff where in the normal securities world, like if you&rsquo;re a director</p>
<p>of a company and you don&rsquo;t have these adequate procedures, and Brian, you live this every</p>
<p>day where there&rsquo;s like an audit committee and there&rsquo;s somebody that chairs audit that</p>
<p>has to go and think about information security and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And all these disclosures have to happen.</p>
<p>Insurance.</p>
<p>But all these disclosures are really about actual work being done.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t do that work and then you get hacked, you&rsquo;re actually liable, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no version of this in a world where it is a little bit of the Wild West.</p>
<p>So that stuff also has to exist.</p>
<p>This is what I mean by I actually think Congress just needs to kind of like update the set</p>
<p>of laws that actually allow the CFTC and the SEC to do their job to include this and say,</p>
<p>now go and incrementally figure this out.</p>
<p>Because even if you get the AML and KYC stuff right, then there&rsquo;s all this other stuff where</p>
<p>these folks that had, they&rsquo;re basically all this value deprived.</p>
<p>Who do they go to try to get the money back?</p>
<p>In the case of Axie, I mean, it&rsquo;s an incredible thing.</p>
<p>But they went to Andreessen and they raised a new round.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re just going to make everybody whole.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s insane, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t expect that to happen with every single project or every single company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be possible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I think a couple of things will happen.</p>
<p>I mean, in the custodial world of crypto, there&rsquo;ll be more regulation.</p>
<p>There already is, right?</p>
<p>We have a New York Trust company that we get audited for various control environments and</p>
<p>safety and things like that.</p>
<p>But in the self-custodial world, everyone is going to start to be in control of their own</p>
<p>assets.</p>
<p>And I think that the tools are getting better and better for that, like social recovery of</p>
<p>keys if you forget your password and these kind of smart contract wallets.</p>
<p>And so both are growing.</p>
<p>And I think in the future, people may actually start to take more responsibilities for storing</p>
<p>their own wealth if they want to choose to do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll allow them to kind of access a broader ecosystem of things.</p>
<p>Let me ask a question, Brian.</p>
<p>Everybody seems to be very concerned about Tether.</p>
<p>You, I don&rsquo;t believe, participate in the Tether ecosystem at Coinbase.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re not participating directly, but we support as many assets as people want to</p>
<p>use.</p>
<p>That is one of the ones that we&rsquo;ve supported people to deposit and withdraw in Coinbase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been banned in New York.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve had regulatory action in Canada.</p>
<p>People are concerned about their attestations or lack of clarity on their commercial paper.</p>
<p>What do you think of the stable coins getting very big?</p>
<p>And maybe USDC seems to have it pretty tightly covered.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s all these concerns and regulatory actions against Tether.</p>
<p>Is that a big nothing burger?</p>
<p>Or does it concern you that there&rsquo;s a lack of transparency into their holdings?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I would say, you know, some of the early stable coin efforts definitely didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have all their ducks in a row from a reputational point of view.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not an expert on Tether.</p>
<p>My understanding is that there have been some investigations and enforcement actions which</p>
<p>have required them to go in there and clean up some things.</p>
<p>And, you know, our digital asset listing group kind of looked at a lot of this in depth and</p>
<p>made that judgment call that where they were and where they are now.</p>
<p>But yeah, I do think that we&rsquo;re seeing the emergence of new groups like, you know, USD</p>
<p>coin is one of those that I think has some better controls around it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a bunch of stable coins now that are decentralized.</p>
<p>You know, Dai and Frax.</p>
<p>Explain what that is and why it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Well, so OK, so it really comes down to trust.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, you can trust you can decide to trust something like USDC that has kind</p>
<p>of audit requirements and, you know, a big four accounting firm come in and look at it</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>Or you can look at smart contract code and, you know, thousands of people around the world</p>
<p>can look at that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an inherent bug bounty if you find an issue there.</p>
<p>And if it hasn&rsquo;t been found, then you can start to think about trusting that.</p>
<p>Now, I think stable coins like Dai and others, they&rsquo;ve been able to create these relatively</p>
<p>complex systems that have sort of one asset which is intended to be stable, but another</p>
<p>one which is sort of the collateral.</p>
<p>And you could imagine various black swan events where, you know, the peg would get broken</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>But it really hasn&rsquo;t happened yet in Dai.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s shown a lot of resiliency, which I&rsquo;ve been very impressed by.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually one other type of coin, which I think is even maybe more interesting than</p>
<p>just wrapping a fiat, like a dollar or a rupee or something like that, because frankly, you</p>
<p>know, the dollar is seeing a lot of inflation.</p>
<p>You guys have talked about it many times on this show.</p>
<p>So do you really want to have a stable, quote, stable coin that is inflating, you know, 8%</p>
<p>a year?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some new coins coming out, which I&rsquo;ve been really excited to see, which are, I think,</p>
<p>you know, biology calls them flat coins, but they&rsquo;re basically looking at the consumer</p>
<p>price index, and they&rsquo;re trying to basically have flat purchasing power and assume that</p>
<p>the dollar and various fiat currencies around the world actually going to go through more</p>
<p>inflation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty cool idea.</p>
<p>And you can do that in a creative way on a blockchain by having various oracles, which</p>
<p>are these sources of truth.</p>
<p>And if enough of them, you know, 51% of them tell you the CPI we think is this this year,</p>
<p>it can kind of keep keep pace with CPI, which is a really cool innovation, I think.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for Brian Armstrong for joining us for the first hour.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;ll continue on with our Netflix discussion.</p>
<p>Brian&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>He was very honest.</p>
<p>He answered a lot of questions very honestly.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a super fan of the show.</p>
<p>That business is a great business.</p>
<p>That business will be a great business thoughtful.</p>
<p>We like somebody who&rsquo;s thoughtful.</p>
<p>I really think that the challenge that Brian faced a year and a half ago, and the policy</p>
<p>decision he faced is now being faced by every CEO across America.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the broad relevance is, you know, what are they going to do?</p>
<p>Do you see this, this quote by the McDonald&rsquo;s CEO, the former McDonald&rsquo;s CEO Ed Renzi on</p>
<p>Wednesday said companies have no business being in politics, and has launched a new</p>
<p>advocacy coalition to fight woke corporate politics.</p>
<p>He said corporations have no business being on the right or the left, because they represent</p>
<p>everybody there and their sole job is to build equity for their investors.</p>
<p>Wait, the people who make filet of fish are not going to chime in on Ukraine anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, but but think about that.</p>
<p>Because that actually is a pretty radical.</p>
<p>It is a line in the sand.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s standing on Brian shoulders.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>I think, you know, the CEO of McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like a big, you know, traditional fortune 500 type corporation.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re saying, like, we&rsquo;re not doing this anymore.</p>
<p>Well, you know what, they were more than willing to do it if it scored them points,</p>
<p>but they realized was it&rsquo;s going to be a never once you</p>
<p>engage that you&rsquo;re never going to be able to disengage from it.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s pivot over to Netflix.</p>
<p>They reported a drop in net subscribers for the first time in 10 years, and the stock dropped</p>
<p>35% market cap from 155 billion to about 98 billion.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, as of Wednesday, Netflix was the worst performing S&amp;P 500 so far in 2022</p>
<p>stock down 63% year to date.</p>
<p>Ackman dumped his entire stake and booked a $430 million loss.</p>
<p>And a large part of this was because they didn&rsquo;t hit their 2.5 million or so</p>
<p>target increase in subscribers.</p>
<p>And they in fact, lost all 700,000 Russian subscribers as part of boycotting</p>
<p>Russia because of the Ukraine war.</p>
<p>What do we think is happening here?</p>
<p>Is this a bellwether Chamath for something more important going on?</p>
<p>Or is this just Netflix not executing?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a macro thing and then there&rsquo;s a Netflix specific thing.</p>
<p>The macro thing is that we are learning the broad sweeping impact of Apple&rsquo;s privacy changes,</p>
<p>in my opinion.</p>
<p>You first saw it flow through into Facebook&rsquo;s earnings and basically them saying this is</p>
<p>going to be really tough.</p>
<p>And you had Netflix, even if you add back the Russian subscribers basically spend almost</p>
<p>$600 million in the quarter on customer acquisition to effectively they would have</p>
<p>generated 500,000 subscribers net of churn, right?</p>
<p>Which was still about a million and a half under where they needed to be.</p>
<p>So the point is that I think Netflix in some ways was a little bit of a canary in the coal</p>
<p>mine for the shrinking effectiveness of online advertising.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why you then saw two days later, Facebook got taken to the woodshed</p>
<p>in two days was down.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s down, I don&rsquo;t know, 15, 20%.</p>
<p>Google I think has been down a lot today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just getting absolutely smoked relative to the market.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the macro issue, which is I think it&rsquo;s really hard for these ads to be as effective</p>
<p>as they used to be.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only going to get worse because Google has also said that they&rsquo;re going to implement</p>
<p>a lot of the same versions of what Apple did inside of Android.</p>
<p>So customer acquisition is going up.</p>
<p>So if you look at then all the companies that have to live and die on CAC, it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be an expensive road.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the macro thing.</p>
<p>I think that not enough people are talking about.</p>
<p>I think the micro thing inside of Netflix is that, you know, people churn out of a service</p>
<p>when there isn&rsquo;t enough value.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the most basic explanation of why so many people are leaving Netflix</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s not that valuable.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re spending $20 billion a year on content, but people more than ever are</p>
<p>leaving the service, you have to inspect how much are you really spending in these areas</p>
<p>and what is it actually creating in terms of like library value?</p>
<p>You know, Disney Plus, I think has gotten, has done an incredible job in a much shorter</p>
<p>period of time.</p>
<p>Apple, after only a few years, wins the first Oscar of any of the streamers, right?</p>
<p>Beating Netflix, even though they&rsquo;ve been in there and spent a hundred-</p>
<p>For best picture.</p>
<p>For best picture.</p>
<p>For best picture.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying, so when you put all these things together, I think Netflix probably</p>
<p>has lost a little bit of the script, but they&rsquo;re also suffering from a really macro headwind,</p>
<p>which is the advertising business is broken.</p>
<p>I would imagine that like total subscribers to streaming services, and if you were to</p>
<p>add up total subscription service dollars, it&rsquo;s probably growing a lot.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>Netflix&rsquo;s relative share is going down because the quality of the competitors is improving</p>
<p>so much.</p>
<p>Even companies that are not able to deliver like CNN shut down CNN Plus this week, after</p>
<p>investing $300 million in trying to build out the service, I mean, folks are putting</p>
<p>serious dollars behind these projects.</p>
<p>And so, the competition is fierce, and they&rsquo;ve got deep content libraries behind them.</p>
<p>I personally think HBO Max is the best streaming service now.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Followed by Disney Plus, followed by maybe a mix of Amazon, Netflix, and Prime.</p>
<p>And so, Netflix&rsquo;s relative value is going down because there&rsquo;s so much other content.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m thinking about what to watch, I&rsquo;m looking at Disney Plus, I&rsquo;m looking at HBO</p>
<p>Max, and I&rsquo;m like, hey, you know, what should I watch tonight?</p>
<p>And then I look at Netflix.</p>
<p>Netflix doesn&rsquo;t have a monopoly in content anymore.</p>
<p>And so, when I&rsquo;ve got limited dollars, I personally, I looked at this after we were</p>
<p>texting about it, I subscribe to seven streaming services right now.</p>
<p>And if I didn&rsquo;t care as much about how much I was spending per month, I would probably</p>
<p>cut three of them.</p>
<p>And Netflix would probably-</p>
<p>Under 100.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also then highlighting the second, I think, macro thing that is actually equally</p>
<p>important, maybe even more important, which is, you know, the first rule of capitalism</p>
<p>says that excess returns will always get competed away.</p>
<p>So, you know, Netflix had the run of the place where they were an effective monopoly.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And now, when everybody else woke up and got religion, they decided to invest and they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>created some really compelling content.</p>
<p>And so, all of those returns will now get spread across seven or eight or nine competitors,</p>
<p>which means that just by definition, mathematically, Netflix can&rsquo;t win the way that they used to.</p>
<p>And the network advantage in the streaming model is content and consumers.</p>
<p>So, you have better content, you get more consumers, you get more money from consumers,</p>
<p>you spend more on content.</p>
<p>At some point, you get diminishing returns in that network model.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re seeing those diminishing returns hit Netflix.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t built advantages in search and discovery, or in social sharing, or other</p>
<p>features into the app or into the service that will give them more of a lock-in value.</p>
<p>Because all I&rsquo;m doing is buying content, is watching content.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also three times the price.</p>
<p>And I can do that elsewhere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also three times the price of Disney Plus and other services.</p>
<p>So, in the competition space, people are starting to look at and go,</p>
<p>is this worth a Disney and an NBC?</p>
<p>Or is this worth a Hulu and an NBC streaming service?</p>
<p>Sax, you had something to add?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I agree with that.</p>
<p>I would just add one factor to this, which is what Elon said, which is he said,</p>
<p>the woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable.</p>
<p>I mean, the quality of the programming has gone down.</p>
<p>I mean, Netflix used to be really good.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a show now that I watch on Netflix.</p>
<p>And I do watch HBO Max right now and Disney Plus because they got some shows that I like.</p>
<p>So, I think somehow the programming people at Netflix have gotten out of touch.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Are they pandering to that audience, Sax, do you think?</p>
<p>And similar to kind of how Disney ended up pandering.</p>
<p>And do you think that there&rsquo;s broadly this kind of media</p>
<p>problem of trying to pander to the wrong audience?</p>
<p>I mean, they almost threw Chappelle off, who&rsquo;s by far the number one comic</p>
<p>in American comedy.</p>
<p>And they absolutely would have thrown Chappelle off and done what a lot of those employees wanted</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t have such a big deal with him, if he wasn&rsquo;t such a big deal.</p>
<p>No, I think they held the line pretty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of groveling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of groveling, Jake.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think they reasonably heard the concerns of their employees and said,</p>
<p>we reasonably disagree.</p>
<p>Can I ask you guys a question?</p>
<p>Yeah, but Jason, it showed, but yes, but look, yes, maybe.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is that that episode revealed that the people are doing the programming</p>
<p>on Netflix, obviously, like, they&rsquo;re not like, I think they&rsquo;ve lost touch with where most of</p>
<p>the country is.</p>
<p>I will give a shout out.</p>
<p>I have not watched a series on Netflix in probably a year.</p>
<p>Ozark?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>But I will give a shout out to Never Have I Ever, which Mindy Kaling created.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And that series is incredibly funny and poignant and cool and awesome.</p>
<p>But outside of that series, I cannot think of a single reason why I would actually pay</p>
<p>for Netflix.</p>
<p>You got let me ask you guys a question.</p>
<p>So going back because, you know, there was the whole Disney pandering.</p>
<p>HBO Max, however.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>The whole industry is suffering this problem.</p>
<p>Do you remember the Oscars?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even watch it anymore.</p>
<p>This is the question I have for you.</p>
<p>Do you guys think that there&rsquo;s a difference culturally in the management of the media</p>
<p>company?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go through them.</p>
<p>Warner Media, Disney, Netflix, Amazon.</p>
<p>And do you think that that cultural difference may create an advantage and success?</p>
<p>Do you think that Warner Media is operating HBO Max differently because they&rsquo;re culturally</p>
<p>different?</p>
<p>Yeah, because they&rsquo;re culturally different.</p>
<p>HBO has always been culturally different.</p>
<p>They have been for or tours.</p>
<p>HBO has sucked for years.</p>
<p>They got a few good shows.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s more like they&rsquo;ve always been for or tours.</p>
<p>They always have gone to the vision of the director, the vision of the writer and taken</p>
<p>a lot of risk.</p>
<p>When you hear that HBO logo, you know it&rsquo;s going to be a high end.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>They have some really good shows right now.</p>
<p>But until the last couple of years, it was like pretty dismal business.</p>
<p>But I mean, to Freeberg&rsquo;s point, you know that Netflix.</p>
<p>I would say I would say Disney has Marvel and that&rsquo;s why they have Marvel and Star Wars.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s and that&rsquo;s kept them extremely relevant.</p>
<p>And Pixar.</p>
<p>Yes, the IP.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how much and the advantage Disney has is the rewatch ability of their</p>
<p>content.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times your kids have all watched Moana.</p>
<p>My kids have watched.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to watch Moana 107 times already.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>And the and the Star Wars content, as you guys know, you could rewatch Star Wars and</p>
<p>Marvel.</p>
<p>I mean, like the content is very different on Pixar movies, too.</p>
<p>You can watch 100 times over.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very different content.</p>
<p>HBO Max is thrilling and engaging and doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s pandering.</p>
<p>HBO right now is operating at the next level.</p>
<p>I mean, so many good shows it for me.</p>
<p>But Netflix was five years ago.</p>
<p>So I understand.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not talking about the past.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about today.</p>
<p>Netflix went with these very big deals with big celebrity names.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think they just lost their uniqueness in terms of risk taking.</p>
<p>So they went with Adam Sandler.</p>
<p>No offense to Adam Sandler fans.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing a lot of reality TV now.</p>
<p>And if you look at Hulu, like Dope Sick and then the dropout, if you look at Apple TV,</p>
<p>Ted Lasso, we crashed.</p>
<p>And then you look at HBO Max with just, you know, Euphoria.</p>
<p>By the way, yeah, even I can actually.</p>
<p>Euphoria.</p>
<p>Can you imagine Euphoria on Netflix?</p>
<p>It would never be on Netflix.</p>
<p>It would never get made.</p>
<p>It would never get made on Netflix.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they.</p>
<p>Yeah, they don&rsquo;t want to take risk.</p>
<p>HBO is like for adults.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s paid and they&rsquo;re going to take risk.</p>
<p>And Disney doesn&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t touch that.</p>
<p>I think Hulu is a sleeper.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Hulu is great.</p>
<p>Have you guys watched the series called The Great on Hulu?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about Catherine the Great.</p>
<p>It is incredible.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stop my Hulu subscription.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching Severance right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like really like, you know, ephemeral.</p>
<p>By the way, I started paying for YouTube TV so that I could get streaming cable.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I do Hulu.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my number one.</p>
<p>My number one watch thing is YouTube TV because I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Do you have YouTube without ads?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>YouTube without ads is such a game changer.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>What is it called?</p>
<p>YouTube Red or Premium?</p>
<p>YouTube Premium, it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nine bucks a month, Chamath.</p>
<p>You can afford it.</p>
<p>You see no ads on YouTube.</p>
<p>Ask your assistant to ask her assistant to sign you up and you won&rsquo;t have to watch ads on YouTube.</p>
<p>Are you functionally not able to use the Internet now, Chamath?</p>
<p>I actually have people that do it for me.</p>
<p>Do they type in your email password for you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, how does this work?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, there&rsquo;s a person right there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll jump in if I can&rsquo;t get the mouse to work.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got the VP of product from Questron who lives in a little shack in the house next door</p>
<p>who comes over and uses the remote for him.</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in, everybody.</p>
<p>For the dictator himself, the sultan of science, David Sachs, we have a jam-packed agenda.</p>
<p>My God, the summit is going to be amazing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just do a little recap here of what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got some pretty great speakers, Ryan Peterson, Nate Silver,</p>
<p>Claire Dickel, Brad Gerstner, Palmer Luckey&rsquo;s coming, Elon&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p>Keith Rabois is coming, Joe Lonsdale, Tim Urban.</p>
<p>Wait, did you say Elon&rsquo;s coming?</p>
<p>Oh, is that what it says on the website?</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s on the website now.</p>
<p>Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is coming.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Of PayPal.</p>
<p>Antonio Gracias.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve got just an all-star group here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of buried there.</p>
<p>And I think Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi are coming.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s going to be amazing.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s going to be really great.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you next time on the All In podcast.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>My dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
