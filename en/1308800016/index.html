If that DNA belongs to Ron, then it actually means the profile is kind of useless.

    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>As of last summer, authorities have Ron Hulse&rsquo;s DNA swab.</p>
<p>They agreed to do a direct comparison test against the partial male profile found on Darlene&rsquo;s blouse.</p>
<p>Not because Ron is a suspect, but because he&rsquo;s her husband.</p>
<p>If that DNA belongs to Ron, then it actually means the profile is kind of useless.</p>
<p>Maybe it was from their hug goodbye that morning when he went to work,</p>
<p>in which case it means that we need to start testing other items while we still can to get a suspect sample.</p>
<p>And that sample might be right there in the slides from her autopsy if they still have them.</p>
<p>If they did a comparison between Ron&rsquo;s swab and the semen,</p>
<p>they could figure out pretty quickly if it did in fact belong to Ron.</p>
<p>But we asked Prosecutor Chipman if that has been done yet, and he said no.</p>
<p>It was the first of many no&rsquo;s that we&rsquo;d hear.</p>
<p>This is episode 15. Next in the investigation.</p>
<p>We also asked Chipman if there were any immediate plans to get a swab from Kenneth McCune Jr.</p>
<p>And he said he still needed to write an affidavit to get a court order to do so.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not waiting for‚ÄîI&rsquo;m waiting for my people.</p>
<p>I gotta do‚ÄîI got work to cut out. I mean, I got work to do.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re too early.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 40 years.</p>
<p>I feel like you could put that clip on repeat, and it was every conversation we had with Nelson.</p>
<p>When Emily met with him in August, the plan was to get some comparison testing done in October.</p>
<p>Then the goal was by Thanksgiving, then by the end of the year for sure.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t gotten any updates since then.</p>
<p>When we push, Nelson gives us the same story he&rsquo;s always given Kristen.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re busy. New cases come in every day.</p>
<p>No doubt, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s bluffing.</p>
<p>But I also don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an excuse.</p>
<p>What keeps you motivated in wanting to solve this case?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the romantic way of saying it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, there&rsquo;s ego.</p>
<p>You know, I want to win.</p>
<p>But, you know, I want that family to have some kind of closure.</p>
<p>I never like that term or that concept.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even understand what it means.</p>
<p>Justice, ego, and closure for the family.</p>
<p>If his ego wants a win, it seems like a softball.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at the point where the only thing that&rsquo;s left to do is test the freaking evidence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only thing I personally can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Nelson&rsquo;s lack of urgency around this has been driving us bonkers for the last year.</p>
<p>And please keep in mind, the frustration that we&rsquo;ve felt is just a fraction of what Darlene&rsquo;s family has lived with for nearly four decades.</p>
<p>If I put myself in their shoes, and we&rsquo;re talking to the state police, what I want to say is,</p>
<p>I get that new crimes are popping up every day, but like, if we&rsquo;ve got something so viable and we&rsquo;ve been waiting 38 years,</p>
<p>like, when do we get to cut to the front of the line?</p>
<p>And I understand the frustration.</p>
<p>I understand the frustration.</p>
<p>Right, and I&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s like an easy fix or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s disheartening.</p>
<p>Nelson said he&rsquo;s never thought about it that way.</p>
<p>About Darlene&rsquo;s case, getting to cut the line because she and her family have already waited so long.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like the most natural conclusion to me.</p>
<p>Which is why I think bringing in fresh perspectives can be good sometimes.</p>
<p>So, what now?</p>
<p>The to-do list for authorities is short and simple.</p>
<p>Number one, compare the unknown sample to Ron.</p>
<p>If it ends up being his DNA, go back to the underwear, to the sexual assault kit, other pieces of evidence,</p>
<p>and do more retesting to get a new sample.</p>
<p>Number two, if it&rsquo;s not Ron, or once another sample is obtained,</p>
<p>start going down the list and testing it against people known in the investigation, both then and now.</p>
<p>Now, for me and Emily, our to-do list is a little less straightforward.</p>
<p>I mean, really, our to-do list comes to a grinding halt,</p>
<p>the second comparison testing is done, and Darlene&rsquo;s killer is identified.</p>
<p>But until then, we want to keep looking at all the things that still don&rsquo;t make sense,</p>
<p>and we want to keep pulling at little threads that unravel into something bigger.</p>
<p>And there are all of these little threads.</p>
<p>Some that lead nowhere, some that might mean nothing.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know unless we pick and pull them apart.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>Back around the holidays, as Emily and I were in the thick of writing this series,</p>
<p>we kept going back through old reports to fact-check and also to make sure that we hadn&rsquo;t missed anything.</p>
<p>And almost every time we did, we came up with another person worth investigating.</p>
<p>Like, do you remember the Argus appliance guy, Lee?</p>
<p>I told you about him back in episode six.</p>
<p>Ron Hulse said that he was going to do a house call on the day that Darlene was abducted.</p>
<p>Ron told police in one of his original interviews</p>
<p>that Lee was supposed to stop by that morning to check out a faulty refrigerator light.</p>
<p>We called him, and he was supposed to come down shortly then and fix it.</p>
<p>As it turned out, he was on his way at 9.30 that morning,</p>
<p>drove by the road and said, well, I promised I&rsquo;d call first,</p>
<p>so he kept driving and went into Rochester.</p>
<p>Police didn&rsquo;t pose any follow-up questions about this, but I have a few.</p>
<p>First, we know Darlene was about to head out the door that morning</p>
<p>with all three girls for Kristen&rsquo;s doctor appointment, which was at 10 o&rsquo;clock in Plymouth.</p>
<p>So she wasn&rsquo;t even planning on being home at 9.30 that morning to meet a fridge repairman.</p>
<p>So was it an unplanned, spontaneous house call?</p>
<p>I mean, you have a man who says that he&rsquo;s going to stop by the Hulse house on the day</p>
<p>and the exact time a murder is going down, and you don&rsquo;t interview him?</p>
<p>We asked Sergeant Yokelet about this, and he said that he remembered this lead about Lee Chisholm,</p>
<p>but he doesn&rsquo;t remember anything coming from it.</p>
<p>I gather that Lee was older and didn&rsquo;t quite fit the physical description of the suspect,</p>
<p>so it was discounted quickly.</p>
<p>But after doing a little digging ourselves, we found out that Lee has a son</p>
<p>who was within the suspect&rsquo;s age range, who is a convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>Sergeant Yokelet didn&rsquo;t remember anything about the son,</p>
<p>and the son didn&rsquo;t return our calls.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to say if he even worked for his dad back in the mid-&rsquo;80s</p>
<p>or would have known about the Hulse&rsquo;s refrigerator problems.</p>
<p>But again, this is another question worth getting answers to in this case.</p>
<p>Another name that sometimes gets tossed around in Darlene&rsquo;s case is Ray Oviatt,</p>
<p>a former Baptist pastor from Argus who was arrested for child molestation in 1986.</p>
<p>That would have been two years after Darlene&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>He was head of the First Baptist Church in Argus in the 80s,</p>
<p>which is one of the churches that the Hulses attended for a bit</p>
<p>while they were kind of church hopping.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a rumor around Argus that because Darlene played piano for the church,</p>
<p>that she was there during a weekday and maybe walked in on the pastor molesting a young boy</p>
<p>and that her murder was a silencing tactic.</p>
<p>But according to Darlene&rsquo;s family, Darlene did not play piano at First Baptist</p>
<p>and wouldn&rsquo;t have ever had a reason to go there for anything besides Sunday service.</p>
<p>And by the time Darlene died, the Hulses were attending a completely different church, Liberty Baptist.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already talked about why, but nothing about Darlene&rsquo;s case says it was a hit job.</p>
<p>And her family feels like the pastor theory is just a baseless rumor.</p>
<p>But do you want to hear about the little thread that really keeps me up at night?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another man that police questioned briefly back in 1984</p>
<p>because of something an officer found in the Hulses&rsquo; yard after the murder.</p>
<p>It was this torn piece of a prescription paper with the name Robert Ewing on it.</p>
<p>Now that alone is not all that suspicious until you look at the date.</p>
<p>There is something scribbled out and written in its place is August 17th, 1984,</p>
<p>the day Darlene was abducted.</p>
<p>According to old reports, Robert told police that he didn&rsquo;t know the Hulses,</p>
<p>but he thought that maybe he had been at their house for a yard sale a few weeks prior.</p>
<p>We asked Darlene&rsquo;s family, but they don&rsquo;t remember there ever being any yard sales at their house.</p>
<p>I even had Emily check old newspaper ads for yard sales at the Hulse home from that summer,</p>
<p>and there weren&rsquo;t any.</p>
<p>We even had Darlene&rsquo;s daughters ask their dad Ron.</p>
<p>Nobody remembers hosting yard sales there.</p>
<p>Now Sergeant Yochelet told us that he remembers this lead,</p>
<p>and he remembers following up on it because he said there was a valid reason for that paper to be there.</p>
<p>He just doesn&rsquo;t remember what it was.</p>
<p>Nelson suggested that maybe the piece of paper flew over into the Hulses&rsquo; yard from the nearby landfill,</p>
<p>which we found so weird.</p>
<p>Why even suggest a thing unless it had any merit?</p>
<p>I mean, there is a landfill about a half a mile south of where the Hulses lived,</p>
<p>so his suggestion wasn&rsquo;t totally random,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like trash from there is constantly blowing into people&rsquo;s yards.</p>
<p>And that logic doesn&rsquo;t even make sense.</p>
<p>Again, it was dated 8-17.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re saying it made it to the landfill on 8-17 and then blew into Darlene&rsquo;s yard that same day?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Old reports are vague.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t say exactly where or what day the paper was found.</p>
<p>Though the way that the reports are written makes us think that this piece of paper was found pretty soon after Darlene&rsquo;s body was found,</p>
<p>like when police were all over the property looking for evidence.</p>
<p>It seems like police just took Robert&rsquo;s word for it,</p>
<p>because in the report the officer wrote that there was no need to follow up.</p>
<p>We tried to reach Robert Ewing,</p>
<p>but we got a family member instead who said that Robert wasn&rsquo;t in good enough health to speak with us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also actively trying to track down this guy,</p>
<p>or pretty much a kid at the time,</p>
<p>who was in the woods hunting the day Darlene&rsquo;s body was found.</p>
<p>He claimed to be just 20 feet from where the body was discovered,</p>
<p>but said that he never saw anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s particularly interesting to me because there were reports from other Hulse women,</p>
<p>Ron&rsquo;s mom and sister,</p>
<p>about someone who was lurking around their properties and peeping into the window months or even years before Darlene&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>And the officer who interviewed this young man mentioned that there were rumors that he was that peeping Tom,</p>
<p>which he denied, but I&rsquo;d still love to talk to him.</p>
<p>And then there are all these other rapes and murders at the time.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I think the Brandy Peltz case needs a second look,</p>
<p>specifically in comparison to Darlene&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>For years, Marshall County authorities have discounted a connection between Brandy and Darlene&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>because of the different causes of death.</p>
<p>But now we have an expert saying that Darlene was likely sexually assaulted and strangled,</p>
<p>just like Brandy two years later and just less than two miles up the road.</p>
<p>The big difference between the cases was the fact that Darlene was taken from her home</p>
<p>and Brandy was placed in the bathtub and her killer lit a fire inside the house.</p>
<p>But even those details make the Hulse daughters wonder about a connection.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tell me all those are not related. Right there.</p>
<p>But why did he set that house on fire?</p>
<p>Well, think about it, though. He&rsquo;s trying to cover it up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, OK, I jacked up moms, like I took her somewhere and they found her body.</p>
<p>How am I going to get rid of this one?</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, what would you do? What would get rid of all the evidence?</p>
<p>You would set something on fire.</p>
<p>I mean, also seeing us coming out of the bathtub, did that spark his imagination of, oh, bathtub.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I know that sounds weird, but he&rsquo;s reviewing everything in his head and he&rsquo;s like, yeah, water.</p>
<p>Fire.</p>
<p>Brandy&rsquo;s not the only case I&rsquo;m interested in giving a closer look.</p>
<p>There was a string of rapes across northern Indiana at the time that I find particularly interesting.</p>
<p>And a weird tip I&rsquo;ve never been able to shake suggests that Darlene&rsquo;s case could be connected to the murders</p>
<p>of other Indiana housewives in the surrounding years.</p>
<p>Is there a season two of Darlene&rsquo;s case up our sleeve?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Honestly, I hope not.</p>
<p>Because that would mean the authorities did the testing and we don&rsquo;t have to keep digging.</p>
<p>It means Marie, Melissa and Kristen finally have the answers after all of these years.</p>
<p>And you know what? Answers is all they want.</p>
<p>Not justice or vengeance.</p>
<p>Just answers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the why. What did you think you were going to accomplish?</p>
<p>But now that we know more about it, I feel like that answers some of the why.</p>
<p>But like, why her? Why that time of day?</p>
<p>I selfishly want to be like, you saw us.</p>
<p>You saw us.</p>
<p>You saw us.</p>
<p>You knew what you were taking away from three young girls.</p>
<p>You saw us all. You saw her crawling around.</p>
<p>You saw her. You chased.</p>
<p>Like, what? How did you think it was going to turn out?</p>
<p>If you get the chance to, you know, ask this person any questions or anything you&rsquo;d want to say to him.</p>
<p>What did you hope to accomplish? And please tell me that you took her life and she was not aware of it.</p>
<p>That she didn&rsquo;t suffer.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about us?</p>
<p>Did you follow any of us?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that question asked to me a lot.</p>
<p>Like, when people find out, they&rsquo;re like, is that why you moved?</p>
<p>And I was like, it&rsquo;s actually not why we moved, even though it seems that way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of questions.</p>
<p>Did you follow her? Did you stalk her?</p>
<p>When did you see her?</p>
<p>How did you get over that and then live a normal life?</p>
<p>What did you do after you dumped her?</p>
<p>What was your day like?</p>
<p>What did you do the following weeks?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d you go?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not all about him getting punished, but just the fact that we could go on and never, never know anything.</p>
<p>Just, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, once upon a time I would have been a lot harsher, but now I just want closure.</p>
<p>I just want, I feel like time is running out for my dad.</p>
<p>He told me yesterday when we were in the kitchen, and I was asking him all those questions, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I just, oh Kristen, I&rsquo;ve just, I&rsquo;ve just resorted and told myself that this is never going to get solved.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>The Hulse family deserves those answers, and they do deserve justice.</p>
<p>Something that has been so remarkable about working on this project has been seeing that</p>
<p>despite the awful tragedy that happened to their family,</p>
<p>they all have so much happiness and love in their lives.</p>
<p>I mean, in half the audio from our interviews with them, you can hear it.</p>
<p>Babies cooing, kids interrupting to ask their moms for snacks, and teenagers running through the house.</p>
<p>The first time I heard it, the audio producer in me was like, crap, we can&rsquo;t use any of this.</p>
<p>But then I listened close.</p>
<p>I listened as a mom.</p>
<p>You hungry, baby?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Get you some food.</p>
<p>She eats french fries with a fork.</p>
<p>What kind of crazy is she?</p>
<p>Love and laughter fill their houses, and it&rsquo;s comforting knowing that whoever did this to Darlene</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t take that away from her family.</p>
<p>And I hope Darlene can hear all of it.</p>
<p>Darlene will always be their mom.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not the body in the woods or the homicide victim.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the woman who made all of their own bedding and clothes and lived frugally</p>
<p>to make sure she could send all three of them to college.</p>
<p>She would try and make a meal, like a dollar a meal.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s what she wants to spend because she was trying to save for our college.</p>
<p>Even when I was little, that was something that she was already saying,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re going to save for your college.</p>
<p>You girls are going to college.</p>
<p>When the girls were little, Darlene would do these audio diaries with them,</p>
<p>and she would ask them questions and help them practice pronouncing words.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now March 29, 1980.</p>
<p>Marie is three and a half.</p>
<p>Melissa is 27 months old.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re taking their bath now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be talking.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Marie, say your ABCs.</p>
<p>B, C, D, E, F, G,</p>
<p>H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O.</p>
<p>Q, R, S, T, U, V,</p>
<p>A, B, C, D, E, F, G,</p>
<p>H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P,</p>
<p>Q, R, S&hellip;</p>
<p>She did these to document what her kids sounded like at different ages,</p>
<p>not knowing that they would grow up to cherish the recordings to remember her voice.</p>
<p>Today is December 17, 1980.</p>
<p>Marie is four years old, and Melissa will be three on December 29 in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what they sound like at this age.</p>
<p>Marie, what would you like for Christmas this year?</p>
<p>Tinkerbell.</p>
<p>Tinkerbell what? What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>What kind of Tinkerbell?</p>
<p>Lipstick.</p>
<p>What do you want, Melissa?</p>
<p>Candy canes.</p>
<p>Candy canes?</p>
<p>Did you see Santa last week?</p>
<p>Yeah, we did.</p>
<p>What did he say?</p>
<p>He said, you want some Tinkerbell?</p>
<p>Yeah, I want some.</p>
<p>Did you think you were a good girl or a bad girl?</p>
<p>Good girl.</p>
<p>He thought you were a good girl.</p>
<p>What did you say, Melissa?</p>
<p>Did you like Santa?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You did? How come you went to the lab?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>Well, maybe next time, huh?</p>
<p>Darlene was also the kind of mom who would just joke around with her kids.</p>
<p>She was silly and she wasn&rsquo;t afraid to go outside and play with them.</p>
<p>She had on a Playboy Bunny shirt.</p>
<p>Do you remember that?</p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t remember that.</p>
<p>Vaguely remember the stupid shirt.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We were like, you can&rsquo;t run.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t run as fast as we can.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the stretch of right between our house and our grandparents.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, I can too.</p>
<p>I remember her running and me thinking, you don&rsquo;t have the right bra on.</p>
<p>Darlene also made everything homemade.</p>
<p>Curtains, comforters, clothes.</p>
<p>And she made her daughters and other family members dolls</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t bear to display in their homes because they&rsquo;re so creepy,</p>
<p>but that they can&rsquo;t get rid of because they represent how much their mom loved them.</p>
<p>I literally have them in my attic and I try not to look at them.</p>
<p>I have one in my closet.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one that she was making for one of my cousins.</p>
<p>Darlene Hulse spent one day of her life as a victim.</p>
<p>But she had 28 years of being a friend and a sister and a daughter,</p>
<p>a wife and a wonderful mom.</p>
<p>She was a talented piano player,</p>
<p>an intelligent, natural leader who graduated the top of her classes.</p>
<p>And she was a woman who loved her kids so much</p>
<p>that she spent her last living moments fighting like hell to protect her daughters.</p>
<p>What else can we talk about?</p>
<p>Want to talk about Teddy Bear?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s Teddy Bear?</p>
<p>Teddy Bear&rsquo;s my puppy.</p>
<p>What color is he?</p>
<p>White.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s he do?</p>
<p>Um, um, don&rsquo;t want more people.</p>
<p>Mommy said pick up your toy and she&rsquo;s a good mommy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you later.</p>
<p>I love you, Mommy.</p>
<p>This might be the end of our series for now,</p>
<p>but Darlene&rsquo;s story is far from over.</p>
<p>We will keep investigating her murder</p>
<p>and we aren&rsquo;t done demanding action from investigators to solve it.</p>
<p>And this is where you come in.</p>
<p>We need each and every one of you to support Darlene&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>by signing a petition to have her evidence tested</p>
<p>and comparisons done in a timely manner.</p>
<p>We have a link for that petition directly in the show notes</p>
<p>and you can also find the link on DarleneHulse.com.</p>
<p>I also think there are some of you out there who can help us dig even deeper.</p>
<p>If the following people are listening,</p>
<p>please reach out to us by emailing thedeckataudiochuck.com.</p>
<p>Officer Fish, you were the first on the scene that day</p>
<p>and we have questions that the photos that we&rsquo;ve been given just can&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>We would love to talk to you.</p>
<p>I want to talk to that young man who was hunting in the woods that day her body was found.</p>
<p>Robert Ewing, I think you could quickly clear up the confusion we have</p>
<p>about your prescription and how it got into the yard.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s anyone who worked with Ron Hulse at Young Door in Plymouth</p>
<p>who remembers the day Darlene was abducted,</p>
<p>you might have valuable information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to talk to the Hulse&rsquo;s dog breeder.</p>
<p>Their dog Ling was with you at the time of Darlene&rsquo;s attack</p>
<p>and we wonder if her killer knew that the dog wouldn&rsquo;t be home.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to find out who would have known their dog was with you.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s anyone familiar with the people that we&rsquo;ve discussed in detail,</p>
<p>knowing more about their whereabouts and demeanors</p>
<p>around the time of Darlene&rsquo;s murder could be critical information.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also trying to get in touch with a former 911 dispatcher</p>
<p>from Fulton County, Indiana named Stephanie Miller.</p>
<p>You took a call regarding Darlene&rsquo;s abduction in 1984</p>
<p>that we think could be important to her case.</p>
<p>So we need to talk to you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d also be interested in talking to the people in the car</p>
<p>that passed by six-year-old Melissa on August 17th, 1984</p>
<p>near the intersection of US 31 and 20B Road in Argus, Indiana.</p>
<p>It would have been around 9.30 that morning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the people in the black town car</p>
<p>that were driving slow near Interstate 110 in Olive Trail on August 17th</p>
<p>between 9.30 and 10.</p>
<p>You likely saw the suspect vehicle along with Cindy Sellers</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d love to see what you remember.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d still love to talk to Dr. Rick Hoover.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it&rsquo;s time to reexamine your 1984 findings</p>
<p>regarding Darlene Hulse&rsquo;s autopsy.</p>
<p>And we need to know if the slides from her sexual assault kit</p>
<p>were preserved and can still be tested.</p>
<p>And to the Indiana State Police,</p>
<p>please expedite testing of blood and potential semen on Darlene&rsquo;s underwear.</p>
<p>And finally, if anyone listening has any information</p>
<p>about the August 17th, 1984 murder of Darlene Hulse in Argus, Indiana,</p>
<p>even if I didn&rsquo;t mention you above, please reach out.</p>
<p>Again, you can email us at thedeck.audiochuck.com.</p>
<p>That email is also in the show notes.</p>
<p>And please do not forget to sign the petition.</p>
<p>With your help, justice for Darlene could be right around the corner.</p>
