    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to talk about the psychology</p>
<p>and the biology of desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>Today happens to be Valentine&rsquo;s Day, 2022.</p>
<p>However, the themes we are going to discuss</p>
<p>pertain to desire, love, and attachment</p>
<p>on any given day.</p>
<p>And indeed, the mechanisms we are going to discuss</p>
<p>almost certainly were at play thousands of years ago,</p>
<p>hundreds of years ago,</p>
<p>and no doubt will still be at play in our minds</p>
<p>and in our bodies and in our psychologies</p>
<p>for the decades, centuries, and thousands of years to come.</p>
<p>Indeed, today I want to focus on core mechanisms</p>
<p>that lead individuals to seek out other individuals</p>
<p>with whom to mate with,</p>
<p>with whom to have children with or not,</p>
<p>with whom to enter short or long-term relationships with,</p>
<p>and perhaps to end those relationships</p>
<p>or to seek relationships on the side, so-called infidelity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not going to encourage</p>
<p>or discourage any of these behaviors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m simply going to cover the peer-reviewed scientific data</p>
<p>on all these aspects of desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to discuss how our childhood attachment styles,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>influence our adult attachment styles.</p>
<p>Yes, you heard that right.</p>
<p>How we attached or did not attach to primary caregivers</p>
<p>in our childhood has much to do with how we attach</p>
<p>or fail to attach to romantic partners as adults</p>
<p>because the same neural circuits,</p>
<p>the neurons and their connections in the brain and body</p>
<p>that underlie attachment between infant and caregiver,</p>
<p>between toddler and parent or other caregiver,</p>
<p>and during adolescence and in our teenage years</p>
<p>are repurposed for adult romantic attachments.</p>
<p>I know that might be a little eerie to think about,</p>
<p>but indeed that is true.</p>
<p>Now, the fortunate thing is that regardless</p>
<p>of our childhood attachment styles and experiences,</p>
<p>the neural circuits for desire, love,</p>
<p>and attachment are quite plastic.</p>
<p>They are amenable to change in response</p>
<p>to both what we think and what we feel</p>
<p>as well as what we do.</p>
<p>However, all three aspects that we&rsquo;re discussing today,</p>
<p>desire, love, and attachment</p>
<p>are also strongly biologically driven.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about biological mechanisms</p>
<p>such as hormones,</p>
<p>biological mechanisms such as neurochemicals,</p>
<p>things like dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin,</p>
<p>and neural circuits, brain areas,</p>
<p>and indeed areas of the body that interact with the brain</p>
<p>that control whether or not we desire somebody or not,</p>
<p>whether or not we lose or increase our desire</p>
<p>for somebody over time,</p>
<p>whether or not we fall in love,</p>
<p>what love means,</p>
<p>and whether or not the relationships we form</p>
<p>continue to include the elements of desire and love</p>
<p>over time or not.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate just how powerfully our biology</p>
<p>can shape our perception of the attractiveness</p>
<p>of other people,</p>
<p>I want to share with you the results of a couple of studies.</p>
<p>Both studies explore how people rate</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s attractiveness.</p>
<p>And in both studies,</p>
<p>the major variable is that women are at different stages</p>
<p>of their menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Now, in the first study,</p>
<p>men are rating the attractiveness of women</p>
<p>according to the smell of those women.</p>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;re not smelling them directly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re smelling clothing that women wore</p>
<p>for a couple of days at different phases</p>
<p>of their menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>And what they find is that men will rate the odors of women</p>
<p>as most attractive if those women wore those shirts,</p>
<p>that clothing, in the pre-ovulatory phase of their cycle.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is not to say that men do not find</p>
<p>women attractive at other stages of their cycle.</p>
<p>It is to say that men find women&rsquo;s odors</p>
<p>particularly attractive if those odors were worn by women</p>
<p>that are in the pre-ovulatory phase</p>
<p>of their menstrual cycle, okay?</p>
<p>Now, there was also a study that was done</p>
<p>where women at different stages of their menstrual cycle</p>
<p>are rating the odors of men.</p>
<p>And a similar but mirror symmetric result was found</p>
<p>such that women who are in the pre-ovulatory phase</p>
<p>of their menstrual cycle will rate men&rsquo;s odors</p>
<p>as more attractive than at other stages of their cycle.</p>
<p>So the simple way to put this is that there seems</p>
<p>to be something special about the pre-ovulatory phase</p>
<p>of a woman&rsquo;s menstrual cycle that makes men rate them</p>
<p>as more attractive during that time,</p>
<p>and women rate men as more attractive</p>
<p>during that particular time as well.</p>
<p>So this is a bi-directional effect.</p>
<p>The way that the second study was done</p>
<p>where women are rating men was not just to smell the odors</p>
<p>of those men on t-shirts, they did that,</p>
<p>but they correlated that with whether or not</p>
<p>the shirts were worn by men</p>
<p>that were particularly physically symmetrical.</p>
<p>They actually had these men divided into groups,</p>
<p>it was more of a continuum rather,</p>
<p>rated according to body symmetry and face symmetry.</p>
<p>And women preferred more symmetrical men</p>
<p>when they were doing the preference test</p>
<p>during the pre-ovulatory phase of their cycle.</p>
<p>So again, the point is that that pre-ovulatory phase</p>
<p>of the cycle seems to create</p>
<p>a bi-directional mutual attractiveness.</p>
<p>Now, also extremely interesting is that this effect</p>
<p>does really seem to have something to do with ovulation,</p>
<p>because in both studies, they had women</p>
<p>that were taking oral contraception or not,</p>
<p>and what they found was</p>
<p>if a woman is taking oral contraception,</p>
<p>it prevented that peak in perceived attractiveness</p>
<p>by the men, meaning men no longer perceived a woman</p>
<p>to be more attractive at a particular phase of their cycle.</p>
<p>And also, women taking oral contraception</p>
<p>no longer prefer the odors of more symmetrical men</p>
<p>during the pre-ovulatory phase of their cycle.</p>
<p>Now, I want to make sure that it&rsquo;s especially clear</p>
<p>that it is not the case that oral contraception</p>
<p>reduced the perception of a woman as attractive,</p>
<p>that did not happen in these studies.</p>
<p>It reduced the further increase</p>
<p>in a male&rsquo;s perception of her as attractive,</p>
<p>and if women took oral contraception,</p>
<p>it prevented them from preferring more symmetrical men</p>
<p>based on the odors of those men.</p>
<p>Now, I realize there are a lot of variables here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got odors, we&rsquo;ve got symmetry,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got menstrual cycle, pre-ovulatory, non-pre-ovulatory,</p>
<p>and we have whether or not</p>
<p>people are taking contraception or not.</p>
<p>But the basic finding is that depending on where women are</p>
<p>in their menstrual cycle influences</p>
<p>both men&rsquo;s perception of them as attractive</p>
<p>and their perception of men as attractive,</p>
<p>and oral contraception eliminates that effect.</p>
<p>So I share with you those data to illustrate</p>
<p>that we often think that somebody is attractive or not</p>
<p>based on, I don&rsquo;t know how they look,</p>
<p>their skin, their hair, et cetera,</p>
<p>but it also illustrates that their odor is a powerful cue</p>
<p>for some people more than others.</p>
<p>You know, some of us tend to be</p>
<p>more olfactory driven than others.</p>
<p>Although if you watched the Huberman Lab podcast episode</p>
<p>that I did with Professor David Buss</p>
<p>from the University of Texas, Austin,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a luminary in the field of evolutionary psychology</p>
<p>and has studied mate choice</p>
<p>and mate selection bias over decades.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really one of the founders of that field.</p>
<p>He emphasized findings that odor for many people</p>
<p>is a maker or a deal breaker.</p>
<p>Meaning there are some people that even if somebody</p>
<p>has all the characteristics that they&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>in terms of kindness and attractiveness and values</p>
<p>and other features that would and should be</p>
<p>of very high priority in selecting a mate,</p>
<p>that if someone does not like the way that person smells,</p>
<p>their innate body odor, independent of colognes and perfumes</p>
<p>and soaps, et cetera,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s often a complete and total deal breaker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are some of you that can relate to that.</p>
<p>And there are some of you perhaps for which</p>
<p>that is not the case.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t even imagine that being</p>
<p>such a powerful variable.</p>
<p>And yet the data suggests that indeed</p>
<p>it is a powerful variable for many people out there.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however,</p>
<p>part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost</p>
<p>to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system relevant</p>
<p>to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>And of course, these are topics</p>
<p>that grab tremendous interest,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s worth us defining our terms a little bit</p>
<p>before going any further.</p>
<p>Of course, we can have many different kinds of loves.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s romantic love.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s love of family, so-called familial love.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s love of pets.</p>
<p>We can even love objects,</p>
<p>or we can feel as if we love objects.</p>
<p>We can love certain activities.</p>
<p>We can have friends that we love, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The word love is used to encompass</p>
<p>a lot of different types of relationships.</p>
<p>Today, we are mainly going to be focused on romantic love</p>
<p>and the neural mechanisms of romantic love.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge here at the outset</p>
<p>that most of the studies of romantic love</p>
<p>have focused on monogamous heterosexual love.</p>
<p>And also, when we talk about studies focused on desire</p>
<p>and attractiveness and attachment, that&rsquo;s also the case.</p>
<p>And that simply reflects the general bias of the literature</p>
<p>over the last 50 to 100 years.</p>
<p>It does, of course, not rule out that similar</p>
<p>or different mechanisms could be at play</p>
<p>in non-monogamous relationships,</p>
<p>in homosexual relationships,</p>
<p>or in relationships of any kind or variation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth us defining our terms around desire.</p>
<p>It can mean lust.</p>
<p>It can mean the desire for long-term partnership.</p>
<p>So we need to define our terms.</p>
<p>And throughout, I will do my best</p>
<p>to very carefully define what I mean by desire,</p>
<p>what I mean by love, and what I mean by attachment.</p>
<p>The formal study of love and desire and attachment</p>
<p>goes back to the early 1900s.</p>
<p>One of the classic studies on this</p>
<p>is entitled Love and Desire.</p>
<p>It was published in 1912 and really focused</p>
<p>on two opposing themes within romance.</p>
<p>One is love, which in that paper</p>
<p>was really meant to include attachment</p>
<p>and dependence or interdependence between individuals.</p>
<p>And the other end of the spectrum being desire</p>
<p>or the sexual desire for another.</p>
<p>And romance was meant to encapsulate both those things,</p>
<p>love and desire.</p>
<p>And for much of the 1900s,</p>
<p>it was thought that love and desire</p>
<p>were on sort of opposing ends or in kind of a push-pull.</p>
<p>And it was the dynamic push and pull</p>
<p>between love and desire that one could define romance.</p>
<p>And that actually led to much of what&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>in the psychological literature.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to explore</p>
<p>some neurobiological studies,</p>
<p>some studies of the endocrine system,</p>
<p>meaning the hormone system,</p>
<p>that actually support that general model.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll point you toward what I think</p>
<p>is a very useful book in thinking about</p>
<p>how relationships can both form and last</p>
<p>over long periods of time,</p>
<p>and how those relationships can include</p>
<p>both desire and interdependence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also talk about some studies</p>
<p>that have really focused on why relationships succeed</p>
<p>and why they fail and how that relates</p>
<p>to whether or not there is sufficient amounts</p>
<p>of attachment and desire.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to talk about the science</p>
<p>and indeed you&rsquo;ll also get some tools.</p>
<p>Those tools should be useful to you,</p>
<p>whether or not you happen to be in a relationship or not,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re seeking a relationship or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to begin with an anecdote,</p>
<p>and this is not an anecdote about my relationship history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a anecdote about my scientific history.</p>
<p>When I started graduate school,</p>
<p>the chairman of the department I was in at the time</p>
<p>said to me, you know, most PhDs last longer</p>
<p>than most marriages.</p>
<p>And indeed he was right.</p>
<p>And also most marriages in this country end in divorce.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s about 50% with a slight skew</p>
<p>toward more ending in divorce than persist</p>
<p>until death do them part.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it&rsquo;s about half.</p>
<p>And most marriages end before the eight-year period is up.</p>
<p>Most PhDs take anywhere from four to nine years.</p>
<p>So there was a bit of a smearing of averages there,</p>
<p>but the point he was trying to make</p>
<p>really landed home for me.</p>
<p>It did not scare me out of relationships,</p>
<p>nor did it scare me out of a PhD, obviously.</p>
<p>What it did illustrate was that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about our attachment machinery</p>
<p>that can be very, very compelling,</p>
<p>such that people take on tremendous levels of commitment.</p>
<p>I have to imagine that most people enter marriages</p>
<p>assuming that they&rsquo;re going to stay in those marriages.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think most people enter marriages</p>
<p>thinking they&rsquo;re going to get divorced,</p>
<p>but that if 50% of those commitments end in divorce,</p>
<p>there must also be mechanisms</p>
<p>by which our attachments can break.</p>
<p>And today we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>both the forming of attachments</p>
<p>and the breaking of attachments,</p>
<p>what can prevent those breaks and attachments,</p>
<p>and indeed what can lead to reattachments.</p>
<p>There are biological mechanisms</p>
<p>to desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s abundantly clear.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a robust and very large literature</p>
<p>in animal models.</p>
<p>What I mean by that are field studies and laboratory studies</p>
<p>in primates of different kinds,</p>
<p>such as macaque monkeys or bonobos.</p>
<p>People have looked at these sorts of things,</p>
<p>believe it or not, in ducks, in laboratory mice,</p>
<p>in different types of birds, et cetera.</p>
<p>And if you look at that literature,</p>
<p>you can essentially find biological examples</p>
<p>in the animal kingdom for just about any behavior</p>
<p>that you can easily map to human behavior.</p>
<p>So for instance, there&rsquo;s a species of animal</p>
<p>called the prairie vole.</p>
<p>In one portion of the United States,</p>
<p>this prairie vole species is monogamous.</p>
<p>They only mate with one other prairie vole,</p>
<p>only raise young with one other prairie vole</p>
<p>for their entire life.</p>
<p>And in another region of the United States,</p>
<p>the same species of animal, the prairie vole,</p>
<p>will mate with many individuals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re non-monogamous.</p>
<p>And the major difference, at least as far as we know,</p>
<p>between the prairie voles in one location</p>
<p>and another location is the levels</p>
<p>of a molecule called vasopressin in the brain and body.</p>
<p>Vasopressin is present in humans.</p>
<p>It has numerous biological roles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s responsible, for instance,</p>
<p>for controlling the amount of urine that you excrete,</p>
<p>the amount of water that you retain,</p>
<p>and for sexual desire, as well as mate-seeking.</p>
<p>Levels of vasopressin in prairie voles</p>
<p>are strongly determinant of whether or not</p>
<p>a prairie vole is going to be monogamous or non-monogamous.</p>
<p>Why do I raise this?</p>
<p>Well, I raise this because the literature on prairie voles</p>
<p>is quite beautiful and has been discussed quite a lot</p>
<p>in the popular press.</p>
<p>You can look it up with an easy,</p>
<p>easily just a web engine search.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find lots of information about this,</p>
<p>lots of news articles about this,</p>
<p>and lots of interpretations as to how vasopressin</p>
<p>might be involved in similar</p>
<p>or different mechanisms in humans.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t have a problem</p>
<p>with mapping animal studies to humans.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s certainly a place for that.</p>
<p>But if we just sort of lean back</p>
<p>and look at the giant mass of studies in animals</p>
<p>and their mating behavior and their mate selection behavior,</p>
<p>you can essentially find examples of anything.</p>
<p>You can find examples of polygamy.</p>
<p>You can find examples of cheating, of infidelity.</p>
<p>You can find examples of all sorts of different behaviors</p>
<p>that in your own mind, you can map to human behavior.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really hard to make the leap from animal models</p>
<p>to humans in any kind of direct way.</p>
<p>And so thankfully, there&rsquo;s been tremendous work done</p>
<p>in the last mainly 20 years or so</p>
<p>looking at human mate selection, human desire,</p>
<p>human love, and human attachment.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re mainly going to focus on those studies today.</p>
<p>And where appropriate, we will map those findings</p>
<p>back to the findings in animals</p>
<p>to see if there&rsquo;s some universal truths</p>
<p>or some universal principles</p>
<p>about how the neural circuits</p>
<p>and biological mechanisms work.</p>
<p>But by and large, we&rsquo;re going to focus on human studies today</p>
<p>so unless I say otherwise,</p>
<p>the data that I&rsquo;m referring to today</p>
<p>are entirely from human beings.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about attachment and attachment styles.</p>
<p>And this will offer you the opportunity</p>
<p>to answer some important questions for yourself,</p>
<p>such as what is my, meaning your,</p>
<p>attachment style in relationship?</p>
<p>One of the most robust findings in the field of psychology</p>
<p>is this notion of attachment styles.</p>
<p>And this was something that was discovered</p>
<p>through a beautiful set of studies</p>
<p>that were done by Mary Ainsworth in the 1980s,</p>
<p>in which she developed a laboratory condition</p>
<p>called the strange situation task.</p>
<p>Now, the strange situation task has been studied</p>
<p>over and over again in different cultures,</p>
<p>in different locations throughout the world.</p>
<p>And in preparing for this episode,</p>
<p>I actually spoke to three different psychologists.</p>
<p>I spoke to a psychoanalyst,</p>
<p>I spoke to a cognitive behavioral psychologist,</p>
<p>and I actually spoke to a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>excuse me, not a psychologist,</p>
<p>but a psychiatrist with a medical degree and asked,</p>
<p>is the strange situation task</p>
<p>and the various attachment styles</p>
<p>that emerge from that task,</p>
<p>are those still considered valid?</p>
<p>And indeed, all three of them said,</p>
<p>if ever there was a literature in psychology</p>
<p>that is absolutely tamped down and has a firm basis</p>
<p>in both data and real world principles</p>
<p>and real world examples,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this notion of attachment styles.</p>
<p>So what is the strange situation task?</p>
<p>The strange situation task involves a parent,</p>
<p>typically a mother in the studies that were done,</p>
<p>but a parent or other caregiver bringing their child,</p>
<p>their actual child into a laboratory.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a room with a stranger</p>
<p>and the mother enters the room with the child</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some toys in the room.</p>
<p>And typically the mother and the stranger will talk.</p>
<p>Obviously the stranger is part of the experiment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just some random person off the street.</p>
<p>And the child is allowed to move about the room.</p>
<p>They can observe the mother interacting</p>
<p>with the other person or not.</p>
<p>They can play with toys or not.</p>
<p>But then at some point, the mother leaves.</p>
<p>And then at some point later,</p>
<p>designated by the experimenter, the mother comes back.</p>
<p>And what is measured in these studies</p>
<p>is both how the child, the toddler,</p>
<p>reacts to the mother leaving</p>
<p>and how the child reacts to the mother returning</p>
<p>at the end of the experiment.</p>
<p>And oftentimes this will have two or three different phases</p>
<p>where the mother will bring the child in, then leave,</p>
<p>then come back in and leave.</p>
<p>There are also studies in which the behavior</p>
<p>of the child with the stranger is also examined.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of variations of this,</p>
<p>but the basic findings are that toddlers, children,</p>
<p>fall into four different categories of attachment style.</p>
<p>And that these attachment styles can predict many features</p>
<p>of adolescent, teen, young adult,</p>
<p>and even adult attachment styles,</p>
<p>not in strange situations</p>
<p>of the sort that I just described,</p>
<p>but in romantic attachments.</p>
<p>I should mention also that attachment style is plastic,</p>
<p>meaning it can change across the lifespan.</p>
<p>So as I described the results,</p>
<p>I described the different attachment styles</p>
<p>that are out there.</p>
<p>And if any of those resonate with you</p>
<p>or bring to mind certain people in your life,</p>
<p>please do not assume that those attachment styles</p>
<p>are rigid and fixed for the entire lifespan.</p>
<p>There are also terrific data that indicate</p>
<p>that through specific processes,</p>
<p>both psychological and some biological adjustments,</p>
<p>that people can change their attachment style.</p>
<p>And that indeed people who have different attachment styles</p>
<p>can change the attachment styles of others.</p>
<p>But just to make very clear</p>
<p>what the results of the study were,</p>
<p>I want to review what the four different</p>
<p>attachment styles are.</p>
<p>And typically people fall into one group or another,</p>
<p>but not several.</p>
<p>So the four patterns of attachment</p>
<p>that were revealed by these studies,</p>
<p>again were revealed by examining the behavior of the child</p>
<p>in response to the mother leaving and the mother returning</p>
<p>and the child&rsquo;s response to the stranger</p>
<p>that is in the room with them.</p>
<p>The first style is the so-called secure attachment style.</p>
<p>In the nomenclature of this kind of study,</p>
<p>these are the so-called B babies</p>
<p>as in the letter B, bulldog, B.</p>
<p>Not for bulldogs, but just to designate this category.</p>
<p>The secure attachment style is one in which the child</p>
<p>will engage with the stranger, with the experimenter,</p>
<p>while the parent is present in the room.</p>
<p>But that when the parent, typically it&rsquo;s a mother,</p>
<p>but when the parent or other caregiver leaves,</p>
<p>the child does get visibly upset.</p>
<p>They might whine, they might cry,</p>
<p>they might even tantrum a bit.</p>
<p>However, when the caregiver,</p>
<p>meaning the mother or father or other caregiver returns,</p>
<p>the child visibly expresses happiness</p>
<p>that the caregiver has returned.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the hallmark of the secure attachment style.</p>
<p>And again, this is all pre-verbal.</p>
<p>This is happening long before the child can express</p>
<p>how they feel with words.</p>
<p>And the interpretation of this is that the secure child</p>
<p>feels confident that the caregiver is available</p>
<p>and will be responsive to their needs</p>
<p>and their communications.</p>
<p>So that when the child whines and or is distressed,</p>
<p>the parent doesn&rsquo;t come right back into the room,</p>
<p>but at some point they do.</p>
<p>And they seem to have a sense of trust</p>
<p>that if the parent or caregiver leaves,</p>
<p>that the parent will come back</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re happy that they do.</p>
<p>These children are also very good</p>
<p>at exploring novel environments after the parent is gone</p>
<p>and while the parent is there.</p>
<p>And almost always when the parent is there,</p>
<p>they will explore more broadly, literally in space.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll venture out further than they will</p>
<p>when the parent is gone.</p>
<p>They also tend to engage with the caregiver in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not immediately and completely trusting,</p>
<p>but that over time seems to evolve</p>
<p>from one in which they&rsquo;re kind of suspicious of this person</p>
<p>to one in which they&rsquo;re at least somewhat trusting.</p>
<p>Okay, so those are the general contours</p>
<p>of the secure attachment style.</p>
<p>And fortunately, nowadays there are physiological studies</p>
<p>measuring things like heart rate and breathing</p>
<p>and other measures that correlate</p>
<p>with the subjective assessment</p>
<p>of what these children are feeling.</p>
<p>Okay, so first category is secure attached.</p>
<p>The second category is a so-called anxious avoidant</p>
<p>or insecurely attached, which are the category A babies.</p>
<p>The children with anxious avoidant</p>
<p>insecure attachment patterns generally tend to avoid</p>
<p>or ignore the caregiver, all right, meaning the parent,</p>
<p>and show very little emotion</p>
<p>when the parent leaves or returns.</p>
<p>So this is the reason they call them avoidant</p>
<p>or anxious avoidant and kind of insecure.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t this happiness or joy that the parent is back.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t seem to express that.</p>
<p>They do not exhibit distress on separation.</p>
<p>And they generally tend to have some tendency</p>
<p>to approach the caregiver when they return,</p>
<p>but there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a general expression of joy.</p>
<p>And again, physiological measures support that as well.</p>
<p>Things like changes in heart rate tend to be less dramatic</p>
<p>in the anxious avoidant insecure attachment style</p>
<p>than in the secure attachment style.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s the second one.</p>
<p>The third category is the so-called anxious ambivalent</p>
<p>slash resistant insecure category.</p>
<p>Okay, I didn&rsquo;t name these categories.</p>
<p>So you have to blame others in this one instance.</p>
<p>For everything else, blame me.</p>
<p>But in this instance, you have to blame the psychologists</p>
<p>that named this category.</p>
<p>The anxious ambivalent slash resistant insecure category,</p>
<p>also called the C babies for the letter C</p>
<p>just as a categorization.</p>
<p>The anxious ambivalent resistant insecure toddlers really</p>
<p>show distress even before separation from their mother</p>
<p>or other caregiver.</p>
<p>And they tend to be very clingy and difficult to comfort</p>
<p>when the caregiver returns.</p>
<p>Okay, so they&rsquo;re distressed even before the mother</p>
<p>leaves the room.</p>
<p>And they tend to be very clingy and really hard to calm down</p>
<p>when the mother returns.</p>
<p>They tend to show either what seems to be resentment</p>
<p>in response to the parent&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know what they&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>or some sort of helpless passivity.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually subcategorizations</p>
<p>that the psychologists have come up with,</p>
<p>with C1 subtypes and C2 subtypes.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to get bogged down in that.</p>
<p>But just know that there isn&rsquo;t one absolute measure</p>
<p>that says, oh, well, this person is anxious ambivalent</p>
<p>resistant insecure.</p>
<p>They could be somewhat passive or they could be</p>
<p>somewhat angry at the caregiver.</p>
<p>But the basic idea is that before and after the separation</p>
<p>they are clingy and difficult to comfort.</p>
<p>They just can&rsquo;t seem to calm themselves down.</p>
<p>And physiological measures of heart rate</p>
<p>and hormone measurements such as cortisol</p>
<p>also support that statement.</p>
<p>And the third category of attachment style</p>
<p>is the so-called disorganized or disoriented</p>
<p>or D for the letter D babies.</p>
<p>This is a categorization that was added later</p>
<p>to this strange situation task.</p>
<p>That is a real hallmark of developmental psychology studies.</p>
<p>It was developed by Mary Ainsworth graduate student,</p>
<p>Mary Maine, who I actually had the great fortune</p>
<p>of taking a course from and learning from</p>
<p>when I was a graduate student at Berkeley many years ago.</p>
<p>And this fourth categorization was controversial</p>
<p>for a while, but now is generally accepted.</p>
<p>The key feature of the disorganized disoriented category</p>
<p>is that the toddlers tend to be tense</p>
<p>and they tend to encompass a lot of</p>
<p>kind of odd physical postures.</p>
<p>They tend to hunch their shoulders.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll put their hands behind their neck.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll cock their head to the side.</p>
<p>For those of you listening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing this on the video version.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not where you don&rsquo;t have to go see that.</p>
<p>But for those of you that are watching this on video,</p>
<p>they tend to kind of constrain their body size a bit</p>
<p>and go into odd postures that they normally</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do anywhere else.</p>
<p>So this is why it&rsquo;s called the disorganized</p>
<p>or disoriented category.</p>
<p>It seems like these children just don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>how to react to a separation.</p>
<p>And they just start to manifest behaviors</p>
<p>and emotional tones that aren&rsquo;t observed</p>
<p>in other situations.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve got our four categories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try and use the shortest possible names</p>
<p>for each category.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got category one, which is securely attached.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got category two, which is insecurely attached,</p>
<p>also sometimes called anxious avoidant.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ve got category three,</p>
<p>which is the resistant insecure category,</p>
<p>which is anxious ambivalent.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this fourth category,</p>
<p>the disorganized disoriented category</p>
<p>or the so-called D babies.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting about this from the perspective</p>
<p>of desire, love, and attachment</p>
<p>is that the categorizations of children</p>
<p>into one of these four different categories as toddlers</p>
<p>is strongly predictive of their attachment style</p>
<p>in romantic partnerships later in life,</p>
<p>which is to me, both amazing and surprising</p>
<p>and not surprising all at the same time.</p>
<p>Amazing because it means that, first of all,</p>
<p>we are relatively hardwired for attachment.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s incredible and beautiful</p>
<p>that we have designated neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>and hormonal systems that are there to ensure</p>
<p>that we have some sort of response</p>
<p>to a caregiver being there or not being there</p>
<p>or returning or leaving,</p>
<p>but also that the same neural circuitries,</p>
<p>the same hormonal responses are at least in some way</p>
<p>repurposed for entirely different types of attachments</p>
<p>later in life.</p>
<p>So when we hear the psychologists talk about how,</p>
<p>you know, we formed a template early in life</p>
<p>based on experiences that were even pre-verbal</p>
<p>before we had language,</p>
<p>and those templates are superimposed on our relationships</p>
<p>or we should say our later relationships</p>
<p>are superimposed on those templates,</p>
<p>there really is a basis for that.</p>
<p>We now have neuroimaging studies to support,</p>
<p>for instance, the work of Alan Shore from UCLA</p>
<p>showing that when a mother and child interact</p>
<p>either through very soothing interactions</p>
<p>like bottle feeding or breastfeeding</p>
<p>or singing to one&rsquo;s baby or putting them to sleep,</p>
<p>that the brain of the child and the brain of the mother</p>
<p>are entering a coordinated state of relaxation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not one direction, mother to child,</p>
<p>the child is also calming the mother.</p>
<p>Typically these studies were done with mothers,</p>
<p>again, sometimes with fathers, but typically with mothers.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>when the mother or other caregiver acts very excited</p>
<p>and raises their voice or puts a lilt in their voice</p>
<p>or widens their eyes, that the child will do the same.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s a bidirectional interaction</p>
<p>in that case of excitement.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the release of neurochemicals</p>
<p>like dopamine into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>whereas in the relaxation scenario</p>
<p>and the soothing scenario there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we know the release of things like serotonin and oxytocin.</p>
<p>So the neural systems for attachment</p>
<p>and the neural systems for what we call autonomic arousal</p>
<p>for being alert and calm, don&rsquo;t act in a vacuum.</p>
<p>They are tethered to other people in our environment.</p>
<p>And of course we know this, right?</p>
<p>We sometimes hear the statement,</p>
<p>no one can make you feel anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a little bit of a problem</p>
<p>with that statement.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m contradicting anyone in particular,</p>
<p>but you hear that a lot.</p>
<p>No one can make you feel anything.</p>
<p>Indeed they can, right?</p>
<p>A physical injury can make you feel something.</p>
<p>If somebody says something that you very much like,</p>
<p>it can make you feel something.</p>
<p>And if somebody says something that you very much dislike,</p>
<p>it will make you feel something.</p>
<p>So the idea that no one can make us feel anything</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t actually true.</p>
<p>Our nervous system is tethered</p>
<p>to the nervous systems of others.</p>
<p>And that is true from the very earliest stages</p>
<p>of our lives.</p>
<p>And in this case, we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>how our templates for attachment in romantic relationships,</p>
<p>how we find them, how we maintain them,</p>
<p>and indeed how we break them and reform them</p>
<p>is based on a template that was established</p>
<p>through an entirely different set of priorities,</p>
<p>which was how we feel safe and secure in novel environments,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not our primary caregiver</p>
<p>is there or not.</p>
<p>Neuroimaging supports that.</p>
<p>When I say neuroimaging, I mean, brain scans support that.</p>
<p>Measures of hormones in the body and brain support that.</p>
<p>Measures of neurochemicals support that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s simply no way around this truth</p>
<p>that we have a set of roadmaps in our mind</p>
<p>that are reused for entirely different purposes</p>
<p>later in life.</p>
<p>That is vitally important to understand</p>
<p>because if one is successful in forming</p>
<p>romantic attachments, maintaining them, et cetera,</p>
<p>or not, does in fact reflect the earlier templates</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before,</p>
<p>the good news is that these templates can shift over time.</p>
<p>And one of the more powerful ways</p>
<p>to shift those templates over time</p>
<p>is purely by the knowledge that they exist</p>
<p>and the understanding that those templates are malleable.</p>
<p>They can change through the process of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Again, neuroplasticity is just a rewiring</p>
<p>of nerve connections that is very much present in childhood,</p>
<p>but also very much present in adulthood.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who you think falls</p>
<p>into category one, two, three, or four,</p>
<p>or you know somebody or involved with somebody</p>
<p>who falls into category one, two, three, and four,</p>
<p>the mere knowledge of that can be very useful.</p>
<p>But you might ask, well, what do I do with that knowledge?</p>
<p>Well, fortunately, both psychologists and biologists</p>
<p>have started to leverage that knowledge</p>
<p>toward establishing better, more secure bonds</p>
<p>in adult romantic relationships.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a book that has really tapped into this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the first book</p>
<p>that has really addressed this head on.</p>
<p>And that book comes from two Columbia professors.</p>
<p>And the title of the book is</p>
<p>Attached, The New Science of Adult Attachment</p>
<p>and How It Can Help You Find and Keep Love.</p>
<p>The authors of this book are Amir Levine and Rachel Heller.</p>
<p>Again, both of them are skilled academics and researchers</p>
<p>who have really taken the literature that I described</p>
<p>on the strange situation task</p>
<p>and mapped it to adult attachment styles.</p>
<p>And also they&rsquo;ve mapped out ways</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve observed in their clinical practice</p>
<p>and that is laboratory supported for, for instance,</p>
<p>people that have an anxious ambivalent</p>
<p>or what we would call an insecure attachment style</p>
<p>or for people that fall into the disorganized</p>
<p>or disoriented attachment style,</p>
<p>how they can modify that attachment style</p>
<p>in or out of relationships</p>
<p>in order to establish what I think everybody wants,</p>
<p>which is secure attachment.</p>
<p>Why does everybody want that?</p>
<p>Well, secure attachment allows people</p>
<p>to be both in relationship</p>
<p>or if they choose to be on their own</p>
<p>or to be in relationship,</p>
<p>but physically separated from somebody else</p>
<p>or even emotionally separated from somebody else</p>
<p>and maintain what we call a stable autonomic equilibrium,</p>
<p>the ability to remain calm, clear headed.</p>
<p>You might not like what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re able to navigate that</p>
<p>with some sense of clarity and not excessive discomfort.</p>
<p>So is there a goal in all of this stuff</p>
<p>about love, desire, and attachment?</p>
<p>Indeed, there is.</p>
<p>The secure attachment style is the one</p>
<p>that leads to the most stable</p>
<p>and predictable long-term relationships.</p>
<p>Put differently, babies, toddlers, adolescents,</p>
<p>teens, and young adults that have a secure attachment style</p>
<p>are more likely to find and form long-term relationships</p>
<p>than are people in the other categories.</p>
<p>But people in other categories can learn</p>
<p>and eventually migrate into the secure attachment style.</p>
<p>And I think that book, Attached,</p>
<p>I have no affiliation to the authors or the book itself.</p>
<p>I should just mention that.</p>
<p>Attached, the new science of adult attachment</p>
<p>and how it can help you find and keep love.</p>
<p>Really, it sounds very pop psychology-esque,</p>
<p>but it is really grounded</p>
<p>in the research psychology literature.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also some interesting biology there.</p>
<p>Another point to make about attachment styles</p>
<p>is that it is possible,</p>
<p>and some of you may be familiar with circumstances</p>
<p>whereby people who are securely attached,</p>
<p>either because they grew up in an environment</p>
<p>where secure attachment was cultivated</p>
<p>or because they developed that on their own,</p>
<p>can also migrate out of the securely attached category</p>
<p>into insecurely attached</p>
<p>or into avoidant types of attachment styles</p>
<p>as teens or as young adults</p>
<p>or as adults at any age or any stage of life,</p>
<p>by virtue of being with somebody who has a different,</p>
<p>perhaps less adaptive attachment style, right?</p>
<p>What this means is that if you have</p>
<p>or you develop a secure attachment style,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s vitally important to protect that attachment style</p>
<p>because it is possible to become anxiously attached</p>
<p>even if you grew up in a stable attachment framework.</p>
<p>And again, this can happen at any stage.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in attachment styles</p>
<p>and how they influence adult romantic attachments,</p>
<p>and certainly if you are a parent,</p>
<p>I would encourage you to check out the book, Attached.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s quite good.</p>
<p>And I think that it offers a number of actionable tools</p>
<p>to both form and hold on to secure attachment styles.</p>
<p>So I mentioned that the neural circuits</p>
<p>for child parent or child caregiver attachment</p>
<p>are repurposed for romantic attachment later in life.</p>
<p>But what are these neural circuits?</p>
<p>What do they do?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so attractive, if you will,</p>
<p>to think about a brain area that controls love</p>
<p>or a brain area that controls desire</p>
<p>or a brain area that controls attachment,</p>
<p>but it simply doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve talked about before on this podcast,</p>
<p>and I will say again and again,</p>
<p>because it will persist to be true long after I&rsquo;m gone,</p>
<p>is that no one brain area can give rise</p>
<p>to anything as complex as desire, love, or attachment.</p>
<p>Instead, there are multiple brain areas</p>
<p>that through their coordinated action</p>
<p>create a sort of a song that we call desire</p>
<p>or a song that we call love</p>
<p>or a song that we call attachment, not a literal song,</p>
<p>although there are songs about desire, love, and attachment,</p>
<p>of course, many songs, some good, some not so good,</p>
<p>but rather different brain areas being active</p>
<p>in different sequences and with different intensities</p>
<p>can make us feel as if we are in the mode</p>
<p>that we call desire or in the mode of love</p>
<p>or in the mode of attachment.</p>
<p>But beneath all of that</p>
<p>is this element of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>And I want to focus on autonomic arousal</p>
<p>just for a bit longer,</p>
<p>because it really is one of the three core elements</p>
<p>by which we form and maintain loving attachments</p>
<p>and by which we break loving attachments.</p>
<p>The autonomic nervous system, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>is automatic.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s what autonomic means.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s actually the case</p>
<p>that we can control our autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>to some degree or another,</p>
<p>but the autonomic nervous system controls things</p>
<p>like digestion, our breathing,</p>
<p>whether or not we&rsquo;re conscious of that breathing or not,</p>
<p>it controls things like how alert we are</p>
<p>or how sleepy we are.</p>
<p>And the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>as I just briefly described earlier,</p>
<p>is really something that we come into the world with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hardwired, all the elements are there,</p>
<p>but through interactions with our parent,</p>
<p>either soothing interactions or fun, playful interactions,</p>
<p>or dare I say, scary interactions,</p>
<p>our autonomic nervous system gets tuned up,</p>
<p>meaning we each develop a tendency</p>
<p>to either be more alert and anxious or more calm</p>
<p>or kind of a balance of alert and calm.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this changes across each day</p>
<p>and depending how tired we are late in the day,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;ve been awake for a while, we tend to get sleepy,</p>
<p>early in the day, if we&rsquo;re very rested,</p>
<p>we tend to wake up and feel very alert.</p>
<p>So the way to think about the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s kind of a seesaw.</p>
<p>We go back and forth between being very alert,</p>
<p>we can be alert and calm, or we can be very, very alert,</p>
<p>we can be in a state of panic, we can be fast asleep,</p>
<p>so we can be extremely calm,</p>
<p>or we can just be kind of sleepy, semi-calm,</p>
<p>but still also alert.</p>
<p>So think about it like a seesaw,</p>
<p>and that seesaw has a hinge,</p>
<p>and that hinge defines how tight or loose that seesaw is,</p>
<p>how readily it can tilt back and forth.</p>
<p>Our autonomic tone is how tight that hinge is,</p>
<p>and there are biological mechanisms to explain this,</p>
<p>but here, I just want to stay with the analogy</p>
<p>of the seesaw for now.</p>
<p>The interactions between child and caregiver early in life</p>
<p>take the child and the caregiver</p>
<p>from one end of the seesaw to the other,</p>
<p>from being very alert in a state of play, for instance,</p>
<p>to being nursed and being very soothed until we go to sleep.</p>
<p>And of course, we each have a seesaw,</p>
<p>the parent and the child has a seesaw,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re interacting.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, there are beautiful studies,</p>
<p>and beautiful, not in the sense</p>
<p>that they focused on a pleasant topic,</p>
<p>but beautiful because they were done so beautifully well,</p>
<p>that looked at, for instance,</p>
<p>the response of mothers and their physiologies,</p>
<p>and the response of children and their physiologies</p>
<p>during the bombing of cities during World War II.</p>
<p>So an unpleasant situation,</p>
<p>but what was revealed during the course of these studies</p>
<p>was that if the mothers were very stressed</p>
<p>during an onslaught of bombing of the city,</p>
<p>the children&rsquo;s physiologies tended to be stressed also,</p>
<p>and persisted in being stressed</p>
<p>long after that stressful episode was done.</p>
<p>They actually followed these children well out</p>
<p>for many decades afterwards.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the parent, and in this case, again,</p>
<p>it was mothers that were explored in these studies,</p>
<p>had turned this whole business</p>
<p>of going into the bomb shelters</p>
<p>into somewhat of a game, right?</p>
<p>Taking it seriously,</p>
<p>but essentially telling the children,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s time to go,</p>
<p>but not expressing much stress or distress.</p>
<p>The children also didn&rsquo;t develop much stress</p>
<p>or distress or trauma.</p>
<p>Now, there were exceptions to this, of course,</p>
<p>but in general, that was the rule</p>
<p>that the autonomic nervous systems of children</p>
<p>tend to mimic the autonomic nervous systems</p>
<p>of the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>And the mechanisms by which this occurs has been explored.</p>
<p>And again, I just referred to the beautiful work</p>
<p>of Alan Shore at University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>And again, his name is Shore, spelled S-C-H-O-R-E.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking down briefly at the floor here</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll just reach for the book.</p>
<p>He has a wonderful book called Right Brain Psychotherapy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit technical,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re interested in some of the studies,</p>
<p>this book, Right Brain Psychotherapy,</p>
<p>details how everything from nursing of children</p>
<p>to playtime behavior to strange situation type task behavior</p>
<p>that we talked about before,</p>
<p>which of course occurs when children get dropped off</p>
<p>at daycare or nursery school or with babysitters, et cetera.</p>
<p>And indeed, all types of caregiver child interactions</p>
<p>tune up that autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>so that the child ends up with an autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that either tends to lean more towards alert and anxious</p>
<p>or can be very alert but calm</p>
<p>or can be very calm and hard to budge.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s the tightness of that hinge</p>
<p>that really underlies these attachment styles</p>
<p>that we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>And not on this episode of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but on many other previous episodes,</p>
<p>such as the Master Stress episode</p>
<p>or some of the Optimize Health episodes.</p>
<p>You can find these if you want at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>A lot of the tools and techniques</p>
<p>that are recommended there</p>
<p>have to do with readjusting the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>in deliberate ways as an adult.</p>
<p>Again, I won&rsquo;t go into the specific tools,</p>
<p>but for instance, the physiological psi,</p>
<p>this tool that I&rsquo;ve talked about extensively</p>
<p>of two inhales through the nose</p>
<p>as deeply as you can on the first one,</p>
<p>sneaking in a little bit more air on the second one,</p>
<p>and then a long exhale through the mouth</p>
<p>is a way of adjusting that autonomic seesaw.</p>
<p>It tends to make us more calm.</p>
<p>It activates what we call the parasympathetic arm</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>which is just fancy nerd speak</p>
<p>for it&rsquo;s a quick way to calm yourself down, right?</p>
<p>Things like ice baths or cold showers or cold immersion</p>
<p>or deliberate hyperventilation by contrast</p>
<p>are ways in which we can deliberately increase</p>
<p>the level of our so-called sympathetic</p>
<p>arm of our autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>make ourselves more alert.</p>
<p>Why would you want to do that?</p>
<p>Well, you can do that to be more alert,</p>
<p>to be more awake if you like,</p>
<p>or as a form of self-induced stress inoculation,</p>
<p>to be able to tolerate higher levels of adrenaline</p>
<p>by making it a practice that you self-direct.</p>
<p>The reason those tools are out there</p>
<p>is because many of us, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to blame anyone,</p>
<p>but because of our childhood templates,</p>
<p>because of things that happened and didn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>in terms of our interactions with caregivers,</p>
<p>have autonomic nervous systems that are tilted</p>
<p>to one side or the other more than we would like,</p>
<p>or in which the hinge that I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>in this analogy is too loose or that is too tight.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re sort of stuck in a mode of anxiousness</p>
<p>or stuck in a mode of lack of energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what those tools are really about.</p>
<p>But at a deeper level,</p>
<p>the autonomic nervous system is really the system</p>
<p>that governs how we will react in response</p>
<p>to a romantic partner being present or leaving.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean leaving the relationship</p>
<p>entirely, although it could mean that, right?</p>
<p>We know people, I&rsquo;m sure you know people,</p>
<p>that upon the end of a relationship</p>
<p>that they wanted very much are absolutely crushed.</p>
<p>And actually in researching this episode there,</p>
<p>I discovered there&rsquo;s an extensive literature finding</p>
<p>that the feelings that one has after a breakup</p>
<p>are very much like a clinical depression in many cases.</p>
<p>But there are individuals that can look at a breakup</p>
<p>as a transient event that they don&rsquo;t interpret</p>
<p>as going to mean so much for all aspects of their life</p>
<p>or reshaping their view of themselves.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, we have different levels of autonomic function.</p>
<p>And depending on where our seesaw is, if you will,</p>
<p>some of us become extremely distraught</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t recalibrate ourselves,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t adjust ourselves down from stress to calm,</p>
<p>or can&rsquo;t take ourselves from exhausted to more alert</p>
<p>if we need to do that on our own.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why tools for doing that exist.</p>
<p>But attachment itself is about</p>
<p>where our autonomic nervous system resides.</p>
<p>So if I were to offer a set of tools</p>
<p>around these topics of desire, love, and attachment,</p>
<p>I would say, first of all,</p>
<p>you might want to think about whether or not</p>
<p>you fall into the secure, insecure,</p>
<p>or other attachment styles.</p>
<p>Second, I think it is vitally important for all of us,</p>
<p>but certainly for people that are in relationships</p>
<p>or seeking relationships to be able to</p>
<p>at least have some recognition</p>
<p>of where our autonomic nervous system tends to reside,</p>
<p>both in terms of when we are with somebody</p>
<p>and when they leave.</p>
<p>When we are apart for long periods of time,</p>
<p>can we calm ourselves?</p>
<p>Can we self-soothe?</p>
<p>Or are we very much dependent on the presence of another</p>
<p>in order to feel soothed?</p>
<p>Now, I absolutely want to emphasize</p>
<p>that there is nothing wrong.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s everything right</p>
<p>with feeling great in the presence of somebody else.</p>
<p>That is actually a hallmark</p>
<p>of strong and quality attachments.</p>
<p>These days, we hear the term codependent a lot.</p>
<p>This was a, I believe the term was first coined</p>
<p>by Pia Melody,</p>
<p>and it actually does occupy an important role</p>
<p>in the world of trauma, trauma healing,</p>
<p>so-called trauma bonding, topics of another episode.</p>
<p>I actually did an episode on fear and trauma,</p>
<p>and we will do one all about trauma bonding</p>
<p>with an expert at some point in the future.</p>
<p>But codependence and codependency,</p>
<p>the term can sometimes be misinterpreted</p>
<p>as any dependence on another isn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>Interdependence, healthy interdependence,</p>
<p>of course, is good.</p>
<p>It is the hallmark of healthy child-parent relations,</p>
<p>sibling relations, and romantic relations.</p>
<p>But a key element of healthy interdependence</p>
<p>is that, yes, our autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>is adjusted by the presence of another,</p>
<p>but that also that we can adjust</p>
<p>our own autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>even in the absence of that person,</p>
<p>that if the person goes away temporarily or permanently,</p>
<p>that we can still regulate our own autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>both from states of stress to states of calm,</p>
<p>both from states of exhaustion to states of more alertness.</p>
<p>And of course, we all need sleep</p>
<p>to go from exhaustion to alertness.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m referring to here</p>
<p>is the ability to regulate when distraught</p>
<p>or regulate when fatigued or feeling depressed.</p>
<p>And that is and is all about the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>So as we talk about attachment styles</p>
<p>and we talk about infant and toddler</p>
<p>and adult attachment styles,</p>
<p>what we are really talking about</p>
<p>is a complex set of neural circuitries.</p>
<p>And one of those neural circuitries,</p>
<p>which is absolutely crucial,</p>
<p>is this autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>So if the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>is one key component of desire, love, and attachment,</p>
<p>what are the other two?</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m going to tell you next</p>
<p>is largely the pioneering work of Helen Fisher,</p>
<p>who is really an anthropologist</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s become a bit of a neuroscientist</p>
<p>and has collaborated with neuroscientists</p>
<p>to establish brain areas and neural circuits</p>
<p>that are associated with different aspects</p>
<p>of attachment, love, and desire.</p>
<p>I think the first really high quality study</p>
<p>of neural circuits associated with these themes</p>
<p>was a paper published in 2005</p>
<p>in a very fine anatomical journal,</p>
<p>perhaps the best neuroanatomical journal,</p>
<p>which is the Journal of Comparative Neurology.</p>
<p>The Journal of Comparative Neurology</p>
<p>has been around for more than 100 years</p>
<p>and is considered the archival location</p>
<p>for placing really high quality anatomy.</p>
<p>They have tremendously high standards.</p>
<p>And the study that I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>is entitled Romantic Love,</p>
<p>an fMRI, meaning Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging,</p>
<p>Study of a Neural Mechanism for Mate Choice.</p>
<p>And Dr. Fisher is a author on this paper,</p>
<p>as is Arthur Aaron and Lucy Brown.</p>
<p>So all very fine researchers.</p>
<p>And this study, as well as several other studies</p>
<p>using magnetic resonance imaging,</p>
<p>things like EEG, neuroanatomical tracing, et cetera,</p>
<p>have identified a large number of brain areas</p>
<p>that are associated with different aspects</p>
<p>of desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just throw out a few names of those brain areas</p>
<p>and what they control.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll tell you how those anchor</p>
<p>to the other two categories of neural circuits</p>
<p>essential for desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>So not surprisingly, the dopamine system in the brain</p>
<p>is associated with desire, love, and attachment,</p>
<p>and mainly with desire, although to some extent love.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a neurochemical,</p>
<p>sometimes associated with reward.</p>
<p>But as some of you have heard me say before,</p>
<p>it is mainly a molecule of motivation, craving, and pursuit.</p>
<p>And that motivation, craving, and pursuit</p>
<p>that relates to dopamine is not unique to attachment</p>
<p>or love or sex or mating, et cetera.</p>
<p>It is a universal generic currency in the brain</p>
<p>for pursuing something.</p>
<p>Food when you&rsquo;re hungry, a mate when you want one,</p>
<p>to mate when you want to, warmth when you&rsquo;re cold,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera, okay?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not for one specific purpose,</p>
<p>but the brain areas associated with dopamine involve,</p>
<p>for instance, the ventral tegmental area,</p>
<p>the substantia nigra, areas of that sort,</p>
<p>the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know these names.</p>
<p>Just understand that these are networks of neurons</p>
<p>that tend to put the person, you,</p>
<p>into a state of forward action and pursuit</p>
<p>and craving and motivation.</p>
<p>They are not about being quiescent, relaxed, et cetera.</p>
<p>The neural circuits for quiescence and relaxation</p>
<p>are most associated with love and attachment,</p>
<p>not surprisingly.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re the neurochemical serotonin,</p>
<p>and to some extent, oxytocin</p>
<p>are the predominant neurochemicals involved.</p>
<p>And those are released from brain areas</p>
<p>such as the raphe nucleus in the back of the brain.</p>
<p>You may have heard that the majority of serotonin</p>
<p>in your body is made in your gut.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s true, but I hate to break it to you.</p>
<p>The serotonin in your gut is not responsible</p>
<p>for your feelings of love and attachment,</p>
<p>at least not to a high degree.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mainly going to be the reflection of neurons</p>
<p>in your brain that make serotonin.</p>
<p>And there are other areas of the brain</p>
<p>that make serotonin as well, and oxytocin as well,</p>
<p>but they tend to be associated</p>
<p>with the kind of warmth and calm</p>
<p>and the soothing that we feel in the presence of another.</p>
<p>And again, these are not strictly divided circuits.</p>
<p>We can have dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>present in our brain and body at the same time</p>
<p>to equal or different degrees.</p>
<p>And we will return in a little bit to what happens</p>
<p>when levels of dopamine are very high</p>
<p>and levels of serotonin are low and vice versa and so on,</p>
<p>including in states of neurochemically modified states,</p>
<p>as it were, in when we talk about things like MDMA,</p>
<p>so-called ecstasy.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, I want to just discuss</p>
<p>the two neural circuits that use dopamine,</p>
<p>that use serotonin and oxytocin,</p>
<p>and that collaborate with the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>to drive what we call desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>And the three circuits are autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>we talked about that one.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the nervous system components</p>
<p>or the neural circuits for empathy,</p>
<p>for being able to see and respond to</p>
<p>and indeed match the emotional tone</p>
<p>or the autonomic tone of another.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the third category,</p>
<p>and this might surprise some of you,</p>
<p>it certainly surprised me,</p>
<p>but the data point to the fact that the third neural circuit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very important for establishing bonds</p>
<p>is one associated with positive delusions.</p>
<p>So given that the neural circuits for empathy</p>
<p>are absolutely crucial for falling in love</p>
<p>and maintaining stable attachments,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about those neural circuits</p>
<p>and what they are.</p>
<p>Now, often when we hear empathy,</p>
<p>we think, oh, empathy is really about listening to</p>
<p>and really understanding what somebody else is feeling,</p>
<p>maybe even feeling what they&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>but what do we mean by that, right?</p>
<p>What is it to feel what another feels?</p>
<p>Well, what it means is that their seesaw</p>
<p>is driving your seesaw</p>
<p>or your seesaw is somehow driving their seesaw,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a match in terms of the tilt of those seesaws.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be an exact match, right?</p>
<p>If someone that you really care about is very, very stressed</p>
<p>you could also become very stressed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a form of empathic matching.</p>
<p>And there are indeed neural circuits for that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll describe what those neural circuits are in a moment.</p>
<p>But sometimes the best role for us to take</p>
<p>is actually one in which we are calm</p>
<p>when the person that we care about</p>
<p>or that we are romantically involved with</p>
<p>is very, very anxious.</p>
<p>And in a few minutes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about how matching of emotional tone</p>
<p>can be good or bad for the stability of a relationship.</p>
<p>And complementarity of autonomic matching</p>
<p>can be good or bad.</p>
<p>In other words, sometimes it&rsquo;s beneficial</p>
<p>for a relationship to go into the same state as the other.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s more beneficial for us</p>
<p>to not go into the same state as the other.</p>
<p>But the important feature here</p>
<p>is that when we talk about emotional matching or empathy</p>
<p>or going into the same state</p>
<p>or not going into the same state,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re really talking about</p>
<p>is whether or not the autonomic seesaw of one individual</p>
<p>is driving the autonomic seesaw of the other individual.</p>
<p>And this is a vital principle</p>
<p>for how we fall in love and form attachments.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually part of the desire</p>
<p>and mating process itself.</p>
<p>I would go so far as to say</p>
<p>that one of the prerequisites</p>
<p>to the propagation and expansion of our species</p>
<p>is this notion of autonomic regulation</p>
<p>and to some extent matching of autonomic nervous systems.</p>
<p>Let me explain what I mean.</p>
<p>Last I checked,</p>
<p>the only way that new humans can be created</p>
<p>is by way of sperm meeting egg,</p>
<p>either in body or in dish,</p>
<p>but sperm meets egg.</p>
<p>And then typically nine months later, we have a human baby.</p>
<p>The process of bringing sperm to egg, right?</p>
<p>Mating behavior, sex behavior in humans</p>
<p>is one of autonomic regulation.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that</p>
<p>is the process of finding a mate.</p>
<p>And in this case,</p>
<p>I mean actually someone to mate with typically,</p>
<p>while scenarios vary,</p>
<p>typically is one of elevated autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>meaning increased activation</p>
<p>of the so-called sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>This is related to dopamine release</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s related to epinephrine release.</p>
<p>There has to be a pursuit</p>
<p>or at least there has to be a mobilization</p>
<p>to arrive in the same location whereby one can mate, right?</p>
<p>That almost always is the case.</p>
<p>However, the sexual arousal itself</p>
<p>is in both males and females</p>
<p>is actually driven primarily</p>
<p>by the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>So while pursuit is one of alertness</p>
<p>and sympathetic drive, as we say,</p>
<p>again, sympathy is not really what&rsquo;s at play here.</p>
<p>The word simpa means together</p>
<p>and the activation of the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>toward more alert state</p>
<p>is because of a sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>meaning the co-activation together of many neurons</p>
<p>in the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<p>But then the actual physiological arousal state</p>
<p>that we call sexual arousal</p>
<p>is predominantly parasympathetically driven, okay?</p>
<p>To be quite direct about this,</p>
<p>if the sympathetic nervous system activation is too high,</p>
<p>the sexual arousal response cannot happen</p>
<p>in either males or in females, it&rsquo;s inhibited.</p>
<p>However, the orgasm and ejaculation response,</p>
<p>which if you think about it is required</p>
<p>for sperm to meet egg is sympathetic driven.</p>
<p>And then after orgasm and ejaculation,</p>
<p>the parasympathetic nervous system kicks back in</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a calming and relaxation.</p>
<p>So the arc of mating involves sympathetic arousal, okay?</p>
<p>Not sympathy, but alertness and arousal for pursuit.</p>
<p>Then a tilt of the seesaw, at least to some degree</p>
<p>for arousal of the sort that we typically hear of,</p>
<p>of sexual arousal.</p>
<p>Then at the point of orgasm and ejaculation</p>
<p>is back to a sympathetic response.</p>
<p>And how can I say that?</p>
<p>How do I know that?</p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>meaning neurons within the sympathetic arm</p>
<p>or the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>are what drive ejaculation and orgasm.</p>
<p>And then afterward, there&rsquo;s a return</p>
<p>to increased parasympathetic activation.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know for sure why that happens,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s thought that in species that pair bond,</p>
<p>humans generally pair bond, not always,</p>
<p>the return to more parasympathetic activation</p>
<p>after orgasm and ejaculation</p>
<p>is thought to increase the exchange of pheromonal odors</p>
<p>and to increase pillow talk</p>
<p>and pair bonding of different kinds, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the seesaw going back and forth</p>
<p>is actually built into the process</p>
<p>by which our entire species propagates.</p>
<p>So in some ways, every human is required</p>
<p>to navigate that process</p>
<p>if they want their offspring to persist.</p>
<p>And of course, nowadays there are technologies</p>
<p>like in vitro fertilization, intrauterine insemination.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways that technology</p>
<p>has allowed people to circumvent</p>
<p>the actual physical mating process</p>
<p>in the way that I described.</p>
<p>But by and large, that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>And certainly that&rsquo;s the way it was done historically</p>
<p>for if not tens of thousands</p>
<p>or hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
<p>That process is also what happens</p>
<p>in all mammalian species that mate, okay?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m overlooking an entire literature of animal studies</p>
<p>that classic studies of this were done by two individuals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just briefly mention them</p>
<p>in case you want to look at the literature.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy at the Rockefeller University</p>
<p>named Donald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F,</p>
<p>who has done beautiful studies</p>
<p>identifying the neural circuitry</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called the lordosis response.</p>
<p>Unlike in humans, the mating behavior of animals</p>
<p>is rather stereotyped in terms of the positions</p>
<p>that they occupy.</p>
<p>And the lordosis response is a kind of a U-shaping</p>
<p>or a bending up of the hindquarters of typically of rodents,</p>
<p>but of other animals as well.</p>
<p>The male mounting is almost always from behind</p>
<p>except in some species of primates.</p>
<p>And that lordosis response is only going to occur</p>
<p>during particular phases of the estrous cycle.</p>
<p>The estrous cycle is sort of the analog</p>
<p>to the menstrual cycle, but it&rsquo;s not 28 days,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s four days or some other duration in other animals,</p>
<p>depending on the animal.</p>
<p>The lordosis response is strongly regulated by odors,</p>
<p>by contact, and is estrogen and testosterone controlled.</p>
<p>And then the male portion of the mating sequence in animals,</p>
<p>the mounting and thrusting and ejaculation</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re called are mounting, thrusting, intromission,</p>
<p>and ejaculation.</p>
<p>Those are the four scientific categories</p>
<p>that have been described.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s presence in rodents and also in dogs</p>
<p>where it was primarily studied by Frank Beach,</p>
<p>who was at University of California, Berkeley</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>And the entire literature around the neural circuitry</p>
<p>for sexual and mating behavior in animals largely stemmed</p>
<p>from the work of Donald Pfaff and Frank Beach</p>
<p>and their scientific offspring,</p>
<p>not their actual offspring.</p>
<p>You can look at that literature if you like.</p>
<p>There have been human neuroimaging studies</p>
<p>of the process that I described a few minutes ago,</p>
<p>believe it or not, of people in brain scanners,</p>
<p>not necessarily mating with other people,</p>
<p>but going through that arc of arousal,</p>
<p>sympathetic activation during orgasm or ejaculation,</p>
<p>and then the post ejaculatory or orgasmic phase</p>
<p>in both men and women.</p>
<p>And the brain areas associated with those</p>
<p>have all been mapped out now.</p>
<p>The spinal cord areas that control things like erection,</p>
<p>vaginal lubrication, ejaculation, and orgasm,</p>
<p>those have also been mapped out.</p>
<p>And this has all been explored from the perspective</p>
<p>of both basic science, just to get an understanding</p>
<p>of how our species has sexual interactions and reproduces,</p>
<p>but also from the perspective of, for instance,</p>
<p>trying to repair sexual function after spinal cord injury,</p>
<p>which is a prominent concern for a lot of people,</p>
<p>depending on where they have their injury,</p>
<p>but in the number of people that have spinal cord injuries.</p>
<p>So this is both vital biological and clinical data.</p>
<p>The neural circuits for everything that I just described</p>
<p>reside in the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>and are coordinated with the neural circuits</p>
<p>that are associated with empathy.</p>
<p>The neural circuits for empathy, again, there are many,</p>
<p>but mainly two structures that you should know about,</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>which is how we perceive things outside of us</p>
<p>and make decisions on the basis of those perceptions,</p>
<p>how we organize those decisions,</p>
<p>and an area of the brain called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.</p>
<p>The insula is a really interesting brain area</p>
<p>that allows us to interocept,</p>
<p>to pay attention to what&rsquo;s going on inside our body,</p>
<p>and to split some of our attention to exterocept.</p>
<p>And the mating dance,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s the dinner and date portion</p>
<p>of the mating dance,</p>
<p>or the actual physical dance part of the mating dance,</p>
<p>or actual mating and sexual behavior,</p>
<p>kissing or otherwise,</p>
<p>that is a coordinated activity of two bodies.</p>
<p>Typically it&rsquo;s two.</p>
<p>I realize sometimes it&rsquo;s more, sometimes it&rsquo;s only one,</p>
<p>but typically it&rsquo;s two bodies,</p>
<p>at least in the framework we&rsquo;re using here.</p>
<p>That coordinated dance is one in which</p>
<p>the autonomic nervous system of one individual in general</p>
<p>is coordinating with the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>of the other individual,</p>
<p>and the insula is essentially splitting one&rsquo;s attention</p>
<p>between how we feel ourselves,</p>
<p>how our body feels, what we&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>with the thinking and the bodily sensations of the other.</p>
<p>And that can be communicated obviously through words,</p>
<p>it can be communicated through sounds,</p>
<p>it can be communicated through touch,</p>
<p>and it can be communicated through a number</p>
<p>of kind of more subtle cues like pupil size,</p>
<p>or whether or not,</p>
<p>certainly in cases where we recognize the person</p>
<p>and we kind of know their responses,</p>
<p>their autonomic responses under different conditions,</p>
<p>we can assess, is the person comfortable?</p>
<p>Are they uncomfortable?</p>
<p>Are they more focused on me or on themselves?</p>
<p>This is the coordinated silent dance</p>
<p>that if we look at in neurobiological terms,</p>
<p>we can really see is all about the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s time to tip the seesaw</p>
<p>to one side or the other,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not the other person&rsquo;s seesaw</p>
<p>is tilted higher or lower than the other.</p>
<p>Okay, so we have the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>and then we have this thing that we&rsquo;re calling empathy,</p>
<p>which is really about autonomic matching.</p>
<p>And again, the insula and the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>are neural circuits that are crucial for autonomic matching,</p>
<p>because they allow us to say what&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>and do I want to match to it or not, okay?</p>
<p>And then the third category of neural circuit</p>
<p>that Helen Fisher and others have found to be important</p>
<p>for desire, love, and attachment</p>
<p>is the neural circuit associated with self-delusion.</p>
<p>What do we mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, self-delusion implies a kind of cynicism</p>
<p>about love and attachment.</p>
<p>And I think it was George Bernard Shaw that said,</p>
<p>love is really about overestimating</p>
<p>the differences between individuals.</p>
<p>Actually, when I hear that, and as I say it,</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like that quote.</p>
<p>I have no bone to pick with George Bernard Shaw,</p>
<p>but what it suggests, and I think what he meant</p>
<p>was that in love and attachment,</p>
<p>we tend to put so much value in the other</p>
<p>that we forget that many of the processes</p>
<p>that are going on in our brain and body</p>
<p>actually could be evoked by many other people too.</p>
<p>But I think it somewhat overlooks</p>
<p>the enormous power of attachment</p>
<p>and the ways in which somebody&rsquo;s smell,</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s voice, somebody&rsquo;s everything,</p>
<p>or somebody&rsquo;s particular thing or things</p>
<p>can really become so vital</p>
<p>for our autonomic nervous system to feel soothed</p>
<p>and to feel elated, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I think that while the quote is accurate in the one sense,</p>
<p>I think it does overlook the neural circuits for attachment</p>
<p>and just how deeply wired those can become for us.</p>
<p>So I will balance that quote</p>
<p>with an enormous number of other quotes</p>
<p>that I won&rsquo;t mention, but that you can find out there</p>
<p>that really point to how incredible the person is</p>
<p>that one tends to be attached to,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s really only one or several people</p>
<p>that could ever exist</p>
<p>that could evoke those feelings from us.</p>
<p>And of course you can read your Neruda poetry</p>
<p>and you can find these things all over the place</p>
<p>in music and poetry and writing.</p>
<p>So for every cynical quote</p>
<p>about these neural circuits being generic</p>
<p>could be activated by anybody,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll find an ample number of opposing quotes</p>
<p>that these neural circuits can only be activated</p>
<p>by that special someone or that particular person</p>
<p>or maybe in just a small set of those people.</p>
<p>So what of delusion?</p>
<p>Well, the work of Helen Fisher and others</p>
<p>has really pointed to the fact that desire, love,</p>
<p>and attachment are three separate phases</p>
<p>of what we call romantic relationships</p>
<p>that typically, not always,</p>
<p>but typically desire tends to come first</p>
<p>or falls in the early phase,</p>
<p>that the process of romantic slash sexual interactions,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be sex itself,</p>
<p>but certainly something that involves intimacy of some kind</p>
<p>and generally touch of some kind</p>
<p>eventually transitions into what we call love,</p>
<p>which eventually transitions into what we call attachment.</p>
<p>And I should just mention touch</p>
<p>because touch is a fundamental aspect of this whole process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an article, a research article, I should say,</p>
<p>the title of it is</p>
<p>Relationship-Specific Encoding of Social Touch</p>
<p>in Somatosensory and Insular Cortices,</p>
<p>cortices being cortex, cortex is plural, cortices.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s our friend, the insula.</p>
<p>So this is a study that explored what brain areas</p>
<p>and what body areas are activated</p>
<p>by specific forms of attachment and social touch.</p>
<p>And what they found, not surprisingly,</p>
<p>is that the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with touch, the somatosensory areas,</p>
<p>but more interestingly,</p>
<p>the insula cortex are strongly activated by touch.</p>
<p>So touch and the amount of touching</p>
<p>and proximity and skin contact,</p>
<p>not surprisingly activates brain areas</p>
<p>associated with somatosensory touch,</p>
<p>but also the insular cortex,</p>
<p>which again is this brain area that links the internal,</p>
<p>our feelings about what&rsquo;s going on inside us</p>
<p>and at the surface of our skin with events external.</p>
<p>And they found activation of a number of brain areas,</p>
<p>the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and so on and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not as essential as just understanding</p>
<p>that the insula is the place in which we start</p>
<p>to take our experience of our internal landscape,</p>
<p>attach that to our perceptions of the external landscape,</p>
<p>and then assign that a value</p>
<p>or assign that some sort of interpretation.</p>
<p>And positive delusion is predictive</p>
<p>of long-term attachment.</p>
<p>What do we mean by positive delusion?</p>
<p>Positive delusion is the contradiction</p>
<p>of that George Bernard Shaw quote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the belief that only this person</p>
<p>can make me feel this way.</p>
<p>This other person holds the capacity</p>
<p>to make me feel this way physically</p>
<p>or emotionally or both.</p>
<p>And so as we move from desire to love to attachment,</p>
<p>our brain circuitry is literally getting tuned up</p>
<p>such that that individual that we happen to be attached to,</p>
<p>again, here thinking about monogamous relationships,</p>
<p>but I guess for non-monogamous relationship,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be individuals, is and are the way</p>
<p>in which our autonomic nervous system can be regulated.</p>
<p>They actually get access to our control panel.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s our autonomic nervous system, empathy,</p>
<p>and this positive delusion.</p>
<p>Now, positive delusion is critical.</p>
<p>If you look at the stability of relationships over time,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s been extensively studied</p>
<p>mainly by psychologists, but now also by neurobiologists,</p>
<p>what you find is that there are some key features</p>
<p>of interactions between individuals</p>
<p>that predict that a relationship will last.</p>
<p>And those are many, but mainly fall</p>
<p>under this category of positive delusions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll return to those and what those exactly look like,</p>
<p>but there are also just a handful of things</p>
<p>that predict that a relationship will fail over time.</p>
<p>This is largely the work of the Gottmans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a husband and wife team</p>
<p>up at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>
<p>The Gottmans have run a laboratory</p>
<p>in the department of psychology for a long time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also done a lot of public facing work</p>
<p>around relationships.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve talked about the various aspects</p>
<p>of relationships and interactions between people</p>
<p>that predict either staying together or breaking up.</p>
<p>So much so that they&rsquo;ve established a method</p>
<p>by which they can look at video interactions</p>
<p>between couples and with very high degree of certainty,</p>
<p>predict whether or not those couples will stay together</p>
<p>or break up over time.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve identified what they call</p>
<p>the four horsemen of relationships.</p>
<p>These are things that essentially almost always predict</p>
<p>that a couple will break up.</p>
<p>And I think the current number on this</p>
<p>is that Gottman can predict divorce with 94% accuracy,</p>
<p>which if you think about it is pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>So even though these are purely psychological studies,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any analysis of underlying physiology.</p>
<p>There are some things that they can observe between couples</p>
<p>that can lead them to predict</p>
<p>whether or not a couple will stay together</p>
<p>or break up with 94% accuracy.</p>
<p>So what are those things?</p>
<p>Those four behaviors,</p>
<p>what they call the four horsemen of the apocalypse</p>
<p>for relationships are one, criticism,</p>
<p>two, defensiveness, three, stonewalling,</p>
<p>and four, contempt.</p>
<p>With contempt being the most powerful predictor</p>
<p>of breaking up.</p>
<p>Criticism, of course, does not mean</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no place for criticism</p>
<p>in stable relationships.</p>
<p>Of course there is.</p>
<p>It has to do with how frequent</p>
<p>and how intensely that criticism is voiced.</p>
<p>Defensiveness, of course, is defensiveness.</p>
<p>We know as the sort of lack of ability to hear another</p>
<p>or to adopt their stance.</p>
<p>So lack of empathy, I think,</p>
<p>is one way to interpret defensiveness.</p>
<p>Stonewalling, which is actually another form</p>
<p>of lack of empathy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a turning off of this neural circuit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so critical for desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>The stonewalling essentially means the emotional response</p>
<p>or the request of another is completely cut off.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s been brain imaging of this,</p>
<p>but I think we can reasonably imagine</p>
<p>that it involves untethering your insular response</p>
<p>from the other and what they&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>and focusing your insular response, no pun intended,</p>
<p>on your own internal state</p>
<p>or perhaps the state of someone else entirely.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about infidelity in a moment.</p>
<p>And then contempt.</p>
<p>And contempt has actually been referred to</p>
<p>as the sulfuric acid of relationship.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that, but Gottman and colleagues have,</p>
<p>that it is such a powerful predictor</p>
<p>of divorce and breakups in the future.</p>
<p>And contempt, of course, by definition,</p>
<p>is the feeling that a person or thing</p>
<p>is beneath consideration, worthlessness,</p>
<p>or deserving scorn.</p>
<p>And apparently they can identify this</p>
<p>in the videos of couples having discussions</p>
<p>and interacting by very elaborate eye rolls,</p>
<p>by expressions of anger in one individual</p>
<p>when their partner is actually expressing enthusiasm</p>
<p>or excitement about something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, oh yeah, you would say that,</p>
<p>or deep-seated resentment toward the other,</p>
<p>so much so that it&rsquo;s apparent</p>
<p>that one kind of actively dislikes the other partner.</p>
<p>So contempt, disregard for something</p>
<p>that should be taken into account</p>
<p>is the other way to think about it,</p>
<p>runs counter to all of the neural circuits,</p>
<p>all three of the neural circuits</p>
<p>that we talked about before.</p>
<p>It certainly is, it is the antithesis of empathy.</p>
<p>It is anything but a positive delusion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really looking at the other individual</p>
<p>either accurately or inaccurately</p>
<p>as somebody that you kind of despise.</p>
<p>And then it is an absolute inversion</p>
<p>of the autonomic seesaw matching</p>
<p>that I was talking about before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dissociating of your seesaw from their seesaw.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very excited about something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re unexcited by it.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s an inversion of their seesaw</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re excited, you&rsquo;re down.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re down, you&rsquo;re up, okay?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically an inversion of all of the neural circuits</p>
<p>that Helen Fisher and others have identified</p>
<p>as critical for desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>And therefore it&rsquo;s not surprising</p>
<p>that it is so strongly predictive of breakups</p>
<p>and in the case of married couples of divorce.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in the work of the Gottmans and similar work,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve written several popular books.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fairly easy to find.</p>
<p>We can link to one of those in the caption,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve also developed</p>
<p>some quite interesting online resources</p>
<p>in their so-called love lab.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s fortunate that they didn&rsquo;t call it</p>
<p>the hate lab or the breakup lab</p>
<p>because they focused a lot on what predicts breakups,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve also written extensively</p>
<p>and researched extensively in peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>what makes people find appropriate partners for them</p>
<p>and to maintain those partnerships over time.</p>
<p>So you can go, you can search for love lab,</p>
<p>University of Washington, Gottman,</p>
<p>or any number of their various books.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll find some useful resources there.</p>
<p>I want to shift back to the work of Helen Fisher.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s made some very interesting statements</p>
<p>and some very interesting observations</p>
<p>that at least to my mind,</p>
<p>map very well onto the knowledge of neural circuitry,</p>
<p>both in humans and in non-human primates</p>
<p>and in other species.</p>
<p>I realized that she&rsquo;s not the only name in the game,</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s made some observations</p>
<p>that I think are very, as we say, parsimonious,</p>
<p>meaning they allow us to organize a lot of this stuff</p>
<p>into some distinct frameworks.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also done some really beautiful studies</p>
<p>that involve data from millions</p>
<p>or even tens of millions of individuals on dating sites.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to share those with you in a moment.</p>
<p>But before I do that,</p>
<p>I just want to paraphrase Dr. Fisher,</p>
<p>who said that sex drive or desire,</p>
<p>the pursuit of someone to mate with,</p>
<p>meaning to mate the verb, not necessarily to find a mate,</p>
<p>may be, she didn&rsquo;t say definitively,</p>
<p>but maybe a way to forage for potential love partners,</p>
<p>that the arc of this whole business</p>
<p>is really the order that we&rsquo;re describing it,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s desire, then love, and then attachment.</p>
<p>And that oftentimes people can get confused.</p>
<p>You may know some of these people,</p>
<p>you may be one of these individuals</p>
<p>who might confuse desire for attachment</p>
<p>or might confuse love for attachment,</p>
<p>but that there&rsquo;s a sequence of recruitment</p>
<p>of these neural circuits that&rsquo;s established first</p>
<p>from the pursuit of someone to mate with.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s placed us in the context</p>
<p>of kind of more modern dating themes</p>
<p>where depending on culture,</p>
<p>people might explore several, maybe many, many individuals</p>
<p>before, quote unquote, settling down with somebody,</p>
<p>at least for some period of time.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an interesting framework</p>
<p>because it circumvents a lot of the, frankly,</p>
<p>unanswerable questions about whether or not,</p>
<p>you know, humans were meant to be monogamous</p>
<p>or whether or not they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Those are conversations that hold cultural context,</p>
<p>that hold all sorts of context</p>
<p>that really can&rsquo;t be addressed in a laboratory setting.</p>
<p>But this idea that sex drive is a way to forage</p>
<p>for potential love partners,</p>
<p>and that love is a kind of a litmus test</p>
<p>for whether or not longer term</p>
<p>or deeper attachments can and will form</p>
<p>is one that at least makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Later in the episode,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about this notion of sex drive and desire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll actually talk about some tools</p>
<p>that have very strong data really to support them</p>
<p>in terms of things that people can do or take</p>
<p>to increase libido, both men and women,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s actually quite good data on that now.</p>
<p>But in the meantime,</p>
<p>I want to talk about some of the work</p>
<p>that Dr. Fisher has done in terms of categorizing people</p>
<p>into, again, we have four groups.</p>
<p>These are distinct from the A, B, C, and D</p>
<p>attachment styles described earlier.</p>
<p>Although as I described them,</p>
<p>you might be able to map them somewhat onto those.</p>
<p>And these four groups are groups</p>
<p>that were defined through her studies</p>
<p>of people that were, or are,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they were,</p>
<p>or if they are still on match.com,</p>
<p>but a very extensive data set.</p>
<p>So again, millions,</p>
<p>if not tens of millions of individuals.</p>
<p>The number, I heard her quote,</p>
<p>and forgive me if this is not accurate,</p>
<p>is that in upwards of 40 million individuals,</p>
<p>in terms of whether or not their neurochemical</p>
<p>and hormone systems are tuned</p>
<p>toward particular types of behaviors.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, both men and women, males and females,</p>
<p>have both testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>Typically, again, these are averages,</p>
<p>but typically men have more testosterone</p>
<p>than they do estrogen,</p>
<p>and they have more testosterone than do women,</p>
<p>and less estrogen than do women.</p>
<p>Typically women have more estrogen</p>
<p>than they do testosterone.</p>
<p>Again, averages.</p>
<p>And they have less testosterone than men,</p>
<p>more estrogen than men,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But both hormone systems are active</p>
<p>in both sets of individuals.</p>
<p>And of course, all humans, as far as we know,</p>
<p>manufacture both dopamine and serotonin.</p>
<p>Dopamine, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>has a number of effects in the brain and body,</p>
<p>but one of the primary effects</p>
<p>is that it places us into states of motivation and pursuit.</p>
<p>There is a somewhat close relationship</p>
<p>between the dopamine system</p>
<p>and the testosterone system in the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>this brain area above the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>and the pituitary gland,</p>
<p>which is responsible for making hormones</p>
<p>that make the ovaries and or testes</p>
<p>secrete testosterone or estrogen.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of signaling that occurs</p>
<p>such that dopamine and testosterone</p>
<p>tend to operate as kind of close cousins</p>
<p>in a system of pursuit.</p>
<p>And conversely, the serotonin system</p>
<p>tends to, on average, collaborate with the estrogen system</p>
<p>to impart certain physiological functions and behaviors.</p>
<p>So these aren&rsquo;t hard and fast,</p>
<p>or I guess better stated,</p>
<p>these aren&rsquo;t strict black and white categorizations,</p>
<p>but I think those general themes hold</p>
<p>when you look at the animal and human data.</p>
<p>So Dr. Fisher has taken some liberties,</p>
<p>but I think they are what I would call</p>
<p>logically and scientifically</p>
<p>and neurobiologically grounded liberties</p>
<p>in classifying individuals who are on these dating sites</p>
<p>according to the types of things they report</p>
<p>about themselves and the type of people</p>
<p>they tend to match with on these dating sites</p>
<p>and created these four categories.</p>
<p>The four categories are,</p>
<p>she calls one the dopamine category.</p>
<p>So these are people who would have high dopamine.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s just a name.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they have low anything else,</p>
<p>but they are high on the dopamine scale.</p>
<p>People who rate high on the dopamine scale</p>
<p>tend to be what the scientists and psychologists</p>
<p>call high sensation seeking, novel seeking.</p>
<p>They like new things.</p>
<p>They like spontaneity.</p>
<p>They tend to be very adventurous.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s largely true.</p>
<p>If you look at conditions</p>
<p>where dopamine is super physiological,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s elevated beyond normal levels,</p>
<p>things like mania,</p>
<p>or when people take certain drugs of abuse</p>
<p>like cocaine or amphetamine</p>
<p>that really raise dopamine levels up very, very high</p>
<p>for some period of time,</p>
<p>they do tend to increase energy motivation</p>
<p>and novelty seeking.</p>
<p>And of course, drugs like amphetamine and cocaine</p>
<p>have all sorts of deleterious effects</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t need to go into here,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s worth pointing out.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t tend to make people calm and relaxed</p>
<p>and seek soothing interactions.</p>
<p>Conversely, the group that Dr. Fisher calls</p>
<p>the serotonin group</p>
<p>tend to be more grounded in soothing activities,</p>
<p>quiescent type activities.</p>
<p>They actually tend to be on average,</p>
<p>they tend to like rules and follow rules.</p>
<p>They tend to be homebodies, this sort of thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really, you can imagine them</p>
<p>the sort of stable types,</p>
<p>but they really like stability.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really into spontaneity as much, again, averages.</p>
<p>And then she created two other categories,</p>
<p>the testosterone category of high testosterone.</p>
<p>This again, could be males or females.</p>
<p>And then the estrogen category,</p>
<p>again, could be males or females.</p>
<p>And she gave these different names</p>
<p>that I won&rsquo;t go into here.</p>
<p>You can look up her work online,</p>
<p>but names like the director</p>
<p>and the follower and things like that.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t really want to use those</p>
<p>as much as I want to stick to the biological terms.</p>
<p>So we have dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, and estrogen.</p>
<p>Now that might seem like an unfair</p>
<p>kind of over-generalization,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s interesting is not necessarily</p>
<p>the name or the neurochemical system, right?</p>
<p>Those could have just been called</p>
<p>category one, two, three, and four</p>
<p>for all that matters here.</p>
<p>What is interesting is seeing</p>
<p>how those different groups of individuals</p>
<p>that she absolutely can categorize</p>
<p>based on their self-reported preferences</p>
<p>about behaviors and certain kinds of interactions,</p>
<p>how those groups tend to pair up</p>
<p>with people in the same or opposite categories.</p>
<p>So what her studies reveal</p>
<p>is that people that fall into the high sensation seeking,</p>
<p>novelty seeking, spontaneity category,</p>
<p>the one that she calls the high dopamine category,</p>
<p>tend to pair up with, at least in the short term,</p>
<p>tend to pair up with people</p>
<p>who are also in that dopaminergic category.</p>
<p>So these would be people</p>
<p>that would spontaneously take a trip</p>
<p>or explore something new or a new restaurant.</p>
<p>They tend to be creative and explorative types.</p>
<p>So that group, on average,</p>
<p>tends to date and mate</p>
<p>and potentially form long-term relationships</p>
<p>within category, again, averages.</p>
<p>Individuals that she placed into the serotonin group</p>
<p>or what she hypothesized would be a high serotonin group,</p>
<p>again, they didn&rsquo;t measure serotonin,</p>
<p>but people that tend to place value on stability,</p>
<p>on rules, on certain forms of kind of traditional</p>
<p>organization at home and in relationships,</p>
<p>those people also tended to pair up with select date,</p>
<p>we presume mate with,</p>
<p>and form stable relationships</p>
<p>with people in the same category.</p>
<p>Now, individuals in the other two categories,</p>
<p>the high testosterone group,</p>
<p>and again, testosterone wasn&rsquo;t measured,</p>
<p>but she called it the high testosterone group.</p>
<p>But these are people that tend to be very directive.</p>
<p>They tend to know what they want</p>
<p>and are comfortable telling other people</p>
<p>what they want and from them.</p>
<p>These are individuals that in her studies</p>
<p>and in other studies tend to be a little bit challenging,</p>
<p>meaning they, not necessarily challenging to be around,</p>
<p>but they tend to challenge other people,</p>
<p>kind of push them in order to expand their boundaries,</p>
<p>either for sake of the relationship or just in general.</p>
<p>And the people they tend to push</p>
<p>are the people that they pair up with,</p>
<p>which are the people in the estrogen category,</p>
<p>what she called high estrogen.</p>
<p>Again, they didn&rsquo;t measure estrogen,</p>
<p>but the people in the estrogen category</p>
<p>were the ones that describe themselves</p>
<p>and their choices in life</p>
<p>and their preferences as being nurturing.</p>
<p>They actually seem to like it when someone else</p>
<p>is making the major decisions,</p>
<p>not every decision.</p>
<p>They certainly like to be heard, of course,</p>
<p>in terms of their preferences,</p>
<p>but that those two types,</p>
<p>what she called the testosterone and the estrogen type</p>
<p>tend to pair up.</p>
<p>So why are these categorizations</p>
<p>and these averages interesting to me,</p>
<p>at least interesting enough to convey to you?</p>
<p>The reason they&rsquo;re interesting to me is,</p>
<p>again, not because of their names,</p>
<p>these molecules were not measured in these individuals,</p>
<p>but that they once again bring us</p>
<p>to the themes that we addressed before,</p>
<p>which are the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>and whether or not it tends to be shifted</p>
<p>more towards alertness in action</p>
<p>or more towards kind of a stable equilibrium</p>
<p>or more towards kind of calm</p>
<p>and whether or not individuals are selecting</p>
<p>for people who have autonomic nervous systems</p>
<p>that are more or less like theirs</p>
<p>before they even meet, right?</p>
<p>So again, going back to this seesaw analogy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like people who have the kind of flat seesaw,</p>
<p>alert but calm, but not extremely alert,</p>
<p>not extremely overly calm in situations,</p>
<p>but kind of in the middle,</p>
<p>seem to be seeking out people that are also</p>
<p>at that kind of autonomic equilibrium.</p>
<p>People in the, what she called the dopamine category,</p>
<p>which really can just be described</p>
<p>as high sensation seeking, novelty seeking,</p>
<p>they seem to want to pair with one another.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a selection for similar in two of the groups,</p>
<p>autonomic tone.</p>
<p>I find that very interesting because in that decision</p>
<p>or that preference for similar autonomic tone,</p>
<p>it essentially eliminates a lot of the requirement</p>
<p>for figuring out how to match</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s autonomic nervous system to another.</p>
<p>They simply find someone with a similar tendency, okay?</p>
<p>Whereas in the other two groups</p>
<p>that she called testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>the director type and the nurturing kind of</p>
<p>somewhat follower type,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an establishment of balance,</p>
<p>but not between two individuals as a match,</p>
<p>but rather on the whole in the relationship.</p>
<p>One person is kind of driving the novelty seeking</p>
<p>in the course of decisions and actions.</p>
<p>And the other person is essentially agreeing to those.</p>
<p>Now, assuming that those decisions are good for both people.</p>
<p>And I emphasize good for both people</p>
<p>because one of the themes that Dr. Fisher underscores,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to underscore here as well,</p>
<p>is that it need not be the case that people pair up</p>
<p>exactly according to these categorizations</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve described.</p>
<p>Dopamine with dopamine, serotonin with serotonin,</p>
<p>testosterone with estrogen, and so on.</p>
<p>What is important is that there be a recognition</p>
<p>and a respect for the other types</p>
<p>or a recognition and a respect for the fact</p>
<p>that both are of the same type.</p>
<p>You could actually imagine, for instance,</p>
<p>that two people of this high sensation seeking,</p>
<p>novelty seeking could have</p>
<p>a terrifically exciting relationship,</p>
<p>but that it actually might be a relationship</p>
<p>in which the financial stability isn&rsquo;t quite there</p>
<p>or in which the basic stability isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>You could imagine, for instance,</p>
<p>a situation in which a relationship between two people</p>
<p>of what she called the high serotonin preference</p>
<p>would have a relationship that was actually kind of dull</p>
<p>in which both of them found themselves</p>
<p>kind of bored at some point,</p>
<p>or in which there wasn&rsquo;t enough of the dynamic tension</p>
<p>that sometimes is required in order to keep this cycle</p>
<p>of desire, love, and attachment going,</p>
<p>something that we will talk about in a moment.</p>
<p>So the point here is not that one should necessarily pair up</p>
<p>according to these arrangements that I described.</p>
<p>The point is that on average, that&rsquo;s what tends to happen.</p>
<p>And that through a recognition</p>
<p>that these categorizations exist,</p>
<p>similar to the recognition that the type A, B, C, and D</p>
<p>infant and toddler type attachments exist,</p>
<p>that we can gain better self-awareness of who we are</p>
<p>and how we tend to show up in romantic attachments</p>
<p>and thereby navigate healthier mate seeking,</p>
<p>healthier breakups, if the case dictates it,</p>
<p>and in some cases, healthy long-term relationships</p>
<p>by understanding that the other person</p>
<p>can either be similar or complimentary to us.</p>
<p>One is neither better than the other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply the case that in all romantic attachments</p>
<p>from the initial inception of the romantic attachment,</p>
<p>desire, love, and attachment,</p>
<p>there is an autonomic coordination.</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s coordination</p>
<p>of all sorts of other things like, you know,</p>
<p>food, sex, and sleep, and finances,</p>
<p>and where people are going to live and many other features,</p>
<p>but that at the core of all that</p>
<p>is a seeking of either autonomic likeness</p>
<p>or autonomic differences.</p>
<p>And I think that recognition can be extremely valuable</p>
<p>in thinking about tools to enter</p>
<p>and maintain relationships.</p>
<p>If one thinks about their autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>not simply as something that is driven</p>
<p>by external people and events,</p>
<p>but that we can actually gain some control over</p>
<p>through techniques of the sort that I talked about earlier</p>
<p>and on previous podcasts, but also generally,</p>
<p>if we are able to adjust our autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>in order to at least appreciate or get some empathy</p>
<p>into what someone else is experiencing,</p>
<p>then we gain actual cognitive empathy.</p>
<p>And this episode isn&rsquo;t about empathy per se,</p>
<p>but the theme keeps coming up again and again.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s worth mentioning</p>
<p>that when you talk to psychologists,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re psychoanalysts</p>
<p>or from another source of training,</p>
<p>what you find is that they don&rsquo;t talk about empathy</p>
<p>as a general term, they will talk about emotional empathy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll talk about cognitive empathy.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m talking about here today</p>
<p>is that yet a third category that is very strongly</p>
<p>determinant of relationship dynamics,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s autonomic empathy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a biologist, I&rsquo;m not a psychologist,</p>
<p>so I love mechanism.</p>
<p>And fortunately, there are studies that have been done</p>
<p>recently using modern techniques</p>
<p>to look at neural mechanisms of romantic attachment.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier some of the brain imaging studies</p>
<p>that have been done on child and mother,</p>
<p>literally imaging the activity of neurons in the brain</p>
<p>as child is nursing or as a mother is soothing baby.</p>
<p>And as you learned earlier,</p>
<p>baby is soothing mother as well.</p>
<p>Those are remarkable studies.</p>
<p>You may have seen some of these pictures online.</p>
<p>You can see the kind of silhouette of the infant and mother</p>
<p>and their brains,</p>
<p>and even some of the brain activation patterns,</p>
<p>really, really beautiful studies.</p>
<p>Similar studies have been done in romantic couples</p>
<p>with those couples either touching one another,</p>
<p>touching and kissing, or in kind of clever,</p>
<p>I think control experiments of the person</p>
<p>just touching a pillow or something or kissing a pillow</p>
<p>in order to try and create the most reasonable control</p>
<p>for what are actually pretty complicated</p>
<p>interpersonal dynamics to do in a brain imaging scanner.</p>
<p>But some of the other studies that have been done recently</p>
<p>involved so-called EEG.</p>
<p>So these are electrical recordings</p>
<p>that are done non-invasively,</p>
<p>putting a bunch of electrodes on the outside of the scalp.</p>
<p>EEG is useful in that you can do it non-invasively.</p>
<p>You can do it while people are moving and doing things,</p>
<p>kissing, touching, et cetera.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t allow one to image</p>
<p>or to evaluate neural activity very deeply in the brain.</p>
<p>So you can miss out on a lot of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like looking at the wave structure on the ocean</p>
<p>without actually looking into the depths of the ocean.</p>
<p>So you can miss certain things,</p>
<p>but if you see things generally you trust they are there,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t see what you don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there&rsquo;s some studies that I&rsquo;ll just point you</p>
<p>to and that formed the segue</p>
<p>for what I&rsquo;m going to discuss in a moment,</p>
<p>which is a study published in Scientific Reports in 2021</p>
<p>entitled Investigating Real-Life Emotions</p>
<p>in Romantic Couples, a Mobile EEG Study.</p>
<p>So this is as the title suggests,</p>
<p>having people wear these EEG caps of electrodes,</p>
<p>get engaged in very passionate emotional kisses,</p>
<p>emotional speech toward one another,</p>
<p>standing at different distances.</p>
<p>So a lot of cool stuff that you can do</p>
<p>that you really couldn&rsquo;t do in a brain scanner</p>
<p>because in a brain scanner,</p>
<p>people have to be there in a, usually in a bite bar.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually to draw like this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in one of these things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of moving around to be had,</p>
<p>at least not using the current technology.</p>
<p>In any case, what they found was</p>
<p>there is a shift in brain waves, brain states,</p>
<p>things like alpha waves,</p>
<p>which is a particular frequency of brain waves</p>
<p>in the neocortex,</p>
<p>the kind of outer shell of the brain just beneath the skull.</p>
<p>And in people that are kissing</p>
<p>or in people that are engaged in romantic speech,</p>
<p>or I didn&rsquo;t actually hear what they said to one another,</p>
<p>but what the couple seems exciting,</p>
<p>romantic and arousing to them,</p>
<p>they see more alpha wave activity</p>
<p>compared to the control conditions.</p>
<p>And there was some, what we call lateralization,</p>
<p>where the left hemisphere was more active than the right</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>And these studies are important</p>
<p>because we know that the autonomic nervous systems</p>
<p>of individuals tend to start to collaborate</p>
<p>and actually synchronize at the level of heartbeats,</p>
<p>at the level of breathing</p>
<p>during romantic interactions of different kinds.</p>
<p>But these studies are some of the first of their kind</p>
<p>to start looking at neural synchronization</p>
<p>between individuals.</p>
<p>Now, the simple version of looking at this</p>
<p>and the way I would have thought this would all go was,</p>
<p>okay, two people start kissing,</p>
<p>they start talking about what they find</p>
<p>particularly romantic and arousing for them,</p>
<p>and their brain waves will just match to one another.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the basis of romantic attachment</p>
<p>and romantic engagement in that sort of thing.</p>
<p>But it turns out that the opposite is true.</p>
<p>So a really nice study published in a really fine journal,</p>
<p>Cerebral Cortex is a journal</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve known about for many years.</p>
<p>They publish strong anatomy, physiology, and neuroimaging.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study that was published,</p>
<p>first author Kajimura in,</p>
<p>and this paper really points, again, this is 2021.</p>
<p>And the title of this paper is</p>
<p>brain knows who is on the same wavelength.</p>
<p>Resting state connectivity can predict compatibility</p>
<p>of female-male relationship.</p>
<p>Now, what this study did was a little bit different.</p>
<p>They looked at the resting</p>
<p>or default mode activity of the brain.</p>
<p>So rather than evoked activity, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>where people are kissing</p>
<p>or engaged in some sort of activity,</p>
<p>this was a neuroimaging study, not EEG,</p>
<p>but fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging,</p>
<p>which is similar to EEG in principle,</p>
<p>but allows you to look deep into the brain.</p>
<p>And it has very good resolution in time and space.</p>
<p>So fast events can be monitored,</p>
<p>and the precise location of those events can be monitored</p>
<p>somewhat better than EEG.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this.</p>
<p>So for you EEGers out there,</p>
<p>EEG, don&rsquo;t come after me with electrodes.</p>
<p>Just understand that fMRI gives you a fuller picture</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And what Kajimura et al found was that contrary</p>
<p>to what your reflexive prediction might be,</p>
<p>people tend to select people that have resting brain states</p>
<p>that are different than theirs,</p>
<p>or sometimes they found that are actually opposite</p>
<p>to their own resting brain state.</p>
<p>And you might say, well, that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>I thought this is all about autonomic coordination.</p>
<p>But actually, if we go back to Helen Fisher&rsquo;s</p>
<p>categorizations of the dopamine types,</p>
<p>the sensation-seeking types, that is serotonin,</p>
<p>the kind of stable rule-following types,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen types,</p>
<p>remember that the two categories</p>
<p>that she called testosterone and estrogen type,</p>
<p>the director and the follower, the nurturer,</p>
<p>I guess it would be the more accurate way,</p>
<p>the director and the nurturer,</p>
<p>those tend to pair up across categories,</p>
<p>not within category.</p>
<p>And so I think what&rsquo;s really needed for this field,</p>
<p>which to my knowledge hasn&rsquo;t happened yet,</p>
<p>is to really start to map the neuroanatomical</p>
<p>and neurophysiological findings of, in this case,</p>
<p>that resting brain state is in one form, in one individual,</p>
<p>and they tend to seek out people whose resting brain state</p>
<p>is different than theirs, not similar.</p>
<p>That needs to be mapped onto the more subjective,</p>
<p>psychological categorizations that Helen Fisher</p>
<p>and indeed the Gottmans and others have created.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the state of the field now.</p>
<p>And I mentioned this, not to confuse you,</p>
<p>but to the contrary, to illustrate that it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>about finding someone just like you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just about finding someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s opposite to you.</p>
<p>This is actually the reason that I decided to become</p>
<p>a biologist at some point in my life,</p>
<p>which is that we can find verbal sayings and stories</p>
<p>and examples to support just about anything.</p>
<p>This is not a knock on the field of psychology,</p>
<p>as you can probably tell from today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I have great respect for and reverence</p>
<p>for the field of psychology,</p>
<p>especially its collaboration with neuroscience</p>
<p>and vice versa.</p>
<p>But in the popular culture, we can find examples</p>
<p>and sayings that support essentially anything</p>
<p>as it relates to a relationship.</p>
<p>For instance, I&rsquo;ve heard, and you&rsquo;ve probably heard,</p>
<p>absence makes the heart grow fonder.</p>
<p>And indeed I&rsquo;ve experienced that, and I believe it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But I also have experienced, and I believe to be true,</p>
<p>that out of sight, out of mind also exists</p>
<p>and that there will be a biological mechanism for that.</p>
<p>The point here is that matching of same to same</p>
<p>or same to different can both be effective</p>
<p>in creating the desire love attachment process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of who is looking for same</p>
<p>and who is looking for different.</p>
<p>And there, I think Dr. Fisher</p>
<p>and the work of these neurophysiologists</p>
<p>and brain imagers really does point in a direction</p>
<p>whereby there is not one form of attachment</p>
<p>that is going to be wholly above all else</p>
<p>and will predict good outcomes.</p>
<p>There is not going to be a case in which opposites attract,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s always the best rule to follow.</p>
<p>Sometimes it will, sometimes it won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There is also not the case that people tend</p>
<p>to pair up with similar.</p>
<p>Sometimes it will be the case.</p>
<p>Sometimes it won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now, there are certain statistics</p>
<p>that support that statement.</p>
<p>For instance, people on average,</p>
<p>people pair up with individuals</p>
<p>of similar educational background, income and attractiveness.</p>
<p>That is true on average, but it&rsquo;s not always the case.</p>
<p>And again, a knowledge of and a respect</p>
<p>for the different categorizations of attachment,</p>
<p>the different categorizations of mate seeking</p>
<p>described by Fisher and others,</p>
<p>and the recognition that matching</p>
<p>of autonomic nervous systems,</p>
<p>but also mismatching of resting state brain networks</p>
<p>are all at play in driving what we are calling</p>
<p>desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>So in keeping with the exploration of the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a saying or a book or a song</p>
<p>or an example of pretty much any relationship dynamic,</p>
<p>I want to now talk about an article that came out</p>
<p>a little over 10 years ago</p>
<p>that talked about the universality of love</p>
<p>and the ability to fall in love.</p>
<p>So this would be very much in line</p>
<p>with the George Bernard Shaw quote that I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>that love is really overestimating</p>
<p>the differences between individuals.</p>
<p>And again, I should say that is not something</p>
<p>that I personally believe,</p>
<p>although maybe I&rsquo;m just deluding myself.</p>
<p>I like to think that the people that we fall in love with</p>
<p>are really special for us,</p>
<p>that they could not easily be replaced with anybody else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s simply my stance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not basing that on any hardcore</p>
<p>neurobiological mechanism,</p>
<p>but nonetheless,</p>
<p>an article was published in the New York Times in 2015</p>
<p>that related to some psychological studies that were done</p>
<p>as well as some clinical work,</p>
<p>as well as some what I would call pop psychology</p>
<p>or things that fall outside</p>
<p>the domains of academic science.</p>
<p>And the whole basis of this article</p>
<p>was 36 questions that lead to love.</p>
<p>And it involved a listing out indeed of 36 questions</p>
<p>divided into set one, set two, and set three</p>
<p>that progress from somewhat ordinary questions</p>
<p>about life experience and self-report</p>
<p>to more, let&rsquo;s call them deep questions</p>
<p>about people&rsquo;s values</p>
<p>and things that are emotionally close to them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just give an example of a few of these.</p>
<p>You can find this easily online</p>
<p>by just putting into your search engine,</p>
<p>36 questions that lead to love.</p>
<p>Some of the questions in set number one were, for instance,</p>
<p>what would constitute a perfect day for you?</p>
<p>For what in your life do you feel most grateful?</p>
<p>Kind of standard questionnaire stuff.</p>
<p>In set two, what is your most treasured memory?</p>
<p>What is your most terrible memory?</p>
<p>So these are, as you can tell,</p>
<p>are drilling a little bit deeper</p>
<p>into one&rsquo;s personal experience and emotional system.</p>
<p>And then set three, questions 25 through 36</p>
<p>are things, you know,</p>
<p>what is a very embarrassing moment in your life?</p>
<p>When did you last cry in front of another person</p>
<p>and by yourself?</p>
<p>What is something that&rsquo;s too serious to be joked about?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going deeper into one&rsquo;s emotional system.</p>
<p>And even questions like, of all the people in your family,</p>
<p>whose death would you find most disturbing and why?</p>
<p>So pretty, pretty heavy stuff there at the end.</p>
<p>Now, the reason this article got so much traction</p>
<p>and the reason I&rsquo;m bringing it up today</p>
<p>is that there was a statement</p>
<p>that was made in and around this article</p>
<p>that if two people went on a date</p>
<p>or simply sat down and asked each other these questions</p>
<p>and each answered these questions</p>
<p>and the other was paying attention carefully</p>
<p>and at some level emotionally responding</p>
<p>or not responding, but certainly paying attention</p>
<p>to the answers of the other person,</p>
<p>that by the end of that exchange</p>
<p>where one person asks 36 questions</p>
<p>and the other person answers all 36</p>
<p>and then the other person asks all 36</p>
<p>and the other person answers all 36,</p>
<p>that they would fall in love, right?</p>
<p>Which seems like kind of a ridiculous thing.</p>
<p>And yet it is the case</p>
<p>that people who go through this exercise</p>
<p>report feeling as if they know the other person quite well</p>
<p>and feeling certain levels of attachment</p>
<p>or even love and desire for the other person</p>
<p>that they would not have predicted, excuse me,</p>
<p>would not have predicted</p>
<p>had they not gone through that process.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on in this exchange of questions and answers</p>
<p>of a progressively more emotional and deep level?</p>
<p>Well, what I predict is going on</p>
<p>is that inside of that exchange,</p>
<p>people are creating a sort of delusional story</p>
<p>about the nature of the exchange</p>
<p>being a reflection of some deeper attachment.</p>
<p>And so even though people are just exchanging words,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not physically touching.</p>
<p>They are not, at least not at the point</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re running these kinds of questionnaire studies.</p>
<p>They may touch afterwards for all I know</p>
<p>and probably did in some cases,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not exchanging life experience</p>
<p>in an immediate way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not actually going off into the world</p>
<p>and doing things together yet.</p>
<p>They are simply exchanging narrative.</p>
<p>But we know based on recent studies,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve covered this before on this podcast,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll mention again,</p>
<p>there was a study published in Cell Reports,</p>
<p>a Cell Press journal, excellent journal,</p>
<p>showing that when individuals listen to the same narrative,</p>
<p>their heart rates tend to synchronize</p>
<p>or at least follow a very similar pattern,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re not in the same room</p>
<p>listening to a given narrative.</p>
<p>Whereas in this case, people are facing one another,</p>
<p>listening to the narratives of each other.</p>
<p>Certainly they are having autonomic responses.</p>
<p>And it stands to reason</p>
<p>that their autonomic nervous systems are synchronizing</p>
<p>much in the same way that the Cell Reports study found</p>
<p>that people will synchronize their autonomic nervous systems</p>
<p>to a shared herd story from another.</p>
<p>In other words, whether or not we hear a story,</p>
<p>watch a movie, listen to a song,</p>
<p>or exchange our own individual stories,</p>
<p>our autonomic nervous systems have the potential</p>
<p>to map onto one another.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not all that surprised that people find</p>
<p>that they fall in love, in quotes,</p>
<p>after answering these questions to one another,</p>
<p>because essentially the way these questions are laid out</p>
<p>is they establish a narrative.</p>
<p>They establish a very personal narrative</p>
<p>and the other person is listening very closely.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have physiological or brain imaging studies</p>
<p>to support what I&rsquo;m about to say,</p>
<p>but the reasonable interpretation</p>
<p>is that that&rsquo;s causing some sort</p>
<p>of autonomic synchronization.</p>
<p>So if you want to try this on a date or even,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually been hypothesized</p>
<p>that this could be useful for existing couples,</p>
<p>even if they already know the answers</p>
<p>to some of these questions.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t surprise me either.</p>
<p>I think the autonomic coordination</p>
<p>is present during mating behavior.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s present during shared experience of the outside world,</p>
<p>movies, concerts, watching one&rsquo;s children</p>
<p>with somebody else, et cetera.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s established by sharing one&rsquo;s own narrative</p>
<p>of their own personal experience.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to seem overly reductionist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never propose that all of our sensation, perception,</p>
<p>action, and experience in life boils down</p>
<p>to us just being bags of chemicals</p>
<p>and the action of those chemicals</p>
<p>or any aspect of our nervous system.</p>
<p>And yet, in looking across the psychological literature</p>
<p>of development of attachment,</p>
<p>in the psychological literature</p>
<p>of adult and romantic attachment,</p>
<p>and what makes and breaks those attachments,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear to me,</p>
<p>and I think courses through the literature</p>
<p>at multiple levels,</p>
<p>that autonomic coordination is absolutely key</p>
<p>for the establishment of desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>In fact, I talked earlier about how our actual conception</p>
<p>is born out of autonomic coordination</p>
<p>of one sort or another.</p>
<p>So again, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that autonomic nervous systems always be synchronized.</p>
<p>In the case of the two categorizations</p>
<p>that Fisher proposed of the director slash testosterone type</p>
<p>and the nurturing follower slash estrogen type,</p>
<p>it was actually the coordination,</p>
<p>but in opposite directions of individuals</p>
<p>that fall into each of those categories</p>
<p>that led to more stable attachments</p>
<p>or the seeking out of those attachments, I should say.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it&rsquo;s, at least to my mind,</p>
<p>very clear that autonomic coordination</p>
<p>is a hallmark feature of desire,</p>
<p>a hallmark feature of what we call love,</p>
<p>and a hallmark feature of what we call attachment,</p>
<p>and that the breaking of attachments</p>
<p>or the failures of desire,</p>
<p>the failures of love,</p>
<p>and the failures of attachment over time</p>
<p>in line with the work of Gottman and others,</p>
<p>and even just simply what&rsquo;s required for mating behavior</p>
<p>is also reflected in the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>But in that case,</p>
<p>a failure to coordinate the autonomic nervous systems</p>
<p>in some sort of concerted way.</p>
<p>Any discussion about desire, love, and attachment</p>
<p>would be incomplete if we didn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about the dreaded infidelity and cheating.</p>
<p>You know, much has been made of infidelity and cheating</p>
<p>and whether or not people who are higher on dopamine</p>
<p>and sensation seeking tend to cheat more or less.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any solid evidence for that.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of examples</p>
<p>that we can draw from in our own lives</p>
<p>and in the lives of others</p>
<p>that would generally support one or the other model,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not aware of any decent physiological studies</p>
<p>or psychological studies that really point to that.</p>
<p>For instance, I would never say</p>
<p>that the serotonergic phenotype as described by Fisher</p>
<p>is less prone to cheat,</p>
<p>or that the people who have an insecure attachment</p>
<p>are more likely to cheat, for instance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think those correlations have been drawn</p>
<p>in any kind of meaningful way yet,</p>
<p>so I would be cautious about assigning them</p>
<p>without that evidence.</p>
<p>However, there are some interesting studies involving,</p>
<p>again, neuroimaging and some subjective measures in humans,</p>
<p>meaning asking them questions that they&rsquo;re good ways</p>
<p>to tease out lies from truths in these sorts of studies,</p>
<p>and whether or not people tend to find their partner</p>
<p>or others more or less attractive</p>
<p>depending on how people feel about themselves.</p>
<p>And I think this is a very interesting aspect</p>
<p>to desire, love, and attachment for the following reason.</p>
<p>You hear a lot out there that, you know,</p>
<p>in order to form a really strong relationship,</p>
<p>you have to have a good relationship with yourself,</p>
<p>or you have to love yourself,</p>
<p>or you often hear, for instance,</p>
<p>that, you know, it&rsquo;s exactly when you&rsquo;re not looking</p>
<p>for a relationship that you&rsquo;re going to find one.</p>
<p>You hear this stuff, right?</p>
<p>But none of that is really grounded in any studies.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s like out of sight, out of mind,</p>
<p>or absence makes the heart grow fonder.</p>
<p>There are many life examples to support those statements,</p>
<p>and there are many life examples</p>
<p>to support statements to the opposite.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a particular study that I found.</p>
<p>This was published in Frontiers in Psychology,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a experimental study that involves neuroimaging.</p>
<p>The title of this study is</p>
<p>Manipulation of Self-Expansion Alters Responses</p>
<p>to Attractive Alternative Partners.</p>
<p>And I love the design of this study.</p>
<p>What they did in this study is they took couples</p>
<p>and they evaluated members of that relationship</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s called self-expansion.</p>
<p>Now, self-expansion is a metric</p>
<p>that involves one&rsquo;s perception of self</p>
<p>as seen through the relationship to the other.</p>
<p>And this is something that was developed</p>
<p>by the authors are Aaron and Erin.</p>
<p>So they have the same last name.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m assuming this was either a sibling team</p>
<p>or a somehow related team or a romantic couple team,</p>
<p>A-R-O-N and A-R-O-N.</p>
<p>Aaron and Erin in 1986 proposed</p>
<p>this self-expansion model of close relationships.</p>
<p>And they proposed that people are motivated</p>
<p>to enter relationships, I&rsquo;m reading here,</p>
<p>in order to enhance the self and increase self-efficacy.</p>
<p>In other words, that one of the reasons</p>
<p>why many people enter relationships</p>
<p>is that it makes us feel good about ourselves</p>
<p>and more capable.</p>
<p>And I would see that as a healthy interdependence,</p>
<p>not necessarily codependence.</p>
<p>This is especially strong at the beginning</p>
<p>of a relationship, it turns out,</p>
<p>when people are forming pair bonds.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the case that pleasure, arousal, and excitement,</p>
<p>again, all hallmark features</p>
<p>of autonomic nervous system function,</p>
<p>pleasure, arousal, and excitement,</p>
<p>give rise to self-expansion,</p>
<p>meaning to self-efficacy.</p>
<p>So what this self-expansion model is really about</p>
<p>is how great other people that we are close to</p>
<p>and romantically attached to can potentially make us feel,</p>
<p>in terms of what they say, in terms of what they do,</p>
<p>in terms of the way in which we believe they feel about us.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to involve</p>
<p>explicit statements of them telling us how great we are</p>
<p>or them doing great gestures for us,</p>
<p>but how we actually feel they feel about us</p>
<p>turns out to be a very strong parameter</p>
<p>in terms of how we feel about ourselves</p>
<p>and the relationship overall.</p>
<p>Now, some of you out there are probably thinking,</p>
<p>oh yeah, isn&rsquo;t there this thing, the love languages, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any neuroscience to support that.</p>
<p>I think the love languages,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not super familiar with this, I didn&rsquo;t list it out,</p>
<p>but that some people are,</p>
<p>their autonomic nervous system, if you will,</p>
<p>tends to be very responsive to gifts or to quality time</p>
<p>or to physical touch or acts of kindness.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve got a few of these, right?</p>
<p>I probably have a few wrong.</p>
<p>Anyway, they&rsquo;re easy to find online.</p>
<p>And people do tend to have a kind of a bias</p>
<p>toward two or three of these things</p>
<p>that are especially meaningful for them.</p>
<p>And when I hear meaningful, I hear,</p>
<p>they tend to push the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>and neurochemical systems of the brain and body</p>
<p>in a direction that makes us feel good</p>
<p>as opposed to lousy or neutral.</p>
<p>In any event, this study looked at</p>
<p>whether or not people have high levels of self-expansion</p>
<p>through the actions or statements of their significant other</p>
<p>and how that influences their perception</p>
<p>of people outside the relationship,</p>
<p>meaning how attractive they perceive people</p>
<p>outside the relationship to be</p>
<p>turns out to be strongly influenced by,</p>
<p>A, whether or not their self-expansion</p>
<p>is very strongly driven by the other person</p>
<p>that they are involved with,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re in the romantic relationship with,</p>
<p>and whether or not that&rsquo;s being expressed to them.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how the study went.</p>
<p>First of all, they rated or categorized individuals</p>
<p>on the basis of the self-expansion metric.</p>
<p>Some people have more of a potential</p>
<p>to experience self-expansion through others, right?</p>
<p>Some of us feel great about ourselves</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re kind of topped off at that.</p>
<p>Others don&rsquo;t feel so great about themselves,</p>
<p>but they can feel much better in response to praise,</p>
<p>in particular praise or self-expansion type behaviors</p>
<p>or statements from people that we really care about.</p>
<p>And still other people are a mixture of the two,</p>
<p>the kind of moderate levels of both.</p>
<p>So they rated them on this scale.</p>
<p>And then they had people experience</p>
<p>self-expansion narratives.</p>
<p>They heard their significant other</p>
<p>say really terrific things about them</p>
<p>and about the relationship in particular,</p>
<p>that the relationship that they have</p>
<p>was exciting, novel, and challenging.</p>
<p>So that was one form of self-expansion.</p>
<p>And they went into some detail as to why that was the case</p>
<p>in their particular relationship.</p>
<p>Or they heard a narrative from their significant other</p>
<p>about strong feelings of love between the two</p>
<p>that had been experienced previously in the relationship.</p>
<p>So in the one case, it&rsquo;s sort of directed more towards them.</p>
<p>And in the other case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more about the relationship itself.</p>
<p>And then they did brain imaging</p>
<p>of one person in the relationship</p>
<p>while that person assessed the attractiveness</p>
<p>of people outside the relationship.</p>
<p>And what they found was that people</p>
<p>who were primed for this self-expansion</p>
<p>had lower activation of brain areas</p>
<p>associated with assessing others&rsquo; attractiveness</p>
<p>than did the people who experienced a lot of self-expansion.</p>
<p>Now, the takeaway from that,</p>
<p>at least the way I read this study,</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re with somebody who really benefits from</p>
<p>or experiences a lot of self-expansion,</p>
<p>unless you really want them to pay attention</p>
<p>to the attractiveness of other people,</p>
<p>it stands to reason that they would benefit</p>
<p>from more self-expansion type gestures or statements.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Not so much centered on the relationship.</p>
<p>We have such a great relationship.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so great.</p>
<p>That too, but in the context of this study</p>
<p>and these findings that the person is really terrific,</p>
<p>that the relationship that they&rsquo;ve created together</p>
<p>is really exciting, novel, and challenging,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a narrative around the relationship</p>
<p>that really has a lot to do with the dynamics</p>
<p>between the individuals,</p>
<p>in particular, that the person who really likes</p>
<p>self-expansion is vital to that dynamic.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not looking down at the relationship</p>
<p>as a set of equals.</p>
<p>There is sort of this bias written into this</p>
<p>of that this person is really essential</p>
<p>for the relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is something that anyone has to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is right or wrong.</p>
<p>This is just what the data say.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s remarkable is that</p>
<p>in the absence of those statements,</p>
<p>people who have, or that rate high on this scale</p>
<p>of self-expansion rate attractive alternative partners</p>
<p>as more attractive.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s interesting to me because it means</p>
<p>that their actual perception of others is changing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that their opportunity to see others is changing.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>This is not a matter of them somehow getting access</p>
<p>or no access to attractive alternative partners.</p>
<p>Again, attractive alternative partners,</p>
<p>literally the language in the title of this paper,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still seeing all these attractive people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that if they&rsquo;re feeling filled up in air quotes,</p>
<p>psychologically filled up, emotionally filled up,</p>
<p>autonomically filled, enhanced in the language</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re using today by the self-expansion narrative,</p>
<p>well then the same set of attractive faces</p>
<p>appear less attractive to a given individual.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not this predicts cheating or loyalty,</p>
<p>I certainly can&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>That would be very hard to assess in neuroimaging.</p>
<p>And there, of course, people rarely,</p>
<p>if ever report accurately their cheating behavior.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some studies in which confidentiality is assured</p>
<p>to the point where people seem to be more trusting</p>
<p>and willing to reveal cheating behavior.</p>
<p>But if you look at the statistics on cheating behavior,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to track because people lie all the time</p>
<p>about their cheating in and outside of the context</p>
<p>of psychological and neuroimaging studies.</p>
<p>But I find this study, again,</p>
<p>the title manipulation of self-expansion</p>
<p>alters responses to attractive alternative partners</p>
<p>to be absolutely fascinating because again,</p>
<p>it points to the fact that the interactions</p>
<p>with our significant others shapes our autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>shapes our perception of self</p>
<p>and thereby shapes our perception</p>
<p>of other potential partners in the outside world</p>
<p>or shuts us down to the potential</p>
<p>of other people in the outside world.</p>
<p>So when I hear statements such as,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important that you love yourself</p>
<p>in order to really fall in love with somebody else,</p>
<p>or it is when one is not looking for a relationship</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re most likely to fall in love</p>
<p>and form a stable relationship.</p>
<p>I can filter that through these findings to say that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really the person who needs a lot of self-expansion</p>
<p>stimulating statements or actions coming from other people</p>
<p>that is most prone to seeing other potential partners</p>
<p>out in the world as attractive.</p>
<p>And in this sense,</p>
<p>we can return to the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>as kind of a glass that it can be filled up</p>
<p>through various contexts.</p>
<p>It can be filled up through our own ability to regulate it.</p>
<p>It can be filled up through other people&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to enhance our sense of wellbeing.</p>
<p>And in some sense,</p>
<p>this points to an idea where it is true</p>
<p>that the better that we can feel about ourselves</p>
<p>in the absence of any self-expansion type</p>
<p>input from somebody else</p>
<p>really does place us on more stable ground</p>
<p>such that when we do receive that praise,</p>
<p>or we do receive those acts of kindness or service</p>
<p>or physical touch or whatever they are,</p>
<p>that we are able to further enhance the way that we feel,</p>
<p>but that we don&rsquo;t necessarily tether</p>
<p>all of our feelings of self-worth or self-expansion</p>
<p>to that one individual.</p>
<p>So you might think that if person A</p>
<p>can only receive the self-expansion from the statements,</p>
<p>from the action of the person they&rsquo;re involved with,</p>
<p>person B, that that will form a very stable bond.</p>
<p>But what this study points to is the fact</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a very unstable bond,</p>
<p>that person A is actually very susceptible</p>
<p>to the attractiveness of others</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so desperately attached</p>
<p>to this notion of self-expansion,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t realize it.</p>
<p>And so this really does point to the idea</p>
<p>that while it is important</p>
<p>to link our autonomic nervous systems</p>
<p>to establish desire, love, and attachment,</p>
<p>that we want to have a stable internal representation</p>
<p>of ourselves, a stable autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>to some degree or another,</p>
<p>so that we can be in stable romantic partnership</p>
<p>with another individual</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re really trying to do.</p>
<p>So until now, I&rsquo;ve been weaving together studies</p>
<p>from the field of experimental psychology</p>
<p>and the fields of neuroscience,</p>
<p>in particular, neuroimaging.</p>
<p>But if you recall back to the very beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>when I was discussing how odors and how hormones</p>
<p>and how even birth control can shape people&rsquo;s ratings</p>
<p>of attractiveness of others,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll realize that there&rsquo;s a deeper layer to all this,</p>
<p>which is that our biology</p>
<p>that resides below our conscious awareness,</p>
<p>things like our hormones, things like pheromones even,</p>
<p>are shaping the way that we choose, interpret,</p>
<p>and act with other potential romantic partners</p>
<p>or the romantic partners that we already have.</p>
<p>Now, this cannot be overemphasized, right?</p>
<p>No matter how much we would like to create</p>
<p>a sort of top-down description,</p>
<p>meaning from the cortex and our understanding of things</p>
<p>onto what we find attractive, who we find attractive,</p>
<p>what we enjoy, what we don&rsquo;t enjoy</p>
<p>in the pursuit and romantic interactions with others,</p>
<p>there always seems to be, and indeed there always is,</p>
<p>a deeper layer in which our subconscious processing</p>
<p>drives us to find a particular person</p>
<p>to be particularly attractive,</p>
<p>or in which we have chemistry with somebody,</p>
<p>or in which we lack chemistry with somebody.</p>
<p>And I would say that one of the more exciting, fascinating,</p>
<p>and indeed mysterious aspects of desire, love,</p>
<p>and attachment are those subconscious processes,</p>
<p>those things that we call chemistry, right?</p>
<p>I mean, people will report, for instance,</p>
<p>that somebody&rsquo;s smell is just absolutely,</p>
<p>positively intoxicating for them,</p>
<p>or that somebody&rsquo;s smell is absolutely repulsive to them,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>That the taste of someone&rsquo;s breath,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean that in any kind of poetic sense,</p>
<p>I literally mean the taste of somebody&rsquo;s breath,</p>
<p>in some cases, can be very exciting to somebody.</p>
<p>And believe it or not, we can taste each other&rsquo;s breath.</p>
<p>I talked about this in the chemical sensing episode</p>
<p>some months back, but we actually have receptors</p>
<p>for taste and smell that engage in coordinated action</p>
<p>such that we can&rsquo;t really separate taste and smell</p>
<p>at some level, and this is especially true</p>
<p>when it comes to the formation of romantic relationships</p>
<p>and what we call chemistry.</p>
<p>Now, is chemistry absolutely required</p>
<p>for forming stable attachments for love and for desire?</p>
<p>No, of course they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>But in general, these are primitive mechanisms</p>
<p>that exist in all animals.</p>
<p>They exist in special forms in humans,</p>
<p>but that they drive us toward behaviors that will,</p>
<p>as the theory goes, lead to love and attachment.</p>
<p>Not always, as Dr. Fisher pointed out,</p>
<p>that sex and sex drive is one way to explore</p>
<p>potential love relationships</p>
<p>and to explore potential attachments,</p>
<p>which of course are major investments</p>
<p>that extend well beyond one night or a week</p>
<p>or a vacation or even a year.</p>
<p>When we talk about stable attachments,</p>
<p>in general, that means long-term attachments in humans.</p>
<p>Now, there is a biology to all of that chemistry stuff,</p>
<p>and the studies of oral contraception</p>
<p>and men finding women more attractive</p>
<p>at certain phases of their menstrual cycle</p>
<p>and women finding men more attractive</p>
<p>at certain phases of the woman&rsquo;s menstrual cycle</p>
<p>point to the incredible power</p>
<p>of those deeper biological mechanisms.</p>
<p>In the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>I discuss both science and science-based tools,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t actually cover</p>
<p>some of the tools that relate</p>
<p>to those deeper biological mechanisms.</p>
<p>Now, the hormones, testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>are almost always the first biological chemicals</p>
<p>and hormones that are mentioned and described and explored</p>
<p>when thinking about desire</p>
<p>and love and attachment too, for that matter,</p>
<p>since love and attachment stem from desire.</p>
<p>I did an entire episode</p>
<p>about the biology of testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>and ways to optimize testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>You can easily find that episode at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s timestamped.</p>
<p>There, you can find all sorts of information</p>
<p>about how certain behaviors or absence of behaviors</p>
<p>drive up or down testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>I also dispel some myths about sexual behavior</p>
<p>and things like masturbation</p>
<p>and how they relate to testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>as well as some myths about</p>
<p>how those hormones change across the lifespan.</p>
<p>I also talk about the role of exercise.</p>
<p>I talk about supplementation,</p>
<p>and I also talk a little bit</p>
<p>about hormone replacement therapy,</p>
<p>although that will be the topic for a future episode.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in the biology</p>
<p>of testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>two hormones that absolutely influence things</p>
<p>like libido and desire,</p>
<p>please check out that episode</p>
<p>as well as what I&rsquo;m going to talk about</p>
<p>in just a moment here.</p>
<p>The simple stereotyped version of the hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>are that testosterone drives libido</p>
<p>or increases it, aka sex drive,</p>
<p>and that estrogen somehow blunts it</p>
<p>or is not involved in libido and sex drive.</p>
<p>And that is simply not the case.</p>
<p>As I describe in that</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen optimization episode,</p>
<p>and as I&rsquo;ll tell you now,</p>
<p>yes, testosterone and some of its other forms</p>
<p>like the hydrotestosterone</p>
<p>are strongly related to libido and sex drive</p>
<p>and the pursuit and ability to mate.</p>
<p>However, the hormone estrogen</p>
<p>is also strongly associated</p>
<p>with libido and mating behavior.</p>
<p>So much so that for people that</p>
<p>either chemically or for some other reason</p>
<p>have very low estrogen,</p>
<p>libido can severely suffer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a coordinated dance of estrogen and testosterone</p>
<p>in both males and females</p>
<p>that leads to libido or sex drive.</p>
<p>So I absolutely wanted to make clear</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not a simple relationship</p>
<p>between testosterone and sex drive</p>
<p>or estrogen and sex drive.</p>
<p>Both are required at appropriate ratios.</p>
<p>Now, with that said,</p>
<p>there are things that can shift libido</p>
<p>in both men and women</p>
<p>in the direction of more desire</p>
<p>or more desire to mate,</p>
<p>either to seek mates or to mate with existing partners.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a quite solid literature</p>
<p>around a few of those substances.</p>
<p>Now, a common misconception</p>
<p>is that because dopamine is involved in motivation and drive</p>
<p>that simply increasing dopamine</p>
<p>through any number of different mechanisms or tools</p>
<p>will increase libido and sex drive.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s simply not the case</p>
<p>either.</p>
<p>It is true that some level of dopamine</p>
<p>or increase in dopamine is required</p>
<p>for increases in libido.</p>
<p>However, because of dopamine&rsquo;s relationship</p>
<p>to the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>and because the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>is so intimately involved, no pun intended,</p>
<p>in sexual activity, in seeking and actual mating behavior,</p>
<p>as I described earlier,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually the case</p>
<p>that if people drive their dopamine system too high,</p>
<p>they will be in states of arousal</p>
<p>that are high enough such that they seek</p>
<p>and want sexual activity,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t actually engage the parasympathetic arm</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system sufficient</p>
<p>to become physically aroused.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a whole description of this</p>
<p>that awaits us in a future episode,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll summarize now by saying</p>
<p>for people that are taking substances</p>
<p>just simply to increase dopamine</p>
<p>in order to increase libido,</p>
<p>that can be a potentially hazardous route to follow</p>
<p>because depending on whether or not</p>
<p>that dopamine level is high enough</p>
<p>that it puts them into a mode of seeking mates or mating,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t adjust their autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>during actual mating behavior.</p>
<p>What essentially is I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>is it can place people into a chronic pursuit,</p>
<p>but an inability to perform sexually,</p>
<p>and this is true for men and women, okay?</p>
<p>So I would just caution people against just thinking,</p>
<p>oh, a lack of libido is simply a lack of dopamine.</p>
<p>That is not the case.</p>
<p>It could be from lower levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>but it could also be for other reasons.</p>
<p>And so these systems,</p>
<p>these signaling systems and these neurochemicals</p>
<p>are very intricate and just simply ramping up dopamine</p>
<p>has actually been found, for instance,</p>
<p>in amphetamine and cocaine users.</p>
<p>There is a phenomenon in which they become hyper aroused,</p>
<p>but can&rsquo;t perform sexually.</p>
<p>This is also true for people who take elevated levels</p>
<p>of other recreational drugs or who take antidepressants</p>
<p>that increase the dopamine system too much, right?</p>
<p>Dosage has to be worked out with your physician,</p>
<p>with your psychiatrist,</p>
<p>such that mood is enhanced</p>
<p>and the various aspects of a healthy wellbeing,</p>
<p>mind and body are enhanced,</p>
<p>but not so much so that what we call the arousal arc</p>
<p>is locked with the seesaw in the sympathetic drive position</p>
<p>such that sexual arousal can&rsquo;t occur, okay?</p>
<p>So this is an important point to make</p>
<p>because I think that a lot of people</p>
<p>are under the impression</p>
<p>that if they just drive up testosterone,</p>
<p>increase dopamine,</p>
<p>and generally get themselves</p>
<p>into high states of autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s going to increase their libido.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s simply not the way the system works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that seesaw and that seesawing back and forth</p>
<p>that is the arc of arousal that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Now, there are substances, legal over-the-counter substances</p>
<p>that fall under the categorization of supplements</p>
<p>that do indeed increase libido and arousal.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to talk about some of those</p>
<p>in the context of peer-reviewed literature now.</p>
<p>I want to be clear, however,</p>
<p>that these are by no means required.</p>
<p>Many people have healthy libidos</p>
<p>or have libidos that are healthy for their life</p>
<p>and what they need and want.</p>
<p>And as always, in any discussion about supplementation,</p>
<p>you absolutely have to check with your physician.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just say that to protect us,</p>
<p>I say that to protect you.</p>
<p>Your health and wellbeing is dependent on you</p>
<p>doing certain things and not doing others,</p>
<p>and everybody is different.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are studies</p>
<p>that point to specific substances</p>
<p>that are sold over-the-counter</p>
<p>that at least in the United States are legal</p>
<p>and that have been shown</p>
<p>to be statistically significant</p>
<p>in increasing measures of libido.</p>
<p>There are many such substances,</p>
<p>but three that in particular</p>
<p>have good peer-reviewed research to support them</p>
<p>are MACA, M-A-C-A, which is actually a root,</p>
<p>Tongat Ali, also sometimes called Long Jack,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t name them, forgive me,</p>
<p>and Tribulus, or Tribulus it&rsquo;s sometimes called.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about each of these in sequence.</p>
<p>But on the whole,</p>
<p>the studies on MACA are quite convincing</p>
<p>that consumption of two to three grams per day of MACA,</p>
<p>which generally is sold as a powder or a capsule,</p>
<p>typically consumed early in the day</p>
<p>because it can be somewhat of a stimulant,</p>
<p>meaning it can increase alertness</p>
<p>and you wouldn&rsquo;t want it to interfere with sleep</p>
<p>by taking it too late in the day.</p>
<p>But in studies that include both men and women</p>
<p>of durations anywhere from eight to 12 weeks</p>
<p>of athletes and non-athletes</p>
<p>and different variations of MACA,</p>
<p>it turns out there&rsquo;s black MACA, red MACA, yellow MACA,</p>
<p>there are a bunch of different forms of MACA,</p>
<p>but that they can increase subjective reports</p>
<p>of sexual desire independent of hormone systems,</p>
<p>meaning it does not seem,</p>
<p>at least based on the existing literature,</p>
<p>that MACA increases testosterone or changes estrogen,</p>
<p>at least not on the timescales that these studies were done</p>
<p>or with the measures that were performed in these studies.</p>
<p>But that MACA, again, consumed in doses of anywhere</p>
<p>from two to three grams per day</p>
<p>has been shown to significantly increase libido.</p>
<p>And in fact, those dosages of MACA have been shown</p>
<p>to offset so-called SSRI induced sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p>So there are various routes to sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p>The SSRIs are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.</p>
<p>They go by name brands like Prozac and Zoloft</p>
<p>and there are many others now</p>
<p>and generic forms and so forth.</p>
<p>Those don&rsquo;t always, I should point out,</p>
<p>lead to sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dose dependence.</p>
<p>Some people do quite well on SSRIs</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have any issues with sexual function.</p>
<p>Other people suffer quite a lot from sexual dysfunction</p>
<p>while taking SSRIs, highly variable.</p>
<p>You need to work with a physician, a qualified psychiatrist.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, everything I&rsquo;ve been saying about MACA</p>
<p>thus far has also been explored in the context</p>
<p>of SSRI induced sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p>The paper that I&rsquo;m referring to here</p>
<p>is a double-blind randomized pilot dose finding study</p>
<p>of MACA root.</p>
<p>It goes by the name L-Mayeni.</p>
<p>These always have fancy names</p>
<p>and the Latin names in biology are always more complicated,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s MACA root for the management</p>
<p>of SSRI induced sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p>First author is Dording, D-O-R-D-I-N-G.</p>
<p>This was a study done at Mass General,</p>
<p>which is one of the satellite locations</p>
<p>around Harvard Med, it&rsquo;s associated with Harvard Med,</p>
<p>that found significant improvements in libido</p>
<p>when people were taking a pretty low dose.</p>
<p>It was actually, in this case, just 1.5 grams per day</p>
<p>up to a high dose, three grams per day of MACA.</p>
<p>And they were doing this in 20 remitted depressed</p>
<p>outpatients, so these are people that had depression.</p>
<p>Their depression was successfully treated with SSRIs,</p>
<p>but they were suffering from some of these SSRI</p>
<p>related sexual effects and MACA seemed to offset</p>
<p>some of those effects significantly in this population.</p>
<p>The other studies exploring the lack of effect</p>
<p>on serum testosterone in adult healthy men</p>
<p>was a 12-week study, again, consuming anywhere</p>
<p>from 1.5 to 3 milligrams, meaning 1, excuse me,</p>
<p>1,500 milligrams to 3,000 milligrams or placebo.</p>
<p>So again, this is 1.5 up to three grams</p>
<p>of MACA or placebo, and they rated sexual desire,</p>
<p>depression and other measures such as testosterone</p>
<p>in the blood, again, no change in testosterone</p>
<p>or estrogen, estradiol levels in men treated with MACA</p>
<p>and those treated with placebo.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, there was a significant</p>
<p>and positive effect on libido with this dosage</p>
<p>of 1.5 to three grams per day of MACA.</p>
<p>And there are several other studies that also show this,</p>
<p>again, in people that are taking SSRIs</p>
<p>and people that are not taking SSRIs.</p>
<p>In chronically over-trained athletes,</p>
<p>this was also found to be the case.</p>
<p>So it seems like across the board,</p>
<p>MACA is a fairly useful supplement</p>
<p>for those that are seeking to increase their libido.</p>
<p>And there are fewer studies involving women,</p>
<p>but there are a few such studies that also point</p>
<p>to the same general positive effect on libido</p>
<p>in women taking MACA at equivalent doses</p>
<p>to those I just described.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s noteworthy that MACA supplementation</p>
<p>does not seem to adjust testosterone or estrogen levels</p>
<p>to any significant degree, but it does change libido.</p>
<p>I think that points to the fact</p>
<p>that there are multiple systems in the brain and body</p>
<p>that influence libido, not just testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>And indeed, we know that to be the case.</p>
<p>Things like PEA, which is a substance found in chocolate</p>
<p>and is a substance that some people supplement,</p>
<p>is known, for instance, to increase sexual desire,</p>
<p>but also the perception of sexual experiences</p>
<p>as more stimulating, for instance.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of pathways in the brain,</p>
<p>in particular in the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>this ancient area of our brain that harbors neurons</p>
<p>and hormone-secreting cells, including neurons,</p>
<p>that can shape our perceptions</p>
<p>of even just our tactile experience</p>
<p>of others and their attractiveness,</p>
<p>and indeed can shift levels of desire</p>
<p>independent of changing levels of circulating hormones.</p>
<p>Another substance that has been shown to increase libido</p>
<p>across a range of human populations</p>
<p>is so-called tongkat ali.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about this</p>
<p>before on the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>in reference to testosterone,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked about it extensively</p>
<p>as a guest on other podcasts.</p>
<p>Tongkat ali goes by a number of different names.</p>
<p>One of them is exceedingly difficult for me to pronounce.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s uricoma longifolia, also called longjack,</p>
<p>but tongkat ali is the typical name.</p>
<p>This is an herb.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Malaysian version and an Indonesian version.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the Indonesian variety</p>
<p>of tongkat ali is the one that is most potent</p>
<p>for its effects on libido.</p>
<p>Previously, I&rsquo;ve talked about tongkat ali</p>
<p>taken in 400 milligram per day capsules</p>
<p>as a means to increase the amount of free,</p>
<p>meaning unbound testosterone.</p>
<p>So testosterone has a both bound form and an unbound form.</p>
<p>Very briefly, the bound form is bound to albumin</p>
<p>in the blood or to so-called sex hormone binding globulin.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s bound,</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t be biologically active at many cells.</p>
<p>It is important that some of it be bound</p>
<p>in order to get a sort of time release</p>
<p>and proper distribution of testosterone through the body,</p>
<p>but is the unbound free testosterone</p>
<p>that can really have its most potent effects.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some evidence that tongkat ali</p>
<p>can increase the amount of unbound</p>
<p>so-called free testosterone</p>
<p>by lowering sex hormone binding globulin.</p>
<p>Although it is almost certain</p>
<p>that it has other routes of mechanism as well.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are some reports</p>
<p>of tongkat ali increasing libido.</p>
<p>One particular article, last author,</p>
<p>or I should say last name of first author, excuse me,</p>
<p>Ismail, I-S-M-A-L.</p>
<p>This was published in Evidence-Based Complementary</p>
<p>and Alternative Medicine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from 2012.</p>
<p>Reports a significant increase</p>
<p>in libido and sexual function.</p>
<p>There are other such studies, not a lot of them,</p>
<p>not as many robust,</p>
<p>controlled quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>as there are from MACA.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a number of people, men and women,</p>
<p>that I know do take tongkat ali</p>
<p>and it seems to work well for them.</p>
<p>The question always comes up</p>
<p>around discussion of supplements.</p>
<p>Do you need to cycle these things?</p>
<p>The only way to determine that</p>
<p>is really to do your blood work,</p>
<p>monitor liver enzymes, monitor hormone levels and so forth.</p>
<p>So I simply can&rsquo;t say whether or not you need to</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t need to cycle them.</p>
<p>Typically, tongkat ali and MACA are not cycled</p>
<p>in any regular kind of way that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>But again, you really need to check with your doctor</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to initiate taking any of these things.</p>
<p>And you certainly should do your best</p>
<p>to monitor your blood work</p>
<p>as well as subjective measures</p>
<p>and evaluating whether or not they&rsquo;re working for you,</p>
<p>safe for you and so forth.</p>
<p>The third and final substance slash supplement</p>
<p>that I want to touch on as it relates to libido</p>
<p>is called tribulus terrestris.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s T-R-I-B-U-L-U-S terrestris, T-E-R-R-E-S-T-R-I-S.</p>
<p>This is a commonly sold over-the-counter supplement</p>
<p>for increasing testosterone,</p>
<p>for fitness purposes and so on.</p>
<p>Whether or not it actually does that</p>
<p>to a meaningful degree isn&rsquo;t clear,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m aware of four peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>that were focused on both males and females</p>
<p>ranging anywhere from 18 years old</p>
<p>all the way up to 65 plus, they say 65 plus,</p>
<p>I guess it could be 70, it could be 80, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but a fairly broad age range</p>
<p>where people took anywhere from 750 milligrams per day</p>
<p>divided into three equal doses.</p>
<p>So 750 total per day divided into three equal doses</p>
<p>of tribulus or placebo for 120 days.</p>
<p>This particular study was focused on females</p>
<p>and according to the female sexual function</p>
<p>index questionnaire, no significant difference</p>
<p>between any of the groups.</p>
<p>However, free and bioavailable testosterone</p>
<p>increased in the group taking tribulus terrestris,</p>
<p>total testosterone did not reach statistical significance.</p>
<p>So this is sort of the inverse of what we see with maca</p>
<p>where there do seem to be increases in testosterone,</p>
<p>which would predict that there would be increase in libido.</p>
<p>In this case, this was post-menopausal women,</p>
<p>there was no increase in libido,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t increase in testosterone.</p>
<p>I mention it only because there might be instances</p>
<p>in which people want to increase their testosterone.</p>
<p>It does seem that tribulus, at least in that population,</p>
<p>is capable of doing that.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a separate study that was done,</p>
<p>a double-blind study lasting anywhere from one to six months</p>
<p>that had a clear and significant increase in libido.</p>
<p>Now this was taking six grams,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s 6,000 milligrams of tribulus root for 60 days.</p>
<p>And it did seem to increase various aspects</p>
<p>of sexual function.</p>
<p>And there was a, what appeared to be a substantial</p>
<p>16.3% increase in testosterone,</p>
<p>but in this particular study,</p>
<p>because of the variability across individuals</p>
<p>that did not actually arrive at statistical significance.</p>
<p>Now there were a number of other studies</p>
<p>that explored the role of tribulus in particular in females.</p>
<p>And one of those studies was a study</p>
<p>that was actually quite short.</p>
<p>It was two to four weeks, it involved 67 subjects.</p>
<p>These were subjects that had experienced a loss of libido</p>
<p>and took tribulus, divided into two equal doses,</p>
<p>compared that to placebo.</p>
<p>And they did see a significant improvement</p>
<p>in these measures of sexual desire and function</p>
<p>on this female sexual function index.</p>
<p>So there is some evidence that tribulus can be effective</p>
<p>in increasing testosterone in certain populations,</p>
<p>in increasing sexual desire and function,</p>
<p>in certain populations, in particular in females.</p>
<p>I think more studies are certainly needed,</p>
<p>but these three substances slash supplements,</p>
<p>maca, tonga ali in particular,</p>
<p>Indonesian tonga ali and tribulus</p>
<p>can indeed create significant increases in sexual desire.</p>
<p>And in some cases by adjusting the testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen system, in some cases,</p>
<p>not by adjusting the testosterone and estrogen system,</p>
<p>again, pointing to the complexity of neurochemicals</p>
<p>and features that adjust things like libido, aka desire.</p>
<p>So we covered a lot of material today</p>
<p>related to desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>And yet I acknowledge that it is not exhaustive</p>
<p>of the vast landscape that is the psychology and biology</p>
<p>of desire, love, and attachment.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I hope that you found the information</p>
<p>interesting and hopefully actionable in some cases</p>
<p>toward the relationships of your past, of present,</p>
<p>and potentially for the relationships of your future.</p>
