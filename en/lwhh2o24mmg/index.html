Eric</p><p>Berg but practiced for 27 years I&rsquo;m a</p><p>chiropractor a health educator I don&rsquo;t</p><p>do chiropractic anymore I do more</p><p>basically health education and nutrition</p><p>I worked in my clinic over with on over</p><p>45,000 people over the 27 years taught</p><p>at Howard University as an associate</p><p>professor in the nutrition department</p><p>best-selling author the seven principles</p><p>of fat burning don&rsquo;t get that book</p><p>because there&rsquo;s a new one coming out in</p><p>January with lots of updates trained</p><p>over 2,500 doctors and alternative</p><p>medicine including many medical doctors</p><p>so I actually trained medical doctors in</p><p>alternative health care I&rsquo;ve delivered</p><p>over 4,900 seminars to a lot of</p><p>different agencies governmental agencies</p><p>churches other groups over the years I</p><p>like to teach people right now I&rsquo;m doing</p><p>a lot of YouTube videos on health every</p><p>possible subject of Health I have over</p><p>thirteen hundred and twenty six nine</p><p>views I get about two and a half million</p><p>views every single 28 days to me and I&rsquo;m</p><p>also the developer of the four body type</p><p>philosophy of weight loss okay now just</p><p>as a personal thing the reason I got</p><p>into this which is actually a really</p><p>good thing I got really sick when I was</p><p>a kid the only thing that I ate is sugar</p><p>I was</p><p>I would just stand on the cupboards</p><p>looking for sugar and just I never eat</p><p>one vegetable John was 21 years old will</p><p>it caught up with me</p><p>I had hypoglycemia low blood sugar when</p><p>I was 11 and it kept getting worse worse</p><p>worse worse I got into wrestling I went</p><p>to state I would be undefeated for the</p><p>first part of the season that would be</p><p>completely exhausted at the last part</p><p>because my nutrition was so bad not to</p><p>mention trying to cut weight join the</p><p>military I barely passed the PT test</p><p>after basic training because of the</p><p>amount of stress I was under at that</p><p>time and no sleep and of course they fed</p><p>you a lot of sugar um so anyway I was</p><p>going along a start getting arthritis</p><p>digestive problems insomnia when I hit</p><p>28 that was that&rsquo;s when I hit my lowest</p><p>point of my life I was a mess okay so to</p><p>make a long story short that forced me</p><p>out of necessity to find other solutions</p><p>to see if I can help myself and since</p><p>then I&rsquo;ve been obsessively studying</p><p>nutrition in the learning about the body</p><p>and teaching how the body works in</p><p>researching like 24/7 so that&rsquo;s pretty</p><p>much all I do I like to teach the truth</p><p>about health and in this presentation</p><p>we&rsquo;re going to get right into a really</p><p>important subject that relates to</p><p>insulin and blood sugars and if you</p><p>follow these recommendations not only</p><p>can you improve your blood sugar profile</p><p>and maybe even reverse your insulin</p><p>situation or your diabetic situation but</p><p>you can definitely be a lot closer to</p><p>preventing diabetes now I know I&rsquo;m not</p><p>making any claims that&rsquo;s against the law</p><p>so this is my disclaimer if you have any</p><p>medical conditions check with your</p><p>doctor before applying any of these</p><p>recommendations okay this is just food</p><p>for thought and if you get better don&rsquo;t</p><p>blame it on me alright good</p><p>so the root of the problem I always like</p><p>to get to the root of it has to do with</p><p>insulin okay so for we have a diabetic</p><p>or a pre-diabetic or a hypoglycemic</p><p>person insulin is at the root of the</p><p>problem now what&rsquo;s interesting about</p><p>insulin and I&rsquo;m going to define that in</p><p>a second</p><p>so if anyone doesn&rsquo;t know what that</p><p>means I&rsquo;ll get to it is that the body</p><p>will do everything it can to maintain</p><p>normal blood values okay does everything</p><p>it needs to be at a very constant rate</p><p>it does not like to bury and so insulin</p><p>is that hormone that helps stabilize the</p><p>blood sugars to maintain this constancy</p><p>okay a very narrow band</p><p>so insulin really has to work really</p><p>hard at well it&rsquo;s basically it lowers</p><p>the blood sugar okay so let me just show</p><p>you a picture of what it does here&rsquo;s a</p><p>picture of the pancreas it&rsquo;s Glander</p><p>Neath your left ribcage and it&rsquo;s a small</p><p>gland that secretes this hormone called</p><p>insulin that then is triggered in</p><p>response to carbohydrates especially in</p><p>the form of sugar and wine and juice and</p><p>these other things and what its job is</p><p>to get the excess sugar out of the blood</p><p>okay that&rsquo;s what it does why why is it</p><p>so important because when you have high</p><p>sugars it&rsquo;s very very dangerous</p><p>apparently sugar is very bad on the body</p><p>so I mean like take a look let&rsquo;s take an</p><p>auto out-of-control diabetic what do</p><p>they have they go blind their feet fall</p><p>off they get gangrene they get art</p><p>clogged arteries to get strokes so it&rsquo;s</p><p>very bad to have too much sugar in the</p><p>body so insulin has to work hard to</p><p>clean it out okay so insulin lowers the</p><p>sugar in the blood okay got down</p><p>now what does it do with it after it</p><p>lowers like when it gives out the blood</p><p>what does it do with it that&rsquo;s the</p><p>question where does it go well the body</p><p>has three main ways that it gets rid of</p><p>this sugar okay number one it drives it</p><p>into the cell now that&rsquo;s a good thing</p><p>because we need some insulin we need</p><p>some ins then we just don&rsquo;t need too</p><p>much</p><p>you can&rsquo;t live without insulin so one of</p><p>the functions is removing it from the</p><p>blood and then putting it into the cell</p><p>as like a nutrition like a fuel so your</p><p>body can run on on glucose or sugar okay</p><p>that&rsquo;s purpose number one number two it</p><p>also stores the sugar as stored sugar</p><p>it&rsquo;s called glycogen what does glycogen</p><p>basically a bunch of little you can see</p><p>on this chart these little glucose</p><p>molecules attached so it&rsquo;s a bunch of</p><p>sugar attached okay and that&rsquo;s called</p><p>stored sugar or glycogen it&rsquo;s stored in</p><p>the liver and stored in the muscles the</p><p>reason why you have stored glycogen is</p><p>is it&rsquo;s a quick release of sugar if you</p><p>need it fast if you like if you&rsquo;re</p><p>running down the street something like</p><p>that you need quick energy then we have</p><p>stored as fat okay so that&rsquo;s more for a</p><p>rainy day if you need it later so so</p><p>insulin feeds the cells store sugar as</p><p>stored sugar called glycogen or it store</p><p>sugar as fats that she if there&rsquo;s any</p><p>excess okay got that three main purposes</p><p>good we&rsquo;re making good time here now so</p><p>the fuel that goes in the cell is fed by</p><p>sugar and your but here&rsquo;s the thing</p><p>sometimes people think they have to eat</p><p>sugar to get sugar but everything pretty</p><p>much you eat turns into sugar eventually</p><p>and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about like</p><p>we want a nice slow input of fuel to the</p><p>cells okay alright so</p><p>the basics because I&rsquo;m going to build on</p><p>this so drive sugar into the cell into</p><p>your brain into the muscle into the</p><p>liver it converts sugar into stored</p><p>sugar and it also converts sugar into</p><p>fat cholesterol the bad cholesterol LDL</p><p>and triglycerides which are blood fats</p><p>so if you have high cholesterol if you</p><p>have high triglycerides we know that you</p><p>have too much sugar in the diet</p><p>and this is the confusing thing for</p><p>people because they&rsquo;ve been taught that</p><p>it&rsquo;s the cholesterol you&rsquo;re eating that</p><p>caused high cholesterol more on this</p><p>later but that&rsquo;s not true it&rsquo;s the sugar</p><p>I get I can prove it all you have to do</p><p>is cut up the sugar and your cholesterol</p><p>will come right down and sold</p><p>triglycerides now now let&rsquo;s just kind of</p><p>keep defining things so you really get a</p><p>grasp on what a normal blood sugar means</p><p>because when you have doctor you take oh</p><p>yeah your blood sugars are normal what</p><p>does that mean well normal is roughly</p><p>between 90 and 100 Camila got 90 to 110</p><p>okay that&rsquo;s considered normal let&rsquo;s see</p><p>it&rsquo;s a narrow band the body doesn&rsquo;t like</p><p>to go too high or too low so what that</p><p>means is you basically have one teaspoon</p><p>of sugar in your entire body into into</p><p>your entire blood so the ratio of one</p><p>teaspoon per all of your blood which is</p><p>one in one-third gallon of blood okay</p><p>that would that&rsquo;s the dilution or the</p><p>ratio of sugar you really need so is</p><p>that a lot or is that a little that&rsquo;s a</p><p>very tiny amount so you don&rsquo;t need a lot</p><p>of sugar do so so basically that&rsquo;s now</p><p>you know if your blood sugars are normal</p><p>then basically that&rsquo;s kind of the ratio</p><p>it&rsquo;s just a very slight amount of sugar</p><p>people are surprised okay now what</p><p>happens</p><p>too much sugar okay the sugar Rises and</p><p>that&rsquo;s called hyper glycaemia hyper</p><p>meaning high glycaemia making sugar</p><p>that&rsquo;s diabetes if your sugar is too</p><p>high okay</p><p>now normally the sugar does increase</p><p>after you read but it&rsquo;s just not going</p><p>to go too high and it kind of might go</p><p>up in a kind of goes down because the</p><p>instance coming in there but when you</p><p>lose control of insulin and it goes too</p><p>high that&rsquo;s called diabetes or</p><p>hyperglycemia okay now when it goes too</p><p>low it&rsquo;s called hypoglycemia let me</p><p>explain what happens hypoglycemia is a</p><p>pre-diabetic situation so at first you</p><p>know when you eat sugar like me when I</p><p>was 11 eating tons of sugar the insulin</p><p>would come in really hard and push the</p><p>sugar down way too far okay and then up</p><p>with like lightheadedness blood sugar</p><p>feeling kind of irritable craving sweets</p><p>all those are hypoglycemic symptoms okay</p><p>makes sense so here&rsquo;s the problem when</p><p>you eat too much sugar over too much</p><p>time you develop hypoglycemia then</p><p>something called insulin resistance</p><p>basically it&rsquo;s a situation your body&rsquo;s</p><p>blocking insulin doesn&rsquo;t accept it</p><p>anymore and then you get diabetes type 2</p><p>and then you get diabetes type 1 okay</p><p>that&rsquo;s the kind of the worsening of the</p><p>this was spiral when I talked about this</p><p>in the blog I had some people disagree</p><p>with some of the data and they says well</p><p>wait a second no diabetes type 2 doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>turn on in fact one as I said it&rsquo;s a</p><p>type 1 is a genetic thing or it&rsquo;s an</p><p>autoimmune well that&rsquo;s basically they&rsquo;re</p><p>telling you that because that&rsquo;s what</p><p>they&rsquo;ve been told on some websites I</p><p>will guarantee you the type 2 can turn</p><p>into type 1 if you take a diabetic type</p><p>2 I mean think about what happens to</p><p>type tubes they get worse</p><p>and one of the doctors give them they</p><p>inject it with insulin eventually they</p><p>are taking insulin so now they actually</p><p>because they run out and they become a</p><p>type one it&rsquo;s very common</p><p>now is it true that you can have other</p><p>causes absolutely autoimmune is one okay</p><p>so your body&rsquo;s attacking it but the</p><p>question is what causes autoimmune</p><p>they don&rsquo;t know but I observed an</p><p>interesting thing that happens with</p><p>diabetics that turn in type 1 and it&rsquo;s</p><p>nearly always actually it&rsquo;s not nearly</p><p>it&rsquo;s always in my in moderation it&rsquo;s</p><p>always occurring after a stress event</p><p>okay some shock stress could be loss of</p><p>a loved one some stress like I&rsquo;ll give</p><p>you an example I knew this guy he um he</p><p>had Bell&rsquo;s palsy where he lost the</p><p>feeling on one side of his face it&rsquo;s a</p><p>nerve that started atrophy so they</p><p>injected a steroid shot okay that&rsquo;s</p><p>adrenal hormones and then he ended with</p><p>type 1 diabetes on him so that&rsquo;s that</p><p>injection shocked the system because</p><p>there&rsquo;s too much a drug okay so that&rsquo;s</p><p>just an example alright so I just want</p><p>to clear that up but check this out an</p><p>average American consumes 31 teaspoons</p><p>of sugar every single day now that is</p><p>freakin crazy see why we get diabetes I</p><p>mean for someone to say that Oh diabetes</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t come from eating too much sugar</p><p>or it doesn&rsquo;t come from anything other</p><p>that&rsquo;s genetic or autoimmune well wait a</p><p>second but it&rsquo;s completely illogical</p><p>because so many people consume so much</p><p>sugar don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s happening</p><p>impact don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s the most</p><p>likely cause of this problem</p><p>I mean it&rsquo;s and everything you eat it</p><p>does</p><p>affect your body I mean it&rsquo;s the obvious</p><p>thing so what happens when you consume</p><p>too much sugar too long your body</p><p>considers it a poison so it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>reject it remember because your body&rsquo;s</p><p>trying to keep the normal insulin it 90</p><p>to 100 doesn&rsquo;t like to go too high or</p><p>too low so what happens is that the</p><p>thing that receives the insulin is</p><p>called a receptor for insulin that</p><p>starts to block the insulin okay starts</p><p>to resist it so it&rsquo;s kind of like if you</p><p>were to be around someone that&rsquo;s that</p><p>talks so much and they never shut up</p><p>they keep talking eventually you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to phase them out you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>ignore them well the thing is when you</p><p>ignore anyone guess what they do they</p><p>start talking more they increase the</p><p>volume don&rsquo;t they try to ignore</p><p>something so you try to know your spouse</p><p>and see what they do they&rsquo;ll start</p><p>talking louder now so what happens you</p><p>develop a condition called insulin</p><p>resistance which is basically the cells</p><p>are resisting insulin so what&rsquo;s going to</p><p>happen to inside the cell we&rsquo;re not</p><p>going to drive the sugar in there</p><p>anymore so we&rsquo;re going to basically</p><p>starve the cell the brain the muscle of</p><p>fuel</p><p>okay that&rsquo;s where you get the cravings</p><p>that&rsquo;s where you get the fatigue that&rsquo;s</p><p>where you get the feeling of lapping</p><p>satisfied after you read okay but what</p><p>happens a signals setback to the</p><p>pancreas and it&rsquo;s going to tell the</p><p>pancreas hey we have a low insulin</p><p>increase more so insulin resistance is a</p><p>situation where the body has resisting</p><p>insulin and it&rsquo;s a situation where you</p><p>have in certain parts your body too much</p><p>insulin and other places not enough</p><p>insulin now if we don&rsquo;t have enough</p><p>insulin in the blood what&rsquo;s going to</p><p>happen to the high sugar it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>keep going higher that&rsquo;s called diabetes</p><p>so all diabetic cases have insulin</p><p>resistance</p><p>insulin resistance is a pre-diabetic it</p><p>happens right after hyperglycemia I</p><p>progressed a man in some resistance</p><p>diabetes type 2 okay and in insulin</p><p>resistance is really interesting because</p><p>when it gets it starts off small and it</p><p>gets worse right so when it first starts</p><p>off you might go to the doctor and get</p><p>your blood test and it might be normal</p><p>because it hasn&rsquo;t your body is still not</p><p>that bad okay it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s resisting</p><p>it a little bit so the insulin is going</p><p>higher to compensate for the low insulin</p><p>side of the cell but we still have</p><p>normal values then what happens over a</p><p>period of time it gets worse to the</p><p>point where now it&rsquo;s started affecting</p><p>your blood Sugar&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m saying</p><p>this is that this is very difficult to</p><p>test for when you check blood sugars</p><p>because you go to doctor he says oh</p><p>we&rsquo;ve checked your blood sugars we</p><p>checked your a1c which is an average</p><p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s for three months</p><p>everything&rsquo;s normal</p><p>you don&rsquo;t have any problem yeah but you</p><p>might have insulin resistance because</p><p>you could have this look like a</p><p>pre-diabetic State so what I suggest you</p><p>do if you have these symptoms let&rsquo;s go</p><p>get in a fasting insulin assessment or</p><p>test lot of fasting glucose but a</p><p>fasting insulin because that&rsquo;s going to</p><p>show a lot more insulin in your blood</p><p>even though</p><p>might not be affecting it because your</p><p>body&rsquo;s compensating it&rsquo;s a really good</p><p>test so a real true insulin resistant</p><p>case has five to seven times more</p><p>insulin than a normal person so so</p><p>that&rsquo;s how you were diagnosed it okay</p><p>all right so now</p><p>let me just come back here for a second</p><p>if when you become a diabetic type 2 you</p><p>see that receptor right there that</p><p>receptor when you&rsquo;re type 2 is really</p><p>resisting it so what happens you take</p><p>either metformin or glucophage the</p><p>medication which makes the receptor more</p><p>receptive it makes the glucose work</p><p>better in the insulin work better and</p><p>that&rsquo;s how diabetes type 2 medication</p><p>works it doesn&rsquo;t give you insulin it</p><p>just makes the insulin work better in</p><p>the body okay the problem is that it&rsquo;s</p><p>doing it artificially it&rsquo;s forcing your</p><p>body to accept something&rsquo;s trying to</p><p>reject so it has side effects but the</p><p>point is that that&rsquo;s how diabetes type 2</p><p>medication works okay so look at this</p><p>here we get the pink wrist you eat a big</p><p>carbohydrate meal it says uh we better</p><p>screen insulin to get it out of the</p><p>blood right well you have insulin</p><p>resistance and then it blocks the low</p><p>blood sugar but it&rsquo;s going to actually</p><p>the low insulin will kick create low</p><p>blood sugar inside the cell inside the</p><p>brain inside the muscle but it creates</p><p>high sugar in the blood so you got</p><p>certain places that are too high certain</p><p>places do well okay that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s</p><p>confusing but now I hope I helped you</p><p>understand a bit how this works but if</p><p>like again if you&rsquo;re getting a poor</p><p>acknowledgment like someone&rsquo;s not</p><p>acknowledging you&rsquo;ll tend to talk more</p><p>that&rsquo;s insulin resistance okay so if I</p><p>take a normal cell on your left and an</p><p>insulin resistance cell you can see the</p><p>cell has starving of fuel okay an</p><p>insulin resistance and here are the</p><p>symptoms belly fat any belly fat is</p><p>coming from insulin okay that&rsquo;s an</p><p>insulin belly if I look around and see</p><p>some of the fat belly I instantly know</p><p>they have too much insulin okay fatty</p><p>liver</p><p>yeah people that a big bellies have</p><p>fatty liver to go hand-in-hand brain fog</p><p>belly bloat sand swells</p><p>sleepy after meals classic not satisfied</p><p>after meals need little something sweet</p><p>high blood pressure cravings for carbs</p><p>and sweets inflammation your nation</p><p>frequency at night cannot go without</p><p>sleeping from one minute I&rsquo;m sorry</p><p>cannot go without eating from one meal</p><p>to the next excessive hunger because the</p><p>cells are starved being forced to be</p><p>having a snack at night or between meals</p><p>okay these are all symptoms of insulin</p><p>resistance now some of you have these</p><p>symptoms so make notes as we go through</p><p>this because I&rsquo;m going to show you how</p><p>to correct this system if I could do</p><p>anything for anyone this would be</p><p>probably the most valuable because I can</p><p>prevent a lot of problems down the road</p><p>as you&rsquo;re going to see just by getting</p><p>the diet corrected now if I die a</p><p>nutrition so weak read that and you&rsquo;ve</p><p>done a lot of problems and you can clear</p><p>up a lot of these issues and it&rsquo;s not</p><p>very hard it&rsquo;s very easy if you know if</p><p>you understand some people not going to</p><p>mention any names or professions would</p><p>like you to believe that once you get it</p><p>you can&rsquo;t get rid of it you&rsquo;re stuck</p><p>with additional care no one understands</p><p>it bla bla bla</p><p>okay I don&rsquo;t buy that so we talked about</p><p>these people with insulin resistance</p><p>have higher fasting asan seven to ten</p><p>five to seven times yeah normal that&rsquo;s</p><p>incredible now I just have to define</p><p>again let&rsquo;s just define diabetes type</p><p>two type two is that insulin receptor</p><p>problem your body isn&rsquo;t accepting it so</p><p>we don&rsquo;t get the return communication so</p><p>then look it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like insulin</p><p>resistance more severe because now the</p><p>blood sugars are going to go higher so</p><p>it&rsquo;s high sugar because the cells are</p><p>not receiving insulin and you buy is</p><p>pumping out more but the insulin is not</p><p>risk the insulin is not working like it</p><p>should that&rsquo;s</p><ul><li>so I mean you could give someone</li></ul><p>insulin - to help this but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>like using a sledgehammer because you</p><p>don&rsquo;t need to do that so what they do is</p><p>they give you another medication to fix</p><p>the receptors for insulin to make them</p><p>work better and a lot of this happens in</p><p>the liver okay and I&rsquo;ll get into that in</p><p>about three slides but the liver is a</p><p>real key organ in correcting diabetes</p><p>now when you when you have type 2 you</p><p>can also then turn it with type 1 and</p><p>again this can be coming from other</p><p>causes - like stress we&rsquo;ll get into that</p><p>but I&rsquo;m talking about in this case it</p><p>coming from the diet getting too much</p><p>sugar too long and not changing your</p><p>ways so now here&rsquo;s diabetes type 1 is</p><p>where the pancreas is completely</p><p>exhausted and it doesn&rsquo;t have any more</p><p>insulin so therefore guess what&rsquo;s get up</p><p>near blood sugars it&rsquo;s going to go way</p><p>way higher really high and it&rsquo;s</p><p>dangerous and when you don&rsquo;t have</p><p>insulin you&rsquo;re going to have to have it</p><p>injected okay so they have to control</p><p>every time they eat it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a problem</p><p>so now we have out-of-control blood</p><p>sugars okay</p><p>that&rsquo;s what type 1 is now check this out</p><p>there&rsquo;s more effects of insulin more</p><p>side effects treatments look at this</p><p>dementia insulin causes amyloid plaque</p><p>on the brain causing dimension in our</p><p>Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s okay it&rsquo;s</p><p>like that Alzheimer&rsquo;s is like diabetes</p><p>type 3 then it will actually clog</p><p>arteries causing a stroke</p><p>it makes weak blood vessels because it</p><p>does control the proteins in the body</p><p>and you get an aneurysm or a stroke</p><p>so to get a clog you&rsquo;re getting the</p><p>artery blows out having stroke or it</p><p>gets clogged in the brain you get a</p><p>stroke high cholesterol high blood</p><p>pressure a fatty liver diabetes heart</p><p>disease clogged arteries these are all</p><p>symptoms and not diseases</p><p>they&rsquo;re symptoms of insulin see what I</p><p>told you before is if we could correct</p><p>and heal insulin we can prevent a lot of</p><p>problems and I&rsquo;d like the simplicity of</p><p>focusing on one thing and you will see</p><p>not only going to lose weight and what</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you to do but you can</p><p>actually correct a lot of problems with</p><p>blood sugars and have I ever helped</p><p>anyone blood sugars this is a sensitive</p><p>area because I can get in trouble if I</p><p>help too many people so I&rsquo;m just going</p><p>to tell you that I&rsquo;ve had a lot of</p><p>people who have worked with with the</p><p>help of their doctors to stick it in</p><p>there um you know because doctor</p><p>controls the medication part I&rsquo;m</p><p>controlling the food part and eating in</p><p>the health so I&rsquo;ve taken help women or</p><p>this several women that I know that were</p><p>actually had very very bad type 1</p><p>diabetics okay and then they went from</p><p>type 1 type type 2 and now they&rsquo;re up</p><p>all the medication completely okay but</p><p>again I&rsquo;m not going to make any claims</p><p>because I don&rsquo;t want to step on any toes</p><p>if you know what I mean</p><p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of my clients were</p><p>type 2 and they&rsquo;re off all their</p><p>medication type 2 is a lot easier type</p><p>one you can still work with them but</p><p>again if you&rsquo;re going to do this suggest</p><p>with your doctor before making any</p><p>changes again it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a very</p><p>profitable industry and again they don&rsquo;t</p><p>like anyone um you know creating</p><p>conflicting informations but I think</p><p>it&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re educated unless so</p><p>you can make up a choice because it&rsquo;s</p><p>your body and my whole goal is to give</p><p>you the information to think with and</p><p>research further okay now check this out</p><p>we have the liver which is a hundred</p><p>times bigger than the pancreas okay so</p><p>it&rsquo;s a huge organ on the right ribcage</p><p>the liver controls blood Sugar&rsquo;s when</p><p>you do not eat</p><p>the pancreas can controls blood sugars</p><p>when you&rsquo;re eating so they reciprocate</p><p>back and forth back and forth back and</p><p>forth let me ask you a question how much</p><p>more times you eat versus when you don&rsquo;t</p><p>eat well you might say well I eat all</p><p>that long yeah well that&rsquo;s the problem</p><p>because the liver is bigger because it</p><p>has to maintain this blood sugars</p><p>between your between eating and it</p><p>produces a hormone called insulin like</p><p>growth factor number one and so that&rsquo;s</p><p>the hormone that basically mobilizes</p><p>stored sugar in fat and then raises the</p><p>sugar and then insulin brings sugar down</p><p>so we have this nice little balance if</p><p>you were just to improve liver function</p><p>by 20% you can improve the pancreatic</p><p>function by 80% and that&rsquo;s just</p><p>something I&rsquo;ve stumbled on and we&rsquo;ll</p><p>talk about what to do but I just want</p><p>you to get the concept of diabetes is</p><p>not just a pancreas problem it&rsquo;s a liver</p><p>problem it&rsquo;s an adrenal problem it</p><p>involves a whole body but I&rsquo;m really</p><p>what emphasize that you want to get the</p><p>liver improved if you want to help</p><p>diabetes were prevented especially since</p><p>the liver more likely is filled with fat</p><p>if you have a gut you know if I deliver</p><p>if your fatty liver it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>take some time to undo this it might</p><p>take three years because it takes three</p><p>years to fix the liver and that&rsquo;s the</p><p>problem is sometimes even though you</p><p>might feel better it takes some time</p><p>glycemic index glycemic index is an</p><p>index that measures the blood sugars</p><p>that basically is it&rsquo;s measuring the</p><p>reaction of carbohydrates to blood</p><p>sugars so if you eat a jelly beans for</p><p>example you&rsquo;ll have a sudden spike of</p><p>blood sugars if you eat celery it&rsquo;s</p><p>smaller</p><p>okay so glycemic index is the scale of</p><p>how fast carbohydrates can affect your</p><p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s very simple right</p><p>you already know about this so you can</p><p>see you need a car a carbohydrate boom</p><p>it spikes if you hit a low glycemic</p><p>index food it goes it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very small</p><p>okay</p><p>but the glyph you focus on the glycemic</p><p>index</p><p>you&rsquo;ve only focused on a very small</p><p>piece of nut not a very small you only</p><p>focused on 50% of the problem because</p><p>glucose is only half of the problem and</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t talk about this yet but I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to get into this right now so if</p><p>you&rsquo;ve checked out</p><p>check back in right now I need your</p><p>attention and this is what you need to</p><p>know there are other things that affect</p><p>insulin they</p><p>insolent index or a scale non</p><p>carbohydrates okay this is rather the</p><p>guidance physiology um this is this is</p><p>the medical physiology textbook that I</p><p>used when I went to school and I use in</p><p>pre-med okay and you can see the coffee</p><p>stains because I used to drink massive</p><p>amounts of coffee</p><p>I&rsquo;m talking like pots of coffee to stay</p><p>awake because I was so fatigued and so</p><p>burned out and didn&rsquo;t know anything</p><p>about nutrition at the time all I need</p><p>is a new coffee in Cuban coffee it</p><p>finally caught up with me okay so this</p><p>is what I want to share with you right</p><p>up against physiology there&rsquo;s a couple</p><p>other things that trigger insolent one</p><p>is amino acids which is protein and the</p><p>next one is gastrointestinal hormones</p><p>which is basically every time you eat so</p><p>protein and eating trigger insulin don&rsquo;t</p><p>worry it gets worse here&rsquo;s a scale look</p><p>at how much beef can trigger insulin</p><p>fish wow it&rsquo;s huge now if you combine</p><p>sugar with protein you can really spike</p><p>insulin by more than 2% so barbecued</p><p>ribs breaded meats bun with the burger</p><p>fries or the burger soda with the burger</p><p>ketchup at the burger</p><p>you&rsquo;re just spiking that insulin</p><p>whatever that you&rsquo;re gonna you have a</p><p>lot of brain fog if that happens okay</p><p>so fruit will do it too fruit will</p><p>increase the blood sugars</p><p>but here&rsquo;s the thing that I wanted to</p><p>mention it&rsquo;s not just any protein it&rsquo;s</p><p>specifically low fat proteins trigger</p><p>insulin way higher than fattier proteins</p><p>now think about this you go to the</p><p>grocery store you look around fat-free</p><p>cheese fat-free yogurt fat-free dressing</p><p>fat-free like low fat meat lean meat</p><p>lean chicken take the skin off right do</p><p>you realize that that is going to be</p><p>worse for your blood Sugar&rsquo;s than having</p><p>more fat because here&rsquo;s the interesting</p><p>thing on the insulin scale which I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to go right here look at what&rsquo;s</p><p>very low on the insulin scale butter</p><p>olives coconut flax heavy cream pecans</p><p>avocado bacon in other words the more</p><p>fatty something is the less response it</p><p>has on your insulin okay this goes</p><p>against what you&rsquo;ve been taught this is</p><p>huge</p><p>see it&rsquo;s the thing that people haven&rsquo;t</p><p>done</p><p>they haven&rsquo;t started eating fat okay so</p><p>let me show you something if you had a</p><p>choice let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re diabetic and</p><p>you&rsquo;re the choice between eating fat</p><p>full 100 percent fat filled yogurt</p><p>versus fat free yogurt go with the</p><p>fattiest yogurt if you had a choice</p><p>between whey protein and whole milk</p><p>cheese go with the whole milk cheese go</p><p>with the fattier cheese if you had a</p><p>choice between low-fat cheese and brie</p><p>cheese go with the brie cheese lean fat</p><p>lean meat versus fatty fecal fatty meat</p><p>go with the fatty meat um</p><p>turkey bacon versus other bacon as long</p><p>as it&rsquo;s like nitrate free hormone free</p><p>go with the fatty or bacon um why</p><p>because that will lower insulin Wow this</p><p>is all getting very interesting isn&rsquo;t it</p><p>now some of you are like oh but what</p><p>about my cholesterol right did you</p><p>realize that your body makes cholesterol</p><p>it makes over 3,000 milligrams of</p><p>cholesterol every single day let me tell</p><p>you that&rsquo;s the equivalent of 14 eggs or</p><p>upon the butter or 333 strips of bacon</p><p>when you eat less cholesterol foods your</p><p>body makes more when you eat more your</p><p>body makes less it has a feedback</p><p>mechanism I do four eggs a day they can</p><p>change every single day</p><p>of course my cholesterol is 5,000 now</p><p>I&rsquo;m just kidding now my cholesterol is</p><p>roughly about 160 170 it&rsquo;s well within a</p><p>nice range so your body makes that ton</p><p>of cholesterol now why if clothes are so</p><p>bad why does it make it well first of</p><p>all it&rsquo;s not bad secondly it has a</p><p>purpose it has a purpose to actually</p><p>make hormones especially stress hormones</p><p>it actually helps heal see the</p><p>cholesterol that comes into your</p><p>arteries</p><p>comes in to try to heal some type of</p><p>micro hemorrhage or bleeding hemorrhage</p><p>in your artery wall that&rsquo;s what is</p><p>trying to do so it&rsquo;s trying to help you</p><p>it feeds the lens of the eye so it feeds</p><p>the hormone so you need cholesterol okay</p><p>the bad thing is adding the the sugar</p><p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s converting the cholesterol</p><p>okay now we also talked about eating</p><p>will stimulate insulin too right check</p><p>this out now if you eat lunch breakfast</p><p>and dinner and then a snack a snack and</p><p>a snack at night you are strays insulin</p><p>insulin insulin insulin all day and all</p><p>night</p><p>this is bad we never have a chance for</p><p>the liver to heal and we we&rsquo;re going to</p><p>create insulin resistance okay because</p><p>we have too much insulin too long now I</p><p>am guilty of in my book telling you to</p><p>consume snacks between meals I no longer</p><p>recommend that that&rsquo;s bad advice and I&rsquo;m</p><p>correcting myself now I&rsquo;m sorry about</p><p>that because that is it&rsquo;s not the right</p><p>it&rsquo;s much better to have three meals no</p><p>snacks now the problem is if you are</p><p>inhabited resistance you&rsquo;re going to a</p><p>hard time going from one male to the</p><p>next because you&rsquo;re going to get hungry</p><p>so what you want to do is you want to</p><p>add fat to the meal so you can go longer</p><p>without eating okay now what I just went</p><p>to the farmers market last week and I</p><p>bought some really high-quality</p><p>grass-fed pork sausage okay now it&rsquo;s a</p><p>twelve forty right now and I had</p><p>breakfast at eight o&rsquo;clock okay add the</p><p>pork sausage I&rsquo;m three links I had four</p><p>pegs and some cheese I am not hungry</p><p>right now at all like I am so satisfied</p><p>my system I&rsquo;m actually feeling great I</p><p>don&rsquo;t feel hungry at all so I&rsquo;ll</p><p>probably eat maybe another two hours but</p><p>the point is that you want to go longer</p><p>when I first started this I could be</p><p>able to go for an hour without needing a</p><p>snack because I didn&rsquo;t have enough fat</p><p>you cannot fix diabetes without fat you</p><p>can&rsquo;t fix insulin resistance without by</p><p>doing a lean piece of protein and a</p><p>solid why because you&rsquo;re going to be</p><p>starving all the time I went to a</p><p>restaurant a month ago ordered a steak</p><p>and set a huge salad and they brought me</p><p>a steak and I was starving like ten</p><p>minutes later I&rsquo;m like oh my god I need</p><p>some fat ok now this goes against what</p><p>you&rsquo;ve been taught but this principle</p><p>will really really really really work ok</p><p>ok so what kind of fats olives coconut</p><p>oil peanut butter nuts</p><p>brie cheese all really good fats okay</p><p>now when you wake up in the morning and</p><p>you&rsquo;re not hungry don&rsquo;t you do not eat</p><p>why because your body is eating your</p><p>belly all that long it&rsquo;s eating your fat</p><p>why would you eat you&rsquo;re going to spike</p><p>your insulin again it&rsquo;s going to drop</p><p>down you&rsquo;re going to get hungry so this</p><p>idea that eating stimulates metabolism</p><p>is bad advice not true it actually just</p><p>increases your hunger don&rsquo;t eat if</p><p>you&rsquo;re not hungry</p><p>so let&rsquo;s say you meet at lunch as your</p><p>first meal just do two meals a day it&rsquo;s</p><p>going to be fine you&rsquo;re not going to</p><p>lose muscle protein but the key is not</p><p>to snack anymore so there&rsquo;s three meals</p><p>a day because and here&rsquo;s two meals a day</p><p>so we want you to eat and then the</p><p>switch over for the liver so you can</p><p>burn fat and then burn up the pancreas</p><p>you burn sugar or in fat back and forth</p><p>we want this instant switch to work</p><p>again so we want to heal it too there&rsquo;s</p><p>a couple different ways we want to heal</p><p>it from food and nutrition what else can</p><p>stimulate insulin resistance cortisol</p><p>what&rsquo;s core salt it&rsquo;s a stress hormone</p><p>so stress will increase insulin why</p><p>because cortisol breaks down protein in</p><p>your body body protein and it converts</p><p>it into sugar which then increases</p><p>insulin so yeah we know that cortisol</p><p>causes belly fat but through insulin</p><p>insulin is the real culprit so we want</p><p>to lower stress as well some people have</p><p>the perfect diet they just stressed out</p><p>and they need to fix that okay causes of</p><p>we&rsquo;ve got the diet too much protein</p><p>combination protein sugar snacks between</p><p>meals and stress these are the culprits</p><p>right here insulin is a dominating</p><p>hormone and in that all and this is</p><p>interesting if you checked out check</p><p>back in because this is another</p><p>important point all it takes is a very</p><p>tiny bit of insulin to block a lot of</p><p>fat burning hormones so let&rsquo;s say your</p><p>diet was perfect okay you&rsquo;re exercising</p><p>and you have a little bit of juice a</p><p>half a cup of juice a day that is enough</p><p>insulin spike to bump you out of</p><p>fat-burning for 48 hours especially if</p><p>you&rsquo;re</p><p>slow all it takes is a tiny bit of the</p><p>wrong thing to destroy this fat burning</p><p>process so when you the key to doing</p><p>this is to bring your Sugar&rsquo;s down to</p><p>zero okay I didn&rsquo;t say carbohydrates I</p><p>said I said your sugars don&rsquo;t eat sugar</p><p>okay exercise is also good to stabilize</p><p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s long walks is really good</p><p>but exercise will help you but if you if</p><p>you&rsquo;re an exercise person like you</p><p>really hardcore exercise you may need</p><p>three meals a day but test it out you</p><p>might not stress we talked about that</p><p>nutrition these are the two nutritional</p><p>products that I use for blood sugar</p><p>cases why because the whole cruciferous</p><p>food is the one that supports the liver</p><p>it supports a healthy liver it helps the</p><p>fat on the liver helps it you know come</p><p>off it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a combination of five</p><p>organic cruciferous with six additional</p><p>vegetables including two American garlic</p><p>and seek help and all sorts of really</p><p>good things in spare igus and and all</p><p>these other Christopher&rsquo;s like kale</p><p>broccoli radish cauliflower cabbage and</p><p>those foods have additional health</p><p>properties to support the liver and help</p><p>heal the liver okay so it&rsquo;s a bottle of</p><p>250 tablets it&rsquo;s pretty amazing but</p><p>that&rsquo;s the one that we use for liver</p><p>function for blood sugars it works</p><p>really really good you&rsquo;re going to feel</p><p>energy so I use it for liver support and</p><p>increasing your energy because a lot of</p><p>people have a hard time consuming all</p><p>those different types of vegetables okay</p><p>the other thing I use is we</p><p>raw wheatgrass juice why because</p><p>wheatgrass has um</p><p>amazing nutrition tons of potassium</p><p>it&rsquo;s a highly concentrated nutrient</p><p>dense product that supports potassium</p><p>and nutrition for the cells um potassium</p><p>it and we&rsquo;ll get into this when we get</p><p>into the food potassium decreases the</p><p>need for insulin so it raises it so one</p><p>teaspoon of this is equivalent to a tray</p><p>of wheatgrass 20 inches by 12 inches in</p><p>one teaspoon so you drink that you&rsquo;re</p><p>getting massive amounts of nutrition in</p><p>just a small little glass but I like to</p><p>put in a little shaker bottle shake it</p><p>up and then drink drink in the morning</p><p>and I do it at night too I&rsquo;ve seen</p><p>amazing results with blood sugars with</p><p>using regress wheatgrass if you think</p><p>too about what happens to diabetics to</p><p>their neurological like their eyes and</p><p>their their feet they get these all</p><p>serves they get all sorts of things this</p><p>is what I can apply topically to help</p><p>that as well but we have it doesn&rsquo;t take</p><p>it orally and it goes in there and it</p><p>really helps to bring down the sugars so</p><p>and I&rsquo;ll show you some references on the</p><p>effect of high blood sugars and</p><p>wheatgrass it&rsquo;s really a good</p><p>combination okay so we want to avoid</p><p>fruit grains including oatmeal starches</p><p>potato playing you I mean even plain</p><p>yogurt has like 10 grams of sugar crazy</p><p>alcohol cut it out it&rsquo;s not good for</p><p>your blood Sugar&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m sorry look at an</p><p>apple has 19 grams of sugar it&rsquo;s like</p><p>eating a candy bar now now that I took</p><p>all your sugar lay I just won&rsquo;t let you</p><p>know there are substitute pleasure foods</p><p>that you can make with really good</p><p>recipes and you can eat only with your</p><p>meal not between so you don&rsquo;t feel that</p><p>need for giving up all the pleasure in</p><p>your life ok so there are some great</p><p>recipes that are available too little</p><p>candy bars and ice cream and all sorts</p><p>of things so so you can do this okay so</p><p>we don&rsquo;t do I don&rsquo;t like to say you</p><p>can&rsquo;t have something I just like to</p><p>replace it with something a little bit</p><p>better but here&rsquo;s the thing potassium is</p><p>the most important mineral with diabetes</p><p>and blood sugars because it takes</p><p>potassium to store sugar in the liver</p><p>okay without potassium you can&rsquo;t stir</p><p>the sugar so you constantly blood sugar</p><p>issues if I increase the potassium in</p><p>your diet your cravings will go away</p><p>because it stabilizes your blood sugars</p><p>when you are in fat burning and you&rsquo;re</p><p>not burning any more sugar you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have cravings that&rsquo;s how you know you</p><p>don&rsquo;t have insulin resistance anymore</p><p>your payments go away so potassium you&rsquo;d</p><p>have to have ten bananas or five of</p><p>econo every single day to give you</p><p>potassium because you need forty seven</p><p>hundred milligrams that&rsquo;s a lot because</p><p>one banana is only three hundred so I&rsquo;m</p><p>going to recommend you get it from salad</p><p>instead like seven to ten cups of salad</p><p>day will give you all the potassium you</p><p>need and all the other nutrients as well</p><p>here&rsquo;s an example</p><p>you see those bags of salad you can get</p><p>at the store that&rsquo;s like seven ounces</p><p>seven ounces and seven cups okay for the</p><p>plastic containers usually eight ounces</p><p>it&rsquo;s like eight cups so one ounce equals</p><p>one cup that&rsquo;s the quantity of vegetable</p><p>that you need every single day there&rsquo;s</p><p>my breakfast</p><p>happy that much that&rsquo;s avocado in the</p><p>background you want to have between</p><p>three to six ounces of protein per meal</p><p>okay you don&rsquo;t need a lot just a little</p><p>bit um in a minute fasting a great</p><p>powerful tool for blood Sugar&rsquo;s two to</p><p>three meals a day only no snacking add</p><p>fat if you are hungry so you can go</p><p>longer not a problem I also like to</p><p>consume apple cider vinegar and lemon as</p><p>a drink with with a meal why because</p><p>when you do this you&rsquo;re switching your</p><p>body from sugar fuel to fat burning and</p><p>the process you may be more successful</p><p>to the king stone so if you do lemon of</p><p>each day in episode I vinegar this can</p><p>easily flush out and clean and prevent</p><p>kidney stone development also episode a</p><p>vinegar helps to speed up the fat coming</p><p>off your liver okay so it&rsquo;s really good</p><p>for this program drink it with a straw</p><p>so it doesn&rsquo;t mess up your teeth okay do</p><p>two to three like to one to two</p><p>tablespoons of apple cider vinegar per</p><p>cup and one the two tablespoons of lemon</p><p>we&rsquo;re lon per cup okay real simple drink</p><p>with the straw boom you&rsquo;re good so</p><p>when a meal looks like you have</p><p>vegetable the protein and the fat those</p><p>three things you notice I left off the</p><p>starch right but this is brie cheese</p><p>brie cheese is great to get you to go</p><p>longer without eating okay here&rsquo;s an</p><p>example of a week of meals look at I</p><p>have eggs bacon avocado with the drink I</p><p>have a kale shake as my salad fish brie</p><p>cheese here&rsquo;s a salad burger without the</p><p>bun peanut butter or almond butter</p><p>here&rsquo;s another salad chicken wings</p><p>olives here&rsquo;s a salad with fish with</p><p>avocado and then we just repeat it with</p><p>dinner three meals okay so you&rsquo;re not</p><p>starving because you&rsquo;re eating fat</p><p>you&rsquo;re going long period of time without</p><p>eating at night but you&rsquo;re not snacking</p><p>anymore um this is the fastest way to</p><p>reverse blood sugar issues and it&rsquo;s the</p><p>fastest way to lose weight this eating</p><p>plan that I&rsquo;m showing you for blood</p><p>Sugar&rsquo;s is the same thing with losing</p><p>weight because you&rsquo;re lowering insulin</p><p>and insulin is a key hormone involved</p><p>with that now at my seminars I or a</p><p>webinars we always give people
