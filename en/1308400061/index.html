    <p>Hi friends! This week we&rsquo;re talking about money and a whole bunch of it. I want to</p>
<p>talk about my two cents about how money does make you fucking happy because</p>
<p>everybody in the little entrepreneur space really anybody online anybody with</p>
<p>the fucking mouth be running it and saying that money doesn&rsquo;t make you happy</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna tell you all the ways it doesn&rsquo;t make you happy because in</p>
<p>episode 60 I told you about how I touched a lifestyle where I was spinning</p>
<p>around $100,000 a month and I was a happy dick for a lot of different</p>
<p>reasons but there are certain voids money can&rsquo;t fill that&rsquo;s gonna be for</p>
<p>another episode but for this episode we&rsquo;re gonna talk about how money does</p>
<p>make you happy because it does to an extent so I got a little list of all my</p>
<p>key points I want to hit on really I&rsquo;m gonna just ramble and talk my shit from</p>
<p>my own experience and tell you what I&rsquo;ve learned what I&rsquo;ve figured out in the</p>
<p>awareness that&rsquo;s hit me like a ton of fucking bricks so the first thing I want</p>
<p>to talk about is people&rsquo;s whole like money doesn&rsquo;t make you happy it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that having more money directly leads to you being more happy there&rsquo;s two reasons</p>
<p>money kind of makes you more happy first is the absence of stress there are</p>
<p>certain stress that just goes the fuck away and it&rsquo;s so nice it&rsquo;s so fucking</p>
<p>nice because you get your focus back like when you have money you&rsquo;re allowed</p>
<p>to focus on the things that you want to focus on you&rsquo;re allowed to do the things</p>
<p>that you want to do whatever tickles your fucking peach you get to do it you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to be worried about oh the dread and the fear and the worry and the</p>
<p>concern about not having enough money oh it&rsquo;s a shit show absolute like I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>up and down in both lifestyles I&rsquo;ve been struggling and I&rsquo;ve been balling out but</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have that constant everything feeling like a setback and like dread</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the word that keeps coming to mind is dread it&rsquo;s like everything is</p>
<p>fucking dreadful when you don&rsquo;t have money it&rsquo;s just annoying like waking up</p>
<p>cost you a hundred fucking bucks I swear to God like to leave the house 150</p>
<p>stay your ass at home that&rsquo;s how it feels a lot of days when you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>money it just feels like everywhere you turn there&rsquo;s a new bill there&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>expense there&rsquo;s a new something and it just will piss you off when you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have excess money to just throw at shit like little inconveniences what like you</p>
<p>have this fear about just stupid little shit when you don&rsquo;t have money that kind</p>
<p>of goes away like if a rock comes up and cracks your fucking windshield or like</p>
<p>someone breaks in your car like they fucking did to me on New Year&rsquo;s Eve I</p>
<p>had to pay to go get it fixed annoying as fuck but the other part of having</p>
<p>money that does lead to happiness so we talked about the absence of stress so</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s less stress you just feel better you feel happier you get to focus</p>
<p>on what you want to focus on whatever tickers you peach remember but then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also the whole aspect of money being a tool money gives you power</p>
<p>because it allows you to bring about what you want to experience so the more</p>
<p>ability you have to get what you want great what the fuck like it&rsquo;s gonna be a</p>
<p>lot easier so to have more money gives you more tools in your tool belt</p>
<p>basically so nothing really feels unattainable or that you can&rsquo;t have it</p>
<p>or experience it in some way like you can get shit and manifest it please I</p>
<p>still have to do my episode about manifestation but it arcs the fuck out</p>
<p>of me but y&rsquo;all know what I mean about the money thing but I&rsquo;m gonna give you a</p>
<p>couple of examples I want to talk about about when I didn&rsquo;t have money and how I</p>
<p>was like living on a budget and I was like trying to be like a frugal fuck and</p>
<p>then how I do have some money now where I can have a little bit of disposable</p>
<p>income and buy what the fuck I want like I bought a fucking Versace bath mat for</p>
<p>my kitchen cuz it was cute but my first example when I was budgeting and when I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really have much money to just do what I want with like I lived on a very</p>
<p>tight budget like I couldn&rsquo;t fucking fart and spend money like I couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>nothing so everything was very tight so unexpected expenses came with so much</p>
<p>emotional charge like I was aggravated and just pissed off every day I fucking</p>
<p>woke up when something happened so like face wash oh my god I remember this</p>
<p>clear as day I literally was on such a tight budget but my fucking frugal ass</p>
<p>still bought a $40 face scrub because it was just good best I could find so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ll cut a corner somewhere else I didn&rsquo;t go out to eat I didn&rsquo;t do shit</p>
<p>like a couple years ago and I was like I&rsquo;m buying my face wash though sorry</p>
<p>skins number one but I remember waking up one day and I went to use my face</p>
<p>wash and I was like about to be out like I had like one more use out of it and I</p>
<p>was like so mad I got so mad because I had been saving a little extra money</p>
<p>that week and then I was like oh my god I&rsquo;m on top of shit like yay I have like</p>
<p>a little like I&rsquo;m okay right now and then the unexpected expense hit and it</p>
<p>ruined my fucking day I was so pissed off I had to go buy the new face wash I</p>
<p>know I didn&rsquo;t have to go buy it but like I was just so agitated like mother fuck</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you feel like you can never get ahead when you don&rsquo;t have money for</p>
<p>shit I&rsquo;ve been there I know it all too well and that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m confident to</p>
<p>say money makes you motherfucking happy because when you don&rsquo;t have the money to</p>
<p>buy even basic little shit some people can&rsquo;t fucking afford food dude so when</p>
<p>that time comes where you need to eat and you can&rsquo;t afford food you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>get pissed off every time you have to eat or you&rsquo;re gonna get extremely sad</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many situations that come emotionally charged because of the</p>
<p>powerlessness and just the aggravation and feeling like it&rsquo;s a setback like you</p>
<p>have this goal and you&rsquo;re saving this money and then all of a sudden you have</p>
<p>this unexpected bill come up and you lose all the money you were saving the</p>
<p>fuck that&rsquo;s the most like disheartening thing but when you have money living</p>
<p>day-to-day is no longer an aggravation like when I run out of face wash now I</p>
<p>go buy a new face wash and it&rsquo;s not like oh my god I used the last bit in the</p>
<p>shower I&rsquo;m like okay I&rsquo;ll go buy more I don&rsquo;t have the emotional charge anymore</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get frustrated I don&rsquo;t get annoyed I&rsquo;m always a little bit like</p>
<p>god damn it but it&rsquo;s not as emotionally charged does that make sense and that is</p>
<p>alleviated throughout your entire life and another example of something where I</p>
<p>had to like rebuy it I don&rsquo;t lose anything ever especially if it&rsquo;s nice so</p>
<p>I have these Versace sunglasses and they were like three four hundred bucks</p>
<p>something like that I don&rsquo;t know I bought them a couple of years ago and I</p>
<p>fucking loved them I love them so much and I&rsquo;ve taken care of them like</p>
<p>whenever I buy designer things I take care of them because I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>lose them unless it&rsquo;s something that like you&rsquo;re meant to trash up because I</p>
<p>have this weird fetish for like having things that other people want and just</p>
<p>like treating it like shit like to have a Birkin or like some kind of like</p>
<p>expensive ass bag or like a pair of shoes that everybody wants and you just</p>
<p>trash them oh my god that&rsquo;s the ultimate fuck you it&rsquo;s not cool to have something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so hard to get in perfect condition like people that are scared to</p>
<p>crease their shoes like when you buy an expensive pair of shoes and are scared</p>
<p>to crease them or they have like a Birkin and they never take the plastic</p>
<p>off girl throw that motherfucker around that&rsquo;s the flex okay having a brand new</p>
<p>like perfect little bag and perfect pair of shoes like I don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>own little fetish I like to trash things but I had this pair of sunglasses that I</p>
<p>loved and I wore them every day and I lost them and the thing about those</p>
<p>sunglasses was I liked them enough to rebuy them and that&rsquo;s how I knew I</p>
<p>really liked them because I was like okay I lost them fuck but I do like them</p>
<p>enough to rebuy them so I&rsquo;ll just rebuy them now to go rebuy those sunglasses I</p>
<p>was like and whatever I&rsquo;ll just buy them three four hundred bucks however the</p>
<p>fuck much they were three or four hundred bucks me a year ago would have</p>
<p>crippled me to just have to like have that unexpected expense and like to just</p>
<p>rebuy something like that to go rebuy these sunglasses wasn&rsquo;t a big deal for</p>
<p>me and I was literally sitting in the car when I was like I was fucking sitting</p>
<p>there having a cigarette and I was like oh whatever and I just went and like</p>
<p>reordered a new pair and I was like whoa that was my moment where I was like Leo</p>
<p>you kind of made it like you&rsquo;re okay like you have disposable enough income</p>
<p>where you can just like go buy something for a few hundred bucks and</p>
<p>not blink well that was so weird to me but having a little bit of extra money</p>
<p>and like having disposable income now and losing something or breaking</p>
<p>something or having to pay for something it&rsquo;s not a big deal anymore like things</p>
<p>are not a big fucking deal okay it sucks sure here&rsquo;s the money like I&rsquo;ll just buy</p>
<p>it whatever get it over with I don&rsquo;t dwell on it I don&rsquo;t sit there and get</p>
<p>emotionally charged by it because I have the money to pay for shit and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna hurt another area of my life because I have that money now me a year</p>
<p>ago had I lost some glasses oh I would have beat myself the fuck up I&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>been so upset I&rsquo;d have been so pissed off because I could have rebought them</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been very good with managing money but I would have had to take out</p>
<p>of my savings or like take out of something else to rebuy them and I would</p>
<p>have been so pissed off it would have ruined my whole fucking day because I</p>
<p>lost those glasses and I have like oh my god I have to rebuy them and then to not</p>
<p>rebuy them I would just sit there and be pissed off you know what I mean so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like damn if you do damn if you don&rsquo;t but that&rsquo;s the difference between these</p>
<p>situations like not having money to like when you lose something it would have</p>
<p>ruined my whole day I would have been pissed off probably a goddamn week</p>
<p>probably a month about it I&rsquo;d have been so goddamn mad and the people who are in</p>
<p>the boat I used to be in I fully get you and you guys get what I&rsquo;m saying where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like little shit just bothers the hell out of you and money does solve</p>
<p>it money solves a lot of fucking problems and it makes your life like I</p>
<p>said it just removes certain stress and you get to just go about your life and</p>
<p>it seems easier it seems better it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not constantly hit every</p>
<p>time you like turn around with some new annoyance or new inconvenience or new</p>
<p>fee or charge or whatever the fuck so yes if you&rsquo;re chasing money chase that</p>
<p>shit okay people trying to talk people out of making money and starting</p>
<p>businesses do it bitch fucking do it stop making yourself go through this</p>
<p>daily turmoil of not being able to afford things literally if you want</p>
<p>money go for it go for it make it give yourself this sense of freedom and give</p>
<p>yourself back the privilege of focusing on what you want to fucking focus on not</p>
<p>having all these things pop up and take your focus away from them because when I</p>
<p>get to work on my businesses now I get to do it without distraction of little</p>
<p>things out of my control I don&rsquo;t feel so powerless because if my car gets broken</p>
<p>into if I lose something if I get a charge to fee for some shit or whatever</p>
<p>I just get to pay it it&rsquo;s like this little annoyance comes up I pay it get</p>
<p>rid of it and I&rsquo;m back to work and I get to focus back at what I&rsquo;m doing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not constantly like swayed and so overwhelmed but a shit that happens I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>rambling a whole lot but money does make you happy in that aspect fight me on it</p>
<p>so like I said nothing seems like a big deal and this kind of ties me into my</p>
<p>next point shit just don&rsquo;t seem like such a big deal anymore like my first</p>
<p>example is you just get to focus on enjoying things like when you go to</p>
<p>dinner with some friends or you go to dinner you go out to eat you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to fucking like stock the menu and eat as cheap as possible and sit there and</p>
<p>like be worried about oh are they gonna split the bill am I gonna have to cover</p>
<p>it for the table like there&rsquo;s no like all that fear all that stress is gone</p>
<p>you just get to go eat and have fucking fine meat if you want a drink get a</p>
<p>drink if you want five get five you can fucking afford it you know it just takes</p>
<p>the frustration and the headache out of everything and you get to just enjoy</p>
<p>experiences so like going to dinner something as simple as that going to</p>
<p>get fucking gas when your car is out of gas you&rsquo;re not like fuck when it&rsquo;s on e</p>
<p>or like a quarter of tank I always fill up on a quarter of tank cuz I&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>paranoid I&rsquo;d be scared to break down I don&rsquo;t like to ask for help but when my</p>
<p>car was out of gas now I&rsquo;m like okay I go to the gas station and I go to the</p>
<p>gas station it&rsquo;s not like oh like I have to go pay for this shit you know what I</p>
<p>mean but like especially with dinner like I used to have such a bad</p>
<p>relationship with going out to eat because I would sit there and just be</p>
<p>like annoyed and if I didn&rsquo;t have a good time at dinner I would secretly in my</p>
<p>mind be pissed that I just wasted this fucking money going to eat with this</p>
<p>person and it was fucking worthless like oh I used to get so frustrated about</p>
<p>that shit but now I don&rsquo;t care I have the money to go have dinner and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>nice the next thing is traveling one you get to travel and two like I said you</p>
<p>get to just enjoy the experience of traveling you can pay to upgrade your</p>
<p>seats on a flight you could pay to get a nice Airbnb you could pay for</p>
<p>convenience where you stay you can pay for ubers and being comfortable you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to get into a carpool or like some weird shit you can literally just</p>
<p>gain comfort and buy comfort for yourself when you have money to travel</p>
<p>like basically when you have money at all this is just shit you can use it for</p>
<p>and how it makes everything better so like when you go traveling on a budget</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t actually have a lot of money to spend you&rsquo;re gonna be trying to</p>
<p>find the cheapest uber trying to find the cheapest Airbnb trying to find the</p>
<p>cheapest flight sitting next to the fucking bathroom smelling everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shit like it&rsquo;s just gonna be a bad experience and it&rsquo;s like oh it&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>better like money makes all that shit so much fucking better and like I said you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to worry at a restaurant when you go out to eat you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about when you go out you don&rsquo;t have to worry about where you stay</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a safe spot you&rsquo;re literally just it just heightens every experience</p>
<p>and the biggest thing with all these points I just made with like dinner and</p>
<p>travel and all that you don&rsquo;t have to take so much into consideration with</p>
<p>like trying to find the cheap shit it&rsquo;s like all your focus is is getting to</p>
<p>have fun and enjoy where you are it&rsquo;s not distracting you your focus is not</p>
<p>being yanked from you and put on you got to find the cheapest shit you got to</p>
<p>find coupons you got to find anything you can to make shit cheaper and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that stress when you&rsquo;re doing things like oh my god how much is it</p>
<p>gonna be can I afford it a lot like you just get to go and just have fucking fun</p>
<p>dude it&rsquo;s a nice freedom and I&rsquo;m not at the point yet me and my ex would go</p>
<p>fucking on a vacation and spend 30 grand and just do literally whatever we</p>
<p>fucking wanted that&rsquo;s the experience I&rsquo;m speaking from when I go out now and like</p>
<p>I travel now I&rsquo;d be upgrading my seat in my flight sure cuz I&rsquo;m six foot seven I</p>
<p>gotta get the big one but I still like watch my dollar I&rsquo;m not crazy with</p>
<p>Airbnbs I still am very conscious and aware like how much I&rsquo;m spending cuz I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that much disposable income to just be throwing out tens of</p>
<p>thousands of fucking dollars but it is so nice and there is such just like a</p>
<p>freedom in it and you truly get to enjoy the fuck out of life because your</p>
<p>attention like I said you get your attention back you don&rsquo;t have it on</p>
<p>other shit it&rsquo;s just having a good time now I want to talk about everything</p>
<p>seeming possible so like when you don&rsquo;t have money everything is like a</p>
<p>challenge or a chore or like it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it can happen for you when you</p>
<p>have money you got a fucking shortcut to anything you want I got a pretty good</p>
<p>list on this one so dating you could date anybody you fucking want distance</p>
<p>is no longer an issue fly to them go see them what the fuck like move them to you</p>
<p>move to them like when you got money your dating pool fucking gets real fat</p>
<p>you can pay to go places you can pay to take people to dinner you can pay to go</p>
<p>have experiences it&rsquo;s literally like what if you want to go fucking hook up</p>
<p>you ain&rsquo;t got to bring no one to your house go buy a hotel room for the night and go</p>
<p>fuck some stranger if y&rsquo;all are into that money just gives you so many</p>
<p>options and your limit on dating just seems to go away like you have so much</p>
<p>potential and so much opportunity like when you see someone&rsquo;s a thousand miles</p>
<p>away up let one of us get on a flight and it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s no hesitation it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like when you when you have a desire for something you could just be lying for it</p>
<p>instead of having to like not have it or be like sad about it because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see a way to get it money just kind of like solves that it&rsquo;s more tools to get</p>
<p>you to what you want so why the fuck would you not want more of them also</p>
<p>with dating is making friends because you can pay to go certain places you can</p>
<p>go out you can do whatever you want to do you can go to dinners freely like</p>
<p>whenever I was trying to save a lot of money a lot of people like to hang out</p>
<p>and eat like that costs money the only activity me and my friends in Pensacola</p>
<p>would do would be like go eat and I was like I&rsquo;m tired of spending money so I</p>
<p>got isolated because I was like if I&rsquo;m not eating I&rsquo;m not seeing anyone if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going out downtown and drinking and doing drugs I&rsquo;m not seeing anyone and</p>
<p>now all that shit&rsquo;s expensive so I literally was just like isolated but</p>
<p>when you have money to go to dinner when you have money to go drink when you have</p>
<p>money to do you can do them and not think twice about it so like I said you</p>
<p>can pay to go places you can join a fucking yoga class if that&rsquo;s what tickles</p>
<p>your peach you can go fucking join a little MMA fighting class or kickboxing</p>
<p>class you can literally do whatever you want to do you can go pay to get around</p>
<p>these people a lot of people have country club memberships because they</p>
<p>like to be around a bunch of fucking prudes with their little polo shirts and</p>
<p>shit I would get kicked the fuck out of one of those in two seconds please I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like their pretentious bullshit I still I don&rsquo;t care how much money I make</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always have a bottle of tequila in my car to take shots for I go in the bar</p>
<p>why did that rhyme I&rsquo;m gonna just leave it there but yeah you can literally do</p>
<p>whatever the fuck you want you can it&rsquo;s so easy to meet friends when you have</p>
<p>money to buy experiences and do all this shit like it just kind of like</p>
<p>takes the cap off and you don&rsquo;t feel so lonely because like when you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>money it&rsquo;s like you have to start getting creative also taking care of</p>
<p>yourself is ten times fucking easier when you have money to do it you could</p>
<p>pay for massages you can get facials you can afford to go get routine blood work</p>
<p>done and go see doctors consistently when something&rsquo;s wrong when you&rsquo;re sick</p>
<p>you can pay for fucking treatments specially with like being hungover if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hungover go get a fucking IV they&rsquo;re like 200 bucks go get a fucking</p>
<p>IV and it&rsquo;ll hydrate you the next day like a lot of rich people do that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll literally just go to a fucking place or have the IV place in their team</p>
<p>out and they&rsquo;ll come to your house and give you an IV and it like rehydrates</p>
<p>you and get you back to life and you don&rsquo;t feel hungover like what there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many cheat codes to everything also with hangovers you can afford to buy</p>
<p>expensive alcohol so it doesn&rsquo;t hurt so bad when you wake up the next day win</p>
<p>win but back to taking care of yourself like I started getting massages last</p>
<p>week and it&rsquo;s so weird that I&rsquo;m able to go and afford to just do that like I</p>
<p>started ordering my groceries because going to the grocery store takes me like</p>
<p>an hour and a half because I have to go to two different grocery stores so I</p>
<p>just started instacarting them because now I have money to pay the little fee</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t give a fuck about it like to pay 20 bucks extra to have someone go</p>
<p>get my shit and bring it to me gladly it&rsquo;s usually more than that because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna tip them on top of it but so like buy that convenience back and just like</p>
<p>have it done for me it&rsquo;s so nice it&rsquo;s what the fuck like it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>convenient but literally with taking care of yourself like I can afford to go</p>
<p>get a massage now I can afford to go see a chiropractor I can go afford to do</p>
<p>whatever the hell I want to do I can afford to do things that make it a lot</p>
<p>easier to take care of my health and make it kind of fun so money opens that</p>
<p>door to also eating right like you&rsquo;re able to buy healthier shit better</p>
<p>quality shit you can buy a personal chef if you want you can buy those meal prep</p>
<p>companies that send you everything already pre-made save you all the time</p>
<p>cooking and cleaning you can afford to go out every meal if you goddamn want to</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just fresh good food if you go to nice restaurants I&rsquo;m gonna goddamn</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s but if you can afford to go to a nice restaurant two three times a</p>
<p>day you got more money than me bitch cuz the way I eat please like a good 50 60</p>
<p>bucks to go out to eat no but eating right is a whole lot easier so taking</p>
<p>care of yourself in that aspect too and my whole point behind this video is just</p>
<p>like to give people inspiration that if you&rsquo;re trying to make money or you have</p>
<p>a goal to make more money you&rsquo;re not wrong for it you&rsquo;re not an asshole</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not selfish I don&rsquo;t want you to be listening to these people who are</p>
<p>like trying to discourage you and be like money doesn&rsquo;t make you happy you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t chase that chase that for a while chase it till you get it okay</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t unwant something that you want so like in the position that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in right now I came from a place where I wanted money so fucking bad got</p>
<p>with that motherfucker that had a lot back to my lifestyle with not having</p>
<p>much and then I still had the desire to make more money like it even was like</p>
<p>heightened because I wanted my own fucking money this time I wanted my own</p>
<p>shit and I could have just sat here and be like oh Leo you were so upset and you</p>
<p>were more unhappy than you&rsquo;ve ever been when you were over here spending $100,000</p>
<p>a month I wasn&rsquo;t happy for a lot of reasons but money made a lot of shit</p>
<p>better and you can&rsquo;t deny that so wanting money nothing&rsquo;s wrong with it</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s fucking wrong with it and I want to give you that reassurance so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a place where you want money motherfucker shoot for it get it because</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m in the place I am right now I now have disposable income where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>comfortable and I can do what the fuck I want and now that I&rsquo;m here I get to</p>
<p>decide what do I want to do next like it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with pursuing</p>
<p>money there&rsquo;s nothing fucking wrong with it watch your ass don&rsquo;t fuck people over</p>
<p>for it stick to your morals stick to your values stick to your standards</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be inconsiderate don&rsquo;t be disrespectful like do it the right way</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with going for money and wanting to and wanting</p>
<p>money like I&rsquo;m telling you it&rsquo;s a lot better than these people even fucking</p>
<p>explain they&rsquo;re so asleep they&rsquo;re not in touch enough to even be able to explain</p>
<p>the things that I&rsquo;m telling you how much of a relief money fucking is they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just not with it enough to tell you that&rsquo;s why I want to make this episode</p>
<p>because I used to when I didn&rsquo;t have money try and convince myself oh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that great anyway all these rich people are so fucking miserable they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>miserable for their own other reasons but there&rsquo;s so many fucking problems you</p>
<p>have that can be solved like that once you have more money promise you watch</p>
<p>just make it and see so something else that seems more possible because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of a note I was on was starting businesses your fear of failure kind of</p>
<p>goes the fuck away when you have money and disposable income like what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst that&rsquo;s gonna happen the company is gonna fail oh okay I&rsquo;ll start a different</p>
<p>one when you&rsquo;re not scared of a financial loss and trying to start a</p>
<p>business is not gonna lead to financial ruin where you&rsquo;re like oh my god how am</p>
<p>I gonna pay the bills am I gonna lose my house am I gonna lose my car am I gonna</p>
<p>be able to feed my kids when you don&rsquo;t have that stress on you you&rsquo;re free to</p>
<p>pursue what it is you want and not be so fucking fearful like my ex was literally</p>
<p>not scared of starting shit and we had such a disconnect because I would talk</p>
<p>to him about wanting to start certain businesses and he&rsquo;s like what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst that&rsquo;s gonna happen you fail and I literally was like yeah and lose all</p>
<p>this money and he goes so what and I&rsquo;m just like I never looked at his money as</p>
<p>my money and that was one of our big fucking fights was like motherfucker I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not stupid I came into this relationship with what I came in with it and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>leaving with that like what I&rsquo;m not fucking thinking that your shit is my</p>
<p>shit but he was in a position where he had money to just throw at shit he was</p>
<p>able to lose it because like starting a business is gambling so he was able to</p>
<p>just like try that and have no fear of failure where I was sitting here looking</p>
<p>at this opportunity was starting a certain business and I was fucking</p>
<p>fearful because it would lead to so much ruin if it didn&rsquo;t work out for me to</p>
<p>invest so much into it like it just seems like such an unfair</p>
<p>disadvantage because you don&rsquo;t have to take so much into consideration not so</p>
<p>much as riding on the business succeeding when you have money versus if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like for me to try and start something back then oh I was too fucking</p>
<p>scared there was too much potential risk with it I guess I went to fucking</p>
<p>nursing school I wanted something secure and stable but people with money</p>
<p>genuinely are not scared to start things or invest in things or buy things they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like oh what&rsquo;s the worst gonna happen oh you lose the money whoopee like girl oh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to get to that level cuz I still be scared I still be scared</p>
<p>about shit so I want to talk about a couple of things that having money makes</p>
<p>more convenient that you probably don&rsquo;t think about moving literally when I</p>
<p>moved to Houston from Florida I did it by myself no one helped me lift the</p>
<p>fucking box no one helped me move shit I did it all myself and I fucking hated</p>
<p>it when I moved from my old apartment here so my new one this one I hired</p>
<p>motherfucking movers okay I have the money now to be able to do shit like</p>
<p>that fucking do it if you have the money to hire a mover hire a mover it</p>
<p>will save you so much time and headache and frustration and muscle soreness and</p>
<p>dropping shit on your feet trust me but make sure you get one with insurance in</p>
<p>case they fuck your shit up but yeah like it just made it so much more</p>
<p>convenient and it was such less of a headache to move all I had to do was</p>
<p>literally come to my new place and unpack all of my shit it was all moved</p>
<p>for me that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying nothing seems as big like moving when you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have money it&rsquo;s like oh fuck like everything just seems like such a big</p>
<p>chore or task because you can&rsquo;t pay to make things more convenient or pay for</p>
<p>help that is something I fully get bitch I fully get it and like when you are</p>
<p>living a life where you have money and you don&rsquo;t feel like everything is such a</p>
<p>big deal and such a chore you&rsquo;re a lot happier to get up in the morning you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a lot happier to try things and do things because you&rsquo;re not fucking</p>
<p>discouraged every time you turn around with how much effort everything&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>take you can pay to make it a little easier and another thing with convenience</p>
<p>is overnight shipping that&rsquo;s something I still have a hard time paying for like</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s like 30 bucks I&rsquo;m like oh depends how bad I want what it is I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ordering but a lot of the times I&rsquo;ll just pay for overnight shipping because</p>
<p>I can like 20 30 bucks it&rsquo;s not gonna fucking kill me and it&rsquo;s so nice like I</p>
<p>used to always be looking for the cheapest option and always be looking</p>
<p>for a coupon code girl I still be looking for coupon codes the fuck I will</p>
<p>never put in an order just put it in I&rsquo;m always discount code coupon code</p>
<p>Google bitch I&rsquo;m always looking for a goddamn coupon forever till the day I</p>
<p>die I don&rsquo;t care how rich I get but I will pay for the fast shipping now</p>
<p>because I want it quick only pays the next thing that makes very convenient is</p>
<p>getting famous online getting famous online or growing on social media is not</p>
<p>hard when you have money so let me break down some shit people are doing okay so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say someone that has a lot of money all of a sudden decides they want</p>
<p>to start getting on social media and they want to blow up easy fucking peasy</p>
<p>they can hire a photographer to get cool pictures of them made they can hire an</p>
<p>interior decorator to give them a nice setting and a nice setup or they can go</p>
<p>rent a fucking studio and get some professional ass pictures taken get some</p>
<p>cutesy little funsy shit they can get a content scheduler someone that&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>social media manager that can tell them what to post how to post the hashtags to</p>
<p>use times to post all that to optimize their growth you can pay for platforms</p>
<p>that automatically generate likes and put you on people&rsquo;s for you page and</p>
<p>shit and like explore page on Instagram and TikTok then you want to take it a</p>
<p>step further once you&rsquo;ve got like a little bit of a following or it looks</p>
<p>like you do then you can start going to other people&rsquo;s podcasts or meeting up</p>
<p>with other people that are influencers in your place or like where you live</p>
<p>start going to the places that they go run into them you might have a little</p>
<p>bit of a following now or it&rsquo;s gonna look like it because you bought some</p>
<p>fucking followers and then you&rsquo;re buying the likes to make them look real it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole fucking shit show in this and then you can pay blogs and newspapers</p>
<p>for articles to be written about you and once you have a few like articles and</p>
<p>blog posts and like if a news station writes about you you can apply for being</p>
<p>verified on Instagram and you will get verified if you have articles written</p>
<p>about you that&rsquo;s just how it fucking goes you&rsquo;ll see people with two or</p>
<p>three thousand followers and they&rsquo;re blue check verified because they have</p>
<p>articles written about them whether they&rsquo;re a little athlete from some</p>
<p>podunk ass school if they got articles written about them from a credible</p>
<p>place they&rsquo;re gonna get verified that&rsquo;s how the shit works also you can pay to</p>
<p>become verified on Twitter you can just buy it but for Instagram and tik-tok if</p>
<p>you can weasel your way in with a social media manager and like get in the right</p>
<p>doors and pay the right people you could pay a few grand and get fucking verified</p>
<p>for real there&rsquo;s plenty of people that do it so if you ever look at someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>page and you&rsquo;re like who the fuck are you why are you verified they might have</p>
<p>bought it but once you get that blue check when you start trying to go hang</p>
<p>out with other influencers they&rsquo;re gonna take you more serious when you start</p>
<p>posting shit and it like blows up a little bit because of your little</p>
<p>fucking algorithm shit that you bought people are gonna start following you</p>
<p>because they think you&rsquo;re important because you have the blue check like it</p>
<p>just buys you credibility you can go from a nobody to a somebody in 30</p>
<p>fucking days and there&rsquo;s this couple that I follow that I&rsquo;m fucking obsessed</p>
<p>with and I love them and I&rsquo;m not talking shit I&rsquo;m just saying like how they did</p>
<p>it and what expedited their growth Alex and Layla Hermosi they both have grown</p>
<p>so much on social media so fast in the last like year and a half two years</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve blown the fuck up like hundreds of thousands of followers on every</p>
<p>fucking platform and they have an entire team of people that helps them film and</p>
<p>record their content okay so they&rsquo;ll record like a YouTube video and then</p>
<p>their team will edit it turn it into YouTube shorts turn it into tik-tok</p>
<p>videos turn it into Instagram reels turn shit into written copy like written</p>
<p>stories written posts tweets they&rsquo;ll literally take their one video and</p>
<p>repurpose it into like 30 different forms of content so their actual input</p>
<p>of time and energy to make a video is however long it takes to sit down and</p>
<p>record the fucking video everything else is handled for them and they&rsquo;re blowing</p>
<p>the fuck up because social media is a numbers game how many videos can you get</p>
<p>out how many eyes can you get in front of they have their team posting for them</p>
<p>like three to five times a day every fucking day and when you have money you</p>
<p>can pay for that they said that they paid their team around seventy thousand</p>
<p>seventy thousand dollars a month seven zero zero zero seventy thousand dollars</p>
<p>a month but they&rsquo;re growing like wild fucking fire and they should like they</p>
<p>honestly like deserve to grow because they share good ass shit like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>genuine ass people and they share such good information they&rsquo;ve helped me a</p>
<p>ton like some of the best business advice I&rsquo;ve ever fucking heard and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>obsessed with Leila oh my god I just love her but it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>cheating or doing anything wrong they&rsquo;re doing it the correct way because</p>
<p>all you have to do is just post a fuckton if I&rsquo;m over here posting five</p>
<p>videos a month and they&rsquo;re posting a hundred videos a month who the fuck do</p>
<p>you think is gonna grow faster them it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re doing the numbers game</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just paying for someone to help them reach the higher numbers and put</p>
<p>out as much content as possible so it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re buying fake followers</p>
<p>and shit they&rsquo;re doing it the legit way them having a lot of money allows them</p>
<p>to be more efficient and effective and pay for the convenience of having it</p>
<p>done for them like they make the content like they&rsquo;re recorded they&rsquo;re the ones</p>
<p>that say things they have the content to share the values to contribute they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the ones making the content they&rsquo;re responsible for it but dispersing it</p>
<p>they get to hand off which is very fucking time-consuming like me trying to</p>
<p>make my little clips and shit I&rsquo;m a one-man team with this shit and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard it&rsquo;s a like four full-time jobs bitch like it&rsquo;s literally 148 in the</p>
<p>morning right now on Saturday night and I&rsquo;m recording this podcast my life ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking sweet and peaches the cream bitch like it&rsquo;s rough it&rsquo;s difficult but</p>
<p>if I had a fuck ton of money to just throw 70k editors I would be millions of</p>
<p>followers right now it&rsquo;s just a numbers game and it&rsquo;s anybody because there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many fucking Joe Schmoe loser ass people online that have millions of followers</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done the numbers game they&rsquo;ve done the time that makes sense that was</p>
<p>a long little like tangent but money makes it convenient</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another thing that money can help you feel like is attainable is fame but</p>
<p>one of the biggest things I noticed about having more money is you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>much less mentally tired because you&rsquo;re not spending all of your time constantly</p>
<p>thinking of ways to be resourceful instead of just buying something or</p>
<p>paying for something like if you&rsquo;re always constantly trying to think of</p>
<p>little covert and like different ways to get things that you need when it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>much easier to just buy them but you can&rsquo;t cuz you don&rsquo;t have the money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of fucking energy you&rsquo;re spending on trying to like meet needs</p>
<p>for yourself in other ways so when you have money you&rsquo;re a lot less fucking</p>
<p>tired because you don&rsquo;t have to think outside the box and constantly like</p>
<p>divert your energy all these different places non-stop if you want something</p>
<p>buy it it&rsquo;s as simple as that instead of trying to go oh my god I can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>fucking get into it it&rsquo;s just stressful and you&rsquo;re a lot less mentally tired</p>
<p>when you have money trust so my next little topic I want to talk about with</p>
<p>money is when you have money you have a better sense of safety or more of a</p>
<p>sense of safety like you feel more safe when you have money because like I</p>
<p>talked about in my last episode you can represent yourself in fucking court okay</p>
<p>you can defend yourself you can protect yourself legally you can go about things</p>
<p>the right way and especially with taxes like you can just pay for someone to do</p>
<p>your taxes and you don&rsquo;t have to take on the stress and the burden of like</p>
<p>dealing with doing it wrong and then having to go to court and like get</p>
<p>fucked but also if someone does you wrong you can go have it rectified in</p>
<p>court like you can make them and force them through like a ruling in court to</p>
<p>do what the fuck like they were supposed to do for you if something is like gone</p>
<p>wrong you know or if someone damages you or causes damage to you you can afford</p>
<p>to get justice bitch well try to cuz like I said justice system ain&rsquo;t for</p>
<p>justice it&rsquo;s so much a horse shit but you have a higher chance and if someone</p>
<p>is attacking you and trying to take you to court and sue you if you&rsquo;re gonna pay</p>
<p>an attorney you&rsquo;re a lot less like you&rsquo;re a lot more peace of mind you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like oh you just get to throw that pressure into the attorney&rsquo;s hands and</p>
<p>they get to handle it and represent it you&rsquo;re still gonna be a little stressed</p>
<p>but you get to have guidance and feel supported and feel a little more safe</p>
<p>because you have the money to pay for that also with a sense of safety you get</p>
<p>a sense of safety with your body because if you get sick or you have an</p>
<p>illness or you have something go wrong you break a bone whatever when you have</p>
<p>money you got access to shit other people can&rsquo;t fucking access there are</p>
<p>cures to cancer and I don&rsquo;t want to die just in case I go missing after this</p>
<p>shit I worked in the fucking medical field people with money got the cures to</p>
<p>everything Alzheimer&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t Leo do you want to talk about this there&rsquo;s cures to</p>
<p>everything you can fucking think of you&rsquo;re just broke and can&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>access to it I&rsquo;ve heard about some crazy-ass shit from people that have a</p>
<p>lot of fucking money just go look at Tony Robbins and when he had his brain</p>
<p>tumor and how he got rid of it go look it up when you have money you can access</p>
<p>technology and science and doctors and resources that the public can&rsquo;t access</p>
<p>you get a sense of safety with your body because everything can be reversed I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>scared I don&rsquo;t want to talk about this the government&rsquo;s gonna kill me but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just so fucked up like feeling scared for your own health or someone you care</p>
<p>about health that&rsquo;s awful because I had a patient one time who was diagnosed</p>
<p>with cancer and her health insurance would not cover the treatment like the</p>
<p>medication it was $30,000 a month for her to take this medication or else her</p>
<p>cancer was gonna get worse and she was gonna die so every month that was 30k</p>
<p>for something just to stay alive what the fuck is that oh my god like I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen too much at such a young age I&rsquo;ve seen way too much at such a young age</p>
<p>the justice system is not there to help you the medical system is there to fuck</p>
<p>you out of money literally one Tylenol in the hospital is $80 don&rsquo;t ever take</p>
<p>Tylenol at a fucking hospital I&rsquo;m gonna just warn y&rsquo;all now have someone bring</p>
<p>it to you fucking uber eats that shit instacart it okay don&rsquo;t ever take</p>
<p>Tylenol or don&rsquo;t ever take no little like shit you could buy at a grocery</p>
<p>store or like a convenience store from a hospital if you need Benadryl get your</p>
<p>own fucking Benadryl because they&rsquo;re gonna upcharge the shit out of you</p>
<p>Tylenol it&rsquo;s 80 $80 per one pill they charge your insurance company y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>want to know why the fucking medical bills are so goddamn high this is a</p>
<p>tangent another one but if you ever get a really high medical bill call them</p>
<p>back and ask for an itemized receipt and watch that fucking total drop bitch just</p>
<p>watch just watch trust me I&rsquo;ll help y&rsquo;all I just can&rsquo;t say too much cuz the</p>
<p>government gonna kill me but let&rsquo;s get past all that the next thing I want to</p>
<p>talk about is confidence because when you got money bitch you have no excuse</p>
<p>to be ugly there&rsquo;s been this quote that&rsquo;s been going around that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not ugly you&rsquo;re just broke that&rsquo;s the goddamn fucking truth because you</p>
<p>see so many people who are butt-ass ugly and then they get money or they get</p>
<p>famous and all of a sudden they attend they all of a sudden hi they all of a</p>
<p>sudden shape like they wasn&rsquo;t shaped like before but money allows you to fix</p>
<p>anything you want about your face about your body about your skin you can afford</p>
<p>all kind of fucking shit so if you want to talk about cosmetic things like</p>
<p>filler Botox you can get all kind of shit like that there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>treatments that you can get like Kyabella for like oh my god just look it</p>
<p>up just so I can google it y&rsquo;all it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s so much shit you can get done</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sick but like if you have the money to do it you can complete change</p>
<p>the way that you look which will lead to more confidence you can change fucking</p>
<p>anything you want then you can go under the knife and get surgery and then you</p>
<p>can get your teeth done there&rsquo;s so many things you can get you get your hairline</p>
<p>done like literally you can fuck it there&rsquo;s like dick extension surgeries</p>
<p>and like vaginal rejuvenation you&rsquo;ve been a hoe too long your shits like a</p>
<p>fucking hallway go get it sewed back up like there&rsquo;s so many things you can do</p>
<p>to just alter your body and make yourself more confident any insecurity</p>
<p>you have you can get it fixed if you have money and with that comes steroids</p>
<p>steroids are so fucking expensive I literally like didn&rsquo;t realize I genuinely</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t realize how expensive steroids are but when you got money bitch you can</p>
<p>afford to go get steroids you can afford to get the little cheat codes for going</p>
<p>to the gym you want progress faster boom get some steroids you can afford it and</p>
<p>you can afford the medical care to make sure you get the good shit you can</p>
<p>afford to get your blood work drawn every week and read by a physician to</p>
<p>help you to make sure you&rsquo;re safe with that with the steroids and going to the</p>
<p>gym thing you can fucking pay to go to a nice gym going to nicer gyms motivate</p>
<p>you and make you feel inspired and make you just feel better like to have a</p>
<p>clean environment where people around you are motivating because everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in goddamn shape you can pay for a trainer that can teach you what the fuck</p>
<p>to do you can pay for a trainer to just have someone to be accountable with</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many things you can do when you have money that will expedite all of</p>
<p>that and just make it so much easier and so much better so the next thing</p>
<p>with confidence is you can literally pay for a wardrobe and a lot of us have a</p>
<p>certain style we&rsquo;ve always wanted we just couldn&rsquo;t afford it like we have</p>
<p>certain ways we want to look we just don&rsquo;t have the money to buy the clothes</p>
<p>that we want to fucking buy and when you have money you can finally express</p>
<p>yourself and be fully confident and put the effort into your appearance a lot of</p>
<p>people are like I don&rsquo;t have time to worry about my appearance yeah bitch</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re stressed the fuck out working too much like you don&rsquo;t have money so your</p>
<p>attention is on making more money not in the way that you look but like I get it</p>
<p>but we all have a way we want to look and when you have money and you can</p>
<p>afford to dress the way you want to dress and like exhibit your style and</p>
<p>like embody it oh it&rsquo;s the nicest fucking feeling but that&rsquo;s a big sense</p>
<p>of freedom you&rsquo;ll get is being able to like fully express yourself through your</p>
<p>clothes and I know I only wear black but I do it with personality leave me alone</p>
<p>and dressing the way that you want to dress will make you feel better it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just the weirdest little thing and money gives you that freedom all right next I</p>
<p>want to talk about being lonely you&rsquo;re way less lonely when you got money and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you an example from when I moved to Houston I didn&rsquo;t know anyone</p>
<p>I had my cousins who would live like 30 minutes away they all had COVID when I</p>
<p>first came to Houston for my first like month I was like not seeing anyone I was</p>
<p>isolated I met a couple of people randomly one from social media who</p>
<p>introduced me to like two more and then it was just like it just spiraled from</p>
<p>there and it was great but I wanted to go to pride in Houston like the gay</p>
<p>pride parade and like the whole little shebang and I didn&rsquo;t have anyone to go</p>
<p>with because all my friends were busy and my family was busy and I was</p>
<p>literally like it&rsquo;s my first pride and I don&rsquo;t want to go alone but I&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>miss out on it like I moved to a bigger city to get to have these experiences so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go and I have to go to my first pride alone I had a fucking blast</p>
<p>I met so many people I met this little friend group that I hung out with and I</p>
<p>fucking loved them to death like I went and hung out with them we fucking hung</p>
<p>out all night until like 4 in the morning we ended the night with a</p>
<p>fucking blunt on the sidewalk and we just like had the best night like they</p>
<p>were just they were so genuine I met them cuz I went alone it was just weird</p>
<p>how it all fell but I also met some of you guys that recognized me and that was</p>
<p>fun but I was kind of bummed that like I had to go to my first pride alone</p>
<p>because I feel very uncomfortable like going and being around gays is stressful</p>
<p>for me and I want to do a full podcast episode about my experience with the gay</p>
<p>community and why I feel so fucking uncomfortable and unwelcome but my whole</p>
<p>situation with the pride thing if I had money I could have just flown one of my</p>
<p>friends from Florida out to fucking spend the weekend with me and I</p>
<p>considered it but flights were like 400 bucks like minimum and I was like shit</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t want to go spend 400 bucks this is right when I moved to Houston so</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t like figure nothing out financially yet but I literally was like</p>
<p>if I had money right now I could pay to have someone I care about come with me</p>
<p>or I could pay for one of my friends in Houston to be off work I could give them</p>
<p>their money for their shift they were gonna make and just skip it and then</p>
<p>come to the pride parade with me but I had to go fucking alone being lonely is</p>
<p>not really like a thing like you miss someone fly them to you you miss someone</p>
<p>fly to them you miss somewhere fly there like it&rsquo;s just money gives you</p>
<p>that freedom to not feel alone if you exercise it and use the money right so a</p>
<p>couple more ways that money has made me more happy is tipping like when you get</p>
<p>to go somewhere I love to just tip people and like when someone is a good</p>
<p>waiter a good waitress a good service provider like customer service anything</p>
<p>I always like to tip people and when I didn&rsquo;t have money I would always like I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a type where if I don&rsquo;t have the money to tip right I&rsquo;m not going out to</p>
<p>eat period if you don&rsquo;t have the money to tip your fucking server right don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go out to eat you can&rsquo;t fucking afford it sorry going out to eat is a luxury and</p>
<p>too many people have gotten fucking comfortable with that shit and expect it</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just an extra to go out to eat it&rsquo;s like yeah it&rsquo;s like an expected</p>
<p>thing y&rsquo;all fucking think you&rsquo;re entitled to that shit going out to eat is</p>
<p>a fucking luxury remember me saying that if you can&rsquo;t afford to do it right don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go cuz the motherfuckers that don&rsquo;t tip are the same ones that complain about</p>
<p>every fucking thing there was too much ice in my drink shut the fuck up I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t be a waiter I get fired in two seconds but literally with tipping like</p>
<p>I love that I&rsquo;m able to tip people more now and I&rsquo;ve always been big on that</p>
<p>like when I was with my ex there was this kid that drove valet and when we</p>
<p>pulled up like it was freezing fucking cold outside and he was sitting in his</p>
<p>car like in between people coming up and it&rsquo;s like as soon as someone pull up he</p>
<p>would hop out and like go greet them get their car park it and then you would go</p>
<p>get back in his car to get in the heat and his car was like an older car it was</p>
<p>a kind of beat up and I just felt so fucking bad for the kid I was with my ex</p>
<p>at the time who had a lot of money but I was still working as a nurse so like I</p>
<p>had my own little bit it wasn&rsquo;t a lot but after we left the restaurant and the</p>
<p>kid came and gave us the car I was sitting in the car and I was like I get</p>
<p>this weird intuition where people need money and I always give it to them I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what it is but I will just feel something with waiters waitresses</p>
<p>any anyone that I see like they all randomly just get an urge to go up with</p>
<p>someone just like hand the money and I never second-guess I never question it</p>
<p>and it always like hits who it needs to so I let money like do its thing through</p>
<p>me like I&rsquo;m very intuitive and in touch with that and I&rsquo;ve always been like that</p>
<p>so I made my ex stop the car I got out and I went back to the kid and I was</p>
<p>like hey I want to tip you and I was like I don&rsquo;t have cash like is there an</p>
<p>ATM around or do you take like Venmo like do you have PayPal anything like</p>
<p>that and he was like yeah I have Venmo so I got his Venmo and I tipped him a</p>
<p>hundred dollars and it didn&rsquo;t feel like enough like I was literally standing</p>
<p>there in a fucking Balenciaga jacket with a fucking Rolex on I didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>fucking like and I had all this Cartier shit on and I was just like I feel</p>
<p>embarrassed so I tipped him another thousand bucks so I gave the kid 1100</p>
<p>bucks and like the way he lit up for the $100 like I didn&rsquo;t send him the</p>
<p>money until I left like as I had his Venmo so I just sent him the money like</p>
<p>after I pulled off like he got happy about the hundred and then like I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel like satisfied with it like I felt just weird and like I needed to like</p>
<p>give it to him like if anybody fucking deserves it it&rsquo;s him he&rsquo;s there fucking</p>
<p>working his ass off I&rsquo;m over here just dating some rich prick what the fuck I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m I will give as much as I fucking can so I sent him the money</p>
<p>after we pulled off and like he left a comment and like commented back to me</p>
<p>and was like so grateful it&rsquo;s so thankful and was like basically saying</p>
<p>something broke in his car and he didn&rsquo;t have heat in his car so when he was</p>
<p>sitting between taking people&rsquo;s like cars for a ballet he would just sit in</p>
<p>his car to get away from the wind I thought he had heating in there he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t and he literally was like thank you so much now I can afford to go get</p>
<p>like the heat repaired in my car and it just like listen to your fucking</p>
<p>intuition if money tells you to give it to somebody fucking give it to them I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s a goddamn stranger just give it the more you give it the</p>
<p>more it comes back I don&rsquo;t know how it works but it always just has just worked</p>
<p>like that for me if you&rsquo;re too scared don&rsquo;t try it but I&rsquo;m very in touch like</p>
<p>that seeing suffering like that or seeing someone like uncomfortable and</p>
<p>just being able to help them is the best fucking feeling I could like ever</p>
<p>describe you know like oh my god just being able to tip people and do things</p>
<p>for people and give them money and like help them and give them things it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>the best freedom like I want to help you not be uncomfortable if I can do</p>
<p>something to help that whether it costs money or doesn&rsquo;t I want to do it so like</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m able to just like have money to throw at shit oh my god the whole thing</p>
<p>about giving to other people when you have a heart like mine and you want to</p>
<p>give to others but you don&rsquo;t have enough to give you&rsquo;re put in like a standstill</p>
<p>of like I can choose to hurt myself because I want to help my friend or I</p>
<p>cannot help my friend and not hurt myself and just keep the money it just</p>
<p>sucks cuz like when you don&rsquo;t have the money and you want to help or you have</p>
<p>to take something from yourself to give it to them and I don&rsquo;t like to be in</p>
<p>that position so being in a position where like I have a little bit of extra</p>
<p>money and I can help other people and like give it out that shit makes me so</p>
<p>goddamn happy like it&rsquo;s such a relief and like it&rsquo;s such a battle that people</p>
<p>will never really talk about when you have a good heart and you want to help</p>
<p>people but you don&rsquo;t have money like it&rsquo;s such a battle because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>constantly with like me or them me or them me or them that&rsquo;s not fucking fun</p>
<p>so money sets you free from that and you&rsquo;re able to just let your heart out</p>
<p>and just do what you feel called to do freely that&rsquo;s a fucking relief I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>explain and the last thing I have to say about money making you happy this</p>
<p>episode is too goddamn long it is 2 15 in the morning and I want to go to bed</p>
<p>tired but when you have money you don&rsquo;t have to tell yourself no to your desires</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to tell yourself no to the things that you want and when you</p>
<p>constantly have to tell yourself no to shit it&rsquo;s painful and it hurts like to</p>
<p>look around and see things that you want or see things that can improve your life</p>
<p>or improve your confidence or things that would just make you happy and you</p>
<p>have to constantly tell yourself no to that that&rsquo;s fucking miserable and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not saying like a spoiled brat I&rsquo;m just saying like little shit like there was</p>
<p>this story I saw a long time ago about this homeless woman and they asked her</p>
<p>like what she spent her last like $40 or $50 on or so I don&rsquo;t know the context of</p>
<p>the story but basically she had like 50 bucks left to her name and she went and</p>
<p>bought like a lobster dinner from some restaurant and like sat there and ate it</p>
<p>and the people interviewing her were like why would you spend your last 50</p>
<p>bucks on that like a one-time dinner you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to eat again</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like cuz it just made me fucking happy and something people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand about people that don&rsquo;t have money to like do shit is little moments</p>
<p>mean a lot like when you don&rsquo;t have money you&rsquo;re so upset and life is so</p>
<p>just it seems unfair and it every time you turn around it&rsquo;s more headache it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more just upset and so for someone to go spend 10 bucks and go buy a pack of</p>
<p>cigarettes and they get to like have a cigarette like 20 times because they</p>
<p>have 20 like that little box of joy for them like it&rsquo;s worth the 10 bucks even</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s their last 10 bucks like homeless people that go just buy liquor</p>
<p>bitch if I was in that position I would be buying liquor too if I was fucking</p>
<p>homeless on the street my only excitement would be oh my god I get to</p>
<p>save up enough money I&rsquo;m about to have a few more bucks I&rsquo;m gonna go buy a</p>
<p>fucking shot I would be doing the exact same shit because the places people are</p>
<p>in you got to look at their situation before you judge what the fuck they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing not having money like you can&rsquo;t judge how people spend their money like</p>
<p>oh my god my brain is like not making words I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just late or</p>
<p>this topic but people that don&rsquo;t have money want a lot like they want a lot of</p>
<p>things they feel like they cannot have and when you&rsquo;re sitting here and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like oh my god I would just love to have a car or I would love to have a</p>
<p>house or have a home or not have five fucking roommates or to have a job or</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say they want a consistent place they know they can get food from that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a valid fucking want and a lot of people don&rsquo;t have that and they don&rsquo;t see a way</p>
<p>to get that so if they go buy a box of fucking cigarettes or they go buy a</p>
<p>lobster fucking meal they get to go forget about the worry for a second and</p>
<p>just enjoy themselves in the moment they don&rsquo;t have to sit here and worry</p>
<p>about all the shit and how they have had to tell their self no so many fucking</p>
<p>times because they just can&rsquo;t have shit it&rsquo;s like they tell themselves no but</p>
<p>also everything else tells them no because they don&rsquo;t have the money to buy</p>
<p>it like how cornered you would fucking feel so don&rsquo;t judge a homeless person</p>
<p>for going to buy a goddamn cigarette or shooting up with fucking heroin I&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>doing the same shit maybe not shooting it I would just start it because once</p>
<p>you shoot it it&rsquo;s like you know coming back from it but that was my last point</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to tell yourself no to things which is a painful thing you</p>
<p>still have to tell yourself no no matter how much money you have but it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>constant no it&rsquo;s not a constant feeling like you want something and having to</p>
<p>shove it down and be like no you can&rsquo;t have it or you can&rsquo;t afford it or what</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s just no longer that block and like that hurt y&rsquo;all know what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about when you want something so much and you just can&rsquo;t have it and then</p>
<p>you have to cope with not having it and it&rsquo;s like you didn&rsquo;t even realize you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want it until this thing came up and you&rsquo;re like oh my god this new</p>
<p>desire can I be like oh my god I want that but you don&rsquo;t see a way to get it</p>
<p>so now having that new desire causes you pain because you don&rsquo;t think you can</p>
<p>have it oh money saves you from a lot of that so that&rsquo;s the last thing I want to</p>
<p>say this is a long fucking episode but I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did</p>
<p>leave it a thumbs up if you&rsquo;re listening to the audio version leave me a five</p>
<p>stars rating and if you&rsquo;re on YouTube you should be watching on YouTube</p>
<p>everybody I bought all this fucking equipment watch me on YouTube but leave</p>
<p>me a comment and let me know what you thought I would love to see what you</p>
<p>guys have to say about this episode but I&rsquo;m going to do another episode I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if it will be next week or just sometime in the future about voids money</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fill because I was just devil&rsquo;s advocate and I talked about how money</p>
<p>does make you happy in certain ways from my experience but I&rsquo;m also gonna talk</p>
<p>about the voids that money can&rsquo;t fill and also the heartbreak that comes from</p>
<p>making a lot of money and getting a lot of money that I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone</p>
<p>talk about so I&rsquo;m gonna fucking do it oh one thing I want to throw in my clothing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m launching comes out February 1st 2023 I&rsquo;m so fucking excited so</p>
<p>follow me on Instagram I&rsquo;ll link it in the description I have a clothing page</p>
<p>and my main page I&rsquo;ll be posting on both but remember February 1st the clothing</p>
<p>drops all my socials and everywhere you can keep up with me will be in the</p>
<p>description I hope you enjoyed this episode I really do I hope it taught you</p>
<p>something or gave you a new perspective about something but I&rsquo;m gonna go take my</p>
<p>tired ass to bed I don&rsquo;t know if you can see my under eye bags because I got</p>
<p>filler to make them look less big but I&rsquo;m so goddamn tired right now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pretty sure it don&rsquo;t even work oh so on that note I will talk to you guys next</p>
<p>Sunday a little less tired</p>
