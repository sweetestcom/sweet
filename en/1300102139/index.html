<p>this is never been a time like this</p>
<p>you know every</p>
<p>other comedian</p>
<p>every other</p>
<p>generation needed</p>
<p>radio stations tv</p>
<p>stations and all that</p>
<p>stuff still helps</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s never been like this</p>
<p>where you can just do it all on your own somebody nick</p>
<p>was tell me once it was like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna move the big day on</p>
<p>movies from friday to saturday</p>
<p>in terms of like</p>
<p>industry like what it means to</p>
<p>their overall like how much i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get because they said</p>
<p>the social networking everyone gets so fast</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>forget saturday and make it all friday</p>
<p>because people get the word so fast</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like in real time</p>
<p>people are saying it and the word is getting out so</p>
<p>immediately</p>
<p>sucks yeah people will know</p>
<p>immediately</p>
<p>and saturday</p>
<p>will be dead</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>thing isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>because i mean how many times like back in the day</p>
<p>before there was like internet reviews</p>
<p>did you go see some shitty</p>
<p>movie you just</p>
<p>got unlucky that nobody told you it sucked</p>
<p>yeah no one</p>
<p>who else saw it nobody</p>
<p>their brothers are</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing when you look at</p>
<p>movies just</p>
<p>just from a few decades ago it&rsquo;s amazing how much</p>
<p>social evolution you see</p>
<p>how much the</p>
<p>movies of twenty</p>
<p>thirty years ago</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so bad like so many of them are so awful</p>
<p>that you say there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>people could not have realized it was this</p>
<p>awful back then</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the deal</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t they didn&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>things weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t the same</p>
<p>standard of judgment that that you</p>
<p>think we all</p>
<p>got smarter</p>
<p>more interesting and</p>
<p>therefore that was interesting back then but now we</p>
<p>can all relate to</p>
<p>that it was too simple</p>
<p>movies are much more sophisticated now</p>
<p>we demand much more</p>
<p>we demand like once you hit like a</p>
<p>movie like apocalypse now</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t ever go back to</p>
<p>those 1950s</p>
<p>stupid war movies</p>
<p>where it looked like they were on the set and</p>
<p>those fake palm trees and shit the acting sucked</p>
<p>i had to stay on the</p>
<p>stage as long</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>acting was corny as fuck it was</p>
<p>never realistic you know</p>
<p>i saw rainman</p>
<p>there and that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>movies oscar</p>
<p>thing did you watch</p>
<p>it i watched it like a year ago for the</p>
<p>first time it&rsquo;s horrible it&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s such an over the top character yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve got no ties to anyone</p>
<p>yeah clearly that guy let&rsquo;s set it up in the</p>
<p>first five minutes i know right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible yeah</p>
<p>but it seemed awesome back then</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure back then that movie was a badass movie</p>
<p>you know something&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>people have evolved</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only a few movies that really hold up</p>
<p>where you can watch them</p>
<p>you know a few blockbusters from the 80s especially not</p>
<p>where you can watch them and go yeah this is</p>
<p>still a pretty badass movie but for the most part</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t watch star wars</p>
<p>no if you want</p>
<p>if you want to</p>
<p>still love your childhood don&rsquo;t watch star wars</p>
<p>again will be betrayed so sad</p>
<p>everybody was like why did star wars</p>
<p>three and four why they suck so bad</p>
<p>because the first one suck too yeah</p>
<p>it just didn&rsquo;t suck back then</p>
<p>suck back then</p>
<p>back then it was awesome dude i saw star wars 13 times</p>
<p>when i was a kid</p>
<p>really dude i was a huge star wars fan</p>
<p>i want to see it over and over and over</p>
<p>again i would go with my friends was the</p>
<p>first movie that i didn&rsquo;t even heard of</p>
<p>where people would talk</p>
<p>about how many times he has seen it</p>
<p>would have like competitions do you see</p>
<p>star wars ten times</p>
<p>i saw it thirteen times wow</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>going oh my</p>
<p>god i don&rsquo;t remember last time i seen a movie</p>
<p>twice the video</p>
<p>is ridiculous</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>childish behavior</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that my</p>
<p>daughter would do do</p>
<p>you love it</p>
<p>every time yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only getting</p>
<p>tired of it</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something to it</p>
<p>where you just for some</p>
<p>weird reason you just want to</p>
<p>watch it over and over and over again</p>
<p>so spastic retarded</p>
<p>sort of a thing</p>
<p>i said i was</p>
<p>gonna do that with inception but then i never did</p>
<p>with inception really</p>
<p>so i gotta watch it</p>
<p>again but then it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>movie was too much for me</p>
<p>there was too much going on</p>
<p>i thought it was a really interesting</p>
<p>movie as really</p>
<p>they took a lot of chances and there&rsquo;s a lot of unique</p>
<p>thoughts in it</p>
<p>and that the way they set up the environment</p>
<p>where the sky</p>
<p>could fold over itself and backed up</p>
<p>brilliant it was brilliant brilliant stuff</p>
<p>but it was too much of it i was like</p>
<p>okay this is like a</p>
<p>dream like cause this is like working like a</p>
<p>video game every time you point and</p>
<p>shoot the people go down like that&rsquo;s dumb to me</p>
<p>like this is</p>
<p>i know i&rsquo;m supposed to</p>
<p>accept that this is a</p>
<p>dream it&rsquo;s hard with that</p>
<p>dream within a</p>
<p>dream stuff yeah</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>what does that mean</p>
<p>come on yeah</p>
<p>you lose my</p>
<p>level that and time travel</p>
<p>always like yeah so</p>
<p>what happened there and you go back and forth</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>freaks me out man the idea of of</p>
<p>being able to</p>
<p>transport something through the air</p>
<p>you know cause they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about like that star trek type shit</p>
<p>numbered transporters</p>
<p>one of those</p>
<p>things needs to</p>
<p>beam people up the flow</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about that being a real possibility someday</p>
<p>i mean i think they&rsquo;ve done it with like</p>
<p>quantum objects i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;ve done it with with</p>
<p>you know with</p>
<p>almost immeasurably</p>
<p>small things</p>
<p>but i think they were really</p>
<p>thinking that one day you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to</p>
<p>transport matter</p>
<p>from one paid</p>
<p>place to another place</p>
<p>and hope the</p>
<p>power doesn&rsquo;t go out in the middle right</p>
<p>yeah that was always one episode</p>
<p>of all the star treks with somebody got lost in the</p>
<p>transport yeah</p>
<p>and that was it he was good</p>
<p>know where they were he&rsquo;s gone yeah</p>
<p>the dimension that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>scary dude i&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>that what happened in our lifetime</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know man i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>stupid i&rsquo;m way too</p>
<p>stupid to know</p>
<p>yeah you know i</p>
<p>would just be</p>
<p>guessing at the top</p>
<p>of my ass like yes</p>
<p>yeah the fuck knows</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t understand what</p>
<p>would it would take to do that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t understand how far they really are</p>
<p>real thing the real question is</p>
<p>once artificial intelligence</p>
<p>starts taking over</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real</p>
<p>thing because then</p>
<p>things are gonna happen so fast there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be so much</p>
<p>acceleration</p>
<p>that yeah it</p>
<p>could be within our lifetime</p>
<p>because what artificial intelligence is</p>
<p>gonna be is like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have a computer</p>
<p>that can think</p>
<p>much much faster than a person and can</p>
<p>think for itself</p>
<p>and then once</p>
<p>it does that if you decide to have this computer</p>
<p>make new and better computers</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna make</p>
<p>newer better computers like instant</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna just like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna instantly</p>
<p>start creating and</p>
<p>figuring out exactly how to do it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>accelerate way past what we&rsquo;re capable of</p>
<p>so you know</p>
<p>once that happens</p>
<p>i made this</p>
<p>thing on npr</p>
<p>the only reason i mentioned mpr</p>
<p>i guess this is being</p>
<p>smart but um</p>
<p>but they were talking about</p>
<p>super computers that beat this jeopardy guy</p>
<p>oh yeah and the one</p>
<p>to beat the jeopardy guy</p>
<p>so and then the ones that beat</p>
<p>the chess players back in the</p>
<p>eighties right</p>
<p>blue yeah big blue</p>
<p>so you built this big blue to be this</p>
<p>chess player and at first</p>
<p>i think they</p>
<p>would beat him</p>
<p>the second match</p>
<p>was either a stalemate or what&rsquo;s the name big blue</p>
<p>but they said that</p>
<p>not even a chess master but a regular good</p>
<p>chess player with a</p>
<p>simple computer can be big blue like every</p>
<p>time wow yeah</p>
<p>just some simple to calculate i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand just enough but</p>
<p>kept it odd</p>
<p>to tell me that</p>
<p>they can be any sort of</p>
<p>professional</p>
<p>chess player</p>
<p>i watched some</p>
<p>chess videos online the</p>
<p>other day yeah</p>
<p>just for a goof i was</p>
<p>i was online and just</p>
<p>flipping through different youtube videos</p>
<p>and i saw this</p>
<p>speed chess video</p>
<p>so i watched</p>
<p>these guys do it yeah it was a</p>
<p>world speed</p>
<p>chess championship</p>
<p>it was pretty badass because</p>
<p>the guy lost</p>
<p>cause he ran out of time</p>
<p>have a total amount of time yeah i</p>
<p>think he had two minutes i</p>
<p>think they have two minutes for the full game</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sometimes they&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>ridiculously fast</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so exciting because it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>that added element of time to it oh my god</p>
<p>yeah somebody</p>
<p>should put that on television</p>
<p>now i&rsquo;m telling</p>
<p>you because just yeah because i barely know how to play</p>
<p>chess i know</p>
<p>how the moves go i know</p>
<p>which way they mean</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>nothing i don&rsquo;t know so i take</p>
<p>stupid chances i get</p>
<p>checkmate at all</p>
<p>you think about this</p>
<p>yeah okay i&rsquo;m too add</p>
<p>to be i&rsquo;m not saying that i&rsquo;m too add</p>
<p>playing when whenever i think about any game like chess</p>
<p>chest to me is just like pool</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m scared of it i&rsquo;m scared of anything that i become</p>
<p>massively addicted to</p>
<p>and i see people that get addicted to chess i would</p>
<p>yeah yeah some</p>
<p>great amazing game</p>
<p>amazing game</p>
<p>an amazing game is completely compelling</p>
<p>any more time for any more compelling shit in my life</p>
<p>no i just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t get hooked on something else between</p>
<p>jiu jitsu and pool and comedy</p>
<p>no i won&rsquo;t let myself</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t let myself</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t allow myself to play</p>
<p>video games that&rsquo;s why i won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>allow myself to go online video games yes</p>
<p>right ben&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always trying to get me go online like good good luck</p>
<p>we can play together i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>when i buy a game now</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>story mode yeah</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t see me for two weeks yeah</p>
<p>until i beat that game i&rsquo;m not pretty much</p>
<p>going out i&rsquo;ve overslept spots</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i fall</p>
<p>asleep like 5 p m</p>
<p>like i mean just all</p>
<p>crazy schedule</p>
<p>when i overslept at 10 45 p m</p>
<p>that is truly a</p>
<p>comics life</p>
<p>right there yeah</p>
<p>you know the fact that you</p>
<p>could do that</p>
<p>do that and know how damage it is but</p>
<p>still like me so</p>
<p>funny is that everybody or do we have like</p>
<p>a certain personality flaw that makes us be addicted to</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have any real responsibility</p>
<p>right i go on</p>
<p>stage for myself and to get better overall right but</p>
<p>i mean if i just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;ll be in a little trouble i</p>
<p>guess for for</p>
<p>skipping spots but not really what is it</p>
<p>about the games though that make you so addicted</p>
<p>i mean why it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in danger of someone coming up with an artificial</p>
<p>reality that&rsquo;s way more fascinating than regular</p>
<p>thanks for this</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>could you imagine if they figured out some sort of a</p>
<p>you know you know</p>
<p>remember with the always</p>
<p>thought you&rsquo;d be able to wear helmets and you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>about have a virtual</p>
<p>reality helmet</p>
<p>yeah but that</p>
<p>never panned out for some reason yeah</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t pan out still</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>might just figure out a way to do it just a year</p>
<p>from now or something like that it&rsquo;ll all come together</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like the idea was sort of</p>
<p>ahead of the technology</p>
<p>but if they do come up with the</p>
<p>technology that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in line with the idea and they come up with</p>
<p>amazingly ladies and gentlemen this podcast on a plane</p>
<p>almost never happened folks</p>
<p>it almost fell apart</p>
<p>because my iphone ran out of room</p>
<p>because i got a bunch of</p>
<p>stupid movies on this thing</p>
<p>you know so i had to unsink</p>
<p>my movie collection</p>
<p>because i like watching movies on my phone so</p>
<p>we were in the middle of doing the podcast and</p>
<p>even though it ran out of room it</p>
<p>still saved the file and uploaded it to itunes and</p>
<p>we were just</p>
<p>shocked at how good that was we looked on the actual</p>
<p>phone and it said</p>
<p>this voice memo zero</p>
<p>seconds like fuck did not save it at all we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>maybe plug it in</p>
<p>apple&rsquo;s really good at that usually yeah</p>
<p>like saving stuff that you just</p>
<p>lou for some reason</p>
<p>plugging your fucking they know we&rsquo;re idiots yeah i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done that before where i accidentally</p>
<p>like let my</p>
<p>power go out while i was writing something and then</p>
<p>you you go back to it and it&rsquo;s completely saved</p>
<p>every time yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never had nothing yeah it&rsquo;s amazing it&rsquo;s there like</p>
<p>would you like to revert like yes</p>
<p>because i remember</p>
<p>like windows ninety five man i remember</p>
<p>when you know when</p>
<p>things just would</p>
<p>just shut down the middle of you working and i was it</p>
<p>was gone forever</p>
<p>no everything you worked on was gone so files</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you back up like shut the fuck up</p>
<p>back up and when you have to back up</p>
<p>drives remember that</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>stupid one megabyte zip drives</p>
<p>one megabyte it&rsquo;s amazing how</p>
<p>can a song one megabyte i know it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy how like what was</p>
<p>what was big just a little</p>
<p>while ago ain&rsquo;t shit</p>
<p>you know they have</p>
<p>these little cool ass keychains</p>
<p>that are thirty two gig usb</p>
<p>drives exactly</p>
<p>gigabyte usb</p>
<p>drives little tiny things man</p>
<p>those little little</p>
<p>slide in usb</p>
<p>drives they&rsquo;re so big now</p>
<p>they like thirty gigs</p>
<p>forty gigs computer that i</p>

<p>twice as big</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the amount of</p>
<p>data you can save and a little tiny area now is so huge</p>
<p>thirty two gigs my phone is filled with shit</p>
<p>yeah it shut off yeah</p>
<p>but i mean it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>my first my</p>
<p>first computer the hard drive was four gigabytes</p>
<p>four and this is thirty two on a phone</p>
<p>you know well</p>
<p>before you know it&rsquo;ll be sixty four and i was</p>
<p>one of the sixty four i&rsquo;m hoping that one five</p>
<p>sixty four i bet it will</p>
<p>they sell movies why</p>
<p>would they mean</p>
<p>this is the reason why we have a problem</p>
<p>because i have all these</p>
<p>movies that i bought and it syncs up to it and takes up</p>
<p>space that doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense for them like financially</p>
<p>you think they</p>
<p>would want to have as much room as they can</p>
<p>yeah another one another one</p>
<p>yeah and have some</p>
<p>it would be nice if you had like a</p>
<p>storage drive too</p>
<p>like a little</p>
<p>removable one</p>
<p>a little 64 gig</p>
<p>removable one</p>
<p>are you selling</p>
<p>it out if you</p>
<p>want yeah why not man</p>
<p>they have that</p>
<p>in those droid</p>
<p>phones we have</p>
<p>removable ones</p>
<p>yeah a lot of them do a lot</p>
<p>of people are past</p>
<p>stuff from phone to</p>
<p>phone yeah and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t like yeah</p>
<p>so you know what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to pass the phone</p>
<p>they do that bump</p>
<p>thing now do contacts just by being close yeah</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do anything real big</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>you do like a big file yet</p>
<p>but yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s just a matter of time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like people know how to pull</p>
<p>things off the</p>
<p>phone put it on a computer and then just</p>
<p>email it to you</p>
<p>i mean remember when</p>
<p>apple got rid of</p>
<p>floppy drives</p>
<p>yes said we&rsquo;re just not</p>
<p>was not having them</p>
<p>like what do you do what do you mean like</p>
<p>the technology will</p>
<p>catch up we we</p>
<p>should be done with these now</p>
<p>and then it did</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need them at all anymore you need a cd for a</p>
<p>while and now nothing</p>
<p>floppy drives are so stupid</p>
<p>they look like</p>
<p>they look like something from some nineteen</p>
<p>fifty science fiction</p>
<p>you know old disc</p>
<p>that you stick in and there&rsquo;s data on the disc</p>
<p>what was it one megabyte</p>
<p>was that what it was</p>
<p>you get the</p>
<p>three think</p>
<p>only like word files</p>
<p>were perfect so what was it if that you get</p>
<p>three really</p>
<p>three gigabyte</p>
<p>three megabytes really it</p>
<p>might have been at the end</p>
<p>three megabytes</p>
<p>maybe early</p>
<p>on it was different but there&rsquo;s a floppy floppy that</p>
<p>would actually flop around so what was a what was a zip</p>
<p>drive was that like a hundred megabytes done</p>
<p>the early ones</p>
<p>maybe twenty five megabytes</p>
<p>fifty megabytes yeah</p>
<p>some like you get a lot of floppy deaf someone</p>
<p>no one ever</p>
<p>would have thought that you&rsquo;d be able to have</p>
<p>movies online</p>
<p>just download</p>
<p>movies online</p>
<p>yeah nobody really thought that was pretty</p>
<p>quickly yeah</p>
<p>i just moved up to uverse</p>
<p>and it has made my illegal downloading so much easier</p>
<p>oh yeah hnt</p>
<p>uverse it&rsquo;s like six</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like boom</p>
<p>oh my i&rsquo;m gonna get so much more stuff now</p>
<p>and you have that makes your</p>
<p>phone line your teeth</p>
<p>no phone no tv i don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that no so you just want at</p>
<p>you verse just</p>
<p>for the i got a tv just so i get a special deal on the</p>
<p>setup so they</p>
<p>could wave installation</p>
<p>and then i immediately call and said i don&rsquo;t want this</p>
<p>wow yeah so like unhook it</p>
<p>so you got no tv no tv</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an animal dude</p>
<p>look at you</p>
<p>basic network channels about you</p>
<p>unconnected to the system our</p>
<p>issue i love</p>
<p>it how come</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve wasted so much time on that tv</p>
<p>so i had cable</p>
<p>it was crazy</p>
<p>and people like working just look away but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how to explain addiction to you</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like some people are more addicted</p>
<p>than others and i couldn&rsquo;t look away just like goddamn</p>
<p>video games right</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s what we were getting into this before the</p>
<p>power went out</p>
<p>but what the hell is it</p>
<p>about games that get you so</p>
<p>addicted yeah</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>who can be like no i&rsquo;ll just play a couple couple</p>
<p>levels of hopefully</p>
<p>for thirty minutes and back to my family</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>imagine yeah</p>
<p>you get roped in</p>
<p>it gets crazy like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also you you play a lot of poker too</p>
<p>and you go and you know and you&rsquo;ll play for</p>
<p>hours and hours</p>
<p>and hours sometimes</p>
<p>down the casino</p>
<p>for ten hours man</p>
<p>i got my headphones and my fucking</p>
<p>just listen to albums wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>super stone</p>
<p>women never</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>they can never</p>
<p>understand my</p>
<p>mrs rogan was um</p>
<p>me and max i believe we&rsquo;re playing pool</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re playing pool for like fucking</p>
<p>eight hours and</p>
<p>you know she came downstairs</p>
<p>after eight</p>
<p>hours just like you guys are</p>
<p>still playing</p>
<p>like what the fuck you</p>
<p>guys do man</p>
<p>just like your mama come down with a friend</p>
<p>sleeping over exactly</p>
<p>when you get</p>
<p>into pool we get into get like a game of pool</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>really precise control you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>execute you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>move these balls around and</p>
<p>perfect or you</p>
<p>literally apply</p>
<p>for sessions yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had many of those</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a bending over and like it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter athlete</p>
<p>son you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand son</p>
<p>well no not really man</p>
<p>did jiu jitsu and cowbells and all that shit</p>
<p>i mean you get</p>
<p>tired at the end</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t get sore</p>
<p>you bending over you&rsquo;re supporting yourself on the</p>
<p>table and never bending over really</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not supporting yourself</p>
<p>you support yourself on your bridge</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>bad i&rsquo;m pretty flexible so it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t bother me</p>
<p>but i doesn&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t even think</p>
<p>about that all i think</p>
<p>about is that i&rsquo;m trying to get perfect on every ball</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying to figure out</p>
<p>exactly how much how much</p>
<p>force i have to exert on the cue to hit the cue ball</p>
<p>collide into the</p>
<p>object ball</p>
<p>and then go a couple rails off</p>
<p>to get in line</p>
<p>for the next ball and becomes an obsession</p>
<p>do you think you&rsquo;re better six</p>
<p>hours in than you are</p>
<p>twenty minutes a</p>
<p>hundred percent</p>
<p>hundred percent</p>
<p>wow you better</p>
<p>after jose freak</p>
<p>used to say that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even get warmed up</p>
<p>until eight</p>
<p>hours into a game that he</p>
<p>starts there like that&rsquo;s when he gets a</p>
<p>second money yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you get some stroke</p>
<p>it really is true man</p>
<p>when you play for a long long stretches</p>
<p>you get loose and</p>
<p>you get connected to the movement</p>
<p>like really connected to the movement of moving</p>
<p>a puke to you</p>
<p>and making a ball collide into</p>
<p>other balls you get</p>
<p>the more you do it the more you tune into the</p>
<p>exact force that&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>you get really accustomed to the cue</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just play pool for five minutes i mean you can</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>where the good pool is</p>
<p>the good pool is five</p>
<p>hours real touch yeah</p>
<p>yeah you get in five</p>
<p>hours in man</p>
<p>you know like my friend justin from the action report</p>
<p>a guy that we play pool</p>
<p>you and i about some fucking</p>
<p>sessions till five</p>
<p>in the morning</p>
<p>two pool players keep</p>
<p>going man i</p>
<p>played with</p>
<p>you for a long time before i</p>
<p>played for like four or five</p>
<p>hours never</p>
<p>brian would go</p>
<p>crazy because he&rsquo;s hanging</p>
<p>out with us</p>
<p>yeah on the road somewhere in denver show an</p>
<p>early stuff</p>
<p>all night you know it&rsquo;s like why don&rsquo;t we go to</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go this pool bar</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like oh</p>
<p>yeah good night</p>
<p>get mad he played pool a couple times for</p>
<p>those now he hates it he&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>to play two games then you go on no no</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t well</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s very different</p>
<p>you know which is</p>
<p>gonna be interesting</p>
<p>to see what happens to him as a comedian</p>
<p>what kind of a comedian he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna turn into</p>
<p>you know because he&rsquo;s got a lot of</p>
<p>the lot of the regular comedian</p>
<p>attributes neurosis</p>
<p>in attributes yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting because he&rsquo;s also done this</p>
<p>thing where one</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s really just</p>
<p>starting stand up but he</p>
<p>started 10 12 years ago yeah and then stopped</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still in his</p>
<p>brain a little bit yeah</p>
<p>so like you know if you take a week off you</p>
<p>still like worked it</p>
<p>out a little bit not as much as if you</p>
<p>would go on</p>
<p>stage but a little bit</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s gotten that</p>
<p>and he started</p>
<p>again four years ago or so</p>
<p>so we can&rsquo;t so we</p>
<p>still think and then he&rsquo;s hanging around it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>saying some top top</p>
<p>level comedy</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>with us and around la</p>
<p>yeah so it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s got the bar set really high</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that be more interesting than somebody</p>
<p>random just</p>
<p>started well it&rsquo;s way better than</p>
<p>starting in a bubble in like</p>
<p>you know columbus ohio</p>
<p>where it started</p>
<p>where there wasn&rsquo;t really that many good</p>
<p>local comics yeah</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the biggest</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s arguably</p>
<p>two places where</p>
<p>the best comedians</p>
<p>congregate it&rsquo;s new york we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to la that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s in one of those and</p>
<p>which one you</p>
<p>think is better</p>
<p>is arguable</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>valid responses</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of great</p>
<p>comics in la and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>great comics in new york i mean</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s probably pretty equal</p>
<p>i mean i think</p>
<p>maybe the seller is responsible for</p>
<p>like some of the like really truly</p>
<p>great stories</p>
<p>like of new york come out of there where guys</p>
<p>pop in and do sets and kill and cry</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s like the number one</p>
<p>coolest place</p>
<p>in new york yeah</p>
<p>the number one cool pop in spot</p>
<p>like where famous people like</p>
<p>you know chris rock will show up and</p>
<p>you know those kind of guys will show up</p>
<p>and do sets</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they call it like the most honest club</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a real hotbed</p>
<p>for sure yeah</p>
<p>but then so is the improv</p>
<p>you know the improv</p>
<p>and i like people</p>
<p>stopping all the time there&rsquo;s a lot of good</p>
<p>comics that are always working you see people just</p>
<p>going and not even going up</p>
<p>just stopping in for a little bit get a drink</p>
<p>maybe overall i</p>
<p>might give new york an edge</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s why i would give</p>
<p>them i give them both an edge i can</p>
<p>work an edge because</p>
<p>the comics once you</p>
<p>start full stand up comedy</p>
<p>two years in you know something like that</p>
<p>where your comic</p>
<p>right they can get up more</p>
<p>they could do more sense</p>
<p>and and to a degree practice makes perfect</p>
<p>right maybe but</p>
<p>the best of the best of new york</p>
<p>moved to la</p>
<p>well not really lucie kiddin</p>
<p>moved to la no a couple did</p>
<p>a little bit louie and</p>
<p>david tells</p>
<p>who knows where</p>
<p>he is but it&rsquo;s like bill</p>
<p>burr moves and</p>
<p>you move and it&rsquo;s like all</p>
<p>these people i</p>
<p>moved before i was good</p>
<p>yeah i was i got</p>
<p>successful then</p>
<p>come over i got way better once i came to la i was</p>
<p>half decent but i was</p>
<p>you know six years in the comedy i was clumsy</p>
<p>yeah when i came to</p>
<p>i mean i started out in eighty eight</p>
<p>and when i came to la it was 94</p>
<p>so it was really</p>
<p>that i did not have that much time in comedy</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why like</p>
<p>the best place</p>
<p>to work out is the place</p>
<p>that you have the most time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>place to work out</p>
<p>you need a lot of people but</p>
<p>the new york&rsquo;s clubs</p>
<p>you can get up a lot</p>
<p>but a lot of people are doing like</p>
<p>seven ten minute sets they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>short sets which is</p>
<p>great i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>entertaining</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>when you have a ten minute set</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain type of comedy that you do yeah you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ramble as much you don&rsquo;t go into certain like the</p>
<p>real subjects yeah</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some there&rsquo;s some bits that don&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>an understanding of how my</p>
<p>brain works like we&rsquo;re synced up with the audience</p>
<p>and then once you know</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re gonna have this</p>
<p>sense of how fucked up my thinking is</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll let you in on it</p>
<p>and then when i tell you something else then you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>understand why i&rsquo;m even talking about this in the first</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do that in</p>
<p>ten minutes touched on this before he died once</p>
<p>we talk about just like a last time</p>
<p>standing interview</p>
<p>he was saying how this is</p>
<p>on the big on the road</p>
<p>and city company</p>
<p>yeah and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>each one is valid he said and i started thinking</p>
<p>about it like they&rsquo;re just different</p>
<p>styles stand up almost</p>
<p>like if you would do a full hour for six months yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be in a different way than if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>two fifteen minute sets</p>
<p>every single day</p>
<p>yeah a lot of guys i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re doing fifteen there&rsquo;s a lot of tens going</p>
<p>on you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s tighter</p>
<p>yeah i think that&rsquo;s good when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to stand up because</p>
<p>you have to learn how to</p>
<p>get a crowd on your side so as many times as possible</p>
<p>learn to get the crowd on your side</p>
<p>but then at some</p>
<p>point you know how to get the crowd on your side</p>
<p>so then it becomes like i need to go over this material</p>
<p>and then the time comes better</p>
<p>and more valuable</p>
<p>i definitely think there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>going up in</p>
<p>front of a bunch of different audiences a</p>
<p>bunch of times a day too</p>
<p>you know just re experiencing the opening</p>
<p>over and over and over again which is the hardest part</p>
<p>you set the opening if you lose a</p>
<p>crowd that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll lose them almost always</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re re experiencing the opening over and over</p>
<p>again instead of just doing one opening and then easing</p>
<p>your way into</p>
<p>good material and then</p>
<p>going on and getting the</p>
<p>crowd and finishing your set</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>these short sets</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing the hardest part over and over and over</p>
<p>and you gotta</p>
<p>think of ways to</p>
<p>cause everyone wants to close</p>
<p>strong so you</p>
<p>gotta keep thinking of ways yeah cramming</p>
<p>how to close wrong</p>
<p>over and over</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>crazy art for it man</p>
<p>this but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird that there&rsquo;s only like</p>
<p>i guess san francisco&rsquo;s got a good</p>
<p>reputation too as does austin</p>
<p>those are two</p>
<p>other places</p>
<p>and boston did</p>
<p>at one time but i don&rsquo;t know if it does anymore</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>those are like</p>
<p>clearly like second</p>
<p>level stuff</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t hear anything</p>
<p>about boston anymore</p>
<p>you know do you do you ever hear</p>
<p>about guys coming from boston</p>
<p>an occasional guy but it just as much as phoenix or any</p>
<p>other random city you know not like a</p>
<p>scene of people coming out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a crazy</p>
<p>thing to see</p>
<p>i was never like</p>
<p>seattle in portland people they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to make a presence really yeah</p>
<p>anywhere with his wheat</p>
<p>and seattle</p>

<p>he grew up on</p>
<p>public golf courses</p>
<p>public golf courses are just</p>
<p>dirty it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a caddyshack</p>
<p>stuff it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the people who work in caddyshack that&rsquo;s like pool</p>
<p>same kind of</p>
<p>thing if you go there every day</p>
<p>but just like</p>
<p>pools with it some people like it&rsquo;s saturday night</p>
<p>comes the day to a pool</p>
<p>right be right next to the general gamblers</p>
<p>wow a lot of golfers are big gamblers right yeah</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>about i just</p>
<p>some to make more interesting i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>gambling off lends itself to gambling somehow</p>
<p>you can make handicapped</p>
<p>system that works really well</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you man when you play in pool nothing makes it more</p>
<p>exciting than even having five</p>
<p>bucks online</p>
<p>yeah when you and i</p>
<p>would play football</p>
<p>championship</p>
<p>give a hard what i give you the</p>
<p>eight ball or something you give me the</p>
<p>seven and the</p>
<p>seven and the nine</p>
<p>seven and nine yeah but</p>
<p>seven wasn&rsquo;t wild well we playing ten ball or nine ball</p>
<p>nine ball okay so i just gave you the</p>
<p>seven ball yeah</p>
<p>i gave ari the call</p>
<p>seven call seven</p>
<p>for pool players</p>
<p>but it would be</p>
<p>fun we would battle it out for five</p>
<p>bucks i mean the</p>
<p>table time was more than five bucks but</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>point the point was like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really trying to win</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing when you get into a game and you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>really really trying to win you figure out how to run</p>
<p>a rack out when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really nervous and sure you&rsquo;re trying to it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense you something make it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all you need just five bucks</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i say like</p>
<p>watching fights</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re gambling on the</p>
<p>fights is so much more</p>
<p>exciting yeah you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s one of the coolest</p>
<p>things about when we used to go to those</p>
<p>fights in vegas</p>
<p>you know when they had the wfa</p>
<p>and a bunch of different</p>
<p>yeah organizations you go bet on a man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>greatest thing i&rsquo;ve left</p>
<p>like mandalay mgm</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a time is like fifteen minutes so next fight</p>
<p>is like okay</p>
<p>go put the money on this here&rsquo;s 40 for this and 20</p>
<p>for that you&rsquo;re like okay and you run down there to the</p>
<p>sportsbook as fast as possible to come running back</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never asked anybody if i&rsquo;m allowed to</p>
<p>bent on the ufc</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t want to hear the answer</p>
<p>you have no outcome on the fight</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ve no way to</p>
<p>influence the outcome</p>
<p>but i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>influence the way people feel</p>
<p>about fighters yeah</p>
<p>which i don&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>try to do deliberately although people accuse me of it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just my opinions</p>
<p>everybody has different opinions you know i</p>
<p>i mean even when my friends are</p>
<p>fighting like george saudiropus is a good friend i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>trained with that guy a</p>
<p>bunch of times i like him a lot of hung out with him at</p>
<p>night with him and his wife and he&rsquo;s a great guy</p>
<p>but when he was</p>
<p>fighting dennis</p>
<p>ever and i&rsquo;m like dennis</p>
<p>he was a fucking</p>
<p>beast man and</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re in there i i i i have to look at you for</p>
<p>what your your flaws</p>
<p>are what your strengths are what your weaknesses yeah</p>
<p>and that was autoropolous</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta work on</p>
<p>his take downs man he can&rsquo;t take this guy down</p>
<p>and this guy is a fucking gorilla</p>
<p>dennis he was a big fucking</p>
<p>scary gorilla he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a dennis heber fan</p>
<p>you know even though</p>
<p>george is a good friend of mine and i&rsquo;m a dennis heber</p>
<p>fan i think he&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>monster you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>think that you you can</p>
<p>influence the</p>
<p>fight but you really can</p>
<p>but i wonder if it</p>
<p>would be against</p>
<p>some sort of law</p>
<p>if i gamble shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be you think they</p>
<p>would tell you</p>
<p>being a vegas</p>
<p>based organization you</p>
<p>would think</p>
<p>right that they</p>
<p>would say this retard isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stupid enough to think you</p>
<p>fucking gamble off</p>
<p>right knows</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t gamble right</p>
<p>well i probably fucking</p>
<p>could make some money</p>
<p>i could make some</p>
<p>money i&rsquo;m pretty goddamn good at picking fights</p>
<p>i would say i&rsquo;m probably more than 50</p>
<p>i mean with mma</p>
<p>shit you really almost</p>
<p>never know you have an insider</p>
<p>knowledge though yeah</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re talking about like</p>
<p>people want to bet on</p>
<p>whichever football team whichever</p>
<p>fighter that they</p>
<p>think is better</p>
<p>you have more of a reason to</p>
<p>think someone&rsquo;s better or worse</p>
<p>than other people you have a better knowledge of the</p>
<p>right but would</p>
<p>would be creepy as if you knew some shits inside</p>
<p>shit like if you knew</p>
<p>about like a knee injury or something like that</p>
<p>that was the case i</p>
<p>would never</p>
<p>bet on the fight there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>i would bet on something if i had some</p>
<p>freaky knowledge</p>
<p>but if you just like</p>
<p>after the range like you look good yeah then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not inside</p>
<p>yeah yeah but i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;ll bet and</p>
<p>against the</p>
<p>fighter when you know he&rsquo;s jacked that seems to me like</p>
<p>cheating that seems to me like insider trading</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it i always tell my friends like the</p>
<p>insider trading all i get from them is when they tell</p>
<p>me like what people are saying and sometimes it like</p>
<p>like chuck the</p>
<p>day after some before is the</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>with the silva</p>
<p>what is his name</p>
<p>no silva when chuck</p>
<p>adele fought silva</p>
<p>who ran away</p>
<p>mandala yeah</p>
<p>before that and</p>
<p>after the weigh ins</p>
<p>why the fuck</p>
<p>could i not</p>
<p>think of vandalism</p>
<p>is one of the best</p>
<p>syllable for some</p>
<p>reason goes i was trying to think of</p>
<p>i think of him as a one eighty five</p>
<p>pounder now for some</p>
<p>stupid reason</p>
<p>remember every all the</p>
<p>trainers and</p>
<p>stuff that i&rsquo;m friends with like oh</p>
<p>chuck look good i&rsquo;m like oh i</p>
<p>guess chuck looks good</p>
<p>then i have no idea how to tell that but then i told my</p>
<p>hey chuck looks good</p>
<p>well chuck always look good</p>
<p>chuck was the the prime years of chuck</p>
<p>now back when he knocked out randy kotor</p>
<p>two times in a row and</p>
<p>knocked out baba lou and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s knocking out everybody knocked out for an entire</p>
<p>one he just</p>
<p>knocked out everybody fought man everybody fought</p>
<p>he went in there guns blazing</p>
<p>and blasted him away for like years he was the</p>
<p>first one that was on the billboard of the hyatt</p>
<p>that they covered the</p>
<p>whole side he was the first one of</p>
<p>mma that was on there for like a while</p>
<p>dude chocolate down in his heyday man what a fucking</p>
<p>a warrior that guy was he was a</p>
<p>savage she would just go out there guns blazing</p>
<p>but his style</p>
<p>is so aggressive</p>
<p>that he leaves himself for counterattacks</p>
<p>you know yeah it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>marching forward like he got</p>
<p>knocked out by rich franklin</p>
<p>he was killing rich franklin because he</p>
<p>broke his arm</p>
<p>no the last</p>
<p>fight that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right he broke his arm he was</p>
<p>blasting a man</p>
<p>is really her chances and he left an opening</p>
<p>but he left more than that too</p>
<p>because rich tagged him a couple of times before that</p>
<p>i saw him really get to him a couple times before that</p>
<p>franklin hits hard and</p>
<p>he hit him with a couple of big shots</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like chuck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>aggressive style</p>
<p>was the reason why he was so good</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also the reason why</p>
<p>when your career is over it&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s over yeah you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get the same opportunities that a real tactician gets</p>
<p>you know not that he wasn&rsquo;t a tactician he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super aggressive</p>
<p>you know but like</p>
<p>the guys who like our</p>
<p>safety first fighters</p>
<p>you know they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get the people who love him as much though</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>get you know they get</p>
<p>they get to not take as much punishment</p>
<p>but people for whatever reason don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>why are people not liking tim</p>
<p>sylvia after</p>
<p>well but i was like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>champion why</p>
<p>should he take chances</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when i was</p>
<p>learning mma and</p>
<p>stuff learning</p>
<p>about it not putting it but like</p>
<p>people like</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s just born he plays a safe he wins the first</p>
<p>you know three</p>
<p>rounds and then</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m not taking any chance for the next two</p>
<p>right and then but i was like why</p>
<p>should he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seem like a good decision to take chances when he&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>three or nothing</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going down</p>
<p>what is that</p>
<p>noise it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>plane breaking apart</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>um i take your tea</p>
<p>no no okay yeah um</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know man all</p>
<p>these years of</p>
<p>watching fights</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s almost like i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen too many i have like too many stored in my memory</p>
<p>the overloading</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had them</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>ufc since ufc</p>
<p>thirty seven and a half was like the</p>
<p>first one that i worked</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s like way more than a thousand fights</p>
<p>but way more</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>ufcs and all the</p>
<p>spike shows to sure</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like at</p>
<p>least nine shows nine</p>
<p>fights per show</p>
<p>at least oh</p>
<p>thousand fights yeah oh and i</p>
<p>was like wait what</p>
<p>and by the way why did i</p>
<p>think that was even a possibility</p>
<p>oh my god my map is like</p>
<p>we do so many this year on</p>
<p>spike tv and so</p>
<p>many pay per views</p>
<p>versus you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;ve done so many</p>
<p>fights i think it&rsquo;s somewhere around a thousand fights</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>probably 10 to 12 of each one</p>
<p>yeah most the most is 12 but it&rsquo;s usually 11</p>
<p>but either way it&rsquo;s been so many</p>
<p>fights that it&rsquo;s almost like they</p>
<p>blur like i forget</p>
<p>who fought did you ever go</p>
<p>under card fire</p>
<p>did you ever go to</p>
<p>watch any of the</p>
<p>ultimate fighter</p>
<p>fights i still</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>missed it this</p>
<p>year i didn&rsquo;t get a chance this year i was too busy</p>
<p>this year while they were doing it this</p>
<p>season i was</p>
<p>super busy but</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you go to</p>
<p>vegas sometimes</p>
<p>during when they&rsquo;re filming ultimate</p>
<p>fighter yeah but when you&rsquo;re there for the fights man</p>
<p>i work out and i go do a show somewhere half the time</p>
<p>you know vegas is like the most</p>
<p>common that i don&rsquo;t do a show you know</p>
<p>you should go roll with</p>
<p>those guys on the</p>
<p>ultimate fighter</p>
<p>some of them</p>
<p>right you should</p>
<p>stop in there one day roll them for a little while</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>interesting because then you get your workout in yeah</p>
<p>especially on some shows you don&rsquo;t have a friday</p>
<p>night show yeah</p>
<p>go on there i can roll with them a little bit got a</p>
<p>sweat and then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be cool yeah</p>
<p>i bet ufc would like you to do that too</p>
<p>yeah see when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sweating yeah</p>
<p>until i put the</p>
<p>choke to some of those boys</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t show this</p>
<p>these are punishment</p>
<p>squeeze the neck my friend go to sleep now</p>
<p>the joke is hard what a</p>
<p>crazy way to try to make a living huh</p>
<p>those guys are really savages</p>
<p>jokers people no those guys getting into the ufc and</p>
<p>entering into the ultimate</p>
<p>fighter and getting on that show and being in that</p>
<p>house with a</p>
<p>bunch of dudes that you&rsquo;re gonna have to fight</p>
<p>what a crazy idea for a show that shit will go on for</p>
<p>a billion years okay because it&rsquo;s always interesting</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always new people that want to fight</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always you know</p>
<p>fucking new great</p>
<p>rivalries that get born out of that house</p>
<p>yeah they painted</p>
<p>it in the ufc like six years later</p>
<p>the point that never was you know</p>
<p>some of the</p>
<p>greatest rivalries ever have come from that house</p>
<p>diego sanchez and fucking kenny florian that fight</p>
<p>i never watch that show i never got into that show</p>
<p>that was season one man really they&rsquo;re both</p>

<p>but he&rsquo;s got such</p>
<p>big balls that he fought in the hundred eighty five</p>
<p>pound division when he&rsquo;s a natural one</p>
<p>fifty five or</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s walking like one eighty two</p>
<p>say fucking all fat and shit</p>
<p>walking all fat slung</p>
<p>slung dick and</p>
<p>elbows i like that guy in florida he&rsquo;s a nice guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a nice guy and he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>smart guy i like him a lot</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like i know he&rsquo;s not jewish but i don&rsquo;t correct</p>
<p>people when they say he is haha you take him as an</p>
<p>honorary joe</p>
<p>you like kenny florian</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not a realy joe</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a great guy he&rsquo;s one of those rare guys</p>
<p>that had like a real happy</p>
<p>childhood too</p>
<p>as there is</p>
<p>close to action doctors right</p>
<p>family guy yeah they&rsquo;re all i</p>
<p>think his father&rsquo;s a surgeon</p>
<p>yeah yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>crazy man he&rsquo;s like you grew up he just</p>
<p>wants to do it that&rsquo;s what he wants to do you know</p>
<p>grant hill was</p>
<p>like that his dad was a professional football player</p>
<p>really yeah always</p>
<p>got along with him was like what you want to do play</p>
<p>basketball okay go for it</p>
<p>mma kind of</p>
<p>go for it yeah well that&rsquo;s a good dad yeah</p>
<p>those those creepy dads that want kids to do what</p>
<p>what you want them to do</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrible you see that suppression</p>
<p>that really fucks kids</p>
<p>heads up my dad was so mad at me when i quit soccer</p>
<p>was he was so mad i didn&rsquo;t get it till way</p>
<p>later while i was so mad</p>
<p>i just thought he was</p>
<p>teaching me how to not to be a quitter or something</p>
<p>right but really it&rsquo;s because he grew up playing soccer</p>
<p>wanted me to play soccer</p>
<p>right he did</p>
<p>wow i know it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>weird isn&rsquo;t it if my kid didn&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>jiu jitsu i just have to recognize that</p>
<p>you have to accept it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be tough though</p>
<p>like something else you want to do yeah</p>
<p>yeah you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want your kid</p>
<p>to do something they don&rsquo;t want to do you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna create</p>
<p>some angry person the</p>
<p>worst portrayal</p>
<p>of if one of your kids was like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna play a team sports</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>no i wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>look i like pool</p>
<p>pool is way</p>
<p>more boring to a lot of people than baseball</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>in baseball is boring</p>
<p>but to me you know it&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>should be able to like and</p>
<p>watch whatever you want uh huh</p>
<p>you know i i fully</p>
<p>support that</p>
<p>but i just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that a lot of people</p>
<p>think of kids as being</p>
<p>individual people</p>
<p>i think they</p>
<p>think of them</p>
<p>as an extension of them like they own that kid</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s for your dad it&rsquo;s like this is my son</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t my son playing soccer no</p>
<p>that should be this yeah</p>
<p>i really see a quitter now i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna quit things yeah that&rsquo;s probably seven haha</p>
<p>uncle say something like that</p>
<p>about me like quitting</p>
<p>things and i got</p>
<p>really pissed that i went and talked to him for years</p>
<p>wow this is</p>
<p>silliness man</p>
<p>you know when people talk</p>
<p>about being quitters and</p>
<p>not quitting</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that</p>
<p>to a kid when you&rsquo;re like giving them that negative</p>
<p>reinforcement like that what are you</p>
<p>gonna be a quitter</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s not how to deal with it you know</p>
<p>the way to deal with it well the problem is most people</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t push</p>
<p>out that part of</p>
<p>one thing like</p>
<p>eight years old and like that&rsquo;s what i do forever</p>
<p>shit like will</p>
<p>smith we&rsquo;re just saying he didn&rsquo;t quit</p>
<p>rap he just</p>
<p>he did it for five or six years</p>
<p>and they did</p>
<p>something else</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also you know one person soccer&rsquo;s another person&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basketball you just have to find that</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>it for you it wasn&rsquo;t soccer but</p>
<p>maybe it would have been</p>
<p>you know what what the fuck ever gymnastics you</p>
<p>really want</p>
<p>to do it yeah</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s something you</p>
<p>gotta find what the fuck you like</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be dependent</p>
<p>on somebody else here&rsquo;s pizza</p>
<p>he was friends with</p>
<p>gretzky because there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a practice player for the kings for a while</p>
<p>wow and he went to like some signings with him</p>
<p>right just like hang out with him and stuff</p>
<p>and he said some</p>
<p>guy was like you know took his son in line to get a</p>
<p>gretzky book sign or</p>
<p>gretzky poster signed</p>
<p>and he goes you know</p>
<p>wayne tell my son how important it is to practice</p>
<p>every day you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really important</p>
<p>to do that and they left and</p>
<p>he turned to</p>
<p>harris and he was like the</p>
<p>thing is when i was his age</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i wanted to do</p>
<p>was play hockey</p>
<p>no one had to tell me to practice</p>
<p>this is all i wanted to do</p>
<p>so i guess technically i was practicing but</p>
<p>i was just playing</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t make someone want to practice</p>
<p>yeah i know shit you know</p>
<p>you like it and do it all the time yeah</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>then don&rsquo;t do it at all</p>
<p>do something else that you</p>
<p>like doing it do that all the time yeah no kidding man</p>
<p>it just sucks to feel like a pool player</p>
<p>where your sport the</p>
<p>thing you love to do all the time</p>
<p>can net you</p>
<p>five bucks a year yeah</p>
<p>you know professionals</p>
<p>bowling it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna make any</p>
<p>money i know some guys that do like mika eminem</p>
<p>he plays professional pool he makes good money</p>
<p>and you know like</p>
<p>shane bambone</p>
<p>he makes good</p>
<p>money like that</p>
<p>the upper echelon players</p>
<p>but like max you know</p>
<p>max is struggling max is one of the best guys in the</p>
<p>world he just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t win enough tournaments</p>
<p>places like</p>
<p>third here you know</p>
<p>get like four</p>
<p>three six how much</p>
<p>is the ninety</p>
<p>ninth best pool player in the</p>
<p>world man fuck</p>
<p>compared to golfer</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>ridiculous a</p>
<p>night night method in nba is a starter</p>
<p>yeah professional starter on</p>
<p>makes hundreds of thousands of dollars a year</p>
<p>millions yeah</p>
<p>really this league minimum was like a hundred</p>
<p>twenty five thousand</p>
<p>so the worst guy in the nba makes a hundred</p>
<p>twenty five</p>
<p>and that was like ten years ago</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it now i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>leave it on probably</p>
<p>two or three hundred thousand</p>
<p>yeah well they have a</p>
<p>short spirit</p>
<p>period of time</p>
<p>where they can do that that was supposed to</p>
<p>which is the</p>
<p>problem pool is no one&rsquo;s ever figured out how to</p>
<p>organize and put it on tv correctly</p>
<p>you know what i was saying</p>
<p>about watching that chat that chasta speed chas</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like they</p>
<p>should do something like that with pool</p>
<p>because that</p>
<p>speed chess was really</p>
<p>exciting man</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>speed chess was interesting so like speed pool</p>
<p>yeah it would be</p>
<p>a race to 10</p>
<p>but you also have a clock</p>
<p>as soon as the ball</p>
<p>starts moving you have only so long to</p>
<p>yeah yeah george</p>
<p>as soon as he</p>
<p>starts to climb</p>
<p>every game no matter how much time it takes</p>
<p>to get through each rack all that time is calculated</p>
<p>even 10 ball or something but you</p>
<p>would lose a</p>
<p>certain amount once your minutes go you lose</p>
<p>20 balls yeah i think that</p>
<p>some sort of an</p>
<p>added little pressure</p>
<p>thing would be fun for pool</p>
<p>would get people into it</p>
<p>that makes safety shots so much more</p>
<p>powerful pool</p>
<p>is one of those</p>
<p>things though</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only interesting to people that play it</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>to you because you know how to play but to</p>
<p>other people don&rsquo;t know how to play it&rsquo;s just like so</p>
<p>stupid like who gives a shit</p>
<p>if that ball goes in the hole hit it already hit balls</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>games games</p>
<p>scare the shit out of me i&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>giant chunks of my consciousness to games</p>
<p>giant i remember</p>
<p>being in a driver&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ed and they said that there used to be a good</p>
<p>judge of driver&rsquo;s ed</p>
<p>about driving abilities who had the best</p>
<p>grades really</p>
<p>yeah but then they</p>
<p>redid studies and they said that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>oh wow it was way more important than bets of</p>
<p>grades dude there&rsquo;s a guy that</p>
<p>went down to nurburgring</p>
<p>in a race car the nurburgring is a huge</p>
<p>racetrack i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>seven miles numb</p>
<p>it takes a really good race car like</p>
<p>seven minutes</p>
<p>and like i think like</p>
<p>i think like</p>
<p>seven minutes and thirty</p>
<p>seconds is what like the corvette zr1</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a long ass</p>
<p>track and it&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>bunch of crazy</p>
<p>curves and shit</p>
<p>and so um they</p>
<p>they put this on a video game</p>
<p>and so on the</p>
<p>video game you</p>
<p>literally drive</p>
<p>the exact course</p>
<p>and you go through the</p>
<p>exact same lanes that all</p>
<p>the real racetrack car</p>
<p>drivers would</p>
<p>and they have the</p>
<p>exact same like</p>
<p>like background</p>
<p>so when you</p>
<p>do it you feel like you&rsquo;ve already been there</p>
<p>so they had this</p>
<p>kid who was like really good at playing the video game</p>
<p>and they took him on a race car around the nurburgring</p>
<p>and he had like this badass time</p>
<p>like he knew how to do it good</p>
<p>because he was really good at</p>
<p>doing the video game</p>
<p>so they just had to</p>
<p>teach him how to operate a race car</p>
<p>show the fundamental</p>
<p>that he could do it</p>
<p>wait hold on a second</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>exact plot of that</p>
<p>movie from the 80s</p>
<p>where the guys</p>
<p>super good at</p>
<p>video games and then outer</p>
<p>space they come in</p>
<p>yes alex rogan</p>
<p>his name was alex really</p>
<p>what movie was that</p>
<p>star fighter</p>
<p>some shit like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the best of the</p>
<p>video game but the</p>
<p>video game was just an elaborate</p>
<p>test by the</p>
<p>aliens to see who</p>
<p>would who would</p>
<p>fight for them</p>
<p>yeah what was it called star something</p>
<p>yeah and they did a</p>
<p>south park episode of the same</p>
<p>thing really yeah</p>
<p>it was yeah because the</p>
<p>level 99 and</p>
<p>kenny was like the greatest</p>
<p>level and then they thought</p>
<p>good versus evil hell</p>
<p>versus satan wow</p>
<p>well this guy actually did that</p>
<p>this guy actually did go around the nurburgring</p>
<p>and they said he had a</p>
<p>great time he did really really</p>
<p>yeah you did that yeah</p>
<p>he said he knew when to</p>
<p>break and he knew when to</p>
<p>when they accelerate</p>
<p>out of corners</p>
<p>and those games</p>
<p>the physics of</p>
<p>those games are really pretty life like</p>
<p>they make it really the</p>
<p>others with</p>
<p>flight simulators like that yeah</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing tiger was that when we were playing</p>
<p>somebody one of us hit a shot up look like he was</p>
<p>going on the</p>
<p>green perfectly</p>
<p>and like a nice shot and</p>
<p>tigers like nah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna roll off the back of the sand</p>
<p>like no no it&rsquo;s safe as fall on the</p>
<p>front and it</p>
<p>starts to slow down and pick</p>
<p>up a little</p>
<p>steam and rolls off the back of his head</p>
<p>like how&rsquo;d you know that</p>
<p>because because i played that course</p>
<p>like thirty five times</p>
<p>also the course was exactly</p>
<p>just yeah rolls off the back</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing yeah he&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>gotta bounce it up to this</p>
<p>how do they incorporate</p>
<p>those physics into the game well they have professional</p>
<p>or semi like professional level</p>
<p>golfers help design the game</p>
<p>so they go to the courses and make</p>
<p>it like that exactly but how do they know like when</p>
<p>they incorporate gravity like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>steeper hills make the ball roll faster yeah</p>
<p>one rolls off to the right one</p>
<p>bring you know</p>
<p>they try to make it just like the</p>
<p>grain and one day they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to actually recreate the</p>
<p>exact topography</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be crazy yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to recreate the</p>
<p>exact topography</p>
<p>of the course you can play pebble</p>
<p>beach in your</p>
<p>home or in your</p>
<p>local like you know</p>
<p>yeah you have like a club</p>
<p>and the club somehow another has some sort of a</p>
<p>sensor on it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a motion</p>
<p>sensor and the laser tag</p>
<p>place yeah recreate it</p>
<p>every time with</p>
<p>holograms yeah and you do it in like you know in</p>
<p>front of some big screen</p>
<p>i played that golf in or</p>
<p>golf before in</p>
<p>maryland in the winter</p>
<p>you hit a screen they try to</p>
<p>judge the trajectory of the ball but it was real</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re basic</p>
<p>like that and then they tell you</p>
<p>where you are in the</p>
<p>rough what happens to</p>
<p>place your ball either in</p>
<p>rough grass</p>
<p>or in regular</p>
<p>grass which is the fairway</p>
<p>you know or take a</p>
<p>penalty and then on the</p>
<p>green they tell you how</p>
<p>far away from the hole to put it but it was the same</p>
<p>green every time man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m so excited</p>
<p>about what the hell is gonna happen in the future</p>
<p>yeah i mean the future of</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>virtual reality and just</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in such a weird time you know</p>
<p>i mean a couple of hundred years ago you</p>
<p>would live your</p>
<p>whole life and nobody ever invented shit</p>
<p>the things you would go but you go</p>
<p>whole like a no new invention would be created</p>
<p>yeah nothing new yeah</p>
<p>no cottage that happened once a generation</p>
<p>yeah you know or even a bit less and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sure i mean there</p>
<p>might be some things are getting me but the</p>
<p>things that you don&rsquo;t that you know</p>
<p>about things that actually help and affect your life</p>
<p>not that much but now we</p>
<p>have so many of them</p>
<p>in my life in the cell phone</p>
<p>internet internet</p>
<p>computers in general yeah portable computers yeah</p>
<p>all these things</p>
<p>completely change the way we do a cell phone</p>
<p>not even you can&rsquo;t even say cell</p>
<p>phone anymore because now it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>age of the smartphone</p>
<p>this is a bigger leap</p>
<p>then i mean then just a</p>
<p>phone you know a little</p>
<p>thing that you can get information from from the sky</p>
<p>i mean that</p>
<p>the with the cell phone is now like your iphone</p>
<p>right there and the one that we&rsquo;re recording this into</p>
<p>these things are</p>
<p>these are little computers</p>
<p>that connect you to the the rest of the world man</p>
<p>i mean we did this this show in</p>
<p>sydney all through</p>
<p>these iphones man</p>
<p>we tweeted it</p>
<p>we tweeted it and packed up on the iphone</p>
<p>yeah yeah all through the air just walking around</p>
<p>click click click</p>
<p>click click</p>
<p>with no wifi signal i just i just</p>
<p>sent a text</p>
<p>to twitter to put this on and they did yeah man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s i mean this is that&rsquo;s the biggest leap of all time</p>
<p>the the ability to get</p>
<p>google on that and find answers to anything immediately</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>and plus you can record your surroundings</p>
<p>take photos of yourself</p>
<p>listen to music really</p>
<p>same quality</p>
<p>photos yeah and talk to people</p>
<p>and video conference if you&rsquo;re near a wifi signal</p>
<p>i videotaped the kangaroo jerking off yeah</p>
<p>the zoo because of this</p>
<p>technology that</p>
<p>mommy at all times</p>
<p>you need a little</p>
<p>upload that to youtube</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna upload it i guess</p>
<p>i should have done something more clear is he</p>
<p>pretty clear obvious</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s amazing right now</p>
<p>in shazam just the fact that it has shazam on it</p>
<p>it was crazy it doesn&rsquo;t even make sense what</p>
<p>song it is it&rsquo;s playing and it&rsquo;s almost always accurate</p>
<p>wow this is very blatantly</p>
<p>just jerking it</p>
<p>this might get already arrested i</p>
<p>tried to get in this</p>
<p>but then i think he took like an aggressive</p>
<p>stance so i got scared</p>
<p>like here i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you inside this no it&rsquo;s like a walk around area</p>
<p>you can walk nearby</p>
<p>is there a fence in</p>
<p>front of you no it&rsquo;s a wallaby</p>
<p>you can go up to it</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re not supposed to get off the path</p>
<p>you could go</p>
<p>right up to that</p>
<p>thing yeah all</p>
<p>right we&rsquo;ll have to put this on line</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>i got fully scared of the wallaby that&rsquo;s allowed to go</p>
<p>right up to you</p>
<p>you should be scared yeah</p>
<p>the deal is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no social contract</p>
<p>yeah exactly</p>
<p>i erected his jerk off that&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>animals aren&rsquo;t you what happened to the tea</p>
<p>you took it away</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t drink</p>
<p>these i thought maybe you only want one cup</p>
<p>this motherfucker you let him take it how high are you</p>

<p>bunch of people in australia that listen to the podcast</p>
<p>a lot yeah you know i mean</p>
<p>the podcast is</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>exact numbers</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s well over two hundred thousand people</p>

<p>individual one wow yeah</p>
<p>you know and then</p>
<p>in time it goes</p>
<p>more and more and more people download the old ones and</p>

<p>crazy that this can happen</p>
<p>this can happen</p>
<p>you know and then also there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>different ways to listen to it you can get</p>
<p>use this thing called</p>
<p>stitcher you can listen to it</p>
<p>live where we play on you stream and</p>
<p>watch at the same time you can</p>
<p>listen to it by just</p>
<p>downloading the file from my website you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>you put itunes you can just download the raw mp three</p>
<p>and then you know</p>
<p>you put it on anything put on any kind of mp3 player</p>
<p>you know and if</p>
<p>you just keep providing people with something that they</p>
<p>enjoy like that you get a kind of like</p>
<p>you know you get a fan base like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the people that were hanging out with like in</p>
<p>sydney the people came to the shows</p>
<p>we got some cool</p>
<p>motherfuckers that are coming</p>
<p>to the know enough</p>
<p>about you and</p>
<p>about us in general that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re turned</p>
<p>off by the shit we do they won&rsquo;t come out</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>so the people that come out are sort of</p>
<p>your cup of tea</p>
<p>yeah yeah i mean you know everybody&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>their own thing man you know we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>ari and i were talking</p>
<p>about this once like some comedians will get upset at</p>
<p>other comedians like they don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>their act and so they hate them</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>stupid it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what do you give a shit like you don&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>style of comedy</p>
<p>but guess what</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s thirty thousand people</p>
<p>in his audience so you telling me there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong with that yeah</p>
<p>there he&rsquo;s giving them exactly what they like yeah</p>
<p>even kara tom</p>
<p>even guys like</p>
<p>comics or whatever type of</p>
<p>comics like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not your thing</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s okay exactly who the fuck are you to decide</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s good and what&rsquo;s bad you know let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>get it but i got caught up in it</p>
<p>yeah when i was younger for sure i did i did too i</p>
<p>recently let it go and last couple years like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so much better now that you can actually</p>
<p>appreciate the</p>
<p>small things you can relate to in</p>
<p>their ass yes</p>
<p>let me the cable guy on some interview wants on like</p>
<p>leno or one of</p>
<p>those he said</p>
<p>having sex with his pregnant wife was like</p>
<p>was like um</p>
<p>jabbing he said</p>
<p>jabbing taking a</p>
<p>stick and jabbing a</p>
<p>stack full of puppies</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>funny joke and if you just</p>
<p>dismiss everything he says and you miss out on</p>
<p>a little joy of life i don&rsquo;t dismiss him at all i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>you know i was telling you i hung out with him very</p>
<p>briefly way back in like shit like ninety</p>
<p>four or ninety five at the montreal comedy festival</p>
<p>we hung out the comedy works</p>
<p>and this is back when</p>
<p>larry was you know just another</p>
<p>comic that very few people knew who he was you know</p>
<p>he was living as a</p>
<p>cable guy another</p>
<p>is what is it dan whitney is that his real name</p>
<p>oh you still</p>
<p>going the old</p>
<p>no he was the</p>
<p>larry the cable guy there</p>
<p>you know he was he was doing</p>
<p>larry the cable guy</p>
<p>but you know people like they like take</p>
<p>offense to that or you know some people</p>
<p>judge it i don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not my you know</p>
<p>it might not be my favorite kind of comedy but i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>yeah he makes me laugh</p>
<p>it makes me laugh a</p>
<p>bunch you just let go yeah</p>
<p>hey i&rsquo;m supposed</p>
<p>to like this i&rsquo;m not supposed to like that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know like there&rsquo;s all sorts of different</p>
<p>levels of everything</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>mcdonald&rsquo;s cheeseburgers you</p>
<p>might not be</p>
<p>into it but obviously a lot of fucking yeah</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say oh that&rsquo;s terrible really</p>
<p>why is everyone eating it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i think</p>
<p>about republicans</p>
<p>really they have no</p>
<p>they have no basis to</p>
<p>stand on i don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about politics but if they have no basis to</p>
<p>stand on why is</p>
<p>fifty percent of the country a republican</p>
<p>yeah well that&rsquo;s an interesting way to</p>
<p>look at i think</p>
<p>there must be something</p>
<p>valid people i think</p>
<p>it is a good percentage of the time</p>
<p>when people choose whether or not they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be a republican</p>
<p>or a liberal</p>
<p>conservative or democrat they</p>
<p>i think they find</p>
<p>a pattern of</p>
<p>thinking and then they just</p>
<p>stick to it</p>
<p>you chevy ford</p>
<p>seems just so dumb</p>
<p>and i think that&rsquo;s responsible for a lot of it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of it</p>
<p>team concept</p>
<p>i want to pick a side</p>
<p>to it no matter what</p>
<p>every time yeah and then they you know and then you</p>
<p>especially if like</p>
<p>one of the best</p>
<p>things the republican</p>
<p>party it does</p>
<p>is that they</p>
<p>they really promote this idea of a united</p>
<p>front against</p>
<p>the dumb liberals the weak</p>
<p>liberals those</p>
<p>liberals out there they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take away your money</p>
<p>and they propose</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re in on this like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a team like when</p>
<p>people call the rush limbo show mega dittos rush</p>
<p>met at mega dittos meaning ditto meaning you i</p>
<p>guess you like you</p>
<p>we agree what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying i</p>
<p>guess that&rsquo;s what it means</p>
<p>they call themselves ditto heads</p>
<p>you know i mean they just</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re into rush</p>
<p>and yeah they want to</p>
<p>smoke the same</p>
<p>cigars that rush smokes</p>
<p>and they want to call up and</p>
<p>agree with him</p>
<p>and they want</p>
<p>and they want to</p>
<p>you know they want to suck republican cock that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they used to be</p>
<p>if you were republican i just thought</p>
<p>you agree with</p>
<p>eight or nine out of ten</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>other republicans agree with</p>
<p>yeah as opposed to two out of ten</p>
<p>things other publicly</p>
<p>agree with yeah</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a democrat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being a fanboy it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>your fanboy of anything else it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>going to see star wars</p>
<p>thirteen times because you&rsquo;re ten</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s the same goddamn</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous behavior</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so common you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people out there that firmly believe it</p>
<p>these lips are</p>
<p>gonna do this</p>
<p>but then you know</p>
<p>if you look at this</p>
<p>their point</p>
<p>of view when it comes to politics when it comes to</p>
<p>taxes and creating</p>
<p>big government and</p>
<p>everything like yeah man i yeah i</p>
<p>agree they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>spending too much fucking</p>
<p>money i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the balance</p>
<p>going the right way</p>
<p>in what i understand and i</p>
<p>clearly know nothing</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ll tell you this that i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that there was</p>
<p>any reason i told this before</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>reason we shouldn&rsquo;t have universal health care</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i always thought and people who are</p>
<p>against it were like retarded</p>
<p>and now my health care is worse</p>
<p>and it costs more</p>
<p>because of obamacare</p>
<p>and i was like oh that&rsquo;s the give and take that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>both sides have a</p>
<p>valid argument</p>
<p>the problem with</p>
<p>universal health care is that doctors get fucked over</p>
<p>you know doctors</p>
<p>get fucked over already by a lot of insurance companies</p>
<p>a lot of insurance companies don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna pay what a doctor wants to be paid for</p>
<p>you know certain</p>
<p>procedures and when they get to be really good</p>
<p>psychologist won&rsquo;t take uh</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t take insurance</p>
<p>why would i</p>
<p>build out a hundred dollars</p>
<p>for the insurance company when i can</p>
<p>build out a 300</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m worth wow</p>
<p>so when you go to a</p>
<p>psychiatrist or a</p>
<p>psychologist you have to pay them</p>
<p>out of your pocket</p>
<p>certain ones certain ones are</p>
<p>insurance and the best ones are just not on insurance</p>
<p>i am all for people being competitive i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s good i</p>
<p>think i want the doctor who&rsquo;s the baddest</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>who drives a ferrari</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s the one who can</p>
<p>fix your fucking</p>
<p>brain tumor that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>guy you want you want this bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>want this dude is like intensely devoted to his craft</p>
<p>because he he</p>
<p>makes a lot of fucking</p>
<p>money from it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of reward and so there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>reason for him to go chase</p>
<p>after and be</p>
<p>the best surgeon you have a life there that i</p>
<p>heard once i like but you were telling a</p>
<p>somebody about a bit</p>
<p>different vaporizers</p>
<p>one of your friends was like trying to buy a vaporizer</p>
<p>and he was like which one and you were like</p>
<p>the way you told sir i was like go with the broken</p>
<p>school thought</p>
<p>just get the more expensive one yeah it&rsquo;s always better</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost always better</p>
<p>nine point nine out of ten</p>
<p>better so just</p>
<p>i use that for almost</p>
<p>everything yeah</p>
<p>you have the</p>
<p>money to do it go with the better one</p>
<p>yeah the one that cost the most is usually the best the</p>
<p>reason why you go the same</p>
<p>prices for jessica ronaldi</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>why do you think for jessica</p>
<p>cost more yeah</p>
<p>it tastes better yeah don&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>stupid might be</p>
<p>worth a difference but yeah</p>
<p>it is better it&rsquo;s better yeah yeah</p>
<p>the ferrari</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t cost</p>
<p>a quarter of a million dollars because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>piece of bread</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>reason why people are willing to buy that goddamn thing</p>
<p>greatest car ever invented you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s something to that now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many certain amount of</p>
<p>things you can think</p>
<p>about in this life</p>
<p>you have to have some methods to</p>
<p>deal with things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my method</p>
<p>try to get whatever it is get the best one</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be don&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>stupid yeah</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t understand people use windows</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t you know that shit</p>
<p>people yeah</p>
<p>windows grown</p>
<p>i can build my own computer</p>
<p>i can i can upgrade if i like i</p>
<p>understand i</p>
<p>understand all that</p>
<p>maybe you do all that and i</p>
<p>appreciate that and i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>but you can get a virus</p>
<p>and viruses are fucking terrible</p>
<p>could you imagine if it&rsquo;s like no man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna stay a</p>
<p>human i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna eat acidophilus and a lot of</p>
<p>wheat grass juice and</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about this dark</p>
<p>black plague</p>
<p>or you know you can take this pill and be immortal</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna stick with it</p>
<p>stick with this</p>
<p>fighting all</p>
<p>virus on the plane yeah</p>
<p>people have windows</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re being attacked every day</p>
<p>for a while you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even go to websites</p>
<p>you go to websites and</p>
<p>big windows popeye and people</p>
<p>right now are</p>
<p>freaking out people are angry</p>
<p>fucking max</p>
<p>you max and</p>
<p>for the people who were like i was</p>
<p>seven or eight years ago we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>this is a new</p>
<p>system i can&rsquo;t figure it out</p>
<p>you will get it</p>
<p>within a week or two</p>
<p>you will totally</p>
<p>figure it out of regular use if you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>idiot it&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be just as easy as</p>
<p>this you know but some</p>
<p>people are really into like hacking the registry and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really into</p>
<p>building their own</p>
<p>things i totally</p>
<p>get that i totally get that such a spot</p>
<p>slice the real</p>
<p>the real option for</p>
<p>those people is linux</p>
<p>real option is linux or unix</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s you know there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s operating</p>
<p>systems that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>virus infested</p>
<p>punk shit and they&rsquo;re free</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a lot of linux</p>
<p>now a lot of different building</p>
<p>that are available online for free</p>
<p>that are really good man they have a</p>
<p>great graphic interface</p>
<p>they have video players</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few compatibility issues with something</p>
<p>yeah that to me</p>
<p>makes way more</p>
<p>sense than windows</p>
<p>windows i mean</p>
<p>i get it there&rsquo;s a lot of peripherals that work with it</p>
<p>and a lot of people have just</p>
<p>grown up with it and used to it but</p>
<p>viruses are so</p>
<p>stupid so horrible</p>
<p>suddenly my computers working</p>
<p>worse cause i&rsquo;m asshole</p>
<p>pranked me yeah exactly what evidence of cunts</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>if you ever want evidence of people are cunts</p>
<p>the number of</p>
<p>viruses that</p>
<p>exist are staggering</p>
<p>yeah for windows</p>
<p>there must be hundreds of thousands it&rsquo;s not like the</p>
<p>virus that drains your bank</p>
<p>account and goes to some guy in russia it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>virus that fucks you up yeah</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do anything for anyone yeah</p>
<p>and i asked somebody once like why do they</p>
<p>build those</p>
<p>viruses people</p>
<p>like mayhem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it this one</p>
<p>create man you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like if there&rsquo;s a room and it was like a</p>
<p>round circle</p>
<p>where women just put</p>
<p>most of their face</p>
<p>through and you can&rsquo;t see who&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>other side and the</p>
<p>other side is all men that are naked it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a few that&rsquo;ll just jerk off on someone&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>they just they just want to</p>
<p>be able to affect you and you not know that it&rsquo;s them</p>
<p>you know you know i mean</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s people that want to</p>
<p>reach out and</p>
<p>jizz on you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they want to do</p>
<p>they can find a way to just</p>
<p>whack one off on your face and you</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t stop them and you didn&rsquo;t know it was them they</p>
<p>would do it</p>
<p>they would do it just to look at it</p>
<p>people were sick</p>
<p>they twisted</p>
<p>i have a rule of</p>
<p>pranks because i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t thought out</p>
<p>theory on them you know and the rules are this no</p>
<p>no monetary damage to anyone</p>
<p>and no physical damage to anyone</p>
<p>those are good</p>
<p>except yourself</p>
<p>those are good you</p>
<p>can put out a thousand dollars a ball</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t make someone else pay too much yeah</p>
<p>those are good rules yeah</p>
<p>because other than that</p>
<p>butts hurt that&rsquo;s it and you have to only</p>
<p>prank people that you actually like to you can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>pranking you can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>pranking someone you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like because then that&rsquo;s like sort of an act of war huh</p>
<p>you know it has to be like an act of</p>
<p>fun yeah because if you don&rsquo;t like someone and then you</p>
<p>prank them that&rsquo;s like your you just stepped it up</p>
<p>you know we once had</p>
<p>we got like</p>
<p>12 15 people</p>
<p>to wait for bobby lee</p>
<p>to pull into the parking</p>
<p>store parking lot at the comedy store</p>
<p>with on top of the roof</p>
<p>on the hyatt ramp</p>
<p>behind the garbage cans</p>
<p>all waiting and</p>
<p>choreographics hanging out with</p>
<p>water balloons</p>
<p>oh no yeah just waiting for all filling out this is</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>right now okay</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a 10 15 spot he will be here at 9 45</p>
<p>and it is go time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious and we all just unloaded</p>
<p>water balloons at him</p>
<p>oh my god that&rsquo;s hilarious it</p>
<p>was so epic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s epic</p>
<p>and the only</p>
<p>thing better was that not one of us hit him</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like eighty</p>
<p>balloons and not one person hit him that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>dude did you were you there when</p>
<p>some guys got on the roof of the</p>
<p>store with a slingshot</p>
<p>was not there</p>
<p>they had like this sort of a</p>
<p>water balloon launching device yeah capital</p>
<p>had it some</p>
<p>slingshot type deal</p>
<p>and they were hurling</p>
<p>him over towards the</p>
<p>standards and hitting the bounce it was</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>when you get hit by a</p>
<p>water balloon</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that ever happens to you yeah</p>
<p>first like what</p>
<p>like okay my mind is</p>
<p>wrapping around its water</p>
<p>right and you&rsquo;re like that was</p>
<p>water balloon</p>
<p>you get that within a</p>
<p>second or two</p>
<p>right and then you look</p>
<p>where the water balloon come from without</p>
<p>thinking this out it&rsquo;s instant</p>
<p>people like within</p>
<p>four or five feet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>water balloons come from</p>
<p>ten feet maybe</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think a hundred yards</p>
<p>up on some roof</p>
<p>across the street</p>
<p>down the block</p>
<p>no one would even consider that they</p>
<p>found out that it was</p>
<p>coming from the rooftop so the cops did come and visit</p>
<p>you know someone</p>
<p>you water balloons in a fucking straight line</p>
<p>straight back pointing</p>
<p>and the roof as</p>
<p>they adjusted for for</p>
<p>yeah accuracy</p>
<p>yeah they nailed somebody i remember they</p>
<p>hit somebody it was like a big fucking event everybody</p>
<p>came running down up</p>
<p>to the bar yeah</p>
<p>cops ran up</p>
<p>as they see</p>
<p>in caprollo</p>
<p>and i think freddy lockhart</p>
<p>and they had to hide</p>
<p>where mitsy&rsquo;s office was</p>
<p>fuck quick come down here i hear footsteps</p>
<p>they did not</p>
<p>think cops ran</p>
<p>by them and they ran the rest</p>
<p>of the way out</p>
<p>that was i remember those</p>
<p>we did the combat</p>
<p>is easy they had it on the roof</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s not say it was</p>
<p>right as easy</p>
<p>because we might not</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>we did it we all did it in la hoya</p>
<p>once in the condo</p>
<p>and it would go i don&rsquo;t remember that</p>
<p>place at all yeah go over the boardwalk</p>
<p>halfway to the</p>
<p>ocean on the</p>
<p>beach oh my god it</p>
<p>would blow up like a land mine</p>
<p>people sitting there</p>
<p>would go in the sand</p>
<p>you see them</p>
<p>kind of like looking around like what was that</p>
<p>and then another one</p>
<p>would boom oh that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s some terrorism shit though i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s probably in the</p>
<p>patriot act</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not</p>
<p>allowed to do</p>
<p>that anymore</p>
<p>oh probably not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a guy calling</p>
<p>you would have one guy pulling it back</p>
<p>right as hard as he can and two</p>
<p>other guys on either side</p>
<p>straight out with the arms</p>
<p>bracing and shaking holding it</p>
<p>steady oh that&rsquo;s how you</p>
<p>do rubber thing one guy like this</p>
<p>the other guy on the</p>
<p>other side so you use your arms as the</p>
<p>your arms are like the</p>
<p>sticks like the</p>
<p>one guy would be your fingers pulling back</p>
<p>pull back as hard as you can</p>
<p>why not make something instead of that</p>
<p>that works why not</p>
<p>like have like a bow</p>
<p>like some sort of a</p>
<p>something yeah they</p>
<p>wash it for you yeah do like</p>
<p>something is</p>
<p>sticking the dirt</p>

<p>by the way this is all alleged</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>yeah we have one nice guy we have no documentation</p>

<p>those old school guys that</p>
<p>were around like barry diamond was in that bachelor</p>

<p>any friend of mine getting a part like that in a comedy</p>
<p>movie yeah that&rsquo;d be pretty</p>
<p>impressive how the hell does he not get more movies</p>
<p>maybe at the wrong management or something</p>
<p>weird business huh show business is so strange</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best when you just concentrate just on</p>
<p>stand up that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things i love</p>
<p>about stand up</p>
<p>i could just</p>
<p>have to worry</p>
<p>about all these</p>
<p>other variables all</p>
<p>these other people</p>
<p>just concentrate on my own shit</p>
<p>just working on my own thing</p>
<p>going up there busting</p>
<p>it out improving it writing new shit</p>
<p>putting it on a dvd</p>
<p>and then repeat the process</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s to me like the</p>
<p>the most satisfying form of</p>
<p>show business yeah</p>
<p>the work part of it is handled by your agency managers</p>
<p>like yeah how much was my</p>
<p>quote for this</p>
<p>place whatever</p>
<p>but the part of it you have to deal with the</p>
<p>stuff you want to deal with yeah it&rsquo;s fun it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exciting yeah</p>
<p>thank you it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exciting to come up with new shit man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exciting to put together a new special</p>
<p>improve a bit</p>
<p>thank you very much</p>
<p>you got some water bitches</p>
<p>first class they just come around and give you</p>
<p>still water they just come around</p>
<p>by the way ari and i are sitting together in</p>
<p>ari&rsquo;s little cubicle my pod</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing a podcast</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pod podcast</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re on qantas</p>
<p>and they have these pods man they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking delicious</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a lot of room there&rsquo;s two seats in it</p>
<p>everybody gets two windows or</p>
<p>two three really three</p>
<p>out the window and then you have</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how much</p>
<p>space it is like lengthwise you have this bed</p>
<p>chair that turns into a bed full</p>
<p>a bunch of movies on a big</p>
<p>screen so i</p>
<p>got a tv that it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>like a little</p>
<p>headrest type deal you have your own tv it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the tv used to have in college yeah it&rsquo;s like as</p>
<p>good as that or a little bit better it&rsquo;s probably like</p>
<p>twenty inches right</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that that thing</p>
<p>seventeen inches that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everything is bigger than that yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bigger</p>
<p>than that so it&rsquo;s pretty and you</p>
<p>could push a button that&rsquo;ll go away</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing back</p>
<p>amazing shit</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re flying</p>
<p>over the surface of the planet</p>
<p>thirty thousand feet over the ocean</p>
<p>the entire trip is</p>
<p>taken over the ocean</p>
<p>if anything goes</p>
<p>wrong you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>completely totally fucked</p>
<p>there is no emergency</p>
<p>landing it&rsquo;s not happening</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve escaped patches for</p>
<p>first class</p>
<p>with that twelve</p>
<p>hours over the</p>
<p>ocean in the air oh</p>
<p>how odd over</p>
<p>the over the</p>
<p>ocean nothing</p>
<p>around how odd</p>
<p>how odd is this that we can do this</p>
<p>super casual</p>
<p>yeah man this is</p>
<p>some revolutionary</p>
<p>human thing that we&rsquo;re experiencing here</p>
<p>you know this has only been around for a hundred years</p>
<p>you know this is this is a blank</p>
<p>not even a blink in</p>
<p>human history which is</p>
<p>a blank in the</p>
<p>we already have a plan but it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s gone to</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re pretty goddamn slick now</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s amazing how efficient they are</p>
<p>and how how</p>
<p>they can keep</p>
<p>using them over and over and over</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s retired</p>
<p>the discovery of challenger</p>
<p>which i wanted to blow up</p>
<p>challenge challenger</p>
<p>that did not blow up</p>
<p>challenger blew up</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember discovery is the new one i</p>
<p>think okay who&rsquo;s the yeah</p>
<p>but one they just retired they have a couple of them</p>
<p>right where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been in business for 30 years</p>
<p>yeah it works</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some new studies that they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re considering the possibility of</p>
<p>an error or an</p>
<p>eccentricity in the moon&rsquo;s orbit</p>
<p>that they attribute to</p>
<p>a large planet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s outside of pluto they</p>
<p>know this is something that&rsquo;s being considered i</p>
<p>think it was at cornell</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a pretty serious planet yeah</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s not just this there&rsquo;s a bunch of different</p>
<p>things that are pointing towards</p>
<p>a huge object</p>
<p>outside of pluto</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s four times the size of jupiter</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absolutely enormous</p>
<p>and this is another finding</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of a couple that they&rsquo;ve come through with</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re calculating</p>
<p>that there is something out there</p>
<p>you know so this is like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a theory they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite totally decided on like a lot you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still some debate on it</p>
<p>but there seems to be several different things are</p>
<p>pointing towards it</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know what it is but there</p>
<p>it could be</p>
<p>you know just some</p>
<p>enormous gas giant you know</p>
<p>be who else could be like</p>
<p>a star that we can&rsquo;t see like one of those dwarf stars</p>
<p>like what are</p>
<p>there stars that you can&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>is there stars that you can&rsquo;t see with the naked eye</p>
<p>the naked eye yeah</p>
<p>i mean like a type of star</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know enough</p>
<p>about yeah i don&rsquo;t know enough</p>
<p>about that but i&rsquo;ve heard that</p>
<p>some stars like literally can be hidden</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>would have to be like really really far away and hidden</p>
<p>like maybe that&rsquo;s a star that&rsquo;s burnt out</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah could be i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about something that&rsquo;s so far outside of our</p>
<p>solar system it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s i think further outside of</p>
<p>pluto than pluto is to us</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really far</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really big whatever it is</p>
<p>i mean have you ever looked at one of those</p>
<p>really cool</p>
<p>youtube clips where they show you like the size of</p>
<p>the sun and the size</p>
<p>of earth and then the size of</p>
<p>a bigger sun</p>
<p>and a much bigger sun and a much</p>
<p>bigger star</p>
<p>and then around</p>
<p>giant giant</p>
<p>galaxies where they have these</p>
<p>huge you know</p>
<p>i forget the terminology for the stars but enormous</p>
<p>white and red stars that are like</p>
<p>thousands and thousands of times bigger than our stars</p>
<p>enormous monstrous stars</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you try to wrap your fucking head around going like wow</p>
<p>what how big is this</p>
<p>thing i mean how big does it get how many how many of</p>
<p>these are really</p>
<p>giant enormous things there&rsquo;s something to wrap it</p>
<p>around infiniti</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like a fake it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>trying to wrap your head around the universe is like</p>
<p>trying to pick up the</p>
<p>ocean with your hands</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like okay so we have a god</p>
<p>then what then what</p>
<p>like then another</p>
<p>thing then another</p>
<p>thing another universe it&rsquo;s like yeah then what</p>
<p>it does end like no it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t end it&rsquo;s too crazy yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an amazing</p>
<p>thing man that we are</p>
<p>flying through</p>
<p>space that we are in</p>
<p>space right now</p>
<p>space is above our head</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an amazing</p>
<p>thing that gets so little attention</p>
<p>you know if it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden it did</p>
<p>it would be the craziest thing ever</p>
<p>if all of a sudden</p>
<p>above us was infinity</p>
<p>like out of nowhere</p>
<p>the roof came off</p>
<p>and we could see infinity</p>
<p>be freaking out all the time</p>
<p>just the idea that there&rsquo;s enough</p>
<p>nothing from</p>
<p>your head straight up through</p>
<p>to forever just go straight</p>
<p>you know like that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even make</p>
<p>sense it&rsquo;s almost impossible</p>
<p>to think about that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost impossible to put</p>
<p>every direction</p>
<p>every infinite direction</p>
<p>just keeps going so really this big planet outside of</p>
<p>pluto ain&rsquo;t shit</p>
<p>really no big deal you know in</p>
<p>comparison to all the other</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>you know why</p>
<p>would you be</p>
<p>surprised if there&rsquo;s a big planet out there but</p>
<p>for a lot of people it seems</p>
<p>preposterous</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s people that</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t want to believe that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know anything weird</p>
<p>is any life</p>
<p>that is has a sun</p>
<p>you know with</p>
<p>their own star</p>
<p>and orbits you know with like the same</p>
<p>solar systems like we have</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s super</p>
<p>small she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>their earth</p>
<p>their whatever version of</p>
<p>earth is probably way closer to</p>
<p>their stars so much</p>
<p>smaller but</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>three four five inches tall</p>
<p>wow this little tiny planet because if you</p>
<p>think that that</p>
<p>might be a huge planet with bigger people on it</p>
<p>how small could a planet</p>
<p>get and still be a planet though because pluto</p>
<p>was really tiny</p>
<p>and they stopped making it a planet</p>
<p>or they stopped designating it as a planet it&rsquo;s now</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s now like a</p>
<p>kuiper belt</p>
<p>object pluto&rsquo;s not a planet it was all ice</p>
<p>yeah i think pluto</p>
<p>well i know</p>
<p>pluto is a regularly shaped</p>
<p>i think pluto like almost is like</p>
<p>an asteroid you know almost is like you know</p>
<p>giant asteroid</p>
<p>look at the kuiper belt is a belt of</p>
<p>large objects and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one of them that they</p>
<p>found that was</p>
<p>three quarters of the size of</p>
<p>pluto that&rsquo;s just outside of pluto</p>
<p>right before they decide the</p>
<p>pluto&rsquo;s on a planet anyone</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a lot of debate back and forth</p>
<p>it was a fairly recent decision that they made to stop</p>
<p>you know having</p>
<p>pluto as a planet</p>
<p>and the reason why they</p>
<p>made it is like man we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to name a hundred planets</p>
<p>right gang of</p>
<p>pluto&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>so what it is is like</p>
<p>what pluto is is</p>
<p>like one of the outer edges when an outer kuiper belt</p>
<p>objects and then</p>
<p>since then they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>identified a</p>
<p>bunch of kuiper belt objects</p>
<p>but from what i</p>
<p>understand one of the</p>
<p>first reasons why they suspected that something with</p>
<p>a large amount of mass</p>
<p>was way outside of pluto</p>
<p>because all</p>
<p>these objects</p>
<p>that it gets to a certain</p>
<p>point in it it unnaturally drops off i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s called the galactic shelf</p>
<p>and what they were saying is that you</p>
<p>know the most likely</p>
<p>reason for that to happen is something really big</p>
<p>outside of it with a lot of mass</p>
<p>so something&rsquo;s flying around out there</p>
<p>wow you know</p>
<p>but that should really surprise us</p>
<p>when we look at all those</p>
<p>you know you look at</p>
<p>half a shit that you see in the sky is there&rsquo;s stars i</p>
<p>mean not half a ship but there&rsquo;s stars and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even other galaxies out there it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>could look into the you know look into the</p>
<p>milky way and see</p>
<p>i mean how many stars if you&rsquo;re in a country road</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re in some</p>
<p>place doesn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>light pollution</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;re just clustered and it</p>
<p>literally does look like milk</p>
<p>and each one of them</p>
<p>could have planets around it</p>
<p>most of them do</p>
<p>right don&rsquo;t most stars have planets</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i think they do</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>identified so many planets now</p>
<p>the idea that</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>this is the only one that has something like us</p>
<p>seems pretty silly</p>
<p>yeah remember they released that um</p>
<p>telescope but the one they sent out</p>
<p>sick pictures like venus and</p>
<p>mars it was</p>
<p>gonna hit like five or six of the planets over</p>
<p>a hundred years</p>
<p>voyager okay and eventually</p>
<p>get i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get near</p>
<p>pluto or not but yeah</p>
<p>send back pictures anymore</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but in that</p>
<p>in that ship</p>
<p>these are all</p>
<p>scientists and regular people they included</p>
<p>stuff about human</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>humans in their makeup because they</p>
<p>actually made a gold plate yeah</p>
<p>had drawings on it of the</p>
<p>shape of men</p>
<p>at some point they have to think</p>
<p>guys let&rsquo;s be honest it&rsquo;s possible yeah let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just in case let&rsquo;s put some</p>
<p>stuff about us</p>
<p>yeah exactly they had a diagram we</p>
<p>do what planet</p>
<p>we came from in a relationship there&rsquo;s no reason</p>
<p>to do that if you don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>alone it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s really interesting is that the way they</p>
<p>wrote it out you know it really looks like</p>
<p>something it&rsquo;s really cool</p>
<p>like a drawing of a man and</p>
<p>woman very simple you know</p>
<p>circles that represent the planet</p>
<p>the showing</p>
<p>which planet it came from</p>
<p>and really almost like hieroglyphs it&rsquo;s really not bad</p>
<p>i guess it kind of is a</p>
<p>hieroglyphs yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this is the</p>
<p>simplest most mathematical</p>
<p>way we can tell</p>
<p>other grace</p>
<p>about us imagine if we really were the only</p>
<p>things in the universe though that&rsquo;s a real mindful</p>
<p>can you imagine if this life</p>
<p>thing is just a real</p>
<p>weird aberration</p>
<p>30 000 years somebody just comes across that</p>
<p>voyager i was like wait</p>
<p>we found it</p>
<p>would be some</p>
<p>great discovery</p>
<p>like a titanic</p>
<p>what if it is</p>
<p>what if it really is that</p>
<p>human beings like</p>
<p>that we really are</p>
<p>only on this planet and we really do only exist</p>
<p>to facilitate the invention of</p>
<p>some sort of a</p>
<p>crazy universe ending device</p>
<p>like the the</p>
<p>the next stage of the</p>
<p>large hadron</p>
<p>glider or some new type of atomic</p>
<p>power that just</p>
<p>literally blows a hole</p>
<p>for the universe</p>
<p>i mean what if that really is what people here for</p>
<p>what we really do</p>
<p>have some weird</p>
<p>almost parasitic</p>
<p>or symbiotic relationship to computers and</p>
<p>technology once</p>
<p>you get into</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for that</p>
<p>sounds like fate</p>
<p>yeah but i can</p>
<p>say what if that&rsquo;s our inevitable outcome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one way of looking at it but i mean when you look at</p>
<p>a caterpillar</p>
<p>and what is it here for</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s here to become a butterfly</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s inevitable fate it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s here for it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to become</p>
<p>a butterfly and then what&rsquo;s a butterfly here for</p>
<p>i probably to be a part of this</p>
<p>huge mathematical program that is life</p>
<p>that incorporates wind and</p>
<p>moisture and</p>
<p>lightning bugs and</p>
<p>dogs and cats and</p>
<p>all these different events happening</p>
<p>all interconnected millions of events</p>
<p>every minute</p>
<p>constantly interacting with each other</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>a butterfly is</p>
<p>what a butterfly is is a part of this gigantic system</p>
<p>you know what i mean it&rsquo;s no more no less</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>what is the significance of its</p>
<p>place i don&rsquo;t know but it seems like</p>
<p>everything is connected in that way</p>
<p>everything is so</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re doing for</p>
<p>sure is making crazier and crazier shit all the time</p>
<p>you know me you and i were so fascinated</p>
<p>that this podcast was saved</p>
<p>because of the iphone crashed</p>
<p>and we just booted up to my laptop and it</p>
<p>saved it on the laptop me we were</p>
<p>that we are compelled</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re drawn to the newest</p>
<p>greatest shit like oh cool and that does this oh cool</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like your</p>
<p>brain is rewarded with that</p>
<p>you know like we were talking</p>
<p>about virtual reality and</p>
<p>video games you know that are so</p>
<p>immersive and that are more</p>
<p>exciting than real life it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being rewarded by making</p>
<p>the more you support</p>
<p>these things like getting better</p>
<p>the more you purchase them</p>
<p>which more drives the</p>
<p>market drives</p>
<p>innovation that&rsquo;s how drugs are</p>
<p>exactly it is like a drug</p>
<p>is it like will like viagra</p>
<p>like anything it&rsquo;s like how much</p>
<p>money can we get out of this yes</p>
<p>how much money will get towards research yes exactly no</p>
<p>yeah of course yeah</p>
<p>anything high</p>
<p>blood pressure</p>
<p>drugs that&rsquo;s all we can get a lot of</p>
<p>money for this yeah</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s researcher</p>
<p>yeah get something</p>
<p>so video games the same way they do way more business</p>
<p>than the movies</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>now now they&rsquo;re through the roof</p>
<p>you know i mean now it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re on epic</p>
<p>levels man you know</p>
<p>games like call of duty</p>
<p>they just they</p>
<p>do like hundreds of millions of dollars you know</p>
<p>constantly selling</p>
<p>thousands and millions of</p>
<p>copies man it&rsquo;s just incredible</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t know how many</p>
<p>copies they sold</p>
<p>worldwide but i mean everybody plays call of duty</p>
<p>it has to be millions</p>
<p>it must be millions of people</p>
<p>yeah it must be</p>
<p>no doubt about it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s certain games that are just like mad and</p>
<p>everybody talks</p>
<p>about playing mad and</p>
<p>become people were just</p>
<p>goddamn fucking episodes is that so or</p>
<p>copies is that so</p>
<p>must be fucking millions</p>
<p>every year that comes to new one yeah</p>
<p>get people against what we&rsquo;re doing with the ufc game</p>
<p>every year yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m working on that thing oh i put in</p>
<p>some fucking long days dude</p>
<p>doing commentary for that thing doing a</p>
<p>lot of commentary</p>
<p>yeah like i do it sometimes so</p>
<p>i can only do it for like four</p>
<p>hours and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so intense you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like so you&rsquo;re so pushing and you</p>
<p>see where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>mostly down time</p>
<p>right well the</p>
<p>ufc you know sometimes nothing&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>this is like if action was happening constantly</p>
<p>every minute for four hours</p>
<p>that never happens on the ufc</p>
<p>you know the ufc there&rsquo;s a lot of time</p>
<p>where guys are moving around nothing&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>you know there know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about what this guy needs</p>
<p>to do what that guy needs to do you play that game</p>
<p>i played a couple times</p>
<p>you got go to the ground or not</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;ve got to</p>
<p>learn the ground</p>
<p>no idea what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on and i&rsquo;m scared of it</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m scared all</p>
<p>video games</p>

<p>state the achieve</p>
<p>that even yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>to me beneficial</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>it is not just hurt your body</p>
<p>both video games gets me a</p>
<p>crazy like i remember</p>
<p>walking away from quake</p>
<p>my heart&rsquo;s pounding</p>
<p>you know my hands are</p>
<p>sleeping you play you</p>
<p>can be like i&rsquo;ll play one more hour then i&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>sleep like no i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sleeping after that level</p>
<p>yeah so much fun man</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re only getting more and more</p>
<p>fun and they&rsquo;re only getting more and more immersive</p>
<p>the ground is</p>
<p>really from the</p>
<p>fighters they say the ground is like</p>
<p>really sort of realistic once you get the hang of it</p>
<p>wow gents pulled</p>
<p>i did an interview for something for</p>
<p>when they put out i</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re too yeah</p>
<p>so i did interview people outside a</p>
<p>strike force event</p>
<p>new york city&rsquo;s like fuck you or</p>
<p>photobombing your</p>
<p>shit oh yes</p>
<p>ask you about it</p>
<p>so i asked jens bulver</p>
<p>about it he was there</p>
<p>and he was like yeah i was playing and</p>
<p>you know i took people down i</p>
<p>would really get all my friends like yeah</p>
<p>definitely have done this more in real life too yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good at this that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny yeah that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>yeah jen&rsquo;s palmers are</p>
<p>real veteran</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys that got into that</p>
<p>habit of banging with guys you know</p>
<p>standing and banging and making the</p>
<p>fights exciting for the fans you know yeah</p>
<p>he had a real</p>
<p>safety first</p>
<p>style and then he got criticized for it and they</p>
<p>changed the</p>
<p>style became a</p>
<p>champion lightweight</p>
<p>lightweight yeah</p>
<p>lightweight</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe it was called</p>
<p>lightweight back then though</p>
<p>i think one</p>
<p>fifty five at one</p>
<p>point in time i</p>
<p>think they called it the panama</p>
<p>championship or</p>
<p>one at a time</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve got i need to go look at that i</p>
<p>might be talking out of my ass but i do</p>
<p>think that the names were different</p>
<p>i think the</p>
<p>lightweight</p>
<p>championship was one</p>
<p>seventy and one time like when pat militage</p>
<p>first won the one seventy</p>
<p>title i&rsquo;m pretty sure it was called</p>
<p>lightweight</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>do they go back and change those</p>
<p>when somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like for all time stats it&rsquo;s like who&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first lightweight champion</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get well i</p>
<p>think by the time</p>
<p>jens palver want it i</p>
<p>think it was</p>
<p>lightweight</p>
<p>yeah i think it was</p>
<p>lightweight</p>
<p>back then he i</p>
<p>think he was the</p>
<p>first ufc lightweight</p>
<p>champion though</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m really this is</p>
<p>sad usually i&rsquo;m pretty good at this stuff</p>
<p>but for whatever reason</p>
<p>but he was one of the guys yeah well we&rsquo;re tired too</p>
<p>but he was gents was one of the guys that was</p>
<p>first that was really good with his hands</p>
<p>he is a really good boxer even had some pro boxing</p>
<p>fights oh really yeah he had some he was</p>
<p>little guys those</p>
<p>pioneer guys like from from that era</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>boy those guys really blazed a</p>
<p>trail there</p>
<p>was nothing before them you know there was like</p>
<p>a few guys that</p>
<p>entered into the</p>
<p>sport like by the time</p>
<p>chuck liddell got in i mean it was so new</p>
<p>randy couture it was all so new 96</p>
<p>like three years into the</p>
<p>sport being born</p>
<p>created no they were the</p>
<p>first guys to try to like</p>
<p>force their</p>
<p>their their</p>
<p>individual skill sets on</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of them are</p>
<p>still around</p>
<p>today which is the most incredible</p>
<p>thing henderson</p>
<p>still around</p>
<p>today you know</p>
<p>randy still around</p>
<p>today randy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fighting in toronto</p>
<p>duties forty</p>
<p>eight who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna find my</p>
<p>cheetah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fighting the cheetah</p>
<p>once he been</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s he been though</p>
<p>he just fought rampage and lost a</p>
<p>close decision</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>first fight</p>
<p>after losing the</p>
<p>title yeah yeah</p>
<p>forever ago yeah he had a good</p>
<p>fight with rampage</p>
<p>it was real good</p>
<p>fight the first two</p>
<p>rounds were real</p>
<p>close and the</p>
<p>second round the other one</p>
<p>blitzkrieg rampage</p>
<p>dropped them got on top of them was a real</p>
<p>good real good</p>
<p>round for for liotto</p>
<p>but the first two</p>
<p>rampage in a lot of i</p>
<p>guess in the</p>
<p>judges eyes</p>
<p>edged them just edged them</p>
<p>although the</p>
<p>other one the</p>
<p>third in a pretty good</p>
<p>good margin</p>
<p>by good margin</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still rampage got the decision</p>
<p>and he won the</p>
<p>first two rounds by the judges</p>
<p>but it was real</p>
<p>close real close</p>
<p>first two rounds you know</p>
<p>right those are</p>
<p>ones are like this</p>
<p>the two for us</p>
<p>go either way then it&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>i think they decided that rampage was pushing</p>
<p>the fight as</p>
<p>the moves away</p>
<p>you know leo</p>
<p>does pretty</p>
<p>practical and</p>
<p>moves away but he still</p>
<p>punched the fuck out of people yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think many</p>
<p>many blows were really landed</p>
<p>clean blows the</p>
<p>first two rounds</p>
<p>then the third round</p>
<p>yoda really</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just crazy that</p>
<p>randy is gonna be</p>
<p>fighting him at 48 years of age</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s a nut</p>
<p>man guys doing</p>
<p>movies and he</p>
<p>still wants to get in the cage</p>
<p>those guys in the face it&rsquo;s in the box</p>
<p>is the legitimate</p>
<p>top shelf guy</p>
<p>dude this ain&rsquo;t yeah this ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>james tony he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fight me machita</p>
<p>leo to machita</p>
<p>yeah you know machita is so fast with his hands</p>
<p>so dangerous</p>
<p>he knocked out</p>
<p>tiago silva</p>
<p>tiago silva is yeah when he was undefeated</p>
<p>yeah yeah they</p>
<p>knocked him out on the ground there&rsquo;s both</p>
<p>blasting them</p>
<p>got them on the ground and put them away</p>
<p>bam let laser beam accuracy</p>
<p>knock them the fuck out</p>
<p>thiago&rsquo;s a beast</p>
<p>you know that guy&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>tough gorilla</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>thiago some strong guy</p>
<p>the way he beat the shit out of</p>
<p>brandon bear yeah</p>
<p>beat him apart his nose was fit</p>
<p>that was the ugliest nose break i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>and he got released by the ufc record for that</p>
<p>well apparently</p>
<p>that releases in dispute now</p>
<p>and because thiago silva path</p>
<p>it had two urine</p>
<p>samples and one of them tested positive</p>
<p>so i think they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re having another test</p>
<p>but there there</p>
<p>if if it comes in no contest</p>
<p>then brandon bear doesn&rsquo;t get cut</p>
<p>wait they&rsquo;ll uncut him</p>
<p>yes i thought they just cut people</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>make a decision like you know what you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think they can if you win</p>
<p>really the only</p>
<p>thing i think</p>
<p>that can if you win is if you violate some sort of</p>
<p>ethics code what if</p>
<p>they give like four or five contracts so i have</p>
<p>three or five contracts</p>
<p>but they have like</p>
<p>a certain amount of time i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>whatever it is</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at the end of</p>
<p>those fights they can be like yeah we don&rsquo;t want there</p>
<p>must be something that yeah</p>
<p>but there must be some option and if the</p>
<p>fighter loses</p>
<p>then they have an immediate option to cut them</p>
<p>because yeah because it&rsquo;s almost always got to get cut</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m sure everybody&rsquo;s contract is different</p>
<p>but with brandon</p>
<p>i mean if it becomes a no contest then he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>then it would</p>
<p>i i it might be</p>
<p>that contractually</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s allowed to stay</p>
<p>it might be that because that&rsquo;s not a loss</p>
<p>i like that that guy&rsquo;s a cool guy</p>
<p>brandon&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great guy he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great guy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>having a hard time man i don&rsquo;t know what happened</p>
<p>somewhere along the line</p>
<p>some things</p>
<p>changed for him he was at one</p>
<p>point in time when he was</p>
<p>fighting as a</p>
<p>heavyweight man he was a killer dude</p>
<p>you know we were</p>
<p>talking about him in</p>
<p>heavyweight for a</p>
<p>while he smashed</p>
<p>frank meyer</p>
<p>he knocked out justin iowa</p>
<p>with a head kick</p>
<p>you know he choked out of suario</p>
<p>silva he was a</p>
<p>beast man he was a dangerous dangerous guy</p>
<p>but something happened</p>
<p>and you know he lost to tim sylvia and</p>
<p>broke his hand and then</p>
<p>lost a febreze super doom</p>
<p>and then he lost to john</p>
<p>jones the john</p>
<p>jones one was a big one</p>
<p>you know but you know either lost a few</p>
<p>fights already by the time that rolled around you know</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s this hard we lost to</p>
<p>keith jardine</p>
<p>at his first two</p>
<p>o five pound fight</p>
<p>so what happened there</p>
<p>did he lose to keith yeah</p>
<p>yeah jardine gets</p>
<p>me so pissed he just can&rsquo;t get back to the usa</p>
<p>you cannot get back to it</p>
<p>yeah i mean guys he&rsquo;s beating there are in it</p>
<p>you know jardine</p>
<p>i like that guy a lot</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s quite a character</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the cool</p>
<p>things about the ufc is all the</p>
<p>weird characters you get to meet</p>
<p>you can get a person</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>fighting with mostly</p>
<p>you can get whatever kind of personality you want</p>
<p>yeah you don&rsquo;t have to be corporate</p>
<p>yeah yeah like</p>
<p>donald&rsquo;s her own</p>
<p>just a fucking weirdo yeah</p>
<p>those people are fucking cool weirdos yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a cool cowboy that likes</p>
<p>apple products</p>
<p>he likes those are</p>
<p>cuters that you yeah look</p>
<p>control he&rsquo;s really he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an interesting guy to me too because he&rsquo;s so adaptable</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s got a wicked</p>
<p>guard and wicked</p>
<p>stand up and it&rsquo;s hard to take down</p>
<p>and when guys</p>
<p>take him down man he&rsquo;ll fuck you up off his back</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s dangerous off his back</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some guys you</p>
<p>get him down on the back and they just kind of hold on</p>
<p>you know they have a good defensive</p>
<p>guard maybe they can get up</p>
<p>maybe they could</p>
<p>again back up</p>
<p>but very few guys are really dangerous attacking off</p>
<p>their guard lexironius</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s real dangerous</p>
<p>off his back you know who&rsquo;s really good at it i saw a</p>
<p>fight in strike force</p>
<p>it was some like</p>
<p>lebanese dude</p>
<p>okay guard musasa</p>
<p>yeah he was attacking the fuck he was</p>
<p>punching up from his back</p>
<p>raise armenian</p>
<p>i mean whatever it is</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s punching off that i thought</p>
<p>i thought he was getting the better of that exchange</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny you said that because that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>exact same discussion that i had with someone else</p>
<p>a very educated guy</p>
<p>recently who thought you know if you looked at it</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t believe it to him</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s on his ground is bad but</p>
<p>on his back means you&rsquo;re susceptible to things</p>
<p>not that it is bad but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be more</p>
<p>susceptible you know boss root and won the</p>
<p>heavyweight</p>
<p>championship off his back</p>
<p>really well yeah</p>
<p>blasting kevin reynold</p>
<p>with elbows and</p>
<p>punches and</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>random and from taking him down but</p>
<p>random and couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stop lost from fucking him up once he had him down</p>
<p>at the end of the fight</p>
<p>you know boss had</p>
<p>landed significantly more</p>
<p>stuff from his back and so the</p>
<p>referees and the</p>
<p>judges rather</p>
<p>gave it to him it was a big</p>
<p>point of controversy because a lot of people thought</p>
<p>kevin randall was on top he</p>
<p>should be winning</p>
<p>the boss is landing</p>
<p>all these shots</p>
<p>from the bottom yeah but it&rsquo;s like let&rsquo;s say let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you have my back</p>
<p>okay which i&rsquo;m in a really</p>
<p>position let&rsquo;s you have that for four minutes of around</p>
<p>right and then you</p>
<p>cross your fucking feet and i do one of</p>
<p>those moves</p>
<p>where whatever that is</p>
<p>the foot lock</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you lost i want yeah so it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter how long you were it&rsquo;s like you can</p>
<p>say you had a dominant</p>
<p>position but show me</p>
<p>with a win or by beating somebody up scoring an</p>
<p>mma is a very</p>
<p>weird thing you need to get better at that that</p>
<p>annoys me as a fan yeah it does</p>
<p>annoy me too</p>
<p>there was this</p>
<p>nick ring and</p>
<p>ricky fukuta</p>
<p>fight this weekend was</p>
<p>particularly bad kuda</p>
<p>took nick ring</p>
<p>down every round what</p>
<p>what beautiful takedowns controlled top position did</p>
<p>an awesome job of</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a wrestler and he seems</p>
<p>doing an awesome job of utilizing his</p>
<p>skills and he got robbed and decision except</p>
<p>a lot of people booed</p>
<p>everyone went</p>
<p>crazy it was real bad one of the</p>
<p>worst ones i&rsquo;ve seen when</p>
<p>judges are two</p>
<p>rounds off and that one like oh that</p>
<p>could round go either way not like that regular</p>
<p>round and when they&rsquo;re two</p>
<p>rounds off from each</p>
<p>other it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t the players have to know</p>
<p>going to third</p>
<p>round if this</p>
<p>is down one</p>
<p>thing this is one</p>
<p>another example of how badass dana white is</p>
<p>he gave the guy his win</p>
<p>bonus he did yes</p>
<p>gave the guys win</p>
<p>bonus that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the guy got robbed</p>
<p>so we have both of my bonus yeah</p>
<p>yeah he gave</p>
<p>those men bonus</p>
<p>wow yeah i know he did that</p>
<p>once when somebody had to pull out i</p>
<p>think it was</p>
<p>the other armenia had to pull out of a fight</p>
<p>and so who&rsquo;s so mad that he gave</p>
<p>his opponent</p>
<p>his win bonus</p>
<p>oh really he&rsquo;s like it ain&rsquo;t your</p>
<p>fault that he pulled out</p>
<p>right yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah i remember that yeah like</p>
<p>panic attacks or something yeah</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s like that you get your</p>
<p>son it&rsquo;s not your fault you should you can fight</p>
<p>it like that</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>generous guy when it comes to that stuff it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cool to see you know</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s right you know that guy won man</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>got fucked got fucked because these</p>
<p>judges are incompetent like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>his record up it&rsquo;s not anything you can do about that</p>
<p>so many competent</p>
<p>judges man but i honestly</p>
<p>think they need to revamp the scoring system</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>leave it open to</p>
<p>subjective interpretation of what is more</p>
<p>worthwhile is it more</p>
<p>worthwhile to take a guy down or is it more</p>
<p>worthwhile to hit him with a jab</p>
<p>is it more you know</p>
<p>if you hit a guy with a jab</p>
<p>and rock him</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>shoots for a takedown gets on top of you and</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do anything</p>
<p>who wins that exchange i mean that&rsquo;s a good question</p>
<p>i mean i think to me i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s clearly the guy who</p>
<p>blasted you</p>
<p>and they got</p>
<p>taken down but then he took you down even if he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>beating you up</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a failed submission attempt</p>
<p>does nothing to you</p>
<p>the trip wears you out a little bit</p>
<p>fighting off the rear</p>
<p>naked or something</p>
<p>but like true</p>
<p>well you have to</p>
<p>score it because the guy came</p>
<p>close close yeah</p>
<p>depends but you also have to be</p>
<p>skillful enough</p>
<p>to know what</p>
<p>close really means</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see a guy when the guys try to get him in a kimora</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll say he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna get or</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s pulling in</p>
<p>yes go ahead and try but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wasting energy i know when someone&rsquo;s wasting energy</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m surprised</p>
<p>every now and then</p>
<p>but for the most time</p>
<p>most part i know as a</p>
<p>fighters that are</p>
<p>with the weak position no to like on safe here right</p>
<p>some judges don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>some judges</p>
<p>would look at</p>
<p>that and go he almost got him with that guillotine</p>
<p>no we didn&rsquo;t almost get him with that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you</p>
<p>son we almost got him</p>
<p>he was proud</p>
<p>he had he was very close</p>
<p>guys good at that technique no</p>
<p>you have to be a someone</p>
<p>who actually</p>
<p>trains in jujutsu</p>
<p>and trains and</p>
<p>striking and it really</p>
<p>understands the</p>
<p>subtle nuances in</p>
<p>order to judge it</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>think that you can take</p>
<p>these people they</p>
<p>never even box they just</p>
<p>judge boxing and then</p>
<p>teach them how to judge</p>
<p>mma it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too much shit</p>
<p>going on they don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna know near</p>
<p>submissions they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna know when someone&rsquo;s totally safe</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna know when someone&rsquo;s doing a technique</p>
<p>wrong and the guys</p>
<p>never gonna tap</p>
<p>sometimes guys will get</p>
<p>like certain positions and they&rsquo;ll yank on</p>
<p>a technique and i&rsquo;m like this is like this</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work from this position yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s guys on the</p>
<p>wrong side or yeah</p>
<p>so but but the person who&rsquo;s the judge</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t gonna know</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know that guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>waste this time</p>
<p>that when i&rsquo;m in a crowd</p>
<p>and somebody just laying the ground</p>
<p>like grabbing an arm and we&rsquo;re just go</p>
<p>you like shut up</p>
<p>nothing you get</p>

<p>sitting next to clegued is mom yeah</p>
<p>while i was on</p>
<p>edibles and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and it was the the best fun i&rsquo;ve ever had in a</p>
<p>fight i was on my knees go i got the fuck</p>
<p>that was at the palm to it was</p>
<p>real and that was the best</p>
<p>things we ever got</p>
<p>were front row</p>
<p>shit everywhere</p>
<p>yeah if you&rsquo;re ever in</p>
<p>vegas and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you want to go see some</p>
<p>fights in vegas</p>
<p>see the ultimate</p>
<p>fighter finalities</p>
<p>all the ones they do at the palms if you want to</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s to me the best</p>
<p>experience you know</p>
<p>and if you go live</p>
<p>and the seats are really good</p>
<p>every seat is good every</p>
<p>seat above yeah it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>place but a lot of times</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the marquee name</p>
<p>fights though you know unfortunately but the</p>
<p>still it&rsquo;s fun man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun to be it&rsquo;s real intimate i like that intimate</p>
<p>show i like that 4 000 seats or whatever the hell it is</p>
<p>how many is it what do you</p>
<p>think that is</p>
<p>on four thousand four thousand</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>good online to get checked what a perfect decision</p>
<p>that place is</p>
<p>seats are set doesn&rsquo;t go in most</p>
<p>places like the mgm mandalay whatever any stadium</p>
<p>yeah it goes back out away from the</p>
<p>thing yeah but this it only goes back like</p>
<p>thirty rows or so and then it goes to the next level</p>
<p>do katt williams does stand up there</p>
<p>yeah at least the limpanel i did too god damn</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of the around i guess</p>
<p>is it no no because you know the pearl there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a set up on the</p>
<p>stage so i&rsquo;ll be backstage yeah that would be backstage</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll put curtains up</p>
<p>yeah dude that place is giant</p>
<p>wow what&rsquo;s the biggest</p>
<p>crowd you ever performed in front of</p>
<p>i think it was this</p>
<p>las vegas crowd i think it was 1700</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t think i ever did 1800 i</p>
<p>think we had 1800 seater but we didn&rsquo;t fill it up yeah</p>
<p>where was that i think the more we got</p>
<p>1500 or something yeah</p>
<p>i think that was the biggest yeah</p>
<p>this vegas one was giant</p>
<p>i think about more than twice that is the palms</p>
<p>more than twice that</p>
<p>is what the pearl</p>
<p>more than twice the</p>
<p>mandalay bay theater</p>
<p>jesus the biggest</p>
<p>thing i ever did is the k rock</p>
<p>april foolishness show</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like six thousand people six thousand it&rsquo;s huge</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really huge</p>
<p>you know you get a little nervous for that yeah</p>
<p>so i guess a lot</p>
<p>of people that</p>
<p>might get excited</p>
<p>it was a lot of good people on the card too</p>
<p>jay moore was on bill</p>
<p>burr was on</p>
<p>sarah sudman</p>
<p>was on i&rsquo;ve done it with patton</p>
<p>oswald i&rsquo;ve done it with a lot of people you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s awesome man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a fun show</p>
<p>and those guys are like huge fans of comedy</p>
<p>so they have all</p>
<p>these comics that come on the show all the time</p>
<p>so that the audience members totally get used to</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing too i remember</p>
<p>reading about this in</p>
<p>a con essential last</p>
<p>laughs thing</p>
<p>just a live event</p>
<p>where they just talk</p>
<p>about whatever happened in the year as performers right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way for them to make money but</p>
<p>i remember people</p>
<p>saying reviews of it and people saying how</p>
<p>funny david</p>
<p>cross was and how</p>
<p>funny carlsmanci it was</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>those are such varied</p>
<p>tastes like how</p>
<p>can be a fan because like people can</p>
<p>laugh at things</p>
<p>and someone</p>
<p>people say like shouldn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>the layer the</p>
<p>cable got same sort of</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like why the</p>
<p>fans like you and him</p>
<p>right so right</p>
<p>why should they not</p>
<p>right what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with that they something</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>well you know there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gonna be a certain amount</p>
<p>of people that liked something that&rsquo;s terrible it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to be</p>
<p>upset by it</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you choose what to be</p>
<p>upset by in life and</p>
<p>what people like</p>
<p>why would you be</p>
<p>upset by what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t do it with like</p>
<p>like oral taste</p>
<p>right if you like how you not like tomatoes</p>
<p>well some people</p>
<p>do though with meat man i&rsquo;ve had a lot of</p>
<p>annoying motherfuckers who are</p>
<p>vegans who won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>leave me alone</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more of an</p>
<p>after all right</p>
<p>about eating meat</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;ve been saying that on stage like</p>
<p>i totally went</p>
<p>vegan because i</p>
<p>found out that if you don&rsquo;t kill</p>
<p>animals they live forever and then they cure cancer</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been saying that lately</p>
<p>lately on stage when i do my vegan character because no</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s fucking silly man these animals are</p>
<p>gonna die i mean i don&rsquo;t believe in animal</p>
<p>cruelty but i think you know</p>
<p>you gotta eat animals that i guess</p>
<p>i get if you don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that one&rsquo;s right i totally don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they should suffer i</p>
<p>agree with you on that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in the game i&rsquo;ve been buying game lately</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a game</p>
<p>me like venison i love</p>
<p>going to restaurants and ordering venison</p>
<p>i found a place in</p>
<p>new zealand deer okay</p>
<p>deer and elk really good for you i have this theory</p>
<p>never had elk</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s delicious reindeer elk is delicious</p>
<p>i have this theory</p>
<p>about animals that the animals that are tough to</p>
<p>catch are the ones that are really good for you</p>
<p>like fish fish are hard to</p>
<p>catch and they&rsquo;re really like high</p>
<p>nutrition very healthy for you you know</p>
<p>unless they have mercury poisoning</p>
<p>from people in their fucking shitty pollution grain fed</p>
<p>grain fried is not</p>
<p>natural cows</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not natural for brain for them to be in grain</p>
<p>oh wait what is it when they&rsquo;re off</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re all fat and juicy and marbley</p>
<p>like that that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>tastes good it</p>
<p>tastes awesome it&rsquo;s good to cook on the grill</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not normal for a cow</p>
<p>whichever one free range whatever it is</p>
<p>supposed to be</p>
<p>good for you like it helps</p>
<p>speed up your metabolism and like burnt fat</p>
<p>well free range beef is</p>
<p>grass fed beef</p>
<p>grass fed that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s much better for you</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re feeding animals</p>
<p>these grain</p>
<p>based diets</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re only doing it to fatten up the animal</p>
<p>they only do it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s funny because</p>
<p>there was a guy i talked</p>
<p>about this on the</p>
<p>podcast once and a guy who was a scientist emailed me</p>
<p>a really good description he actually works for</p>
<p>a chicken laboratory</p>
<p>and he explained to me how it all goes down</p>
<p>and he said that chickens</p>
<p>contrary to popular belief</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not hormones</p>
<p>you know chickens like if you ever</p>
<p>watch food anchoring</p>
<p>those documentaries they get</p>
<p>super huge and they can&rsquo;t even walk</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>breeding they just</p>
<p>breed them to get that big</p>
<p>but with cows they pump cows full of all kinds of shit</p>
<p>they pump them up for all kinds of steroids oh really</p>
<p>and he said the</p>
<p>thing with antibiotics is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to like</p>
<p>say if your chickens</p>
<p>me need x amount of days to grow</p>
<p>but when you give them antibiotics you have to cut</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re not allowed to</p>
<p>bring them to</p>
<p>slaughter for like 20 days or whatever the hell it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to work for</p>
<p>their system</p>
<p>so when people</p>
<p>are unscrupulous then they they&rsquo;ll kill a chicken</p>
<p>even though they know that the antibiotics don&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>and then it can get in your system</p>
<p>and then you know hormones and all</p>
<p>sorts of other types of</p>
<p>things get your</p>
<p>system from beef and shit</p>
<p>same way it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird people</p>
<p>reminds me of some steps</p>
<p>over park went to france to work on a</p>
<p>winery and they didn&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>grapes to fill up all their</p>
<p>stocks that used</p>
<p>turpentine to</p>
<p>fill up the rest</p>
<p>because these</p>
<p>idiots they will not know</p>
<p>put the lock in</p>
<p>but yeah it&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>when people</p>
<p>when i grew up people said no you need only</p>
<p>grass fed be</p>
<p>really natural</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this idea like naturals better but sort of like a</p>
<p>zeni kind of thing</p>
<p>right spiritual</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>when you think</p>
<p>about it and</p>
<p>i saw this video it sort of</p>
<p>changed me a little bit</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like no it is</p>
<p>different for your body one is good for your body</p>
<p>this type of beef that comes from grass fed</p>
<p>one is bad for your body that&rsquo;s interesting i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>heard that before i know it&rsquo;s lean or protein they said</p>
<p>it helps speed it helps burn fat really</p>
<p>is it that raw almonds but they said not</p>
<p>baked almonds or salted almonds</p>
<p>only the raw ones huh</p>
<p>i need to look into that with</p>
<p>grass fed beef because i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never heard that before but i</p>
<p>my theory about</p>
<p>game is always been that you know deer really hard to</p>
<p>catch elk are really hard to catch</p>
<p>and that like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great reward for</p>
<p>catching them they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>nutritious you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a very lean and</p>
<p>high in protein and</p>
<p>i think fish in the same way i mean</p>
<p>i figured out how to catch fish</p>
<p>salmon in the wild are better for you than</p>
<p>salmon when it&rsquo;s easier to</p>
<p>catch when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sitting there</p>
<p>yeah this is the weirdest</p>
<p>thing they have a different color yeah</p>
<p>they have to put</p>
<p>in salmon they put dye in it to make it pink</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>their color the</p>
<p>light color</p>
<p>the live color that they get from being wild</p>
<p>wild as fuck out there killing minnows and shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the strong survival</p>
<p>for survival</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so good to</p>
<p>catch because</p>
<p>salmon are so fucking strong</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so fun now they&rsquo;re not just delicious</p>
<p>they fight hard you know</p>
<p>salmon fight</p>
<p>hard it&rsquo;s awesome to</p>
<p>catch them we really got so</p>
<p>excited about</p>
<p>alaska dude we</p>
<p>should i love fishing man</p>
<p>fishing is fun as fuck</p>
<p>i used to love</p>
<p>rainbow trout fishing just you know similar to sam</p>
<p>they fight so hard man</p>
<p>we used to catch them all the time at</p>
<p>i forgot what&rsquo;s the name of the</p>
<p>place jamaica pond</p>
<p>jamaica plains make a</p>
<p>plain massachusetts we go to jamaica</p>
<p>pond and catch rainbow trouts</p>
<p>fucking big ones too man it was fun</p>
<p>caught a big</p>
<p>brown trout there once was like three</p>
<p>pounds i was like holy shit wow</p>
<p>it was so fun</p>
<p>catching trout trout like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re such beautiful creatures trout and</p>
<p>salmon you know</p>
<p>magical colors to them you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that one fish that we were trying to</p>
<p>catch a time we went in anchorage we cut</p>
<p>salmon for a</p>
<p>while and then we&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>catch halibut</p>
<p>halibut which</p>
<p>is humongous</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>i got one wait five minutes i got another one it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you go after one</p>
<p>like a while</p>
<p>yeah they can be hundreds of</p>
<p>pounds yeah</p>
<p>and what you even</p>
<p>catch on a line and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrestling for</p>
<p>tiring them out</p>
<p>just break your line</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not crazy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>pull them out of the water yeah</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re delicious too halibut is delicious</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s something about</p>
<p>catching something and then eating it i was in mexico</p>
<p>and cancun and i went to</p>
<p>we got on a boat</p>
<p>and caught these mahi mahi</p>
<p>and then they cooked them up literally</p>
<p>an hour after they were dead we were eating them</p>
<p>maybe two hours after that maximum and it was so good</p>
<p>the nick adams stories is this is hemingway</p>
<p>set of short stories that all sort of about him</p>
<p>but he talks about like he grew up like</p>
<p>on reservations like near reservations</p>
<p>i know the indians all the time</p>
<p>and he was talking about how</p>
<p>every fish he didn&rsquo;t understand why</p>
<p>fish and fry them up immediately it was so much better</p>
<p>until by later in life he said that&rsquo;s just the thing</p>
<p>yeah but yeah i guess it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah the fresh</p>
<p>layers definitely</p>
<p>catch a trout and then cook it like</p>
<p>get a fire going and then cook it like</p>
<p>right after you catch it</p>
<p>i think fresh water is a lot better for that yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>freshwater it&rsquo;s very important to eat them fresh</p>
<p>they get gamey pretty quick i think saltwater</p>
<p>saltwater probably you have a little bit more time</p>
<p>maybe i mean maybe i&rsquo;m just guessing</p>
<p>but salt water is so mysterious to me fresh</p>
<p>water is fun because you know there&rsquo;s some great fun</p>
<p>fishes to catch like</p>
<p>largemouth bass and trout and stuff like that</p>
<p>but salt water is so</p>
<p>crazy because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what the fuck&rsquo;s out there you</p>
<p>know the ocean man</p>
<p>you know i mean you</p>
<p>might pull up a</p>
<p>grouper or something you know</p>
<p>a big giant bass looking</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re in like florida</p>
<p>or somewhere tropical</p>
<p>holy shit you can</p>
<p>catch anything man</p>
<p>sharks you can</p>
<p>catch sharks</p>
<p>just see bass i mean there&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>huge variety</p>
<p>official came up like</p>
<p>twenty yards off our boat</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>killer whale or a</p>
<p>whale whale just well</p>
<p>twenty yards that&rsquo;s so close</p>
<p>so close was little baby well but it was a dying thing</p>
<p>just kind of went up and splashed down but like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there we have our line the same waters happened</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird that we distinguish them like like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smart and what&rsquo;s not smart</p>
<p>like whales like we discourage people from whaling</p>
<p>and one of the reasons</p>
<p>not just that they&rsquo;re endangered people like you know</p>
<p>we feel like</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t kill them like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re intelligent they&rsquo;re closer to us yeah</p>
<p>in some way it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird because</p>
<p>we have the opposite for retards</p>
<p>they shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>kill them because they&rsquo;re not intelligent</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true only kill</p>
<p>and kill intelligent people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good point</p>
<p>what is it about</p>
<p>whales in the japanese don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>they just kill the shit out of</p>
<p>like idiots</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not as</p>
<p>smart as us okay</p>
<p>relax yeah they&rsquo;re not us</p>
<p>yeah they don&rsquo;t fall into that at all dolphins or</p>
<p>whales they fuck dolphins up to yeah</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t see it either i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t and i haven&rsquo;t watched it i&rsquo;m scared to</p>
<p>watch it because i know what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about slaughtering dolphins</p>
<p>for game for</p>
<p>sport now they did tuna fishermen do it</p>
<p>you know they do it because the dolphins eat their tuna</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>i mean look at it</p>
<p>that way i see what they&rsquo;re saying and they need these</p>
<p>tuna but god damn it&rsquo;s so ruthless</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen some</p>
<p>videos online of them killing tunas</p>
<p>are killing rather dolphins are they just</p>
<p>going to talk</p>
<p>hang out and just fucking</p>
<p>start spearing</p>
<p>yeah well the</p>
<p>with the fitted footage that i seen is them cutting a</p>
<p>dolphin&rsquo;s throat off</p>
<p>on a dock just slicing his</p>
<p>throat things</p>
<p>alive and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dying and kicking and</p>
<p>bloods pouring out it&rsquo;s really good luck</p>
<p>on the dock</p>
<p>hoisted it up</p>
<p>just got it this cut its neck open</p>
<p>vladimir it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>watch man dolphin</p>
<p>meet me good</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never heard of anybody eating it</p>
<p>i know they eat</p>
<p>whale shark</p>
<p>made i know</p>
<p>shark is delicious</p>
<p>alistair overran</p>
<p>eats shark shark and</p>
<p>horse meat horse meat</p>
<p>is that good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always the</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s horse meat</p>
<p>filler well</p>
<p>not but is it good</p>
<p>you know alistair</p>
<p>says there&rsquo;s a lot of protein in and it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>sound strong</p>
<p>as fuck yeah</p>
<p>like you see a</p>
<p>horse racing in slow motion like those are</p>
<p>muscles that will</p>
<p>this just be there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>horse down the</p>
<p>street from my house</p>
<p>and it just sits in his yard</p>
<p>it barely moves</p>
<p>just stand still and then they take it for a ride</p>
<p>every now and then and this</p>
<p>thing is swole</p>
<p>yolked super</p>
<p>strong just</p>
<p>naturally super</p>
<p>strong not really</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>in that cage</p>
<p>we think to look like that you</p>
<p>would think that</p>
<p>thing has to be at the gym all day you</p>
<p>but no it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>standing there just</p>
<p>giant rippling</p>
<p>shiny muscles</p>
<p>jesus i think we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s kind of late at night</p>
<p>unfortunately it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;re at 141 which is which means</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s 8 39</p>
<p>a lot of these people are going to sleep there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lights out around us and we&rsquo;re being loud as fuck</p>
<p>so we will end this podcast on a plane</p>
<p>thank you everyone and ari</p>
<p>shafir&rsquo;s new podcast will be called the skeptic tank</p>
<p>because of my love for shit</p>
<p>fan suggested it and because i like to</p>
<p>skeptically</p>
<p>think about subjects</p>
<p>hmm intelligent analyzation analysis whatever anyway</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s connected to the death squad</p>
<p>podcast chain</p>
<p>that brian has put together so if you go to</p>
<p>deathsquad tv i</p>
<p>think brian has them listed up there is that what it is</p>
<p>deathsquad tv</p>
<p>and then he also a</p>
<p>deathsquad on itunes if you go</p>
<p>to itunes through your you know</p>
<p>to the itunes store</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s for free and you can find the</p>
<p>death squad podcast and just find ari&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and you can listen to those individually and</p>
<p>alright so that&rsquo;s it folks thank you for tuning in</p>
<p>oh i have to thank the flashlight even though</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have one here</p>
<p>and this is an impromptu podcast</p>
<p>they do sponsor us and we appreciate them</p>
<p>so go to flashlight com and we can</p>
<p>use that on the airplane bathroom</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;d use an airplane bathroom</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;d have to warm myself up before i did it and i</p>
<p>think that would stretches</p>
<p>i would have to be no i&rsquo;d have to be like</p>
<p>three quarters hard at</p>
<p>least before i got out of my seat</p>
<p>you know and then</p>
<p>in walking to the bathroom i&rsquo;d probably lose at</p>
<p>least half of that so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>to go in somehow with some sort of a bag hiding this</p>
<p>enormous flashlight</p>
<p>but yeah i would use it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve jerked off in</p>
<p>bathrooms and</p>
<p>planes before</p>
<p>how many times</p>
<p>for a while it was a</p>
<p>sport for me i was trying</p>
<p>to see when they say we&rsquo;re not flying over arkansas</p>
<p>like oh arkansas</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get over that</p>
<p>so i try to run to the bathroom you know</p>
