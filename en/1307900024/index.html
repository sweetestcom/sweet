Attention.
I have always loved the quote from Mozart, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s abbreviated.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s a couple of different sentences cut out, but the quote as put together is
wonderful and it&amp;rsquo;s symbolic of something we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about today.
And the quote is, when I am completely myself, entirely alone, or during the night when I
cannot sleep, it is on such occasions that my ideas flow best and most abundantly.'>

    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>Attention.</p>
<p>I have always loved the quote from Mozart, and I think it&rsquo;s abbreviated.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a couple of different sentences cut out, but the quote as put together is</p>
<p>wonderful and it&rsquo;s symbolic of something we&rsquo;re going to talk about today.</p>
<p>And the quote is, when I am completely myself, entirely alone, or during the night when I</p>
<p>cannot sleep, it is on such occasions that my ideas flow best and most abundantly.</p>
<p>Whence and how these ideas come, I know not, nor can I force them, end quote.</p>
<p>I think many of us can relate to that, at least the latter part, right?</p>
<p>Nor can I force them.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re in a field where creativity is required for you to prosper, eventually</p>
<p>you start wondering about this thing, creativity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other ways to put it.</p>
<p>You could say insight, or originality, or novelty.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s multiple different ways to try to define this thing that is so wrapped</p>
<p>up in the condition of being human that one could easily make a case that all human civilization</p>
<p>is the result of creativity over millennia, you know, laid upon itself, right?</p>
<p>Generation by generation by generation.</p>
<p>Depends on how you define creativity, of course.</p>
<p>If you were going to write a book on the subject of creativity, and I don&rsquo;t mean like a book</p>
<p>about other people&rsquo;s creativity, I mean the concept.</p>
<p>What would it sound like?</p>
<p>Would it sound like a scientific book?</p>
<p>Would it sound like an instruction manual?</p>
<p>Would it sound like tips?</p>
<p>I mean, I have one on the great creative people over history and their working habits or the</p>
<p>habits that they had in order to get in the right frame of mind to do their creative work.</p>
<p>Or would it sound kind of metaphysical?</p>
<p>You know, something along the lines of the Greek idea of the muses, you know, the creators</p>
<p>of inspiration, the ones who sort of sprinkle your brain with the original thoughts.</p>
<p>I read some stuff from the Hindu religious text once that suggested it was sort of an</p>
<p>opening up to the divine to be inspired from somewhere else, right?</p>
<p>The inspiration didn&rsquo;t come from your own brain.</p>
<p>It came from without.</p>
<p>And the people who could do this really well were people that could sort of open that door</p>
<p>to the realm where, well, the Greeks might say the muses resided.</p>
<p>If you go on Wikipedia and you look up creativity, it&rsquo;ll blow your mind, all the different ideas</p>
<p>out there.</p>
<p>And I have a couple of books like that too, where they&rsquo;re getting into like neuroscience</p>
<p>and dopamine and frontal lobe, working with other parts of the brains.</p>
<p>And in creative people, you see more of that.</p>
<p>But when you read a lot of the accounts from the people who actually do this creative work,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this real sense of no knowledge where this stuff comes from.</p>
<p>Just like the Mozart quote.</p>
<p>I mean, I read a quote once too from a comedian who said, and I don&rsquo;t know if this is true</p>
<p>or not, and I don&rsquo;t remember the quote really well, but it was something to the effect of</p>
<p>every comedian has the same fear.</p>
<p>And the fear is that that reservoir of material that&rsquo;s inside you that creates the jokes,</p>
<p>the stuff that you make a living out of that just, you know, you do better than other people</p>
<p>that that will dry up one day.</p>
<p>And one day you&rsquo;ll go there to, you know, get a new set of creative materials, you know,</p>
<p>being produced by your, you know, creative assembly line in your psyche, and it will</p>
<p>be empty.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a sign of how little you know about, you know, what it is, that could lead you</p>
<p>to a fear that someday it might run out.</p>
<p>So I study this stuff as many of you do.</p>
<p>And I also think that we place too much emphasis on creativity for obvious artists.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re a painter, you might be a very creative person, obviously, by our</p>
<p>modern standards, but no one thinks about how much creativity it takes just to get through</p>
<p>life for people who don&rsquo;t consider themselves creative at all.</p>
<p>Any novel solution you come up with for a problem is an example of human creativity</p>
<p>at work.</p>
<p>I think you can see the same sort of thing going on in the animal kingdom, too, at a</p>
<p>lower level.</p>
<p>You see apes doing things that are creative, original novel.</p>
<p>But as I said, if you were going to write a book on this, what would it sound like?</p>
<p>Music producer, and that is a weird, very narrow term to describe somebody with a much</p>
<p>wider vista and experience makeup.</p>
<p>But known as music producer, Rick Rubin has written a book called The Creative Act, A</p>
<p>Way of Being.</p>
<p>And at the moment, he&rsquo;s doing the book circuit.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re like the last people in the world to have Rick on.</p>
<p>But he is, you know, he&rsquo;s worked with everybody.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s known, I would call him a creativity amplifier, but he&rsquo;s a very creative guy in</p>
<p>his own right.</p>
<p>He has an image, a public image, a sort of a Zen kind of a character, right?</p>
<p>A meditator, big beard, sort of a metaphysical sort of a cast to him.</p>
<p>He seems a little Eastern mysticism-ish.</p>
<p>But this book was one of those things where when you read it, and Rick had sent me before</p>
<p>this talk, two reviews, a good review and a bad review for the book.</p>
<p>And the bad review was talking about how the book was, and I think I&rsquo;m quoting the review,</p>
<p>woo-woo.</p>
<p>So sort of, you know, out there.</p>
<p>But if you think about the concept we&rsquo;re talking about here, that&rsquo;s why I brought up the Mozart</p>
<p>quote and all those other things to begin with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard subject to talk about without it being sort of metaphysical sounding.</p>
<p>I mean, the concept in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, I mean, it was religious.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what creativity was.</p>
<p>It was just simply God speaking through you.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of connections between inspiration and the divine if you study it</p>
<p>long enough.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s in the modern world where we sit down and try to figure out now, how</p>
<p>can we categorize this scientifically?</p>
<p>And I read people like the late Sir Ken Robinson, who was talking about how the schools crush</p>
<p>creativity and the things we can do to sort of re-instill it.</p>
<p>I went on Wikipedia and read, as I said, about creativity and the stuff about neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>I have a book on geniuses and how they can sit there and try to do, you know, statistical</p>
<p>evaluation.</p>
<p>You know, 20% of the people in this class turn out to be, you know, more original thinkers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting stuff.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re the person trying to rely on the creativity, none of that stuff matters</p>
<p>to you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just trying to figure out what it is, where it came from, how I can amplify it and</p>
<p>get more of it.</p>
<p>And Rick Rubin can be very helpful at that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a fascinating person to talk to who consumes more content, information, history,</p>
<p>politics.</p>
<p>I mean, things far afield from what you would think a music producer would consider to be</p>
<p>sort of his lane.</p>
<p>Rick has no lane.</p>
<p>And that will become apparent in this extended conversation that we&rsquo;re going to have now.</p>
<p>And yes, we&rsquo;re going to tie it into history with Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>So, um, I had thought that there&rsquo;s a historical angle to this that you brought up in your</p>
<p>book that I just love.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this idea that what these were, let&rsquo;s just talk about a recording, but it could</p>
<p>be a television recording, a movie that someone produces, or certainly music and audio, that</p>
<p>what happens there is you&rsquo;ve got a time that&rsquo;s frozen in amber.</p>
<p>And that frozen in amber means that the, so let&rsquo;s just take Mick Jagger and the Rolling</p>
<p>Stones on something like Exile on Main Street.</p>
<p>That is a representation of where that band was in the late 60s.</p>
<p>And when Mick Jagger comes in to record his tracks, he was just out doing something in</p>
<p>the late 60s.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s living that time period as a person of that age.</p>
<p>And then when we listen to it today, as you pointed out in your book, we may get a very</p>
<p>different impression and feel than someone who listens to it right after release.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re really getting no matter what, like if you listen to the tone of his voice</p>
<p>and the things he&rsquo;s singing about and the lyrics he came up with, you&rsquo;re getting a little</p>
<p>bit of a frozen in amber moment of a time.</p>
<p>In other words, if we want to talk about history, if you can imagine, I&rsquo;ve always said if Alexander</p>
<p>the Great had a podcast, you would be catching that moment sort of like the insect frozen</p>
<p>in the amber, you get a chance to see and feel like a time capsule almost.</p>
<p>How does that strike you?</p>
<p>Like when you look back on some of the recordings you did, and you listen to them, and then</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re 30 years ago, maybe, does it bring you right back?</p>
<p>Do you remember the people at, you know, you may know these guys now and they may be 55</p>
<p>years old, but that recording is of a voice of a 22 year old or 23 or how much does this</p>
<p>act as a time capsule for you when you re-listen to things?</p>
<p>Very much.</p>
<p>I rarely re-listen to things unless there&rsquo;s a reason.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time listening to things that I&rsquo;ve worked on because I&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>working on something new, so I&rsquo;m either listening to the new thing or just listening to things</p>
<p>I like and new things that I like because I like learning about music all the time and</p>
<p>being surprised by music.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s a reason for me to listen back, I do listen back.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m listening back, I&rsquo;m usually put back in, more often than not, put back in</p>
<p>the place of recording, either having, picturing the place that we recorded, picturing what</p>
<p>was going on that day, maybe not in great detail, but some sense of what the feeling</p>
<p>was in the room and maybe some particular, I&rsquo;ll still be surprised by things, I&rsquo;ll hear</p>
<p>things that we may have poured over a long time deciding and they may completely hit</p>
<p>me by surprise when they happen and that&rsquo;s a great feeling of not being, I get to experience</p>
<p>it in a way that, in a new way, in a way like hearing it for the first time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny combination of both familiarity and feeling of like I&rsquo;m hearing it for the</p>
<p>first time.</p>
<p>And sometimes I&rsquo;ll hear, I&rsquo;ll be in a coffee shop and I&rsquo;ll hear a song come on that I produced</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll strike me in a certain way and sometimes I&rsquo;ll hear a song come on that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>listened to, that I love, that I have no, had no connection to other than I listened</p>
<p>to it a million times and I hear it and I start thinking, wow, where did we record this?</p>
<p>You know, like I remember, like I, it&rsquo;s too familiar for me not to have recorded this,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t record it, it&rsquo;s, you know, Led Zeppelin, let&rsquo;s say, which I&rsquo;ve never recorded.</p>
<p>I never got to work with them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, you know what it is, it&rsquo;s a variation on how a person listens to music who wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>involved in the production process at all, right?</p>
<p>You could be walking around, hear something from 30 years ago and flashback as a part</p>
<p>of your life and go, oh my God, what was I doing 30 years ago?</p>
<p>What was I doing when I used to listen to that song every day?</p>
<p>And I think it has, it&rsquo;s in a way, it&rsquo;s an emotional time machine if you think about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And I think I speak in the book about these, the things that we make are like diary entries.</p>
<p>And one of the things that&rsquo;s helpful about knowing that is so many artists are precious</p>
<p>about the things they&rsquo;re making to a point where it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to put anything</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>There are some great artists who, you know, have great success and then it might be three</p>
<p>or four or five years between projects and it&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re not great and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not because they can&rsquo;t come up with beautiful things to share during that window of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually some issue of not feeling, feeling like it&rsquo;s not good enough, feeling like it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t portray who they are forever.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not historically the best work they believe they could ever</p>
<p>do in their life and if they don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s the best work they could ever historically</p>
<p>do in their life, then why share it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep working on it until it&rsquo;s the best thing in history.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t really work that way because it, these are diary entries and all it can</p>
<p>be is a true reflection of who we are today.</p>
<p>And if we wait too long, it starts losing its charge.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get better with time.</p>
<p>Your relationship to it changes because the thing that the person who started the project</p>
<p>and the person who&rsquo;s finishing the project are two different people.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re finishing and you&rsquo;re not related to the person who started the project, it</p>
<p>can be very difficult to finish it.</p>
<p>And you can feel like, well, this isn&rsquo;t really for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for you six months ago or it&rsquo;s for you one year ago.</p>
<p>And finding those, those ways in where if you made something and you feel excited enough</p>
<p>to play it for your friend, that&rsquo;s a good time to put it out into the world.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re excited enough to play it for your friend, that&rsquo;s the highest level of it</p>
<p>being ready.</p>
<p>I almost feel like that&rsquo;s directed at us a little bit because it describes our situation</p>
<p>pretty darn well.</p>
<p>Let me, let me throw another dynamic though, that comes into play that I know you&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>familiar with, but from an artistic standpoint, there&rsquo;s that, you know, when you put out something</p>
<p>that is, and I don&rsquo;t like anything I do, so, I mean, I&rsquo;m not the right person to talk,</p>
<p>but if you put out something and people enjoy it and they say, wow, this is the best thing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever done or whatever they might say.</p>
<p>The problem is with the following work is that the best work you&rsquo;ve ever done becomes</p>
<p>the expectation for the next work and all the subsequent work, right?</p>
<p>In other words, if you have an A paper or you hit your, or you&rsquo;re a salesman and you</p>
<p>hit your monthly quota and far exceed it, well, your next monthly quota is going to</p>
<p>have that as the baseline.</p>
<p>And so I always feel like there, you know, you&rsquo;re always chasing the dragon a little</p>
<p>bit on this thing.</p>
<p>And at some point you&rsquo;re going to hit a wall because there is no way to continually outdo</p>
<p>yourself forever.</p>
<p>And I feel like that becomes something that holds you up.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve, we&rsquo;ll sit on shows for months that would have been fine shows by our standards</p>
<p>eight or nine years ago, but the expectation level of the quality has been raised.</p>
<p>And truthfully, in our medium, if you go listen to podcasts in 2006, you know, the year after</p>
<p>we started, the quality level is so low that if I go listen to show one, two, three, four</p>
<p>hardcore history, they said they&rsquo;re cringy to me now, but at the time by the standards</p>
<p>in that day, they were considered good.</p>
<p>I know you work with a lot of artists who had a lot of previous success before you worked</p>
<p>with them.</p>
<p>How does one deal with this dynamic?</p>
<p>Because it seems to me to be absolutely ubiquitous in art.</p>
<p>The best way to say it is your old work isn&rsquo;t better or worse than your new work and your</p>
<p>new work isn&rsquo;t better or worse than your old work.</p>
<p>Your old work was a reflection of that time.</p>
<p>You said it, you said it yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in the context of the world that you were in, that was great.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t look at it as well.</p>
<p>I can go back to 2005 and redo something from then.</p>
<p>I mean, you could do a new episode now and it would probably be very different and probably</p>
<p>much more in depth and much more detail, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same thing as the thing</p>
<p>that happened in 2005 that is, as you said, Frozen in Amber.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s those, it&rsquo;s an iterative process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s those early ones that may not be at the same level that you&rsquo;re at now that allow you</p>
<p>to get to the level that you&rsquo;re at now.</p>
<p>And doing it in public is part of it.</p>
<p>The fact that those exist, the fact that there&rsquo;s a history there is part of the power of it,</p>
<p>that the growth exists, that you as an artist continue to make things and put them out.</p>
<p>And yes, all of us as artists are always trying to beat our past work, which is a very noble</p>
<p>and reasonable goal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so interested in trying to beat anyone else&rsquo;s work, but any possibility of beating</p>
<p>my own work is exciting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like any possibility of expanding what I&rsquo;m doing or finding a new way to do it or</p>
<p>to reach someone different than we were reaching before.</p>
<p>And when I say that, that never happens intentionally.</p>
<p>It always happens as an outgrowth of whatever new method we found of working that&rsquo;s exciting</p>
<p>us because I never do anything based on what I think the audience is going to think.</p>
<p>I always do it based on what I think.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the audience is going to think.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t assume what the audience is going to think.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m smart enough to assume what anyone else is going to think.</p>
<p>All I can do is be true to what I feel.</p>
<p>And I try to make things that I feel to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>And then, you know, you let the chips fall where they may.</p>
<p>Well, and the audience changes, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I mean, for example, I constantly have discussions with people where I&rsquo;ll play a piece of music</p>
<p>for them, usually something from my youth.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll, you know, take the Sex Pistols.</p>
<p>You play the Sex Pistols, which is Muzak now, basically, it&rsquo;s elevator music.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll play it for some young person or one of my kids, and they&rsquo;ll look at me and</p>
<p>go, OK, I don&rsquo;t really see the big deal.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t see the big deal because they weren&rsquo;t there when it came out.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t hit them the way it hit me because there&rsquo;s been 100,000 bands that have been</p>
<p>influenced by the Sex Pistols and have used elements of them since.</p>
<p>And as far as that kid is concerned, it sounds just like all that other stuff they&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>We always talk about what we&rsquo;re doing here and what every podcaster is doing is creating</p>
<p>something that is etched in digital stone.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s etched in digital stone, the various people that are going to come</p>
<p>across that inscription in stone may not even be alive yet.</p>
<p>And the way they&rsquo;re going to react to that work is going to be so different that there</p>
<p>would have been no way to try to create a work for someone 100 years from now.</p>
<p>You know, you mentioned Zeppelin, for example.</p>
<p>How could Led Zeppelin have known in 68 or 69 or 70 that what they were writing had to</p>
<p>stand the test of time, right?</p>
<p>Perhaps they had to just write for their contemporary era and let the chips historically</p>
<p>fall where they may?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All you can do is be in the moment.</p>
<p>All there is is the moment.</p>
<p>All there is is the present moment.</p>
<p>There is no past.</p>
<p>There is no future.</p>
<p>The benefit we have in the present, we can experience the past.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all it is.</p>
<p>And when we experience the past, we&rsquo;re not really experiencing the past.</p>
<p>One of the things I wanted to talk about with you, which is I don&rsquo;t know that we could ever</p>
<p>know anything about history.</p>
<p>How much can we know?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know about what happened last week from the sources we have telling us what</p>
<p>happened last week.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>So how can we possibly know what happened 300 years ago or 500 years ago or a thousand</p>
<p>years ago?</p>
<p>How can we know?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re stories.</p>
<p>We may like the stories.</p>
<p>That might be fine.</p>
<p>But at best, they&rsquo;re interesting stories.</p>
<p>History is a set of lies agreed upon, right?</p>
<p>Well, but you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Is that a known&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>History is a set of fables agreed upon.</p>
<p>I think Napoleon may have said that.</p>
<p>But every time I say, so-and-so said this, someone corrects me because that was wrong</p>
<p>too.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a perfect example of what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because this is a debate that historians have at the highest levels.</p>
<p>Can we really know any of this?</p>
<p>And the problem is, is eventually if you start to navel-gaze that long enough, you eliminate</p>
<p>the need for the historian at all, and it becomes a sort of a prophecy where you destroy</p>
<p>your own specialty.</p>
<p>I remember asking James Burke, the famous science historian, something to that effect.</p>
<p>And his answer, I kind of thought he was going to answer the way we&rsquo;re talking now, but instead</p>
<p>he shocked me by saying, no, we can know.</p>
<p>And a lot of this is cross-referencing, right?</p>
<p>So you say, if you just have one data point or one source, it&rsquo;s not that useful.</p>
<p>But if you can start to cross-reference it.</p>
<p>So imagine today the way our life is now and a future historian trying to disentangle all</p>
<p>the pieces.</p>
<p>Well, if the only thing that made it through the historical window was one news channel,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You would have a very different view of history than if the historian in the future could</p>
<p>cross-reference, you know, Fox News with NBC News with, you know, the more sources you</p>
<p>have, the more you&rsquo;re able to construct some sort of a connect the dots image that looks</p>
<p>like something if, but like this, this Viking show that we just completed, there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of times in the story where there&rsquo;s one person telling it to you, there is no cross-referencing,</p>
<p>there is no way to cross-check what you&rsquo;re reading.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful line that in a book by Pierre Briant on ancient history, and he started</p>
<p>the book off with a famous quote, and I forgot who said it, but he said, even if it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>true, you have to believe in ancient history.</p>
<p>And I think his point is, is that if you start questioning it too much, we don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t know anything, then there is no history.</p>
<p>And if there is no history, what, you know, how do you write anything about the past?</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;ve said is fundamentally true, but I&rsquo;m not sure what our choices in the matter</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And I think as long as we&rsquo;re taking these stories in as stories, and as it may have</p>
<p>been this way, or someone said it was this way, that&rsquo;s realistic.</p>
<p>But to think that this is what, that we know what happened, you know, something fairly</p>
<p>recent history, the JFK assassination, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I had a moment with you like this once, like I was telling you that I had</p>
<p>read something by a very well-known and respected music historian, and he had said something</p>
<p>about you and a famous musician, you know, maybe doing something once upon a time, and</p>
<p>I mentioned it to you, and you sat there with this look on your face, and you started rubbing</p>
<p>your chin, and you said, that&rsquo;s very interesting, because that never happened.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking, okay, now do I now discount everything I&rsquo;ve ever read from that</p>
<p>person?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t figure out, and it wasn&rsquo;t one of those things where he could have just gotten</p>
<p>something wrong.</p>
<p>It was an invention.</p>
<p>And I thought, okay, now what am I supposed to do with everything else this guy&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>written?</p>
<p>So you and I have had that moment where I got to look at the sources, and had I been</p>
<p>doing a show, I would have quoted that person verbatim as a source, and would have assumed</p>
<p>that what they said was true.</p>
<p>So I think that backs up what you just said a bit.</p>
<p>And to defend the show is, it&rsquo;s entertainment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thought-provoking.</p>
<p>One of the things that I love about what you do is you say that you&rsquo;re not a historian,</p>
<p>and I think that it&rsquo;s a bold thing to say, and it&rsquo;s a true thing to say, and I&rsquo;m wondering</p>
<p>if anyone who calls themselves a historian is actually telling the truth.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I say I don&rsquo;t know anything about music.</p>
<p>I really think so much of our downfall is in thinking we know things we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And this can lead to an interesting thing, an interesting conversation about belief.</p>
<p>And I got this from listening to your new podcast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a part where you&rsquo;re talking about belief and the power of belief.</p>
<p>There was a religious belief that fueled great strength in ‚Äì</p>
<p>This is the Vikings, right, creating a sort of a ‚Äì yeah, their belief in Valhalla and</p>
<p>all those sorts of things, right, eating at the table with Odin.</p>
<p>So whether Valhalla does or doesn&rsquo;t exist, the power of believing in Valhalla gave the</p>
<p>Vikings a strength and power, maybe fortitude would be the word, that others didn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>And so much of what we do as creative people is rooted in belief.</p>
<p>Now it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about belief.</p>
<p>And we believe things into existence as artists, as creative people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re believing things into existence.</p>
<p>If we didn&rsquo;t believe ‚Äì they don&rsquo;t exist, and without our belief, they will never exist.</p>
<p>But through our belief, we make the things that we make and get to share them.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the concept, and we talked about this in some of the history shows, too, of</p>
<p>magic.</p>
<p>And I think I had said something to the effect once, probably in a more eloquent way, that</p>
<p>just because you and I don&rsquo;t believe in, you know, in air quotes, magic, doesn&rsquo;t help us</p>
<p>if the people in the past in an entire society did, because the collective belief in magic</p>
<p>has a power to create a reality based on that, right?</p>
<p>If you believe that water is hot instead of cold when, you know, you dip your feet in</p>
<p>the ocean, you&rsquo;re going to base everything that you base on that idea differently, and</p>
<p>it creates a different reality based on something.</p>
<p>You could turn around today and go, well, all those people were completely deluded,</p>
<p>believing something that was completely untrue, but the reality that they created is based</p>
<p>on that magic or whatever.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t understand that, it&rsquo;s very hard to start getting into the mindset of</p>
<p>the people who lived once upon a time.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to go off to the Crusades and fight and die because God wills it, was</p>
<p>the saying that the Pope had said in the battle cry that everyone took up.</p>
<p>And if you believe that all your sins will be washed away if you go on this crusade,</p>
<p>we may think that&rsquo;s silly, but a lot of these people went and did that giant historical</p>
<p>thing because they believed in that level of magic.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right, this magic creates a belief that then impacts reality, even though the</p>
<p>magic itself may not be real.</p>
<p>And if it does impact reality, who&rsquo;s to say it&rsquo;s not real?</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>In some ways, the fact- Well, the impact is real for sure, right?</p>
<p>The impact is real.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So then it&rsquo;s like, where&rsquo;s the line?</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It seems like if you believe in magic and magic happens because you believe in it, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>to say magic&rsquo;s not real?</p>
<p>Well, and now we&rsquo;re talking about something that I think dovetails well into the point</p>
<p>of your book, creativity.</p>
<p>And the idea, you know, those of us, I think it was comedian Jan Hooks was talking about</p>
<p>once the difference between just fooling around creatively when there&rsquo;s nothing at stake and</p>
<p>then getting to a point where you realize, wait a minute, this is what&rsquo;s putting food</p>
<p>on the table for me.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of important that I not just understand it, but try to figure out ways</p>
<p>to improve it, have it more often, intensify it.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about the muse and the idea behind the muse.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, the muse goes back to ancient Greek history and mythology, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about this idea that there is something out there that influences people&rsquo;s art and</p>
<p>creation and it&rsquo;s- Well, why don&rsquo;t you explain it, Rick?</p>
<p>What is the muse when you hear that term?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s coming from outside of ourselves that inspires us to make the</p>
<p>things that we make.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a uncontrollable magical element in the muse.</p>
<p>Sometimes we think of the muse as a female character.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s how it was in ancient times, that&rsquo;s how it was thought of.</p>
<p>But now when we say the muse, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be in human form.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the energy that- It&rsquo;s like the breath within the breath.</p>
<p>So this is interesting to me right away, because you had sent me a couple of different reviews</p>
<p>about your book.</p>
<p>And one was a very positive one about all the great things that are in it, and then</p>
<p>another one was that could have been written by a very terra firma sort of person who thought-</p>
<p>I think the term they used was that it was a little woo-woo.</p>
<p>But when I think of where this creativity comes from, I think it is almost inherently</p>
<p>this woo-woo concept, because we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t- I mean, you can say you can create with a sort of a connect the dots.</p>
<p>I mean, when you and I were kids, we had all these models, model airplanes or whatever,</p>
<p>and they came with these directions that said, you know, put slot A into section B or whatever.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s people that think that you can do that with creativity.</p>
<p>But the magic comes with that thing where all of a sudden you&rsquo;re stuck on something</p>
<p>and then boom, this weird thing out of nowhere hits and you go, well, where did that come</p>
<p>from?</p>
<p>I mean, isn&rsquo;t there something sort of woo-woo in the whole creation process, no matter what</p>
<p>your own sort of bedrock personal beliefs on things like magic and whatever are?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what the muse sort of represents, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always magical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always spiritual.</p>
<p>How often does it occur, I&rsquo;ve never asked you this, do you say something in your improvisation</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re working on your show?</p>
<p>How often do you say something and surprise yourself by what you&rsquo;ve said?</p>
<p>That happens pretty often, actually.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of how we sort of inch our way to where we&rsquo;re going, because I never</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>You know, what we do is like sculpting out of clay, but you have no conception what you</p>
<p>want to make.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;re making it, you yourself are looking at it going, hmm, this kind of looks</p>
<p>like this or this kind.</p>
<p>And some part of you may say, well, it&rsquo;s kind of looking like a dog, so I think I&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>a dog.</p>
<p>But if you go that route, you know, a month down the road, you&rsquo;re going to go, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really think it looks that much like a dog.</p>
<p>I put seven legs on it, so maybe it&rsquo;s a horse or, you know, I mean, I think that that process</p>
<p>of discovery, when you&rsquo;re especially doing it the way we do it, where there&rsquo;s no scripts</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all improv, you find out, I mean, this is where your book really resonated with</p>
<p>me because we rely on that sort of weird magical thing every step of the way.</p>
<p>I mean, some writers will write something and the magic happens during the writing process.</p>
<p>And then during the recording process, there&rsquo;s no magic because the magic happened when you</p>
<p>were writing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t write.</p>
<p>So the magic happens while we&rsquo;re recording.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we end up, I mean, the show that&rsquo;s part one that we just put out recently</p>
<p>of this Viking thing, I thought that was only going to be part one.</p>
<p>And I thought it&rsquo;d be about four hours.</p>
<p>Well, of course, you know, it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that was no planning at all.</p>
<p>We really do take it where it takes us.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s part of that magic you were just talking about.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of why the show is as great as it is and as different as it is.</p>
<p>And for the people who don&rsquo;t understand the magic, they couldn&rsquo;t bring out this kind of</p>
<p>material because they think it&rsquo;s just an intellectual act.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m learning something and I&rsquo;m regurgitating what I&rsquo;m learning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some whole other thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve taken in a tremendous amount of data to start with, to work from, and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>weaving your way through it as a jazz artist, essentially.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing a jazz saxophone solo with your voice, with all of these melodies, which would</p>
<p>be the stories that you have.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re stringing together, not with your, I don&rsquo;t remember which is the left side and</p>
<p>which is the right side of the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the side of the brain that does the thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not coming from thinking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s thinking involved, but that&rsquo;s not primarily what&rsquo;s going on in this process.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny because I think sometimes this is a lens question or the way you explain</p>
<p>a question.</p>
<p>So, for example, if I got some, and I want to say engineer, but then I can hear engineers</p>
<p>saying, there&rsquo;s so much creativity involved in engineering, Dan, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about.</p>
<p>But I try to think of the most terra firma people that I can think of and how one would</p>
<p>explain creativity from their point of view.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a Steve Jobs explanation of creativity.</p>
<p>And I juxtaposed his definition next to one of yours.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re both saying the same thing from a different viewpoint.</p>
<p>So, the Steve Jobs quote is the famous one if you&rsquo;ve ever read books on Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>He said, creativity is just connecting things.</p>
<p>When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t really do it.</p>
<p>They just saw something.</p>
<p>It seemed obvious to them after a while.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because they were able to connect experiences they&rsquo;ve had and synthesize new things.</p>
<p>And the reason they were able to do that was that they&rsquo;ve had more experiences or they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>thought more about their experiences than other people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s too rare a commodity.</p>
<p>A lot of people in our industry haven&rsquo;t had very diverse experiences, so they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough dots to connect.</p>
<p>And they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem.</p>
<p>The broader one&rsquo;s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s sort of maybe an engineer&rsquo;s way of explaining the magic without saying magic.</p>
<p>And you said, as artists, we aim to live in a way in which we see the extraordinary</p>
<p>hidden in the seemingly mundane, then challenge ourselves to share what we see in a way that</p>
<p>allows others a glimpse of this remarkable beauty.</p>
<p>Yours is an almost zen way of explaining a very terra firma Steve Jobs, I have a BMW</p>
<p>in the lobby so you&rsquo;ll be inspired kind of way.</p>
<p>Is this just a question of different people trying to explain magic with different terms?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re saying exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;re choosing different metaphors, but we&rsquo;re saying the same thing.</p>
<p>So let me ask, this gets me to you a little bit, because, you know, one of the things</p>
<p>about your book is it&rsquo;s a real reflection, maybe inevitably, of what it&rsquo;s like to be</p>
<p>talking to you personally.</p>
<p>And you know, there&rsquo;s a we talked about history earlier and how many myths and weirdness and</p>
<p>things that they get wrong.</p>
<p>And that can include biography like about yourself.</p>
<p>But there is a, let&rsquo;s call it a snazzy candy coating wrapper around who you are, Rick,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got a very sort of a zen feel to it.</p>
<p>Where does that come from?</p>
<p>I mean, were you this way in high school?</p>
<p>I mean, where does this what is this tone that one associates in popular culture with</p>
<p>Rick Rubin come from?</p>
<p>I think the fact that it&rsquo;s known that I learned to meditate when I was young, and that I speak</p>
<p>of it in as having such a profound impact on my life probably is part of it.</p>
<p>The beard is another part, which was not intentional in any way.</p>
<p>Just when I was in college, I decided to stop shaving.</p>
<p>And this is what happens when you if you decide to stop shaving.</p>
<p>But there was no thought behind it or method behind it.</p>
<p>Yes, but when I&rsquo;m with you, forget the beard, forget the imaging.</p>
<p>You have a very like when we&rsquo;ll talk about creativity, your approach to it is so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very Buddhistic kind of feel to the way you approach opening up your soul to the universe</p>
<p>so that it can allow this magic in.</p>
<p>Is that how you worked in your very early years?</p>
<p>I mean, were you having conversations with the Beastie Boys like like the kind of conversations</p>
<p>you have with bands now about magic and creativity and and the source of things like new ideas?</p>
<p>I probably didn&rsquo;t have conversations with it with anyone about it then.</p>
<p>But I recognize that that was the underpinning of why the things that got made got made.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been.</p>
<p>I might not have understood how magical it was then.</p>
<p>But over time, the more the more I&rsquo;ve been exposed to it, the more obvious it is that</p>
<p>everything we&rsquo;re dealing in is magic and it&rsquo;s beyond us.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re really blessed to be part of this this process.</p>
<p>And and to to live in a way that allows it to come through us, which is a real it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t come easily, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>It does and it doesn&rsquo;t come easily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to talk about this.</p>
<p>So I took so long to write the book.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about things that are really hard to explain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hard to understand.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hard to explain.</p>
<p>Well, and that&rsquo;s why I think I got so much out of it, because I think when you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>through me, I joked with you that we have a whole bunch of shorthand terms in house</p>
<p>here for when this happens or how we&rsquo;re going to deal with that.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all things that that you would invent the terms as needed over the years.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;m reading your book, I&rsquo;m going, well, Rick, Rick&rsquo;s talking about these same</p>
<p>terms.</p>
<p>I mean, these are the sorts of things that if you&rsquo;ve ever been working and you&rsquo;ve encountered</p>
<p>what you mentioned in the book, you nod your head and you go, oh, yes, I know what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all about.</p>
<p>I wonder if it would have the same sort of impact on somebody who&rsquo;s reading your book</p>
<p>as a as a jumping off point for starting.</p>
<p>And they know none of these things through their own experience.</p>
<p>So they can&rsquo;t nod their head.</p>
<p>They just have to sort of take it on faith.</p>
<p>How you know.</p>
<p>Do you read much about the creativity itself?</p>
<p>Because I find myself buying books on this as an attempt to try to figure out how to</p>
<p>amplify or or enhance or expand my own creativity.</p>
<p>Do you buy books on creativity?</p>
<p>Rick, do you study creativity?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m at the time that I decided to work on this book, which was probably about eight</p>
<p>years ago, I went to.</p>
<p>And you did it with Neil, right?</p>
<p>You did it with Neil.</p>
<p>Well, when I first started, no, I started with the first writer that I worked with.</p>
<p>His name was Verlin Klinkenborg.</p>
<p>And I worked with him for four years.</p>
<p>And Neil was involved from the beginning, but he wasn&rsquo;t working on the book with me.</p>
<p>He was just my friend who would continue the interviews because Verlin was at Yale teaching.</p>
<p>So Verlin was in another place.</p>
<p>He came, we spent 10 days together, me and Verlin.</p>
<p>He interviewed me a lot and we started like getting to the material.</p>
<p>And then when Verlin left, he said, okay, I&rsquo;ll start working on what we talked about.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I feel like we haven&rsquo;t scratched the surface of the information.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll keep doing what we were doing with Neil.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll send you all the material.</p>
<p>So Neil was involved from on a content capture basis from the beginning.</p>
<p>But Verlin was originally the professional writer involved.</p>
<p>And this is Neil Strauss, the guy, by the way, folks, Neil Strauss is the guy who wrote</p>
<p>the book with Rick.</p>
<p>I should have said that ahead of time.</p>
<p>So back to the original question, do you read about creativity?</p>
<p>Do you study the concept or is this just something where it&rsquo;s almost studying magic in a weird</p>
<p>way might be as important as studying history that you don&rsquo;t believe happened?</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Well, I started telling that story because in eight years ago, when I decided I want</p>
<p>to write a book about creativity, I went to BookSoup, which is a great bookstore in</p>
<p>Los Angeles.</p>
<p>My favorite bookstore.</p>
<p>Wonderful bookstore.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually one of the reasons that I moved to Los Angeles, BookSoup.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kidding me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>At the time, believe it or not, in, I guess it would have been 1989 and 1990, while New</p>
<p>York was the city that never sleeps, there were no bookstores that were open late at</p>
<p>night.</p>
<p>And my life was, I was living a late schedule at that time.</p>
<p>And BookSoup was open till midnight.</p>
<p>And when I first came to California and I would go to BookSoup pretty much most evenings,</p>
<p>I would go to Tower Records on one side of the street and then I would go to BookSoup</p>
<p>on the other side.</p>
<p>They were both open till midnight.</p>
<p>And when I start, and I never really liked California, once I realized that there was</p>
<p>a BookSoup, there was BookSoup, and it was open till midnight, it kind of changed my</p>
<p>view of California because I really like spending a lot of time in bookstores.</p>
<p>And I could not do that in New York.</p>
<p>BookSoup is not a big bookstore either.</p>
<p>You add BookSoup to the Bodhi Tree down there and they had a couple of fun little places</p>
<p>in LA at the time.</p>
<p>I went to the Bodhi Tree at least three times a week, the entire, from the day I found it</p>
<p>until it closed.</p>
<p>My favorite bookstore.</p>
<p>Yeah, very unusual.</p>
<p>The reason I was telling the story about BookSoup is eight years ago, I decided I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>write a book about creativity and I think, okay, I&rsquo;ll do a little research.</p>
<p>Let me see what other books about creativity there are.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, there were no books about creativity.</p>
<p>There was actually one, only one, and it was by Twyla Tharp, the choreographer, and</p>
<p>it was called The Something Habit, The Art Habit.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what it was called now.</p>
<p>But that was the only one I could find.</p>
<p>And it was really rooted in dancing, it was really about dancing.</p>
<p>But that was the only one I could find.</p>
<p>And since the idea, it&rsquo;s one of the things I talk about in the book, I never made the</p>
<p>connection before, this specific connection.</p>
<p>But when you have an idea for something, if you don&rsquo;t move on it, or if you don&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>on it quickly, someone else is going to do it.</p>
<p>Not because they&rsquo;re stealing your idea.</p>
<p>All the books that have come out about creativity since eight years ago when I started, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not people who stole my idea.</p>
<p>It just means this is something that there&rsquo;s a real need for.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real interest in this.</p>
<p>And so during that time, I would on occasion look at creativity books that came out, but</p>
<p>anytime there was one, I would read a little bit of it and I would say, oh, this is so</p>
<p>not what I want.</p>
<p>Like, this is not what I want.</p>
<p>I was looking for a book closer to the creative act, which didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s one other, I don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;d call it a creativity book, but it&rsquo;s a book</p>
<p>about writing called, oh, the Julia Cameron book, The Artist Way.</p>
<p>The Artist Way is a book to get over writer&rsquo;s block and it&rsquo;s primarily for writers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another book that I think is now 25 years old.</p>
<p>I guess now we think of it as a creativity book, but at the time when there was, before</p>
<p>there was a genre of creativity books, it was a book on how to write.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m looking at, I wrote down a couple of different examples of ways one might write</p>
<p>a book on creativity, write what the different approaches, like I have one called Daily Habits</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a book about what other people who are creative do to get into the right frame</p>
<p>of mind and the right place.</p>
<p>There are more creative books that are a little like the A to B to C, you know, you do this,</p>
<p>you do that.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s many that have that sort of metaphysical sort of feel to it.</p>
<p>I noticed in yours that you grab a little bit from each of these approaches, right?</p>
<p>At one point it will seem like you&rsquo;re reading something very amorphous and we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the universe and the muse and all these sorts of things.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden you&rsquo;ll turn the page and you have a book on habits or if something</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t working, you have practical advice like try speeding it up, try slowing it down.</p>
<p>I mean, things that I would consider to be more what a grounded engineer would want.</p>
<p>I want some instructions on this and you include those as well.</p>
<p>Is there any one way to teach people about creativity or must you hit them from multiple</p>
<p>different angles because everyone&rsquo;s different?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think that you can teach people about creativity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what the book is, it&rsquo;s a glimpse into a way of thinking about things that allow</p>
<p>you to be creative.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call it teaching creativity though.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s about learning to be yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the book&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>The book&rsquo;s about learning to be yourself and there are aspects in learning to be yourself</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to be making something where having practical engineer-like advice is helpful.</p>
<p>And I think that those things are helpful.</p>
<p>When I read the book, those are the least interesting parts of the book to me.</p>
<p>But for some people it&rsquo;s the best part.</p>
<p>Those are the most helpful parts.</p>
<p>I know that the parts that are less grounded are the ones that have the power to change</p>
<p>things in a big way.</p>
<p>Now that said, a small positive habit can change your life.</p>
<p>So deciding to, what was an example of a practical one, taking three big breaths when you wake</p>
<p>up in the morning can have great power as well.</p>
<p>The ones that change the way you think about the world I think are the ones that allow</p>
<p>you to access the real creative spirit that I want to say where the work starts doing</p>
<p>itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny thing to say because it&rsquo;s the hardest work in the world, you&rsquo;d never stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most full-time job you could ever have.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s working, it happens by itself.</p>
<p>Yeah, you go from a moment where you&rsquo;re, you know, and this can, the order can change.</p>
<p>Sometimes it starts by pulling you and then you push and other times you&rsquo;re pushing and</p>
<p>then eventually it takes over and pulls.</p>
<p>And you know, we had mentioned earlier, I mean, when I was doing improv many, many years</p>
<p>ago, I remember a teacher who was helping teach us who was saying the more you do this,</p>
<p>the more you will walk around 24 hours a day, seven days a week, starting to find little</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s like a muscle that you develop.</p>
<p>And over time you become very good at ruminating when you&rsquo;re not working about the various</p>
<p>seeds of things that you&rsquo;ll need when you work to draw from.</p>
<p>You know, and I&rsquo;ve maybe unfairly, you know, I use my engineer example, but maybe unfairly</p>
<p>sectioned off creativity as something painters do or musicians do or writers do.</p>
<p>But in reality, I mean, this entire civilization that we&rsquo;ve built over thousands of years involves</p>
<p>creativity on every level.</p>
<p>I mean, an engineer is a perfect example.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tons of creativity that goes into designing a new car, for example, but we only</p>
<p>think perhaps of being Mozart or Monet or someone like that.</p>
<p>But I mean, I was watching a special the other day on primates and they were showing how</p>
<p>these primates use creativity to develop solutions to problems they have.</p>
<p>So this is almost an innate quality, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all creative beings.</p>
<p>We do it every day.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t survive without creativity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that has allowed us to flourish as a species has been our creative nature.</p>
<p>So let me talk about building layers, because I thought about this in terms of creativity.</p>
<p>I thought about the difference between somebody and maybe this can get into more of a hardcore</p>
<p>history sort of view of this.</p>
<p>But I mean, I thought about how your creativity is enhanced by being exposed to other people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creative works.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;d mentioned this to you earlier, like if when I was a kid, I watched every</p>
<p>Twilight Zone episode and all the Twilight Zone episodes have these wonderful writers</p>
<p>who write from weird angles that make little popping sounds in your brain as you start</p>
<p>thinking about, and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re supposed to do, as you start thinking about the very</p>
<p>interesting, weird concepts that they write about.</p>
<p>But the fact that I have a couple hundred or however many it is, Twilight Zone episodes</p>
<p>in my brain, sort of adding a layer of examples of creativity, little jumping off points.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like then when I&rsquo;m doing my work, it&rsquo;s infused by that in a way that if</p>
<p>I was a person in the Middle Ages trying to write something, and yet I had none of those</p>
<p>things as part of the foundation, you know, to sort of infuse my writing, that the writing</p>
<p>would be different.</p>
<p>How much of what we do today is, and I think you said it, you said, I&rsquo;m looking at the</p>
<p>exact quote.</p>
<p>You had talked about, nothing begins with us, you said in your book.</p>
<p>The more we pay attention, the more we begin to realize that all the work we ever do is</p>
<p>a collaboration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a collaboration with the art that came before you.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating concept for me because, you know, it ties you into works that you</p>
<p>have no connection with.</p>
<p>I mentioned The Stones and Exile on Main Street, but the fact that I listened to The Stones</p>
<p>and Exile on Main Street somehow unconsciously influences what I do.</p>
<p>Can you talk about this a little bit?</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that we&rsquo;re all building upon, you know, we all stand on the shoulders of</p>
<p>giants as the old saying goes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re standing on the shoulders of giants and everyone else.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking in whatever we notice on a daily basis.</p>
<p>It could be a great movie, great television show, but it also could be the way the light</p>
<p>reflects off of a building that we&rsquo;re looking at and how the light changes over the course</p>
<p>of the day.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re driving and sometimes we have to put down the little flap because the sun&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in our eyes.</p>
<p>Why is it at that time of day?</p>
<p>How does it change the way we perceive everything?</p>
<p>How much more difficult is it to drive based on the sun&rsquo;s position?</p>
<p>How different is it to drive at night than in the day?</p>
<p>How different is it to drive at night with your lights off instead of your lights on?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always working in concert with everything else that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Everything that we notice, everything that we see.</p>
<p>And all of the great work that&rsquo;s come before us definitely plays a role.</p>
<p>Anything, anytime we see something or read something that changes our mind about something,</p>
<p>changes our mind about something, we&rsquo;re now a new person.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re moving through the world as this new person.</p>
<p>And every day we&rsquo;re new people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some part of us that&rsquo;s the same and there&rsquo;s some part of us that&rsquo;s always changing.</p>
<p>And when we come into this world, I believe we come in as more of a blank slate.</p>
<p>And then through the things that our parents read to us as children or the sounds of music</p>
<p>of the day that happens to be playing.</p>
<p>And then once we start choosing the things for ourselves, the books that we choose to</p>
<p>read or the TV shows that we choose to watch or the movies we choose to watch or the museums</p>
<p>we choose to go to or the places we choose to travel to and the things we choose to see.</p>
<p>All of those things impact us.</p>
<p>And when we&rsquo;re making whatever it is that we&rsquo;re making, when we&rsquo;re making dinner, all</p>
<p>of that that came before us goes into the choices we make.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a conscious thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re made up of these experiences and these experiences that have either pulled us in</p>
<p>or pushed us away.</p>
<p>Great example would be the movie Jaws.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know this, but people were not afraid of sharks before the movie</p>
<p>Jaws.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a percentage of the population that are afraid to go swimming in the ocean</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re afraid of sharks, whether it&rsquo;s a shark infested area or not, all because</p>
<p>of a movie.</p>
<p>It changed our world to be afraid of sharks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you brought that movie up too, because there&rsquo;s a wonderful creative aspect to that</p>
<p>movie that I always use as an example in my own work, which is, and many people may not</p>
<p>know this, but the shark didn&rsquo;t work, right?</p>
<p>The mechanical shark rarely worked.</p>
<p>And so Spielberg, who had all of these ideas for scenes where the shark was going to appear,</p>
<p>had to figure out ways to write the scenes without the shark because the shark so rarely</p>
<p>was available.</p>
<p>And it turned out that by doing that, it created a building suspense in the film that wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there in the original treatment for the movie, because they assumed you&rsquo;d have a shark to</p>
<p>work with, and it worked out better because of it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost a turning lemons into lemonade kind of an idea there that I, and we do that</p>
<p>all the time in the works, right?</p>
<p>Creative ways around problems that crop up and all this.</p>
<p>I wanted, you know, because we had talked just a second ago about how, maybe call it</p>
<p>an advantage that people right now have over people a long time ago, because we have all</p>
<p>these other works that we can draw on and that influence us.</p>
<p>And when you were talking, all I could think of is the Pink Floyd lyric, you know, where</p>
<p>it says, all that you touch and all that you see is all your life will ever be, you know,</p>
<p>and all these things that make up who we are.</p>
<p>But you had said in the book, something that I think about all the time.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d said, and I&rsquo;m quoting, not using my big quote voice or anything, but there</p>
<p>are those who approach the opportunities of each day like crossing items off a to-do</p>
<p>list instead of truly engaging and participating with all of themselves.</p>
<p>Our continual quest for efficiency discourages looking too deeply.</p>
<p>The pressure to deliver doesn&rsquo;t grant us time to consider all possibilities, yet it is through</p>
<p>deliberate action and repetition that we gain deeper insight.</p>
<p>And I think all the time about how, you know, because we have so many things to do and so</p>
<p>many distractions, and we&rsquo;re so much more easily bored that we don&rsquo;t perhaps, and when</p>
<p>I say we, I don&rsquo;t mean every individual, because obviously there are exceptions, but I think</p>
<p>most of us think less deeply and concentrate less intensely than we otherwise might.</p>
<p>And I wonder if there&rsquo;s any downstream societal effects from something like that, right?</p>
<p>I mean, someone was telling me the other day, someone came, a worker came to do some stuff</p>
<p>in my house, and he looked up on the bookshelves and said how happy he was to see books on</p>
<p>the bookshelf.</p>
<p>And I said to him, what else would you put on a bookshelf?</p>
<p>And he goes, I go into houses all the time, there aren&rsquo;t any books in them anymore.</p>
<p>And I wonder what the downstream impact on us all from less deep thinking, less deep</p>
<p>concentration, less books and all that will be.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe one could make an argument that from a standpoint of deep human creativity</p>
<p>and deep human thinking, that people in the past had a somewhat edge on us now.</p>
<p>Does that ever occur to you, this idea of just, I mean, monks could sit there and contemplate</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do that very much anymore.</p>
<p>Is there a cost to that?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s both a cost to the lack of contemplation and to the lack of trusted sources of information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you a story.</p>
<p>I was listening to, I don&rsquo;t know much about classical music.</p>
<p>I like classical music very much, but I don&rsquo;t know much about it.</p>
<p>And I was listening to a classical radio station and a piece of music came on that was a chanting,</p>
<p>like a beautiful piece of religious music.</p>
<p>And I shazammed the piece of music.</p>
<p>And what came up in the shazam was, it was the piece of music, but it wasn&rsquo;t the recording</p>
<p>that I heard.</p>
<p>And if you know much about classical music, like now, if you want the Rolling Stones song</p>
<p>Painted Black, you look up Painted Black, you&rsquo;ll find the Rolling Stones version.</p>
<p>There may be one or two other cover versions, I&rsquo;m not sure, but not many.</p>
<p>Whereas in classical music, there&rsquo;s this canon of material and there are many, many, many</p>
<p>recordings.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the Bach recording of Bach pieces.</p>
<p>We have many different great orchestras and pianists versions of the Bach pieces or cellists</p>
<p>or violinists.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always being interpreted by a new artist who&rsquo;s collaborating with Bach and making</p>
<p>a new piece out of Bach&rsquo;s music.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re collaborating with a dead man.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so I heard this beautiful chanting piece and I found out the name of it.</p>
<p>But when I listened to the first one that came up, it wasn&rsquo;t the one that I heard and</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t have the same magic in it as the one that I heard, which is why I shazammed</p>
<p>it in the first place.</p>
<p>So I started thinking about, okay, how do I find the best recording of this?</p>
<p>Because now I know the name of the piece of music.</p>
<p>And I remembered back to my days of going to Book Soup and Tower Records on a, you know,</p>
<p>probably five nights a week between, you know, one or the other or both.</p>
<p>And there was the Tower Records on one side of the street and then on the side where Book</p>
<p>Soup was, two doors down, three doors down from Book Soup, was Tower Classical, which</p>
<p>also had videos.</p>
<p>And I went to Tower Classical and I would spend time in Tower Classical back in those</p>
<p>days and there was a book called The Penguin Guide to Classical Music.</p>
<p>And it was a big, probably a thousand pages, had a black cover, and there was a new edition</p>
<p>that came out every year.</p>
<p>And if there was a piece of classical music that you liked, you would reference the Penguin</p>
<p>book to find out what was considered the best recording.</p>
<p>And they would usually have the best recording and then another interesting recording.</p>
<p>And maybe if there was another one that was of interest, different than the best one,</p>
<p>or a reason to particularly care about an alternate version, they would have that too.</p>
<p>It was the definitive place to go to learn about classical music.</p>
<p>I would hear a piece, I would refer, I would go to the store, they had probably six or</p>
<p>eight copies of the book behind the desk, all dog-eared and well-worn, kind of like</p>
<p>phone books.</p>
<p>And you would take one and you could shop in the store and then if there was a piece</p>
<p>that you were excited about, you would read the section and then it would help you determine</p>
<p>which one to purchase because there might be a dozen versions of the same piece by different</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>So recently I had this experience hearing this chanting music and I look up the Penguin</p>
<p>book online and it turns out the Penguin book has not been in print since the, probably</p>
<p>1998 was the last year of the Penguin guide.</p>
<p>And then I researched, is there, what do people use now?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no answers.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get any information and the Penguin guide is no longer available.</p>
<p>And luckily, I know people at Penguin now because my book is being published by Penguin.</p>
<p>So I called my editor at Penguin and said, there was this book, this reference book that</p>
<p>was really important called The Penguin Guide to Classical Music.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer in print.</p>
<p>Why is it no longer in print?</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>And he researched and came back to me and he said, that one came out of the UK office.</p>
<p>Maybe you can speak to someone in the UK office.</p>
<p>And I called a friend who works at, an editor at Penguin in the UK and I asked them about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And they said, oh, that was part of.</p>
<p>And they said, back in 1998, a third of all of Penguin&rsquo;s books were reference books.</p>
<p>And starting in around 1998, we stopped doing reference books.</p>
<p>And I said, why do you stop doing reference books?</p>
<p>And they said, well, because of the internet.</p>
<p>And now with the internet, we don&rsquo;t need to put out these annual reference books because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just all online.</p>
<p>And that, it, thinking about that, it went from my concern about not being able to find</p>
<p>the piece of classical music I want, because the book&rsquo;s not in print, to realizing in 1998,</p>
<p>the Library of Alexandria got shut down.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re basically going on crowdsourced opinion for everything.</p>
<p>There is no, there is no definitive reference source anymore since the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>So let me, I think that leads into something I want to ask you about, because I, there</p>
<p>was an interesting thing on Twitter that somebody had shared some artwork and I retweeted it</p>
<p>thinking it was very interesting and then got some, not nasty, but disappointed responses</p>
<p>by people who were artists that were, that were upset that I was retweeting artificial</p>
<p>intelligence created art.</p>
<p>And I thought about this a little bit and I thought, well, what does Rick think about</p>
<p>artificial intelligence art?</p>
<p>I read a story the other day, and I think it&rsquo;s absolute BS at this point, but maybe</p>
<p>someday it won&rsquo;t be that, you know, a giant chunk of the content that we consume in two</p>
<p>years is going to be artificially created.</p>
<p>Will artificial intelligence ever make music better than people or art better than people?</p>
<p>I mean, what are your thoughts on this?</p>
<p>According to one of my artistic friends, this, this looming death threat ahead of them in</p>
<p>terms of what they do for a living, what are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like the conversation we had about magic and the muse.</p>
<p>And for people who don&rsquo;t, who aren&rsquo;t involved in working with the muse, they don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the muse and they think that&rsquo;s a made-up thing.</p>
<p>Art essentially is a, it&rsquo;s a made-up agreement.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a made-up agreement rooted in a concept, an idea.</p>
<p>The idea, the idea behind the piece is what, the piece is a outward reflection of a concept.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, the things that are being generated by AI are not rooted in an</p>
<p>original concept.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t really know that it functions as art functions.</p>
<p>It could be something decorative, it could be something interesting, it could be something</p>
<p>beautiful.</p>
<p>But I think what breathes in art, as I understand it, is what&rsquo;s behind it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s behind it is what makes it interesting.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that what&rsquo;s behind AI art is interesting.</p>
<p>If you put it up at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, if you put up some artificially created</p>
<p>works, and you put them up next to works by, you know, known artists, if it, you know,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s two sides to this, and I think you break it down very well in the book.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the side from the artist&rsquo;s side, and then there&rsquo;s the side from the one who is</p>
<p>viewing or experiencing the art.</p>
<p>I certainly think that what you just said applies to the artist&rsquo;s side of this.</p>
<p>But if the art ends up moving, and I&rsquo;m not trying to defend AI art, I&rsquo;m just thinking</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>But if the art ends up moving you somehow, is at least half of what we consider the goal</p>
<p>of art being accomplished?</p>
<p>I mean, if it ends up moving somebody on the receiving end?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>If it works for you, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no saying what is and isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>It does make it look like, you know, obviously for our shows, we use a fantastic artist,</p>
<p>a guy named Nick Lay.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t imagine ever replacing Nick Lay with some sort of computer algorithm, no matter</p>
<p>how nice and how fun it might be to play with.</p>
<p>I was online.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not technically sophisticated enough to know how to use it, but I was interested in</p>
<p>the idea of being able to set the parameters myself.</p>
<p>Say, I want to have the Starship Enterprise attacking Roman legionaries, and show me a</p>
<p>picture of that.</p>
<p>Somebody did it for the show we just did where I had mused about what it would be like if</p>
<p>the Vikings today attacked Laguna Beach or Malibu or something like that.</p>
<p>And somebody put it into the computer AI algorithm and spit out a picture of that.</p>
<p>And I remember looking at it going, holy cow.</p>
<p>Now, an artist could have painted that, certainly.</p>
<p>But to be able to sit there and just go, you know, I wonder what that would look like.</p>
<p>And 30 seconds later, it&rsquo;s there in front of you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very weird time we live in, Rick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super interesting and cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely something.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know that I would call it art.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So then that gets to something where, you know, we&rsquo;re going from like a visual, like</p>
<p>a painting slash medium.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to music with that same sort of thing.</p>
<p>So we go from a time period where you and I are young people growing up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the 70s.</p>
<p>And the really, really fantastic bands out there that everyone, you know, pays attention</p>
<p>to are virtuoso performers that took many, many years to create their talent and their</p>
<p>craft and everything.</p>
<p>And of course, punk came along and kind of blew that out of the whole water.</p>
<p>But now, fast forward, and then you get to the era where hip hop and rap music come around</p>
<p>where these people are the equivalent in my mind of like Homer and the old way that poetry</p>
<p>used to work, you know, in the ancient world.</p>
<p>And then you move forward to where we are today.</p>
<p>I mean, I used to joke that if I just had the loops with the drum track and if a certain</p>
<p>sort of groove and this and I could make music too.</p>
<p>And now people are.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the creativity that is almost like, let&rsquo;s call it cyborg</p>
<p>like where you have a human being working with a computer to create something?</p>
<p>I mean, what do you think of that kind of partnership, for lack of a better word?</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And I, the record that really changed the world in many ways was I Feel Love.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>From the 70s.</p>
<p>That was, yeah, that was done by Giorgio Moroder.</p>
<p>And the music was completely generated.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t played by people, although Giorgio did control the parameters of the machine</p>
<p>that was making the sounds.</p>
<p>But it was the first big record that was all generated through a machine.</p>
<p>And then Kraftwerk also, they were a prog rock band who turned into this machine based</p>
<p>band and it&rsquo;s incredible music.</p>
<p>And in both of those cases, there&rsquo;s a collaboration between the human and the machine, or how</p>
<p>the machine, how the way a human uses technology in a new way.</p>
<p>This was actually one of the things I wanted to ask you about, which was, is technology</p>
<p>always the reason that the next chapter of history differs from the last chapter of history?</p>
<p>Is it always a technological change that makes the next war different from the last war,</p>
<p>or the flow of information different than how it used to be?</p>
<p>Is it always a new technology comes and the world changes?</p>
<p>Is it always the case?</p>
<p>I think you could substitute several different things for technology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to disagree with that statement at all.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also differences in organization and approaches.</p>
<p>And, you know, and you might consider that to be part of the feedback loop between technological</p>
<p>changes and how humans then respond.</p>
<p>So we just talked about a possible collaboration between computers and human beings.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if you look, and there&rsquo;s also, just to be honest, there&rsquo;s also, and this</p>
<p>probably applies to art and music also, there&rsquo;s also this sort of dynamic of cause and effect.</p>
<p>So if, for example, we&rsquo;re going back to ancient warfare and you talk about the dominance of</p>
<p>a weapon system like Alexander the Great-type phalanxes, right, 16 ranks of people holding</p>
<p>21-foot spears in giant blocks of people, and you think to yourself, well, nothing&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ever going to defeat that.</p>
<p>Well, that prompts, of course, someone trying to come up with some way to do that.</p>
<p>And then when the Roman legions figure out the right approach to doing that, and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>partially technologically oriented, but it&rsquo;s also organizationally different.</p>
<p>And also from an artistic standpoint, if we can use military in an artistic sense, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also coming up with a creative solution to a problem that bedevils your military.</p>
<p>How do we defeat this giant phalanx?</p>
<p>And you come up with a way.</p>
<p>And when you do, it&rsquo;s a melding of technology, right, a certain kind of sword, for example,</p>
<p>with a certain kind of shield.</p>
<p>And then you mix that with certain changes in how you do things, right, smaller units</p>
<p>that are more independent, right, that can outflank you and handle terrain differently.</p>
<p>And all these things can combine because you have a need, right, cause and effect,</p>
<p>call and response, you have a need.</p>
<p>And those things fuse together in military history, we call it a weapons system.</p>
<p>But the weapons system is several things that are fused together.</p>
<p>And some of it is creativity.</p>
<p>Some of it is technology.</p>
<p>Some of it is the way you do things.</p>
<p>And then one might make the case, as we currently have drone warriors who are in, you know,</p>
<p>small rooms in places like Kansas who are fighting, though, from those small rooms on</p>
<p>screens that look like video games in the Middle East, right?</p>
<p>Does that change the nature of those people as warriors?</p>
<p>Well, I think it does.</p>
<p>But that, again, is a creation of a new weapons system, the melding of technology with approaches</p>
<p>with people.</p>
<p>I mean, if you imagine trying to hand that Roman legionary a device that looks like a</p>
<p>PlayStation controller and say, go out and kill the enemy with this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many years it takes before somebody can do that, because you would have</p>
<p>maybe had to grow up with video games.</p>
<p>You might have to have, you know, an entire personal relationship with the technology</p>
<p>in the state of the times to understand what you do.</p>
<p>So, in other words, I think the answer to your question is that technology is a part.</p>
<p>But what technology does is re-plastify, re-plasticify, if you will, the whole thing,</p>
<p>where then everything remolds itself around the new technology so that you can best use</p>
<p>the new technology to do whatever it was was prompted by the need to have a sort of</p>
<p>a cause and effect.</p>
<p>Does that make any sense?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great description.</p>
<p>I can remember you had an episode where you talked about the people of the steppe who</p>
<p>were great horsemen, and their advantage was they could do things while on horseback that</p>
<p>other people couldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, you know, you could try to‚ÄîI love that example, too, because people tried to emulate</p>
<p>it, and lots of countries had mounted archers.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a difference between a mounted archer that, you know, comes into your training</p>
<p>school at 21 years old, and you start teaching the art to, compared to a Comanche that grew</p>
<p>up on horseback so much that he&rsquo;s bow-legged, right?</p>
<p>So, I do think that‚Äîand to me, that&rsquo;s almost like, you know, that&rsquo;s when the‚Äîbefore</p>
<p>modern technology totally overwhelmed aspects of military history like that, there were</p>
<p>various peoples all around the world that could do different things that we would almost</p>
<p>consider to be minor superpowers today.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my favorite example, is the nomadic horse archers of the steppe that were supposedly</p>
<p>the inspiration for the Greek myth of the centaurs.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m looking over the notes now, and I&rsquo;m seeing that we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of</p>
<p>the stuff I wanted to cover, but it&rsquo;s a good time to take a break and just ask, you know,</p>
<p>where should we go?</p>
<p>What haven&rsquo;t we sort of delved into that would be fun or that you would like to see us go</p>
<p>into?</p>
<p>Because we got a lot of notes for this show, so the more notes we have, the harder it is</p>
<p>to pick anything out specifically.</p>
<p>Anything you&rsquo;d like to get into?</p>
<p>I mean, we didn&rsquo;t talk much about you as a background or any of the music that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been working on.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t talk about what you personally‚ÄîI mean, I was curious, because obviously being</p>
<p>a music producer, you&rsquo;re involved in art creation just in that role.</p>
<p>But is there anything else you&rsquo;re enjoying doing that I don&rsquo;t know about?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Do you sculpt?</p>
<p>Do you paint?</p>
<p>Do you‚Äîyou know, the Pricks haven&rsquo;t been around for a long time.</p>
<p>Is there a reunion in our future of that band?</p>
<p>Um, so maybe we could talk about anything that sounds like we didn&rsquo;t touch on already</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;d like to get into.</p>
<p>Okay, I have a load of things for us to talk about.</p>
<p>Yeah, why don&rsquo;t you drive the car for a minute and I&rsquo;ll try to follow.</p>
<p>Should I start?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about how we decide to continue or not continue what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And the reason I&rsquo;m asking you this is you had a podcast called Common Sense, which you</p>
<p>did alongside Hardcore History for a very long time, and then Common Sense stopped.</p>
<p>And I just want to talk about that.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, you know, the way you said it, Common Sense stopped might be a very good way to</p>
<p>describe why Common Sense stopped.</p>
<p>This gets sort of to the reason that we thought about talking about that sort of stuff to</p>
<p>begin with, and it was based on certain assumptions.</p>
<p>And for me, Hardcore History is a brand-new, created-for-a-podcast kind of program, whereas</p>
<p>Common Sense was something that is a deliberate evolution from what I used to do on the radio</p>
<p>for many, many years.</p>
<p>The tagline, you know, all those commercial talk radio shows always have a tagline when</p>
<p>you start the top of the hour, so anyone who hasn&rsquo;t heard you before gets sort of the one</p>
<p>sentence or two-sentence rundown about what you&rsquo;re all about.</p>
<p>And I can still remember it because I used to say it every day, you know, at the start</p>
<p>of all three hours, and it was, we are your independent alternative to the partisan voices</p>
<p>you normally hear.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;ll hear radio show hosts say stuff like that all the time, but they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>mean it.</p>
<p>We did mean it.</p>
<p>And my basic assumption was that, you know, there is huge problems in American government,</p>
<p>for example, that need to be addressed, but they are bipartisan problems.</p>
<p>And in order to address them, we almost have to subsume‚Äîtake our differences and put</p>
<p>them aside for now, because differences and disagreements are built into the pie in any</p>
<p>sort of representative system.</p>
<p>That comes with the territory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a bug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feature.</p>
<p>But we need to‚Äîyou know, and there&rsquo;s a‚Äînot to change subjects, because it&rsquo;s not a change</p>
<p>of subject, but there&rsquo;s a book by Yale‚Äîno, it&rsquo;s Har‚ÄîI think he&rsquo;s‚ÄîI can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>if it was Harvard or Yale, but Lawrence Lessig, who was a law professor, and he wrote a book</p>
<p>called Republic Lost, and I love the way he did it, because he assumed the same thing,</p>
<p>that these problems, these systemic problems require us all to sort of work together to</p>
<p>solve, right?</p>
<p>We need to fix the boat from sinking before we can talk about the direction we want the</p>
<p>boat to go.</p>
<p>And the way he did it was, one page‚Äîlet&rsquo;s imagine the left side of the page would be</p>
<p>the arguments for why we need to do this to people who are more liberal, and then on the</p>
<p>right side of the page would be the same arguments for why a conservative person would want to</p>
<p>do this also.</p>
<p>Implying that it&rsquo;s going to take both sides to fix systemic problems.</p>
<p>And The Common Sense Show was based on this, too, this idea that the problems that divide</p>
<p>us are less important than what we need to do.</p>
<p>I mean, think about‚Äîit&rsquo;s like an infrastructure thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re arguing about cleaning out the barn here so that we could continue to stable horses</p>
<p>in it.</p>
<p>And the assumption was that‚Äîyou know, for a while I thought we were winning on that</p>
<p>front.</p>
<p>I mean, I really thought we were.</p>
<p>And then things went sideways.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t go sideways because of anything any politician did or anything like that.</p>
<p>They went sideways, in yours truly&rsquo;s personal opinion, because of us.</p>
<p>And once I decided or thought or assumed or concluded that the problem was stemming from</p>
<p>us, well, then I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what the solution for that was.</p>
<p>Where there&rsquo;s all sorts of practical solutions for corruption in government and money in</p>
<p>politics and gerrymandering and long-serving politicians and partisanism.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what to do if the problem is us.</p>
<p>Now, I may be wrong about that, but that sort of shut down the program for me because the</p>
<p>entire premise under which I had labored, and not just with the podcast, but in the</p>
<p>entire radio show that it grew out of, right?</p>
<p>We are your alternatives, you know, to the partisan voices you normally hear.</p>
<p>If not proven, because it&rsquo;s possible that that was a correct statement in the middle</p>
<p>1990s.</p>
<p>But by the time the show sort of ended, if it&rsquo;s ended, I didn&rsquo;t feel like that was a</p>
<p>true statement anymore.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the old line?</p>
<p>You know, the problem, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of what I concluded.</p>
<p>And that sort of short-circuited my whole approach because I don&rsquo;t know how to fix us.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>I also would be really curious to hear if the show continued on based on that assumption,</p>
<p>which would be not so much you knowing what the solutions are, but being able to clearly</p>
<p>address the problems, to speak the problems as you see them, in the hopes that a solution</p>
<p>can be found.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes identifying the problem is the biggest piece of the creative puzzle.</p>
<p>Do you know if you see if we&rsquo;re working on a project and something&rsquo;s not right, and you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s not as good as it could be, or it&rsquo;s not making you feel something that you</p>
<p>thought it was going to make you feel?</p>
<p>Knowing what to do, you know, knowing why, where&rsquo;s the splinter in this?</p>
<p>Why am I not getting what I want from this is really helpful.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d be curious to hear that.</p>
<p>And the reason I asked also is because I&rsquo;ve been doing a podcast called Broken Record</p>
<p>about five years, I think.</p>
<p>And the way that that started was my friend Malcolm said he wanted to do a music podcast,</p>
<p>and if I wanted to do it with him.</p>
<p>So that seemed like a fun idea.</p>
<p>So I started doing that music podcast, and we did that for this time.</p>
<p>And then recently I&rsquo;ve come to realize, because originally I didn&rsquo;t think it was going to be</p>
<p>an interview show.</p>
<p>I thought it was going to be more like Revisionist History, more like his show.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is Malcolm Gladwell, by the way.</p>
<p>We should say.</p>
<p>Yeah, this was going to be more of a story.</p>
<p>I thought it was going to be more of a produced storytelling thing, which I think maybe all</p>
<p>of us thought at the beginning, yet it turned into being an interview show.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been really fun to do.</p>
<p>And because Broken Record is so specifically a music show, and it always set out to be</p>
<p>a music show, I realized I like to talk about things outside of music just as much.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been thinking I&rsquo;m going to start a podcast, which will be called Tetragrammaton.</p>
<p>And Tetragrammaton will be where I have the conversations about everything.</p>
<p>And at first I was thinking, maybe I need a specific podcast to talk about this subject</p>
<p>and another specific podcast to talk about this subject and another specific podcast</p>
<p>to talk about this subject.</p>
<p>And then I realized it&rsquo;s probably more interesting if I just have a podcast where I can talk</p>
<p>about anything that&rsquo;s interesting to me and talk to people who are interesting to me wherever</p>
<p>they come from.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what Tetragrammaton will be.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll end up having music interviews as well, because that&rsquo;s interesting to me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a piece of the puzzle instead of it being the puzzle.</p>
<p>I think that provides a lot more freedom for you to do it that way than common sense,</p>
<p>which was specifically geared towards a specific attitude.</p>
<p>And part of the problem, too, Rick, in the times in which we live, which I truly believe</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to look back on in 20 years as one of those times where people go crazy collectively.</p>
<p>I mean, the way that you and I would have looked back on the McCarthy era, you know,</p>
<p>from the 1980s, when those people just look crazy, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you just look back and you go, everything went nuts for a while.</p>
<p>I think those things happen in human history.</p>
<p>And the reason it comes into play in the common sense discussion is because part of the common</p>
<p>sense discussion was finding common ground.</p>
<p>But in an era where everyone goes nuts and both sides think that we are in apocalyptic</p>
<p>situations in terms of the stakes, then to try to walk some line where you try to see</p>
<p>both sides is the equivalent of trying to see both the Nazi and the communist viewpoint.</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t stand for that.</p>
<p>And I understand that.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I think 20 years from now, someone&rsquo;s going to say, why didn&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>do a little bit more trying to find common ground?</p>
<p>Because obviously, you know, everyone&rsquo;s being radicalized.</p>
<p>The ballast of society, which is the middle, has seen both edges, the left and the right</p>
<p>edge from the middle, be co-opted towards the extremes because people turn to the people</p>
<p>in the middle and go, now is a time for choosing, as the old line goes, right?</p>
<p>Now, wasn&rsquo;t that a Ronald Reagan thing from the early?</p>
<p>Now is a time for choosing.</p>
<p>Well, those of us who try to see both sides then become, instead of part of the solution,</p>
<p>in the minds of many during this crazy time, like the McCarthy era, we become part of the</p>
<p>problem in those people&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>And so I do think that 20 years from now, what you&rsquo;re saying about common sense might</p>
<p>absolutely be the way most people see it.</p>
<p>I get accused of things like both sides-erism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a word now, both sides-erism.</p>
<p>But in my mind, without both sides-erism, you have one-side-ism.</p>
<p>And how is that any different from what everybody else is doing?</p>
<p>I think the only reason that I wouldn&rsquo;t say that people today are crazier than they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever been, it&rsquo;s the inputs that they&rsquo;re getting that is getting this result.</p>
<p>So in some ways, the time for a common sense show that speaks reasonably and open-mindedly</p>
<p>about both sides is maybe the only thing that could ever solve the problem.</p>
<p>Because the finger-pointing and the reason people are so divided is because the stories</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re being told on each side.</p>
<p>The stories on each side are so against the other side instead of rooted in any reality</p>
<p>on both sides.</p>
<p>Well, and let me just say, I&rsquo;ve never had a problem with people speaking their true</p>
<p>beliefs, right?</p>
<p>My problem in the modern media landscape the way it is right now, and I have deep experience</p>
<p>in this subject, is the fact that so much of what is turning people against each other</p>
<p>and increasing the temperature in our society is done purely for commercial reasons, purely</p>
<p>for money.</p>
<p>They used to call it back when I was in radio, they used to call it heat, right?</p>
<p>Heat.</p>
<p>And heat equals engagement.</p>
<p>Now, heat means arguments, right?</p>
<p>And being deliberately provocative for the sake of creating things like anger.</p>
<p>Because I remember them explaining to me, you know, my whole radio career was me arguing</p>
<p>with consultants and program directors and everything like that because they would say</p>
<p>things like, we need to keep people listening through the break.</p>
<p>Well, how do you keep people listening through the break?</p>
<p>You piss them off, right?</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re angry and then they want to hear what comes.</p>
<p>And especially if you piss somebody off and then a caller calls up to deal, you know,</p>
<p>aggressively with you because you piss them off.</p>
<p>But your point of view was the one that the original listener liked, so they get pissed</p>
<p>off at the caller.</p>
<p>People love heat, heat, heat, heat.</p>
<p>They would scream at me, heat, heat, heat.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not legitimate heat, which I have no problem with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s manufactured heat.</p>
<p>You look at somebody, I mean, I&rsquo;ll give you a perfect, and I&rsquo;ll name names.</p>
<p>Tucker Carlson is a deliberate provocateur for money.</p>
<p>And that drives me crazy, especially drives me crazy when people consider themselves,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m using air quotes here, patriots, people who want to see the country, you know,</p>
<p>do well and succeed and thrive.</p>
<p>And yet for the sake of money, I can hear the program directors offstage going heat,</p>
<p>heat, heat.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a systematic problem, a systemic problem we&rsquo;ve created with a commercial</p>
<p>attachment to the creation of anger that would not otherwise be there.</p>
<p>And everybody does it because there&rsquo;s, you know, elements on the liberal side of thing,</p>
<p>the things that also benefit from the same problem, right?</p>
<p>The need to create ongoing engagement.</p>
<p>And now with the need, and you know this too, with the need to have little snippets that</p>
<p>you can then share on social media as a part of the way you produce a show, well, now you</p>
<p>want that heat to carry over into different mediums.</p>
<p>So I feel like the difference between, and this plays into what you&rsquo;re saying, right?</p>
<p>The fact that technology has then introduced something.</p>
<p>Can you imagine what somebody like a Joseph McCarthy would have been able to do with the</p>
<p>tools available today, right?</p>
<p>Or a Father Coughlin or somebody like that.</p>
<p>And so I think what you&rsquo;re seeing is, and I do think we almost recover from an earlier</p>
<p>era and then the technology changes, like we talked about with military things earlier,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a cause and effect.</p>
<p>But the new technology allows old monsters to be reconjured.</p>
<p>And I think when the spell is broken, like the McCarthy era spell was broken when the</p>
<p>famous representative said, you know, have you no shame.</p>
<p>And it was literally as though the cloud dissipated.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll probably have a moment like that again.</p>
<p>And just like you and I in the 1980s, looking back on this era, I think people 20 years</p>
<p>from now will think we were crazy right now.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, we&rsquo;re living in an era where we&rsquo;re all guinea pigs.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I&rsquo;m raising and you&rsquo;re raising children.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re raising children in this time period.</p>
<p>There is no precursor.</p>
<p>There is no example.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, when we were trying to figure out what age you allow your kid to start getting</p>
<p>on social media, you can&rsquo;t say, well, when I was a kid, we didn&rsquo;t get to be on social</p>
<p>media until we were 18.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re flying blind here and we&rsquo;re all as a society, a guinea pig to what happens</p>
<p>in a society with these sort of tools and not just the sort of tools that we can use</p>
<p>for ourselves.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s remember, when we were kids, the Soviet Union back in those days would freak</p>
<p>out because there was one radio station, Radio Free Europe, that used to beam across the</p>
<p>Iron Curtain and that would destabilize the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It would freak them out.</p>
<p>Well, can you imagine today?</p>
<p>Well, I think maybe we&rsquo;re almost seeing it with some of the stuff going on in the war</p>
<p>in Ukraine right now.</p>
<p>But these are, you know, we talked about technology.</p>
<p>These are new elements that humanity is trying to figure out how to deal with.</p>
<p>And the problem that I see is not the new technology, but the pace at which it continues</p>
<p>to change.</p>
<p>So just as society with its plasticity begins to react and change and adjust, technology</p>
<p>changes again.</p>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t too fast for we humans to handle, then it will be at some point.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some sense of when things change and we adopt to change quickly, we miss that</p>
<p>maybe the thing that we&rsquo;re changing to isn&rsquo;t better than, is not better than what we had</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes that&rsquo;s the case, or sometimes there&rsquo;s a version of it where there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>aspect of it that&rsquo;s better, but it&rsquo;s not universally better.</p>
<p>That was the case with, I mean, at the time that asbestos was created, it was this wonder</p>
<p>of science that was going to make fireproofing cheap.</p>
<p>And buildings all over the world started using this material.</p>
<p>And then 30, 40 years later, we find out it&rsquo;s a carcinogen.</p>
<p>And now you have to have people with hazmat suits to come in and take it away if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>unlucky enough to have a building that has that stuff in it.</p>
<p>So we keep seeing these, man makes these breakthroughs, but we don&rsquo;t really understand them.</p>
<p>And we adopt them before we really understand them.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re very quick to either embrace something that maybe we would want to be slower about</p>
<p>embracing or reject something that we&rsquo;re really quick to reject.</p>
<p>Well, we may find out that cell phones fall into that same category somewhere down the</p>
<p>road.</p>
<p>And but here&rsquo;s the difference maybe between something like asbestos and something like</p>
<p>some of the other stuff we were talking about.</p>
<p>Cell phones might be a good example.</p>
<p>You can pivot on a bad decision like thalidomide or asbestos.</p>
<p>You can say, wow, we had no idea we&rsquo;re going to phase out the use of that.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to phase out the use of cell phones or social media.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes we have no option.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is no.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s almost like with certain technological developments, it&rsquo;s almost like the spikes</p>
<p>where it says, you know, do not back up or your tires are going to pop.</p>
<p>Some things are once you&rsquo;re through the veil, there&rsquo;s no going back.</p>
<p>And some things you can pivot on.</p>
<p>I think asbestos is an example of a decision human beings can make and then decide they</p>
<p>made a mistake and double back.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some things where I think you&rsquo;re along for the ride.</p>
<p>And as I always say in the podcast, you know, you go from pushing a development to having</p>
<p>that development pull you.</p>
<p>And I think some of these things, they&rsquo;re not going to change.</p>
<p>So the question is, can humanity change?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And when there&rsquo;s a to double back to the idea of being a financial interest in pulling us</p>
<p>apart, if there&rsquo;s a financial interest fighting the idea, well, it&rsquo;s the environment&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>perfect example.</p>
<p>I mean, if we want to talk about improving environmental problems, sometimes it&rsquo;s difficult</p>
<p>because cutting down a forest is instant money and impacts people&rsquo;s lives now, sometimes</p>
<p>for the better, whereas long term preservation of a forest is a much more amorphous thing</p>
<p>where we have to subvert, you know, our needs of the moment and our possible gains in this</p>
<p>lifetime for long term gains.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure that the way human beings developed from, you know, Neanderthals to</p>
<p>now is necessarily hardwired for that sort of an approach.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p>Well, I had an experience this morning related to this.</p>
<p>I was walking on a beach in a remote place where there were no footprints.</p>
<p>It was a place where nobody walks.</p>
<p>I was walking and I was noticing the way the erosion, water was coming from under the sand</p>
<p>and creating these vein-like structures in the sand that went really long distance.</p>
<p>They were very beautiful.</p>
<p>And it felt like, oh, this is like what&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>This looks like a tree and this looks like our veins and this looks like whatever this</p>
<p>system is, however life works on the planet, I&rsquo;m getting to see an expression of this,</p>
<p>how life works in this moment.</p>
<p>And I realized that it&rsquo;s rare to be in a place that&rsquo;s less trodden like this one or</p>
<p>untrodden in this case.</p>
<p>And if this same place had 50 or 100 people walking back and forth on it over the course</p>
<p>of the day, what I got to see today would have been invisible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking about in our suburban world and in our urban world, how little we get</p>
<p>to see of what creation has to share with us.</p>
<p>We get to see something else.</p>
<p>We get to see man&rsquo;s creation, but we only get to see man&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about being able to see&hellip;</p>
<p>I remember hearing a story years and years ago.</p>
<p>I was in Hawaii and I was listening to the local public radio station in Hawaii and there</p>
<p>was an old Hawaiian man who maybe was 100 years old.</p>
<p>And he talked about the islands of Hawaii and he was out on a boat looking back at his</p>
<p>island and he said, all of the things over the last 100 years that man has built on these</p>
<p>islands that I can see now from the boat, none of them were more beautiful than what</p>
<p>was here before.</p>
<p>None of them.</p>
<p>That is a telling line, I think.</p>
<p>And something that I think a lot of people feel that loss without knowing that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>So, for example, my dad was a really poor kid.</p>
<p>He grew up in the Bronx in an apartment with a bunch of people.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really one of those old stories you used to hear from the Depression.</p>
<p>And then when the Korean War came around, they drafted people.</p>
<p>And if you didn&rsquo;t want to be drafted, you could enlist.</p>
<p>And by enlisting, you had to serve a little longer, but you had more choice over where</p>
<p>you went.</p>
<p>And so, dad joined the Navy and they said to him in the Bronx, where would you like</p>
<p>to go?</p>
<p>And he said, as far away from here as possible.</p>
<p>And so, they sent him to Honolulu in 1950.</p>
<p>And my father spent the rest of his life trying to find Honolulu in 1950 somewhere else.</p>
<p>And my mom says, when he first went back, it was probably early 1960s, and he said he</p>
<p>just fell down on the ground and cried because it was this wonderful memory he had of this</p>
<p>special place for a poor kid from the Bronx who&rsquo;d never seen palm trees had been destroyed</p>
<p>in his mind.</p>
<p>I mean, he would go all over the world later in life trying to find something that reminded</p>
<p>him of that experience.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s an element to explore here, too, about the, you know, what you just</p>
<p>mentioned about the untouched sand and all these sorts of things.</p>
<p>Well, this is an economic question, too, because you talk about a poor kid today living</p>
<p>in a concrete jungle somewhere where the vast majority of what they&rsquo;re exposed to is this</p>
<p>man-made stuff that you talked about and not the part of the world that humankind up until</p>
<p>relatively recently not only saw but perhaps mostly took for granted, right?</p>
<p>The way we take the giant skyscrapers for granted that if you pulled a person out from</p>
<p>the Middle Ages and took them to Chicago or New York or someplace like that, that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing that they would notice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just taking in what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Sometimes I say it, and then I try to decide, did that make sense?</p>
<p>No, it made perfect sense.</p>
<p>It was beautiful.</p>
<p>You had other things you wanted to get into?</p>
<p>Got me on the common sense thing.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>OK, let&rsquo;s talk about‚Äî</p>
<p>Are you‚ÄîRick, are you enjoying your foray into all this new technology, too?</p>
<p>Because as a guy who&rsquo;s a music producer, you&rsquo;re not usually the dude out front.</p>
<p>And in these productions, you are.</p>
<p>Are you enjoying that?</p>
<p>Well, the book is the first time that my name is on the front of anything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an interesting experience because I&rsquo;m always a backroom person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always on the back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never on the front.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I suppose the fact that I read or hear from people who are getting something from the</p>
<p>material, that makes me feel really good.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s serving its purpose.</p>
<p>Most art, at least the art that I&rsquo;ve been involved in, doesn&rsquo;t really have a purpose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more to thrill or to give an experience or to feel something more deeply.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t really have a purpose beyond that.</p>
<p>And this book has a purpose beyond nice words.</p>
<p>It has a purpose to inspire people to want to make things.</p>
<p>So the fact that some people have read it and said, this inspires me to want to make</p>
<p>things, that feels really good because it&rsquo;s fulfilling its promise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your moments frozen in amber also.</p>
<p>I mean, this is your frozen in amber moment.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a great line from the ancient Roman orator Cicero who said, writing is the</p>
<p>only true form of immortality.</p>
<p>Now, in his era, that was the only medium.</p>
<p>But the concept can be expanded to many different areas.</p>
<p>I mean, my mom was an actress, and she was active in mostly in the 1970s.</p>
<p>And every now and then, some old show will come on with her in it.</p>
<p>And I will see my mom from the 1970s when I was a kid, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that moment frozen in amber also.</p>
<p>This is your moment frozen in amber and your views as they exist right now, which may change</p>
<p>over time, but you&rsquo;ll be able in 20 years to look back and say, this is who I was and</p>
<p>what I was thinking during this eight or nine year period where I was putting this thing</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>Your moment frozen in amber.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I see it as that.</p>
<p>And I know that it&rsquo;s, I talk about it in the book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all changing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all always changing.</p>
<p>This is a moment in time.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be a new one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be different tomorrow.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;ll be some similarity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you about talking about theater of the mind, and I want to talk about audiobooks</p>
<p>versus what you do.</p>
<p>How would you describe the theater of the mind?</p>
<p>Well, when, again, to hearken back to when you and I were growing up, radio was the old</p>
<p>fashion medium by then.</p>
<p>And yet television didn&rsquo;t have the kind of reach that it has now.</p>
<p>And so I was a sports fan, still am, but I&rsquo;m a sports fan as a kid.</p>
<p>And there were games that I wanted to pay attention to that weren&rsquo;t being televised.</p>
<p>And so you would find yourself employing the old medium because maybe the game was being</p>
<p>broadcast on radio.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, you begin to understand the elements that radio brings to the table.</p>
<p>You know, I think when we were kids, we thought of it as an inferior medium, but it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>medium.</p>
<p>And the different medium is obviously because without showing you the pictures, without</p>
<p>you able to see them, your brain makes those things up.</p>
<p>And partly based on how good the person who&rsquo;s calling the game is, right?</p>
<p>I mean, part of what makes a good radio announcer of a ball game in the 1970s is being able</p>
<p>to bring you there without being able to see what is there.</p>
<p>And of course, in that era, we were still living in the fumes of like Orson Welles-type</p>
<p>radio and all these kinds of things where they did things with radio that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do with audio now.</p>
<p>Or actually, a better way to put it is didn&rsquo;t do with audio before things like podcasting</p>
<p>and stuff got started.</p>
<p>Used it in a different way.</p>
<p>Theater of the mind is the ability to conjure feelings, thoughts, images, and sort of paint</p>
<p>a picture for you with words that brings you into the scene.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lack of a need for that as much when you&rsquo;ve got the visuals.</p>
<p>But when you don&rsquo;t have the visuals, you know, it&rsquo;s like covering up your eyes and then finding</p>
<p>out how much your hearing or your sense of touch or your sense of smell can help you.</p>
<p>And how you come to different sorts of ways of adjusting your senses that you have left</p>
<p>when you take one of them away.</p>
<p>And I think theater of the mind is a wonderful way to touch back to some of the really fantastic</p>
<p>artists of an earlier era who figured out how to use a medium that just sent something</p>
<p>into your ears and allowed you to create what it was you saw.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is, you could have five people in a room surrounded by the radio</p>
<p>listening to the same thing.</p>
<p>And all five of them have a different mental conception of the picture that&rsquo;s being painted.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s theater of the mind.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>And I love how much more power that has than an image.</p>
<p>And an image, yes, an image, it contains a thousand words.</p>
<p>But if you look at an image, we all see a much closer representation when we look at</p>
<p>an image than when we hear a story.</p>
<p>Because when we hear a story, we&rsquo;re collaborators with the story.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re filling in, we&rsquo;re picturing the story based on our experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s room for us, the listener, to be part of the story.</p>
<p>Because as you said, five people hear a story and they all picture something different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful, do you know the cube experiment?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>But why don&rsquo;t you tell me and maybe I&rsquo;ll recall it, but it doesn&rsquo;t ring a bell.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a psychological, let me see if I, if I, yeah, it&rsquo;s a psychological experiment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still enjoying the, I&rsquo;m still enjoying the idea of a radio listener as a co-creator.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a wonderful mental image.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, in audio, it&rsquo;s true in music.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the difference between hearing a piece of music and closing your eyes and</p>
<p>listening to it and seeing what comes up for you or watching a music video.</p>
<p>A music video is much more leading.</p>
<p>It takes you much to a specific.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the difference between prose and poetry.</p>
<p>Poetry is more open to interpretation just by the nature of the language.</p>
<p>Anyway, the cube visualization, we can do this together now.</p>
<p>Okay, you ready?</p>
<p>Close your eyes.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And imagine a desert.</p>
<p>Picture the desert.</p>
<p>Got it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>In the desert, there&rsquo;s a cube.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a ladder.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>There are flowers.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>There is a horse.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And finally, there is a storm.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Describe the cube to me.</p>
<p>Well, it was kind of a Rubik&rsquo;s cube, so it&rsquo;s small.</p>
<p>Tiny little handheld cube dwarfed by the ladder and the horse and the flowers, maybe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Did it have colors like a Rubik&rsquo;s cube?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What this experiment does is each of the images represents something in your life, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>or an aspect of your life.</p>
<p>And the answers are very different.</p>
<p>I remember when I did this the first time, I saw a black metal cube, and it was a big</p>
<p>cube.</p>
<p>And it was sitting in the desert.</p>
<p>And I remember I was with a group of maybe six people who all imagined this at the same</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>Then we all described what we saw.</p>
<p>And I remember when I heard what other people&rsquo;s descriptions of the scene looked like, it</p>
<p>was hard for me to believe that that&rsquo;s what came from the same cues.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve all got the same cues, yet the images that I saw were so clearly, they</p>
<p>were so clear to me what I was looking at.</p>
<p>And these images were so clear to them what they were looking at.</p>
<p>And they were so radically different.</p>
<p>And the cube represents you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s how you see yourself.</p>
<p>And then the ladder represents you.</p>
<p>The ladder represents your friends.</p>
<p>The flowers are children, or it could also be your creative offspring.</p>
<p>So if you say that the cube is small and it&rsquo;s being overwhelmed by the flowers, or the ladder</p>
<p>and the flowers, and the horse, the horse is your passion.</p>
<p>So it would be your romantic relationship.</p>
<p>But it could also be whatever your passion is.</p>
<p>But typically, we think of it as the romantic relationship.</p>
<p>And the storm, describe the storm.</p>
<p>I live in Oregon, so it just looked like an Oregon storm in the middle of the Sahara.</p>
<p>So sort of low clouds, some fog, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>OK, but nothing like it didn&rsquo;t wreak havoc or destroy the cube or anything.</p>
<p>No, just rained.</p>
<p>Yeah, OK.</p>
<p>So the storm is your current problems and how you view them.</p>
<p>So for some people, you say a storm and there&rsquo;s a lightning bolt that destroys the cube, or</p>
<p>takes out the horse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, it really, we all have our own.</p>
<p>So you see yourself as this small Rubik&rsquo;s cube is a small, a puzzling, a complicated</p>
<p>puzzle.</p>
<p>And then the flowers and the ladder are your friends, your children, and your creative</p>
<p>offspring, your work.</p>
<p>You see yourself basically absorbed by those things have taken over your life.</p>
<p>Well, but what if those are the important things?</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve just gone through a therapy session.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no right or wrong answers to any of this.</p>
<p>This is more like just you get to learn about yourself through the process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book about it called The Cube that explains, you know, that can go into deeper</p>
<p>depth on each of the ideas.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting to me about it is how vivid the images we create are and how</p>
<p>it couldn&rsquo;t, to me, it couldn&rsquo;t have been anything else.</p>
<p>It was so obvious what I was looking at.</p>
<p>Like my cube is a black metal cube and impenetrable.</p>
<p>And it couldn&rsquo;t have been any other cube.</p>
<p>And I remember one person had a transparent cube that was floating over the desert and</p>
<p>spinning.</p>
<p>Like, how can that be?</p>
<p>How could anyone have that?</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>And this ties directly into the idea that theater of the mind allows you to decide what</p>
<p>your own cube, storm, horse, and flowers looks like.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And that there&rsquo;s something beautiful about allowing an audience to find their own story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on a documentary right now about Rodney Dangerfield, who I grew up loving.</p>
<p>And there are so many of the standard accepted rules of documentary making that holds the</p>
<p>hand of the audience and walks them through and spoon feeds them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not doing any of that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really, and always, with everything I make, I always give the audience the most</p>
<p>credit.</p>
<p>I always assume the audience is really smart and understands everything.</p>
<p>They understand things I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>So, if I make something that I like, I feel like I&rsquo;m going to learn about it through someone</p>
<p>else telling me what it is.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you about, did you read the audio book for your book?</p>
<p>Did I read it?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Did you, were you the audio, were you the reader of your audio book?</p>
<p>Yes, I tried not to be, but they insisted.</p>
<p>Yes, I was the reader of the audio book.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Tell me about that experience, because it&rsquo;s very different than what you do.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, and it was difficult, honestly, to try to find my own voice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, one of the people who read it, a friend of mine, said, it sounded like you</p>
<p>did the whole thing in your quote voice.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, I was basically quoting, wasn&rsquo;t I, the whole thing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did.</p>
<p>I found it difficult to find what my voice was reading my own work, because I don&rsquo;t write</p>
<p>my stuff that I record.</p>
<p>So yes, it was, and I would suggest that I got better at it as we did it more.</p>
<p>So maybe the book, if you listen to me voicing, it sounds better as we go on.</p>
<p>But I found that to be quite a challenge.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did it for my book, and it was one of the most difficult things I&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>in my life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how good it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too close.</p>
<p>I felt the same way.</p>
<p>But it took, yeah, and I worked on it for months and months and months.</p>
<p>And I still can see, you know, a million ways to make it better if I had more time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>And I think back, I&rsquo;ve been a fan of audio my whole life, and it&rsquo;s not just music.</p>
<p>I remember I went through a phase in my life where I only listened to comedy albums when</p>
<p>I was very young, and I listened to audiobooks before there was ever an Audible.</p>
<p>I would buy cassette, you know, books on cassette.</p>
<p>Books on tape, yeah.</p>
<p>And I liked listening to books on cassette, yeah, and I loved it.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I noticed is that it&rsquo;s a very particular skill set, an author</p>
<p>who can read their work in a way that it&rsquo;s compelling.</p>
<p>And often what I would do is try to find a lecture by the author about the subject of</p>
<p>the book that&rsquo;s not them reading the book.</p>
<p>About the subject of the book that&rsquo;s not them reading the book, but just them talking about</p>
<p>that subject.</p>
<p>And I found the ability to communicate the information was better when they weren&rsquo;t reading</p>
<p>the book and just talking about the subject than the reading of the book.</p>
<p>Because the reading of the book is such a specific skill set that unless we&rsquo;re trained</p>
<p>voice actors, we just don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>Yes, I can relate to that really well, because I think when you speak for a living, especially</p>
<p>when you speak unscripted for a living, like any craft that you do for a very long time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve sort of internalized all the different elements of it, and you don&rsquo;t think about</p>
<p>them anymore.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, then having to read, like you said, your own work and do audio,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the same medium I&rsquo;ve always been in.</p>
<p>You would think that all of the skills that you&rsquo;ve acquired over the years in speaking</p>
<p>to an audience through their ears would apply, but only a few of them did.</p>
<p>I found it to be almost a different art form entirely.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an interesting thing.</p>
<p>And I think that goes into making music as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re not, when we&rsquo;re making music, we&rsquo;re not trying to get it right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to convey a moment, which is what you&rsquo;re doing on your podcast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re conveying what you have to say about this material in this moment.</p>
<p>And I imagine, I asked you this earlier, but I don&rsquo;t think we, it may have been before</p>
<p>we started.</p>
<p>If you were to record the same podcast that you just released, the same five-hour story</p>
<p>a year from now, if you were to record it a year from now, how different would it be?</p>
<p>And my guess is 20% different, 30% different.</p>
<p>It would be different.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s interesting, too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another element to this, and it&rsquo;s the filter, right, or the lens.</p>
<p>So I had a guy get ahold of me a couple of years ago, and he said,</p>
<p>I want to do a movie about the naval battle, the Battle of Jutland that you talked about</p>
<p>as one little section of your first World War series.</p>
<p>And I said to him, I said, I don&rsquo;t have any, there&rsquo;s no copyright on historical events.</p>
<p>I said, you don&rsquo;t need my permission to do it.</p>
<p>He goes, I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it, though.</p>
<p>I want to take the lens that you viewed it through, and I want to make a movie about that.</p>
<p>And I thought that had never occurred to me before, but that&rsquo;s your cube thing,</p>
<p>or the Orson Welles, or the five people listening to the radio</p>
<p>and all getting a different mental image thing in a different form,</p>
<p>because he could have just done a movie on the Battle of Jutland, but he didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>He wanted to do a movie on my take of the Battle of Jutland,</p>
<p>which I thought was rather, I&rsquo;ve thought about that many times since,</p>
<p>because what that shows is that you could talk about the Battle of Jutland 900 different ways,</p>
<p>all of them being factually accurate and yet totally different.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And that goes back to the AI point, is that the AI could spit out the 900 different versions,</p>
<p>but why does this person want your version?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the art resonates.</p>
<p>It resonates not because you have the same data as the 900 other people who could tell the story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you tell the story the way you tell it,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting, at least to that person and to me.</p>
<p>You know, it makes me think of something, Rick.</p>
<p>I mean, the difference between‚ÄîI mean, I feel like one could make an argument,</p>
<p>and I could take both sides of this argument.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious where you fell.</p>
<p>The idea that we&rsquo;re making more creative works,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure more creative works is the same as more art, but we can revisit that.</p>
<p>As a group of people, we&rsquo;re making more art and creative works than ever before in human history.</p>
<p>More people have access to the tools, including the distribution tools, right?</p>
<p>When we were kids, if you didn&rsquo;t have some sort of in with the gatekeepers,</p>
<p>whether that was the TV networks or the movie producers or the newspapers or whatever,</p>
<p>you were out of luck.</p>
<p>Nowadays, people just go straight from creation to public display</p>
<p>through many different channels that are available,</p>
<p>so you feel like there&rsquo;s much more content out there than ever before.</p>
<p>But then you look back at the kind of content they created thousands of years ago,</p>
<p>where there was certainly less people doing it,</p>
<p>less ways to do it, less tools to do it, less ways to show it off,</p>
<p>and yet those are many of the things that if you go to an art museum are on display.</p>
<p>How do you think about the quantity versus quality idea in art creation?</p>
<p>Are we the most creative generation that&rsquo;s ever lived,</p>
<p>or is that a weird way of looking at it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird way of looking at it, and it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily better,</p>
<p>but the fact that more people can create seems like only a good thing.</p>
<p>I can remember something Tom Petty said to me.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the studio, and I heard a song from the 60s that I never heard before.</p>
<p>It was like a group that put out one seven-inch single</p>
<p>and just a cool psychedelic song, and it was really good,</p>
<p>and no one ever heard of this group, and they never did anything again.</p>
<p>And Tom said, you have to understand in the 1960s,</p>
<p>to go into a studio and record a record, you had to be really good.</p>
<p>Anyone who got to do that was really good.</p>
<p>The bar was high just to be able to get into the studio and record</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t have any of the tricks or technology</p>
<p>that allowed technology to help the process.</p>
<p>So if you couldn&rsquo;t do it on the floor in the studio</p>
<p>the same way that you couldn&rsquo;t do it live at a nightclub,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>You had to play at essentially a level that could wow a crowd,</p>
<p>or you wouldn&rsquo;t have the chance to ever even set foot in a recording studio.</p>
<p>So what that tells us is the bar was high.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely less of it.</p>
<p>But because the bar was high, the level of entry was high,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s less to wade through.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s more great stuff than there was in the 60s,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an exponential amount more to choose from.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the cream is better, worse, as good.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>I will say, because of streaming,</p>
<p>the nature of streaming has changed our relationship to music.</p>
<p>Whereas before, when you bought an album or you bought a CD,</p>
<p>you had some&hellip;</p>
<p>You made an investment in it, first of all.</p>
<p>You bought the thing.</p>
<p>This even goes back to before recorded music.</p>
<p>You bought a song.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d buy the sheet music for a particular song that you like.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;d sit at the piano and play that music and sing it with your friends.</p>
<p>And then there was wire recording.</p>
<p>And then there was wax cylinder recording.</p>
<p>And then there was the 78.</p>
<p>And then the LP.</p>
<p>Oh, then the 7-inch.</p>
<p>Then the LP.</p>
<p>Then cassettes.</p>
<p>Eight tracks.</p>
<p>Then CDs.</p>
<p>In all of that whole story, from the beginning up until streaming,</p>
<p>you bought the song you wanted or the collection of songs you wanted.</p>
<p>Now with streaming, it&rsquo;s more like water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ubiquitous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always available.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re paying to have access to it,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not paying for the one you want.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re paying for the key into the library.</p>
<p>And because of this, it&rsquo;s changed the way we&rsquo;ve consumed things.</p>
<p>Because now, even if there&rsquo;s something you love,</p>
<p>your favorite artist puts out a new project,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have the same durability that it had when you bought the vinyl</p>
<p>or when you bought the CD.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>When I say durability, in terms of, I don&rsquo;t mean stand the test of time.</p>
<p>I mean in our attention span.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just our&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination of our attention spans are getting shorter,</p>
<p>but also we&rsquo;re living on a conveyor belt</p>
<p>with all of these things going by constantly.</p>
<p>So before we made the commitment</p>
<p>and we picked the one that we wanted and we took it home</p>
<p>and we lived with that.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s this flowing stream of things going by us.</p>
<p>So even the one that we love,</p>
<p>it still has the disposable quality</p>
<p>of the stream that&rsquo;s going by with everything in it.</p>
<p>Same is true with movies.</p>
<p>You know, when we were young, the Godfather came out.</p>
<p>And Godfather, everyone you know saw the Godfather.</p>
<p>Every single person you know saw the Godfather.</p>
<p>And when it came time for the Academy Awards,</p>
<p>the Godfather wins an Academy Award.</p>
<p>And everyone you know saw it.</p>
<p>And today, if you look at what&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>There are now 10, used to be five.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s 10 movies up for an Academy Award this year.</p>
<p>I have a feeling,</p>
<p>if you look at the list of movies at the Academy Awards this year,</p>
<p>you will have seen none of the 10 movies</p>
<p>and nobody you know has ever seen any of the 10 movies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big shift.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big shift in the way we&rsquo;re consuming content.</p>
<p>And there is not a right or wrong or better or worse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a reality of the shift.</p>
<p>I love the fact that anything that I can think of from childhood,</p>
<p>from at any point in my life,</p>
<p>that I loved hearing in the past,</p>
<p>that I can be driving in my car and just think,</p>
<p>oh, I want to listen to Blondie today.</p>
<p>I can listen to Blondie now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to find a record store that still has the Blondie vinyl.</p>
<p>I can just hear it.</p>
<p>And I love that ability.</p>
<p>And as someone who makes things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sad to feel like I&rsquo;m doing just as much work as I did</p>
<p>when I made something that everyone heard and lived with for years.</p>
<p>And now it feels like it comes and goes very quickly,</p>
<p>not because it&rsquo;s any different, worse, better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the situation has changed.</p>
<p>Both technically the situation has changed,</p>
<p>but also as people we&rsquo;ve changed.</p>
<p>But I feel like we&rsquo;ve changed more in relation to the technology.</p>
<p>The technology has changed us.</p>
<p>But this, Rick, ties perfectly back into our conversation earlier</p>
<p>about things like information and whatnot.</p>
<p>Because, you know, there are certain things&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, let me take an example of Roots,</p>
<p>the groundbreaking TV series from the 1970s.</p>
<p>It was such a phenomenon.</p>
<p>I remember my family getting together,</p>
<p>and it was a multi-night affair, heavily publicized,</p>
<p>lots of media attention.</p>
<p>And we would sit there every night and watch this thing.</p>
<p>And the next day, everyone would be talking about it</p>
<p>because everyone saw the same thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s similar with the news thing.</p>
<p>I had a conversation once with a guy in the news business,</p>
<p>like I was at the time.</p>
<p>We were talking about the idea about shared information</p>
<p>that we all agreed upon.</p>
<p>And we were joking about how the information</p>
<p>that we were consuming,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say it was the New York Times in the 1970s,</p>
<p>that that information might not have been true,</p>
<p>but 85% of the public or more believed it was,</p>
<p>which gave you a shared point of reference</p>
<p>to have discussions over the water cooler with.</p>
<p>That when that goes away,</p>
<p>then all of a sudden you lose the ability</p>
<p>to have conversations because everyone starts yelling about,</p>
<p>you know, whose source are you using?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve got my sources and you&rsquo;ve got your sources.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a similar thing with music.</p>
<p>Because when I was growing up, we all heard the same thing.</p>
<p>And it was part of your,</p>
<p>it was part of a generational experience</p>
<p>to grow up listening to this or to that.</p>
<p>And everybody heard the same songs.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a balkanization of content now</p>
<p>so that you and I may have grown up in the same time period,</p>
<p>but may not have heard the same music at all.</p>
<p>That would have been pretty much impossible</p>
<p>when you and I were growing up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thing to think about</p>
<p>the pros and cons of that.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>The phrase that I&rsquo;ve heard used to describe</p>
<p>it as consensus reality.</p>
<p>And at one time that phrase was actually</p>
<p>in the book, The Creative Act.</p>
<p>And I realized when I thought more about,</p>
<p>I was trying, I was saying-</p>
<p>I like that term, by the way, consensus reality.</p>
<p>Well, I liked it until I understood what it meant.</p>
<p>I mean, I understand what it means.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great phrase.</p>
<p>But what it&rsquo;s describing is what you described</p>
<p>about the New York Times in the 1970s.</p>
<p>It may have been true.</p>
<p>It may not have been true.</p>
<p>But we all agreed that this is what we&rsquo;re going based on.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t really, I don&rsquo;t think I want to live</p>
<p>in a world of consensus reality.</p>
<p>I want to live in a world of reality as I see it</p>
<p>or as I can, based on what I can experience.</p>
<p>So, and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that we can ever know what&rsquo;s right or wrong.</p>
<p>So, just because everyone agrees to something,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s wrong, I&rsquo;m not sure how helpful that is,</p>
<p>unless all it is is a capitulation of saying,</p>
<p>it feels like a more negative version of me saying,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t know anything.</p>
<p>I know I don&rsquo;t know anything,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not making believe in another story</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know to be true for the sake of being</p>
<p>on the same page as everyone else.</p>
<p>That seems worse.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s better to accept we just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m flashing back to a conversation I had</p>
<p>with a mentor of mine back in the news business</p>
<p>who was teaching me the craft at the time.</p>
<p>And he was talking about something similar to this,</p>
<p>which was allowing people to create their own reality</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>
<p>And he was explaining to me why it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>in the news business to explain to people</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re seeing and what the news means and everything.</p>
<p>And he was saying in the same way that you wouldn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>into your auto mechanics garage and start saying,</p>
<p>well, I have a different opinion</p>
<p>about what this carburetor does.</p>
<p>And you wouldn&rsquo;t want to tell a professional</p>
<p>who works all the time in this</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s his livelihood</p>
<p>and he thinks about it all the time and he studied it.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t want to contradict him</p>
<p>just because you had a different opinion on the carburetor,</p>
<p>unless you knew something about it, of course.</p>
<p>He said, in the news business, this is what we do.</p>
<p>We follow the context.</p>
<p>Well, he said, most of the public</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the context.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You know, he was a big guy in the Charles Manson cases.</p>
<p>It was unfolding and everything.</p>
<p>He knew Manson.</p>
<p>And he was talking about how if you didn&rsquo;t fill</p>
<p>in the gaps for the public,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t know the background of the story.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you couldn&rsquo;t have your own opinion</p>
<p>on it without even knowing the background.</p>
<p>But he would have said, well, then why should I listen to you</p>
<p>if you have an opinion about the story,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know the background</p>
<p>and I have an opinion on the story</p>
<p>and I do know the background.</p>
<p>And if you knew the background,</p>
<p>your opinion might be closer to my opinion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting, I see both sides of that.</p>
<p>And, you know, you and I are both</p>
<p>kind of nonconformist that way.</p>
<p>And I would never want anyone telling me what to think.</p>
<p>But I do sometimes read things by members of the public</p>
<p>and think, how could somebody get it so wrong?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mind so much,</p>
<p>unless that person then is given a seat</p>
<p>on some news commentary program</p>
<p>and starts giving the how can that person get it so wrong idea</p>
<p>to a bunch of other people that think that guy has it right.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it&rsquo;s an interesting dichotomy</p>
<p>the way this stuff works in an entire society,</p>
<p>on an entire culture-wide level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an answer for it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to understand</p>
<p>why the breakdown of all of our institutions and systems</p>
<p>is like at one time I would,</p>
<p>the punk rocker in me would feel like,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>I get that way sometimes, too.</p>
<p>And the grownup in me is like,</p>
<p>hmm, this is messy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to hurt people.</p>
<p>Is it better if everyone just goes on</p>
<p>believing the false narrative</p>
<p>and just, you know, moves along?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting situation.</p>
<p>But I know that I can&rsquo;t really speak for anyone else.</p>
<p>I just know for me,</p>
<p>I feel more comfortable</p>
<p>believing whatever crazy thing I believe in</p>
<p>than tempering my creative spirit</p>
<p>by following the ordinary tenets</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re told of how things work.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m just as like,</p>
<p>I will tell you, I&rsquo;m not a flat earther,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love to hear the argument for it.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know that I believe in UFOs,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t not believe in them.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if someone tells me they were abducted by a UFO,</p>
<p>I want to hear that story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know what I,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to believe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert at anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going on.</p>
<p>And, and I like when,</p>
<p>I was, I was a vegan for 22 years,</p>
<p>card carrying vegan.</p>
<p>And it was hard.</p>
<p>At the time that I was vegan,</p>
<p>it was harder being a vegan than now.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a lot of vegans.</p>
<p>When I was a vegan,</p>
<p>you, you, you got laughed out of restaurants.</p>
<p>It was difficult.</p>
<p>It was a difficult way.</p>
<p>It had very little options and it was difficult.</p>
<p>And I truly believed that eating vegan</p>
<p>was the best diet for me and best for the planet.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a carnivore and I eat mostly only meat</p>
<p>after 22 years of not having any meat.</p>
<p>And I feel better.</p>
<p>I lost a hundred and some odd pounds of weight.</p>
<p>And I have a new experience.</p>
<p>Now, I, when I was a vegan,</p>
<p>I probably converted 40 people to being vegan.</p>
<p>Now, I eat meat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, if you&rsquo;re a vegan, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, you know, do, do what you like.</p>
<p>But I, I had bad information.</p>
<p>And now I found information that is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s working better for me.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny because I think if you took this</p>
<p>to a democratic kind of a question, right?</p>
<p>And said, well, if we ask the public,</p>
<p>how do you feel about being allowed to pick and choose</p>
<p>any sort of reality in, in what you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>versus having a consensus reality?</p>
<p>Like, is that the right word, consensus reality?</p>
<p>I think, what I think is a lot of people would say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m for a consensus reality as long as it&rsquo;s my reality.</p>
<p>I want everybody to have my, but I think most people,</p>
<p>if you gave them the democratic choice,</p>
<p>would not want to give up the ability to pick and choose</p>
<p>like an a la carte buffet.</p>
<p>The things that they want to believe are true</p>
<p>and the things that aren&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Now, I, I, I&rsquo;ve definitely been with a bunch of people</p>
<p>in my life who are elitists about this and would say</p>
<p>that some people like Rick Rubin and Dan Carlin</p>
<p>should be able to do that.</p>
<p>But some people are not qualified to do that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know what you do with that.</p>
<p>I do think that plays into some of the idea now</p>
<p>that you see in modern society,</p>
<p>where people think that any kind of expertise</p>
<p>is something you don&rsquo;t need to have.</p>
<p>That, that my view on what that carburetor does</p>
<p>as a non-technical person and a non-car person</p>
<p>is just as good as what a, what a real qualified,</p>
<p>you know, engineer who works on carburetors thinks.</p>
<p>But I do think that that might be the trade-off, right?</p>
<p>That might be the cost of being allowed on your part</p>
<p>or on my part to think differently that way.</p>
<p>And this is, truthfully, this is almost where things</p>
<p>like the Bodhi Tree come back into the conversation.</p>
<p>The Bodhi Tree, folks, was a bookstore</p>
<p>that is very hard to describe</p>
<p>that existed in Los Angeles for a while.</p>
<p>But it was the place you went for stuff</p>
<p>that was just, you know, Eastern-oriented,</p>
<p>might be meditation or something.</p>
<p>But it also would have stuff that was just wild.</p>
<p>I had a friend who said your job was to close your eyes,</p>
<p>spin yourself in a circle,</p>
<p>and then go wherever the dizziness led you.</p>
<p>But the difference would be</p>
<p>that if you wanted to be outside the consensus reality</p>
<p>in the 1970s or something,</p>
<p>you had to go to weird places</p>
<p>and strange locations and sources to do that.</p>
<p>Now, you just have to turn on your computer and go online,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all over the place.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t decide if the pros outweigh the cons,</p>
<p>but I think it goes back to what you and I were saying</p>
<p>about the difference between asbestos and cell phones.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I think the cat&rsquo;s out of the bag on that.</p>
<p>And the only way it ever goes back</p>
<p>is with some totalitarian government like North Korea</p>
<p>that says, no, no, no, this is how it&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have any choice.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m fascinated by the trade-offs.</p>
<p>I have a very specific example</p>
<p>related to your carburetor example about the heart.</p>
<p>We all learned in school how the heart works.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a book,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a doctor named Dr. Thomas Cowan,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a brilliant guy,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s definitely an alternative thinker.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got a book called The Heart Is Not a Pump.</p>
<p>And he explains that every medical book</p>
<p>that tells us how the heart works</p>
<p>and everything we learned in school is wrong.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s actually an entirely different system</p>
<p>than all of the heart doctors in the world think.</p>
<p>And I find it fascinating.</p>
<p>Now, if he&rsquo;s correct, which is possible,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s possible, what happens then?</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s right, what happens?</p>
<p>Now, if you ban his material,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what we teach in school, that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Do we miss out on the possibility</p>
<p>that actually someone realized</p>
<p>that the Earth is not in the center of the solar system,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s actually the sun?</p>
<p>The person who discovered that was put to death</p>
<p>for believing that.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think he was put to death.</p>
<p>Are we talking about Galileo?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was Galileo.</p>
<p>The original heliocentric&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look up who was the original heliocentric person.</p>
<p>Copernicus? I don&rsquo;t know who that was.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>But I see what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the dichotomy, though.</p>
<p>The dichotomy is this,</p>
<p>is that every time anyone broke the mold</p>
<p>when it comes to the official way of thinking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see one of these people</p>
<p>that we celebrate as a great innovator</p>
<p>and a great thinker</p>
<p>and they change the way we see science</p>
<p>or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>The problem is, is for every one of those people,</p>
<p>you also have people that were&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, my favorite, one of my favorite,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d probably like this</p>
<p>as an alternative way to view possibilities,</p>
<p>there are people out there</p>
<p>who say the entire historical dating system</p>
<p>that we have is wrong.</p>
<p>And that all these things that we think happened</p>
<p>are based on things that were mere images of each other.</p>
<p>In other words, we&rsquo;ll think we have two separate events,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really separate sources</p>
<p>talking about the same thing.</p>
<p>And I read one of them once</p>
<p>that was saying something like,</p>
<p>the Middle Ages were not really the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>I mean, in other words,</p>
<p>totally asking you to rethink the entire way</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve constructed the linear timeline of humanity</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s not that way.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m fascinated with that just as a conceptual tool,</p>
<p>but that to me would be an example of,</p>
<p>you know, the counterexample of someone</p>
<p>like a Galileo or a Copernicus.</p>
<p>So for every guy who upsets</p>
<p>the way of thinking in the correct direction,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who proposed a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>that looking back on it now,</p>
<p>you go, well, that was crazy.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s difficult</p>
<p>to separate the wheat from the chaff, you know?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Do you remember Apple&rsquo;s Think Different campaign?</p>
<p>Oh, sure. It was 84, I think.</p>
<p>It was, wasn&rsquo;t it? 1984?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>I remember they had John and Yoko.</p>
<p>They had all different people who thought differently.</p>
<p>And changed the world because they thought differently.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking how today,</p>
<p>Apple would not have that same ad campaign.</p>
<p>And I still live in a world</p>
<p>where the Think Different campaign is true.</p>
<p>Yeah, you do. You do.</p>
<p>Well, but I mean, to me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you bring to the table, one of the things.</p>
<p>I mean, if I&rsquo;ve done nine equivalent</p>
<p>of whatever today is a record album,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m looking to do something different</p>
<p>and really break the mold, I mean, I&rsquo;m looking for you.</p>
<p>I mean, because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re, I mean, that&rsquo;s what the,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the book is to me.</p>
<p>When you look at this book,</p>
<p>and this is what I mean about people</p>
<p>who do this already for a living,</p>
<p>being able to nod their head when they read this stuff</p>
<p>is because without this book,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re already trying to figure out</p>
<p>some of these same solutions.</p>
<p>And so when you bring up the problems,</p>
<p>we sit there and go, mm-hmm, I know exactly what that is.</p>
<p>And by the way, some of the solutions you come up with,</p>
<p>I really like.</p>
<p>And you know, you and I have talked about different things</p>
<p>and by the way, I don&rsquo;t like it as much</p>
<p>as I thought I did when I first bought it</p>
<p>now that I&rsquo;ve gone through,</p>
<p>but like Brian Eno&rsquo;s little card system</p>
<p>and things like that,</p>
<p>little things like that,</p>
<p>that just make you turn things over a little bit</p>
<p>and say, hmm, I never thought about looking at it that way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the best person I&rsquo;ve ever met at that.</p>
<p>Wow, thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting to me.</p>
<p>I always like considering what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>and I believe that anything&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So taking off any restraints</p>
<p>and removing all assumptions</p>
<p>and starting from almost a dream-like state,</p>
<p>like what could we dream?</p>
<p>What can we dream up?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because I know if we can imagine it,</p>
<p>we can bring it into being.</p>
<p>The imagining is the first piece.</p>
<p>And if we disincentivize imagining things</p>
<p>and allowing the world to be what it can be</p>
<p>instead of just what we think it is now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a beautiful way to walk in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the world I want to live in.</p>
<p>You know, you talk about,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one of the chapters in your book,</p>
<p>planting seeds.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell the audience a story</p>
<p>about you planting seeds.</p>
<p>So you, and this is so different.</p>
<p>And this is part of what, you know,</p>
<p>when we talk, when Rick looks so zen,</p>
<p>I just want to describe the difference between Rick</p>
<p>and somebody who would be like a normal person</p>
<p>and somebody who would be like a normal commercial producer</p>
<p>or something, a normal commercial producer</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s working with you, for example,</p>
<p>which you and I were not doing,</p>
<p>but may turn around and go,</p>
<p>I want to show you something</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll help us what we&rsquo;re currently working on.</p>
<p>Whereas you take people and you took me,</p>
<p>the first time I ever saw virtual reality was with you.</p>
<p>And you said, I want to show you something.</p>
<p>And we went in the car, we went to somebody&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and I put on the virtual reality goggles</p>
<p>for the first time in my life.</p>
<p>I was blown away.</p>
<p>I told you when we walked out of there,</p>
<p>I had 9,000 ideas pinging off of my brain after that moment.</p>
<p>And that was you, that you plant that seed</p>
<p>and then that seed goes in any direction.</p>
<p>And years later, when somebody said to me,</p>
<p>hey, have you ever thought about doing virtual reality?</p>
<p>Have you ever seen virtual reality?</p>
<p>I said, well, funny you say that.</p>
<p>I have, and I have some ideas.</p>
<p>Those ideas grew from either ground</p>
<p>that you plowed in my psyche</p>
<p>or a seed that you planted,</p>
<p>not for any commercial reason,</p>
<p>not because we were working together</p>
<p>and you wanted me to be better</p>
<p>at our commercial venture together.</p>
<p>You just Johnny Appleseeded something in my mind</p>
<p>that took root later and turned into something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a thank you</p>
<p>on the World War I immersive experience that we did</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t feel like it would have happened</p>
<p>without that seed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the things that you do for everybody</p>
<p>that I find so intriguing.</p>
<p>And that makes you more of a creator and amplifier</p>
<p>than most of these people you work with</p>
<p>when you give them a paycheck and say,</p>
<p>hey, help me out with this album,</p>
<p>make it sound differently.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re planting seeds for years down the road</p>
<p>that may have nothing to do with you eventually.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued with that.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about things</p>
<p>and I like the idea of sharing interesting things.</p>
<p>And the thing that we,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s funny about that immersive experience</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not something that I&rsquo;m so into.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more something that it sounded interesting.</p>
<p>And when I heard about it,</p>
<p>I thought Dan might like this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go check it out.</p>
<p>Honestly, it was more like it didn&rsquo;t give me any ideas.</p>
<p>Kind of made me nauseous.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s very funny.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m flying the flag</p>
<p>for the things I love all the time.</p>
<p>Although I do fly the flag for things I love,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s as much of,</p>
<p>take a look at this.</p>
<p>How does this bounce off of you?</p>
<p>I felt it opened up an entirely new vista.</p>
<p>And I love the idea of someone,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>I love that story.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really know that.</p>
<p>I mean, I know that we went to see,</p>
<p>to my friend Chris Milk&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and saw a very early version of the Oculus.</p>
<p>And I knew that you were interested,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t know that it actually came to anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And not just that,</p>
<p>what blew me away the most about the experience</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t that Chris Milk was a technologist.</p>
<p>He was looking at this from a,</p>
<p>correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>looking at this from a filmmaker viewpoint.</p>
<p>And several of the things that he said to me,</p>
<p>word for word stayed in my brain.</p>
<p>I remember him saying,</p>
<p>imagine every movie that&rsquo;s ever been remade already.</p>
<p>And I think Mutiny on the Bounty</p>
<p>was one of the things that was brought up.</p>
<p>He said, it&rsquo;s going to be remade.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll remake it Star Wars.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll remake it in virtual reality.</p>
<p>He was explaining all of the filmmaker tricks.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things he said was,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re making a movie</p>
<p>and the killer&rsquo;s coming down the stairs</p>
<p>and the family doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the killer&rsquo;s coming down the stairs,</p>
<p>you pan the camera to the killer coming down the stairs,</p>
<p>but he goes in a movie that you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>with this technology,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to figure out a way</p>
<p>to create a reason for you to turn your head</p>
<p>and look up there.</p>
<p>And I just remember being fascinated</p>
<p>with the difference between a way,</p>
<p>somebody who was trying to make a game</p>
<p>or somebody was looking at this</p>
<p>compared to just putting tools,</p>
<p>new tools in the hands</p>
<p>of somebody who thought of themselves</p>
<p>as an already existing art genre purveyor.</p>
<p>And I mean, like I said,</p>
<p>when we walked out of that house,</p>
<p>my brain was pinging with so many different ideas.</p>
<p>And I always feel like that when I leave you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an amplifier in that respect.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why people</p>
<p>are drawn to working with you</p>
<p>because I think they walk away and go,</p>
<p>wow, it&rsquo;s a completely different lens</p>
<p>through which to view things.</p>
<p>And not your lens,</p>
<p>you open up a vista to a wide&hellip;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the difference too.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going and working with Phil Spector</p>
<p>on a record album,</p>
<p>Phil&rsquo;s going to have Phil&rsquo;s viewpoint.</p>
<p>Rick doesn&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You open up vistas that create chances</p>
<p>for the artists themselves</p>
<p>to re-see what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>not only is that a skill,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why you would write a book on creativity,</p>
<p>I guess is what it boils down to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad you like the book.</p>
<p>That really, it means the world to me.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Well, it speaks to us</p>
<p>because we do all this stuff all the time.</p>
<p>And you put into words things we just have&hellip;</p>
<p>Some of this stuff is&hellip;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I think, by the way,</p>
<p>that some people maybe read it and say,</p>
<p>well, it sounds a little woo-woo.</p>
<p>Try explaining this.</p>
<p>Try explaining inspiration, right?</p>
<p>Try explaining where inspiration comes from.</p>
<p>I mean, the entire idea,</p>
<p>the entire creative act,</p>
<p>and the book is called The Creative Act,</p>
<p>the way of being,</p>
<p>the entire creative act is itself woo-woo</p>
<p>if you think about it.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re delving&hellip;</p>
<p>Magic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to put it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Any other questions that you had, my friend?</p>
<p>You had some things written down?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll actually, I&rsquo;ll ask you one last question in closing.</p>
<p>I have two.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ask them both,</p>
<p>although I have a feeling&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll read to you both of them,</p>
<p>and then you decide which one you want to answer.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or if you want to answer them both, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But I think this could take some time.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No worries.</p>
<p>First one is&hellip;</p>
<p>This is rooted in your newest episode,</p>
<p>is asking,</p>
<p>are today&rsquo;s superheroes yesterday&rsquo;s gods?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first question.</p>
<p>And then the other question is,</p>
<p>how was the world different before land ownership?</p>
<p>Yeah, those are very&hellip;</p>
<p>So give me the first one again.</p>
<p>The first one is,</p>
<p>are today&rsquo;s superheroes yesterday&rsquo;s gods?</p>
<p>So once&hellip;</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a historical theory</p>
<p>that many of these people in history that are&hellip;</p>
<p>Usually the words they use are demigods.</p>
<p>So you look at somebody like a Heracles,</p>
<p>you know, Hercules.</p>
<p>He was never a god, right?</p>
<p>He was a demigod, the son of a god.</p>
<p>And the idea is that some of these people</p>
<p>may very well have been real human beings</p>
<p>who just did such big things that they were deified.</p>
<p>So, and literally deified in the case of an Alexander the Great,</p>
<p>who was deified.</p>
<p>Julius Caesar, who was deified.</p>
<p>Like you go read the Roman accounts of Julius Caesar</p>
<p>after his death and they say,</p>
<p>Julius Caesar, the god.</p>
<p>Because the things that they did</p>
<p>seemed almost godlike, the accomplishments.</p>
<p>And so I certainly think that there are some demigods</p>
<p>who once upon a time were real people.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I think,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think that&rsquo;s arguable to some degree.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that means Thor</p>
<p>and Zeus and all those people</p>
<p>were once upon a time people,</p>
<p>but certainly like a Heracles could be</p>
<p>or some of these other ones.</p>
<p>So, I think the answer to that is we may never know,</p>
<p>but it seems likely.</p>
<p>What was the second one?</p>
<p>Oh, the land ownership one.</p>
<p>But also the question was like the role in society</p>
<p>that superheroes play,</p>
<p>like Aquaman.</p>
<p>Aquaman.</p>
<p>You had to pick Aquaman.</p>
<p>Just random.</p>
<p>First one that came to mind.</p>
<p>Or Captain America or Superman</p>
<p>or whoever the, or Batman.</p>
<p>Did those in the minds of young people,</p>
<p>did those characters fill the same role</p>
<p>as the Olympian gods, for example, in Greece?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>But what I would say is that I think they,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll watch those films sometimes,</p>
<p>like a superhero film or,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll find myself getting almost misty</p>
<p>emotionally about it.</p>
<p>And the reason I&rsquo;m getting misty</p>
<p>is because sometimes you&rsquo;ll see them do something</p>
<p>in the film or the movie or whatever.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll think, oh my goodness,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if someone like this actually existed?</p>
<p>Because when you look at, you know,</p>
<p>you and I talked about problems in the political system</p>
<p>and with humanity and all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Sometimes you think to yourself,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if something existed</p>
<p>that could cut through all the BS and just solve this, right?</p>
<p>Superman comes in and just fixes it, right?</p>
<p>Whatever, there&rsquo;s, I think there&rsquo;s a human longing</p>
<p>to be able to wish that there was a solution like that, right?</p>
<p>A solution that saw one answer</p>
<p>to a variety of intractable, unsolvable problems.</p>
<p>And I think superheroes,</p>
<p>especially when they&rsquo;re giving bad guys or evil,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re due,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something very satisfying about that.</p>
<p>I think it plays into the history of media</p>
<p>all the way back to at least Greece</p>
<p>and probably oral traditions and tribal stories</p>
<p>from way back where the good triumphs over evil.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just this feeling so often</p>
<p>that evil gets away with evil.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sense you get almost misty-eyed</p>
<p>when the right outcome happens, right?</p>
<p>And good triumphs and the bad guys get their due</p>
<p>and the bad thing that was happening is solved</p>
<p>and no longer is hurting people.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s that element of,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if that was there?</p>
<p>In terms of taking the place of gods,</p>
<p>the reason I wouldn&rsquo;t say so</p>
<p>is because a lot of these deities in pre-modern times,</p>
<p>if they were superheroes,</p>
<p>they would definitely sometimes be antiheroes</p>
<p>or flawed heroes</p>
<p>or my favorite comic book superhero,</p>
<p>for lack of a better word,</p>
<p>in all the comic books,</p>
<p>was the guy that just appeared</p>
<p>in the most recent Marvel film,</p>
<p>obviously very differently,</p>
<p>but it was Namor the Sub-Mariner.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s one of the earliest superheroes in Marvels.</p>
<p>It was like him and the Human Torch back in 1939.</p>
<p>And what I liked about the guy</p>
<p>was that he was a third force.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t on your side.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t on the bad guy&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>And depending on what he was doing,</p>
<p>you might see him as good or evil.</p>
<p>And I loved the nuance in the character.</p>
<p>But to be larger than life,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the attraction of the gods.</p>
<p>But I think if you look at someone like Thor</p>
<p>or even someone like the Greek gods,</p>
<p>sometimes they were being Captain America.</p>
<p>Sometimes they were being Namor the Sub-Mariner.</p>
<p>And every now and then they were being Dr. Doom, right?</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s an element in the superhero thing now,</p>
<p>especially with ones like Superman and whatnot,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re just undeniably good.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think most of these gods</p>
<p>or the various groups of gods,</p>
<p>I think they were much more amorphous characters</p>
<p>and much more morally ambiguous than our superheroes are.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure I would go there.</p>
<p>The gods of the past are much less pure good</p>
<p>than, say, the Christian god is today, right?</p>
<p>The Christian god today is more like Superman.</p>
<p>The gods of the past, much more morally ambiguous,</p>
<p>like a Sub-Mariner, maybe.</p>
<p>You had some thoughts about land ownership.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, what was the world like before land ownership?</p>
<p>How did land ownership happen and how did it change the world?</p>
<p>So I actually read a lot about this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all part of my attempts to get to the nature of war.</p>
<p>And when you start studying human conflict,</p>
<p>you realize that it may predate humanity.</p>
<p>So the path of studying this leads you further and further back in time</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re dealing with people&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, I think you could go back to Neanderthal times</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re talking about war.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually studying primates now and seeing the roots of this.</p>
<p>So when you talk about something like land ownership,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about two different kinds.</p>
<p>The modern kind where somebody gives you a title to some property</p>
<p>and that means it&rsquo;s your property.</p>
<p>And if somebody invades your property,</p>
<p>you can hold up the land ownership</p>
<p>and seek redress of grievances from the authorities</p>
<p>versus a tribe of pre-modern humans</p>
<p>that considers this area to be their grounds.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re probably talking about personal land ownership too,</p>
<p>probably more than this.</p>
<p>But the idea that this is your farm,</p>
<p>that this is your territory,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure there ever was a time when that didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Now, there may be cultures that didn&rsquo;t believe in land ownership.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly some of the Native American cultures</p>
<p>have believed that it&rsquo;s ridiculous to think about</p>
<p>how can you own the sky?</p>
<p>How can you own the mountains?</p>
<p>But I think, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>there are ancient peoples that not only own their own areas,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll dig moats around it, put stakes up around it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure there ever was a time uniformly,</p>
<p>even when we were hunters and gatherers,</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t consider this or that area to be ours.</p>
<p>But it was ours, not because through buying it,</p>
<p>but because you had it and you put a moat around it,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t let other people come to it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like you had a deed to the land.</p>
<p>Let me reverse the question.</p>
<p>What do you think about that, Rick?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I want to learn about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to me.</p>
<p>It feels like a lot changed</p>
<p>and the reason I&rsquo;m asking more has to do with</p>
<p>the way animals move over the landscape</p>
<p>and how when we started boxing off areas</p>
<p>or creating cities, we displaced the wildlife.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really impacted the whole ecosystem in a huge way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I was going with it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just curious about it because it feels like&hellip;</p>
<p>No, I want to explore that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about that too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great subject to bring up.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you how I&rsquo;m thinking about it.</p>
<p>So I have some weird interests like you do.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I find fascinating</p>
<p>are orangutans, the endangered species,</p>
<p>the apes from Borneo and Sumatra.</p>
<p>And if you go look at what&rsquo;s happening to the orangutan,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a disaster.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a disaster because these are the largest animals</p>
<p>that operate in the high trees in the world, right?</p>
<p>The biggest, the largest.</p>
<p>And their habitat is being destroyed.</p>
<p>Now, if you go look at what life is like</p>
<p>in a place like Borneo, it&rsquo;s like a lot of places.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite poor and the people often live</p>
<p>in the equivalent of shacks</p>
<p>with sheet metal roofs and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And so to tell those people</p>
<p>that they should not go chop down the forest nearby,</p>
<p>which allows them to potentially feed their family,</p>
<p>seems to me to be something that most of us would bristle</p>
<p>if somebody told us to do the equivalent</p>
<p>in our society here.</p>
<p>And yet at the same time, the entire planet, right?</p>
<p>The collective planet is losing both the orangutans</p>
<p>and the rainforest, the jungle there,</p>
<p>which is bad for all of us.</p>
<p>So how does a modern interconnected global society</p>
<p>deal with something like that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when a country like China</p>
<p>or maybe India gets angry at the developed world</p>
<p>for saying that they can&rsquo;t develop</p>
<p>in the same way that we did, right?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t they use coal to bring themselves</p>
<p>up to a higher level of industry and living standards?</p>
<p>We did, but we used it at a time</p>
<p>where maybe we weren&rsquo;t as aware of the collective damage</p>
<p>as they are now.</p>
<p>So you have to say to yourself,</p>
<p>if we in the rest of the world want jungle and rainforest</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s good for all of us,</p>
<p>and if we want orangutans,</p>
<p>what do we have to say to these poor people of Borneo?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do for them to make this worth their while.</p>
<p>And this is where I think, you know, it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>because the most interesting political questions, Rick,</p>
<p>are the ones that run at 90 degree angles</p>
<p>from what we want to believe.</p>
<p>So I want to believe that our country, for example,</p>
<p>can be autonomous and that we only worry</p>
<p>about what Americans need and want</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s why we voted our legislators</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>But in an interconnected world, it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>And you may have to turn around and go,</p>
<p>well, we may have to, you know, globally</p>
<p>have some kind of tax.</p>
<p>See, this runs against my political beliefs,</p>
<p>but you may say, we may have to have some kind of tax</p>
<p>that compensates people from like,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Brazil and the Amazon</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s Borneo that compensates these people</p>
<p>so that they don&rsquo;t do something we don&rsquo;t want them to do.</p>
<p>But if we were in those shoes 100 years ago,</p>
<p>we would claim it our sacred right to do.</p>
<p>And so I feel like,</p>
<p>because you brought up the land ownership question</p>
<p>as it relates to things like the animals</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think as this becomes a more acute problem,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re being faced with some stark choices</p>
<p>and we may not like something like a global tax</p>
<p>to pay off people so they don&rsquo;t cut down rainforests.</p>
<p>But at a certain point,</p>
<p>that might become a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>It already is for the orangutan.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it might be,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting about it is</p>
<p>if you look at what cutting down the trees generates</p>
<p>to offset that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I think that the bigger problem becomes</p>
<p>just the corruption in the system</p>
<p>is such that everything gets amplified</p>
<p>and middlemen and&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And you see that in Africa now.</p>
<p>I mean, forget orangutans for a minute.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to like chimpanzees.</p>
<p>In Africa, they kill chimpanzees for bushmeat, right?</p>
<p>And you say to yourself,</p>
<p>oh, my gosh, you&rsquo;re killing this endangered species</p>
<p>for bushmeat,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a sign of how poor and how needy</p>
<p>these people are, right?</p>
<p>And how little, you know,</p>
<p>my grandfather was a huge fan of Baja, Mexico,</p>
<p>and he used to go down there once a year</p>
<p>and bring all kinds of goods</p>
<p>to the really poor part of Mexico.</p>
<p>And he used to say,</p>
<p>it is so poor down there</p>
<p>that the amount of things that it would take on our part</p>
<p>to make a huge difference in their lives</p>
<p>would seem almost insignificant to us.</p>
<p>But if you give this stuff to them to change their life</p>
<p>and some middleman corrupt government steals it all,</p>
<p>well, then your money was wasted</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t help the people you want to help.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s some stuff we could unpack here</p>
<p>in another conversation.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>And when you make the suggestion of some sort of a tax,</p>
<p>my concern is it would be better for a person of means</p>
<p>to take on this challenge</p>
<p>as opposed to it paying it in tax</p>
<p>to handle the situation.</p>
<p>And the reason I say that is I don&rsquo;t have faith</p>
<p>that the money that we pay in tax</p>
<p>necessarily goes to the things that we want it to go for.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>100%. 100%.</p>
<p>Now, let me suggest a different way of doing it.</p>
<p>So I always love to go look at the earlier models.</p>
<p>And if you go look at how they were doing things</p>
<p>in ancient Rome, for example,</p>
<p>one of the things it was both an expectation,</p>
<p>but also something that people did</p>
<p>where you would have a very, very rich person</p>
<p>who would solve some public problem</p>
<p>or fill some public need.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just randomly just throwing something out there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the sewage system is broken down in your town</p>
<p>and the wealthiest person in the town</p>
<p>fixes the sewage system at his own expense.</p>
<p>And then the payoff for that,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just meant to be something that was,</p>
<p>you feel good about yourself later.</p>
<p>There would be statues put up to the person.</p>
<p>There would be celebrations of the&hellip;</p>
<p>In other words, there was a mutually beneficial circumstance</p>
<p>where everybody got something for doing this, right?</p>
<p>The super rich person hardly noticed the expenditure.</p>
<p>The new sewage system got built.</p>
<p>He gets a statue or she gets a statue put up</p>
<p>to recognize their efforts and no one had to be taxed.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s multiple ways maybe of doing this.</p>
<p>And I think you can find examples today</p>
<p>with super rich people who sometimes do stuff like that.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Interesting.</p>
<p>Sounds good.</p>
<p>My thanks to Rick Rubin for coming on the program today.</p>
<p>His new book is called The Creative Act, A Way of Being.</p>
<p>And as I said, I find myself nodding my head as I read it</p>
<p>because so many of the things that he talks about</p>
<p>are things that we deal with when we&rsquo;re putting together our work.</p>
<p>See if you don&rsquo;t feel the same way.</p>
<p>And I will say that if you ever wonder what it was like</p>
<p>for all those musical acts and people</p>
<p>that were working with Rick over the eras to work with Rick,</p>
<p>to talk with him, to be with him,</p>
<p>to get a sense of, you know,</p>
<p>what sort of information, advice, and perspective he&rsquo;s sharing,</p>
<p>I find that the book is a pretty good replication of that.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t you check it out if you&rsquo;re interested in creativity,</p>
<p>Rick Rubin, or any of the things we talked about today</p>
<p>and everyone stay safe and thanks for joining us.</p>
