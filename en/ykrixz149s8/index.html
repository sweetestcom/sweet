<p>or at all or how&rsquo;s that work thank you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very good question you have a</p>
<p>resistant starch which you know a lot of</p>
<p>people even in Aikido are taking that</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re athletes and in</p>
<p>the microbes in the large intestine</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll they&rsquo;ll start to ferment that the</p>
<p>biggest thing that I see with this is</p>
<p>that people are getting gas they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting digestive bloating it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>overwhelming them now you could just do</p>
<p>vegetables and feed those microbes the</p>
<p>fibers that they need the problem with</p>
<p>resistance starch is there&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>no nutrients there&rsquo;s no vitamins or so</p>
<p>minerals it&rsquo;s just starch which is</p>
<p>basically a type of carbohydrate sugar</p>
<p>molecule stuck together honestly I just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t recommend it there&rsquo;s too many</p>
<p>drawbacks but a lot of people are doing</p>
<p>it and especially if they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>long-distance running you know so we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>find out the long-term effects of that</p>
<p>but hey thanks for your call hey Laura</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from Rhode</p>
<p>Island go ahead you had a question about</p>
<p>skin yeah I have some Seberg I have two</p>
<p>questions</p>
<p>my</p>
<p>first once out eczema what causes it</p>
<p>with the treatment besides taking</p>
<p>omega-3 is it related to hormone problem</p>
<p>and the other problem is the candida</p>
<p>rashes the you know under the breath the</p>
<p>belly is it it changed me like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something more to it than you know some</p>
<p>doctors will say or people will say well</p>
<p>we have yeast on our skin and it&rsquo;s skin</p>
<p>touching skin because that will happen</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been doing a program for 11</p>
<p>weeks I don&rsquo;t know if it takes longer</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if it&rsquo;s more related to</p>
<p>liver is it glycogen stores being</p>
<p>released at this I tried oregano oil</p>
<p>which didn&rsquo;t really do a lot but now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking mean which is better but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still not doing it okay Lori quick</p>
<p>question did you get these skin issues</p>
<p>when you started the ketogenic diet no</p>
<p>okay so you had them yeah okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just talk first about eczema that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a skin condition a lot of people have it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not sure if you look it up it</p>
<p>always says unknown cause we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s causing it when you do more</p>
<p>research etc there&rsquo;s a couple things</p>
<p>that are related to that issue and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from my experience it&rsquo;s related to the</p>
<p>digestive system the liver and the gut</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always some imbalance in the</p>
<p>flora on your skin you have about 400</p>
<p>different types of strains of microbes</p>
<p>that live that actually protect the skin</p>
<p>prevent lesions prevent rashes and all</p>
<p>these other things so and the same thing</p>
<p>with Candida</p>
<p>we have normally we have candida on our</p>
<p>body and when the imbalance a ship&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when we have more unfriendly Candida</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the kind of that you can look</p>
<p>at like the good bacteria bad bacteria</p>
<p>you start getting side effects from that</p>
<p>itchiness white tongue bad odor</p>
<p>reassures red things and things like</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>so again digestion I think what I would</p>
<p>do if I were you there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>to handle the internal part of the body</p>
<p>because in order to correct that it does</p>
<p>take a long time it&rsquo;s not going to be a</p>
<p>matter of one to two weeks this could</p>
<p>take months if it&rsquo;s systemic and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the same thing with like toenail fungus</p>
<p>you know if this growing on the toe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>growing all throughout the body it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming out from the outside so the best</p>
<p>absolute best thing to reverse both of</p>
<p>those conditions would be to take a</p>
<p>probiotic</p>
<p>that is very very complete and the one</p>
<p>that I recommend is called effective</p>
<p>microbes e/m effective microbes you can</p>
<p>look it up buy it online it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>expensive and you can start taking very</p>
<p>small dosages of that right before bed</p>
<p>and maybe a little bit of kefir</p>
<p>unsweetened unsweetened kefir and just</p>
<p>take it before bed and what will happen</p>
<p>is over time that will build up the</p>
<p>floor up and your skin rashes and exam</p>
<p>will start kind of clearing up and so</p>
<p>will the candida so that&rsquo;s number one</p>
<p>number two another remedy that is really</p>
<p>good for any type of eczema dandruff</p>
<p>flaking skin even candy to rashes is to</p>
<p>take one to two drops of oregano oil</p>
<p>okay and you put that at 1 teaspoon of</p>
<p>flax oil and you mix it up and you apply</p>
<p>that to the skin you rub it into the</p>
<p>skin so you have the benefit of the</p>
<p>essential fatty acids topically that are</p>
<p>really good for just reviving the skin</p>
<p>and then the oregano oil is the absolute</p>
<p>best antimicrobial thing on the planet</p>
<p>antiviral antifungal antibacterial it</p>
<p>just will heal the skin and actually</p>
<p>handle those microbes those growth</p>
<p>factors so you want to work on the</p>
<p>inside and then work on the outside all</p>
<p>right that was kind of a long answer but</p>
<p>ok Stacy you&rsquo;re from Dallas Texas go</p>
<p>ahead your run on it Stacy are you there</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry are you there</p>
<p>this is dr. Berg yes hi hi I just had a</p>
<p>question about I had switched over to</p>
<p>the ketogenic way of eating since</p>
<p>February 22nd so and recently someone</p>
<p>posed the question that if you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>your gallbladder removed that</p>
<p>could be an issue yeah good question</p>
<p>alright next question I was kidding let</p>
<p>me answer that question I actually have</p>
<p>a video on this but I&rsquo;m just going to</p>
<p>explain what happens the gallbladder is</p>
<p>a sac that helps you concentrate bile bi</p>
<p>le bile is kind of like the detergent</p>
<p>that helps break down fats it helps you</p>
<p>concentrate the bowel to help you</p>
<p>extract fat side the vitamins from the</p>
<p>food that you&rsquo;re eating so when you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder what happens</p>
<p>now you just have a tube from your liver</p>
<p>to the small intestine so you&rsquo;re never</p>
<p>going to have the ability now to</p>
<p>concentrate the bile which means you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be deficient in bile which</p>
<p>means that you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>incomplete digestion with fats essential</p>
<p>fatty acids and fat soluble vitamins so</p>
<p>you may eventually get symptoms of you</p>
<p>know fat deficiencies in the body with a</p>
<p>night vision problem skin issues down</p>
<p>the road I&rsquo;m not saying you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have those right now but over time it</p>
<p>could have them so and you may have a</p>
<p>difficult time digesting fats because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing that so that it forces</p>
<p>the pancreas to produce more lipase</p>
<p>which is the fat enzyme to help break</p>
<p>down fats so it puts a little strain on</p>
<p>the pancreas so the best thing that I</p>
<p>would do Stacey is maybe support start</p>
<p>off with just one gallbladder formula in</p>
<p>the morning after you eat or with it</p>
<p>could be another meal to just take one</p>
<p>after you eat that will provide the</p>
<p>concentrated bile to start giving you</p>
<p>enough so you don&rsquo;t run out so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how I would solve it and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>short answer</p>
<p>all right hey Lori you&rsquo;re from Rhode</p>
<p>Island a skin problem</p>
<p>so go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air hi um this</p>
<p>is my second shot I just have one more</p>
<p>question okay and I bought seed</p>
<p>probiotic TM I think it was called Pro</p>
<p>Am and is that it made it so much worse</p>
<p>because they use molasses and honey</p>
<p>yummy you know just seeds bacteria okay</p>
<p>so I mean it&rsquo;s even that bad that that</p>
<p>that blew it up and um let me take that</p>
<p>let me talk about that Laurie so Laurie</p>
<p>already took it and she had a she had</p>
<p>almost had exaggeration of the symptoms</p>
<p>so Laurie just so you know they</p>
<p>do feed the microbes with molasses but I</p>
<p>will say that all that molasses is eaten</p>
<p>up already when you get it there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s less than 1 grams of sugar</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like hardly anything and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not even sweet so there&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the carbohydrates that&rsquo;s creating</p>
<p>the reaction it&rsquo;s the microbes and I</p>
<p>should have pointed this out those</p>
<p>effective microbes are very effective</p>
<p>and they will initially stir up an</p>
<p>immune reaction so that being said you</p>
<p>want to take very small amounts I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking like 5 drops before a meal</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m before bed take that over a period</p>
<p>of time and then start gradually</p>
<p>increasing because the fact that it</p>
<p>turned on certain symptoms means that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just working too fast that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creating the reaction the other thing</p>
<p>that you may want to try in very small</p>
<p>quantities Lori is the colostrum because</p>
<p>that also is a good immune builder it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for the gut good for wonderful pur</p>
<p>skin and increases growth hormone but</p>
<p>again take very small amounts before bed</p>
<p>and gradually work up alright hey Dale</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Orlando Florida go ahead you</p>
<p>had a question</p>
<p>I got your bird thank you so much for</p>
<p>the abundance of information you provide</p>
<p>sure I am both a skill and thyroid body</p>
<p>type I&rsquo;m about 60 pounds overweight and</p>
<p>I am now doing the Kino genic diet I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>calling today to ask you about 3 health</p>
<p>issues I&rsquo;d like to address the first is</p>
<p>that for as long as I can remember my</p>
<p>body cracks and pops all over it&rsquo;s most</p>
<p>predominantly in my left hip and this</p>
<p>includes pain the second is that for the</p>
<p>last 4 to 5 years I have constant and</p>
<p>prominent muscle aches that started in</p>
<p>my right shin and has systematically</p>
<p>spread to my right thigh this ache is</p>
<p>deep and painful and it&rsquo;s sometimes and</p>
<p>it is something I feel all the time the</p>
<p>last is about a year and a half ago I</p>
<p>developed a thyroid nodule it is benign</p>
<p>however I do realize this is a symptom I</p>
<p>need to address I have been diagnosed</p>
<p>with Hashimoto&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;m now taking</p>
<p>selenium</p>
<p>got okay great thanks alright so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk about the nodules first nodules</p>
<p>come from either estrogen dominance or</p>
<p>low iodine I think what I would do if I</p>
<p>were you I would take some seek help and</p>
<p>I would take that and that normally</p>
<p>should get rid of those nodules pretty</p>
<p>fast okay because that decreases the</p>
<p>estrogen in those areas okay the first</p>
<p>question cracks and pops on the left hip</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually a sign of a b1 deficiency</p>
<p>so you can start taking b1 that</p>
<p>nutritional yeast might help but if it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get rid of it and you have</p>
<p>problems in the left hip what you want</p>
<p>to do and I&rsquo;m going to actually create a</p>
<p>video after we&rsquo;re done and I&rsquo;ll post it</p>
<p>probably within the next week you want</p>
<p>to work on the opposite hip okay you</p>
<p>want to do acupressure on the opposite</p>
<p>hip so you can take a foam roller take a</p>
<p>tennis ball okay and if your problem is</p>
<p>on the left tip you lay on the right hip</p>
<p>and you just work out those spots on the</p>
<p>right hip exactly where it&rsquo;s popping on</p>
<p>the left you do acupressure on the right</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;ll stop the popping because it</p>
<p>balances it out now muscle aches on the</p>
<p>shin all the way up to the thigh I think</p>
<p>you sit on the right side okay is this</p>
<p>the same principle that you can use you</p>
<p>work on the left side so you want to</p>
<p>have someone maybe someone that does</p>
<p>massage or a body work or even your</p>
<p>spouse and start working up the mirror</p>
<p>image on the opposite shin on the</p>
<p>opposite thigh okay and that should get</p>
<p>rid of the achiness now the other thing</p>
<p>that causes a keenest is an electrolyte</p>
<p>deficiency so you might want to look at</p>
<p>that too especially on the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet a lot of people are taking the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder I have which is some</p>
<p>people say it&rsquo;s too sweet there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>sugar in it but we just made a version</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not sweet at all so that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>version that&rsquo;s currently out that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another thing you might want to try</p>
<p>especially if you have any type of</p>
<p>tightness cramping muscles weak muscles</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a potassium magnesium or calcium</p>
<p>issue and I just like to take it as</p>
<p>electrolyte powder alright hope that</p>
<p>helped</p>
<p>okay so let&rsquo;s see it&rsquo;s Arlene you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Delaware go ahead you had a</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>hi dr. Berg hi how are you good okay I</p>
<p>have a question I had breast cancer in</p>
<p>2011 and they put me on an estrus oral</p>
<p>medication and it seems like throughout</p>
<p>the years my bones have really really</p>
<p>been aching sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to sit</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to stand Monday</p>
<p>I decided that well they said that they</p>
<p>wanted to keep me on it for another four</p>
<p>years I don&rsquo;t think my body can take it</p>
<p>but I had decided to stop taking it</p>
<p>Monday and I started taking your b3 and</p>
<p>k2</p>
<p>do you think that&rsquo;s a wise decision good</p>
<p>question and again I just have to make</p>
<p>one little point anything that I tell</p>
<p>people in this communication or all my</p>
<p>live videos is just for education I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not trying to I&rsquo;m not trying to make</p>
<p>claims it&rsquo;s going to cure anyone so</p>
<p>check with your doctor before taking my</p>
<p>advice okay yes if you have bone pain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about it that&rsquo;s about them in d3</p>
<p>deficiency and I do you know that</p>
<p>medication has a side effect of</p>
<p>depleting your d3 but when you take d3</p>
<p>you need k2 with it so yes you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>right track as far as bone destruction</p>
<p>and make sure you have really good bones</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a pre osteoporosis which is</p>
<p>osteopenia or actual osteoporosis I</p>
<p>would highly recommend the d3 and the k2</p>
<p>combination okay that&rsquo;s a given but the</p>
<p>other thing I think you may want to</p>
<p>consider taking is the estrogen balance</p>
<p>with dim doom is about 25 times more</p>
<p>concentrated than cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a natural thing it&rsquo;s really good to</p>
<p>support the immune system after</p>
<p>chemotherapy after radiation after</p>
<p>cancer so that&rsquo;s something I would also</p>
<p>add to the mix because it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>protective okay thanks for calling all</p>
<p>right so let&rsquo;s see here now we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to go to Nydia from Virginia right down</p>
<p>the street</p>
<p>yes hi that&rsquo;s a bit I have a question I</p>
<p>am NOT overweight I only weighed one</p>
<p>hundred sixteen pounds but I have a huge</p>
<p>boot I were sized</p>
<p>Triple D and then my doctor recommended</p>
<p>a breast reduction surgery so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know I know I am taking the seek help</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the only thing that I can</p>
<p>do to reduce the size anyway I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to do the surgery actually it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good question you&rsquo;re taking the</p>
<p>right thing yes seek help does reduce</p>
<p>estrogen and basically Triple D I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>women coming in their size H out of H I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even know it went that high</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s estrogen dominance so I think the</p>
<p>best thing that you can also take</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called estrogen</p>
<p>balance with dim di M because that has</p>
<p>specific properties to naturally balance</p>
<p>the estrogen in your body so you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>producing the wrong kind and that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing that I would recommend probably in</p>
<p>addition to that is the cruciferous food</p>
<p>those two together help balance estrogen</p>
<p>and that should be effective okay all</p>
<p>right Adrienne you&rsquo;re from California go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>yeah hi thanks for taking my call sure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling because I have a bone spur</p>
<p>my right ankle and I was wondering is</p>
<p>there a way I can get rid of it without</p>
<p>laser surgery and then also um we have</p>
<p>the issues over the past year where no</p>
<p>matter what type of pair of shoes I buy</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like I have flat feet and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m please large size shoe my feet turn</p>
<p>inward so no matter how what good</p>
<p>condition the shoes are in there always</p>
<p>sloping down after two months after</p>
<p>talking again new pair and I&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>it may be something chiropractic I need</p>
<p>to have done I&rsquo;m not 100% sure</p>
<p>good question wonder what I can do about</p>
<p>it is the bone spur underneath your heel</p>
<p>or on the outer part of the heel where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sticking backwards it&rsquo;s actually on</p>
<p>my ankle it&rsquo;s on my right side of my</p>
<p>right ankle okay</p>
<p>okay all right so let&rsquo;s talk about heel</p>
<p>spurs I have a video on heel spurs and</p>
<p>flat feet you can go search it on</p>
<p>YouTube</p>
<p>but this Spurs are basically a calcium</p>
<p>deposit you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re deficient in k2</p>
<p>vitamin k2 I would definitely go for the</p>
<p>k2 d3 combo to help balance the soft</p>
<p>tissue calcium that&rsquo;s happening now for</p>
<p>immediate relief you can do acupressure</p>
<p>on your left ankle exactly mirror image</p>
<p>where the spot is on the right side</p>
<p>press in there you&rsquo;re going to find a</p>
<p>tender spot that&rsquo;s going to be so tender</p>
<p>just be gentle work that out that least</p>
<p>get rid of the pain part of the spur</p>
<p>okay work on the opposite side but the</p>
<p>other thing was flat feet I was born a</p>
<p>flat feet I mean I had my feet were like</p>
<p>pancakes all through sports my feet</p>
<p>killed me and I have every single</p>
<p>professional arch you could possibly</p>
<p>imagine</p>
<p>imagine you know form from my feet and</p>
<p>then I went into the military that was</p>
<p>like in the boots it was just terrible</p>
<p>so one day I got rid of my arch supports</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like wow why it feels better so</p>
<p>what you want to do is the arch when you</p>
<p>when the arches fall and it&rsquo;s flat what</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to do is massage the arch</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work it will not work what</p>
<p>you want to do is massage the opposite</p>
<p>the top of the foot all the muscles on</p>
<p>the top of the foot and you want to</p>
<p>stretch the muscles on the top of the</p>
<p>foot as it goes into the shin okay I</p>
<p>would I would watch the video there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great stretch you want to be almost like</p>
<p>kneeling on your couch or your bed where</p>
<p>your feet are flat down okay so you have</p>
<p>your feet stretched out so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stretching all the front part of the</p>
<p>foot and the Achilles the enter tibialis</p>
<p>and the front part of the shin and then</p>
<p>if you do that twice or you know three</p>
<p>times a day you&rsquo;re going to like you all</p>
<p>your feet pain is going to go away it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great for flat feet it&rsquo;s just great to</p>
<p>balance the muscles because all day long</p>
<p>the arch muscles are just fighting like</p>
<p>crazy so this reverses the flow gives</p>
<p>your feet some relief and I never have</p>
<p>feet pain any more all right try that</p>
<p>out hey Brenda you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from New York oh yeah good</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m not overweight my height is</p>
<p>five three and I&rsquo;m 130 so I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>any medication in my body I walk every</p>
<p>day by five or six mile a day</p>
<p>my question is to you is like you said</p>
<p>it to consume egg is is good but I have</p>
<p>a problem with my gassy stomach if I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat too much festival is it going</p>
<p>to get a high colour shot or no okay is</p>
<p>that your only question I come like a</p>
<p>pre in the morning you said if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat vegetables yeah I don&rsquo;t I cannot eat</p>
<p>that my specimen I have a very gassy</p>
<p>stomach listen from you data okay apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar is good so I drink that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s helped me a lot but the thing is if</p>
<p>I consume it decrease the festival it is</p>
<p>going to be having a high quality or</p>
<p>next time or not yeah good question</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you want to do you you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do vegetables because it just gasses you</p>
<p>out so I would recommend doing fermented</p>
<p>vegetables and you don&rsquo;t need as much if</p>
<p>you do that so you can ferment them like</p>
<p>sauerkraut pickles that type of thing</p>
<p>and try to find some vegetable that you</p>
<p>can consume like maybe like I said not</p>
<p>iceberg lettuce but like romaine lettuce</p>
<p>that might be okay in smaller quantities</p>
<p>and then you may want to supplement with</p>
<p>electrolyte powder so that has that has</p>
<p>the potassium because without those</p>
<p>vegetables you&rsquo;re not going to get your</p>
<p>potassium so fermented vegetables are</p>
<p>the key and then I would just watch the</p>
<p>cluster I think you&rsquo;re going to be fine</p>
<p>but if you have some of those fermented</p>
<p>vegetables that should do the trick and</p>
<p>this play it by ear and and if you still</p>
<p>the problem why don&rsquo;t you you know get</p>
<p>in contact with me and I&rsquo;ll take you to</p>
<p>the next level because there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>things you can do that take a little bit</p>
<p>more time all right thanks for calling</p>
<p>hey Nicholas you&rsquo;re from Chicago go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the air yes good morning</p>
<p>dr. Berg thanks for taking my call</p>
<p>I just had a question it was actually</p>
<p>kind of concerning last couple weeks I</p>
<p>just haven&rsquo;t been feeling myself and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of cramps in my</p>
<p>arms leg</p>
<p>stomach and so it concerned me I went to</p>
<p>the emergency room</p>
<p>a couple times over less two weeks and</p>
<p>they did tests on me and all that my</p>
<p>calcium level was just slightly elevated</p>
<p>the first time the second time it was in</p>
<p>the normal range I&rsquo;m wondering if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just severely dehydrated or should I be</p>
<p>worrying about you know calcium being</p>
<p>too high that&rsquo;s a really good question</p>
<p>because if you have too much calcium in</p>
<p>the blood hypercalcemia you could have</p>
<p>like a lot of soft tissue calcium</p>
<p>building up because it&rsquo;s not being</p>
<p>transported into the tissues and it can</p>
<p>create a lot of problems for you muscle</p>
<p>cramps and weakness so the fact that was</p>
<p>slightly high is an indicator that I</p>
<p>think in you mentioned I think in on</p>
<p>your on the text right here vitamin D is</p>
<p>going to be the ticket so I would</p>
<p>definitely start taking more vitamin D</p>
<p>if that doesn&rsquo;t help because vitamin D</p>
<p>deficiency is basically make your</p>
<p>calcium not work anymore in your body so</p>
<p>I would then go and acidify the stomach</p>
<p>because that could be other reason why</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not pulling that calcium in so in</p>
<p>that case you want to take pertain how</p>
<p>to chloride or apple cider vinegar to</p>
<p>acidify the stomach so you can start</p>
<p>pulling that those minerals back into</p>
<p>the tissue into the muscle but realize</p>
<p>the the muscle cramps could be other</p>
<p>minerals like potassium deficiency</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t really know what you eat</p>
<p>so you probably better to just do the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder that I have because</p>
<p>that gives you a lot of potassium some</p>
<p>calcium magnesium and that should take</p>
<p>care of it especially if you just</p>
<p>started the ketogenic diet and then one</p>
<p>last thing I was going to mention any</p>
<p>time you take vitamin d3 you need k2</p>
<p>with it because they will both work</p>
<p>together so what will happen the d3 will</p>
<p>help you absorb calcium and then k2 will</p>
<p>stick that calcium all the way into the</p>
<p>bone or the muscle wherever it needs to</p>
<p>go alright thanks for calling hey Stacy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Las Vegas go ahead you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air well you go hi are you having</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>yeah I can hear you perfectly okay great</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>I I think I&rsquo;m holistic and I don&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>any medication and I&rsquo;ve been constipated</p>
<p>for many years</p>
<p>plus I have psoriasis so that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make it any better and probably about</p>
<p>three weeks ago I started taking try not</p>
<p>museum and whole psyllium husk and apple</p>
<p>juice and so now now I&rsquo;ve got perfect</p>
<p>bowel movement twice daily but I notice</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve got some spoilers like a small</p>
<p>lump on the left side of my throat and</p>
<p>like a mucous plug at the back of my</p>
<p>throat so it feels like there&rsquo;s always a</p>
<p>pill stuck like in the back of my</p>
<p>trailer</p>
<p>first I thought it was poking Tribble</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m thinking it my stomach is</p>
<p>overactive because it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>digesting my food right right so</p>
<p>question you mentioned on your tax</p>
<p>acidosis do you feel any acid coming up</p>
<p>now I don&rsquo;t okay so you have no gas oh</p>
<p>wait no I just always feel like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a lump in the back of my clothes</p>
<p>and so when I do take the China using it</p>
<p>feels like it&rsquo;s stuck a little bit do I</p>
<p>drink extra water ah God okay so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really know what your pH is right</p>
<p>no I go okay</p>
<p>and but you&rsquo;ve had constipation for a</p>
<p>long long time right yeah okay</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s just talk about that and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just gonna I I kind of doubt that it is</p>
<p>the enzyme coming up from the stomach</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s causing a the lump in the throat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so rare to have that because you do</p>
<p>have a powerful protein enzyme pep taste</p>
<p>in the stomach that can go up through</p>
<p>Gurdon and start digesting your own</p>
<p>proteins I highly doubt that&rsquo;s what it</p>
<p>is but when you try to eat food and you</p>
<p>swallow things and you feel that little</p>
<p>lump in the throat a lot of people have</p>
<p>that that is really more of a liver</p>
<p>thing the liver there&rsquo;s something going</p>
<p>on with the liver now you could just get</p>
<p>a routine blood test to test</p>
<p>to make sure the enzymes are good but I</p>
<p>have known in the past the liver is</p>
<p>behind that symptom so I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening with these changes but</p>
<p>I will say the best remedy hands down</p>
<p>for the liver would be milk thistle</p>
<p>because that actually has capacity to</p>
<p>repair liver function actually can fix</p>
<p>the liver and it&rsquo;s great for hepatitis</p>
<p>inflammation and cirrhosis and a lot of</p>
<p>other liver issues so I would try that</p>
<p>first and if that doesn&rsquo;t fully work</p>
<p>then I would see if I could do something</p>
<p>to support the gall bladder and see if</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t go away okay thanks for</p>
<p>calling Stacy hey Lisa</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from South Carolina go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air yes after work I was</p>
<p>wondering no you mentioned to always get</p>
<p>plenty of vegetables to kind of flush</p>
<p>out the fat and I&rsquo;m 2 weeks into doing</p>
<p>the keto diet and I was tracking my</p>
<p>macros just because I&rsquo;m in the beginning</p>
<p>stages I&rsquo;m seeing that I&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>around 45 net carbs and all that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty much from vegetables I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if I should try to get that lower</p>
<p>so I can stay in ketosis or that</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t matter because their carbs</p>
<p>coming from vegetables good it&rsquo;s okay to</p>
<p>get a little extra yeah you know what</p>
<p>honestly I don&rsquo;t even count the</p>
<p>vegetables as your carbs I don&rsquo;t count</p>
<p>the car that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>because especially if they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>greens and celery and stuff like that I</p>
<p>can see Tomatoes I can see carrots and</p>
<p>beets but these other vegetables I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even count them so those will not affect</p>
<p>your ketosis in fact that will help you</p>
<p>so it sounds to me like you&rsquo;re well</p>
<p>within the range that you need to be</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just doing vegetables so</p>
<p>I think I think you&rsquo;re doing great okay</p>
<p>no less that&rsquo;s awesome to hear no thank</p>
<p>you so much I appreciate it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome okay see ya hey Robin</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Connecticut yes I am thanks for taking</p>
<p>my call I have a two-part question</p>
<p>one is the long-term I&rsquo;ve been on a</p>
<p>ketogenic diet for about two three weeks</p>
<p>now and I&rsquo;m curious about long-term how</p>
<p>long can you stay on a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>safely and secondly other than you know</p>
<p>calcium magnesium and zinc which I take</p>
<p>along with a multivitamin</p>
<p>what other supplementation should I be</p>
<p>adding to my diet I eat about twenty to</p>
<p>thirty forty net carbs a day okay</p>
<p>all right so good question Robin let me</p>
<p>just handle that the question the last</p>
<p>question first if you&rsquo;re on a ketogenic</p>
<p>diet there&rsquo;s several vitamins that you</p>
<p>want to probably enhance one is the</p>
<p>potassium so the electrolyte powder has</p>
<p>a lot of potassium magnesium calcium and</p>
<p>and all the trace minerals so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important and then the second thing is</p>
<p>the B vitamins you can get that from</p>
<p>nutritional yeast don&rsquo;t get it from some</p>
<p>synthetic pills okay and then the third</p>
<p>thing is trace minerals just simply</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to get so if you take</p>
<p>the liquid trace male minerals and the</p>
<p>electrolyte powder I think you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be fine with your your minerals okay</p>
<p>because everything else you can almost</p>
<p>get from your diet unless you have</p>
<p>weaknesses within the organs now here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk let&rsquo;s talk about long term how long</p>
<p>can you be in the ketogenic diet people</p>
<p>have this idea that the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>is just for weight loss it can create</p>
<p>some serious positive effects for your</p>
<p>health decreasing your risk for</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s memory problems heart</p>
<p>problems high blood pressure strokes why</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re running your body on that</p>
<p>field no longer on sugar fuel the damage</p>
<p>of running your body on glucose is just</p>
<p>off the charts so I look at it is like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something like a maintenance that</p>
<p>you want to be on as long as you want to</p>
<p>be healthy and so you you may be able to</p>
<p>build up enough reserve once you hit</p>
<p>your weight-loss goal you can build up</p>
<p>enough reserve so you can you have</p>
<p>flexibility you can go off the program</p>
<p>and get away with cheating every so</p>
<p>often just as long as you have the full</p>
<p>knowledge of knowing how to get right</p>
<p>back on track</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I just hate the word just</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>diet it&rsquo;s just a way of eating so you</p>
<p>could manipulate your own food because</p>
<p>now you can predict the response that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen you know if you eat this</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re going to feel the next day so</p>
<p>you can just with your own awareness and</p>
<p>a judgement choose what foods you need</p>
<p>to eat because you have the knowledge of</p>
<p>how to use ketosis for example to</p>
<p>improve your health</p>
<p>so I always look at it a great</p>
<p>understanding of how food interacts with</p>
<p>the body and you know some people when</p>
<p>they say that oh ketogenic is dangerous</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re eating all this fat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lie you just basically you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>reducing your cholesterol when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>a ketogenic diet you&rsquo;re running your</p>
<p>body on fat fuel I mean your body makes</p>
<p>3,000 milligrams of cholesterol every</p>
<p>single day so why would you want to</p>
<p>avoid cholesterol your body&rsquo;s just going</p>
<p>to make less if you eat more so I think</p>
<p>I would play it by ear just keep riding</p>
<p>the wave see how you feel</p>
<p>hit your goal and then down the road</p>
<p>choose you know what you want to do but</p>
<p>I always I just recommend I tell people</p>
<p>hey go back to another or at start</p>
<p>adding carbs and see how you feel then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll really know what is better that</p>
<p>way I don&rsquo;t have to tell you you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>experienced it alright thanks Robin hey</p>
<p>James you&rsquo;re from United Kingdom go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the air hey dr. Berg</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a ketogenic diet for the</p>
<p>last ten months I&rsquo;ve lost about 125</p>
<p>pounds Wow my question is around</p>
<p>electrolyte balance yeah apart from just</p>
<p>feeling you know not feeling kind of run</p>
<p>down which is what I recognized you know</p>
<p>when I feeling low on salts is there</p>
<p>some sort of method I can use to</p>
<p>identify whether I have an imbalance and</p>
<p>then act upon it yeah good question</p>
<p>so the electrolytes go far far beyond</p>
<p>just low energy electrolytes are</p>
<p>necessary to build the the gradients</p>
<p>within the cells for transportation of</p>
<p>other nutrition from the contraction and</p>
<p>relaxation of muscle of the conduction</p>
<p>of nerve impulses through the nervous</p>
<p>system like for example let&rsquo;s just take</p>
<p>potassium deficiency if you&rsquo;re low on</p>
<p>potassium you will not be able to</p>
<p>transport the nerves</p>
<p>correctly so you&rsquo;re good at your nerves</p>
<p>are going to be irritated and agitated</p>
<p>and weak potassium is necessary for the</p>
<p>formation of muscles it actually helps</p>
<p>you hold protein in your muscle</p>
<p>so without potassium you start getting</p>
<p>after free prematurely it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>build Bob muscle mass potassium is</p>
<p>necessary for the storage of sugar</p>
<p>called glycogen</p>
<p>so without potassium you can&rsquo;t store</p>
<p>glycogen so you&rsquo;re you store more fat</p>
<p>magnesium is necessary for the heart to</p>
<p>work right and so of potassium too so</p>
<p>without these minerals the heart rhythm</p>
<p>goes out of whack either a high pulse</p>
<p>rate arrhythmias fibrillation all those</p>
<p>things without calcium I mean you have</p>
<p>muscle cramps you have problems with</p>
<p>nerve channels it even increases your</p>
<p>risk for cancer believe it not because</p>
<p>calcium is the main commuter but</p>
<p>communicator between cells so you have</p>
<p>so many functions that extend beyond</p>
<p>fluid balance pH control so if you did a</p>
<p>search on electrolytes in with my name I</p>
<p>I cover all the function electrolytes do</p>
<p>so you can get a grasp of how broad</p>
<p>these are but if you&rsquo;re doing all the</p>
<p>vegetables that you need I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get a lot electrolytes but</p>
<p>probably if you&rsquo;re in a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>that tends to require a need for more</p>
<p>especially if you add on exercise all</p>
<p>right thanks James hey Jennifer you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Houston Texas go ahead you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the air yes my question is about casting</p>
<p>I have been fasting for the last four</p>
<p>weeks I know I&rsquo;m insulin resistant but</p>
<p>my question is my sugar is still spiking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still going up I mean even after 24</p>
<p>hours it&rsquo;s still going over 200 what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going up though would that mean your</p>
<p>blood sugar like my sugar okay so does</p>
<p>that mean that I should fast longer to</p>
<p>try to get myself back into regular ARD</p>
<p>good good question Jennifer in fact I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to go to the board and I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to demonstrate</p>
<p>trait this to you okay so if I could</p>
<p>have the attention of the producer over</p>
<p>there a producer producer I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>go to the board so just check this out</p>
<p>all right so right here we have this</p>
<p>thing called the pancreas and have the</p>
<p>liver okay</p>
<p>so insulin resistance is a situation</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s insulin it&rsquo;s resistance so the</p>
<p>body doesn&rsquo;t like too much insulin it</p>
<p>rejection it rejects it it&rsquo;s toxic to</p>
<p>the body it likes just the right amount</p>
<p>so if you take if you increase too much</p>
<p>insulin it will block it from the system</p>
<p>okay so now what happens in the cells in</p>
<p>the liver and other cells we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have low insulin low glucose now the</p>
<p>pancreas detects it because there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>more communication back here so you</p>
<p>actually the feedback is that it&rsquo;s low</p>
<p>so the pancreas says oh really so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>make more so it starts to increase more</p>
<p>insulin by five to seven times so we</p>
<p>have a situation where your body is</p>
<p>starving of insulin and glucose yet we</p>
<p>have five to seven times more insulin</p>
<p>running through the body but not going</p>
<p>into the cells so it&rsquo;s ineffective</p>
<p>insulin that&rsquo;s where you have all the</p>
<p>damage and the runaway blood sugar</p>
<p>control so you mentioned in a minute</p>
<p>fasting because one of the problems with</p>
<p>insulin is that when you eat you</p>
<p>increase insulin right so what you want</p>
<p>to do is not eat for periods of time and</p>
<p>yeah if you could do it that&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>way to do it like two meals or three</p>
<p>meals a day without any snacking go to</p>
<p>two meals in fact if you really want to</p>
<p>be successful that will start lowering</p>
<p>the insulin and your blood sugars will</p>
<p>come down down down there&rsquo;s other things</p>
<p>you can do to heal insulin resistance</p>
<p>okay chromium and I think you</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve been watching my videos I have</p>
<p>something called insulin and glucose</p>
<p>support that has all these nutrients and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you but potassium</p>
<p>chromium apple cider vinegar magnesium</p>
<p>all these minerals B vitamins b1 all</p>
<p>that increases the receptiveness of this</p>
<p>right here so now that we cut out the</p>
<p>sugar cut out the junk food eat</p>
<p>infrequent add the nutrients this starts</p>
<p>working better we get the signals that</p>
<p>come back here to turn off this this</p>
<p>insulin so basically over time your</p>
<p>instant becomes lower lower and lower</p>
<p>and lower and then the need for the</p>
<p>pancreas to produce insulin becomes less</p>
<p>and you can start to heal then your</p>
<p>blood sugars will come down okay so let</p>
<p>me just plug this thing back in here</p>
<p>alright so that&rsquo;s how I would give it</p>
<p>more time I would add those nutrients</p>
<p>and then see what else you can do by</p>
<p>maybe going to two meals instead of</p>
<p>three without any snacks and make sure</p>
<p>you add fat to that because that way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll go longer without having to eat</p>
<p>thanks Jennifer hey Tim you&rsquo;re from New</p>
<p>York City go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>hey dr. Berg thanks for taking my call</p>
<p>umm they also want to thank your wife at</p>
<p>a great recipes okay um alright really</p>
<p>enjoying it I&rsquo;ve been following you for</p>
<p>a couple of months now I dropped 40</p>
<p>pounds Wow in probably about three</p>
<p>months that&rsquo;s great yep yeah feels great</p>
<p>recently I get in some pains in the back</p>
<p>of my quads it&rsquo;s a constant pain first</p>
<p>started out only when I was sleeping but</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s like in the day and everything</p>
<p>whenever I&rsquo;m you know all day long</p>
<p>Oh calm I&rsquo;m also doing your wheat grass</p>
<p>for about this about a month okay um and</p>
<p>my question is to end up doing apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar with the lemon and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just curious is there possible to overdo</p>
<p>the apple cider vinegar okay can you get</p>
<p>too much ash good question well is it in</p>
<p>both hand strings yes okay it tends to</p>
<p>lean more constant on the left okay do</p>
<p>you or anybody comes back</p>
<p>good for the boat do you have any old</p>
<p>injuries to the hamstrings no I&rsquo;ll cut</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware I mean oh okay</p>
<p>so yeah you can always over Dover do the</p>
<p>opposite of vinegar but if you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>taking like a teaspoon even with each</p>
<p>meal you&rsquo;re not going to overdo it in</p>
<p>fact that should actually help get rid</p>
<p>of lactic acid in the muscle but the</p>
<p>cramps in the muscle you usually come</p>
<p>from either potassium deficiency but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking the wheatgrass so chances</p>
<p>are it&rsquo;s not potassium so it can then</p>
<p>also be vitamin d3 vitamin d3 could do</p>
<p>it too so that&rsquo;s one thing I would look</p>
<p>at and the last thing I would look at is</p>
<p>vitamin b1 because those are the key</p>
<p>nutrients that become depleted on the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet so if you took some</p>
<p>nutritional yeast that may help you</p>
<p>greatly</p>
<p>okay so b1 additional use of vitamin D</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re already getting the</p>
<p>wheatgrass so you should have enough</p>
<p>potassium so that&rsquo;s what I would go</p>
<p>after last thing Tim you can actually</p>
<p>massage with a foam roller your</p>
<p>quadriceps on both side sides to</p>
<p>actually knock out any pain in your in</p>
<p>your hamstrings and the reason I&rsquo;m asked</p>
<p>about the old injury is because the</p>
<p>question is why is it in your hamstring</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t it all in all muscles okay</p>
<p>well there could be a pre-existing old</p>
<p>injury there I don&rsquo;t know all right</p>
<p>thanks for calling Tim hey Jennifer</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from New Hampshire go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air hi dr. Berg I&rsquo;m on day</p>
<p>six of keto which I decided to start</p>
<p>doing because I have dance Lyme disease</p>
<p>and I want to get rid of the</p>
<p>inflammation so I watched all of your</p>
<p>videos before I started to make sure I</p>
<p>did everything right the right macros my</p>
<p>potassium but since about day three or</p>
<p>day four I&rsquo;ve had extreme bloating which</p>
<p>gets worse after I eat and really loose</p>
<p>stools so I&rsquo;m very uncomfortable and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what could be causing it or</p>
<p>what to do about it okay Jennifer quick</p>
<p>question did you change anything right</p>
<p>before you got the bloating I owe the</p>
<p>only thing I&rsquo;ve changed I&rsquo;ve been you</p>
<p>know at the 20 to 40 grams of fat and</p>
<p>the three to six ounces of protein for</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>to four months the only thing I changed</p>
<p>was reducing the carbs okay and getting</p>
<p>all those greens in that you say about</p>
<p>the cups yeah what kind of fad are you</p>
<p>eating um everything um you know olive</p>
<p>oils coconut oils MC ki egg I think I</p>
<p>think what&rsquo;s happening Jennifer I think</p>
<p>when you start to ketogenic diet that</p>
<p>the very the the wild variable is the</p>
<p>fats people just aren&rsquo;t used to</p>
<p>consuming that much oil and fat I would</p>
<p>cut that down</p>
<p>especially the MCTS which are extra oils</p>
<p>and some of the other oils because</p>
<p>bloating is really is a lack of bile so</p>
<p>we can add the gall bladder formula if</p>
<p>we want but I think the first thing I</p>
<p>would do is I would cut out some of the</p>
<p>oils and see how you feel and that</p>
<p>should take care of it because you are</p>
<p>consuming a lot of fat there that you</p>
<p>might not be used to you have to</p>
<p>gradually build up to it so I think that</p>
<p>should help you a lot Jennifer thanks</p>
<p>for calling hey Debbie you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Ontario go ahead question hi doctor it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in regards to liver cleanse I&rsquo;m 63 I</p>
<p>have IBS I have to go for colonoscopies</p>
<p>every three or four years because they</p>
<p>find polyps</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m juice fasting right now with some</p>
<p>salads in the evening my doctor has</p>
<p>diagnosed gallstones and yet I do not</p>
<p>have any symptoms so I&rsquo;ve been googling</p>
<p>golf stones and I&rsquo;ve seen on on YouTube</p>
<p>where I could probably do a liver</p>
<p>cleanse to get rid of them and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your opinion on this doctor who&rsquo;ll de</p>
<p>Clark that&rsquo;s online and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>recommending I mean she&rsquo;s passed away</p>
<p>now but she&rsquo;s always recommended liver</p>
<p>cleanses and stuff like that yeah are</p>
<p>they safe liver cleansers good question</p>
<p>Debbie I&rsquo;ve done her cleanses they are</p>
<p>to the extreme</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking like massively extreme I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t keep it and I&rsquo;ve really been</p>
<p>into cleanses the problem</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re too short term they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>fix the real problem they do a short</p>
<p>cleanse and then BOOM</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really go into the diet I</p>
<p>personally would just change your eating</p>
<p>I would not do a juice fast</p>
<p>why because regardless of what where</p>
<p>that juice comes from it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>spike insulin which kales of the stones</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>the best thing to do is believe it or</p>
<p>not you need to do things that increase</p>
<p>more bile okay one is the goal but a</p>
<p>formula to help dissolve the current</p>
<p>stones you have but think about bio what</p>
<p>it does without bio you develop stones</p>
<p>bio helps you break down fats and the</p>
<p>question is what triggers bile saturated</p>
<p>fats I&rsquo;m not saying go crazy with it but</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to do a low-fat diet you</p>
<p>can start adding fats to the diet egg</p>
<p>yolks which are high in lecithin and</p>
<p>choline which help dissolve the stones</p>
<p>so I think personally the the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet would be the best thing long-term</p>
<p>of course you&rsquo;re going to do a lot of</p>
<p>vegetables and this ketogenic diet</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also going to intermittent</p>
<p>fasting which will bring insulin down</p>
<p>and thereby get rid of the stones so</p>
<p>again I mean in my first and second and</p>
<p>third book I recommended a liver</p>
<p>enhancement or the cleanse don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recommend it anymore because it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really fix the problem I remember doing</p>
<p>a cleanse once where I took epson salts</p>
<p>okay two or three ounces of epsom salts</p>
<p>12 ounces of olive oil beet tablets I</p>
<p>did that like three times a day for a</p>
<p>week and I&rsquo;m drinking this stuff down</p>
<p>and laying on the right side I almost</p>
<p>died because those those things got</p>
<p>stuck in my throat and I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>breathe and I was I don&rsquo;t want to get</p>
<p>into the details but it was not pretty</p>
<p>but again I had to I test at all these</p>
<p>cleanses out I&rsquo;ve been cold emmos called</p>
<p>Kol Emma&rsquo;s which is a combination</p>
<p>between an enema and colonic and then</p>
<p>colonics and enemas</p>
<p>all those are good I mean to some degree</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t really get to the heart</p>
<p>of it which is my eating long term they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t correct that did a temporary</p>
<p>little flush but the amount of toxins</p>
<p>that are in our bodies</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s astronomical so you have to do it</p>
<p>slowly over a period of time or</p>
<p>sometimes people even get sick hey carry</p>
<p>on you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re from Calgary</p>
<p>how are you doctor how are you this</p>
<p>morning</p>
<p>great thank you for taking my call my my</p>
<p>daughter and I have just recently</p>
<p>discovered you I have a 12 year old</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to soon be 13 and at age</p>
<p>four and a half she was diagnosed with a</p>
<p>very rare condition and went through the</p>
<p>surgery and then the following year she</p>
<p>led to a very traumatic event again</p>
<p>something similar related to her anatomy</p>
<p>and then the third year when she was</p>
<p>sick</p>
<p>perhaps should we had a third surgery</p>
<p>and after that she went through her</p>
<p>parents divorce so she&rsquo;s been through a</p>
<p>lot of trauma and she the surgeries were</p>
<p>on her tummy and so she&rsquo;s carrying a</p>
<p>their significant amount of weight on</p>
<p>her tummy but also I think overall and</p>
<p>so I know that she would definitely be</p>
<p>an adrenal type I think she may also</p>
<p>have some tyroid going on as well it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bit of so Kerry just to give me the real</p>
<p>quick summary as she right now she has a</p>
<p>bloated stomach yeah her coming like</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s carrying a significant amount of</p>
<p>weight under tummy okay and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wondering about the keto four kids got</p>
<p>it okay well first of all I want to say</p>
<p>I actually in college I went to Calgary</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great city</p>
<p>yeah I was up there and had a great</p>
<p>adventure so that was that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>that you lived there so anyway yes okay</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet is really good for</p>
<p>kids amazing for kids you want to</p>
<p>definitely do make sure that she does</p>
<p>three meals a day because what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to happen it&rsquo;s going to lower insulin</p>
<p>and you can make all sorts of really</p>
<p>cool delicious pleasurable treats for</p>
<p>your child so it&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>depriving them of anything just without</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>but yeah I would do that because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to reduce insulin and insulin is</p>
<p>the number one thing that creates</p>
<p>inflammation in the gut and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>even people like let&rsquo;s say they wake up</p>
<p>the money with somewhat of a flat</p>
<p>stomach and then they at the end of day</p>
<p>they got this distended stomach that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>insulin now it could be cortisol from</p>
<p>stress and it sounds like she&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>through stress but by fixing the insulin</p>
<p>factor that will automatically decrease</p>
<p>the cortisol and she will do much better</p>
<p>with that bloating she probably would</p>
<p>also bend it for him from the what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called cortisol the adrenal and cortisol</p>
<p>relief which basically just helps</p>
<p>cortisol help stress relief helps her</p>
<p>sleep things like that so I would</p>
<p>recommend that highly recommend it for a</p>
<p>thirteen-year-old for sure and be</p>
<p>surprised how many conditions can go</p>
<p>away from that thanks Karen</p>
<p>hey Logan you&rsquo;re from Texas go ahead</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the air hey doctor hey so I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been watching you for a long time and</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;ve been on the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet for a year now and I was</p>
<p>diagnosed with the stage 4 gob of Stella</p>
<p>brain tumor in March of 2016 and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened now is been removed I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>through radiation and I&rsquo;m currently</p>
<p>going through my last round of oil chemo</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been amazing how great this is</p>
<p>all been there&rsquo;s been no reoccurrence</p>
<p>then some of the best result they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever seen and I&rsquo;m still able to work out</p>
<p>at a hundred percent level six days a</p>
<p>week I&rsquo;m fasting about 18 hours a day</p>
<p>and tracked my macros daily but I was</p>
<p>just wondering if you have anything else</p>
<p>that you think that I should potentially</p>
<p>add in basically say I&rsquo;m asking what</p>
<p>would you do if you were diagnosed with</p>
<p>the stage 4 you know brain tumor what</p>
<p>would you do to prevent it from coming</p>
<p>back again yeah ok those two things I</p>
<p>would do very good question Logan</p>
<p>personally I think you&rsquo;ve been through a</p>
<p>lot of than trauma after I guess they</p>
<p>took it out and then did everything else</p>
<p>so you want to repair the immune system</p>
<p>and what I would do I would buy the</p>
<p>highest</p>
<p>quality colostrum powder that you could</p>
<p>find and I would take that before bed I</p>
<p>would take a big huge beam tablespoon of</p>
<p>that stuff before bed why because that</p>
<p>basically will repair and build up your</p>
<p>immune system it&rsquo;s wonderful to repair a</p>
<p>broken-down immune system sounds like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing really good but that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>extra step that will over time gradually</p>
<p>bulletproof you immune system the next</p>
<p>thing I would do and I talk about this a</p>
<p>lot a lot of videos as I would just</p>
<p>consume cruciferous on a regular basis</p>
<p>if you look at the textbook on Texaco</p>
<p>toxicology which is the study of poisons</p>
<p>and you turn to the chapter where all</p>
<p>the tumors are I mean it&rsquo;s just like all</p>
<p>the chemicals it&rsquo;s all the chemicals so</p>
<p>what you have to do is you have to do</p>
<p>organic everything non-gmo and I think</p>
<p>the SS the estrogen balanced with dim</p>
<p>would be probably one of the best</p>
<p>products and of course the cruciferous</p>
<p>combined with that but that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would do Logan if I were you but it</p>
<p>sounds like you&rsquo;re on the right track</p>
<p>keep sugars down as low as possible and</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not going to return that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my opinion</p>
<p>hey Rob you&rsquo;re from South Carolina go</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;re on the air</p>
<p>hi dr. Burt thank you very much for</p>
<p>taking my call sure I appreciate it your</p>
<p>videos are great so I enjoy watching a</p>
<p>man every day Thanks</p>
<p>so my question is I started kind of keto</p>
<p>I started with Wheat Belly back in</p>
<p>January I&rsquo;d done it before I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>kind of been low carb I gave up bread</p>
<p>and grains about five years ago but I</p>
<p>lost a lot of weight I slowly integrated</p>
<p>potatoes again and french fries and</p>
<p>tater tots so I put on about 60 pounds</p>
<p>again so in January I started it again</p>
<p>you know I gave up all the grit of all</p>
<p>the carbs basically Aikido and then</p>
<p>watching your videos and you talked</p>
<p>about insulin resistance and how that</p>
<p>blocks fat-burning and I also have</p>
<p>anxiety disorder so that creates</p>
<p>especially with the diet change it kind</p>
<p>of increased what I would imagine</p>
<p>increase my cortisol though my fat</p>
<p>burning is blocked and I&rsquo;m not taking in</p>
<p>carbs I haven&rsquo;t been feeling that good</p>
<p>muscles get tired real fast</p>
<p>I can do Squatch it&rsquo;s like the strength</p>
<p>is there but they seem to wear out so if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not burning fat and I&rsquo;m not burning</p>
<p>my fat and I&rsquo;m not taking in sugar what</p>
<p>am i burning then well your your sounds</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re in the transition phase Rob</p>
<p>of adapting to the ketosis so what</p>
<p>happens is over time when you start</p>
<p>developing in some resistance it becomes</p>
<p>more stubborn more stubborn it takes</p>
<p>more and more time you could take you</p>
<p>know one two even two months to fully</p>
<p>adapt where you feel good and it sounds</p>
<p>to me like you have symptoms of you know</p>
<p>keto flu which is kind of weak muscles</p>
<p>kind of not as strong as possible and</p>
<p>for that you need potassium potassium</p>
<p>citrate I think you would benefit from</p>
<p>the electrolyte powder that I have</p>
<p>because that has all the electrolytes</p>
<p>with no maltodextrin no sugar and it</p>
<p>really will recharge the cells and knock</p>
<p>out these side effects from the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet that does tend to deplete</p>
<p>potassium and you&rsquo;ll start feeling</p>
<p>stronger from that and you have minimal</p>
<p>damage the other thing you need to get</p>
<p>is the nutritional yeast and start</p>
<p>taking that that will give you the B</p>
<p>vitamin so if you have the minerals with</p>
<p>the B vitamins you should get into</p>
<p>ketosis a lot faster but I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in the you&rsquo;re in the transition period</p>
<p>right now where the fact that you have</p>
<p>these symptoms and you have anxiety</p>
<p>means that you&rsquo;re not fully there yet</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get there give it more</p>
<p>time but the anxiety will go away with</p>
<p>the B vitamins as soon as you take the</p>
<p>nutritional yeast take a tablespoon a</p>
<p>day and you&rsquo;ll start feeling better</p>
<p>thanks Rob hey Leanne you&rsquo;re from Ohio</p>
<p>go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air hi dr. Burke</p>
<p>thanks for taking my call I called you</p>
<p>last week and I wanted to let you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost another pound and a half so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found five and a half pounds Wow in</p>
<p>three weeks right so but I thought I was</p>
<p>um my question is that I thought I was</p>
<p>like no sugars at all and then when I</p>
<p>was looking at some of my like my</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s two G drinks and some of my</p>
<p>coconut macaroons they have organic cane</p>
<p>sugar organic coconut nectar organic</p>
<p>coconut sugar palm sugar and I know you</p>
<p>said to stay with stevia I wanted to</p>
<p>make sure if that those works not if</p>
<p>these were things that it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>supposed to be taking and also I have</p>
<p>one other question with a weak grass</p>
<p>I ordered it before I saw you and I got</p>
<p>it from Australia and you were talking</p>
<p>about how the trace minerals and all</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have here in our country</p>
<p>what do you think that would be a good I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t hate to throw it away yeah but if</p>
<p>I have to I will here&rsquo;s a question is</p>
<p>that we crass powder or wheatgrass and</p>
<p>juice powder it a powder yeah I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna say to throw it away but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically hey it&rsquo;s the fiber without the</p>
<p>the real good things the juice is really</p>
<p>it takes a whole tray of wheatgrass to</p>
<p>make 1tsp of wheatgrass juice powder</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re getting is you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>getting the fiber part with a little</p>
<p>tiny juice so there&rsquo;s a big difference</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s bad for you it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fiber but the wheatgrass juice powder is</p>
<p>a is no fiber so you get just the</p>
<p>straight nutrients so use it up use it</p>
<p>up and then try mine I think you&rsquo;ll like</p>
<p>it because it&rsquo;s very high-quality and</p>
<p>getting a lot of response to that now as</p>
<p>far as the hidden sugars yes coconut</p>
<p>nectar coconut sugar is way too high you</p>
<p>want to do with your xylitol we through</p>
<p>tall or acedia yeah I wouldn&rsquo;t do that I</p>
<p>would cut that up and that really brings</p>
<p>us to the situation you have to restart</p>
<p>really reading labels because it is</p>
<p>hidden in so many things and dressings</p>
<p>and sauces and and especially going out</p>
<p>to dinner forget it I mean it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>really go no sugar but that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>have to cut out and you&rsquo;ll lose even</p>
<p>more weight hey George you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Toronto</p>
<p>go ahead mark good morning</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great day yes it&rsquo;s raining</p>
<p>outside but it&rsquo;s still great I ask you</p>
<p>two questions first of all in your</p>
<p>videos you don&rsquo;t have any forward</p>
<p>lymphatic system the wet system</p>
<p>lymphatic system lymphatic</p>
<p>yeah I do have a video on what is the</p>
<p>lymphatic system you can search that out</p>
<p>but you should find it okay next</p>
<p>question is about the kombucha tea and</p>
<p>overdosing I just did and I realized</p>
<p>hard way that is not good</p>
<p>even though kombucha tea is very useful</p>
<p>and very nice to drink right the next</p>
<p>question I have is what is your zodiac</p>
<p>sign well good question but what</p>
<p>probably won&rsquo;t get into those signs or</p>
<p>whatever red in this conversation but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about the kombucha tea yeah I</p>
<p>overdid it once because what happens the</p>
<p>kombucha tea really can put you into a</p>
<p>more acidic state which your pulse rate</p>
<p>starts to go up and you start showing</p>
<p>signs of acidosis I mean it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>dangerous but it&rsquo;s just like then you</p>
<p>need to take some calcium calcium</p>
<p>magnesium to start to bring your pH back</p>
<p>into a balance but the point is that</p>
<p>yeah you can overdo it so kombucha is</p>
<p>very strong lactic acid at the very most</p>
<p>in one sitting you take a half of a jar</p>
<p>not the whole thing because you can</p>
<p>actually keep you up at night</p>
<p>a little bit will calm you down too much</p>
<p>can kind of keep you up all right</p>
<p>hey Debbie you are on the air from</p>
<p>Colorado okay first of all I want to say</p>
<p>thank you for all that you do and all</p>
<p>your research it has helped tremendously</p>
<p>and I I really believe in your program</p>
<p>and my question is is that I mean I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to keep my fat down because I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>very small person I&rsquo;m very overweight</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m small I&rsquo;m only I&rsquo;m 49 and so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to keep the fat down but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>having trouble getting into protein</p>
<p>without going over the fat got it</p>
<p>okay Debbie good question Debbie</p>
<p>honestly I would not try to go low-fat</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s naturally in the protein like</p>
<p>for example let&rsquo;s say you had a</p>
<p>hamburger that&rsquo;s 85 percent right eat</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t call low fat protein because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to spike your insulin I</p>
<p>think you just need to just not add</p>
<p>extra fat to the meal anytime nature&rsquo;s</p>
<p>provided protein with fat eat it in that</p>
<p>combination like the eggs with egg yolks</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to put more weight on you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to give you more calories</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to cause more weight</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re doing three meals a</p>
<p>day with no snacks or even two meals a</p>
<p>day but I would not worry about that at</p>
<p>all you want to do more of a natural</p>
<p>fatty or protein all right good question</p>
<p>hey Bonnie</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Pennsylvania go ahead you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the air oh thank you for taking my</p>
<p>call I&rsquo;d say a two questions my first</p>
<p>question is I have it all happened it</p>
<p>happened on one day um fatty deposits on</p>
<p>both sides of my eye there I mean like</p>
<p>my eyelid and you know they&rsquo;re slightly</p>
<p>yellowish I I looked it up in his eye</p>
<p>condition like this with an axe</p>
<p>and they said it cholesterol deposits</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s starting to happen</p>
<p>underneath my eye - and um I lost my</p>
<p>gallbladder six years ago and I&rsquo;m 49 my</p>
<p>hormones are actually a mess right now</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m taking a lot of things but I</p>
<p>think I chose I chose the adrenal kit</p>
<p>and I think I&rsquo;m probably the ovary kit</p>
<p>would have been better for me I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already been through about a month but I</p>
<p>still don&rsquo;t sleep well like you know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>yeah so I think I picked hormones so</p>
<p>Bonnie this is what I would get um I was</p>
<p>always thinking thinking gallbladder if</p>
<p>you cholesterol you get to cluster</p>
<p>deposit from the eye that&rsquo;s really the</p>
<p>failure to process the cholesterol</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have enough bile</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the simplicity of it so basically</p>
<p>what we want to do is we want to have a</p>
<p>cool effect with my new lighting system</p>
<p>I have here</p>
<p>what we want to do is we want to just</p>
<p>add the gallbladder formula you have it</p>
<p>in the adrenal kit you have an adrenal</p>
<p>kit and just take probably one after a</p>
<p>meal or two after a meal and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to find that that should be enough</p>
<p>to handle it the other thing that you</p>
<p>want to do is take choline as a</p>
<p>supplement choline will help to thin the</p>
<p>bile so you&rsquo;ll start to do well in that</p>
<p>but as far as your meals go probably not</p>
<p>going to have to add any fats to the</p>
<p>meal just consume the natural fats that</p>
<p>are in that protein you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>fine but the missing link is the bile</p>
<p>you just need a little bit more bile</p>
<p>Bonnie and that should handle it okay</p>
<p>hey Deborah you are on the air from</p>
<p>Ontario I think I already figured</p>
<p>another question or is this another</p>
<p>person from Ontario no is a different</p>
<p>person okay completely i am i was born</p>
<p>with something called congenital</p>
<p>nystagmus the left side of my brain and</p>
<p>it defects and as an adult</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like sorta grew out of some of the</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not my head wobbling and things</p>
<p>like that but it caused me to be legally</p>
<p>blind any other doctors is there</p>
<p>something wrong with my eyeballs the</p>
<p>eyes themselves and so i mean i&rsquo;m sixty</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve always because i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following a lot closer healthy lifestyle</p>
<p>and diet in nutrition and keeps doses</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s led me to wonder that whether i</p>
<p>could assess my vision or through other</p>
<p>means like could i i take hi GH dia a</p>
<p>fish oil like the high one</p>
<p>and magnesium all the things that will</p>
<p>calm my nervous system because the more</p>
<p>stimulated I am the more my vision will</p>
<p>the eyes will start to jump and I just</p>
<p>wondered your thoughts about you know</p>
<p>helping the brain - I don&rsquo;t know maybe</p>
<p>correct some of the things that are</p>
<p>wrong there they don&rsquo;t really tell you</p>
<p>because they just say it&rsquo;s that in it</p>
<p>and I do have cousins but all of us have</p>
<p>a different type of symptom mine is this</p>
<p>God and down okay</p>
<p>great question Debra there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>things that come to mind to help what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really talking about is</p>
<p>neurotransmitters in the brain which are</p>
<p>probably off so there&rsquo;s a couple things</p>
<p>that you can take one is the the main</p>
<p>fat in the brain is DHA if you took that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a healthy fat it&rsquo;s in fish oils I</p>
<p>think you might be already taken but</p>
<p>take a real high-quality one like</p>
<p>extra-virgin cod liver oil okay so that</p>
<p>will give you that healthy fat there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two other things called</p>
<p>Sammy it&rsquo;s called sa M then put a small</p>
<p>e Sammy is a a natural compound in your</p>
<p>body to help you make all the</p>
<p>neurotransmitters so if you were to take</p>
<p>that with vitamin b6 I think that would</p>
<p>help as a precursor to help build up the</p>
<p>neurotransmitters and help balance</p>
<p>things so you&rsquo;re not overly excited in</p>
<p>the brain neurotransmitters so those are</p>
<p>some quick things and the last thing is</p>
<p>potassium you need a lot of potassium to</p>
<p>help the nervous system chill out so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not too heavy on the flight or</p>
<p>flight mechanism so those are the things</p>
<p>that I would recommend but thank you so</p>
<p>much for calling okay Paula you are the</p>
<p>last caller from Connecticut go ahead</p>
<p>you are on the air</p>
<p>Hey you&rsquo;re listening to your radio I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re going to have to turn your</p>
<p>radio down and talk okay okay now I can</p>
<p>hear you go ahead oh yeah I can hear you</p>
<p>computer in the background or your radio</p>
<p>probably the computer</p>
<p>oh she clicked up okay cool so hey</p>
<p>listen guys thank you so much for tuning</p>
<p>in I&rsquo;m going to see you next week at 9</p>
<p>at the same time same place okay</p>
