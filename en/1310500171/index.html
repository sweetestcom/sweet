    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Sagar Anjati.</p>
<p>He is a DC based political correspondent,</p>
<p>host of The Rising with Crystal Ball</p>
<p>and host of the realignment podcast with Marshall Kozloff.</p>
<p>He has interviewed Donald Trump four times</p>
<p>and has interviewed a lot of major political figures</p>
<p>and human beings who wield power.</p>
<p>He loves policy and loves history,</p>
<p>which makes him a great person to sail</p>
<p>through the sometimes stormy waters of political discourse.</p>
<p>He showed up to this conversation with a gift</p>
<p>of the second volume of Ian Kershaw&rsquo;s biography on Hitler,</p>
<p>a two volume set that is widely acknowledged</p>
<p>as one of the greatest, if not the greatest,</p>
<p>most definitive studies of Hitler.</p>
<p>Nothing wins my heart faster on a first meeting</p>
<p>or first date than a great book about the darkest aspects</p>
<p>of human nature and human history.</p>
<p>I think I started saying that as a joke,</p>
<p>but actually there&rsquo;s probably a lot of truth to it.</p>
<p>I love it when we skip the small talk</p>
<p>and go straight to the in depth conversation</p>
<p>about the best and worst of human nature.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that for better or for worse,</p>
<p>I would like to avoid the trap</p>
<p>of surface political bickering of the day.</p>
<p>I do find politics fascinating,</p>
<p>but not the talking points produced</p>
<p>by the industrial engagement complex</p>
<p>of red versus blue division.</p>
<p>Instead, I&rsquo;m fascinated by human beings who seek power</p>
<p>and how power changes them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a political affiliation</p>
<p>and my ideas, at least I hope so,</p>
<p>are defined more by curiosity and learning</p>
<p>in the face of uncertainty</p>
<p>and less by the echo chambers who tell me</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m supposed to think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly evolving, learning,</p>
<p>and doing my best to do so without ego and with empathy.</p>
<p>Please be patient with me.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m aware,</p>
<p>I do not have any derangement syndromes,</p>
<p>nor do I get a medical prescription</p>
<p>of blue, red, white, or black pills.</p>
<p>If I say something, I say it because I&rsquo;m genuinely thinking</p>
<p>and struggling with the ideas.</p>
<p>I have no agenda, just a bit of a hope</p>
<p>to add more love to the world.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Sagar Anjati.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no better gifts in this world</p>
<p>than a book about Hitler, so thank you so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a gift when we were just talking about flying,</p>
<p>the watch from Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>and this almost beats it.</p>
<p>So tell me what this particular book on Hitler is.</p>
<p>So this is volume two.</p>
<p>Yes, so this is Ian Kershaw.</p>
<p>He wrote the famous two volume on Hitler.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big book nerd,</p>
<p>and I spend a lot of time reading biographies in particular.</p>
<p>So this one, if you need a one volume,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,&rsquo; right?</p>
<p>I think you talked about that, William Shire,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s like Hitler&rsquo;s rise,</p>
<p>Nazi Germany, the war, et cetera.</p>
<p>But I like bios because a good biography</p>
<p>is story of the times, right?</p>
<p>And so this one, the first volume, it does exactly that,</p>
<p>which is that it doesn&rsquo;t just tell the story of Hitler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the context of this kid in Austria,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got all these dreams,</p>
<p>but then actually pretty courageous</p>
<p>in terms of World War I, right?</p>
<p>Gets pinned to metal on by the Kaiser.</p>
<p>And then what it&rsquo;s like to lose World War I,</p>
<p>and actually lose this stain,</p>
<p>and then the rise within, everybody knows that story,</p>
<p>the Beer Hall Putsch and all that.</p>
<p>This one I like, and the reason I like Kershaw</p>
<p>is obviously number one, it&rsquo;s English,</p>
<p>which is actually hard, right?</p>
<p>Like in order to write that story,</p>
<p>who can do both the primary source material</p>
<p>and then translate it for people like us,</p>
<p>but he tells the dynamic story of Hitler so well</p>
<p>in the second volume, just like the level of detail.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about this, Lex,</p>
<p>like what was it like inside that room,</p>
<p>inside with Chamberlain?</p>
<p>Like what was it like in terms of who was this</p>
<p>like magnetic madman who did convince</p>
<p>the smartest people in the world at the time?</p>
<p>And up until like 1940, the Soviet gamble,</p>
<p>like it took tremendous risks, but like highly calculated,</p>
<p>thinking, no, no, no, I&rsquo;m not gonna pay for this one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna pay for this one.</p>
<p>And it put himself, he had a remarkable ability,</p>
<p>not just to put himself in the minds of the German people,</p>
<p>but in terms of his adversaries,</p>
<p>like with when he was across from Mussolini.</p>
<p>Calculate, he&rsquo;s like, how exactly did Mussolini,</p>
<p>the guy who created fascism,</p>
<p>becomes like second fiddle to Hitler?</p>
<p>Think it&rsquo;s an amazing bio.</p>
<p>And yeah, like Ian Kershaw, along with Richard Evans,</p>
<p>two of my favorite authors on the Third Reich, no question.</p>
<p>Do you think he was born this way,</p>
<p>that charisma, whatever that is?</p>
<p>Or was it something he developed strategically?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the question you apply</p>
<p>to some of the great leaders.</p>
<p>Was he just a madman who had the instinct</p>
<p>to be able to control people</p>
<p>in the room together with them?</p>
<p>Or is this like, he worked at it?</p>
<p>I think he worked at it.</p>
<p>But also, there is an innate quality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m forgetting his name, his lifelong,</p>
<p>Rudolf, the one who flew to Berlin in like 1940.</p>
<p>I forget his name, anyway.</p>
<p>So he helped Hitler write Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>And he was like slavishly devoted to him in prison.</p>
<p>This is 1925 or something like that.</p>
<p>And so you read that and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>well, how does he get this like crank wacko</p>
<p>to basically believe he&rsquo;s like the second coming,</p>
<p>help him write this book?</p>
<p>I mean, literally, they live together in the prison cell</p>
<p>and they wake up every day.</p>
<p>And as he was composing Mein Kampf</p>
<p>and because of the Beer Hall Putsch and all that,</p>
<p>had this like absolute ability to gather people around him.</p>
<p>I think his greatest skill was,</p>
<p>is he was just a very good politician, truly.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at his ability</p>
<p>in order to read coalitional politics</p>
<p>and then convince exactly the right people</p>
<p>in order to follow him.</p>
<p>I think I heard you ask this once</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve thought about it a lot,</p>
<p>which is like, who could have stopped Hitler in Germany?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always like the ever present question.</p>
<p>Of course, like the whole baby Hitler thing.</p>
<p>Really the answer is Hindenburg.</p>
<p>Like Hindenburg was the person who could have stopped</p>
<p>and had the immense standing within the German public.</p>
<p>The only real like war hero</p>
<p>definitely was personally skeptical of fascism and Nazism.</p>
<p>And didn&rsquo;t like Hitler.</p>
<p>And didn&rsquo;t like him and he knew he was full of shit.</p>
<p>He was like, yeah, I think this guy is dangerous.</p>
<p>I think this guy could do a lot of damage to the Republic.</p>
<p>But he acceded basically to Hitler at the time.</p>
<p>And I think that he was one of the main people</p>
<p>who could have done something about it.</p>
<p>And also he was able to convince the generals, the military.</p>
<p>I mean, that was very interesting.</p>
<p>And to convince Chamberlain and the other political leaders.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I often think about</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re just reading books about these people.</p>
<p>I think about what like Jeffrey Epstein, for example.</p>
<p>Like evil people, not evil,</p>
<p>but people have done evil things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not go to the Dan Carlin thing of what is evil.</p>
<p>People that do evil things,</p>
<p>I wonder what they are like in a room</p>
<p>because I know quite a lot of intelligent people</p>
<p>that did not see the evil in Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>and spend time with them.</p>
<p>And were not bothered by it.</p>
<p>In the same sense, Hitler,</p>
<p>it seems like he was able to get,</p>
<p>just even before he had power,</p>
<p>because people get intoxicated by power and so on.</p>
<p>They want to be close to power.</p>
<p>But even before he had power,</p>
<p>he was able to convince people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unclear,</p>
<p>like is there something that&rsquo;s more than words?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the way you,</p>
<p>I mean, people talk, tell stories about like this piercing</p>
<p>look and whatever, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s somehow a part of it.</p>
<p>Like that has to be the base floor</p>
<p>of any of these charismatic leaders.</p>
<p>You have to be able to, in a room alone,</p>
<p>be able to convince anybody of anything.</p>
<p>So I can tell you from my personal experience,</p>
<p>one of the best educated lessons I got</p>
<p>was when I got to meet Trump.</p>
<p>So I interviewed Trump four different times as a journalist,</p>
<p>spent like two and a half hours with him in the Oval Office,</p>
<p>not alone, but like me and one person</p>
<p>and like the press secretary, and that was it.</p>
<p>So I actually got to observe him.</p>
<p>And as a guy who reads these types of books,</p>
<p>and you think of Trump, obviously most people,</p>
<p>what they see on television, in articles and more,</p>
<p>but being able to observe it like one on one,</p>
<p>I was closer to him than I am right now from you.</p>
<p>That was one of the most educational experiences I got</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like you just said,</p>
<p>the look, the leaning forward,</p>
<p>the way he talks, the way he is a master</p>
<p>at taking the question</p>
<p>and answering exactly which party wants.</p>
<p>And then if you try and follow up,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, excuse me, you know, like he knows.</p>
<p>And then whenever you&rsquo;re talking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s annoyed about getting interrupted.</p>
<p>If he realizes he&rsquo;s been mirandering</p>
<p>and then you interrupt him, all good.</p>
<p>But if he&rsquo;s driving home a point,</p>
<p>which he has to make sure appears in your transcript</p>
<p>or whatever, it really was fascinating for me to look at.</p>
<p>And what was also crazy with Trump</p>
<p>is I realized how much he was living in the moment.</p>
<p>So when I went to the Oval,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read all these biographies and I walk in,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, holy shit, you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Were you interviewing him in the Oval Office?</p>
<p>In the Oval, every time, I was in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>You scared shitless?</p>
<p>Well, I wasn&rsquo;t scared.</p>
<p>I was just, look, it&rsquo;s the Oval Office, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m this nerd.</p>
<p>He was like this kid, I&rsquo;m so, I will admit this here.</p>
<p>I printed out on my dad&rsquo;s label maker when I was like seven</p>
<p>and I wrote the Oval Office on my bedroom.</p>
<p>So I was a huge nerd, obviously egomaniacal, even from seven.</p>
<p>But so for this, I mean, it was huge, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like this 25 year old kid.</p>
<p>And I walk in there and I see the couch, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh man, that&rsquo;s Kissinger.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Kissinger and Nixon got on their knees.</p>
<p>And then you see over by the door and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>are the scuff marks still there</p>
<p>from when Eisenhower used to play golf?</p>
<p>You know, this is all running through my mind.</p>
<p>With Trump, none of it was there, none of it, right?</p>
<p>So like, even the desk, I put my phone on the desk</p>
<p>to record and I&rsquo;m like, this is the fucking Resolute desk.</p>
<p>Like, I shouldn&rsquo;t put my phone on this thing, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like HMS Resolute, you know, all the international.</p>
<p>And even for him, he doesn&rsquo;t think about any of it.</p>
<p>It was like amazing to me.</p>
<p>Like he had this portrait of Andrew Jackson</p>
<p>right next to his, to the, I think from on the fireplace,</p>
<p>like right here on the right.</p>
<p>And the most revealing question was when I was like,</p>
<p>Mr. President, what are people gonna remember you for</p>
<p>in a hundred years?</p>
<p>And he was like, I don&rsquo;t know, like veteran&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>He like has a list in front of him of like</p>
<p>his accomplishments, which is staff.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, that&rsquo;s what I wanted to know.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, veteran&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>And I remember looking at him being like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be veteran&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m looking at you, Donald Trump,</p>
<p>the harbinger of something new.</p>
<p>We still don&rsquo;t know what the hell it is.</p>
<p>And so I realized with these guys and their charisma</p>
<p>and more is that they don&rsquo;t think about themselves</p>
<p>the way that we think about them.</p>
<p>And that was actually important to understand</p>
<p>because a lot of people are like,</p>
<p>Trump is playing all this chess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I assure you he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s truly, one time I was interviewing him</p>
<p>and he had like a certificate that he had to sign</p>
<p>or something on his desk.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, it was like child almost.</p>
<p>Like he got distracted by, he&rsquo;s like, oh, what&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s just like picking up and I was like,</p>
<p>wow, like this, this is the guy.</p>
<p>Like this is what he is.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder if there was a different person</p>
<p>because you were recording then offline at a party.</p>
<p>I can tell you.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the thing though,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s another part of it.</p>
<p>Because that two hours,</p>
<p>I would say like half of that was not on the record.</p>
<p>So like, whenever he&rsquo;s off the record,</p>
<p>he changes completely, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna like go into too much of it or whatever,</p>
<p>but like he, I mean, he is so mindful</p>
<p>of when that camera is on and when the mic is hot</p>
<p>in terms of the language that he uses,</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s willing to admit,</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s willing to talk about,</p>
<p>how he&rsquo;s willing to even appear in front of his staff.</p>
<p>I think the most revealing thing Trump ever did</p>
<p>was there was this press conference,</p>
<p>like right after he lost the,</p>
<p>right after the midterm elections in 2018.</p>
<p>And one of the journalists was like,</p>
<p>Mr. President, thank you for doing this press conference.</p>
<p>And he looks at him and he goes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called earned media, it&rsquo;s worth billions.</p>
<p>And he just like had so much disdain for him</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not doing this for you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m doing this for me.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s really aware of the narrative of the story.</p>
<p>I mean, that the people have talked about</p>
<p>that all comes from the tabloid media of the,</p>
<p>from New York and so on.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a master of that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve also heard stories of just in private,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a really, I don&rsquo;t wanna overuse the word charismatic,</p>
<p>but just like, he is a really interesting,</p>
<p>almost like friendly, like a good person.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s what I heard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard actually surprising the same thing</p>
<p>about Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>And like.</p>
<p>That I can&rsquo;t tell you anything about.</p>
<p>But like the way they present themselves</p>
<p>is perhaps very different than they are</p>
<p>as human beings and one on one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something, maybe that&rsquo;s just like a skill thing.</p>
<p>Maybe the way they present themselves in public</p>
<p>is actually their, I mean, almost their real self.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just really good in private,</p>
<p>one on one to go into this mode</p>
<p>of just being really intimate in some kind of human way.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>Because I noticed that with Trump, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s almost like a tour guide.</p>
<p>It was very like, it&rsquo;s very crazy, right?</p>
<p>Cause you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re in the Oval.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s his office.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, do you guys want anything?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, you want a Diet Coke?</p>
<p>Cause he drinks like all this Diet Coke.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just like, you guys want a Diet Coke, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re sitting there and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>the way he&rsquo;s able to like,</p>
<p>like the last time I interviewed him,</p>
<p>he wanted to do it outside.</p>
<p>Because he like, he&rsquo;s studied himself from all angles.</p>
<p>And he knows exactly how he looks on a camera</p>
<p>and with which lighting.</p>
<p>And so we were supposed to interview him on camera</p>
<p>in the Oval Office, which is actually rare.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t usually get that.</p>
<p>And they ended up moving it outside at the last minute.</p>
<p>And he came out and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I picked this spot for you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, great lighting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, you are your own like lighting director.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The president, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like you said, he&rsquo;s very charismatic</p>
<p>and friendly.</p>
<p>I mean, you wouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, look, this is what I mean</p>
<p>in terms of the dynamism of these people that gets lost.</p>
<p>And I think even he knows that.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think he would want that side of him.</p>
<p>That I see, you know, that you see in those</p>
<p>off the record moments and more in order to come out</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s very keen about</p>
<p>how exactly he presents to the public.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, even his presidential portrait,</p>
<p>everybody usually smiles and he refused to smile.</p>
<p>He was like, I want to look like Winston Churchill.</p>
<p>You know, like even he knew that.</p>
<p>Do you think he believes that he,</p>
<p>what he kind of implies that he is one of,</p>
<p>if not the greatest president in American history?</p>
<p>Like people kind of laugh at this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s quite, I mean, there&rsquo;s quite a lot of people,</p>
<p>first of all, that make the argument</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s the greatest president in history.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve heard this argument being made.</p>
<p>And I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what the,</p>
<p>first of all, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Like, you can&rsquo;t make an argument</p>
<p>that anyone is the greatest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just, that just, I come from a school</p>
<p>of like being humble and modest and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, even Michael, you can&rsquo;t have that conversation.</p>
<p>Okay, so I like that he&rsquo;s humble enough to say</p>
<p>like Abraham Lincoln or whatever.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He says maybe Lincoln.</p>
<p>Maybe. Remember that.</p>
<p>Maybe. He says maybe Lincoln.</p>
<p>Do you think he actually believes that?</p>
<p>Or is that something he understands will create news</p>
<p>and also perhaps more importantly,</p>
<p>piss off a large number of people?</p>
<p>Is he almost like a musician masterfully playing</p>
<p>the emotions of the public?</p>
<p>Or does he, or, and does he believe</p>
<p>when he looks in the mirror,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the greatest men in history?</p>
<p>Combination of all three.</p>
<p>I do think he believes it.</p>
<p>And for the reason why is I don&rsquo;t think he knows</p>
<p>that much about US history.</p>
<p>I really mean that.</p>
<p>Like, and that&rsquo;s what I meant whenever I was in there</p>
<p>and I realized he was just living in the moment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he knew all that much about why.</p>
<p>I mean, this is why he was elected in many ways, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying this is an orbit,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not making a judgment on this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, I do think in his mind,</p>
<p>he does think he was one of the best presidents</p>
<p>in American history largely because,</p>
<p>and I encountered this with a lot of people who work for him,</p>
<p>which is that they didn&rsquo;t really know all that much</p>
<p>kind of about what came before and all that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not necessarily to hold it against them</p>
<p>because for in many ways,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they were elected to do</p>
<p>or elected to be in many ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question whether knowing history,</p>
<p>being a student of history is productive</p>
<p>or counterproductive.</p>
<p>I tend to assume I really respect people</p>
<p>who are deeply like well read in history,</p>
<p>like presidents that are almost like history nerds.</p>
<p>I admire that.</p>
<p>But maybe that gets in the way of governance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;m just sort of playing devil&rsquo;s advocate</p>
<p>to my own beliefs,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s possible that focusing on the moment</p>
<p>and the issues and letting history,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like first principles thinking,</p>
<p>forget the lessons of the past</p>
<p>and just focus on common sense reasoning</p>
<p>through the problems of today.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really hard question.</p>
<p>In terms of the modern era,</p>
<p>I mean, Obama was a student of history.</p>
<p>Like he used to have presidential biographers</p>
<p>and people over and I mean, famously,</p>
<p>like Robert de Caro,</p>
<p>one of my favorite presidential biographers,</p>
<p>he was invited to have dinner with Obama</p>
<p>and Obama would like pepper some of his,</p>
<p>it was interesting because he&rsquo;d try and justify</p>
<p>some of the things he didn&rsquo;t do by being like,</p>
<p>well, if you look at what they had to do</p>
<p>and what I have to deal with,</p>
<p>mine&rsquo;s much harder.</p>
<p>So in that way, I was a little pissed off</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d be like, no, that actually like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re comparing apples to oranges and all that.</p>
<p>But if you look at Roosevelt,</p>
<p>Teddy Roosevelt in particular,</p>
<p>this was, I mean, a voracious reader,</p>
<p>not of just American history, all history.</p>
<p>That guy&rsquo;s just such a badass.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>The only president who willed himself to greatness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the amazing thing about him.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t tested by a crisis, right?</p>
<p>Like it wasn&rsquo;t, no, he didn&rsquo;t have a civil war.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have World War II.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have to found the country, literally,</p>
<p>or like, didn&rsquo;t have to stave off that,</p>
<p>or he didn&rsquo;t buy Louisiana Purchase, like all that.</p>
<p>He literally came into a pretty static country</p>
<p>and he could have just governed with,</p>
<p>I mean, he was, the person who came before him</p>
<p>was assassinated, like he easily could have coasted,</p>
<p>but he literally willed the country into something more.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always why I&rsquo;ve focused a lot on him too,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like, that, in many ways,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s easy to be great during crisis.</p>
<p>I mean, like look at Trump, right?</p>
<p>But it can bring out the best within you,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a whole other level</p>
<p>to bring out the best within yourself</p>
<p>just for the sake of doing it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think is really interesting.</p>
<p>The speeches were amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a sucker for great speeches</p>
<p>because I tend to see the role of the president</p>
<p>as in part like inspirer in chief,</p>
<p>sort of to be able to, I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what great leaders do,</p>
<p>like CEOs of companies and so on,</p>
<p>establish a vision, a clear vision,</p>
<p>and like hit that hard.</p>
<p>But the way you establish the vision isn&rsquo;t just like,</p>
<p>not to dig at Joe Biden,</p>
<p>but like sleepy, boring statements.</p>
<p>You have to sell those statements</p>
<p>and you have to do it in a way</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s paying attention.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s excited.</p>
<p>And that, Teddy Roosevelt was definitely one of them.</p>
<p>Obama was, I think, at least early on,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, was incredible at that.</p>
<p>It does feel that the modern political landscape</p>
<p>makes it more difficult to be inspirational in a sense</p>
<p>because everything becomes bickering and division.</p>
<p>I do want to ask you about Trump.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re now a successful podcaster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to Joe about Trump, Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>and Joe&rsquo;s not interested in talking to Trump.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just fascinating.</p>
<p>I try to dig into like why.</p>
<p>What would you interview Trump on like realignment,</p>
<p>for example, and do you think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to do a two, three hour conversation with him</p>
<p>where you will get at something like human</p>
<p>or you get at something, like when we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the facade he puts forward,</p>
<p>do you think you could get past that?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I look, I was a White House correspondent.</p>
<p>I observed this man very closely.</p>
<p>I interviewed him.</p>
<p>I think if that mic is hot, he knows what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>He just, he&rsquo;s done this too long, Lex.</p>
<p>He just knows.</p>
<p>But do you think he&rsquo;s a different human now</p>
<p>after the election?</p>
<p>Do you think that?</p>
<p>Yeah, not at all.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s been the same person since 1976.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>Like basically, 1976, I studied Trump a lot</p>
<p>and I think he&rsquo;s basically been the core</p>
<p>of who he is and elements of that.</p>
<p>Ever since he built that, you know,</p>
<p>the ice rink in Central Park and got that media attention,</p>
<p>that was it.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s a fascinating study.</p>
<p>Still, I feel there&rsquo;s a hope in me</p>
<p>that there would be a podcast like a Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>like a long form podcast where it&rsquo;s something could be,</p>
<p>you know, and you&rsquo;re actually a really good person</p>
<p>to do that, where you can have a real conversation</p>
<p>that looks back at the election and reveal something on us.</p>
<p>But perhaps he&rsquo;s thinking about running again</p>
<p>and so maybe he&rsquo;ll never let down that guard.</p>
<p>But like, you know, I just love it when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this switch in people where you start looking back</p>
<p>at your life and wanting to tell stories.</p>
<p>Like, you know, trying to extract wisdom</p>
<p>and like realizing you&rsquo;re in this new phase of life</p>
<p>where like the battles have all been fought,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re this old, like former warrior</p>
<p>and now you can tell the stories of that time.</p>
<p>And it seems like Trump is still at it,</p>
<p>like the young warrior he is,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not in the mode of telling stories.</p>
<p>You know what I got from Rogan?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the only president who didn&rsquo;t age well in office.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true, right?</p>
<p>Like, and this is what I mean,</p>
<p>because he lives in the moment, like the job actually</p>
<p>aged Obama, I mean, Bush, same thing, even Clinton.</p>
<p>Clinton was like fat, it looked miserable by like 2000.</p>
<p>HW, like, I mean, Reagan, famous, actually, yeah,</p>
<p>pretty much everybody I think about,</p>
<p>including John F. Kennedy,</p>
<p>who got much sicker while in office.</p>
<p>The job like weighs on you and makes you physically ill.</p>
<p>Trump was, he&rsquo;s the only person who just didn&rsquo;t happen to.</p>
<p>He almost gotten stronger and he was one of the most,</p>
<p>like the climate, there&rsquo;s so many people attacking him,</p>
<p>so much hatred, so much love and hatred.</p>
<p>And it was just, I mean, it was whatever it was,</p>
<p>it was quite masterful and a fascinating study.</p>
<p>If we stick on Hitler for just a minute,</p>
<p>what lessons do you take from that time?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s a unique moment in human history,</p>
<p>that World War II, I mean, both Stalin and Hitler,</p>
<p>you know, is it something that&rsquo;s just an outlier</p>
<p>in all of human history in terms of the atrocities,</p>
<p>or is there lessons to be learned?</p>
<p>You mentioned offline that you&rsquo;re not just a student</p>
<p>of the entirety of the history, but you also are fascinated</p>
<p>by just different like policies and stuff.</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the immigration policy?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the policy on science?</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Third Reich in power, let me plug it,</p>
<p>by Richard Evans, I think is what it was.</p>
<p>Cause that actually will tell you,</p>
<p>like what was it like to live under the Nazi regime</p>
<p>without the war?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a hard question in terms of the lessons</p>
<p>that we can learn.</p>
<p>Cause there&rsquo;s a lot, and it&rsquo;s actually been over,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been over indexed almost.</p>
<p>Everything comes back to Hitler in a conversation.</p>
<p>So I kind of think of it within Mao, Stalin, and Hitler</p>
<p>as, I don&rsquo;t wanna say payments for,</p>
<p>but like the end point payment for the sins</p>
<p>and the problems of the monarchical system</p>
<p>that evolve within Europe.</p>
<p>Basically like 1400 and more.</p>
<p>I basically think that 1400,</p>
<p>the wars between France, England, the balance of power,</p>
<p>eventually World War I, and then serfdom within Russia,</p>
<p>the Russian revolution that birthed Stalin.</p>
<p>Same thing, the Kaiser and Imperial Germany</p>
<p>and this like incredibly crazy system of balance of power</p>
<p>in World War I.</p>
<p>And then same thing within China</p>
<p>in terms of the warring states and then the disintegration,</p>
<p>the European, you know, this is how they think of it.</p>
<p>Which is like the century of humiliation</p>
<p>and they had to have something like this.</p>
<p>I think of it, I try to think of it</p>
<p>within the context of that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna sound like an inevitablist,</p>
<p>but I think of it as, I like to think about systems,</p>
<p>especially here in DC, that&rsquo;s where I got into politics,</p>
<p>which is that you have to understand systems of power</p>
<p>and the incentives within systems and the disincentives,</p>
<p>the downside risk of what you&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>because that is what leads and creates the behavior</p>
<p>within that system.</p>
<p>I was just talking to my girlfriend about this yesterday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny, like I read these,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obsessed with these books by Robert Caro,</p>
<p>the biographies of Lyndon Johnson.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s written like 5,000 pages so far</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still not done.</p>
<p>Okay, so like these are like books I base my life on.</p>
<p>And look, these are Washington</p>
<p>and the story of the post New Deal era and forward.</p>
<p>Not much has changed.</p>
<p>Like the Senate is still the Senate.</p>
<p>So many of the same problems with the Senate</p>
<p>are still there in some cases.</p>
<p>No, not anymore.</p>
<p>But for a while, some of the people who were there</p>
<p>with Johnson are actually still,</p>
<p>one of them is the president of the United States,</p>
<p>just a joke.</p>
<p>And you think about also,</p>
<p>same with the media relationship, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s this media really,</p>
<p>they may have come and gone.</p>
<p>Like the people who were in the media</p>
<p>and who were cozy with the administration officials,</p>
<p>I mean, they just recreated themselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an ecosystem which doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s not that was a specific time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just DC.</p>
<p>Like that is DC because of the way</p>
<p>the system is architected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much been that way since like 1908,</p>
<p>whenever like Teddy Roosevelt was dining</p>
<p>with these journalists and he would yell at them.</p>
<p>And then he would go over to the society house.</p>
<p>And like in many ways,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now instead of going to Henry Adams&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>like the people are congregating in Calorama,</p>
<p>which is the richest neighborhood here</p>
<p>at somebody else&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>So you have to think about the system</p>
<p>and then the incentives within that system</p>
<p>about what the outcomes that they&rsquo;re producing.</p>
<p>If you actually wanna think about</p>
<p>how can I change this from the outside?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also why it&rsquo;s very difficult to change</p>
<p>because the system is designed</p>
<p>in order to produce actually pretty specific outcomes</p>
<p>that can only be changed in extraordinary times.</p>
<p>Yeah, and sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to predict</p>
<p>what kind of outcomes will result from the incentive,</p>
<p>the system that you create, right?</p>
<p>In the case, because especially</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s novel kind of situations.</p>
<p>With Trump, he actually created a pretty novel situation.</p>
<p>And a lot of the things that we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>in the 20th century were very novel systems</p>
<p>where people were very optimistic about the outcomes, right?</p>
<p>And then it turned out to not have the results</p>
<p>that they predicted.</p>
<p>In terms of things being unchanged</p>
<p>for the past 100 years and so on,</p>
<p>can you like Wikipedia style</p>
<p>or maybe like in a musical form,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m only a bill, describe to me.</p>
<p>I still sing that to my head sometimes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a bill.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the rest of the song is,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s leave that to people&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
<p>How does this whole thing work?</p>
<p>How does the US political system work?</p>
<p>The three branches is how do you think</p>
<p>about the system we have now?</p>
<p>If you were to try to describe,</p>
<p>if aliens showed up and asked you like,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have time, so this is an elevator thing.</p>
<p>Should we destroy you as you plead to avoid destruction?</p>
<p>Well, how would you describe how this thing works?</p>
<p>I would say we come together and we pick the people</p>
<p>who make our laws.</p>
<p>Then we pick the guy who executes those laws</p>
<p>and they together pick the people who determine</p>
<p>whether they or the president is breaking the law</p>
<p>at the most basic level.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I would describe it.</p>
<p>So the people who make the laws are Congress.</p>
<p>The executive is charged with executing the laws</p>
<p>as passed by Congress, the system,</p>
<p>the branches of government,</p>
<p>and the Supreme Court is picked by the president,</p>
<p>confirmed by the Senate,</p>
<p>which then decides whether you or other people</p>
<p>are breaking the law in terms of interpretation of that law.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically it.</p>
<p>Oh, and they decide whether those laws are in,</p>
<p>they fall within the restrictions</p>
<p>and the want of the founders as expressed</p>
<p>by the Constitution of the United States,</p>
<p>which is a set of principles that we came together in 1787.</p>
<p>I want to make sure I get this right, 1787,</p>
<p>and decided that we were going to live the rest of our lives</p>
<p>barring a revolution and more.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve made it 200 and something years</p>
<p>in order on under that system.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a balance of power</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s multiple branches.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tension and a balance to it</p>
<p>as designed by those original documents.</p>
<p>What, which is the most dysfunctional,</p>
<p>the branches, which is your favorite?</p>
<p>Like in terms of talking about systems</p>
<p>and like what&rsquo;s the greatest of concern</p>
<p>and what is the greatest source of benefit in your view?</p>
<p>The presidency, obviously,</p>
<p>well, the presidency is my favorite to study, obviously,</p>
<p>because it is the one</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s the most subjective variable change</p>
<p>in terms of the personality involved</p>
<p>because of so much power imbued within the executive.</p>
<p>The Senate is actually pretty much the same.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things I love</p>
<p>about reading about the Senate and histories of the Senate</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re like, oh yeah,</p>
<p>there were always like assholes in the Senate</p>
<p>who were doing their thing</p>
<p>and filibustering constantly based upon this or that.</p>
<p>And then the personalities involved with the Senate</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t mattered as much since like pre civil war, right?</p>
<p>Like pre civil war, you had like Henry Clay</p>
<p>and then Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun,</p>
<p>who even in their own way,</p>
<p>they represented like larger constituencies</p>
<p>and they crafted these like compromises</p>
<p>up until the outbreak of the civil war, et cetera.</p>
<p>But like post since then,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think about like the Titans within the Senate.</p>
<p>Most of that is because a lot of the stuff</p>
<p>that they had power over</p>
<p>has transferred over to the executive.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m most interested in really in like power,</p>
<p>like where it lies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually pretty, you know,</p>
<p>throughout American history,</p>
<p>much more used to lie with Congress.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s obviously just so imbued within the executive</p>
<p>that understanding executive power</p>
<p>is I think the thing I&rsquo;m probably most interested in here.</p>
<p>Do you think at this point,</p>
<p>the amount of power that the president has is corrupting</p>
<p>to their ability to lead well?</p>
<p>Is this, you know, power corrupts,</p>
<p>absolute power corrupts, absolutely.</p>
<p>Are we, is there too much power in the presidency?</p>
<p>There definitely is.</p>
<p>And part of the problem,</p>
<p>one of the things I try to make come across to people is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the president,</p>
<p>unless you have a hyper intentional view</p>
<p>of how something must be different in government,</p>
<p>your view doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So for example, like if you were Trump,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take Trump even,</p>
<p>and even in with a pretty intentional view,</p>
<p>he was like, I&rsquo;m gonna end the war in Afghanistan</p>
<p>and Iraq, right?</p>
<p>And he came in and he gets these generals in.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I wanna end the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>Oh, and I wanna withdraw these troops from Syria.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, okay, we&rsquo;ll give you,</p>
<p>give us like six months.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>And this is the thing about Trump.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t realize that it&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re like, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, six months seems fun, right?</p>
<p>So then six months comes and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, so, and then he&rsquo;ll announce it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll be like, and we&rsquo;re getting out of Syria.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And then the generals freak out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a plan for that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, but you guys told me six months.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know, now we need another six months</p>
<p>in order to figure this thing out.</p>
<p>And by that time, now you&rsquo;re midterms.</p>
<p>So now what?</p>
<p>Now you gotta run for reelection.</p>
<p>So more what I mean by that is,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have a hyperintentional view</p>
<p>about how to change foreign policy,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have a hyperintentional view</p>
<p>about how the Department of Commerce should do its job,</p>
<p>they are just gonna go on autopilot.</p>
<p>So this is part of the problem.</p>
<p>When you asked me about the presidency,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the presidency itself,</p>
<p>like the president himself, which has become too powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that we have less democratic checks</p>
<p>on the people and the systems that are on autopilot.</p>
<p>And I would say that basically since 2008,</p>
<p>we have voted every single time to disrupt that system,</p>
<p>except in the case of 2020 with Joe Biden,</p>
<p>and there are a lot of different reasons</p>
<p>around why that happened.</p>
<p>And in every single one of those cases,</p>
<p>Obama and Trump, they all failed</p>
<p>in order to radically disrupt that.</p>
<p>And that just shows you how titanic the task is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m using my language precisely</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t wanna be like deep state,</p>
<p>but obviously there&rsquo;s deep state.</p>
<p>Deep state, I guess, has conspiratorial intentions to it.</p>
<p>But so what you&rsquo;re saying is the true power</p>
<p>currently lies with the autopilot, AKA deep state.</p>
<p>Well, but see, this is the thing too I wanna make clear,</p>
<p>because I think people think conspiratorially</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re all coming together</p>
<p>to intentionally do something.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>They are doing what they know, believe they are right,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have real democratic checks within that.</p>
<p>And so now they have entire generations of cultures</p>
<p>within each of these bureaucracies where they say,</p>
<p>this is the way that we do things around here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem, which is that we have a culture</p>
<p>of within many of these agencies and more.</p>
<p>I think the best example for this</p>
<p>would be during the Ukraine gate with Trump and all that,</p>
<p>with the impeachment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about the politics here,</p>
<p>but the most revealing thing that happened</p>
<p>was when the whistleblower guy, Alexander Vindman,</p>
<p>was like, here you have the president</p>
<p>departing from the policy of the United States.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, let me educate you, Lieutenant Colonel.</p>
<p>The president of the United States</p>
<p>makes American foreign policy.</p>
<p>But it was a very revealing comment</p>
<p>because he and all the people</p>
<p>within national security bureaucracy do think that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, this is the policy of the United States.</p>
<p>We have to do this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where things get screwy.</p>
<p>Well, listen, for me personally,</p>
<p>but also from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>I just talked to Jim Keller.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, this is the kind of bullshit that we all hate</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to innovate and design new products.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what first principles thinking requires.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we don&rsquo;t give a shit what was done before.</p>
<p>The point is, what is the best way to do it?</p>
<p>And it seems like the current government,</p>
<p>government in general, probably,</p>
<p>bureaucracies in general,</p>
<p>are just really good at being lazy</p>
<p>without never having those conversations.</p>
<p>And just, it becomes this momentum thing</p>
<p>that nobody has the difficult conversations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become a game within a certain set of constraints</p>
<p>and they never kind of do revolutionary tasks.</p>
<p>But you did say that the presidency is power,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying that more power than the others,</p>
<p>but that power has to be coupled</p>
<p>with focused intentionality.</p>
<p>You have to keep hammering the thing.</p>
<p>If you want it done, it has to be done.</p>
<p>I mean, and you gotta, this is the other part too,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s not just that you have to get it done.</p>
<p>You have to pick the 100 people who you can trust</p>
<p>to pick 10 people each to actually do what you want.</p>
<p>One of the most revealing quotes</p>
<p>is from a guy named Tommy Corcoran.</p>
<p>He was the top aide to FDR.</p>
<p>This I&rsquo;m getting from the Kara books too.</p>
<p>And he said, what is a government?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just one guy or even 10 guys.</p>
<p>Hell, it&rsquo;s a thousand guys.</p>
<p>And what FDR did is he masterfully picked the right people</p>
<p>to execute his will through the federal agencies.</p>
<p>Johnson was the same way.</p>
<p>He played these people like a fiddle.</p>
<p>He knew exactly who to pick.</p>
<p>He knew the system and more.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that outsiders</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience in Washington</p>
<p>almost always fail is they don&rsquo;t know who to pick</p>
<p>or they pick people who say one thing to their face.</p>
<p>And then when it comes time</p>
<p>to carry out the president&rsquo;s policy</p>
<p>in terms of the government, they just don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And the president&rsquo;s too, think about this.</p>
<p>I think some Rahm Emanuel said this.</p>
<p>He was like, by the time it gets to the president&rsquo;s desk,</p>
<p>nobody else can solve it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a yes or no question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s every single thing that hits the president&rsquo;s desk</p>
<p>is incredibly hard to do.</p>
<p>And Obama actually even said,</p>
<p>and this was a very revealing quote</p>
<p>about how he thinks about the presidency,</p>
<p>which is he&rsquo;s like, look, the presidency</p>
<p>is like one of those super tankers.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I can come in and I can take it two degrees left</p>
<p>and two degrees right.</p>
<p>In a hundred years, two degrees left,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole different trajectory.</p>
<p>Same thing on the right.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, that ultimately is really all you can do.</p>
<p>I quibble and disagree with that</p>
<p>in terms of how he could have changed things in 2008,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of truth to that statement.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>You make me realize that actually both Obama and Trump</p>
<p>are probably playing victim here to the system.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making me think that maybe you can correct me</p>
<p>that, cause I&rsquo;m thinking of like Elon Musk,</p>
<p>whose major success despite everything</p>
<p>is hiring the right people.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And like creating those thousands,</p>
<p>that structure of a thousand people.</p>
<p>So maybe a president has power in that</p>
<p>if they were exceptionally good</p>
<p>at hiring the right people.</p>
<p>Personnel is policy, man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it comes down to.</p>
<p>But wouldn&rsquo;t you be able to steer the ship</p>
<p>way more than two degrees if you hire the right people?</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s almost like Obama was not good</p>
<p>at hiring the right people.</p>
<p>Well, he hired all the Clinton people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>What happened with Trump?</p>
<p>He hired all the Bush people.</p>
<p>And then you just sit back and say,</p>
<p>oh, president can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but that means you&rsquo;re just suck at hiring.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, I know it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving you simultaneously</p>
<p>the nationalist case against Trump</p>
<p>and the progressive case against Obama.</p>
<p>The progressive people are like,</p>
<p>why the fuck are you hiring all these Clinton people</p>
<p>in order to run the government and just recreate,</p>
<p>like why are you hiring Larry Summers,</p>
<p>who was one of the people who worked at all these banks</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t believe that bailouts were gonna be big enough,</p>
<p>and then to come in in the worst economic crisis</p>
<p>in modern American history.</p>
<p>That was 2008.</p>
<p>And Summers actively lobbied against larger bailouts,</p>
<p>which had huge implications for working class people</p>
<p>and pretty much hollowed out America since.</p>
<p>Okay, from Trump, same thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m gonna drain the swamp.</p>
<p>And by doing that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna hire Goldman Sachs&rsquo;s Gary Cohn</p>
<p>and Steve Mnuchin and all these other absolute bush clowns</p>
<p>in order to run my White House.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, no shit.</p>
<p>The only thing that you accomplished</p>
<p>in your four years in office</p>
<p>is passing a massive tax cut for the rich</p>
<p>and for corporations.</p>
<p>I wonder how that happened.</p>
<p>What role does money play in all of this?</p>
<p>Is money a huge influence in politics,</p>
<p>super PACs, all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Or is this more just kind of a narrative that we play with</p>
<p>because from the outsider&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>it seems to have,</p>
<p>that seems to be one of the fundamental problems</p>
<p>with modern politics.</p>
<p>So I was just having this conversation,</p>
<p>Marshall and I,</p>
<p>Marshall Kosloff, my cohost on The Realignment.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny because if you do enough research,</p>
<p>we actually live in the least corrupt age</p>
<p>in American campaign finance,</p>
<p>as in it&rsquo;s never been more transparent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never been more up to the FEC and all of that.</p>
<p>If you go back and read not even 50 years ago,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about Lyndon B. Johnson,</p>
<p>handing people like literally as he came up in his youth,</p>
<p>paying people for votes,</p>
<p>like the boss of the person who like had</p>
<p>all the Mexican votes,</p>
<p>like the person who had,</p>
<p>and he was like giving out briefcases.</p>
<p>This is like within people&rsquo;s lifetimes</p>
<p>who are alive in America.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t happen anymore.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t like to blame everything on money.</p>
<p>Although I do think money is obviously</p>
<p>a huge part of the problem.</p>
<p>I actually look at it in terms of distribution,</p>
<p>which is that how is money distributed within our society?</p>
<p>Because I firmly believe that politics,</p>
<p>this is gonna get complicated,</p>
<p>but I think politics is mostly downstream from culture.</p>
<p>And culture, obviously I&rsquo;m using economics</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s obviously a huge interplay there,</p>
<p>but like in terms of the equitable</p>
<p>or lack of equitable distribution of money</p>
<p>within our politics,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re really pissed off about is we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>our politics only seems to work</p>
<p>for the people who have money.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s largely true.</p>
<p>I think that the reason why things worked differently</p>
<p>in the past is because our economy was structured</p>
<p>in different ways.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason that our politics today</p>
<p>are very analogous to the last Gilded Age</p>
<p>because we had very similar levels</p>
<p>of economic distribution and cultural problems too</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna erase that.</p>
<p>Cause I actually think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s driving</p>
<p>all of our politics right now.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So in that sense,</p>
<p>the representative government is doing a pretty good job</p>
<p>of representing the state of culture</p>
<p>and the people and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can I ask you in terms of the deep state</p>
<p>and conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of talk about,</p>
<p>again, from an outsider&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>if I were just looking at Twitter,</p>
<p>it seems that at least 90% of people</p>
<p>in government are pedophiles.</p>
<p>90 to 95%, I&rsquo;m not sure what that number is.</p>
<p>If I were to just look at Twitter, honestly, or YouTube,</p>
<p>I would think most of the world is a pedophile.</p>
<p>I would almost feel like.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t fully believe that, you&rsquo;re a pedophile.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I would start to wonder like, wait,</p>
<p>like what, am I a pedophile too?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m either a communist or a pedophile or both, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s gonna be clipped out.</p>
<p>Thank you, internet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I look forward to your emails.</p>
<p>But is there any kind of shadow conspiracy theories</p>
<p>that give you pause or,</p>
<p>so the flip side,</p>
<p>the response to a lot of conspiracy theories is like,</p>
<p>no, the reason this happened</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s a combination of just incompetence.</p>
<p>So where do you land on some of these conspiracy theories?</p>
<p>I think most conspiracy theories are wrong.</p>
<p>Some are true and those are spectacularly true.</p>
<p>And if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know which ones.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which ones.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>I think, well, I mean, look, man, I listened to your podcast.</p>
<p>I think I was a huge nonbeliever in UFOs</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;ve probably never believed more in UFOs.</p>
<p>Like I believe in UFOs.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m very comfortable being like,</p>
<p>not only do I believe in UFOs,</p>
<p>like I think we&rsquo;re probably being visited</p>
<p>by an alien civilization.</p>
<p>And if you asked me that three years ago,</p>
<p>I would have been like, you&rsquo;re out of your fucking mind.</p>
<p>Like, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>Well, listen to David Fravor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I have to say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I have the sense that the government has information</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t revealed,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re holding,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a green guy sitting there in a room.</p>
<p>They have seen things they don&rsquo;t know what to do with.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;re confused.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re afraid of revealing that they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I think it is, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s revealing, yeah, exactly, that they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And then in the process,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of fears tied up in that.</p>
<p>First, looking incompetent in the public eye.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to be looked that way.</p>
<p>And the other is like, in revealing it,</p>
<p>even though they don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe China will figure it out.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So like, we don&rsquo;t want China to figure it out first.</p>
<p>And so all those kinds of things</p>
<p>result in basically secrecy.</p>
<p>Then that damages the trust in institutions</p>
<p>on one of the most fascinating aspects,</p>
<p>like one of the most fascinating mysteries of humankind</p>
<p>of is there life, intelligent life,</p>
<p>out there in the universe?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s other ones, like for me,</p>
<p>when I first came across actually Alex Jones was 9 11.</p>
<p>I remember like, cause I was in Chicago.</p>
<p>I was thinking like, oh shit,</p>
<p>are they gonna hit Chicago too?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what everybody was thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah, everybody.</p>
<p>Everybody was thinking like, what does this mean?</p>
<p>What scale?</p>
<p>What, I mean, trying to interpret it.</p>
<p>And I remember like looking for information desperately,</p>
<p>like what happened?</p>
<p>And I remember not being satisfied</p>
<p>with the quality of reporting</p>
<p>and figuring out like rigorous,</p>
<p>like here&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>And so people like Alex Jones stepped up</p>
<p>and others that said like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some shady shit going on.</p>
<p>And it sure as hell looked like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s shady shit going on.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So like, and I still stand behind the fact</p>
<p>that it seems like there&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough, like it wasn&rsquo;t a good job</p>
<p>of being honest and transparent</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Cause it would implicate the Saudis.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>And see, that&rsquo;s my conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, I think they covered up a lot of stuff</p>
<p>because they wanted to cover up</p>
<p>for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, that was a conspiracy theory</p>
<p>not that long ago.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a hundred percent true.</p>
<p>Yeah, so those kinds of conspiracy theories are interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s other ones for me personally</p>
<p>that touched the institution that means a lot to me</p>
<p>is the MIT and, you know, Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wanna hear a lot more.</p>
<p>I wanna hear about, I talk about Epstein a lot.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like. Oh, you do?</p>
<p>Yeah, and he, I was gonna say,</p>
<p>in terms of conspiracy theory,</p>
<p>that one changed my outlook.</p>
<p>Cause I was like, I was like, whoa,</p>
<p>like you have this dude who convinced</p>
<p>some of the most successful people on earth</p>
<p>that he was like some money manager.</p>
<p>And it looks like it was totally fake.</p>
<p>Like Leon Black.</p>
<p>I mean, this is one of the richest men on wall street,</p>
<p>$9 billion net worth.</p>
<p>Why is he giving him over a hundred million dollars</p>
<p>between 2015 and 2019?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>Lex Wexner, same thing.</p>
<p>So yeah, I wanna hear,</p>
<p>because you know people who met him.</p>
<p>And the only person I know who met him was Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard his, right.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>So I, listen, I&rsquo;m still in and Eric is fascinating</p>
<p>and like Eric is full on saying that.</p>
<p>He was a Mossad or whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a front for something,</p>
<p>something much, much bigger.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a, whatever his name, Robert Maxwell,</p>
<p>all the, all those stories,</p>
<p>like you could dig deeper and deeper</p>
<p>that Jeffrey&rsquo;s just like the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>I just think he&rsquo;s an exceptionally charismatic,</p>
<p>listen, this isn&rsquo;t speaking from confidence</p>
<p>or like deep understanding of the situation,</p>
<p>but from my speaking with people,</p>
<p>he just seems like, at least from the side of his influence</p>
<p>and interaction with researchers,</p>
<p>he just seems like somebody</p>
<p>that was exceptionally charismatic</p>
<p>and actually took interest.</p>
<p>He was unable to speak about interesting scientific things,</p>
<p>but he took interest in them.</p>
<p>So he knew how to stroke the egos</p>
<p>of a lot of powerful people, like well,</p>
<p>like in different kinds of ways,</p>
<p>I suppose I don&rsquo;t know about this</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have, like if a really,</p>
<p>okay, this is weird to say,</p>
<p>but I have an ability,</p>
<p>okay, I think women are beautiful, I like women,</p>
<p>but like if like a supermodel came to me or something,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m able to reason.</p>
<p>It seems like some people are not able to think clearly</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s like an attractive woman in the room.</p>
<p>And I think that was one of the tools he used</p>
<p>to manipulate people.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, listen, it&rsquo;s like the pedophile thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many people are complete sex addicts,</p>
<p>but like, it seems like looking out into the world,</p>
<p>like the Me Too movement have revealed</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of like weird,</p>
<p>like creepy people out there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I think it was just one of the many tools</p>
<p>that he used to convince people and manipulate people,</p>
<p>but not in some like evil way,</p>
<p>but more just really good at the art of conversation</p>
<p>and just winning people over on the side.</p>
<p>And then by building through that process,</p>
<p>building a network of other really powerful people</p>
<p>and not explicitly, but implicitly having done shady shit</p>
<p>with powerful people, like building up</p>
<p>a kind of implied power of like,</p>
<p>like we did some shady shit together.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not like, you&rsquo;re gonna help me out</p>
<p>on this extra thing I need to do now.</p>
<p>And that builds and builds and builds</p>
<p>to where you&rsquo;re able to actually control,</p>
<p>like have quite a lot of power without explicitly having</p>
<p>like a strategy meeting.</p>
<p>And I think a single person or yeah,</p>
<p>I think a single person can do that,</p>
<p>can start that ball rolling.</p>
<p>And over time it becomes a group thing,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t know if Jillian Maxwell was involved</p>
<p>or others and yeah, over time that becomes almost</p>
<p>like a really powerful organization</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s not a front for something much deeper</p>
<p>and bigger, but it&rsquo;s almost like maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause I love cellular automata, man.</p>
<p>A system that starts out as a simple thing</p>
<p>with simple rules can create incredible complexity.</p>
<p>And so I just think that we&rsquo;re now looking in retrospect,</p>
<p>it looks like an incredibly complex system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s operating, but like, that&rsquo;s just because it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there could be a lot of other Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in my perspective that the simple thing just was successful</p>
<p>early on and builds and builds and builds and builds</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a creepy shit that like a lot of aspects</p>
<p>of the system helped it get bigger and bigger</p>
<p>and more powerful and so on.</p>
<p>So the final result is, I mean, listen,</p>
<p>I have a pretty optimistic, I tend to see the good</p>
<p>in people and so it&rsquo;s been heartbreaking to me in general</p>
<p>just to see people I look up to not have the level</p>
<p>of integrity I thought they would</p>
<p>or like the strength of character, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And it seems like you should be able to see the bullshit</p>
<p>that is Jeffrey Epstein, like when you meet him.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about like Eric Weinstein,</p>
<p>like one or two or three or five interactions,</p>
<p>but like there&rsquo;s people that had like years</p>
<p>of relationship with him.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Even after he was convicted.</p>
<p>After he was convicted.</p>
<p>That guy always gets me.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s stories, I mean, I don&rsquo;t need to sort of,</p>
<p>I honestly believe, okay, here&rsquo;s the open question I have.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many creepy sexual people</p>
<p>that are out there.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know if there is like,</p>
<p>like the people I know, the faculty and so on,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they have like a kink</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m just not aware of that was being leveraged</p>
<p>because to me, it seems like if not everybody&rsquo;s a pedophile,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s just the art of conversation.</p>
<p>That is just like the art of just like manipulating people</p>
<p>by making them feel good</p>
<p>about like the exciting stuff they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Listen, man, academics, people talk about money.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think academics care about money</p>
<p>as much as people think.</p>
<p>What they care about is like somebody,</p>
<p>they want to be, it&rsquo;s the same thing</p>
<p>that Instagram models posting their butt pictures,</p>
<p>is they want to be loved.</p>
<p>They want attention.</p>
<p>My parents are professors.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They, and Jeff Epstein,</p>
<p>like the money is another way to show attention.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s a proxy.</p>
<p>My work matters.</p>
<p>And he did that for some of the weirdest,</p>
<p>most brilliant people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sort of drop names, but everybody knows them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like people that are the most interesting academics</p>
<p>is the one he cared about.</p>
<p>Like people are thinking about the most difficult questions</p>
<p>in all of science and all of engineering.</p>
<p>So those people are, were kind of outcasts in academia</p>
<p>a little bit because they&rsquo;re doing the weird shit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the weirdos.</p>
<p>And he cared about the weirdos and he gave them money.</p>
<p>And that, you know, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s something more nefarious than that.</p>
<p>I hope not, but maybe I&rsquo;m surprised.</p>
<p>And in fact, half the population of the world is pedophiles.</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s what you were talking about,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the implication after the initial, right?</p>
<p>Like you do some shady things together</p>
<p>or you do something that you want out of the public eye</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a public person.</p>
<p>And look, we probably even experienced this</p>
<p>to a limited extent, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, ah, you know, like, I don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I almost lost my temper, you know,</p>
<p>one time whenever a car hit me and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t freak out in public anymore.</p>
<p>Like, you know, like what if somebody takes a photo</p>
<p>or something?</p>
<p>And so I think that there&rsquo;s an extent to that</p>
<p>times a billion, literally,</p>
<p>when you have a billion dollars or more.</p>
<p>And you take that all together</p>
<p>and you stack it up on itself.</p>
<p>I saw a story about like Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Like Bill Clinton was with Epstein or with Ghislaine Maxwell</p>
<p>in a private air terminal or something.</p>
<p>And she had one of their like sex, you know,</p>
<p>one of those girls who was underage,</p>
<p>had her dressed up in a literal like pilot uniform.</p>
<p>And she was underage in order to, you know,</p>
<p>and she was being disguised for being older.</p>
<p>And she was a masseuse, right?</p>
<p>Because that was one of the guises which they got</p>
<p>in order to sexually traffic these women.</p>
<p>And she was like, Bill was like complaining about his neck.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, give Bill Clinton a massage, right?</p>
<p>So now there&rsquo;s a photo of an underage girl</p>
<p>giving a massage to the former president</p>
<p>of the United States.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he knew, right?</p>
<p>But like, that looks bad.</p>
<p>And so this is kind of what we&rsquo;re getting at,</p>
<p>which is that you&rsquo;re setting it all up</p>
<p>and creating those preconditions or like Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>Do I think Prince Andrew knew</p>
<p>that Virginia Gouffre was underage?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Probably knew she was pretty young,</p>
<p>which I think is, you know, skeevy enough</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re a fucking Prince, you probably know better.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think he knew she was underage</p>
<p>or maybe he did.</p>
<p>And if he did, then he&rsquo;s even more of a piece of shit</p>
<p>than I thought.</p>
<p>But when we look at these things,</p>
<p>the stuff I&rsquo;m more interested in is like</p>
<p>what you were talking about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, Bill Gates, how do you get the richest man</p>
<p>in the world in your house?</p>
<p>Like under what, and Gates is like,</p>
<p>he was talking about financing and all this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you don&rsquo;t have access to money or bankers?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re the richest man in the world.</p>
<p>You can call Goldman Sachs anytime you want on a hotline.</p>
<p>Like, why do you need, that&rsquo;s where I start again</p>
<p>to get more conspiratorial because I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>Bill, dude, you have the gold credit, right?</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t need Epstein to create</p>
<p>some complicated financing structure.</p>
<p>Or Leon Black, like what is 2015, 2009?</p>
<p>I mean, this is very recent stuff.</p>
<p>Or, and this is the part that really got me</p>
<p>as I read the department,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called the Department of Financial Service</p>
<p>report around Deutsche Bank with Epstein.</p>
<p>They knew he was a criminal.</p>
<p>They solicited his business,</p>
<p>explicitly knew that his business meant access</p>
<p>to other high net worth individuals,</p>
<p>consistently doled money out from his account</p>
<p>for hush payments to women in Europe and prostitution rings.</p>
<p>They knew all of this within the bank.</p>
<p>It was elevated multiple times.</p>
<p>Here was the other one.</p>
<p>One of Epstein&rsquo;s associates was like,</p>
<p>hey, how much money can we take out</p>
<p>before we hit the automatic sensor</p>
<p>before you have to tell the IRS?</p>
<p>And that question by their own standards</p>
<p>is supposed to result in a notification to the feds</p>
<p>and they never did it.</p>
<p>And he was withdrawing like $2 million of cash</p>
<p>in five years for tips to, I&rsquo;m like, okay,</p>
<p>like something&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>Like, you see what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of signs that make you think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a bigger thing at play than just the man,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some, it does look like a larger organization</p>
<p>is using this front, right?</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I truly don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not willing to use the certainty,</p>
<p>which I think a lot of people online are,</p>
<p>to say like, it wants 100%.</p>
<p>The certainty is always the problem</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s probably why I hesitate</p>
<p>to touch conspiracy theories</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;m allergic to certainty in all forms.</p>
<p>In politics, any kind of discourse.</p>
<p>And people are so sure, in both directions, actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of hilarious.</p>
<p>Either they&rsquo;re sure that the conspiracy theory,</p>
<p>particularly whatever the conspiracy theory is, is false.</p>
<p>Like they almost dismiss it like,</p>
<p>like they don&rsquo;t even want to talk about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the people,</p>
<p>like the way they dismiss that the earth is flat.</p>
<p>Most scientists are like,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even want to like hear</p>
<p>what the flat earthers are saying.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have like zero patience for it,</p>
<p>which is like, maybe in that case is deserved.</p>
<p>But everything else, you really like have empathy.</p>
<p>Like consider the fact, you have,</p>
<p>okay, this is weird to say,</p>
<p>but I feel like you have to consider</p>
<p>that the earth may be flat for like one minute.</p>
<p>Like you have to be empathetic.</p>
<p>You have to be open minded.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a lot of that</p>
<p>through our cultural taste makers and more.</p>
<p>And that really is what concerns me the most.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s just another manifestation</p>
<p>of all of our problems.</p>
<p>Is that we have this completely bifurcating economy,</p>
<p>bifurcating culture, literally,</p>
<p>in terms of we have the middle of the country</p>
<p>and then we have the coast.</p>
<p>And in terms of the population, it&rsquo;s almost 50, 50.</p>
<p>And with increasing mega cities and urban culture,</p>
<p>like urban monoculture of LA, New York and Chicago</p>
<p>and DC and Boston and Austin,</p>
<p>relative to how an entire other group</p>
<p>of Americans live their lives,</p>
<p>or even the people within them</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t rich and upwardly mobile,</p>
<p>how they live their lives is just completely separating.</p>
<p>And all of our language and communication</p>
<p>in mass media and more is to the top.</p>
<p>And then everybody else is forgotten.</p>
<p>Do you think when you dig to the core,</p>
<p>there is a big gap between left and right?</p>
<p>Is that division that&rsquo;s perceived currently real</p>
<p>or are most people center left and center right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s such a loaded term, center left.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Like to you, I think the way you&rsquo;re thinking of it is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like a, well, even this,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not a radical socialist,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m marginally left on cultural issues</p>
<p>and economic issues.</p>
<p>This is how we&rsquo;ve traditionally understood things.</p>
<p>And then in popular discourse, like center right,</p>
<p>like what does it mean to be center right?</p>
<p>Like I am marginally right on social issues</p>
<p>and marginally right on economic issues.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just not, like if you look at survey data,</p>
<p>for example, like stimulus checks,</p>
<p>people who are against stimulus checks are conservative.</p>
<p>Well, 80% of the population is for a stimulus check.</p>
<p>So that means a sizable number of Republicans</p>
<p>are for stimulus checks.</p>
<p>Same thing happens on like a wealth tax.</p>
<p>The same thing happens on, okay, Florida voted for Trump,</p>
<p>3.1%, more than Barack Obama, 2008,</p>
<p>on the same day passes a $15 minimum wage at 67%.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s my entire career.</p>
<p>But it seems like, so that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Conversation is different than the policies.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s different than reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would say,</p>
<p>which is that the way we have to understand</p>
<p>American politics today, it didn&rsquo;t always</p>
<p>used to be this way, is it&rsquo;s almost entirely long.</p>
<p>Basic, I would say the main divider is,</p>
<p>because even when you talk about class,</p>
<p>this misses it in terms of socioeconomics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s around culture, which is that it&rsquo;s basically,</p>
<p>if you went to a four year degree granting institution,</p>
<p>you are part of one culture.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re part of another.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna erase the 20% or whatever of people</p>
<p>who did go to a college degree who are Republicans</p>
<p>or vice versa, et cetera, but I&rsquo;m saying on average,</p>
<p>in terms of the median way that you feel,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re basically bifurcating along those lines.</p>
<p>And because people get upset, be like,</p>
<p>oh, well, there are rich people who vote for Trump.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, but you know who they are?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like plumbers or something.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re people who make $100,000 a year,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t go to a four year college degree</p>
<p>and they might live who are in a place</p>
<p>which is not an urban metro area.</p>
<p>And then at the same time, you have like a Vox writer</p>
<p>who makes like 30 grand,</p>
<p>but they have a lot more cultural power</p>
<p>than like the plumber.</p>
<p>So you have to think about where exactly that line is.</p>
<p>And I think in general, that&rsquo;s the way that we&rsquo;re trending.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why when I say like, what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>are we divided?</p>
<p>Yeah, like, but it&rsquo;s not left and right.</p>
<p>I mean, like, and that&rsquo;s why I hate these labels.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more just red and blue like teams.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re arbitrary teams.</p>
<p>So how arbitrary are these teams,</p>
<p>I guess is another.</p>
<p>Completely arbitrary.</p>
<p>So, well, you kind of imply that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re sort of in post analyzing the patterns</p>
<p>because it seems like there&rsquo;s a network effects</p>
<p>of like, you just pick the team red or blue</p>
<p>and it might have to do with college.</p>
<p>You might have to do all of those things,</p>
<p>but like, it seems like it&rsquo;s more about</p>
<p>just the people around you.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So less than whether you went to college or not.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s almost like, seems like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a weird, like network effects that are hard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain strong patterns you&rsquo;re identifying,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad to think that it might be just teams</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with what you actually believe.</p>
<p>Well, it is, Lex.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to believe that,</p>
<p>but the data points me to this, which especially 2020,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the people chief among them.</p>
<p>I will own up to it here.</p>
<p>I was totally wrong about why Trump was elected in 2016.</p>
<p>I believed and based a lot of my public commentary beliefs</p>
<p>on this, Trump was elected because of a rejection</p>
<p>of Hillary Clinton neoliberalism on the back</p>
<p>of a pro worker message, which was anti immigration.</p>
<p>It was its pillar, but alongside of it was a rejection</p>
<p>of free trade with China and generally</p>
<p>of the political correctness and globalism,</p>
<p>which has been come in through the uniparty</p>
<p>and same thing here with the military industrial complex</p>
<p>and endless war, he rejected all of that.</p>
<p>Wait, what&rsquo;s wrong with that prediction?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wrong, man.</p>
<p>And the reason I know this is that it sounds right.</p>
<p>I wish it, I honestly wish it was true,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>Trump actually governed largely as a neoliberal Republican</p>
<p>who was meaner online and who departed from orthodoxy</p>
<p>in some very important ways.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>I will always support the trade war with China.</p>
<p>I will always support not expanding the wars</p>
<p>in Afghanistan and in Iraq.</p>
<p>I will support him moving the Overton window</p>
<p>on a million different things and revealing once</p>
<p>and for all that GOP voters don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about economic orthodoxy necessarily.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what they do care about.</p>
<p>Trump got more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016,</p>
<p>despite not delivering largely for all the Trump people</p>
<p>out there on that agenda.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t more pro union, but he won more union votes.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t necessarily more pro worker,</p>
<p>but he actually won more votes in Ohio than he did in 2016.</p>
<p>And he won more Hispanic votes than despite being</p>
<p>all the immigration rhetoric, et cetera.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why, it&rsquo;s about the culture,</p>
<p>which is that the culture war is so hot</p>
<p>that negative partisanship is at such high levels.</p>
<p>All of the vote is geared upon what the other guy</p>
<p>might do in office.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a poll actually just came out</p>
<p>by Echelon Insights.</p>
<p>Crystal and I were talking about it on Rising,</p>
<p>that number one concern amongst Democratic voters</p>
<p>is Trump voters, number one concern.</p>
<p>Not issues like Trump voters.</p>
<p>And number two is white supremacy.</p>
<p>And so like, which is basically code for Trump voters.</p>
<p>And is the same true for the other side?</p>
<p>Also on the right, the number one concern</p>
<p>is illegal immigration.</p>
<p>And number, I think, three or four or whatever is Antifa,</p>
<p>which is code for Democrats.</p>
<p>At least on the right is a policy kind of thing.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I saw Ben Shapiro was talking about this.</p>
<p>But the reason why I would functionally say it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>is because, I mean, you can believe whether it&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>I think it actually largely is true.</p>
<p>But a lot of GOP voters feel like a lot of illegal</p>
<p>immigration is code for people who are coming in,</p>
<p>who are gonna be legalized and are gonna go vote Democrat.</p>
<p>Like, I can just explain it from their point of view.</p>
<p>So like, what does that actually mean?</p>
<p>Each other, like each other,</p>
<p>which is that the number one concern is the other person.</p>
<p>So negative partisanship has never been higher.</p>
<p>And I think people who had my thesis</p>
<p>in terms of why Trump was elected in 2016,</p>
<p>you have to grapple with this.</p>
<p>Like, how did he win 10 million more votes?</p>
<p>He came 44,000 votes away from winning the presidency</p>
<p>across three states.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t, none of our popular discourse reflects</p>
<p>that very stark reality.</p>
<p>And I think so much of it is people really hate liberals.</p>
<p>Like, they just really hate them.</p>
<p>And I was driving through rural Nevada before the election.</p>
<p>And I was like, literally in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>And there was this massive sign</p>
<p>this guy had out in front of his house.</p>
<p>And it just said, Trump, colon, fuck your feelings.</p>
<p>And I was like, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That is why people voted for Trump.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to denigrate it because they truly feel</p>
<p>they have no cultural power in America,</p>
<p>except to raise the middle finger to the elite class</p>
<p>by pressing the button for Trump.</p>
<p>I get that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a totally rational way to vote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the way I wish we did vote,</p>
<p>but like, you know, that&rsquo;s not my place to say.</p>
<p>So this is interesting.</p>
<p>If you could just psychoanalyze,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m again, probably naive about this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m really bothered by the hatred of liberals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this amorphous monster that&rsquo;s mocked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Shapiro liberal tears.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also really bothered by</p>
<p>probably more of my colleagues and friends,</p>
<p>the hatred of Trump.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Trump and white supremacists.</p>
<p>So apparently there&rsquo;s 70 million white supremacists,</p>
<p>75 million, sorry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s millions of white supremacists.</p>
<p>And apparently whatever liberal is,</p>
<p>I mean, literally liberal has become</p>
<p>equivalent to white supremacists</p>
<p>in the power of negativity it arouses.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what those,</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, they&rsquo;ve become swears essentially.</p>
<p>Is that, I mean, how do we get out of this?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s why I just don&rsquo;t even say anything</p>
<p>about politics online.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like, really?</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t, here&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>Anything you say that&rsquo;s like thoughtful,</p>
<p>like, hmm, I wonder, immigration, something.</p>
<p>I wonder like why we have these many,</p>
<p>we allow these many immigrants in</p>
<p>or some version of the like thinking through</p>
<p>these difficult policies and so on.</p>
<p>They immediately tried to find like a single word</p>
<p>in something you say that can put you in a bin</p>
<p>of liberal or white supremacists</p>
<p>and then hammer you to death</p>
<p>by saying you&rsquo;re one of the two.</p>
<p>And then everybody just piles on happily</p>
<p>that we finally nailed this white supremacist or liberal.</p>
<p>And that, is this some kind of weird</p>
<p>like feature of online communication</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve just stumbled upon?</p>
<p>Is there a way or is it possible to argue</p>
<p>that this is like a feature, not a bug?</p>
<p>Like, this is a good thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, look, I just think it&rsquo;s a reflection</p>
<p>of who we are.</p>
<p>People like to blame social media.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re just incredibly divided right now.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve been divided like this for the last 20 years.</p>
<p>And I think that, the reason I focus almost 99%</p>
<p>of my public commentary on economics</p>
<p>is because you asked an important question at the top.</p>
<p>How do we fix this?</p>
<p>What did I say about the stimulus checks?</p>
<p>Stimulus checks have 80% approval rating.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the type of thing.</p>
<p>If I was Joe Biden and I wanted to actually</p>
<p>heal this country, that&rsquo;s the very first thing</p>
<p>I would have done when I came into office.</p>
<p>Same thing on when you look at anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna increase wages.</p>
<p>I said on the show, I was like, look,</p>
<p>I think Joe Biden will have an 80% approval rating</p>
<p>if he does two things.</p>
<p>If he gives every American a $2,000 stimulus check</p>
<p>and gives everybody who wants a vaccine a vaccine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple.</p>
<p>Cause here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like Greg Abbott that much.</p>
<p>We have like very different politics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Texas, but my parents got vaccinated</p>
<p>really quickly.</p>
<p>That means something to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, listen, I don&rsquo;t really care</p>
<p>about a lot of the other stuff.</p>
<p>He got my family vaccinated.</p>
<p>Like that, well, I will forever remember that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we will remember the checks.</p>
<p>This is a part of a reason why Trump</p>
<p>almost won the election and why,</p>
<p>if the Republicans had been smart enough</p>
<p>to give him another round of checks,</p>
<p>100% would have won.</p>
<p>Which is that people were like, look,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like Trump, but I got a check</p>
<p>with his name on it.</p>
<p>And that meant something to me and my family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying for all the libertarians out there</p>
<p>that they should go and like endlessly spend money</p>
<p>and buy votes.</p>
<p>What I am saying is lean into the majoritarian positions</p>
<p>without adding your culture war bullshit on top of it.</p>
<p>So for example, what&rsquo;s the number one concern</p>
<p>that AOC says after the first round of checks got out?</p>
<p>Oh, the checks didn&rsquo;t go to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, are you out of your fucking mind?</p>
<p>Like this is the most popular policy America</p>
<p>has probably done in 50 years,</p>
<p>since like Medicare and you&rsquo;re ruining it.</p>
<p>And then on the right is the same thing,</p>
<p>which is that they&rsquo;ll be like,</p>
<p>these checks are going to like, you know,</p>
<p>low level blah, blah, you know,</p>
<p>people who are lazy and don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, there you go, you know,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re just playing a caricature of what you are.</p>
<p>Like if you lean into those issues</p>
<p>and you got to do it clean,</p>
<p>this is what everybody hates about DC,</p>
<p>which is that Biden right now is doing the $1,400 checks,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s looping it in with his COVID relief bill</p>
<p>and all that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his prerogative, that&rsquo;s the Democrats prerogative.</p>
<p>They won the election, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I would have done if I was him,</p>
<p>I would have come in and I would have said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s five United States senators</p>
<p>who are on the record, Republicans,</p>
<p>who said they&rsquo;ll vote for a $2,000 check.</p>
<p>And I would put that on the floor of the United States Senate</p>
<p>on my, you know, first or the first day possible.</p>
<p>And I would have passed it</p>
<p>and I would have forced those Republican senators</p>
<p>to live up to that, vote for this bill,</p>
<p>come to the Oval Office for a signing</p>
<p>so that the very first thing of my presidency</p>
<p>was to say, I&rsquo;m giving you all this relief check,</p>
<p>this long national nightmare is over.</p>
<p>Take this money, do with it what you need.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all suffered together.</p>
<p>The thing about Biden is he has a portrait of FDR</p>
<p>and is in the Oval, which kind of bothers me</p>
<p>because he thinks of himself as an FDR like figure.</p>
<p>But this is, you have to understand the majesty of FDR.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a person</p>
<p>who passed a piece of legislation</p>
<p>five days after he became president.</p>
<p>And he passed 15 transformative pieces of legislation</p>
<p>in the first 100 days.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on day like 34, 35, and nothing has passed.</p>
<p>The reconciliation bill will eventually become law,</p>
<p>but it will become law with no Republican votes.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not fulfilling that legacy</p>
<p>and the urgency of the action.</p>
<p>And the mandate, which I believe that history has handed,</p>
<p>it handed it to Trump and he fucked it up, right?</p>
<p>He totally screwed it up.</p>
<p>He could have remade America</p>
<p>and made us into the greatest country ever</p>
<p>coming out on the other side of this.</p>
<p>He decided not to do that.</p>
<p>I think Biden was again handed that like a scepter almost.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all you have to do,</p>
<p>all America wants is for you to raise it up high,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s keeping it within the realm of traditional politics.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a huge mistake.</p>
<p>Why, so this is, everything he&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>is makes perfect sense, like take, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like, again, if the aliens showed up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the obvious thing to do is like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the popular thing?</p>
<p>Like 80% of Americans support this.</p>
<p>Like do that clean.</p>
<p>Also do it like with like grace,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re able to bring people together,</p>
<p>not like in a political way,</p>
<p>but like obvious common sense way.</p>
<p>Like just people, the Republicans and Democrats</p>
<p>just bring them together on a policy and like bold,</p>
<p>just hammer it without the dirt, without the mess,</p>
<p>whatever, try to compromise.</p>
<p>Just the yellow have a good Twitter account,</p>
<p>like loud, very clear.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna give a $2,000 or a stimulus check.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants a vaccine gets a vaccine at scale.</p>
<p>What make America, let&rsquo;s make America great again</p>
<p>by manufacturing.</p>
<p>Like we are manufacturing most of the world&rsquo;s vaccine</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re bad motherfuckers.</p>
<p>And without maybe with more eloquence than that</p>
<p>and just do that.</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t we seen that for many, for several presidencies?</p>
<p>Because of coalitional politics</p>
<p>and they owe something to somebody else.</p>
<p>For example, Biden has got a lot</p>
<p>of the Democratic constituency has to satisfy</p>
<p>within this bill.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of shit that goes in there,</p>
<p>state and local aid, all this stuff.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not even saying this is bad,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s like, his theory is, and this isn&rsquo;t wrong,</p>
<p>is like we&rsquo;re gonna take the really popular stuff</p>
<p>and use it as cover for the more downwardly less popular.</p>
<p>And so the Dems could face the accusation,</p>
<p>the people who are on this side,</p>
<p>this is their pushback to me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, why would we give away the most popular thing</p>
<p>in the bill and then we would never be able</p>
<p>to pass state and local aid, right?</p>
<p>Why would we do, and the Republicans do the same thing,</p>
<p>right, like Mitch McConnell, because he&rsquo;s a fucking idiot,</p>
<p>decided to say, we&rsquo;re gonna pair these $2,000 stimulus checks</p>
<p>with like section 230 repeal.</p>
<p>And it was like, oh, it&rsquo;s obviously dead, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not gonna happen together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s largely why I believe Trump lost the election</p>
<p>and why those races down in Georgia</p>
<p>went the way that they did.</p>
<p>Obviously Trump had something to do with it,</p>
<p>but the reason why is they have longstanding things</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve wanted to get done.</p>
<p>And in the words of Rahm Emanuel, never let a good crisis</p>
<p>go to waste and try and get as much as you possibly can done</p>
<p>within a single bill.</p>
<p>My counter would be this,</p>
<p>things have worked this way for too long,</p>
<p>which is that the reconciliation bill</p>
<p>is almost certainly going to be the only large</p>
<p>signature legislative accomplishment</p>
<p>of the Biden presidency.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just how American politics works.</p>
<p>Maybe he gets one more, maybe one.</p>
<p>He has a second reconciliation bill,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re running for midterms, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>I believe that by trying to change the paradigm</p>
<p>of our politics, leaning into exactly what I&rsquo;m talking here,</p>
<p>you could possibly transcend that to a new one.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not naive.</p>
<p>I think people respond to political pressures.</p>
<p>And the way that we found this out was David Perdue,</p>
<p>who was just a total corporate dollar general CEO guy.</p>
<p>He was against the original $1,200 stimulus checks.</p>
<p>But then Trump came out, who&rsquo;s the single most popular</p>
<p>figure in the Republican party.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I want $2,000 stimulus checks.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, Perdue running in Georgia is like,</p>
<p>yeah, I&rsquo;m with President Trump,</p>
<p>I want a $2,000 stimulus check.</p>
<p>That was, if you&rsquo;re an astute observer of politics,</p>
<p>to say, you can see there that you can force people</p>
<p>to do the right thing because it&rsquo;s the popular thing.</p>
<p>And that if it&rsquo;s clean, if you don&rsquo;t give them</p>
<p>any other excuse, they have to do it.</p>
<p>So this is what we&rsquo;ve been gaslit into our culture war</p>
<p>framework of politics.</p>
<p>And the reason it feels so broken and awful</p>
<p>is because it is, but there is a way out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that nobody wants to be, it&rsquo;s a game of chicken,</p>
<p>because maybe it is true.</p>
<p>Maybe we would never be able to get</p>
<p>your other democratic priorities,</p>
<p>your Republican priorities.</p>
<p>But I think that the country understands</p>
<p>that this is fucking terrible and would be willing</p>
<p>to support somebody who does it differently.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a lot of disincentives to not stay without,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of incentives to not stray</p>
<p>from the traditional path.</p>
<p>Yeah, is it also possible that the A students</p>
<p>are not participating?</p>
<p>Like we drove all of the superstars away from politics.</p>
<p>So like you just had this argument before.</p>
<p>I mean, everything you&rsquo;re saying sort of rings true.</p>
<p>Like this is the obvious thing to do.</p>
<p>As a student of history, you can almost like tell,</p>
<p>like, if you look at great people in history,</p>
<p>this is what great leaders in history,</p>
<p>this is what they did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like clean, bold action, sometimes facing crisis,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re facing a crisis right now.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re in a crisis.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been, exactly.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we see those leaders step up?</p>
<p>I mean, you say that&rsquo;s kind of like, it makes sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different interests at play.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna risk too many things, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But that sounds like the C students.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s that the pipeline of politician creation</p>
<p>is just totally broken from beginning to end.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that A students don&rsquo;t wanna be politicians.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically the way that our current primary system</p>
<p>is constructed, is what is the greatest threat to you</p>
<p>as a member of Congress?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not losing your reelection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s losing your primary, right?</p>
<p>So that means, especially in a safe district,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re most concerned about being hit</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a Republican from the right,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re a Democrat from the left</p>
<p>for not being a good enough one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually what stops people,</p>
<p>heterodox people in particular, from winning primaries</p>
<p>because the people who vote in our primaries</p>
<p>are the party faithful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you get the production.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand the production pipeline,</p>
<p>which is that, all right, I&rsquo;m from Texas,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what I know best.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, if you think in Texas,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a more heterodox like state legislature</p>
<p>or something who works with the left on this and does that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get your ass beat in a Republican primary</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna be like,</p>
<p>he worked with the left to do this, blah, blah,</p>
<p>take it out of context, and you&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
<p>And then that means you never ascend up</p>
<p>the next level of the ladder,</p>
<p>and then so on and so forth all the way.</p>
<p>But I do think Trump changed everything.</p>
<p>This is why I have some hope,</p>
<p>which is that he showed me that all the people I listened to</p>
<p>were totally wrong about politics,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the most valuable lesson you could ever teach me,</p>
<p>which was, I was like, wait,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have to listen to these people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, they don&rsquo;t know anything, actually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s powerful, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, he did it.</p>
<p>This guy.</p>
<p>Even if he didn&rsquo;t do anything with it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>He showed that it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And that means a lot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s young people right now</p>
<p>that kind of look, turn around and like, huh.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, wait, I don&rsquo;t have to comb my hair</p>
<p>a certain way and go to law school and be an asshole</p>
<p>who everybody knows is an asshole.</p>
<p>And then get elected to state legislature.</p>
<p>I mean, look, who&rsquo;s the number one person</p>
<p>in the New York City primary right now?</p>
<p>Andrew Yang.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s polling higher than everybody else in the race.</p>
<p>Look, maybe the polls are totally fucked</p>
<p>and maybe he&rsquo;ll lose because of ranked choice voting</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>But I consider Andrew, I mean, I know him a little bit</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve followed his candidacy from the very beginning.</p>
<p>I consider him an inspiration.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the new generation of politics.</p>
<p>Like if I see who&rsquo;s gonna be president 20 years from now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be, I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s gonna be Andrew Yang.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be somebody like Andrew Yang</p>
<p>outside the political system</p>
<p>who talks in a totally different way, right?</p>
<p>Just a completely, one of my favorite things</p>
<p>that he said on the debate stage,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, look at us, we&rsquo;re all wearing makeup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy, you know?</p>
<p>And he like, he like brought that, that he brought that.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s writing like, yeah, why are they all wearing makeup?</p>
<p>He probably arguably hasn&rsquo;t gone far enough almost.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But he showed that it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And then you see other, like AOC is a good example</p>
<p>of somebody, at least in my opinion,</p>
<p>is doing the same kind of thing, but going too far in like,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t know, she&rsquo;s doing the Trump thing,</p>
<p>but on the other side.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, what&rsquo;s too far?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take a normative judgment of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I will tell you the future of politics</p>
<p>looks like AOC. Appreciate the art of it.</p>
<p>Right, no, I do.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not a big AOC fan,</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s a genius, media genius,</p>
<p>once in a generation talent.</p>
<p>The way that she uses social media, Instagram,</p>
<p>and everybody on the right is like trying to copy her.</p>
<p>Like Matt Gaetz is like, I want to be the conservative AOC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s just not going to happen, dude.</p>
<p>Like you just don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>Like what she has, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s electric.</p>
<p>And Trump had that.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been to a Trump rally,</p>
<p>like to cover as a journalist,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing like it in America.</p>
<p>And Yang is similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same way where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>there is something going on here,</p>
<p>which is just like, I&rsquo;ve been doing Obama rally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to a Clinton rally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to several normal politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine, you know, with Trump and with Yang,</p>
<p>it was, it&rsquo;s another world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another world.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yang gang.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably thousands of people listening right now,</p>
<p>who are just like doing a slow clap.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>Yang gang forever.</p>
<p>Okay, but yeah, I mean, my worst fear,</p>
<p>I prefer Andrew Yang kind of free improvisational idea,</p>
<p>exchange, all that versus AOC,</p>
<p>who I think no matter what she stands for</p>
<p>is a drama machine, creates dramas just like Trump does.</p>
<p>I would say my worst fear would be in 2024,</p>
<p>is AOC old enough?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be AOC versus Trump.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s old enough.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d have to be, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s 30.</p>
<p>So she needs five more years.</p>
<p>So probably not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, but that kind of, that&rsquo;s, or Trump Jr.</p>
<p>Well, AOC probably wouldn&rsquo;t win a Democratic primary.</p>
<p>So, I mean, look, Joe Biden is, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s pretty much showed that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>This process grooms you over time.</p>
<p>You see the same thing in academia actually,</p>
<p>which is very interesting,</p>
<p>is the process of getting tenure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re being taught</p>
<p>without explicitly being taught</p>
<p>to behave in the way that everybody&rsquo;s behaved before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this, it was funny.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few conversations</p>
<p>that were deeply disappointing,</p>
<p>which involved statements like,</p>
<p>this is what&rsquo;s good for your career.</p>
<p>This kind of conversation,</p>
<p>almost like mentor to mentee conversation,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a grooming process in the same way.</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;re saying the primary process</p>
<p>does the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>So, I mean, that&rsquo;s what people have talked about</p>
<p>with Andrew Yang.</p>
<p>He was being suppressed by a bunch of different forces,</p>
<p>the mainstream media and all.</p>
<p>Just the Democratic, just that whole process</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like the honesty that he was showing, right?</p>
<p>For now, but here&rsquo;s my question to you.</p>
<p>People gotta see, look, Jordan Peterson</p>
<p>is one of the most famous people in America, right?</p>
<p>Like you have a massive podcast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more famous than half, 99% of the people at MIT.</p>
<p>So like, from that perspective, everything has changed.</p>
<p>And somewhere out there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a student who&rsquo;s taking notice.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve noticed that with my own career,</p>
<p>everybody thought I was crazy</p>
<p>for doing this show with Crystal, The Hill.</p>
<p>They thought I was nuts.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, what are you doing?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a White House correspondent.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a job forever.</p>
<p>The other job offer I had</p>
<p>was being a White House correspondent.</p>
<p>And people thought I was nuts</p>
<p>for not just sticking there and aging out within Washington,</p>
<p>pining for appearances on Fox News and CNN and MSNBC.</p>
<p>But I hated it.</p>
<p>I just hated doing it.</p>
<p>I did not wanna be a company man, like a Washington man,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of those guys who like brags to his friends</p>
<p>about how many times he&rsquo;s been on Fox or whatever,</p>
<p>mostly because I just have a rebellious streak</p>
<p>and I hate being at the subject of other people.</p>
<p>I created something new,</p>
<p>which a lot of people watch to get their news.</p>
<p>And I noticed that younger people</p>
<p>who are almost all my audience,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really look up to any of the people</p>
<p>in traditional, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t go and they&rsquo;re not coming up and being like,</p>
<p>how do I be like Jim Acosta?</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re like, hey, how did you do what you do?</p>
<p>And the way you did it is by bucking the system.</p>
<p>So I think that we are at a total split point.</p>
<p>And look, there will always be a path for people.</p>
<p>Cause like, I don&rsquo;t want people to over learn this lesson.</p>
<p>I have people who are like, I&rsquo;m not gonna go to college.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, just wait.</p>
<p>Yeah, like, I&rsquo;m like, just like stop,</p>
<p>just like, just hold on a second.</p>
<p>But there will always be a path for the institutional</p>
<p>that will always be there for you.</p>
<p>But now there&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s another game in town.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s more appealing to millions and millions</p>
<p>and millions and millions of people</p>
<p>who feel unserved by the corporate media,</p>
<p>CNN and these people,</p>
<p>possibly who feel unserved in the, you know, the faculty.</p>
<p>Like if you are an up and comer</p>
<p>who wants to teach as many young people as possible,</p>
<p>I think you should be on YouTube, right?</p>
<p>Like look at the Khan Academy guy,</p>
<p>that guy created a huge business.</p>
<p>So I just think we can be cynical</p>
<p>and like upset about what that system is,</p>
<p>but we should also have hope.</p>
<p>Like I have a lot of hope for what can be in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a guy people should check out.</p>
<p>So my story is a little bit different</p>
<p>because I basically stepped aside</p>
<p>with the dream of being an entrepreneur</p>
<p>earlier in the pipeline</p>
<p>than like a legitimate, like senior faculty would.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an example of somebody people should check out,</p>
<p>Andrew Huberman from Stanford, who&rsquo;s a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s as world class as it gets</p>
<p>in terms of like 10 year faculty,</p>
<p>just a really world class researcher.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s doing YouTube.</p>
<p>Yeah, I see him on Instagram.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So he not just does Instagram, he now has a podcast</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s changing the nature of like,</p>
<p>I believe that Andrew might be the future of Stanford.</p>
<p>And for a lot, it&rsquo;s funny, like he&rsquo;s basically,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan is an inspiration to Andrew and to me as well.</p>
<p>And those ripple effects and Andrew is an inspiration</p>
<p>probably just like you&rsquo;re saying to these young,</p>
<p>like 25 year olds who are soon to become faculty,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re just talking about academia.</p>
<p>And the same is probably happening with government is,</p>
<p>funny enough, Trump probably is inspiring</p>
<p>a huge number of people who are saying, wait a minute,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to play by the rules.</p>
<p>And I can think outside the box here and you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And the institutions we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>are just probably lagging behind.</p>
<p>So the optimistic view is the future</p>
<p>is going to be full of exciting new ideas.</p>
<p>So Andrew Young is just kind of the beginning</p>
<p>of this whole thing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>And I hope that iceberg doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not this influencer.</p>
<p>One of the things that really bothers me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten the chance, I should be careful here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna, I love everybody,</p>
<p>but these people who talk about like,</p>
<p>how to make your first million or how to succeed.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re so, I mean, yeah,</p>
<p>that makes me a little bit cynical</p>
<p>about, I&rsquo;m worried that the people</p>
<p>that win the game of politics will be ones</p>
<p>that want to win the game of politics.</p>
<p>They are, they are, man.</p>
<p>And like we mentioned, AOC,</p>
<p>I hope they optimize for the 80% populist thing, right?</p>
<p>Like they optimize for that bad thing,</p>
<p>that history will remember you as the great man</p>
<p>or woman that did this thing,</p>
<p>versus how do I maximize engagement today</p>
<p>and keep growing those numbers?</p>
<p>The influencers are so, I&rsquo;m so allergic to this, man.</p>
<p>They keep saying how many followers they have</p>
<p>on the different accounts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t think they understand.</p>
<p>Maybe I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>I think it has destructive psychological effects.</p>
<p>One, like thinking about the number,</p>
<p>like getting excited, your number went from 100 to 101</p>
<p>and being like, and today went out to 105.</p>
<p>Whoa, that&rsquo;s a big jump.</p>
<p>Then maybe like thinking this way,</p>
<p>like I wonder what I did, I&rsquo;ll do that again.</p>
<p>In this way, one, it creates anxiety</p>
<p>and those psychological effects, whatever.</p>
<p>The more important thing is it prevents you</p>
<p>from truly thinking boldly in the long arc of history</p>
<p>and creatively, thinking outside the box,</p>
<p>doing huge actions.</p>
<p>And I actually, my optimism is in the sense</p>
<p>that that kind of action will beat out all the influencers.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know, Lex, this is where my cynicism comes in.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a guy, Madison Cawthorn,</p>
<p>the youngest member of Congress.</p>
<p>And he, I don&rsquo;t want to say got caught,</p>
<p>but there was like an email where he was like,</p>
<p>my staff is only oriented around comms.</p>
<p>Like he was basically saying,</p>
<p>he got basically caught saying like,</p>
<p>my staff is only centered on communications.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the right play.</p>
<p>If you do want to get the benefits</p>
<p>of our current electoral political and engagement system,</p>
<p>which is that what&rsquo;s the best way to be known</p>
<p>within the right as a right wing politician.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to be a culture warrior, go on Ben Shapiro&rsquo;s podcast,</p>
<p>be one of the people on Fox News,</p>
<p>go on Sean Hannity&rsquo;s show, go on Tucker&rsquo;s show</p>
<p>and all of that, because you become a mini celebrity</p>
<p>within that world.</p>
<p>Left unsaid is that that world is increasingly shrinking</p>
<p>portion of the American population.</p>
<p>And they barely, they can&rsquo;t even win a popular vote election,</p>
<p>let alone barely win, eke out an electoral college victory</p>
<p>in 2016.</p>
<p>Well, but the incentives are all aligned within that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same thing really on the left,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re right, which is that,</p>
<p>ultimately, and look, this is why geniuses are geniuses</p>
<p>because they buck the short term incentives.</p>
<p>They focus on the long term, they bet big</p>
<p>and they usually fail.</p>
<p>But then when they get big, they succeed spectacularly.</p>
<p>The people I know who have done this the best</p>
<p>are like a lot of the crypto folks that I&rsquo;ve spoken to.</p>
<p>Like some of the stuff they say, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s gonna happen,</p>
<p>but look, they&rsquo;re like billionaires, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, so they were right.</p>
<p>The way I&rsquo;ve heard it expressed is you can be wrong a lot,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re right, you get right big.</p>
<p>And I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen this in Elon Musk&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>I mean, he took spectacular risk, like spectacular risk</p>
<p>and just doubled down, doubled down, doubled down,</p>
<p>doubled down, doubled down.</p>
<p>And you can kind of tell to him,</p>
<p>I mean, you know him better than I do,</p>
<p>but like from my observation,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the money matters, right?</p>
<p>I just, like when I see him, I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>nobody works as hard as you do</p>
<p>and builds the way that you build</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s just about the money.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Like nobody wills SpaceX into existence just for the money.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not worth it, frankly, right?</p>
<p>Like he probably destroyed years of his life</p>
<p>and like mental sanity.</p>
<p>Money or attention or fame, none of that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the primary priority.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so appealing to me,</p>
<p>to me in particular about him, just like in how he built.</p>
<p>Like I read a biography of him</p>
<p>and just like the way that he constructed his life</p>
<p>and like we&rsquo;re able to hyperfocus</p>
<p>in meeting after meeting and drill down</p>
<p>and also hire all the right people</p>
<p>who execute each one of his tasks discreetly</p>
<p>to his perfection is amazing.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s actually the mark of a good leader.</p>
<p>But I mean, if you think about his career,</p>
<p>the reason he&rsquo;s a renegade is cause probably he was told</p>
<p>to like put it in an index fund or whatever.</p>
<p>Like whenever he made his like 29 million</p>
<p>and from PayPal, I don&rsquo;t know how much he made.</p>
<p>And then just go along that road and he&rsquo;s like, no.</p>
<p>So he succeeds spectacularly.</p>
<p>So you have to have somebody who&rsquo;s willing to come in</p>
<p>and buck that system.</p>
<p>So for now, I think our politics are generally frozen.</p>
<p>I think that that model is gonna be most generally appealing</p>
<p>to the mean person, but somebody will come along</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll change everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m just surprised there&rsquo;s not more of them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On that topic, it&rsquo;s now 20, what is it, 21?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make some predictions that you can be wrong about.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>What major political people are you thinking will run</p>
<p>in 2024, including Trump, junior, senior, or Ivanka?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Any Trump.</p>
<p>Trump.</p>
<p>And who do you think wins?</p>
<p>I think Joe Biden will run again in 2024.</p>
<p>And I think he will run against someone</p>
<p>with the last name Trump.</p>
<p>I do not know whether that is Trump or Trump junior,</p>
<p>but I think one of those people will probably</p>
<p>be the GOP nominee in 2024.</p>
<p>Who is it?</p>
<p>Some prominent political figure, was it Romney?</p>
<p>Somebody like that said that Trump will win the primary</p>
<p>if he runs again.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not even a question.</p>
<p>Trump is the single most popular figure</p>
<p>in the Republican party by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Still.</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, probably more, honestly.</p>
<p>There was a, actually, I can tell you</p>
<p>because I saw the data, which is that pre January 6th,</p>
<p>it was like 54% of Republicans wanted him to run again.</p>
<p>Then it went down eight points after January 6th,</p>
<p>two days later.</p>
<p>And then after impeachment, it went right back up to 54%.</p>
<p>So the exact same number is in February,</p>
<p>post impeachment vote, as it was after November.</p>
<p>Now look, yeah, again, surveys, bullshit, et cetera.</p>
<p>But like, that&rsquo;s all the data we have.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I can point you to.</p>
<p>If Trump runs, he will be the nominee</p>
<p>and he will be the 2024 nominee.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know if he wants to.</p>
<p>It really depends.</p>
<p>Do you think he wins?</p>
<p>After the Trump vaccine heals all of us,</p>
<p>do you think Trump wins?</p>
<p>It depends on how popular culture functions</p>
<p>over the next four years.</p>
<p>And I can tell you that they are,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think Biden has that much to do with it.</p>
<p>Because again, Trump is not a manifestation</p>
<p>of an affirmative policy action.</p>
<p>It is a defensive bulwark wall against cultural liberalism.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, this is why it doesn&rsquo;t matter what Biden does.</p>
<p>If there are more riots,</p>
<p>if there is a more sense of persecution</p>
<p>amongst people who are more lean towards conservative</p>
<p>or like, hey, I don&rsquo;t know about that, that&rsquo;s crazy,</p>
<p>then he very well could win.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s say Joe Biden doesn&rsquo;t run</p>
<p>and they put up like Kamala Harris,</p>
<p>I think he would beat her.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a question</p>
<p>that Trump would beat Kamala Harris in 2024.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t think anybody else,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how the process works,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think anybody else on the Democratic side</p>
<p>can take the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, how could you run against the sitting vice president?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, Joe Biden has a 98% approval rating</p>
<p>in the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>If he says, she is my heir,</p>
<p>I think enough people will listen to him</p>
<p>in a competitive primary or a noncompetitive primary.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s all these things</p>
<p>about how primary systems themselves are rigged,</p>
<p>the DNC could make it known</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll blacklist anybody</p>
<p>who does try and primary Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>And look, I mean,</p>
<p>progressives aren&rsquo;t necessarily all that popular</p>
<p>amongst actual Democrats,</p>
<p>like we found that out during the election.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an entire constituency which loves Joe Biden</p>
<p>and Joe Biden level politics.</p>
<p>And so if he tells them to vote for Kamala,</p>
<p>I think she would probably get it.</p>
<p>But again, there&rsquo;s a lot of game theory obviously happening.</p>
<p>Well, see, I think you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;re saying is correct</p>
<p>about mediocre candidates.</p>
<p>It feels like if there&rsquo;s somebody like a really strong,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna use this term incorrectly,</p>
<p>but populist, somebody that speaks to the 80%</p>
<p>that is able to provide bold,</p>
<p>eloquently described solutions that are popular.</p>
<p>I think that breaks through all of this nonsense.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>How do they break through the primary system?</p>
<p>Cause the problem is the primary system is not populism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s primary.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think they can tweet their way to.</p>
<p>Well, you have to be willing to win a GOP primary.</p>
<p>You basically have to be at,</p>
<p>whoever wins the GOP primary, in my opinion,</p>
<p>will be the person most hated by the left.</p>
<p>One of the people, things that people forget is,</p>
<p>you know who came in second to Trump?</p>
<p>Ted Cruz.</p>
<p>And the reason why is because Ted Cruz</p>
<p>was the second most hated guy by liberals in America.</p>
<p>A second to Trump.</p>
<p>They have nothing in policy in common.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think this kind of brilliantly described</p>
<p>system of hate being the main mechanism</p>
<p>of our electoral choices,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think that just has to do with mediocre candidates?</p>
<p>Basically the field of candidates, including Trump,</p>
<p>including everybody was just like,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t make anyone feel great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, really?</p>
<p>This is what we have to choose from?</p>
<p>Maybe a Mark Cuban,</p>
<p>or like a Mark Cuban is a Democrat,</p>
<p>or it would have to be somebody like that.</p>
<p>Somebody who, because here&rsquo;s the thing about Trump.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that it was Trump.</p>
<p>He was so fucking famous.</p>
<p>Like people don&rsquo;t realize he was so famous.</p>
<p>Like I, even when I first met Trump,</p>
<p>I met a couple of other presidents,</p>
<p>but when I met Trump, even I felt like kind of starstruck.</p>
<p>Cause I was like, yo, this is the guy from The Apprentice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is the dude.</p>
<p>From The Apprentice?</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m like, my dad and I used to sit</p>
<p>and watch The Apprentice when I was in high school.</p>
<p>And then one of the guys was from College Station</p>
<p>where I grew up and we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh my God, like that guy&rsquo;s on The Apprentice.</p>
<p>Like it was a phenomenon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like that level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like when I met Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, holy shit, that&rsquo;s Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel that way when I meet Mitt Romney,</p>
<p>or Tom Cotton, or Josh Hawley, I met all of them.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of celebrities, right?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s some celebrities</p>
<p>you were not even thinking about that could step in?</p>
<p>The Rock?</p>
<p>So I was about to say, I think The Rock could do it,</p>
<p>but does he wanna do it?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s terrible gig.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if The Rock necessarily has</p>
<p>like the formed policy agenda.</p>
<p>Cause then here&rsquo;s the other problem.</p>
<p>What if we set ourselves up for a system</p>
<p>where like these people keep winning,</p>
<p>but like with Trump, they have no idea</p>
<p>how to run a government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really hard, right?</p>
<p>And you have to have the knowhow and the trust</p>
<p>to find the right people.</p>
<p>This is where the genius element comes in is,</p>
<p>you have to understand that front</p>
<p>and you have to understand how to execute discrete tasks.</p>
<p>Like this is the FDR.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s so hard, like FDR, Lincoln, TR.</p>
<p>They were who they were and they live in history</p>
<p>and their name rings like for a reason.</p>
<p>And yeah, I mean, one of the most depressing lessons</p>
<p>I got from 2020 is at almost, it seems like in my opinion,</p>
<p>that we over learn the lesson of our success</p>
<p>and not of our failures.</p>
<p>For example, like we have this narrative in our head</p>
<p>that we always have the right person</p>
<p>at the right time during crisis.</p>
<p>And in some cases it was true.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t deserve Lincoln.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t deserve FDR.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t deserve a lot of presidents at times of crisis.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re like, okay, George W. Bush, 9 11,</p>
<p>that was terrible.</p>
<p>Reconstruction, Andrew Johnson, awful, right?</p>
<p>Like we had several periods in our history</p>
<p>where the crisis was there, they were called</p>
<p>and they did not show up.</p>
<p>And I really, it hadn&rsquo;t happened in my lifetime</p>
<p>except for 9 11.</p>
<p>And even then you could kind of see that as an opportunity</p>
<p>for somebody like Obama to come in and fix it.</p>
<p>But then he didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And then Trump didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And you realize, I feel like our politics are most analogous</p>
<p>to like the 1910s, like all in terms of the Gilded Age,</p>
<p>in terms of that, remember there&rsquo;s that long period</p>
<p>of presidents between like Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt.</p>
<p>We were like, wait, like who was president?</p>
<p>Like, or even TR was like an exception</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ll have like Calvin Coolidge who like,</p>
<p>silent cow, Grover Cleveland.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of how, if I think of us within history,</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re in one of those times.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just waiting.</p>
<p>It feels really important to us right now.</p>
<p>Like this is the most important moment in history,</p>
<p>but it might be.</p>
<p>It could just be a blip, right?</p>
<p>20, 30 year blip.</p>
<p>Like when you think about who was president</p>
<p>between 1890 and 19 before, I mean, yeah,</p>
<p>between like 1888 and 1910.</p>
<p>Like nobody really thinks about that period of America,</p>
<p>but like that was an entire lifetime for people, right?</p>
<p>Like what did they, how did they feel</p>
<p>about the country that they were in?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I kind of think about where we are right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to think.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to minimize it,</p>
<p>but like we haven&rsquo;t really gone</p>
<p>through a World War II style crisis.</p>
<p>So like, say that there is a crisis</p>
<p>in like several decades of that level, right?</p>
<p>Existential risks to a large portion of the world.</p>
<p>Then what will be remembered is World War II,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit about Vietnam</p>
<p>and then whatever that crisis is.</p>
<p>And this whole period that we see as dramatic,</p>
<p>even coronavirus.</p>
<p>Even 9 11.</p>
<p>Even 9 11, it&rsquo;s like, cause you can look</p>
<p>at how many people died and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>all the drama around the war on terror</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Maybe Obama will be remembered</p>
<p>for being the first African American president,</p>
<p>but then like that&rsquo;s, yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>to think about, oh man, even Trump will be like,</p>
<p>oh, okay, cool.</p>
<p>That guy.</p>
<p>Yeah, like maybe he&rsquo;d be remembered</p>
<p>as the first celebrity.</p>
<p>I mean, Reagan was already a governor, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so like the first apolitical celebrity that was,</p>
<p>so maybe if there&rsquo;s more celebrities in the future,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say that Trump was the first person</p>
<p>to pave the way for celebrities to win.</p>
<p>Oh man, yeah.</p>
<p>And yeah, I still hold that this era</p>
<p>will probably be remembered.</p>
<p>You know, people say I talk about Elon way too much,</p>
<p>but the reality is like, there&rsquo;s not many people</p>
<p>that are doing the kind of things he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>is why I talk about it.</p>
<p>I think this era, it&rsquo;s not necessarily Elon and SpaceX,</p>
<p>but this era will be remembered by the new,</p>
<p>the like of the space exploration,</p>
<p>of the commercial of companies getting</p>
<p>into space exploration of space travel.</p>
<p>And perhaps like artificial intelligence</p>
<p>around social media, all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>this might be remembered for that.</p>
<p>But every, all the political bickering,</p>
<p>all that nonsense, that might be very well forgotten.</p>
<p>One way to think about it is that the internet is so young.</p>
<p>I think about it, so Jeff Jarvis,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a media scholar I respect.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not the only person to say this,</p>
<p>but many others have, which is that, look,</p>
<p>this is kind of like the printing press.</p>
<p>There was a whole 30 years war</p>
<p>because of the printing press.</p>
<p>It took a long time for shit to sort out.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re at with the internet.</p>
<p>Like at a certain level, it disrupts everything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>It can be very tumultuous.</p>
<p>I never felt like I was living through history</p>
<p>until coronavirus.</p>
<p>Like, you know, like until we were all locked down,</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m living through history.</p>
<p>Like this, there&rsquo;s this very overused cliche in DC</p>
<p>where every comm staffer wants you to think</p>
<p>that what their boss just did is history.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always been like, this isn&rsquo;t history.</p>
<p>This is some like stupid fucking bill, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>But like, that was the first time I was like,</p>
<p>this is history, like this right here.</p>
<p>Well, I was hoping, tragedy aside,</p>
<p>that this, I wish the primaries happened during coronavirus</p>
<p>so that we, because like, then we can see the,</p>
<p>so, okay, here&rsquo;s a bunch of people facing crisis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an opportunity for a leader to step up.</p>
<p>Like, I still believe the optimistic view</p>
<p>is the game theory of like influencers</p>
<p>will always be defeated by actual great leaders.</p>
<p>So like, maybe the great leaders are rare,</p>
<p>but I think they&rsquo;re sufficiently out there</p>
<p>that they will step up, especially in moments of crisis.</p>
<p>And coronavirus is obviously a crisis</p>
<p>where like, you know, mass manufacture of tests,</p>
<p>all kinds of infrastructure building</p>
<p>that you could have done in 2020,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many possibilities for just like bold action.</p>
<p>And none of that, even just,</p>
<p>forget actually doing the action, advocating for it.</p>
<p>Just saying like this, we need to do this.</p>
<p>And none of that, like the speeches that Biden made,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember a single speech that Biden made</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s zero bold, I mean, their strategy</p>
<p>was to be quiet and let Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Polarize the electorate.</p>
<p>Polarize the electorate and hope that results</p>
<p>in them winning because of the high unemployment numbers</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>as opposed to like, let&rsquo;s go big,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go with a big speech.</p>
<p>Like, you know, that, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lost opportunity in some sense.</p>
<p>So we talked a bunch about politics,</p>
<p>but one of the other interesting things</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re involved with is,</p>
<p>or involved with defining the future of as journalism.</p>
<p>I suppose you can think of podcasts</p>
<p>as a kind of journalism,</p>
<p>but also just writing in general,</p>
<p>just whatever the hell the future of this thing looks like</p>
<p>is up to be defined by people like you.</p>
<p>So what do you think is broken about journalism</p>
<p>and what do you think is the future of journalism?</p>
<p>I think the future of journalism looks much more like</p>
<p>what we, you and I are doing here right now.</p>
<p>And journalism is gonna be downstream from a culture</p>
<p>that can be a good and a bad thing</p>
<p>depending on how you look at it.</p>
<p>We are gonna look at our media,</p>
<p>our media is gonna look much more like it did</p>
<p>pre mass media.</p>
<p>And the way that I mean that is that back in the 18,</p>
<p>in the 1800s in particular,</p>
<p>especially after the invention of the telegraph</p>
<p>when information itself was known.</p>
<p>So for example, like you and I don&rsquo;t need to,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you and I are competing journalists.</p>
<p>You and I are no longer competing quote unquote</p>
<p>to tell the public X event happened.</p>
<p>All journalism today is largely explaining</p>
<p>why did X happen.</p>
<p>And part of the problem with that is that</p>
<p>that means that it&rsquo;s all up for partisan interpretation.</p>
<p>Now you can say that that&rsquo;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great thing</p>
<p>because the highest level of literacy</p>
<p>and news viewership in America</p>
<p>was during the time of yellow journalism,</p>
<p>was during the time of partisan journalism.</p>
<p>Not a surprise.</p>
<p>People like to read the news from people</p>
<p>that they agree with.</p>
<p>You could say that&rsquo;s bad, echo chambers, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the downside of it.</p>
<p>The upside is more people are more educated.</p>
<p>More people are interested in the news.</p>
<p>So I think the proliferation of mass media,</p>
<p>I mean, sorry, of this format</p>
<p>of niching, of not just long form.</p>
<p>Dude, I do updates on Instagram, which are five minutes.</p>
<p>Are you considered like Instagram, almost even Twitter?</p>
<p>Oh, of course, Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter is where I get my news from.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t read the paper.</p>
<p>I have literally, Twitter is my news aggregator.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called my wire where I find out about hard events.</p>
<p>Like the president has departed the White House.</p>
<p>But not only that, I don&rsquo;t know about you,</p>
<p>but I also looked at Twitter</p>
<p>to the exact thing you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>which is the response to the news,</p>
<p>like the thoughtful sounds ridiculous,</p>
<p>but you can be pretty thoughtful in a single tweet.</p>
<p>If you follow the right people, you can get that.</p>
<p>And so that is the future of media,</p>
<p>which is that the future of media</p>
<p>is it will be much larger amounts of people,</p>
<p>which are famous to smaller groups.</p>
<p>So Walter Cronkite&rsquo;s never gonna happen again,</p>
<p>at least probably within our lifetimes,</p>
<p>where everybody in America knows who this guy is.</p>
<p>That age is over.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>because now people are gonna get the news</p>
<p>from the people that they trust.</p>
<p>Yes, some of it will be opinionated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in my program.</p>
<p>Crystal and I are like, she&rsquo;s coming from this view.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming from this view.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our bias when we talk about information</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna talk about the information</p>
<p>that we think is important.</p>
<p>And it has garnered a large audience.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very much where the future is gonna be.</p>
<p>And the reason why I think that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>is because people will be engaged more within it</p>
<p>rather than the current system</p>
<p>where news is highly concentrated, highly consolidated,</p>
<p>has group think,</p>
<p>has the same elite production pipeline problem</p>
<p>of everybody knows journalists all come</p>
<p>from the same socioeconomic background</p>
<p>and they all party together here in DC or in New York</p>
<p>or in LA or wherever,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re part of the same monoculture</p>
<p>and that affects what they report.</p>
<p>This will cause a total dispersion of all of that.</p>
<p>The battle of our age is gonna be the guild</p>
<p>versus the non guild.</p>
<p>So like what we see right now</p>
<p>with the New York Times and Clubhouse,</p>
<p>this is a very, very, very, very, very intentional thing</p>
<p>that is happening,</p>
<p>which is that the Times talking</p>
<p>about unfettered conversations,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening on Clubhouse for people who aren&rsquo;t aware.</p>
<p>This is important because they need</p>
<p>to be the fetters of conversation.</p>
<p>They need to be the inter agent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where they get their power.</p>
<p>They get their power from convincing Facebook</p>
<p>that they are the ones who can fact check stuff.</p>
<p>They are the ones who can tell you</p>
<p>whether something is right or wrong.</p>
<p>That battle over unimpeded conversation</p>
<p>and the explosion of a format</p>
<p>that you and I are doing really well in,</p>
<p>and then this more consolidated one,</p>
<p>which holds cultural power and elite power</p>
<p>and more importantly, money, right?</p>
<p>Over you and I, that&rsquo;s the battle</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all gonna play out.</p>
<p>Do you think unfettered conversations</p>
<p>have a chance to win this battle?</p>
<p>Yes, I do in the long run.</p>
<p>In the long run, the internet is simply too powerful.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the mistake everybody makes.</p>
<p>The New York Times will never lose.</p>
<p>It will just become one of us.</p>
<p>See.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>They already are.</p>
<p>They are the largest.</p>
<p>The daily?</p>
<p>The daily, look at the daily.</p>
<p>Not even that.</p>
<p>Think about it not in podcasting.</p>
<p>The Times is not a mass media product.</p>
<p>It is a subscription product</p>
<p>for upper middle class largely white liberals</p>
<p>who live the same circumstances</p>
<p>across the United States and in Europe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be the paper of record</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re actually the paper</p>
<p>of upper middle class white America.</p>
<p>Your job is to report on the news from that angle</p>
<p>and deliver them the product that they want.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Their stock price is higher than ever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making 10 times more money than they did</p>
<p>10 years ago, but it comes at the cost</p>
<p>of not having a mass application audience.</p>
<p>So like when people, I think people in our space</p>
<p>are always like, the New York Times is gonna be destroyed.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s actually even better.</p>
<p>They will just become one of us.</p>
<p>They already are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a subscription platform.</p>
<p>Well, yes, in terms of the actual mechanism.</p>
<p>But you know, New York Times is still,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m speaking about a particular sector.</p>
<p>I think it, as a brand, it does have the level</p>
<p>of credibility assigned to it still.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s politicization of it.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a credibility.</p>
<p>Like it has much more credibility than,</p>
<p>forgive me, than I think you and I have.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>In terms of your podcast, like people are not going</p>
<p>to be like, they&rsquo;re gonna say at the New York Times</p>
<p>versus what you said on the podcast for an opinion.</p>
<p>I wonder in the sense of battles,</p>
<p>whether on Federated Conversations, whether Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>whether your podcast can become the,</p>
<p>have the same level of legitimacy or the flip side,</p>
<p>New York Times loses legitimacy to be at the same level</p>
<p>of in terms of how we talk about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long battle, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take a long time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m saying, this is where I think the end state is going</p>
<p>and look at what the Times is doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re leaning into podcasting for a reason,</p>
<p>but not just podcasting as in NPR level,</p>
<p>like here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Michael Barbaro is a fucking celebrity, right?</p>
<p>The guy who does the daily.</p>
<p>That guy&rsquo;s famous amongst these people</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like, oh my God, I love Michael.</p>
<p>Like, I love the way he does this stuff.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>More people are listening to the news.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>And then who else do they hire?</p>
<p>Ezra Klein from Vox, Kara Swisher, also from Vox,</p>
<p>who does Pivot, which is an amazing podcast.</p>
<p>Or Jane Coaston, same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s personalities who are becoming bundled together</p>
<p>within this brand, right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s, okay, maybe I&rsquo;m just a hater.</p>
<p>Cause I love podcasting from the beginning.</p>
<p>I love Green Day before the recall, man.</p>
<p>But I am bothered by it.</p>
<p>Like why doesn&rsquo;t Kara Swisher, she&rsquo;s done successfully.</p>
<p>I think in her own, no, she was always a part</p>
<p>of some kind of institution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>But she started her own thing, I think.</p>
<p>It would.</p>
<p>Recode, right, yeah.</p>
<p>Recode, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s her own thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So she was very successful there.</p>
<p>Why the hell did she join the New York Times</p>
<p>with the new podcast?</p>
<p>Why is Michael Barbaro not do his own thing?</p>
<p>Cause he gets paid and because he has,</p>
<p>he wants the elite cache that you just referenced</p>
<p>within his social circle in New York,</p>
<p>which is that I think the biggest mistake</p>
<p>that some of the venture people make is</p>
<p>if we give everybody the tools</p>
<p>that those people are all gonna leave</p>
<p>to like go substack and go independent,</p>
<p>within their social circle,</p>
<p>sacrificing some money from being independent is worth it</p>
<p>to be a part of the New York Times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sad to me because it propagates old thinking,</p>
<p>like it propagates old institutions.</p>
<p>And you could say that New York Times</p>
<p>is going to evolve quickly and so on,</p>
<p>but I would love it if there was a mechanism</p>
<p>for reestablishing, like for building new New York Times</p>
<p>in terms of public legitimacy.</p>
<p>And I suppose that&rsquo;s a wishful thinking</p>
<p>cause it takes time to build trust in institutions</p>
<p>and it takes time to build new institutions.</p>
<p>My main thing I would say is public legitimacy</p>
<p>as a concept is not gonna be there in mass media anymore</p>
<p>because of the balkanization of audiences.</p>
<p>I mean, think about it, right?</p>
<p>Like this is like Lesion, the classic stuff</p>
<p>around a thousand true fans,</p>
<p>or no, sorry, like a hundred true fans even now.</p>
<p>Like you can make a living on the internet</p>
<p>just talking to a hundred people.</p>
<p>If as long as they&rsquo;re all high frequency traders,</p>
<p>some of the highest paid people on substack,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have that many subs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re Wall Street guys, right?</p>
<p>So people pay a lot of money.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So what you will have is an increasing balkanization</p>
<p>of the internet, of audiences and of niches.</p>
<p>People will become increasingly famous within us.</p>
<p>You will become astoundingly famous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve noticed this with your fan base.</p>
<p>I certainly have with mine.</p>
<p>Like 99% of people have no idea who I am,</p>
<p>but when somebody meets, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh my God, I watch your show every day, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the only thing I watch for news, right?</p>
<p>Like instead of casually famous, if that makes sense,</p>
<p>but like, oh yeah, it&rsquo;s like Alec Baldwin, you know?</p>
<p>Whoa, shit, that&rsquo;s Alec Baldwin.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not like, oh shit, I love you Alec Baldwin.</p>
<p>This is a Ben Smith of the New York Times,</p>
<p>actually he wrote this column.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, the future is everybody will be famous,</p>
<p>but only to a small group of people.</p>
<p>And I think that is true.</p>
<p>But again, I don&rsquo;t decry it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great because I think that the more</p>
<p>that that happens, the more engaged people will be</p>
<p>and it empowers different voices to be able to come in</p>
<p>and then possibly, I wouldn&rsquo;t say destroy,</p>
<p>but compete against.</p>
<p>I mean, look at Joe.</p>
<p>Joe is more powerful than CNN and MSNBC and Fox</p>
<p>all put together.</p>
<p>That gives me like immense inspiration.</p>
<p>Like he created the space for me to succeed.</p>
<p>And I told him that when I met him, I was like,</p>
<p>dude, like I listened to his podcast when I was like young.</p>
<p>And like, and I remember like when I got to meet him</p>
<p>and all that, and I told him this on this pod,</p>
<p>I was like, I didn&rsquo;t know people were millions</p>
<p>were willing to listen to a guy talk about chimps</p>
<p>for three straight hours, including me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that I could be one of those people.</p>
<p>Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>I learned something about myself from his show, yeah.</p>
<p>And so by creating that space, I&rsquo;d be like, wait,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hunger here.</p>
<p>Like he showed us all the way</p>
<p>and none of us will ever again be as famous as Rogan</p>
<p>because he was the first and that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>because he created the umbrella ecosystem</p>
<p>for us all to thrive.</p>
<p>That is where I see like a great amount of hope</p>
<p>within that story.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the cool thing, he also supports that ecosystem.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s such a. He&rsquo;s so generous.</p>
<p>One of the things he paved the way out for me</p>
<p>is to show that you can just be honest, publicly honest,</p>
<p>and not jealous of other people&rsquo;s success,</p>
<p>but instead be supportive and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>just like loving towards others.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been an inspiration.</p>
<p>I mean, to the comics community,</p>
<p>I think there are a bunch of, before that,</p>
<p>I think there were all a bunch of competitive haters</p>
<p>towards each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, and now he&rsquo;s like just injected love.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re still like many are still resistant,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re like, they can&rsquo;t help it</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s such a huge voice.</p>
<p>He like forces them to be like loving towards each other.</p>
<p>And the same, I tried to,</p>
<p>one of the reasons I wanted to start this podcast</p>
<p>was to try to, I wanted to be like do what Joe Rogan did,</p>
<p>but for the scientific community,</p>
<p>like my little circle of scientific community of like,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s support each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, like Avi Loeb,</p>
<p>I would have no idea who he was if it wasn&rsquo;t for you.</p>
<p>I mean, I assume you put him in touch with Joe.</p>
<p>He went on Joe&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p>I had him on my show.</p>
<p>Like millions of people would have no idea who he was</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t for you.</p>
<p>Just by the way, in terms of deep state</p>
<p>and shadow government, Avi Loeb has to do with aliens.</p>
<p>You better believe Joe.</p>
<p>Dude, the last thing I sent to him</p>
<p>was the American Airlines audio.</p>
<p>Did you see that?</p>
<p>The pilots who were, oh my God, dude, this is amazing.</p>
<p>So like, this American Airlines flight crew</p>
<p>was over New Mexico, this happened five or six days ago.</p>
<p>And the guy comes and he goes,</p>
<p>hey, do you have any targets up here?</p>
<p>A large cylindrical object just flew over me.</p>
<p>Okay, so this happens, so this happens.</p>
<p>Then a guy or like a radio catcher</p>
<p>records this and posts it online.</p>
<p>American Airlines confirms that this is authentic audio.</p>
<p>And they go, all further questions</p>
<p>should be referred to the FBI.</p>
<p>So then, okay, American Airlines just confirmed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a legitimate transmission.</p>
<p>FBI, then the FAA comes out and says,</p>
<p>we were tracking no objects in the vicinity of this plane</p>
<p>at the time of the transmission.</p>
<p>So the only plausible explanation that online sleuths</p>
<p>have been able to say is maybe he saw a Learjet,</p>
<p>which was, you know, using like open source data.</p>
<p>FAA rules that out.</p>
<p>So what was it?</p>
<p>He saw a large cylindrical object.</p>
<p>While he was mid flight, American Airlines,</p>
<p>but you can go online, listen to the audio yourself.</p>
<p>This is a 100% no shit transmission</p>
<p>confirmed by American Airlines of a commercial pilot</p>
<p>over New Mexico, seeing a quote unquote,</p>
<p>large cylindrical object in the air.</p>
<p>Like I said, when we first started talking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never believed more in UFOs and aliens.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is awesome.</p>
<p>I just wish both American Airlines, FBI,</p>
<p>and government would be more transparent.</p>
<p>Like there would be voices, and I know it sounds ridiculous,</p>
<p>but the kind of transparency that you see,</p>
<p>maybe not Joe Rogan, he&rsquo;s like overly transparent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a comic really, but just the, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like a podcast from the FBI, just like being honest,</p>
<p>like excited, confused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that they&rsquo;re being overly cautious</p>
<p>about their release information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of information</p>
<p>that would inspire the public,</p>
<p>that would inspire trust in institutions</p>
<p>that will not damage national security.</p>
<p>Like it seems to me obvious,</p>
<p>and the reason they&rsquo;re not sharing it</p>
<p>is because of this momentum of bureaucracy,</p>
<p>of caution and so on.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s probably so much cool information</p>
<p>that the government has.</p>
<p>The way I almost, I wouldn&rsquo;t say it confirmed it&rsquo;s real,</p>
<p>but Trump didn&rsquo;t declassify it.</p>
<p>Like you know that if there was ever a president</p>
<p>that actually wanted to get to the bottom of it, it was him.</p>
<p>I mean, he didn&rsquo;t declassify it, man.</p>
<p>And people begged him to.</p>
<p>I know for a fact,</p>
<p>because I pushed to try and make this happen,</p>
<p>that some people did speak to him about it.</p>
<p>And he was like, no, I&rsquo;m not gonna do it.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>He might be afraid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean, though.</p>
<p>They were probably all telling him,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, sir, you can&rsquo;t do this, you know, all this,</p>
<p>like, wow, and I get that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this legislation written at COVID</p>
<p>that like they have six months to release it, man.</p>
<p>Is that real?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Is that a bunch of bullshit?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many different levels of classification</p>
<p>that people need to understand.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I read John Podesta.</p>
<p>He was the chief of staff to Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a big UFO guy.</p>
<p>He tried.</p>
<p>Like him and Clinton tried to get some of this information</p>
<p>and they could not get any of it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking about the president</p>
<p>and the White House chief of staff.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a whole bureaucracy,</p>
<p>but just like you were saying, with intent.</p>
<p>You have to be like, that has to be your focus</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a whole bureaucracy built around secrecy</p>
<p>for probably for a good reason.</p>
<p>So to get through to the information,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole like paperwork process,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just walk in and get the,</p>
<p>unless again, with intention, that becomes your thing.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s revolutionize this thing.</p>
<p>And then you get only so many things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad that the bureaucracy has gotten so bulky,</p>
<p>but I think the hopeful messages</p>
<p>from earlier in our conversation,</p>
<p>it seems like a single person can&rsquo;t fix it,</p>
<p>but if you hire the right team, it feels like you can.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t fix everything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna give people unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>You can fix a lot, especially in crisis,</p>
<p>you can remake America.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the reason I know that</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s already happened twice.</p>
<p>FDR, or in modern history, FDR and JFK.</p>
<p>Sorry, FDR and JFK&rsquo;s assassination, LBJ.</p>
<p>Two hyper competent men who understood government,</p>
<p>who understood personnel,</p>
<p>and coincidentally were friends.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think actually people understand this.</p>
<p>FDR met Johnson three days after he won his election</p>
<p>to Congress, special election.</p>
<p>He was only 29 years old.</p>
<p>And he left that meeting and called somebody and said,</p>
<p>this young man is gonna be president</p>
<p>of the United States someday.</p>
<p>Like even then, like what was within him</p>
<p>to understand and to recognize that.</p>
<p>And sometimes Johnson, as a young member of Congress,</p>
<p>would come and have breakfast with FDR,</p>
<p>like just to the great political minds of the 20th century,</p>
<p>just sitting there talking.</p>
<p>Like I would give anything to know what was happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, I hope they were real with each other.</p>
<p>And there was like a genuine human connection, right?</p>
<p>That seems to be the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, Johnson wasn&rsquo;t a genuine guy,</p>
<p>so probably certainly not.</p>
<p>Well, I need to read those thousands of pages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been way too focused on Hitler.</p>
<p>I was gonna say, one of my goals in coming to this</p>
<p>is I was like, I gotta get Lex into two things,</p>
<p>because I know he&rsquo;ll love it.</p>
<p>I know he&rsquo;ll love LBJ,</p>
<p>if he takes the time to read the books.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the most&hellip;</p>
<p>Of all the presidents&hellip;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;ll love him,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll love the books about him.</p>
<p>Because the books are a story of America,</p>
<p>the story of politics, the story of power.</p>
<p>This is the guy who wrote the Power Broker.</p>
<p>These books are up there with</p>
<p>Decline and Follow the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon,</p>
<p>in terms of how power works.</p>
<p>Study of power.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s why Carroll wrote the books.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the books are not really about LBJ,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re about power in Washington,</p>
<p>and about the consolidation of power post New Deal,</p>
<p>the consolidation then,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re using the levers of power like Johnson knew</p>
<p>in order to change the House of Representatives,</p>
<p>the Senate of the United States,</p>
<p>and ultimately the presidency of the United States,</p>
<p>which ended in failure and disaster with Vietnam.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s overlooked for so many of the incredible things</p>
<p>that he did with civil rights.</p>
<p>Nobody else could have done it.</p>
<p>No one else could have gotten it done.</p>
<p>And the second thing is,</p>
<p>we gotta get you into World War I.</p>
<p>We gotta get you more into World War I,</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s a rabbit hole,</p>
<p>which I know you&rsquo;re a Dan Carlin fan.</p>
<p>So blueprint for Armageddon.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Guaranteed.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s fewer evil people there.</p>
<p>Yes, but&hellip;</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what actually&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a banality of that evil,</p>
<p>of the Kaiser and of the Austro Hungarians.</p>
<p>And of&hellip;</p>
<p>See, I like World War I more because it was unresolved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those periods I was talking to you about,</p>
<p>about sometimes you&rsquo;re called and you fail.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>I mean, 50 million people were killed</p>
<p>in the most horrific way.</p>
<p>People literally drowned in the mud,</p>
<p>like an entire generation.</p>
<p>One stat I love is that,</p>
<p>Britain didn&rsquo;t need a draft till 1916.</p>
<p>Like they went two years of throwing people</p>
<p>into barbed wire voluntarily.</p>
<p>And because people love their country</p>
<p>and they love the king,</p>
<p>and they thought they were going against the Kaiser.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like that conflict to me,</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t read enough about it.</p>
<p>Also just like births Russian Revolution, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>Hitler.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t talk about World War II without World War I.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m obsessed with the conflict.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read way too many books about it.</p>
<p>For this reason is, it&rsquo;s unresolved.</p>
<p>And like the roots of so much of even our current problems</p>
<p>are happened in Versailles, right?</p>
<p>Like Vietnam is because of the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>Many ways the Middle Eastern problems</p>
<p>and the division of the states there.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Versailles</p>
<p>in terms of the penalties against Germany.</p>
<p>But also they fall out from those wars</p>
<p>on the French and the German population,</p>
<p>or the French and the British populations</p>
<p>and their reluctance for war in 1939 or 1938.</p>
<p>When Neville Chamberlain goes, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s one of the things people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>is the actual appetite of the British public at that time.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want to go to war.</p>
<p>Only Churchill, he was the only one</p>
<p>in the gathering storm, right?</p>
<p>Like being like, hey, this is really bad and all of that.</p>
<p>And then even in the United States,</p>
<p>our streak of isolationism, which sweat.</p>
<p>I mean, things were because of that conflict.</p>
<p>We were convinced as a country</p>
<p>that we wanted nothing to do with Europe and its problems.</p>
<p>And in many ways that contributed</p>
<p>to the proliferation of Hitler and more.</p>
<p>So like I&rsquo;m obsessed with World War I for this reason,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s just like the root.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the culmination of the monarchies,</p>
<p>then the fall, and then just all the shit spills out</p>
<p>from there for like a hundred years.</p>
<p>So World War I is like the most important shift</p>
<p>in human history versus World War II</p>
<p>is like a consequence of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I have a degree in security studies</p>
<p>from Georgetown.</p>
<p>And one of the thing is that we would focus a lot on that</p>
<p>is like war and, but also like the complexity around war.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>We never spent that much time on World War II</p>
<p>because it was actually quite of a clean war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very atypical war as in the war object,</p>
<p>which we learned from World War I</p>
<p>is we must inflict suffering on the German people</p>
<p>and invade the borders of Germany and destroy Hitler.</p>
<p>Like the center of gravity is the Nazi regime and Hitler.</p>
<p>So it had a very basic begin and end.</p>
<p>Begin, liberate France, invade Germany,</p>
<p>destroy Hitler, reoccupy, rebuild.</p>
<p>World War I, what are you fighting for?</p>
<p>Like, are you, I mean, and nobody even knew.</p>
<p>You can go to the German general staff.</p>
<p>They were like, even in 1917, they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>the war was worth it because now we have Luxembourg.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, really?</p>
<p>Like you killed 2 million of your citizens</p>
<p>for fucking Luxembourg and like half of Belgium,</p>
<p>which is now like a pond.</p>
<p>And same thing, the French are like,</p>
<p>well, the French more so they&rsquo;re defending their borders,</p>
<p>but like, what are the British fighting for?</p>
<p>Why did hundreds of thousands of British people die?</p>
<p>In order to preserve the balance of power in Europe</p>
<p>and prevent the Kaiser from having a port</p>
<p>on the English Channel?</p>
<p>Like really, that&rsquo;s why?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more what wars are is they become these like</p>
<p>atypical, they become these protracted conflicts</p>
<p>with a necessary diplomatic resolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clean, it&rsquo;s very dirty.</p>
<p>It usually leads in the outbreak of another war</p>
<p>and another war and another war</p>
<p>and a slow burn of ethnic conflict, which bubbles up.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I look at that one even,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more typical of warfare and how it works.</p>
<p>Exactly, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making me realize that World War II</p>
<p>is one of the rare wars where you can make a strong case</p>
<p>for it&rsquo;s a fight of good versus evil.</p>
<p>Yeah, just war theory, obviously.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, they&rsquo;re literally slaughtering Jews.</p>
<p>Like, we have to kill them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one person doing it.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s one person at the core.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s short and there&rsquo;s a clear aggression.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that Dan Carlin</p>
<p>has been avoiding Hitler as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, probably for this reason.</p>
<p>Probably for this reason.</p>
<p>I mean, but it&rsquo;s complicated too,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a pressure.</p>
<p>That guy has his demons.</p>
<p>I love Dan so much.</p>
<p>So this is the, I don&rsquo;t know if you feel this pressure,</p>
<p>but as a creative, he feels the pressure</p>
<p>of being maybe not necessarily correct,</p>
<p>but maybe correct in the sense that his understanding,</p>
<p>he gets to the bottom of why something happened,</p>
<p>of why something happened, of what really happened.</p>
<p>Get to the bottom of it</p>
<p>before he can say something publicly about it.</p>
<p>And he is tortured by that burden.</p>
<p>I know, you know, he takes so much shit</p>
<p>from the historical community for no reason.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s the greatest popularizer, quote unquote,</p>
<p>of history.</p>
<p>And I wish more people in history understood it that way.</p>
<p>He was an inspiration to me.</p>
<p>I mean, I do some videos sometimes on my Instagram now</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ll do like a book tour.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be like, here&rsquo;s my bookshelf of these presidents.</p>
<p>And like, here&rsquo;s what I learned from this book</p>
<p>and this book and this.</p>
<p>And that was very much like a skill I learned from him</p>
<p>of being like, you know, as a historian writes.</p>
<p>You know, I just love the way he talks.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, in the mud.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, he&rsquo;ll be like, quote, quote.</p>
<p>I just, I love, he inspires me, man.</p>
<p>He really does to like learn more.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve read, I bought a lot of books because of Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll be, you know, because of this guy,</p>
<p>because of that guy, in terms of, you know,</p>
<p>another thing he does, which nobody else,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m probably guilty of this,</p>
<p>he focuses on the actual people involved.</p>
<p>Like he would tell the story of actual British soldiers</p>
<p>in World War I.</p>
<p>And I probably, and maybe you&rsquo;re guilty of this too,</p>
<p>we over focus on what was happening</p>
<p>in the German general staff,</p>
<p>what was happening in the British general staff.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t make that mistake.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he tells real history.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it gives it a feeling.</p>
<p>The result is that there&rsquo;s a feeling,</p>
<p>you get the feeling of what it was like to be there.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re becoming,</p>
<p>quickly becoming more and more popular.</p>
<p>Speaking about political issues in part,</p>
<p>do you feel a burden, like almost like</p>
<p>the prison of your prior convictions</p>
<p>of having to, being popular with a certain kind of audience</p>
<p>and thereby unable to really think outside the box?</p>
<p>I had, I&rsquo;ve really struggled with this.</p>
<p>I came up in right wing media.</p>
<p>I came up a much more doctrinaire conservative</p>
<p>in my professional life.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t always conservative.</p>
<p>We can get to that later if you want.</p>
<p>And I did feel an immense pressure after the election</p>
<p>by people to say, wanted me to say the election was stolen.</p>
<p>And I knew that I had a sizable part of my audience.</p>
<p>Oh, well, here&rsquo;s the benefit.</p>
<p>Most people know me from Rising,</p>
<p>which is with Crystal and me.</p>
<p>That is inherently a left right program.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a large audience.</p>
<p>So I felt comfortable and I knew that I could still be fine</p>
<p>in terms of my numbers, whatever,</p>
<p>because a lot, many people knew me who were on the left.</p>
<p>And if really, you know,</p>
<p>my right listeners abandoned me, so be it.</p>
<p>I was, had the luxury of able to take that choice,</p>
<p>but I still felt an immense amount of pressure</p>
<p>to say the election was stolen,</p>
<p>to give credence to a lot of the stuff that Trump was doing,</p>
<p>to downplay January 6th,</p>
<p>to downplay many of the Republican senators</p>
<p>or justify many of the Republican senators,</p>
<p>some of whom I know who objected</p>
<p>to the electoral college certification</p>
<p>and who stoked some of the flames</p>
<p>that have eaten the Republican base.</p>
<p>And I just wouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And that was hard, man.</p>
<p>Like I feel more politically homeless right now</p>
<p>than I ever have,</p>
<p>but I have realized in the last couple of months</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s freedom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true freedom.</p>
<p>I now, I say exactly what I think.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that I wasn&rsquo;t doing that before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s maybe I would avoid certain topics</p>
<p>or like I would think about things</p>
<p>more from a team perspective of like,</p>
<p>am I making sure that, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I didn&rsquo;t fight it.</p>
<p>And I still, I criticize the right plenty</p>
<p>and Trump plenty before the election and more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more just like,</p>
<p>I no longer feel as if I even have the illusion</p>
<p>of a stake within the game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I only look at myself as an outside observer</p>
<p>and I will only call it as I see it truly.</p>
<p>And I was aspiring to that before,</p>
<p>but I had to have, in a way,</p>
<p>Trump stop the steal thing.</p>
<p>It like took my shackles off 100%.</p>
<p>Cause I was like, no, this is bullshit.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to say it&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s bad for the Republican party.</p>
<p>And if people in the Republican party</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t agree with me on that, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not going to be necessarily like</p>
<p>associated with you anymore.</p>
<p>This is probably one of the first political</p>
<p>liberal politics related conversations we&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>I mean, unless you count Michael Malice, who.</p>
<p>He was great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the funny guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not so much political as he is like burning down, man.</p>
<p>He leans too far in anarchy for me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a place for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost, well, first of all,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s working on a new book, which I really appreciate.</p>
<p>Outside of the, he&rsquo;s working on like a big book</p>
<p>for a while, which is White Pill.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also working on this like short little thing,</p>
<p>which is like anarchist handbook or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Anarchy for Idiots or something like that,</p>
<p>which I think is really.</p>
<p>Well, me being an idiot and being curious</p>
<p>about anarchy seems useful.</p>
<p>So I like those kinds of books.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Russian heritage, man.</p>
<p>Anarchist 101.</p>
<p>I find those kinds of things a useful thought experiment</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s frustrating to me</p>
<p>when people talk about communism, socialism,</p>
<p>or even capitalism,</p>
<p>where they can&rsquo;t enjoy the thought experiment</p>
<p>of like why did communism fail</p>
<p>and maybe ask the question of like,</p>
<p>is it possible to make communism succeed</p>
<p>or are there good ideas in communism?</p>
<p>Like I enjoy the thought experiment,</p>
<p>like the discourse of it,</p>
<p>like the reasoning and like devil&rsquo;s advocate and all that.</p>
<p>People have like, seem to not have patience for that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, communism bad, red.</p>
<p>I was obsessed with the question and still am.</p>
<p>I will never be,</p>
<p>I will never quench my thirst for Russian history.</p>
<p>I love that period of 1890 to 1925.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s so fucking crazy.</p>
<p>Like the autocracy embodied in Czar Alexander.</p>
<p>And then you get this like weird fail son, Nicholas,</p>
<p>who is kind of a good guy, but also terrible.</p>
<p>And also Russian autocracy itself is terrible.</p>
<p>And then I just became obsessed with the question of like,</p>
<p>why did the Bolshevik revolution succeed?</p>
<p>Because like people in Russia</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t necessarily want Bolshevism.</p>
<p>People suffered a lot under Bolshevism</p>
<p>and it led to Stalinism.</p>
<p>How did Vladimir Lenin do it, right?</p>
<p>Like, and I became obsessed with that question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still, I find it so interesting,</p>
<p>which is that series of accidents of history,</p>
<p>incredible boldness by Lenin,</p>
<p>incredible real politic, smart,</p>
<p>unpopular decisions made by Trotsky and Stalin,</p>
<p>and just like the arrogance of the Czars</p>
<p>and of the Russian like autocracy.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these like cultural implications of this, right?</p>
<p>In terms of like how it became hollowed out</p>
<p>post Catherine the Great and all that.</p>
<p>I was obsessed with autocracy</p>
<p>because Russia wasn&rsquo;t actual autocracy.</p>
<p>And like actually, and I&rsquo;m like, it was there.</p>
<p>Like they didn&rsquo;t even remove serfdom</p>
<p>to like the civil war in America.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Like, you know, and nobody really talks about it.</p>
<p>And I just became, yeah, I was like,</p>
<p>was Bolshevism a natural reaction</p>
<p>to the excesses of Czarism?</p>
<p>There is a convenient explanation where that is true.</p>
<p>But there were also a series of decisions</p>
<p>made by Lenin and Stalin</p>
<p>to kill many of the people in the center left</p>
<p>and marginalized them</p>
<p>and also not to associate with the more</p>
<p>quote unquote, like amenable communists</p>
<p>in order to make sure that their pure strain of Bolshevism</p>
<p>was the only thing.</p>
<p>And the reason I like that is because it comes back</p>
<p>to a point I made earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about intentionality,</p>
<p>which is that you actually can will something into existence</p>
<p>even if people don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>That was the craziest thing.</p>
<p>Like nobody wanted this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still ruled for half a century, more actually.</p>
<p>I mean, almost 75 years.</p>
<p>To think that there could have been a history</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union that was dramatically different</p>
<p>than Leninism, Stalinism, that was completely different.</p>
<p>Like almost would be the American story.</p>
<p>Yeah, easily.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a world where,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have all the characters,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like Kerensky and then there was like</p>
<p>whoever Lenin&rsquo;s number two, Stalin&rsquo;s chief rival.</p>
<p>And even, I mean, look, even a Soviet Union led by Trotsky,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole other world, right?</p>
<p>Like literally a whole other world.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I find it so interesting.</p>
<p>I will never not be fascinated by Russia.</p>
<p>I always will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that I get to talk to you.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like, I read this book.</p>
<p>I forget what it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>It won, I think it won a Pulitzer prize.</p>
<p>And it was like the story of,</p>
<p>I tried to understand Russia post Crimea.</p>
<p>Cause I came up amongst people</p>
<p>who are much more like neoconservative</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, fuck Russia, Russia bad.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, like what do these people think?</p>
<p>And we have this narrative</p>
<p>of like the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And then I read this book from the perspective of Russians</p>
<p>who lived through the fall.</p>
<p>And they were like, this is, I was like, this is terrible.</p>
<p>Like actually the introduction of capitalism was awful.</p>
<p>And like the rise of all these crazy oligarchs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Putin was, came to power to like restore,</p>
<p>restore order to the oligarchy.</p>
<p>And he still talks to this day.</p>
<p>Do you guys, I mean, that&rsquo;s always the threat of like,</p>
<p>do you want to return to the nineties?</p>
<p>Do you want to return to Yeltsin?</p>
<p>But the thing is in the West,</p>
<p>we have this like our own propaganda of like,</p>
<p>no, Yeltsin was great.</p>
<p>That was the golden age.</p>
<p>What could have been with Russia?</p>
<p>And I was like, well, what do actual Russians think?</p>
<p>And so that, yeah, I&rsquo;ll always be fascinated by it.</p>
<p>And then just like to understand the idea</p>
<p>of feeling encircled by NATO and all of that,</p>
<p>you have to understand like Russian defense theory</p>
<p>all the way of going back to the czars</p>
<p>has always been defense in depth</p>
<p>in terms of having Estonia, Lithuania,</p>
<p>and more as like protection of the heartland.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not justifying in this.</p>
<p>So NATO shills like, please don&rsquo;t come after me.</p>
<p>But look, Estonians like NATO.</p>
<p>They want to be in NATO.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to minimize that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more just saying like,</p>
<p>I understand him and Russia much better having done that.</p>
<p>And we are very incapable in America.</p>
<p>I think this is probably because my parents are immigrants</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve traveled a lot.</p>
<p>Of like putting yourself in the mind of people</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t Western and haven&rsquo;t lived a history,</p>
<p>especially our lives of America&rsquo;s fucking awesome.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the number one country in the world.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re literally better than you, like in many ways.</p>
<p>And they can&rsquo;t empathize with people</p>
<p>who have suffered so much.</p>
<p>And I just, yeah, it&rsquo;s just so interesting to me.</p>
<p>What about if we could talk for just a brief moment</p>
<p>about the human of Putin and power, you are clearly</p>
<p>fascinated by power.</p>
<p>Do you think power changed Putin?</p>
<p>Do you think power changes leaders?</p>
<p>If you look at the great leaders in history,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s LBJ, FDR, do you think power really</p>
<p>changes people?</p>
<p>Like, is there a truth to that kind of old proverb?</p>
<p>It reveals, I think that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>It reveals.</p>
<p>So Putin was a much more deft politician,</p>
<p>much more amenable to the West.</p>
<p>If you think back, you know, to 2001 and more,</p>
<p>right when he came, cause he was still,</p>
<p>cause at that time his biggest problem</p>
<p>was intra Russian politics, right?</p>
<p>Like it was all consolidating power within the oligarchy.</p>
<p>Once he did that by around like 2007,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that famous time when he spoke out against the West</p>
<p>at the Munich security conference.</p>
<p>I forget when it was.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when everybody in the audience was like, whoa.</p>
<p>And he was talking about like NATO encirclement</p>
<p>and like, we will not be beaten back by the West.</p>
<p>Very shortly afterwards, like the Georgia invasion happens.</p>
<p>And that was like a big wake up call of like,</p>
<p>we will not be pushed around anymore.</p>
<p>I mean, he said before publicly, like the worst thing</p>
<p>that ever happened was the fall.</p>
<p>Or what did he say?</p>
<p>He was like, the fall of the Soviet Union was a tragedy,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Of course, people in the West were like, what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I get it, right?</p>
<p>Like they were a superpower.</p>
<p>And now their population is declining.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like a Petro state.</p>
<p>It sucks.</p>
<p>Like, I understand.</p>
<p>I understand like how somebody could feel about that.</p>
<p>I think it revealed his character,</p>
<p>which is that I think he thinks of himself probably</p>
<p>as he always has since 2001 as like this benevolent,</p>
<p>almost as a benevolent dictator.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, without me, the whole system would collapse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the only guy keeping all these people in check.</p>
<p>Most Russians probably do support Putin</p>
<p>because they feel like they support some form</p>
<p>of functional government.</p>
<p>And they view it as like a check against that,</p>
<p>which is a long, has a long history within Russia too.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if it changed him.</p>
<p>I think it just revealed him because it&rsquo;s not like he,</p>
<p>I mean, he has a bill.</p>
<p>You know, Navalny has put that like billion dollar palace</p>
<p>and all that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like Putin does that for show.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t seem like somebody who indulges</p>
<p>in all that stuff.</p>
<p>Or maybe we just don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s very difficult for me to understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hanging out, thanks to Clubhouse.</p>
<p>A lot of, I&rsquo;ve gotten to learn a lot about the Navalny folks</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been very educational.</p>
<p>Made me ask a lot of important questions about what,</p>
<p>you know, question a lot of my assumptions</p>
<p>about what I do and don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll just say that I do believe, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of the Navalny folks say</p>
<p>that Putin is incompetent and is a bad executive,</p>
<p>like is bad at basically running government.</p>
<p>But to me.</p>
<p>Well, why do Russians not think that?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Well, they probably say propaganda.</p>
<p>They would say it&rsquo;s the press.</p>
<p>Yeah, they would say the control.</p>
<p>There is a strong either control or pressure on the press,</p>
<p>but I think there is a legitimate support and love</p>
<p>of Putin in Russia that is not grounded</p>
<p>in just misinformation and propaganda.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s legitimacy there.</p>
<p>Mostly I tried to remain apolitical</p>
<p>and actually genuinely remain apolitical.</p>
<p>I am legitimately not interested</p>
<p>in the politics of Russia of today.</p>
<p>I feel I have some responsibility</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll take that responsibility on as I need to.</p>
<p>But my fascination as it is perhaps with you</p>
<p>in part is in the historical figure of Putin.</p>
<p>I know he&rsquo;s currently president,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m almost looking like as if I was a kid</p>
<p>in 30 years from now reading about him,</p>
<p>studying the human being,</p>
<p>the games of power that are played</p>
<p>that got him to gain power, to maintain power,</p>
<p>what that says about his human nature,</p>
<p>the nature of the bureaucracy that&rsquo;s around him,</p>
<p>the nature of Russia, the people, all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>as opposed to the politics and the manipulation</p>
<p>and the corruption and the control of the media</p>
<p>that results in misinformation.</p>
<p>Those are the bickering of the day,</p>
<p>just like we were saying,</p>
<p>what will actually be remembered</p>
<p>about this moment in history?</p>
<p>Totally, he&rsquo;s a transformational figure in Russian history.</p>
<p>Really, like the bridge between the fall of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and the chaos of Yeltsin,</p>
<p>that will be how he&rsquo;s remembered.</p>
<p>The only question is what comes next</p>
<p>and what he wants to come next.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always, I&rsquo;m like, he&rsquo;s getting up.</p>
<p>How old are you, 60 something?</p>
<p>Yeah, 60.</p>
<p>So he would be, I think he would be 80.</p>
<p>So with the change of the constitution,</p>
<p>he cannot be president until 2034, I think it is.</p>
<p>So he would be like 80 something</p>
<p>and he would be in power for over 30 years,</p>
<p>which is longer than Stalin.</p>
<p>But he still seems to be.</p>
<p>Seems fit.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s gonna be around for a long time.</p>
<p>But this is a fascinating question that you ask,</p>
<p>which is like, what does he want?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, and this is where I think,</p>
<p>given all of his behavior and more,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s about money.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s about enriching himself.</p>
<p>Obviously he did, to the tune of billions and billions</p>
<p>and billions of dollars.</p>
<p>But I think he probably,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s as close to like an actual Russian nationalist,</p>
<p>like at the top, who really does believe in Russia</p>
<p>as its rightful superpower.</p>
<p>Everything he does seems to stem from that opposition</p>
<p>to NATO, intro to Syria,</p>
<p>like wanting to play a large role in affairs,</p>
<p>deeply distrustful and yet coveting of the European powers.</p>
<p>Like, I could describe every czar in those same language.</p>
<p>Like every czar falls into the exact same category.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I mean, it makes me wonder,</p>
<p>looking at some of the biggest leaders in human history,</p>
<p>to ask the question of what was the motivation?</p>
<p>What was the motivation for even just the revolutionaries</p>
<p>like Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin?</p>
<p>What was the motivation?</p>
<p>Because it sure as hell seems like the motivation</p>
<p>was at least in part driven by the idea,</p>
<p>by ideas, not self interest of like power.</p>
<p>For Lenin, it was, I think he was a true believer</p>
<p>and an actual narcissist</p>
<p>who thought he was the only one who could do it.</p>
<p>Stalin, I do think just wanted power.</p>
<p>And realized, well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Look, he wrote very passionately when he was young.</p>
<p>And he was, he really believed in communism.</p>
<p>In the beginning he did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always fascinated as I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>around 1920, what happened, right?</p>
<p>Post revolution, you crushed the whites.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s all about consolidation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the games really began.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t think that was about communism.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe it became a useful propaganda tool,</p>
<p>but it still seemed like he believed in it.</p>
<p>Whether it was, of course, this is the question.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the problem with conspiracy theories for me.</p>
<p>And this is legitimate criticism towards me</p>
<p>about conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>which is just because you&rsquo;re not like this</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean others aren&rsquo;t like this.</p>
<p>So like, I can&rsquo;t believe that somebody be</p>
<p>like deeply two faced.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ve met them, you&rsquo;re welcome to Washington.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But like, I think that I would be able to detect like, no.</p>
<p>Well, this, my question is, well, so there&rsquo;s differences.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two face, like there&rsquo;s different levels of two face.</p>
<p>Like what I mean is to be killing people</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like house of cards style, right?</p>
<p>And still present a front like you&rsquo;re not killing people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if, I guess it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t see that at scale.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot of people like that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, I have trouble imagining</p>
<p>some, that&rsquo;s such a compelling narrative</p>
<p>that people like to say.</p>
<p>Like people, that&rsquo;s the conspiratorial mindset.</p>
<p>I think that skepticism was really powerful</p>
<p>and important to have because it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>A lot of powerful people abuse their power,</p>
<p>but saying that about, I feel like people over assume that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I see that with use of steroids often in sports.</p>
<p>People seem to make that claim about like everybody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s successful and I want to be very, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Something about me wants to be cautious</p>
<p>because I want to give people a chance.</p>
<p>Being purely cynical isn&rsquo;t helpful.</p>
<p>People say this about me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s only saying this to do this.</p>
<p>But at the same time, being naively optimistic</p>
<p>about everything is also a kind of pedophilic scheme.</p>
<p>People are going to fuck you over.</p>
<p>And more importantly, that doesn&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>More importantly, you&rsquo;re not going to be able to reason</p>
<p>about how to create systems that are going to be robust</p>
<p>to corruption, to malevolent parties.</p>
<p>So in order to create, you have to have a healthy balance</p>
<p>of both, I suppose, especially if you want to actually</p>
<p>engineer things that work in this world that has evil in it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a book of Hitler on the desk.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned a lot of books throughout this conversation.</p>
<p>I wonder, and this makes me really curious to explore</p>
<p>in a lot of depth the kind of books</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>I think you mentioned in your show</p>
<p>that you provide recommendations.</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>In the form of spoken word,</p>
<p>can you beyond what we&rsquo;ve already recommended</p>
<p>mention books, whether it is historical, nonfiction,</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s more like philosophical or even fiction</p>
<p>that had a big impact on your life?</p>
<p>Is there a few that you can mention?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I already talked about the Johnson books,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll leave that alone.</p>
<p>Robert A. Caro, he&rsquo;s still alive, thank God.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s finishing the last book.</p>
<p>I hope he makes it.</p>
<p>So those Johnson books.</p>
<p>Second, can I ask you a question about those books?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What the hell do you fit into so many pages?</p>
<p>Everything, man.</p>
<p>Let me tell you this.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just give you an anecdote.</p>
<p>This is why I love these books.</p>
<p>The beginning, the first book is about Lyndon Johnson.</p>
<p>His life, when he gets elected to Congress,</p>
<p>the book begins with a history of Texas</p>
<p>and its weather patterns,</p>
<p>and then of his great, great grandfather moving to Texas.</p>
<p>Then the story of that, about a hundred or so pages in,</p>
<p>you get to Lyndon Johnson.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you do it.</p>
<p>Which is you get.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a Tolstoy style retelling.</p>
<p>This is the thing, it&rsquo;s not a biography,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a story of the times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great biography.</p>
<p>So another one, this isn&rsquo;t part of my list,</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>is Grant, Ron Chernow.</p>
<p>Ron Chernow&rsquo;s Grant, it&rsquo;s a thousand pages.</p>
<p>And the reason I tell everybody to read it</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not just the story of Grant,</p>
<p>it is the story of pre civil war America,</p>
<p>the Mexican American war, the civil war and reconstruction,</p>
<p>all told in the life of one person</p>
<p>who was involved in all three.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about the Mexican American war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t know anything about reconstruction.</p>
<p>Now more so because people are talking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hot topic now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading about it for years.</p>
<p>That is another thing people need to learn a lot more about.</p>
<p>In terms of non history books,</p>
<p>the book that probably had the most impact on me,</p>
<p>which is also a historical nonfiction</p>
<p>is I am obsessed with Antarctic exploration.</p>
<p>And it all began with a book</p>
<p>called Shackleton&rsquo;s Incredible Journey,</p>
<p>which is the collection of diaries</p>
<p>of everybody who was on Shackleton&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Shackleton was the last explorer</p>
<p>of the heroic age of Antarctic exploration.</p>
<p>He led a ship called the Endurance,</p>
<p>which froze in the ice off the coast of Antarctica in 1914.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t have radios over the last exploration,</p>
<p>the last one without the age of radio.</p>
<p>And he happens to freeze in the ice.</p>
<p>And then the ship collapses after a year frozen in the ice.</p>
<p>And this man leads his entire crew from that ship</p>
<p>onto the ice with a team of dogs,</p>
<p>survives out on the ice for another year</p>
<p>with three little lifeboats</p>
<p>and is able to get all of his men,</p>
<p>every single one of them alive to an island</p>
<p>hundreds of miles away called Elephant Island.</p>
<p>And when they got there,</p>
<p>he had to leave everybody behind except for six people.</p>
<p>And him and two other guys, I&rsquo;m forgetting their names,</p>
<p>navigated by the stars 800 miles through the Drake Passage</p>
<p>with seas of hundreds of feet to Prince,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called Prince George&rsquo;s Island.</p>
<p>And then when they got to Prince George&rsquo;s Island,</p>
<p>they landed on the wrong side</p>
<p>and they had to hike from one side to the other</p>
<p>to go and meet the whalers.</p>
<p>And every single one of those things</p>
<p>was supposed to be impossible.</p>
<p>Nobody was ever supposed to hike that island.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t done again until like the 1980s</p>
<p>with professional equipment.</p>
<p>He did it after two years of starvation.</p>
<p>Nobody was ever supposed to make it</p>
<p>from Elephant Island to Prince George.</p>
<p>The guy, they had to hold him steady, his legs,</p>
<p>so that he could chart the stars.</p>
<p>And if they miss this island, they&rsquo;re into open sea.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>And then before that,</p>
<p>how do you survive for a year on the ice?</p>
<p>On seals.</p>
<p>And before that, he kept his crew from depression</p>
<p>frozen one year in the ice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an amazing story.</p>
<p>And it made me obsessed with Antarctic exploration.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve read like 15 books on it.</p>
<p>What the hell is it about the human spirit?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing about Antarctica</p>
<p>is it brings it out of you.</p>
<p>So for example, I read another one recently</p>
<p>called Mawson&rsquo;s Will.</p>
<p>Douglas Mawson, he was an Australian.</p>
<p>He was on one of the first Robert Frost expeditions.</p>
<p>He leads an expedition down to the South.</p>
<p>Him and a partner, they&rsquo;re leading explorations,</p>
<p>1908, something like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going around Antarctica with dog teams.</p>
<p>And what happens is they keep going over these snow bridges</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a crevice, but it&rsquo;s covered in snow.</p>
<p>And so one of the lead driver,</p>
<p>the dogs go over and they plummet.</p>
<p>And that sled takes with it.</p>
<p>So the guy survives, but that sled takes all their food,</p>
<p>half the dogs, their stove, the camping tent,</p>
<p>the tent specifically designed for the snow, everything.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re hundreds of miles away from base camp.</p>
<p>He and this guy have to make it back there</p>
<p>in time before the ship comes to come get them</p>
<p>on an agreed upon date.</p>
<p>And he makes it.</p>
<p>But the guy he was with, he dies.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a crazy story.</p>
<p>First of all, they have to eat the dogs.</p>
<p>A really creepy part of Antarctic exploration</p>
<p>is everyone ends up eating dogs at different points.</p>
<p>And part of the theory, which is so crazy,</p>
<p>is that the guy he was with was dying</p>
<p>because they were eating dog liver.</p>
<p>And dog liver has a lot of vitamin E,</p>
<p>which if you eat too much of it,</p>
<p>can give you like a poisoning.</p>
<p>And so Mawson, by trying to help his friend,</p>
<p>was giving him more liver.</p>
<p>Of all the things that kills you.</p>
<p>I know, it&rsquo;s dog liver.</p>
<p>And so his friend ends up dying,</p>
<p>have a horrific heart attack, all of that.</p>
<p>Mawson crawls back hundreds of miles away,</p>
<p>makes it back to base camp hours after the ship leaves.</p>
<p>And two guys or a couple of guys stayed behind for him.</p>
<p>And he basically has to recuperate for like six months</p>
<p>before he can even walk again.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like you were saying about the human spirit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Antarctica brings that out of people.</p>
<p>Or Amundsen, the guy who made it to the South Pole,</p>
<p>Robert Amundsen, oh my God.</p>
<p>Like this guy trained his whole life in the ice</p>
<p>from Norway to make it to the South Pole.</p>
<p>And he beat Robert Frost, the British guy</p>
<p>with all this money and all these,</p>
<p>I could go on this forever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obsessed with it.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I&rsquo;m gonna take this part of the podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna set it to music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna listen to it.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;ve been whining and bitching</p>
<p>about running 48 miles of Goggins this next weekend.</p>
<p>And this is gonna be so easy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna listen to this over and over in my head.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be.</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s obsessed with Shackleton.</p>
<p>He talks about him all the time.</p>
<p>He uses, I was gonna ask you about that.</p>
<p>He uses an example of that as an example</p>
<p>of what Mars colonization would be like.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>No, Antarctica is as close to you can simulate that.</p>
<p>Antarctica is as close to what you could simulate</p>
<p>what it would get.</p>
<p>That Nat Geo series on Mars, I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>if you watched it, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s actually in it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, they get there, everything goes wrong.</p>
<p>Somebody dies, like it&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t find any water.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>So what is it?</p>
<p>Is it like simulating the experience</p>
<p>of what it&rsquo;d be like to colonize?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a docu series where the fictionalized part</p>
<p>is the like astronauts on Mars,</p>
<p>but then they&rsquo;re interviewing people like Elon Musk</p>
<p>and others who were the ones who like paved the way</p>
<p>to get to Mars.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really interesting concept.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s on Netflix.</p>
<p>And yeah, I agree with him 100%,</p>
<p>which is that the first guys to make,</p>
<p>like for example, Robert Frost, who went to Australia,</p>
<p>sorry, to Antarctica, the British explorer</p>
<p>who was beaten to the South Pole three weeks</p>
<p>by Robert Amundsen, he died on the way back.</p>
<p>And the reason why is because he wasn&rsquo;t well prepared.</p>
<p>He was arrogant.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have the proper amounts of supplies.</p>
<p>His team had terrible morale.</p>
<p>Antarctica is a brutal place.</p>
<p>If you fuck up one time, you die.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, and this is what you read a lot about,</p>
<p>which is the reason why such heroic characters</p>
<p>like Shackleton Shine is a lot of people died.</p>
<p>Like there were some people who got frozen in the eye.</p>
<p>I mean, man, this again also came to the North exploration.</p>
<p>So I read a lot about like the exploration</p>
<p>of the North Pole and same thing.</p>
<p>These unextraordinary men take people out into the ice</p>
<p>and get frozen out there for years and shit goes so bad.</p>
<p>They end up eating each other.</p>
<p>They all die.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous, one I&rsquo;m forgetting his name,</p>
<p>the British Franklin expedition,</p>
<p>where they went searching for them for like 20 years.</p>
<p>And they eventually came across a group of Inuit</p>
<p>who were like, oh yeah, we saw some weird white men here</p>
<p>like 15 years ago.</p>
<p>And they find their bones and there&rsquo;s like saw marks,</p>
<p>which showed that they were eating each other.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>So history remembers the ones who didn&rsquo;t eat each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, yeah, we remember the ones who made it,</p>
<p>but there are.</p>
<p>And that would be the story of Mars as well.</p>
<p>That will be the story of Mars.</p>
<p>But, and nevertheless, that&rsquo;s the interesting thing</p>
<p>about Antarctica.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, something about human nature</p>
<p>drives us to explore it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that seems to be like, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of people have this kind of,</p>
<p>to me, frustrating conversations like,</p>
<p>well, Earth is great, man.</p>
<p>Why do we need to colonize Mars?</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same people that say like, why are you running?</p>
<p>Like, why are you running a marathon?</p>
<p>What are you running from, man?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pushing the limits of the human mind</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s George Mallory because it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s somehow actually the result of that,</p>
<p>if you want to be pragmatic about it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about pushing that limit</p>
<p>that has side effects that you don&rsquo;t expect</p>
<p>that will create a better world back home</p>
<p>for the people, not necessarily on Earth,</p>
<p>but like just in general,</p>
<p>it raises the quality of life for everybody,</p>
<p>even though the initial endeavor doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>The very fact of pushing the limits of what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>then has side effects of benefiting everybody.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s difficult to predict ahead of time</p>
<p>what those benefits will be.</p>
<p>Say with colonizing Mars,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear what the benefits will be for Earth</p>
<p>or in general with struggling.</p>
<p>What did we get from the moon?</p>
<p>What did we get from Apollo, right?</p>
<p>Technically, and there were a lot of socialists</p>
<p>at the time making this argument.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, all this money going, you know what?</p>
<p>We went to the fucking moon in 1969.</p>
<p>That was amazing.</p>
<p>The greatest feat in human history, period.</p>
<p>What did we learn from it?</p>
<p>We learned about interstellar or interplanetary travel.</p>
<p>We learned that we could do something</p>
<p>off of a device less powerful than the computer in my pocket.</p>
<p>Like the amount of potential locked within my pocket</p>
<p>and your pocket, I mean, this is,</p>
<p>if you were to define my policies in one way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s greatness, like national,</p>
<p>a quest for national greatness.</p>
<p>There is no greatness without fulfilling</p>
<p>the ultimate calling of the human spirit,</p>
<p>which is more, it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>And why should it be?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>Our ancestors could have been content to sit,</p>
<p>well, actually many of them were,</p>
<p>were content to sit and say,</p>
<p>these berries will be here for a long time.</p>
<p>And they got eaten and they died.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the ones who got out and went to the next place</p>
<p>and the next place and went across the Siberian land bridge</p>
<p>and went across more.</p>
<p>And it just did extraordinary things.</p>
<p>The craziest ones, we are their offspring</p>
<p>and we fail them if we don&rsquo;t go into space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I would put it.</p>
<p>You should run for president.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just pro space, man.</p>
<p>I love space.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re pro doing difficult things</p>
<p>and pushing, exploring the world in all of its forms.</p>
<p>I hope that kind of spirit permeates politics too.</p>
<p>That same kind of a&hellip;</p>
<p>Can, can.</p>
<p>I, well, it can, and I hope so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you want to stay on it,</p>
<p>but I think that was book number one or two.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>Is there something else?</p>
<p>Well, this one is second,</p>
<p>this actually is a corollary to that, which is sapiens.</p>
<p>And I know that&rsquo;s a very normal, normie answer.</p>
<p>One of the best selling book.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a reason for that.</p>
<p>Yuval Noah Harari.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>Okay, look, yes, he didn&rsquo;t do any new research.</p>
<p>I get that.</p>
<p>All he did was aggregate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s very controversial in the scientific community,</p>
<p>but guess what?</p>
<p>He wrote a great book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very easy to read general explanation</p>
<p>of the rise of human history.</p>
<p>And it helps challenge a lot of preconceptions.</p>
<p>Are we special?</p>
<p>Are we an accident?</p>
<p>Are we more like a parasite?</p>
<p>Are we not?</p>
<p>What, is there a destiny to all of us?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You know, if anything, it&rsquo;s like what I just described,</p>
<p>which is more.</p>
<p>Move, move out.</p>
<p>The evolution of money.</p>
<p>Like, I know he gets a lot of hate,</p>
<p>but I think that he writes it so clearly and well</p>
<p>that for your average person to be able to read that,</p>
<p>you will come away with a more clear understanding</p>
<p>of the human race than before.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>I agree with you 100%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ashamed to, I usually don&rsquo;t bring up sapiens</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like, everybody&rsquo;s uncle has read it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>It is one of the, I think it&rsquo;ll be remembered</p>
<p>as one of the great books of this particular era.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s so clearly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the selfish gene with Dawkins.</p>
<p>I mean, it just aggregates so many ideas together</p>
<p>and puts language to it</p>
<p>that makes it very useful to talk about.</p>
<p>So it is one of the great books.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Another one is definitely Born to Run for the same reason</p>
<p>by Christopher McDougall, which is that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna listen to this whole podcast next week.</p>
<p>You have to.</p>
<p>Well, you should because it,</p>
<p>you are inheriting our most basic skill, which is running.</p>
<p>And reimagining human history</p>
<p>or reimagining like what we were</p>
<p>as opposed to what we are is very useful</p>
<p>because it helps you understand</p>
<p>how to tap into primal aspects of your brain,</p>
<p>which just drive you.</p>
<p>And the reason I love McDougall&rsquo;s writing is because</p>
<p>I love anybody who writes like this.</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell, who else?</p>
<p>Michael Lewis, people who find characters</p>
<p>to tell a bigger story.</p>
<p>Michael Lewis finds characters to tell us the story</p>
<p>of the financial crisis.</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell writes, finds characters to tell us</p>
<p>the story of learning new skills and outliers</p>
<p>and whatever his latest book is,</p>
<p>I forget what it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>But McDougall tells the vignettes</p>
<p>and a tiny story of a single person</p>
<p>in the history of running</p>
<p>and like how it&rsquo;s baked into your DNA.</p>
<p>And I think there was just something very useful</p>
<p>to that for me for being like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to go to the gym</p>
<p>or like, I&rsquo;m not saying, you should still go to the gym.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying like, in order to fulfill like who you are,</p>
<p>you can actually tap into something that&rsquo;s the most basic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if, I&rsquo;m sure if you listened</p>
<p>to the David Cho episode with Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Oh, where he&rsquo;s the animal.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>With the baboon.</p>
<p>When he goes hunting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something to that, man.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something to that.</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s just like, they are living the way</p>
<p>that we were supposed to.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not supposed, well,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna put a normative judgment on it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re living the way that we used to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something very fun.</p>
<p>It feels more honest somehow to our true nature.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy I follow on Instagram.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come from, Paul Saladino, Carnivore MD.</p>
<p>He just went over there to the Hadza to live with them.</p>
<p>And I was watching his stuff just like,</p>
<p>I was like, man, there&rsquo;s something in you that wants to go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I wanna do that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be very good at it, but like I want to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad that somebody who thinks deeply about politics</p>
<p>is so fascinated with exploration</p>
<p>and with the very basic nature,</p>
<p>like human nature, nature of our existence.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something in you.</p>
<p>And still you&rsquo;re stuck in DC.</p>
<p>For now, for now.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you&rsquo;re from Texas.</p>
<p>What do you make of the future of Texas politically,</p>
<p>culturally, economically?</p>
<p>I am in part moving, well, I&rsquo;m moving to Austin.</p>
<p>Congrats.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also doing the Eric Weinstein advice,</p>
<p>which is like, dude, you&rsquo;re not married.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have kids.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as moving.</p>
<p>What are you moving?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like your three suits and some shirts and underwear.</p>
<p>What exactly is the move entail?</p>
<p>So I have nothing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m basically, it&rsquo;s very just remain mobile,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a promise, there&rsquo;s a hope to Austin.</p>
<p>Outside of just like friendships,</p>
<p>I have no, it&rsquo;s a very different culture</p>
<p>that Joe Rogan is creating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mostly interested in what the next Silicon Valley</p>
<p>will be, what the next hub of technological innovation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a promise, maybe a dream</p>
<p>for Austin being that next place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t have the baggage of some of the political things,</p>
<p>maybe some of the sort of things that hold back</p>
<p>the beauty of, that makes capitalism,</p>
<p>that makes innovation so powerful,</p>
<p>which is like meritocracy, which is excellence.</p>
<p>Diversity is exceptionally important,</p>
<p>but it should not be the only priority.</p>
<p>It has to be something that coexists</p>
<p>with a like insatiable drive towards excellence.</p>
<p>And it seems like Texas is a nice place,</p>
<p>like having a Austin, which is like a kind of this weird,</p>
<p>I hope it stays weird, man.</p>
<p>I love weird people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that, but we can get into it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s this hope is it remains this weird place</p>
<p>of brilliant innovation amidst a state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like more conservative.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s a nice balance of everything.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about the future of Texas?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so fascinating to me</p>
<p>because I never thought I would want to move back,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m beginning to be convinced.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to stick to this clip.</p>
<p>I am, I&rsquo;m being honest</p>
<p>and many Texas will hate me for this.</p>
<p>But Texas was not a place that was kind to me, quote unquote.</p>
<p>And this is because of my own parent.</p>
<p>Look, I was raised in College Station, Texas,</p>
<p>which is a town of 50,000.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a university town.</p>
<p>It exists only for the university.</p>
<p>So it was a very,</p>
<p>I did not get the full Texas experience</p>
<p>purely speaking from a College Station experience.</p>
<p>But growing up first generation, or I forget what it is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the first American.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in College Station.</p>
<p>My parents are from India.</p>
<p>Being raised in a town where the dominant culture</p>
<p>was predominantly like white evangelical Christian was hard.</p>
<p>Like it was just difficult.</p>
<p>And I think of it,</p>
<p>in the beginning, I would say like ages,</p>
<p>like zero to like eight,</p>
<p>it was like cultural ignorance,</p>
<p>as in like they just don&rsquo;t know how to interact with you.</p>
<p>And there was a level of,</p>
<p>always there was like the evangelical kind of antipathy</p>
<p>towards like you being not Christian.</p>
<p>You know, my parents are Hindu.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s how I was raised.</p>
<p>And so like, there was that.</p>
<p>But 9 11 was very difficult.</p>
<p>Like 9 11 happened when I was in third or fourth grade.</p>
<p>And that changed everything, man.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, our temple had to like print out T shirts.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying this is a sob story, to be clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still actually largely for my adult life</p>
<p>identified on the political right.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t take this as some like, you know, race manifesto.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just telling it like, this is what happened,</p>
<p>which is that like we had,</p>
<p>it was just hard to be proud, frankly,</p>
<p>and to have some of the fallout from 9 11 and during Iraq.</p>
<p>And the reason I am political is because I realize in myself,</p>
<p>I have a strong rebellious nature</p>
<p>against systems and structures of power.</p>
<p>And the first people I ever rebelled against</p>
<p>were all the people telling me to shut up</p>
<p>and not question the Iraq war.</p>
<p>So the reason I am in politics</p>
<p>is because I hated George W. Bush with a passion</p>
<p>and I hated the war.</p>
<p>And I was so, again, my entire background</p>
<p>is largely in national security for this reason,</p>
<p>which is I was obsessed with the idea of like,</p>
<p>how do we get people who are not gonna get us</p>
<p>into these quagmire situations in positions of power?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I became fascinated by power in the first place</p>
<p>was all a question of how do this happen?</p>
<p>Like, how did this catastrophe happen?</p>
<p>I realized it&rsquo;s not as bad as like, you know,</p>
<p>previous conflicts, but this one was mine.</p>
<p>And to see how it changed our domestic politics forever.</p>
<p>And so that was my rebellion.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>because I identified on the left when I was growing up,</p>
<p>up until I was 18, I had also a funny two year stint.</p>
<p>This is where everything kind of changed for me</p>
<p>when I was 16, actually.</p>
<p>I moved to Qatar, to Doha, Qatar,</p>
<p>because my dad was a dean or associate dean</p>
<p>of Texas A&amp;M University at Doha.</p>
<p>So my last two years of high school were at this.</p>
<p>I went from this small town in Texas,</p>
<p>and I love my parents because they could recognize</p>
<p>that I had within me that I was not a small town kid.</p>
<p>So they took me out of this country every chance they got.</p>
<p>I traveled everywhere and constantly let me go.</p>
<p>And so I went from school in College Station</p>
<p>to like this ritzy private school, American school.</p>
<p>Best thing that ever happened to me,</p>
<p>because first of all, it got me out of College Station.</p>
<p>Second, at that time, I had this annoying streak of,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call it being anti America,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t appreciate America.</p>
<p>Let me tell everybody out there listening,</p>
<p>leave for a while, you will miss it so much.</p>
<p>You do not know what it is like</p>
<p>to not have freedom of speech until you don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>And I was going to high school</p>
<p>with these guys in the Qatari royal family.</p>
<p>And all I wanted to do was speak out</p>
<p>of how they were pieces of shit</p>
<p>for the way that they treated Indian citizens</p>
<p>in that country who are basically used as slave labor.</p>
<p>And I could not say one word</p>
<p>because I knew I would be deported</p>
<p>and I knew my dad would lose his job</p>
<p>and my mom would lose her job</p>
<p>and we would be forced out of the country.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to live like that.</p>
<p>Or to be in a society where like,</p>
<p>you have like a high school girlfriend or something</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t even touch in public</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re lectured for public decency.</p>
<p>Like, listen, I&rsquo;ve lived under a Gulf monarchy now.</p>
<p>And that turned me into the most pro America guy ever.</p>
<p>Like I came back so like Merica,</p>
<p>like I still am because of that experience.</p>
<p>Living abroad, like that will do it to you.</p>
<p>Live in a non democracy.</p>
<p>You have, even in Europe, I would say,</p>
<p>you guys aren&rsquo;t living as free as we are here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome and I love it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ultimately another human being</p>
<p>than the one who left Texas.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, I mean, have you actually considered moving to Texas</p>
<p>and broadly just outside of your own story,</p>
<p>what do you think is the future of Texas?</p>
<p>What is the future of Austin?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much transformation seemingly happening now</p>
<p>related to Silicon Valley, to California.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been so hard to me,</p>
<p>which is that since I left, it&rsquo;s changed dramatically,</p>
<p>which is that it used to be like this conservative state</p>
<p>where the main money to be made was oil.</p>
<p>And everybody knew that.</p>
<p>Petro, it was a Petro state, Houston, all of that.</p>
<p>Austin was always weird, but it was more of a music town</p>
<p>and a university town.</p>
<p>It was not a tech town.</p>
<p>But in the 10 years or so since I left,</p>
<p>I have begun to realize, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>well, the Texas I grew up in is over.</p>
<p>It is not a deep red state in any sense of the term.</p>
<p>The number one Uhaul route in the country pre pandemic</p>
<p>already was San Francisco to Austin, okay?</p>
<p>So like you have this massive influx of people</p>
<p>from California and New York.</p>
<p>And the state, the composition of it</p>
<p>is changed dramatically.</p>
<p>The intra composition and the ultra, yeah.</p>
<p>So the intra composition, it&rsquo;s become way more urban.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from when I grew up, Texas was a much more rural state.</p>
<p>Its politics were much more static.</p>
<p>It looked much more like Rick Perry,</p>
<p>like he was a very accurate representation of who we were.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>Texas is now a dynamic economy,</p>
<p>not just 100% reliant on oil because of its kind of like,</p>
<p>I would call it like regulatory arbitrage</p>
<p>relative to California and New York</p>
<p>offers a large incentive to people who are more,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say culturally liberal,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not necessarily like culturally conservative,</p>
<p>like the people who I grew up with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s changed the whole state&rsquo;s politics.</p>
<p>Beto came two points away from beating Ted Cruz.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying the state&rsquo;s gonna go blue.</p>
<p>I think the Republican party will just change</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have to readjust.</p>
<p>But the re urbanization of Texas has made it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put it in this way,</p>
<p>much more attractive to me than the place that I grew up.</p>
<p>And then from my perspective,</p>
<p>well, first of all,</p>
<p>I love some of the cowboy things that Texas stands for,</p>
<p>but for more practically, from my perspective,</p>
<p>the injection of the tech innovation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s moving to Texas has made it very exciting to me.</p>
<p>It seems like outside of all that,</p>
<p>maybe you can speak to the weird in Austin.</p>
<p>It seems like I know that Joe Rogan is a rich,</p>
<p>sort of almost like mainstream at this point,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also attracting a lot of weirdos.</p>
<p>And so is Elon and a lot of those weirdos are my friends</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like Michael Malice, like those weirdos.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I have a hope for Austin</p>
<p>that all kinds of different flavors of weirdos</p>
<p>will get injected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I actually think the most significant thing that happened</p>
<p>were Tesla moving there.</p>
<p>The reason why is I love Joe, obviously,</p>
<p>but he can only attract X amount of people.</p>
<p>Elon actually employs thousands of people.</p>
<p>And then you will also Oracle.</p>
<p>Oracle&rsquo;s decision to move to Austin is just as important</p>
<p>because those two men, Larry, was it Ellison, right?</p>
<p>Ellison and Elon,</p>
<p>they actually employ tens of thousands of people</p>
<p>collectively, that can change the nature of the city.</p>
<p>So you combine that with Joe bringing</p>
<p>this entire new entertainment complex</p>
<p>with the bodies of people who will appreciate</p>
<p>said entertainment complex.</p>
<p>Spend money on the entertainment.</p>
<p>Exactly, you just remade the entire city.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m fascinated.</p>
<p>And obviously there&rsquo;s network effects,</p>
<p>which is now that all those people are down there,</p>
<p>I mean, if I were Elon Musk,</p>
<p>I would donate a shit ton of money</p>
<p>to the University of Texas</p>
<p>and I would turn it into my Stanford for Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s introduce some competition</p>
<p>and let UT Austin hire the best software developers,</p>
<p>engineers, professors, and more,</p>
<p>and turn Texas into a true like Austin revolving door hub</p>
<p>where people come to UT Austin to get an internship at Tesla</p>
<p>and then become an executive there</p>
<p>and then create their own company</p>
<p>in their own garage in Austin,</p>
<p>which is the next Facebook, Twitter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it happens.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m much more skeptical of Miami.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole like tech Miami crew.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, like there&rsquo;s no university.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very inorganic.</p>
<p>Look, I think Miami is awesome.</p>
<p>I just like, I don&rsquo;t know if the same building blocks</p>
<p>are there and also no multi billion dollar companies</p>
<p>which employ thousands of people are coming there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ingredient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just even Elon Musk</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s still operated in California.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the people he employs.</p>
<p>I think that is where, I think Texas is going</p>
<p>to dramatically change within the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Alternative to, it&rsquo;s already become a more urbanized state</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s moved away from oil and gas</p>
<p>in terms of like its emphasis,</p>
<p>not necessarily in terms of his real economics.</p>
<p>And 10 years from now,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it will be necessarily the name prop</p>
<p>like of the town.</p>
<p>The only question to me is how that manifests politically</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very possible though,</p>
<p>because a lot of these workers themselves</p>
<p>are California culturally liberal.</p>
<p>You could see a Gavin Newsom type person</p>
<p>getting elected governor of Texas</p>
<p>or like the mayor of Austin.</p>
<p>I mean, look, mayor of Austin is already a Democrat, right?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, Joe has his own problems with Austin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, I remember him leaving LA</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know, have you been to Austin?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not everything it&rsquo;s cracked up to be,</p>
<p>necessarily.</p>
<p>But no matter what, a new place allows the possibility</p>
<p>for new ideas, even if they&rsquo;re somehow left leaning</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I do think the only two things missing</p>
<p>from Austin and Texas are two dudes in a suit</p>
<p>that sometimes have a podcast</p>
<p>talking a bunch of nonsense on a mic.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s bring the best suit game to Texas.</p>
<p>I hope you do make it to Texas at some point.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Sagar and Jetty.</p>
<p>And thank you to our sponsors,</p>

<p>and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>About the idea that what is just and what is legal</p>
<p>are not always the same thing.</p>
<p>He said, never forget that what Hitler did in Germany</p>
<p>was legal.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
