    <p>So, Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi, folks.</p>
<p>So by way of introduction, I want to just sort of tell the story of how this panel happened.</p>
<p>It arose out of almost a throwaway comment that Jason made on an episode of the pod where</p>
<p>he was talking about, you know, lining up speakers for this event, and he said that,</p>
<p>you know, he was having a hard time getting liberals, and all he could find were, like,</p>
<p>right-wingers like Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi.</p>
<p>And in terms of just to explain their backgrounds a little bit, you know, Matt used to be the</p>
<p>‚Äì they&rsquo;re both independent journalists who write phenomenal columns on Substack,</p>
<p>and all of you should check it out and subscribe, and by the way, they also do call-in shows</p>
<p>on a phenomenal podcasting platform that you should all check out.</p>
<p>But Matt was sort of like the left-wing firebrand, sort of populist firebrand on Writing for</p>
<p>Rolling Stone, who back in 2009 was asking the question why the people who caused the</p>
<p>great financial crisis, why no one was going to jail, and Glenn, you know, broke the Snowden</p>
<p>story about how the government was engaging in mass surveillance on all of us and raising</p>
<p>questions about the infringement of our civil liberties.</p>
<p>So you know, both these guys have, I&rsquo;d say, you know, well-established bona fides, you</p>
<p>know, what used to be considered left-wing sort of liberal bona fides, but now today</p>
<p>somehow they&rsquo;ve been read out of what you would call liberalism today.</p>
<p>And so that comment that Jason made sort of, I think there&rsquo;s so much to unpack there</p>
<p>on how that happened.</p>
<p>What does liberalism today mean if it doesn&rsquo;t include you guys?</p>
<p>And so maybe that&rsquo;s the place to start, is trying to understand what has happened in</p>
<p>our politics that makes you guys not liberal anymore, and what is liberalism, and then</p>
<p>what is conservatism, and are we even thinking about the political divide in our country</p>
<p>the right way if left versus right doesn&rsquo;t really capture it anymore?</p>
<p>So that was sort of the starting point for this.</p>
<p>Who wants to just react to anything I just said?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, first of all, it&rsquo;s of course very gratifying to realize that your attendance</p>
<p>at a conference is due to a throwaway line from Gibson, so super honored to hear that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the reason why we were invited.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, it&rsquo;s interesting, I guess we join a long list of other far-right luminaries</p>
<p>like Russell Brand, who has spent the last 15 years as one of the most vocal devotees</p>
<p>to the socialist Jeremy Corbyn, he&rsquo;s now also on the right, and Joe Rogan, who just</p>
<p>18 months ago said to millions of people that his favorite candidate running for president</p>
<p>was Bernie Sanders, the socialist left-wing candidate from Vermont, and even now Elon</p>
<p>Musk, who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 over Mitt Romney and is one of the largest donors</p>
<p>to the ACLU, somehow he&rsquo;s also on the far right, so in some sense it&rsquo;s just become a</p>
<p>kind of punishing label that&rsquo;s designed to stigmatize or demonize anybody who in any</p>
<p>way descends from or diverges from liberal orthodoxy, it&rsquo;s just kind of an enforcement</p>
<p>or coercive label that has no meaning, just bereft of any actual substance, but I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a broader dynamic underneath it all, which is that, you know, it is true that</p>
<p>every five years, 10 years, what was once an issue at the forefront of our debates goes</p>
<p>to the background and other issues go to the forefront, so 10 years ago we were spending</p>
<p>a lot of time debating things like Obama&rsquo;s drone program or Guantanamo not being closed,</p>
<p>or as you said, the work Matt was doing on derivatives and the fraud on Wall Street,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t talk much about that anymore, we spend a lot of time now talking instead about</p>
<p>whether the internet should be this instrument of censorship and information control, whether</p>
<p>we should trust the US security state to dictate what is and is not disinformation, whether</p>
<p>we should be involved in very similar kinds of proxy wars like we spent the Cold War doing</p>
<p>over places like Ukraine, and so in one way it&rsquo;s natural that political alliances shift</p>
<p>as different issues go to the fore and alliances change as a result, but I think something</p>
<p>much more important is that liberalism itself has changed largely by virtue of Donald Trump</p>
<p>because liberals, as a defining view, maybe as an overarching view&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe Democrats, not liberals.</p>
<p>Yeah, by liberals I just mean kind of the mainstream wing of the Democratic Party, the</p>
<p>way Hillary Clinton calls herself progressive, so again, illustrating the bankruptcy of</p>
<p>these terms, but by liberals I just mean kind of like the Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, Hillary</p>
<p>Clinton, Chuck Schumer wing, have come to believe that the overarching way to understand</p>
<p>politics is that there&rsquo;s one primary menace and risk to the United States, which is Donald</p>
<p>Trump, his movement, and the Republican Party, and it&rsquo;s not just that they have a bad ideology,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re actual fascists trying to instill a white nationalist dictatorship, and if</p>
<p>you actually believe that, if that&rsquo;s something that you genuinely believe, on some level</p>
<p>it becomes rational to start embracing authoritarian methods of resisting that, of combating that,</p>
<p>censoring, using due process-free processes to punish people and deprive them of their</p>
<p>liberty, and I think any time a political movement gets convinced that it is no longer</p>
<p>involved in a political debate but a historic war between pure good and pure evil, it starts</p>
<p>to turn to authoritarian tactics to win because it believes that&rsquo;s justified or even necessary,</p>
<p>and those authoritarian tactics happen to be the ones that the left traditionally had</p>
<p>opposed and now are embracing, and I guess Matt and I didn&rsquo;t decide that we were going</p>
<p>to change our views over the last 30 years about these issues, and that has caused this</p>
<p>organic breach, not just between us two but others like us, and as I said, anyone who</p>
<p>finds themselves outside of liberal orthodoxy automatically receives the far-right label.</p>
<p>Yeah, first of all, I agree with all that, and for me it&rsquo;s even funnier because prior</p>
<p>to 2008 I would say that I was sort of like the triumphant, insolent comic dog of journalism.</p>
<p>Basically my job at Rolling Stone was to throw off one-liners about Republicans.</p>
<p>My editors almost never sent me to a democratic function because they didn&rsquo;t want me describing</p>
<p>those events in a colorful way, let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>So I got sent to a lot of events where people like Sarah Palin or Fred Thompson or Mike</p>
<p>Huckabee would be speaking.</p>
<p>I actually won a national magazine award for a column about Huckabee called My Favorite</p>
<p>Nut Job.</p>
<p>But then after 2008, after Obama got elected, they assigned me to do a story, one story,</p>
<p>about the 2008 financial crisis, essentially with the idea of explaining it in terms that</p>
<p>people who are not financial professionals could understand.</p>
<p>So I did one story that was really about AIG, and we got this overwhelming response that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d never gotten before from readers we&rsquo;d never heard from before, and that led to me</p>
<p>doing eight years of work instead of one story.</p>
<p>And one of the themes that came out of that reporting was that in the sort of post-bailout</p>
<p>economy, the wealth gap was widening.</p>
<p>And I just read a statistic that said that during the Obama years, the bottom 99% saw</p>
<p>their average wealth decrease by $4,900, whereas the top 1% saw its wealth increase by an average</p>
<p>of $4.9 million.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t make that big of a deal of this in my reporting, but when 2016 came around,</p>
<p>in covering both the Trump and Sanders campaigns, it was abundantly clear that this widening</p>
<p>wealth gap and the stress that it had placed on populations on both the left and the right</p>
<p>was a significant factor in this race.</p>
<p>And when I started to write this in the context of covering Trump, rather than just doing</p>
<p>the usual thing of tossing off insults about the candidate, which is easy enough to do</p>
<p>with Trump, I started to say things like, well, there are reasons why he&rsquo;s succeeding.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s attracting crowds that are not just the usual Republican crowds.</p>
<p>There are former union members here.</p>
<p>They have a lot in common with the crowds who show up at Bernie Sanders events.</p>
<p>And I started to notice a distinctly unpleasant reaction from people inside the business,</p>
<p>where it quickly became taboo to explain Donald Trump in any way other than this is a white</p>
<p>supremacist movement and he&rsquo;s appealing to the lowest common denominator through that</p>
<p>kind of messaging.</p>
<p>I happen to believe that that was certainly part of what was going on, but it wasn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>whole explanation.</p>
<p>But I think Trump is the dividing line of what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>If you have a nuanced explanation for Donald Trump, then you can&rsquo;t be part of the club</p>
<p>anymore because the dominant narrative requires that he be cartoonized in the same way that</p>
<p>we used to do it with figures like Saddam Hussein or Putin now.</p>
<p>We call it the Hitler of the month club.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not willing to just do that, and if you try to actually explain where are all</p>
<p>these orders coming from, why are they upset, what went wrong that this would happen?</p>
<p>Also known as the purpose of journalism.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Which is supposed to be our job.</p>
<p>I think both of us quickly learned that that was not welcome.</p>
<p>After Trump got elected, I think that instinct to crowd out anyone who was interested in</p>
<p>going there and trying to figure out what was wrong that it caused 2016 suddenly became</p>
<p>an apostate.</p>
<p>By the way, that includes some politicians.</p>
<p>Bernie Sanders, I think, was one of the people who was very interested in examining what</p>
<p>happened in 2016.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why there was such a violent reaction to his candidacy</p>
<p>in both 2016 and 2020.</p>
<p>For me, I think that&rsquo;s the dividing line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like something&rsquo;s changed so much with liberalism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really about Trump, I think, and journalism has adjusted.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone from being people whose primary job is to be curious about why things happen</p>
<p>to being advocates who believe that certain people have to be opposed at all costs, even</p>
<p>if that cost is a little bit of the truth, or a lot of it, even.</p>
<p>Having ripped the umpire jersey off their backs to basically stop the Trump menace,</p>
<p>it seems like journalism can&rsquo;t now go back to even a pretense of neutrality.</p>
<p>So it basically has happened now?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>I think you see that in what&rsquo;s happening with the ratings at cable stations.</p>
<p>I warned about this in 2016.</p>
<p>I wrote a column that summer saying that a model where basically right-wing media wrote</p>
<p>about the evils of the Democratic Party and blue media wrote about the evils of the Republican</p>
<p>Party that just wouldn&rsquo;t work audience-wise, because audiences would no longer trust either</p>
<p>source to be objective and to report the facts.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where we are now.</p>
<p>We see the declining ratings of companies like CNN and MSNBC, which were previously</p>
<p>thought of as more kind of down-the-road, down-the-middle-of-the-road news agencies,</p>
<p>and now are thought of as politicized, and they&rsquo;re having terrible trouble kind of going</p>
<p>back, because once you cross that line into politics, you can&rsquo;t get your reputation back</p>
<p>as a neutral fact-finder anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think people forget what things were like before Trump, since he&rsquo;s such a kind</p>
<p>of ubiquitous presence, as Matt was saying, and for me, he also defines and is responsible</p>
<p>for most of the changes we&rsquo;re discussing.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, most of these news organizations were on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>Every MSNBC host was on the verge of being fired, a couple of months away from being</p>
<p>fired because nobody was watching.</p>
<p>The New York Times had severe financial difficulty.</p>
<p>There was talk about whether they would have to declare bankruptcy because their balance</p>
<p>sheet was so drowning in debt, and Trump saved them all.</p>
<p>He saved the entire industry.</p>
<p>They all owed their jobs, their second homes, the ability to pay off their IRS debt to Donald</p>
<p>Trump, because you can trace his emergence on the scene to when people started watching</p>
<p>those programs again, and what they did was they rebranded as the resistance to Donald</p>
<p>Trump, and they sacrificed any even pretense of journalistic function.</p>
<p>They know, and you just look at polling data, that 95% of the people who watch MSNBC and</p>
<p>93% of the people who read the New York Times and trust it identify as Democrats, so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a completely polarized media.</p>
<p>One of the non-media examples is the ACLU.</p>
<p>There was an article in 2015 in the ACLU about the ACLU and the Washington Post that they</p>
<p>had to engage in mass layoffs of their staff because they had no money.</p>
<p>Trump gets inaugurated.</p>
<p>They start tweeting every day, we&rsquo;ll see you in court, Mr. Trump, and stimulating the g-zones</p>
<p>of every liberal, and suddenly they&rsquo;re drowning in money, like millions and millions of dollars,</p>
<p>you know, like building the ACLU.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s always financially struggled, and as a result they&rsquo;re completely captive</p>
<p>now to that kind of an audience.</p>
<p>You know, I have a friend, I guess I had a friend, who was a host of an MSNBC show, and</p>
<p>they once told me that they don&rsquo;t get show-by-show ratings, they get segment-by-segment ratings,</p>
<p>and ever since Trump, they told me the minute you put on anybody who&rsquo;s critical of the Democratic</p>
<p>Party anyway, you can just see the audience completely disappear, which you can imagine</p>
<p>a person in that position, what an enforcement mechanism that is, to know that they have</p>
<p>a salary and kids and the need to pay for college and their mortgage, and they know</p>
<p>if they do anything that deviates at all from Democratic Party doctrine, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>lose their audience.</p>
<p>The New York Times knows that, the ACLU knows that, and so yeah, I think they&rsquo;re all not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just that they&rsquo;ve lost their credibility and can&rsquo;t get it back, which is absolutely</p>
<p>true, as Matt said, it&rsquo;s also that they&rsquo;re now captive to this kind of prison cell that</p>
<p>they built for themselves, chasing the sugar high that Trump provided.</p>
<p>Just really quickly, I got to tell a story, in the middle of all this phenomenon, reporters</p>
<p>were arguing about whether or not we should be covering him less, because maybe we had</p>
<p>helped him get the nomination, you know, I cover Trump&rsquo;s campaign, and this was a hot</p>
<p>topic on the bus at the time, but then it was sort of decided that, nah, he&rsquo;s just making</p>
<p>us all so much money, let&rsquo;s just go with it, and I remember being in Indianapolis when</p>
<p>Trump sewed up the nomination by beating Cruz, who still had a mathematical chance of winning,</p>
<p>I guess, if he had done well there, but Trump, if you remember, during that particular race,</p>
<p>accused Cruz of being the Zodiac killer, which was hilarious, because Cruz was born</p>
<p>two years after the killing ended, but there was one reporter I know who actually got the</p>
<p>nerve up to ask, I believe it was Cruz&rsquo;s wife, about the accusations, like, what do you have</p>
<p>to say to the idea that your husband is the Zodiac killer, and he&rsquo;s telling me the story</p>
<p>about this afterwards, and he goes, you know, I felt so dirty doing it, but I also felt</p>
<p>so great.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s where they were, they were in that space for a long time.</p>
<p>The media and Trump had a weird codependent relationship.</p>
<p>Just in terms of trying to appeal to people out there who may not be Trump fans, or to</p>
<p>get through to them on this point, it just seems to me that when you lose an election,</p>
<p>anytime you lose an election as a party, you need to analyze what went wrong, and especially</p>
<p>when the candidate is a complete political novice, with no prior experience, and had</p>
<p>so many attributes that historically were considered extreme negatives, and it seems</p>
<p>to me that if you were just to look at what happened in 2016, Trump was able to ride</p>
<p>a few key issues all the way to the White House.</p>
<p>One was these foreign wars, these interventions that we&rsquo;ve had in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria,</p>
<p>Libya, that were disasters.</p>
<p>We hadn&rsquo;t gotten out of Afghanistan yet, but it was on its way to being a historic 20-year</p>
<p>failure.</p>
<p>He shattered the Republican Party with that message, no more Bushes.</p>
<p>He then took the issue of trade, and basically broke down the Democrats&rsquo; blue wall and the</p>
<p>Rust Belt, by basically pointing out the ways that our bipartisan trade policy, just like</p>
<p>our bipartisan foreign war policy, had led to the de-industrialization of the Rust Belt.</p>
<p>And then he also used the issue of immigration, which was sort of closely related to that</p>
<p>idea of creating wage pressure on the working class.</p>
<p>So you would think that having rode those issues all the way to the White House, that</p>
<p>there would be some sort of reappraisal, and instead it seems like what the elite did to</p>
<p>protect itself was create these mythologies that Trump somehow got elected, not because</p>
<p>the people of the country were fed up with the way that it had been run for 20 years</p>
<p>by both parties, but rather because the Russians somehow were behind it, or the country was</p>
<p>shopped through with white supremacy and that somehow explained it.</p>
<p>And so we never really got a true sort of accounting or reappraisal of what Trump&rsquo;s</p>
<p>election meant, and instead the media turned to this hysteria, this mode that we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>even out of yet.</p>
<p>Your reactions to that?</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s one of the most amazing things about the 2016 election, which is, first of</p>
<p>all, in a lot of ways, Barack Obama being this kind of once-in-a-generation political</p>
<p>talent papered over the incredibly serious systemic problems the Democrats had, even</p>
<p>while he was being re-elected underneath Obama and all his glitter and glamour, the Democratic</p>
<p>Party was collapsing.</p>
<p>They were losing state houses and congressional seats and governorships all over the country.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is the anger, the growing anger with the neoliberal policies</p>
<p>that the Democratic Party in the early 1990s had decided to embrace in lieu of the working-class</p>
<p>politics for which they had always been known.</p>
<p>The kind of Clintonian pronouncement that the Democratic Party needs to start embracing</p>
<p>corporate America instead of unions, that it needs to move much closer to this politics</p>
<p>that says, you know, we&rsquo;re going to encourage corporate America, we&rsquo;re going to embrace</p>
<p>the Pentagon and all of that.</p>
<p>And it radically changed the Democratic Party into this party of technocracy and the elites</p>
<p>culminating with the Obama presidency.</p>
<p>And what is amazing is, in 2016, the Democrats lost the White House to a game show host.</p>
<p>And so you would think they would wonder why that happened, as you were saying, right?</p>
<p>You would think they would wonder, what is it about us that caused us to lose to Donald Trump?</p>
<p>And instead they invented this long list of people that they decided were to blame instead,</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin principally, WikiLeaks, Jill Stein for having the audacity to continue</p>
<p>to run for president, you know, a whole long list of villains, essentially everybody except</p>
<p>themselves and the people who are responsible for it.</p>
<p>And I think the most toxic narrative is the one that said the only reason Trump won was</p>
<p>because the country is radically and fundamentally racist, and he capitalized on that.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s so amazing about that is there are literally millions of voters, in excess</p>
<p>of 10 million, depending on how you count, but definitely in excess of 10 million, voters</p>
<p>who twice voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and then in 2016 voted for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>There are increasing numbers of non-white voters all over the country moving to the</p>
<p>Republican Party under Trump and voting increasingly for Trump.</p>
<p>You had a larger share of black voters, Latino voters, Asian American voters than any Republican</p>
<p>candidate in decades, and those trends are only worsening.</p>
<p>And so you have this media that has no interest in and no ability to understand how the majority</p>
<p>of people in the United States live, because their lives are completely separate, lived</p>
<p>in these isolated enclaves, in this kind of liberal bubble.</p>
<p>And you know, just today there was this amazing article by Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>It was about what most of you have probably heard, which was this horrific mass murder</p>
<p>in Buffalo where an 18-year-old white kid feeding on this kind of ideology of racial</p>
<p>hatred that has become fringe but very dangerous around the West, went into a store that he</p>
<p>knew was predominantly black and shot as many people as he could, killing 10 of them.</p>
<p>And then the article by Rolling Stone that was published this morning was, he is not</p>
<p>a lone wolf shooter, he is a mainstream Republican.</p>
<p>So I think all of you should be very careful because you&rsquo;re currently in a country where</p>
<p>half of the people in this country apparently are psychotic Nazis on the verge of some sort</p>
<p>of mass murder outbreak, including huge numbers of non-white Americans who are supporters</p>
<p>of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>And the more you kind of immerse yourself in a set of institutional beliefs and a kind</p>
<p>of ethos of your enclave, you know, just constantly hearing a belief reinforced and reinforced,</p>
<p>the more you believe it, the more you&rsquo;re immersed in it, the more immune you become to facts</p>
<p>that negate it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the reason why the media is so incurious, because they&rsquo;ve embraced this</p>
<p>narrative that the only reason anyone would vote for Republicans, the only reason anyone</p>
<p>would vote for Trump is because they&rsquo;re racist or they&rsquo;re fascist or they&rsquo;re white supremacist,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s left them completely unable to grapple with things like 10 million people voting</p>
<p>twice for Obama and then for Trump, or the fact, as Matt alluded to, there were all kinds</p>
<p>of people in 2016 who, if you asked them, they would say, yeah, I have two favorite</p>
<p>candidates this year.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d say, who are they?</p>
<p>And they would say, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.</p>
<p>To a working journalist, most working journalists are pundits or political operatives, that</p>
<p>makes no sense.</p>
<p>And they can&rsquo;t comprehend that because they see the world through this traditional left-right</p>
<p>prism that for increasing sections of the country, I would argue a majority, is no longer</p>
<p>applicable, is no longer how they see the world.</p>
<p>And this is so dangerous when you have this radical breach between the opinion-making</p>
<p>journalistic class and elite class on the one hand, and most of the population on the</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>They just live completely different lives, work with a completely set of beliefs about</p>
<p>the world, have completely different sets of interests.</p>
<p>And if you look at countries throughout history where that has happened, where there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>this complete divergence between the people who hold power in the country and the rest</p>
<p>of the country over whom they exercise that power, instability at best and usually much</p>
<p>worse things inevitably arise.</p>
<p>And I really think that&rsquo;s the point that we&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>Just quickly to piggyback on that, one of the big stories that went uncovered and continues</p>
<p>to go uncovered is the transformation of the Democratic electorate.</p>
<p>The last time I looked at this, 41 of the richest 50 congressional districts in America</p>
<p>had Democrats in those seats, and all of the top 10 richest districts were won by Democrats.</p>
<p>As recently as 1992, the split was more like 50-50.</p>
<p>If you live in an affluent suburb, the overwhelming majority of the voters there are going to</p>
<p>be Democrats now.</p>
<p>And the big divide in American politics is no longer about ideology, it&rsquo;s significantly</p>
<p>about income and even more, education.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a split between people who have high school degrees or less and people who are</p>
<p>college educated, and this is one of the reasons why Donald Trump was so effusive in saying</p>
<p>I love the poorly educated because they vote for him.</p>
<p>But this is another taboo subject.</p>
<p>Nobody likes to talk about this because it speaks to a transformation that happened in</p>
<p>the Democratic Party that began, I think, with Clinton when they went away from relying</p>
<p>on unions for financial support.</p>
<p>The DLC&rsquo;s big strategic idea was let&rsquo;s be more competitive on the fundraising front</p>
<p>by being more pro-business or pro-growth, that was the term that they used a lot.</p>
<p>And a couple of decades later, what you end up with is a party that no longer has any</p>
<p>real organic connection to working people of any kind.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s a massive factor in all of this, is that the reporting on class</p>
<p>politics has become taboo.</p>
<p>All you have to do is go to a Donald Trump event and you can see it clearly, that the</p>
<p>composition of the crowds is vastly different from what you see at a Democratic event.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why they hated the media, because they saw us as upper class</p>
<p>representatives of the coastal elite who all live in New York, L.A., and Washington,</p>
<p>which is true for the most part.</p>
<p>And it got increasingly hostile as time went on, and that&rsquo;s why Trump was scoring so many</p>
<p>points going after us, because we were symbols of the upper class.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another reason why I think the divide is no longer neatly between left and</p>
<p>right anymore.</p>
<p>It has a lot more to do with class than it ever did before.</p>
<p>Okay, David.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m over here to your, hey, I know you wanted to take a question or two from the audience</p>
<p>as we wrap up.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah, let&rsquo;s take some questions.</p>
<p>And I thought I would kick it off, great discussion about the left moving really far left and</p>
<p>taking advantage of the Trump bump in their ratings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, you kind of left out Fox News kind of mastering and Rupert Murdoch.</p>
<p>They kind of created this playbook in a way, and the left copied it.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that basically how it happened?</p>
<p>People saw, wow, Fox News was making so much money by picking a side that the New York</p>
<p>Times and MSNBC, et cetera, all just said, you know what, we might as well pick the other</p>
<p>side and just take this playbook and get the money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of what happened, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I wrote a book about this called Hate Inc., which, yeah, that&rsquo;s basically the thesis is</p>
<p>that Fox pioneered a new way to make money in media, which is sort of like the audience</p>
<p>optimization model.</p>
<p>You pick a group, a demographic, and then you try to dominate it by feeding it news</p>
<p>that you know that those people are going to respond to.</p>
<p>That was never the way things worked before for an ordinary news agency.</p>
<p>They would just cover what they thought was important and try to do the best that they</p>
<p>could.</p>
<p>Has anybody stayed neutral, Matt?</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at Reuters or AP, it&rsquo;s clear the New York Times, MSNBC, they&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>gone full, subscribe to us if you hate Trump.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to give you what you want.</p>
<p>But is there anybody in the middle still, Matt?</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why you&rsquo;re seeing Substack do well, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much that it&rsquo;s left or right, it&rsquo;s just that most people are not partisans.</p>
<p>Most people live somewhere in the middle, right, and have opinions that are all over</p>
<p>the place, and they cannot stand turning on the television and knowing exactly what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to say ahead of time.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re looking for some place that&rsquo;s different, where you have differences of opinion,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I think independent media is doing better than ever.</p>
<p>I mean, the most influential person in media, even though the mainstream part of the media</p>
<p>never talks about him because he&rsquo;s not part of them, is without question Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>He speaks to more people who are under 85 years old, which is the cable audience, than</p>
<p>anybody on television by far.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because, as Matt just said, you cannot pin him down ideologically, nor does he have</p>
<p>fealty to any one political faction or certainly to any political party.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a curious person, sometimes on the left and sometimes on the right and sometimes</p>
<p>neither, exactly like most Americans.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s such a great point, Glenn.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you were going to pin him, if you just looked at how he voted, he&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>a Democrat.</p>
<p>And the fact that the Democrats have Joe Rogan and Elon Musk having been their supporters</p>
<p>and voting for them for decades, and they&rsquo;re too stupid to pull them into their party,</p>
<p>is just shows how-</p>
<p>They do the opposite.</p>
<p>They say, no, Joe Rogan, we know that you love Bernie Sanders, the most far left candidate</p>
<p>ever to be viable in decades, but even though you love him, we&rsquo;re going to demand that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>our enemy and call you a far right fanatic, even though you don&rsquo;t think you are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to demand that Bernie Sanders renounce Joe Rogan&rsquo;s endorsement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our plan for winning the election.</p>
<p>I mean, Sax, as much as you and I go at it with how absolutely horrific the Republican</p>
<p>Party is, I mean, the Democrats are so incompetent to not court the two most influential people</p>
<p>in America today, Joe Rogan and Elon Musk.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re alienating them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re radicalizing them away from them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even worse.</p>
<p>I mean, is there any, I mean, Sax is just flabbergasted, but is there any way, Glenn,</p>
<p>you can comment on this and explain what you think the Democrats are thinking?</p>
<p>Or are they just not thinking strategically about winning elections?</p>
<p>You know, I think in addition to what you guys just talked about in terms of MSNBC and</p>
<p>CNN copying the model, there has been a radical change in the composition of the Republican</p>
<p>Party ideologically because of Trump, not because Trump is some sort of like disciplined</p>
<p>political theorist or deep thinker, but because he ushered in, as David was saying earlier,</p>
<p>he ran in 2016 in opposition to Bush-Cheney foreign policy, in opposition to Reagan economics.</p>
<p>He railed against the power of large corporations at the expense of the working person, something</p>
<p>you never would have heard from Reagan.</p>
<p>But he also ushered in a lot of hostility toward agencies like the CIA and the NSA and</p>
<p>the FBI, something that had always been the province of the left.</p>
<p>And so now you have an enormous amount of space opened on the right for all kinds of</p>
<p>views that had previously been closed.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s just a lot more vibrancy on the right, a lot more internal debate,</p>
<p>whereas in the Democratic Party, it&rsquo;s just a very much you&rsquo;re either with us or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>against us mindset, and any deviation, as we were talking about at the beginning, automatically</p>
<p>results in them proclaiming you their enemy, which doesn&rsquo;t seem like a very effective way</p>
<p>of doing politics to me.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s take a quick question from the audience.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about Elon behind his back before he joins.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your guys&rsquo; take?</p>
<p>Is he serious?</p>
<p>Is he going to buy it?</p>
<p>And what is, you know, what do you think the fallout is going to be?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s going to buy it or not.</p>
<p>I think that I haven&rsquo;t really gone into the details of that.</p>
<p>What I do think is fascinating is the reaction by people in media to even the proposition</p>
<p>that he might buy Twitter.</p>
<p>These are people who have been absolutely comfortable with, you know, a handful of people</p>
<p>controlling, you know, 95 to 98% of the media distribution in this country, you know, for</p>
<p>years now.</p>
<p>They never ever once complained about it.</p>
<p>Anytime you ever complain about censorship, they say, oh, that&rsquo;s not censorship.</p>
<p>This is a private platform.</p>
<p>They can do whatever they want.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always been the response.</p>
<p>Suddenly Elon Musk comes along and it&rsquo;s, oh my God, the threat of an oligarch taking over</p>
<p>a media platform.</p>
<p>What are we ever going to do?</p>
<p>There were columns like that in the Washington Post, which is owned by Jeff Bezos.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The idea.</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t the New York Times run by a family of four?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really that poor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Five generations.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take a final question from the audience.</p>
<p>So I actually agree with a lot of what&rsquo;s been said here.</p>
<p>And one of my questions is, you know, we were talking about, is Trump even ideologically</p>
<p>a Republican?</p>
<p>My question is, as long as one of them is winning, the Republicans or the Democrats,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t both of them winning?</p>
<p>Like, do you guys have any thoughts on that?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t hear the question.</p>
<p>As long as one of them.</p>
<p>As long as one of them, the Republicans or Democrats are winning, are they collectively</p>
<p>winning?</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t there be a third party?</p>
<p>I mean, isn&rsquo;t that the issue that it&rsquo;s such a binary polarized system?</p>
<p>I think Glenn said in the middle that we are really all more moderates.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my belief.</p>
<p>But just curious.</p>
<p>No, I mean, it&rsquo;s a great, you know, I think probably the worst media myth is that the</p>
<p>two parties can never get along.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no more bipartisanship.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so radically different.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t agree on anything when the reality is they agree on most things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the only things we hear about are the times when they disagree.</p>
<p>But overwhelmingly on foreign policy and economic policy, Obama himself said the two parties</p>
<p>are essentially playing within the 40 yard line.</p>
<p>So the entire rest of the playing field is basically not part of the political process</p>
<p>because they have the same fundamental beliefs.</p>
<p>And I think one of the reasons why Trump was such a shock to the system was not because</p>
<p>the Trump administration itself was a deviation from the American political tradition.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But because some of the things he said, like questioning NATO and whether it has viability,</p>
<p>was designed to undermine that bipartisan consensus.</p>
<p>But I think in general, you&rsquo;re right that the establishment wings of both parties are</p>
<p>far more in agreement with one another than they are different.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re also right that as long as those two wings of each party continue</p>
<p>to trade power, the ruling class in the United States is very happy.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s give it up for Glenn, Matt and Sam.</p>
<p>Thank you everybody.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just</p>
<p>like this, like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a B.</p>
<p>B?</p>
<p>We need to get Merck.</p>
<p>Merck is our back.</p>
