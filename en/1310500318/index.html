    <p>Evolutionarily, if we see a lion running at us,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have time to sort of calculate</p>
<p>the lion&rsquo;s kinetic energy and is it optimal</p>
<p>to go this way or that way, you just react it.</p>
<p>And physically our bodies are well attuned</p>
<p>to actually make right decisions.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re playing a game like poker,</p>
<p>this is not something that you ever evolved to do.</p>
<p>And yet you&rsquo;re in that same flight or fight response.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a really important skill</p>
<p>to be able to develop to basically learn</p>
<p>how to like meditate in the moment and calm yourself</p>
<p>so that you can think clearly.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Liv Burry,</p>
<p>formerly one of the best poker players in the world,</p>
<p>trained as an astrophysicist and is now a philanthropist</p>
<p>and an educator on topics of game theory,</p>
<p>physics, complexity, and life.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Liv Burry.</p>
<p>What role do you think luck plays in poker and in life?</p>
<p>You can pick whichever one you want,</p>
<p>poker or life and or life.</p>
<p>The longer you play, the less influence luck has.</p>
<p>Like with all things, the bigger your sample size,</p>
<p>the more the quality of your decisions</p>
<p>or your strategies matter.</p>
<p>So to answer that question, yeah, in poker,</p>
<p>it really depends.</p>
<p>If you and I sat and played 10 hands right now,</p>
<p>I might only win 52% of the time, 53% maybe.</p>
<p>But if we played 10,000 hands,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll probably win like over 98, 99% of the time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a question of sample sizes.</p>
<p>And what are you figuring out over time?</p>
<p>The betting strategy that this individual does</p>
<p>or literally it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>against any individual over time?</p>
<p>Against any individual over time, the better player</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re making better decisions.</p>
<p>So what does that mean to make a better decision?</p>
<p>Well, to get into the realness of Gritty already,</p>
<p>basically poker is a game of math.</p>
<p>There are these strategies familiar</p>
<p>with like Nash Equilibria, right?</p>
<p>So there are these game theory optimal strategies</p>
<p>that you can adopt.</p>
<p>And the closer you play to them,</p>
<p>the less exploitable you are.</p>
<p>So because I&rsquo;ve studied the game a bunch,</p>
<p>although admittedly not for a few years,</p>
<p>but back when I was playing all the time,</p>
<p>I would study these game theory optimal solutions</p>
<p>and try and then adopt those strategies</p>
<p>when I go and play.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d play against you and I would do that.</p>
<p>And because the objective,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re playing game theory optimal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s a loss minimization thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>Your best bet is to try and play a sort of similar style.</p>
<p>You also need to try and adopt this loss minimization.</p>
<p>But because I&rsquo;ve been playing much longer than you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be better at that.</p>
<p>So first of all, you&rsquo;re not taking advantage</p>
<p>of my mistakes.</p>
<p>But then on top of that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be better at recognizing</p>
<p>when you are playing suboptimally</p>
<p>and then deviating from this game theory optimal strategy</p>
<p>to exploit your bad plays.</p>
<p>Can you define game theory and Nash equilibria?</p>
<p>Can we try to sneak up to it in a bunch of ways?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s a game theory framework of analyzing poker,</p>
<p>analyzing any kind of situation?</p>
<p>So game theory is just basically the study of decisions</p>
<p>within a competitive situation.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s technically a branch of economics,</p>
<p>but it also applies to like wider decision theory.</p>
<p>And usually when you see it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s these like little payoff matrices and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s depicted.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s essentially just like study of strategies</p>
<p>under different competitive situations.</p>
<p>And as it happens, certain games,</p>
<p>in fact, many, many games have these things</p>
<p>called Nash equilibria.</p>
<p>And what that means is when you&rsquo;re in a Nash equilibrium,</p>
<p>basically it is not,</p>
<p>there is no strategy that you can take</p>
<p>that would be more beneficial</p>
<p>than the one you&rsquo;re currently taking,</p>
<p>assuming your opponent is also doing the same thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be a bad idea,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re both playing in a game theory optimal strategy,</p>
<p>if either of us deviate from that,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re putting ourselves at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Rock, paper, scissors</p>
<p>is actually a really great example of this.</p>
<p>Like if we were to start playing rock, paper, scissors,</p>
<p>you know, you know nothing about me</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna play for all our money,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s play 10 rounds of it.</p>
<p>What would your sort of optimal strategy be?</p>
<p>Do you think, what would you do?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>I would probably try to be as random as possible.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You wanna, because you don&rsquo;t know anything about me,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to give anything away about yourself.</p>
<p>So ideally you&rsquo;d have like a little dice</p>
<p>or somewhat, you know, perfect randomizer</p>
<p>that makes you randomize 33% of the time</p>
<p>each of the three different things.</p>
<p>And in response to that,</p>
<p>well, actually I can kind of do anything,</p>
<p>but I would probably just randomize back too,</p>
<p>but actually it wouldn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>because I know that you&rsquo;re playing randomly.</p>
<p>So that would be us in a Nash equilibrium</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re both playing this like unexploitable strategy.</p>
<p>However, if after a while you then notice</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m playing rock a little bit more often than I should.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re the kind of person that would do that,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more of a scissors girl, but anyway.</p>
<p>You are?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m a, as I said, randomizer.</p>
<p>So you notice I&rsquo;m throwing rock too much</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;d be making a mistake</p>
<p>by continuing playing this game theory optimal strategy,</p>
<p>well, the previous one, because you are now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making a mistake and you&rsquo;re not deviating</p>
<p>and exploiting my mistake.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d want to start throwing paper a bit more often</p>
<p>in whatever you figure is the right sort of percentage</p>
<p>of the time that I&rsquo;m throwing rock too often.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s basically an example of where,</p>
<p>what game theory optimal strategy is</p>
<p>in terms of loss minimization,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not always the maximally profitable thing</p>
<p>if your opponent is doing stupid stuff,</p>
<p>which in that example.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of then how it works in poker,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a lot more complex.</p>
<p>And the way poker players typically,</p>
<p>nowadays they study, the games change so much.</p>
<p>And I think we should talk about how it sort of evolved,</p>
<p>but nowadays like the top pros</p>
<p>basically spend all their time in between sessions</p>
<p>running these simulators using like software</p>
<p>where they do basically Monte Carlo simulations,</p>
<p>sort of doing billions of fictitious self play hands.</p>
<p>You input a fictitious hand scenario,</p>
<p>like, oh, what do I do with Jack nine suited</p>
<p>on a King 10 four to two spades board</p>
<p>and against this bet size.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d input that press play,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll run its billions of fake hands</p>
<p>and then it will converge upon</p>
<p>what the game theory optimal strategies are.</p>
<p>And then you wanna try and memorize what these are.</p>
<p>Basically they&rsquo;re like ratios of how often,</p>
<p>what types of hands you want to bluff</p>
<p>and what percentage of the time.</p>
<p>So then there&rsquo;s this additional layer</p>
<p>of inbuilt randomization built in.</p>
<p>Yeah, those kinds of simulations incorporate</p>
<p>all the betting strategies and everything else like that.</p>
<p>So as opposed to some kind of very crude mathematical model</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s the probability you win</p>
<p>just based on the quality of the card,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s including everything else too.</p>
<p>The game theory of it.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, essentially.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is that nowadays,</p>
<p>if you want to be a top pro and you go and play</p>
<p>in these really like the super high stakes tournaments</p>
<p>or tough cash games, if you don&rsquo;t know this stuff,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get eaten alive in the long run.</p>
<p>But of course you could get lucky over the short run</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where this like luck factor comes in</p>
<p>because luck is both a blessing and a curse.</p>
<p>If luck didn&rsquo;t, if there wasn&rsquo;t this random element</p>
<p>and there wasn&rsquo;t the ability for worse players</p>
<p>to win sometimes, then poker would fall apart.</p>
<p>You know, the same reason people don&rsquo;t play chess</p>
<p>professionally for money against,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see people going and hustling chess</p>
<p>like not knowing, trying to make a living from it</p>
<p>because you know there&rsquo;s very little luck in chess,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s quite a lot of luck in poker.</p>
<p>Have you seen Beautiful Mind, that movie?</p>
<p>Years ago.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think about the game theoretic formulation</p>
<p>of what is it, the hot blonde at the bar?</p>
<p>Do you remember?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>What they illustrated is they&rsquo;re trying to pick up a girl</p>
<p>at a bar and there&rsquo;s multiple girls.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like friend, it&rsquo;s like a friend group</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to approach,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the details, but I remember.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you like then speak to her friends first</p>
<p>or something like that, feign disinterest.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s classic pickup artist stuff, right?</p>
<p>You wanna.</p>
<p>And they were trying to correlate that somehow,</p>
<p>that being an optimal strategy game theoretically.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>What, what, like, I don&rsquo;t think, I remember.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine that there is,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s probably an optimal strategy.</p>
<p>Is it, does that mean that there&rsquo;s an actual Nash equilibrium</p>
<p>of like picking up girls?</p>
<p>Do you know the marriage problem?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s optimal stopping.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So where it&rsquo;s an optimal dating strategy</p>
<p>where you, do you remember what it is?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s like something like,</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;ve got like a set of a hundred people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna look through and after,</p>
<p>how many do you, now after that,</p>
<p>after going on this many dates out of a hundred,</p>
<p>at what point do you then go, okay, the next best person I see,</p>
<p>is that the right one?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s like something like 37%.</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s one over E, whatever that is.</p>
<p>Right, which I think is 37%.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna fact check that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, but it&rsquo;s funny under those strict constraints,</p>
<p>then yes, after that many people,</p>
<p>as long as you have a fixed size pool,</p>
<p>then you just pick the next person</p>
<p>that is better than anyone you&rsquo;ve seen before.</p>
<p>Anyone else you&rsquo;ve seen, yeah.</p>
<p>Have you tried this?</p>
<p>Have you incorporated it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one of those people.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna discuss this.</p>
<p>I, and, what do you mean, those people?</p>
<p>I try not to optimize stuff.</p>
<p>I try to listen to the heart.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I like,</p>
<p>my mind immediately is attracted to optimizing everything.</p>
<p>Optimizing everything.</p>
<p>And I think that if you really give in</p>
<p>to that kind of addiction,</p>
<p>that you lose the joy of the small things,</p>
<p>the minutiae of life, I think.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned about the addictive nature</p>
<p>of my personality in that regard.</p>
<p>In some ways,</p>
<p>while I think the, on average,</p>
<p>people under try and quantify things,</p>
<p>or try, under optimize.</p>
<p>There are some people who, you know,</p>
<p>with all these things, it&rsquo;s a balancing act.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on dating apps, but I&rsquo;ve never used them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they have data on this,</p>
<p>because they probably have</p>
<p>the optimal stopping control problem.</p>
<p>Because there aren&rsquo;t a lot of people that use social,</p>
<p>like dating apps, are on there for a long time.</p>
<p>So the interesting aspect is like, all right,</p>
<p>how long before you stop looking</p>
<p>before it actually starts affecting your mind negatively,</p>
<p>such that you see dating as a kind of,</p>
<p>A game.</p>
<p>A kind of game versus an actual process</p>
<p>of finding somebody that&rsquo;s going to make you happy</p>
<p>for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>They have the data.</p>
<p>I wish they would be able to release that data.</p>
<p>And I do want to hop to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s OkCupid, right?</p>
<p>I think they ran a huge, huge study on all of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re more data driven, I think, OkCupid folks are.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunity for dating apps,</p>
<p>in general, even bigger than dating apps,</p>
<p>people connecting on the internet.</p>
<p>I just hope they&rsquo;re more data driven.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t seem that way.</p>
<p>I think like, I&rsquo;ve always thought that</p>
<p>Goodreads should be a dating app.</p>
<p>Like the.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never used it.</p>
<p>After what?</p>
<p>Goodreads is just lists like books that you&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>And allows you to comment on the books you read</p>
<p>and what books you&rsquo;re currently reading.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a giant social networks of people reading books.</p>
<p>And that seems to be a much better database</p>
<p>of like interests.</p>
<p>Of course it constrains you to the books you&rsquo;re reading,</p>
<p>but like that really reveals so much more about the person.</p>
<p>Allows you to discover shared interests</p>
<p>because books are a kind of window</p>
<p>into the way you see the world.</p>
<p>Also like the kind of places,</p>
<p>people you&rsquo;re curious about,</p>
<p>the kind of ideas you&rsquo;re curious about.</p>
<p>Are you a romantic or are you cold calculating rationalist?</p>
<p>Are you into Ayn Rand or are you into Bernie Sanders?</p>
<p>Are you into whatever?</p>
<p>And I feel like that reveals so much more</p>
<p>than like a person trying to look hot</p>
<p>from a certain angle in a Tinder profile.</p>
<p>Well, and it&rsquo;d also be a really great filter</p>
<p>in the first place for people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less people who read books</p>
<p>and are willing to go and rate them</p>
<p>and give feedback on them and so on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s already a really strong filter.</p>
<p>Probably the type of people you&rsquo;d be looking for.</p>
<p>Well, at least be able to fake reading books.</p>
<p>I mean, the thing about books,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really need to read it.</p>
<p>You can just look at the click counts.</p>
<p>Yeah, game the dating app by feigning intellectualism.</p>
<p>Can I admit something very horrible about myself?</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>The things that, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have many things in my closet,</p>
<p>but this is one of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never actually read Shakespeare.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only read Cliff Notes</p>
<p>and I got a five in the AP English exam.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And I&hellip;</p>
<p>Which book?</p>
<p>The which books have I read?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, which was the exam on which book?</p>
<p>Oh no, they include a lot of them.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>But Hamlet, I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>if you read Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember, but I don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like really cryptic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, I don&rsquo;t, and it&rsquo;s not that pleasant to read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like ancient speak.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>Anyway, maybe I was too dumb.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still too dumb, but I did get&hellip;</p>
<p>You got a five, which is&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how the US grading system&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh no, so AP English is a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kind of this advanced versions of courses</p>
<p>in high school, and you take a test</p>
<p>that is like a broad test for that subject</p>
<p>and includes a lot.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t obviously just Shakespeare.</p>
<p>I think a lot of it was also writing, written.</p>
<p>You have like AP Physics, AP Computer Science,</p>
<p>AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and then AP English</p>
<p>or AP Literature, I forget what it was.</p>
<p>But I think Shakespeare was a part of that.</p>
<p>But I&hellip;</p>
<p>And the point is you gamified it?</p>
<p>Gamified.</p>
<p>Well, in entirety, I was into getting As.</p>
<p>I saw it as a game.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think all of the learning I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>has been outside of school.</p>
<p>The deepest learning I&rsquo;ve done has been outside of school</p>
<p>with a few exceptions, especially in grad school,</p>
<p>like deep computer science courses.</p>
<p>But that was still outside of school</p>
<p>because it was outside of getting&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It was outside of getting the A for the course.</p>
<p>The best stuff I&rsquo;ve ever done is when you read the chapter</p>
<p>and you do many of the problems at the end of the chapter,</p>
<p>which is usually not what&rsquo;s required for the course,</p>
<p>like the hardest stuff.</p>
<p>In fact, textbooks are freaking incredible.</p>
<p>If you go back now and you look at like biology textbook</p>
<p>or any of the computer science textbooks</p>
<p>on algorithms and data structures,</p>
<p>those things are incredibly&hellip;</p>
<p>They have the best summary of a subject,</p>
<p>plus they have practice problems of increasing difficulty</p>
<p>that allows you to truly master the basic,</p>
<p>like the fundamental ideas behind that.</p>
<p>I got through my entire physics degree with one textbook</p>
<p>that was just this really comprehensive one</p>
<p>that they told us at the beginning of the first year,</p>
<p>buy this, but you&rsquo;re gonna have to buy 15 other books</p>
<p>for all your supplementary courses.</p>
<p>And I was like, every time I was just checked</p>
<p>to see whether this book covered it and it did.</p>
<p>And I think I only bought like two or three extra</p>
<p>and thank God, cause they&rsquo;re super expensive textbooks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole racket they&rsquo;ve got going on.</p>
<p>Yeah, they are.</p>
<p>They could just&hellip;</p>
<p>You get the right one, it&rsquo;s just like a manual for&hellip;</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting though,</p>
<p>is this is the tyranny of having exams and metrics.</p>
<p>The tyranny of exams and metrics, yes.</p>
<p>I loved them because I&rsquo;m very competitive</p>
<p>and I liked finding ways to gamify things</p>
<p>and then like sort of dust off my shoulders afterwards</p>
<p>when I get a good grade</p>
<p>or be annoyed at myself when I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But yeah, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>And that the actual&hellip;</p>
<p>How much of that physics knowledge I&rsquo;ve retained,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve learned how to cram and study</p>
<p>and please an examiner,</p>
<p>but did that give me the deep lasting knowledge</p>
<p>that I needed?</p>
<p>I mean, yes and no,</p>
<p>but really like nothing makes you learn a topic better</p>
<p>than when you actually then have to teach it yourself.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m trying to wrap my teeth</p>
<p>around this like game theory Moloch stuff right now.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no exam at the end of it that I can gamify.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to gamify</p>
<p>and sort of like shortcut my way through it.</p>
<p>I have to understand it so deeply</p>
<p>from like deep foundational levels</p>
<p>to then to build upon it</p>
<p>and then try and explain it to other people.</p>
<p>And like, you&rsquo;re about to go and do some lectures, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t sort of just like,</p>
<p>you presumably can&rsquo;t rely on the knowledge</p>
<p>that you got through when you were studying for an exam</p>
<p>to reteach that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and especially high level lectures,</p>
<p>especially the kind of stuff you do on YouTube,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just regurgitating material.</p>
<p>You have to think through what is the core idea here.</p>
<p>And when you do the lectures live especially,</p>
<p>you have to, there&rsquo;s no second takes.</p>
<p>That is the luxury you get</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re recording a video for YouTube</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But it definitely is a luxury you shouldn&rsquo;t lean on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to interact with a few YouTubers</p>
<p>that lean on that too much.</p>
<p>And you realize, oh, you&rsquo;ve gamified this system</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not really thinking deeply about stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re through the edit,</p>
<p>both written and spoken,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re crafting an amazing video,</p>
<p>but you yourself as a human being</p>
<p>have not really deeply understood it.</p>
<p>So live teaching or at least recording video</p>
<p>with very few takes is a different beast.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s the most honest way of doing it,</p>
<p>like as few takes as possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m nervous about this.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go back and be like, ah, let&rsquo;s do that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fuck this up, Liv.</p>
<p>The tyranny of exams.</p>
<p>I do think people talk about high school and college</p>
<p>as a time to do drugs and drink and have fun</p>
<p>and all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But looking back, of course I did a lot of those things.</p>
<p>Yes, no, yes, but it&rsquo;s also a time</p>
<p>when you get to read textbooks or read books</p>
<p>or learn with all the time in the world.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have these responsibilities of laundry</p>
<p>and having to sort of pay for mortgage,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, pay taxes, all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>In most cases, there&rsquo;s just so much time in the day</p>
<p>for learning and you don&rsquo;t realize it at the time</p>
<p>because at the time it seems like a chore,</p>
<p>like why the hell does there&rsquo;s so much homework?</p>
<p>But you never get a chance to do this kind of learning,</p>
<p>this kind of homework ever again in life,</p>
<p>unless later in life you really make a big effort out of it.</p>
<p>Like basically your knowledge gets solidified.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to have fun and learn.</p>
<p>Learning is really fulfilling and really fun</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re that kind of person.</p>
<p>Like some people like, you know,</p>
<p>like knowledge is not something that they think is fun.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s the kind of thing that you think is fun,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the time to have fun and do the drugs and drink</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But the learning, just going back to those textbooks,</p>
<p>the hours spent with the textbooks</p>
<p>is really, really rewarding.</p>
<p>Do people even use textbooks anymore?</p>
<p>Yeah. Do you think?</p>
<p>Kids these days with their TikTok and their&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, not even that, but it&rsquo;s just like so much information,</p>
<p>really high quality information,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s now in digital format online.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they&rsquo;re not, they are using that,</p>
<p>but you know, college is still very, there&rsquo;s a curriculum.</p>
<p>I mean, so much of school is about rigorous study</p>
<p>of a subject and still on YouTube, that&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>Right. YouTube has,</p>
<p>YouTube has, Grant Sanderson talks about this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s this math&hellip;</p>
<p>3Blue1Brown.</p>
<p>Yeah, 3Blue1Brown.</p>
<p>He says like, I&rsquo;m not a math teacher.</p>
<p>I just take really cool concepts and I inspire people.</p>
<p>But if you wanna really learn calculus,</p>
<p>if you wanna really learn linear algebra,</p>
<p>you should do the textbook.</p>
<p>You should do that, you know.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s still the textbook industrial complex</p>
<p>that like charges like $200 for textbook and somehow,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re like, oh, sorry, new edition, edition 14.6.</p>
<p>Sorry, you can&rsquo;t use 14.5 anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s different?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got one paragraph different.</p>
<p>So we mentioned offline, Daniel Negrano.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get a chance to talk to him on this podcast.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s somebody that I found fascinating</p>
<p>in terms of the way he thinks about poker,</p>
<p>verbalizes the way he thinks about poker,</p>
<p>the way he plays poker.</p>
<p>So, and he&rsquo;s still pretty damn good.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been good for a long time.</p>
<p>So you mentioned that people are running</p>
<p>these kinds of simulations and the game of poker has changed.</p>
<p>Do you think he&rsquo;s adapting in this way?</p>
<p>Like the top pros, do they have to adopt this way?</p>
<p>Or is there still like over the years,</p>
<p>you basically develop this gut feeling about,</p>
<p>like you get to be like good the way,</p>
<p>like alpha zero is good.</p>
<p>You look at the board and somehow from the fog</p>
<p>comes out the right answer.</p>
<p>Like this is likely what they have.</p>
<p>This is likely the best way to move.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t really, you can&rsquo;t really put a finger</p>
<p>on exactly why, but it just comes from your gut feeling.</p>
<p>Or no?</p>
<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>So gut feelings are definitely very important.</p>
<p>You know, that we&rsquo;ve got our two,</p>
<p>you can distill it down to two modes</p>
<p>of decision making, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got your sort of logical linear voice in your head,</p>
<p>system two, as it&rsquo;s often called,</p>
<p>and your system one, your gut intuition.</p>
<p>And historically in poker,</p>
<p>the very best players were playing</p>
<p>almost entirely by their gut.</p>
<p>You know, often they do some kind of inspired play</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d ask them why they do it</p>
<p>and they wouldn&rsquo;t really be able to explain it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not so much because their process</p>
<p>was unintelligible, but it was more just because</p>
<p>no one had the language with which to describe</p>
<p>what optimal strategies were</p>
<p>because no one really understood how poker worked.</p>
<p>This was before, you know, we had analysis software.</p>
<p>You know, no one was writing,</p>
<p>I guess some people would write down their hands</p>
<p>in a little notebook,</p>
<p>but there was no way to assimilate all this data</p>
<p>and analyze it.</p>
<p>But then, you know, when computers became cheaper</p>
<p>and software started emerging,</p>
<p>and then obviously online poker,</p>
<p>where it would like automatically save your hand histories.</p>
<p>Now, all of a sudden you kind of had this body of data</p>
<p>that you could run analysis on.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s when people started to see, you know,</p>
<p>these mathematical solutions.</p>
<p>And so what that meant is the role of intuition</p>
<p>essentially became smaller.</p>
<p>And it went more into, as we talked before about,</p>
<p>you know, this game theory optimal style.</p>
<p>But also, as I said, like game theory optimal</p>
<p>is about loss minimization and being unexploitable.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re playing against people who aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because no person, no human being can play perfectly</p>
<p>game theory optimal in poker, not even the best AIs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still like, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re 99.99% of the way there or whatever,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of like the speed of light.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t reach it perfectly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s still a role for intuition?</p>
<p>Yes, so when, yeah,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re playing this unexploitable style,</p>
<p>but when your opponents start doing something,</p>
<p>you know, suboptimal that you want to exploit,</p>
<p>well, now that&rsquo;s where not only your like logical brain</p>
<p>will need to be thinking, well, okay,</p>
<p>I know I have this, I&rsquo;m in the sort of top end</p>
<p>of my range here with this hand.</p>
<p>So that means I need to be calling X percent of the time</p>
<p>and I put them on this range, et cetera.</p>
<p>But then sometimes you&rsquo;ll have this gut feeling</p>
<p>that will tell you, you know what, this time,</p>
<p>I know mathematically I&rsquo;m meant to call now.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m in the sort of top end of my range</p>
<p>and this is the odds I&rsquo;m getting.</p>
<p>So the math says I should call,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something in your gut saying,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got it this time, they&rsquo;ve got it.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re beating you, your hand is worse.</p>
<p>So then the real art,</p>
<p>this is where the last remaining art in poker,</p>
<p>the fuzziness is like, do you listen to your gut?</p>
<p>How do you quantify the strength of it?</p>
<p>Or can you even quantify the strength of it?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what Daniel has.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t speak for how much he&rsquo;s studying</p>
<p>with the simulators and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I think he has, like he must be to still be keeping up.</p>
<p>But he has an incredible intuition for just,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s seen so many hands of poker in the flesh.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s seen so many people, the way they behave</p>
<p>when the chips are, you know, when the money&rsquo;s on the line</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ve got him staring you down in the eye.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s intimidating.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got this like kind of X factor vibe</p>
<p>that he, you know, gives out.</p>
<p>And he talks a lot, which is an interactive element,</p>
<p>which is he&rsquo;s getting stuff from other people.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>And just like the subtlety.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s probing constantly.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s probing and he&rsquo;s getting this extra layer</p>
<p>of information that others can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now that said though, he&rsquo;s good online as well.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know how, again,</p>
<p>would he be beating the top cash game players online?</p>
<p>Probably not, no.</p>
<p>But when he&rsquo;s in person and he&rsquo;s got that additional</p>
<p>layer of information, he can not only extract it,</p>
<p>but he knows what to do with it still so well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one player who I would say is the exception</p>
<p>to all of this.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s one of my favorite people to talk about</p>
<p>in terms of, I think he might have cracked the simulation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Phil Helmuth.</p>
<p>He&hellip;</p>
<p>In more ways than one, he&rsquo;s cracked the simulation,</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, he somehow to this day is still</p>
<p>and I love you Phil, I&rsquo;m not in any way knocking you.</p>
<p>He is still winning so much at the World Series</p>
<p>of Poker specifically.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now won 16 bracelets.</p>
<p>The next nearest person I think has won 10.</p>
<p>And he is consistently year in, year out going deep</p>
<p>or winning these huge field tournaments,</p>
<p>you know, with like 2000 people,</p>
<p>which statistically he should not be doing.</p>
<p>And yet you watch some of the plays he makes</p>
<p>and they make no sense, like mathematically,</p>
<p>they are so far from game theory optimal.</p>
<p>And the thing is, if you went and stuck him</p>
<p>in one of these high stakes cash games</p>
<p>with a bunch of like GTO people,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna get ripped apart.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something that he has that when he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the halls of the World Series of Poker specifically,</p>
<p>amongst sort of amateurish players,</p>
<p>he gets them to do crazy shit like that.</p>
<p>And, but my little pet theory is that also,</p>
<p>he just, the card, he&rsquo;s like a wizard</p>
<p>and he gets the cards to do what he needs them to.</p>
<p>Because he just expects to win and he expects to receive,</p>
<p>you know, to get flopper set with a frequency far beyond</p>
<p>what the real percentages are.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even know if he knows what the real percentages</p>
<p>are, he doesn&rsquo;t need to, because he gets there.</p>
<p>I think he has found the Chico,</p>
<p>because when I&rsquo;ve seen him play,</p>
<p>he seems to be like annoyed that the long shot thing</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like annoyed and it&rsquo;s almost like everybody else</p>
<p>is stupid because he was obviously going to win</p>
<p>with the spare.</p>
<p>If that silly thing hadn&rsquo;t happened.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>the silly thing happens 99% of the time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a 1%, not the other way around,</p>
<p>but genuinely for his lived experience at the World Series,</p>
<p>only at the World Series of Poker, it is like that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t blame him for feeling that way.</p>
<p>But he does, he has this X factor</p>
<p>and the poker community has tried for years</p>
<p>to rip him down saying like, he&rsquo;s no good,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s clearly good because he&rsquo;s still winning</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s something going on.</p>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s figured out how to mess</p>
<p>with the fabric of reality and how cards,</p>
<p>a randomly shuffled deck of cards come out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but he&rsquo;s doing it right still.</p>
<p>Who do you think is the greatest of all time?</p>
<p>Would you put Hellmuth?</p>
<p>Not Hellmuth definitely, he seems like the kind of person</p>
<p>when mentioned he would actually watch this.</p>
<p>So you might wanna be careful.</p>
<p>Well, as I said, I love Phil and I have,</p>
<p>I would say this to his face, I&rsquo;m not saying anything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;s got, he truly, I mean,</p>
<p>he is one of the greatest.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s the greatest,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s certainly the greatest at the World Series of Poker.</p>
<p>And he is the greatest at, despite the game switching</p>
<p>into a pure game, almost an entire game of math,</p>
<p>he has managed to keep the magic alive.</p>
<p>And this like, just through sheer force of will,</p>
<p>making the game work for him.</p>
<p>And that is incredible.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s something that should be studied</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>Yeah, there might be some actual game theoretic wisdom.</p>
<p>There might be something to be said about optimality</p>
<p>from studying him.</p>
<p>What do you mean by optimality?</p>
<p>Meaning, or rather game design, perhaps.</p>
<p>Meaning if what he&rsquo;s doing is working,</p>
<p>maybe poker is more complicated</p>
<p>than the one we&rsquo;re currently modeling it as.</p>
<p>So like his, yeah.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s an extra layer,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean to get too weird and wooey,</p>
<p>but, or there&rsquo;s an extra layer of ability</p>
<p>to manipulate the things the way you want them to go</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t understand yet.</p>
<p>Do you think Phil Hellmuth understands them?</p>
<p>Is he just generally?</p>
<p>Hashtag positivity.</p>
<p>Well, he wrote a book on positivity and he&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He has, he did, not like a trolling book.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just straight up, yeah.</p>
<p>Phil Hellmuth wrote a book about positivity.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, not ironic.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s about sort of manifesting what you want</p>
<p>and getting the outcomes that you want</p>
<p>by believing so much in yourself</p>
<p>and in your ability to win,</p>
<p>like eyes on the prize.</p>
<p>And I mean, it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s delivered.</p>
<p>But where do you put like Phil Ivey</p>
<p>and all those kinds of people?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m too, I&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>to be honest too much out of the scene</p>
<p>for the last few years to really,</p>
<p>I mean, Phil Ivey&rsquo;s clearly got,</p>
<p>again, he&rsquo;s got that X factor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so incredibly intimidating to play against.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only played against him a couple of times,</p>
<p>but when he like looks you in the eye</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to run a bluff on him,</p>
<p>oof, no one&rsquo;s made me sweat harder than Phil Ivey,</p>
<p>just my bluff got through actually.</p>
<p>That was actually one of the most thrilling moments</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever had in poker was,</p>
<p>it was in a Monte Carlo in a high roller.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember exactly what the hand was,</p>
<p>but I, you know, a three bit</p>
<p>and then like just barreled all the way through.</p>
<p>And he just like put his laser eyes into me.</p>
<p>And I felt like he was just scouring my soul.</p>
<p>And I was just like, hold it together, Liv,</p>
<p>hold it together.</p>
<p>And he was like, folded.</p>
<p>And you knew your hand was weaker.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I was bluffing.</p>
<p>I presume, which, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a chance I was bluffing with the best hand,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty sure my hand was worse.</p>
<p>And he folded.</p>
<p>I was truly one of the deep highlights of my career.</p>
<p>Did you show the cards or did you fold?</p>
<p>You should never show in game.</p>
<p>Like, because especially as I felt like</p>
<p>I was one of the worst players at the table</p>
<p>in that tournament.</p>
<p>So giving that information,</p>
<p>unless I had a really solid plan</p>
<p>that I was now like advertising,</p>
<p>oh, look, I&rsquo;m capable of bluffing Phil Ivey.</p>
<p>But like, why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more valuable to take advantage</p>
<p>of the impression that they have of me,</p>
<p>which is like, I&rsquo;m a scared girl</p>
<p>playing a high roller for the first time.</p>
<p>Keep that going, you know.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t there layers to this?</p>
<p>Like psychological warfare</p>
<p>that the scared girl might be way smart</p>
<p>and then like just to flip the tables?</p>
<p>Do you think about that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Or is it better not to reveal information?</p>
<p>I mean, generally speaking,</p>
<p>you want to not reveal information.</p>
<p>You know, the goal of poker is to be</p>
<p>as deceptive as possible about your own strategies</p>
<p>while elucidating as much out of your opponent</p>
<p>about their own.</p>
<p>So giving them free information,</p>
<p>particularly if they&rsquo;re people</p>
<p>who you consider very good players,</p>
<p>any information I give them is going into</p>
<p>their little database and being,</p>
<p>I assume it&rsquo;s going to be calculated and used well.</p>
<p>So I have to be really confident</p>
<p>that my like meta gaming that I&rsquo;m going to then do,</p>
<p>oh, they&rsquo;ve seen this, so therefore that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be on the right level.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s better just to keep that little secret</p>
<p>to myself in the moment.</p>
<p>So how much is bluffing part of the game?</p>
<p>Huge amount.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, maybe actually let me ask,</p>
<p>like, what did it feel like with Phil Ivey</p>
<p>or anyone else when it&rsquo;s a high stake,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s a big, it&rsquo;s a big bluff?</p>
<p>So a lot of money on the table and maybe,</p>
<p>I mean, what defines a big bluff?</p>
<p>Maybe a lot of money on the table,</p>
<p>but also some uncertainty in your mind and heart</p>
<p>about like self doubt.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I miscalculated what&rsquo;s going on here,</p>
<p>what the bet said, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Like, what does that feel like?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, I imagine comparable to,</p>
<p>you know, running a, I mean, any kind of big bluff</p>
<p>where you have a lot of something</p>
<p>that you care about on the line.</p>
<p>You know, so if you&rsquo;re bluffing in a courtroom,</p>
<p>not that anyone should ever do that,</p>
<p>or, you know, something equatable to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, in that scenario, you know,</p>
<p>I think it was the first time I&rsquo;d ever played a 20,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d won my way into this 25K tournament.</p>
<p>So that was the buy in 25,000 euros.</p>
<p>And I had satelliteed my way in</p>
<p>because it was much bigger</p>
<p>than I would ever normally play.</p>
<p>And, you know, I hadn&rsquo;t, I wasn&rsquo;t that experienced</p>
<p>at the time, and now I was sitting there</p>
<p>against all the big boys, you know,</p>
<p>the Negronus, the Phil Ivey&rsquo;s and so on.</p>
<p>And then to like, you know,</p>
<p>each time you put the bets out, you know,</p>
<p>you put another bet out, your card.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was on what&rsquo;s called a semi bluff.</p>
<p>So there were some cards that could come</p>
<p>that would make my hand very, very strong</p>
<p>and therefore win.</p>
<p>But most of the time, those cards don&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>So that is a semi bluff because you&rsquo;re representing,</p>
<p>are you representing that you already have something?</p>
<p>So I think in this scenario, I had a flush draw.</p>
<p>So I had two clubs, two clubs came out on the flop.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m hoping that on the turn</p>
<p>and the river, one will come.</p>
<p>So I have some future equity.</p>
<p>I could hit a club and then I&rsquo;ll have the best hand</p>
<p>in which case, great.</p>
<p>And so I can keep betting and I&rsquo;ll want them to call,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also got the other way of winning the hand</p>
<p>where if my card doesn&rsquo;t come,</p>
<p>I can keep betting and get them to fold their hand.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s what the scenario was.</p>
<p>So I had some future equity, but it&rsquo;s still, you know,</p>
<p>most of the time I don&rsquo;t hit that club.</p>
<p>And so I would rather him just fold because I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>the pot is now getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>And in the end, like I&rsquo;ve jam all in on the river.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my entire tournament on the line.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m aware, this might be the one time</p>
<p>I ever get to play a big 25K.</p>
<p>You know, this was the first time I played one.</p>
<p>So it was, it felt like the most momentous thing.</p>
<p>And this was also when I was trying to build myself up at,</p>
<p>you know, build my name, a name for myself in poker.</p>
<p>I wanted to get respect.</p>
<p>Destroy everything for you.</p>
<p>It felt like it in the moment.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, it literally does feel</p>
<p>like a form of life and death.</p>
<p>Like your body physiologically</p>
<p>is having that flight or fight response.</p>
<p>What are you doing with your body?</p>
<p>What are you doing with your face?</p>
<p>Are you just like, what are you thinking about?</p>
<p>More of a mixture of like, okay, what are the cards?</p>
<p>So in theory, I&rsquo;m thinking about like, okay,</p>
<p>what are cards that make my hand look stronger?</p>
<p>Which cards hit my perceived range from his perspective?</p>
<p>Which cards don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the right amount of bet size</p>
<p>to maximize my fold equity in this situation?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s the logical stuff</p>
<p>that I should be thinking about.</p>
<p>But I think in reality, because I was so scared,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this, at least for me,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain threshold of like nervousness or stress</p>
<p>beyond which the logical brain shuts off.</p>
<p>And now it just gets into this like,</p>
<p>just like, it feels like a game of wits, basically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like of nerve.</p>
<p>Can you hold your resolve?</p>
<p>And it certainly got by that, like by the river.</p>
<p>I think by that point, I was like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if this is a good bluff anymore,</p>
<p>but fuck it, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Your mind is almost numb from the intensity of that feeling.</p>
<p>I call it the white noise.</p>
<p>And it happens in all kinds of decision making.</p>
<p>I think anything that&rsquo;s really, really stressful.</p>
<p>I can imagine someone in like an important job interview,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s like a job they&rsquo;ve always wanted,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting grilled, you know,</p>
<p>like Bridgewater style, where they ask these really hard,</p>
<p>like mathematical questions.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a really learned skill</p>
<p>to be able to like subdue your flight or fight response.</p>
<p>You know, I think get from the sympathetic</p>
<p>into the parasympathetic.</p>
<p>So you can actually, you know, engage that voice</p>
<p>in your head and do those slow logical calculations.</p>
<p>Because evolutionarily, you know, if we see a lion</p>
<p>running at us, we didn&rsquo;t have time to sort of calculate</p>
<p>the lion&rsquo;s kinetic energy and, you know,</p>
<p>is it optimal to go this way or that way?</p>
<p>You just react it.</p>
<p>And physically, our bodies are well attuned</p>
<p>to actually make right decisions.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re playing a game like poker,</p>
<p>this is not something that you ever, you know,</p>
<p>evolved to do.</p>
<p>And yet you&rsquo;re in that same flight or fight response.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a really important skill to be able to develop</p>
<p>to basically learn how to like meditate in the moment</p>
<p>and calm yourself so that you can think clearly.</p>
<p>But as you were searching for a comparable thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting because you just made me realize</p>
<p>that bluffing is like an incredibly high stakes</p>
<p>form of lying.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re lying.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think you can.</p>
<p>Telling a story.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s straight up lying.</p>
<p>In the context of game, it&rsquo;s not a negative kind of lying.</p>
<p>But it is, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re representing something that you don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>And I was thinking like how often in life</p>
<p>do we have such high stakes of lying?</p>
<p>Because I was thinking certainly</p>
<p>in high level military strategy,</p>
<p>I was thinking when Hitler was lying to Stalin</p>
<p>about his plans to invade the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re talking to a person like your friends</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fighting against the enemy,</p>
<p>whatever the formulation of the enemy is.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, whole time you&rsquo;re building up troops</p>
<p>on the border.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s extremely.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, so Hitler and Stalin were like</p>
<p>pretending to be friends?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, my history knowledge is terrible.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, that they were, oh man.</p>
<p>And it worked because Stalin,</p>
<p>until the troops crossed the border</p>
<p>and invaded in Operation Barbarossa</p>
<p>where this storm of Nazi troops</p>
<p>invaded large parts of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And hence, one of the biggest wars in human history began.</p>
<p>Stalin for sure thought that this was never going to be,</p>
<p>that Hitler is not crazy enough to invade the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And it makes, geopolitically makes total sense</p>
<p>to be collaborators.</p>
<p>And ideologically, even though there&rsquo;s a tension</p>
<p>between communism and fascism or national socialism,</p>
<p>however you formulate it,</p>
<p>it still feels like this is the right way</p>
<p>to battle the West.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They were more ideologically aligned.</p>
<p>They in theory had a common enemy, which is the West.</p>
<p>So it made total sense.</p>
<p>And in terms of negotiations</p>
<p>and the way things were communicated,</p>
<p>it seemed to Stalin that for sure,</p>
<p>that they would remain, at least for a while,</p>
<p>peaceful collaborators.</p>
<p>And that, and everybody, because of that,</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union believed that it was a huge shock</p>
<p>when Kiev was invaded.</p>
<p>And you hear echoes of that when I travel to Ukraine,</p>
<p>sort of the shock of the invasion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the invasion on one particular border,</p>
<p>but the invasion of the capital city.</p>
<p>And just like, holy shit, especially at that time,</p>
<p>when you thought World War I,</p>
<p>you realized that that was the war to end all wars.</p>
<p>You would never have this kind of war.</p>
<p>And holy shit, this person is mad enough</p>
<p>to try to take on this monster in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s no longer going to be a war</p>
<p>of hundreds of thousands dead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a war of tens of millions dead.</p>
<p>And yeah, but that, that&rsquo;s a very large scale kind of lie,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s in politics and geopolitics,</p>
<p>that kind of lying happening all the time.</p>
<p>And a lot of people pay financially</p>
<p>and with their lives for that kind of lying.</p>
<p>But in our personal lives, I don&rsquo;t know how often we,</p>
<p>maybe we.</p>
<p>I think people do.</p>
<p>I mean, like think of spouses</p>
<p>cheating on their partners, right?</p>
<p>And then like having to lie,</p>
<p>like where were you last night?</p>
<p>Stuff like that. Oh shit, that&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s, I think, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>unfortunately that stuff happens all the time, right?</p>
<p>Or having like multiple families, that one is great.</p>
<p>When each family doesn&rsquo;t know about the other one</p>
<p>and like maintaining that life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a sense of excitement about that too.</p>
<p>Or. It seems unnecessary, yeah.</p>
<p>But. Why?</p>
<p>Well, just lying.</p>
<p>Like, you know, the truth finds a way of coming out.</p>
<p>You know? Yes.</p>
<p>But hence that&rsquo;s the thrill.</p>
<p>Yeah, perhaps.</p>
<p>Yeah, people.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, that&rsquo;s why I think actually like poker.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so interesting about poker</p>
<p>is most of the best players I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always exceptions, you know?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always bad eggs.</p>
<p>But actually poker players are very honest people.</p>
<p>I would say they are more honest than the average,</p>
<p>you know, if you just took random population sample.</p>
<p>Because A, you know, I think, you know,</p>
<p>humans like to have that.</p>
<p>Most people like to have some kind of, you know,</p>
<p>mysterious, you know, an opportunity to do something</p>
<p>like a little edgy.</p>
<p>So we get to sort of scratch that itch</p>
<p>of being edgy at the poker table,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s part of the game.</p>
<p>Everyone knows what they&rsquo;re in for, and that&rsquo;s allowed.</p>
<p>And you get to like really get that out of your system.</p>
<p>And then also like poker players learned that, you know,</p>
<p>I would play in a huge game against some of my friends,</p>
<p>even my partner, Igor, where we will be, you know,</p>
<p>absolutely going at each other&rsquo;s throats,</p>
<p>trying to draw blood in terms of winning each money</p>
<p>off each other and like getting under each other&rsquo;s skin,</p>
<p>winding each other up, doing the craftiest moves we can.</p>
<p>But then once the game&rsquo;s done, you know,</p>
<p>the winners and the losers will go off</p>
<p>and get a drink together and have a fun time</p>
<p>and like talk about it in this like weird academic way</p>
<p>afterwards, because, and that&rsquo;s why games are so great.</p>
<p>Cause you get to like live out like this competitive urge</p>
<p>that, you know, most people have.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it feel like to lose?</p>
<p>Like we talked about bluffing when it worked out.</p>
<p>What about when you, when you go broke?</p>
<p>So like in a game, I&rsquo;m, fortunately I&rsquo;ve never gone broke.</p>
<p>You mean like full life?</p>
<p>Full life, no.</p>
<p>I know plenty of people who have.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think Igor would mind me saying he went,</p>
<p>you know, he went broke once in poker bowl, you know,</p>
<p>early on when we were together.</p>
<p>I feel like you haven&rsquo;t lived unless you&rsquo;ve gone broke.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Some sense.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Some fundamental sense.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m happy, I&rsquo;ve sort of lived through it,</p>
<p>vicariously through him when he did it at the time.</p>
<p>But yeah, what&rsquo;s it like to lose?</p>
<p>Well, it depends.</p>
<p>So it depends on the amount.</p>
<p>It depends what percentage of your net worth</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve just lost.</p>
<p>It depends on your brain chemistry.</p>
<p>It really, you know, varies from person to person.</p>
<p>You have a very cold calculating way of thinking about this.</p>
<p>So it depends what percentage.</p>
<p>Well, it did, it really does, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s another thing poker trains you to do.</p>
<p>You see, you see everything in percentages</p>
<p>or you see everything in like ROI or expected hourlies</p>
<p>or cost benefit, et cetera.</p>
<p>You know, so that&rsquo;s, one of the things I&rsquo;ve tried to do</p>
<p>is calibrate the strength of my emotional response</p>
<p>to the win or loss that I&rsquo;ve received.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s no good if you like, you know,</p>
<p>you have a huge emotional dramatic response to a tiny loss</p>
<p>or on the flip side, you have a huge win</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sort of so dead inside</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t even feel it.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s a shame.</p>
<p>I want my emotions to calibrate with reality</p>
<p>as much as possible.</p>
<p>So yeah, what&rsquo;s it like to lose?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve had times where I&rsquo;ve lost, you know,</p>
<p>busted out of a tournament that I thought I was gonna win in</p>
<p>especially if I got really unlucky or I make a dumb play</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve gone away and like, you know, kicked the wall,</p>
<p>punched a wall, I like nearly broke my hand one time.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a lot less competitive than I used to be.</p>
<p>Like I was like pathologically competitive in my like</p>
<p>late teens, early twenties, I just had to win at everything.</p>
<p>And I think that sort of slowly waned as I&rsquo;ve gotten older.</p>
<p>According to you, yeah.</p>
<p>According to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if others would say the same, right?</p>
<p>I feel like ultra competitive people,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve heard Joe Rogan say this to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that he&rsquo;s a lot less competitive</p>
<p>than he used to be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>Oh, I believe it.</p>
<p>No, I totally believe it.</p>
<p>Like, because as you get, you can still be,</p>
<p>like I care about winning.</p>
<p>Like when, you know, I play a game with my buddies online</p>
<p>or, you know, whatever it is,</p>
<p>polytopia is my current obsession.</p>
<p>Like when I.</p>
<p>Thank you for passing on your obsession to me.</p>
<p>Are you playing now?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m playing now.</p>
<p>We gotta have a game.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m terrible and I enjoy playing terribly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna have a game because that&rsquo;s gonna pull me</p>
<p>into your monster of like a competitive play.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important, it&rsquo;s an important skill.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying playing on the, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You just do the points thing, you know, against the bots.</p>
<p>Yeah, against the bots.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t even do the, there&rsquo;s like a hard one</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a very hard one.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s crazy, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t even enjoy the hard one.</p>
<p>The crazy, I really don&rsquo;t enjoy.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s intense.</p>
<p>You have to constantly try to win</p>
<p>as opposed to enjoy building a little world and.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, no.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no time for exploration in polytopia.</p>
<p>You gotta get.</p>
<p>Well, when, once you graduate from the crazies,</p>
<p>then you can come play the.</p>
<p>Graduate from the crazies.</p>
<p>Yeah, so in order to be able to play a decent game</p>
<p>against like, you know, our group,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll need to be, you&rsquo;ll need to be consistently winning</p>
<p>like 90% of games against 15 crazy bots.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll be able to, like there&rsquo;ll be,</p>
<p>I could teach you it within a day, honestly.</p>
<p>How to beat the crazies?</p>
<p>How to beat the crazies.</p>
<p>And then, and then you&rsquo;ll be ready for the big leagues.</p>
<p>Generalizes to more than just polytopia.</p>
<p>But okay, why were we talking about polytopia?</p>
<p>Losing hurts.</p>
<p>Losing hurts, oh yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, competitiveness over time.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more that, at least for me,</p>
<p>I still care about playing,</p>
<p>about winning when I choose to play something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t see the world</p>
<p>as zero sum as I used to be, you know?</p>
<p>I think as one gets older and wiser,</p>
<p>you start to see the world more as a positive something.</p>
<p>Or at least you&rsquo;re more aware of externalities,</p>
<p>of scenarios, of competitive interactions.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I just like, I&rsquo;m more,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m more aware of my own, you know, like,</p>
<p>if I have a really strong emotional response to losing,</p>
<p>and that makes me then feel shitty for the rest of the day,</p>
<p>and then I beat myself up mentally for it.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m now more aware</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s unnecessary negative externality.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, okay, I need to find a way to turn this down,</p>
<p>you know, dial this down a bit.</p>
<p>Was poker the thing that has,</p>
<p>if you think back at your life,</p>
<p>and think about some of the lower points of your life,</p>
<p>like the darker places you&rsquo;ve got in your mind,</p>
<p>did it have to do something with poker?</p>
<p>Like, did losing spark the descent into darkness,</p>
<p>or was it something else?</p>
<p>I think my darkest points in poker</p>
<p>were when I was wanting to quit and move on to other things,</p>
<p>but I felt like I hadn&rsquo;t ticked all the boxes</p>
<p>I wanted to tick.</p>
<p>Like, I wanted to be the most winningest female player,</p>
<p>which is by itself a bad goal.</p>
<p>You know, that was one of my initial goals,</p>
<p>and I was like, well, I haven&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>and I wanted to win a WPT event.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve won one of these, I&rsquo;ve won one of these,</p>
<p>but I want one of those as well.</p>
<p>And that sort of, again, like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a drive of like overoptimization to random metrics</p>
<p>that I decided were important</p>
<p>without much wisdom at the time, but then like carried on.</p>
<p>That made me continue chasing it longer</p>
<p>than I still actually had the passion to chase it for.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have any regrets that, you know,</p>
<p>I played for as long as I did, because who knows,</p>
<p>you know, I wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting here,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be living this incredible life</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m living now.</p>
<p>This is the height of your life right now.</p>
<p>This is it, peak experience, absolute pinnacle</p>
<p>here in your robot land with your creepy light.</p>
<p>No, it is, I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing</p>
<p>about my life right now, and I feel very blessed to say that.</p>
<p>So, but the dark times were in the sort of like 2016 to 18,</p>
<p>even sooner really, where I was like,</p>
<p>I had stopped loving the game,</p>
<p>and I was going through the motions,</p>
<p>and I would, and then I was like, you know,</p>
<p>I would take the losses harder than I needed to,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like, ah, it&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>And it was, I was aware that like,</p>
<p>I felt like my life was ticking away,</p>
<p>and I was like, is this gonna be what&rsquo;s on my tombstone?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, she played the game of, you know,</p>
<p>this zero sum game of poker,</p>
<p>slightly more optimally than her next opponent.</p>
<p>Like, cool, great, legacy, you know?</p>
<p>So, I just wanted, you know, there was something in me</p>
<p>that knew I needed to be doing something</p>
<p>more directly impactful and just meaningful.</p>
<p>It was just like your search for meaning,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s a thing a lot of poker players,</p>
<p>even a lot of, I imagine any games players</p>
<p>who sort of love intellectual pursuits,</p>
<p>you know, I think you should ask Magnus Carlsen</p>
<p>this question, I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s on.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s walking away from chess, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, like, it must be so hard for him.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s been on the top for so long,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, well, now what?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got this incredible brain, like, what to put it to?</p>
<p>And, yeah, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this weird moment where I&rsquo;ve just spoken with people</p>
<p>that won multiple gold medals at the Olympics,</p>
<p>and the depression hits hard after you win.</p>
<p>Dopamine crash.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a kind of a goodbye,</p>
<p>saying goodbye to that person,</p>
<p>to all the dreams you had that thought,</p>
<p>you thought would give meaning to your life,</p>
<p>but in fact, life is full of constant pursuits of meaning.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t like arrive and figure it all out,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s endless bliss,</p>
<p>and it continues going on and on.</p>
<p>You constantly have to figure out to rediscover yourself.</p>
<p>And so for you, like that struggle to say goodbye to poker,</p>
<p>you have to like find the next.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a bigger game.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my motto is like, what&rsquo;s the next game?</p>
<p>And more importantly,</p>
<p>because obviously game usually implies zero sum,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s a game which is like Omni win?</p>
<p>Like what? Omni win.</p>
<p>Omni win.</p>
<p>Why is Omni win so important?</p>
<p>Because if everyone plays zero sum games,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fast track to either completely stagnate</p>
<p>as a civilization, but more actually,</p>
<p>far more likely to extinct ourselves.</p>
<p>You know, like the playing field is finite.</p>
<p>You know, nuclear powers are playing,</p>
<p>you know, a game of poker with, you know,</p>
<p>but their chips are nuclear weapons, right?</p>
<p>And the stakes have gotten so large</p>
<p>that if anyone makes a single bet, you know,</p>
<p>fires some weapons, the playing field breaks.</p>
<p>I made a video on this.</p>
<p>Like, you know, the playing field is finite.</p>
<p>And if we keep playing these adversarial zero sum games,</p>
<p>thinking that we, you know,</p>
<p>in order for us to win, someone else has to lose,</p>
<p>or if we lose that, you know, someone else wins,</p>
<p>that will extinct us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of when.</p>
<p>What do you think about that mutually assured destruction,</p>
<p>that very simple,</p>
<p>almost to the point of caricaturing game theory idea</p>
<p>that does seem to be at the core</p>
<p>of why we haven&rsquo;t blown each other up yet</p>
<p>with nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s some truth to that,</p>
<p>this kind of stabilizing force</p>
<p>of mutually assured destruction?</p>
<p>And do you think that&rsquo;s gonna hold up</p>
<p>through the 21st century?</p>
<p>I mean, it has held.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s definitely truth to it,</p>
<p>that it was a, you know, it&rsquo;s a Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p>Yeah, are you surprised it held this long?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it crazy?</p>
<p>It is crazy when you factor in all the like</p>
<p>near miss accidental firings.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s makes me wonder like, you know,</p>
<p>are you familiar with the like quantum suicide</p>
<p>thought experiment, where it&rsquo;s basically like,</p>
<p>you have a, you know, like a Russian roulette</p>
<p>type scenario hooked up to some kind of quantum event,</p>
<p>you know, particle splitting or pair of particles splitting.</p>
<p>And if it, you know, if it goes A,</p>
<p>then the gun doesn&rsquo;t go off and it goes B,</p>
<p>then it does go off and it kills you.</p>
<p>Because you can only ever be in the universe,</p>
<p>you know, assuming like the Everett branch,</p>
<p>you know, multiverse theory,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll always only end up in the branch</p>
<p>where you continually make, you know, option A comes in,</p>
<p>but you run that experiment enough times,</p>
<p>it starts getting pretty damn, you know,</p>
<p>out of the tree gets huge,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a million different scenarios,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll always find yourself in this,</p>
<p>in the one where it didn&rsquo;t go off.</p>
<p>And so from that perspective, you are essentially immortal</p>
<p>because someone, and you will only find yourself</p>
<p>in the set of observers that make it down that path.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a&hellip;</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean, that doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still not gonna be fucked at some point in your life.</p>
<p>No, of course not, no, I&rsquo;m not advocating</p>
<p>like that we&rsquo;re all immortal because of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a fun thought experiment.</p>
<p>And the point is it like raises this thing</p>
<p>of like these things called observer selection effects,</p>
<p>which Bostrom, Nick Bostrom talks about a lot,</p>
<p>and I think people should go read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really powerful,</p>
<p>but I think it could be overextended, that logic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how it can be.</p>
<p>I just feel like you can get, you can overgeneralize</p>
<p>that logic somehow.</p>
<p>Well, no, I mean, it leaves you into like solipsism,</p>
<p>which is a very dangerous mindset.</p>
<p>Again, if everyone like falls into solipsism of like,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great way of creating a very,</p>
<p>self terminating environment.</p>
<p>But my point is, is that with the nuclear weapons thing,</p>
<p>there have been at least, I think it&rsquo;s 12 or 11 near misses</p>
<p>of like just stupid things, like there was moonrise</p>
<p>over Norway, and it made weird reflections</p>
<p>of some glaciers in the mountains, which set off,</p>
<p>I think the alarms of NORAD radar,</p>
<p>and that put them on high alert, nearly ready to shoot.</p>
<p>And it was only because the head of Russian military</p>
<p>happened to be at the UN in New York at the time</p>
<p>that they go like, well, wait a second,</p>
<p>why would they fire now when their guy is there?</p>
<p>And it was only that lucky happenstance,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t happen very often where they didn&rsquo;t then</p>
<p>escalate it into firing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bunch of these different ones.</p>
<p>Stanislav Petrov, like saved the person</p>
<p>who should be the most famous person on earth,</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s probably on expectation,</p>
<p>saved the most human lives of anyone,</p>
<p>like billions of people by ignoring Russian orders to fire</p>
<p>because he felt in his gut that actually</p>
<p>this was a false alarm.</p>
<p>And it turned out to be, you know, very hard thing to do.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many of those scenarios that I can&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>but wonder at this point that we aren&rsquo;t having this kind</p>
<p>of like selection effect thing going on.</p>
<p>Cause you look back and you&rsquo;re like, geez,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of near misses.</p>
<p>But of course we don&rsquo;t know the actual probabilities</p>
<p>that they would have lent each one would have ended up</p>
<p>in nuclear war.</p>
<p>Maybe they were not that likely, but still the point is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very dark, stupid game that we&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>And it is an absolute moral imperative if you ask me</p>
<p>to get as many people thinking about ways</p>
<p>to make this like very precarious.</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re in a Nash equilibrium,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re in the bottom of a pit.</p>
<p>You know, if you would like map it topographically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like a stable ball at the bottom of a thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not in equilibrium because of that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on the top of a hill with a ball balanced on top.</p>
<p>And just at any little nudge could send it flying down</p>
<p>and you know, nuclear war pops off</p>
<p>and hellfire and bad times.</p>
<p>On the positive side,</p>
<p>life on earth will probably still continue.</p>
<p>And another intelligent civilization might still pop up.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Several millennia after.</p>
<p>Pick your X risk, depends on the X risk.</p>
<p>Nuclear war, sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the perhaps less bad ones.</p>
<p>Green goo through synthetic biology, very bad.</p>
<p>Will turn, you know, destroy all, you know,</p>
<p>organic matter through, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically like a biological paperclip maximizer.</p>
<p>Also bad.</p>
<p>Or AI type, you know, mass extinction thing as well</p>
<p>would also be bad.</p>
<p>Shh, they&rsquo;re listening.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a robot right behind you.</p>
<p>Okay, wait.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about this from a game theory perspective.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re living in a simulation?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re living inside a video game</p>
<p>created by somebody else?</p>
<p>Well, so what was the second part of the question?</p>
<p>Do I think we&rsquo;re living in a simulation and?</p>
<p>A simulation that is observed by somebody</p>
<p>for purpose of entertainment.</p>
<p>So like a video game.</p>
<p>Are we listening?</p>
<p>Are we, because there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like Phil Hellmuth type of situation, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a creepy level of like,</p>
<p>this is kind of fun and interesting.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting stuff going on.</p>
<p>Maybe that could be somehow integrated</p>
<p>into the evolutionary process where the way we perceive</p>
<p>and are.</p>
<p>Are you asking me if I believe in God?</p>
<p>Sounds like it.</p>
<p>Kind of, but God seems to be not optimizing</p>
<p>in the different formulations of God that we conceive of.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be, or she, optimizing</p>
<p>for like personal entertainment.</p>
<p>Maybe the older gods did.</p>
<p>But the, you know, just like, basically like a teenager</p>
<p>in their mom&rsquo;s basement watching, create a fun universe</p>
<p>to observe what kind of crazy shit might happen.</p>
<p>Okay, so to try and answer this.</p>
<p>Do I think there is some kind of extraneous intelligence</p>
<p>to like our, you know, classic measurable universe</p>
<p>that we, you know, can measure with, you know,</p>
<p>through our current physics and instruments?</p>
<p>I think so, yes.</p>
<p>Partly because I&rsquo;ve had just small little bits of evidence</p>
<p>in my own life, which have made me question.</p>
<p>Like, so I was a diehard atheist, even five years ago.</p>
<p>You know, I got into like the rationality community,</p>
<p>big fan of less wrong, continue to be an incredible resource.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve just started to have too many little snippets</p>
<p>of experience, which don&rsquo;t make sense with the current sort</p>
<p>of purely materialistic explanation of how reality works.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just like a humbling, practical realization</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know how reality works?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just a reminder to yourself that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know how reality works, isn&rsquo;t that just</p>
<p>a reminder to yourself?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s a reminder of epistemic humility</p>
<p>because I fell too hard, you know, same as people,</p>
<p>like I think, you know, many people who are just like,</p>
<p>my religion is the way, this is the correct way,</p>
<p>this is the work, this is the law, you are immoral</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t follow this, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I think they are lacking epistemic humility.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a little too much hubris there.</p>
<p>But similarly, I think that sort of the Richard Dawkins</p>
<p>realism is too rigid as well and doesn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way to try and navigate these questions</p>
<p>which still honors the scientific method,</p>
<p>which I still think is our best sort of realm</p>
<p>of like reasonable inquiry, you know, a method of inquiry.</p>
<p>So an example, two kind of notable examples</p>
<p>that like really rattled my cage.</p>
<p>The first one was actually in 2010 early on</p>
<p>in quite early on in my poker career.</p>
<p>And I, remember the Icelandic volcano that erupted</p>
<p>that like shut down kind of all Atlantic airspace.</p>
<p>And it meant I got stuck down in the South of France.</p>
<p>I was there for something else.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t get home and someone said,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s a big poker tournament happening in Italy.</p>
<p>Maybe, do you wanna go?</p>
<p>I was like, all right, sure.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s, you know, got a train across,</p>
<p>found a way to get there.</p>
<p>And the buy in was 5,000 euros,</p>
<p>which was much bigger than my bankroll would normally allow.</p>
<p>And so I played a feeder tournament, won my way in</p>
<p>kind of like I did with the Monte Carlo big one.</p>
<p>So then I won my way, you know,</p>
<p>from 500 euros into 5,000 euros to play this thing.</p>
<p>And on day one of then the big tournament,</p>
<p>which turned out to have,</p>
<p>it was the biggest tournament ever held in Europe</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>It got over like 1,200 people, absolutely huge.</p>
<p>And I remember they dimmed the lights for before, you know,</p>
<p>the normal shuffle up and deal</p>
<p>to tell everyone to start playing.</p>
<p>And they played Chemical Brothers, Hey Boy, Hey Girl,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s notable,</p>
<p>but it was just like a really,</p>
<p>it was a song I always liked.</p>
<p>It was like one of these like pump me up songs.</p>
<p>And I was sitting there thinking, oh yeah, it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing this really big tournament.</p>
<p>And out of nowhere, just suddenly this voice in my head,</p>
<p>just, and it sounded like my own sort of, you know,</p>
<p>when you think in your mind, you hear a voice kind of, right?</p>
<p>At least I do.</p>
<p>And so it sounded like my own voice and it said,</p>
<p>you are going to win this tournament.</p>
<p>And it was so powerful that I got this like wave of like,</p>
<p>you know, sort of goosebumps down my body.</p>
<p>And that I even, I remember looking around being like,</p>
<p>did anyone else hear that?</p>
<p>And obviously people are in their phones,</p>
<p>like no one else heard it.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, six days later,</p>
<p>I win the fucking tournament out of 1,200 people.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it.</p>
<p>Okay, yes, maybe I have that feeling</p>
<p>before every time I play.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just that I happened to, you know,</p>
<p>because I won the tournament, I retroactively remembered it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>Or the feeling gave you a kind of,</p>
<p>now from the film, Helmutian.</p>
<p>Well, exactly.</p>
<p>Like it gave you a confident, a deep confidence.</p>
<p>And it did.</p>
<p>It definitely did.</p>
<p>Like, I remember then feeling this like sort of,</p>
<p>well, although I remember then on day one,</p>
<p>I then went and lost half my stack quite early on.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking like, oh, well, that was bullshit.</p>
<p>You know, what kind of premonition is this?</p>
<p>Thinking, oh, I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>But you know, I managed to like keep it together</p>
<p>and recover and then just went like pretty perfectly</p>
<p>from then on.</p>
<p>And either way, it definitely instilled me</p>
<p>with this confidence.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to put, I can&rsquo;t put an explanation.</p>
<p>Like, you know, was it some, you know, huge extra to extra,</p>
<p>you know, supernatural thing driving me?</p>
<p>Or was it just my own self confidence in someone</p>
<p>that just made me make the right decisions?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not going to put a frame on it.</p>
<p>And I think.</p>
<p>I think I know a good explanation.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re a bunch of NPCs living in this world</p>
<p>created by, in the simulation.</p>
<p>And then people, not people, creatures from outside</p>
<p>of the simulation sort of can tune in</p>
<p>and play your character.</p>
<p>And that feeling you got is somebody just like,</p>
<p>they got to play a poker tournament through you.</p>
<p>Honestly, it felt like that.</p>
<p>It did actually feel a little bit like that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been 12 years now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve retold the story many times.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t even know how much I can trust my memory.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just an NPC retelling the same story.</p>
<p>Because they just played the tournament and left.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re like, oh, that was fun.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, cool.</p>
<p>Next time.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re for the rest of your life left</p>
<p>as a boring NPC retelling this story of greatness.</p>
<p>But it was, and what was interesting was that after that,</p>
<p>then I didn&rsquo;t obviously win a major tournament</p>
<p>for quite a long time.</p>
<p>And it left, that was actually another sort of dark period</p>
<p>because I had this incredible,</p>
<p>like the highs of winning that,</p>
<p>just on a like material level were insane,</p>
<p>winning the money.</p>
<p>I was on the front page of newspapers</p>
<p>because there was like this girl that came out of nowhere</p>
<p>and won this big thing.</p>
<p>And so again, like sort of chasing that feeling</p>
<p>was difficult.</p>
<p>But then on top of that, there was this feeling</p>
<p>of like almost being touched by something bigger</p>
<p>that was like, ah.</p>
<p>So maybe, did you have a sense</p>
<p>that I might be somebody special?</p>
<p>Like this kind of,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the confidence thing</p>
<p>that maybe you could do something special in this world</p>
<p>after all kind of feeling.</p>
<p>I definitely, I mean, this is the thing</p>
<p>I think everybody wrestles with to an extent, right?</p>
<p>We are truly the protagonists in our own lives.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a natural bias, human bias</p>
<p>to feel special.</p>
<p>And I think, and in some ways we are special.</p>
<p>Every single person is special</p>
<p>because you are that, the universe does,</p>
<p>the world literally does revolve around you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing in some respect.</p>
<p>But of course, if you then zoom out</p>
<p>and take the amalgam of everyone&rsquo;s experiences,</p>
<p>then no, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So there is this shared sort of objective reality,</p>
<p>but sorry, there&rsquo;s objective reality that is shared,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s also this subjective reality</p>
<p>which is truly unique to you.</p>
<p>And I think both of those things coexist.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like one is correct and one isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And again, anyone who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh no, your lived experience is everything</p>
<p>versus your lived experience is nothing.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a blend between these two things.</p>
<p>They can exist concurrently.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a certain kind of sense</p>
<p>that at least I&rsquo;ve had my whole life.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people have this as like,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m just like this little person.</p>
<p>Surely I can&rsquo;t be one of those people</p>
<p>that do the big thing, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these big people doing big things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s big actors and actresses, big musicians.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s big business owners and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>scientists and so on.</p>
<p>I have my own subject experience that I enjoy and so on,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s like a different layer.</p>
<p>Like surely I can&rsquo;t do those great things.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things just having interacted</p>
<p>with a lot of great people, I realized,</p>
<p>no, they&rsquo;re like just the same humans as me.</p>
<p>And that realization I think is really empowering.</p>
<p>And to remind yourself.</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>Are they?</p>
<p>Well, in terms of.</p>
<p>Depends on some, yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like a bag of insecurities and.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Peculiar sort of, like their own little weirdnesses</p>
<p>and so on, I should say also not.</p>
<p>They have the capacity for brilliance,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not generically brilliant.</p>
<p>Like, you know, we tend to say this person</p>
<p>or that person is brilliant, but really no,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just like sitting there and thinking through stuff</p>
<p>just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re in the habit of thinking through stuff</p>
<p>seriously and they&rsquo;ve built up a habit of not allowing them,</p>
<p>their mind to get trapped in a bunch of bullshit</p>
<p>and minutia of day to day life.</p>
<p>They really think big ideas, but those big ideas,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like allowing yourself the freedom to think big,</p>
<p>to realize that you can be one that actually solved</p>
<p>this particular big problem.</p>
<p>First identify a big problem that you care about,</p>
<p>then like, I can actually be the one</p>
<p>that solves this problem.</p>
<p>And like allowing yourself to believe that.</p>
<p>And I think sometimes you do need to have like</p>
<p>that shock go through your body and a voice tells you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna win this tournament.</p>
<p>Well, exactly.</p>
<p>And whether it was, it&rsquo;s this idea of useful fictions.</p>
<p>So again, like going through all like</p>
<p>the classic rationalist training of Les Wrong</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, you want your map,</p>
<p>you know, the image you have of the world in your head</p>
<p>to as accurately match up with how the world actually is.</p>
<p>You want the map and the territory to perfectly align</p>
<p>as, you know, you want it to be</p>
<p>as an accurate representation as possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I fully subscribed to that anymore,</p>
<p>having now had these moments of like feeling of something</p>
<p>either bigger or just actually just being overconfident.</p>
<p>Like there is value in overconfidence sometimes.</p>
<p>If you, you know, take, you know,</p>
<p>take Magnus Carlsen, right?</p>
<p>If he, I&rsquo;m sure from a young age,</p>
<p>he knew he was very talented,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he was also had something</p>
<p>in him to, well, actually maybe he&rsquo;s a bad example</p>
<p>because he truly is the world&rsquo;s greatest,</p>
<p>but someone who it was unclear</p>
<p>whether they were gonna be the world&rsquo;s greatest,</p>
<p>but ended up doing extremely well</p>
<p>because they had this innate, deep self confidence,</p>
<p>this like even overblown idea</p>
<p>of how good their relative skill level is.</p>
<p>That gave them the confidence to then pursue this thing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like with the kind of focus and dedication</p>
<p>that it requires to excel in whatever it is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to do, you know?</p>
<p>And so there are these useful fictions</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where I think I diverge slightly</p>
<p>with the classic sort of rationalist community</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a field that is worth studying</p>
<p>of like how the stories we tell,</p>
<p>what the stories we tell to ourselves,</p>
<p>even if they are actually false,</p>
<p>and even if we suspect they might be false,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s better to sort of have that like little bit</p>
<p>of faith, like value in faith, I think actually.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s partly another thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now led me to explore the concept of God,</p>
<p>whether you wanna call it a simulator,</p>
<p>the classic theological thing.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re all like elucidating to the same thing.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not saying,</p>
<p>because obviously the Christian God</p>
<p>is like all benevolent, endless love.</p>
<p>The simulation, at least one of the simulation hypothesis</p>
<p>is like, as you said, like a teenager in his bedroom</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t really care, doesn&rsquo;t give a shit</p>
<p>about the individuals within there.</p>
<p>It just like wants to see how the thing plays out</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s curious and it could turn it off like that.</p>
<p>Where on the sort of psychopathy</p>
<p>to benevolent spectrum God is, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But just having a little bit of faith</p>
<p>that there is something else out there</p>
<p>that might be interested in our outcome</p>
<p>is I think an essential thing actually for people to find.</p>
<p>A, because it creates commonality between,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something we can all share.</p>
<p>And it is uniquely humbling of all of us to an extent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a common objective.</p>
<p>But B, it gives people that little bit of like reserve</p>
<p>when things get really dark.</p>
<p>And I do think things are gonna get pretty dark</p>
<p>over the next few years.</p>
<p>But it gives that like,</p>
<p>to think that there&rsquo;s something out there</p>
<p>that actually wants our game to keep going.</p>
<p>I keep calling it the game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thing C and I, we call it the game.</p>
<p>You and C is a.k.a. Grimes, we call what the game?</p>
<p>Everything, the whole thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, we joke about like.</p>
<p>So everything is a game.</p>
<p>Well, the universe, like what if it&rsquo;s a game</p>
<p>and the goal of the game is to figure out like,</p>
<p>well, either how to beat it, how to get out of it.</p>
<p>Maybe this universe is an escape room,</p>
<p>like a giant escape room.</p>
<p>And the goal is to figure out,</p>
<p>put all the pieces to puzzle, figure out how it works</p>
<p>in order to like unlock this like hyperdimensional key</p>
<p>and get out beyond what it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>No, but then, so you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s like different levels</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a cage within a cage within a cage</p>
<p>and never like one cage at a time,</p>
<p>you figure out how to escape that.</p>
<p>Like a new level up, you know,</p>
<p>like us becoming multi planetary would be a level up</p>
<p>or us, you know, figuring out how to upload</p>
<p>our consciousnesses to the thing.</p>
<p>That would probably be a leveling up or spiritually,</p>
<p>you know, humanity becoming more combined</p>
<p>and less adversarial and bloodthirsty</p>
<p>and us becoming a little bit more enlightened.</p>
<p>That would be a leveling up.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s many different frames to it,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s physical, you know, digital</p>
<p>or like metaphysical.</p>
<p>I wonder what the levels, I think,</p>
<p>I think level one for earth is probably</p>
<p>the biological evolutionary process.</p>
<p>So going from single cell organisms to early humans.</p>
<p>Then maybe level two is whatever&rsquo;s happening inside our minds</p>
<p>and creating ideas and creating technologies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like evolutionary process of ideas.</p>
<p>And then multi planetary is interesting.</p>
<p>Is that fundamentally different</p>
<p>from what we&rsquo;re doing here on earth?</p>
<p>Probably, because it allows us to like exponentially scale.</p>
<p>It delays the Malthusian trap, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way to keep the playing field,</p>
<p>to make the playing field get larger</p>
<p>so that it can accommodate more of our stuff, more of us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good thing,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if it like fully solves this issue of,</p>
<p>well, this thing called Moloch,</p>
<p>which we haven&rsquo;t talked about yet,</p>
<p>but which is basically,</p>
<p>I call it the God of unhealthy competition.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s go to Moloch.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Moloch?</p>
<p>You did a great video on Moloch and one aspect of it,</p>
<p>the application of it to one aspect.</p>
<p>Instagram beauty filters.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Very niche, but I wanted to start off small.</p>
<p>So Moloch was originally coined as,</p>
<p>well, so apparently back in the like Canaanite times,</p>
<p>it was to say ancient Carthaginian,</p>
<p>I can never say it Carthaginian,</p>
<p>somewhere around like 300 BC or 280, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There was supposedly this death cult</p>
<p>who would sacrifice their children</p>
<p>to this awful demon God thing they called Moloch</p>
<p>in order to get power to win wars.</p>
<p>So really dark, horrible things.</p>
<p>And it was literally like about child sacrifice,</p>
<p>whether they actually existed or not, we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but in mythology they did.</p>
<p>And this God that they worshiped</p>
<p>was this thing called Moloch.</p>
<p>And then I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it seemed like it was kind of quiet throughout history</p>
<p>in terms of mythology beyond that,</p>
<p>until this movie Metropolis in 1927 talked about this,</p>
<p>you see that there was this incredible futuristic city</p>
<p>that everyone was living great in,</p>
<p>but then the protagonist goes underground into the sewers</p>
<p>and sees that the city is run by this machine.</p>
<p>And this machine basically would just like kill the workers</p>
<p>all the time because it was just so hard to keep it running.</p>
<p>They were always dying.</p>
<p>So there was all this suffering that was required</p>
<p>in order to keep the city going.</p>
<p>And then the protagonist has this vision</p>
<p>that this machine is actually this demon Moloch.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s like this sort of like mechanistic consumption</p>
<p>of humans in order to get more power.</p>
<p>And then Allen Ginsberg wrote a poem in the 60s,</p>
<p>which incredible poem called Howl about this thing Moloch.</p>
<p>And a lot of people sort of quite understandably</p>
<p>take the interpretation of that,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s talking about capitalism.</p>
<p>But then the sort of piece to resistance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s moved Moloch into this idea of game theory</p>
<p>was Scott Alexander of Slate Style Codex</p>
<p>wrote this incredible,</p>
<p>well, literally I think it might be my favorite piece</p>
<p>of writing of all time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Meditations on Moloch.</p>
<p>Everyone must go read it.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>I say Codex is a blog.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a blog, yes.</p>
<p>We can link to it in the show notes or something, right?</p>
<p>No, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I, yes, yes.</p>
<p>But I like how you assume</p>
<p>I have a professional operation going on here.</p>
<p>I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>I shall try to remember to&hellip;</p>
<p>You were gonna assume.</p>
<p>What do you&hellip;</p>
<p>What are you, what do you want?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving the impression of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll look, please.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t, please somebody in the comments remind me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll help you.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know this blog,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the best blogs ever probably.</p>
<p>You should probably be following it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Are blogs still a thing?</p>
<p>I think they are still a thing, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s migrated onto Substack,</p>
<p>but yeah, it&rsquo;s still a blog.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Substack better not fuck things up, but&hellip;</p>
<p>I hope not, yeah.</p>
<p>I hope they don&rsquo;t, I hope they don&rsquo;t turn Molochy,</p>
<p>which will mean something to people when we continue.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When I stop interrupting for once.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Go on, yeah.</p>
<p>So anyway, so he writes,</p>
<p>he writes this piece, Meditations on Moloch,</p>
<p>and basically he analyzes the poem and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, so it seems to be something relating</p>
<p>to where competition goes wrong.</p>
<p>And, you know, Moloch was historically this thing</p>
<p>of like where people would sacrifice a thing</p>
<p>that they care about, in this case, children,</p>
<p>their own children, in order to gain power,</p>
<p>a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>And if you look at almost everything that sort of goes wrong</p>
<p>in our society, it&rsquo;s that same process.</p>
<p>So with the Instagram beauty filters thing,</p>
<p>you know, if you&rsquo;re trying to become</p>
<p>a famous Instagram model,</p>
<p>you are incentivized to post the hottest pictures</p>
<p>of yourself that you can, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to play that game.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of hot women on Instagram.</p>
<p>How do you compete against them?</p>
<p>You post really hot pictures</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how you get more likes.</p>
<p>As technology gets better, you know,</p>
<p>more makeup techniques come along.</p>
<p>And then more recently, these beauty filters</p>
<p>where like at the touch of a button,</p>
<p>it makes your face look absolutely incredible</p>
<p>compared to your natural face.</p>
<p>These technologies come along,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everyone is incentivized to that short term strategy.</p>
<p>But over on net, it&rsquo;s bad for everyone</p>
<p>because now everyone is kind of feeling</p>
<p>like they have to use these things.</p>
<p>And these things like they make you like,</p>
<p>the reason why I talked about them in this video</p>
<p>is because I noticed it myself, you know,</p>
<p>like I was trying to grow my Instagram for a while,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given up on it now.</p>
<p>But yeah, and I noticed these filters,</p>
<p>how good they made me look.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, I know that everyone else</p>
<p>is kind of doing it.</p>
<p>Go subscribe to Liv&rsquo;s Instagram.</p>
<p>Please, so I don&rsquo;t have to use the filters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post a bunch of, yeah, make it blow up.</p>
<p>So yeah, you felt the pressure actually.</p>
<p>Exactly, these short term incentives</p>
<p>to do this like, this thing that like either sacrifices</p>
<p>your integrity or something else</p>
<p>in order to like stay competitive,</p>
<p>which on aggregate turns like,</p>
<p>creates this like sort of race to the bottom spiral</p>
<p>where everyone else ends up in a situation</p>
<p>which is worse off than if they hadn&rsquo;t started,</p>
<p>you know, than they were before.</p>
<p>Kind of like if, like at a football stadium,</p>
<p>like the system is so badly designed,</p>
<p>a competitive system of like everyone sitting</p>
<p>and having a view that if someone at the very front</p>
<p>stands up to get an even better view,</p>
<p>it forces everyone else behind</p>
<p>to like adopt that same strategy</p>
<p>just to get to where they were before.</p>
<p>But now everyone&rsquo;s stuck standing up.</p>
<p>Like, so you need this like top down God&rsquo;s eye coordination</p>
<p>to make it go back to the better state.</p>
<p>But from within the system, you can&rsquo;t actually do that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of what this Moloch thing is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this thing that makes people sacrifice values</p>
<p>in order to optimize for the winning the game in question,</p>
<p>the short term game.</p>
<p>But this Moloch, can you attribute it</p>
<p>to any one centralized source</p>
<p>or is it an emergent phenomena</p>
<p>from a large collection of people?</p>
<p>Exactly that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an emergent phenomena.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a force of game theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a force of bad incentives on a multi agent system</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got more, you know,</p>
<p>prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma is technically</p>
<p>a kind of Moloch system as well,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just a two player thing.</p>
<p>But another word for Moloch is it multipolar trap.</p>
<p>Where basically you just got a lot of different people</p>
<p>all competing for some kind of prize.</p>
<p>And it would be better</p>
<p>if everyone didn&rsquo;t do this one shitty strategy,</p>
<p>but because that strategy gives you a short term advantage,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s incentivized to do it.</p>
<p>And so everyone ends up doing it.</p>
<p>So the responsibility for,</p>
<p>I mean, social media is a really nice place</p>
<p>for a large number of people to play game theory.</p>
<p>And so they also have the ability</p>
<p>to then design the rules of the game.</p>
<p>And is it on them to try to anticipate</p>
<p>what kind of like to do the thing</p>
<p>that poker players are doing to run simulation?</p>
<p>Ideally that would have been great.</p>
<p>If, you know, Mark Zuckerberg and Jack</p>
<p>and all the, you know, the Twitter founders and everyone,</p>
<p>if they had at least just run a few simulations</p>
<p>of how their algorithms would, you know,</p>
<p>if different types of algorithms would turn out for society,</p>
<p>that would have been great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really difficult to do</p>
<p>that kind of deep philosophical thinking</p>
<p>about thinking about humanity actually.</p>
<p>So not kind of this level of how do we optimize engagement</p>
<p>or what brings people joy in the short term,</p>
<p>but how is this thing going to change</p>
<p>the way people see the world?</p>
<p>How is it gonna get morphed in iterative games played</p>
<p>into something that will change society forever?</p>
<p>That requires some deep thinking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I hope there&rsquo;s meetings like that inside companies,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t seen them.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s difficult because like,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re starting up a social media company,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re aware that you&rsquo;ve got investors to please,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s bills to pay, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only so much R&amp;D you can afford to do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got all these like incredible pressures,</p>
<p>bad incentives to get on and just build your thing</p>
<p>as quickly as possible and start making money.</p>
<p>And, you know, I don&rsquo;t think anyone intended</p>
<p>when they built these social media platforms</p>
<p>and just to like preface it.</p>
<p>So the reason why, you know, social media is relevant</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very good example of like,</p>
<p>everyone these days is optimizing for, you know, clicks,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a social media platforms themselves,</p>
<p>because, you know, every click gets more, you know,</p>
<p>impressions and impressions pay for, you know,</p>
<p>they get advertising dollars</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s individual influencers</p>
<p>or, you know, whether it&rsquo;s a New York Times or whoever,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to get their story to go viral.</p>
<p>So everyone&rsquo;s got this bad incentive of using, you know,</p>
<p>as you called it, the clickbait industrial complex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very molly key system</p>
<p>because everyone is now using worse and worse tactics</p>
<p>in order to like try and win this attention game.</p>
<p>And yeah, so ideally these companies</p>
<p>would have had enough slack in the beginning</p>
<p>in order to run these experiments to see,</p>
<p>okay, what are the ways this could possibly go wrong</p>
<p>for people?</p>
<p>What are the ways that Moloch,</p>
<p>they should be aware of this concept of Moloch</p>
<p>and realize that whenever you have</p>
<p>a highly competitive multiagent system,</p>
<p>which social media is a classic example of,</p>
<p>millions of agents all trying to compete</p>
<p>for likes and so on,</p>
<p>and you try and bring all this complexity down</p>
<p>into like very small metrics,</p>
<p>such as number of likes, number of retweets,</p>
<p>whatever the algorithm optimizes for,</p>
<p>that is a guaranteed recipe for this stuff to go wrong</p>
<p>and become a race to the bottom.</p>
<p>I think there should be an honesty when founders,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a hunger for that kind of transparency</p>
<p>of like, we don&rsquo;t know what the fuck we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating experiment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all running as a human civilization.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try this out.</p>
<p>And like, actually just be honest about this,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all like these weird rats in a maze.</p>
<p>None of us are controlling it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this kind of sense like the founders,</p>
<p>the CEO of Instagram or whatever,</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg has a control and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>like with strings playing people.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at the mercy of this is like everyone else.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just like trying to do his best.</p>
<p>And like, I think putting on a smile</p>
<p>and doing over polished videos</p>
<p>about how Instagram and Facebook are good for you,</p>
<p>I think is not the right way to actually ask</p>
<p>some of the deepest questions we get to ask as a society.</p>
<p>How do we design the game such that we build a better world?</p>
<p>I think a big part of this as well is people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this philosophy, particularly in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>of well, techno optimism,</p>
<p>technology will solve all our issues.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a steel man argument to that where yes,</p>
<p>technology has solved a lot of problems</p>
<p>and can potentially solve a lot of future ones.</p>
<p>But it can also, it&rsquo;s always a double edged sword.</p>
<p>And particularly as you know,</p>
<p>technology gets more and more powerful</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve now got like big data</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re able to do all kinds of like</p>
<p>psychological manipulation with it and so on.</p>
<p>Technology is not a values neutral thing.</p>
<p>People think, I used to always think this myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this naive view that,</p>
<p>oh, technology is completely neutral.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s the humans that either make it good or bad.</p>
<p>No, to the point we&rsquo;re at now,</p>
<p>the technology that we are creating,</p>
<p>they are social technologies.</p>
<p>They literally dictate how humans now form social groups</p>
<p>and so on beyond that.</p>
<p>And beyond that, it also then,</p>
<p>that gives rise to like the memes</p>
<p>that we then like coalesce around.</p>
<p>And that, if you have the stack that way</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s technology driving social interaction,</p>
<p>which then drives like memetic culture</p>
<p>and like which ideas become popular, that&rsquo;s Moloch.</p>
<p>And we need the other way around, we need it.</p>
<p>So we need to figure out what are the good memes?</p>
<p>What are the good values</p>
<p>that we think we need to optimize for</p>
<p>that like makes people happy and healthy</p>
<p>and like keeps society as robust and safe as possible,</p>
<p>then figure out what the social structure</p>
<p>around those should be.</p>
<p>And only then do we figure out technology,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re doing the other way around.</p>
<p>And as much as I love in many ways</p>
<p>the culture of Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>and like I do think that technology has,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna knock it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done so many wonderful things for us,</p>
<p>same as capitalism.</p>
<p>There are, we have to like be honest with ourselves.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting to a point where we are losing control</p>
<p>of this very powerful machine that we have created.</p>
<p>Can you redesign the machine within the game?</p>
<p>Can you just have, can you understand the game enough?</p>
<p>Okay, this is the game.</p>
<p>And this is how we start to reemphasize</p>
<p>the memes that matter,</p>
<p>the memes that bring out the best in us.</p>
<p>You know, like the way I try to be in real life</p>
<p>and the way I try to be online</p>
<p>is to be about kindness and love.</p>
<p>And I feel like I&rsquo;m sometimes get like criticized</p>
<p>for being naive and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But I feel like I&rsquo;m just trying to live within this game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to be authentic.</p>
<p>Yeah, but also like, hey, it&rsquo;s kind of fun to do this.</p>
<p>Like you guys should try this too, you know,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like trying to redesign</p>
<p>some aspects of the game within the game.</p>
<p>Is that possible?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I think we should try.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have an option but to try.</p>
<p>Well, the other option is to create new companies</p>
<p>or to pressure companies that,</p>
<p>or anyone who has control of the rules of the game.</p>
<p>I think we need to be doing all of the above.</p>
<p>I think we need to be thinking hard</p>
<p>about what are the kind of positive, healthy memes.</p>
<p>You know, as Elon said,</p>
<p>he who controls the memes controls the universe.</p>
<p>He said that.</p>
<p>I think he did, yeah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s truth to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, there is wisdom in that</p>
<p>because memes have driven history.</p>
<p>You know, we are a cultural species.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what sets us apart from chimpanzees</p>
<p>and everything else.</p>
<p>We have the ability to learn and evolve through culture</p>
<p>as opposed to biology or like, you know,</p>
<p>classic physical constraints.</p>
<p>And that means culture is incredibly powerful</p>
<p>and we can create and become victim</p>
<p>to very bad memes or very good ones.</p>
<p>But we do have some agency over which memes,</p>
<p>you know, we, but not only put out there,</p>
<p>but we also like subscribe to.</p>
<p>So I think we need to take that approach.</p>
<p>We also need to, you know,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want, I&rsquo;m making this video right now</p>
<p>called The Attention Wars,</p>
<p>which is about like how Moloch,</p>
<p>like the media machine is this Moloch machine.</p>
<p>Well, is this kind of like blind dumb thing</p>
<p>where everyone is optimizing for engagement</p>
<p>in order to win their share of the attention pie.</p>
<p>And then if you zoom out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really like Moloch that&rsquo;s pulling the strings</p>
<p>because the only thing that benefits from this in the end,</p>
<p>you know, like our information ecosystem is breaking down.</p>
<p>Like we have, you look at the state of the US,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in, we&rsquo;re in a civil war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not a physical war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an information war.</p>
<p>And people are becoming more fractured</p>
<p>in terms of what their actual shared reality is.</p>
<p>Like truly like an extreme left person,</p>
<p>an extreme right person,</p>
<p>like they literally live in different worlds</p>
<p>in their minds at this point.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s getting more and more amplified.</p>
<p>And this force is like a razor blade</p>
<p>pushing through everything.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how innocuous a topic is,</p>
<p>it will find a way to split into this,</p>
<p>you know, bifurcated cultural and it&rsquo;s fucking terrifying.</p>
<p>Because that maximizes the tension.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like an emergent Moloch type force</p>
<p>that takes anything, any topic</p>
<p>and cuts through it so that it can split nicely</p>
<p>into two groups.</p>
<p>One that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s whatever, yeah,</p>
<p>all everyone is trying to do within the system</p>
<p>is just maximize whatever gets them the most attention</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re just trying to make money</p>
<p>so they can keep their thing going, right?</p>
<p>And the best emotion for getting attention,</p>
<p>well, because it&rsquo;s not just about attention on the internet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s engagement, that&rsquo;s the key thing, right?</p>
<p>In order for something to go viral,</p>
<p>you need people to actually engage with it.</p>
<p>They need to like comment or retweet or whatever.</p>
<p>And of all the emotions that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like seven classic shared emotions</p>
<p>that studies have found that all humans,</p>
<p>even from like previously uncontacted tribes have.</p>
<p>Some of those are negative, you know, like sadness,</p>
<p>disgust, anger, et cetera, some are positive,</p>
<p>happiness, excitement, and so on.</p>
<p>The one that happens to be the most useful</p>
<p>for the internet is anger.</p>
<p>Because anger, it&rsquo;s such an active emotion.</p>
<p>If you want people to engage, if someone&rsquo;s scared,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not just like talking out my ass here,</p>
<p>there are studies here that have looked into this.</p>
<p>Whereas like if someone&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>disgusted or fearful, they actually tend to then be like,</p>
<p>oh, I don&rsquo;t wanna deal with this.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re less likely to actually engage</p>
<p>and share it and so on, they&rsquo;re just gonna be like, ugh.</p>
<p>Whereas if they&rsquo;re enraged by a thing,</p>
<p>well now that triggers all the like,</p>
<p>the old tribalism emotions.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how then things get sort of spread,</p>
<p>you know, much more easily.</p>
<p>They out compete all the other memes in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>And so this like, the attention economy,</p>
<p>the wheels that make it go around are,</p>
<p>is rage.</p>
<p>I did a tweet, the problem with raging against the machine</p>
<p>is that the machine has learned to feed off rage.</p>
<p>Because it is feeding off our rage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s now keeping it going.</p>
<p>So the more we get angry, the worse it gets.</p>
<p>So the mullet in this attention,</p>
<p>in the war of attention is constantly maximizing rage.</p>
<p>What it is optimizing for is engagement.</p>
<p>And it happens to be that engagement</p>
<p>is more propaganda, you know.</p>
<p>I mean, it just sounds like everything is putting,</p>
<p>more and more things are being put through this</p>
<p>like propagandist lens of winning</p>
<p>whatever the war is in question.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the culture war or the Ukraine war, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I think the silver lining of this,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible that in the long arc</p>
<p>of this process, you actually do arrive</p>
<p>at greater wisdom and more progress?</p>
<p>It just, in the moment, it feels like people are</p>
<p>tearing each other to shreds over ideas.</p>
<p>But if you think about it, one of the magic things</p>
<p>about democracy and so on, is you have</p>
<p>the blue versus red constantly fighting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;re in discourse,</p>
<p>creating devil&rsquo;s advocate, making devils out of each other.</p>
<p>And through that process, discussing ideas.</p>
<p>Like almost really embodying different ideas</p>
<p>just to yell at each other.</p>
<p>And through the yelling, over the period of decades,</p>
<p>maybe centuries, figuring out a better system.</p>
<p>Like in the moment, it feels fucked up.</p>
<p>But in the long arc, it actually is productive.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>That said, we are now in the era of,</p>
<p>just as we have weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p>with nuclear weapons, you know,</p>
<p>that can break the whole playing field,</p>
<p>we now are developing weapons</p>
<p>of informational mass destruction.</p>
<p>Information weapons, you know, WMDs</p>
<p>that basically can be used for propaganda</p>
<p>or just manipulating people however is needed,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s through dumb TikTok videos,</p>
<p>or, you know, there are significant resources being put in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to sound like, you know,</p>
<p>to doom and gloom, but there are bad actors out there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing, there are plenty of good actors</p>
<p>within the system who are just trying to stay afloat</p>
<p>in the game, so effectively doing monarchy things.</p>
<p>But then on top of that, we have actual bad actors</p>
<p>who are intentionally trying to, like,</p>
<p>manipulate the other side into doing things.</p>
<p>And using, so because it&rsquo;s a digital space,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to use artificial actors, meaning bots.</p>
<p>Exactly, botnets, you know,</p>
<p>and this is a whole new situation</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve never had before.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>You know what I want to do?</p>
<p>You know what I want to do that,</p>
<p>because there is, you know, people are talking about bots</p>
<p>manipulating and, like, malicious bots</p>
<p>that are basically spreading propaganda.</p>
<p>I want to create, like, a bot army for, like,</p>
<p>that fights that. For love?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, for love, that fights, that, I mean.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s, I mean, there&rsquo;s truth</p>
<p>to fight fire with fire, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>but how you always have to be careful</p>
<p>whenever you create, again, like,</p>
<p>Moloch is very tricky. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Hitler was trying to spread the love, too.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, so we thought, but, you know, I agree with you</p>
<p>that, like, that is a thing that should be considered,</p>
<p>but there is, again, everyone,</p>
<p>the road to hell is paved in good intentions.</p>
<p>And this is, there&rsquo;s always unforeseen circumstances,</p>
<p>you know, outcomes, externalities</p>
<p>of you trying to adopt a thing,</p>
<p>even if you do it in the very best of faith.</p>
<p>But you can learn lessons of history.</p>
<p>If you can run some sims on it first, absolutely.</p>
<p>But also there&rsquo;s certain aspects of a system,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve learned through history, that do better than others.</p>
<p>Like, for example, don&rsquo;t have a dictator,</p>
<p>so, like, if I were to create this bot army,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not good for me to have full control over it.</p>
<p>Because in the beginning, I might have a good understanding</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s good and not, but over time,</p>
<p>that starts to get deviated,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll get annoyed at some assholes,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll think, okay, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice</p>
<p>to get rid of those assholes?</p>
<p>But then that power starts getting to your head,</p>
<p>you become corrupted, that&rsquo;s basic human nature.</p>
<p>So distribute the power somehow.</p>
<p>We need a love botnet on a DAO.</p>
<p>A DAO love botnet.</p>
<p>Yeah, and without a leader, like without&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, exactly, a distributed, right,</p>
<p>but yeah, without any kind of centralized&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, without even, you know,</p>
<p>basically it&rsquo;s the more control,</p>
<p>the more you can decentralize the control of a thing</p>
<p>to people, you know, but the balance&hellip;</p>
<p>But then you still need the ability to coordinate,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the issue when something is too,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s really, to me, like the culture wars,</p>
<p>the bigger war we&rsquo;re dealing with is actually between</p>
<p>the sort of the, I don&rsquo;t know what even the term is for it,</p>
<p>but like centralization versus decentralization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the tension we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>Power in control by a few versus completely distributed.</p>
<p>And the trouble is if you have a fully centralized thing,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re at risk of tyranny, you know,</p>
<p>Stalin type things can happen, or completely distributed.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re at risk of complete anarchy and chaos</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t even coordinate to like on, you know,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s like a pandemic or anything like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, what is the right balance to strike</p>
<p>between these two structures?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t Moloch really take hold</p>
<p>in a fully decentralized system?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the dangers too.</p>
<p>Yes, very vulnerable to Moloch.</p>
<p>So a dictator can commit huge atrocities,</p>
<p>but they can also make sure the infrastructure works</p>
<p>and trains run on time.</p>
<p>They have that God&rsquo;s eye view at least.</p>
<p>They have the ability to create like laws and rules</p>
<p>that like force coordination, which stops Moloch.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re vulnerable to that dictator</p>
<p>getting infected with like this,</p>
<p>with some kind of psychopathy type thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s reverse Moloch?</p>
<p>Sorry, great question.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where, so I&rsquo;ve been working on this series.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been driving me insane for the last year and a half.</p>
<p>I did the first one a year ago.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s nearly been a year.</p>
<p>The second one, hopefully will be coming out</p>
<p>in like a month.</p>
<p>And my goal at the end of the series is to like present,</p>
<p>cause basically I&rsquo;m painting the picture of like</p>
<p>what Moloch is and how it&rsquo;s affecting</p>
<p>almost all these issues in our society</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s driving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like kind of the generator function</p>
<p>as people describe it of existential risk.</p>
<p>And then at the end of that.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, the generator function of existential risk.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying Moloch is sort of the engine</p>
<p>that creates a bunch of X risks.</p>
<p>Yes, not all of them.</p>
<p>Like a, you know, a.</p>
<p>Just a cool phrase, generator function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my phrase.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Daniel Schmacktenberger.</p>
<p>Oh, Schmacktenberger.</p>
<p>I got that from him.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>All things, it&rsquo;s like all roads lead back</p>
<p>to Daniel Schmacktenberger, I think.</p>
<p>The dude is, the dude is brilliant.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really brilliant.</p>
<p>After that it&rsquo;s Mark Twain.</p>
<p>But anyway, sorry.</p>
<p>Totally rude interruptions from me.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>So not all X risks.</p>
<p>So like an asteroid technically isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>this one big external thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a competition thing going on.</p>
<p>But, you know, synthetic bio, you know,</p>
<p>bio weapons, that&rsquo;s one because everyone&rsquo;s incentivized</p>
<p>to build, even for defense, you know,</p>
<p>bad, bad viruses, you know,</p>
<p>just to threaten someone else, et cetera.</p>
<p>Or AI, technically the race to AGI</p>
<p>is kind of potentially a Molochi situation.</p>
<p>But yeah, so if Moloch is this like generator function</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s driving all of these issues</p>
<p>over the coming century that might wipe us out,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the inverse?</p>
<p>And so far what I&rsquo;ve gotten to is this character</p>
<p>that I want to put out there called Winwin.</p>
<p>Because Moloch is the God of lose, lose, ultimately.</p>
<p>It masquerades as the God of win, lose,</p>
<p>but in reality it&rsquo;s lose, lose.</p>
<p>Everyone ends up worse off.</p>
<p>So I was like, well, what&rsquo;s the opposite of that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Winwin.</p>
<p>And I was thinking for ages, like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a good name for this character?</p>
<p>And then tomorrow I was like, okay, well,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try and, you know, think through it logically.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the vibe of Winwin?</p>
<p>And to me, like in my mind, Moloch is like,</p>
<p>and I addressed that in the video,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s red and black.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like very, you know, hyper focused</p>
<p>on it&rsquo;s one goal you must win.</p>
<p>So Winwin is kind of actually like these colors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like purple, turquoise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s loves games too.</p>
<p>It loves a little bit of healthy competition,</p>
<p>but constrained, like kind of like before,</p>
<p>like knows how to ring fence zero sum competition</p>
<p>into like just the right amount,</p>
<p>whereby its externalities can be controlled</p>
<p>and kept positive.</p>
<p>And then beyond that, it also loves cooperation,</p>
<p>coordination, love, all these other things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also kind of like mischievous,</p>
<p>like, you know, it will have a good time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like kind of like boring, you know,</p>
<p>like, oh God, it knows how to have fun.</p>
<p>It can get like, it can get down,</p>
<p>but ultimately it&rsquo;s like unbelievably wise</p>
<p>and it just wants the game to keep going.</p>
<p>And I call it Winwin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good like pet name, Winwin.</p>
<p>I think the, Winwin, right?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s formal name when it has to do</p>
<p>like official functions is Omnia.</p>
<p>Omnia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>From like omniscience kind of, why Omnia?</p>
<p>You just like Omnia?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like Omniwin.</p>
<p>Omniwin.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m open to suggestions.</p>
<p>I would like, you know, and this is.</p>
<p>I like Omnia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But there is an angelic kind of sense to Omnia though.</p>
<p>So Winwin is more fun.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more like, it embraces the fun aspect.</p>
<p>The fun aspect.</p>
<p>I mean, there is something about sort of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some aspect to Winwin interactions</p>
<p>that requires embracing the chaos of the game</p>
<p>and enjoying the game itself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost like a Zen like appreciation</p>
<p>of the game itself, not optimizing</p>
<p>for the consequences of the game.</p>
<p>Right, well, it&rsquo;s recognizing the value</p>
<p>of competition in of itself about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like about winning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about you enjoying the process of having a competition</p>
<p>and not knowing whether you&rsquo;re gonna win</p>
<p>or lose this little thing.</p>
<p>But then also being aware that, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the boundary?</p>
<p>How big do I want competition to be?</p>
<p>Because one of the reason why Moloch is doing so well now</p>
<p>in our society, in our civilization is</p>
<p>because we haven&rsquo;t been able to ring fence competition.</p>
<p>You know, and so it&rsquo;s just having all</p>
<p>these negative externalities</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;ve completely lost control of it.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, I think my guess is,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re getting really like,</p>
<p>you know, metaphysical technically,</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;ll be in a more interesting universe</p>
<p>if we have one that has both pure cooperation,</p>
<p>you know, lots of cooperation</p>
<p>and some pockets of competition</p>
<p>than one that&rsquo;s purely competition, cooperation entirely.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s good to have some little zero sumness bits,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know that fully</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not qualified as a philosopher to know that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what reverse Moloch,</p>
<p>so this kind of win, win creature is a system,</p>
<p>is an antidote to the Moloch system.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s gonna do that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s good to kind of try to start</p>
<p>to formulate different ideas,</p>
<p>different frameworks of how we think about that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>At the small scale of a collection of individuals</p>
<p>and a large scale of a society.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a meme, I think it&rsquo;s an example of a good meme.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m open, I&rsquo;d love to hear feedback from people</p>
<p>if they think it&rsquo;s, you know, they have a better idea</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s not, you know,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the direction of memes that we need to spread,</p>
<p>this idea of like, look for the win, wins in life.</p>
<p>Well, on the topic of beauty filters,</p>
<p>so in that particular context</p>
<p>where Moloch creates negative consequences,</p>
<p>Dostoevsky said beauty will save the world.</p>
<p>What is beauty anyway?</p>
<p>It would be nice to just try to discuss</p>
<p>what kind of thing we would like to converge towards</p>
<p>in our understanding of what is beautiful.</p>
<p>So to me, I think something is beautiful</p>
<p>when it can&rsquo;t be reduced down to easy metrics.</p>
<p>Like if you think of a tree, what is it about a tree,</p>
<p>like a big, ancient, beautiful tree, right?</p>
<p>What is it about it that we find so beautiful?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, you know, the sweetness of its fruit</p>
<p>or the value of its lumber.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this entirety of it that is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these immeasurable qualities,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like almost like a qualia of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s both, like it walks this fine line between pattern,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s got lots of patternicity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not overly predictable.</p>
<p>Again, it walks this fine line between order and chaos.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very highly complex system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s evolving over time,</p>
<p>the definition of a complex versus,</p>
<p>and this is another Schmackt and Berger thing,</p>
<p>a complex versus a complicated system.</p>
<p>A complicated system can be sort of broken down</p>
<p>into bits and pieces,</p>
<p>a complicated system can be sort of broken down into bits,</p>
<p>understood and then put back together.</p>
<p>A complex system is kind of like a black box.</p>
<p>It does all this crazy stuff,</p>
<p>but if you take it apart,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t put it back together again,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s all these intricacies.</p>
<p>And also very importantly, like there&rsquo;s some of the parts,</p>
<p>sorry, the sum of the whole is much greater</p>
<p>than the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the beauty lies, I think.</p>
<p>And I think that extends to things like art as well.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something immeasurable about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something we can&rsquo;t break down to a narrow metric.</p>
<p>Does that extend to humans, you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So how can Instagram reveal that kind of beauty,</p>
<p>the complexity of a human being?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>And this takes us back to dating sites and Goodreads,</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Very good question.</p>
<p>I mean, well, I know what it shouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t try and like, right now,</p>
<p>you know, I was talking to like a social media expert</p>
<p>recently, because I was like, oh, I hate that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s such a thing as a social media expert?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, there are like agencies out there</p>
<p>that you can like outsource,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m thinking about working with one to like,</p>
<p>I want to start a podcast.</p>
<p>You should, you should have done it a long time ago.</p>
<p>Working on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be called Win Win.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to be about this like positive sum stuff.</p>
<p>And the thing that, you know, they always come back and say,</p>
<p>is like, well, you need to like figure out</p>
<p>what your thing is.</p>
<p>You know, you need to narrow down what your thing is</p>
<p>and then just follow that.</p>
<p>Have like a sort of a formula,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what people want.</p>
<p>They want to know that they&rsquo;re coming back</p>
<p>to the same thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the advice on YouTube, Twitter, you name it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, and the trouble with that</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a complexity reduction.</p>
<p>And generally speaking, you know,</p>
<p>complexity reduction is bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making things more, it&rsquo;s an oversimplification.</p>
<p>Not that simplification is always a bad thing.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re trying to take, you know,</p>
<p>what is social media doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to like encapsulate the human experience</p>
<p>and put it into digital form and commodify it to an extent.</p>
<p>That, so you do that, you compress people down</p>
<p>into these like narrow things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s kind of ultimately</p>
<p>fundamentally incompatible with at least</p>
<p>my definition of beauty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because there is some sense in which</p>
<p>a simplification sort of in the Einstein kind of sense</p>
<p>of a really complex idea, a simplification in a way</p>
<p>that still captures some core power of an idea of a person</p>
<p>is also beautiful.</p>
<p>And so maybe it&rsquo;s possible for social media to do that.</p>
<p>A presentation, a sort of a slither, a slice,</p>
<p>a look into a person&rsquo;s life that reveals something</p>
<p>real about them.</p>
<p>But in a simple way, in a way that can be displayed</p>
<p>graphically or through words.</p>
<p>Some way, I mean, in some way Twitter can do</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>A very few set of words can reveal the intricacies</p>
<p>of a person.</p>
<p>Of course, the viral machine that spreads those words</p>
<p>often results in people taking the thing out of context.</p>
<p>People often don&rsquo;t read tweets in the context</p>
<p>of the human being that wrote them.</p>
<p>The full history of the tweets they&rsquo;ve written,</p>
<p>the education level, the humor level,</p>
<p>the world view they&rsquo;re playing around with,</p>
<p>all that context is forgotten and people just see</p>
<p>the different words.</p>
<p>So that can lead to trouble.</p>
<p>But in a certain sense, if you do take it in context,</p>
<p>it reveals some kind of quirky little beautiful idea</p>
<p>or a profound little idea from that particular person</p>
<p>that shows something about that person.</p>
<p>So in that sense, Twitter can be more successful</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re talking about Mollux is driving</p>
<p>a better kind of incentive.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, how they can, like if we were to rewrite,</p>
<p>is there a way to rewrite the Twitter algorithm</p>
<p>so that it stops being the fertile breeding ground</p>
<p>of the culture wars?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s really what it is.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe I&rsquo;m giving it, Twitter too much power,</p>
<p>but just the more I looked into it</p>
<p>and I had conversations with Tristan Harris</p>
<p>from Center of Humane Technology.</p>
<p>And he explained it as like,</p>
<p>Twitter is where you have this amalgam of human culture</p>
<p>and then this terribly designed algorithm</p>
<p>that amplifies the craziest people</p>
<p>and the angriest most divisive takes and amplifies them.</p>
<p>And then the media, the mainstream media,</p>
<p>because all the journalists are also on Twitter,</p>
<p>they then are informed by that.</p>
<p>And so they draw out the stories they can</p>
<p>from this already like very boiling lava of rage</p>
<p>and then spread that to their millions</p>
<p>and millions of people who aren&rsquo;t even on Twitter.</p>
<p>And so I honestly, I think if I could press a button,</p>
<p>turn them off, I probably would at this point,</p>
<p>because I just don&rsquo;t see a way</p>
<p>of being compatible with healthiness,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>And so at least one way to like stem the tide</p>
<p>and make it less malachy would be to change,</p>
<p>at least if like it was on a subscription model,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s now not optimizing for impressions.</p>
<p>Cause basically what it wants is for people</p>
<p>to keep coming back as often as possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they get paid, right?</p>
<p>Every time an ad gets shown to someone</p>
<p>and the way is to get people constantly refreshing their feed.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to encourage addictive behaviors.</p>
<p>Whereas if someone, if they moved on</p>
<p>to at least a subscription model,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re getting the money either way,</p>
<p>whether someone comes back to the site once a month</p>
<p>or 500 times a month,</p>
<p>they get the same amount of money.</p>
<p>So now that takes away that incentive,</p>
<p>to use technology, to build,</p>
<p>to design an algorithm that is maximally addictive.</p>
<p>That would be one way, for example.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you still want people to,</p>
<p>yeah, I just feel like that just slows down,</p>
<p>creates friction in the virality of things.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>We need to slow down virality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>Virality is malach, to be clear.</p>
<p>So malach is always negative then?</p>
<p>Yes, by definition.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Competition is not always negative.</p>
<p>Competition is neutral.</p>
<p>I disagree with you that all virality is negative then,</p>
<p>is malach then.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a good intuition,</p>
<p>because we have a lot of data on virality being negative.</p>
<p>But I happen to believe that the core of human beings,</p>
<p>so most human beings want to be good</p>
<p>more than they want to be bad to each other.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>it might be just harder to engineer systems</p>
<p>that enable virality,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s possible to engineer systems that are viral</p>
<p>that enable virality.</p>
<p>And the kind of stuff that rises to the top</p>
<p>is things that are positive.</p>
<p>And positive, not like la la positive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like win win,</p>
<p>meaning a lot of people need to be challenged.</p>
<p>Wise things, yes.</p>
<p>You grow from it, it might challenge you,</p>
<p>you might not like it, but you ultimately grow from it.</p>
<p>And ultimately bring people together</p>
<p>as opposed to tear them apart.</p>
<p>I deeply want that to be true.</p>
<p>And I very much agree with you that people at their core</p>
<p>are on average good, care for each other,</p>
<p>as opposed to not.</p>
<p>Like I think it&rsquo;s actually a very small percentage</p>
<p>of people are truly wanting to do</p>
<p>just like destructive malicious things.</p>
<p>Most people are just trying to win their own little game.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t mean to be,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just stuck in this badly designed system.</p>
<p>That said, the current structure, yes,</p>
<p>is the current structure means that virality</p>
<p>is optimized towards Moloch.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean there aren&rsquo;t exceptions.</p>
<p>Sometimes positive stories do go viral</p>
<p>and I think we should study them.</p>
<p>I think there should be a whole field of study</p>
<p>into understanding, identifying memes</p>
<p>that above a certain threshold of the population</p>
<p>agree is a positive, happy, bringing people together meme.</p>
<p>The kind of thing that brings families together</p>
<p>that would normally argue about cultural stuff</p>
<p>at the table, at the dinner table.</p>
<p>Identify those memes and figure out what it was,</p>
<p>what was the ingredient that made them spread that day.</p>
<p>And also like not just like happiness</p>
<p>and connection between humans,</p>
<p>but connection between humans in other ways</p>
<p>that enables like productivity, like cooperation,</p>
<p>solving difficult problems and all those kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about let&rsquo;s be happy</p>
<p>and have a fulfilling lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also like, let&rsquo;s build cool shit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get excited.</p>
<p>Which is the spirit of collaboration,</p>
<p>which is deeply anti Moloch, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not using competition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, Moloch hates collaboration and coordination</p>
<p>and people working together.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, again, like the internet started out as that</p>
<p>and it could have been that,</p>
<p>but because of the way it was sort of structured</p>
<p>in terms of, you know, very lofty ideal,</p>
<p>they wanted everything to be open source,</p>
<p>open source and also free.</p>
<p>And, but they needed to find a way to pay the bills anyway,</p>
<p>because they were still building this</p>
<p>on top of our old economics system.</p>
<p>And so the way they did that</p>
<p>was through third party advertisement.</p>
<p>But that meant that things were very decoupled.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve got this third party interest,</p>
<p>which means that you&rsquo;re then like,</p>
<p>people having to optimize for that.</p>
<p>And that is, you know, the actual consumer</p>
<p>is actually the product,</p>
<p>not the person you&rsquo;re making the thing for.</p>
<p>In the end, you start making the thing for the advertiser.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why it then like breaks down.</p>
<p>Yeah, like it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s no clean solution to this.</p>
<p>And I, it&rsquo;s a really good suggestion by you actually</p>
<p>to like figure out how we can optimize virality</p>
<p>for positive sum topics.</p>
<p>I shall be the general of the love bot army.</p>
<p>Distributed.</p>
<p>Distributed, distributed, no, okay, yeah.</p>
<p>The power, just even in saying that,</p>
<p>the power already went to my head.</p>
<p>No, okay, you&rsquo;ve talked about quantifying your thinking.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about this,</p>
<p>sort of a game theoretic view on life</p>
<p>and putting probabilities behind estimates.</p>
<p>Like if you think about different trajectories</p>
<p>you can take through life,</p>
<p>just actually analyzing life in game theoretic way,</p>
<p>like your own life, like personal life.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve given an example</p>
<p>that you had an honest conversation with Igor</p>
<p>about like, how long is this relationship gonna last?</p>
<p>So similar to our sort of marriage problem</p>
<p>kind of discussion, having an honest conversation</p>
<p>about the probability of things</p>
<p>that we sometimes are a little bit too shy</p>
<p>or scared to think of in a probabilistic terms.</p>
<p>Can you speak to that kind of way of reasoning,</p>
<p>the good and the bad of that?</p>
<p>Can you do this kind of thing with human relations?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the scenario you&rsquo;re talking about, it was like.</p>
<p>Yeah, tell me about that scenario.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it was about a year into our relationship</p>
<p>and we were having a fairly heavy conversation</p>
<p>because we were trying to figure out</p>
<p>whether or not I was gonna sell my apartment.</p>
<p>Well, you know, he had already moved in,</p>
<p>but I think we were just figuring out</p>
<p>what like our longterm plans would be.</p>
<p>We should be by a place together, et cetera.</p>
<p>When you guys are having that conversation,</p>
<p>are you like drunk out of your mind on wine</p>
<p>or is he sober and you&rsquo;re actually having a serious?</p>
<p>I think we were sober.</p>
<p>How do you get to that conversation?</p>
<p>Because most people are kind of afraid</p>
<p>to have that kind of serious conversation.</p>
<p>Well, so our relationship was very,</p>
<p>well, first of all, we were good friends</p>
<p>for a couple of years before we even got romantic.</p>
<p>And when we did get romantic,</p>
<p>it was very clear that this was a big deal.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just like another, it wasn&rsquo;t a random thing.</p>
<p>So the probability of it being a big deal was high.</p>
<p>It was already very high.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;d been together for a year</p>
<p>and it had been pretty golden and wonderful.</p>
<p>So, you know, there was a lot of foundation already</p>
<p>where we felt very comfortable</p>
<p>having a lot of frank conversations.</p>
<p>But Igor&rsquo;s MO has always been much more than mine.</p>
<p>He was always from the outset,</p>
<p>like just in a relationship,</p>
<p>radical transparency and honesty is the way</p>
<p>because the truth is the truth,</p>
<p>whether you want to hide it or not, you know,</p>
<p>but it will come out eventually.</p>
<p>And if you aren&rsquo;t able to accept difficult things yourself,</p>
<p>then how could you possibly expect to be like</p>
<p>the most integral version that, you know,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t, the relationship needs this bedrock</p>
<p>of like honesty as a foundation more than anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really interesting,</p>
<p>but I would like to push against some of those ideas,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the down the line, yes, throw them up.</p>
<p>I just rudely interrupt.</p>
<p>That was fine.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we&rsquo;d been about together for a year</p>
<p>and things were good</p>
<p>and we were having this hard conversation</p>
<p>and then he was like, well, okay,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the likelihood that we&rsquo;re going to be together</p>
<p>in three years then?</p>
<p>Because I think it was roughly a three year time horizon.</p>
<p>And I was like, ooh, ooh, interesting.</p>
<p>And then we were like, actually wait,</p>
<p>before you said out loud,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s both write down our predictions formally</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;d been like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just getting into like effective altruism</p>
<p>and rationality at the time,</p>
<p>which is all about making formal predictions</p>
<p>as a means of measuring your own,</p>
<p>well, your own foresight essentially in a quantified way.</p>
<p>So we like both wrote down our percentages</p>
<p>and we also did a one year prediction</p>
<p>and a 10 year one as well.</p>
<p>So we got percentages for all three</p>
<p>and then we showed each other.</p>
<p>And I remember like having this moment of like, ooh,</p>
<p>because for the 10 year one, I was like, well, I mean,</p>
<p>I love him a lot,</p>
<p>but like a lot can happen in 10 years,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve only been together for,</p>
<p>so I was like, I think it&rsquo;s over 50%,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely not 90%.</p>
<p>And I remember like wrestling,</p>
<p>I was like, oh, but I don&rsquo;t want him to be hurt.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want him to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give a number lower than his.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking, I was like, ah, ah, don&rsquo;t game it.</p>
<p>This is an exercise in radical honesty.</p>
<p>So just give your real percentage.</p>
<p>And I think mine was like 75%.</p>
<p>And then we showed each other</p>
<p>and luckily we were fairly well aligned.</p>
<p>And, but honestly, even if we weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>20%.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>It definitely would have,</p>
<p>I, if his had been consistently lower than mine,</p>
<p>that would have rattled me for sure.</p>
<p>Whereas if it had been the other way around,</p>
<p>I think he would have,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just kind of like a water off a duck&rsquo;s back type of guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be like, okay, well, all right, we&rsquo;ll figure this out.</p>
<p>Well, did you guys provide error bars on the estimate?</p>
<p>Like the level of uncertainty?</p>
<p>They came built in.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t give formal plus or minus error bars.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t draw any or anything like that.</p>
<p>Well, I guess that&rsquo;s the question I have is,</p>
<p>did you feel informed enough to make such decisions?</p>
<p>Cause like, I feel like if you were,</p>
<p>if I were to do this kind of thing rigorously,</p>
<p>I would want some data.</p>
<p>I would want to set one of the assumptions you have</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re not that different from other relationships.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so I want to have some data about the way.</p>
<p>You want the base rates.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also actual trajectories of relationships.</p>
<p>I would love to have like time series data</p>
<p>about the ways that relationships fall apart or prosper,</p>
<p>how they collide with different life events,</p>
<p>losses, job changes, moving.</p>
<p>Both partners find jobs, only one has a job.</p>
<p>I want that kind of data</p>
<p>and how often the different trajectories change in life.</p>
<p>Like how informative is your past to your future?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole thing.</p>
<p>Like can you look at my life and have a good prediction</p>
<p>about in terms of my characteristics and my relationships,</p>
<p>what that&rsquo;s going to look like in the future or not?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know the answer to that question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be very ill informed in terms of making the probability.</p>
<p>I would be far, yeah, I just would be under informed.</p>
<p>I would be under informed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be over biasing to my prior experiences, I think.</p>
<p>Right, but as long as you&rsquo;re aware of that</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re honest with yourself,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re honest with the other person,</p>
<p>say, look, I have really wide error bars on this</p>
<p>for the following reasons, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I still think it&rsquo;s better than not trying</p>
<p>to quantify it at all.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to make really major</p>
<p>irreversible life decisions.</p>
<p>And I feel also the romantic nature of that question</p>
<p>for me personally, I try to live my life</p>
<p>thinking it&rsquo;s very close to 100%.</p>
<p>Like, allowing myself actually the,</p>
<p>this is the difficulty of this is allowing myself</p>
<p>to think differently, I feel like has</p>
<p>a psychological consequence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where that, that&rsquo;s one of my pushbacks</p>
<p>against radical honesty is this one particular perspective.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying you would rather give</p>
<p>a falsely high percentage to your partner.</p>
<p>Going back to the wide sage filth.</p>
<p>In order to sort of create this additional optimism.</p>
<p>Helmuth.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Of fake it till you make it.</p>
<p>The positive, the power of positive thinking.</p>
<p>Hashtag positivity.</p>
<p>Yeah, hashtag, it&rsquo;s with a hashtag.</p>
<p>Well, so that, and this comes back to this idea</p>
<p>of useful fictions, right?</p>
<p>And I agree, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a clear answer to this.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s actually quite subjective.</p>
<p>Some people this works better for than others.</p>
<p>You know, to be clear, Igor and I weren&rsquo;t doing</p>
<p>this formal prediction in it.</p>
<p>Like we did it with very much tongue in cheek.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like we were going to make,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it even would have drastically changed</p>
<p>what we decided to do even.</p>
<p>We kind of just did it more as a fun exercise.</p>
<p>For the consequence of that fun exercise,</p>
<p>you really actually kind of, there was a deep honesty to it.</p>
<p>Exactly, it was a deep, and it was, yeah,</p>
<p>it was just like this moment of reflection.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh wow, I actually have to think</p>
<p>like through this quite critically and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also what was interesting was I got to like check</p>
<p>in with what my desires were.</p>
<p>So there was one thing of like what my actual prediction is,</p>
<p>but what are my desires and could these desires</p>
<p>be affecting my predictions and so on.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s a method of rationality.</p>
<p>And I personally don&rsquo;t think it loses anything in terms of,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t take any of the magic away</p>
<p>from our relationship, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Like it brought us closer together because it was like,</p>
<p>we did this weird fun thing that I appreciate</p>
<p>a lot of people find quite strange.</p>
<p>And I think it was somewhat unique in our relationship</p>
<p>that both of us are very, we both love numbers,</p>
<p>we both love statistics, we&rsquo;re both poker players.</p>
<p>So this was kind of like our safe space anyway.</p>
<p>For others, one partner really might not</p>
<p>like that kind of stuff at all, in which case</p>
<p>this is not a good exercise to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend it to everybody.</p>
<p>But I do think there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s interesting sometimes</p>
<p>to poke holes in the probe at these things</p>
<p>that we consider so sacred that we can&rsquo;t try</p>
<p>to quantify them, which is interesting</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s in tension with like the idea</p>
<p>of what we just talked about with beauty</p>
<p>and like what makes something beautiful,</p>
<p>the fact that you can&rsquo;t measure everything about it.</p>
<p>And perhaps something shouldn&rsquo;t be tried to measure,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s wrong to completely try and value</p>
<p>the utilitarian, put a utilitarian frame</p>
<p>of measuring the utility of a tree in its entirety.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe we should, maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ambivalent on that.</p>
<p>But overall, people have too many biases.</p>
<p>People are overly biased against trying to do</p>
<p>like a quantified cost benefit analysis</p>
<p>on really tough life decisions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, just go with your gut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, sure, but guts, our intuitions</p>
<p>are best suited for things that we&rsquo;ve got tons</p>
<p>of experience in, then we can really, you don&rsquo;t trust on it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a decision we&rsquo;ve made many times,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s like, should I marry this person</p>
<p>or should I buy this house over that house?</p>
<p>You only make those decisions a couple of times</p>
<p>in your life, maybe.</p>
<p>Well, I would love to know, there&rsquo;s a balance,</p>
<p>probably is a personal balance to strike</p>
<p>is the amount of rationality you apply</p>
<p>to a question versus the useful fiction,</p>
<p>the fake it till you make it.</p>
<p>For example, just talking to soldiers in Ukraine,</p>
<p>you ask them, what&rsquo;s the probability of you winning,</p>
<p>Ukraine winning?</p>
<p>Almost everybody I talk to is 100%.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And you listen to the experts, right?</p>
<p>They say all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They are, first of all, the morale there</p>
<p>is higher than probably enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to a war zone before this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve read about many wars</p>
<p>and I think the morale in Ukraine is higher</p>
<p>than almost any war I&rsquo;ve read about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s every single person in the country</p>
<p>is proud to fight for their country.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Everybody, not just soldiers, not everybody.</p>
<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Specifically more than in other wars?</p>
<p>I think because there&rsquo;s perhaps a dormant desire</p>
<p>for the citizens of this country to find</p>
<p>the identity of this country because it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>going through this 30 year process</p>
<p>of different factions and political bickering</p>
<p>and they haven&rsquo;t had, as they talk about,</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t had their independence war.</p>
<p>They say all great nations have had an independence war.</p>
<p>They had to fight for their independence,</p>
<p>for the discovery of the identity of the core</p>
<p>of the ideals that unify us and they haven&rsquo;t had that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s constantly been factions, there&rsquo;s been divisions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been pressures from empires,</p>
<p>from the United States and from Russia,</p>
<p>from NATO and Europe, everybody telling them what to do.</p>
<p>Now they want to discover who they are</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s that kind of sense that we&rsquo;re going to fight</p>
<p>for the safety of our homeland,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also gonna fight for our identity.</p>
<p>And that, on top of the fact that there&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>if you look at the history of Ukraine</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s certain other countries like this,</p>
<p>there are certain cultures that are feisty</p>
<p>in their pride of being the citizens of that nation.</p>
<p>Ukraine is that, Poland was that.</p>
<p>You just look at history.</p>
<p>In certain countries, you do not want to occupy.</p>
<p>I mean, both Stalin and Hitler talked about Poland</p>
<p>in this way, they&rsquo;re like, this is a big problem</p>
<p>if we occupy this land for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna be a pain in their ass.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to want to be occupied.</p>
<p>And certain other countries are pragmatic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, well, leaders come and go.</p>
<p>I guess this is good.</p>
<p>Ukraine just doesn&rsquo;t have, Ukrainians,</p>
<p>throughout the 20th century,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t seem to be the kind of people</p>
<p>that just sit calmly and let the quote unquote occupiers</p>
<p>impose their rules.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting though, because you said it&rsquo;s always been</p>
<p>under conflict and leaders have come and gone.</p>
<p>So you would expect them to actually be the opposite</p>
<p>under that like reasoning.</p>
<p>Well, because it&rsquo;s a very fertile land,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great for agriculture.</p>
<p>So a lot of people want to,</p>
<p>I mean, I think they&rsquo;ve developed this culture</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve constantly been occupied</p>
<p>by different people for the different peoples.</p>
<p>And so maybe there is something to that</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve constantly had to feel like within the blood</p>
<p>of the generations, there&rsquo;s the struggle against the man,</p>
<p>against the imposition of rules, against oppression</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff, and that stays with them.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a will there, but a lot of other aspects</p>
<p>are also part of it that has to do with</p>
<p>the reverse Mollet kind of situation</p>
<p>where social media has definitely played a part of it.</p>
<p>Also different charismatic individuals</p>
<p>have had to play a part.</p>
<p>The fact that the president of the nation, Zelensky,</p>
<p>stayed in Kiev during the invasion</p>
<p>is a huge inspiration to them</p>
<p>because most leaders, as you can imagine,</p>
<p>when the capital of the nation is under attack,</p>
<p>the wise thing, the smart thing</p>
<p>that the United States advised Zelensky to do</p>
<p>is to flee and to be the leader of the nation</p>
<p>from a distant place.</p>
<p>He said, fuck that, I&rsquo;m staying put.</p>
<p>Everyone around him, there was a pressure to leave</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t, and those singular acts</p>
<p>really can unify a nation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that criticize Zelensky</p>
<p>within Ukraine.</p>
<p>Before the war, he was very unpopular, even still,</p>
<p>but they put that aside, especially that singular act</p>
<p>of staying in the capital.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of those kinds of things come together</p>
<p>to create something within people.</p>
<p>These things always, of course, though,</p>
<p>how zoomed out of a view do you wanna take?</p>
<p>Because, yeah, you describe it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an anti Moloch thing happened within Ukraine</p>
<p>because it brought the Ukrainian people together</p>
<p>in order to fight a common enemy.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a good thing, maybe that&rsquo;s a bad thing.</p>
<p>In the end, we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how this is all gonna play out, right?</p>
<p>But if you zoom it out from a level, on a global level,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re coming together to fight that,</p>
<p>that could make a conflict larger.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right answer is here.</p>
<p>It seems like a good thing that they came together,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know how this is all gonna play out.</p>
<p>If this all turns into nuclear war, we&rsquo;ll be like,</p>
<p>okay, that was the bad, that was the&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, so I was describing the reverse Moloch</p>
<p>for the local level.</p>
<p>Exactly, yes.</p>
<p>Now, this is where the experts come in and they say,</p>
<p>well, if you channel most of the resources of the nation</p>
<p>and the nations supporting Ukraine into the war effort,</p>
<p>are you not beating the drums of war</p>
<p>that is much bigger than Ukraine?</p>
<p>In fact, even the Ukrainian leaders</p>
<p>are speaking of it this way.</p>
<p>This is not a war between two nations.</p>
<p>This is the early days of a world war,</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t play this correctly.</p>
<p>Yes, and we need cool heads from our leaders.</p>
<p>So from Ukraine&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>Ukraine needs to win the war</p>
<p>because what does winning the war mean</p>
<p>is coming to peace negotiations, an agreement</p>
<p>that guarantees no more invasions.</p>
<p>And then you make an agreement</p>
<p>about what land belongs to who.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you stop that.</p>
<p>And basically from their perspective</p>
<p>is you want to demonstrate to the rest of the world</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s watching carefully, including Russia and China</p>
<p>and different players on the geopolitical stage,</p>
<p>that this kind of conflict is not going to be productive</p>
<p>if you engage in it.</p>
<p>So you want to teach everybody a lesson,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not do World War III.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be bad for everybody.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a lose, lose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deep lose, lose.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s actually a correct,</p>
<p>when I zoom out, I mean, 99% of what I think about</p>
<p>is just individual human beings and human lives</p>
<p>and just that war is horrible.</p>
<p>But when you zoom out and think</p>
<p>from a geopolitics perspective,</p>
<p>we should realize that it&rsquo;s entirely possible</p>
<p>that we will see a World War III in the 21st century.</p>
<p>And this is like a dress rehearsal for that.</p>
<p>And so the way we play this as a human civilization</p>
<p>will define whether we do or don&rsquo;t have a World War III.</p>
<p>How we discuss war, how we discuss nuclear war,</p>
<p>the kind of leaders we elect and prop up,</p>
<p>the kind of memes we circulate,</p>
<p>because you have to be very careful</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re being pro Ukraine, for example,</p>
<p>you have to realize that you&rsquo;re being,</p>
<p>you are also indirectly feeding</p>
<p>the ever increasing military industrial complex.</p>
<p>So you have to be extremely careful</p>
<p>that when you say pro Ukraine or pro anybody,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pro human beings, not pro the machine</p>
<p>that creates narratives that says it&rsquo;s pro human beings.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s actually, if you look at the raw use</p>
<p>of funds and resources, it&rsquo;s actually pro making weapons</p>
<p>and shooting bullets and dropping bombs.</p>
<p>The real, we have to just somehow get the meme</p>
<p>into everyone&rsquo;s heads that the real enemy is war itself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the enemy we need to defeat.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean to say that there isn&rsquo;t justification</p>
<p>for small local scenarios, adversarial conflicts.</p>
<p>If you have a leader who is starting wars,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on the side of team war, basically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re on the side of team country,</p>
<p>whatever that country is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re on the side of team war.</p>
<p>So that needs to be stopped and put down.</p>
<p>But you also have to find a way</p>
<p>that your corrective measure doesn&rsquo;t actually then</p>
<p>end up being coopted by the war machine</p>
<p>and creating greater war.</p>
<p>Again, the playing field is finite.</p>
<p>The scale of conflict is now getting so big</p>
<p>that the weapons that can be used are so mass destructive</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t afford another giant conflict.</p>
<p>We just, we won&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>What existential threat in terms of us not making it</p>
<p>are you most worried about?</p>
<p>What existential threat to human civilization?</p>
<p>We got like, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Going down a dark path, huh?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, but no, well, no, it&rsquo;s a dark.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s like, well, while we&rsquo;re in the somber place,</p>
<p>we might as well.</p>
<p>Some of my best friends are dark paths.</p>
<p>What worries you most?</p>
<p>We mentioned asteroids, we mentioned AGI, nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The one that&rsquo;s on my mind the most,</p>
<p>mostly because I think it&rsquo;s the one where we have</p>
<p>actually a real chance to move the needle on</p>
<p>in a positive direction or more specifically,</p>
<p>stop some really bad things from happening,</p>
<p>really dumb, avoidable things is bio risks.</p>
<p>In what kind of bio risks?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many fun options.</p>
<p>So many, so of course, we have natural risks</p>
<p>from natural pandemics, naturally occurring viruses</p>
<p>or pathogens, and then also as time and technology goes on</p>
<p>and technology becomes more and more democratized</p>
<p>and into the hands of more and more people,</p>
<p>the risk of synthetic pathogens.</p>
<p>And whether or not you fall into the camp of COVID</p>
<p>was gain of function accidental lab leak</p>
<p>or whether it was purely naturally occurring,</p>
<p>either way, we are facing a future where synthetic pathogens</p>
<p>or like human meddled with pathogens</p>
<p>either accidentally get out or get into the hands</p>
<p>of bad actors who, whether they&rsquo;re omnicidal maniacs,</p>
<p>you know, either way.</p>
<p>And so that means we need more robustness for that.</p>
<p>And you would think that us having this nice little dry run,</p>
<p>which is what as awful as COVID was,</p>
<p>and all those poor people that died,</p>
<p>it was still like child&rsquo;s play compared</p>
<p>to what a future one could be in terms of fatality rate.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;d think that we would then be coming,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d be much more robust in our pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, the budget in the last two years for the US,</p>
<p>sorry, they just did this, I can&rsquo;t remember the name</p>
<p>of what the actual budget was,</p>
<p>but it was like a multi trillion dollar budget</p>
<p>that the US just set aside.</p>
<p>And originally in that, you know, considering that COVID</p>
<p>cost multiple trillions to the economy, right?</p>
<p>The original allocation in this new budget</p>
<p>for future pandemic preparedness was 60 billion,</p>
<p>so tiny proportion of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s proceeded to get whittled down to like 30 billion,</p>
<p>to 15 billion, all the way down to 2 billion</p>
<p>out of multiple trillions.</p>
<p>For a thing that has just cost us multiple trillions,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve just finished, we&rsquo;re barely even,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not even really out of it.</p>
<p>It basically got whittled down to nothing</p>
<p>because for some reason people think that,</p>
<p>oh, all right, we&rsquo;ve got the pandemic,</p>
<p>out of the way, that was that one.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that people are,</p>
<p>and I say this with all due respect</p>
<p>to a lot of the science community,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an immense amount of naivety about,</p>
<p>they think that nature is the main risk moving forward,</p>
<p>and it really isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I think nothing demonstrates this more</p>
<p>than this project that I was just reading about</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of being proposed right now called Deep Vision.</p>
<p>And the idea is to go out into the wilds,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not talking about just like within cities,</p>
<p>like deep into like caves that people don&rsquo;t go to,</p>
<p>deep into the Arctic, wherever, scour the earth</p>
<p>for whatever the most dangerous possible pathogens</p>
<p>could be that they can find.</p>
<p>And then not only do, try and find these,</p>
<p>bring samples of them back to laboratories.</p>
<p>And again, whether you think COVID was a lab leak or not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna get into that,</p>
<p>but we have historically had so many, as a civilization,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had so many lab leaks</p>
<p>from even like the highest level security things.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just, people should go and just read it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a comedy show of just how many they are,</p>
<p>how leaky these labs are,</p>
<p>even when they do their best efforts.</p>
<p>So bring these things then back to civilization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s step one of the badness.</p>
<p>Then the next step would be to then categorize them,</p>
<p>do experiments on them and categorize them</p>
<p>by their level of potential.</p>
<p>And then the piece de resistance on this plan</p>
<p>is to then publish that information freely on the internet</p>
<p>about all these pathogens, including their genome,</p>
<p>which is literally like the building instructions</p>
<p>of how to do them on the internet.</p>
<p>And this is something that genuinely,</p>
<p>a pocket of the like bio,</p>
<p>of the scientific community thinks is a good idea.</p>
<p>And I think on expectation, like the,</p>
<p>and their argument is, is that, oh, this is good,</p>
<p>because it might buy us some time to develop the vaccines,</p>
<p>which, okay, sure, maybe would have made sense</p>
<p>prior to mRNA technology, but you know, like they,</p>
<p>mRNA, we can develop a vaccine now</p>
<p>when we find a new pathogen within a couple of days.</p>
<p>Now then there&rsquo;s all the trials and so on.</p>
<p>Those trials would have to happen anyway,</p>
<p>in the case of a brand new thing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saving maybe a couple of days.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the upside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the downside is you&rsquo;re not only giving,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not only giving the vaccine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bringing the risk of these pathogens</p>
<p>of like getting leaked,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re literally handing it out</p>
<p>to every bad actor on earth who would be doing cartwheels.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m talking about like Kim Jong Un, ISIS,</p>
<p>people who like want,</p>
<p>they think the rest of the world is their enemy.</p>
<p>And in some cases they think that killing it themselves</p>
<p>is like a noble cause.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re literally giving them the building blocks</p>
<p>of how to do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most batshit idea I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>Like on expectation, it&rsquo;s probably like minus EV</p>
<p>of like multiple billions of lives</p>
<p>if they actually succeeded in doing this.</p>
<p>Certainly in the tens or hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>So the cost benefit is so unbelievably, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>And I was trying to wrap my head around like why,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s going wrong in people&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>to think that this is a good idea?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s malice or anything like that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s that people don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the proponents, they&rsquo;re actually overly naive</p>
<p>about the interactions of humanity.</p>
<p>And well, like there are bad actors</p>
<p>who will use this for bad things.</p>
<p>Because not only will it,</p>
<p>if you publish this information,</p>
<p>even if a bad actor couldn&rsquo;t physically make it themselves,</p>
<p>which given in 10 years time,</p>
<p>like the technology is getting cheaper and easier to use.</p>
<p>But even if they couldn&rsquo;t make it, they could now bluff it.</p>
<p>Like what would you do if there&rsquo;s like some deadly new virus</p>
<p>that we were published on the internet</p>
<p>in terms of its building blocks?</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un could be like,</p>
<p>hey, if you don&rsquo;t let me build my nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna release this, I&rsquo;ve managed to build it.</p>
<p>Well, now he&rsquo;s actually got a credible bluff.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just like handing the keys,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s handing weapons of mass destruction to people.</p>
<p>Makes no sense.</p>
<p>The possible, I agree with you,</p>
<p>but the possible world in which it might make sense</p>
<p>is if the good guys, which is a whole nother problem,</p>
<p>defining who the good guys are,</p>
<p>but the good guys are like an order of magnitude</p>
<p>higher competence.</p>
<p>And so they can stay ahead of the bad actors</p>
<p>by just being very good at the defense.</p>
<p>By very good, not meaning like a little bit better,</p>
<p>but an order of magnitude better.</p>
<p>But of course the question is,</p>
<p>in each of those individual disciplines, is that feasible?</p>
<p>Can you, can the bad actors,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t have the competence leapfrog</p>
<p>to the place where the good guys are?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I would agree in principle</p>
<p>with pertaining to this like particular plan of like,</p>
<p>that, you know, with the thing I described,</p>
<p>this deep vision thing, where at least then</p>
<p>that would maybe make sense for steps one and step two</p>
<p>of like getting the information,</p>
<p>but then why would you release it,</p>
<p>the information to your literal enemies?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s, that makes,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t fit at all in that perspective</p>
<p>of like trying to be ahead of them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re literally handing them the weapon.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s different levels of release, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the kind of secrecy</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t give it to anybody,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a release where you incrementally give it</p>
<p>to like major labs.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not public release, but it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving it to major labs.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s different layers of reasonability, but.</p>
<p>But the problem there is it&rsquo;s going to,</p>
<p>if you go anywhere beyond like complete secrecy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna leak.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing, it&rsquo;s very hard to keep secrets.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s still. Information is.</p>
<p>So you might as well release it to the public</p>
<p>is that argument.</p>
<p>So you either go complete secrecy</p>
<p>or you release it to the public.</p>
<p>So, which is essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to leak anyway,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t do complete secrecy.</p>
<p>Right, which is why you shouldn&rsquo;t get the information</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, what, in that, I think.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a solution.</p>
<p>Yeah, the solution is either don&rsquo;t get the information</p>
<p>in the first place or B, keep it incredibly,</p>
<p>incredibly contained.</p>
<p>See, I think, I think it really matters</p>
<p>which discipline we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So in the case of biology, I do think you&rsquo;re very right.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t even be, it should be forbidden</p>
<p>to even like, think about that.</p>
<p>Meaning don&rsquo;t collect, don&rsquo;t just even collect</p>
<p>the information, but like, don&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>I mean, gain of function research is a really iffy area.</p>
<p>Like you start.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s all about cost benefits, right?</p>
<p>There are some scenarios where I could imagine</p>
<p>the cost benefit of a gain of function research</p>
<p>is very, very clear, where you&rsquo;ve evaluated</p>
<p>all the potential risks, factored in the probability</p>
<p>that things can go wrong.</p>
<p>And like, you know, not only known unknowns,</p>
<p>but unknown unknowns as well, tried to quantify that.</p>
<p>And then even then it&rsquo;s like orders of magnitude</p>
<p>better to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m behind that argument.</p>
<p>But the point is that there&rsquo;s this like,</p>
<p>naivety that&rsquo;s preventing people from even doing</p>
<p>the cost benefit properly on a lot of the things</p>
<p>because, you know, I get it.</p>
<p>The science community, again, I don&rsquo;t want to bucket</p>
<p>the science community, but like some people</p>
<p>within the science community just think</p>
<p>that everyone&rsquo;s good and everyone just cares</p>
<p>about getting knowledge and doing the best for the world.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>I wish we lived in that world, but we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lie.</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;ve been criticizing the science community</p>
<p>broadly quite a bit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many brilliant people that brilliance</p>
<p>is somehow a hindrance sometimes</p>
<p>because it has a bunch of blind spots.</p>
<p>And then you start to look at the history of science,</p>
<p>how easily it&rsquo;s been used by dictators</p>
<p>to any conclusion they want.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s dark how you can use brilliant people</p>
<p>that like playing the little game of science</p>
<p>because it is a fun game.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re building, you&rsquo;re going to conferences,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building on top of each other&rsquo;s ideas,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Hi, I think I&rsquo;ve realized how this particular molecule works</p>
<p>and I could do this kind of experiment</p>
<p>and everyone else is impressed.</p>
<p>Ooh, cool.</p>
<p>No, I think you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>Let me show you why you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And that little game, everyone gets really excited</p>
<p>and they get excited, oh, I came up with a pill</p>
<p>that solves this problem</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to help a bunch of people.</p>
<p>And I came up with a giant study</p>
<p>that shows the exact probability it&rsquo;s going to help or not.</p>
<p>And you get lost in this game</p>
<p>and you forget to realize this game, just like Moloch,</p>
<p>can have like&hellip;</p>
<p>Unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Unintended consequences that might</p>
<p>destroy human civilization.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or divide human civilization</p>
<p>or have dire geopolitical consequences.</p>
<p>I mean, the effects of, I mean, it&rsquo;s just so&hellip;</p>
<p>The most destructive effects of COVID</p>
<p>have nothing to do with the biology of the virus,</p>
<p>it seems like.</p>
<p>I mean, I could just list them forever,</p>
<p>but like one of them is the complete distress</p>
<p>of public institutions.</p>
<p>The other one is because of that public distress,</p>
<p>I feel like if a much worse pandemic came along,</p>
<p>we as a world have now cried wolf.</p>
<p>And if an actual wolf now comes,</p>
<p>people will be like, fuck masks, fuck&hellip;</p>
<p>Fuck vaccines, yeah.</p>
<p>Fuck everything.</p>
<p>And they won&rsquo;t be&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll distrust every single thing</p>
<p>that any major institution is going to tell them.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>like there were certain actions made by</p>
<p>certain health public figures where they told,</p>
<p>they very knowingly told it was a white lie,</p>
<p>it was intended in the best possible way,</p>
<p>such as early on when there was clearly a shortage of masks.</p>
<p>And so they said to the public,</p>
<p>oh, don&rsquo;t get masks, there&rsquo;s no evidence that they work.</p>
<p>Or don&rsquo;t get them, they don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>In fact, it might even make it worse.</p>
<p>You might even spread it more.</p>
<p>Like that was the real like stinker.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, unless you know how to do it properly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna make that you&rsquo;re gonna get sicker</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re more likely to catch the virus,</p>
<p>which is just absolute crap.</p>
<p>And they put that out there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty clear the reason why they did that</p>
<p>was because there was actually a shortage of masks</p>
<p>and they really needed it for health workers,</p>
<p>which makes sense.</p>
<p>Like, I agree, like, you know,</p>
<p>but the cost of lying to the public</p>
<p>when that then comes out,</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t as stupid as they think they are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think where this distrust of experts</p>
<p>has largely come from.</p>
<p>A, they&rsquo;ve lied to people overtly,</p>
<p>but B, people have been treated like idiots.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not to say that there aren&rsquo;t a lot</p>
<p>of stupid people who have a lot of wacky ideas</p>
<p>around COVID and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>But if you treat the general public like children,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to see that, they&rsquo;re going to notice that.</p>
<p>And that is going to just like absolutely decimate the trust</p>
<p>in the public institutions that we depend upon.</p>
<p>And honestly, the best thing that could happen,</p>
<p>I wish like if like Fauci or, you know,</p>
<p>and these other like leaders who, I mean, God,</p>
<p>I would, I can&rsquo;t imagine how nightmare his job has been</p>
<p>for the last few years, hell on earth.</p>
<p>Like, so, you know, I, you know,</p>
<p>I have a lot of sort of sympathy</p>
<p>for the position he&rsquo;s been in.</p>
<p>But like, if he could just come out and be like,</p>
<p>okay, look, guys, hands up,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t handle this as well as we could have.</p>
<p>These are all the things I would have done differently</p>
<p>in hindsight.</p>
<p>I apologize for this and this and this and this.</p>
<p>That would go so far.</p>
<p>And maybe I&rsquo;m being naive, who knows,</p>
<p>maybe this would backfire, but I don&rsquo;t think it would.</p>
<p>Like to someone like me even,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ve like, I&rsquo;ve lost trust</p>
<p>in a lot of these things.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m fortunate that I at least know people</p>
<p>who I can go to who I think are good,</p>
<p>like have good epistemics on this stuff.</p>
<p>But you know, if they, if they could sort of put their hands</p>
<p>on my go, okay, these are the spots where we screwed up.</p>
<p>This, this, this, this was our reasons.</p>
<p>Yeah, we actually told a little white lie here.</p>
<p>We did it for this reason.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really sorry.</p>
<p>Where they just did the radical honesty thing,</p>
<p>the radical transparency thing,</p>
<p>that would go so far to rebuilding public trust.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what needs to happen.</p>
<p>Otherwise.</p>
<p>I totally agree with you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, yeah, his job was very tough</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things, but I see arrogance</p>
<p>and arrogance prevented him from being honest</p>
<p>in that way previously.</p>
<p>And I think arrogance will prevent him</p>
<p>from being honest in that way.</p>
<p>Now we need leaders.</p>
<p>I think young people are seeing that,</p>
<p>that kind of talking down to people</p>
<p>from a position of power, I hope is the way of the past.</p>
<p>People really like authenticity</p>
<p>and they like leaders that are like a man</p>
<p>and a woman of the people.</p>
<p>And I think that just.</p>
<p>I mean, he still has a chance to do that, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t wanna, you know, I don&rsquo;t think, you know,</p>
<p>if I doubt he&rsquo;s listening, but if he is like,</p>
<p>hey, I think, you know, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s irredeemable</p>
<p>by any means.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, you know, I don&rsquo;t have an opinion</p>
<p>whether there was arrogance or there or not.</p>
<p>Just know that I think like coming clean on the, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s understandable to have fucked up during this pandemic.</p>
<p>Like I won&rsquo;t expect any government to handle it well</p>
<p>because it was so difficult, like so many moving pieces,</p>
<p>so much like lack of information and so on.</p>
<p>But the step to rebuilding trust is to go, okay, look,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing a scrutiny of where we went wrong.</p>
<p>And for my part, I did this wrong in this part.</p>
<p>And that would be huge.</p>
<p>All of us can do that.</p>
<p>I mean, I was struggling for a while</p>
<p>whether I want to talk to him or not.</p>
<p>I talked to his boss, Francis Collins.</p>
<p>Another person that&rsquo;s screwed up in terms of trust,</p>
<p>lost a little bit of my respect too.</p>
<p>There seems to have been a kind of dishonesty</p>
<p>in the backrooms in that they didn&rsquo;t trust people</p>
<p>to be intelligent.</p>
<p>Like we need to tell them what&rsquo;s good for them.</p>
<p>We know what&rsquo;s good for them.</p>
<p>That kind of idea.</p>
<p>To be fair, the thing that&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s it called?</p>
<p>I heard the phrase today, nut picking.</p>
<p>Social media does that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got like nitpicking.</p>
<p>Nut picking is where the craziest, stupidest,</p>
<p>you know, if you have a group of people,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say people who are vaccine,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the term anti vaccine,</p>
<p>people who are vaccine hesitant, vaccine speculative.</p>
<p>So what social media did or the media or anyone,</p>
<p>their opponents would do is pick the craziest example.</p>
<p>So the ones who are like,</p>
<p>I think I need to inject myself with motor oil</p>
<p>up my ass or something.</p>
<p>Select the craziest ones and then have that beamed too.</p>
<p>So from like someone like Fauci or Francis&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they get because they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>the same social media stuff as us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting the same media reports.</p>
<p>I mean, they might get some more information,</p>
<p>but they too are gonna get the nuts portrayed to them.</p>
<p>So they probably have a misrepresentation</p>
<p>of what the actual public&rsquo;s intelligence is.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just, yes.</p>
<p>And that just means they&rsquo;re not social media savvy.</p>
<p>So one of the skills of being on social media</p>
<p>is to be able to filter that in your mind,</p>
<p>like to understand, to put into proper context.</p>
<p>To realize that what you are seeing,</p>
<p>social media is not anywhere near</p>
<p>an accurate representation of humanity.</p>
<p>Nut picking, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong</p>
<p>with putting motor oil up your ass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of the better aspects of,</p>
<p>I do this every weekend.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Where the hell did that analogy come from in my mind?</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think you need to, there&rsquo;s some Freudian thing</p>
<p>you would need to deeply investigate with a therapist.</p>
<p>Okay, what about AI?</p>
<p>Are you worried about AGI, super intelligence systems</p>
<p>or paperclip maximizer type of situation?</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m definitely worried about it,</p>
<p>but I feel kind of bipolar in the,</p>
<p>some days I wake up and I&rsquo;m like.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re excited about the future?</p>
<p>Well, exactly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wow, we can unlock the mysteries of the universe.</p>
<p>You know, escape the game.</p>
<p>And this, you know,</p>
<p>because I spend all my time thinking</p>
<p>about these molecule problems that, you know,</p>
<p>what is the solution to them?</p>
<p>What, you know, in some ways you need this like</p>
<p>omni benevolent, omniscient, omni wise coordination mechanism</p>
<p>that can like make us all not do the molecule thing</p>
<p>or like provide the infrastructure</p>
<p>or redesign the system so that it&rsquo;s not vulnerable</p>
<p>to this molecule process.</p>
<p>And in some ways, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the strongest argument to me</p>
<p>for like the race to build AGI</p>
<p>is that maybe, you know, we can&rsquo;t survive without it.</p>
<p>But the flip side to that is the,</p>
<p>the unfortunately now that there&rsquo;s multiple actors</p>
<p>trying to build AI, AGI, you know,</p>
<p>this was fine 10 years ago when it was just DeepMind,</p>
<p>but then other companies started up</p>
<p>and now it created a race dynamic.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s the whole thing.</p>
<p>Is it the same, it&rsquo;s got the same problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like whichever company is the one that like optimizes</p>
<p>for speed at the cost of safety</p>
<p>will get the competitive advantage.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re the more likely the ones to build the AGI,</p>
<p>you know, and that&rsquo;s the same cycle that you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no clear solution to that</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t just go like slapping,</p>
<p>if you go and try and like stop all the different companies,</p>
<p>then it will, you know, the good ones will stop</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the ones, you know,</p>
<p>within the West&rsquo;s reach,</p>
<p>but then that leaves all the other ones to continue</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re even more likely.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a very difficult problem</p>
<p>with no clean solution.</p>
<p>And, you know, at the same time, you know,</p>
<p>I know at least some of the folks at DeepMind</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re incredible and they&rsquo;re thinking about this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very aware of this problem.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, you know,</p>
<p>I think some of the smartest people on earth.</p>
<p>Yeah, the culture is important there</p>
<p>because they are thinking about that</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re some of the best machine learning engineers.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible to have a company or a community of people</p>
<p>that are both great engineers</p>
<p>and are thinking about the philosophical topics.</p>
<p>Exactly, and importantly, they&rsquo;re also game theorists,</p>
<p>you know, and because this is ultimately</p>
<p>a game theory problem, the thing, this Moloch mechanism</p>
<p>and like, you know, how do we voice arms race scenarios?</p>
<p>You need people who aren&rsquo;t naive to be thinking about this.</p>
<p>And again, like luckily there&rsquo;s a lot of smart,</p>
<p>non naive game theorists within that group.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m concerned about it and I think it&rsquo;s again,</p>
<p>a thing that we need people to be thinking about</p>
<p>in terms of like, how do we create,</p>
<p>how do we mitigate the arms race dynamics</p>
<p>and how do we solve the thing of,</p>
<p>Bostrom calls it the orthogonality problem whereby,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s obviously there&rsquo;s a chance, you know,</p>
<p>the belief, the hope is,</p>
<p>is that you build something that&rsquo;s super intelligent</p>
<p>and by definition of being super intelligent,</p>
<p>it will also become super wise</p>
<p>and have the wisdom to know what the right goals are.</p>
<p>And hopefully those goals include keeping humanity alive.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But Bostrom says that actually those two things,</p>
<p>you know, super intelligence and super wisdom</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t necessarily correlated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually kind of orthogonal things.</p>
<p>And how do we make it so that they are correlated?</p>
<p>How do we guarantee it?</p>
<p>Because we need it to be guaranteed really,</p>
<p>to know that we&rsquo;re doing the thing safely.</p>
<p>But I think that like merging of intelligence and wisdom,</p>
<p>at least my hope is that this whole process</p>
<p>happens sufficiently slowly</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re constantly having these kinds of debates</p>
<p>that we have enough time to figure out</p>
<p>how to modify each version of the system</p>
<p>as it becomes more and more intelligent.</p>
<p>Yes, buying time is a good thing, definitely.</p>
<p>Anything that slows everything down.</p>
<p>We just, everyone needs to chill out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got millennia to figure this out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or at least, at least, well, it depends.</p>
<p>Again, some people think that, you know,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t even make it through the next few decades</p>
<p>without having some kind of</p>
<p>omni wise coordination mechanism.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also an argument to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, there is, I&rsquo;m suspicious of that kind of thinking</p>
<p>because it seems like the entirety of human history</p>
<p>has people in it that are like predicting doom</p>
<p>just around the corner.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about us</p>
<p>that is strangely attracted to that thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like fun to think about</p>
<p>the destruction of everything.</p>
<p>Just objectively speaking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked and listened to a bunch of people</p>
<p>and they are gravitating towards that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost, I think it&rsquo;s the same thing</p>
<p>that people love about conspiracy theories</p>
<p>is they love to be the person that kind of figured out</p>
<p>some deep fundamental thing about the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be, it&rsquo;s going to mark something</p>
<p>extremely important about the history of human civilization</p>
<p>because then I will be important.</p>
<p>When in reality, most of us will be forgotten</p>
<p>and life will go on.</p>
<p>And one of the sad things about</p>
<p>whenever anything traumatic happens to you,</p>
<p>whenever you lose loved ones or just tragedy happens,</p>
<p>you realize life goes on.</p>
<p>Even after a nuclear war that will wipe out</p>
<p>some large percentage of the population</p>
<p>and will torture people for years to come</p>
<p>because of the effects of a nuclear winter,</p>
<p>people will still survive.</p>
<p>Life will still go on.</p>
<p>I mean, it depends on the kind of nuclear war.</p>
<p>But in the case of nuclear war, it will still go on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the amazing things about life.</p>
<p>It finds a way.</p>
<p>And so in that sense, I just,</p>
<p>I feel like the doom and gloom thing</p>
<p>is a&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, what we don&rsquo;t, yeah,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want a self fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly.</p>
<p>Yes, and I very much agree with that.</p>
<p>And I even have a slight feeling</p>
<p>from the amount of time we spent in this conversation</p>
<p>talking about this,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, is this even a net positive</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s like making everyone feel,</p>
<p>oh, in some ways, like making people imagine</p>
<p>these bad scenarios can be a self fulfilling prophecy,</p>
<p>but at the same time, that&rsquo;s weighed off</p>
<p>with at least making people aware of the problem</p>
<p>and gets them thinking.</p>
<p>And I think particularly,</p>
<p>the reason why I wanna talk about this to your audience</p>
<p>is that on average, they&rsquo;re the type of people</p>
<p>who gravitate towards these kinds of topics</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re intellectually curious</p>
<p>and they can sort of sense that there&rsquo;s trouble brewing.</p>
<p>They can smell that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a reason</p>
<p>that people are thinking about this stuff a lot</p>
<p>is because the probability,</p>
<p>the probability, it&rsquo;s increased in probability</p>
<p>over certainly over the last few years,</p>
<p>trajectories have not gone favorably,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put it since 2010.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s right, I think, for people to be thinking about it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I think whether it&rsquo;s a useful fiction</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s actually true</p>
<p>or whatever you wanna call it,</p>
<p>I think having this faith,</p>
<p>this is where faith is valuable</p>
<p>because it gives you at least this like anchor of hope.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not just saying it to like trick myself,</p>
<p>like I do truly,</p>
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s something out there that wants us to win.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something that really wants us to win.</p>
<p>And it just, you just have to be like,</p>
<p>just like kind of, okay, now I sound really crazy,</p>
<p>but like open your heart to it a little bit</p>
<p>and it will give you the like,</p>
<p>the sort of breathing room</p>
<p>with which to marinate on the solutions.</p>
<p>We are the ones who have to come up with the solutions,</p>
<p>but we can use that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s hashtag positivity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s value in that.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to kind of imagine</p>
<p>all the destructive trajectories that lay in our future</p>
<p>and then believe in the possibility</p>
<p>of avoiding those trajectories.</p>
<p>All while, you said audience,</p>
<p>all while sitting back, which is majority,</p>
<p>the two people that listen to this</p>
<p>are probably sitting on a beach,</p>
<p>smoking some weed, just, that&rsquo;s a beautiful sunset.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking at just the waves going in and out.</p>
<p>And ultimately there&rsquo;s a kind of deep belief there</p>
<p>in the momentum of humanity to figure it all out.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve got a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>Which is what makes this whole simulation,</p>
<p>this video game kind of fun.</p>
<p>This battle of polytopia,</p>
<p>I still, man, I love those games so much.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>And that one for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Battle of Polytopia is a big,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a, is this really radical simplification</p>
<p>of a civilization type of game.</p>
<p>It still has a lot of the skill tree development,</p>
<p>a lot of the strategy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s easy enough to play on a phone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve really figured it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most elegantly designed games</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly complex.</p>
<p>And yet being, again, it walks that line</p>
<p>between complexity and simplicity</p>
<p>in this really, really great way.</p>
<p>And they use pretty colors</p>
<p>that hack the dopamine reward circuits in our brains.</p>
<p>Very well.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Video games are so fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Most of this life is just about fun.</p>
<p>Escaping all the suffering to find the fun.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s energy healing?</p>
<p>I have in my notes, energy healing question mark.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>God, your audience is gonna think I&rsquo;m mad.</p>
<p>So the two crazy things that happened to me,</p>
<p>the one was the voice in the head</p>
<p>that said you&rsquo;re gonna win this tournament</p>
<p>and then I won the tournament.</p>
<p>The other craziest thing that&rsquo;s happened to me</p>
<p>was in 2018,</p>
<p>I started getting this like weird problem in my ear</p>
<p>where it was kind of like low frequency sound distortion,</p>
<p>where voices, particularly men&rsquo;s voices,</p>
<p>became incredibly unpleasant to listen to.</p>
<p>It would like create this,</p>
<p>it would like be falsely amplified or something</p>
<p>and it was almost like a physical sensation in my ear,</p>
<p>which was really unpleasant.</p>
<p>And it would like last for a few hours and then go away</p>
<p>and then come back for a few hours and go away.</p>
<p>And I went and got hearing tests</p>
<p>and they found that like the bottom end,</p>
<p>I was losing the hearing in that ear.</p>
<p>And in the end, I got,</p>
<p>doctors said they think it was this thing</p>
<p>called Meniere&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>which is this very unpleasant disease</p>
<p>where people basically end up losing their hearing,</p>
<p>but they get this like,</p>
<p>it often comes with like dizzy spells and other things</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like the inner ear gets all messed up.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s actually what I had,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what at least a couple of,</p>
<p>one doctor said to me.</p>
<p>But anyway, so I&rsquo;d had three months of this stuff,</p>
<p>this going on and it was really getting me down.</p>
<p>And I was at Burning Man of all places.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be that person talking about Burning Man,</p>
<p>but I was there.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;d had it and I was unable to listen to music,</p>
<p>which is not what you want</p>
<p>because Burning Man is a very loud, intense place.</p>
<p>And I was just having a really rough time.</p>
<p>And on the final night,</p>
<p>I get talking to this girl who&rsquo;s like a friend of a friend.</p>
<p>And I mentioned, I was like,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m really down in the dumps about this.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, oh, well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a little bit of energy healing.</p>
<p>Would you like me to have a look?</p>
<p>And I was like, sure.</p>
<p>Now this was again,</p>
<p>deep, I was, you know, no time in my life for this.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t believe in any of this stuff.</p>
<p>I was just like, it&rsquo;s all bullshit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all wooey nonsense.</p>
<p>But I was like, sure, I&rsquo;ll have a go.</p>
<p>And she starts like with her hand and she says,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>And then she leans in and she starts like sucking</p>
<p>over my ear, not actually touching me,</p>
<p>but like close to it, like with her mouth.</p>
<p>And it was really unpleasant.</p>
<p>I was like, whoa, can you stop?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, no, no, no, there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>I need to get it.</p>
<p>And I was like, no, no, no, I really don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Please, this is really loud.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, I need to just bear with me.</p>
<p>And she does it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how long, for a few minutes.</p>
<p>And then she eventually collapses on the ground,</p>
<p>like freezing cold, crying.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, I don&rsquo;t know what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m like thoroughly freaked out</p>
<p>as is everyone else watching.</p>
<p>Just like, what the hell?</p>
<p>And we like warm her up and she was like,</p>
<p>oh, what, oh, you know, she was really shaken up.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know what that,</p>
<p>she said it was something very unpleasant and dark.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll be fine in a couple,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have the physical symptoms for a couple of weeks</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>But, you know, she was just like that, you know,</p>
<p>so I was so rattled, A, because the potential that actually</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d had something bad in me that made someone feel bad</p>
<p>and that she was scared.</p>
<p>That was what, you know, I was like, wait,</p>
<p>I thought you do this, this is the thing.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re terrified.</p>
<p>Like you bought like some kind of exorcism or something.</p>
<p>Like what the fuck is going on?</p>
<p>So it, like just the most insane experience.</p>
<p>And frankly, it took me like a few months</p>
<p>to sort of emotionally recover from it.</p>
<p>But my ear problem went away about a couple of weeks later</p>
<p>and touch wood, I&rsquo;ve not had any issues since.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>That gives you like hints</p>
<p>that maybe there&rsquo;s something out there.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t, again,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an explanation for this.</p>
<p>The most probable explanation was, you know,</p>
<p>I was a burning man, I was in a very open state.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just leave it at that.</p>
<p>And, you know, placebo is an incredibly powerful thing</p>
<p>and a very not understood thing.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Almost assigning the word placebo to it reduces it down</p>
<p>to a way that it doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be reduced down.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a whole science of what we call placebo.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a, placebo&rsquo;s a door.</p>
<p>Self healing, you know?</p>
<p>And I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what the problem was.</p>
<p>Like I was told it was many years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say I definitely had that</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want people to think that,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s how, you know, if they do have that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a terrible disease.</p>
<p>And if they have that,</p>
<p>that this is going to be a guaranteed way for it</p>
<p>to fix it for them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I also don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re absolutely right to say,</p>
<p>like using even the word placebo is like,</p>
<p>it comes with this like baggage of, of like frame.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to reduce it down.</p>
<p>All I can do is describe the experience and what happened.</p>
<p>I cannot put an ontological framework around it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say why it happened, what the mechanism was,</p>
<p>what the problem even was in the first place.</p>
<p>I just know that something crazy happened</p>
<p>and it was while I was in an open state.</p>
<p>And fortunately for me, it made the problem go away.</p>
<p>But what I took away from it, again,</p>
<p>it was part of this, you know,</p>
<p>this took me on this journey of becoming more humble</p>
<p>about what I think I know.</p>
<p>Because as I said before, I was like,</p>
<p>I was in the like Richard Dawkins train of atheism</p>
<p>in terms of there is no God.</p>
<p>And everything like that is bullshit.</p>
<p>We know everything, we know, you know,</p>
<p>the only way we can get through,</p>
<p>we know how medicine works and its molecules</p>
<p>and chemical interactions and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s like, okay, well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s clearly more for us to understand.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s ascientific as well,</p>
<p>because, you know, the beauty of the scientific method</p>
<p>is that it still can apply to this situation.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t see why, you know,</p>
<p>I would like to try and test this experimentally.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really, like, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we would go about doing that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d have to find other people with the same condition,</p>
<p>I guess, and like, try and repeat the experiment.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t, just because something happens</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of out of the realms</p>
<p>of our current understanding,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the scientific method can&rsquo;t be used for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the scientific method sits on a foundation</p>
<p>of those kinds of experiences,</p>
<p>because the scientific method is a process</p>
<p>to carve away at the mystery all around us.</p>
<p>And experiences like this is just a reminder</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re mostly shrouded in mystery still.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a humility.</p>
<p>Like, we haven&rsquo;t really figured this whole thing out.</p>
<p>But at the same time, we have found ways</p>
<p>to act, you know, we&rsquo;re clearly doing something right,</p>
<p>because think of the technological scientific advancements,</p>
<p>the knowledge that we have that would blow people&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>even from 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we&rsquo;ve even allegedly got out to space</p>
<p>and landed on the moon, although I still haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I have not seen evidence of the Earth being round,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m keeping an open mind.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you studied physics</p>
<p>and astrophysics, just to go to that,</p>
<p>just to jump around through the fascinating life you&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>when did you, how did that come to be?</p>
<p>Like, when did you fall in love with astronomy</p>
<p>and space and things like this?</p>
<p>As early as I can remember.</p>
<p>I was very lucky that my mom, and my dad,</p>
<p>but particularly my mom, my mom is like the most nature,</p>
<p>she is Mother Earth, is the only way to describe her.</p>
<p>Just, she&rsquo;s like Dr. Doolittle, animals flock to her</p>
<p>and just like sit and look at her adoringly.</p>
<p>As she sings.</p>
<p>Yeah, she just is Mother Earth,</p>
<p>and she has always been fascinated by,</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t have any, she never went to university</p>
<p>or anything like that, she&rsquo;s actually phobic of maths,</p>
<p>if I try and get her to like,</p>
<p>you know, I was trying to teach her poker and she hated it.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s so deeply curious,</p>
<p>and that just got instilled in me when, you know,</p>
<p>we would sleep out under the stars,</p>
<p>whenever it was, you know, the two nights a year</p>
<p>when it was warm enough in the UK to do that.</p>
<p>And we would just lie out there until we fell asleep,</p>
<p>looking at, looking for satellites,</p>
<p>looking for shooting stars, and I was just always,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it was from that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always naturally gravitated to like the biggest,</p>
<p>the biggest questions.</p>
<p>And also the like, the most layers of abstraction I love,</p>
<p>just like, what&rsquo;s the meta question?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meta question and so on.</p>
<p>So I think it just came from that really.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, like physics,</p>
<p>you know, it also made logical sense</p>
<p>in that it was a degree that,</p>
<p>well, a subject that ticks the box of being,</p>
<p>you know, answering these really big picture questions,</p>
<p>but it was also extremely useful.</p>
<p>It like has a very high utility in terms of,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know necessarily,</p>
<p>I thought I was gonna become like a research scientist.</p>
<p>My original plan was,</p>
<p>I wanna be a professional astronomer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just like a philosophy degree</p>
<p>that asks the big questions,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not like biology and the path</p>
<p>to go to medical school or something like that,</p>
<p>which is all overly pragmatic, not overly,</p>
<p>is very pragmatic, but this is, yeah,</p>
<p>physics is a good combination of the two.</p>
<p>Yeah, at least for me, it made sense.</p>
<p>And I was good at it, I liked it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t like I did an immense amount</p>
<p>of soul searching to choose it or anything.</p>
<p>It just was like this, it made the most sense.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to make this decision in the UK age 17,</p>
<p>which is crazy, because, you know, in US,</p>
<p>you go the first year, you do a bunch of stuff, right?</p>
<p>And then you choose your major.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the first few years of college,</p>
<p>you focus on the drugs and only as you get closer</p>
<p>to the end, do you start to think, oh shit,</p>
<p>this wasn&rsquo;t about that.</p>
<p>And I owe the government a lot of money.</p>
<p>How many alien civilizations are out there?</p>
<p>When you looked up at the stars with your mom</p>
<p>and you were counting them, what&rsquo;s your mom think</p>
<p>about the number of alien civilizations?</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I would imagine she would take the viewpoint of,</p>
<p>you know, she&rsquo;s pretty humble and she knows how many,</p>
<p>she knows there&rsquo;s a huge number of potential spawn sites</p>
<p>out there, so she would.</p>
<p>Spawn sites?</p>
<p>Spawn sites, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, this is all spawn sites.</p>
<p>Yeah, spawn sites in Polytopia.</p>
<p>We spawned on Earth, you know, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Hmm, yeah, spawn sites.</p>
<p>Why does that feel weird to say spawn?</p>
<p>Because it makes me feel like there&rsquo;s only one source</p>
<p>of life and it&rsquo;s spawning in different locations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the word spawn.</p>
<p>Because it feels like life that originated on Earth</p>
<p>really originated here.</p>
<p>Right, it is unique to this particular.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, but I don&rsquo;t, in my mind, it doesn&rsquo;t exclude,</p>
<p>you know, the completely different forms of life</p>
<p>and different biochemical soups can&rsquo;t also spawn,</p>
<p>but I guess it implies that there&rsquo;s some spark</p>
<p>that is uniform, which I kind of like the idea of.</p>
<p>And then I get to think about respawning,</p>
<p>like after it dies, like what happens if life on Earth ends?</p>
<p>Is it gonna restart again?</p>
<p>Probably not, it depends.</p>
<p>Maybe Earth is too.</p>
<p>It depends on the type of, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the thing that kills it off, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a paperclip maximizer, not for the example,</p>
<p>but, you know, some kind of very self replicating,</p>
<p>high on the capabilities, very low on the wisdom type thing.</p>
<p>So whether that&rsquo;s, you know, gray goo, green goo,</p>
<p>you know, like nanobots or just a shitty misaligned AI</p>
<p>that thinks it needs to turn everything into paperclips.</p>
<p>You know, if it&rsquo;s something like that,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s gonna be very hard for life,</p>
<p>you know, complex life, because by definition,</p>
<p>you know, a paperclip maximizer</p>
<p>is the ultimate instantiation of molecule.</p>
<p>Deeply low complexity, over optimization on a single thing,</p>
<p>sacrificing everything else, turning the whole world into.</p>
<p>Although something tells me,</p>
<p>like if we actually take a paperclip maximizer,</p>
<p>it destroys everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really dumb system that just envelops</p>
<p>the whole of Earth.</p>
<p>And the universe beyond, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know that part, but okay, great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thought experiment.</p>
<p>So it becomes a multi planetary paperclip maximizer?</p>
<p>Well, it just propagates.</p>
<p>I mean, it depends whether it figures out</p>
<p>how to jump the vacuum gap.</p>
<p>But again, I mean, this is all silly</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a hypothetical thought experiment,</p>
<p>which I think doesn&rsquo;t actually have</p>
<p>much practical application to the AI safety problem,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just a fun thing to play around with.</p>
<p>But if by definition, it is maximally intelligent,</p>
<p>which means it is maximally good at</p>
<p>navigating the environment around it</p>
<p>in order to achieve its goal,</p>
<p>but extremely bad at choosing goals in the first place.</p>
<p>So again, we&rsquo;re talking on this orthogonality thing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very low on wisdom, but very high on capability.</p>
<p>Then it will figure out how to jump the vacuum gap</p>
<p>between planets and stars and so on,</p>
<p>and thus just turn every atom it gets its hands on</p>
<p>into paperclips.</p>
<p>Yeah, by the way, for people who don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Which is maximum virality, by the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what virality is.</p>
<p>But does not mean that virality is necessarily</p>
<p>all about maximizing paperclips.</p>
<p>In that case, it is.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>this is just a thought experiment example</p>
<p>of an AI system that&rsquo;s very, that has a goal</p>
<p>and is willing to do anything to accomplish that goal,</p>
<p>including destroying all life on Earth</p>
<p>and all human life and all of consciousness in the universe</p>
<p>for the goal of producing a maximum number of paperclips.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Or whatever its optimization function was</p>
<p>that it was set at.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>It could be making, recreating Lexus.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll tile the universe in Lex.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>I like this idea.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more interesting than paperclips.</p>
<p>That could be infinitely optimal</p>
<p>if I were to say it to myself.</p>
<p>But if you ask me, it&rsquo;s still a bad thing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s permanently capping</p>
<p>what the universe could ever be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s its end state.</p>
<p>Or achieving the optimal</p>
<p>that the universe could ever achieve.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s up to,</p>
<p>different people have different perspectives.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think within the paperclip world</p>
<p>that would emerge, just like in the zeros and ones</p>
<p>that make up a computer,</p>
<p>that would emerge beautiful complexities?</p>
<p>Like, it won&rsquo;t suppress, you know,</p>
<p>as you scale to multiple planets and throughout,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll emerge these little worlds</p>
<p>that on top of the fabric of maximizing paperclips,</p>
<p>there will be, that would emerge like little societies</p>
<p>of paperclip.</p>
<p>Well, then we&rsquo;re not describing</p>
<p>a paperclip maximizer anymore.</p>
<p>Because by the, like, if you think of what a paperclip is,</p>
<p>it is literally just a piece of bent iron, right?</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s maximizing that throughout the universe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s taking every atom it gets its hand on</p>
<p>into somehow turning it into iron or steel.</p>
<p>And then bending it into that shape</p>
<p>and then done and done.</p>
<p>By definition, like paperclips,</p>
<p>there is no way for, well, okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that paperclips somehow</p>
<p>will just emerge and create through gravity or something.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a dynamic element to the whole system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, it&rsquo;s creating those paperclips</p>
<p>and the act of creating, there&rsquo;s going to be a process.</p>
<p>And that process will have a dance to it.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not like sequential thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole complex three dimensional system</p>
<p>of paperclips, you know, like, you know,</p>
<p>people like string theory, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be strings that are interacting</p>
<p>in fascinating ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure paperclips are very string like,</p>
<p>they can be interacting in very interesting ways</p>
<p>as you scale exponentially through three dimensional.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure the paperclip maximizer</p>
<p>has to come up with a theory of everything.</p>
<p>It has to create like wormholes, right?</p>
<p>It has to break, like,</p>
<p>it has to understand quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>It has to understand general relativity.</p>
<p>I love your optimism.</p>
<p>This is where I&rsquo;d say this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going into the realm of pathological optimism</p>
<p>where if I, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be a,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an intelligence</p>
<p>that emerges from that system.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that basically intelligence</p>
<p>is inherent in the fabric of reality and will find a way.</p>
<p>Kind of like Goldblum says, life will find a way.</p>
<p>You think life will find a way</p>
<p>even out of this perfectly homogenous dead soup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfectly homogenous.</p>
<p>It has to, it&rsquo;s perfectly maximal in the production.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why people keep thinking it&rsquo;s homogenous.</p>
<p>It maximizes the number of paperclips.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not trying to be homogenous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to maximize paperclips.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying, you&rsquo;re saying that because it,</p>
<p>because, you know, kind of like in the Big Bang</p>
<p>or, you know, it seems like, you know, things,</p>
<p>there were clusters, there was more stuff here than there.</p>
<p>That was enough of the patternicity</p>
<p>that kickstarted the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the little weirdness that will make it beautiful.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Complexity emerges.</p>
<p>Interesting, okay.</p>
<p>Well, so how does that line up then</p>
<p>with the whole heat death of the universe, right?</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s another sort of instantiation of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everything becomes so far apart and so cold</p>
<p>and so perfectly mixed that it&rsquo;s like homogenous grayness.</p>
<p>Do you think that even out of that homogenous grayness</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no, you know, negative entropy,</p>
<p>that, you know, there&rsquo;s no free energy that we understand</p>
<p>even from that new stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, the paperclip maximizer</p>
<p>or any other intelligence systems</p>
<p>will figure out ways to travel to other universes</p>
<p>to create Big Bangs within those universes</p>
<p>or through black holes to create whole other worlds</p>
<p>to break the, what we consider are the limitations</p>
<p>of physics.</p>
<p>The paperclip maximizer will find a way if a way exists.</p>
<p>And we should be humbled to realize that we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, but because it just wants to make more paperclips.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna go into those universes</p>
<p>and turn them into paperclips.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we humans, not humans,</p>
<p>but complex system exists on top of that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not interfering with it.</p>
<p>This complexity emerges from the simple base state.</p>
<p>The simple base.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s, yeah, whether it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>plank lengths or paperclips as the base unit.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can think of like the universe</p>
<p>as a paperclip maximizer because it&rsquo;s doing some dumb stuff.</p>
<p>Like physics seems to be pretty dumb.</p>
<p>It has, like, I don&rsquo;t know if you can summarize it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the laws are fairly basic</p>
<p>and yet out of them amazing complexity emerges.</p>
<p>And its goals seem to be pretty basic and dumb.</p>
<p>If you can summarize its goals,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s a nice way maybe,</p>
<p>maybe laws of thermodynamics could be good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can assign goals to physics,</p>
<p>but if you formulate in the sense of goals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very similar to paperclip maximizing</p>
<p>in the dumbness of the goals.</p>
<p>But the pockets of complexity as it emerge</p>
<p>is where beauty emerges.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where life emerges.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where intelligence, that&rsquo;s where humans emerge.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re being very down</p>
<p>on this whole paperclip maximizer thing.</p>
<p>Now, the reason we hated it.</p>
<p>I think, yeah, because what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is that you think that the force of emergence itself</p>
<p>is another like unwritten, not unwritten,</p>
<p>but like another baked in law of reality.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trusting that emergence will find a way to,</p>
<p>even out of seemingly the most mollusky,</p>
<p>awful, plain outcome, emergence will still find a way.</p>
<p>I love that as a philosophy.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very nice.</p>
<p>I would wield it carefully</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s large error bars on that</p>
<p>and the certainty of that.</p>
<p>How about we build the paperclip maximizer and find out.</p>
<p>Classic, yeah.</p>
<p>Moloch is doing cartwheels, man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the thing is it will destroy humans in the process,</p>
<p>which is the reason we really don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>We seem to be really holding on</p>
<p>to this whole human civilization thing.</p>
<p>Would that make you sad if AI systems that are beautiful,</p>
<p>that are conscious, that are interesting</p>
<p>and complex and intelligent,</p>
<p>ultimately lead to the death of humans?</p>
<p>Would that make you sad?</p>
<p>If humans led to the death of humans?</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Like if they would supersede humans.</p>
<p>Oh, if some AI?</p>
<p>Yeah, AI would end humans.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the reason why I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>in some ways less emotionally concerned about AI risk</p>
<p>than say, bio risk.</p>
<p>Because at least with AI, there&rsquo;s a chance,</p>
<p>you know, if we&rsquo;re in this hypothetical</p>
<p>where it wipes out humans,</p>
<p>but it does it for some like higher purpose,</p>
<p>it needs our atoms and energy to do something.</p>
<p>At least now the universe is going on</p>
<p>to do something interesting,</p>
<p>whereas if it wipes everything, you know,</p>
<p>bio like just kills everything on earth and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no more, you know,</p>
<p>earth cannot spawn anything more meaningful</p>
<p>in the few hundred million years it has left,</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have much time left.</p>
<p>Then, yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So one of my favorite books I&rsquo;ve ever read is,</p>
<p>Novocene by James Lovelock, who sadly just died.</p>
<p>He wrote it when he was like 99.</p>
<p>He died aged 102, so it&rsquo;s a fairly new book.</p>
<p>And he sort of talks about that,</p>
<p>that he thinks it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>sort of building off this Gaia theory</p>
<p>where like earth is like living,</p>
<p>some form of intelligence itself,</p>
<p>and that this is the next like step, right?</p>
<p>Is this, whatever this new intelligence</p>
<p>that is maybe silicon based</p>
<p>as opposed to carbon based goes on to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really sort of, in some ways an optimistic,</p>
<p>but really fatalistic book.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if I fully subscribed to it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a beautiful piece to read anyway.</p>
<p>So am I sad by that idea?</p>
<p>I think so, yes.</p>
<p>And actually, yeah, this is the reason</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m sad by the idea,</p>
<p>because if something is truly brilliant</p>
<p>and wise and smart and truly super intelligent,</p>
<p>it should be able to figure out abundance.</p>
<p>So if it figures out abundance,</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t need to kill us off.</p>
<p>It should be able to find a way for us.</p>
<p>It should be, there&rsquo;s plenty, the universe is huge.</p>
<p>There should be plenty of space for it to go out</p>
<p>and do all the things it wants to do,</p>
<p>and like give us a little pocket</p>
<p>where we can continue doing our things</p>
<p>and we can continue to do things and so on.</p>
<p>And again, if it&rsquo;s so supremely wise,</p>
<p>it shouldn&rsquo;t even be worried</p>
<p>about the game theoretic considerations</p>
<p>that by leaving us alive,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll then go and create another like super intelligent agent</p>
<p>that it then has to compete against,</p>
<p>because it should be only wise and smart enough</p>
<p>to not have to concern itself with that.</p>
<p>Unless it deems humans to be kind of assholes.</p>
<p>Like the humans are a source of non</p>
<p>of a lose, lose kind of dynamics.</p>
<p>Well, yes and no, we&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>Moloch is, that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s important to separate.</p>
<p>But maybe humans are the source of Moloch.</p>
<p>No, I think, I mean, I think game theory</p>
<p>is the source of Moloch.</p>
<p>And, you know, because Moloch exists</p>
<p>in nonhuman systems as well.</p>
<p>It happens within like agents within a game</p>
<p>in terms of like, you know, it applies to agents,</p>
<p>but like it can apply to, you know,</p>
<p>a species that&rsquo;s on an island of animals,</p>
<p>you know, rats out competing,</p>
<p>the ones that like massively consume all the resources</p>
<p>are the ones that are gonna win out</p>
<p>over the more like chill, socialized ones.</p>
<p>And so, you know, creates this Malthusian trap,</p>
<p>like Moloch exists in little pockets in nature as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a strictly human thing.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s actually a result of consequences</p>
<p>of the invention of predator and prey dynamics.</p>
<p>Maybe it needs to, AI will have to kill off</p>
<p>every organism that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re talking about killing off competition.</p>
<p>Not competition, but just like the way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the weeds or whatever</p>
<p>in a beautiful flower garden.</p>
<p>Parasites.</p>
<p>The parasites, yeah, on the whole system.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it won&rsquo;t do that completely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll put them in a zoo like we do with parasites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll ring fence.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;ll be somebody doing a PhD</p>
<p>on like they&rsquo;ll prod humans with a stick</p>
<p>and see what they do.</p>
<p>But I mean, in terms of letting us run wild</p>
<p>outside of the, you know, a geographically</p>
<p>constrained region that might be,</p>
<p>that it might decide to against that.</p>
<p>No, I think there&rsquo;s obviously the capacity</p>
<p>for beauty and kindness and non Moloch behavior</p>
<p>amidst humans, so I&rsquo;m pretty sure AI will preserve us.</p>
<p>Let me, I don&rsquo;t know if you answered the aliens question.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You had a good conversation with Toby Orr.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>About various sides of the universe.</p>
<p>I think, did he say, now I&rsquo;m forgetting,</p>
<p>but I think he said it&rsquo;s a good chance we&rsquo;re alone.</p>
<p>So the classic, you know, Fermi paradox question is,</p>
<p>there are so many spawn points and yet, you know,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t take us that long to go from harnessing fire</p>
<p>to sending out radio signals into space.</p>
<p>So surely given the vastness of space we should be,</p>
<p>and you know, even if only a tiny fraction of those</p>
<p>create life and other civilizations too,</p>
<p>we should be, the universe should be very noisy.</p>
<p>There should be evidence of Dyson spheres or whatever,</p>
<p>you know, like at least radio signals and so on,</p>
<p>but seemingly things are very silent out there.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it depends on who you speak to.</p>
<p>Some people say that they&rsquo;re getting signals all the time</p>
<p>and so on and like, I don&rsquo;t wanna make</p>
<p>an epistemic statement on that,</p>
<p>but it seems like there&rsquo;s a lot of silence.</p>
<p>And so that raises this paradox.</p>
<p>And then say, you know, the Drake equation.</p>
<p>So the Drake equation is like basically just a simple thing</p>
<p>of like trying to estimate the number of possible</p>
<p>civilizations within the galaxy</p>
<p>by multiplying the number of stars created per year</p>
<p>by the number of stars that have planets,</p>
<p>planets that are habitable, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>So all these like different factors.</p>
<p>And then you plug in numbers into that and you, you know,</p>
<p>depending on like the range of, you know,</p>
<p>your lower bound and your upper bound point estimates</p>
<p>that you put in, you get out a number at the end</p>
<p>for the number of civilizations.</p>
<p>But what Toby and his crew did differently was,</p>
<p>Toby is a researcher at the Future of Humanity Institute.</p>
<p>They, instead of, they realized that it&rsquo;s like basically</p>
<p>a statistical quirk that if you put in point sources,</p>
<p>even if you think you&rsquo;re putting in</p>
<p>conservative point sources,</p>
<p>because on some of these variables,</p>
<p>the uncertainty is so large,</p>
<p>it spans like maybe even like a couple of hundred</p>
<p>orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>By putting in point sources,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always going to lead to overestimates.</p>
<p>And so they, like by putting stuff on a log scale,</p>
<p>or actually they did it on like a log log scale</p>
<p>on some of them,</p>
<p>and then like ran the simulation across the whole</p>
<p>bucket of uncertainty,</p>
<p>across all of those orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>When you do that,</p>
<p>then actually the number comes out much, much smaller.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the more statistically rigorous,</p>
<p>you know, mathematically correct way</p>
<p>of doing the calculation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a lot of hand waving.</p>
<p>As science goes, it&rsquo;s like definitely, you know,</p>
<p>just waving, I don&rsquo;t know what an analogy is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hand wavy.</p>
<p>And anyway, when they did this,</p>
<p>and then they did a Bayesian update on it as well,</p>
<p>to like factor in the fact that there is no evidence</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re picking up because, you know,</p>
<p>no evidence is actually a form of evidence, right?</p>
<p>And the long and short of it comes out that the,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re roughly around 70% to be the only</p>
<p>intelligent civilization in our galaxy thus far,</p>
<p>and around 50, 50 in the entire observable universe,</p>
<p>which sounds so crazily counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but their math is legit.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, the math around this particular equation,</p>
<p>which the equation is ridiculous on many levels,</p>
<p>but the powerful thing about the equation</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s the different things,</p>
<p>different components that can be estimated,</p>
<p>and the error bars on which can be reduced with science.</p>
<p>And hence throughout, since the equation came out,</p>
<p>the error bars have been coming out on different,</p>
<p>different aspects.</p>
<p>And so that, it almost kind of says,</p>
<p>what, like this gives you a mission to reduce the error bars</p>
<p>on these estimates over a period of time.</p>
<p>And once you do, you can better and better understand,</p>
<p>like in the process of redoing the error bars,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get to understand actually</p>
<p>what is the right way to find out where the aliens are,</p>
<p>how many of them there are, and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good to use that for an estimation.</p>
<p>I think you do have to think from like,</p>
<p>more like from first principles,</p>
<p>just looking at what life is on Earth,</p>
<p>and trying to understand the very physics based,</p>
<p>biology, chemistry, biology based question of what is life,</p>
<p>maybe computation based.</p>
<p>What the fuck is this thing?</p>
<p>And that, like how difficult is it to create this thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one way to say like how many planets like this</p>
<p>are out there, all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but it feels like from our very limited knowledge</p>
<p>perspective, the right way is to think how does,</p>
<p>what is this thing and how does it originate?</p>
<p>From very simple nonlife things,</p>
<p>how does complex lifelike things emerge?</p>
<p>From a rock to a bacteria, protein,</p>
<p>and these like weird systems that encode information</p>
<p>and pass information from self replicate,</p>
<p>and then also select each other and mutate</p>
<p>in interesting ways such that they can adapt</p>
<p>and evolve and build increasingly more complex systems.</p>
<p>Right, well it&rsquo;s a form of information processing, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Whereas information transfer, but then also</p>
<p>an energy processing, which then results in,</p>
<p>I guess information processing,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m getting bogged down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing some modification and yeah,</p>
<p>the input is some energy.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s able to extract, yeah,</p>
<p>extract resources from its environment</p>
<p>in order to achieve a goal.</p>
<p>But the goal doesn&rsquo;t seem to be clear.</p>
<p>Right, well the goal is to make more of itself.</p>
<p>Yeah, but in a way that increases,</p>
<p>I mean I don&rsquo;t know if evolution</p>
<p>is a fundamental law of the universe,</p>
<p>but it seems to want to replicate itself</p>
<p>in a way that maximizes the chance of its survival.</p>
<p>Individual agents within an ecosystem do, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Evolution itself doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, it don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, oh, you optimize it.</p>
<p>Well, at least it&rsquo;s certainly, yeah,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t care about the welfare</p>
<p>of the individual agents within it,</p>
<p>but it does seem to, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think the mistake is that we&rsquo;re anthropomorphizing.</p>
<p>To even try and give evolution a mindset</p>
<p>because it is, there&rsquo;s a really great post</p>
<p>by Eliezer Yudkowsky on Lesrong,</p>
<p>which is an alien God.</p>
<p>And he talks about the mistake we make</p>
<p>when we try and put our mind,</p>
<p>think through things from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p>as though giving evolution some kind of agency</p>
<p>and what it wants.</p>
<p>Yeah, worth reading, but yeah.</p>
<p>I would like to say that having interacted</p>
<p>with a lot of really smart people</p>
<p>that say that anthropomorphization is a mistake,</p>
<p>I would like to say that saying</p>
<p>that anthropomorphization is a mistake is a mistake.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of power in anthropomorphization,</p>
<p>if I can only say that word correctly one time.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually a really powerful way</p>
<p>to reason to things.</p>
<p>And I think people, especially people in robotics</p>
<p>seem to run away from it as fast as possible.</p>
<p>And I just, I think.</p>
<p>Can you give an example of like how it helps in robotics?</p>
<p>Oh, in that our world is a world of humans</p>
<p>and to see robots as fundamentally just tools</p>
<p>runs away from the fact that we live in a world,</p>
<p>a dynamic world of humans.</p>
<p>That like these, all these game theory systems</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about, that a robot</p>
<p>that ever has to interact with humans.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean like intimate friendship interaction.</p>
<p>I mean, in a factory setting where it has to deal</p>
<p>with the uncertainty of humans, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You have to acknowledge that the robot&rsquo;s behavior</p>
<p>has an effect on the human, just as much as the human</p>
<p>has an effect on the robot.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a dance there.</p>
<p>And you have to realize that this entity,</p>
<p>when a human sees a robot, this is obvious</p>
<p>in a physical manifestation of a robot,</p>
<p>they feel a certain way.</p>
<p>They have a fear, they have uncertainty.</p>
<p>They have their own personal life projections.</p>
<p>We have to have pets and dogs</p>
<p>and the thing looks like a dog.</p>
<p>They have their own memories of what a dog is like.</p>
<p>They have certain feelings and that&rsquo;s gonna be useful</p>
<p>in a safety setting, safety critical setting,</p>
<p>which is one of the most trivial settings for a robot</p>
<p>in terms of how to avoid any kind of dangerous situations.</p>
<p>And a robot should really consider that</p>
<p>in navigating its environment.</p>
<p>And we humans are right to reason about how a robot</p>
<p>should consider navigating its environment</p>
<p>through anthropomorphization.</p>
<p>I also think our brains are designed to think</p>
<p>in human terms, like game theory,</p>
<p>I think is best applied in the space of human decisions.</p>
<p>And so&hellip;</p>
<p>Right, you&rsquo;re dealing, I mean, with things like AI,</p>
<p>AI is, they are, we can somewhat,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the reason I say anthropomorphization</p>
<p>we need to be careful with is because there is a danger</p>
<p>of overly applying, overly wrongly assuming</p>
<p>that this artificial intelligence is going to operate</p>
<p>in any similar way to us,</p>
<p>because it is operating</p>
<p>on a fundamentally different substrate.</p>
<p>Like even dogs or even mice or whatever, in some ways,</p>
<p>like anthropomorphizing them is less of a mistake, I think,</p>
<p>than an AI, even though it&rsquo;s an AI we built and so on,</p>
<p>because at least we know</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re running from the same substrate.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve also evolved from the same,</p>
<p>out of the same evolutionary process.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve followed this evolution</p>
<p>of like needing to compete for resources</p>
<p>and needing to find a mate and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Whereas an AI that has just popped into existence</p>
<p>somewhere on like a cloud server,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, you know, or whatever, however it runs</p>
<p>and whatever, whether it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether they have an internal experience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they necessarily do.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t think they do.</p>
<p>But the point is, is that to try and apply</p>
<p>any kind of modeling of like thinking through problems</p>
<p>and decisions in the same way that we do</p>
<p>has to be done extremely carefully because they are,</p>
<p>like, they&rsquo;re so alien,</p>
<p>their method of whatever their form of thinking is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so different because they&rsquo;ve never had to evolve,</p>
<p>you know, in the same way.</p>
<p>Yeah, beautifully put.</p>
<p>I was just playing devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>I do think in certain contexts,</p>
<p>anthropomorphization is not gonna hurt you.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Engineers run away from it too fast.</p>
<p>I can see that.</p>
<p>But from the most point, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people today,</p>
<p>like the 17 year old that you were,</p>
<p>of how to live life?</p>
<p>You can be proud of how to have a career</p>
<p>you can be proud of in this world full of mullocks.</p>
<p>Think about the win wins.</p>
<p>Look for win win situations.</p>
<p>And be careful not to, you know, overly use your smarts</p>
<p>to convince yourself that something is win win</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how to advise, you know, people on that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m still figuring out myself.</p>
<p>But have that as a sort of default MO.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t see things, everything as a zero sum game.</p>
<p>Try to find the positive sumness and like find ways</p>
<p>if there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be one,</p>
<p>consider playing a different game.</p>
<p>So that I would suggest that.</p>
<p>Do not become a professional poker player.</p>
<p>I, cause people always ask that like, oh, she&rsquo;s a pro.</p>
<p>I wanna do that too.</p>
<p>Fine, you could have done it if you were, you know,</p>
<p>when I started out,</p>
<p>it was a very different situation back then.</p>
<p>Poker is, you know, a great game to learn</p>
<p>in order to understand the ways to think.</p>
<p>And I recommend people learn it,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t try and make a living from it these days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost, it&rsquo;s very, very difficult</p>
<p>to the point of being impossible.</p>
<p>And then really, really be aware of how much time</p>
<p>you spend on your phone and on social media</p>
<p>and really try and keep it to a minimum.</p>
<p>Be aware that basically every moment that you spend on it</p>
<p>is bad for you.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t mean to say you can never do it,</p>
<p>but just have that running in the background.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a bad thing for myself right now.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the general rule of thumb.</p>
<p>Of course, about becoming a professional poker player,</p>
<p>if there is a thing in your life that&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>and nobody can convince you otherwise, just fucking do it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to anyone&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>Find a thing that you can&rsquo;t be talked out of too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a thing.</p>
<p>I like that, yeah.</p>
<p>You were a lead guitarist in a metal band?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Did I write that down from something?</p>
<p>What did you, what&rsquo;d you do it for?</p>
<p>The performing, was it the pure, the music of it?</p>
<p>Was it just being a rock star?</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you do it?</p>
<p>So we only ever played two gigs.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t last, you know, it wasn&rsquo;t a very,</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t famous or anything like that.</p>
<p>But I was very into metal.</p>
<p>Like it was my entire identity,</p>
<p>sort of from the age of 16 to 23.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best metal band of all time?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask me that, it&rsquo;s so hard to answer.</p>
<p>So I know I had a long argument with,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a guitarist, more like a classic rock guitarist.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;ve had friends who are very big</p>
<p>Pantera fans and so there was often arguments</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s the better metal band,</p>
<p>Metallica versus Pantera.</p>
<p>This is a more kind of 90s maybe discussion.</p>
<p>But I was always on the side of Metallica,</p>
<p>both musically and in terms of performance</p>
<p>and the depth of lyrics and so on.</p>
<p>So, but they were, basically everybody was against me.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re a true metal fan,</p>
<p>I guess the idea goes is you can&rsquo;t possibly</p>
<p>be a Metallica fan.</p>
<p>Because Metallica is pop, it&rsquo;s just like, they sold out.</p>
<p>Metallica are metal.</p>
<p>Like they were the, I mean, again, you can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>who was the godfather of metal, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>But like they were so groundbreaking and so brilliant.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve named literally two of my favorite bands.</p>
<p>Like when you asked that question, who are my favorites?</p>
<p>Like those were two that came up.</p>
<p>A third one is Children of Bodom,</p>
<p>who I just think, oh, they just tick all the boxes for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nowadays, like I kind of sort of feel</p>
<p>like a repulsion to the, I was that myself.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d be like, who do you prefer more?</p>
<p>Come on, who&rsquo;s like, no, you have to rank them.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like this false zero sumness that&rsquo;s like, why?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so additive.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no conflict there.</p>
<p>Although when people ask that kind of question</p>
<p>about anything, movies, I feel like it&rsquo;s hard work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unfair, but it&rsquo;s, you should pick one.</p>
<p>Like, and that&rsquo;s actually the same kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a fear of a commitment.</p>
<p>When people ask me, what&rsquo;s your favorite band?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, but I, it&rsquo;s good to pick.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And thank you for the tough question, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, maybe not in the context</p>
<p>when a lot of people are listening.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not just like, what, why does it matter?</p>
<p>No, it does.</p>
<p>Are you still into metal?</p>
<p>Funny enough, I was listening to a bunch</p>
<p>before I came over here.</p>
<p>Oh, like, do you use it for like motivation</p>
<p>or it gets you in a certain?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was weirdly listening</p>
<p>to 80s hair metal before I came.</p>
<p>Does that count as metal?</p>
<p>I think so, it&rsquo;s like proto metal and it&rsquo;s happy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s optimistic, happy proto metal.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, all these genres bleed into each other.</p>
<p>But yeah, sorry, to answer your question</p>
<p>about guitar playing, my relationship with it</p>
<p>was kind of weird in that I was deeply uncreative.</p>
<p>My objective would be to hear some really hard</p>
<p>technical solo and then learn it, memorize it</p>
<p>and then play it perfectly.</p>
<p>But I was incapable of trying to write my own music.</p>
<p>Like the idea was just absolutely terrifying.</p>
<p>But I was also just thinking, I was like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be kind of cool to actually try starting a band again</p>
<p>and getting back into it and write.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>I mean, I put out some guitar playing</p>
<p>just other people&rsquo;s covers.</p>
<p>I play Comfortly Numb on the internet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s scary too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary putting stuff out there.</p>
<p>And I had this similar kind of fascination</p>
<p>with technical playing, both on piano and guitar.</p>
<p>You know, one of the first,</p>
<p>one of the reasons that I started learning guitar</p>
<p>is from Ozzy Osbourne, Mr. Crowley&rsquo;s solo.</p>
<p>And one of the first solos I learned is that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a beauty to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of beauty to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tapping, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some tapping, but it&rsquo;s just really fast.</p>
<p>Beautiful, like arpeggios.</p>
<p>Yeah, arpeggios, yeah.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a melody that you can hear through it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also build up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful solo,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also technically just visually the way it looks</p>
<p>when a person&rsquo;s watching, you feel like a rockstar playing.</p>
<p>But it ultimately has to do with technical.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not developing the part of your brain</p>
<p>that I think requires you to generate beautiful music.</p>
<p>It is ultimately technical in nature.</p>
<p>And so that took me a long time to let go of that</p>
<p>and just be able to write music myself.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a different journey, I think.</p>
<p>I think that journey is a little bit more inspired</p>
<p>in the blues world, for example,</p>
<p>where improvisation is more valued,</p>
<p>obviously in jazz and so on.</p>
<p>But I think ultimately it&rsquo;s a more rewarding journey</p>
<p>because you get your relationship with the guitar</p>
<p>then becomes a kind of escape from the world</p>
<p>where you can create, I mean, creating stuff is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something you work with,</p>
<p>because my relationship with my guitar was like,</p>
<p>it was something to tame and defeat.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a challenge.</p>
<p>Which was kind of what my whole personality was back then.</p>
<p>I was just very like, as I said, very competitive,</p>
<p>very just like must bend this thing to my will.</p>
<p>Whereas writing music, it&rsquo;s like a dance, you work with it.</p>
<p>But I think because of the competitive aspect,</p>
<p>for me at least, that&rsquo;s still there,</p>
<p>which creates anxiety about playing publicly</p>
<p>or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just like a harsh self criticism</p>
<p>within the whole thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really tough.</p>
<p>I wanna hear some of your stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s certain things that feel really personal.</p>
<p>And on top of that, as we talked about poker offline,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain things that you get to a certain height</p>
<p>in your life, and that doesn&rsquo;t have to be very high,</p>
<p>but you get to a certain height</p>
<p>and then you put it aside for a bit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to return to it</p>
<p>because you remember being good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to, like you being at a very high level</p>
<p>in poker, it might be hard for you to return to poker</p>
<p>every once in a while and enjoy it,</p>
<p>knowing that you&rsquo;re just not as sharp as you used to be</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not doing it every single day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I always wonder with,</p>
<p>I mean, even just like in chess with Kasparov,</p>
<p>some of these greats, just returning to it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost painful.</p>
<p>And I feel that way with guitar too,</p>
<p>because I used to play every day a lot.</p>
<p>So returning to it is painful</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like accepting the fact</p>
<p>that this whole ride is finite</p>
<p>and that you have a prime,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a time when you were really good</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s over and now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on a different chapter of life.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, but I miss that.</p>
<p>But you can still discover joy within that process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been tough, especially with some level of like,</p>
<p>as people get to know you, and people film stuff,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the privacy of just sharing something</p>
<p>with a few people around you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful privacy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>With the internet, it&rsquo;s just disappearing.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a really good point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But all those pressures aside,</p>
<p>if you really, you can step up</p>
<p>and still enjoy the fuck out of a good musical performance.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in your name, as we talked about.</p>
<p>You have to live up.</p>
<p>Do you feel the requirement</p>
<p>to have to live up to your name?</p>
<p>Because live?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, because I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>I mean, my, oh, again, it&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Because my full name is Olivia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I can retreat in that and be like,</p>
<p>oh, Olivia, what does that even mean?</p>
<p>Live up to live.</p>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t say I do,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve never thought of it that way.</p>
<p>And then your name backwards is evil.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we also talked about.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel the urge to live up to that,</p>
<p>to be the inverse of evil or even better.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t think, you know,</p>
<p>is the inverse of evil good</p>
<p>or is good something completely separate to that?</p>
<p>I think my intuition says it&rsquo;s the latter,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Anyway, again, getting in the weeds.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of all this?</p>
<p>Of life.</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>I think to,</p>
<p>explore, have fun and understand</p>
<p>and make more of here and to keep the game going.</p>
<p>Of here?</p>
<p>More of here?</p>
<p>More of this, whatever this is.</p>
<p>More of experience.</p>
<p>Just to have more of experience</p>
<p>and ideally positive experience.</p>
<p>And more complex, you know,</p>
<p>I guess, try and put it into a sort of</p>
<p>vaguely scientific term.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But make it so that the program required,</p>
<p>the length of code required to describe the universe</p>
<p>is as long as possible.</p>
<p>And, you know, highly complex and therefore interesting.</p>
<p>Because again, like,</p>
<p>I know, you know, we bang the metaphor to death,</p>
<p>but like, tiled with X, you know,</p>
<p>tiled with paperclips,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t require that much of a code to describe.</p>
<p>Obviously, maybe something emerges from it,</p>
<p>but that steady state, assuming a steady state,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not very interesting.</p>
<p>Whereas it seems like our universe is over time</p>
<p>becoming more and more complex and interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much richness and beauty and diversity</p>
<p>on this earth.</p>
<p>And I want that to continue and get more.</p>
<p>I want more diversity.</p>
<p>And the very best sense of that word</p>
<p>is to me the goal of all this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And somehow have fun in the process.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because we do create a lot of fun things along,</p>
<p>instead of in this creative force</p>
<p>and all the beautiful things we create,</p>
<p>somehow there&rsquo;s like a funness to it.</p>
<p>And perhaps that has to do with the finiteness of life,</p>
<p>the finiteness of all these experiences,</p>
<p>which is what makes them kind of unique.</p>
<p>Like the fact that they end,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this, whatever it is,</p>
<p>falling in love or creating a piece of art</p>
<p>or creating a bridge or creating a rocket</p>
<p>or creating a, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>just the businesses that build something</p>
<p>or solve something.</p>
<p>The fact that it is born and it dies</p>
<p>somehow embeds it with fun, with joy</p>
<p>for the people involved.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>The finiteness of it.</p>
<p>It can do.</p>
<p>Some people struggle with the,</p>
<p>I mean, a big thing I think that one has to learn</p>
<p>is being okay with things coming to an end.</p>
<p>And in terms of like projects and so on,</p>
<p>people cling onto things beyond</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re meant to be doing,</p>
<p>beyond what is reasonable.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna have to come to terms</p>
<p>with this podcast coming to an end.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed talking to you.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s obvious as we&rsquo;ve talked about many times,</p>
<p>you should be doing a podcast.</p>
<p>You should, you&rsquo;re already doing a lot of stuff publicly</p>
<p>to the world, which is awesome.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re a great educator.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a great mind.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a great intellect.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also this whole medium of just talking</p>
<p>is also fun.</p>
<p>It is good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun one.</p>
<p>It really is good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s nothing but like,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s just so much fun.</p>
<p>And you can just get into so many,</p>
<p>yeah, there&rsquo;s this space to just explore</p>
<p>and see what comes and emerges.</p>
<p>And yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, to understand yourself better.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re talking to others,</p>
<p>to understand them better and together with them.</p>
<p>I mean, you should do your own podcast,</p>
<p>but you should also do a podcast with C</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>The two of you have such different minds</p>
<p>that like melt together in just hilarious ways,</p>
<p>fascinating ways, just the tension of ideas there</p>
<p>is really powerful.</p>
<p>But in general, I think you got a beautiful voice.</p>
<p>So thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a friend.</p>
<p>Thank you for honoring me with this conversation</p>
<p>and with your valuable time.</p>
<p>Thanks, Liv.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Liv Marie.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s much more interesting to live not knowing</p>
<p>than to have answers, which might be wrong.</p>
<p>I have approximate answers and possible beliefs</p>
<p>and different degrees of uncertainty about different things,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not absolutely sure of anything.</p>
<p>And there are many things I don&rsquo;t know anything about,</p>
<p>such as whether it means anything to ask why we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to know the answer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel frightened not knowing things</p>
<p>by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose,</p>
<p>which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
