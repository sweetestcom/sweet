<p>out and out stay away from it was like the</p>
<p>video games the</p>
<p>grand theft</p>
<p>auto i got so addicted to it like my life was</p>
<p>i was literally</p>
<p>dreaming and</p>
<p>thinking and</p>
<p>grant and my mindset</p>
<p>would be like oh</p>

<p>and then we&rsquo;ll get to the gig</p>
<p>quicker like i&rsquo;m like it like a real life yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my subconscious</p>
<p>mind but luckily my conscious minds like no you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ain&rsquo;t that rewires kids makes me</p>
<p>i agree with him i used to play this game</p>
<p>where you jumped from</p>
<p>building to</p>
<p>building i forget</p>
<p>which game it was</p>
<p>city of heroes</p>
<p>and after i played it for like a</p>
<p>month straight</p>
<p>like 10 hours a day</p>
<p>i would go outside and forget i can&rsquo;t jump on top of</p>
<p>buildings like i was just driving</p>
<p>going i could jump on that</p>
<p>building and that</p>
<p>building i&rsquo;m like what am i</p>
<p>thinking i&rsquo;m just like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very darwinian if you&rsquo;re a kid now if you&rsquo;re a kid you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t laid down</p>
<p>those at least</p>
<p>those deep rooted</p>
<p>thoughts will tell you that you know you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do that that little</p>
<p>voice that says no don&rsquo;t kill</p>
<p>him yeah you know it&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t have physical</p>
<p>limitations the law</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t hold you accountable</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eight years old for murder something like that so think</p>
<p>about that if you&rsquo;re playing those</p>
<p>video games in your four or five</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s god that&rsquo;s all you know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you just pull the trigger</p>

<p>you see them around little boys you realize how fucking</p>
<p>crazy boys are from the get go like</p>
<p>there are a lot of</p>
<p>things that are fucked up</p>
<p>about human beings because of our culture</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of shit that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>in there man when you see like little boys and this</p>
<p>little boy there was two little two year old babies</p>
<p>in this big</p>
<p>inflatable play thing</p>
<p>and one like</p>
<p>seven eight year old boy</p>
<p>okay and a seven</p>
<p>eight year old boy</p>
<p>was fucking</p>
<p>throwing himself through the air</p>
<p>and crashing into the walls this</p>
<p>thing with no regard to</p>
<p>these babies that were around them</p>
<p>it was such a trip to</p>
<p>watch and i was</p>
<p>watching them like dude you</p>
<p>gotta settle down you</p>
<p>gotta settle down</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>at them like he can&rsquo;t even help himself this kid is</p>
<p>wired up with his fucking chimpanzee</p>
<p>dna i mean he&rsquo;s like six man and he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>throwing himself into the cage of this</p>
<p>thing yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just they are they&rsquo;re ingrained that way they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>crazy he&rsquo;s gotta get that shit out it&rsquo;s inside</p>
<p>of them if you take a kid like that and don&rsquo;t exercise</p>
<p>that should be a crime</p>
<p>it should be a</p>
<p>crime to have a little male monster</p>
<p>and not work it out</p>
<p>yeah you got him you</p>
<p>gotta get him an</p>
<p>x yeah treat</p>
<p>him just like a dog get my ball and make him go</p>
<p>chase it dude when i first</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>wrestling in high school i</p>
<p>first started</p>
<p>really working out</p>
<p>i really like because</p>
<p>i did martial arts before that but</p>
<p>quite honestly the karate</p>
<p>class that i did before wrestling</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t good</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t hard enough to really</p>
<p>break you right but</p>
<p>wrestling practice</p>
<p>would break</p>
<p>yeah break make</p>
<p>you question yourself</p>
<p>and but you get out of there though</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>peaceful oh yeah like there&rsquo;s nothing left yeah</p>
<p>absolutely you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t need to get</p>
<p>upset about</p>
<p>some asshole</p>
<p>who cuts in</p>
<p>front of you the red</p>
<p>light it&rsquo;s all like whatever</p>
<p>i would see</p>
<p>those guys in high</p>
<p>school i played football and it was the</p>
<p>thing is it was only hard for two weeks hell week</p>
<p>the beginning of summer</p>
<p>especially in arizona it&rsquo;s hot as hell</p>
<p>but the higher you went up in</p>
<p>varsity it was so easy because</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want anybody getting hurt nobody was</p>
<p>going in freshman football you</p>
<p>had to hit the biggest gut they didn&rsquo;t care they just</p>
<p>sized anybody</p>
<p>against anybody</p>
<p>but it would</p>
<p>watch the wrestlers go</p>
<p>back to the locker room</p>
<p>after we went back to the locker</p>
<p>room i was like</p>
<p>those guys just i mean</p>
<p>they would just lay there they</p>
<p>would be drenched</p>
<p>brutal but you</p>
<p>never saw them on campus</p>
<p>doing the meathead crap that we were doing the football</p>
<p>players they were exhausted they were exhausted</p>
<p>and they knew</p>
<p>humbled too and they knew that</p>
<p>they could end this situation a lot</p>
<p>quicker than we</p>
<p>could you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the get it out of their</p>
<p>system yeah</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>competing with men and you&rsquo;re always like</p>
<p>throwing yourself</p>
<p>in there you don&rsquo;t want to do it anymore</p>
<p>absolutely and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re doing it in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the safest</p>
<p>way to do it and deal with your biology</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing is you&rsquo;re doing it in a controlled environment</p>
<p>with a bunch of</p>
<p>other people who</p>
<p>agree to it and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>honorable and</p>
<p>you do it like</p>
<p>you tap each</p>
<p>other around and there&rsquo;s not even any hard feelings</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re like when you do jiu jitsu</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no hard feelings when guys get caught you know</p>
<p>somebody taps</p>
<p>you out you go that&rsquo;s what happens you get caught</p>
<p>what did i do</p>
<p>wrong did i put my arm through</p>
<p>oh i fucked up i forgot to put the arm here i</p>
<p>thank you thank you</p>
<p>then you go back</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>but you get all this ingrained</p>
<p>male dominator shit out of your</p>
<p>system we&rsquo;re not supposed to live all like</p>
<p>hanging out like this oh yeah yeah with</p>
<p>chimps you know like uh</p>
<p>you know chimps don&rsquo;t like hang out that much</p>
<p>they get together</p>
<p>with other chimps like if they go meet</p>
<p>other chimps like they have like little tribes</p>
<p>if they go meet</p>
<p>other chimps they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>fighting for</p>
<p>short to the death</p>
<p>sometimes they</p>
<p>creep over and they don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>these chimps</p>
<p>they just jack them</p>
<p>they just decide who&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>their team and that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve got to deal with</p>
<p>so many people all day long you can&rsquo;t just jack people</p>
<p>but those signals are</p>
<p>still present in</p>
<p>ghostly form in your brain and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m a dick on youtube videos</p>
<p>in what way</p>
<p>what do you mean i&rsquo;m just kidding i&rsquo;m not a dick no no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like message</p>

<p>try to find a strange one and i do it</p>
<p>like iced tea man don&rsquo;t nobody do iced tea</p>

<p>would brush up on the</p>
<p>impression as if i could fool</p>
<p>kenny tenny</p>
<p>i felt like it was golden</p>
<p>yeah how do you do work</p>
<p>impressions</p>
<p>do you practice them at home and then eventually</p>
<p>bring them to the</p>
<p>stage or do you know when you hear somebody whether</p>
<p>or not you can do it</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>if you hear them</p>
<p>right away i know i can do it if somebody</p>
<p>tends to have a deeper</p>
<p>voice or something like that or there&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>thing about them</p>
<p>i know i can do it</p>
<p>i always more so than the way it</p>
<p>sounds it&rsquo;s the way somebody looks when they talk</p>
<p>because people move their</p>
<p>mouth a certain way that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>reveal half the</p>
<p>impression i</p>
<p>noticed you did that with the</p>
<p>obama thing</p>
<p>that obama thing i</p>
<p>watched it online</p>
<p>where they took</p>
<p>some footage from like the 70s it looks like</p>
<p>it inserted your clips into</p>
<p>it that was</p>
<p>great stuff man</p>
<p>you really do a good</p>
<p>obama it was</p>
<p>that was a show in</p>
<p>super deluxe a</p>
<p>internet series i had but the</p>
<p>whole thing was</p>
<p>i would take facts and</p>
<p>skew them a little i i love time</p>
<p>traveling it&rsquo;s my biggest obsession so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why yeah i&rsquo;m obsessed with it i&rsquo;m working on</p>
<p>show right now about time</p>
<p>travel that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>you talking to the</p>
<p>right guy so i&rsquo;m talking tacky on particles the</p>
<p>whole thing i&rsquo;m into it man you know</p>
<p>who ronald mallet is do you know the whole</p>
<p>story no no no is it</p>
<p>how the fuck you don&rsquo;t travel</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know ronald</p>
<p>is i love time travel</p>
<p>dude ronald mallett is the</p>
<p>premier expert in america on time</p>
<p>travel and this is the</p>
<p>crazy part about him we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about him on the show before but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>bring it up again</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s such a fascinating</p>
<p>story the dude&rsquo;s like a fucking spider man comic book</p>
<p>his dad died when he was a</p>
<p>child so he became obsessed he</p>
<p>loved his dad</p>
<p>i did read about him i know exactly he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a black guy or</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a black guy</p>
<p>okay yeah sure</p>
<p>and he developed isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>funny that we have to say he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>black guy yeah</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why i was like man</p>
<p>right on because i was</p>
<p>excited about</p>
<p>how he was black</p>
<p>super powerful you know</p>
<p>like neil degrasse</p>
<p>tyson yeah he</p>
<p>said his son died</p>
<p>you know his father</p>
<p>died was he</p>
<p>robbing here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>story his father died brian</p>
<p>how dare you was he robbing a</p>
<p>place he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>white too the way you say it</p>
<p>he just smells</p>
<p>like cheese was</p>
<p>he fixing a convenience store</p>
<p>they were in baseball together him and his old man</p>
<p>they collect cards and</p>
<p>stuff so his</p>
<p>whole life became obsessed with time travel</p>
<p>because he wanted to go back in time and save his dad</p>
<p>wow it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>trippy shit</p>
<p>the guy has a peer reviewed</p>
<p>paper that he</p>
<p>wrote on time</p>
<p>travel where</p>
<p>physicists agree</p>
<p>theoretically this all makes</p>
<p>sense if you</p>
<p>could develop this kind of power you</p>
<p>could go back in time</p>
<p>right now we can&rsquo;t develop the kind of</p>
<p>power that&rsquo;s necessary to do it</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s some trippy</p>
<p>shit i think</p>
<p>he isn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>currently building</p>
<p>a light thing that he&rsquo;s trying to send a</p>
<p>light back in</p>
<p>time literally back</p>
<p>in time and it makes</p>
<p>sense what he&rsquo;s saying and i</p>
<p>actually when i</p>
<p>stumbled upon that i was</p>
<p>excited because i thought</p>
<p>you know time</p>
<p>travel i always thought it</p>
<p>would be possible</p>
<p>my mom worked at nasa when i was a little kid and i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the curiosity</p>
<p>started when i lived at</p>
<p>edwards air</p>
<p>force base they were always texting</p>
<p>like testing x jets and</p>
<p>crazy shit that the government was working on</p>
<p>which just made me knew that you</p>
<p>know they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>aware of shit that we had no idea</p>
<p>about and that&rsquo;s when i kind of got into time</p>
<p>travel and i thought you know</p>
<p>you could future time travel</p>
<p>just manipulation of time</p>
<p>basically you stay</p>
<p>above the earth&rsquo;s</p>
<p>atmosphere at a mile or go</p>
<p>a gazillion</p>
<p>miles an hour</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll come back and you&rsquo;ll have lost time</p>
<p>or no you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>ahead you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>still 30 but everyone will be</p>
<p>100 years old</p>
<p>right so i always knew that but i got really</p>
<p>excited when i read his</p>
<p>article that you</p>
<p>could go back in the past like wait a second</p>
<p>can you can do that</p>
<p>you know you can they</p>
<p>think you could</p>
<p>go back to the moment the</p>
<p>first time machine</p>
<p>was invented</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>i had this arc argument with</p>
<p>brandon christie</p>
<p>about this and the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>about time travel is like</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t time once it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exposed isn&rsquo;t it all</p>
<p>a moot point</p>
<p>after that yeah</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what they talk</p>
<p>about what the grandfather</p>
<p>clause if you go back and you</p>
<p>shoot your grandfather then</p>
<p>that makes it</p>
<p>impossible for you to time</p>
<p>travel but that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t because i</p>
<p>think that just means you</p>
<p>break time they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t take that</p>
<p>that option into consideration when people talk</p>
<p>about that story</p>
<p>the grandfather paradox they always say well if</p>
<p>you did go back in time you&rsquo;d kill your grandfather</p>
<p>before your father was ever born</p>
<p>therefore you</p>
<p>would never exist</p>
<p>to make the time machine but</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean you couldn&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>right you could</p>
<p>still do that people say well that</p>
<p>means you couldn&rsquo;t have a time machine well yeah you</p>
<p>could yeah you</p>
<p>could you would just do that</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>break everything right it</p>
<p>would be like a parallel line</p>
<p>like kind of like back to 1955</p>
<p>when it becomes string theory it goes off into another</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that believe in this is a very strange</p>
<p>theory but it</p>
<p>might be just as real as the one we live in</p>
<p>that they believe that every</p>
<p>second you live your life every</p>
<p>every decision you make</p>
<p>everything you do all the energy that</p>
<p>you put down</p>
<p>guides you into various</p>
<p>parallel dimensions</p>
<p>yeah and that we are not just living</p>
<p>in one dimension</p>
<p>that we are living in an infinite number</p>
<p>of dimensions that are all around us all the time</p>
<p>and we can choose to</p>
<p>slide through</p>
<p>these dimensions with our thoughts oh wow</p>
<p>is it as you</p>
<p>live your life as you live your life correctly</p>
<p>as you live your life</p>
<p>in the direction</p>
<p>that you want to do with little procrastination</p>
<p>focused and love and joy</p>
<p>as you do this correctly</p>
<p>you move through higher and higher</p>
<p>dimensions well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that they all</p>
<p>exist all around pretty much what buddhism</p>
<p>teaches too and the</p>
<p>whole thought</p>
<p>and even with the like the yogis they know</p>
<p>about that and</p>
<p>you know through meditation</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know about that</p>
<p>i mean you can&rsquo;t say they know about</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s a theory</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an idea</p>
<p>western science has come along</p>
<p>and started to pick a</p>
<p>pat and ask why you know</p>
<p>implying the</p>
<p>things in the</p>
<p>brain that make it possible did you guys see the</p>
<p>thing on cnn</p>
<p>last week with the alleged time</p>
<p>traveler lady</p>
<p>oh yeah that&rsquo;s nonsense</p>
<p>well first of all</p>
<p>baby there are</p>
<p>crazy people back then</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t even paying attention</p>
<p>they they had hearing aids back then exactly</p>
<p>right yeah what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy is that</p>
<p>video became big and then the next day all the</p>
<p>places were like no it&rsquo;s just a hearing</p>
<p>aid but yet i</p>
<p>still get emails</p>
<p>every day from people dude i watch</p>
<p>twitter masters all day is time</p>
<p>travel real</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s cell</p>
<p>phone towers in 1910 you fuck</p>
<p>right how is this fucking</p>
<p>phone working who&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>cunt calling yeah</p>
<p>who is she with</p>
<p>bitch calling the</p>
<p>future she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>calling from the past to the future because</p>
<p>otherwise it&rsquo;s not a fucking</p>
<p>phone for her to be calling</p>
<p>right but in</p>
<p>more realistic if she was just</p>
<p>like staring at it i&rsquo;m not impressed by someone holding</p>
<p>their ear up to</p>
<p>their head well</p>
<p>that one was just</p>
<p>they wanted to</p>
<p>throw it out there and they knew that</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t back it up like cnn ran it it was like</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>the fuck is</p>
<p>cnn running that for</p>
<p>it was the front page it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>so distracting it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>stupid and distracting</p>
<p>and you know i as much as i love time</p>
<p>travels like come on don&rsquo;t make a mockery of time</p>
<p>travel by showing crap like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what really sucks</p>
<p>think about if you</p>
<p>could even time</p>
<p>travel if you</p>
<p>could go to the</p>
<p>80s and whip out your iphone you get arrested for what</p>
<p>witchcraft dude i mean</p>
<p>they would stomp you to</p>
<p>death if they saw that thing</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s true it&rsquo;s like the kids</p>
<p>today we&rsquo;re closer to kids</p>
<p>who grew up in like the 1940s we&rsquo;re closer to cavemen</p>
<p>exactly the way</p>
<p>things have</p>
<p>changed yeah i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching kids</p>
<p>today growing up with porn from the get go yeah</p>
<p>these kids are like 13 they&rsquo;re</p>

<p>crazy primate</p>
<p>jungle of jersey italians yeah just</p>
<p>faking each</p>
<p>other and throwing shit at each</p>

<p>so i went from that to</p>
<p>hippies and gay dudes who are</p>
<p>naked smoking weed</p>
<p>hanging out with my aunt</p>
<p>that is hilarious</p>
<p>this is the craziest</p>
<p>fucking 180</p>
<p>ever and you got good parts of both</p>
<p>though when you say like good parts of like you know</p>
<p>the progressive thoughts and</p>
<p>ideas but also that you know you&rsquo;re not your typical</p>
<p>pussy comic</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you that</p>
<p>much the east coast</p>
<p>thing is where</p>
<p>men are forced to become men</p>
<p>sure at a quick</p>
<p>age you get fucked with</p>
<p>you know dude you&rsquo;re looking to kick your ass</p>
<p>right you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of the west</p>
<p>coast people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little more</p>
<p>relax than that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>relaxing that</p>
<p>but i think it creates people that</p>
<p>are a little more confused yeah there does seem to be</p>
<p>a survival of the fittest element</p>
<p>in the jersey new york area like</p>
<p>a lot of the kids</p>
<p>smart people there too man</p>
<p>talk to some</p>
<p>stressed out</p>
<p>smart motherfuckers in new york</p>
<p>oh yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tense man they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>stressed out</p>
<p>step outside for a cigarette</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on with</p>
<p>lehman marcus</p>
<p>the whole way the</p>
<p>system is set up it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>impossible for them to fail what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re getting fucking paid a little</p>
<p>these are smart</p>
<p>super intense</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>i have to choose what i do here because</p>
<p>i can go with you on this crusette</p>
<p>right yeah exactly i lose my life to this</p>
<p>crazy type of</p>
<p>thinking or</p>
<p>i can go yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna go to</p>
<p>california yeah and i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>smoke some pot and relax this</p>
<p>definitely is there is an intensity on the east</p>
<p>coast i mean there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely a reason all the ivy league</p>
<p>schools are on the east coast</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an intensity there and there&rsquo;s a fervor</p>
<p>about things i believe</p>
<p>part of it has to do with dealing with weather</p>
<p>yeah i think</p>
<p>the weather is a humbling</p>
<p>thing and i</p>
<p>think it makes you</p>
<p>you know you have to</p>
<p>stockpile food for the winter sure</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t just have to do it in 1950</p>
<p>you had to do it in 1850 when there&rsquo;s no refrigerator</p>
<p>right okay and a lot of</p>
<p>those people that</p>
<p>lived there are the</p>
<p>ancestors from people</p>
<p>lived i mean</p>
<p>those are the people that established it and the</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t for if they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>200 years ago</p>
<p>they were in another country okay and they</p>
<p>took a chance</p>
<p>coming over on a fucking</p>
<p>and boat some</p>
<p>place they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen when there was no movies</p>
<p>about it no internet</p>
<p>they had your stories</p>
<p>from someone a letter</p>
<p>you know dear john</p>
<p>i have made it here</p>
<p>to the new land</p>
<p>oh the fruit is plenty</p>
<p>the brown people are strange</p>
<p>have paint on</p>
<p>their face gold is</p>
<p>everywhere come soon</p>
<p>right so they</p>
<p>took chances and fucking got on boats and</p>
<p>traveled across a goddamn ocean</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s no gps</p>
<p>no cell phones</p>
<p>fucking flares</p>
<p>bitch if that fucking boat goes down your</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s it you&rsquo;re in the middle of the ocean</p>
<p>which is bigger than the continent</p>
<p>on a gamble for maybe god</p>
<p>damn it you&rsquo;re just hoping to</p>
<p>float it out you</p>
<p>crazy asshole</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how bad europe sucked</p>
<p>your suck so bad</p>
<p>in the 1700s</p>
<p>dudes are willing to get dysentery and</p>
<p>all around and</p>
<p>what would they get</p>
<p>from no vitamin</p>
<p>c they were fucking eating rats bro</p>
<p>to stay alive</p>
<p>people were</p>
<p>dying they were throwing</p>
<p>off the boat a lot of people died</p>
<p>they would get sick everyone</p>
<p>would get ill</p>
<p>yeah the plague</p>
<p>all that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>they come here they&rsquo;d rather come here to nothing</p>
<p>yeah to have an established you know</p>
<p>roads and shit that</p>
<p>we had nothing</p>
<p>and then we</p>
<p>built our own we</p>
<p>made our own yeah they came to trees and</p>
<p>water and they&rsquo;re like i&rsquo;ll take it will take it get</p>
<p>me the fuck away from</p>
<p>these douchebags over there</p>
<p>yeah exactly</p>
<p>and they kept the attitude too</p>
<p>especially on the east</p>
<p>coast where they</p>
<p>colonize they just kept the attitude</p>
<p>and i think it seems to me</p>
<p>that the west</p>
<p>coast is all slowly as</p>
<p>far as far as you get out</p>
<p>a big percentage of</p>
<p>those people are</p>
<p>gonna be the</p>
<p>children of the people who originally landed</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be the</p>
<p>people that got there everybody landed on the east</p>
<p>pretty much right</p>
<p>and so then they go oh fuck this</p>
<p>place let&rsquo;s keep moving west</p>
<p>yeah they kept</p>
<p>going and going and</p>
<p>going and going</p>
<p>so the people that made it all the way here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>spoiled children yeah</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like they don&rsquo;t appreciate</p>
<p>what it takes</p>
<p>to make all this happen like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lucky you&rsquo;re just in a</p>
<p>lucky spot you</p>
<p>found a spot</p>
<p>where it does the snow</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t get too hot</p>
<p>and hardly ever</p>
<p>rains it&rsquo;s an easy spot to live it really is</p>
<p>and they say it does something to the</p>
<p>psyche as far as</p>
<p>you know the lack of change kind of</p>
<p>almost puts us in a</p>
<p>trance yeah you</p>
<p>know when you</p>
<p>gear up for winter back</p>
<p>east and all that</p>
<p>i do like the idea of socializing there and the east</p>
<p>coast they are a lot more social with each</p>
<p>other and like if you&rsquo;re in new york you can see a real</p>
<p>heated debate get really heated but</p>
<p>never come to blows</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on the west</p>
<p>coast it would come to blows because comes to</p>
<p>stupid we don&rsquo;t comes to exactly</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t cross paths with each</p>
<p>other as much as they do we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>share a confined</p>
<p>space it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>spread out here it always has been</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s they walk</p>
<p>yeah they walk</p>
<p>no one walks here</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no walking</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>worse much worse setup</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>disconnected from all the people around you</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s such a big</p>
<p>contrast between the halves and halves knots here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most obvious this is the most</p>
<p>bling bling part of the country yeah</p>
<p>one of the reasons why it&rsquo;s because you feel</p>
<p>disconnected</p>
<p>from all the people that you&rsquo;re around you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>touching them you&rsquo;re not in contact with them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not on the</p>
<p>subway with them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not walking on the</p>
<p>street interacting with them</p>
<p>and because of that you feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>disconnected from them</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>a part of them they&rsquo;re something else and it makes a</p>
<p>separatism between</p>
<p>the two gaps and there&rsquo;s a lack of respect for each</p>
<p>other and it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing is you don&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>you know the most racist</p>
<p>homophobic people</p>
<p>are places where there aren&rsquo;t any</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>which is so</p>
<p>funny because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so i will</p>
<p>never understand people hate gay people because</p>
<p>at all the gay people i&rsquo;ve ever met</p>
<p>70 of them were</p>
<p>entertaining as fuck</p>
<p>nicest happiest people in the road</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like little</p>
<p>teddy bears that have</p>
<p>dicks and they&rsquo;re trying to fuck jeff the piano guy</p>
<p>was he one of the coolest</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>of all time</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so cool</p>
<p>so creative cool loyal</p>
<p>i mean that</p>
<p>a great guy</p>
<p>why would you care if</p>
<p>it had nothing to do with you that&rsquo;s what i don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the real prejudice should be</p>
<p>against people who are prejudice</p>
<p>against gay people</p>
<p>right what the fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with you you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like being look</p>
<p>it sounds like a terrible</p>
<p>thing to say but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>being upset at someone for any other</p>
<p>physical animality</p>
<p>like being short yeah you</p>
<p>know being being being having a big fucking nose like</p>
<p>you hate people that have a big nose</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s born gay if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think someone&rsquo;s born gay to</p>
<p>hang out with gay people</p>
<p>right who chooses</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you man</p>
<p>almost to a man they all were like when i was</p>
<p>seven i looked at the catalogs and i got hard on</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>sports illustrated made my dick</p>
<p>tingle they all</p>
<p>they all tell</p>
<p>you that man there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s some deep seated</p>
<p>fear that they</p>
<p>have it within them if they hate them i just</p>
<p>some dudes that</p>
<p>could be pushed into it and i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re very scared yeah</p>
<p>yeah those are very scary</p>
<p>on the fence people</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people they&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>wired to do what they&rsquo;re not supposed to do</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are just</p>
<p>wired to do shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong yeah i</p>
<p>think has something</p>
<p>to do with people that like blow job videos</p>
<p>guys that like blow job</p>
<p>well i think no i</p>
<p>think some dudes for real like</p>
<p>some dudes are so dumb</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re so like they</p>
<p>fight the system no matter what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wired to not do what they&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>right right if they&rsquo;re in a situation</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drunk and they&rsquo;re with a guy yeah the</p>
<p>situation and not do is not let this guy suck your dick</p>
<p>right but they</p>

<p>some really cool people are</p>
<p>starting to say</p>

<p>i buy this off of a</p>
<p>liberal road</p>
<p>but i do them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so funny that guy just</p>
<p>tuned into that dumb dumb ideology</p>
<p>that just dumb dumb</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m a fucking patriot</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m here to do this is a good god</p>
<p>christian loving country here and we need to support</p>
<p>all these goddamn</p>
<p>you know hippies out there and</p>
<p>liberals they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to take down this democracy this</p>
<p>great thing that was</p>
<p>founded in seventeen</p>
<p>ballon they&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>start rattling off facts and nobody</p>
<p>believes all that you think no</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re acts</p>
<p>they know their</p>
<p>acts they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all acts they know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s far more complex than that but it&rsquo;s that position</p>
<p>is an excellent</p>
<p>profit position</p>
<p>you can make a lot of fucking</p>
<p>money being the</p>
<p>super patriot guy right</p>
<p>against the</p>
<p>liberals especially because</p>
<p>nobody wants to be a pussy</p>
<p>okay liberals are pussies yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem that&rsquo;s a big you know people</p>
<p>go what are you a rogan don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re a liberal</p>
<p>no don&rsquo;t tell me i want freedom</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t tell me i want the ability to express yourself i</p>
<p>hindered i believe in the</p>
<p>first amendment</p>
<p>i think gay people</p>
<p>should be willing to do whatever the fuck they want to</p>
<p>do or allowed to do whatever the fuck they want to do</p>
<p>people should be able to get</p>
<p>married you shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know hate</p>
<p>crime shouldn&rsquo;t be real i</p>
<p>think yeah we</p>
<p>should figure out how to fucking</p>
<p>clean up the ghettos</p>
<p>i think we should</p>
<p>figure out how to</p>
<p>use some of our</p>
<p>taxes to fucking help out little kids that are</p>
<p>born into some</p>
<p>shit position and it&rsquo;s supposed to be all</p>
<p>within the jurisdiction of this country</p>
<p>so yeah why aren&rsquo;t we approaching that</p>
<p>so if that makes me a liberal</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m a liberal</p>
<p>which which</p>
<p>everything you</p>
<p>named a lot of people are</p>
<p>scared to realize that they are i have a lot of friends</p>
<p>especially back in arizona growing up there</p>
<p>you know who</p>
<p>like bro i&rsquo;m conservative it&rsquo;s like look at you</p>
<p>you look like a rapper</p>
<p>right now you&rsquo;re not conservative</p>
<p>you quote too</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not conservative you&rsquo;re just not</p>
<p>what people</p>
<p>think of conservative</p>
<p>a lot of it is</p>
<p>in support of big business</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a problem because they say well hey it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>capitalism that&rsquo;s why this country is so great</p>
<p>i totally am in</p>
<p>favor of big business</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t for them we</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have all this cool shit</p>
<p>but the problem</p>
<p>is big business likes to act like it&rsquo;s not a person</p>
<p>right like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>above being a person</p>
<p>if big business was a person and did all this shit</p>
<p>it would get sued and closed down and arrested</p>
<p>and you know it would</p>
<p>be an asshole the</p>
<p>caliberton there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>90 billion dollars missing</p>
<p>from iraq 90</p>
<p>billion if how burton was a dude</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s fucking gone man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like really bob</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ninety</p>
<p>billion missing ninety</p>
<p>thousand million</p>
<p>where the fuck is it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you could do that</p>
<p>they would arrest that guy that guy</p>
<p>would be in shackles and in the court</p>
<p>they would be the number one</p>
<p>story on the news ever</p>
<p>yeah bob haliburton in the in the</p>
<p>court today could be</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where he put the ninety</p>
<p>billion it&rsquo;s like misplacing a</p>
<p>state like where&rsquo;s wyoming</p>
<p>where did wyoming</p>
<p>go number 90</p>
<p>billion that is so huge</p>
<p>that is that is such a</p>
<p>sizable piece of</p>
<p>money that could do so much for every</p>
<p>state in the nation</p>
<p>they would notice that i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>major shit they&rsquo;re missing so much</p>
<p>money over there they&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>money from the</p>
<p>mercenary accounts</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where the fuck anything is</p>
<p>going that&rsquo;s amazing you</p>
<p>know that monsanto</p>
<p>the fucking seed corporation the</p>
<p>genetically modified food corporation</p>
<p>the one that sells seeds that makes everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and then makes the</p>
<p>farmer buy new seeds next year and if</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t use the seeds no</p>
<p>wax seeds yeah you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>reuse them like nature intends</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t like if you buy a fucking tomato</p>
<p>that tomato has seeds in it</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>you know or you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>rather you bite seeds for the tomato grow the tomato</p>
<p>and then take the seeds out of</p>
<p>tomatoes you grow and replant them they&rsquo;ll arrest you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re breaking the law</p>
<p>they just bought blackwater</p>
<p>jeez they did</p>
<p>jeez the devil</p>
<p>just bought</p>
<p>most evil corporation ever bought the</p>
<p>second most evil corporation that is</p>
<p>awful i saw</p>
<p>what they did to</p>
<p>those poor farmers</p>
<p>those poor guys</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like what am i supposed to do you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>growing seeds aren&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>a chick named</p>
<p>brooklyn from tapout</p>
<p>radio sent me a documentary and i watched it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>these people from</p>
<p>these impoverished</p>
<p>countries that</p>
<p>that committed suicide because they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>repay the debt that they</p>
<p>owed to monsanto</p>
<p>dude it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about how what they figured out was if you could</p>
<p>get patents on</p>
<p>plants yeah if you</p>
<p>could modify a</p>
<p>plant get a</p>
<p>patent on it then you own it then you copyright that</p>
<p>plant&rsquo;s yours</p>
<p>right no one else can grow it</p>
<p>you can control it just like</p>
<p>downloads on the internet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking nuts man they</p>
<p>figured out a way to do that with food they</p>
<p>figured out a way to copyright foods when i saw</p>
<p>food when i saw that i saw you know a</p>
<p>bunch of those the king corn and all</p>
<p>those other ones i was</p>
<p>honest to god</p>
<p>completely naive</p>
<p>about the whole</p>
<p>thing i don&rsquo;t eat fast food</p>
<p>right and that kind of crap but i was like i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m doing okay but i don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m getting the choice cut of beef at</p>
<p>ralph&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>from this corn fed</p>
<p>you know slaughterhouse</p>
<p>right they said there was something like</p>
<p>14 000 slaughterhouses in america</p>
<p>in the early 80s and now there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>like literally like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all going down through one company</p>
<p>tyson farms</p>
<p>and i can&rsquo;t remember the</p>
<p>other one but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>literally your meat is all</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if one&rsquo;s bad that&rsquo;s why people are getting</p>
<p>sick with the e coli like all over in mass numbers</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s regionalized anymore it&rsquo;s all centralized</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we make it here we chop the meat</p>
<p>up we put the bad with the good and we sell it to you</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>shit from you</p>
<p>know a farmer that you know is a farmer your</p>
<p>local luckily here we&rsquo;ve got them farmers markets but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s disgusting that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>fucked up thing</p>
<p>about people the</p>
<p>disconnect between the meat</p>
<p>and and your food</p>
<p>the disconnect between</p>
<p>where it comes from oh</p>
<p>yes there&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>disconnect there you know i&rsquo;ve told people that</p>
<p>i want to go hunting i&rsquo;m supposed to go hunting with</p>
<p>ricky schroeder this</p>
<p>season oh and</p>
<p>ricky schroeder loves to hunt</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s kind of crazy but</p>
<p>and i tell people</p>
<p>that like why</p>
<p>would you want to kill an animal why</p>
<p>would you want to do that like you eat meat</p>
<p>you eat me someone&rsquo;s killing that well</p>
<p>you know what i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to see it if i don&rsquo;t have to see it i want to see it</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to see it but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re experiencing what comes from it and that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a disconnect there that can</p>
<p>never be healthy</p>
<p>yeah can never be healthy to be eating animals</p>
<p>and not know what it feels like to kill an animal</p>
<p>right yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right about that</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t because you&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>appreciate it</p>
<p>you think about the</p>
<p>people that we consider the most in tune with nature</p>
<p>those are the american indians</p>
<p>right those</p>
<p>the ones that we always glorify and we always you know</p>
<p>saying that</p>
<p>these are the guys that were like in tune with</p>
<p>they used every part of the buffalo that they killed</p>
<p>yeah they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>waste anything they</p>
<p>lived harmoniously with</p>
<p>them and you know</p>
<p>they would praise the</p>
<p>spirit of the animal that provided them with food</p>
<p>this respect for</p>
<p>their own prey</p>
<p>was like very</p>
<p>prevalent throughout</p>
<p>their culture you know respect for the buffalo and all</p>
<p>these different stories</p>
<p>about the buffalo but we</p>
<p>came out and</p>
<p>slaughtered them all dude</p>
<p>i mean you want to talk</p>
<p>about how destructing</p>
<p>human beings can be that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>greatest stories ever oh yeah</p>
<p>just how many they</p>
<p>slaughtered</p>
<p>just slaughtered them in a</p>
<p>house short of time there was</p>
<p>millions of</p>
<p>they used to be all</p>
<p>over the place yeah</p>
<p>buffalo used to be like overwhelming</p>
<p>all over this country i</p>
<p>freak out if i saw one once</p>
<p>one in my life</p>
<p>yeah and they just went just nutty</p>
<p>shooting all of them and taking</p>
<p>their skins that was like a big business</p>
<p>shooting buffaloes</p>
<p>and selling</p>
<p>their skins yeah</p>
<p>and then they didn&rsquo;t know they were picking them off</p>
<p>like what you know just like cherries in the beginning</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t know to be afraid of man because</p>
<p>they never had been and they</p>
<p>never heard a gun</p>
<p>yeah you know they didn&rsquo;t know to scatter when they</p>
<p>heard that gun they just</p>
<p>boom one would drop</p>
<p>boom another</p>
<p>would drop talk</p>
<p>about a fucking species getting jacked</p>
<p>yeah species</p>
<p>living forever in this one spot having no problems</p>
<p>eating grass wandering around</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden these little</p>
<p>tank monkeys with</p>
<p>metal bang sticks</p>
<p>come out of nowhere just</p>
<p>start dropping</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>we talk about an</p>
<p>alien invasion man</p>
<p>how terrifying</p>
<p>must that shit pin to buffalo oh i know that&rsquo;s like an</p>
<p>alien invasion that&rsquo;s like fucking we are the war of</p>
<p>worlds right</p>
<p>because we are the</p>
<p>world we are</p>
<p>the world it</p>
<p>would be like we are the</p>
<p>world all the</p>
<p>monkeys are holding hands with the buffalo</p>
<p>i mean think</p>
<p>about how fucking</p>
<p>freaky that</p>
<p>would be if buffalo were intelligent</p>
<p>and this just</p>
<p>started happening and they were just</p>
<p>stuck with these</p>
<p>goofy buffalo bodies</p>
<p>i mean look at dolphin</p>
<p>bodies dolphins can&rsquo;t really move anything around</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you know they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>manipulate things</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>stuck just as much as buffalo are</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t say that man</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have an</p>
<p>effect on his environment</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first series of evidence that that</p>
<p>proves that you know</p>
<p>we wiped out indians buffalo</p>
<p>and everything yeah</p>
<p>we make shit extinct</p>
<p>and then we</p>
<p>bring a thing or two back like the</p>
<p>california condo but</p>
<p>again it was like yeah right</p>
<p>keep that spot at</p>
<p>all healthy</p>
<p>that little</p>
<p>prick who in my</p>
<p>front yard that owl i hate that</p>

<p>scary and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like the most ruthless predators oh big owls attack</p>
<p>eagles yeah</p>
<p>they go in eagles nest</p>
<p>while eagles are</p>
<p>sleeping and kill them how</p>
<p>about that those are</p>
<p>those fucking</p>
<p>talons that</p>

<p>pound animal there&rsquo;s a dude out in the tree</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>how much they actually</p>
<p>weigh but it looks like if it was a dog it&rsquo;d be like a</p>
<p>50 50 that take</p>
<p>five six foot wingspan</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a flying cat there was one outside</p>
<p>bigger than a cat way</p>
<p>bigger than</p>
<p>a cat there was one outside my window the other day</p>
<p>he was just sitting on my railing</p>
<p>motherfucker was</p>
<p>he had to be almost</p>
<p>three feet tall wow</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>a big fucking</p>
<p>gray thing yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m looking i&rsquo;m like that&rsquo;s like a demon</p>
<p>thing that only comes out at</p>
<p>night and just jacks things</p>
<p>takes advantage</p>
<p>of the fact that everyone else asleep and just fucks</p>
<p>things like you got to</p>
<p>think like the</p>
<p>first person see like i was thinking</p>
<p>about silverback gorillas it</p>
<p>compared to men</p>
<p>they were discovered pretty recently in the</p>
<p>grand scheme of</p>
<p>things i think</p>
<p>the mountain</p>
<p>grill in the 50s was like the</p>
<p>first time somebody came across like</p>
<p>this healthy</p>
<p>furry black man</p>
<p>who can i&rsquo;m half</p>
<p>black by the way audience</p>
<p>just to get</p>
<p>out of the way</p>
<p>but like just this a monster</p>
<p>monster there&rsquo;s a monster</p>
<p>ferocious vegetarian like and nobody would believe</p>
<p>little dick</p>
<p>little tiny ones yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s full animals at that</p>
<p>you notice them</p>
<p>versus the chimps the chimps are the ones with</p>
<p>those screws yeah</p>
<p>they start clapping</p>
<p>you know out of control</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like gangs but the gorilla just eats and sleeps</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;re vegetarians</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the difference yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clearly a difference</p>
<p>but i mean they&rsquo;ve figured out a way to</p>
<p>supply their body with just</p>
<p>plants so there&rsquo;s no need to be aggressive</p>
<p>except to protect themselves are you a vegetarian no</p>
<p>do you know</p>
<p>herschel walker</p>
<p>yes which is</p>
<p>is this diet real</p>
<p>it may not be</p>
<p>bread it doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense yeah but it does it how</p>
<p>does it make it</p>
<p>maintain man</p>
<p>apparently herschel</p>
<p>walker is one of</p>
<p>those guys and he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>a tremendous athlete</p>
<p>and incredible competitor he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great football player</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>a great spokesperson for</p>
<p>depression and for</p>
<p>brain injuries and shit like that</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker and he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tremendous athlete and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very impressed with the way he gets in his</p>
<p>strike force</p>
<p>the knock on him</p>
<p>is that he wants people to</p>
<p>think and know that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extraordinary</p>
<p>right you know so i mean he is</p>
<p>extraordinary as</p>
<p>an athlete he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>extraordinary work</p>
<p>ethic extraordinary abilities</p>
<p>but he wants people to</p>
<p>think that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something out of this world so</p>
<p>say something like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know this is true i mean this is just what i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard what i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard is that he&rsquo;ll say well i only eat a bowl of soup</p>
<p>a day meanwhile i&rsquo;m fucking eating food man look at him</p>
<p>he weighs 220</p>
<p>pounds he would disappear</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing stop it with your</p>
<p>crazy talk he&rsquo;s massive his traps</p>
<p>start from the bottom of his</p>
<p>ears and i don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>believe his dog</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m a huge fan</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s i mean i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard my whole life growing up there like</p>
<p>he only does push ups he only does prison work yeah</p>
<p>i mean does he does</p>
<p>i bought that but the meal</p>
<p>thing i was like there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense your body would</p>
<p>eat it through your muscles</p>
<p>would continue</p>
<p>to eat them so there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>food that&rsquo;s not enough calories yeah it&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one plus one is 89</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying to me you&rsquo;re saying you eat a bowl of soup</p>
<p>every day okay</p>
<p>you weigh 220</p>
<p>and you fucking</p>
<p>do mma workouts for</p>
<p>three hours a day</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re 47 exactly yeah what are you talking about</p>
<p>what are you talking</p>
<p>about you just</p>
<p>said some nonsense i&rsquo;m god</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really eating i don&rsquo;t even know what he really said</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve heard people</p>
<p>that were very knowledgeable that were professional</p>
<p>fitness people instructors</p>
<p>and personal</p>
<p>trainers fight</p>
<p>trainers and</p>
<p>nutritionists</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve heard every i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard like a conversation like</p>
<p>among six guys</p>
<p>and they were all saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no fucking way there&rsquo;s no way there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>even with supplements there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>way it&rsquo;s like this guy&rsquo;s eating food he has to eat food</p>
<p>you have you</p>
<p>know i mean some guys go</p>
<p>vegan there&rsquo;s a lot of guys that are vegans</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty extreme</p>
<p>antonio mckee&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>successful wrestler he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really good he&rsquo;s been undefeated for like i think six</p>
<p>seven years in a row</p>
<p>fucking takes guys down out work some</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>vegan straight vegan</p>
<p>make danzick</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s another one</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the deal though</p>
<p>how do you get</p>
<p>i mean how do you get your protein it&rsquo;s like i could</p>
<p>never be one i mean</p>
<p>was the best source because quinoa&rsquo;s is green yes</p>
<p>yeah spelled</p>
<p>queen nona it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spelled like q</p>
<p>u i o n a or something like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really good and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a grain</p>
<p>that has all the amino acids in it but</p>
<p>but if you have hemp protein you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get all of them and if you have</p>
<p>rice protein you&rsquo;re not getting it all of them</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get the same</p>
<p>stuff that you get out of meat</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re very careful you</p>
<p>gotta be really careful with your protein</p>
<p>i mean is it better to be a vegetarian do you</p>
<p>think i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think so not necessarily</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s an interesting story when</p>
<p>travis barker from</p>
<p>blink 180 whatever the fuck it is what is he from good</p>
<p>point tattoos but</p>
<p>with tattoos yeah</p>
<p>you know that guy got</p>
<p>terrible plane crash</p>
<p>with the dj</p>
<p>well when he got fucked up in that</p>
<p>plane crash</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when he became</p>
<p>a meat eater</p>
<p>because the skin</p>
<p>graphs weren&rsquo;t taking</p>
<p>skin graphs</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t taking and then once he</p>
<p>started eating meat they</p>
<p>started taking</p>
<p>wow i&rsquo;ve been eating hardcore</p>
<p>vegan for like the last couple weeks</p>
<p>how many dicks you suck in</p>
<p>those time but</p>
<p>no but i&rsquo;ve been only doing it like 90</p>
<p>of the time meaning i&rsquo;m not like i</p>
<p>still throw in</p>
<p>steak and and</p>
<p>stuff like that here and there</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m not doing 100 vegan</p>
<p>but i have noticed</p>
<p>since i&rsquo;ve been eating</p>
<p>it i just feel way better in like well you need to</p>
<p>clean your diet vegan</p>
<p>cheese by the way</p>
<p>so for you you need to</p>
<p>clean your diet</p>
<p>up you know that so well i&rsquo;ve always been</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always been eating healthy for weight watchers</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;ve been doing weight</p>
<p>watchers for like four years so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still i&rsquo;m not eating you still</p>
<p>love weight watch</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ve been on weight</p>
<p>watchers too</p>
<p>this whole time but you fluctuate</p>
<p>you go like back and forth what i&rsquo;m saying is that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re obviously not</p>
<p>watching it all the time</p>
<p>and if you do and you all of a</p>
<p>sudden get on a</p>
<p>strict thing like</p>
<p>a vegan diet</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re getting all</p>
<p>these nutrients and all this</p>
<p>fiber and all this</p>
<p>water in your</p>
<p>system you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to feel way better for sure</p>
<p>but a lot of it is because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been eating a shitlet a kinwa</p>
<p>though that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my new favorite</p>
<p>thing you lost</p>
<p>quinoa like i said it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spelled funky but it&rsquo;s protein or</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what they say is the most complete</p>
<p>plant based protein there&rsquo;s a place</p>
<p>called swingers</p>
<p>that makes the best</p>
<p>you just go there and get a side of it</p>
<p>i make protein</p>
<p>shakes i put</p>
<p>hemp protein in it hemp protein is pretty good</p>
<p>whey protein really is better</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i was doing i was doing</p>
<p>150 grams of the whey protein</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>strangely enough i developed a kidney</p>
<p>stone shortly</p>
<p>after that i</p>
<p>would rather get</p>
<p>shot next time</p>
<p>gotta drink</p>
<p>water son yeah</p>
<p>drinking a lot more now</p>
<p>very important that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>even better than</p>
<p>water you ever have coconut water</p>

<p>experiments in the basement mr</p>
<p>rogers was probably one of</p>
<p>those guys that was gay but</p>
<p>he never did anything</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do anything because he didn&rsquo;t want to ruin</p>
<p>his reputation he was like dexter</p>
<p>he kept this</p>
<p>he probably</p>
<p>home and cried he probably had three</p>
<p>secrets you know</p>

<p>small i&rsquo;ll say it was</p>
<p>small so it was like you know</p>
<p>definitely didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t like showing up to the set of</p>
<p>you know a major network it was tbs</p>
<p>but i had fun it was</p>
<p>enjoyable but</p>
<p>but news radio now that&rsquo;s huge now what was that</p>
<p>like showing it wasn&rsquo;t huge did that become a huge no</p>
<p>it became huge</p>
<p>after while we were on the air i mean we got this</p>
<p>indication sure</p>
<p>barely right</p>
<p>we were supposed</p>
<p>to get 100 episodes we accidentally did 98</p>
<p>but what happened with news</p>
<p>radio is we just kept getting</p>
<p>moved we got</p>
<p>moved nine times over the course of five</p>
<p>seasons yeah we got</p>
<p>moved like crazy</p>
<p>and you realize that a lot of</p>
<p>what puts a sitcom in certain places</p>
<p>like paul simms</p>
<p>used to talk</p>
<p>about it there was the shit sandwich</p>
<p>between friends</p>
<p>and there was something else that was on</p>
<p>after friends</p>
<p>it was great to something else it was good</p>
<p>and they would always sandwich</p>
<p>these shitty shows</p>
<p>in those spots before that</p>
<p>and those shows</p>
<p>would be huge</p>
<p>like there was</p>
<p>one called the single guy there was this terrible show</p>
<p>really nice guy</p>
<p>it was the star jonathan</p>
<p>something or another yeah i remember</p>
<p>super nice guy</p>
<p>but the show was terrible it just wasn&rsquo;t good</p>
<p>but meanwhile it&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>giant monster ratings just</p>
<p>right after</p>
<p>friends yes</p>
<p>so people would</p>
<p>watch it and</p>
<p>sims would bitch and we</p>
<p>would get moved around and we were on like tuesday and</p>
<p>sunday and wednesday and</p>
<p>monday we just got</p>
<p>moved all over the</p>
<p>place and no one even</p>
<p>when the show got canceled</p>
<p>it partially was because</p>
<p>phil hartman got killed</p>
<p>and so the last</p>
<p>season we did with lovett</p>
<p>and this season</p>
<p>the last season for a couple reasons wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>as good it wasn&rsquo;t as good because we had a different</p>
<p>executive producer</p>
<p>because paul sims was working on this other</p>
<p>thing called overseas that i was the star of it</p>
<p>was another sitcom that they were trying to do on nbc</p>
<p>and part of it was because</p>
<p>phil was gone</p>
<p>and it was a totally different vibe right</p>
<p>now so we had</p>
<p>you know john lovett who was very</p>
<p>funny but it was very different and we had to</p>
<p>kind of adjust and everybody was all fucked up because</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>a few months ago</p>
<p>the dude was hanging out with us and now he&rsquo;s murdered</p>
<p>we have to like do a</p>
<p>whole episode</p>
<p>where we have to like</p>
<p>you know talk</p>
<p>about how he died</p>
<p>and then this guy</p>
<p>the love its character gets introduced</p>
<p>so that was</p>
<p>part of the reason why it got cancelled but the</p>
<p>other reason was it wasn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>successful they</p>
<p>would come in we got</p>
<p>moved around so many times</p>
<p>the writers</p>
<p>would come in like this guy</p>
<p>lou morton who&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>very very funny</p>
<p>right and this</p>
<p>motherfucker got me addicted to quake</p>
<p>he was the guy who</p>
<p>got me addicted because he was really good at and we</p>
<p>would battle back and forth at work because they had a</p>
<p>whole quake</p>
<p>oh yeah local area network set up there</p>
<p>he used to come in</p>
<p>on the day of</p>
<p>the ratings were released with whatever number</p>
<p>we were because</p>
<p>it became like a joke written on his t shirt</p>
<p>and he came in one day and it said 88</p>
<p>88 we were 88</p>
<p>of all the shows on tv were</p>
<p>88 wow especially</p>
<p>about the 97 98 there</p>
<p>were there even that</p>
<p>many shows on tv</p>
<p>shows and she</p>
<p>were like whoa</p>
<p>wow 88 or we</p>
<p>might have been 84th it was in the 80s but</p>
<p>i mean the thing is that</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>just glad to show up and be working in hollywood&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>mean definitely</p>
<p>absolutely what i&rsquo;m saying is just</p>
<p>look i i people</p>
<p>would always</p>
<p>bitch people on the set</p>
<p>would be like this is fucking bullshit you know</p>
<p>why does you know</p>
<p>caroline in the city get to be on they were called</p>
<p>caroline in the shitty</p>
<p>you see the new</p>
<p>promo for caroline in the shitty</p>
<p>fucking shows terrible</p>
<p>there was a lot of that</p>
<p>going on there was a lot of that going on</p>
<p>on the set but</p>
<p>there was also a lot of people that were like this is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing something really special this is like a lot</p>
<p>of fun well as a comedian to you already have kind of</p>
<p>more of a blue collar work</p>
<p>ethic that we have</p>
<p>for actors i</p>
<p>think a lot</p>
<p>not all actors but i</p>
<p>for sure appreciated it more because i</p>
<p>never expected it</p>
<p>right you know yeah and that&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>thing actors they always grow up wanting</p>
<p>to be in sitcoms me i was in a sitcom like almost</p>
<p>per chance oh wow</p>
<p>the whole thing became i</p>
<p>never took is it</p>
<p>i heard this</p>
<p>story about that did i hear</p>
<p>right that ray romano was</p>
<p>he was the original</p>
<p>he was the original character couldn&rsquo;t cut it yeah they</p>
<p>fired him and then hired</p>
<p>another actor to do it for the</p>
<p>pilot so then the</p>
<p>other actor did it for the pilot</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>fired him and hired me</p>
<p>so i didn&rsquo;t really take ray&rsquo;s part i took the guy who</p>
<p>stole ray&rsquo;s part isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>something how stories work out like just that</p>
<p>that that close it</p>
<p>could have been some</p>
<p>other than worse</p>
<p>is decided to go a different way with it they just</p>
<p>you know it wasn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>ray wasn&rsquo;t good it&rsquo;s like you know ray was older and</p>
<p>it was more</p>
<p>relaxed and</p>
<p>i was trying</p>
<p>they were trying to figure out so they they</p>
<p>the next guy was like the zany</p>
<p>guy like ah what have i got over here</p>
<p>and then like</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t work either and then i just got</p>
<p>lucky i just came in</p>
<p>have you taken a</p>
<p>bunch of acting</p>
<p>classes no i&rsquo;ve been on a shitty show though</p>
<p>i got a development deal with fox</p>
<p>it was with disney</p>
<p>actually and then i was on the show called hardball</p>
<p>this is how bad the show was it was a baseball show</p>
<p>a sitcom and it</p>
<p>could have been</p>
<p>hilarious because the guys who originally</p>
<p>wrote it this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>named jeff martin and kevin kern</p>
<p>they were writers for the simpsons and they</p>
<p>wrote for married with children</p>
<p>brilliant they</p>
<p>wrote a brilliant</p>
<p>pilot the pilot was hilarious</p>
<p>yeah jim brewer was in the</p>
<p>pilot yeah and</p>
<p>mike starr you</p>
<p>might have seen him</p>
<p>using good fellows there&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>bunch of movies and</p>
<p>bruce greenwood</p>
<p>and there was a</p>
<p>good cast a</p>
<p>good alexandra wentworth</p>
<p>but the the</p>
<p>the real problem was with the network</p>
<p>and with uh</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>these guys jeff and</p>
<p>kevin to be the producers of the show</p>
<p>cause they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they knew how to run a show</p>
<p>so they brought in this</p>
<p>other dude this</p>
<p>other dude just</p>
<p>started fucking hacking it up</p>
<p>hacking it up</p>
<p>taking scripts</p>
<p>and just butchering them and just terrible jokes and</p>
<p>he would go and do coke on his yacht</p>
<p>with this girl who was playing my</p>
<p>girlfriend in this</p>
<p>first episode oh my god</p>
<p>became friends with this</p>
<p>chick and would take her on his yacht and they would</p>
<p>write and he</p>
<p>would do blown fucker and</p>
<p>come back with the</p>
<p>worst scripts</p>
<p>of all time</p>
<p>but when they would</p>
<p>come back she</p>
<p>would have like</p>
<p>more reliance</p>
<p>god no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great finally</p>
<p>it got to we filmed a few episodes with this guy</p>
<p>and he was so hated and it was so</p>
<p>the tension on the set was so bad</p>
<p>that they decided to fire him oh</p>
<p>good they got hot</p>
<p>and they brought in another guy</p>
<p>and the other guy closed it out and it was only</p>
<p>eight episodes only</p>
<p>seven of them aired and it was death</p>
<p>and i was done with that i was like fuck acting</p>
<p>this is terrible acting</p>
<p>this is the shit you have to deal with i was</p>
<p>ready to go back to new york</p>
<p>but i fucked up and got a</p>
<p>whole year lease on this</p>
<p>apartment i</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t afford</p>
<p>i was ready</p>
<p>to go back i was like this is i&rsquo;m done i&rsquo;m a comedian</p>
<p>like you were</p>
<p>that turned off oh</p>
<p>yeah i was totally</p>
<p>ready to go</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>boom i auditioned for newsradio and i&rsquo;m on it</p>
<p>i mean literally like a</p>
<p>month later i&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>this new show and i&rsquo;m fucking working with phil hartman</p>
<p>so i go from</p>
<p>never taking an acting class</p>
<p>never even thinking</p>
<p>about doing acting</p>
<p>doing stand up at fucking</p>
<p>jimmy&rsquo;s comedy</p>
<p>alley in queens</p>
<p>and then a week later</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m in hollywood and two months</p>
<p>later i&rsquo;m sitting across the</p>
<p>table read from phil hartman</p>
<p>going what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some cool shit</p>
<p>it was bizarre</p>
<p>i was beyond</p>
<p>bizarre yeah that&rsquo;s cool you&rsquo;ve lived like</p>
<p>multiple lives it seems</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re accomplished in multiple</p>
<p>arenas where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you did this</p>
<p>done with that do this done with that it&rsquo;s like i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>about life you have to keep</p>
<p>just trying new shit</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>things like a lot of times i&rsquo;ll say i want to get into</p>
<p>this but it&rsquo;s like my life&rsquo;s over i&rsquo;m 31 and be like</p>
<p>why not why not</p>
<p>do anything</p>
<p>you know how many times i contemplate</p>
<p>playing professional pool</p>
<p>i stop and think</p>
<p>about how much</p>
<p>money would</p>
<p>i have to squirrel away for a year to join the pro tour</p>
<p>and try to practice 8 10</p>
<p>hours a day</p>
<p>and try to make a run at playing pool and just</p>
<p>play i just want to</p>
<p>place an account</p>
<p>you know you got it in you because that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>you get that feeling</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when you come and you do something like this</p>
<p>like in hollywood or accomplish yourself in a sport</p>
<p>you become the</p>
<p>elite of your company it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you want to do it</p>
<p>again you want to find some different</p>
<p>things like guys who become scratch golfers like i</p>
<p>think justin timberlake</p>
<p>or somebody&rsquo;s almost like a scratch golfer at this</p>
<p>point like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really good i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>obsessed with him yeah i&rsquo;m like he</p>
<p>kinda should be</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>mean he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s musashi&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quote once you</p>
<p>understand the way</p>
<p>broadly you can see it in all</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of my favorite quotes</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about recognizing what it takes to really master</p>
<p>something really takes to get in tune with what is</p>
<p>great about something the buddha says if you want</p>
<p>to know how good you&rsquo;re doing it something look back</p>
<p>every 10 years</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s another one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one i love one</p>
<p>because that takes 10 years to see your progress yeah</p>
<p>which he always</p>
<p>means stop looking back at your progress and just keep</p>
<p>thinking it</p>
<p>right now goddamn</p>
<p>tricky buddhists yeah god damn it</p>
<p>was johnny appleseed real</p>
<p>or is that just a fictional character he&rsquo;s real and the</p>
<p>story is bullshit</p>
<p>what is the story</p>
<p>story is that he sprinkled seeds</p>
<p>basically all throughout</p>
<p>the what was it the western</p>
<p>state there</p>
<p>from across the the new</p>
<p>when the louisiana purchase happened i</p>
<p>think he went just go sprinkling seeds like all manic</p>
<p>seeds seeds</p>
<p>what but they</p>
<p>said something</p>
<p>they said i saw a thing</p>
<p>about seeds and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>apples don&rsquo;t grow that way yeah</p>
<p>seeds are don&rsquo;t go in certain regions</p>
<p>the first one dies you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a real maintenance you don&rsquo;t just sprinkle</p>
<p>an apple tree is a is a</p>
<p>is a hard fucking</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like a baby being born a lot of shit has to go</p>
<p>right really</p>
<p>i mean apple</p>
<p>trees are hard to pull off and</p>
<p>they said that him just</p>
<p>going around doing that all it</p>
<p>would create is like sour</p>
<p>grape size apples like it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work that way you</p>
<p>gotta cultivate you gotta</p>
<p>you gotta know what you&rsquo;re doing so do you think he</p>
<p>spent time to actually</p>
<p>plant them properly</p>
<p>or he just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really do it and he was just trying to get attention</p>
<p>i think he set up the</p>
<p>one actual little farm for himself but like i said the</p>
<p>second generation</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give off as good as the</p>
<p>first and you have to</p>
<p>stick around</p>
<p>and maintain that they act like he&rsquo;s just sprinkled it</p>
<p>along the countryside</p>
<p>a pot on his hat</p>
<p>maybe it was just his song to promote his</p>
<p>apple farm that he did i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the legends up there with paul</p>
<p>bunyan pretty much</p>
<p>watch it watch</p>
<p>watch shelly</p>
<p>appleseed is</p>
<p>great great</p>
<p>granddaughter</p>
<p>you motherfucker</p>
<p>do you think</p>
<p>do you think that you</p>
<p>would just get used to living</p>
<p>like people live back in those days</p>
<p>like do you</p>
<p>think i mean</p>
<p>do people just get used to it or do you</p>
<p>think it was like life suck back like did they know</p>
<p>where they like what the fuck</p>
<p>like life is too fucking hard i</p>
<p>think so i think with</p>
<p>those those</p>
<p>pioneers and people who came out to settle the</p>
<p>west i mean it&rsquo;s like big balls you know i give them</p>
<p>big credit for that because it&rsquo;s like they came down to</p>
<p>you know the soil and like</p>
<p>north dakota like you can&rsquo;t get through that shit</p>
<p>good luck farming</p>
<p>they got through that shit and</p>
<p>with horses and they were saying like</p>
<p>yeah the number of people coming out were just</p>
<p>dying and drove</p>
<p>but the ones they finally tackled it and got it</p>
<p>going you know</p>
<p>those are the ones</p>
<p>who obviously survived and</p>
<p>later thrived but</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t want to try that shit crazy life</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>thing they did on</p>
<p>national geographic</p>
<p>it was a reality show but it was</p>
<p>basically a survivor but no</p>
<p>prize to be won they just</p>
<p>threw you out here you got it</p>
<p>survive in alaska</p>
<p>so i watched that i</p>
<p>watched the</p>
<p>whole thing it was fucking</p>
<p>great dude it really</p>
<p>talks like dudes were getting hungry like in the</p>
<p>first six hours like i can</p>
<p>do this shit</p>
<p>and then when</p>
<p>like even a</p>
<p>real big like this cop dude like he couldn&rsquo;t hack it</p>
<p>after a while but</p>
<p>ladies were able to hack it was just</p>
<p>they were killing squirrels with</p>
<p>their bare hands to eat</p>
<p>and they quickly</p>
<p>adapted to that</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you say like after the</p>
<p>first week all</p>
<p>civility goes out the window no more</p>
<p>table manner i</p>
<p>watched one of the</p>
<p>first episodes only</p>
<p>but they couldn&rsquo;t find anything to</p>
<p>kill they killed a squirrel and it fell in a hole yeah</p>
<p>shot it and it fell in a hole and they couldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>yeah they couldn&rsquo;t get to and they were just starving</p>
<p>there was nothing delirious</p>
<p>like you have to start to</p>
<p>training your body in</p>
<p>this sick way to just take one morsel of something and</p>
<p>and maximize</p>
<p>your shit they&rsquo;d get a kill finally and they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>make a stew because a stew will go further and you can</p>
<p>transport a stew</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing too you got to</p>
<p>bring your food with you</p>
<p>you know if you kill something they</p>
<p>ate a fucking</p>
<p>ate a porcupine</p>
<p>yeah it was the most disgusting looking</p>
<p>thing when they feel</p>
<p>dressed this</p>
<p>thing things</p>
<p>spilled out of there i&rsquo;d never</p>
<p>seen in my life porcupine</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>it was something</p>
<p>about alaska just something</p>
<p>i think i got it saved</p>
<p>yeah it was good i</p>
<p>watched the</p>
<p>whole thing it was pretty damn good and in the end</p>
<p>they were emaciated looking they looked horrible yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about on the show that you ever</p>
<p>go to that website vbs</p>
<p>tv here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>vice guide to</p>
<p>travel there&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>series they do online it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great great</p>
<p>stuff and one of them they went to this guy</p>
<p>i think his name is hind mo</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a strange name</p>
<p>but this guy lives in like</p>
<p>northeastern alaska</p>
<p>he lives in like this area where</p>
<p>only a few people have</p>
<p>permission to</p>
<p>still live up there and he lives in this one room cabin</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s been up there for 30 years</p>
<p>this guy literally</p>
<p>never saw the</p>
<p>towers fall and he can</p>
<p>speak good english he&rsquo;s a very intelligent guy</p>
<p>and he lives his life just</p>
<p>hunting and gathering just following caribou around</p>
<p>shooting them he has a couple</p>
<p>cabins that he walks to he has no car</p>
<p>he does everything on foot</p>
<p>he gets supplies drops</p>
<p>yeah he gets like bullets and i</p>
<p>guess he must</p>
<p>get some vegetables i don&rsquo;t know what happens there</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if he gets canned vegetables but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not eating any vegetables on the</p>
<p>show what he&rsquo;s always eating is caribou that he kills</p>
<p>and fish that he catches</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what he does every day</p>
<p>every day he&rsquo;s following caribou around</p>
<p>shooting him but he&rsquo;s a very bright guy</p>
<p>and when he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talking he says that men got away from the</p>
<p>whole hunting and gathering</p>
<p>thing what is that</p>
<p>what is that is that fire alarm</p>
<p>fire alarm i don&rsquo;t know what that is huh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a water</p>
<p>water thing</p>
<p>that was crazy that was a pipe</p>
<p>i thought it was a</p>
<p>what kind of show is this</p>
<p>dude no this is that&rsquo;s how ghetto the show is</p>
<p>my pipes are making crazy noises</p>
<p>oh you know that is that&rsquo;s the in house vacuum cleaner</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been fucking up lately</p>
<p>he has these vacuum cleaners where you just yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve heard tale of</p>
<p>those before i was cool to actually see one</p>
<p>this house is the shit by the way</p>
<p>this is this is</p>
<p>thank thank god you got that that audition that time</p>
<p>huh it all worked out</p>
<p>money yeah well</p>
<p>so the reason</p>
<p>why i was willing to do something like fear factor was</p>
<p>after doing</p>
<p>like a bad sitcom and then</p>
<p>entertain the idea of doing another bad sitcom</p>

<p>you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never practiced</p>
<p>any of the impressions that i&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>i just do them</p>
<p>like with joey diaz or</p>
<p>something like that i just know i can do it and</p>
<p>i just do it yeah</p>
<p>are you that way too like you hear someone talk</p>
<p>yeah i think it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>gotta get out of your own way you just let it filter in</p>
<p>and come out come out</p>
<p>you know cause</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll hear</p>
<p>it if you try to scrutinize it you&rsquo;ll really</p>
<p>start to fuck it up but how do you practice it</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>listen to them on headphones and if i don&rsquo;t hear my</p>
<p>voice anymore that means i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>matched it whoa</p>
<p>it means i&rsquo;ve mashed it</p>
<p>like the morgan freeman i</p>
<p>started working on in eighth grade</p>
<p>well now hold on joe rogan</p>
<p>let me get to that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see here</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fellow</p>
<p>named morgan freeman</p>
<p>and i started working on the</p>
<p>impression when i was in the eighth</p>
<p>grade yes sir</p>
<p>i was about 14 years old</p>
<p>jerked off seven times a day</p>
<p>dude that is creepy</p>
<p>and it took me forever</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>and the way</p>
<p>i finally perfected it when i was like 22</p>
<p>i saw ben affleck on</p>
<p>dave letterman and he was doing a</p>
<p>morgan freeman</p>
<p>impression but it was horrible</p>
<p>but he was doing one</p>
<p>thing i wasn&rsquo;t doing</p>
<p>right is that</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s all in here</p>
<p>he was adding that but</p>
<p>everything else was</p>
<p>wrong and i</p>
<p>married the two and i was talking like</p>
<p>morgan freeman</p>
<p>all day i was calling restaurants but i&rsquo;d like to get a</p>
<p>table for two please</p>
<p>and they were like okay mr</p>
<p>freeman i was testing it out and i was like oh my god</p>
<p>this is amazing</p>
<p>so when i nail and i&rsquo;ve been working on tom</p>
<p>hanks for years and i</p>
<p>still can&rsquo;t get it there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those like iced like</p>
<p>morgan freeman everybody knows who he is but</p>
<p>nobody doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know yeah and it&rsquo;s somewhere in here i</p>
<p>found that i can yeah</p>
<p>i can go back and forth with it but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing a little yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>missing i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>game show hosty with it</p>
<p>right now but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>hahaha there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s world war two tom</p>
<p>hanks who&rsquo;s very solemn and talks</p>
<p>about world war two</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>conan o&rsquo;brien</p>
<p>sounds like the</p>
<p>shape of your head is wrong</p>
<p>but i can&rsquo;t make that noise</p>
<p>no i think that is i</p>
<p>think that has a lot to do with</p>
<p>impressions</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>impressions that i can do that</p>
<p>other people can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>right i think it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>shape of my face there&rsquo;s ways to</p>
<p>manipulate your throat</p>
<p>i mean i can tell</p>
<p>definitely you know you can move</p>
<p>contort your mouth like biggie smalls i</p>
<p>started working on that impression one time too</p>
<p>and i found out i could sound like a fat guy</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like you can contort your mouth</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a little too</p>
<p>much love ralphie</p>
<p>if you listening</p>
<p>you know we love you</p>

<p>obama alfie</p>
<p>smokes more</p>
<p>weed than any of us oh dude did you hear the</p>
<p>story about him getting caught</p>
<p>up there that was</p>
<p>so brilliant he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>my man is bringing weed</p>
<p>across the world yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>risky don&rsquo;t you know anybody there</p>
<p>you know i would i</p>
<p>would much rather try to find a kinect</p>
<p>you can find a kinect</p>
<p>man trust me</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be okay</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re growing that</p>
<p>shit like crazy out there</p>
<p>big time and</p>
<p>it probably goes well yeah it&rsquo;s a cash crop son</p>
<p>get it number one cash crop in</p>
<p>hawaii and they&rsquo;re trying to eradicate it all the time</p>
<p>today by the way proposition 19</p>
<p>today it all goes down how&rsquo;s it looking as you</p>
<p>may have been</p>
<p>checking the</p>
<p>their description</p>
<p>post is keeping a</p>
<p>latest news it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>52 7 if it loses it will mark</p>
<p>how oppressed we</p>
<p>truly are i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna pass</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like the gay vote</p>
<p>we all thought that was</p>
<p>gonna pass you know and i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>basing it on there has even been advertising there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not been some big push for it it&rsquo;s it seems like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely you know and then there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>against it a lot of the growers obviously because who</p>
<p>benefits during prohibition that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of the medical people are</p>
<p>against it right</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know man i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s evolution i</p>
<p>understand their position i feel bad for</p>
<p>doctors that have been prescribing weed if it becomes</p>
<p>legal then all of a</p>
<p>sudden hey where&rsquo;s my business</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m making all my</p>
<p>money sticking my neck out there prescribing weed</p>
<p>now i gotta</p>
<p>go back to giving kids band aids what the fuck man</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s tough</p>
<p>maybe it will</p>
<p>lower the cost of</p>
<p>health care because they all have to go be doctors</p>
<p>again and there&rsquo;s more doctors</p>
<p>how does that benefit that doctor just lost a job</p>
<p>brian this is illogical</p>
<p>yeah i think</p>
<p>you know they just</p>
<p>need to figure out another way to become a part of the</p>
<p>system so they&rsquo;re selling it man how</p>
<p>many of them fucking dispensary and you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny on the</p>
<p>other side of the cops</p>
<p>are you know obviously they</p>
<p>want it to be illegal so they don&rsquo;t have to deal with</p>
<p>this i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everybody knows it</p>
<p>should be it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>political suicide of fuck</p>
<p>about potheads they know potheads they know potheads</p>

<p>kennedy assassination that no one&rsquo;s ever seen before</p>
<p>sit in a room with that what did he say a</p>
<p>bunch of smoky industrialists yeah</p>
<p>you know what questions</p>
<p>yeah well what&rsquo;s my agenda</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it seem like there</p>
<p>kinda is though it&rsquo;s like think</p>
<p>about like the</p>
<p>skull and bones that you know</p>
<p>like these real real</p>
<p>upper echelon kind of</p>
<p>societies that you can</p>
<p>never belong to in your privity information that nobody</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most likely scenario</p>
<p>that these elite colleges and</p>
<p>keep this group of people in</p>
<p>power you talk</p>
<p>about people that have been the</p>
<p>skull and bones from college i mean it was john kerry</p>
<p>it was bush</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>bunch of different people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re groomed for this from freemasons</p>
<p>get go and it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>obama not necessarily</p>
<p>not really wasn&rsquo;t but was if you were</p>
<p>going to harvard</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not out of the question to become president it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>seven percent acceptance rate</p>
<p>there it&rsquo;s i think</p>
<p>everybody who becomes president always wanted to be</p>
<p>absolutely it didn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>occur to you someday</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the ultimate political rockstar</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is even john kerry was doing that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>he went to vietnam i mean at</p>
<p>least he went but that&rsquo;s why he went he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be president</p>
<p>so i could be a hero and get</p>
<p>pictures taken</p>
<p>yeah how ruthless is that</p>
<p>and go to war</p>
<p>and say i am a veteran</p>
<p>i fought for my country</p>
<p>claps and cheers yeah he didn&rsquo;t need to go</p>
<p>you know what i mean wow</p>
<p>yeah he was</p>
<p>definitely in college at the time</p>
<p>dudes like bush</p>
<p>like oh my back hurts</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s smart man</p>
<p>as i&rsquo;ve gotten older</p>
<p>my opinion of bush has</p>
<p>changed over and over i</p>
<p>was changing i used to</p>
<p>think that bush was this fucking</p>
<p>monster and this</p>
<p>ignorant piece of shit</p>
<p>you know thrust into</p>
<p>this scenario to kind of</p>
<p>lower our standards and make everybody</p>
<p>think that mediocre is good</p>
<p>and you can invent words and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay to talk about god</p>
<p>and then i realized that this is just a dude with a job</p>
<p>you see the relationship with dick</p>
<p>cheney and him</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>number one i think he&rsquo;s probably one of the most fun</p>
<p>of all presidents you can hang out with dude</p>
<p>you know in my opinion of him changed</p>
<p>when that guy threw his</p>
<p>shoes at him in iraq</p>
<p>oh yeah yeah that&rsquo;s when i started looking at him</p>
<p>when he ducked the shoe and smiled</p>
<p>and ducked the shoe and smiled</p>
<p>again he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like this ain&rsquo;t no ruthless murderer</p>
<p>you see some fucking dude who&rsquo;s just got a job and i</p>
<p>never thought that of him in the same</p>
<p>thing that bothers me when people shit on</p>
<p>obama for saying like oh he reads a teleprompter</p>
<p>you know how many</p>
<p>speeches he gives a day</p>
<p>yeah that is the dumb</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s got notes</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s prepared</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re upset that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>prepared you want to do a good yeah and it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing when people say</p>
<p>that george w bush is dumb i can promise you this he</p>
<p>would bury me in a political debate</p>
<p>he would no shit no he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t no he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t maybe not</p>
<p>about policy</p>
<p>no but not about anything stop it listen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a hundred</p>
<p>times smarter than that guy</p>
<p>yes for sure that</p>
<p>was something brought</p>
<p>in he was brought in</p>
<p>to represent the common folk the same way sure they</p>
<p>they enabled the</p>
<p>the conservatives to really</p>
<p>gain control this country by embracing the christian</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>when the reagan administration came in line</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>first time when they really went out of</p>
<p>their way to embrace religion oh yeah</p>
<p>go go go to the christians yet</p>
<p>the the really zeal</p>
<p>it christian</p>
<p>was no religious guy they never did</p>
<p>that before</p>
<p>the moonies are doing this all</p>
<p>these other</p>
<p>motherfuckers doing this they&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making millions of dollars from</p>
<p>these morons</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just tap into this shit</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll use this as</p>
<p>gonna be a big part of our platform</p>
<p>this will separate us from everybody else make us more</p>
<p>righteous it&rsquo;s amazing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>especially with</p>
<p>reagan it&rsquo;s like the conservatives always talk</p>
<p>about too it&rsquo;s like oh hollywood</p>
<p>liberals and</p>
<p>their actors and all that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the ones they</p>
<p>champion the most are actors right</p>
<p>ronald reagan</p>
<p>you know fred</p>
<p>thompson it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy that you would</p>
<p>allow a guy who&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>expert at lying and pretending</p>
<p>to be the guy who&rsquo;s supposed to tell you the</p>
<p>truth and a divorcee</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s yeah that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>chick that&rsquo;s a chicken being</p>
<p>guarded by wolves that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most ridiculous</p>
<p>thing ever you</p>
<p>getting a guy who&rsquo;s the best faker ever yeah</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna deliver the truth</p>
<p>what i shot a</p>
<p>thing recently</p>
<p>at the republican headquarters</p>
<p>here and it was amazing to be in there and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>pictures of ronald reagan as far as the eyes can see</p>
<p>which is understandable but i&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t you guys remember bush</p>
<p>41 and bush</p>
<p>43 they both were presidents too</p>
<p>no pictures at all they&rsquo;re like no no</p>
<p>brian brian go on youtube and find</p>
<p>ronald reagan&rsquo;s speech</p>
<p>where he talks</p>
<p>about aliens</p>
<p>have you been a speech</p>
<p>that is one of the trippiest</p>
<p>speeches of president has ever given</p>
<p>to people talking</p>
<p>about the intergalactic</p>
<p>he talked about if we</p>
<p>how quickly we</p>
<p>would abandon all of our</p>
<p>troubles with each</p>
<p>other if we were being attacked by</p>
<p>aliens from another planet oh wow</p>
<p>the fucking president was talking about this</p>
<p>jesus i mean he was making a</p>
<p>point clearly that you know</p>
<p>we would be united as one</p>
<p>you think we</p>
<p>would you think we</p>
<p>would for sure we were you</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;d go after each</p>
<p>other no we</p>
<p>would not we would not</p>
<p>if there was</p>
<p>if there was</p>
<p>aliens the only problem is if the</p>
<p>aliens got to like you know</p>
<p>some douchebags i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna mention any names and there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>some douchebag</p>
<p>countries right</p>
<p>like listen</p>
<p>just come with us we&rsquo;ll give you fucking flying</p>
<p>saucers to sell out</p>
<p>these other cunts</p>
<p>right now and then they</p>
<p>would go over and say listen we&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>peace with the</p>
<p>aliens the aliens</p>
<p>are friends we just come over here we&rsquo;ll show you</p>
<p>where they are</p>
<p>and boom you&rsquo;re in a cage</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re definitely hostile</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re coming</p>
<p>maybe well we are</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re hostile to</p>
<p>everything and like we talked</p>
<p>about the east</p>
<p>coast the west</p>
<p>coast and survival that it is and</p>
<p>you know just the what</p>
<p>the massive change has happened</p>
<p>in this country it&rsquo;s all been because of negative shit</p>
<p>all this massive</p>
<p>change a lot of it is because of negativity i</p>
<p>feel like something in our lifetime is</p>
<p>gonna happen like bigfoot&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get found</p>
<p>like something cool like that some</p>
<p>legend some</p>
<p>legend is gonna</p>
<p>get dispelled or some</p>
<p>legend is gonna get proven true</p>
<p>well you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the craziest theory</p>
<p>about your life</p>
<p>is that your life really what it actually is is as</p>
<p>the world gets crazier</p>
<p>and as more</p>
<p>chaos ensues and you</p>
<p>worry about extinction you</p>
<p>worry about</p>
<p>some sort of</p>
<p>a cataclysmic disaster that wipes out the race</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>realizing is that you&rsquo;re dying</p>
<p>and that your own</p>
<p>world this universe that you have created is slowly</p>
<p>starting to fall</p>
<p>apart the seems because your life is</p>
<p>starting to end</p>
<p>and this whole life</p>
<p>of history and</p>
<p>space it&rsquo;s all an illusion</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been created by your imagination and as it plays out</p>
<p>as it becomes more and more</p>
<p>ridiculous and catastrophic and</p>
<p>as it ends that&rsquo;s as your life ends wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>point to think of that way</p>
<p>just as possible as</p>
<p>you are one being and there&rsquo;s a billion</p>
<p>other beings and they&rsquo;re all in this one rock and</p>
<p>all this one galaxy and</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy as itself</p>
<p>in and of itself it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>crazy it makes</p>
<p>sense and it makes</p>
<p>you just realize sometimes too just a silliness like</p>
<p>sometimes you almost just want to sit down and just</p>
<p>laugh at the</p>
<p>silly shit that we do</p>
<p>oh my god why do i care</p>
<p>like i can detach</p>
<p>myself from something really quickly</p>
<p>through that you</p>
<p>know and that&rsquo;s what kind of like buddhism is always</p>
<p>about like just detaching from it not giving a shit</p>
<p>you know what i mean it&rsquo;s like if it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>affect you like</p>
<p>death does not</p>
<p>scare me it&rsquo;s like man it&rsquo;s gonna come</p>
<p>suffering fucking sucks yeah</p>
<p>suffering sucks being injured sucks being</p>
<p>you know being in pain sucks but yeah</p>
<p>death is like</p>
<p>sleep right losing someone sucks</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s sucks</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like everybody&rsquo;s biggest fear is</p>
<p>death and it&rsquo;s like if it ain&rsquo;t getting</p>
<p>and even if it is your biggest fear and</p>
<p>it happens then what</p>
<p>but then what happens i always talk</p>
<p>about how one of the trippiest</p>
<p>things in this life is that everyone likes to</p>
<p>sleep but no one wants to die</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking forward to</p>
<p>going away you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>forward to shutting off you know</p>
<p>right looking</p>
<p>forward to the relief</p>
<p>that you get from turning your body off and recovering</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s some pretty</p>
<p>crazy shit man yeah dude</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same kind of</p>
<p>effect that the dmts released during</p>
<p>dream state that supposedly</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>anecdotal evidence but that&rsquo;s what they believe happens</p>
<p>but all i know is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about i love it i love</p>
<p>going to sleep</p>
<p>here we go i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think about the fact that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna disappear for</p>
<p>eight hours and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>trust that the world</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fall</p>
<p>apart the seams and</p>
<p>explode while i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>unconscious</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be cool to be able to hibernate</p>
<p>dude bears don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really hibernate you know that they&rsquo;re always still</p>
<p>semicontinent blissful</p>
<p>kinda just relaxation they just don&rsquo;t do much</p>
<p>they just kinda like go fuck this sucks yeah i</p>
<p>guess they could</p>
<p>still get up and fuck you up man</p>
<p>yeah cause there are</p>
<p>bear attacks in the winter</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy yeah well the real</p>
<p>scary thing</p>
<p>about the bear attacks in the winter is there</p>
<p>most of the time</p>
<p>bears trying to eat you</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starving to death</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how grizzly man died</p>
<p>that crazy asshole that</p>
<p>was living up in alaska with all those</p>
<p>bears yeah you</p>
<p>heard the tape have you seen the</p>
<p>video i haven&rsquo;t heard the</p>
<p>tape the death tape</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a death tape</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t there a death tape</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not one yet they</p>
<p>wanted to get</p>
<p>it but it was what it was is the camera was running</p>
<p>there was only</p>
<p>audio right and</p>
<p>bernard herzog the director listens to it on camera</p>
<p>you see him listening</p>
<p>to that&rsquo;s what they should</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>play it at all</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>six minutes long there</p>
<p>did they show that guy on that i survived who got</p>
<p>basically eaten and mauled</p>
<p>by a bear and survived it the bear was shitting on him</p>
<p>peeing on him</p>
<p>like treating him like his kill it was so</p>
<p>nasty that&rsquo;s so scary</p>
<p>how did you get</p>
<p>out of that</p>
<p>there was a threat</p>
<p>you just got sick of</p>
<p>reagan show</p>
<p>this world rewind</p>
<p>from the beginning</p>
<p>their species</p>
<p>rewind it by</p>
<p>suddenly there was a threat to this</p>
<p>world from some</p>
<p>other species</p>
<p>from another planet</p>
<p>outside in the universe</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d forget all the little</p>
<p>local differences that we have</p>
<p>between our countries</p>
<p>the united nations</p>
<p>perhaps we need some outside universal threat</p>
<p>to make us recognize this common bound</p>
<p>i occasionally</p>
<p>think how quickly</p>
<p>our differences worldwide</p>
<p>would vanish</p>
<p>if we were facing an</p>
<p>alien threat</p>
<p>from outside this world</p>
<p>wow so true</p>
<p>space is filled with warriors</p>
<p>yeah just flying</p>
<p>other countries jacking people</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>think that we</p>
<p>galvanize and</p>
<p>annie up and i&rsquo;ll get together</p>
<p>like in science do you think so</p>
<p>well i think we</p>
<p>would to attack the</p>
<p>aliens but do you</p>
<p>think that any species ever gets to a</p>
<p>point where it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t fuck with the weaker species it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>think that a mass</p>
<p>collectiveness of</p>
<p>fight or flight</p>
<p>would happen i</p>
<p>think most would fly</p>
<p>most people just go hide and be scared</p>
<p>no no no no what i&rsquo;m saying is do you</p>
<p>think that alien life</p>
<p>in all all galaxies and all whatever wherever exists</p>
<p>wherever it</p>
<p>exists intelligent life do you</p>
<p>think it always fucks</p>
<p>with whatever is weaker than it does that just help</p>
<p>things become</p>
<p>strong yeah i</p>
<p>think so i think that&rsquo;s nature</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s just dominant survival so</p>
<p>they came here they</p>
<p>would have to fuck with us</p>
<p>they would have to fuck with us now the</p>
<p>thing i don&rsquo;t quite</p>
<p>understand is why everybody gives them credit</p>
<p>for being so</p>
<p>smart if they came here you know</p>
<p>cause they can</p>
<p>come in they</p>
<p>can get here but</p>
<p>what if we can get to</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>well we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting closer</p>
<p>we are getting closer</p>
<p>but more water on the moon</p>
<p>but but yeah they found</p>
<p>more water yeah</p>
<p>a lot more than they</p>
<p>thought yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also the idea that they</p>
<p>could use that as like the moon as a refueling stations</p>
<p>something up there</p>
<p>and they use that like as a launch because it&rsquo;s 260 000</p>
<p>miles out it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the same kind of gravity</p>
<p>right so they</p>
<p>could start launching shit from the moon but</p>
<p>you know you have to</p>
<p>prove to me that you can survive in deep</p>
<p>space for a long period of time that people are</p>
<p>going to willing to take be</p>
<p>willing to take that chance</p>
<p>yeah this is like</p>
<p>the mars project</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s another thing that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been concentrating on this idea of 100 year</p>
<p>spaceship a</p>
<p>spaceship that can exist and</p>
<p>has enough fuel to run a hundred years</p>
<p>and survive to</p>
<p>colonize galaxy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a project that&rsquo;s currently in development</p>
<p>that kind of</p>
<p>stuff like you know</p>
<p>fuck man that&rsquo;s some deep shit like if they really</p>
<p>a hundred years</p>
<p>spaceship and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>yeah but that</p>
<p>would suck like being on the hundred year</p>
<p>spaceship and then like a</p>
<p>couple years there they made like the two hundred year</p>
<p>spaceship and</p>
<p>man i would be on the two hundred year</p>
<p>spaceship so my kids</p>
<p>could live longer too</p>
<p>oh yeah but</p>
<p>change it i</p>
<p>think you have</p>
<p>a hundred years to get somewhere and if you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>there in a hundred years you&rsquo;re fucked but the thing is</p>
<p>how do they keep enough food</p>
<p>how big is this goddamn spaceship</p>
<p>are they growing</p>
<p>their own food like that</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;d have to do something you&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>to grow your own food and what kind of</p>
<p>power would you be able to use nuclear</p>
<p>power you have to use nuclear</p>
<p>power how the fuck else</p>
<p>could you what</p>
<p>if everybody got radiation sickness and shit</p>
<p>or you just by the time</p>
<p>you got there were you communicating with</p>
<p>shit three eyed</p>
<p>motherfuckers with</p>
<p>six arms and shit everybody was a mutant</p>
<p>while the radiation because they</p>
<p>never done long term exposure studies they had a</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t take a chance</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d sign up for that ship</p>
<p>yeah i always</p>
<p>think when people</p>
<p>think that maybe this if this is the last</p>
<p>generation or if the mayan calendar persecure</p>
<p>something like that i feel pretty damn</p>
<p>honored to be on the last</p>
<p>part of the last</p>
<p>generation again that</p>
<p>could just be</p>
<p>the end of your life man yeah exactly i manufacture</p>
<p>so it does that</p>
<p>mean that you&rsquo;re a character in my life seems like it</p>
<p>through your eyes i&rsquo;m or</p>
<p>am i in yours well</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;re all both</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s both maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s no tangibility to life</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s ether</p>
<p>oh maybe it</p>
<p>exists in both ways maybe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>a part of my imagination and i&rsquo;m a part of yours</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>crazy if you made up all this the</p>
<p>earth the atmosphere you made it all it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that you made it up that</p>
<p>it almost exists</p>
<p>as a part of your program</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>earlier lucid</p>
<p>dreaming like the ability to wake up during your</p>
<p>dreams until you do that</p>
<p>right done and i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t say i do it</p>
<p>often it&rsquo;s hard i&rsquo;ve only done it once</p>
<p>or twice by accident and because i saw a</p>
<p>movie where a guy had a technique</p>
<p>where in real life</p>
<p>every time he&rsquo;d walk through a door he</p>
<p>would knock</p>
<p>on a door he would</p>
<p>knock on the door and go am i</p>
<p>dreaming yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>trick that i</p>
<p>did it once in a</p>
<p>in a dream that stephen</p>
<p>dr steven and</p>
<p>burge is when i&rsquo;d read all</p>
<p>these books</p>
<p>about it quite by accident one day but i</p>
<p>started reading</p>
<p>it was fascinating because he did it at stanford</p>
<p>and taught all</p>
<p>these kids to do it and</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where they were so good at it they were developing</p>
<p>skills in their</p>
<p>dreams they</p>
<p>could do it at will</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>like laying down in bed and saying here&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna dream</p>
<p>about tonight</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>meditation practice</p>
<p>you can do it two ways you can wake yourself up in a</p>
<p>dream or you can just</p>
<p>enter it straight in</p>
<p>and that takes extreme concentration like</p>
<p>focus focus focus but</p>
<p>you know in it it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>start to realize how fascinating your brain is</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>completely reproduce something to a tea like you</p>
<p>like i fucking made that that&rsquo;s my thought i&rsquo;m walking</p>
<p>how many times have you done this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve done it probably like five times in my life it was</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard and the problem is it&rsquo;s like if you</p>
<p>smoke pot you don&rsquo;t get true rem</p>
<p>sleep like a lot of people like you know don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t seem to</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>potheads don&rsquo;t seem to remember</p>
<p>dreams as well some are different</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a different kind you&rsquo;re smoking</p>
<p>is that true</p>
<p>if you inhibit your your</p>
<p>your brain at all with alcohol anything you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a harder time</p>
<p>dreaming pot stops me from dreaming</p>
<p>google that see i don&rsquo;t kills dreaming</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t know but i know that the times i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>the best time</p>
<p>to have them they say is in the morning wake</p>
<p>yourself up like at six in the morning and go back to</p>
<p>sleep yeah like</p>
<p>thompson you</p>
<p>get them that&rsquo;s when you can get them</p>
<p>for the novice</p>
<p>they say and i&rsquo;ve only</p>
<p>had a few but they&rsquo;re amazing it&rsquo;s like you manufacture</p>
<p>this world you can fly</p>
<p>the thing that you tend to do</p>
<p>which i do is you go around</p>
<p>punching people because you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just amazing but your</p>
<p>brain is as real as you and i are right now</p>
<p>and if you just there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>focus and techniques</p>
<p>thing like you can use on youtube and stuff</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll show you how to do it</p>
<p>well what i</p>
<p>should explain what i was talking</p>
<p>about before just</p>
<p>the knock on the door yeah the guy said</p>
<p>knock on the</p>
<p>door in real life when you walk through your</p>
<p>house knock on the door and go</p>
<p>am i dreaming</p>
<p>right and then</p>
<p>obviously you walk through it you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>dreaming but</p>
<p>you feel the</p>
<p>knock and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how you know you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>dreaming well</p>
<p>i did this for a couple days and then i was in a</p>
<p>dream and i went</p>
<p>am i dreaming</p>
<p>oh my god i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>dreaming right</p>
<p>my hand just went</p>
<p>right through the door right</p>
<p>i was like whoa</p>
<p>and so then i open up the door and the door was like</p>
<p>the edge of a</p>
<p>cliff yeah and there was like</p>
<p>clouds and shit i just</p>
<p>started flying wow isn&rsquo;t this shit the dope is fucking</p>
<p>it for like thirty</p>
<p>seconds and it</p>
<p>cause i was going</p>
<p>holy shit i can&rsquo;t believe i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>dreaming yeah</p>
<p>how am i doing i&rsquo;m awake they</p>
<p>say that it that&rsquo;s what happens the</p>
<p>first time is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so overwhelmed by it you&rsquo;re like shot my load my</p>
<p>pants yeah it</p>
<p>was like oh</p>
<p>my pants off</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what happened i was like really</p>
<p>gonna have sex yeah oh fuck</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like if you practice it enough it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>meditation you can get good at it</p>
<p>apparently i just forget to practice it cause i just</p>
<p>crash half the time</p>
<p>well you know you asked me</p>
<p>about the isolation tank that&rsquo;s got to look into</p>
<p>fuck all that i</p>
<p>dream yeah because the isolation tank is lucid</p>
<p>dreaming in ten minutes guaranteed yeah</p>
<p>right guaranteed</p>
<p>every time you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go somewhere</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s awesome and the more</p>
<p>you the more you</p>
<p>relax the more you get</p>
<p>good at it and the more you get good out of the deep</p>
<p>you can go and the</p>
<p>weirder things get</p>
<p>my dad always told me</p>
<p>about it as a kid he did it a lot in the air force</p>
<p>what do you live</p>
<p>what part of la we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a place in burbank</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called soothing solutions it&rsquo;s really good and</p>
<p>they have these tanks and you rent</p>
<p>them by the hour and you get</p>
<p>totally worth it man</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s try it it&rsquo;s the same temperature as your body</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t feel your body</p>
<p>right you don&rsquo;t feel your body</p>
<p>you just feel the water</p>
<p>when you get into it and the</p>
<p>water is filled with 800 pounds of salt so you float</p>
<p>alright and then once you relax</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re floating in that</p>
<p>water and you don&rsquo;t hear anything</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see anything you have no sensory input</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>place in venice called the</p>
<p>float lab that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the guy who</p>
<p>built my latest tank the</p>
<p>state of the art guy if you go to fulltlab com he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>all his lab</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s got all of his</p>
<p>tanks and the design like it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>stainless steel and shit his</p>
<p>stuff is like real high tech like top of the line oh</p>
<p>wow it&rsquo;s basically the same</p>
<p>amount of money as the</p>
<p>other tanks on the</p>
<p>market right</p>
<p>he charges the same amount</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking infinitely superior there</p>
<p>how long can you</p>
<p>can you stay in</p>
<p>those i go in there for</p>
<p>hours really</p>
<p>hours yeah it&rsquo;s just like extreme</p>
<p>meditation it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>space travel dude i have a</p>
<p>spaceship and</p>
<p>the things that i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>the shit that i see on a regular basis in there</p>
<p>most people don&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>experience their</p>
<p>whole life and i</p>
<p>experience it several times a week</p>
<p>which the cool</p>
<p>thing is because</p>
<p>the body if you&rsquo;re not physically there it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still a real experience</p>
<p>you know what i mean it&rsquo;s that you</p>
<p>still your mind is still</p>
<p>learning experience</p>
<p>yes if it were real yes because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re untethered from your body</p>
<p>so your body and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get any</p>
<p>input from your body so your mind is free to just</p>
<p>explore any idea</p>
<p>and manifest and visualize</p>
<p>these ideas</p>
<p>right you know your imagination when it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>harness or not like being controlled by the body</p>
<p>you know or being</p>
<p>hampered down by the body your imagination like creates</p>
<p>worlds oh yeah</p>
<p>you know we don&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>know exactly what</p>
<p>thinking and imagination</p>
<p>truly is yeah we&rsquo;re not tapped</p>
<p>what is imagination the ability to create in your mind</p>
<p>i mean that seems to me</p>
<p>to be some sort of a driving</p>
<p>force in the universe</p>
<p>if you look at what the idea of imagination</p>
<p>the idea of creation it manifests itself in a</p>
<p>bunch of different things</p>
<p>it manifests itself in art</p>
<p>and it manifests itself in inventions and it</p>
<p>manifests things that</p>
<p>improve your life and keep people healthy and</p>
<p>keep people</p>
<p>alive longer</p>
<p>so they figure</p>
<p>things out more so they come up with better ideas</p>
<p>these are all products of the imagination</p>
<p>everything from</p>
<p>science to vitamins</p>
<p>these are products</p>
<p>that someone went</p>
<p>i think i can</p>
<p>get that shit out of there and put it in a pill</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the imagination that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the mind trying to be curious and figure this shit out</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s like a driving</p>
<p>force of the universe and it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like an all</p>
<p>ubiquitous force too</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s like sometimes</p>
<p>inventions are</p>
<p>being thought of at the same time yeah sure</p>
<p>like the wright brothers you know they were working on</p>
<p>thing but there</p>
<p>was that guy over in england who had his</p>
<p>thing he was working on they were racing each other</p>
<p>i mean flight</p>
<p>was inevitable you knew it was perfect perfect example</p>
<p>what you saying</p>
<p>earlier that cell</p>
<p>phones if you had them in the past people would</p>
<p>think of them like you were a witch</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve said that so many times</p>
<p>perfect example</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s two people looking something both of them are</p>
<p>going well what</p>
<p>is going on here and then</p>
<p>both people come to some sort of the same</p>
<p>conclusion when they figured out</p>
<p>radio it was the same</p>
<p>thing there was a</p>
<p>bunch of people that figured out the radio</p>
<p>it was marconi</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>bunch of different guys</p>
<p>who were working on</p>
<p>the same situation</p>
<p>and then every now and then you get a guy like</p>
<p>nikola tesla</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so fucking far out there</p>
<p>no one thought of any of the shit that he came up with</p>
<p>and you look at his</p>
<p>stuff you&rsquo;re like what the</p>
<p>fuck is this dude on that da vinci</p>
<p>they had da</p>
<p>vinci up at the getty</p>
<p>and i went and looked at</p>
<p>his scribblings just like he</p>
<p>literally you</p>
<p>know the helicopter all that shit the</p>
<p>guy was so bloody</p>
<p>genius brilliant like his</p>
<p>sketches were just like i cannot believe somebody was</p>
<p>thinking this advance dude</p>
<p>ever but this wasn&rsquo;t even like the 1400s</p>
<p>somebody made a threat</p>
<p>about it on the rogan</p>
<p>board saying</p>
<p>what was it</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>this is the guy said</p>
<p>if you lived in a</p>
<p>world where everyone else had down</p>
<p>syndrome no man</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it must have been like to be da vinci</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve lived in the 1400s creating helicopters machines</p>
<p>bisecting the</p>
<p>human body what</p>
<p>diagramming into a tee</p>
<p>and your neighbors just some retard just like what</p>
<p>saith you sir</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s fucking a sheep</p>
<p>and he probably and he&rsquo;s probably one of</p>
<p>those guys like i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe it&rsquo;s the fucking fourteen hundreds i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wait i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna be here</p>
<p>right time travel</p>
<p>yeah big time dude</p>

<p>i i think there is</p>
<p>going to be time</p>
<p>traveling good we can do that shit</p>
<p>yes there will be but there hasn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why no there hasn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>and then when it does happen it&rsquo;s like i said it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make everything null and</p>
<p>boys gonna break the</p>
<p>whole package</p>
<p>did you know they filmed</p>

<p>there&rsquo;s nothing sadder than a dude who&rsquo;s on a ride he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>so true that&rsquo;s so true</p>
<p>regular civilian ones are</p>
<p>marrying some</p>

<p>so fuck jack</p>
<p>nichols said old decent</p>
<p>texas fella too</p>
<p>good luck oh i know</p>
<p>good luck with all your fucking country</p>
<p>logic stupid</p>
<p>this shit ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna work out i&rsquo;ll change him</p>
<p>what has been the</p>
<p>weirdest thing</p>
<p>about coming here</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>starting out</p>
<p>you know doing all the you</p>
<p>know working for the comedy</p>
<p>store and doing all</p>
<p>that shit and then eventually winding up on television</p>
<p>starting to make</p>
<p>money what&rsquo;s been the</p>
<p>weirdest part</p>
<p>about it to you</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the weirdest part is</p>
<p>for me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the distance put in between</p>
<p>some of your peers</p>
<p>that you started with</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s this idea that comedies like</p>
<p>freshman football</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been at it long enough i</p>
<p>should get my shot but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bullshit some guys just haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>wild sense of that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not good there&rsquo;s a you know you&rsquo;re just resentment</p>
<p>among some guys that don&rsquo;t become</p>
<p>successful about</p>
<p>people who are and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really something sad too because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like you know we</p>
<p>started off ten years ago a</p>
<p>bunch of us together me caperola</p>
<p>ren is easy</p>
<p>and it worked</p>
<p>for some of us and for some it didn&rsquo;t and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>owed to you because</p>
<p>like i said it&rsquo;s like it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>hard even if you&rsquo;re really good it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hollywood doesn&rsquo;t owe anybody anything not a damn</p>
<p>thing and it didn&rsquo;t ask you to come here and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t tell you when to</p>
<p>leave but you got to know</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s some people like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get it at the comedy</p>
<p>store like guys be like oh man screw the</p>
<p>store i don&rsquo;t get spots there but it&rsquo;s like tell me the</p>
<p>other clubs that are giving you spots they can</p>
<p>never name one</p>
<p>you know and if they do it&rsquo;s some hole in the wall</p>
<p>yeah but if it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a comedy is the most justified art form</p>
<p>and you know there&rsquo;s enough</p>
<p>the audience is</p>
<p>right there to tell you whether you&rsquo;re any good</p>
<p>when i lived in boston it was a</p>
<p>shocking when guys</p>
<p>would go somewhere and like get sitcoms or be in movies</p>
<p>you know what the</p>
<p>local headliners would go</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking middle</p>
<p>act because this guy&rsquo;s a middle act and he&rsquo;s in a movie</p>
<p>like to them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they didn&rsquo;t get theirs</p>
<p>right that was a big attitude amongst boston guys</p>
<p>on especially</p>
<p>after steven wright hit</p>
<p>is a great documentary</p>
<p>about boston</p>
<p>i forget what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>fucking shit</p>
<p>boston comedy</p>
<p>we look up documentary on big</p>
<p>scene before the</p>
<p>laughter died some i don&rsquo;t know the fucking same</p>
<p>boston and common</p>
<p>thing there fantastic</p>
<p>scene with the problem was the all the headliners</p>
<p>that were the main part of the movement</p>
<p>in like the 70s and the 80s</p>
<p>especially the 80s all the guys who were like</p>
<p>literally the most talented comedians in the country</p>
<p>they stayed in boston</p>
<p>and they just burnt out they did coke and they fucking</p>
<p>party they all</p>
<p>owed the irs</p>
<p>million dollars</p>
<p>and they were fucking savages</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>write they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>write a lot of new material but</p>
<p>back then in</p>
<p>those days i</p>
<p>would put them up</p>
<p>against any</p>
<p>comic ever so people that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard before i would</p>
<p>put don gavin up</p>
<p>against any</p>
<p>comic i&rsquo;ve ever seen ever as far as</p>
<p>craftsmanship skill</p>
<p>delivery timing confidence</p>
<p>passion and</p>
<p>not even passionate i should say</p>
<p>just his charisma on stage</p>
<p>his ability to just</p>
<p>get you to laugh at</p>
<p>just the perfectly timed joke</p>
<p>they just a killer they don&rsquo;t like to</p>
<p>leave the neighborhood</p>
<p>well they got rich there</p>
<p>i mean when you&rsquo;re making you know</p>
<p>several thousand dollars a week doing comedy in boston</p>
<p>well so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go on the road and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make one fourth that and people are gonna not</p>
<p>come out to see you you know you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>punch line atlanta</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know who the fuck you are so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s half full</p>
<p>crowds and they don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about boston</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t want to hear all your boston jokes</p>
<p>which are your best jokes</p>
<p>right you know there&rsquo;s a lot of guys</p>
<p>that have all this boston centric material in boston</p>
<p>and they will</p>
<p>crush with it they will</p>
<p>rush with it</p>
<p>but if you go to virginia they don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about what they want to talk</p>
<p>about dennis</p>
<p>leary in that scene like</p>
<p>who came out yeah he</p>
<p>was in the scene he kind of got out of</p>
<p>scene pretty</p>
<p>quick though he got out of the</p>
<p>scene with his</p>
<p>mtv shit and then with</p>
<p>his first special</p>
<p>where he got all the</p>
<p>comparisons to hicks sure</p>
<p>where everybody was</p>
<p>going stealing hicks material yeah i&rsquo;ve seen those</p>
<p>different ones</p>
<p>and in their entirety</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re interesting</p>
<p>very interesting</p>
<p>yeah pretty obvious</p>
<p>real obvious yeah he was a hack</p>
<p>from the beginning</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really sad it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a guy that just was real</p>
<p>super ambitious just wanted to make it and this is his</p>
<p>thing he found this</p>
<p>thing he created</p>
<p>crafted this character</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>he needed some material to go</p>
<p>along with it so he</p>
<p>just kind of copied whatever</p>
<p>other people said that was cool and</p>
<p>reworked it it</p>
<p>was very obvious i see that happen with some guys</p>
<p>especially who have been</p>
<p>just for a few</p>
<p>short years and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll get an opportunity i&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>those guys do that</p>
<p>for just to survive</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>the biggest problems with a guy like minstelia</p>
<p>minstalia and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few</p>
<p>other guys in town you know</p>
<p>where they are</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a few guys that are doing</p>
<p>well and they&rsquo;re doing well by doing just that and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>blatantly obvious to</p>
<p>young kids coming up</p>
<p>so instead of like when i</p>
<p>started out in boston i mean</p>
<p>you were you were like ostracized if you were a</p>
<p>thief you were</p>
<p>you were a hack you were</p>
<p>your point and</p>
<p>there was mistakes</p>
<p>and sometimes people come up with jokes they don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know that somebody else said it i&rsquo;ve seen it before</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s mistakes and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people forget that they</p>
<p>heard a joke before</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all sorts of shit that</p>
<p>people have parallel</p>
<p>thinking that&rsquo;s possible too</p>
<p>but there comes a</p>
<p>point in time when you watch in dudes</p>
<p>where you know they&rsquo;ve seen someone before</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>oh ho he&rsquo;s just doing this and reworking it and</p>
<p>changing it making it this way</p>
<p>right because there&rsquo;s such a specific like</p>
<p>you know the thing</p>
<p>obviously with the</p>
<p>carlos thing that bill cosby</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like that</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s not common</p>
<p>thinking my god that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a sociopath</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that dude&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>disconnect you</p>
<p>gotta be you hear him on the mark marin</p>
<p>podcast yeah i</p>
<p>heard that oh</p>
<p>god and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>good for mark for having him back the same</p>
<p>you know what i don&rsquo;t feel good</p>
<p>about that i feel like i did</p>
<p>was gross yeah that&rsquo;s why he said</p>
<p>that he was embarrassed</p>
<p>by how gross</p>
<p>sound balls yeah</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t just softballs it was like</p>
<p>he was like saying well you got there through comedy at</p>
<p>least you did</p>
<p>it to come i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck that means</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a real comedian</p>
<p>what does that</p>
<p>mean you like comedy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like come on you know what is the</p>
<p>thing is he has this</p>
<p>thing for people who&rsquo;ve made it through comedy</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>thinks that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>right way all</p>
<p>these other people have sold out man</p>
<p>man you didn&rsquo;t do it the</p>
<p>right way it&rsquo;s like good luck the</p>
<p>grossest thing</p>
<p>about the marathon</p>
<p>was that he</p>
<p>thought that</p>
<p>the video that brian and i made</p>
<p>he said i think it</p>
<p>should have been handled through the community</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>he said yes oh yeah that&rsquo;s right that we</p>
<p>could have been handled somewhere like how has it ever</p>
<p>been handled through the community ever name one time</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>whole purpose for the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>the community didn&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>they all knew he was</p>
<p>stealing everyone from comedy central knew he was</p>
<p>stealing everybody that worked on the set on that show</p>
<p>i knew writers they all knew he was</p>
<p>stealing this was not</p>
<p>no one was stopping this</p>
<p>and then marin</p>
<p>says this and then he goes and has him on for fucking</p>
<p>three hours talking</p>
<p>about it yeah</p>
<p>oh it should have been</p>
<p>handled into</p>
<p>the community inside the community you just talked</p>
<p>about it for</p>
<p>three hours on</p>
<p>a podcast that was broadcasting</p>
<p>to the community our</p>
<p>video was 10 minutes long mark</p>
<p>exactly i remember</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just but he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those dudes marin is one of</p>
<p>those i remember that</p>
<p>night and god damn if that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really expose him if that didn&rsquo;t that was it</p>
<p>oh it worked it did work</p>
<p>it straightened</p>
<p>out it straightened</p>
<p>out a real problem it was amazing to</p>
<p>see marin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>comparisons were so</p>
<p>ridiculous because he was like you know he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about parallel</p>
<p>thinking or guys</p>
<p>sounding like guys that&rsquo;s yes</p>
<p>those are obviously</p>
<p>those are very real circumstances it happens</p>
<p>amongst comics i mean i</p>
<p>found myself many times in my career</p>
<p>sounding like</p>
<p>other comedians that i admired</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a big difference between that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ganking people&rsquo;s shit</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all on</p>
<p>see it was doing it blatantly in</p>
<p>front of everybody all the time i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s done for him he&rsquo;s a pariah</p>
<p>right yes he is what he is</p>
<p>his audience has been reduced to what it</p>
<p>should have been in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>people without an internet</p>
<p>connection and</p>
<p>people who are so</p>
<p>stupid they don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re full of</p>
<p>shit what what kind of</p>
<p>what kind of</p>
<p>what does he look at is he&rsquo;s doing theaters</p>
<p>how is he doing</p>
<p>good i&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s making a living</p>
<p>you know look there&rsquo;s plenty of retards out there bro</p>

<p>people in say but it&rsquo;s like come on there&rsquo;s so many of</p>
<p>them let&rsquo;s talk</p>
<p>about that we live in a nerfed society</p>
<p>we live in a society that makes it real easy for</p>
<p>these pussies to get by yeah</p>
<p>and they just turned out</p>
<p>dumb and simple</p>
<p>and they want to be around</p>

<p>the problem with voting the problem with voting is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s at least</p>
<p>as many of them as there are people that are sensible</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that are sensible that are barely keeping it together</p>
<p>the stress of</p>
<p>modern day society is too much for the fucking</p>
<p>mortal body</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s bodies are not meant for fucking four hours</p>
<p>every day in traffic and bullshit</p>
<p>and fucking stress at work because you</p>
<p>have to pretend to be someone that you&rsquo;re not because</p>
<p>you want to keep your job</p>
<p>so you have to listen to this fucking cuntbag</p>
<p>stupid retard boss</p>
<p>the only reason he&rsquo;s in there because he</p>

<p>these goddamn</p>
<p>liberals want to take my taxes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the problem we got a bigger problem</p>
<p>way much bigger problem</p>
<p>we are moving in a direction</p>
<p>and no one has analyzed the direction we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going it&rsquo;s just amazing when</p>
<p>those people though that they</p>
<p>think if you make less than two</p>
<p>hundred thousand dollars a year you&rsquo;re not republican</p>
<p>i hate to tell you but you&rsquo;re just not</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not a real one you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing and you&rsquo;re not servicing a</p>
<p>party that&rsquo;s made for</p>
<p>you isn&rsquo;t it amazing that they&rsquo;ve managed to connect</p>
<p>like being like</p>
<p>good folk and being like good god</p>
<p>guns and government</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve managed</p>
<p>to connect all that together with big business that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about you or the environment</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ve managed to</p>
<p>connect hunting and fishing like bush</p>
<p>would always be hunting and you know fucking the famous</p>
<p>thing where dick</p>
<p>cheney shot his friend</p>
<p>in the face</p>
<p>yeah you know and</p>
<p>sarah penguins always</p>
<p>shooting i kill</p>
<p>all the conservatives all the ones who want to let</p>
<p>these fucking raping companies</p>
<p>just continue</p>
<p>these monsantos and fucking</p>
<p>haliburtons</p>
<p>continue to fucking</p>
<p>just crush across the world yeah</p>
<p>these are the hunters and they get they get the people</p>
<p>like that like the palins and this it&rsquo;s cool it&rsquo;s chic</p>
<p>now and especially in this election</p>
<p>to be dumb yeah to not know anything</p>
<p>ignorance is now celebrated</p>
<p>in politics</p>
<p>elitism is poo pooed in shadow</p>
<p>now he went to an ivy league</p>
<p>school that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing when you go to an ivy league</p>
<p>school yeah he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t understand us yeah he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand us regular</p>
<p>folks no regular</p>
<p>folks should</p>
<p>people i start out on my dad&rsquo;s farm</p>
<p>whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa</p>
<p>what books have you read</p>
<p>right why the fuck are you</p>
<p>gonna be the leader</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>what is exceptional</p>
<p>about your philosophy yeah</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>people that are just good talkers that&rsquo;s all we require</p>
<p>right which</p>
<p>required him to be</p>
<p>able to talk good in public and look like someone who</p>
<p>could be leader the president</p>
<p>should be the</p>
<p>smartest person in the room</p>
<p>right but is that possible</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think that the whole</p>
<p>world needs leaders</p>
<p>i think that the way we</p>
<p>exist right now we</p>
<p>exist in the same manner that they</p>
<p>existed when there was</p>
<p>500 monkey people to a group</p>
<p>and they all had to</p>
<p>fight off the coming tribes</p>
<p>the tribes that</p>
<p>would come and try to</p>
<p>steal their shit</p>
<p>and they all had to rely on the baddest</p>
<p>motherfucker who&rsquo;s the guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been around the longest years ago knows how to escape</p>
<p>he knows the</p>
<p>trails he knows</p>
<p>where the food is in the woods he knows the best</p>
<p>places to hide</p>
<p>you know i think the president</p>
<p>should be miss america</p>
<p>every year we get to look at it hot you sexy president</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be awesome</p>
<p>like the president gives</p>
<p>speeches and like fucking swimsuits and</p>
<p>stuff that would be</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s hard to tell too it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>think about this like</p>
<p>obama he&rsquo;s only been in two years and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know and he did make a good</p>
<p>point on john stewart</p>
<p>show he&rsquo;s like i didn&rsquo;t guarantee this shit overnight</p>
<p>well and here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing can it be fixed</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it seem like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>built on a foundation of</p>
<p>unfixable shit</p>
<p>it seems like</p>
<p>our stock market this taibi</p>
<p>article that i was reading</p>
<p>about stock market</p>
<p>when he was talking</p>
<p>about how many companies</p>
<p>are betting against b</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s like this gigantic derivatives market</p>
<p>where people get to gamble on whether or not</p>
<p>someone defaults on</p>
<p>their loans</p>
<p>and gamble whether or not a company can</p>
<p>succeed and repay loans</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>shadow economy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>based on all that</p>
<p>mind fuck that is dude what i&rsquo;ve always said</p>
<p>about this is if they can rip off accountants</p>
<p>how crazy is this</p>
<p>shit how crazy is this shit for real</p>
<p>about you and i who know nothing</p>
<p>about the economy</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re ripping off accountants</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s how deep this fucking web</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re creating non tangible</p>
<p>things to make</p>
<p>tangible money and they&rsquo;re getting away with it</p>
<p>somehow now they&rsquo;re getting away with it</p>
<p>and instead of like</p>
<p>fixing and putting in a totally new operating</p>
<p>system they&rsquo;re just putting up</p>
<p>new paths and new</p>
<p>parts of the registry and new pathways and</p>
<p>talk about that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>stifles america&rsquo;s growth in a lot of ways like in</p>
<p>japan and china</p>
<p>their internet is</p>
<p>far superior to ours because is it really</p>
<p>because we use the</p>
<p>pre existing</p>
<p>structure super super fast</p>
<p>really they have</p>
<p>what do they use</p>
<p>what you call fiber</p>
<p>and see we have a pre existing</p>
<p>copper and kind of old</p>
<p>school wiring that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>cable companies in the internet</p>
<p>have never really gotten in bed in this country</p>
<p>everywhere else that internet tv&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>really to access the web from your tv</p>
<p>and have it just</p>
<p>starting to really do that now sony</p>
<p>is nice here</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a 40 incher yeah they got tv and it</p>
<p>gets everything from your</p>
<p>tv and they</p>
<p>should have that and that</p>
<p>technology has been available for 10 fucking years they</p>
<p>should have been doing that i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s been a lot of resistance there</p>
<p>has no cable</p>
<p>companies are big time like they run a fucking mess</p>
<p>major mate you want to talk some serious</p>
<p>you know con</p>
<p>artist it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cable company yeah</p>
<p>oh for sure and then</p>
<p>the internet popped up we already had a pre existing</p>
<p>structure and so china</p>
<p>never had one so they just</p>
<p>built all fucking</p>
<p>new one is like look at us that like they</p>
<p>laugh at our internets</p>
<p>instant yeah push</p>
<p>up instant do</p>
<p>whenever i do a thread on your message</p>
<p>board with like</p>
<p>speed test it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m all</p>
<p>proud of my you know</p>
<p>whatever 30</p>
<p>megabyte download</p>
<p>connection but then</p>
<p>30 megs something like that yeah and just the uverse</p>
<p>into universe yeah</p>
<p>damn 30 megs yeah</p>
<p>but then you look at</p>
<p>other peoples and they&rsquo;re like 88</p>
<p>dude i remember when i used to play</p>
<p>quake there was dudes that</p>
<p>would get like</p>
<p>four ping their ping</p>
<p>would be like four i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like how is this are you in the room with the server</p>
<p>how are you getting four</p>
<p>they were just on some</p>
<p>crazy fat fucking cable pipe</p>
<p>yeah when cable</p>
<p>cable internet</p>
<p>first came around and everybody else had like isdn</p>
<p>oh my god you would</p>
<p>you could get online and rape them</p>
<p>right they were like frozen</p>
<p>the shit would be like they&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>150 ping from like a 56k</p>
<p>modem or istn line</p>
<p>and what ping is is the amount of</p>
<p>milliseconds</p>
<p>it takes between the actual action and it happened</p>
<p>so you would have to lead</p>
<p>like if you want to</p>
<p>shoot a guy</p>
<p>with a railgun you&rsquo;d have to assume that he was</p>
<p>going to keep running in the same direction you</p>
<p>would actually lead him</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d aim right in</p>
<p>front of him with the rail gun and you&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>plan in your mind for</p>
<p>150 milliseconds oh wow</p>
<p>yeah that guys</p>
<p>were really good there was guys that</p>
<p>would kill you they</p>
<p>would fuck you up</p>
<p>even with a lag</p>
<p>cause they been</p>
<p>trying to lead</p>
<p>you they knew how to time the lag and they</p>
<p>knew like what weapons were good to like to like you</p>
<p>know deal with that non</p>
<p>non specific</p>
<p>aiming that you had to employ that&rsquo;s pretty damn</p>
<p>smart dude it was incredible</p>
<p>dudes become</p>
<p>you get tuned into it and you become like</p>
<p>one of things</p>
<p>about video games is</p>
<p>like your fast</p>
<p>twitch and your movements and</p>
<p>everything they become in</p>
<p>tune with the parameters of the game well they say that</p>
<p>teaches kids</p>
<p>skills today</p>

<p>their motor</p>
<p>skills cause i played that</p>
<p>grand theft auto but i never</p>
<p>stole cars i</p>
<p>would go play this</p>
<p>the free mode</p>
<p>where you can just run around the city and wreak</p>
<p>havoc and you</p>
<p>start to develop a lifestyle i became</p>
<p>a sniper a really good one i was lee harvey oswald</p>
<p>and i would snipe</p>
<p>people i was</p>
<p>really really good at it and i</p>
<p>would go sit on top of</p>
<p>buildings and i</p>
<p>would call you on the cell</p>
<p>phone because you had that earpiece and the guy</p>
<p>would be like</p>
<p>hello i&rsquo;d like say cheese</p>
<p>motherfucker boom</p>

<p>that game is so much fun now do you do this online</p>
<p>with the pc i</p>
<p>do it online</p>
<p>with the ps3</p>
<p>i fucking hate games</p>
<p>controllers that</p>
<p>get over you need to know play it for a</p>
<p>month and you&rsquo;ll get used to it</p>
<p>oh you only do it you only</p>
<p>do computers</p>
<p>mouse and keyboards better</p>
<p>just better</p>
<p>people i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried both i</p>
<p>understand the appeal</p>
<p>of game control it is</p>
<p>not as specific are the graphics better on a computer</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll just always</p>
<p>yeah the graphics are</p>
<p>better the resolution is better but more importantly</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>front of the</p>
<p>screen like you&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t be dealing with</p>
<p>if you really want to pay attention more than 21 inches</p>
<p>right 21 inches you want a</p>
<p>small screen it&rsquo;s not too big</p>
<p>cause otherwise</p>
<p>your eyes are not</p>
<p>gonna be able to keep up with</p>
<p>everything right</p>
<p>about that and a</p>
<p>mouse and a keyboard is way better</p>
<p>so you can move much more specifically with a</p>
<p>mouse and a keyboard</p>
<p>and a mouse is way more accurate as far as aiming</p>
<p>so in fast twitch games like</p>
<p>quake and unreal tournament</p>
<p>and all those</p>
<p>crazy games the</p>
<p>grand theft auto&rsquo;s not like that</p>
<p>can i get grand</p>
<p>theft auto on computer you can but</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to do</p>
<p>mousey that&rsquo;s a game</p>
<p>that mounts</p>
<p>grand theft auto is not a fast</p>
<p>twitch well all</p>
<p>video most games aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>moving to joystick though full</p>
<p>range of motion</p>
<p>most of them are</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve gotten so good at the xbox controller the ps3</p>
<p>controller that i don&rsquo;t even realize i meet</p>
<p>with my hands yeah</p>
<p>the problem is</p>
<p>that once you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>quake once you&rsquo;ve experienced this</p>
<p>super high adrenaline</p>
<p>rush of really high</p>
<p>speed 3d action</p>
<p>death death matches</p>
<p>only that game rocket</p>
<p>launchers i&rsquo;m all</p>
<p>about death</p>
<p>matches yes</p>
<p>yes yes bro</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m all but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want a regular</p>
<p>i want a game</p>
<p>where i can walk regular speed</p>
<p>right i want a game</p>
<p>where i can rocket jump</p>
<p>i wanna shoot a rocket</p>
<p>at the ground</p>
<p>and jump at the same time and go flying through the air</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s badass that&rsquo;s cool you</p>
<p>play so many more games</p>
<p>when you play</p>
<p>every time you talk</p>
<p>about that i get</p>
<p>bored when you play</p>
<p>deathmatch on no you like</p>
<p>those are the boring</p>
<p>i like that shit on</p>
<p>grand theft auto</p>
<p>that deathmatch</p>
<p>is a deathmatch</p>
<p>how many 18 people</p>

<p>remember robert from the comedy</p>
<p>store the manager</p>
<p>who got addicted to</p>
<p>robert davies not</p>
<p>world of warcraft no</p>
<p>every other one ever quest</p>
<p>was robert davies</p>
<p>yes you remember</p>
<p>robert yeah yeah i didn&rsquo;t know he was into that</p>
<p>famous robert quote</p>
<p>i say this all the time to people when i talk</p>
<p>about people who are addicted to games</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in the back of the comedy</p>
<p>store backed by the bar area</p>
<p>and he goes it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>weird i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>successful in my online life</p>
<p>but so unsuccessful in my real life</p>
<p>this is because</p>
<p>his online life and everquest he was a pimp it was like</p>
<p>a sorcerer with</p>
<p>magic and shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great yeah he had like</p>
<p>pet dragons in his online life there was</p>
<p>a there was a documentary</p>
<p>about those people the</p>
<p>world of warcraft did you</p>
<p>see that one it was amazing like how like but it was</p>
<p>dangerous it&rsquo;s like a bad drug</p>
<p>habit it&rsquo;s like no one</p>
<p>like dudes are having to</p>
<p>let the kids starve</p>
<p>yeah because they get addicted with</p>
<p>these online role playing games yeah i met this hot</p>
<p>chick that was like</p>
<p>supermodel hot</p>
<p>and i found out that she was addicted to that game like</p>
<p>twelve hours a day</p>
<p>world of work yeah and it just</p>
<p>blew my mind and was like okay this game</p>
<p>might not be too bad i would play</p>
<p>i would play</p>
<p>grand theft auto probably like up to four</p>
<p>hours a day and i felt like that was even a</p>
<p>waste it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>cool though to put</p>
<p>these headphones on</p>
<p>and not in the</p>
<p>click and enter into a</p>
<p>world where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of</p>
<p>other people online</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a gigantic massive</p>
<p>arena so you can</p>
<p>wander around all</p>
<p>these different areas someone that just came out</p>
<p>bobby lee keeps trying to get me to get</p>
<p>um he plays it all the time it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>las vegas oh no</p>
<p>fallout fallout fallout</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m playing</p>
<p>right now is that</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>yeah fuck yeah</p>
<p>if you played the</p>
<p>first one the fallout 3</p>
<p>dude fuck that get fallout 3 for 19</p>
<p>play that thing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll fucking love it and go beat</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>exact same game but it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>vegas i love</p>
<p>deathmatch and</p>
<p>gta so much i</p>
<p>never felt the need to play another game and then i</p>
<p>heard metal launers pretty</p>
<p>what is this fallout game like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like</p>
<p>first person shooter</p>
<p>mixed with like a role playing game but it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>these games that</p>
<p>because he likes</p>
<p>grand theft</p>
<p>auto it&rsquo;s just an open sandbox meaning there is</p>
<p>tons of different endings there&rsquo;s tons of different you</p>
<p>could either be a good person or a bad guy</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s cool is just</p>
<p>like going into</p>
<p>these towns and it&rsquo;s really realistic and you can go</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>do it with a</p>
<p>mouse and keyboard</p>
<p>because everyone everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>used everyone&rsquo;s used to</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as accurate</p>
<p>yeah but only a certain amount of games like like quake</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean well you</p>
<p>know they&rsquo;ve actually they&rsquo;ve actually had</p>
<p>game offs where they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken people with pc versions of the game</p>
<p>and play them</p>
<p>against people that yeah for quake</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just quick</p>
<p>well i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only certain</p>
<p>amount of games that need</p>
<p>to be that accurate meaning like if you are all playing</p>
<p>battlefield</p>
<p>with a controller</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that are</p>
<p>awesome at that</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m telling you is that you&rsquo;re missing one of the</p>
<p>most satisfying parts of the game well yeah but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking statistics and notice</p>
<p>quack i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>talking statistics in numbers i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about the most satisfying part of</p>
<p>these third person shooters</p>
<p>is having nasty aim</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being able to</p>
<p>blast dudes but they make games so that</p>
<p>which game with the controller in mind so</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>nasty aim playing any of</p>
<p>these games but you won&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>as good aim</p>
<p>as playing with the</p>
<p>mouse and the keyboard when they&rsquo;ve played</p>
<p>against each</p>
<p>other the mouse and the keyboard people always win</p>
<p>yeah but because it&rsquo;s more accurate i</p>
<p>understand that it&rsquo;s accurate enough but you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s accurate enough yeah</p>
<p>but if you were playing</p>
<p>against a guy with a</p>
<p>mouse and a keyboard it&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never playing with a guy with a</p>
<p>mouse and a keyboard you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>other people with control</p>
<p>but why would you do that if you know a</p>
<p>mouse and a keyboard is more accurate because</p>
<p>listen man the</p>
<p>whole thing is accuracy</p>
<p>in those games the whole</p>
<p>thing is in</p>
<p>quake the whole</p>
<p>thing is strategy</p>
<p>planning out your map and then being able to</p>
<p>accurately pick</p>
<p>a guy off they design the game with the controller</p>
<p>and accuracy</p>
<p>of the controllers</p>
<p>limitations in mind so what you</p>
<p>might be playing</p>
<p>quake where you are so i</p>
<p>understand this</p>
<p>brian you&rsquo;re repeating yourself but i&rsquo;m saying is it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter to me because i&rsquo;ll always know that the</p>
<p>mouse the keyboard is more accurate for a quake</p>
<p>no anytime it&rsquo;s more accurate no no</p>
<p>no you play</p>
<p>mouse is a more</p>
<p>accurate way of aiming</p>
<p>i bet if you get like the best</p>
<p>battlefield 1943 guy</p>
<p>versus the best 1943 guy on</p>
<p>a computer i bet</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be a huge difference</p>
<p>to where you</p>
<p>can go there&rsquo;s a difference man there&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>the mouse guys always win</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more accurate it&rsquo;s this is not like</p>
<p>this not like an opinion this is</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s pretty much</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more accurate</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re shutting off all games</p>
<p>on the council because you don&rsquo;t like the controller</p>
<p>where a game</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to get addicted to games period</p>
<p>grand theft</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna play the</p>
<p>most thrilling ones and the most thrilling ones to me</p>
<p>are first person</p>
<p>shooters deathmatch</p>
<p>style per sepera</p>
<p>quake counter</p>
<p>strike shit like that you&rsquo;re running around</p>
<p>shooting the</p>
<p>mouse and keyboard is the only way to go with</p>
<p>those that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exactly what</p>
<p>the deathmatch in</p>
<p>grand theft auto and you have all of new york city</p>
<p>is your playground and</p>
<p>a deathmatch</p>
<p>i could be down with that though but i</p>
<p>would want to be able to</p>
<p>get people with like a</p>
<p>mouse and key</p>
<p>where you could snipe people and shit</p>
<p>i am a nice</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>make sure they&rsquo;re not looking at i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>level 10 dude i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>quake you don&rsquo;t yeah i</p>
<p>opportunities dudes</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t sit around and just wait to be shot in the head</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s constantly moving oh yeah</p>
<p>you have to be very active oh</p>
<p>these guys move all the time you go to the airport</p>
<p>and have the</p>
<p>deathmatch dude i go find a nest somewhere and i</p>
<p>just let them run and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>leave them i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>eat them we call in</p>
<p>quake they call it camping</p>
<p>rocket jump up there was like certain</p>
<p>crazy trick moves that you could</p>
<p>do and one of them</p>
<p>was this dude figured out how to double rocket jump</p>
<p>to the top of this</p>
<p>tower he would</p>
<p>throw a grenade down</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would rocket</p>
<p>jump on the grenade oh that&rsquo;s so he</p>
<p>would make sure that the grenade he timed the grenade</p>
<p>clink clink clink</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would rocket</p>
<p>jump but oh</p>
<p>as it went on</p>
<p>and he would go sailing to the top of his</p>
<p>tower was a trick move</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would just jack people</p>
<p>and win the</p>
<p>map because you couldn&rsquo;t get him out of there</p>
<p>and he would just peck</p>
<p>you off of the rail i</p>
<p>could go get this</p>
<p>today quake</p>
<p>oh fuck yeah</p>
<p>they could have got it yesterday wait</p>
<p>one two three four they&rsquo;ve all been out you don&rsquo;t want</p>

<p>yet why do you want</p>
<p>why do you say you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>quick i want</p>
<p>quick i love it</p>
<p>because killzone 2 is a million times better there&rsquo;s so</p>

<p>warfare if you have where</p>
<p>where you can use</p>

<p>deathmatches</p>
<p>with quake are the most fucking thrilling shit</p>
<p>you can ever</p>
<p>hear online</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s whittled down to one dude online and some before</p>
<p>real exciting</p>
<p>right you love different</p>
<p>tastes than me</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just no no i&rsquo;m just saying my taste</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just saying that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken that game and have made it a million times better</p>
<p>no you&rsquo;re saying it to</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re saying to you kills on</p>
<p>pretty good there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>ton of games to me if it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>mouse and keyboard</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>accuracy you can</p>
<p>you can get</p>
<p>these for mac</p>
<p>is that most</p>
<p>of these games are</p>
<p>for mac also</p>
<p>a lot of the call of duty has mac caught up</p>
<p>max all right</p>
<p>ea has been pushing it a little bit</p>
<p>what what&rsquo;s a good one i can get they</p>
<p>all have that they all have boot camps i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a can i get</p>
<p>quake for mac yes</p>
<p>is it getting to a</p>
<p>point now though</p>
<p>where most games are just</p>
<p>going console</p>
<p>for the most part i mean they</p>
<p>still release them here and there</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re selling a million times more on console yeah</p>
<p>most consoles are becoming</p>
<p>just because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so you can have the best computer</p>
<p>and then you get that game and it&rsquo;s awesome next year</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to do something</p>
<p>about your computer if you want to</p>
<p>do as good as a console or whatever</p>
<p>so the console what they&rsquo;ve done is they just kind of</p>
<p>standardized</p>
<p>everything and this is what you get</p>
<p>and bam you just set it up if</p>
<p>should be updatable though</p>
<p>like sounds</p>
<p>i mean are the</p>
<p>your computer</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constantly updating</p>
<p>a computer that&rsquo;s the problem and then you get a</p>
<p>virus or you get something that slows down</p>
<p>your computer and then you&rsquo;re fucked consoles you know</p>
<p>everything is designed for the console like a</p>
<p>mac is you know all the programs are designed for macs</p>
<p>so it definitely</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t ever really get slower your ps3 is</p>
<p>gonna be as fast as this</p>
<p>first day you get is the last day pc</p>
<p>that quake on the way home that</p>
<p>you already got me and i love killing so</p>
<p>addictive dude</p>
<p>are you good at aiming with the</p>
<p>mouse and keyboard</p>
<p>no but i can get good at i</p>
<p>would go online</p>
<p>man and i would play</p>
<p>against dudes for professionals like</p>
<p>every now and then</p>
<p>dudes who are real professional players of being in</p>
<p>these these rooms and you go one on one</p>
<p>deathmatch against</p>
<p>these guys and just get</p>
<p>raped that just you know</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what kind of control and</p>
<p>domination someone</p>
<p>could have over you i always love it it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>exciting your fucking</p>
<p>heart is beating a million miles</p>
<p>just chasing</p>
<p>after you see</p>
<p>lightning going</p>
<p>right by your head and</p>
<p>barely missing you and i</p>
<p>did i love it i love</p>
<p>urban warfare too</p>
<p>especially that&rsquo;s the cool</p>

<p>gonna be easily</p>
<p>bored with it you&rsquo;re</p>

<p>for like the</p>
<p>vegas fallout</p>
<p>vegas or something now</p>
<p>why would you</p>
<p>say that why</p>
<p>would it be easily</p>
<p>bored if you like</p>
<p>he likes grand theft auto type games but he likes</p>
<p>deathmatch but just the</p>
<p>deathmatch in</p>
<p>grand theft auto i</p>
<p>never do the task</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never done any of the task</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>but you like the open in real you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>dying every</p>
<p>three seconds in</p>
<p>grand theft auto you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you only die</p>
<p>every three</p>
<p>seconds when you fight</p>
<p>no no no if you</p>
<p>watch in the</p>
<p>deathmatch you do</p>
<p>if you watch people in the</p>
<p>deathmatch or</p>
<p>quake people are</p>
<p>dying at least once</p>
<p>every minute or so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>okay once every</p>
<p>minute yeah</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>talking are you talking one on one are you talking</p>
<p>about the team</p>
<p>deathmatch free for all you know yeah</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m playing a deathmatch</p>
<p>in gta and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>18 people in it you&rsquo;re dying</p>
<p>about an average a minute</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re good if you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>right in the middle of it and</p>
<p>especially to me i&rsquo;m like you i get the sniper run</p>
<p>i get to collect my weapons there&rsquo;s like some health</p>
<p>some rooms where they only</p>
<p>allow like the moderator will only</p>
<p>allow rocket launchers so you have to just</p>
<p>basically go around shooting by people&rsquo;s feet</p>
<p>zero crap yourself up yeah</p>
<p>so those ones</p>
<p>those ones are cool too but i like</p>
<p>warfare like</p>
<p>collecting my weapons and getting a grenade and</p>
<p>yeah intactically</p>
<p>leading somebody into it well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>thing about the</p>
<p>deathmatch and</p>
<p>quake is that</p>
<p>you control a map and that the weapons will respawn</p>
<p>every 30 seconds that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>you could keep running around</p>
<p>snatching up the rocket launches as they respawn</p>
<p>right every time you get them you get like you know</p>
<p>extra rockets and this guy can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>shit so he&rsquo;s running around with his gay little pistol</p>
<p>with only a</p>
<p>certain amount of</p>
<p>bullets and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fully loaded with all the armor</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re timing all the armor</p>
<p>timing all the</p>
<p>weapon respawns you have all your weapons all your</p>
<p>armor and you&rsquo;re just raping him</p>
<p>every time he responds</p>
<p>how is it free</p>
<p>where are they making</p>
<p>money can you pull it up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an old</p>
<p>game quake has been around for a long time</p>
<p>and quake live is just</p>
<p>their way of</p>
<p>giving back to the community and making people</p>
<p>excited about</p>
<p>their game and making so that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a cross platform</p>
<p>thing that they can</p>
<p>do where it&rsquo;s web based and</p>
<p>so they can work on</p>
<p>their their</p>
<p>shit while they</p>
<p>develop new games they work on</p>
<p>their ability to</p>
<p>make them for the web do you</p>
<p>still play are you</p>
<p>still playing no it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scary to me yeah too</p>
<p>scary i don&rsquo;t want to lose my life</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about it so many times in the podcast i can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about it anymore but</p>
<p>i have a real addiction to games</p>
<p>i get addicted to things</p>
<p>um yeah me too we talked</p>
<p>about it i think</p>
<p>how many comics are like us a lot</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s part of you have</p>
<p>to be you have to be a sick fuck to want to go up and</p>
<p>make strangers</p>
<p>laugh to yeah extract an involuntary response for them</p>
<p>intermittently it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>weird and risk them not</p>
<p>laughing and</p>
<p>through them not</p>
<p>laughing and rebound and try it again yeah</p>
<p>should have seen i was in iowa</p>
<p>at the funny bone last week and the friday</p>
<p>night they just stared at us</p>
<p>stairs i was like oh my god this is</p>
<p>gonna be a long weekend luckily it was just a different</p>
<p>crowd and the rest of the</p>
<p>crowds were</p>
<p>great so much so</p>
<p>in fact i was very impressed i was like ah you guys are</p>
<p>you know pretty</p>
<p>fucking cool people here like they were very</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of cool people all over the country all</p>
<p>over the internet yeah</p>
<p>kids are cool</p>
<p>now just a very cool and like there&rsquo;s not there</p>
<p>was no conservative there&rsquo;s some you know some of the</p>
<p>libertarians</p>
<p>which are like i feel bad for real</p>
<p>libertarians the one that the teabaggers are</p>
<p>starting to</p>
<p>right extract</p>
<p>their message</p>
<p>which are nothing</p>
<p>about real libertarians aren&rsquo;t like that at all</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some real</p>
<p>libertarians</p>
<p>out there and some cool guys that talk politics and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some tea</p>
<p>baggers that are real</p>
<p>libertarians yeah there are</p>
<p>the ron pauls of the movement</p>
<p>and i feel bad that they get lumped in with the</p>
<p>wrong one the whole</p>
<p>when you know it&rsquo;s a very very tricky</p>
<p>thing when you</p>
<p>start getting a giant</p>
<p>group together because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like okay who&rsquo;s in this group</p>
<p>okay and what are your beliefs</p>
<p>right but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>calling yourself a tea bagger too but you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>black people</p>
<p>right okay and you</p>
<p>think obama</p>
<p>should go back to africa and you</p>
<p>think he was</p>
<p>born in indonesia and</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re a tea bagger too</p>
<p>right so it&rsquo;s like it gets confusing</p>
<p>whenever you have a big</p>
<p>group it&rsquo;s like god damn it do i have to</p>
<p>state what it is to be a tea bagger</p>
<p>you must love everyone</p>
<p>you know incriminately</p>
<p>you must do this you must do that you must not be a</p>
<p>civil war reenactor</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>libertarians had</p>
<p>theirs pretty well</p>
<p>mapped out though before they</p>
<p>you knew exactly what they</p>
<p>stood for no police</p>
<p>states is it</p>
<p>funny though that it&rsquo;s such</p>
<p>a fringe organization that it&rsquo;s thought of as fringe</p>
<p>like i voted</p>
<p>libertarian</p>
<p>oh you fucking idiot</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only way to make change if somebody</p>
<p>finally does something and says fuck this fuck voting</p>
<p>right or wrong</p>
<p>or fuck voting i&rsquo;m voting how i feel</p>
<p>instead of voting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like they were saying when</p>
<p>obama was running say i liked</p>
<p>ron paul a lot</p>
<p>i really liked it i was like that i kind of</p>
<p>i think i want to vote for this guy</p>
<p>i won&rsquo;t say whether i did or didn&rsquo;t but</p>
<p>i was more attuned</p>
<p>with everything he was saying</p>
<p>without a doubt but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this before</p>
<p>that they always made him out to be kooks</p>
<p>everyone on fox news</p>
<p>him out to be a kook everyone on cnn</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not impartial reporting that&rsquo;s not even the news what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing is they were programming us to</p>
<p>think that he was a joke</p>
<p>candidate that</p>
<p>really is sad because when you listen to that man talk</p>
<p>he says he makes more</p>
<p>sense than anybody</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not a politico</p>
<p>these are not</p>
<p>statements or</p>
<p>catchphrases</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;ll tell you honestly and it&rsquo;s like wow</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never get an office</p>
<p>because nobody will ever have the balls to pull the</p>
<p>trigger on you yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>wake up call whenever there&rsquo;s any political campaigning</p>
<p>whenever you</p>
<p>look at that</p>
<p>crazy lady in arizona what is the</p>
<p>woman&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>chan brewer</p>
<p>yeah who she made up some</p>
<p>crazy shit about her father dying in</p>
<p>world war ii</p>
<p>meanwhile her father&rsquo;s alive</p>
<p>there was that now</p>
<p>that dui things were</p>
<p>popping up yeah she&rsquo;s fucking crazy</p>
<p>she made up shit about</p>
<p>people losing</p>
<p>their headless</p>
<p>bodies being found</p>
<p>on the mexican border</p>
<p>and see her phone</p>
<p>on her fucking on debate how she just fro</p>
<p>she stopped for ten</p>
<p>seconds i was like who</p>
<p>does that who really does that i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t stop at gunpoint well</p>
<p>what it was explained to me was that she was she was</p>
<p>never even elected for</p>
<p>that job she was</p>
<p>given that job well when the politano lab</p>
<p>she was lieutenant governor she was</p>
<p>and you know what they will</p>
<p>elect her today</p>
<p>you think so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my old hometown man</p>
<p>i love my people</p>
<p>there and i love springtime in arizona but there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some politically</p>
<p>backwards it&rsquo;s gotten more backwards</p>
<p>since i&rsquo;ve left it was pretty cool in the 90s feife</p>
<p>simonton was governor but</p>
<p>we were in a club</p>
<p>in phoenix and</p>
<p>brian set me hip</p>
<p>to one of the</p>
<p>major problems in phoenix</p>
<p>do you remember that this is</p>
<p>a long time ago many many years ago cocaine</p>
<p>vampires oh yeah</p>
<p>we were in this club</p>
<p>and i had never done coke before</p>
<p>and brian goes</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s on coke</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what are you talking about</p>
<p>everyone everyone here&rsquo;s on coke</p>
<p>and i go okay okay</p>
<p>tell me how you know they&rsquo;re on coke and he goes</p>
<p>watch it goes you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna look around</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t look at you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna look around everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be touching their nose</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>gonna be talking and they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>gonna be very</p>
<p>excited and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like</p>
<p>a lot of fist pumps and a lot of fucking high fives</p>
<p>just look around</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden i looked around and there was like the opening</p>
<p>like the opening</p>
<p>scene and blade</p>
<p>where the blood</p>
<p>started spraying from the ceiling</p>
<p>i was confused</p>
<p>be like what the hell man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so true</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>hot during the day and they stay in the clubs all night</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very strange</p>
<p>thing and it happened in the old west even in wyatt</p>
<p>urps there&rsquo;s just always been this strange</p>
<p>outlaw rogue</p>
<p>mentality there</p>
<p>which is cool but here&rsquo;s a problem with phoenix</p>
<p>all right i love phoenix i love</p>
<p>going back there</p>
<p>yeah the problem with that</p>
<p>place is it gets too hot</p>
<p>120 at 2 00 a</p>
<p>m it&rsquo;s too hot and people stop</p>
<p>thinking when it gets that</p>
<p>hot it really isn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like you know i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t lived there in 10 11 years and i</p>
<p>could never i don&rsquo;t know how i</p>
<p>lived in it</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how i did it i don&rsquo;t know extreme heat</p>
<p>brings like a lackadaisic mentality</p>
<p>you lack a days ago</p>
<p>are you like oh</p>
<p>yeah it does you don&rsquo;t want to do anything you like</p>
<p>box there you just hopscotch</p>
<p>from air conditioner to air conditioner yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally what you did</p>
<p>not good i&rsquo;d rather have</p>
<p>i rather have</p>
<p>chili i&rsquo;d rather have 30 degrees</p>
<p>yeah i would rather have 30 degrees like</p>
<p>colorado perfect here</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like 75 degrees every day</p>
<p>it gets hot out here in the valley it gets hot</p>
<p>it gets it&rsquo;s awesome in malibu</p>
<p>yeah when you like</p>
<p>by the ocean</p>
<p>sound the marine</p>
<p>layer yeah because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never hot it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never cold it&rsquo;s always like 70 something degrees</p>
<p>you can always wear</p>
<p>shorts in november if you let&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>about the marine layer</p>
<p>keeps the heat out keeps the</p>
<p>to cool in when it needs to</p>
<p>until a big rock from the sky hits that</p>
<p>bitch and the</p>
<p>water comes a thousand</p>
<p>miles high towards the rocks</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll be out there looting son</p>
<p>will you be yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be out there looting will you go looting at the</p>
<p>first sign of anything</p>
<p>going wrong</p>
<p>would you put a mask on or do you think you would just</p>
<p>fuck it risk</p>
<p>those youtube</p>
<p>videos i think you know i would do is just go</p>
<p>completely like lord of the flies i get a</p>
<p>crazy haircut yeah</p>
<p>just do everything i</p>
<p>did one eyebrow maybe off you know whatever style yeah</p>
<p>do you ever worry</p>
<p>about that about the end of the society about</p>
<p>everything falling apart</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t worry about it i think</p>
<p>about it and like i said earlier i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>if i was part of the last</p>
<p>generation that be a kind of a cool thing</p>
<p>you know it would be it&rsquo;s like yeah yeah this</p>
<p>generation what about the last</p>
<p>generation that&rsquo;s some cool shit we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>dying together</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t matter because they&rsquo;ll be no one to tell a</p>
<p>story to but you know what exactly but there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no kaboom there&rsquo;s no we end all at once i</p>
<p>think the idea is just like in you</p>
<p>know how it&rsquo;s happened before it&rsquo;s something real bad</p>
<p>will happen and then people will die out and replenish</p>
<p>after a while but it&rsquo;ll just be shitty times</p>
<p>you know like even if</p>
<p>nuclear war happens all over the</p>
<p>world so we got it</p>
<p>too good right now with refrigerators and cell</p>
<p>phones we got it</p>

<p>about it is there</p>
<p>is is it&rsquo;s not even like people</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s racist</p>
<p>not really racist he just</p>
<p>believe some</p>
<p>crazy shit you know what like what</p>
<p>like like if somebody does something like well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re german</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be like haha</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cause they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>protestant it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>how do you even know</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s a very interesting character him and johnny</p>
<p>zap you know there&rsquo;s characters up there that you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never forget as long as you live</p>
<p>just a magnet for</p>
<p>crazy people it really</p>
<p>is and it&rsquo;s just like it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like a beacon</p>
<p>for them on the sunset</p>
<p>strip they would</p>
<p>never try to walk into another business</p>
<p>no they wouldn&rsquo;t walk into the</p>
<p>anda&rsquo;s next door they want to try that at the</p>
<p>house of blues they come</p>
<p>right to the</p>
<p>store it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>magnet and they know they can go to</p>
<p>the very back and come out without being hassled they</p>
<p>know they know</p>
<p>robert william improvise</p>
<p>you have fucking plastic bags popping out of his</p>
<p>clothes you</p>
<p>see him hanging out there</p>
<p>he insulates his body</p>
<p>with plastic bags because he&rsquo;s got to walk like ten</p>
<p>miles to get to the kind of stuff</p>
<p>that i saw him like last week</p>
<p>and i was talking he was talking to tommy</p>
<p>and i was like</p>
<p>i just went to go like hey</p>
<p>good you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>touch him i know you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>freaked yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll start yiping like a dog</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah yeah he&rsquo;s nuts i</p>
<p>heard he played</p>
<p>basketball at</p>
<p>ucla yeah i</p>
<p>heard he was</p>
<p>quite brilliant</p>
<p>real already is this brilliant</p>
<p>i mean i shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he may have</p>
<p>some sort of brilliant dude</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s now he&rsquo;s living like downtown</p>
<p>and the alexandria</p>
<p>hotel he just went nuts it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>schizophrenia got him</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>can tell you can have a conversation with them i have</p>
<p>brian was just talking</p>
<p>about another guy that we know that went nuts</p>
<p>yeah no that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not as personal but</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s weird how</p>
<p>if you look at the</p>
<p>comics in general there&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>part of these</p>
<p>comics that</p>
<p>they do end up losing</p>
<p>their minds they do end up</p>
<p>going through</p>
<p>huge things of</p>
<p>depression and</p>
<p>getting into hardcore</p>
<p>drama well it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy ride man the ride of</p>
<p>needing to constantly be up and on that</p>
<p>stage and constantly be</p>
<p>pumping it out and turning it on for people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>delicate balance and you have to balance out your ego</p>
<p>with your imagination</p>
<p>with your desire to please people with your desire to</p>
<p>make yourself look i mean you have to figure out</p>
<p>what the fuck you doing this for why you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>figure out why bits aren&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>gotta figure out why they&rsquo;re not liking you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of shit</p>
<p>going on it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>a lot of stress for a lot of people and</p>
<p>some of them just can&rsquo;t handle it</p>
<p>after a while</p>
<p>like the very need for it in the</p>
<p>first place usually</p>
<p>it usually signifies something went</p>
<p>wrong in their</p>
<p>childhood oh</p>
<p>absolutely i</p>
<p>would say that yeah i</p>
<p>would say that you know mine</p>
<p>dad didn&rsquo;t play ball with me that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m a comedian</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly why i need</p>
<p>the attention of people you know</p>
<p>everybody right all of us and if you ever met anybody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s any good that isn&rsquo;t like that yeah or that had a</p>
<p>great upbringing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>can identify with each other</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why we we</p>
<p>appreciate each</p>
<p>other and respect each</p>
<p>other in a way that</p>
<p>like even when i was talking</p>
<p>about mark marine</p>
<p>earlier i like mark i don&rsquo;t have a problem with mark</p>
<p>but if i saw mark in like germany</p>
<p>if i was like</p>
<p>going to the airport in germany</p>
<p>and all sudden i ran into mark i&rsquo;d be like genuinely</p>
<p>happy to see him</p>
<p>right you know i&rsquo;ll be like</p>
<p>somebody of your ignosis of my</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like one of me</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>we might be different but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re both comics like</p>
<p>there might be a thousand of us in the</p>
<p>whole country and</p>
<p>for real yeah</p>
<p>i mean if you look at</p>
<p>all the comedians in this country all the professional</p>
<p>comedians just</p>
<p>three hundred million plus people</p>
<p>and mexicans</p>
<p>okay so who knows how</p>
<p>many that really is</p>
<p>three hundred million plus people</p>
<p>and out of them</p>
<p>maybe a thousand of them are</p>
<p>professional comedians and have that thousand comedians</p>
<p>maybe how many are headliners are there</p>
<p>three hundred are there</p>
<p>five hundred</p>
<p>is there even that many</p>
<p>it is a very exclusive</p>
<p>group that&rsquo;s a nutty number man</p>
<p>500 people we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>throwing that off the top or head but i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s probably pretty accurate</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably dead</p>
<p>right about that because</p>
<p>we live in comedy cities it&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>people meet a comedian outside of la or something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like meeting an astronaut to them</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about totally</p>
<p>i hear the comedy community in indianapolis when i</p>
<p>was in indianapolis i was sure</p>
<p>some dudes that were like local</p>
<p>comics there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nice to</p>
<p>see it&rsquo;s nice to know that there&rsquo;s like a little</p>

<p>they had a little community go and he&rsquo;s like</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s always our</p>
<p>i heard he took a long time off and then</p>

<p>coming back to comedy</p>
<p>reasons coming back we were always friendly with each</p>
<p>other i still</p>
<p>am friendly with him but he&rsquo;s just a bitter bitter guy</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a real bad</p>
<p>thing in comedy</p>
<p>the worst i&rsquo;ve noticed you know i</p>
<p>seldom shit on</p>
<p>other comics</p>
<p>cause one i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>watching them</p>
<p>and two i don&rsquo;t care it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>thing is it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the carlos thing needed</p>
<p>to be addressed people shit on dane cook he&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>taken anything from me dane is not a bad person he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never taken anything from me in</p>
<p>my life but dane did</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d made some unfortunate choices and he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>super ambitious guy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a powerful</p>
<p>motivated dude</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not bad</p>
<p>he is who he is</p>
<p>like people be like like i&rsquo;ll meet</p>
<p>these guys these</p>
<p>young open mugs like screw</p>
<p>dane cook i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i was here 10 years ago</p>
<p>when that guy</p>
<p>was still grinding</p>
<p>and i have never</p>
<p>met a comedian who worked that hard</p>
<p>do you have to like us</p>
<p>county no i don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>but is he a comedian yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a comedian</p>
<p>the difference between him and man</p>
<p>steelia was so evident</p>
<p>it was a difference i&rsquo;m glad that was</p>
<p>pointed out too because like even like i</p>
<p>think when he</p>
<p>was on your show he was like look i am not him and i</p>
<p>do not deserve to be put in that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t he does not deserve</p>
<p>to be put into that no not even remotely not even close</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>with menstelja</p>
<p>too was this</p>
<p>crazy thing</p>
<p>where he would go on in</p>
<p>front of guys and do</p>
<p>their material</p>
<p>do you remember when he did that loco</p>
<p>thing and he went</p>
<p>in front of johnny sanchez and</p>
<p>he did like his closing bit before he</p>
<p>brought him up</p>
<p>and he would do that to people all the time</p>
<p>gank shit and do it in</p>
<p>front of you and it was</p>
<p>like and in your face look what i just got away with</p>
<p>right it was like some sort of</p>
<p>like badass</p>
<p>thing look at</p>
<p>this bullshit yeah it&rsquo;s a very mind fuck</p>
<p>thing remember</p>
<p>marron pointed it out he said like you know tell me</p>
<p>about your first comedy</p>
<p>experience i went and bought a book</p>
<p>yeah jokes he said and then i went and told</p>
<p>marin that was the most</p>
<p>disappointing</p>
<p>thing is one of the reasons why i mean</p>
<p>like i said i don&rsquo;t hate marin</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a good guy he&rsquo;s trying to do the</p>
<p>right thing with his life</p>
<p>but he said</p>
<p>about this messiah</p>
<p>thing that me and him on</p>
<p>stage was two bullies arguing over bullshit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like man</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s not fair</p>
<p>because i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want this to happen and the only reason it happened the</p>
<p>first place get</p>
<p>moron called me up on</p>
<p>stage he actually got on</p>
<p>stage took the</p>
<p>microphone and called me</p>
<p>up on stage</p>
<p>got on stage took it from a guy who was on</p>
<p>stage who i brought up</p>
<p>and so i was like look if you</p>
<p>wanna do this i&rsquo;ll do this like i&rsquo;m not scared of you</p>
<p>like if you</p>
<p>wanna call me out in</p>
<p>front of a room</p>
<p>full of people that i just performed for</p>
<p>and you wanna continue this okay if you have the</p>
<p>microphone okay</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t deserve to</p>
<p>have the microphone you&rsquo;re not even supposed to be on</p>
<p>stage but if you</p>
<p>wanna do that and you&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>hijacked the show i&rsquo;ll go up there and we&rsquo;ll figure out</p>
<p>where this goes</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what it was to me if it wasn&rsquo;t for brian</p>
<p>and brian&rsquo;s editing</p>
<p>skills i mean they would have</p>
<p>never even hit the air</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t even know he was in the room but it happened</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy is before that even happened</p>
<p>he knew who i was and hated me because i had</p>
<p>earlier made this</p>
<p>other carlisle monsieur</p>
<p>video that was like not</p>
<p>successful at all</p>
<p>but i had made this</p>
<p>video and he i remember he walked past me stopped</p>
<p>right next to me</p>
<p>looked at me and chicken necked me</p>
<p>and that was something like only bullies did in like</p>
<p>like elementary</p>
<p>school like when you go up to somebody</p>
<p>and you like</p>
<p>flinch your face</p>
<p>right into their face like</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>that you did that yeah</p>
<p>that was like a week away he</p>
<p>was so crazy he</p>
<p>just checked me</p>
<p>i was on the way off the</p>
<p>stage before he went on</p>
<p>stage and took the</p>
<p>microphone away from this guy</p>
<p>he stood in</p>
<p>front of me and like</p>
<p>chest checked i can&rsquo;t believe you and i was like</p>
<p>bitch are you</p>
<p>crazy of course he hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but i was like i will</p>
<p>end your life with my bare hands</p>
<p>right here you know he</p>
<p>started drinking</p>
<p>did he yeah did you know</p>
<p>that are you</p>
<p>serious he started he&rsquo;s like 40 something he just</p>
<p>started wow</p>
<p>i saw that i</p>
<p>heard this on marin&rsquo;s podcast this is the reason why</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t go back</p>
<p>to the store</p>
<p>they supported that guy they embraced that guy they</p>
<p>set the worst</p>
<p>he can still go anytime he wants</p>
<p>they set the</p>
<p>worst example ever</p>
<p>for the art and if there was one club who shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>big governing of that yeah</p>
<p>you know it was a</p>
<p>personal thing it wasn&rsquo;t it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mitsy&rsquo;s choice because i</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even before it</p>
<p>happened you</p>
<p>were doing that on behalf of all the guys he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stealing from you you&rsquo;re doing on behalf of i</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t stealing from me because i was so</p>
<p>vocal about it</p>
<p>i knew it was coming so that the reason</p>
<p>he did steal from me a</p>
<p>bunch of times in the road i got</p>
<p>where i got</p>
<p>i got calls</p>
<p>from guys who opened for him all over the country</p>
<p>i get calls</p>
<p>from guys who went to see him in houston he was</p>
<p>doing my bits</p>
<p>he was he was doing everybody shit</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just what you saw on the dvds it was</p>
<p>every fucking</p>
<p>night he performed</p>
<p>he was doing people shit</p>
<p>that exposed him that</p>
<p>night i can&rsquo;t believe i was there</p>
<p>dude it had to be</p>
<p>done right i mean it had to</p>
<p>be done but this</p>
<p>would piss me off</p>
<p>about what marin said</p>
<p>it was like it&rsquo;s two bullies arguing over bullshit like</p>
<p>look man i might be a loud dude and i might be</p>
<p>aggressive and i</p>
<p>might be you know</p>
<p>overly agro</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m not a bully</p>
<p>yeah you were</p>
<p>championing the</p>
<p>us if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a nice person i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be so nice to you yeah</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a nice guy i&rsquo;m fucking for sure nice back</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re a dickhead to me i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be a bigger dick back yeah</p>
<p>and with that guy it wasn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>a matter of a bullying</p>
<p>thing it was like we have a fucking criminal in our</p>
<p>midst and it&rsquo;s being supported by all the substructure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being supported by all the club managers</p>
<p>being supported by the</p>
<p>agents who are profiting off this guy running around</p>
<p>stealing people shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>one guy like a</p>
<p>robin williams who like occasionally</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll blurt out someone&rsquo;s material you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about a guy who&rsquo;s just straight</p>
<p>ganking people</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>it was a totally different sort of a situation if you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t there all the time like i was and you were</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t see how horrible it was</p>
<p>it was the worst</p>
<p>atmosphere for</p>
<p>creativity you</p>
<p>could ever imagine</p>
<p>where everyone was</p>
<p>worried and we used to have to</p>
<p>light the fucking</p>
<p>light up when the dude walked into the room</p>
<p>you lit that light yeah</p>
<p>how many times did you</p>
<p>light that light yeah a lot</p>
<p>i knew when he was coming he was working the fucking</p>
<p>cover booth</p>
<p>freddie was working the</p>
<p>cover booth and when</p>
<p>when mensia</p>
<p>would come in</p>
<p>guys would need that</p>
<p>light flashed for them to know that that guy was</p>
<p>in the room know that mensia was there that is so dark</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing when you can okay that with yourself to</p>
<p>steal it would make comedy</p>
<p>really well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more amazing that the clubs allowed</p>
<p>it i know it&rsquo;s not amazing that one</p>
<p>person&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s amazing is that</p>
<p>these clubs go we can make</p>
<p>money off this</p>
<p>crazy person that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>not even just</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all of us to somebody</p>
<p>should have said something more</p>
<p>about it yeah</p>
<p>it was a real</p>
<p>it was but you know what</p>
<p>everyone says</p>
<p>it like hey you did it you call them out it was a</p>
<p>total random moment</p>
<p>right didn&rsquo;t have to happen it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>planned out</p>
<p>it was just</p>
<p>he he what he did is he played on my ego you know</p>
<p>you deserve the balls get up here</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if it was suicide by comp i don&rsquo;t know what it was</p>
<p>it might have been</p>
<p>because he had to know this is</p>
<p>gonna end ugly</p>
<p>right what are you</p>
<p>gonna do you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna intimidate me what are you</p>
<p>gonna do are you</p>
<p>gonna be wrong but</p>
<p>he was so confident this is how i knew he was</p>
<p>crazy when i went on</p>
<p>stage he was so confident</p>
<p>you know what the fuck have i ever</p>
<p>stole when he was saying that to me</p>
<p>he was so confident i was like oh my god am i crazy</p>
<p>yeah did i make all this</p>
<p>sounds good at it if i hater had my</p>
<p>whole philosophy</p>
<p>of him just be had been formed by my own jealousy</p>
<p>so then i started naming bits</p>
<p>and then as i was naming bits i just</p>
<p>watched him fall</p>
<p>apart i just</p>
<p>watched him in the store</p>
<p>his eyes were</p>
<p>cracked like</p>
<p>glass was shattering in his eyes and like the lens</p>
<p>it was seeing the</p>
<p>sunlight coming in and killing the vampire</p>
<p>and then he sat down on the</p>
<p>stool and then it became ugly</p>
<p>and then it</p>
<p>became the audience turned on him and then</p>
<p>at the end the</p>
<p>crazy thing was</p>
<p>after i got off</p>
<p>stage it was like a half an hour be raiding him</p>
<p>and just exposing what he does and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with what he does and you&rsquo;re not an artist</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a fucking</p>
<p>minor bird and you repeat</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>other people say</p>
<p>and you do what you take credit for</p>
<p>their work you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>understand what comedy is</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>understand the fucking language because you</p>
<p>never learned it because you just repeat what</p>
<p>other people say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a person</p>
<p>speaking a language you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand literally</p>
<p>the audience is</p>
<p>going crazy</p>
<p>this asshole so nuts he wants to</p>
<p>perform after this right</p>
<p>he went on to you remember that</p>
<p>i remember he</p>
<p>tried to do comedy comedy</p>
<p>yeah it for like ten minutes</p>
<p>i actually have lost footage that way</p>
<p>people were going</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s doing a set and he kept going</p>
<p>and then when he walked out</p>
<p>it was like the end of friday or something like devo</p>
<p>just got beat up and everybody was getting</p>
<p>their kicks</p>
<p>that dude look</p>
<p>you carlos everybody</p>
<p>did and then</p>
<p>and then when i got the boot man he</p>
<p>came back around on everybody yeah oh yeah he pulled me</p>
<p>that to me man</p>
<p>he pulled me to run is easy</p>
<p>aside he&rsquo;s like bro</p>
<p>wow it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what do you want you know and then me and</p>
<p>steve asked him honestly we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>then tell us</p>
<p>about this bed tell us</p>
<p>about that but just like with marin he has</p>
<p>they should</p>
<p>have the comedy</p>
<p>store should have</p>
<p>the comedy store should</p>
<p>have comedy</p>
<p>shore freud</p>
<p>hello freud</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be after mitzi</p>
<p>dies paul is</p>
<p>gonna rename it</p>
<p>the what they</p>
<p>should have done is they</p>
<p>should have stepped in</p>
<p>and even if they wanted to keep me banned</p>
<p>because i was filming</p>
<p>there and they don&rsquo;t want me filming that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>but you got to make sure you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have him headlined the next weekend</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get on stage</p>
<p>and say this is my guy i&rsquo;m with carlos</p>
<p>which is what he did</p>
<p>what they did was support the worst</p>
<p>vampire in the business</p>
<p>and let everybody feel helpless</p>
<p>and let everybody know that even though you are</p>
<p>successful and you do have</p>
<p>things going on you can</p>
<p>still get your life fucked with</p>
<p>by somebody who&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>successful right</p>
<p>and you can see that there</p>
<p>are people that really do try to sabotage your career</p>
<p>if you expose someone for being a</p>
<p>piece of shit and a thief</p>
<p>and someone who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>direct indirect</p>
<p>opposition of</p>
<p>what this art form is supposed to be all about</p>
<p>which is you creating and forming your own shed and</p>
<p>bring it out on</p>
<p>stage and people appreciating your work</p>
<p>that you ever talk</p>
<p>after that you were with gersh at the time weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you yeah i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still friends with</p>
<p>my agent at the time i don&rsquo;t even want to mention</p>
<p>his name because he&rsquo;s a good guy yeah fucked up</p>
<p>and he got in a bad situation and</p>
<p>they made him choose the agency made him choose between</p>
<p>carlos and me</p>
<p>and they only had me for</p>
<p>stand up comedy they had him for</p>
<p>stand up comedy and</p>
<p>television and film</p>
<p>and so they were making more money off</p>
<p>him than i was and</p>
<p>they wanted me to either apologize to him or they were</p>
<p>gonna have to let me go did you guys ever talk again</p>
<p>i ran into him</p>

<p>agents no that&rsquo;s what i meant no</p>
<p>have you ever seen</p>
