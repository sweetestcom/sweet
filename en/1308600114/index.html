    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today is an Ask Me Anything, or AMA episode,</p>
<p>which is part of our premium subscriber content.</p>
<p>Our premium channel was launched</p>
<p>in order to raise support</p>
<p>for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,</p>
<p>which still comes out once a week, every Monday,</p>
<p>and of course is zero cost to consumer.</p>
<p>The premium channel is also designed</p>
<p>to support exciting research being done</p>
<p>at major universities like Stanford and elsewhere,</p>
<p>research that&rsquo;s done on humans</p>
<p>that should lead to protocols for mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance in the near future.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to check out</p>
<p>the premium channel subscription model,</p>
<p>you can go to hubermanlab.com slash premium,</p>
<p>and there you can subscribe for $10 a month</p>
<p>or $100 a year.</p>
<p>We also have a lifetime subscriber option.</p>
<p>For those of you that are already</p>
<p>Huberman Lab Podcast premium subscribers</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re watching and or hearing this,</p>
<p>please go to hubermanlab.com slash premium</p>
<p>and download the premium podcast feed.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are not already</p>
<p>Huberman Lab premium podcast subscribers,</p>
<p>you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so</p>
<p>of this episode,</p>
<p>and hopefully that will allow you to discern</p>
<p>whether or not you would like to become</p>
<p>a premium subscriber.</p>
<p>Without further ado,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get to answering your questions.</p>
<p>And as always,</p>
<p>I will strive to be as accurate as possible,</p>
<p>as thorough as possible,</p>
<p>and yet as concise as possible.</p>
<p>The first question today is about adaptogens.</p>
<p>Some of you may have heard of adaptogens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing many of you have not heard of adaptogens.</p>
<p>The strict definition of adaptogens is still evolving,</p>
<p>meaning no one really knows what adaptogens mean</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s included in adaptogens</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s excluded from adaptogens.</p>
<p>But the most common definition of an adaptogen</p>
<p>is a compound that is typically a supplement or a drug,</p>
<p>although it could be a behavior,</p>
<p>if you really think about it,</p>
<p>that helps you adapt to and buffer stress.</p>
<p>So when you hear about adaptogens,</p>
<p>there are three main categories of adaptogens</p>
<p>that come to mind.</p>
<p>The first are things that are contained in food.</p>
<p>So these would be vitamins or micronutrients</p>
<p>that one could easily find in food,</p>
<p>but one would have to consume a fairly restricted number</p>
<p>or type of foods in order to obtain those things,</p>
<p>or consume a lot of those foods</p>
<p>in order to get sufficient dosages</p>
<p>of those adaptogen compounds in order to buffer stress.</p>
<p>Some good examples of these would be any kind of vitamin,</p>
<p>either water-soluble or fat-soluble,</p>
<p>that can adjust or reduce</p>
<p>what are so-called reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s what gives rise to this idea</p>
<p>that antioxidants are good for us.</p>
<p>Now, over the last 10 years or so, there&rsquo;s been a shift.</p>
<p>What shift has occurred?</p>
<p>Well, about 10 years ago,</p>
<p>you often heard about antioxidants,</p>
<p>antioxidants, antioxidants and vitamins,</p>
<p>antioxidants in this food, this superfood, et cetera.</p>
<p>And why were people talking about antioxidants?</p>
<p>Well, just to remind you,</p>
<p>reactive oxygen species are types of reactions</p>
<p>and molecules that occur in cells</p>
<p>when cells get stressed and or age,</p>
<p>and antioxidants are the compounds</p>
<p>that reduce those reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>Reactive oxygen species are bad for cells</p>
<p>because they tend to hinder the function of mitochondria,</p>
<p>which are associated with energy production</p>
<p>in those cells.</p>
<p>So what do we know for sure?</p>
<p>We know that as cells get older</p>
<p>or as any cell or biological system,</p>
<p>organ, tissue, et cetera,</p>
<p>get stressed a lot over time,</p>
<p>the number of reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>increases in those cells and tissues and organs,</p>
<p>and antioxidants, which can include certain vitamins,</p>
<p>but also some micronutrients,</p>
<p>are effective in reducing those reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s occurred over the last 10 years</p>
<p>is that we know that reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>are a major source of depleting cellular function</p>
<p>by way of depleting mitochondrial function,</p>
<p>but they are just one of many mechanisms</p>
<p>that can deplete cellular function, mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>So nowadays you&rsquo;ll hear about reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>and antioxidants, but not as much as you used to.</p>
<p>Now you hear a lot more about inflammatory responses</p>
<p>and inflammatory cytokines also being an issue.</p>
<p>And the truth is all of these things are an issue.</p>
<p>So going back to this question about adaptogens,</p>
<p>adaptogens include these three categories.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve told you the first,</p>
<p>which are the vitamins and micronutrients</p>
<p>that are contained in food</p>
<p>that can reduce reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>and other aspects of cellular stress,</p>
<p>such as inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>What are some of those things that occur in foods?</p>
<p>Well, in order to answer that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just think about what sorts of foods themselves</p>
<p>can act as adaptogens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s commonly held that the dark leafy greens type foods,</p>
<p>for those of you that eat plants,</p>
<p>and I think the majority of people out there do eat plants.</p>
<p>I know that the carnivore diet and lion diet</p>
<p>and some other diets tend to exclude plants.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll address that briefly at some point</p>
<p>in today&rsquo;s discussion, but dark leafy greens</p>
<p>are known to contain a number of compounds</p>
<p>in the form of vitamins and micronutrients</p>
<p>that are very effective in reducing reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>and inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s interested in adaptogens</p>
<p>and adaptogenic processes,</p>
<p>reducing stress and buffering stress,</p>
<p>which of course has its role in buffering daily stress</p>
<p>in order to help you sleep better,</p>
<p>to improve cellular function for longevity,</p>
<p>sports performance, cognitive performance,</p>
<p>that is all good and it makes sense</p>
<p>why people would be interested in adaptogens.</p>
<p>But remember that the two main adaptogens</p>
<p>that you should think to first</p>
<p>are going to be behaviors and nutrition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started with nutrition on purpose.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, we&rsquo;ll get to behaviors in a moment.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in adaptogens at all,</p>
<p>I highly recommend that you include</p>
<p>at least two to four servings of dark leafy greens</p>
<p>and or cruciferous vegetables per day.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;d be highly advantageous.</p>
<p>And just be aware that excessively heating</p>
<p>dark leafy greens or cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>can actually destroy the very nutrients and micronutrients</p>
<p>that act in an adaptogenic way.</p>
<p>That does not mean that you need to eat raw broccoli</p>
<p>or cauliflower.</p>
<p>Just the thought of that makes me nauseous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to digest.</p>
<p>Some people might like that</p>
<p>or can digest it more easily than others.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to cook your cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>and dark leafy greens, but you don&rsquo;t want to overcook them.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s overcooking and what&rsquo;s undercooking,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no strict cutoff in terms of temperature.</p>
<p>But basically what the literature says</p>
<p>is that if you heat vegetables to the point</p>
<p>where the colored fluid is leaching out of them</p>
<p>into a broth type, into water</p>
<p>or whatever fluid surrounds them,</p>
<p>well, then you would be well off to ingest that fluid</p>
<p>as well because it contained in the water</p>
<p>or the fluid that&rsquo;s leaching out</p>
<p>from the cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>or from the dark leafy greens</p>
<p>are going to be a lot of those very adaptogenic molecules</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re interested in in the first place.</p>
<p>Okay, so I probably surprised some people</p>
<p>by starting off my answer to the question</p>
<p>of what are adaptogens?</p>
<p>Are they worth thinking about and pursuing?</p>
<p>And if so, how can I get them?</p>
<p>By talking about food.</p>
<p>But I think it is important to understand</p>
<p>that you can get a lot of adaptogens from food.</p>
<p>And indeed, some of the best adaptogens</p>
<p>do come from dark leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention that.</p>
<p>The other two categories of adaptogens</p>
<p>are going to be supplement-based adaptogens</p>
<p>and then behavioral adaptogens.</p>
<p>Again, here adaptogen defined as anything</p>
<p>that can buffer stress in a substantial or meaningful way</p>
<p>in order to support cellular health, organ health</p>
<p>and overall daily living and functioning,</p>
<p>including sleep and performance and mental health.</p>
<p>So the second category of adaptogens</p>
<p>are going to be supplements.</p>
<p>And here again, I just want to take a step back</p>
<p>and make sure that we are clear</p>
<p>about our operational definition</p>
<p>about what a supplement is.</p>
<p>We had an episode all about</p>
<p>how to design a rational guide to supplementation,</p>
<p>which included, for example, the idea that for some people,</p>
<p>the optimal dosage of many supplements is going to be zero.</p>
<p>And for other people, the dosage will be something else.</p>
<p>But to really pinpoint the key message from that episode</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to reiterate now,</p>
<p>but a key message from that episode</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to reiterate now</p>
<p>is that many people think of supplements</p>
<p>as just vitamin supplements.</p>
<p>And for that reason, you&rsquo;ll often hear the argument,</p>
<p>oh, well, aren&rsquo;t supplements just expensive urine?</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t you get all of that from food?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you just urinating out</p>
<p>all the water-soluble vitamins</p>
<p>and maybe even storing excess amounts</p>
<p>of the fat-soluble vitamins in a way that&rsquo;s unhealthy</p>
<p>or not cost-effective and so on?</p>
<p>When we talk about supplements,</p>
<p>yes, it can include vitamin supplements.</p>
<p>However, there are many compounds</p>
<p>that we would describe as supplements</p>
<p>that are not vitamin supplements</p>
<p>and that you could not obtain from food</p>
<p>or that you could never obtain from food</p>
<p>in sufficient enough qualities</p>
<p>to have a robust positive biological effect</p>
<p>without consuming an enormous number of calories</p>
<p>or overriding your gut mechanically.</p>
<p>For instance, if there were, say, a herb,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about such herbs in a moment,</p>
<p>that contained an effective adaptogen,</p>
<p>but you would never want to eat the plant itself</p>
<p>or include that herb in any kind of recipe,</p>
<p>well, then chances are this herb,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll define in a moment,</p>
<p>is not a vitamin supplement.</p>
<p>It is probably not even best thought of as a supplement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best thought of as a compound</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sold over the counter,</p>
<p>much like a prescription drug,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not prescription.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t require a prescription to get it.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of things like that</p>
<p>that we include under the umbrella of this word supplements.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, because of that,</p>
<p>a lot of people think, oh, you don&rsquo;t need supplements.</p>
<p>And of course, you don&rsquo;t need supplements per se,</p>
<p>but many people do derive tremendous benefit from them.</p>
<p>In the context of adaptogens,</p>
<p>there are two or three in particular</p>
<p>that can be very beneficial</p>
<p>for buffering the stress response,</p>
<p>especially over short periods of time</p>
<p>of about two to three weeks.</p>
<p>So when would you use these?</p>
<p>Well, for instance,</p>
<p>if you are in a particularly stressful mode of life,</p>
<p>either because of family or relational or school</p>
<p>or work demands or new kid in the house</p>
<p>or any number of different things,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve been ill or you&rsquo;re recovering from injury,</p>
<p>taking an adaptogen in the form of supplement</p>
<p>can actually be very useful for buffering this hormone</p>
<p>and the general systems it&rsquo;s associated with</p>
<p>called cortisol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very healthy to have high levels of cortisol</p>
<p>early in the day, shortly after you wake up,</p>
<p>and then that ought to taper off</p>
<p>toward the afternoon and evening.</p>
<p>However, if cortisol is chronically elevated</p>
<p>throughout the day,</p>
<p>or if that peak in cortisol is arriving too late in the day,</p>
<p>that is known to be associated with mental health</p>
<p>and physical health issues</p>
<p>as has been shown by labs at Stanford and elsewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been shown in animal models</p>
<p>and in humans.</p>
<p>Talked many times before,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just remind you again,</p>
<p>that one of the best ways to restrict that cortisol peak</p>
<p>to the early part of the day</p>
<p>is to get morning sunlight in your eyes as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Once the sun is up,</p>
<p>get outside facing the direction of the sun,</p>
<p>even on overcast days, don&rsquo;t wear sunglasses,</p>
<p>look at it for five to 30 minutes,</p>
<p>definitely blink so you don&rsquo;t damage your eyes,</p>
<p>so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Why five minutes or 30 minutes?</p>
<p>Well, five minutes on a clear day should be sufficient,</p>
<p>longer would be fine.</p>
<p>Again, blink so that you protect your eyes,</p>
<p>blink as needed,</p>
<p>face in the general direction of the sun.</p>
<p>On days when you have a lot of overcast</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s really dark, dense cloud cover,</p>
<p>well, then you&rsquo;d want to be outside longer.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have access to sunlight</p>
<p>for whatever reason,</p>
<p>then you want to do the same thing</p>
<p>with bright artificial lights indoors,</p>
<p>either so-called sad lamp or otherwise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great way to restrict that cortisol peak</p>
<p>to early in the day.</p>
<p>But even if you&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>if you have a stressful life for whatever reason,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re getting that morning sunlight,</p>
<p>which I hope you are,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting your exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to sleep better</p>
<p>and more as we all should most of the time,</p>
<p>well, then you may be somebody</p>
<p>who wants to take a adaptogen in the form of a supplement.</p>
<p>And the three supplements that can be very effective</p>
<p>in buffering cortisol are ashwagandha,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll talk about first,</p>
<p>lion&rsquo;s mane and chaga.</p>
<p>Lion&rsquo;s mane and chaga are in the fungi group,</p>
<p>so they count as mushrooms,</p>
<p>they are not psychedelic mushrooms.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about ashwagandha first.</p>
<p>Ashwagandha is at the top of the list</p>
<p>because it is indeed a very potent adaptogen.</p>
<p>How can I say that?</p>
<p>Well, there are a number of studies now,</p>
<p>including several excellent ones in humans</p>
<p>that report that taking two doses</p>
<p>of 300 milligrams of ashwagandha per day</p>
<p>can very dramatically buffer cortisol.</p>
<p>So this is something that you would have</p>
<p>a near impossible time accessing from food.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine that unless you&rsquo;re cooking</p>
<p>with the very sources of ashwagandha</p>
<p>and extracting exact amounts</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d be able to get this in any other form</p>
<p>except supplement form.</p>
<p>So here, I&rsquo;m going to just briefly reference a paper</p>
<p>and we can provide a reference link to this.</p>
<p>That is, this is a paper from 2012</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s had a lot of excellent follow-up papers</p>
<p>that support it.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>A Prospective Randomized Double-Blind</p>
<p>Placebo-Controlled Study of Safety and Efficacy</p>
<p>of High Concentration of Full-Spectrum Extract</p>
<p>of Ashwagandha Root in Reducing Stress and Anxiety</p>
<p>in Adults.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really nice study,</p>
<p>not a huge subject pool, but both men and women,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s carried out for long enough</p>
<p>that they got to see some really interesting results.</p>
<p>And I think that the most interesting result</p>
<p>is that taking 300 milligrams of ashwagandha twice a day</p>
<p>led to enormous, I mean,</p>
<p>just enormous changes in serum cortisol.</p>
<p>The statistical significance that they observed</p>
<p>in the study was really fantastic,</p>
<p>fantastically high statistical significance.</p>
<p>They saw the effects of ashwagandha on day 15,</p>
<p>having initiated the ashwagandha consumption on day one,</p>
<p>of course, day 30 and day 45.</p>
<p>And again, this was dramatic reductions in stress</p>
<p>as perceived by people,</p>
<p>so subjective stress and cortisol level.</p>
<p>So ashwagandha is very potent at reducing cortisol.</p>
<p>How would you recapitulate this</p>
<p>if you wanted to use ashwagandha to buffer stress?</p>
<p>Well, a couple of key points.</p>
<p>Mentioned earlier that you want your cortisol peak</p>
<p>to come earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Therefore, you would not want to buffer cortisol</p>
<p>early in the day.</p>
<p>In fact, cortisol peaking early in the day</p>
<p>provides an anti-inflammatory, immune-supporting,</p>
<p>focus and mood-supporting effect all day long.</p>
<p>So I would recommend that people take their first dose</p>
<p>of ashwagandha of anywhere from 250 to 300 milligrams</p>
<p>sometime in the early afternoon,</p>
<p>and then again in the evening,</p>
<p>as opposed to taking a morning dose and an afternoon dose.</p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s exercising</p>
<p>for sake of trying to induce adaptations like hypertrophy,</p>
<p>the growth of muscles, or strength,</p>
<p>or improve your endurance in any way, muscular endurance,</p>
<p>or more traditional cardiovascular endurance,</p>
<p>then I recommend that you not take your ashwagandha</p>
<p>prior to exercise,</p>
<p>because part of the adaptation response</p>
<p>is triggered by increases in cortisol during exercise,</p>
<p>in the same way that some of the best adaptations</p>
<p>to exercise are reductions in blood pressure</p>
<p>and resting heart rate,</p>
<p>and those are stimulated by increases in blood pressure</p>
<p>and increases in heart rate during exercise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just how these biological systems work.</p>
<p>So the takeaway is pretty simple.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in using ashwagandha as an adaptogen,</p>
<p>I would restrict it to later in the day if you can,</p>
<p>and not before exercise.</p>
<p>Divide it into two doses of 250 to 300 milligrams.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what this paper and other papers like it</p>
<p>seem to indicate.</p>
<p>And then a very important final point about ashwagandha,</p>
<p>which is that if you&rsquo;re going to take ashwagandha,</p>
<p>I recommend not taking it for longer than a month and a half</p>
<p>as they did in this study.</p>
<p>In fact, I would suggest that you only take ashwagandha</p>
<p>around periods of kind of moderate to extreme stress.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s moderate, what&rsquo;s extreme</p>
<p>is going to depend on what you&rsquo;re going through.</p>
<p>Only you know how much stress</p>
<p>and life events you can tolerate.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve had trouble sleeping,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s unusual for you,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re dealing with a very difficult life circumstances,</p>
<p>or excessive work demand, or a new kid,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>well, then buffering stress with ashwagandha,</p>
<p>buffering cortisol in the afternoon and evening</p>
<p>can be very beneficial for you.</p>
<p>But then I would say after about 30 days maximum,</p>
<p>I would take at least two to four weeks off.</p>
<p>Two weeks is probably enough, but four weeks off,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to chronically buffer cortisol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not a good idea.</p>
<p>But that said,</p>
<p>I think ashwagandha is a very powerful adaptogen.</p>
<p>I would place at the top of the list</p>
<p>of supplement-based adaptogens.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re taking a supplement-based adaptogen,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s no reason to abandon the nutrition</p>
<p>and behavioral type adaptogenic effects</p>
<p>that you can create through eating dark leafy greens,</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll talk about the behaviors in a moment.</p>
<p>The other two supplement-based adaptogens, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>are lion&rsquo;s mane mushroom and chaga.</p>
<p>And I get asked a lot about lion&rsquo;s mane and chaga</p>
<p>for sake of their purported roles</p>
<p>in acting as nootropics, as quote-unquote smart drugs.</p>
<p>There are fewer data on the beneficial roles</p>
<p>of lion&rsquo;s mane and chaga for sake of nootropic effects.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do an entire episode on nootropics at some point.</p>
<p>But there have been a few studies</p>
<p>showing that lion&rsquo;s mane and supplementation</p>
<p>and chaga supplementation can improve memory</p>
<p>and maybe even divergent thinking</p>
<p>associated with creativity and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Again, these are not psychedelic mushrooms.</p>
<p>That said, there are good data showing</p>
<p>that 1,000 milligrams,</p>
<p>that is one gram of lion&rsquo;s mane per day,</p>
<p>and or, okay, these,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about the and or portion in a moment,</p>
<p>and or chaga mushroom at 500 to 1,500 milligrams per day</p>
<p>can act as adaptogens in, again, reducing cortisol,</p>
<p>but also, and mainly,</p>
<p>reducing some of the anti-inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>that are known to circulate in high abundance</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re under a lot of psychological</p>
<p>and or physical stress,</p>
<p>things like interleukin-6 and some related molecules.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I would recommend.</p>
<p>If you are interested in exploring adaptogens,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan, as some of you probably know</p>
<p>if you heard that episode</p>
<p>on rational guide to supplementation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of mainly focusing on taking supplements</p>
<p>in single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>so that you can figure out what dosages are best for you</p>
<p>and so that you can toggle in and out</p>
<p>those adaptogens as needed.</p>
<p>So I, of course, am a fan of taking certain blends</p>
<p>and mixes.</p>
<p>The one that we talk about a lot on this podcast,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been a sponsor from the beginning,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken for a decade now,</p>
<p>long before I ever had a podcast,</p>
<p>is athletic greens,</p>
<p>which some of you might note does contain some ashwagandha,</p>
<p>although the levels of ashwagandha</p>
<p>that are contained in athletic greens are low enough</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t see any issue</p>
<p>with taking athletic greens consistently</p>
<p>day to day, every day,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not getting anywhere near</p>
<p>that 600 milligram dosage.</p>
<p>But the idea is that if you were going to take</p>
<p>any adaptogen for sake of buffering stress</p>
<p>over the short term,</p>
<p>say for a week or two weeks or a month,</p>
<p>and then taking that recommended time off,</p>
<p>I would start with ashwagandha.</p>
<p>And then if you feel you need something else</p>
<p>to buffer stress,</p>
<p>keeping in mind, of course,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing the behavioral</p>
<p>and the nutritional things to buffer stress as well,</p>
<p>you can never abandon those, right?</p>
<p>Well, then I would suggest adding 1,000 milligrams</p>
<p>or 1,000 milligrams of chaga per day</p>
<p>and seeing how that further benefits your system</p>
<p>in terms of buffering stress.</p>
<p>How would you measure if your stress is being reduced?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re going to be sleeping better at night,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel subjectively better,</p>
<p>lower levels of anxiety,</p>
<p>all the things that are measured</p>
<p>in the types of studies I described before.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there&rsquo;s nothing preventing you</p>
<p>from taking 600 milligrams of ashwagandha,</p>
<p>a gram of lion&rsquo;s mane and a gram of chaga,</p>
<p>I know some people like to just kind of go</p>
<p>full tilt into everything,</p>
<p>but I am a big believer in really trying to isolate</p>
<p>which supplements and molecules work best for you</p>
<p>and which ones don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Do you need to cycle on and off lion&rsquo;s mane and chaga?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any data showing that you do.</p>
<p>If however, you&rsquo;re taking them every day,</p>
<p>I recommend that you cycle off them</p>
<p>after a period of 30 days or so.</p>
<p>And I want to be very clear about this,</p>
<p>just because I said cycle off</p>
<p>after a period of 30 days or so</p>
<p>does not mean that you can&rsquo;t take them</p>
<p>for a shorter period of time.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you know that you&rsquo;re coming up</p>
<p>on a big week of stress,</p>
<p>well, then you could take ashwagandha</p>
<p>and or lion&rsquo;s mane and or chaga for that week</p>
<p>or just that week or heading into that week</p>
<p>or in the following week and then stop.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why you couldn&rsquo;t take them</p>
<p>even just for one day,</p>
<p>although the effects tend to be a bit cumulative,</p>
<p>at least when we&rsquo;re talking about buffering anxiety.</p>
<p>In terms of buffering cortisol,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very potent effect that as far as we know</p>
<p>is going to take place on day one.</p>
<p>Again, keep that cortisol buffering effect</p>
<p>away from exercise,</p>
<p>at least don&rsquo;t take it before exercise</p>
<p>and try and buffer your cortisol</p>
<p>in the afternoon and evening.</p>
<p>And this is assuming that you&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>a conventional shift and you&rsquo;re not up all night</p>
<p>and sleeping all day for sake of shift work.</p>
<p>Okay, so hopefully that clarifies things</p>
<p>about what adaptogens are.</p>
<p>In fact, I never actually read the specific question,</p>
<p>but I think I&rsquo;ve touched on a number of issues</p>
<p>that were laid to this specific question.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll answer the last portion</p>
<p>of the answer to this question in a moment</p>
<p>as it relates to behavioral tools</p>
<p>that can act as adaptogens.</p>
<p>The question itself was there&rsquo;s a lot of mixed information</p>
<p>out there about adaptogens like ashwagandha.</p>
<p>And I think that relates to what I said earlier,</p>
<p>which is that the definition of an adaptogen</p>
<p>has not really been cemented in various communities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different in different communities</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s generally used as a matter of convenience</p>
<p>rather than really strictly defining what it is.</p>
<p>And hopefully we&rsquo;ve defined it accurately</p>
<p>and broadly enough today as something that buffers stress.</p>
<p>The second part of the question was,</p>
<p>what does the scientific evidence say about adaptogens</p>
<p>and their ability to mediate body stress response?</p>
<p>They say quite a lot and they say that</p>
<p>the stress response can be buffered substantially</p>
<p>by certain adaptogens, mainly dark leafy greens,</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables, ashwagandha, lion&rsquo;s mane, and chaga.</p>
<p>And of course, all the behavioral things</p>
<p>that are critical that we&rsquo;ll list off in a moment.</p>
<p>And then the third portion of the question is,</p>
<p>is there any solid evidence that has an effect</p>
<p>on neurotransmitters or the HPA,</p>
<p>which is part of the stress modulation axis?</p>
<p>The best evidence is that adaptogens</p>
<p>can reduce cortisol itself.</p>
<p>There is very little evidence that adaptogens</p>
<p>can directly modulate neurotransmitters or neuromodulators</p>
<p>like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera.</p>
<p>But by adjusting the timing and levels of cortisol,</p>
<p>especially in the afternoon and evening,</p>
<p>that is going to have indirect effects</p>
<p>on levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, et cetera,</p>
<p>and serotonin, but not direct effects.</p>
<p>So the general contour that makes</p>
<p>for an ideal diurnal schedule,</p>
<p>you heard of nocturnal, well, the opposite is diurnal,</p>
<p>being awake during the daytime and asleep at night.</p>
<p>The ideal kind of landscape of neurotransmitters</p>
<p>is higher levels of dopamine, norepinephrine,</p>
<p>and epinephrine in the early part of the day,</p>
<p>and cortisol, so-called catecholamines,</p>
<p>dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine,</p>
<p>and high levels of cortisol early in the day</p>
<p>as directed by sunlight, exercise, caffeine,</p>
<p>hydration, movement, all that stuff,</p>
<p>being awake and busy and outside</p>
<p>or indoors with bright lights and moving about</p>
<p>in the early part of the day and into the early afternoon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best possible way that we are aware of</p>
<p>to try and get those catecholamines released</p>
<p>at the highest levels in the early part of the day.</p>
<p>And then the ideal contour of a 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>will be in the later half of the day,</p>
<p>the evening and nighttime.</p>
<p>You have higher levels of things like serotonin,</p>
<p>the GABAergic system, all the things</p>
<p>that are somewhat sedative in preparing you for sleep,</p>
<p>and lower levels of the catecholamines and cortisol</p>
<p>as I described before.</p>
<p>So to directly answer the question,</p>
<p>is there any evidence that adaptogens</p>
<p>can alter your neurotransmitters?</p>
<p>Yes, but only indirectly.</p>
<p>And yet that indirect control over neurotransmitters</p>
<p>is substantial and is important.</p>
<p>And if you do what I described,</p>
<p>such as getting morning sunlight,</p>
<p>and ideally you&rsquo;d get a little bit</p>
<p>of deliberate cold water exposure, by the way,</p>
<p>to boost adrenaline and norepinephrine and dopamine,</p>
<p>those catecholamines, early in the day.</p>
<p>So quick one-minute cold shower even,</p>
<p>or three-minute cold shower,</p>
<p>or if you have access to an ice bath early in the day,</p>
<p>plus some sunlight, doesn&rsquo;t matter which one you do first.</p>
<p>Doing that early in the day is really going to create</p>
<p>that peak of cortisol, dopamine, epinephrine</p>
<p>early in the day.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize how beneficial all of that can be.</p>
<p>And exercise, if you can, early in the day.</p>
<p>Some people can&rsquo;t exercise till later in the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather see people exercise later in the day</p>
<p>than not at all, provided it does not disrupt</p>
<p>their nighttime sleep, which of course,</p>
<p>sleep is the foundation of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>So yes, there&rsquo;s modulation of neurotransmitters,</p>
<p>but most of those are downstream of the effects</p>
<p>on cortisol that we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve defined nutritional adaptogens,</p>
<p>supplement-based adaptogens, although I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>like the word supplements anymore,</p>
<p>unless we&rsquo;re talking about vitamin supplements,</p>
<p>for reasons we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the third category of adaptogens,</p>
<p>which are the behavioral tools that you can use</p>
<p>to buffer stress, which qualifies those as an adaptogen.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>that we always keep in mind</p>
<p>that yes, there are supplements.</p>
<p>Yes, there are prescription drugs out there.</p>
<p>In fact, there are prescription drugs</p>
<p>that you can get from a doctor</p>
<p>that will potently zero out your cortisol.</p>
<p>But most doctors are very reluctant</p>
<p>to prescribe those drugs because cortisol provides</p>
<p>a very important and functional role early in the day.</p>
<p>Behaviors are very effective at reducing cortisol.</p>
<p>What are the most effective behaviors to reduce cortisol?</p>
<p>Well, we talked about, one, to restrict cortisol</p>
<p>the early part of the day,</p>
<p>which is viewing morning sunlight.</p>
<p>But how would you buffer cortisol in the late afternoon?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be all the things associated</p>
<p>with reducing stress.</p>
<p>For instance, 10 minutes, or even my laboratory</p>
<p>and other laboratories have shown,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even five minutes a day of just</p>
<p>what would be called mindfulness meditation.</p>
<p>Very simple.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to overcomplicate this.</p>
<p>You could use a great app like the Waking Up app</p>
<p>or another app of that sort, or you can simply sit down,</p>
<p>eyes closed, breathe through your nose,</p>
<p>and just concentrate on your breathing.</p>
<p>Every time your mind drifts to something else,</p>
<p>bring it back to your breathing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s shown to reduce stress.</p>
<p>You could do a five-minute deliberate breath work practice.</p>
<p>My laboratory has published some work related to that.</p>
<p>The breath work practice could be any number of things.</p>
<p>The two that I recommend the most would be double inhale,</p>
<p>followed by a full exhale,</p>
<p>and then repeat for a period of five minutes.</p>
<p>Known to substantially reduce anxiety, stress,</p>
<p>and the various physiological systems</p>
<p>associated with arousal.</p>
<p>You could also use box breathing.</p>
<p>Inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal durations</p>
<p>for a period of five minutes.</p>
<p>Will substantially reduce stress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan, as many of you know, of yoga nidra,</p>
<p>which involves no movement.</p>
<p>It involves just lying there, listening to a script.</p>
<p>Lots of yoga nidra scripts available online.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not interested in the intentions</p>
<p>and other things, including yoga nidra,</p>
<p>you can buffer stress using an adaptogen like NSDR,</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in trying these sorts of things,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a NSDR protocol that&rsquo;s 10 minutes long.</p>
<p>I just put my name, Huberman,</p>
<p>and NSDR into the search browser on YouTube,</p>
<p>and Virtusan has provided an NSDR</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely zero cost</p>
<p>and works very well for reducing stress.</p>
<p>It will also help teach your system</p>
<p>and teach you how to learn to fall asleep better at night.</p>
<p>So any of those practices,</p>
<p>five to 10 minute breathing practice or meditation</p>
<p>or a NSDR or yoga nidra.</p>
<p>If you can do longer, 20 or 30 minutes in the afternoon,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s known to buffer cortisol substantially as well.</p>
<p>Anytime you&rsquo;re encountering stress in real time,</p>
<p>I highly recommend a tool over and over</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so effective.</p>
<p>The fastest way we know to buffer stress and calm down</p>
<p>is the so-called physiological sigh.</p>
<p>Big inhale through the nose till your lungs are empty,</p>
<p>but then sneak in a little bit more air</p>
<p>by a second inhale,</p>
<p>maximally inflate the lungs,</p>
<p>then a long exhale until your lungs are empty.</p>
<p>One to three of those</p>
<p>will reduce your stress substantially.</p>
<p>Over time that should reduce,</p>
<p>that is buffer your cortisol acting as an adaptogen.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things.</p>
<p>You can take a hot bath.</p>
<p>You can take a hot shower.</p>
<p>You can listen to some pleasant music.</p>
<p>Anything that reduces your stress</p>
<p>technically is an adaptogen.</p>
<p>So I hope I&rsquo;ve thoroughly answered your question.</p>
<p>By yours, I mean,</p>
<p>of course this answer is going out to all of you.</p>
<p>This was a question that was asked by Justine Bevilacqua.</p>
<p>I hope I pronounced that correctly, Justine.</p>
<p>And thank you for that question.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of people interested in adaptogens.</p>
<p>So now you know you can use nutrition</p>
<p>such as cruciferous vegetables, dark leafy greens.</p>
<p>And I should also mention</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not ingesting enough calories each day,</p>
<p>well then you are going to be in a mild mode of stress.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that some people</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t take in fewer calories than they burn</p>
<p>in order to lose weight.</p>
<p>Some people really need to do that for their health</p>
<p>or for whatever other reason.</p>
<p>But if you restrict calories too much,</p>
<p>you are going to increase cortisol output.</p>
<p>So keep that in mind.</p>
<p>So ingest sufficient calories for you and for your goals.</p>
<p>Aim to get dark leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t overcook them.</p>
<p>If you want to explore supplements,</p>
<p>the best supplements to act as adaptogens</p>
<p>are going to be ashwagandha, lion&rsquo;s mane, and chaga.</p>
<p>One or two or three of those.</p>
<p>Although if you&rsquo;re going to pick one,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend ashwagandha, 600 milligrams per day,</p>
<p>taken in the later half of the day.</p>
<p>And then there are the behavioral tools</p>
<p>that we just talked about now,</p>
<p>which are anything that reduces stress can reduce cortisol.</p>
<p>And in doing so are technically adaptogens.</p>
<p>If you want to know more behavioral tools</p>
<p>and other tools for adjusting stress</p>
<p>and learn more about adaptogens,</p>
<p>we did a whole episode called Mastering Stress.</p>
<p>So you can look to that.</p>
<p>That episode also pretty clearly defines,</p>
<p>I like to think, what short-term, medium-term,</p>
<p>and long-term stress really are.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, stress is part of life.</p>
<p>Learning how to work with it, how to dance with it,</p>
<p>how to buffer it is terrific.</p>
<p>But zeroing out cortisol is not the goal.</p>
<p>The goal is to learn to modulate and control your cortisol.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really what adaptogens are all about.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining for the beginning</p>
<p>of this Ask Me Anything episode.</p>
<p>To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes</p>
<p>of these Ask Me Anything sessions,</p>
<p>plus to receive transcripts of them</p>
<p>and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>standard channel and premium tools</p>
<p>not released anywhere else,</p>
<p>please go to hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>Just to remind you why we launched</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really twofold.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s to raise support</p>
<p>for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,</p>
<p>which of course will still be continued</p>
<p>to be released every Monday in full length.</p>
<p>We are not going to change the format</p>
<p>or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>And to fund research,</p>
<p>in particular research done on human beings.</p>
<p>So not animal models, but on human beings,</p>
<p>which I think we all agree is a species</p>
<p>that we are most interested in.</p>
<p>And we are going to specifically fund research</p>
<p>that is aimed toward developing further protocols</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>And those protocols will be distributed</p>
<p>through all channels, not just the premium channel,</p>
<p>but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>and other media channels.</p>
<p>So the idea here is to give you information</p>
<p>to your burning questions in depth</p>
<p>and allow you the opportunity to support</p>
<p>the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel</p>
<p>is that the tiny foundation has generously offered</p>
<p>to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised</p>
<p>for research through the premium channel.</p>
<p>So this is a terrific way that they&rsquo;re going to amplify</p>
<p>whatever funds come in through the premium channel</p>
<p>to further support research for science</p>
<p>and science-related tools for mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to sign up</p>
<p>for the Huberman Lab premium channel,</p>
<p>again, there&rsquo;s a cost of $10 per month,</p>
<p>or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.</p>
<p>That will give you access to all the AMAs.</p>
<p>You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll of course get answers to all the questions</p>
<p>that other people ask as well.</p>
<p>There will also be some premium content</p>
<p>such as transcripts of the AMAs</p>
<p>and various transcripts and protocols</p>
<p>of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere.</p>
<p>And again, you&rsquo;ll be supporting research</p>
<p>for mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>You can sign up for the premium channel</p>
<p>by going to hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s hubermanlab.com slash premium.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
