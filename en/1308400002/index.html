    <p>What&rsquo;s up guys it&rsquo;s time for episode 2 and I&rsquo;m gonna rock this bitch cuz I&rsquo;m gonna talk about a topic that hits</p>
<p>Close to home for everybody I think and it&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t like the people back that like you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about in a relationship like it just seems like the ones that like me</p>
<p>Uh, like I don&rsquo;t have no fucking interest and if I do it&rsquo;s short-lived or I can force myself to like them</p>
<p>But then it fizzles out</p>
<p>Before I get into all that I need to tell you about what happened to me the other day</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m driving to the gym and I&rsquo;m having a great fucking day like I&rsquo;m in a great mood</p>
<p>I got on a good fucking song and I&rsquo;m like in the car dancing doing my thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pointing like, you know, you&rsquo;d be dancing you just like throw your hands around</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like pointing at shit on the beat like with my pointer finger and I&rsquo;m just like having a little time and I</p>
<p>Like driving to the gym. So there&rsquo;s a cop driving the opposite way of me</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m over here a beat bopping going down the road and all of a sudden this cop flips its lights on and</p>
<p>Like spins around in the middle of the road and I was like, oh shit</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s getting pulled the fuck over and I&rsquo;m like, I just go back to dance and I&rsquo;m like having a good time</p>
<p>this cop pulls right the fuck up behind me and</p>
<p>Flashes the lights and I was like fuck he already had them on but then he like flashed him and like put them back on</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like god damn it. Is he pulling me over cuz like I wasn&rsquo;t speeding</p>
<p>So the fuck is he in my ass for right now?</p>
<p>So I just keep driving like I&rsquo;m like it ain&rsquo;t me it ain&rsquo;t me</p>
<p>So I just keep driving and then he starts like tailgating me like getting up right up close to my bumper and I&rsquo;m like fuck</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s me</p>
<p>So I pull over</p>
<p>This cop comes to the window. Okay, I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t like cops. I&rsquo;m just gonna go ahead and get that out of the way</p>
<p>My fight-or-flight response kicks on every fucking time. I have to deal with one</p>
<p>I will lie and manipulate and kiss ass to do whatever I have to do to get away from a goddamn cop because I have</p>
<p>A bad experience with cops</p>
<p>Terrible like they always fuck with me. I always get the corrupt one and if you piss them off</p>
<p>They have this tiniest little fuse and they have the most sensitive and fragile of egos</p>
<p>And if you fuck with them in any way, they will fuck you in any way they can ten times harder. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very on edge whenever I have to deal with a cop and this cop comes to the window and I literally am like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want this cop to come up to me and be like, what did you do? Do you know I pulled you over?</p>
<p>No motherfucker. I have no idea but like I don&rsquo;t want to sound like a smartass if I&rsquo;m like no</p>
<p>I have no clue</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like shit like all these things are going through my head this fucker this fat fucking white cop</p>
<p>Like, you know the vibe that I&rsquo;m going like the bald old fucking white man</p>
<p>With nothing better to do in his goddamn day comes up to my window and goes I saw you flip me off back there</p>
<p>What gives you the right and I immediately?</p>
<p>bust out laughing</p>
<p>Like I start pissing myself and I said, I don&rsquo;t mean any disrespect because I know that I&rsquo;m laughing</p>
<p>But I know how it looks but I promise you I just had on a really good song and I was dancing and it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>My middle finger. It was my pointer finger. Like I was just like bopping to the beat</p>
<p>And he kind of looked at me like you like that look of like yeah bullshit</p>
<p>So I was like, I know how it looks like I know this doesn&rsquo;t sound believable</p>
<p>Like I promise it&rsquo;s the truth and I showed him the song like I showed him my phone</p>
<p>I was like, look, this is what was playing</p>
<p>I was like, this is a bop and he started laughing like I put my charm on and I made him laugh</p>
<p>And so it like cracked it. I was listening to Eastside</p>
<p>by Khalid and</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s her fucking name Halsey, but it was a remix and it was like</p>
<p>Like an EDM remix cuz I&rsquo;m going to EDC this weekend</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like preparing trying to get in the mood and once I made him laugh</p>
<p>Like I knew I was okay, and I was like look, I know you don&rsquo;t know me officer</p>
<p>Ossifer you have no fucking clue who I am</p>
<p>But I was like look if I didn&rsquo;t like you and I was just flipping cops off as they drove by</p>
<p>Like I wouldn&rsquo;t be nice to you and he came to my window. Like I&rsquo;m the type person I would</p>
<p>Keep the same energy like I wouldn&rsquo;t be nice and be cutting up with you</p>
<p>Like if I didn&rsquo;t like cops, I would be rude or like take my phone out and record you like</p>
<p>So once I like convinced him, I was actually just having a good fucking day. He let me go and everything was fine</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll be damned if I have a good fucking day</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be damned like universe really played me with that one</p>
<p>Like I was feeling the best I&rsquo;ve ever felt in a long time like better than when I was on Molly</p>
<p>Like bitch, I was having such a good genuine day. Just go into the gym and listen into my song</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it was. I was just having a great day. Boom. Here you go. Here&rsquo;s the interruption</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you dare have a good day Leo fuck?</p>
<p>Okay. So now let&rsquo;s get into the topic of this episode</p>
<p>Why you don&rsquo;t like the people that like you and I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>Furl forewarn that these are just my theories and what I mean by these are my theories</p>
<p>That just puts me off the hook for anything I say, but I know what the fuck I&rsquo;m talking about and I&rsquo;m right</p>
<p>But I do have to get a little warning cuz motherfuckers love to quote you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fucking doctor. I&rsquo;m not a psychologist, but I&rsquo;d be knowing things. Alright, so listen up. So the short answer is</p>
<p>When someone likes you right off the bat you win and what I mean by you win is</p>
<p>Your value and your worth is</p>
<p>Validated when someone looks at you and you they see you and they like you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re validated</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>when someone looks at you and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t see that shit like if you like somebody and they&rsquo;re kind of like standoffish or like they&rsquo;re not like as</p>
<p>Into it as you are</p>
<p>That means they don&rsquo;t see your value or your worth and you will start to subconsciously try to make them see your worth and prove</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re worthy of their appreciation and love and</p>
<p>Attention and the way you&rsquo;re gonna do this because this is all subconscious. Like I said, you&rsquo;re not gonna be aware of it</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna start</p>
<p>Overthinking every text you send you&rsquo;re gonna try and put your best foot forward</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna try and be on tip-top of your fucking game. Like if someone likes you right off the bat</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of pressure</p>
<p>But when you have someone that you like that&rsquo;s not really feeling you that much like they&rsquo;re kind of interested</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not like acting like you&rsquo;re God&rsquo;s gift to earth</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna start over analyzing and putting so much energy into everything that you do</p>
<p>And this is hard for someone like me because if someone doesn&rsquo;t act like I&rsquo;m God&rsquo;s gift to earth. I get fucking upset</p>
<p>Okay, but when someone does act like I&rsquo;m God&rsquo;s gift to earth and they be like blowing smoke up my ass. I get anxious</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like don&rsquo;t let don&rsquo;t start liking them because this is gonna stop one day like I see you love bombing me, bitch</p>
<p>like I know like I&rsquo;ll be damned if you&rsquo;re gonna start being nice to me and</p>
<p>Get me attached to you and then all of a sudden you&rsquo;re gonna stop being nice cuz I hit you that fucking shit hurts my feelings</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t like that. So I&rsquo;m in the type boat where I&rsquo;m damned if you do damned if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m talking about people that are not as like fucked up in the head as I am</p>
<p>But yes, whenever you meet someone and they like you right off the bat. It&rsquo;s boring. You got what you wanted. It&rsquo;s instant validation</p>
<p>They see your worth. They see your value. They&rsquo;re interested in you if they pursue it great, but it gets boring</p>
<p>okay, and what I mean by boring is like it gets like normal or like air quote healthy and</p>
<p>The reason that the people that treat you badly or act like you aren&rsquo;t shit are so</p>
<p>Much more exciting and fun is because it&rsquo;s like an addiction pattern</p>
<p>So if you want to look it up, it&rsquo;s called intermittent reinforcement</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m helping put to words what&rsquo;s happening in the back of your head so you can become aware of it</p>
<p>So when someone doesn&rsquo;t see your value, you&rsquo;re subconsciously gonna start trying to prove it to them</p>
<p>okay, so what you&rsquo;re gonna be trying to do is gain their approval and then every little thing that they do every little like</p>
<p>Little what is it called every little breadcrumb? They give you you&rsquo;re gonna like eat it up</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get like a dopamine hit</p>
<p>So anytime they give you a compliment you&rsquo;re gonna get like a hit of dopamine anytime they respond to your text hit a dopamine</p>
<p>Anytime they make any kind of effort to talk to you or they are talking to you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna feel so good while you&rsquo;re talking to them because you&rsquo;re getting dopamine you&rsquo;re being accepted</p>
<p>But yes, you&rsquo;re not gonna know why talking to this person feels so good</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just gonna know that you can&rsquo;t stop thinking about them</p>
<p>And all you want to do is talk to them and when you&rsquo;re not talking to them</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like trying to think of shit to message them</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you want dopamine not them</p>
<p>Most of the time most of the time you&rsquo;re just seeking like the golden nugget that you get from getting their approval</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to get into too much of the explanation of intermittent reinforcement. You can look that up</p>
<p>So the whole thing about like not liking people back. It&rsquo;s a game. It&rsquo;s a twisted fucked-up game and it sucks</p>
<p>Okay, everyone says we don&rsquo;t like games girl. We be playing them</p>
<p>We play the shit out of them every single one of us. So stop lying</p>
<p>Accept it and play the game and choosing to not play the game is playing the game. You just don&rsquo;t realize it</p>
<p>So yes converting someone to like you is so much more exciting</p>
<p>You get excited by the act of it, but you think it&rsquo;s about the person you think this person is what you&rsquo;re excited by</p>
<p>You think this person is what you feel all these great feelings for when it&rsquo;s the process and it&rsquo;s the whole</p>
<p>Making someone see your value. That&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>This also explains the little phenomenon that goes on when you</p>
<p>Want someone and you&rsquo;ve wanted them for so long and you keep having to work for them and work toward them</p>
<p>Whatever it is once you finally get them</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want them anymore</p>
<p>Because this dopamine chase is gone. I</p>
<p>Did need to go in to explain a little bit about what happens when you like someone they don&rsquo;t like you because when you flip</p>
<p>It you understand why you don&rsquo;t like that person</p>
<p>So the person that you have like a tiny bit of interest in or you could be interested in when they start</p>
<p>Looking for your approval. They&rsquo;re gonna be messaging you more. They&rsquo;re gonna feel very forced. They&rsquo;re not gonna feel relaxed</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna feel like they&rsquo;re trying to earn your approval and some people are too ego driven and they like try to play it backwards</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna pretend like I don&rsquo;t like you. I&rsquo;m gonna ignore you. I&rsquo;m gonna this I&rsquo;m gonna that that&rsquo;s just gonna put you off</p>
<p>Well, it puts me off</p>
<p>But anyway, the person that you kind of like is gonna start coming with you with to like coming at you with too much energy</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna be trying to gain your fucking approval. They&rsquo;re not gonna give you a chance to miss them</p>
<p>Okay, so they&rsquo;re gonna always be texting you first when you&rsquo;re not talking. They&rsquo;re gonna be sending you a fucking meme</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna be sending you shit. They&rsquo;re never gonna allow</p>
<p>time for an absence of</p>
<p>their presence</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to think of them on your own and that time of</p>
<p>Not having that person talking to you gives you the chance to talk to them to reach out to them</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t talk to them for a day or a couple of hours, whatever it is</p>
<p>You start thinking about them if you enjoyed the conversation or you had interest in them</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to message them</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re constantly messaging you you will never get to the part where you&rsquo;re like, okay</p>
<p>I want to message them people need to decide it for their self. So get out of people&rsquo;s fucking face that you like</p>
<p>I know it sucks and it&rsquo;s so hard because I just explained when you&rsquo;re not talking to that person that you like</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be anxious. You&rsquo;re just gonna want to talk to them</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna like your brain is gonna be flooded with thoughts of them. You&rsquo;re gonna be looking at their pictures</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna look and see if they&rsquo;re online</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna look and see if they ignored you like there&rsquo;s so many things that go in that goes into it</p>
<p>So like in order to get rid of that anxiety, you&rsquo;ll keep messaging them now flip it when you&rsquo;re the person</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s constantly getting messaged when what you need is to be able to decide if you like this person</p>
<p>And to ping-pong the energy back and forth</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s off-putting like you people want to put effort into things</p>
<p>You have to give people a chance to reciprocate the effort because people don&rsquo;t care about things that they don&rsquo;t put energy into</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re easily just able to block you or ghost you or get rid of you</p>
<p>You need to give them a chance to put effort into you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not teaching you this to help you manipulate but do it this information what you will</p>
<p>Be responsible goddammit. You&rsquo;re responsible for your own fucking actions</p>
<p>Okay, so don&rsquo;t try and come at me when everything falls apart or you have a stalker because I&rsquo;ve had a few</p>
<p>Get motherfuckers addicted to you. You got to be careful with that</p>
<p>But yes, the reason you don&rsquo;t like people that like you is because you don&rsquo;t have that space</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t give you the opportunity to put energy into them or into the relationship or into the conversation if they&rsquo;re constantly</p>
<p>The ones lighting it up. It&rsquo;s like like you&rsquo;re kind of like indifferent and you&rsquo;ll get bored of it very fast and it&rsquo;s understandable</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally understandable because all these things are basic human psychology</p>
<p>okay, so my next theory has to do kind of with imposter syndrome and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>Someone likes you, but you know, you are putting on a facade</p>
<p>okay, so if you&rsquo;re not being your authentic self if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Faking it if you&rsquo;re just kind of being what everybody else wants you to be or you&rsquo;re being what&rsquo;s cool in society</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be scared to like people that like you because you know</p>
<p>Whether consciously or unconsciously the image that you&rsquo;re portraying is what they like. They don&rsquo;t like what&rsquo;s under your mask</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna feel scared to like them</p>
<p>You might not know why but you&rsquo;ve got a fear of abandonment because it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re trying to sell somebody a car</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re a blue car and you painted yourself red and someone goes to the lot and they want a red car</p>
<p>They buy you. Okay, you&rsquo;re the red car</p>
<p>And then when they take you home it rains and all your fucking red paint comes off and they see that you&rsquo;re blue</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna walk out and be like what the fuck I wanted a red car not a fucking blue car and they&rsquo;re gonna try</p>
<p>And take you back to the dealership</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a funny-ass analogy, but it&rsquo;s the truth</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my second theory is one of imposter syndrome. Like you kind of know it&rsquo;s like self-fulfilling prophecy</p>
<p>You know how it&rsquo;s gonna end you are anxious and you know</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t really you that they like and you&rsquo;re gonna be scared to open up and you can&rsquo;t keep a facade going forever</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exhausting, but a lot of people don&rsquo;t even understand that they&rsquo;re putting on a facade</p>
<p>But they subconsciously know it so they will feel a push away when people try to get close because in</p>
<p>Somewhere in their mind they know they aren&rsquo;t being the true them and that&rsquo;s very prevalent with social media today</p>
<p>If someone meets you on social media and they start DM in you like if you have this whole different person</p>
<p>Portrayed on your fucking Instagram. You&rsquo;re not as cool as you seem. You&rsquo;re not as fucking skinny as you seem</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re gonna be scared to like talk to them. Yeah, you&rsquo;re gonna be excited to talk to them</p>
<p>Oh my god, this hot person likes me. Oh, you&rsquo;re gonna get like all giddy and happy, but you&rsquo;re gonna be like, ah fuck</p>
<p>Because well, you like don&rsquo;t want to like them because you know, that ain&rsquo;t you the person that you&rsquo;re portraying ain&rsquo;t you it&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not the real you so that&rsquo;s just another one of my theories and that one was quick and short and easy to explain</p>
<p>My next one&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>Okay, so the next example I realized yesterday actually with my therapist on</p>
<p>Why you don&rsquo;t like certain people or why you might be hesitant to letting in love. So if someone is trying to</p>
<p>Come forward at you with all of this loving energy and this appreciation and they see your value</p>
<p>some people myself included are not comfortable receiving that and one of the reasons is</p>
<p>because we look at the person and</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not up to certain standards, we won&rsquo;t trust it</p>
<p>We will be scared to let it in because it feels toxic</p>
<p>okay, and what I mean by that when I say we look at the person if</p>
<p>Someone is coming to you because they like you and they&rsquo;re feeding you all these compliments and they&rsquo;re trying to put energy and effort</p>
<p>into you</p>
<p>But if you look at them and their relationship with their self if they have no sense of self if they don&rsquo;t have boundaries</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s scary to let in</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t value and like respect the way that they feel and they don&rsquo;t care the way that they feel</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a red flag if they don&rsquo;t stand up for their self</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a red flag if they don&rsquo;t even consider their self their physical well-being their safety their feelings their boundaries</p>
<p>How the fuck are you gonna be able to consider mine?</p>
<p>How are you gonna be able to respect me if you don&rsquo;t respect yourself?</p>
<p>How are you gonna be able to stand up for me when I need you if you don&rsquo;t even stand up for yourself if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Too fucking weak to do that</p>
<p>If someone doesn&rsquo;t take their needs and make them important to them and make sure that they get met</p>
<p>They take control of their life and they make sure that they get what they want and they make sure that their needs are</p>
<p>Met if someone doesn&rsquo;t show that of course, you&rsquo;re not gonna like them because when you get into a relationship</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to get into a relationship with someone that disregards their own needs because they&rsquo;ll do it to you</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t know how to care for their self and make sure their own needs get met</p>
<p>How are they supposed to consider yours? How are they supposed to make sure your needs get met?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re gonna be in a relationship where you&rsquo;re emotionally on your fucking own</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to meet all your own needs and theirs and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s off-putting that is something subconscious that I have not realized before it</p>
<p>Like I said, I realized that yesterday talking to my therapist about it and she read me to fucking filth</p>
<p>But this is a huge thing</p>
<p>I always wondered why I was so like off like what is it called?</p>
<p>Unsettled off-put like love is so off-putting to me like it feels toxic to let it in like I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>that shit because</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s definition of love is not my definition of love a lot of people have a toxic and fucked-up version of love and I can</p>
<p>See that so when someone&rsquo;s version of love does not match mine. I don&rsquo;t want it. I don&rsquo;t want to accept it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want it near me because I know what it comes with. But like I said, this is a very deep</p>
<p>Side of this and the just the initial off-putting</p>
<p>Part of it about someone not being able to stand up for themselves someone not having self-discipline someone not being</p>
<p>truthful and honest and authentic if someone lies and</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t seem like secure with their self. They&rsquo;ll manipulate and that&rsquo;s scary for someone</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s experienced something like that before so you might just be noticing these things</p>
<p>Subconsciously in someone and that might be what&rsquo;s preventing you from liking them like you can see someone on paper and</p>
<p>Logically, it makes so much fucking sense</p>
<p>Why you should like them and they&rsquo;re hot and they have every everything that you should like you should want everything</p>
<p>You should want is there all the boxes are checked and it makes so much sense</p>
<p>Logically why you should want them if you don&rsquo;t want them. There&rsquo;s a reason</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to force it try to understand it</p>
<p>Okay, try to understand yourself and get to the bottom of that shit because you cannot force yourself to like something you do not like</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way it fucking is</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t like something you have to accept that you don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>You can beat yourself up all day. You can shame yourself. You can guilt yourself and ain&rsquo;t gonna fucking work</p>
<p>Sorry, babe, and that&rsquo;s really damaging to yourself and your relationship with yourself. So don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>So you just have to accept like if you don&rsquo;t like them, that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with you because you don&rsquo;t like this</p>
<p>Logically perfect person your subconscious is picking up on shit that you&rsquo;re not. I</p>
<p>really want to do an entire episode about why nice guys finish last or</p>
<p>Like the nice girls because it can go for any relationship any dynamic why the nice one never gets picked</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re one of the people that&rsquo;s like, oh my god</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m such a good person and nobody wants me I can tell you exactly why you&rsquo;re not gonna fucking like it and that one</p>
<p>Will probably get me like a lot of one-star ratings, but it&rsquo;s gonna be the truth and you have to</p>
<p>Be able to hear the truth and accept it so that you can change it if you want different results</p>
<p>Because if you keep trying to the same shit, you&rsquo;re gonna still keep not getting picked, babe</p>
<p>Alright guys, that&rsquo;s it for episode 2. I hope you liked it. I hope you got something from it</p>
