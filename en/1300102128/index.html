<p>that black guy voice makes me uncomfortable dude</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be honest with you</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s not really a black guy</p>
<p>voice it&rsquo;s a white guy talking like a</p>
<p>black guy which is</p>
<p>never cool which is it not even right it&rsquo;s actually a</p>
<p>robot that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been programmed to be a black guy</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a robot that&rsquo;s white</p>
<p>made by white people they don&rsquo;t know how to do a black</p>
<p>voice I like Keira Knightley better</p>
<p>keira Knightley was better that was so hot</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about someone a black guy faking a white voice</p>
<p>is really completely acceptable</p>
<p>you know the best black voice</p>
<p>yeah oh dude what is it does it</p>
<p>weird you out though when you can call somebody on the</p>
<p>phone and you know that they&rsquo;re black</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking to him</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like how would I describe this to an alien</p>
<p>you know how would I describe how I know this is a</p>
<p>black guy but I know it&rsquo;s a black guy</p>
<p>I missed that laugh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about</p>
<p>that laugh brought to you by Bert Kreischer</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen follow Bert on Twitter for not</p>
<p>your A R E I S C H E R</p>
<p>also known as Bert the Conqueror on the Travel Channel</p>
<p>which just started</p>
<p>right yep last week was our first episode first</p>
<p>week powerful</p>
<p>and it was a rating success great ratings and great</p>
<p>social media success social</p>
<p>media success was a brand new thing they track on</p>
<p>trend TV or TV trenders</p>
<p>and my agent sent it to me he&rsquo;s like you conquered</p>
<p>and I was like I did he was like you were number 9</p>
<p>right behind the Kardashians well right behind</p>
<p>the fucking ass but it&rsquo;s just me it&rsquo;s me I literally</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s my theory about promotion on Twitter</p>
<p>I think you have to promote with a joke</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s my rule</p>
<p>if you obsessively like like</p>
<p>like I told you the other day</p>
<p>Ralphie is just taking Twitter to a brand new level</p>
<p>thank you Brian Joe hasn&rsquo;t seen any of it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like how you dodge that bullet</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like show it coming out of my rack</p>
<p>and go they&rsquo;ve been bombing in here</p>
<p>like it is like what Ralphie made</p>
<p>up to I guarantee you he tweeted the last 2 minutes</p>
<p>guarantee yeah I just added them and then already he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been Kevin Smithing me yeah</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>is it Ralphie</p>
<p>underscore may</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s him in that big orange jacket yeah</p>
<p>Ralphie underscore may it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>whoa Jesus Christ he&rsquo;s been on Twitter for</p>
<p>how long like a</p>
<p>week literally</p>
<p>literally a week</p>
<p>maybe a week and 1/2 and and and he had like 15 tweets</p>
<p>or like 20 tweets up</p>
<p>until then and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a thousand now how many</p>
<p>tweets he has because for some</p>
<p>reason my my computer has gone back to the old Twitter</p>
<p>you know I was</p>
<p>using the new Twitter</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>the new Twitter site I don&rsquo;t know how to how to</p>
<p>switch it up it&rsquo;s not at the very top hmm</p>
<p>is it is it ralphi</p>
<p>underscore may</p>
<p>ralphie underscore May here I&rsquo;ll just go into my</p>
<p>trend yeah and I&rsquo;ll find him right away</p>
<p>what happened all</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s got a total of</p>
<p>what that can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>right he just</p>
<p>started using it</p>
<p>1082 tweets and he&rsquo;s only been using</p>
<p>it a couple weeks god that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>true yeah that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>unless he&rsquo;s got some kind of</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s now Ralphis</p>
<p>defense in Ralphis defense he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>promoting anything</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s simply arguing he hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>learned not to argue with people yet</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>going back and</p>
<p>forth that&rsquo;s something you really have to</p>
<p>learn too oh man</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>learn that shit</p>
<p>yeah I just I never</p>
<p>reply to anyone at all</p>
<p>and I promote I only promote with the joke so if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna promote</p>
<p>the show I&rsquo;ll do something funny</p>
<p>promote it I</p>
<p>think those get retweeted</p>
<p>I try to be as</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not always</p>
<p>funny if I find some interesting shit I just</p>
<p>throw up some interesting shit anything</p>
<p>anything that I</p>
<p>think is fascinating whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny or not</p>
<p>and if I have</p>
<p>to promote something I promote something but</p>
<p>I always try to</p>
<p>treat it as if I&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>aware of people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>attention spans and anything interesting that I find</p>
<p>I give to Twitter</p>
<p>immediately</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give it right back</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a different animal than say myself or Brian</p>
<p>who if we promote then people just delete us we like</p>
<p>enough of that shit yeah</p>
<p>people want to see</p>
<p>shit they don&rsquo;t want to see our shit</p>
<p>and they want to see you</p>
<p>left and right</p>
<p>where the guy at the</p>
<p>where the guy that orgy fingering asshole you know</p>
<p>everyone came to fuck</p>
<p>where the guys just POW</p>
<p>even grosser I went to this one</p>
<p>guy&rsquo;s Twitter I don&rsquo;t mention his name because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>particularly like him</p>
<p>but it was all</p>
<p>promoting some</p>
<p>special that&rsquo;s coming out</p>
<p>and it was all like him</p>
<p>tweeting celebrities</p>

<p>an assistant that&rsquo;s like no you&rsquo;re supposed to be it</p>
<p>could be it</p>
<p>could be that or it</p>
<p>could be just someone who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know how to use social</p>
<p>media and is an</p>
<p>annoying cunt</p>

<p>think he&rsquo;s a scientist</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t teach much let&rsquo;s Google</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s Google Lil</p>
<p>Twist whenever</p>
<p>something like this happens I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>people guessing a</p>
<p>child rapper</p>
<p>whenever something like this happens I get I</p>
<p>really feel so out of it man</p>
<p>when I hear</p>
<p>about this child born in 93</p>
<p>Jesus Christ</p>
<p>he was born when I was auditioning for Newsradio</p>
<p>I graduate that&rsquo;s when he shot out of his mom&rsquo;s box</p>
<p>93 wow I was</p>
<p>still in college</p>
<p>his name is Christopher L More</p>
<p>born January 11th 1993 better</p>
<p>known as his</p>
<p>stage name Lil Twist</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an American rapper an American rapper from Dallas</p>
<p>he signed onto Lil</p>
<p>wayne&rsquo;s label</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s Lil</p>
<p>Lil Twist lil</p>
<p>Wayne don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>rapper I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand little</p>
<p>6ft is what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably lil</p>
<p>Wayne is a fascinating</p>
<p>cultural icon to me I watch his</p>
<p>music and I am</p>
<p>completely perplexed and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a language I just do not</p>
<p>speak it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>whatever it is it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get me I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it</p>
<p>they are fucking</p>
<p>he is huge man he is gigantic</p>
<p>massive he couldn&rsquo;t be bigger</p>
<p>is he the biggest rapper ever</p>
<p>one of them he is he is the biggest rapper</p>
<p>he is the most commercially</p>
<p>successful rapper</p>
<p>right now I</p>
<p>think probably ever</p>
<p>but I feel like I</p>
<p>should give him another chance I feel like</p>
<p>there must be</p>
<p>some reason why I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>here comes the</p>
<p>black in me out</p>
<p>his earlier</p>
<p>stuff is much better than his</p>
<p>later stuff</p>
<p>when he was with the hot boys</p>
<p>he was amazing I ran into him in Juvenile</p>
<p>him juvenile</p>
<p>and like they had a fan</p>
<p>there was 4 of them</p>
<p>out of New Orleans and his earlier</p>
<p>stuff he was good man</p>
<p>he had rhymes that</p>
<p>would blow you away wow</p>
<p>so now everyone just go on the little twist</p>
<p>ask Little Twist trend topic</p>
<p>and ask very insightful questions that you know little</p>
<p>Twist doesn&rsquo;t have the answer for</p>
<p>just not don&rsquo;t try to be</p>
<p>racist the whole goal is not to be racist</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just to be like</p>
<p>seriously do you think there&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>life forms out in the universal twist</p>
<p>and like just see what Little Twist is answers really</p>
<p>is an answer for that listen Little</p>
<p>Twist grew up the internet he might be</p>
<p>smart as fuck yeah</p>
<p>the thing about kids</p>
<p>today man you can never</p>
<p>underestimate them it&rsquo;s not like they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the same access to information that we do</p>
<p>when we were</p>
<p>kids we were retarded because no one told us shit</p>
<p>we were figuring</p>
<p>things out like little</p>
<p>monkeys just wandering around our neighborhoods</p>
<p>but now there&rsquo;s no more neighborhoods man there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the whole world man</p>
<p>those stupid</p>
<p>rumors that you</p>
<p>heard about</p>

<p>gonna take look it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t want to be on time for my own fucking show</p>
<p>all right we&rsquo;re here no one&rsquo;s dying</p>

<p>11 12 years now</p>
<p>maybe even 13 I</p>
<p>might have met him in</p>
<p>yeah might be 13 years fuck that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy he was drawing a</p>
<p>picture in the green room</p>
<p>while Joe was talking to some friends and he goes</p>
<p>Brian record this I&rsquo;m like what</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like okay so I</p>
<p>start recording him just drawing something</p>
<p>and then he pulls up the sign that says</p>
<p>Brian loves</p>
<p>Taylor Vixen who&rsquo;s my ex I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>what the fuck and then he pulls out his balls and puts</p>
<p>his balls behind it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just like</p>
<p>Jesus Christ</p>
<p>man it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Joey diaz&rsquo;s balls</p>
<p>in a room that small is</p>
<p>I bet his balls are massive</p>
<p>massive you too</p>
<p>queer should go get a room</p>
<p>talking about Joey</p>
<p>Diaz the fuck</p>
<p>dog dog yeah</p>
<p>well what Joey did is he made a</p>
<p>funny video to</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s ex cause</p>
<p>Brian and made a couple of other</p>
<p>funny videos</p>
<p>he just he&rsquo;s torturing her yeah I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>torturing her</p>
<p>Joey Diaz is torturing me then you&rsquo;re sending him</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m sending him yeah</p>
<p>funny I think</p>
<p>she would think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny not like torturous not torture</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying torture like you&rsquo;re hurting her</p>
<p>torture also means fun</p>
<p>you know I always fucking torturing her</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>mean you trying to hurt her yes she has an RSS feed</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what that is</p>
<p>Brian shut the fuck up please</p>
<p>oh is this the</p>
<p>whole fucking Bill Burr</p>
<p>argument by the way</p>
<p>which continued onto Bill burr&rsquo;s podcast and now</p>
<p>apparently under Greg Fitzsimmons podcast</p>
<p>shut up which is even more</p>
<p>ridiculous I was</p>
<p>so disappointed in Bill when I</p>
<p>heard him talking</p>
<p>on his own podcast</p>
<p>about it I&rsquo;m like wow</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re and then</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the worst part</p>
<p>about he goes</p>
<p>and I just wanted to say I won</p>
<p>yeah I tried</p>
<p>to talk to my lawyer</p>
<p>my lawyer said that I</p>
<p>could sue okay yeah</p>
<p>I won I was like</p>
<p>Jesus Christ</p>
<p>so many go find Bill</p>
<p>and give him a fucking hug</p>
<p>that guy it&rsquo;s so ironic that Bill was talking shit</p>
<p>about people who</p>
<p>smoke weed if anybody needs weed it&rsquo;s built by</p>
<p>oh he could</p>
<p>definitely use a bowl</p>
<p>fuck yeah because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a very intense guy</p>
<p>but I always</p>
<p>assume that&rsquo;s what everyone in Boston is like</p>
<p>yeah very similar</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a hard place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why comedy there it&rsquo;s such a good</p>
<p>place to grow up and</p>
<p>start doing comedy because you</p>
<p>learn very early on to</p>
<p>appreciate people&rsquo;s attention</p>
<p>spans because they will fucking boo you off the</p>
<p>stage with the</p>
<p>quickness you know</p>
<p>we did we did I did a show</p>
<p>and what was the comedy</p>
<p>connection comedy</p>
<p>Connection and</p>
<p>you all yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>jamieson tour</p>
<p>it was me Billy Guardell</p>
<p>Steve Byrne and Danny Pevens I think yeah</p>
<p>and we had to do the show to get renewed like</p>
<p>do the show</p>
<p>to get the tour</p>
<p>renewed so and the tour was a dickload of money for us</p>
<p>right it was like</p>
<p>4 grand a weekend</p>
<p>for and all he had to do was 20 minutes</p>
<p>wow and Billy Gardell</p>
<p>was like Billy I mean this is I probably shouldn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about out of school about Billy but Billy had just</p>
<p>quit drinking and he&rsquo;s sober now</p>
<p>but had just quit drinking like</p>
<p>that Thursday</p>
<p>and was like I&rsquo;m never touching it</p>
<p>again and we&rsquo;ve got to go and he&rsquo;s fucking freaking out</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like you got to close the show</p>
<p>and I got to follow like</p>
<p>3 guys that are all fucking bang bang bang in Boston</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m nervous</p>
<p>about doing well in Boston</p>
<p>because I kind of do</p>
<p>race I used to do a lot of race stuff then</p>
<p>and I was like fuck</p>
<p>and I just came out the gates and I was like</p>
<p>and just I just gave it</p>
<p>everything I had just Bam Bam Bam Bam</p>
<p>and then like 15 minutes</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like fucking can I keep this energy going</p>
<p>then we fucking</p>
<p>and I had a good set and we got the tour</p>
<p>renewed but</p>
<p>of course just</p>
<p>fucking dumped on some</p>
<p>black guy in the</p>
<p>front row the</p>
<p>whole time he</p>
<p>loved it he was with a</p>
<p>white chick she had red hair</p>
<p>is that sound</p>
<p>weird when the girls like yeah</p>
<p>but that was yeah</p>
<p>that was my only</p>
<p>experience in Boston</p>
<p>boston&rsquo;s a fun place</p>
<p>fun town too bad it gets too cold</p>
<p>never live there</p>
<p>again sorry</p>
<p>love you guys</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t live there</p>
<p>great place for comedy though</p>
<p>when you you live in a</p>
<p>place where it&rsquo;s that fucking</p>
<p>harsh you know that kind of an environment</p>
<p>and now I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>but you think you know a lot of good</p>
<p>comics come</p>
<p>out of LA too so that argument kind of sucks</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>start in LA</p>
<p>yeah some of them do who yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met some comics</p>
<p>started out here</p>
<p>holzman started out here didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he he did right</p>
<p>I know I know guys who</p>
<p>started out here that are really good</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um I mean you can</p>
<p>start anywhere man I</p>
<p>started in New York</p>
<p>I did it once in</p>
<p>Tallahassee</p>
<p>and then moved</p>
<p>right to New York did it in New York</p>
<p>and got my lunch</p>
<p>money taken</p>
<p>really fucking</p>
<p>quick yeah just</p>
<p>my first time ever on</p>
<p>stage this guy</p>
<p>Louis Schafer was like</p>
<p>I said I wanted to be a</p>
<p>comic so I and</p>
<p>it was it&rsquo;s a long</p>
<p>story but my dad</p>
<p>gave me one of those</p>
<p>phone calls you don&rsquo;t ever want to have from a parent</p>
<p>where he called me one morning on my birthday</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m expecting a birthday</p>
<p>phone call and he calls me as like you&rsquo;re pathetic</p>
<p>you make me sick to my stomach</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m embarrassed of you</p>
<p>you said you were</p>
<p>gonna be a comic you got</p>
<p>rolling Stone</p>
<p>wrote an article</p>
<p>about you and you said you were</p>
<p>gonna move and be a</p>
<p>comic and you&rsquo;ve been there</p>
<p>8 months and you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done shit</p>
<p>and I lie I lie</p>
<p>about you like</p>
<p>judges say how&rsquo;s your son doing</p>
<p>and I lied do you know what that makes me feel like oh</p>
<p>wow it&rsquo;s my birthday okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting hungover on my</p>
<p>underwear on my</p>
<p>couch that I grew up on</p>
<p>in New York I had that up there</p>
<p>and my dad&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>and I was like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like I failed you as a parent I</p>
<p>failed you you have no humility I don&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>just keep doing what you do I</p>
<p>guess get a fucking job</p>
<p>you have no humility I had no humility at the time</p>
<p>in what way</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>like I was like I want to be a</p>
<p>comic but I didn&rsquo;t know how to go</p>
<p>about getting it because I felt like I was too good</p>
<p>to work the door or 2</p>
<p>you know does that make any</p>
<p>sense when I say that</p>
<p>I felt like I was too</p>
<p>I was I was too good to just get into the ground</p>
<p>level I wanted to be discovered I wanted to be hmm</p>
<p>what was what brought that on</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know I mean that&rsquo;s just I</p>
<p>think a lot of people are like hubris just youth yeah I</p>
<p>think a lot of people that how old were you 26</p>
<p>and also yeah and I was too</p>
<p>young to like</p>
<p>the open mic</p>
<p>scene was all alternative comedy</p>
<p>and like Dmitri Martin and I</p>
<p>started around the same time and Dmitri just got</p>
<p>welcomed by</p>
<p>them and I hung out and no one ever talked to me</p>
<p>and I was like oh</p>
<p>fucking great</p>
<p>so then I just hung out the comedy clubs and drank</p>
<p>in the back of comedy clubs you know what I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>found ironic</p>
<p>about alternative comedy is that a lot of alternative</p>
<p>comics were like outcasts and</p>
<p>they felt like</p>
<p>you know they were kind of</p>
<p>you know nerds</p>
<p>or whatever you and meanwhile they are like the</p>
<p>least welcoming</p>
<p>the most and the</p>
<p>weirdest like backstabbyish</p>
<p>caddyish it&rsquo;s very strange that you</p>
<p>would think that the people that were picked on</p>
<p>would be like really open and warm</p>
<p>and friendly yeah they</p>
<p>were brutal I</p>
<p>would go to</p>
<p>forget the name of the fucking surf reality</p>
<p>and collective</p>
<p>unconscious and I</p>
<p>would hang out try to do sets</p>
<p>and no one would</p>
<p>speak to me no one would</p>
<p>speak to me</p>
<p>and I would just be sitting there and Dimitri</p>
<p>would talk to me</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>literally would come</p>
<p>and talk to me and then walk away and talk to all them</p>
<p>and then come back and talk to me</p>
<p>and I was just fucking</p>
<p>but I never felt</p>
<p>like an alternative is that you though or is it no I</p>
<p>would try to talk to people</p>
<p>and whenever I said they&rsquo;d make fun of me</p>
<p>like I remember they</p>
<p>would make fun of you like</p>
<p>first anything out of my mouth</p>
<p>they just go</p>
<p>okay okay and this is the</p>
<p>comics this is the comics wow</p>
<p>yeah because they wanted you to</p>
<p>feel uncomfortable oh they wanted me to feel horrible</p>
<p>wow isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>weird oh it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst and then</p>
<p>I and then I go to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so common though oh</p>
<p>oh go go I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m generalizing and I don&rsquo;t want to do that but</p>
<p>go hang out at fuckin</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think</p>
<p>about UCB UCB</p>
<p>and see how like</p>
<p>I know Tom said he went and did</p>
<p>they have a</p>
<p>comic book I did a set there once and I had a</p>
<p>great time I only did it once and I remember</p>
<p>somebody pointed me to a thread somewhere</p>
<p>where the people said they actually</p>
<p>enjoyed the show but</p>
<p>they were like what the fuck is Joe Rogan doing here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so stupid</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird but</p>
<p>you know it is but it isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know I mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re expecting a certain</p>
<p>particular type of comedy that</p>
<p>maybe makes them feel good but your comedy is the same</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what really</p>
<p>upsets me I don&rsquo;t give a shit personally</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking to get</p>
<p>spots at a comic book store</p>
<p>but I did a</p>
<p>comic bookstore</p>
<p>I just did one and he said he was</p>
<p>great I did it</p>
<p>for Duncan it was awesome</p>
<p>Duncan but Duncan</p>
<p>Duncan is kind of welcomed</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s welcomed</p>
<p>everywhere duncan&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>genius he can</p>
<p>float between</p>
<p>worlds but what were you saying</p>
<p>so I had no humility that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it gets to</p>
<p>and it was just I</p>
<p>would sit in the back of comedy clubs I think</p>
<p>so but this how does this</p>
<p>translate this is</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m confused</p>
<p>you say you have no humility at the time</p>
<p>you thought you were too good but yet here you are in</p>
<p>these alternative</p>
<p>rooms and everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>treating you like shit</p>
<p>do you think they&rsquo;re connected</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there were I&rsquo;m sure that my perception of what</p>
<p>the status quo of comedy clubs was</p>
<p>perceived from way I&rsquo;ve been treated</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d go to I&rsquo;d go to</p>
<p>like the Boston Comedy Club of the cellar</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d say hi to Tell and Norton</p>
<p>right they were all cool but they won&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>they were also working comics</p>
<p>I was that&rsquo;s what I wanted to be</p>
<p>and I think</p>
<p>my dad what my dad&rsquo;s note was was my dad&rsquo;s kind of guy</p>
<p>that if he wanted something he</p>
<p>would get it and he&rsquo;d go</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d say the</p>
<p>this is what</p>
<p>I want can you please help me get this and I</p>
<p>would not that guy</p>
<p>just hang out the back of the club and go you know in</p>
<p>their defense</p>
<p>in anybody&rsquo;s defense when it comes to hanging out with</p>
<p>new people man I try to be as friendly and as open with</p>
<p>everybody that I can new</p>
<p>comics I love talking to new comics</p>
<p>but man there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a certain point in time sometimes</p>
<p>in the middle of a conversation when you realize oh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stuck talking to this dummy</p>
<p>yeah you know and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s annoying man when you have a good</p>
<p>group and a good vibe</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>maybe you came off like too loud or I didn&rsquo;t say a word</p>
<p>really I was man I</p>
<p>maybe your stage</p>
<p>your act I went from this</p>
<p>what were they</p>
<p>judging you from I</p>
<p>never got on</p>
<p>stage so what were they judging you from</p>
<p>I was nice everyone liked me but</p>
<p>the alternative</p>
<p>people didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but you must have</p>
<p>said a word because you said that they were mocking you</p>
<p>for saying anything oh the alternative comedics yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go up and I</p>
<p>would didn&rsquo;t know how to do</p>
<p>stand up oh</p>
<p>so you did go up on</p>
<p>stages of reality</p>
<p>and collective</p>
<p>unconscious but you paid 3 bucks</p>
<p>and go up at the end of the night</p>
<p>right like and</p>
<p>that was how</p>
<p>those rooms work back</p>
<p>right well then you can</p>
<p>understand why they didn&rsquo;t want to talk to you</p>
<p>right I can</p>
<p>understand that they didn&rsquo;t want to talk to me</p>
<p>thanks bring</p>
<p>back to the book I</p>
<p>mean that&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>I mean we&rsquo;re just I have to break down</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>funny either it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like of course</p>
<p>right they would</p>
<p>laugh at whatever they said because they</p>
<p>had said it</p>
<p>and it also</p>
<p>was a certain sensibility to</p>
<p>right yeah and my shit was like I was trying to be</p>
<p>funny in any comedy club</p>
<p>anyway you were trying to be</p>
<p>funny in any</p>
<p>Comic Con I was</p>
<p>trying to be</p>
<p>funny I didn&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know there was a difference in alternative</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we were talking</p>
<p>about that before you know</p>
<p>about this guy that they were saying is the</p>
<p>founder of alternative comedy</p>
<p>and we both agreed like he&rsquo;s not even an alternative</p>
<p>comic it&rsquo;s just a comic</p>
<p>you know what does that even mean</p>
<p>you know who I</p>
<p>think was the</p>
<p>founder of alternative comedy</p>
<p>as far as I know if</p>
<p>it all came out of Boston supposedly it all came out a</p>
<p>catch rising star</p>
<p>it was David Cross</p>
<p>because David</p>
<p>Cross was doing like really</p>
<p>weird shit what about</p>
<p>Steve Martin</p>
<p>oh well Steve Martin is</p>
<p>an icon I mean</p>
<p>Steve Martin is a different</p>
<p>thing he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what David Cross did here&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things he did let me give you an example</p>
<p>he put on a stretching tape</p>
<p>for like a warm up exercise tape</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>starts stretching</p>
<p>and talking on</p>
<p>stage about a stretching</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know why but it was silly</p>
<p>there was something</p>
<p>funny about it but it was</p>
<p>completely ridiculous</p>
<p>that he was taking this chance</p>
<p>to go on stage but</p>
<p>a lot of people weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>laughing but everybody had a smile on</p>
<p>their face like what the fuck is he doing it was fun</p>
<p>Steve Martin was a</p>
<p>comic he&rsquo;s just silly</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>often did a lot of alternative stuff on</p>
<p>stage you know alternative</p>
<p>stuff like what like he</p>
<p>would do banjo</p>
<p>stuff he would do like that&rsquo;s a banjo</p>
<p>alternative that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>alternative</p>
<p>he alternative</p>
<p>the idea of alternative is like hipster</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like nerdy</p>
<p>super smart you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s what alternative comedy is supposed to be</p>
<p>like not too loud not too physical</p>
<p>Steve Martin is the antithesis</p>
<p>of that he&rsquo;s the absolute opposite of what you</p>
<p>would consider alternative comedy</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t put my finger on alternative comedy per se</p>
<p>whether it is or it isn&rsquo;t but I can put my</p>
<p>finger on what alternative</p>
<p>comics dislike</p>
<p>like I can go on the road and go shower this guy</p>
<p>would know like when you see guys on the road where</p>
<p>their act is just like</p>
<p>unbearable and you&rsquo;re like holy shit well and I</p>
<p>think what they</p>
<p>think is that is the comedy</p>
<p>that goes on not in</p>
<p>UCB that is the comedy that&rsquo;s everywhere</p>
<p>and that is like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a lot</p>
<p>of them go on the road and see what you do on the road</p>
<p>or see what</p>
<p>the road&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>well eventually the road becomes the same</p>
<p>everywhere I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna tell you that</p>
<p>my crowds are</p>
<p>sometimes more enthusiastic</p>
<p>in different towns but they&rsquo;re all the same now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>they all know what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not an</p>
<p>issue anymore</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>young and no one knows who you are</p>
<p>and you go on stage</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re used to doing the</p>
<p>UCB and getting</p>
<p>those really polite laughs</p>
<p>and chuckles in the back of the room</p>
<p>with some witty</p>
<p>a reference that you made to some</p>
<p>fucking Dune</p>
<p>novel you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying something</p>
<p>about the spice</p>
<p>and everyone in the</p>
<p>UCB thinks it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny do that shit in</p>
<p>Tallahassee</p>
<p>Florida they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>throw bottles at you</p>
<p>motherfucker you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a problem with</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>no one knows who you are man that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>tough when you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>bringing in your own</p>
<p>crowd you could get really soft easily</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a name and you know you have a</p>
<p>bunch of people that</p>
<p>come to see you all the time and you know they give you</p>
<p>so much love and they want you to</p>
<p>succeed they want to</p>
<p>laugh they&rsquo;re not like</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have any arms</p>
<p>crossed staring at you sideways</p>
<p>good comedies</p>
<p>good comedy I mean</p>
<p>Patton Oswald makes me</p>
<p>laugh I don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>what anyone says</p>
<p>he makes me giggle</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s one of my favorites</p>
<p>first time I ever saw him on</p>
<p>stage he was like he&rsquo;s really big in the alternative</p>
<p>comedy scene</p>
<p>and I was like oh really and then</p>
<p>he just murdered and it was an alternative it was just</p>
<p>funny yeah well</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s big in the alternative comedy</p>
<p>scene because he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>comic book nerd and he loves science fiction</p>
<p>and you know he fits in physically</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>they accept him but he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great writer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he is he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the best</p>
<p>this book is really</p>
<p>good I got it yeah</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read it yet but I picked it up so now</p>
<p>put it in perspective</p>
<p>now to get to what</p>
<p>to bring it full circle</p>
<p>if this is possibly</p>
<p>at all possible so</p>
<p>that is who I was in New York</p>
<p>in 1997 trying to fit in trying to</p>
<p>break my way into comedy</p>
<p>through having beers with</p>
<p>comics and not</p>
<p>fitting in an alternative and not</p>
<p>being having</p>
<p>the gumption or the gregariousness to</p>
<p>break in in the</p>
<p>were you doing sets</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what the fuck I was doing</p>
<p>I was working out at Barnes and Noble</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re working at Barnes and</p>
<p>Noble no working</p>
<p>working out</p>
<p>this is bad like you do sets at Barnes and</p>
<p>Nobles working at Barnes and</p>
<p>Noble and then</p>
<p>working out during the day in the basement</p>
<p>like I was fucking</p>
<p>I got fired from Barnes and</p>
<p>Noble this is the worst</p>
<p>I was working at Barnes and</p>
<p>Noble and Aster</p>
<p>place no fucking AC</p>
<p>and so every day I</p>
<p>Would you ever have a job</p>
<p>where you lift</p>
<p>boxes and as you do</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like that&rsquo;s not a bad that&rsquo;s a goodbye workout</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like oh</p>
<p>all right I&rsquo;ll do a little bit of this</p>
<p>and if I do this all day long I&rsquo;m fucking jacked by</p>
<p>by the end of the summer</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;d go down to the basement</p>
<p>and you could take the freight elevator</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna sound like a psycho into 5 minutes</p>
<p>you could take the freight</p>
<p>elevator to the basement and no one</p>
<p>could get down there</p>
<p>cause you had the elevator</p>
<p>and so once I got to the basement</p>
<p>I take off my</p>
<p>clothes and</p>
<p>start working out</p>
<p>and just like do push ups</p>
<p>sit ups fucking</p>
<p>curls with boxes</p>
<p>whole books out into fucking</p>
<p>these fucking jobs front rows</p>
<p>and I work out and then it was there was no AC</p>
<p>so then I&rsquo;d wait till I cool down put all my</p>
<p>clothes back on</p>
<p>get in the freight elevator</p>
<p>walk up and I just killed like</p>
<p>30 minutes when you have a job like that</p>
<p>to kill 30 minutes is a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like fucking</p>
<p>come that much closer being Dover done</p>
<p>right right so I&rsquo;m like this is and I&rsquo;m eating ripped</p>
<p>you remember Ripful</p>
<p>yeah popping fucking</p>
<p>3 were fuels</p>
<p>every 3 hours</p>
<p>right oh my</p>
<p>God like a tweaker</p>
<p>running around</p>
<p>Sheldon travel books</p>
<p>going down to the basement</p>
<p>pounding like I&rsquo;m in fucking just</p>
<p>and then come up</p>
<p>sweating like a</p>
<p>motherfucker with a name tag on just</p>
<p>and so like 2 weeks</p>
<p>into it my boss Dwayne pulls me aside and he was like</p>
<p>he was like hey man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>spending a lot of time in the basement</p>
<p>and I was like oh yeah</p>
<p>cause I gotta get</p>
<p>travel books and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where we keep them all down there and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah do you know we have</p>
<p>video cameras</p>
<p>oh my God and I was like</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that he was like you&rsquo;re fucking fired</p>
<p>and I was like wow I was like</p>
<p>Dwayne I can explain he goes no</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t have someone getting into</p>
<p>their underwear</p>
<p>in the basement</p>
<p>working out</p>
<p>to when they</p>
<p>should be working and then coming back up</p>
<p>and then interacting with people</p>
<p>and I was trying to be a</p>
<p>comic so I was trying to</p>
<p>think alternatively</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m on speed</p>
<p>which is fucking</p>
<p>so theoretically</p>
<p>like I would do</p>
<p>funny shit but it was</p>
<p>crazy if you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know me exactly</p>
<p>some guy told me the</p>
<p>other day we were doing a</p>
<p>promo shoot for HDTV</p>
<p>and I did a joke at the end of the day</p>
<p>like was that</p>
<p>funny he goes Bert</p>
<p>everything you do is only</p>
<p>funny if you</p>
<p>spent fucking 24</p>
<p>hours with you</p>
<p>and so yeah so I got fired</p>
<p>and then came home</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>great to have that tape if anyone had Barnes</p>
<p>Nobles oh my</p>
<p>God that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>his name was</p>
<p>Dwayne I remember he</p>
<p>asked me if I wanted to be a manager like</p>
<p>a week before that</p>
<p>and I was like no</p>
<p>and he was like what</p>
<p>and I was like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t want to be a manager and I was like no</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like why are you why do you</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>want to do then I was like I want to be a comedian</p>

<p>they want me</p>
<p>escaping I can feel it yeah</p>
<p>a lot of times</p>

<p>think that goes</p>
<p>with everything</p>
<p>even comedy</p>
<p>yeah well sure people are haters man</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way easier for them if you&rsquo;re a failure</p>
<p>way easier for</p>
<p>them if you&rsquo;re not ambitious if you&rsquo;re not like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a guy and</p>
<p>this poor fuck</p>
<p>was like you know he&rsquo;s in his like late thirties and he</p>
<p>smokes cigarettes and he just looked like a broken</p>
<p>dream he had nothing</p>
<p>going on you know</p>
<p>and here he is a dispatch guy for a limousine</p>
<p>thing in Boston</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re dealing with a</p>
<p>bunch of fucking</p>
<p>savages every day</p>
<p>and you know he you see someone who&rsquo;s 21</p>
<p>and just has all these</p>
<p>crazy ideas in</p>
<p>their head and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do this I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be a comedian</p>
<p>and you like see all this energy behind this person all</p>
<p>these do you just want to</p>
<p>squash that</p>
<p>you want to throw</p>
<p>water on that fire</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of people man the last</p>
<p>thing they want</p>
<p>to see is someone with with some sort of a</p>
<p>spark inside of them yeah</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of people man that&rsquo;s terrifying to them</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t want they don&rsquo;t want to see that man</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>see that they want you to fuck up they want you to fail</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t have to compare</p>
<p>compare themselves to you unfavorably</p>
<p>and then start</p>
<p>thinking about what a fucking</p>
<p>disaster their life has been oh yeah</p>
<p>that was everyone that worked to Barnes and</p>
<p>Noble everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>work to Barnes</p>
<p>Nobles broken there was one gay guy who had</p>
<p>come from Iowa and just come out of the</p>
<p>closet like move to New York</p>
<p>and then I think he knew he was gay the</p>
<p>whole time they got to New York and was like</p>

<p>first month</p>
<p>that guy he got fucked out of his</p>
<p>loft one night came back with a</p>
<p>black guy because he fell out a lot</p>
<p>as the guy was fucking him and</p>
<p>pounding him out of the loft wow</p>
<p>this guy fucked non stop at</p>
<p>first that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so great</p>
<p>yeah so he was</p>
<p>in the closet just being awesome</p>
<p>into your sexuality</p>
<p>like to realize you&rsquo;re straight and then</p>
<p>everyone in the straight community</p>
<p>is like let&rsquo;s just fuck this shit out of this guy</p>
<p>yeah that what</p>
<p>happens in the gay community the straight community</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work that way they&rsquo;re not really into you</p>
<p>switching teams</p>

<p>stand out front</p>
<p>and bring in</p>
<p>20 people throughout the night</p>
<p>and then if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still people in the room</p>
<p>after Godfrey goes on I&rsquo;ll let you go up on stage</p>
<p>and so I was like okay</p>
<p>so that night</p>

<p>3 people in 4 people in a Girl named</p>
<p>Karen Burgreen is on stage</p>
<p>4 Puerto Rican guys who I had brought in off the street</p>
<p>who were like one guy was going to prison the next day</p>
<p>or Sid I just brought</p>
<p>anyone I brought a guy in with ice</p>
<p>cream he has groceries and I brought him in I brought</p>
<p>everyone in the club</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sitting in the front row</p>
<p>and they make</p>
<p>Karen Burgreen cry and Louis</p>
<p>they go look karen&rsquo;s crying</p>
<p>and so Louis goes up you want to be a</p>
<p>comic now&rsquo;s your chance</p>
<p>so we went up grab</p>
<p>Karen burger and he goes all right you guys</p>
<p>ready for next comic and brought me on stage and</p>
<p>the only thing if anything that I could do was</p>
<p>light up for Puerto Ricans</p>
<p>and I got on stage and I destroyed these guys wow</p>
<p>one by one by one and when they talk I was be like</p>
<p>listen when it</p>
<p>says in my act the dumb Puerto Rican and rejects I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>point to you</p>
<p>and he and he&rsquo;d be like oh</p>
<p>and the crowd was going nuts</p>
<p>and I was like how</p>
<p>many people in the</p>
<p>crowd besides them I was feeling the fucking</p>
<p>it was everyone that knew me I brought everyone in</p>
<p>it was like fucking a hundred</p>
<p>maybe a hundred people on a</p>
<p>Thursday night and so</p>
<p>they get up</p>
<p>and they leave the</p>
<p>place goes nuts</p>
<p>and this is my</p>
<p>first time on</p>
<p>stage in New York and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>oh I&rsquo;m like on a real</p>
<p>stage you know</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like yes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fucking and then</p>
<p>I was supposed to do a joke and I didn&rsquo;t have any jokes</p>
<p>and I was like fuck I bombed got off stage</p>
<p>and loose was like you got a job</p>
<p>and I was like what he goes come here</p>
<p>every night at</p>
<p>7 unlock the</p>
<p>place sit the</p>
<p>chairs up and</p>
<p>bring in people all</p>
<p>night long and I&rsquo;ll give you a spot</p>
<p>6 months later</p>
<p>literally and this</p>
<p>brings it to Bill Burr</p>
<p>6 months later I get a development deal with Will Smith</p>
<p>do work in the door 6</p>
<p>months later like that and Bill Burr told me was like</p>
<p>it happens don&rsquo;t feel guilty</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s gonna dislike you</p>
<p>but I was like huh</p>
<p>did you get that did you get a lot of resentment yeah</p>
<p>yeah yeah a lot</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t care really because I was like oh you</p>
<p>sound like almost like I mean I love you man but you</p>
<p>sound like almost</p>
<p>like this hapless retard that stumbles upon</p>
<p>success I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>the luckiest</p>
<p>guy in the world</p>
<p>literally but it&rsquo;s not just that it&rsquo;s your personality</p>
<p>is very endearing and interesting and you tell</p>
<p>great stories so it&rsquo;s not just that you&rsquo;re lucky</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just to be you and this is the same</p>
<p>thing when you were talking</p>
<p>about Joey to be Joey</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s you can&rsquo;t be Joey and</p>
<p>market Joey</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like who Joey is is Joey</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s almost like somebody else has to come</p>
<p>along and find what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting about you</p>
<p>yeah you know but the fact that you like kept</p>
<p>going after it</p>
<p>you know and that you</p>
<p>started out in New York</p>
<p>in the Village</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like one of the hardest</p>
<p>places you could ever</p>
<p>start doing</p>
<p>stand up oh yeah I</p>
<p>think if you can</p>
<p>I always assimilate the 2 like</p>
<p>cause then I</p>
<p>moved to LA</p>
<p>so I got a TV show</p>
<p>and and then</p>
<p>tried to an LA and</p>
<p>a comedy in LA and it was just totally different</p>
<p>and I remember</p>
<p>Bobby Kelly came out he</p>
<p>was like I don&rsquo;t fucking I remember bob&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have this fucking witty shit I don&rsquo;t have witty shit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking real I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>comic I&rsquo;m a fucking New York</p>
<p>comic I go up and I talk and</p>
<p>I know he was</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t fuck this witty shit I remember what</p>
<p>do you mean witty</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>he just kept saying fuck this witty shit</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>witty shit I don&rsquo;t have witty</p>
<p>jokes okay what I don&rsquo;t know I remember that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>I remember to sit in the back of the improv with him</p>
<p>look man Joey Diaz</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a witty bone in his body</p>
<p>but yes the funniest shit I&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>heard but Bobby</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to be witty to me I consider the 2 difference I think</p>
<p>both are like working out</p>
<p>but New York is like working out in prison</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like it&rsquo;s just a fucking</p>
<p>steel bar with 2 cinder</p>
<p>blocks and you&rsquo;re just kind of trying to get</p>
<p>sighs So you don&rsquo;t get fucked in the ass in the shower</p>
<p>and LA is like doing like</p>
<p>tybo or like spin class</p>
<p>so you want</p>
<p>good you want to look good you want to look tight</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about getting fucked in the shower cuz</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as bad of course I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never done it at the</p>
<p>store what la la</p>
<p>com New York comedy is like fucking</p>
<p>in your face like</p>
<p>the second you</p>
<p>stand up it&rsquo;s not like an industry</p>
<p>crowd it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>a bunch of fucking Persians that are in</p>
<p>from Iraq and or wherever and then it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>bunch of brothers in from Harlem</p>
<p>some kids from Spanish Harlem and they just like</p>
<p>fucking light you up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little more</p>
<p>aggressive LA is a little more you get up</p>
<p>I remember the first time</p>
<p>I realized I didn&rsquo;t have any joke jokes like</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>start speaking</p>
<p>like I needed to interact with someone cause</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d always do in New York you just I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your act is very organic because</p>
<p>you talk to someone hey</p>
<p>where are you from or</p>
<p>oh how&rsquo;d you</p>
<p>get here I don&rsquo;t know it just seemed like I</p>
<p>never did that even</p>
<p>when I was in New York</p>
<p>it seemed more I</p>
<p>never did that</p>
<p>when I was in New York I just did my act</p>
<p>really yeah I</p>
<p>never talked to the crowd</p>
<p>the only time I&rsquo;d ever talk to the</p>
<p>crowd is if there</p>
<p>was a problem like you have to deal with something</p>
<p>or if someone&rsquo;s just like really outrageous</p>
<p>I saw the guy</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the guy&rsquo;s name who used to do make me laugh</p>
<p>do you remember that</p>
<p>the one on Comedy Central Mark</p>
<p>I have no idea was</p>
<p>on Comedy Central and</p>
<p>Jeff Ross is</p>
<p>always on it I forget the guy&rsquo;s name really he dated</p>
<p>Sarah Silverman this guy</p>
<p>I saw him come to New York one day he was in LA comic</p>
<p>and he got fucking</p>
<p>stole like really</p>
<p>bad and I never seen someone bomb before like that</p>
<p>where he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>come back it was just bits</p>
<p>and he fucking</p>
<p>ate it hard</p>
<p>dude people are</p>
<p>gonna eat it they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna eat it</p>
<p>everywhere but that was everyone</p>
<p>in the club was like that&rsquo;s LA comedy for you yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even it&rsquo;s probably it was uncomfortable</p>
<p>probably uncomfortable and you know</p>
<p>got on stage with</p>
<p>an attitude or felt</p>
<p>weird when he got up there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s half of it man half</p>
<p>of it is being comfortable wherever the fuck you are</p>
<p>which is the best</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>having fans that come to see you having people that</p>
<p>know what you do and they&rsquo;re coming to see you know</p>
<p>I know Burke Kreischer he&rsquo;s hilarious I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to see Burke Kreischer</p>
<p>as opposed to just coming to any club but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you develop your</p>
<p>voice too by doing</p>
<p>those clubs</p>
<p>then you have to always</p>
<p>think that if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>these clubs and no one knows who you</p>
<p>are and you&rsquo;re trying to get them to like you you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a danger of</p>
<p>maybe becoming something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not because you want them to like you you</p>
<p>know because you want to be</p>
<p>more successful like it almost like it hinders</p>
<p>your ability to become yourself on stage</p>
<p>you know what I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about yeah I</p>
<p>think so I mean how many guys have you seen that</p>
<p>do a tell when they go on</p>
<p>stage a lot</p>
<p>a lot right</p>
<p>and why are they doing</p>
<p>it well they&rsquo;re doing it because they know it works</p>
<p>the note works and it&rsquo;s successful</p>
<p>it gives them</p>
<p>a charge when they&rsquo;re in the audience like they</p>
<p>react to his cadence</p>
<p>and then it becomes really catchy</p>
<p>and then you start to</p>
<p>start doing it even almost subconsciously</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just trying to be effective</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just trying to be effective up there</p>
<p>I used to I mean I used to</p>
<p>steal from Mattel</p>
<p>when I was young so I didn&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>write a joke</p>
<p>and you just be like how the fuck</p>
<p>would a tell tell it</p>
<p>right I remember my</p>
<p>first joke was you know what cops hate</p>
<p>when you touch</p>
<p>their faces</p>
<p>and I was just like that&rsquo;s a Nutella</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a Nutella</p>
<p>fucking setup punch</p>
<p>it is yeah oh yeah like</p>
<p>he said that already</p>
<p>no no no no I just always thought that in my head</p>
<p>like oh I see</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying so you imitated him I just</p>
<p>would I would emulate</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;d write a joke I&rsquo;d be like I got a</p>
<p>funny premise</p>
<p>because I was hammered on a flight to Scotland</p>
<p>and a stewardess</p>
<p>was trying to cut me off and I knew she was</p>
<p>cutting me off and I didn&rsquo;t want her to say anything</p>
<p>and so I just went took</p>
<p>my fingers to her lips and I</p>
<p>like I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want her to cut me off and then I got really cut off</p>
<p>this is well before 9 11</p>
<p>and so I told</p>
<p>Patrice that happened and Patrice</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s funny joke</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>second you touch someone&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>you take all</p>
<p>their power away</p>
<p>like you touch someone&rsquo;s face it fucking just</p>
<p>and he was like you</p>
<p>gotta fucking tell it so did you actually</p>
<p>touch your face yeah don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>touch your face I was so drunk</p>
<p>going to Scotland from LA</p>
<p>wow and I just</p>
<p>went so what happened when you touched her face did she</p>
<p>freak out no she just was like</p>
<p>all right you&rsquo;re done you&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>and then and</p>
<p>then served me another beer at the end of the day</p>
<p>like while we were getting a land she gave</p>
<p>me another one really I&rsquo;ve been cut off plans a lot</p>
<p>really you never been cut off on a</p>
<p>plane never</p>
<p>never what&rsquo;s the cutoff amount like</p>
<p>would like you</p>
<p>gotta be obnoxious</p>
<p>for no no no I&rsquo;m not the</p>
<p>least obnoxious</p>
<p>drunk so it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s a number it&rsquo;s for yeah</p>
<p>for they won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>serve you more than 4</p>
<p>drinks is that in first</p>
<p>class as well no</p>
<p>first class is totally different they let you ball</p>
<p>yeah if you put the figure you get control</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pro at it now</p>
<p>yeah number one</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a big</p>
<p>drinker on planes this is how I do it</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t speak</p>
<p>ever speak don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>speak to anyone</p>
<p>just if you want to</p>
<p>drink tap your cup just</p>
<p>dude you&rsquo;re an alcoholic</p>
<p>okay maybe I am you&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>just so that you can get more alcohol</p>
<p>yeah on planes I have a hard time flying</p>
<p>I have fucking massive anxiety flying</p>
<p>you telling us before the show that you have anxiety</p>
<p>right now I have horrible anxiety</p>
<p>yeah cause you seem a little</p>
<p>like revved up</p>
<p>today yeah like you&rsquo;re having a hard time like staying</p>
<p>calm yeah because I</p>
<p>gotta go skydiving on Saturday</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s in the back of my head like</p>
<p>the concept of so is that fucking with you</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>like do you hear it in the back of your head you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going skydiving</p>
<p>no if I got the right</p>
<p>yeah Bird is the only one</p>
<p>right here that&rsquo;s not high so</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not on the same</p>
<p>frequency as</p>
<p>Brian and I</p>
<p>Yeah I would totally</p>
<p>have you ever gone skydiving</p>
<p>no I&rsquo;m not really into</p>
<p>dying like that if</p>
<p>you would I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;d be fun as fuck</p>
<p>but you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I know 2 people</p>
<p>that know people that have died including Brian</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s dad was supposed to go skydiving with this</p>
<p>woman and yeah she flattened out</p>
<p>boom hit the ground</p>
<p>you know another</p>
<p>thing I heard</p>
<p>too that I don&rsquo;t know if this is true or not I</p>
<p>think we already talked</p>
<p>about this but like how when you&rsquo;re skydiving</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to breathe</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so much air</p>
<p>so the whole time you&rsquo;re just going</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re just trying to breathe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re focusing so much on</p>
<p>brains starting to sweat</p>
<p>yeah no it&rsquo;s just really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bring up how hard this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sweating like a pig</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>sweating man I&rsquo;m really sweating</p>
<p>right now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking about it</p>
<p>it is hot in here yeah</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s not that hot in here you guys are both fat</p>
<p>I will definitely</p>
<p>see what&rsquo;s going on right here</p>
<p>so you really knew someone who died skydiving</p>
<p>yeah yeah I knew</p>
<p>someone else</p>
<p>from some friends of mine in Houston</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>bunch of guys that skydived and</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the guy he told me his friend died</p>
<p>and then brian&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s 2 the 2 is enough was he tandem</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know what happened I</p>
<p>think he was solo</p>
<p>you know a thousand people that probably died in</p>
<p>or knew people</p>
<p>that died in car accidents though but you</p>
<p>still drive a car</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>a thousand people that have died in car accidents</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Jesus Christ</p>
<p>I mean like family and NASCAR</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going by like person that knows somebody that died</p>
<p>you know like it likes</p>
<p>you have friends</p>
<p>that know somebody that died in skydiving and</p>
<p>what would be the difference probably</p>
<p>what are you talking about</p>
<p>what would be the difference between</p>
<p>those 2 skydives to get to work A</p>
<p>and B You don&rsquo;t skydive</p>
<p>every fucking</p>
<p>day of your life</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;m not not skydiving because of</p>
<p>people dying and that&rsquo;s the last thing really</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the first thing I&rsquo;m thinking of one</p>
<p>more thing I would feel</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m pulling that</p>
<p>thing and the</p>
<p>parachutes not coming out and I see that barn</p>
<p>and I know I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna make a fucking</p>
<p>Scooby Doo hole through it</p>
<p>the shape of my body with my outstretched arms</p>
<p>boom and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna hit the hay</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll turn into a bag of jello and broken bones</p>
<p>splat and basically just inside your helmet</p>
<p>is all just broken</p>
<p>smashing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be fine but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna suck the height</p>
<p>things are you scared of heights</p>
<p>yeah me too but you&rsquo;ve been on roller coaster</p>
<p>stuff you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be strapped</p>
<p>into somebody else also a professional hopefully I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go tell well you must</p>
<p>be you have to you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just do it on your</p>
<p>first time they don&rsquo;t want you to</p>
<p>panic and just</p>
<p>just shut off</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>stressing about that like</p>
<p>crazy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>freaking me out oh</p>
<p>fucking nightmare</p>
<p>this show is a real mind fuck for you because you</p>
<p>have to do a lot of dangerous shit on this show yeah</p>
<p>we were doing a concrete toboggan race</p>
<p>where you get a 300</p>
<p>pound concrete toboggan</p>
<p>put 5 kids in it</p>
<p>and then you race it down a mountain</p>
<p>against another team who has a</p>
<p>or 300 pound</p>
<p>concrete toboggan</p>
<p>what and you go 40</p>
<p>miles per hour no steering</p>
<p>and you just</p>
<p>fly down a fucking mountain how do you stop it</p>
<p>they have brakes they have brakes</p>
<p>it depends on</p>
<p>where your brakes are</p>
<p>on the thing</p>
<p>you may just fucking flip it oh</p>
<p>Jesus it depends</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a nightmare</p>
<p>the 2 people before us the</p>
<p>group before us guy goes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve ragdoll it they hit a berm</p>
<p>ragdoll it dude</p>
<p>breaks his femur</p>
<p>girl breaks her arm in 2</p>
<p>places and all the bones in her hand</p>
<p>and then they go are you</p>
<p>ready and I was like what my cameraman&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>dude a broken femur is a game changer</p>
<p>it is it&rsquo;s a life changer</p>
<p>fuck yeah people</p>
<p>lose their legs sometimes because they</p>
<p>when they try to reattach it</p>
<p>put the femur back together</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get a</p>
<p>blood supply going</p>
<p>so it gets gangrene</p>
<p>people lose</p>
<p>their legs from femurs</p>
<p>but yeah that was like one of the</p>
<p>things I mean we went</p>
<p>shovel racing in New Mexico</p>
<p>do you know what I mean</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that you just sit on a shovel</p>
<p>and go down a mountain at 70</p>
<p>miles an hour</p>
<p>Jesus Christ just sit on a</p>
<p>shovel and then just</p>
<p>and hope you don&rsquo;t die</p>
<p>and just sit back like this how</p>
<p>fast we going</p>
<p>I definitely didn&rsquo;t get 70</p>
<p>but guys are</p>
<p>going 72 7070</p>
<p>miles an hour on a</p>
<p>shovel on a</p>
<p>shovel no brakes what</p>
<p>kind of hill are you dealing with</p>
<p>here a fucking blue slope</p>
<p>like on a blue</p>
<p>slope on ski</p>
<p>it goes yeah blue diamond it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it goes green blue and black</p>
<p>and want a blue one that&rsquo;s like been</p>
<p>shaved and like salted</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>and you just are flying so that noise</p>
<p>basically the lose</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s exactly like a lose</p>
<p>and but but with less</p>
<p>like less control because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a shovel and</p>
<p>the rods just</p>
<p>sticking between your legs</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned a lot</p>
<p>about myself with anxiety through this show</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve learned 1t</p>
<p>but I still</p>
<p>I I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>dictated by my anxiety</p>
<p>like in what way</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s certain foods I won&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>cause I know it&rsquo;ll fuck with me in the middle of the</p>
<p>night I would just wake up and have an anxiety attack</p>
<p>certain foods</p>
<p>trigger anxiety</p>
<p>my stomach my stomach</p>
<p>dictates my anxiety it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>heart palpitations like some foods like onions and</p>
<p>stuff I know</p>
<p>makes my heart beat a little</p>
<p>crazy here and there for me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spicy foods</p>
<p>with spicy foods too</p>
<p>onions make your</p>
<p>heart beat weird</p>
<p>spicy food like the</p>
<p>other night when</p>
<p>my shit was all jacked up from eating</p>
<p>those jalapenos a</p>
<p>stuffed jalapeno oh I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fuck with jalapenos yeah</p>
<p>it fucks it fucks my stomach up</p>
<p>which then fucks my heart up</p>
<p>which makes me like</p>
<p>fucking like</p>
<p>conscious of my</p>
<p>heart and then I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>freaking out</p>
<p>whoa yeah you don&rsquo;t get any anxiety</p>
<p>not about that stuff</p>
<p>was have you ever had an anxiety attack no</p>
<p>never no it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>like really</p>
<p>weird here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>wait a minute it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>weird to not have an anxiety attack no I mean</p>
<p>like most people I thought always had like I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s true at all</p>
<p>like you were saying I&rsquo;ve had some</p>
<p>let me clarify I&rsquo;ve had some</p>
<p>paranoid moments on weed for sure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had some moments but I</p>
<p>think those are very important I think</p>
<p>those are the ones that make you reevaluate yourself</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like I like</p>
<p>those I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>like knowing myself I like being scared as fuck when</p>
<p>it comes to</p>
<p>that because</p>
<p>no no no no it&rsquo;s not anxiety because I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>panicking I&rsquo;m just terribly terribly</p>
<p>terribly aware of</p>
<p>everything and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a panic attack it&rsquo;s just an acceptance of the</p>
<p>whole picture</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never where I don&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>I can handle it or I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>freak out or my</p>
<p>heart&rsquo;s beating too fast</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the humbling aware</p>
<p>feeling and</p>
<p>awareness of the big</p>
<p>picture you know</p>
<p>I like that</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important that</p>
<p>people take drugs to get away from that feeling not</p>
<p>me man I go into it I run into it that&rsquo;s what the tank</p>
<p>is the tank accentuates any feeling that you&rsquo;ve get</p>
<p>have you ever been too high and like</p>
<p>freaked out</p>
<p>I go in the tank when I&rsquo;m too high</p>
<p>the higher I get</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the more I want to get in the tank</p>
<p>because you face it and</p>
<p>you come out of it and you always</p>
<p>learn something always</p>
<p>I always know more</p>
<p>about myself</p>
<p>I always know</p>
<p>whether I&rsquo;m on the</p>
<p>right track as far as like you know</p>
<p>is there anything in my subconscious</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking with me</p>
<p>is there anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bothering</p>
<p>me yeah yeah yeah I go</p>
<p>right in there man</p>
<p>see I&rsquo;ll obsess</p>
<p>about anything</p>
<p>if you can if</p>
<p>you can give me if you can give me something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mull it</p>
<p>over my head like when I jump off the stratosphere</p>
<p>I literally</p>
<p>was up the night before</p>
<p>throwing up in a bathtub</p>
<p>right but do</p>
<p>you feel like you making progress with all this</p>
<p>crazy critical yes</p>
<p>I am I&rsquo;m definitely making progress</p>
<p>but like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>definitely making progress right</p>
<p>but I still</p>
<p>I think the stratosphere by the way is</p>
<p>gonna be a lot scarier than skydiving</p>
<p>really yeah because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to see</p>
<p>like a kind of like a</p>
<p>point of distance or I mean like ain&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>crazy nobody died on the</p>
<p>stratosphere someone</p>
<p>said skydiving is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so far removed from what the distance is</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>freak you out</p>
<p>right what no that</p>
<p>makes total</p>
<p>sense I mean if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>standing on top of a really tall</p>
<p>building you can fucking</p>
<p>see that you&rsquo;re really high up because you can see</p>
<p>other things at the same</p>
<p>level or below or higher</p>
<p>so it gives you more of</p>
<p>an idea that you&rsquo;re really high up</p>
<p>reference point</p>
<p>you know plane</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s high but it&rsquo;s also like almost like</p>
<p>cartoony fake like</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re retarded</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know man to me it looks like a goddamn</p>
<p>plane flying 30 000 fucking feet above the</p>
<p>earth he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>going 16 it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna take a long time to hit the ground 16 000</p>
<p>so you hit the ground quite</p>
<p>twice as quick</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one of those</p>
<p>planes that just falls from the sky</p>
<p>every now and then</p>
<p>those skydiver</p>
<p>planes what kind of a fucking</p>
<p>plane can you</p>
<p>open up a door in the middle of the flight yeah right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a drug</p>
<p>plane right I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be fine</p>
<p>those are drug</p>
<p>planes man if the</p>
<p>pilot has a mustache you</p>
<p>might be screwed so</p>
<p>drug planes</p>
<p>crash all the time dude you ever see that one that</p>
<p>crashed in Mexico</p>
<p>4t of cocaine</p>
<p>inside of it that ran out yes</p>
<p>CIA plane CIA</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking one of the</p>
<p>greatest stories of all time CIA</p>
<p>plane headed</p>
<p>went to Guantanamo Bay</p>
<p>on 2 separate occasions</p>
<p>clearly a CIA</p>
<p>plane 4t of cocaine in it</p>
<p>crashes in Mexico</p>
<p>Mexicans won&rsquo;t let them refill</p>
<p>cause they know what the fuck they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>by the way Portland</p>
<p>was fucking amazing have you been to Portland</p>
<p>actually he was saying that I</p>
<p>wanna I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>this year I just don&rsquo;t know well they</p>
<p>Portland didn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>major comedy club</p>
<p>for the longest time so it was hard for</p>
<p>comics to tour through Portland</p>
<p>but then they just put this helium place in</p>
<p>I done Portland before I did a theater there and it was</p>
<p>great but this was really fun because we got to do</p>
<p>3 nights you know 5 shows over 3 nights</p>
<p>everything sold</p>
<p>out way in advance it was all podcast fans</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s the thing that</p>
<p>Brian and I&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about a lot lately and I was talking</p>
<p>with you about in the kitchen</p>
<p>everything has</p>
<p>changed it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely different</p>
<p>you know the people</p>
<p>that are coming to shows are way more enthusiastic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way different you know they know you better it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a crazy experience man</p>
<p>do you feel like you have more of a chance to riff on</p>
<p>stage than you used to</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know man i&rsquo;ve been cutting my my sets down</p>
<p>an hour and ten minutes and</p>
<p>just you just you guys</p>
<p>something one podcast that made me that re</p>
<p>made me reevaluate</p>
<p>everything i do on</p>
<p>stage yeah but</p>
<p>50 minutes someone</p>
<p>said 50 minutes jim norton</p>
<p>did that norton</p>
<p>did 50 i saw him do 50 in austin and</p>
<p>he made me think</p>
<p>because i do a lot of i was doing a lot of long sets</p>
<p>where i do this question and answer</p>
<p>thing at the end</p>
<p>but the problem with the question and answer</p>
<p>thing is that</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the same pop as the regular show and so the show always</p>
<p>would kind of end on some</p>
<p>weird note like i&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>crushing for</p>
<p>an hour and then i&rsquo;d do this question and answer</p>
<p>thing for an hour and then people</p>
<p>would be tired so</p>
<p>the experience of a show was not the same</p>
<p>you know and i thought i was</p>
<p>just giving him more show i thought i was being more</p>
<p>generous and giving him</p>
<p>more show but i realized the best way to do it really</p>
<p>is to give him an</p>
<p>hour hour and</p>
<p>10 max and just</p>
<p>smash it just come out of the gates gun</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing that for like the last people getting</p>
<p>standing ohs</p>
<p>those last all</p>
<p>those shows in portland i</p>
<p>mean instead of like because i saw it to it kind</p>
<p>of like a fizzle it was it just kind of like shows over</p>
<p>now here&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>other thing</p>
<p>and then people forgot</p>
<p>about the show they were</p>
<p>kind of doing exactly</p>
<p>and it was just</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s just like fucking roaring you know</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>want to come back they&rsquo;re telling all</p>
<p>their friends immediately</p>
<p>instead of going oh yeah it was good last</p>
<p>night yeah they were all</p>
<p>standing ovations</p>
<p>it was awesome</p>
<p>portland was fucking awesome</p>
<p>never had a</p>
<p>place where people handed me more weed</p>
<p>never dude i</p>
<p>dunk of weed when i got home i was wearing the same</p>
<p>pants that i wore the show</p>

<p>women that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>women like more than anything is a guy that can</p>
<p>be himself that&rsquo;s why she knows who the fuck you are</p>
<p>instead of you</p>
<p>going out and pretending to be some different person</p>
<p>no matter where the fuck you go</p>
<p>women know when they can</p>
<p>count on you</p>
<p>they know when they can</p>
<p>count here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>silly stash not the tent exactly</p>
<p>go fucking porn</p>
<p>style a big</p>
<p>big fucking</p>
<p>twisty one so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a list that just got</p>
<p>released talking</p>
<p>about checking you at the airport because this</p>
<p>is amazing it&rsquo;s the department of homeland security</p>
<p>and they put out this</p>
<p>the following characteristics it qualifies a person for</p>
<p>potential domestic terrorist</p>
<p>and i put this shit on my twitter because it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>ridiculous expressions of</p>
<p>libertarian philosophies</p>
<p>bumper stickers or</p>
<p>statements like you</p>
<p>might be a fucking</p>
<p>potential domestic terrorist</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>think that people</p>
<p>should be able to do whatever they want to do</p>
<p>you think that</p>
<p>libertarian</p>
<p>ideology is better than republican or</p>
<p>democratic ideology</p>
<p>amazing you have a bumper</p>
<p>sticker so you</p>
<p>might be a domestic terrorist</p>
<p>if this was just some</p>
<p>crazy asshole that ran some website</p>
<p>some right wing website but this is like</p>
<p>giving people instructions look out for</p>
<p>second amendment oriented views nra</p>
<p>or gun club membership</p>
<p>jesus fucking christ</p>
<p>what you can&rsquo;t go hunting if</p>
<p>you want to</p>
<p>shoot your own meat</p>
<p>instead of getting it from some fucking</p>
<p>slaughterhouse</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a potential domestic terrorist</p>
<p>because you believe in the rights</p>
<p>to keep guns</p>
<p>you think that</p>
<p>adults should be able to have guns just like</p>
<p>adults can have</p>
<p>fucking cars okay just like</p>
<p>adults can have a lot of shit that can fuck you up</p>
<p>yeah people</p>
<p>should have guns</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re here so</p>
<p>a you can shoot people that are bad</p>
<p>and b you can</p>
<p>shoot animals and eat them okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a fucking potential terrorist</p>
<p>issue i would</p>
<p>almost say i</p>
<p>would argue there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>connection between people who own guns and terrorism</p>
<p>hmm i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that i</p>
<p>would say almost a</p>
<p>hundred percent</p>
<p>i mean the guys that</p>
<p>fucking flew</p>
<p>planes in 911</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just because they couldn&rsquo;t get guns on board</p>
<p>no no check</p>
<p>guns exactly but what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the connection</p>
<p>where do you</p>
<p>draw connection between</p>
<p>someone who owns a gun well</p>
<p>the idea is that people want to</p>
<p>overthrow the government you know so they&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking well</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about people who</p>
<p>rise the fuck up and realize this goddamn corrupt</p>
<p>government that&rsquo;s running this country</p>
<p>needs to be held accountable for all</p>
<p>their bullshit</p>
<p>i finally finished</p>
<p>watching that inside job last night</p>
<p>fuck i had to turn it off the last time i</p>
<p>watched it i</p>
<p>watched it for an hour and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>angry for no reason and i had to shut it off</p>
<p>but i finally</p>
<p>watched it all last night</p>
<p>it is maddening it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about the financial collapse it&rsquo;s not inside job</p>
<p>you hear like that you</p>
<p>think 9 11 it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about 9 11 it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about the financial collapse</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>interviewing all</p>
<p>these economists</p>
<p>and all these people that didn&rsquo;t predict it all</p>
<p>these people that fucking profit from it</p>
<p>and it talks</p>
<p>about one of the most disturbing</p>
<p>things is how corrupt</p>
<p>economics has become the</p>
<p>study of economics at</p>
<p>the university</p>
<p>level because all</p>
<p>these fucking guys who are</p>
<p>teaching economics at harvard</p>
<p>and columbia</p>
<p>they all wind up working for the presidents they all</p>
<p>wind up working for governments and they wind up</p>
<p>going on these speaking</p>
<p>engagements</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re making millions of dollars</p>
<p>and they showed this like how fucked it is</p>
<p>that everyone is just</p>
<p>stealing and everyone is getting</p>
<p>away with it because everyone is protecting everyone</p>
<p>everyone is making</p>
<p>sure that no one has held accountable for all this</p>
<p>fucking incredible movie man</p>

<p>see how fucked up this country is and how fucked up the</p>
<p>unfixable foundation of this country is the financial</p>
<p>foundation of this country it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nuts it is amazing that it works at all</p>
<p>and these motherfuckers that got</p>
<p>bonuses man</p>
<p>just the brazen</p>
<p>ash holishness</p>
<p>to ask for hundreds of millions of dollars</p>
<p>in the middle of a</p>
<p>gigantic financial collapse you were at</p>
<p>least partially</p>
<p>responsible</p>
<p>for and the fact that nobody holds them to the fire</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nuts man it is one</p>
<p>of the nuttiest documentaries i&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life</p>
<p>wow this guy who&rsquo;s running the documentary</p>
<p>too he&rsquo;s asking some of the questions one of the guys</p>
<p>and he catches a lot of</p>
<p>these guys like one of the guys that worked</p>
<p>for bush and you</p>
<p>know he was</p>
<p>an economic</p>
<p>advisor for bush and he&rsquo;s also for</p>
<p>the thing he believe he</p>
<p>teaches at harvard</p>
<p>and they caught this guy and they were</p>
<p>talking to him and asking him questions and you see</p>
<p>the frustration when they&rsquo;re hitting him with</p>
<p>logic and facts and like how</p>
<p>could you not know and then</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hitting him with all this information</p>
<p>about things that he said and how</p>
<p>wrong it was</p>
<p>how did you</p>
<p>think that this economy was</p>
<p>stable why did you</p>
<p>think that these</p>
<p>funds should be</p>
<p>rated at double a</p>
<p>meanwhile they</p>
<p>crashed the very next day</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s just nuts man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>stealing it&rsquo;s incredible it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>everyone is</p>
<p>stealing so it seems like</p>
<p>they can get away with it and they can keep doing it</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s asking for anybody to be held accountable</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really weird man</p>
<p>i mean we&rsquo;re in the middle of like a</p>
<p>giant trillion dollar heist</p>
<p>and these bankers have</p>
<p>literally ripped off everyone</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the most incredible things i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really explained in detail</p>
<p>when they talk</p>
<p>about it from the</p>
<p>point of the</p>
<p>stock market and</p>
<p>where people were banking on</p>
<p>things to fail yet selling them</p>
<p>and promoting them with</p>
<p>their clients</p>
<p>wow it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s amazing i mean you have to</p>
<p>watch it like five or six times i</p>
<p>think to really</p>
<p>wrap your head around how fucking complex it all is</p>
<p>because the the</p>
<p>whole financial</p>
<p>system is it&rsquo;s almost intangible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing there like as you get deeper and deeper</p>
<p>into and try to figure you try to pick something up</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing to grab</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>weird man but it</p>
<p>drives me fucking nuts</p>
<p>if the movies any indication</p>
<p>of this conversation i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;d be lost within the five</p>
<p>first five minutes</p>
<p>yeah i can i try to</p>
<p>always have a six year olds</p>
<p>intelligent</p>
<p>intelligent</p>
<p>like span of listening to shit</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just so i&rsquo;m just so fucking</p>
<p>have frustrated a reader</p>
<p>yeah pretty much yeah like as a kid did you read</p>
<p>yeah i never fucking read really</p>
<p>never first book i ever read was</p>
<p>like really</p>
<p>read like bought it and and for myself and said i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna read it</p>
<p>was naked and</p>
<p>by david sedoris</p>
<p>well i used to read</p>
<p>when i was a kid i used to read a lot of fiction</p>
<p>and then i started doing martial</p>
<p>arts i read a lot of martial arts books you know</p>
<p>i read a lot of books on strategy like you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where i first read</p>
<p>the book of five rings</p>
<p>which became like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>tattoo that i have this is miyamoto musashi</p>
<p>fighting a tiger</p>
<p>and the reason one of the reasons why i got that</p>
<p>tattoo is cause</p>
<p>i read something when i was a little kid</p>
<p>that really</p>
<p>sunk into my head</p>
<p>once you understand the way</p>
<p>broadly you can see it in all</p>
<p>things is what</p>
<p>he said and the idea is that once you find</p>
<p>greatness in anything whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>painting or</p>
<p>sculpture or</p>
<p>music when you find</p>
<p>something you just nail it you get to the core of it</p>
<p>you understand what</p>
<p>greatness is and you can see it in</p>
<p>everything you can see it not just in</p>
<p>your chosen</p>
<p>field but in</p>
<p>everything and it really is like a way of</p>
<p>you know of channeling brilliance and it made me</p>
<p>think that as i was a kid that if i just really</p>
<p>threw myself into martial arts i</p>
<p>could be successful at life</p>
<p>because even if it wasn&rsquo;t martial arts that i</p>
<p>wound up pursuing</p>
<p>there would</p>
<p>if i could get</p>
<p>greatness if i</p>
<p>could really figure out what</p>
<p>greatness is if i</p>
<p>could really</p>
<p>understand the way really tap into it</p>
<p>i could transfer that on to my life</p>
<p>which has actually been true</p>
<p>do you think you&rsquo;re better at comedy or martial arts</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know man and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never even thought about it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even something that i</p>
<p>would think</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re better at whatever</p>
<p>you put the most attention to no but it&rsquo;s really that</p>
<p>simple like the</p>
<p>first time like i was a big baseball player growing up</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>playing baseball with guys that went on to go pro</p>
<p>like i caught brad radke</p>
<p>who was a pitcher for the twins</p>
<p>and i remember</p>
<p>playing baseball with them all growing up and the way</p>
<p>the parents looked at him playing baseball i remember</p>
<p>thinking like no one looks at me like that and</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s like pulling me aside like</p>
<p>hey great gamer</p>
<p>day pert like i</p>
<p>still made all stars and i</p>
<p>still got recruited to play</p>
<p>like at a high</p>
<p>school but i</p>
<p>never had the i</p>
<p>never had that it that</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>first time i did</p>
<p>stand up i was like okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the it like i got that it</p>
<p>this is what</p>
<p>the similarity</p>
<p>for me it&rsquo;s probably just the opposite</p>
<p>really when i</p>
<p>first started doing comedy</p>
<p>and i was leaving martial arts i was really</p>
<p>good at martial arts and not good at comedy at all</p>
<p>and i had to</p>
<p>reinvent myself because</p>
<p>as a martial artist i was</p>
<p>a four time massachusetts</p>
<p>state taekwondo champion</p>
<p>i won the us open</p>
<p>i came in second</p>
<p>place in the us cup to the current national</p>
<p>champion who fought in the olympics</p>
<p>and i was right there</p>
<p>and i was really</p>
<p>young i was 20 19 at the time</p>
<p>and then 21</p>
<p>i had a couple</p>
<p>fights i started kickboxing when i was 21</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what fucked up everything</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the reasons why i stopped competing is because i</p>
<p>started realizing that there was a</p>
<p>bunch of holes in my martial arts game</p>
<p>because i was just doing one</p>
<p>style of martial</p>
<p>art which was taekwondo</p>
<p>and when i switched from taekwondo to boxing</p>
<p>and kickboxing i realized there&rsquo;s big holes in my game</p>
<p>and then so then it made me</p>
<p>not respect</p>
<p>taekwondo as much as an</p>
<p>individual martial art</p>
<p>and then competing in taekwondo</p>
<p>seems sort of</p>
<p>ridiculous to me</p>
<p>because well now i know</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m vulnerable to punches</p>
<p>so now in my mind i</p>
<p>would have to</p>
<p>start kickboxing because</p>
<p>otherwise i</p>
<p>would be practicing something that wasn&rsquo;t as effective</p>
<p>so then i started</p>
<p>kickboxing and i realized okay there&rsquo;s not even any</p>
<p>money in this what the fuck am i doing</p>
<p>you know what am i</p>
<p>gonna do i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>run a kickboxing gym</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna have</p>
<p>brain damage</p>
<p>i was looking at my future and i was like i</p>
<p>gotta figure out what the fuck i&rsquo;m doing to you</p>
<p>i was 21 and i was</p>
<p>jesus doing</p>
<p>comedy at the</p>
<p>same time don&rsquo;t have that kind of insight at 21</p>
<p>keep going keep going well</p>
<p>mostly because no one raised me</p>
<p>no one cares this time</p>
<p>left in the streets like</p>
<p>a wolf i mean my parents both worked and by the time</p>
<p>they got home it was six o&rsquo;clock and</p>
<p>i was over at a friend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house or something i was a</p>
<p>wild kid did you own laundry</p>
<p>yeah it was a different time man</p>
<p>when i was little man i was like</p>
<p>seven years old i used to do a fisherman&rsquo;s wharf i used</p>
<p>to in san francisco i used to have my own magic show</p>
<p>i used to walk</p>
<p>down the street</p>
<p>by myself with my own</p>
<p>thing i was</p>
<p>thinking of</p>
<p>seven or eight</p>
<p>and i had like a little</p>
<p>magic show that i got for christmas and i would put</p>
<p>a fucking hat on and a cape and i&rsquo;d set up a</p>
<p>stand that i</p>
<p>would do a show</p>
<p>by myself no friends no one with me</p>
<p>completely by myself</p>
<p>this is a different world</p>
<p>that people</p>
<p>lived in back then you can&rsquo;t let a fucking</p>
<p>eight year old out of the</p>
<p>house by themselves</p>
<p>today that kid&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get raped</p>
<p>and killed too bad you didn&rsquo;t know little joey</p>
<p>diaz at the time i know i wish</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for you</p>
<p>we were good buddies we</p>
<p>would have had a fucking awesome show joey and i</p>
<p>would have been best friends from the moment we met</p>
<p>i was best friends with joey the moment i met him</p>
<p>i would have</p>
<p>been best friends with joey if we met when we were six</p>
<p>so now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so so i realized</p>
<p>i had thrown my</p>
<p>whole life into martial arts from the time i was 15</p>
<p>until i was 21</p>
<p>but when i was 20 i started</p>
<p>teaching at this</p>
<p>place in revere</p>
<p>there was a nautilus</p>
<p>fitness place in revere</p>
<p>and they had a big</p>
<p>extra side room it was a really big nice room so we</p>
<p>started teaching</p>
<p>taekwondo there and i opened my own branch of the</p>
<p>j kim taekwondo institute out there and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where i met this guy joe lake who was a boxing</p>
<p>coach and he&rsquo;s coached</p>
<p>some ufc guys like marcus</p>
<p>davis and he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>you know it was really really good boxing</p>
<p>coach and a</p>
<p>great guy and he became one of my good friends</p>
<p>and he taught me how to box</p>
<p>when i started boxing i</p>
<p>started realizing like man i&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>all these holes in my fucking martial arts game</p>
<p>like at taekwondo</p>
<p>i was really good at taekwondo but you added in</p>
<p>boxing and then</p>
<p>eventually leg kicks and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like man i got a lot of fucking flaws in my game</p>
<p>so it made me</p>
<p>not want to ever compete in taekwondo</p>
<p>again and then</p>
<p>since there was so much work to do to become</p>
<p>a competent</p>
<p>kickboxer and then it was like well what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do become</p>
<p>a boxer because if i become a boxer now i&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>starting almost from scratch</p>
<p>i mean i&rsquo;m a rudimentary almost you know</p>
<p>beginner boxer and then i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna what am i</p>
<p>gonna start</p>
<p>fighting in that way because that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>place i could get fights</p>
<p>because you couldn&rsquo;t even get boxing or kickboxing</p>
<p>fights in massachusetts</p>
<p>we had to drive to rhode island to fight</p>
<p>so the last time i fought i fought</p>
<p>three times</p>
<p>in one day i fought in a kickboxing tournament</p>
<p>i won the first</p>
<p>fight i knocked the</p>
<p>first guy out</p>
<p>beat the second guy up</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>third guy knocked me out the</p>
<p>third guy was like</p>
<p>three fights</p>
<p>and i was completely exhausted it was</p>
<p>hours later</p>
<p>this is all for free</p>
<p>and i got i won the</p>
<p>first round</p>
<p>and then i got clipped with a left hook</p>
<p>and it was really</p>
<p>weird because it didn&rsquo;t even hurt</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just my legs stopped working it</p>
<p>never happened to me before in a</p>
<p>fight is that the ones</p>
<p>where they go like this they go</p>
<p>just go rubber</p>
<p>they just stopped working</p>
<p>he disconnected</p>
<p>my brain from my legs</p>
<p>my legs no longer communicated with my brain</p>
<p>they just shut off</p>
<p>and i went down and i got up</p>
<p>and then he hit me</p>
<p>again i went down</p>
<p>again i got up and they stopped the</p>
<p>fight it was</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been hit way harder before</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t that he just hit me perfect it was like the</p>
<p>perfect spot and i was exhausted</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>i had shitty</p>
<p>nutrition and i was delivering newspapers i&rsquo;d get up</p>
<p>every morning</p>
<p>at 5 o&rsquo;clock to deliver newspapers and then i</p>
<p>would take a nap</p>
<p>and then i would</p>
<p>drive limos and then i</p>
<p>would go train</p>
<p>and then i was</p>
<p>still trying to do comedy at the same time</p>
<p>so that made me really realize i had to pick a path</p>
<p>and like you know this was a good wake up call for me</p>
<p>and my ego wanted me to get back in there</p>
<p>and go smash and</p>
<p>show that it was a bad</p>
<p>that i really</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t train</p>
<p>right for that</p>
<p>fight and i was out of</p>
<p>shape and i was sick</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>i thankfully</p>
<p>figured out a way to shut my ego up</p>
<p>long enough to get some distance</p>
<p>your ego&rsquo;s fucked my</p>
<p>ego&rsquo;s fucked in what way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s attached to shit that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>like in what way</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>starting to see the</p>
<p>world a little differently</p>
<p>recently last conversation we had i we</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d said something</p>
<p>about i almost got over</p>
<p>i talked about almost getting into a</p>
<p>fight with a guy in</p>
<p>driving remember</p>
<p>yes and you&rsquo;re like that&rsquo;s fucking out of you</p>
<p>yeah dumb in the</p>
<p>world and i know</p>
<p>that and that</p>
<p>to me was the</p>
<p>first wake up call of like</p>
<p>yeah why would i do that like i started</p>
<p>thinking like</p>
<p>the guy just</p>
<p>from our conversation you</p>
<p>start thinking yeah</p>
<p>oh are you yeah fucking actually fairly heavily except</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably one of</p>
<p>i mean this you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want to hear this but like i</p>
<p>probably one of the</p>
<p>toughest guys i i know</p>
<p>like stuff like no one would ever</p>
<p>scare you or you know</p>
<p>how people scare me</p>
<p>no but but i work</p>
<p>in ufc i&rsquo;m constantly around people</p>
<p>scary but what i&rsquo;m saying is like</p>
<p>and so i started like</p>
<p>checking like</p>
<p>okay why do you feel so confident to</p>
<p>start fights</p>
<p>against one eye</p>
<p>where is that and then i</p>
<p>started and then it</p>
<p>started like sizzling down and it was like</p>
<p>holy shit man my ego</p>
<p>my ego&rsquo;s totally attached</p>
<p>to not like cool shit</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not attached to my i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know what an ego</p>
<p>should be attached to do</p>

<p>these people to lose</p>
<p>their houses</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>picture of myself strangling them and just getting so</p>
<p>enraged it almost becomes like an animal</p>

<p>tyson&rsquo;s body</p>

<p>guy looks like he&rsquo;s designed to destroy</p>
<p>things just designed to</p>
<p>like when he used to step into the ring</p>
<p>when he was in</p>
<p>the prime of his life in the late 80s</p>
<p>he would get into that fucking ring</p>
<p>and it was like that is the scariest</p>
<p>human being that&rsquo;s ever walked the face of the earth</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t imagine doing anything</p>
<p>else that&rsquo;s what he was there for he&rsquo;s there to</p>
<p>smash things just a tank</p>
<p>yeah bull that guy guaranteed he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>giant biological</p>
<p>build up of stress that he</p>

<p>interesting so you can almost say that the body</p>
<p>dictates a personality it does have some</p>
<p>effect it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a completely</p>
<p>benign thing</p>
<p>i think without a</p>
<p>doubt look i</p>
<p>think so much</p>
<p>clearer after i work out</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s like mandatory</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t allow myself to say oh fuck i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>tired let me just take a nap i don&rsquo;t allow that</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t like me when i don&rsquo;t work out</p>
<p>so i make me work out i make me work out so i can be</p>
<p>sane it&rsquo;s for me it&rsquo;s like</p>

<p>monkey out of the cage he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna throw shit at me and he&rsquo;s</p>

<p>start rattling the cage and</p>
<p>lighting things on fire</p>
<p>just let him out of the cage come on</p>

<p>the same way i feel like</p>
<p>about my dogs</p>
<p>i feel bad if i don&rsquo;t walk my dogs</p>
<p>if i don&rsquo;t take him around the neighborhood let him go</p>
<p>smell i want him to get out let&rsquo;s get out let&rsquo;s get out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing with the</p>
<p>animal inside you the animal inside you need</p>
<p>though that</p>
<p>motherfucker needs to rage</p>
<p>and if it doesn&rsquo;t rage</p>
<p>starts looking for opportunities to rage</p>

<p>sudden you like this guy really</p>

<p>fuck i&rsquo;ve had so many</p>
<p>crazy people in my life of course</p>

<p>every time you make</p>
<p>so listen man last time you were here there&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>story about the russian mob</p>
<p>we tease these bitches</p>
<p>we let these people</p>
<p>right now on twitter they have been</p>
<p>going crazy all day do not let burkechrisher</p>
<p>get out of there without the russian mob story man</p>
<p>tell us what the fuck happened</p>
<p>alright this is in 1993 probably</p>
<p>i think is when i went to russia</p>
<p>i was taking russian</p>
<p>classes at florida</p>
<p>state i thought they were spanish classes</p>
<p>because i thought</p>
<p>i thought there were spanish</p>
<p>classes because i it was a noon</p>
<p>class and i signed up</p>
<p>and then i was like fucking</p>
<p>sweet spanish at noon</p>
<p>i could phone that in and then i get there and they</p>
<p>start writing</p>
<p>a new language a new alphabet and i&rsquo;m like all right</p>
<p>this clearly isn&rsquo;t spanish</p>
<p>so then i said i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna leave and the</p>
<p>teachers like listen</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t leave um</p>
<p>because if you leave</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>class and i can&rsquo;t get my master&rsquo;s degree</p>
<p>so but if you</p>
<p>stick around</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll talk to you</p>
<p>after the class</p>
<p>i get done the end of the</p>
<p>class she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>listen don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>leave and i won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just show up at</p>
<p>class i&rsquo;ll give you a c</p>
<p>i was like done</p>
<p>done so i took russian i took russian one two and</p>
<p>three because</p>
<p>these kids needed another guy in</p>
<p>their class to take</p>
<p>these classes so then</p>
<p>finally i take rush i take russian</p>
<p>four and we go to russia</p>
<p>we go to russia but this is russia like</p>
<p>when the mob ran russia</p>
<p>like are you</p>
<p>guys aware of that no okay in like the</p>
<p>late 90s mid 90s</p>
<p>the mob ran</p>
<p>everything that had to do with russia</p>
<p>so when going over to russia you had to you had to</p>
<p>literally pay off the mob</p>
<p>in order to go and</p>
<p>study abroad</p>
<p>so we paid off the mob and they gave us in return</p>
<p>to banditos two young</p>
<p>mobsters who</p>
<p>would go everywhere with us</p>
<p>they lived in our hotel</p>
<p>they stayed</p>
<p>with us they went on tours with us they went</p>
<p>they would did</p>
<p>everything with us</p>
<p>their names are igor and</p>
<p>sasha and when we got</p>
<p>our teacher was like listen this is igor and sasha</p>

<p>class do not</p>
<p>talk to them do not interact with them oh my god do not</p>
<p>engage them they are only here to</p>
<p>shadow us so in my head i&rsquo;m like fucking</p>

<p>igor was probably dead</p>
<p>i would say</p>
<p>you you had a pretty</p>
<p>interesting life before you ever became a comedian you</p>

<p>stuff to talk</p>
<p>about on stage</p>

<p>story on stage i can&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too long it&rsquo;s too like it&rsquo;s i can tell you here</p>
<p>but it to tell it</p>
<p>you just need</p>
<p>to chop it up it&rsquo;s hard it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>tracy morgan</p>
<p>story i right you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i never felt comfortable telling that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous well there&rsquo;s a perfect example</p>
<p>goes look jay was telling on</p>
<p>stage and was</p>
<p>crushing yeah i know you</p>
<p>should totally tell that on</p>
<p>stage yeah maybe i&rsquo;ll have him tell the machine</p>
<p>story and then</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t have him tighten it</p>
<p>up from him</p>
<p>have him tighten it up</p>
<p>yeah just farm it out to</p>
<p>other like you know if there&rsquo;s some mexican</p>
<p>comics in town</p>
<p>sort of like surrogate jokes</p>
<p>you can have them</p>
<p>carry your joke for you</p>
<p>into you know term</p>
<p>but yeah so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t party like that really anymore you were just</p>
<p>telling us how much</p>
<p>hammered you get lately because you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>avoid this on</p>
<p>planes yeah</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s fucking anxiety that&rsquo;s me trying to handle</p>
<p>whatever i&rsquo;ve done to my brain</p>
<p>so that i can get from fucking la to new york</p>
<p>do you feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>some guys don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to lose that anxiety because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worried that if</p>
<p>they become</p>
<p>evolved some whatever</p>
<p>you know enlightened</p>
<p>however you want to say that they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>funny anymore</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m afraid</p>
<p>whatever i get nervously shit before i go and stay</p>
<p>still i used to</p>
<p>think that if i became more enlightened i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>funny i would</p>
<p>avoid like doing yoga</p>
<p>and i would</p>
<p>avoid meditating because i</p>
<p>literally thought i had to be more fucked up to be</p>
<p>funny i feel that way</p>
<p>like they asked me to get on this</p>
<p>drug called selexa</p>
<p>for what what does that do</p>
<p>they have social anxiety disorder</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see so</p>
<p>alexa how do you</p>
<p>spell it s e l e c</p>
<p>c e l e x a</p>
<p>no i want to say it&rsquo;s an s</p>
<p>i got a prescription for it</p>
<p>used to treat</p>
<p>depression the</p>
<p>class of antidepressants called</p>
<p>selective serotonin</p>
<p>reuptake inhibitors</p>
<p>that works at increasing the amount of serotonin</p>
<p>a natural substance</p>
<p>you know my</p>
<p>thing with all this stuff is</p>
<p>first get your body in order</p>
<p>you know this is what i tell</p>
<p>everybody whenever</p>
<p>i talk to anybody and they&rsquo;re like oh i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking about getting on something i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>completely opposed to people doing</p>
<p>any sort of antidepressant</p>
<p>i know people that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>changed their fucking life i know people</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s helped them dramatically</p>
<p>you know including one</p>
<p>buddy of mine who got on it</p>
<p>changed his</p>
<p>life and then slowly weaned himself off of it and</p>
<p>literally has a different way of</p>
<p>thinking now</p>
<p>and it saved him yeah he was really</p>
<p>super depressed he had some real issues you know</p>
<p>how much of it was his</p>
<p>childhood how much of it was</p>
<p>his biology whatever the fuck it is</p>
<p>but i think you</p>
<p>gotta get your body in</p>
<p>order before you</p>
<p>start fucking around with all that</p>
<p>stuff my body&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>wreck yeah well</p>
<p>of course it&rsquo;s not working so good then</p>
<p>yeah but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how often you work out ah</p>
<p>i want you want to be healthy i mean am i</p>
<p>yeah you want</p>
<p>advice yeah</p>

<p>small space</p>
<p>you start doing</p>
<p>hindu squats and</p>
<p>hindu push ups and</p>
<p>shake weight</p>

<p>steve maxwell told me how to do chin ups on</p>
<p>a door you you put a</p>
<p>towel inside the door</p>
<p>slam it shut so there&rsquo;s a knot in the</p>
<p>towel and the knot stays like so that you know you can</p>
<p>you can slam the door shut and</p>
<p>you know you can have it like</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t pull the</p>
<p>towel through</p>
<p>and then you do chin ups with it</p>
<p>i do all kinds of</p>
<p>crazy shit in my</p>
<p>hotel room yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things i need to do</p>
<p>but before you</p>
<p>start taking any</p>
<p>crazy ass pills i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna take it</p>
<p>they just said that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>should be on</p>
<p>who says this some fucking doctor i went to</p>
<p>a therapist once and she was like you need to talk to</p>
<p>so you know i have a problem with flying</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve always had a problem with flying and i fly</p>
<p>200 000 miles a year but i still</p>
<p>have anxiety when i get on a plane</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t get rid of it i</p>
<p>just hasn&rsquo;t disappeared</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like yo what&rsquo;s you need to get on celexa you also have</p>
<p>social anxiety disorder</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like oh fucking</p>
<p>i can talk to people all day long</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous anyone</p>
<p>would say that you have a social anxiety disorder</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a fucking</p>
<p>comedian but yeah but but it&rsquo;s i don&rsquo;t know so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a ton of</p>
<p>things i need you to fix my everyone has a little</p>
<p>bit of social anxiety just because you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>when you first talk to someone</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what the fuck you&rsquo;re getting yeah</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>you get better at it and more used to it as you get</p>
<p>older but i used to remember</p>
<p>i used to go to banks and it&rsquo;s i&rsquo;d already</p>
<p>started doing comedy at the time</p>
<p>and i would fucking</p>
<p>have weird almost</p>
<p>like failures of my speech</p>
<p>when i was talked to someone at the bank</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>i get up to the counter</p>
<p>can i help you sir</p>
<p>um yeah i need to</p>
<p>i need to deposit</p>
<p>deposit this</p>
<p>like you just like</p>
<p>what it just couldn&rsquo;t come out</p>
<p>right i was nervous for whatever</p>
<p>stupid reason mean</p>
<p>i had fought</p>
<p>i had done stand up i done all these</p>
<p>scary scary</p>
<p>things but talking</p>
<p>to the teller for whatever reason you know</p>
<p>would make me</p>
<p>lock up you know so i</p>
<p>think we all have a certain amount of social anxiety</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a matter of overcoming that you just need</p>
<p>india indica burt</p>
<p>the whole worst</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve gotten so confused with whatever</p>
<p>indica or sativa</p>
<p>whichever like</p>
<p>every time i ever have a conversation</p>
<p>with someone they&rsquo;re like oh you need the one that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make you think</p>
<p>right but you want the one that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make your body</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to feel in your body and i&rsquo;m like the</p>
<p>well it seems like that you&rsquo;re overthinking</p>
<p>everything so that it seems like the it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that bad i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s any different than anyone else i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m i i</p>
<p>think if anyone had my life</p>
<p>style or my life</p>
<p>like where you travel</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gone all the time you&rsquo;re jumping off</p>
<p>buildings you jumping out of</p>
<p>planes right i</p>
<p>think if anyone had my life they go through this shit</p>
<p>has it noticeably</p>
<p>changed since you</p>
<p>started doing the show</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotten much</p>
<p>better last year</p>
<p>was really bad</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve gotten much better with my anxiety</p>
<p>like now i can</p>
<p>appreciate like things</p>

<p>do you do comedy</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on the road like filming do you like</p>
<p>scheduled gigs</p>
<p>no but if i do comedy all of a</p>
<p>sudden all the</p>
<p>all the chaos in my</p>
<p>all the chaos gets real fucking mellow</p>
<p>huh because i can</p>
<p>talk and i feel like i&rsquo;m getting that outlet like i was</p>
<p>have i was in the middle like a</p>
<p>month stretch</p>
<p>from like alaska to at new york to dc to indianapolis</p>
<p>and then leaving indianapolis</p>
<p>we had to fly to cincinnati and my wife&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m complaining to her</p>
<p>about my brain or whatever i&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>is wrong with me and then she was like</p>
<p>just go get on</p>
<p>stage just go over to the to the</p>
<p>funny bone in cincinnati</p>
<p>and get on stage</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good idea</p>
<p>i was like i</p>
<p>guess that is a good idea</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s almost like a form of exercise like this</p>
<p>amount of energy that you expend on stage</p>
<p>oh yeah i don&rsquo;t like i</p>
<p>i think i one of the</p>
<p>things that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with me</p>
<p>is i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t listen very well and i talk</p>
<p>more than i listen</p>
<p>like some people</p>
<p>are good listeners</p>
<p>i feel like i&rsquo;m all</p>
<p>fucking exporting data</p>
<p>well listen you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>aware of that</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll be a better listener it&rsquo;s that simple</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re aware of one</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s fucking with you or one</p>
<p>thing that you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>about how you behave</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s step one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even more than step one</p>
<p>step one is like</p>
<p>thinking what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with me step two is like</p>
<p>figuring out what it is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at step two</p>
<p>you already know what it is</p>
<p>but yeah but i</p>
<p>think once i do stand up</p>
<p>that i start</p>
<p>i start listening so i&rsquo;m done talking</p>
<p>like you ever</p>
<p>get done with like a long stretch you like i&rsquo;m fucking</p>
<p>do not want to hear myself speak yes</p>
<p>sure i&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>talking i just want it&rsquo;s hard to discipline</p>
<p>myself to listen to tapes when that happens</p>
<p>fucking listen to tapes i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never listened to a tape ever really</p>
<p>never how do</p>
<p>you go over your bits i just it&rsquo;s all my head whoa</p>
<p>yeah do you</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s the best way to do</p>
<p>it or you just that&rsquo;s the best way for you that&rsquo;s bye</p>
<p>i know that&rsquo;s not the best way to do it</p>
<p>cause anytime i look at a tape i go</p>
<p>man i should have fucking i</p>
<p>could do that different i could yes</p>
<p>yeah and it always works but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i hate looking at myself on film and just</p>
<p>watching it</p>
<p>and going over it</p>
<p>and being like</p>
<p>you know what i say to myself what</p>
<p>i say you&rsquo;re a professional</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a professional comedian</p>
<p>and my job as a professional comedian</p>
<p>is to do it the best i can</p>
<p>and to do it the best</p>
<p>i can i have to review tapes i have to actually write</p>
<p>i have to take chances on</p>
<p>stage where i go on</p>
<p>stage and i just</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck i&rsquo;m gonna talk</p>
<p>about i just go i have to do that go down dark roads</p>
<p>especially like</p>
<p>sal&rsquo;s comedy hole</p>
<p>i love that</p>
<p>place cause it&rsquo;s like 80 people and you know</p>
<p>i can just fuck around and talk</p>
<p>about anything and bits will come out of that</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>but you got it</p>
<p>right and you got to review your shit you got</p>
<p>right to it you got to</p>
<p>do it all you got to do</p>
<p>everything all</p>
<p>right but i</p>
<p>think going through my shits exhausting</p>
<p>it is exhausting but that&rsquo;s part of the job you know</p>
<p>as i&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>older and as i&rsquo;ve gotten i think</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t say that i take my</p>
<p>stand up more seriously</p>
<p>but i think i&rsquo;ve gotten better at being disciplined</p>
<p>about it especially</p>
<p>like the last special that i did was like</p>
<p>came out less than a year</p>
<p>like a little over a year ago</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>completely new hour and 20 minutes between now and then</p>
<p>and it was difficult to do that i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never done that before</p>
<p>i always sort of slowly</p>
<p>built up an act</p>
<p>you know over</p>
<p>the next few years because i kind of had to</p>
<p>you know but now</p>
<p>the way i do it i just</p>
<p>you know and i kind of like</p>
<p>got inspired by</p>
<p>louis ck talking</p>
<p>about how he comes up with a new hour</p>
<p>every year so i</p>
<p>you know i just tried to</p>
<p>attack it and</p>
<p>write as much shit as possible</p>
<p>and in doing</p>
<p>that and trying to put together a new hour in a year</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>review material you have to be more disciplined</p>
<p>about it you have to be more</p>
<p>professional</p>
<p>about it yeah but i</p>
<p>know is your new hour thematic of who you are right now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;ve ever done for sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most silly</p>
<p>but i also think that&rsquo;s part of the</p>
<p>reason is because this podcast</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t feel like the need to</p>
<p>extrapolate</p>
<p>or to expand on</p>
<p>like philosophical ideas or try to make something</p>
<p>funny that might not necessarily be funny</p>
<p>like all i&rsquo;m really concerned</p>
<p>about is being funny</p>
<p>as opposed to you know</p>
<p>like sometimes i&rsquo;d have bits</p>
<p>about something i just wanted to talk</p>
<p>about why don&rsquo;t i have to worry</p>
<p>about that now</p>
<p>cause i just talk</p>
<p>about it on the podcast and i mean</p>
<p>the outlet is better</p>
<p>so in a sense</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s condensed my comedy</p>
<p>and made it</p>
<p>sharper and better</p>
<p>made it more funny</p>
<p>my comedy is all over the fucking</p>
<p>place right now</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s all over the place</p>
<p>what is your</p>
<p>open or your comedy</p>
<p>what is the</p>
<p>do is it any kind of theme</p>
<p>or are you just pretty much</p>
<p>you sound like some guy at the fucking</p>
<p>hotel no i mean you know</p>
<p>what do you do</p>
<p>comedian so what do you do when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>stage there do you have a theme to your act there</p>
<p>fella what&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>well you know what kind of comedy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about your comedy joe you&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s more like a</p>
<p>storytelling</p>
<p>based it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of conspiracy kind of theory your kind of life</p>
<p>you know conspiracy theory</p>
<p>or used to be more conspiracy but not not really</p>
<p>conspiracy we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the pyramids bet you mean</p>
<p>yeah say that&rsquo;s a conspiracy</p>
<p>pyramids noah&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ark all that</p>
<p>stuff but did</p>
<p>you have more of a like like bitty</p>
<p>are you more jokey jokey</p>
<p>or i&rsquo;m straight up</p>
<p>storytelling</p>
<p>storytelling i</p>
<p>would say i</p>
<p>would say more so</p>
<p>my stand of shows more like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to watch someone</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going i feel like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally you&rsquo;re coming to my</p>
<p>house i&rsquo;m telling you stories i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>standing on the ottoman</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re sitting on the</p>
<p>couch and i&rsquo;m just you&rsquo;re like man that guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house is fun to be at</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a lot of just</p>
<p>crowd interaction you know i told you this last time i</p>
<p>bring people on</p>
<p>stage but yeah it&rsquo;s straight up stories</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had always had a hard time like i have a great</p>
<p>story about</p>
<p>the first time i met will smith</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve had a hard time</p>
<p>um i have a hard time</p>
<p>telling it because i feel like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i feel like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>name droppy yeah</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s just it just</p>
<p>yeah whenever you you you&rsquo;re running uphill</p>
<p>whenever you say oh here&rsquo;s the time i met will smith</p>
<p>get the fuck out of here</p>
<p>do they still</p>
<p>hang out with i</p>
<p>think you i</p>
<p>think you need to</p>
<p>you know you have to have a jammin fucking</p>
<p>story if you want to</p>
<p>bring up the time you met will smith</p>
<p>just to overcome the weight</p>
<p>of carrying that</p>
<p>story around</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>storytelling</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>do you write do you sit down and</p>
<p>write stuff you know i can&rsquo;t write a</p>
<p>story because</p>
<p>then it loses</p>
<p>the story always works the</p>
<p>first time i tell it on</p>
<p>stage and if i ever</p>
<p>could have ever</p>
<p>videotaped it i&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>bam that&rsquo;s how i need to tell it every time</p>
<p>but you kind of almost</p>
<p>the way i work is</p>
<p>my brain i&rsquo;ve got to feel the beats</p>
<p>like feel the beats and</p>
<p>where they go and</p>
<p>where they drop and</p>
<p>where they hit</p>
<p>and then and</p>
<p>and if i write it</p>
<p>it just becomes very long winded and all the jokes that</p>
<p>that would fit in on</p>
<p>stage just don&rsquo;t fit it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like longer themes</p>
<p>so everything you talk</p>
<p>about on stage is pretty much stories</p>
<p>yeah i would say so you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>literally never sit down with a</p>
<p>laptop and say i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do the russian mob</p>
<p>story then i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do the russian mob story</p>
<p>is the hardest one for me to tell on</p>
<p>stage i&rsquo;ve done it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve done did it</p>
<p>you ever done</p>
<p>elliot in the morning in dc no</p>
<p>i did ellie in the morning and i told her on his show</p>
<p>and then everyone</p>
<p>would come to show and be like machine machine</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;d get up at the end of the</p>
<p>night and be like fuck i</p>
<p>gotta tell the story</p>
<p>that seems like a</p>
<p>show or a story rather you can tell on stage</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna try i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna try to</p>
<p>start working it into shows</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>weird if like</p>
<p>like i do the i do the</p>
<p>fighting a bear</p>
<p>story on stage</p>
<p>i do the i do the</p>
<p>story about my daughters</p>
<p>my daughters</p>
<p>but yeah i like</p>
<p>you never like say say what if you did a special you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do a comedy central special an hour</p>
<p>an hour yeah when did you do this</p>
<p>by 18 months ago</p>
<p>and when you did it did you</p>
<p>feel like you have to write all new</p>
<p>stuff after you did it yeah but that&rsquo;s but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>but i also get i feel like a hack if i tell old jokes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very i don&rsquo;t like listening</p>
<p>i feel like a phony a lot</p>
<p>a lot i feel like a phony</p>
<p>only because i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>i guess when i when i</p>
<p>scouted the stand up i traded whatever</p>
<p>my wife goes nuts about it i traded whatever</p>
<p>brain i have</p>
<p>that is the guy that gets a job</p>
<p>at dean witter or whatever</p>
<p>and has those luncheon stories and tells the</p>
<p>story about golf last week</p>
<p>i traded in them for every story is fucking funny</p>
<p>every story is funny</p>
<p>and like and</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like i&rsquo;m fucking willing to mind anything</p>
<p>and if it takes it</p>
<p>quick like the russian mom story</p>
<p>i obviously</p>
<p>shorten a massive</p>
<p>chunk of that</p>
<p>because the real</p>
<p>story is a little depressing</p>
<p>the real story gets really depressing</p>
<p>so i but if you tell the people then they fucking but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>crazy about you robbing people</p>
<p>do you tell the</p>
<p>story about you working out in the bookstore on</p>
<p>the dude you</p>
<p>gotta tell that one and i was thinking</p>
<p>about that what if they you</p>
<p>never masturbated down there doing</p>
<p>anything like</p>
<p>that no there was a guy</p>
<p>there was a sign up</p>
<p>this is gonna</p>
<p>sound even crazier there was a sign up</p>
<p>that when i</p>
<p>was when you&rsquo;d go</p>
<p>to hit an afraid elevator that said whoever there was</p>
<p>double doors</p>
<p>whoever is urinating on this door please stop</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s offices on the other side</p>
<p>so i kept seeing that</p>
<p>going wow that&rsquo;s so funny i</p>
<p>bring the freight elevator down here to work out</p>
<p>i wonder who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bringing it down to piss on</p>
<p>these doors and then i</p>
<p>started thinking</p>
<p>what happens when you piss on</p>
<p>these doors</p>
<p>like does it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be a fucking really good payoff</p>
<p>for the fuck</p>
<p>for them to</p>
<p>for someone to really risk it</p>
<p>every and just do it</p>
<p>and i was like i</p>
<p>should do that i</p>
<p>should definitely piss on this doors</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s why i got</p>
<p>caught because they were</p>
<p>viewing tape to find out who&rsquo;s pissing on the doors</p>
<p>and then they saw me working out and they were like</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s got to be him piss</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure i got fucking</p>
<p>for both of those</p>
<p>yeah without a doubt</p>
<p>but you know it&rsquo;s so funny</p>
<p>like now that you</p>
<p>this way my</p>
<p>brain works</p>
<p>i remember tell telling me i had a joke one time</p>
<p>about my name is</p>
<p>when i was growing up i</p>
<p>tried tagging in my neighborhood</p>
<p>so i got a can of spray paint and i was all</p>
<p>i was like son of a</p>
<p>bitch i&rsquo;m the only bird that lives in this neighborhood</p>
<p>and then i was like sucks dick</p>
<p>and attell was like that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great joke and</p>
<p>i was like and as soon as he said that i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in every fucking act</p>
<p>so now that you say you</p>
<p>should tell them</p>
<p>working out</p>
<p>in the barnes and noble</p>
<p>as soon as you said that my brain went</p>
<p>oh that is good i</p>
<p>never saw it as good</p>
<p>i never thought dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a classic bit i laughed</p>
<p>i when you said that you know have cameras down here</p>
<p>dude that would</p>
<p>crush yeah now</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why my</p>
<p>brain works like</p>
<p>i never thought</p>
<p>about telling</p>
<p>tracy morgan and jays like you&rsquo;ve got a fucking tell on</p>
<p>stage and i was like</p>
<p>yeah how did have you guys resolved that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think so i mean here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing is that if he wants to tell he can tell it</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t want to tell it i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>do you make him say that it&rsquo;s burt chrysler</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>tracy morgan fucking</p>
<p>tracy one day</p>
<p>that fucking</p>
<p>hen is coming back to roost he</p>
<p>thinks he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get mad at you</p>

<p>gonna love you that</p>
<p>first of all he tells crazier stories than that</p>
<p>every time he goes on the radio</p>

<p>thing that he pulls his</p>
<p>shirt over goes</p>
<p>someone get pregnant</p>
<p>oh is that slapping</p>
<p>his stomach</p>
<p>tracy morgan&rsquo;s one of the most</p>
<p>hilarious individuals around but i just don&rsquo;t know him</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t wanna</p>
<p>like i only met him one time so i don&rsquo;t wanna</p>
<p>yeah but it&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>funny story i don&rsquo;t think he</p>

<p>comic would just to go that is a hilarious</p>
<p>story in a weird way also though and</p>
<p>i and i think i</p>

<p>stage and having that to be my closer</p>
<p>and then every</p>
<p>night everyone&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>tracy morgan and i&rsquo;m like oh fucking</p>

<p>would get laughs just with</p>
<p>impressions</p>
<p>meanwhile there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with that i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kinda interesting to see someone do an</p>
<p>impression it like</p>
<p>gives you like some sort of a charge like wow he does</p>
<p>sound just like him</p>
<p>oh i was like i need four or five of</p>
<p>those in my act yeah just to like</p>
<p>sprinkle them in between some</p>
<p>there were such a great like</p>
<p>dc benny used to pull out a fucking</p>
<p>this is my impression of</p>
<p>a of a italian eye doctor</p>
<p>what you looking at</p>
<p>like and it was just like real</p>
<p>quick i was</p>
<p>like benny wow i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t thought</p>
<p>about that i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen that guy in forever i used to</p>
<p>party with him and ben bailey and</p>
<p>tony woods back when i was</p>
<p>tony woods tony woods was like one of my best friends</p>
<p>tony woods is fucking hilarious tony woods is amazing i</p>
<p>never had he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i mean i think</p>
<p>dave chappelle&rsquo;s very original don&rsquo;t get me wrong</p>
<p>but tony woods is like the original dave chappelle</p>
<p>like is very similar</p>
<p>style to dave and really fucking</p>
<p>funny and i&rsquo;m not saying that dave stole from</p>
<p>dave just it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys that we&rsquo;ve all</p>
<p>known guys like</p>
<p>that for whatever reasons like they&rsquo;re really funny but</p>
<p>this fucking</p>
<p>thing doesn&rsquo;t get on the right</p>
<p>track and something</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t happen and people don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>funny you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a few guys like that</p>
<p>where like jb smooth</p>
<p>you know oh jb</p>
<p>smooth&rsquo;s making a lot of</p>
<p>money now dj destroyer</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always been a destroyer man</p>
<p>i was in um</p>
<p>i did a gig in new jersey once with jb smooth and</p>
<p>he was late we both were late we got lost it was</p>
<p>ridiculous directions this is pre</p>
<p>navigation systems okay this is like 1992 91</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re both pretty much scrubs</p>
<p>and you know we&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>starting out and we&rsquo;re doing these</p>
<p>stupid gigs and i did this college</p>
<p>and they were all</p>
<p>excited to see me because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d done the naka</p>
<p>thing and you get on</p>
<p>stage and i killed at the naka</p>
<p>conference and i got all</p>
<p>these bookings and i was so excited</p>
<p>well i get there i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve told this</p>
<p>story before so i&rsquo;ll make it briefly</p>
<p>um i get there and</p>
<p>well the open airs not here jb</p>
<p>smooth supposed to open i was supposed to close</p>
<p>the openers</p>
<p>not here yet so do you want to just sit down and</p>
<p>watch tv okay</p>
<p>so i sit down in</p>
<p>their little rec</p>
<p>room and watch tv and i</p>
<p>watch this fucking special on the malibu fires</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what year it was i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming like ninety</p>
<p>three ninety two ninety</p>
<p>three and it was</p>
<p>devastating</p>
<p>these people were crying</p>
<p>and there was</p>
<p>a kid walking around calling out for his dog</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s walking over</p>
<p>these burnt down</p>
<p>foundations with</p>
<p>smoke coming out</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>calling every five</p>
<p>seconds mike mikey</p>
<p>mikey calling out for</p>
<p>whatever the fuck the dog&rsquo;s name is</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a guy who&rsquo;s a fireman</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s crying and he&rsquo;s crying talking</p>
<p>about this house was the only thing that</p>
<p>he worked his</p>
<p>whole life to</p>
<p>build this fucking house</p>
<p>well the opener hasn&rsquo;t come so we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>going to throw you up is that okay</p>
<p>yeah okay and i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>back then i had to</p>
<p>learn a bunch of times</p>
<p>that you have to get yourself into a certain</p>
<p>state of mind before you go on stage</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t just try to perform</p>
<p>you know you have to put your mind</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re 21</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>the fuck i was and no one&rsquo;s telling you what to do</p>
<p>you can kind of develop like really</p>
<p>loose habits</p>
<p>when it come</p>
<p>to your stand up</p>
<p>so i went up there dude and</p>
<p>i did not know how to</p>
<p>start the show off i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>expect to be</p>
<p>starting the show off</p>
<p>so i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>prepare for that</p>
<p>i prepared to be following the guys i didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>you know when you</p>
<p>start a show off from scratch</p>
<p>you gotta settle everybody in</p>
<p>you gotta calm</p>
<p>your way down get control of the room then</p>
<p>start with some jokes and open</p>
<p>strong open</p>
<p>strong so that they think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth following you and paying attention</p>
<p>i did neither of</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>all i did was go on</p>
<p>stage and think</p>
<p>about these poor fucking people that lost</p>
<p>their houses to the fire so then</p>
<p>for whatever reason</p>
<p>a joke bombs</p>
<p>right and then i just say</p>
<p>i shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch that fucking show i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry this is what i did</p>
<p>right before i went on</p>
<p>stage i watched this documentary</p>
<p>about all these people in malibu who lost their</p>
<p>houses to fires and i go and i&rsquo;m fucking depressed and</p>
<p>the audience is like 200 kids are like what are you</p>
<p>why are you telling us this</p>
<p>are you a fucking comedian</p>
<p>like what are you here for</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m really depressed guys it was terrible and then jb</p>
<p>smooth finally showed up so he goes on</p>
<p>after i eat</p>
<p>dick for half an hour</p>
<p>he goes up and just crushes</p>
<p>it was exactly what they want he was</p>
<p>silly and high energy and</p>
<p>you know he just picked up the ball</p>
<p>where i left it in a pile of dog shit</p>
<p>and just ran with it</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s another guy it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>why is that guy not a</p>
<p>giant fucking huge star</p>
<p>tony woods brian you probably</p>
<p>imagine you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen him do stand up</p>
<p>he used to go on</p>
<p>and purposely</p>
<p>literally not</p>
<p>speak for the</p>
<p>first two minutes and just</p>
<p>tony woods would</p>
<p>not speak really and just get himself organized</p>
<p>real slow delivery</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;d say something like</p>
<p>i know what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking a joke</p>
<p>would be good</p>
<p>right about now</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m black and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>when i don&rsquo;t just when i get to work</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean i</p>

<p>enjoying doing comedy</p>
<p>doing the podcast</p>
<p>and doing the</p>
<p>ufc and i wish the</p>
<p>ufc i would like to do less of those</p>
<p>i love doing it</p>
<p>but sometimes i</p>
<p>travel just a bit too much i</p>
<p>would love it</p>
<p>if it was like in la or something like that</p>
<p>but sometimes it&rsquo;s hard but when i&rsquo;m there i</p>
<p>never wish i was anywhere else</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m enjoying</p>
<p>everything i do</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m very careful</p>
<p>right now to make</p>
<p>sure that i don&rsquo;t take on anything else that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>enjoy cause</p>
<p>right now my life</p>
<p>is like a little masterpiece like i&rsquo;ve got it set up so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like when i&rsquo;m in town i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>enjoying everything i&rsquo;m doing i have the</p>
<p>greatest group of friends</p>
<p>you know and a part of it is this podcast you know</p>
<p>and now because this podcast</p>
<p>the people that</p>
<p>are coming to see me at the shows are different</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all podcast fans and they really know</p>
<p>where the fuck</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m coming from and we&rsquo;re all coming from</p>
<p>i mean brian gets fucking huge</p>
<p>rounds of applause when he goes on</p>
<p>stage now brian do like five</p>
<p>minute sets and</p>
<p>in portland</p>
<p>gets huge rounds of applause</p>
<p>ari does two huge huge</p>
<p>round applause in seattle</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s the puff</p>
<p>daddy of podcasts ballin bro</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all good</p>
<p>stuff it&rsquo;s not like when i was doing fear factor</p>
<p>it was like it was a great job</p>
<p>it paid ridiculous</p>
<p>money and it was really easy it was</p>
<p>three days a week</p>
<p>but during those</p>
<p>three days i</p>
<p>would wish i was doing something else</p>
<p>and i did it</p>
<p>happily because it was a lot of money</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never a time when i&rsquo;m doing a podcast</p>
<p>never a time when i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>stand up never a time when i&rsquo;m doing the ufc</p>
<p>where i go wow i wish i was doing something else yeah</p>
<p>every time there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>ufc i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>fuck yeah here we go you know the</p>
<p>boom boom the</p>
<p>sound comes on</p>
<p>the lights dim</p>
<p>first fight</p>
<p>starts i&rsquo;m like whoa</p>
<p>punch knuckles with mike goldberg here we go</p>
<p>every time man i&rsquo;m like a little kid i love it there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never a time</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>god i can&rsquo;t believe i&rsquo;m sitting here</p>
<p>watching fights</p>
<p>never never and to</p>
<p>stand up right before i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go on</p>
<p>stage there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never a time</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m like fuck i can&rsquo;t believe i&rsquo;m doing stand up</p>
<p>never never now</p>
<p>how much how much does money</p>
<p>incorporate into any of your decision making</p>
<p>well it has to</p>
<p>but luckily i make good</p>
<p>money from the ufc and i make good money from</p>
<p>stand up so it doesn&rsquo;t have to it&rsquo;s like long as</p>
<p>those things are covered</p>
<p>then i don&rsquo;t have to think</p>
<p>about it it&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re not covered</p>
<p>then it has to become an issue like</p>
<p>so much okay go ahead like say when i first</p>
<p>started doing fear factor i was not making really good</p>
<p>money with standup i was doing newsradio</p>
<p>at the same</p>
<p>time can you tell me how much you&rsquo;re making on standup</p>
<p>beckman a few grand a week</p>
<p>like couple grand couple grand</p>
<p>okay yeah two grand 2500 maybe in a good week</p>
<p>but i was doing like thursday through sunday you know</p>
<p>maybe newsradio was getting</p>
<p>it was a little more than that towards</p>
<p>the end because it was 99 when i put out my cd and that</p>
<p>definitely helped</p>
<p>and i was getting paid better in clubs</p>
<p>and there were some</p>
<p>places where i</p>
<p>could sell out</p>
<p>but it was inconsistent and it was few and far between</p>
<p>so when something</p>
<p>like fear factor came up it was like well</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a good chance to make really good</p>
<p>money you know</p>
<p>and when you</p>
<p>say like 2500 people go wow that&rsquo;s a lot of money</p>
<p>but then you know when you take away</p>
<p>agents fees manager</p>
<p>fees and also business manager and</p>
<p>and consider you&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>a different</p>
<p>tech bracket</p>
<p>on news radio</p>
<p>yeah so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>i can tell you exactly how much you walk away with 2500</p>
<p>yeah that was my rate</p>
<p>yeah you walk away with 30 cents on the dollar</p>
<p>35 cents on the dollar</p>
<p>so ridiculous</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just the way it is so you have to make good</p>
<p>money to stay</p>
<p>ahead of the curve</p>
<p>and then if you want to be able to relax</p>
<p>you have to have enough in the bank so you don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>if something happens</p>
<p>i mean financial freedom the real financial freedom is</p>
<p>not the freedom</p>
<p>to buy things and to own</p>
<p>things the real financial freedom is to not</p>
<p>worry about</p>
<p>money that&rsquo;s the number one thing</p>
<p>get yourself in a</p>
<p>place where you</p>
<p>could feed yourself</p>
<p>and be able to</p>
<p>brian cowan</p>
<p>said this to me once and i really took it to heart</p>
<p>and he goes</p>
<p>being rich i&rsquo;d like to be rich yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>but you know what i want to do</p>
<p>so i want to be able to go to a nice restaurant</p>
<p>whenever i want</p>
<p>go to a nice restaurant</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so true like be able to eat at a nice</p>
<p>place and never go well how much is the steak 28</p>
<p>how much is the fish</p>
<p>24 the fish</p>
<p>you know that feeling</p>
<p>which i mean</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>i clearly remember</p>
<p>thinking like that you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s real financial freedom you don&rsquo;t have to think</p>
<p>about stuff</p>
<p>so the way i&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>everything set up man it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m in a real good spot</p>
<p>right now so i</p>
<p>gotta be real careful</p>
<p>about taking on any</p>
<p>other things</p>
<p>i talked about</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pitching this show right now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>based on some of the ideas that came up on the podcast</p>
<p>but really the more i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>about it the</p>
<p>more i&rsquo;d rather just put cameras on the podcast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>that seems like the most ideal</p>
<p>thing because we&rsquo;re pretty much doing it already</p>
<p>might as well do it</p>
<p>do it not like</p>
<p>this in your career i</p>
<p>would say this is probably the most</p>
<p>and this is this is just for as a person who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>been a fan of yours and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d say a friend somewhat but</p>
<p>this is probably the most representative of you</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>this is your</p>
<p>this is the one</p>
<p>thing that i</p>
<p>think when you</p>
<p>past people will go</p>
<p>dude his podcast was fucking</p>
<p>that was before people were really</p>
<p>like doing them and it was just it was</p>
<p>breaking ground i mean it was like</p>
<p>and it was his it&rsquo;s your personality</p>
<p>your stand ups your personality</p>
<p>but it also has to be</p>
<p>delivered in a one to set</p>
<p>there is a payoff in</p>
<p>every moment your</p>
<p>stand up so</p>
<p>you will compromise</p>
<p>despite how much people will argue this</p>
<p>you will compromise</p>
<p>your voice for a joke yes</p>
<p>a lot of times yes it&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t feel like i have to get my</p>
<p>voice out anymore</p>
<p>i used to feel like there were certain</p>
<p>things that i wanted to say on</p>
<p>stage that maybe i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say because i couldn&rsquo;t condense it into a joke form</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t feel like that anymore</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>stuff that i have there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>weird thoughts</p>
<p>that i have that i&rsquo;ve expressed on the podcast and i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>explored in</p>
<p>depth that almost have no payoff as far as humor</p>
<p>you know like my idea</p>
<p>about the whole</p>
<p>universe being some complex mathematical problem</p>
<p>every literal</p>
<p>thing that goes on is just a part of some</p>
<p>giant fucking algorithm this is something i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>dwelling on for a long long time there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>humorous in that</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve discussed it on the podcast a</p>
<p>bunch of times i totally believe that in parallel</p>
<p>states yeah i fucking</p>
<p>totally believe in that shit i believe that do you ever</p>
<p>think to yourself like</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t believe i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still alive no</p>
<p>brian does cause brian ate onions this morning and his</p>

<p>i mean i maybe could consider</p>
<p>licking it she uh</p>
<p>oh he&rsquo;s like thank god</p>
<p>i could maybe consider that if i had</p>
<p>taken an ambient and had one of those</p>
<p>sleepwalking episodes</p>
<p>and my wife&rsquo;s like you woke up in the middle of the</p>
<p>night and ate my</p>
<p>pussy you don&rsquo;t remember that and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>almost been the ambient</p>
<p>but i can&rsquo;t imagine just doing that sober</p>

<p>do you ever worry that she&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>think that you&rsquo;re not attracted to her if you don&rsquo;t</p>

<p>those girls that always</p>

<p>but you know here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing is that you know</p>
<p>for a first</p>
<p>season show you</p>
<p>kinda gotta</p>
<p>hit a home run</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>people get just as</p>
<p>excited about new projects</p>
<p>as they do successes but they don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>excited for shows that did</p>
<p>pretty good well also when you&rsquo;re dealing with a women</p>
<p>based network man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be hard to promote a show about</p>
<p>hunting i think</p>
<p>all i think</p>
<p>all networks</p>
<p>other i mean almost all networks really</p>
<p>target women</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s no not at all no no</p>
<p>no eighteen to</p>
<p>thirty four males eighteen to thirty</p>
<p>four males are</p>
<p>where the money is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they always talk really yeah</p>
<p>maybe i got our demographic off but i could&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>swear money</p>
<p>as far as i mean obviously you can make a lot of</p>
<p>money if you&rsquo;re oprah</p>
<p>but as far as like you know</p>
<p>the people that</p>
<p>spend the most it&rsquo;s 18 to 34 year</p>
<p>old males that&rsquo;s the 18 to 49 occasionally depending on</p>
<p>how far they want to stretch your demographic or like</p>
<p>23 to 52 i bet</p>
<p>travel and food</p>
<p>network and there&rsquo;s a couple of those that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll do women i</p>
<p>could see that totally you</p>
<p>know the you know</p>
<p>and anthony bourdain</p>
<p>anthony bourdain&rsquo;s show is very male centric i</p>
<p>would think you know the way he discusses</p>
<p>things and talks</p>
<p>about things and</p>
<p>drinks a lot and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fun fucking show yeah but i</p>
<p>think even like</p>
<p>adam richman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>show is very</p>
<p>women love it but</p>
<p>women like i mean i</p>
<p>think women will</p>
<p>watch a guy they</p>
<p>want to connect with connect with like</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>think was a big fear of my show is that i&rsquo;m kind of a</p>
<p>meathead i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>a forest broke</p>
<p>gum frappe boy</p>
<p>right so like</p>
<p>who wants to</p>
<p>watch a guy</p>
<p>scream all over the</p>
<p>world and jump and then they</p>
<p>underestimated</p>
<p>your charm exactly that&rsquo;s what i said bitches</p>
<p>but i just need to step</p>
<p>but now that but</p>
<p>our shows doing good and and</p>
<p>so and you told me this adam richman guy this man</p>
<p>versus food</p>
<p>he got so fucking fat that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even do the challenges anymore</p>
<p>i never said that joe</p>
<p>oh okay you didn&rsquo;t say that no</p>
<p>what i heard on the internet</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry it wasn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>what i heard on the</p>
<p>internet was that this guy got so fucking fat that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do the challenges anymore is that true no he</p>
<p>no he&rsquo;s not doing the challenges anymore what the fuck</p>
<p>is that cause</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole show though i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he got fat i</p>
<p>think he just fucked his body up</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s just very unhealthy</p>
<p>the reason why i said this is there was a threat</p>
<p>about it on my message</p>
<p>board this is a</p>
<p>long time ago before i even talked to anybody about it</p>
<p>and it showed a</p>
<p>picture of him from</p>
<p>season one to what</p>
<p>season is he in now</p>
<p>season four</p>
<p>poor fuck yeah</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s his body just you know</p>
<p>he does all the</p>
<p>like cleanses and</p>
<p>detoxes and even</p>
<p>still was just like fuck i&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>30 pound cheeseburgers you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do that show you can&rsquo;t do that show for six</p>
<p>seasons for 20 seasons</p>
<p>so they had to kind of change it i</p>
<p>think to make it more of a</p>
<p>sustainable</p>
<p>show for so it</p>
<p>could carry on that long</p>
<p>and so now it&rsquo;s called man</p>
<p>versus food nation</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>where he brings in</p>
<p>like they did the</p>
<p>nasty boys in tampa</p>
<p>where the i mean i</p>
<p>definitely shouldn&rsquo;t be talking</p>
<p>about a show</p>
<p>talk about a show bro but yeah</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about bert the</p>
<p>motherfucking conqueror</p>
<p>tell these bitches when they can</p>
<p>watch it when is it on</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s one of my favorite</p>
<p>human beings</p>

<p>bert kreischer if you want to follow bert on twitter</p>

<p>is the shit bert</p>
<p>yeah i used to be joe rogan</p>
<p>net it used to be dot</p>
<p>met but it was so long it was impossible to retweet me</p>
<p>like if i said anything</p>
<p>funny like you</p>
<p>would have to</p>
<p>like chop it all up because there was too many words</p>
<p>like if i tried to use</p>
<p>like i used to</p>
<p>think like the new twitter you can retweet</p>
<p>something and it just retweets it in its entirety</p>
<p>like a separate</p>
<p>140 characters</p>
<p>but it used to not</p>
<p>be that it used to be that when you retweeted something</p>
<p>you had to account for all the characters inside</p>
<p>their name you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>do that anymore no no you don&rsquo;t have to do it anymore</p>
<p>on twitter you just hit retweet and it can just</p>
<p>take care of it the way it is so</p>
<p>anyway and some dude had joe rogan</p>
<p>what can i change mine to</p>
<p>just do it make sure it&rsquo;s something that is</p>

<p>they don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>drink too much and get fucking kicked out they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>good like just random</p>
<p>random i told you a girl from hgtv listens to this</p>
<p>yeah a woman</p>
<p>what are the heads of directors of hgtv was like</p>
<p>i heard you on the rogan podcast</p>
<p>rights dtv hg</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>i thought you talking</p>
<p>about hd that makes</p>
<p>sense because that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>fight network and they were like straight up like okay</p>
<p>i was like shut up oh that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>hi to her hey</p>
<p>listen the best thing</p>
<p>about this podcast is that we develop like a real</p>
<p>connection with all</p>
<p>these people and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know what people tell me is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re hanging out with us</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>dude the best testament to this show</p>
<p>and i swear this on my children</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>the road i&rsquo;ll put on the podcast and put it on low</p>
<p>in the pillow next to me i just feel</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m listening to friends talking the other room</p>
<p>and it puts me to</p>
<p>sleep and i just go</p>
<p>but a lot of times i had to stop</p>
<p>cause i would</p>
<p>i get out weird</p>
<p>yeah i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do it to a new one because i&rsquo;ll end up listening to the</p>
<p>whole fucking</p>
<p>thing all right</p>
<p>the old reruns and it needs to be re</p>
<p>like someone</p>
<p>is your friend energy</p>
<p>like just very like mm hmm</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve listened</p>
<p>is that your re impression</p>
<p>but the one</p>
<p>where you guys had the</p>
<p>blackout yeah</p>
<p>still i listened</p>
<p>that a million times because i love listening to</p>
<p>i love that</p>
<p>he passes out halfway through</p>
<p>yeah he was</p>
<p>completely gone well</p>
<p>joey got so</p>
<p>tired because he</p>
<p>ate a cookie and</p>
<p>he smoked joints and he had to hit the bag he had the</p>
<p>vaporizer bag to</p>
<p>he gets so hot he goes down a downward spiral</p>
<p>joey&rsquo;s the reason why i</p>
<p>found out the difference between indica</p>
<p>and sativas</p>
<p>because i never</p>
<p>smoke indicus</p>
<p>i really didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize that there&rsquo;s so much of a difference</p>
<p>until i smoke joey&rsquo;s weed</p>
<p>me and brian and duncan were hanging out in houston</p>
<p>texas we&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>lobby of the hotel</p>
<p>and we were just sitting there</p>
<p>slack jawed and no one was moving</p>
<p>no was going anywhere and i was like what the fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with us</p>
<p>and then and then i</p>
<p>think it was duncan that realized it</p>
<p>right he goes i</p>
<p>think we just smoked joey&rsquo;s weed</p>
<p>like oh no what have we done</p>
<p>cause jelly just like i just like to get</p>
<p>blasted dog i don&rsquo;t give a fuck alright</p>
<p>og kush what do you got there</p>
<p>third eye train</p>
<p>wreck come with it bitches</p>
<p>come with it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll just whatever the fuck you got man he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>smoke it but he used to be on he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do it anymore now he likes hybrids</p>
<p>which are good because hybrids give you like that heady</p>
<p>thing but it also</p>
<p>relaxes you</p>
<p>good for comedy</p>
<p>when i when i fucking</p>
<p>whenever i get the chance to have a regular life</p>
<p>maybe i&rsquo;ll take</p>
<p>up weed smoking then but i can&rsquo;t do it now</p>
