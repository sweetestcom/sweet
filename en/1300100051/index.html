<p>off and code</p>
<p>really good if you fuck it</p>
<p>and one other thing</p>
<p>just a little shout out</p>
<p>because when i spoke to one of the owners chris</p>
<p>he said they were gonna come up with some new ideas</p>
<p>you know like when you buy a box of campbell</p>
<p>soup and shit</p>
<p>on the side of</p>
<p>it yeah it gives you the directions for campbell&rsquo;s soup</p>
<p>but it also gives you directions for</p>
<p>other things you could do</p>
<p>and i was thinking</p>
<p>about other</p>
<p>things you could do</p>
<p>like you could take this out and put ice cubes in there</p>
<p>and fuck it you follow me a lot of people</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t invented that yet that ice cubes yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ice cubes i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>but i know for</p>
<p>some people you put ice cubes inside a fucking drink</p>
<p>you put some ice cubes you</p>
<p>shake it up and you fuck it with dry ice</p>
<p>or green tea heated</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>cause it feels nice on your dick</p>
<p>oh let&rsquo;s say you had a</p>
<p>rough night the</p>
<p>night before you banged 18 hookers</p>
<p>and your fucking dick is</p>
<p>bleeding you put</p>
<p>epsom salt in there with warm water</p>
<p>and you fuck the epsom salt</p>
<p>just a couple different recipes we have for you</p>
<p>at joe rogan</p>
<p>experience not that i</p>
<p>would try this shit</p>
<p>i know a lot of you fucking</p>
<p>freaks would try this</p>
<p>stuff at home i know redman would</p>
<p>definitely try it i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t try ice cubes that</p>
<p>would make it</p>
<p>shrink and be sad well whatever the fuck</p>
<p>maybe somebody stepped on your dick at an</p>
<p>mma contest</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t dry ice burn your dick</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s some people like that shit talk</p>
<p>20 years ago i went to a club</p>
<p>to get quaaludes</p>
<p>and i walked in i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never forget</p>
<p>it was called ramrod</p>
<p>it was a gay bar in the city</p>
<p>we were kids we were like 18 that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first time i seen a dude with a cape on</p>
<p>i thought it was the coolest fucking</p>
<p>thing in the</p>
<p>world a man had a cape on</p>
<p>and i walked into this club</p>
<p>and before we walked in there</p>
<p>was a fetish club on the side there was a guy in a tub</p>
<p>that had a sign on him that said spit on me</p>
<p>that was his fetish for people to spit on</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s the beauty</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m standing there</p>
<p>you know your jaws</p>
<p>going you&rsquo;re drinking</p>
<p>you know you had to pee and also they see</p>
<p>twenty guys</p>
<p>standing on line for the fucking bathroom i</p>
<p>asked when i go listen</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s just ask the guy in the tub</p>
<p>if we could pee on</p>

<p>when you could have a car that</p>
<p>every time you look at it you go holy shit</p>

<p>you really shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to drive one</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re sixteen</p>
<p>seventeen years old that&rsquo;s a death trap</p>
<p>is crazy engine</p>
<p>in this little retard</p>
<p>brain of mine</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m sixteen</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m allowed to have this fucking</p>
<p>metal monstrous</p>
<p>death machine out there</p>
<p>with a bunch of people with</p>
<p>their kids out there walking in the streets and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way there&rsquo;s no way kids</p>
<p>should be able to have that kind of power i had a</p>
<p>1981 renault alliance</p>
<p>and my cousin was just gonna like donate it to charity</p>
<p>but she i bought it off of her for a dollar for i</p>
<p>guess for some reason that you can</p>
<p>you have to pay something right</p>
<p>for some reason and</p>
<p>and it was all beat up and my dad&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>this is your</p>
<p>first car you have to redo this</p>
<p>whole entire car to make it look new</p>
<p>and stuff like that i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>show you how to do it but you have to do all the work</p>
<p>we took side</p>
<p>panels off and i took</p>
<p>that putty that molding putty and i had to re sculpt</p>
<p>this renault alliance</p>
<p>wow like you bonded it yeah bonded the</p>
<p>whole car we made</p>
<p>you like earn it yeah</p>
<p>yeah yeah and so but</p>
<p>at the end of it it looked like a</p>
<p>brand new renault alliance</p>
<p>really it was like</p>
<p>it was a renault alliance</p>
<p>it was still</p>
<p>funny because</p>
<p>then i went to a station</p>
<p>wagon with wood on the sides i had a</p>
<p>bunch of cars that were like big american muscle cars</p>
<p>a bunch of them in a row</p>
<p>and then i got i always said they were always</p>
<p>pieces of shit</p>
<p>the one that i</p>
<p>crashed in front of the tree</p>
<p>or into the tree rather was the best one</p>
<p>that was the nicest one that i had</p>
<p>the ones afterwards were just shit</p>
<p>boxes most of them</p>
<p>cause i was broke but</p>
<p>i got an audi fox</p>
<p>do you know what that is yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little tiny</p>
<p>front wheel</p>
<p>drive car manual</p>
<p>it was my first manual</p>
<p>and it was my first</p>
<p>really well engineered car</p>
<p>and it was the</p>
<p>first car that i</p>
<p>drove i was like what a</p>
<p>piece of shit</p>
<p>these fucking american cars are</p>
<p>god like you don&rsquo;t realize like what a hunk of shit</p>
<p>you know it is to drive</p>
<p>a seventy barracuda</p>
<p>like all stock</p>
<p>and everything with</p>
<p>stock brakes and</p>
<p>stock suspension</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>are just barely connected to the road they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>all over the fucking place</p>
<p>taking corners with them is a nightmare the</p>
<p>steering is numb you have no idea</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>and you take that and then you go to like a little tiny</p>
<p>car that&rsquo;s like well engineered and handles</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s like wow this is an amazing difference</p>
<p>and that car was a</p>
<p>piece of shit</p>
<p>you know but it was still</p>
<p>it was so much better</p>
<p>and then i started to</p>
<p>appreciate cars that</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t powerful</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t have to be that</p>
<p>powerful to me</p>
<p>i just realized</p>
<p>the toyota supra i</p>
<p>think was my favorite car</p>
<p>growing up that was fun that was my</p>
<p>first expensive car that i got really</p>
<p>yeah when i got on tv</p>
<p>when i was on newsradia that was the</p>
<p>first expensive car i got i got a toyota supra</p>
<p>i was like holy shit i have a fucking toyota supra</p>
<p>with the crazy</p>
<p>space wing on the back of it i</p>
<p>heard they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bringing it back i</p>
<p>heard the supra is coming back really</p>
<p>i heard that a couple of</p>
<p>months ago well you know they have that</p>
<p>lexus if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen it that lf</p>
<p>they they have this new</p>
<p>lexus that&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>this incredible</p>
<p>piece of engineering i mean it&rsquo;s like 400 000</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not even allowed to buy it apparently</p>
<p>what you have to do is you have to</p>
<p>lease it and you have to pay the entire</p>
<p>lease portion up front</p>
<p>and you get it for two years and it&rsquo;s like 260 000</p>
<p>and you have to pay for it for like two years</p>

<p>whole cars over there so when cars get robbed here</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like it&rsquo;s in mexico no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a cab in fucking iraq</p>
<p>and iran and</p>
<p>sudan and all</p>
<p>those countries</p>

<p>stolen cars from here go in a</p>
<p>tank you know</p>

<p>thinking that</p>
<p>oh my fucking car got robbed i left my fucking kids</p>
<p>pictures in there whatever the fuck</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what they do with your shit</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s fucking amazing that uh</p>
<p>and every day they</p>
<p>come up with a new fucking scam whether it&rsquo;s online</p>
<p>i read something that people doing</p>
<p>online that&rsquo;s just fucking amazing now the internet</p>
<p>has really destroyed scammering here&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>facebook scam that i just witnessed last night</p>
<p>people who get hacked accounts on facebook</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be on facebook</p>
<p>and something a little chat will pop up and like dude</p>
<p>check this out and then they put a link</p>
<p>and it goes to like the log in page of facebook again</p>
<p>and so now they&rsquo;re attacking through chats on facebook</p>
<p>like it looks like they&rsquo;re chatting to you</p>
<p>wow so watch out for that one</p>
<p>because she</p>
<p>the person i was with almost did i was like no wait a</p>
<p>second why are you logging back in you know</p>
<p>whoa so watch out for facebooks</p>
<p>yeah those are</p>
<p>tricky man what is that a</p>
<p>virus how do they do that</p>
<p>somebody gets hacked and i</p>
<p>think it just grows and grows and grows like a</p>
<p>virus yeah like one person got hacked and then</p>
<p>those person friends and they connect</p>
<p>to websites</p>
<p>or the websites</p>
<p>the ones that are trying to set you up like how&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>how you get into that what it&rsquo;s doing is</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>collecting information i think</p>
<p>about people probably</p>
<p>because someone told me that sometimes you&rsquo;ll go to a</p>
<p>legit website and a</p>
<p>legit website will have been hacked with this</p>
<p>thing right</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think what i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s that i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>almost like a spam bot that somebody puts on facebook</p>
<p>okay myspace</p>
<p>used to do so they can&rsquo;t do that to your website</p>
<p>where you would go to redband com</p>
<p>and all the</p>
<p>sudden it would say hey you</p>
<p>know log in</p>
<p>know to facebook or something like that</p>
<p>unless that your server got</p>
<p>completely overtaken that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>would be yeah or there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your website coding got somehow</p>
<p>can they can&rsquo;t they invent the</p>
<p>virus it does that like</p>
<p>every time someone wants to</p>
<p>click on a link</p>
<p>it opens up a window ask them to log into something</p>
<p>absolutely that&rsquo;s why your servers have to have good</p>
<p>virus software and detections and</p>

<p>world we live in i&rsquo;m petrified of the computer</p>
<p>petrified just fucking petrified of it</p>

<p>those dudes like</p>
<p>every pool hall you go to there&rsquo;s some kid</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s just caught in</p>
<p>school and he&rsquo;s</p>

<p>jonathan with this was the</p>
<p>devil yeah and jack</p>
<p>clubman was the pool</p>
<p>player he wanted</p>
<p>to be the best</p>
<p>nice yeah and this guy</p>
<p>was like a dead guy and he came back to play him right</p>
<p>and the the the</p>
<p>thing was he had already lost</p>
<p>because he had he</p>
<p>devoted his entire life to just playing pool</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d wasted his life</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d wasted his life playing this game</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;d lost anyway</p>
<p>and it was like wow it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>things that you can get obsessed with</p>
<p>and you know and it&rsquo;s fun and you</p>
<p>enjoy it and you can you can have a</p>
<p>good time you can play golf on the weekends and it can</p>
<p>add flavor to your life</p>
<p>or you could just get caught up in it and that becomes</p>
<p>everything you know</p>
<p>and gambling when you&rsquo;re a kid when you&rsquo;re a young kid</p>
<p>how many guys you know that you</p>
<p>were a kid that all they wanted to do was play cards</p>
<p>all they wanted</p>
<p>to do was find games all they wanted to do was gamble</p>
<p>go to the track</p>
<p>race track horse track yeah</p>
<p>everybody was gambling when you were kids fuck yeah</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t live with the</p>
<p>i i really uh one</p>
<p>thing i really i</p>
<p>never told you about that</p>
<p>my mom had the bar</p>
<p>and from the ages of like</p>
<p>seven to ten i was very i got hooked on pool but it was</p>
<p>the reason why i stopped playing</p>
<p>pool was because i got really creepy</p>
<p>it overtook me</p>
<p>oh yeah i used to get into pool and i</p>
<p>would say things to people about them</p>
<p>that was creepy like as i was playing</p>
<p>one day i went home and i</p>
<p>checked myself my</p>
<p>mother asked me she goes what the fuck is that</p>
<p>why you just your competitive</p>
<p>drive it really</p>
<p>taught me i</p>
<p>never wanted that feeling ever again</p>
<p>like it stopped me from being that competitive</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just balls</p>
<p>going into a hole</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about pool there&rsquo;s a reason why everybody has this</p>
<p>thing about pool being a manly game you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>like to certain games like</p>
<p>who gives a fuck if you&rsquo;re good at donkey kong no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be impressed</p>
<p>but like you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>if a girl beats you donkey kong what the fuck who cares</p>
<p>a girl beat you at pool though</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a totally different world</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something very manly</p>
<p>about being able to control that ball</p>
<p>being able to keep your composure being able to pocket</p>
<p>those difficult shots</p>
<p>being able to run out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a manly</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being able to keep your shit together and keep</p>
<p>everything tightly tuned</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a moving yoga sort of a thing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be so much</p>
<p>more pissed if a girl beat me at donkey kong</p>
<p>really would you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be like this is horrible</p>
<p>what is happening to me that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re a super nerd</p>
<p>right like it</p>
<p>should be smack</p>
<p>plug i agree if</p>
<p>a girl beat me</p>
<p>at quake that</p>
<p>would be way</p>
<p>worse than pass</p>
<p>quake would be way</p>
<p>worse than poole for me but that</p>
<p>was quake was a bigger obsession than poole was because</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t always have to</p>
<p>you know i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>always get people to play me in poole</p>
<p>like sometimes i&rsquo;d go to the pool hall</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;d be no one to play</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to sit</p>
<p>around and wait or you&rsquo;d have to practice by yourself</p>
<p>and maybe someone will come in and</p>
<p>you know this guy can&rsquo;t play him he&rsquo;s too good</p>
<p>or he won&rsquo;t give up a spot or i&rsquo;m looking for a new</p>
<p>with playing quake</p>
<p>you just get</p>
<p>online anytime you want you just hop online and play</p>
<p>you need to buy</p>
<p>the new call of duty next week or i can&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m scared</p>
<p>i saw this fucking ad</p>
<p>for the new star wars game there</p>
<p>was a star wars game ad that they showed during the ufc</p>
<p>it looks so</p>
<p>oh forest unleashed 2</p>
<p>oh my god the fucking graphics i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if this was in game footage or if it&rsquo;s one of those</p>
<p>tricky things</p>
<p>where they like pretend it&rsquo;s in game footage</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really it&rsquo;s just like some animation</p>
<p>about the game they created</p>
<p>right the last one was pretty good</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not my cup of tea too much i like the</p>
<p>first person</p>
<p>shooters more and</p>
<p>unless they change that i don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>first person</p>
<p>shooter to with</p>
<p>third person</p>
<p>shooter where it&rsquo;s like from behind the person oh</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>those yeah yeah</p>
<p>those aren&rsquo;t as fun to me</p>
<p>i want to see everybody else i want to see it as if</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m seeing it i don&rsquo;t need to see my character that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stupid you know</p>
<p>i might want to see the hand in</p>
<p>front of me with the gun</p>
<p>i kind of like that looking</p>
<p>quake sometimes</p>
<p>when you see the hand in</p>
<p>front of you with the gun like</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s easier</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to remember</p>
<p>what you have too like you don&rsquo;t remember if you have a</p>
<p>lightning gun or if you have a rail gun</p>
<p>sometimes i</p>
<p>would just have it</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;d only see the crosshair</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the most most fun game the way that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most fun way to play it to me because it&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>immersive cause that&rsquo;s how we see</p>
<p>things we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see our body outside our body running around that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous yeah</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even feel like me</p>
<p>but when i&rsquo;m playing quake</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just me</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crosshair and i&rsquo;m running down hallways and shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too exciting</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>scary dude you</p>
<p>should do it and now</p>
<p>do it in 3d</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best when</p>
<p>playing first person</p>
<p>shooters in 3d on the</p>
<p>tv oh i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s give you like</p>
<p>crazy eyesight it</p>
<p>would probably fuck with your eyeballs yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s intense though you feel way more</p>
<p>immersed into it a lot of guys when they&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>quick they kill all the graphics</p>
<p>they would kill</p>
<p>all the graphics and make it look really flat</p>
<p>and the idea</p>
<p>would be that so that the</p>
<p>opponent would show up better</p>
<p>and so that</p>
<p>their processor</p>
<p>their computer</p>
<p>would lose it</p>
<p>absolutely but</p>
<p>that looks terrible yeah but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more in it for the numbers they&rsquo;re offered</p>
<p>that look like</p>
<p>the railgun looks like you only see like a straight</p>
<p>line to it there&rsquo;s like a lot of the graphics are gone</p>
<p>lame have you ever played a</p>
<p>video game joey</p>
<p>no not even pac man</p>
<p>pac man yes we</p>
<p>pac man frenzy</p>
<p>back in the day you</p>
<p>were pac man i&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>other one mrs pac man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s anybody</p>
<p>who got good at that</p>
<p>quake game and</p>
<p>started playing it anybody</p>
<p>would get hooked</p>
<p>it is so exciting</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s so 3d</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>first person shooters</p>
<p>especially ones like quake</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you can do</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>you can run around you can jump</p>
<p>you can rocket jump</p>
<p>shoot down off the</p>
<p>ground and go flying through the air and land on things</p>
<p>i mean this is a</p>
<p>completely three</p>
<p>dimensional</p>
<p>world and most of</p>
<p>these maps that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting on</p>
<p>they have all these</p>
<p>levels to them</p>
<p>layers and levels and you</p>
<p>travel back and forth and up and down</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re running down</p>
<p>these corridors it&rsquo;s all in real time</p>
<p>fighting other people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so exciting</p>
<p>you really need to play some new</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>yeah i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cause if you really</p>
<p>think that highly</p>
<p>of quake&rsquo;s graphics in a</p>
<p>world quake</p>
<p>4 is pretty dope</p>
<p>i know right even</p>
<p>quake 4 you take</p>
<p>quake 4 the</p>
<p>best machine you can possibly buy you take that</p>
<p>times that probably by 2 million</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>video games are now really</p>
<p>yeah which games are really like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>so like call of duty is one that i personally love</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so realistic it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>immersive you met</p>
<p>when we saw</p>
<p>the lands another one that you would</p>
<p>totally fucking love</p>
<p>remember when</p>
<p>we saw gears of war before it even came out</p>
<p>yeah gears of</p>
<p>war way early</p>
<p>our buddy cliffy b</p>
<p>from epic games who&rsquo;s a cool</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>gotta game on</p>
<p>yeah i would love to have him on the podcast he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>one of the nicest guys ever</p>
<p>and just super cool</p>
<p>friendly dude we met him</p>
<p>and he showed us a</p>
<p>bunch of shit it was before gears of war ever came out</p>
<p>and he was like you know</p>
<p>what did he</p>
<p>what was it well we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to fuck doom in the ass</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because doom 3d it just came out oh</p>
<p>yeah i forgot all</p>
<p>about that yeah</p>
<p>i remember that and he was showing us the gears of war</p>
<p>stuff and we were like oh my goodness</p>
<p>yeah that was like</p>
<p>eight months before that game was even</p>
<p>released or something</p>
<p>or announced</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t realize what hard work is</p>
<p>until you see game developers</p>
<p>you see the amount of</p>
<p>hours they put in</p>
<p>like tim willets</p>
<p>from id software and todd hollands head and all</p>
<p>those guys and john carmack</p>
<p>you know having</p>
<p>again to hang around with them</p>
<p>getting to go to like id software and see like</p>
<p>where they make the game</p>
<p>first of all it&rsquo;s so humbling how fucking badass</p>
<p>these guys are</p>
<p>like the designs and all the</p>
<p>crazy graphics and all the</p>
<p>things they&rsquo;re constructing</p>
<p>i remember we went there</p>
<p>to id before doom 3 came out and they were showing us</p>
<p>some demo versions of it</p>
<p>just fucking amazing shit</p>
<p>just the artwork</p>
<p>but then you talk to them you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>how much time do you guys</p>
<p>spend working this</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like it&rsquo;s like 16 hour days</p>
<p>every day we work on</p>
<p>sundays yeah</p>
<p>they work constantly man</p>
<p>until they take time off and go on vacation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing how much</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of like</p>
<p>south park for like</p>
<p>eight months you know</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s like even when it comes to</p>
<p>everything in hollywood</p>
<p>like any kind of cgi or computer graphics it seems like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all like that like i know somebody that&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>harry potter 3d right now</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>nineteen hour</p>
<p>shifts yo what&rsquo;s up with that man</p>
<p>if you had kids</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s like you</p>

<p>let&rsquo;s play some ufc</p>
<p>and then all sudden</p>
<p>the sun&rsquo;s up and</p>
<p>birds are chirping and i can&rsquo;t believe i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still awake my eyeballs are shot and i</p>
<p>sleep till three in the afternoon</p>
<p>yeah i did that i did that for years</p>
<p>i love it because i do it in</p>
<p>target they have a ufc</p>
<p>demo that&rsquo;s constantly playing</p>
<p>and so i was in</p>
<p>target the other day</p>
<p>shopping and</p>
<p>suddenly i hear your</p>
<p>voice like behind me</p>
<p>going oh no</p>
<p>or something like that</p>
<p>what the fuck what&rsquo;s my voice</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that what you probably do</p>
<p>well we actually</p>
<p>did two things we did it so i have to go in</p>
<p>start working on it</p>
<p>again oh really</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re working on a new one soon they just</p>
<p>i think next</p>
<p>month i start wow</p>
<p>what we do is we play</p>
<p>certain clips of</p>
<p>fighters like doing</p>
<p>stuff and you call the action</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s actually happening</p>
<p>you do that</p>
<p>and then you also like make imaginary scenarios</p>
<p>like imaginary scenarios like heel hook</p>
<p>transitions to the arm bar</p>
<p>and watch out</p>
<p>transitions</p>
<p>to the back and we&rsquo;re trying to come up with a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>possibilities for that and then we have</p>
<p>descriptions of this fighter</p>
<p>taken on this guy</p>
<p>and this fighter</p>
<p>like endless combinations so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many hours</p>
<p>it put into the game i mean just ridiculous</p>
<p>stupid hours now</p>
<p>dude when you guys</p>
<p>filmed it was there any easter eggs that you know of</p>
<p>where you had like</p>
<p>weird scripts that you</p>
<p>wrote that was like all</p>
<p>right why am i doing this this is weird</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s a good question though</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good question</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s a lot of easter eggs in games</p>
<p>right yeah there&rsquo;s actually a</p>
<p>bunch of games there&rsquo;s a list of like the top 10 i</p>
<p>think was on crack com</p>
<p>of the top 10 like</p>
<p>easter eggs that were took</p>
<p>the longest to find like there was one that was just</p>
<p>found the other day from some</p>
<p>nes game you know from</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get easter eggs man i don&rsquo;t get it</p>
<p>if you want to</p>
<p>put something on</p>
<p>like an eddie bravo on his</p>
<p>twister the dvd twister</p>
<p>he had the the</p>
<p>easter egg was</p>
<p>brian callum doing that gay brazilian</p>
<p>jiu jitsu instructor all right</p>
<p>you know remember that you</p>
<p>know right which is hilarious</p>
<p>dude why wouldn&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>just put that on the yeah that seems yeah easter eggs</p>
<p>should be just little</p>
<p>things maybe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a video</p>
<p>why would you hide that somewhere deep in your</p>
<p>way you have to</p>
<p>press control alt</p>
<p>delete to get to it or something</p>
<p>what do you have to</p>
<p>press to get to easter eggs</p>
<p>usually it&rsquo;s just up</p>
<p>arrows like you have to hit the</p>
<p>arrow right down</p>
<p>yeah but you have to do it in the</p>
<p>right order</p>
<p>right like down</p>
<p>down left right</p>
<p>it depends sometimes fuck</p>
<p>you fuck you for making me look for shit like that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right what the</p>
<p>fuck something</p>
<p>if you got something show me put it out there</p>
<p>yeah what the fuck</p>
<p>my treasure hunt all</p>
<p>of something</p>

<p>you don&rsquo;t look at you we don&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>this motherfucker you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say that you look at the wife and you go</p>
<p>then the wife will tell you</p>
<p>later oh okay really</p>
<p>are you fucking</p>
<p>serious she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had them all goddamn day running up and down</p>
<p>running around</p>
<p>target they heard your</p>
<p>voice yelling and</p>
<p>screaming they thought it was you there</p>
<p>what are you nuts and looking</p>
<p>nice and quiet</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say that to the kids just</p>
<p>you know i told</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t say anything to the kids nothing</p>
<p>they run the fucking place</p>
<p>hey joe have you ever</p>
<p>heard of something called geocaching</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s what geocaching</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>whole thing and</p>
<p>this is one of</p>
<p>these weird</p>
<p>things that you would</p>
<p>never know existed</p>
<p>unless you just ran across it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a game that the whole</p>
<p>earth or whatever is the playing field</p>
<p>and these people</p>
<p>put gps coordinates</p>
<p>to different</p>
<p>boxes or treasures throughout</p>
<p>the horn i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard about this it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy so what it is there&rsquo;s maps and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s websites that you go to that you try to find</p>
<p>these little</p>
<p>boxes that spread out</p>
<p>throughout cities everywhere</p>
<p>and then you get to one of</p>
<p>these boxes</p>
<p>you open it up and i</p>
<p>think you signed like your name on it and then you look</p>
<p>sometimes there&rsquo;s little treasures or presents in there</p>
<p>or you add things to this little box</p>
<p>like a cool badge or</p>
<p>diamond or something not a real diamond but whatever</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s like this whole</p>
<p>game that people play it&rsquo;s called geocaching</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s iphone apps for it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so weird i&rsquo;ve always wanted to do it</p>
<p>or at least look at a box and see what&rsquo;s inside of it</p>
<p>if you weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worried about people being</p>
<p>stalked and you weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worried about like</p>
<p>nuts on the internet</p>
<p>you could have a pretty dope tv show</p>
<p>where you like give out coordinates</p>
<p>right now and and</p>
<p>you know you tell this dude</p>
<p>where to go and then you release that information</p>
<p>on the internet and he&rsquo;s got to go do something</p>
<p>and people from the internet will help him out all</p>
<p>right but then</p>
<p>the problem is you just have some nut</p>
<p>who would just be like</p>
<p>you and i are brothers in another life i have</p>
<p>eaten crystals and seen his vision</p>
<p>maybe fucking followed you around</p>
<p>everywhere you</p>
<p>could have issues</p>
<p>with that dude you know and if he knew that he</p>
<p>could get on</p>
<p>television by helping you and</p>
<p>becoming your friend yeah you know</p>
<p>but you can have a pretty dope tv show like that that</p>
<p>would be cool</p>
<p>you have to you can&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>filter though</p>
<p>internet show</p>
<p>yeah reason to have tv show well you mean yeah i</p>
<p>guess i don&rsquo;t know man i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exciting dude</p>
<p>tv is still what you&rsquo;re getting from tv the tv</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be tv anymore what it is</p>
<p>gonna be is that internet and tv sort of</p>
<p>emerge together</p>
<p>yeah you know because tv&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still cool because you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>first of all you got</p>
<p>experience producers</p>
<p>people who know how to film</p>
<p>things correctly people who know how to</p>
<p>write scripts</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got all</p>
<p>these talented</p>
<p>motherfuckers so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never gonna</p>
<p>go away if the shit they&rsquo;re producing is really cool</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just somehow another they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>gonna merge together</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get rid of tv the idea of getting rid of tv</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna make lost</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna make no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be though</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an example you go to</p>
<p>jimmy kimmel&rsquo;s website you can watch</p>
<p>every single one of his episodes</p>
<p>way way way back you know right so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna get to a</p>
<p>point where they&rsquo;re not broadcasting tv to like kid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i</p>
<p>wanna fucking do is</p>
<p>watch jimmy kimmel you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>listen let&rsquo;s get down and fucking</p>
<p>dirty here cocksuckers</p>
<p>what so like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna get to a</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just not broadcasting it anymore there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>cable companies it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna be like</p>
<p>every show has</p>
<p>their own website</p>
<p>for sure jimmy camel&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah state of</p>
<p>jimmy kimmel</p>
<p>and channel and</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be people who set up networks online</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just like you connects online to</p>
<p>television and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an alternative word</p>
<p>google tv apple tv</p>
<p>bam shazam so</p>
<p>right now your website</p>
<p>might have some cool youtube</p>
<p>videos but imagine it in the future</p>
<p>being a channel yeah</p>
<p>i mean we always said that that&rsquo;s probably what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>right that everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get their own channel</p>
<p>the websites</p>
<p>literally will be like channels and everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna have their own little fucking thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a real problem like i reality show</p>
<p>like if apple reduces a</p>
<p>thing produces some new</p>
<p>thing where you make your own reality show</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a fucking hat</p>
<p>and you put this hat on</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got like a little</p>
<p>thing and there&rsquo;s a camera right in</p>
<p>front of you and you just</p>
<p>carry it around</p>
<p>with you and it broadcasts wirelessly on the 4g network</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what justin tv</p>
<p>started off as</p>
<p>he did that one guy</p>
<p>one guy 24 hours a day he was his own tv</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is that apple</p>
<p>would create an app like</p>
<p>not an app but</p>
<p>a device like a new</p>
<p>version of you know like they have the ipad some new</p>
<p>crazy thing</p>

<p>hey let me tell you something</p>
<p>i just want to mention one thing</p>
<p>that this is the year of the mexican</p>
<p>the miss america philippe</p>
<p>sparza winning last</p>
<p>comic standing</p>
<p>the dishwasher</p>
<p>el compadre</p>

<p>the fucking just a matter of time</p>
<p>so many of them it&rsquo;s the year of the fucking mexican</p>
<p>but the way</p>
<p>he took over was amazing</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t call that in a million</p>
<p>years that&rsquo;s why you didn&rsquo;t see a joey karate video</p>
<p>cause i really couldn&rsquo;t call that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a beast man</p>
<p>i would have lost a lot of</p>
<p>money at that ufc</p>
<p>you know who</p>
<p>first told me</p>
<p>about this well i had</p>
<p>heard good things</p>
<p>about him i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>heard like this</p>
<p>guy&rsquo;s really good you know this guy is very talented</p>
<p>this guy works really hard this guy&rsquo;s very dedicated</p>
<p>but you hear that</p>
<p>about a lot of guys</p>
<p>for certain guys to</p>
<p>stand out cain</p>
<p>was always a guy that</p>
<p>stood out like you&rsquo;d remember him</p>
<p>like people would talk</p>
<p>about him like before when he had</p>
<p>his very first</p>
<p>fight in the ufc</p>
<p>but phil baroni</p>
<p>was talking to me</p>
<p>and i think we&rsquo;re in germany</p>
<p>and we were sitting around talking and he was just</p>
<p>going off about how good cain is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the real fucking deal he&rsquo;s the best in the world</p>
<p>he goes i don&rsquo;t give that up for anybody because</p>
<p>i watch him run through guys he goes i watch him</p>
<p>never get tired</p>
<p>i watch him do</p>
<p>these conditioning drills</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s the last one to get tired</p>
<p>when guys like josh cost</p>
<p>check and welterweights</p>
<p>and he was like</p>
<p>you never see that you</p>
<p>never see a</p>
<p>heavyweight</p>
<p>that can go</p>
<p>at the same pace as welterweights and beat them</p>
<p>in conditioning and endurance drills</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like the guy</p>
<p>never gets tired he goes it&rsquo;s incredible he goes</p>
<p>he would get</p>
<p>him and cost check</p>
<p>both of them are</p>
<p>incredibly well conditioned</p>
<p>and he would like do as much as cost</p>
<p>check or more</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>you never hear</p>
<p>about a 240</p>
<p>pound guy that&rsquo;s able to do that</p>
<p>know the 170</p>
<p>pound guys i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the real endurance is</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the a bit like</p>
<p>145 pound guys</p>
<p>those motherfuckers can go</p>
<p>go for you go</p>
<p>frankie edgar</p>
<p>try slowing</p>
<p>frankie edgar</p>
<p>down good luck</p>
<p>frankie egger</p>
<p>could go for 20</p>
<p>rounds if it was a fucking contest to see</p>
<p>frankie egger is very difficult to catch</p>
<p>you might be able to beat him in a decision</p>
<p>very difficult to grab a hold of very difficult to</p>
<p>catch in a submission</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s fast as fuck his footwork is good his</p>
<p>wrestling is good</p>
<p>if every fight was 25 rounds</p>
<p>frankie edgar</p>
<p>might not ever lose ever for the rest of his life</p>
<p>until he decides to retire</p>
<p>if he just keeps going</p>
<p>until one of you breaks</p>
<p>until one of you slows down it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be you</p>
<p>motherfucker you just keep going</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain guys at that weight</p>
<p>but you never hear</p>
<p>about that for 240</p>
<p>except kane kane&rsquo;s the only guy i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>heard about that</p>
<p>as a heavyweight</p>
<p>you hear things</p>
<p>about brock lesnar</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a freak</p>
<p>like that his</p>
<p>like if you look at</p>
<p>his numbers like his ability to</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember what his combine numbers were</p>
<p>i have it on my computer</p>
<p>it don&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re insane</p>
<p>numbers fuck</p>
<p>knocked out of them</p>
<p>so the combine numbers don&rsquo;t come into it</p>
<p>no what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying is confused</p>
<p>about all those numbers go out</p>
<p>the fucking window they do let me tell you something</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>what aka seen that i seen the</p>
<p>first fight with</p>
<p>shane carwin bro</p>
<p>that really fucked me up that</p>
<p>it all comes to you</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>it all came to me as i was looking at them</p>
<p>right before they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>ready to go i looked at my wife and i go</p>
<p>came alaska&rsquo;s and then</p>
<p>knocked this</p>
<p>motherfucker out</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that till</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s why i didn&rsquo;t do a video</p>
<p>and i thought about two</p>
<p>things a lot of people saw that i thought that</p>
<p>i thought that i seen what</p>
<p>shane did to him</p>
<p>and i think that this guy just said i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do what</p>
<p>shane did with endurance and just get him before the</p>
<p>first round</p>
<p>right and i seen some of the</p>
<p>shane carla</p>
<p>fight that nobody fucking mentioned</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s one part in the</p>
<p>shane carla</p>
<p>fight when they get started</p>
<p>where shane</p>
<p>carlin hits him</p>
<p>and after he gets hit he goes</p>
<p>that motherfucking</p>
<p>never been hit before bitch</p>
<p>that motherfucker</p>
<p>that he told this was a</p>
<p>wrestling game</p>
<p>he ain&rsquo;t never been hit before</p>
<p>did you know that</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t think about that</p>
<p>think of an experienced</p>
<p>fighter when he gets hit</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll smile</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll go like this</p>
<p>he went like this</p>
<p>look at that</p>
<p>first fight</p>
<p>again when he fought carl</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when i said oh</p>
<p>they just if</p>
<p>aka seen that they said they seen some</p>
<p>he don&rsquo;t like get it</p>
<p>slight the fight</p>
<p>against somebody posted something on the</p>
<p>underground they</p>
<p>could have very well been</p>
<p>trolling i have no idea</p>
<p>but they said that</p>
<p>trolling is just</p>
<p>you post something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not true to try to get people to bite</p>
<p>and then people</p>
<p>start arguing this is bullshit</p>
<p>and then you know you</p>
<p>laugh your ass off because you got a bunch of</p>
<p>idiots arguing over nonsense you know what</p>
<p>trolling used to mean by the way</p>
<p>it used to mean a guy that</p>
<p>chased after other men</p>
<p>really yeah because</p>
<p>when was that</p>
<p>online online i got in</p>
<p>trouble with the animal</p>
<p>pet or los angeles</p>
<p>pet police or whatever they&rsquo;re called what</p>
<p>you got there&rsquo;s pet police and somehow they got in</p>
<p>trouble what are they called you got in</p>
<p>trouble with the pet police</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>animal control</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>because people on the internet like outlaw and all</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>were telling this poor girl in my</p>
<p>space that i like</p>
<p>tortured cats there was something like that oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right right so you had made a</p>
<p>fake video or something yeah i made a fake</p>
<p>video where i had a cat in a refrigerator and i</p>
<p>was like i keep it in the</p>
<p>freezer and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>right but anyways</p>
<p>so they called animal control</p>
<p>at me and i had to explain to this guy that i was</p>
<p>trolling or they were</p>
<p>trolling people on the internet</p>
<p>and he goes trolling</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah and he goes</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s trolling me and i&rsquo;m like you know like joking</p>
<p>arcade and he goes oh well that meant something else</p>
<p>something else went back in my</p>
<p>day oh i see</p>
<p>the way before</p>
<p>the internet</p>
<p>way before the</p>
<p>internet talk</p>
<p>about she was trolling</p>
<p>what the yeah</p>
<p>well trolling is like</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>a lot of dudes will pretend to be girls</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll get dudes to bite</p>
<p>so that you know like and then they&rsquo;ll get to say some</p>
<p>ridiculous shit</p>
<p>and then at the end they&rsquo;re like i&rsquo;m a dude you faggot</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s coming to your house to suck your dick</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of that and</p>
<p>doug stanhope did a whole bunch of trolling</p>
<p>against with pedophiles</p>
<p>he would do it there was a thing called baiting</p>
<p>org i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still around i think doug</p>
<p>wrote a book about it</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s got a book doesn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>i think they</p>
<p>were doing a book or he has a book i&rsquo;m not sure but</p>
<p>i know there&rsquo;s a lot of his blogs that are</p>
<p>still available you</p>
<p>could find them online if you just go to</p>
<p>had this whole</p>
<p>thing where he would pretend to be little kids</p>
<p>and he would troll pedophiles</p>
<p>and then he would post it all online</p>
<p>like what were they trolling</p>
<p>about cambridge</p>
<p>oh so that somebody was trolling something</p>
<p>about brock lesnar</p>
<p>what they were saying was that</p>
<p>no one was allowed to</p>
<p>punch him in the face during time i&rsquo;m telling you dog</p>
<p>that dude has never been lit up all his life</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s always been the fucking biggest guy</p>
<p>in the room what about</p>
<p>this so nobody&rsquo;s ever said to him come on cocksucker</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get it on do you think it&rsquo;s possible that um</p>
<p>all the pro</p>
<p>wrestling that he did and you</p>
<p>know playing football for a little bit that he did too</p>
<p>do you think</p>
<p>maybe he suffered a</p>
<p>bunch of concussions</p>
<p>no bro he don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like that some people</p>
<p>never been hit</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve always intimidated people</p>
<p>this motherfucker took it to him</p>
<p>i really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s coming back</p>
<p>i think his ego got busted up like</p>
<p>your boy against trinidad</p>
<p>against bernard hopkins</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think so</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s too ego tisco</p>
<p>this ego and this confident well you know he came</p>
<p>back i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that because he came back better and</p>
<p>stronger after</p>
<p>frank mere tapped him that was a leg lock that wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>punch to the</p>
<p>fucking face bro it&rsquo;s true big fucking difference</p>
<p>when you get</p>
<p>punched in the fucking face twice</p>
<p>and when they cut you and you</p>
<p>gotta see that</p>
<p>every time you shave</p>
<p>you see that</p>
<p>every time you</p>
<p>shave well i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna beat that guy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to beat that guy i</p>
<p>think the gap is too big</p>
<p>what i think about</p>
<p>when i see that guy</p>
<p>when i see the</p>
<p>two of them the way they performed when they were</p>
<p>fighting each other</p>
<p>i saw one guy who was like this</p>
<p>unbelievably</p>
<p>strong powerful fast guy</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t know exactly what to do with his body</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>exactly how to handle situations he did know to do the</p>
<p>right thing</p>
<p>and the other dude who</p>
<p>maybe not as</p>
<p>strong as him</p>
<p>but pretty fucking strong</p>
<p>and has real good technique</p>
<p>everything he does perfect</p>
<p>everything he does is smart</p>
<p>all his footwork is</p>
<p>smart he can go at that same pace</p>
<p>and keep going he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>exploding a</p>
<p>shitload of energy that he can&rsquo;t recover from</p>
<p>he paced himself better he handled it more</p>
<p>professionally</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one guy&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>black belt i&rsquo;m looking at a</p>
<p>black belt in</p>
<p>mma and came velasquez</p>
<p>like a master</p>
<p>and in brock i&rsquo;m looking at this</p>
<p>super powerful</p>
<p>purple belt</p>
<p>you know this is just</p>
<p>ridiculously</p>
<p>powerful guy</p>
<p>who could get away</p>
<p>with a lot of shit if you don&rsquo;t have perfect technique</p>
<p>you you really won&rsquo;t be able to stop him</p>
<p>but a guy like</p>
<p>kane has perfect technique that&rsquo;s the difference i</p>
<p>think that the next guy they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna put him up</p>
<p>against which is what&rsquo;s online is</p>
<p>frank me no</p>
<p>no no oh the brock</p>
<p>i thought you were saying cane and i&rsquo;ll tell you what i</p>
<p>think frank</p>
<p>mayo take it from now because now</p>
<p>frank miril know</p>
<p>what to attack</p>
<p>straight adam throw a</p>
<p>bunch of fucking</p>
<p>punches and</p>
<p>punch him in the face fuck and listen</p>
<p>when i was a kid i grew up in north</p>
<p>bergen we played all the fucking i hate to say this</p>
<p>we played all the</p>
<p>black schools with</p>
<p>group four you play</p>
<p>passaic you play patterson</p>
<p>east side these are fucking</p>
<p>schools jack</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t go in there and just talk hi how are you</p>
<p>about chad there ain&rsquo;t no chad at</p>
<p>these fucking schools</p>
<p>and the coaches</p>
<p>would tell us bro the</p>
<p>first player of the game</p>
<p>fire out like your fucking assholes on fire</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>establish that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that they back off a little bit</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s right this</p>
<p>gonna happen to brock everybody seen that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>great fighter</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen that karl</p>
<p>would have him in a way though</p>
<p>karl was too</p>
<p>fucking second</p>
<p>in adam karl and adam</p>
<p>and that question i</p>
<p>think that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been hit</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been fucking lit up well</p>
<p>well he is sparring with people though there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no sparring</p>
<p>with the call</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s too big he&rsquo;s broccoli</p>
<p>you think they just take it</p>
<p>easy on him</p>
<p>i got my nose broken</p>
<p>the sixth grade</p>
<p>it still hurts</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still fucking hurts all</p>
<p>right it still hurts my nose</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t know for years because i was doing coke</p>
<p>for years i thought</p>
<p>i was doing coke because i had pain and</p>
<p>in my heart oh i was</p>
<p>i doing coke from the fucking pain in my nose</p>
<p>i had my nose busted three</p>
<p>you aren&rsquo;t doing</p>
<p>well the pain you</p>
<p>one time with</p>
<p>a fucking coke</p>
<p>cause you like coke that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>one time with</p>
<p>a fucking police</p>
<p>thing over here</p>
<p>let me tell you something that&rsquo;s the newest</p>
<p>the latest theory</p>
<p>the last two years my fucking nose</p>
<p>has been hurting like really what is that pain from</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from fucking getting your nose broken</p>
<p>i knew in the</p>
<p>sixth grade i was</p>
<p>never gonna be a fucking</p>
<p>fighter it&rsquo;s totally unrelated to all that coke</p>
<p>i know this is a joke you fuck</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a joke you fucking momo</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is though that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so weird that</p>
<p>the last two years my nose has really been fucking hurt</p>
<p>but i never</p>
<p>hit it by mistaken nothing lately but i remembered</p>
<p>when i broke it the pain i had</p>
<p>that when you fucking</p>
<p>break it let me tell you something</p>
<p>he got a cut in his eye he had a bloody nose</p>
<p>the worst thing</p>
<p>about having</p>
<p>your nose broken is if you have your nose broken</p>
<p>seven out of 10 times</p>
<p>they busted your</p>
<p>upper lip too</p>
<p>so you got snotty</p>
<p>blood you&rsquo;re tasting</p>
<p>and salty blood fucking from your mouth</p>
<p>you remember that</p>
<p>taste for the rest</p>
<p>of your fucking life i don&rsquo;t give a fuck who you are</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not a fucking good taste</p>
<p>that taste always</p>
<p>equivalizes to something that ain&rsquo;t good man</p>
<p>my nose has been fucking broken jack</p>
<p>and i tell you what it hurts</p>
<p>and he got fucking beat up the</p>
<p>other night</p>
<p>he got beat up dog</p>
<p>that last punch what he got he got that on the</p>
<p>floor i&rsquo;ve watched that end ten times already</p>
<p>he got that on the fucking</p>
<p>floor he got hit</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s coming back like that i</p>
<p>think that fuck with him he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>big viking ego</p>
<p>fucking shit somebody took it to you</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different game now you get humble</p>
<p>and he may come back</p>
<p>strong but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna let people</p>
<p>punch him in the fucking face now</p>
<p>watch that car when</p>
<p>fight when it&rsquo;s on next time</p>
<p>watch it again on your computer</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see what i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about that nobody mentioned nobody mentioned it at all</p>
<p>he got hit one people did mention it a lot of people</p>
<p>got a coward</p>
<p>with he fucking</p>
<p>he went see</p>
<p>that means he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never been hit before</p>
<p>that means jack hmm</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know about that man</p>
<p>i think you know it&rsquo;s kind of it&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>thing because he was such a huge draw</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>still is such a huge draw because of pro wrestling and</p>
<p>everything like that that he was like rushed</p>
<p>right into the big leagues right away</p>
<p>like if really if you wanted to be</p>
<p>smart with a guy like that and you wanted to really</p>
<p>build them up correctly</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t just do that with them you</p>
<p>would slowly work them in and then have them</p>
<p>fight for the</p>
<p>title once the demand was through the fucking roof</p>
<p>but they had that perfect</p>
<p>fight with him and</p>
<p>randy couture</p>
<p>it was such a perfect promotional fight</p>
<p>you know one of the greatest ever fucking hall of famer</p>
<p>fighting this new big young</p>
<p>crazy dude and holy shit can he beat him</p>
<p>or really randy was you know</p>
<p>i mean he was the heavyweight</p>
<p>champion but you know he was forty five i</p>
<p>think at the time and it&rsquo;s like you know so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>past his prime to be</p>
<p>fighting a guy that&rsquo;s this big in this athletic</p>
<p>this crazy so all of a</p>
<p>sudden brock</p>
<p>beats him and now brock is just at the top of the heap</p>
<p>with all these</p>
<p>ferocious lions who have been doing</p>
<p>mma for 10 years</p>
<p>nipping at his heels</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s a big goddamn gap there</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a few guys there that have a big ass gap</p>
<p>you know cain&rsquo;s one of them</p>
<p>his full mma</p>
<p>game is at a way higher</p>
<p>level the time that he&rsquo;s put in</p>
<p>the way he picks</p>
<p>things up he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>everything he does is perfect he&rsquo;s a baby any</p>
<p>twenty six or</p>
<p>something like that</p>
<p>yeah fucking baby</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a baby so</p>
<p>all you heavyweight</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>you better start</p>
<p>dropping down to two o five and shit yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>scary for a</p>
<p>while good luck with all that and i just</p>
<p>want to tell people that when i don&rsquo;t make a joy karate</p>

<p>other times is that i&rsquo;m fucking stumped and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna give you bad info</p>

<p>their uncle joey that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uncle joey that</p>
<p>campman shields</p>
<p>fight man cantman</p>
<p>could have won that</p>
<p>fight a lot of people thought that i was</p>
<p>hyping up shields</p>
<p>and that i wasn&rsquo;t talking enough</p>
<p>about campman</p>
<p>i think you know i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>big camping fan that&rsquo;s bullshit you and i were talking</p>
<p>about camping at dinner</p>
<p>friday i said to</p>
<p>you he ain&rsquo;t no joke he&rsquo;s from 10th tennessee</p>
<p>because i see</p>
<p>mike powell he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different mike</p>
<p>i like bro i love</p>
<p>mike from denmark bro i know i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>these things you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a bad motherfucker i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>he fought the</p>
<p>wrong fight in that</p>
<p>fight but he</p>
<p>could have won that</p>
<p>fight he could</p>
<p>have won it</p>
<p>jake shields was exhausted man he had cut 20</p>
<p>pounds in a day</p>
<p>to get down to 170 because you know he had been</p>
<p>fighting at 185</p>
<p>strike force and he put on</p>
<p>you said that during that break</p>
<p>put on some muscle man he</p>
<p>had a real hard time making that 170 a real hard time</p>
<p>he was dead in the water and</p>
<p>campman just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t quite i</p>
<p>was you know i was really</p>
<p>thinking the camp was</p>
<p>gonna pull it off</p>
<p>you know i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to say it you know i didn&rsquo;t want to say before the</p>
<p>fight but when i saw what</p>
<p>shape jake was</p>
<p>in the way ins</p>
<p>right before he</p>
<p>went on i was like this guy looks like he has aids</p>
<p>like he looks like he&rsquo;s dehydrated he looks like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dead he looked terrible bro</p>
<p>i was shocked like he looks so terrible</p>
<p>that i saw him i</p>
<p>shook his hand i was like whoa</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s some guys that look</p>
<p>the worst i ever saw</p>
<p>was travis looter</p>
<p>when travis looter was gonna</p>
<p>fight anderson so yeah</p>
<p>listen man i he</p>
<p>weighed in twice</p>
<p>i was there for the</p>
<p>first weight in he looked terrible</p>
<p>he had dry chapped lips</p>
<p>he was gone to was sucked in</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t make weight and so he had another hour i</p>
<p>think or two</p>
<p>hours to make weight well</p>
<p>he tried to make weight another 45 minutes and then he</p>
<p>shuffled over to the</p>
<p>scale he couldn&rsquo;t walk bro</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t walk</p>
<p>jake had to walk upstairs</p>
<p>to get to where the</p>
<p>stairs was and you</p>
<p>could see him</p>
<p>as he was walking upstairs it was like</p>
<p>it was awkward</p>
<p>it was awkward</p>
<p>watching him walk that&rsquo;s how exhausting he was</p>
<p>and then he got on the scale</p>
<p>nothin like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his face like</p>
<p>travis looter looked like he was dead</p>
<p>he looked like a zombie bro</p>
<p>he looked like a dead man that was walking he</p>
<p>looked like a guy</p>
<p>who had been poisoned</p>
<p>and 24 hours</p>
<p>after that he was supposed to be fighting</p>
<p>the baddest</p>
<p>motherfucker on the planet in anderson silva</p>
<p>in 24 hours</p>
<p>and he walks over and he</p>
<p>still can&rsquo;t make weight he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still like a</p>
<p>pound and a half off there&rsquo;s no way he can lose it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just fucked</p>
<p>he just calculated it</p>
<p>wrong or you know he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>lose enough fat or he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stick to his diet you</p>
<p>should have done</p>
<p>the weight watches tell him brian</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>counted those fucking</p>
<p>points these guys are</p>
<p>they got it down to science</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re cutting</p>
<p>so much fucking weight they&rsquo;re cutting 20</p>
<p>pounds you know a lot of them are cutting 20 pounds</p>
<p>and they do it slowly one of the</p>
<p>dongy yang a korean dude</p>
<p>who fought on the card he lost to chris kumozi</p>
<p>very very close and</p>
<p>controversial decision a lot of people thought that he</p>
<p>should have won</p>
<p>but he was at</p>
<p>legends on monday cut and wait</p>
<p>on monday on</p>
<p>monday and the</p>
<p>fight the wayne&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>until friday</p>
<p>but he was at legends cut in weight already on</p>
<p>monday so that</p>
<p>motherfuckers losing like probably he&rsquo;s probably losing</p>
<p>twenty pounds</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s doing it over a course of like five days</p>
<p>cause he looked huge when he got into the cage such a</p>
<p>giant muscle bound dude</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>these guys have it down to</p>
<p>a science how to dehydrate yourself and then come back</p>
<p>so that was if kampman had a time</p>
<p>that was his time man he</p>
<p>could have won that fight</p>
<p>especially if he pushed away</p>
<p>and just started firing on him</p>
<p>in the third round</p>
<p>mccampman&rsquo;s a badass striker</p>
<p>his fucking</p>
<p>striking is</p>
<p>clean man if you look at that paul</p>
<p>tiago fight</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a beautiful representation of his</p>
<p>skills because paul</p>
<p>tiago is like this</p>
<p>really rough and tumble bad</p>
<p>motherfucker and he&rsquo;s got dynamite in his hands</p>
<p>knocked out josh costcheck</p>
<p>and martin cameron just picks him</p>
<p>apart dude picks him</p>
<p>apart standing</p>
<p>using his jab and leg kicks and just</p>
<p>angles like</p>
<p>everything i mean paul just got like out</p>
<p>class in the feet</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s swinging</p>
<p>these wild i mean if they hit you you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s swinging some</p>
<p>sledgehammers but</p>
<p>he ain&rsquo;t even getting</p>
<p>close to hitting canman</p>
<p>and i was like man canton</p>
<p>skills are so much better than jake shields</p>
<p>as a kickboxer i just don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>he was trying</p>
<p>to engage him and grappling you know he came</p>
<p>close a couple times</p>
<p>like i was like</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>prove me wrong it looks like you locked up a couple of</p>
<p>chokes almost he almost got it but</p>
<p>that motherfucker is so hard to tap</p>
<p>jake shields is so hard to tap</p>
<p>mayhem almost got him</p>
<p>mayhem had his back yes</p>
<p>and had a fully locked in</p>
<p>mayhem almost got him but</p>
<p>mayhem&rsquo;s big</p>
<p>mayhem&rsquo;s big as fuck</p>
<p>you know mayhem is a big one eighty five</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s strong and his</p>
<p>jiu jitsu is very very</p>
<p>underrated you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had two guys that i rolled with just ran</p>
<p>right through me</p>
<p>mayhem and jake</p>
<p>shields both of them</p>
<p>both those guys were a fellow girls helpless</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing i</p>
<p>could do with them they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>too goddamn</p>
<p>strong jake</p>
<p>shields is a badass wrestler</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just his grappling and his</p>
<p>jiu jitsu is just his technique is awesome and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>strong as shit</p>
<p>he knows what the fuck he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>and has a disadvantage there i wonder why he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>engaging this dude</p>
<p>if jake wasn&rsquo;t like really beat down</p>
<p>i mean the fact</p>
<p>that jake was beat down like that he was</p>
<p>still able to get take down so</p>
<p>still able to</p>
<p>reverse position and</p>
<p>mount them and getting some dominant spots on</p>
<p>shows you how badass is grappling is</p>
<p>but campman&rsquo;s kickboxing is like</p>
<p>like if jake</p>
<p>shield is like</p>
<p>a purple belt campman is a fucking straight</p>
<p>black belt in</p>
<p>stand up his</p>
<p>stand up is</p>
<p>crisp man he does</p>
<p>everything good</p>
<p>everything perfect the way he moves his footwork</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big gap between him and jake</p>
<p>shields jake</p>
<p>shields is like</p>
<p>plaid punch</p>
<p>punch kick his</p>
<p>his body kicks pretty good on his left side</p>
<p>he throws good body kicks he&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>throw some good leg kicks too</p>
<p>but really he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just trying to get the clinch and take your ass down</p>
<p>and if he&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>tired to do that like in</p>
<p>that round with the</p>
<p>third round with camp</p>
<p>minute shields i thought campman</p>
<p>was gonna move away</p>
<p>i thought why</p>
<p>would he grapple</p>
<p>with him in this</p>
<p>round this is the</p>
<p>round where he</p>
<p>could jack him</p>
<p>cam is one of</p>
<p>those dudes though that like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just like just outside the very very best</p>
<p>but he you could see him like</p>
<p>launch into</p>
<p>the very best like with any one big performance</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys like</p>
<p>like carlos</p>
<p>condit like carlos</p>
<p>condit just leaped into</p>
<p>one of the very best when he</p>
<p>knocked out dan hardy</p>
<p>unbelievable</p>
<p>when he knocked out dan hardy i was like okay this</p>
<p>motherfucker you know</p>
<p>everyone knew</p>
<p>he was a badass everyone knew he had that real</p>
<p>close fight with kampman</p>
<p>which was a fucking incredible war</p>
<p>and then the real</p>
<p>close fight with jake</p>
<p>ellenberger another fucking animal</p>
<p>ellenberger is a beast</p>
<p>so you knew that</p>
<p>carlos con it was a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker but when he</p>
<p>knocked out dan hardy was like okay this dude is</p>
<p>not only is he a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like getting better all the time he&rsquo;s like hitting new</p>

<p>was pulling for camping with</p>
<p>everything i had because i love jake</p>
<p>shields but me too</p>
<p>camp is just this guy that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there you know</p>
<p>remember hanging out with mike wiggle john</p>
<p>thank you sorry</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a douchebag that</p>
<p>i smoke too much weed i forgot his name but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a he&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>striking coach</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s you know what i was really impressed with with</p>
<p>carlos condit</p>
<p>and that fight with dan hardy was the technique that he</p>
<p>threw that left hook with</p>
<p>if you look at</p>
<p>the both guys throw the</p>
<p>punch at the</p>
<p>exact same time really</p>
<p>but carlos was perfect</p>
<p>carlos was instead of coming wide he came</p>
<p>he came like with a perfect</p>
<p>angle to the</p>
<p>punch and it was perfect accuracy</p>
<p>and his other hand was up</p>
<p>you know he did it with perfect technique</p>
<p>and he nailed them he caught</p>
<p>him in the exchange and that&rsquo;s like a perfect lesson</p>
<p>for people to learn</p>
<p>but if you if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the most important</p>
<p>things is to concentrate on technique</p>
<p>yeah you can</p>
<p>knock guys out with</p>
<p>crazy wild loopy</p>
<p>shit you can you can</p>
<p>knock guys out with haymakers</p>
<p>where your fucking chin</p>
<p>is down and your hands are up if you connect you can</p>
<p>knock them out</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not the best way to do</p>
<p>it the best way to do it is to use the proper technique</p>
<p>cause if you do that you have more of a chance</p>
<p>of knocking them out</p>
<p>if you have big</p>
<p>power and you&rsquo;re fast</p>
<p>you can get away with some</p>
<p>goofy shit like roy</p>
<p>jones did when he was in his prime</p>
<p>but look what happened to roy</p>
<p>jones once he</p>
<p>started to slow down</p>
<p>when he didn&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>crazy athleticism</p>
<p>all of a sudden he couldn&rsquo;t pull off what he could but</p>
<p>bernard hopkins still can</p>
<p>bernard hopkins</p>
<p>has perfect technique</p>
<p>if bernard hopkins had the athleticism of roy</p>
<p>jones jr i mean</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why bernard hopkins is bernard hopkins it&rsquo;s like maybe</p>
<p>jiu jitsu guys they always say the best</p>
<p>jiu jitsu guys are the guys that aren&rsquo;t physically</p>
<p>strong because they can&rsquo;t pull off anything else</p>
<p>unless they have perfect technique</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>leverage and</p>
<p>techniques i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>are not strong</p>
<p>really yeah the most technical</p>
<p>guys are the guys that aren&rsquo;t physically strong</p>
<p>the most technical guys if you want to</p>
<p>learn jiu jitsu you always want to</p>
<p>learn from a small guy</p>
<p>because big guys</p>
<p>have like kimuras and guillotines they do a lot of like</p>
<p>power jiu jitsu they will do a lot of</p>
<p>things that you can only get away with if you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>strong whereas a</p>
<p>small guy has no options</p>
<p>other than use perfect</p>
<p>leverage and perfect technique hmm</p>
<p>yeah so you should</p>
<p>learn you&rsquo;re better off</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>when you open up your little kung fu fucking</p>
<p>school cock sucker</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>teach anybody man i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>teaching you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny because i</p>
<p>touch my daughter</p>
<p>do you really</p>
<p>sure yeah i know you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t kick by i teach</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve taught</p>
<p>friends and shit</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s you know the thing</p>
<p>about you know if you want to like be a</p>
<p>coach like a winkle john or</p>
<p>like a trevor whitman</p>
<p>man that&rsquo;s your life dude you&rsquo;re dedicating yourself to</p>
<p>these guys and to</p>
<p>their progress and it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>fascinating</p>
<p>thing but you got to be willing to</p>
<p>dedicate 100 that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the reason why i quit</p>
<p>teaching taekwondo</p>
<p>is because i</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>stand up comedy</p>
<p>and i realized that i was not</p>
<p>gonna be giving this 100 of my time anymore and i had a</p>
<p>bunch of guys that was leading in tournaments</p>
<p>and even though i had stopped</p>
<p>fighting taekwondo</p>
<p>tournaments and i was doing kickboxing</p>
<p>i was still</p>
<p>teaching at a taekwondo</p>
<p>school and i was</p>
<p>still leading people in tournaments</p>
<p>and so i would have</p>
<p>these kids that i&rsquo;d coached and i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>bring them to like</p>
<p>these beginner tournaments and i was</p>
<p>dedicating a lot</p>
<p>of time to it and i had a lot of people that had like</p>
<p>10 guys that were like really</p>
<p>competitive and a girl who was really competitive</p>
<p>and she was really good and i</p>
<p>spent a lot of time with them like many many</p>
<p>hours every week</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>at least three</p>
<p>nights four</p>
<p>nights a week</p>
<p>at least two</p>
<p>hours a night</p>
<p>just dedicated</p>
<p>to training with these kids</p>
<p>and working with them and i knew</p>
<p>that once i</p>
<p>started doing comedy</p>
<p>and i needed</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t be there at</p>
<p>night time because</p>
<p>i had to go to do a gig in connecticut</p>
<p>or i couldn&rsquo;t be there</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d have somebody else</p>
<p>teaching it for me i&rsquo;m like they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to do it the way i do it</p>
<p>and this is not</p>
<p>gonna be the same</p>
<p>thing and this is not it&rsquo;s not fair</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna half ass it and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna feel shitty</p>
<p>about that the one</p>
<p>thing that it made me feel good</p>
<p>about my life ever</p>
<p>was martial arts</p>
<p>so i was like i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>not do this i can&rsquo;t fuck this up</p>
<p>because i have to quit</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>do a shit job at this i can&rsquo;t do a shit job at teaching</p>
<p>because to me it was like</p>
<p>one of the defining moments in my life that i wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>loser like when i was</p>
<p>teaching taekwondo at boston university</p>
<p>i was like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>teaching at</p>
<p>a university</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m like an</p>
<p>expert at something and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>teaching people that want to</p>
<p>learn this how to use it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one of the</p>
<p>first times</p>
<p>in my life i felt like i was</p>
<p>worth something you know</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no way i</p>
<p>could fuck this up</p>
<p>so i could just quit</p>
<p>i just quit teaching</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>i feel like right now</p>
<p>i get interested</p>
<p>in strategy and i get interested when i see guys</p>
<p>fight what i</p>
<p>think is a very unintelligent</p>
<p>fight and they don&rsquo;t have the proper coaching</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really mapped out of game plan</p>
<p>a lot of these dudes are really good</p>
<p>and because they&rsquo;re really good they know what they can</p>
<p>do and they know what they want to do and they sort of</p>
<p>plot out their own plan in a fight</p>
<p>which is all well and good</p>
<p>but sometimes you need someone who&rsquo;s also really good</p>
<p>also has a really good knowledge of this</p>
<p>and is outside of it looking in</p>
<p>because someone was outside with</p>
<p>greg jackson</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s looking in</p>
<p>one of the reasons why</p>
<p>dave camarillo and bob cook they&rsquo;re outside</p>
<p>they see the whole</p>
<p>thing and they&rsquo;re very intelligent and they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>immersed in the game</p>
<p>like bob cook and dave camarillo</p>
<p>they break down</p>
<p>fighters they spend time</p>
<p>they go over tapes they analyze</p>
<p>shit and when it comes down to a</p>
<p>fight they&rsquo;ve got a very intelligent strategy</p>
<p>and if you listen</p>
<p>to that strategy and you follow that game plan</p>
<p>you have a very good chance of winning</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be variations shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to make adjustments</p>
<p>but of course you do that&rsquo;s part of the game</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be shit happens okay you can&rsquo;t take him down</p>
<p>listen you gotta kick that</p>
<p>motherfucker&rsquo;s legs</p>
<p>okay if you can&rsquo;t kick him down he wants to</p>
<p>stand up with you</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s open for that inside leg kick</p>
<p>and then you have to have</p>
<p>you know here&rsquo;s plan b okay now we&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>okay you think you</p>
<p>broke your foot okay stop</p>
<p>throwing kicks</p>
<p>this is what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna bait him</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get him into exchange</p>
<p>and fire off the left hook</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s open for a left hook you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>like they have this all</p>
<p>thought out they have it thought out like you have the</p>
<p>diet thought out</p>
<p>every 14 every plan</p>
<p>every time i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing how there&rsquo;s so much more to this than what you</p>
<p>would think you need the</p>
<p>and go hit the bag you know you have jiu jitsu</p>
<p>you have your strength and conditioning it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>how you know what</p>
<p>i noticed then and i don&rsquo;t know if you notice i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>start doing a column</p>
<p>for pro mma</p>
<p>oh yeah yeah once a week or once a month</p>
<p>right just writing some</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s weird because what your</p>
<p>first column</p>
<p>gonna be about and i</p>
<p>and i noticed that</p>
<p>the last two years</p>
<p>every time i&rsquo;ve gone to an</p>
<p>mma event with you</p>
<p>somebody else in the</p>
<p>ufc division</p>
<p>is losing away the trying to get healthy</p>
<p>this last time i went to austin you got bert</p>
<p>uh huh right</p>
<p>50 60 pounds</p>
<p>right our friend&rsquo;s mom lost a</p>
<p>bunch of weights</p>
<p>right now and i seen another guy and then we have our</p>
<p>buddy deepest</p>
<p>quality who we&rsquo;ve both lost</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s weak because of the sleep ab</p>
<p>so we and how</p>
<p>mma affects some people</p>
<p>like i was sick and</p>
<p>tired of going through</p>
<p>those fights</p>
<p>a really fat fuck when you see all</p>
<p>those people in shape</p>
<p>and then when i went to this last year of see</p>
<p>i even seen that they put</p>
<p>two different tables out</p>
<p>like they put</p>
<p>table with cookies and cakes</p>
<p>then they had</p>
<p>tables that like healthy</p>
<p>snacks and it&rsquo;s so weird like</p>
<p>these people when you&rsquo;re around this is what</p>
<p>mma has done for me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not a fighter</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna do jiu</p>
<p>jitsu or nothing</p>
<p>but being around</p>
<p>those guys you&rsquo;re like fuck</p>
<p>i gotta be healthy whenever i</p>
<p>watch those ufc</p>
<p>you know twenty four</p>
<p>sevens whatever they are like</p>

<p>definitely inspires people it inspires people</p>
<p>every time i go to a ufc event</p>
<p>somebody else is on a diet</p>
<p>or somebody else</p>
<p>is getting healthy or somebody else is eating healthy</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ve seen from mma</p>
<p>and it started with me</p>
<p>that ultimate</p>
<p>fight of the year</p>
<p>tate was on it</p>
<p>the kid that lost a hundred something</p>
<p>pounds from doing jiu jitsu</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>ufc no more</p>
<p>but he talked</p>
<p>about it he goes you know even if i just</p>
<p>final in this at</p>
<p>least people lose weight and try this</p>

<p>season as tape yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>it was on there with tape that&rsquo;s why it</p>
<p>was weird how</p>
<p>every time i go i see somebody that&rsquo;s just inspiring</p>
<p>to me you know i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>yeah man i think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things that i</p>
<p>would be interested in doing outside of</p>
<p>doing comedy</p>
<p>outside of like of all the</p>
<p>stuff that i get fascinated by a pool and all</p>
<p>that was that is one</p>
<p>thing that i</p>
<p>would get interested in doing</p>
<p>opening up a gym</p>
<p>training fighters</p>
<p>but and just being</p>
<p>sort of a greg jackson</p>
<p>type of guy having ideas and strategies and helping</p>
<p>people through</p>
<p>but that would have to be something i&rsquo;m 100</p>
<p>dedicated you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fuck around with that and half ass that man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not something to have fast</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking people who have a</p>
<p>limited window in the sport</p>
<p>a fighter can</p>
<p>fight from the time they&rsquo;re 18 till they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>most guys 38 48</p>
<p>48 if you&rsquo;re andy 38 if you&rsquo;re a normal human</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s it you got 20 years</p>
<p>and during that time if you&rsquo;re really into a</p>
<p>bunch of wars</p>
<p>cut that time down substantially</p>
<p>anytime you have a big war anytime you have a crazy</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your style</p>
<p>you know you want a vandalee silva</p>
<p>like vandalee used to do in the early days</p>
<p>no matter what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna shorten your career a bit you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna be 48 years old</p>
<p>fighting like that that&rsquo;s a different kind of</p>
<p>style i remember one</p>
<p>thing that you&rsquo;ve always talked</p>
<p>about that is very you see it</p>
<p>shut this fridge off</p>
<p>this shit&rsquo;s loud it&rsquo;s the gyms that have the gym wars</p>
<p>the camps where they have gym wars</p>
<p>yeah you could see</p>
<p>those guys that</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re a little</p>
<p>seasoned and stuff but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been hitting the head a couple more times than</p>
<p>regular guys</p>
<p>and you can really</p>
<p>those gym wars are the ones that will</p>
<p>really kill you yeah you have to have guys that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>training with that you trust</p>
<p>and you have to</p>
<p>be careful not to hurt each</p>
<p>other you know guys hurt each</p>
<p>other sometimes</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>by accident</p>
<p>or just because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>training hard i mean that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a part of the game</p>
<p>but you gotta be careful</p>
<p>with just gyms</p>
<p>where they just</p>
<p>basically fight</p>
<p>every week like</p>
<p>every week you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting every week two</p>
<p>three times a week you guys are</p>
<p>blasting each other</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fighting you</p>
<p>basically get in and one good thing</p>
<p>about it is you get used to fighting</p>
<p>you get used to getting tagged</p>
<p>you get used to being in there in the pocket you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be a tough</p>
<p>motherfucker to get in</p>
<p>the cage with</p>
<p>because this shit is</p>
<p>going down in your life</p>
<p>every day you&rsquo;re used to it you&rsquo;re used to full</p>
<p>blast blows</p>
<p>but on the other side</p>
<p>you can only do that for so long if you do that</p>
<p>and take big big shots all the time on a regular basis</p>
<p>your career gets</p>
<p>short and substantially</p>
<p>your brain is only set up</p>
<p>to take a certain amount of</p>
<p>abuse before there&rsquo;s just way too much damage</p>
<p>and all the</p>
<p>stuff they&rsquo;re finding out now</p>
<p>about football players</p>
<p>you know when they&rsquo;re examining</p>
<p>their brains</p>
<p>after they die special i told you</p>
<p>about the luke game</p>
<p>oh yeah very amazing yeah</p>
<p>eddie told me</p>
<p>about that too</p>
<p>it was very intricate that special</p>
<p>fucking scary shit man</p>
<p>i watched the</p>
<p>other one where was that football player</p>
<p>i believe he played</p>
<p>for harvard</p>
<p>in college and then</p>
<p>after college he became a pro</p>
<p>wrestler and he suffered a gang of</p>
<p>concussions</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>one of the reasons why i brought up the brock</p>
<p>lesnar situation</p>
<p>because those guys suffer a lot of concussions a lot</p>
<p>they take a lot of hard shots</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a video of brock lesnar</p>
<p>where brock</p>
<p>lesnar is on top of the</p>
<p>third rope i don&rsquo;t know who he was</p>
<p>wrestling against</p>
<p>but he was on top of the</p>
<p>third rope and he</p>
<p>jumps up through the air and does like a fucking three</p>
<p>flip but miss calculates and lands on his head</p>
<p>dude he&rsquo;s three hundred</p>
<p>pounds okay</p>
<p>and he throws</p>
<p>himself through the air flips and lands on his head</p>
<p>he should be dead</p>
<p>he should be dead</p>
<p>you gotta see the</p>
<p>video here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>video if you watch the</p>
<p>video any normal person</p>
<p>would be dead</p>
<p>watch this shit</p>
<p>watch this shit we&rsquo;re watching on youtube watch this</p>
<p>dude he landed on his head</p>
<p>he landed on his fucking head</p>
<p>he completely miscalculated the jump</p>
<p>completely and he landed on his head and</p>
<p>still finished the pin</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll retweet the link on my twitter</p>
<p>his brains you want to talk scrambled eggs</p>
<p>his brains should be a</p>
<p>small half cup of oatmeal</p>
<p>in the bottom of an empty bowl</p>
<p>they should be dead</p>
<p>it should have crushed his whole brain</p>
<p>i mean for me</p>
<p>if that was me or you and we did that we&rsquo;d be dead</p>
<p>but that guy&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i said like if that happened</p>
<p>during this one that we saw</p>
<p>how many times did he</p>
<p>accidentally bang his head</p>
<p>other times</p>
<p>these guys are gigantic dudes</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>throwing each</p>
<p>other i mean people don&rsquo;t realize the</p>
<p>abuse that people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bodies take on pro wrestling</p>
<p>the reason why a lot of</p>
<p>those guys get hooked on painkillers</p>
<p>pro wrestling is one of the most difficult</p>
<p>things to do in all of show business</p>
<p>even in all of</p>
<p>sports even though it&rsquo;s not really a</p>
<p>sport i mean</p>
<p>per se i mean there&rsquo;s predetermined outcomes</p>
<p>it still requires an incredible amount of athleticism</p>
<p>an incredible amount of work</p>
<p>these guys are on the road like</p>
<p>every night they&rsquo;re on the road several</p>
<p>nights a week performing shows</p>
<p>throwing each</p>
<p>other through the air</p>
<p>they have to come up with new more</p>
<p>spectacular moves to satisfy people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re jumping off ropes they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>jumping off the top of the fucking cage and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>flipping and doing this and</p>
<p>you grab my</p>
<p>ankles and i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>throw you through</p>

<p>the ability</p>
<p>to lose your</p>
<p>body for when</p>
<p>he goes down i mean how long</p>
<p>the ability</p>
<p>to move your body keep saying that in the broadcast</p>
<p>about how good he moves</p>
<p>when all those fucking football players move like</p>
<p>yeah you see</p>
<p>those guys who</p>
<p>become linemen</p>
<p>you seen offensive</p>
<p>lineman this six oh yeah</p>
<p>two ninety and they</p>
<p>super athletes and</p>
<p>these motherfuckers they won&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>could you imagine if a michael vick wanted to get into</p>
<p>mma amazing how bad he</p>
<p>would fuck people up amazing oh</p>
<p>if a guy like that that</p>
<p>level of athlete</p>
<p>dedicated him i mean there are guys like that</p>
<p>is a few yeah there&rsquo;s a few that are in there now but</p>
<p>those super athletes like a michael jordan</p>
<p>you know michael jordan decided</p>
<p>from the time he was well he had</p>
<p>to bet on himself to beat you</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d have to bet on himself he probably would</p>
<p>michael jordan</p>
<p>would love that</p>
<p>shit he would</p>
<p>fight listen</p>
<p>cause his wife</p>
<p>could bet for him he</p>
<p>could go to</p>
<p>vegas and if he was fighting</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like put</p>
<p>everything on him he had a thousand people bet in the</p>
<p>phone that motherfucker would</p>
<p>he would beat liddell if he bet on himself</p>
<p>cause he bet</p>
<p>he was he hit liddell with a</p>
<p>chair dude he was</p>
<p>such an athlete</p>
<p>do you remember how he would</p>
<p>when he was the</p>
<p>first guy that</p>
<p>would literally fly through the fucking air</p>
<p>slamming in dunks</p>
<p>where you would see it on the highlight reels on</p>
<p>espn you would see it on the news</p>
<p>and people would just be</p>
<p>standing there shaking</p>
<p>their head going</p>
<p>how the fuck</p>
<p>could he do that</p>
<p>he was flying</p>
<p>with his tongue out</p>
<p>flying through the air</p>
<p>smashing that ball through there i mean</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t even follow</p>
<p>basketball and all i saw</p>
<p>was that dude doing these</p>
<p>superhuman feats of athleticism</p>
<p>if that guy decide</p>
<p>you imagine the flying knee jordan can hit you with</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>the flying double knee</p>
<p>like a fucking jose aldo</p>
<p>style that michael jordan</p>
<p>could hit you with</p>
<p>if michael jordan</p>
<p>dedicated his time to that instead of basketball</p>
<p>god damn he&rsquo;d be a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>those guys are coming man</p>
<p>those guys are coming</p>
<p>those that&rsquo;s the next wave of mma</p>
<p>the next wave of mma is the</p>
<p>super athlete phil</p>
<p>davis yeah john</p>
<p>john i mean john jones even</p>
<p>lesnar even</p>
<p>lesnar look</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t know the game</p>
<p>yet he&rsquo;s relatively inexperienced he&rsquo;s only had six</p>
<p>fights seven fights</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s not that many</p>
<p>man that&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s not not enough to be fighting</p>
<p>what is he got</p>
<p>he fought the the korean gentleman in his ufc debut</p>
<p>then he fought</p>
<p>frank meer and got leg blocked</p>
<p>and then he fought</p>
<p>keith haring and beat him on decision</p>
<p>then he fought</p>
<p>uh randy and he beat</p>
<p>randy got the title</p>
<p>and then he fought</p>
<p>frank mayer</p>
<p>again that&rsquo;s five and then he fought is</p>
<p>it just six</p>
<p>and then he fought</p>
<p>six seven and the</p>
<p>seven eight</p>
<p>really i counted seven</p>
<p>either way it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>relatively inexperienced and</p>
<p>right away thrust into the deep end of the they threw</p>
<p>me to the fucking the guy as an ncaa</p>
<p>national champion</p>
<p>had some serious technique there&rsquo;s no way you become a</p>
<p>champion wrestler</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>strong because</p>
<p>those guys are just</p>
<p>strong too i mean</p>
<p>you have to have some serious technique so</p>
<p>he can learn</p>
<p>he just has to be brought up correctly</p>
<p>what he really</p>
<p>should have done with him</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard with</p>
<p>heavyweights though</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s not as many guys that are willing to</p>
<p>fight a guy like that</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re coming up like</p>
<p>who the fuck&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fight him and the king in the cage</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s he gonna</p>
<p>learn out of that</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gotta be tested somehow</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>weird middle ground like you</p>
<p>gotta get him in bellator</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>you gotta get him to</p>
<p>fight guys that are just a hair under</p>
<p>strike force</p>
<p>level just ahead</p>
<p>well strike</p>
<p>force in ufc</p>
<p>right now they&rsquo;re pretty</p>
<p>close with alstar</p>
<p>alstar and phaidor</p>
<p>and for doom&rsquo;s</p>
<p>capable of beating anybody if he gets them in the</p>
<p>right position</p>
<p>and josh barnett he&rsquo;s a dangerous</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some dangerous guys</p>
<p>antonio de silva</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not quite the same</p>
<p>levels ufc but i</p>
<p>think that like</p>
<p>when a guy comes</p>
<p>up that&rsquo;s got that much potential like a brock lesnar</p>
<p>like you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you gotta you</p>
<p>gotta make sure that you take the most advantage</p>
<p>out of these physical gifts</p>
<p>you know you gotta</p>
<p>bring them up the</p>
<p>right way or just</p>
<p>throw them in like they did man</p>
<p>but like they did they made a</p>
<p>ton of money</p>
<p>i mean everybody made a</p>
<p>ton of money</p>
<p>but i just felt that</p>
<p>money they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to make now with the fucking mexicans</p>

<p>put it up there though santos is coming off a big</p>
<p>fight too that roy jones</p>
<p>or the roy nelson</p>

<p>was a real good</p>
<p>fight for him because he got pushed</p>
<p>and he had to work he had to work for</p>
<p>three hard rounds</p>
<p>because roy nelson is no joke man roy nelson is a</p>
<p>powerful motherfucker and he can take it</p>
<p>dos santos hit him with some bombs</p>
<p>and he had to go</p>
<p>three hard rounds with him</p>
<p>it was like a real like grueling fight</p>
<p>where you know roy nelson hit him with some shots too</p>
<p>nelson was always there and always dangerous</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the new</p>
<p>year&rsquo;s card dog</p>
<p>good question</p>
<p>against redhead</p>
<p>against frank</p>
<p>graymainer right yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know exactly</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s set up yet i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s alternative right now</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>carl would hurt his back</p>
<p>for 25 he did yeah he&rsquo;s out of his next</p>
<p>fight really yeah when did this happen all</p>
<p>those heavy weights seen that</p>
<p>fight and fell off</p>
<p>their fucking face when did</p>
<p>this happen</p>
<p>like yesterday they all did that&rsquo;s him</p>
<p>frank me a fellow</p>
<p>you sure carwyn</p>
<p>pulled out yeah</p>
<p>i thought carl</p>
<p>was a finer</p>
<p>oh no i won&rsquo;t pulled out a one</p>
<p>twenty five</p>
<p>that sucks you</p>
<p>heard his back who else</p>
<p>somebody else pulled out a couple pull outs</p>
<p>really yeah carwin</p>
<p>pulls out a january co main wow</p>
<p>having some back pain had an</p>
<p>mri yesterday</p>
<p>do some damage that may require</p>
<p>you reading it yeah it says</p>
<p>i have some</p>
<p>damage that may really require surgery oh no</p>
<p>well you know he had some serious back problems</p>
<p>wrestling you know when he was</p>
<p>wrestling he had some serious back problems and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why he</p>
<p>i think stopped playing football as well because</p>
<p>i think he played football for a bit</p>
<p>somebody else is hurt too</p>
<p>from one of the cars 24</p>
<p>kro cop interested in replacing carwin</p>
<p>versus nelson</p>
<p>whoa croakop wants to step in and</p>
<p>fight roy nelson</p>
<p>roy nelson might not croak</p>
<p>up the fuck out</p>
<p>right out back to croatia in that</p>
<p>crazy fucking</p>
<p>blanket ain&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>crazy that you</p>
<p>would say that that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>is it crazy</p>
<p>to say that but</p>
<p>crazy talk he might</p>
<p>you know or krokov</p>
<p>might just come back with a fucking flurry</p>
<p>you never know when a guy&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>because if you look alike alstar over</p>
<p>him a lot of people</p>
<p>counted alistair over him out</p>
<p>a lot of people said man this guy just keeps getting</p>
<p>knocked out by people surgeon</p>
<p>karatana of</p>
<p>knocked him out</p>
<p>chuck liddell</p>
<p>knocked him out i think</p>
<p>shogun stopped him once i mean there was just like</p>
<p>he had all these</p>
<p>fights where he was getting beat down</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>a lot of people said you know what this guy&rsquo;s just done</p>
<p>and then he went up to</p>
<p>heavyweight</p>
<p>and then he got all</p>
<p>sudden dedicated</p>
<p>and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden he&rsquo;s the baddest</p>
<p>motherfucker in k1</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the most dangerous guy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fighting in</p>
<p>strike force</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s more dangerous than any of</p>
<p>those other</p>
<p>strike force guys i know</p>
<p>phaidor is a</p>
<p>legend i know phaidor is a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker and i&rsquo;m a phaidor fan</p>
<p>but i think phaedor</p>
<p>stands with all star over him i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s night</p>
<p>night soldier i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you can hang in there with that guy i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you realize the level</p>
<p>striking that guy&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>right now he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>training just straight k1 for a long time now</p>
<p>and competing and winning in</p>
<p>high level competition</p>
<p>against high</p>
<p>level competition</p>
<p>beating peter</p>
<p>ertz and shit</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a gang of</p>
<p>those dudes</p>
<p>right now that are bad</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up joe rogan drop it on me as shit croakop</p>
<p>could come back he</p>
<p>could come back</p>
<p>if as long as he can</p>
<p>still take punishment you know i mean</p>
<p>he got hit with a big knee from a big guy</p>
<p>you know but if he can</p>
<p>still take punishment</p>
<p>and he super</p>
<p>dedicates himself decides fuck this i&rsquo;m coming back</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m coming back with a</p>
<p>vengeance him</p>
<p>against roy nelson</p>
<p>could be fun i&rsquo;m sitting there the</p>
<p>other day watching</p>
<p>tito against matt hamilton</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>loved matt hamilton</p>
<p>i like his work</p>
<p>ethic i always pull for him</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m watching</p>
<p>tito whatever and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>fucking john</p>
<p>jones pick this guy up and</p>
<p>threw him around like a fucking</p>
<p>ragdoll like a ragdoll i</p>
<p>never i was thinking</p>
<p>about this this week i&rsquo;m look at this</p>
<p>going this is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s come</p>
<p>later when john</p>
<p>jones handles dudes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you ever seen a like like a</p>
<p>strong bug like a beetle</p>
<p>pick another bug up but just kind of toss it around</p>
<p>like bugs can do</p>
<p>crazy shit to each</p>
<p>other like ants</p>
<p>could just pick other</p>
<p>ants up like they&rsquo;re nothing and just toss them around</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t look like they&rsquo;re even straining</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it looks like when john</p>
<p>jones shows</p>
<p>people around that to that kid my</p>
<p>heart stopped dude</p>
<p>they fucking stop man his lateral drop when he gets</p>
<p>those double overhooks on you he hit</p>
<p>hootie hit with it he hit</p>
<p>the guy with that stefan</p>
<p>bonner stefan</p>
<p>bonner hit stefan</p>
<p>bonner with it he hit</p>
<p>gusma with it</p>
<p>gusma was his</p>
<p>first opponent in ufc</p>
<p>he apparently</p>
<p>kate fletcher told me that he hit it on</p>
<p>keith jardine in training</p>
<p>he said dude you can&rsquo;t even believe it when you see it</p>
<p>keith is this big strong</p>
<p>powerful dude</p>
<p>and john jones just launches</p>
<p>them through the air</p>
<p>flips him over is he i mean</p>
<p>you know a lateral job is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re flipping a guy through the fucking air</p>
<p>feet up the</p>
<p>ankles flying</p>
<p>and he does that to</p>
<p>keith jardine on a regular he&rsquo;s just that</p>
<p>strong he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>freak strong</p>
<p>freak technique</p>
<p>super smart</p>
<p>super humble dude</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the next</p>
<p>level man that</p>
<p>level of athleticism that comes with</p>
<p>those guys that&rsquo;s the next</p>
<p>level that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>right now john jones is</p>
<p>just like all</p>
<p>those other</p>
<p>super athletes in other</p>
<p>sports just like a jordan he&rsquo;s just one of</p>
<p>these guys he&rsquo;s just a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>bad motherfucker with his mind</p>
<p>but that was</p>
<p>also have a downfall to</p>
<p>what they also have</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a dark side to</p>
<p>little have what you were talking</p>
<p>about before which is</p>
<p>they relied too much on the athleticism oh john</p>
<p>jones has a perfect</p>
<p>it draws as they&rsquo;re more involved in it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>happens to michael vick for example did jordan rely</p>
<p>on technique i don&rsquo;t know much</p>
<p>about basketball</p>
<p>did he was he a technique</p>
<p>guy or was he just an athletic guy he was very athletic</p>
<p>but he knew the game of basketball</p>
<p>he had to be he was</p>
<p>one of the greatest ever</p>
<p>school but what i</p>
<p>was saying was the</p>
<p>fighting sometimes</p>
<p>have very fast the hand</p>
<p>speed or they&rsquo;re good with</p>
<p>their legs they move good</p>
<p>but they just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the athleticism stops</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll always lose the technique</p>
<p>right you know like you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never be a gsp</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great athlete but the</p>
<p>motherfucker got</p>
<p>great technique</p>
<p>his technique&rsquo;s perfect it&rsquo;s perfect you know</p>
<p>his guy john donna her the guy who handles he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he does a lot of the</p>
<p>training of gsp and</p>
<p>a lot of the strategy at gsp and he was brought in to</p>
<p>coach with gsp on this</p>
<p>season the ultimate</p>
<p>fighter you saw me as the</p>
<p>australian dude</p>
<p>right together</p>
<p>short yeah i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>new zealand guy</p>
<p>yes yeah he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>43 years old and jujutsu is this guy&rsquo;s life and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a brilliant</p>
<p>motherfucker he lives on his mat i</p>
<p>heard he sleeps</p>
<p>on the mats when he takes naps and shit because he</p>
<p>teaches during the day</p>
<p>you know when he&rsquo;s got no</p>
<p>classes he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>take her naps</p>
<p>room is a fucking man oh really where he</p>
<p>sleeps it might be</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>legend behind this guy</p>
<p>i heard that like he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>these guys like us</p>
<p>like you know like as a</p>
<p>comic sometimes</p>
<p>the best material you get is</p>
<p>right about before you</p>
<p>close your fucking eyes</p>
<p>and you have a decision to make</p>
<p>either you could get up and</p>
<p>write the joke</p>
<p>or you could</p>
<p>get up and say to yourself i remember in the morning</p>
<p>right and then you don&rsquo;t remember who gots in the</p>
<p>morning right</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>motherfucking takes it to the next</p>
<p>level he&rsquo;s in bed</p>
<p>thinking of a move</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;ll get up at four in the mornings</p>
<p>gonna dump start</p>
<p>rolling and</p>
<p>start rolling with the fucking duck you know whatever</p>
<p>just to see if</p>
<p>leverage or whatever</p>
<p>i heard he&rsquo;s one of those guys</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>they credit him with inventing the darse</p>
<p>choke there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>choke that joe drc</p>
<p>is famous for because</p>
<p>mayhem miller</p>
<p>got caught in it by joe drc</p>
<p>and they brought it back and they</p>
<p>started calling it the darse</p>
<p>choke i talked</p>
<p>about it during the podcast</p>
<p>but apparently</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;ve been informed</p>
<p>since i said this during the broadcast</p>
<p>is that donaher actually invented this</p>
<p>choke that he figured it out and he&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>one who showed it to drc and drc showed it to mayhem</p>
<p>so donner he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a legend in</p>
<p>fighting a legend in</p>
<p>like he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fight himself because he&rsquo;s got a fucked up knee</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a legend</p>
<p>amongst jujutsu</p>
<p>circles for being like one of the baddest</p>
<p>motherfuckers to deal with</p>
<p>well his theories are exactly they</p>
<p>mirror my theories</p>
<p>when it comes to mma</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the theory that they espoused when</p>
<p>coaching this</p>
<p>show the ultimate fighter</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>fuck all this</p>
<p>trying to be the</p>
<p>toughest you</p>
<p>know guy trying to</p>
<p>run up hills</p>
<p>the hardest and</p>
<p>throw bags of sand around the hardest</p>
<p>no what&rsquo;s most important is your technique</p>
<p>the technique has to be the most important</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not mental</p>
<p>toughness it&rsquo;s not your ability to</p>
<p>hold your breath</p>
<p>underwater holding</p>
<p>onto rocks it&rsquo;s technique technique and training</p>
<p>that technique</p>
<p>at a furious pace and you&rsquo;ll develop you</p>
<p>learn how to</p>
<p>fight joe how do you</p>
<p>learn you learn</p>
<p>my fighting</p>
<p>you girl what&rsquo;s the fucking</p>
<p>tool were you running up a hill that&rsquo;s something i</p>
<p>never it&rsquo;s great conditioning is</p>
<p>great there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something to strengthen conditioning to prevent</p>
<p>injuries and to give you a certain amount of strength</p>
<p>a certain amount of</p>
<p>power to utilize</p>
<p>those techniques</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>get past that technique is the most important</p>
<p>thing and these</p>
<p>guys you know this donna</p>
<p>her guy like talking to him just reinforces in my eyes</p>
<p>the importance of a</p>
<p>super dedicated coach</p>
<p>like a guy like him</p>
<p>you know a guy like him or a guy like greg jackson</p>
<p>especially don</p>
<p>her i&rsquo;m a big fan of his as anna and greg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>those guys are huge for a</p>
<p>fighter&rsquo;s career</p>
<p>you know to find a wise guy</p>
<p>who is in that role he&rsquo;s not he can&rsquo;t compete he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got he was born with a fucked up knee like he literally</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>do strength and conditioning shit he can&rsquo;t run</p>
<p>his knees fucked up he probably can&rsquo;t take kicks in it</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s not gonna be</p>
<p>fighting but he&rsquo;s fascinated by</p>
<p>it and he&rsquo;s fascinated by it as a science just like you</p>
<p>would be fascinated by chess</p>
<p>as a science and that&rsquo;s how he</p>
<p>breaks it down</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not about</p>
<p>toughness or ego</p>
<p>or any silliness like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all just about</p>
<p>executing the perfect technique and strategy you</p>
<p>watched the ultimate</p>
<p>fighter last week</p>
<p>yes they had a</p>
<p>knucklehead on there</p>
<p>and he walks around and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tougher than the</p>
<p>other guy everybody says</p>
<p>avoid his fucking guillotine yeah</p>
<p>did you see what that yeah</p>
<p>i did what he do</p>
<p>he just dove in on</p>
<p>into the fucking gillard</p>
<p>yeah well it&rsquo;s because you</p>
<p>came wild at him</p>
<p>and he just forced him into his</p>
<p>habits do you</p>
<p>think that that kid</p>
<p>could beat the fuck out of me</p>
<p>that kid with the guillotine</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s got a nasty gig</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>weird way of holding it to</p>
<p>absolutely he he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t hold it like a normal guy does</p>
<p>he like turns it</p>
<p>so that the back</p>
<p>of the palm is facing the face and he pushes down on it</p>
<p>and it kind of</p>
<p>closes off both sides of the neck quicker</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fucking around with it a lot of guys did</p>
<p>nate diaz did that to</p>
<p>who the fuck did he fight</p>
<p>god damn it</p>
<p>irish hagriden</p>
<p>marcus davis marcus</p>
<p>david he did that same technique to</p>
<p>marcus davis he pushes his knuckles</p>
<p>he pushes like</p>
<p>he grabs a hold of his hand and pushes his hand</p>
<p>towards the neck and then that&rsquo;s how he</p>
<p>closes it off</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>jiu jitsu man</p>
<p>guys are constantly</p>
<p>coming up with new variations to techniques</p>
<p>constantly adding new ways to do it there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>variations yeah</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t learn at all man</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>every guy has a different kind of</p>
<p>style some guys always</p>
<p>have the newest craziest moves and they have this</p>
<p>giant encyclopedia of moves they can hit you with</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other guys that only</p>
<p>hit a certain amount</p>
<p>of moves all the time like they go for arm triangles</p>
<p>chokes arm bar</p>
<p>they have three or four moves</p>
<p>you know that they only go to off</p>
<p>their back they have like armbar triangle that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>these are just only moves they go to</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>nasty at them</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>no guerra no</p>
<p>guerra doesn&rsquo;t do like</p>
<p>crazy wild stuff</p>
<p>his jiu jitsu is like</p>
<p>old school hicks and gracie style</p>
<p>jiu jitsu it&rsquo;s like the real traditional jujitsu but</p>
<p>everything he does he does perfect</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m saying like</p>
<p>everything is perfect technique like</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t see no</p>
<p>guerra doing</p>
<p>you know any</p>
<p>crazy like go</p>
<p>goplata rubber</p>
<p>guard sweep</p>
<p>shit like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna just tap you with triangles tap you with arm bars</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying tap you with guillotines get your back</p>
<p>choke you out</p>
<p>all like the</p>
<p>standard shift like</p>
<p>hodger gracie same</p>
<p>thing all those</p>
<p>standard moves they just</p>
<p>hone them to a science you know</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>schools of thought</p>
<p>like hicks and gracie&rsquo;s a perfect example</p>
<p>widely recognized as the</p>
<p>greatest jiu</p>
<p>jitsu guy ever</p>
<p>everybody says that</p>
<p>but hicks and gracie is</p>
<p>traditional</p>
<p>jiu jitsu that&rsquo;s what he hits you with he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t hit you with some</p>
<p>crazy moves you</p>
<p>never saw before</p>
<p>he just goes to</p>
<p>three moves perfect</p>
<p>he knows everything he knows</p>
<p>everything but</p>
<p>his jiu jitsu is all very</p>
<p>standard old</p>
<p>school jiu jitsu</p>
<p>is perfect at it</p>
<p>everything he does</p>
<p>is perfect technique perfect position</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been there a billion times it&rsquo;s a part of his dna</p>
<p>and everybody says the same thing</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know what the fuck</p>
<p>jiu jitsu is</p>
<p>until you roll with hickson</p>
<p>they say he just takes it to another</p>
<p>level he goes</p>
<p>you realize</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s levels to this game</p>
<p>and you think you know what the levels are</p>
<p>until you roll</p>
<p>with a guy like hickson and you just realize</p>
<p>this motherfucker knows exactly what to do</p>
<p>every time you</p>
<p>move a certain way he knows exactly how to respond</p>
<p>and he does it</p>
<p>effortlessly</p>
<p>and you feel like you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>child you feel like you just</p>
<p>learned how to do this</p>
<p>and you getting</p>
<p>strangled meanwhile you&rsquo;ve been putting in 10 years</p>
